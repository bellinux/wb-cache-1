Methods: Analgesic effect of <b>celery</b> <b>root</b> was determined by two animal models of hot plate and acetic acid writhing test.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} the result of my {{research}} on Shuswap (Secwépemc) and Okanagan (Syilx) peoples’ root digging protocols that I carried out between January and July 2012 with three communities in the Secwépemc Nation (Skeetchestn, Simpcw and Tk’emlups) and two communities in the Syilx Nation (Westbank First Nation and Penticton First Nation). For thousands of years, a variety of native root plants have made important contributions to the sustenance of Secwépemc, Syilx and other indigenous peoples of the Interior Plateau. Important among these were, and still are, skwenkwinem (Claytonia lanceolata – springbeauties) and spitl’em/llekw’pin (Lewisia redeviva – bitterroot). Using a grounded theory approach, but also informed by indigenous research methods and my own connection to both nations, I present information from Secwépemc and Syilx root diggers gathered during interviews and root digging expeditions. My focus is on gaining understanding of practices, norms, and rules that Secwépemc and Syilx <b>root</b> <b>harvesters</b> narrated about their techniques of digging and processing of roots, but also about the way that root digging connects them to spiritual and cultural concepts and values. To describe these, I use the term protocols in that it follows present First Nations conventions of referring to what anthropologists call “culture. ” Although western market foods are commonly available in our communities, the enacted protocols of root-digging continue to connect Secwépemc and Syilx people to their identities, ancestors and lands, and can shape the identities of present and future generations. I found that Secwépemc harvesters focused on skwenkwinem, while Syilx harvesters focused on sp̓iƛ̓əm. This is partly due to the ecological conditions in their respective territories. However, as I show, these preferences also reflect important historical and spiritual associations of the respective <b>roots</b> that <b>root</b> <b>harvesters</b> explained to me. These differences, in turn, mark national identities of root diggers and knowledge keepers as being Syilx or Secwépemc...|$|R
40|$|The {{question}} of whether the furocoumarin content of vegetables is sufficient to induce phototoxic skin reactions after ultraviolet irradiation was examined in two experiments with four human volunteers. In a first experiment, 300 g of <b>celery</b> <b>roots</b> (total phototoxic furocoumarin content 28. 2 micrograms/g) was ingested. No skin reactions were observed after UVA exposure (1. 5 - 9 J/cm 2), and the blood levels of the furocoumarins [...] psoralen, 8 -methoxypsoralen (8 -MOP) and 5 -methoxypsoralen (5 -MOP) [...] were below the analytical detection limit of 2 ng/ml. To investigate the phototoxic effects of a mixture of the two most important furocoumarins in vegetables, after gastro-intestinal uptake, 8 -MOP and 5 -MOP (15 mg each) were ingested separately in a 50 % alcoholic solution. A strong and persistent erythema was induced in three out of the four subjects (UVA dose: 3 - 25 J/cm 2). The blood levels immediately before UVA irradiation varied between 14 and 114 ng/ml (8 -MOP), and 17 and 70 ng/ml (5 -MOP). In the subject who did not show phototoxicity, the blood levels remained at trace levels (3 ng/ml). Two subjects were also tested with a mixture of 10 mg 8 -MOP plus 10 mg 5 -MOP; in one subject the mixture induced pigmentation only, while in the other a mild-to-medium erythema was induced. The blood levels of the furocoumarins in the two subjects were similar (12 - 15 ng/ml for 8 -MOP and 5 -MOP). It is concluded that in humans the phototoxic threshold dose of furocoumarin mixtures is of the order of 10 mg 8 -MOP plus 10 mg 5 -MOP, which is equivalent to about 15 mg 8 -MOP per person (blood levels of 8 -MOP and 5 -MOP at 30 min after ingestion of about 10 - 15 ng/ml each). This phototoxic threshold dose was not reached by the consumption of <b>celery</b> <b>roots</b> and other conventional vegetables under normal dietary habits (experimental intake of 2 - 8 mg per subject of the potentially phototoxic furocoumarin mixture). However, the safety factor between the possible actual intake of furocoumarins and the phototoxic threshold dose is about 2 - 10, which is relatively small...|$|R

This method also allowed us the possibility of highlighting the most important wavenumbers for each type of polysaccharide: 1, 740, 1, 610 and 1, 240 cm− 1 denoting pectins or 1, 370 and 1, 317 cm− 1 denoting hemicelluloses and cellulose, respectively...|$|R

MTD {{was found in}} the meristems of <b>celery</b> <b>root</b> apices, in young expanding leaves, in the vascular cambium, and in the phloem, including sieve-element/companion cell complexes, parenchyma, and in the exuding phloem sap of cut petioles. Suspension cells that were grown in medium with mannitol as the sole carbon source showed a high anti-MTD cross-reaction in the cytoplasm, whereas cells that were grown in sucrose-containing medium showed little or no cross-reaction. Gel-blot analysis of proteins from vascular and nonvascular tissues of mature celery petioles showed a strong anti-MTD sera cross-reactive band, corresponding to the 40 -kD molecular mass of MTD in vascular extracts, but no cross-reactive bands in nonvascular extracts. The distribution pattern of MTD within celery plants and in cell cultures that were grown on different carbon sources is consistent with the hypothesis that the Mtd gene may be regulated by sugar repression. Additionally, a developmental component may regulate the distribution of MTD within celery plants...|$|R
