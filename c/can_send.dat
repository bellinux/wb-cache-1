5|$|The Badminton World Federation (BWF) rankings {{are used}} to {{determine}} the qualification of the players for the tournament. In the 2008 Summer Olympics, each singles tournament had 38 competitors, while each doubles tournament had 16 pairs. All players or pairs from the top 16 places on the BWF rankings automatically qualify, although each National Olympic Committee (NOC) <b>can</b> <b>send</b> less than three players or pairs in each tournament. The top 64 then qualify with the caveat that each NOC <b>can</b> <b>send</b> only two players/pairs from that portion of the list. Players and pairs ranked below the 64th place only qualify if they are the highest-ranked competitor from their nation. Two places each in the men's and women's singles will be determined by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) Tripartite Commission. The host nation, if it has not already qualified two competitors, receives at least either two singles players or one pair. The rules used in the tournament are the same as the BWF rules.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the main}} story ends here, the {{introduction}} of the Broken Steel DLC creates a new choice with the ending, in that the Lone Wanderer <b>can</b> <b>send</b> one of their radiation-immune companions into the chamber to input the code. Furthermore, the game remains open-ended from this point onwards, with the Wanderer surviving the radiation they were subjected to, and recovering two weeks later to the news that the purifier is working well and supplying clean water {{to the people of the}} waste, or has been having an adverse effect on life thanks to {{the introduction of}} the modified FEV. Sarah Lyons does not survive if sent into the chamber in the Broken Steel ending.|$|E
5|$|The Internet is a {{worldwide}} network {{of computers and}} computer networks that {{communicate with each other}} using the Internet Protocol.

Hence, any computer on the Internet <b>can</b> <b>send</b> a message to any other computer using its IP address. These messages carry with them the originating computer's IP address allowing for two-way communication. The Internet is thus an exchange of messages between computers.|$|E

Riyad Hossen, the only one to have taken part in the previous games, boxed in the bantamweight class. Papia Rani Sarkar was the only Bangladeshi competing in athletics. Sonia Akter and Anik Islam, the delegation's only two swimmers, each participated in two events. The head of delegation was A K Sarker.|$|E
5|$|Two {{groups of}} {{relatively}} large insects, the Ephemeroptera (mayflies) and the Odonata (dragonflies and damselflies) have the flight muscles attached directly to their wings; the wings can beat no {{faster than the}} rate at which nerves <b>can</b> <b>send</b> impulses to command the muscles to beat. All other living winged insects fly using a different mechanism, involving indirect flight muscles which cause the thorax to vibrate; the wings can beat faster than {{the rate at which}} the muscles receive nerve impulses. This mechanism evolved once, and is the defining feature (synapomorphy) for the infraclass Neoptera.|$|E

5|$|As Captain Jean-Luc Picard (Patrick Stewart) {{attempts}} {{to negotiate with}} the Aldeans, they briefly allow Dr. Crusher to reunite with her son on the planet. Wesley hints about the Custodian to her, while she secretly passes him a tricorder to scan the Aldeans. After Picard fails to get the Aldeans to agree to the children's return, they fire an energy weapon that sends the Enterprise three days away from Aldea at maximum warp. The Aldeans warn that they <b>can</b> <b>send</b> the Enterprise an impossibly far distance if they refuse to cooperate. During the return trip, Dr. Crusher reviews the scanner results and finds the Aldeans are suffering from radiation poisoning, which has harmed their reproductive capabilities but can be reversed if the source is discovered. On arrival back at the planet, Picard orders the crew {{to try to find a}} way through the planet's shield while he restarts negotiations.|$|E
5|$|Outside of {{the main}} game, players can play an {{additional}} mode called Flick Rush, which can be played alone or with another player via wireless multiplayer. In this mode, players battle {{with a team of}} three Spirits and pit them against each other. Players fight against their opponent by flicking up cards from the touchscreen. Each card has a number value determining its attack strength, with multiple cards combining to increase the overall value. The player whose attack value is greater than their opponent's gets to attack with their Spirit. A slowly replenishing meter determines how many cards the player <b>can</b> <b>send</b> out at a time, and each Spirit has a limited amount of cards that can be replenished by swapping them out with another Spirit. The first player to eliminate all of their opponent's Spirits wins the game.|$|E
5|$|The {{game has}} several modes: Star Trip, Simple, Deluge, and Time Attack. Star Trip is Meteos story mode. Its plot {{centers on the}} evil planet Meteo sending its matter (the meteos) to other planets, killing life and {{destroying}} worlds. After three meteos fuse and launch themselves and other meteos into space, the civilizations on other planets plan a counterattack against Meteo. The player travels from planet to planet on the Metamo Ark, a warship made of metean ore. The story has branching paths, with the last level requiring the player to defeat Meteo itself. The Simple mode allowed a quick {{play of the game}} while letting the player change the rules, such as the difficulty and the number of lives they can have. The Deluge mode meanwhile lasts until the player dies. Time War has two goals: getting the high score in a limited time or launching as many meteos as possible from a set number. The game also has a multiplayer mode, where the player <b>can</b> <b>send</b> up to four other players a demo to play against each other with one game cartridge.|$|E

5|$|The game's single-player mode lets players {{control a}} war veteran, Eastern European Niko Bellic. During the story, Niko meets various new {{characters}}, {{many of whom}} he befriends. These characters can then perform favours for Niko whenever he asks; for example, his cousin Roman, who owns a taxi service, <b>can</b> <b>send</b> one of his cabs to Niko and take him to any destination around the city. Cabs are always available during gameplay, allowing players to quickly travel to a destination. Throughout {{the course of the}} game, players are also faced with morality choices, which alter the storyline appropriately depending on the player's choice. While free roaming the game world, players may engage in context-specific activities such as bowling or darts. Other available activities include a vigilante mini-game, and in-game television programming. Niko has a smartphone for contacting friends and starting activities. The smartphone is also used to access the game's online multiplayer mode, and to enter cheat codes. To access the in-game Internet, which allows Niko to send and receive emails and set up prospective dates with potential girlfriends, Niko can use Internet cafés located around the city. The game also features a subway system, allowing players to quickly traverse through the game's world.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Quite often {{algorithms}} {{designed for}} no-collision-detection radio networks use a hidden form of collision detection: {{it is assumed}} that a station <b>can</b> simultaneously <b>send</b> and listen. Then, if it cannot hear its own message, then apparently a collision has occurred. IEEE Standard 802. 11 says that a station <b>can</b> either <b>send</b> or listen to a radio channel, but not both. So we consider a weak radio network model with no collision detection where a station <b>can</b> either <b>send</b> or receive signals. Otherwise we talk about strong model. We show that power of weak and strong radio networks differ substantially in deterministic case. On the other hand, we present an efficient simulation of strong by weak ones, with randomized preprocessing of O(n) steps and O(loglogn) energy cost. ...|$|R
