5|$|<b>Compartment</b> {{syndrome}} is a clinical diagnosis, i.e., no diagnostic test conclusively proves its presence or absence, but direct {{measurement of the}} pressure in a fascial <b>compartment,</b> {{and the difference between}} this pressure and the blood pressure, may be used to assess its severity. High pressures in the <b>compartment</b> and a small difference between <b>compartment</b> pressure and blood pressure indicate that the blood supply is likely to be insufficient, and that surgical intervention may be needed.|$|E
5|$|Sodium is an {{essential}} element for all animals and some plants. Sodium ions are the major cation in the extracellular fluid (ECF) and as such are the major contributor to the ECF osmotic pressure and ECF <b>compartment</b> volume. Loss {{of water from the}} ECF <b>compartment</b> increases the sodium concentration, a condition called hypernatremia. Isotonic loss of water and sodium from the ECF <b>compartment</b> decreases the size of that <b>compartment</b> in a condition called ECF hypovolemia.|$|E
5|$|The {{upper body}} had a baggage <b>compartment</b> {{separating}} the driver's <b>compartment</b> from the crew <b>compartment.</b> Bench {{seats on the}} sides of the vehicle, with under-seat storage, could accommodate six men. The windshield could fold forward and was also removable. A convertible canvas top was mounted at the upper part of the rear body. It fastened to the windshield when erected. Four side pieces could be mounted to protect the crew from the weather.|$|E

50|$|In cross-section, {{the thigh}} is divided up into three {{separate}} fascial <b>compartments</b> divided by fascia, each containing muscles. These <b>compartments</b> use the femur as an axis, and {{are separated by}} tough connective tissue membranes (or septa). Each of these <b>compartments</b> has its own blood and nerve supply, and contains a different group of muscles. These <b>compartments</b> are named the anterior, medial and posterior fascial <b>compartments.</b>|$|R

5|$|<b>Compartment</b> {{syndrome}} is treated with surgery {{to relieve the}} pressure inside the muscle <b>compartment</b> and {{reduce the risk of}} compression on blood vessels and nerves in that area. Fasciotomy is the incision of the affected <b>compartment.</b> Often, multiple incisions are made and left open until the swelling has reduced. At that point, the incisions are closed, often requiring debridement (removal of non-viable tissue) and skin grafting in the process. The need for fasciotomy may be decreased if mannitol is used, as it can relieve muscle swelling directly.|$|E
5|$|Each tissue <b>compartment</b> {{is assumed}} to fully saturate/desaturate in 6 half-times. This means {{desaturation}} of the slowest (120 min) <b>compartment</b> takes 12 hours – hence the 12-hour surface interval before a dive is not considered repetitive with these tables.|$|E
50|$|The typical {{carriage}} in {{this category}} would {{have a set of}} individual <b>compartments</b> seating ten passengers. The main difference between classes was the width of <b>compartments,</b> with exclusively first class carriages fitted with six compartments; composite carriages typically with three first class <b>compartments</b> flanked by two second class <b>compartments</b> either side, and exclusively second class carriages fitted with eight <b>compartments.</b> <b>Compartments</b> contained two bench seats with a central footway connecting to outward-swinging doors either side, which could be locked with a railway-issue square key.|$|R

5|$|PDISs are {{intermediate}} {{stops at}} a depth above the depth at which the leading <b>compartment</b> for the decompression calculation switches from ongassing to offgassing and below {{the depth of the}} first obligatory decompression stop, (or the surface, on a no-decompression dive). The ambient pressure at that depth is low enough to ensure that the tissues are mostly offgassing inert gas, although under a very small pressure gradient. This combination is expected to inhibit bubble growth. The leading <b>compartment</b> is generally not the fastest <b>compartment</b> except in very short dives, for which this model does not require an intermediate stop.|$|E

These compartments represent conceptual tissues and don't represent specific organic tissues. They merely represent the range of possibilities for the organic tissues.

50|$|To {{mitigate}} this hazard, {{cargo vessels}} use multiple smaller bulk <b>compartments</b> or liquid tanks, instead of fewer larger ones, and possibly s within bulk <b>compartments</b> or liquid tanks {{to minimize the}} free surface effects on the craft as a whole. Keeping individual bulk <b>compartments</b> or liquid tanks either relatively empty or full {{is another way to}} minimize the effect and its attendant problems. Hydraulic tankers use water to displace lighter oil to keep the tank full at all times. Tanks or <b>compartments</b> that do not straddle the vessel's centerline are somewhat less prone to destabilising oscillations. Similarly, narrow <b>compartments</b> (aligned bow to stern) and <b>compartments</b> at the extremes away from the centerline, are less prone to cause instability.|$|R

40|$|Compartments(1) in food webs are {{subgroups of}} taxa {{in which many}} strong {{interactions}} occur within the subgroups and few weak interactions occur between the subgroups(2). Theoretically, <b>compartments</b> increase the stability in networks(1 - 5), such as food webs. <b>Compartments</b> {{have been difficult to}} detect in empirical food webs because of incompatible approaches(6 - 9) or insufficient methodological rigour(8, 10, 11). Here we show that a method for detecting <b>compartments</b> from the social networking science(12 - 14) identified significant <b>compartments</b> in three of five complex, empirical food webs. Detection of <b>compartments</b> was influenced by food web resolution, such as interactions with weights. Because the method identifies compartmental boundaries in which interactions are concentrated, it is compatible with the definition of <b>compartments.</b> The method is rigorous because it maximizes an explicit function, identifies the number of non-overlapping <b>compartments,</b> assigns membership to <b>compartments,</b> and tests the statistical significance of the results(12 - 14). A graphical presentation(14) reveals systemic relationships and taxa-specific positions as structured by <b>compartments.</b> From this graphic, we explore two scenarios of disturbance to develop a hypothesis for testing how compartmentalized interactions increase stability in food webs(15 - 17) ...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{studies have}} shown that place cells in the {{hippocampus}} possess firing fields that repeat in physically similar, parallel environments. These results imply that it should be difficult for animals to distinguish parallel environments at a behavioral level. To test this, we trained rats on a novel odor-location task in an environment with four parallel <b>compartments</b> which had previously been shown to yield place field repetition. A second group of animals was trained on the same task, but with the <b>compartments</b> arranged in different directions, an arrangement we hypothesised would yield less place field repetition. Learning of the odor-location task in the parallel <b>compartments</b> was significantly impaired relative to learning in the radially arranged <b>compartments.</b> Fewer animals acquired the full discrimination in the parallel <b>compartments</b> compared to those trained in the radial <b>compartments,</b> and the former also required many more sessions to reach criterion compared to the latter. To confirm that the arrangement of <b>compartments</b> yielded differences in place cell repetition, in a separate group of animals we recorded from CA 1 place cells in both environments. We found that CA 1 place cells exhibited repeated fields across four parallel local <b>compartments,</b> but did not do so when the same <b>compartments</b> were arranged radially. To confirm that the differences in place field repetition across the parallel and radial <b>compartments</b> depended on their angular arrangement, and not incidental differences in access to an extra-maze visual landmark, we repeated the recordings in a second set of rats {{in the absence of the}} orientation landmark. We found, once again, that place fields showed repetition in parallel <b>compartments,</b> and did not do so in radially arranged <b>compartments.</b> Thus place field repetition, or lack thereof, in these <b>compartments</b> was not dependent on extra-maze cues. Together, these results imply that place field repetition constrains spatial learning. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc...|$|R
