5|$|Many {{cases of}} <b>croup</b> are {{preventable}} by immunization for influenza and diphtheria. <b>Croup</b> is usually {{treated with a}} single dose of steroids by mouth. In more severe cases inhaled epinephrine may also be used. Hospitalization is required in one to five percent of cases.|$|E

5|$|<b>Croup</b> can {{be caused}} by a number of viruses {{including}} parainfluenza and influenza virus. Rarely is it due to a bacterial infection. <b>Croup</b> is typically diagnosed based on signs and symptoms after potentially more severe causes, such as epiglottitis or an airway foreign body, have been ruled out. Further investigations—such as blood tests, X-rays, and cultures—are usually not needed.|$|E

5|$|<b>Croup</b> {{is usually}} {{deemed to be}} due to a viral infection. Others use the term more broadly, to include acute laryngotracheitis, spasmodic <b>croup,</b> {{laryngeal}} diphtheria, bacterial tracheitis, laryngotracheobronchitis, and laryngotracheobronchopneumonitis. The first two conditions involve a viral infection and are generally milder with respect to symptomatology; the last four are due to bacterial infection and are usually of greater severity.|$|E
5|$|Moderate {{to severe}} <b>croup</b> may be {{improved}} temporarily with nebulized epinephrine. While epinephrine typically produces {{a reduction in}} <b>croup</b> severity within 10–30 minutes, the benefits last for only about 2 hours. If the condition remains improved for 2–4hours after treatment and no other complications arise, the child is typically discharged from the hospital.|$|E

5|$|<b>Croup</b> is a {{relatively}} common condition that affects about 15% of children at some point. It most commonly occurs between 6 months and 5 years of age but may rarely be seen in children as old as fifteen. It is slightly more common in males than females. It occurs most often in autumn. Before vaccination, <b>croup</b> was frequently caused by diphtheria and was often fatal. This cause is now very rare in the Western world due {{to the success of}} the diphtheria vaccine.|$|E
5|$|<b>Croup</b> is {{typically}} diagnosed based on signs and symptoms. The {{first step is}} to exclude other obstructive conditions of the upper airway, especially epiglottitis, an airway foreign body, subglottic stenosis, angioedema, retropharyngeal abscess, and bacterial tracheitis.|$|E
5|$|The viral {{infection}} that causes <b>croup</b> leads to {{swelling of the}} larynx, trachea, and large bronchi due to infiltration of white blood cells (especially histiocytes, lymphocytes, plasma cells, and neutrophils). Swelling produces airway obstruction which, when significant, leads to dramatically increased work of breathing and the characteristic turbulent, noisy airflow known as stridor.|$|E

5|$|These viruses {{are only}} distantly {{related to the}} human parainfluenza viruses, which are RNA viruses {{belonging}} to the paramyxovirus family that are a common cause of respiratory infections in children such as <b>croup,</b> but can also cause a disease similar to influenza in adults.|$|E
5|$|<b>Croup</b> affects about 15% of children, {{and usually}} {{presents}} {{between the ages}} of 6 months and 5–6 years. It accounts for about 5% of hospital admissions in this population.

5|$|Secretariat's {{absence of}} major {{conformation}} flaws was important, as horses with well made limbs and feet {{are less likely}} to become injured. Secretariat's hindquarters were the main source of his power, with a sloped <b>croup</b> that extended the length of his femur. When in full stride, his hind legs were able to reach far under himself, increasing his drive. His ample girth, long back and well-made neck all contributed to his heart-lung efficiency.|$|E

When they reached Plainton, Mrs. Cliff began to be afraid that he would gallop through the streets, and she told Willy that if he did, she must not scream, but must sit quietly, and she would endeavor to steer him clear of the vehicles and people.|$|R
60|$|The great {{object of}} Willy <b>Croup's</b> {{thoughts}} {{at this time}} was not the park,--for she could not properly appreciate trees and grass in this shivery weather,--but the entertainment, the grand lunch, or the very high tea {{which was to be}} given to Mrs. Buskirk and daughters on the hill. This important event had been postponed because the sleighing had become rather bad and the Buskirks had gone to the city.|$|R

The points given for each factor is listed in the adjacent table, and the final score ranges from 0 to 17.|$|E
5|$|The Charolais breed was small, {{and most}} closely {{physically}} resembled the Morvan horse, another now-extinct French type. The breed {{had a short}} head with small ears and a short, strong neck attached low on the shoulder. The body was short and rounded, with a broad <b>croup</b> and strong legs. They were {{generally considered to be}} small and inelegant. They were strong, robust and hardy, the last of these traits especially so before the breeding changes of the 19th century, and were known for their pulling power.|$|E
5|$|The head is well-proportioned {{and similar}} to that of the Selle Francais, with wide nostrils, small ears and a {{straight}} or convex facial profile. The neck is thick, muscular and arched. The mane is sometimes roached. The shoulders are broad and angled, the chest deep and the withers pronounced. The body is compact and stocky, with a short, strong back. The hindquarters are powerful, although not so much as in heavy draft breeds, and the <b>croup</b> muscular and sloping. The legs are short, muscular and strong, with thick bone, but less massive than most draft breeds. The feet are round, wide and solid.|$|E

50|$|The Pleven's {{head has}} a {{straight}} profile, a long, muscular neck, {{and a nice}} topline. They are excellent movers, whose free-flowing gaits make them excel in dressage. They have fairly long backs and high withers, with quarters that are muscular, <b>croups</b> which are slightly sloping, and a tail that is carried well. Their legs are well-conformed and muscular, have good bone joints, well-defined tendons, and hard feet. Their temperament is calm and willing. The Pleven is usually sound, tough, and economical to feed.|$|R
50|$|The Basuto is {{considered}} a small horse, since it possesses horse-like characteristics, such as an exceptionally long stride. Basutos have rather heavy heads, long necks and long, straight backs, straight shoulders, and muscular, sloping <b>croups.</b> They have very tough legs and sound, very hard hooves. They can be up to 14.2 hands high (56.8 inches or ~142 cm), but rarely taller. Basutos can be chestnut, brown, bay, gray or black, and have white markings. They are usually sure-footed, fast, fearless and {{are known for their}} stamina.|$|R
5|$|All colors {{other than}} Appaloosa are allowed for registration. Welara Sport Ponies {{may be of}} any color or size, without the {{restrictions}} of the purebred Welara. The mix of Arabian and Welsh blood gives the breed refinement, spirit and hardiness, as well as good movement. The head is small and slightly , the neck is arched (and prone to be cresty in stallions). The shoulders and <b>croup</b> are long and the back short. Welaras are used mainly in English riding, especially in hunter classes. They are also seen in show jumping, three-day eventing, pleasure driving and as general leisure riding horses. Welara/Thoroughbred crosses are popular mounts for riders competing in hunter and jumper classes.|$|E
5|$|Andalusian {{horses are}} elegant and {{strongly}} built. Members of the breed have heads of medium length, {{with a straight}} or slightly convex profile. Ultra convex and concave profiles are discouraged in the breed, and are penalized in breed shows. Necks are long and broad, running to well-defined withers and a massive chest. They have a short back and broad, strong hindquarters with a well-rounded <b>croup.</b> The breed tends to have clean legs, with no propensity for blemishes or injuries, and energetic gaits. The mane and tail are thick and long, but the legs do not have excess feathering. Andalusians tend to be docile, while remaining intelligent and sensitive. When treated with respect they are quick to learn, responsive, and cooperative.|$|E
5|$|The Canadian horse has {{a rather}} short, high-set {{head with a}} broad forehead. The neck is arched and graceful, and the chest, back and loins broad and {{strongly}} muscled. The shoulders and <b>croup</b> are sloping, with a relatively high-set tail. Overall, the breed gives the impression of strength and agility. Their heavy and wavy mane and tail, arched necks and finely boned heads are all reminiscent of Andalusian and Barb ancestry. Their trot is described as flashy. They are hardy horses and easy keepers. Today, most Canadian horses are used as riding and driving horses, and {{are known for their}} jumping ability. They are seen in competition in almost every discipline, as well as for leisure riding. They can also be found in light draft work, trail riding, and working as a stock horse.|$|E
5000|$|Mr. Vandemar (Clive Russell) - Dull-witted, tall, and gangly, Vandemar is <b>Croup's</b> polar opposite. He {{does not}} speak much, and when he does, his {{statements}} are often laconic and blunt. He is quite brutish and seems to enjoy nothing more than killing and destroying things (even practising his golf swing with live toads). He also {{has a tendency to}} eat live animals. The descriptive imagery likens him to a hound or a wolf, and he even howls at one point when catching up with his mark.|$|R
