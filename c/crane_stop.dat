50|$|The {{reservoir}} is {{of international}} importance {{as a result}} of the variety of birds found on and around its waters, which, in terms of species as well as sheer numbers exceeds those settling on comparable stretches of water. For example, the following birds can regularly be observed here: duck (e.g. mallard, teal, pochard), waders (peewit, snipe, redshank, curlew), divers (great crested grebe, little grebe, black-necked grebe), rails (water rail, coot), mute swan, black-headed gull and bittern (little bittern and Eurasian bittern). In addition white-tailed eagle, osprey, peregrine and cormorant may also be spotted here. The variety of birds occurring during migration is particularly impressive. Up to 10,000 <b>crane</b> <b>stop</b> over on the reservoir and large flocks of larks and finches may be seen passing through. Since 1978 the reservoirs has been placed under the protection of the Ramsar Convention as an internationally important retreat for birds.|$|E
40|$|This master {{thesis is}} about {{modeling}} {{and control of}} crane placed on an offshore vessel. An active heave compensating crane, designed by MacGregor, {{has been used as}} a basis for developing the crane model. Cranes of this type are placed on a wide variety of vessels and operate all over the world. Besides MacGregor, several other well reputated crane suppliers design similar cranes. In addition, two inverse kinematics control algorithms and three input shapers have been described, implemented and tested in Simulink. The model of the MacGregor crane was developed mathematically using robot modeling theory. The resulting model was implemented in Simulink and verified both mathematically and against a SimMechanics model. In addition, a cable model and vessel crane interaction were added to the Simulink model. The total Simulink model responded according to expectations during simulations. Two inverse kinematics algorithms were implemented and tested. Both had vessel kinematics incorporated. As a result, these two algorithms enabled the crane to counteract the vessel motion. This control method is also of interest to operators. It enables the them to control the crane in the workspace, instead of in the joint space. Simulations show that the two inverse kinematics algorithms were able to keep the crane tip at a fixed point in an earth fixed reference frame. However, in sea state 6 the vessel motion was fluctuating to fast, making the crane unable to keep the crane tip at a fixed point. The input shaping control algorithm shapes the control input given from the operator in a manner that makes the <b>crane</b> <b>stop</b> at any point with reduced payload swing. The effect of increasing the robustness of the shaper was checked using three different shapers. Simulations showed that the input shapers were able to reduce the residual vibration. For a 5 meter long cable, the zero vibration shaper reduced the residual vibration from 1 meter to approximately 20 cm, whereas the zero vibration derivative shaper reduced the vibration to about 5 cm. The zero vibration derivative derivative shaper was able to reduce the vibration to about 2. 5 cm.  </p...|$|E

On October 29, 1971, while the band was on a break from touring and recording, Allman was riding his Harley-Davidson Sportster motorcycle at high speed on Hillcrest Avenue, {{in the western part of}} Macon. As he approached Bartlett Street, a flatbed truck carrying a lumber <b>crane</b> <b>stopped</b> suddenly in the intersection, forcing him to swerve sharply. He struck either the back of the truck or the ball on the lumber crane and was thrown from the motorcycle, which landed on top of him and skidded another 90 feet with him pinned underneath it, crushing his internal organs.

Once the button is released the <b>crane</b> <b>stops</b> moving and the button cannot be used again, thus requiring the user to judge depth accurately in one attempt.

40|$|Birds are {{altering}} the phenology of critical life history events, including migration, {{in response to}} the effects of global climate change. Whooping Cranes (Grus americana) {{are one of the most}} critically endangered birds in the world. Their remnant population, referred to as the Aransas-Wood Buffalo Population, numbers between 300 - 400 individuals and migrates between the U. S. Gulf of Mexico coast and north-central Canada twice each year. Previous analyses suggested Whooping Crane migration was temporally constant in spring and fall. New analyses of observations spanning 1942 - 2016 show Whooping Crane migration is now occurring earlier in spring by approximately 22 days and later in fall by approximately 21 days. Spring temperatures have also increased in the migration corridor during the same period; however, there is no apparent temperature pattern during the fall. In spring, earlier migrating Whooping <b>Cranes</b> <b>stopped</b> over for longer periods of time compared to late-migrating cranes. This result may be partially explained by single Whooping Cranes migrating with earlier migrating Sandhill Cranes (Antigone canadensis). These results have important conservation implications as the timing of Whooping Crane migration and availability of the habitat and foraging resources, including those associated with agriculture, on which this species relies will be increasingly affected by climate change...|$|R
40|$|Little {{information}} {{exists on}} the spring migratory habits and breeding distribution of lesser sandhill cranes (Grus canadensis canadensis) that winter in west-central New Mexico and southeastern Arizona. To address this question, we captured and attached a total of 6 Platform Transmitting Terminals (PTT) to adult lesser sandhill cranes at 2 sites each in west-central New Mexico and southeastern Arizona during December 2001 and monitored the birds’ movements to arrival on their arctic breeding grounds. After departing from their wintering grounds, 2 of the <b>cranes</b> <b>stopped</b> at Monte Vista NWR in south-central Colorado where they stayed for 17 and 23 days. All 6 cranes migrated to Nebraska, where 5 stopped in the North Platte River Valley (2 near Lewellen and 3 near Hershey) and 1 in the Central Platte River Valley near Kearney (mean length of stay = 24. 5 days, range 8. 5 – 33). The migration pathways taken to Nebraska by the 6 cranes were, on average, 1, 192 km farther than direct flight distances from wintering to breeding grounds. Four cranes were present on the surveyed sites in Nebraska on 26 March, when the U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service conducted their 2002 crane population census; the 2 <b>cranes</b> that <b>stopped</b> at the Monte Vista National Wildlife Refuge did not arrive in Nebraska until about 4 April. From Nebraska, all 6 cranes migrated to western Saskatchewan; 3 later moved to sites in eastern Alberta (mean length of stay in Saskatchewan/Alberta = 21 days, range 12. 7 – 28. 0). From Saskatchewan and Alberta, the cranes flew, with a few brief intervening stops, to breeding grounds located on the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta in western Alaska (n = 2) and the Chukotka Penninsula, Chaun Delta, and Anadyr Delta in northeastern Siberia (n = 4). Use of the Central Platte or North Platte River valleys by all 6 cranes was unexpected given the major increase in flight distance required and reflects the exceptional attachment to Nebraska staging areas by the mid-continent population of sandhill cranes. Spring migration routes, staging locations, and breeding distributions of these 6 cranes suggest that lesser sandhill cranes wintering in west-central New Mexico and in southeastern Arizona are affiliated with the Western Alaska/Siberia subpopulation...|$|R

Berkeley City Councilman Kenneth W.

In 1998, Jan Kreutz, leader of a group critical of Hoskins, sought to remove him from his position as mayor. Kreutz twice gathered signatures in petitions to have an election which would remove Hoskins from office, but both times the Berkeley city clerk refused to certify the petitions. Kreutz's organization of citizens sued, and in March 1998 a circuit court ordered a recall election. Hoskins faced a court-ordered recall election, and he sought to appeal the election process. On March 17, 1998, a judge of the Missouri Court of Appeals denied a motion to expedite Hoskins' appeal of the court order mandating a recall election.

40|$|About 200, 000 common cranes (Grus grus) from northern, middle, and northeastern {{parts of}} Europe are {{migrating}} on the West-European route. In the northeast part of Germany 160, 000 <b>cranes</b> <b>stop</b> over simultaneously during migration. This number has increased {{since the early}} 1980 ´s by 3 -fold. About 60 sites with from 200 to 50, 000 cranes are systematically observed from August to December by local expert groups. The overnight roosts are in ponds, swamps, and lakes, actively flooded meadows, and brown coal mines {{as well as in}} shallow backwaters of the Baltic Sea. They have been used year after year. More than 80 % of the roosts are protected. Pre-assembly stop-overs are located in small wetlands which the cranes use before finally entering the roost at late dusk. These areas also need to be protected. Daily movements are 8 - 15 km but reach a maximum of 25 km from the roost sites. To minimize damage to agriculture, “diversion feedings” or lure crops were established at 6 places in 2004, paid for by government and private organizations. Problems can be further reduced by combining these tactics with leaving stubble-fields, early new sowing, and actively harassing cranes before they land. Guiding nature tourists with posted information occurs at 17 sites. The sites are used by thousands of people and are often led by rangers. Special societies are founded at several larger resting sites with about 60 members (20 - 250) on average. Problems often arise, especially with hunters, farmers, and holiday makers. To keep the level of disturbances low, the nature conservation, agriculture, hunting, and tourism agencies need to cooperate and develop a local crane management plan that would consider the interests of all parties. Scientific work is done at several large roost areas by institutions and members of the German Crane Working Group. This includes the yearly monitoring of breeding and roosting areas and the ringing (banding) and radio-tracking programs...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{relation}} between the local numbers and distribution of autumn staging Eurasian Cranes (Grus grus Linn.) and agricultural land use during recent decades in Estonia. The analysis is based on the long-term monitoring data of staging cranes and the statistical data of land use in Estonia. We found that great changes in cropping area, as well as in crane numbers have taken place in Estonia since the 1960 s. We also found a significant positive correlation between crane numbers and the cropping area of summer wheat, winter wheat, winter rye and all cereals together, and a negative correlation with the area of potatoes. Generally, arable land, particularly that used for growing cereals, has a great influence on the local numbers and distribution of staging cranes. Based on our findings, we predict that changes in the local numbers and distribution of Eurasian Cranes staging during their migration in Estonia and elsewhere will depend on changes in agricultural land use in staging areas, rather than {{on the size of the}} breeding population.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with defining and solving the supply vessel weather routing problem. The particular problem in focus will be Statoil's supply circuit in the middle North Sea, including the Johan Sverdrup oil field. The thesis considers a single platform supply vessel doing a single trip to supply a given number of platforms. The goal {{is to find the}} cost optimal route. The approach will use standard weather forecasts and ship resistance models to calculate the cost for each candidate route. The supplying of offshore installations are done with platform supply vessels. Today, these PSVs follow a weekly schedule in order to supply the installations and do not automatically account for severe weather. This can cause unwanted delays, extra vessel days, and in worst case installations shutting down production due to lack of supplies. The main objective of this master thesis is to explore the topic of weather routing for supply vessels. The approach is to develop and document a 'proof-of-concept' MATLAB program, attempting to solve the supply vessel weather routing problem. The core part of the program is the cost function, which can be tow energy, brake energy, fuel consumption, CO 2 -emissions or operational costs for the supply vessel. This function is subject to be minimised in order to find the cost optimal route. Some restrictions apply: Crane operations on rigs are subject to wave height limitations, typically 4 meters. <b>Crane</b> <b>stops</b> due to severe weather and nightly close-downs (of crane operations) introduce dynamic time windows. The only routing done is changing the order in which the installations are visited, and each unique sequence is a candidate route. Every installation is to be visited once, each for a specified duration of time - a service time. The fleet size and mix vessel routing problem is assumed to be solved, so that a single vessel, single voyage needs to be optimised. It is assumed that the total demand does not exceed the vessel capacity, and that the supply allocation problem is solved. The speed between installations is governed by a reduced speed algorithm or a constant speed algorithm. The speed is reduced due to environmental loads, by keeping the propulsion power constant. The results deem weather routing to be possible and feasible. For small waves (less than three meter significant wave height) the typical savings are < 5 %, which is not significant due to model- and forecast uncertainties. For borderline weather and complex time windows, savings has been observed in the 20 %-range - by just changing the order of visiting installation. The field of short sea weather routing is ripe for more research. Routing of wellboats and windmill service vessels, and life cycle simulations of supply vessels for future designs are other applications available through the presented program...|$|R

40|$|Despite the {{continuous}} evolution in computers and information technology, real-world combinatorial optimization problems are NP-problems, {{in particular in}} the domain of planning and scheduling. Thus, although exact techniques from the Operations Research (OR) field, such as Linear Programming, could be applied to solve optimization problems, they are difficult to apply in real-world scenarios since they usually require too much computational time, i. e: an optimized solution is required at an affordable computational time. Furthermore, decision makers often face different and typically opposing goals, then resulting multi-objective optimization problems. Therefore, approximate techniques from the Artificial Intelligence (AI) field are commonly used to solve the real world problems. The AI techniques provide richer and more flexible representations of real-world (Gomes 2000), and they are widely used to solve these type of problems. AI heuristic techniques do not guarantee the optimal solution, but they provide near-optimal solutions in a reasonable time. These techniques are divided into two broad classes of algorithms: constructive and local search methods (Aarts and Lenstra 2003). They can guide their search processes by means of heuristics or metaheuristics depending on how they escape from local optima (Blum and Roli 2003). Regarding multi-objective optimization problems, the use of AI techniques becomes paramount due to their complexity (Coello Coello 2006). Nowadays, the point of view for planning and scheduling tasks has changed. Due to the fact that real world is uncertain, imprecise and non-deterministic, there might be unknown information, breakdowns, incidences or changes, which become the initial plans or schedules invalid. Thus, there is a new trend to cope these aspects in the optimization techniques, and to seek robust solutions (schedules) (Lambrechts, Demeulemeester, and Herroelen 2008). In this way, these optimization problems become harder since a new objective function (robustness measure) {{must be taken into account}} during the solution search. Therefore, the robustness concept is being studied and a general robustness measure has been developed for any scheduling problem (such as Job Shop Problem, Open Shop Problem, Railway Scheduling or Vehicle Routing Problem). To this end, in this thesis, some techniques have been developed to improve the search of optimized and robust solutions in planning and scheduling problems. These techniques offer assistance to decision makers to help in planning and scheduling tasks, determine the consequences of changes, provide support in the resolution of incidents, provide alternative plans, etc. As a case study to evaluate the behaviour of the techniques developed, this thesis focuses on problems related to container terminals. Container terminals generally serve as a transshipment zone between ships and land vehicles (trains or trucks). In (Henesey 2006 a), it is shown how this transshipment market has grown rapidly. Container terminals are open systems with three distinguishable areas: the berth area, the storage yard, and the terminal receipt and delivery gate area. Each one presents different planning and scheduling problems to be optimized (Stahlbock and Voß 2008). For example, berth allocation, quay crane assignment, stowage planning, and quay crane scheduling must be managed in the berthing area; the container stacking problem, yard crane scheduling, and horizontal transport operations must be carried out in the yard area; and the hinterland operations must be solved in the landside area. Furthermore, dynamism is also present in container terminals. The tasks of the container terminals take place in an environment susceptible of breakdowns or incidences. For instance, a Quay <b>Crane</b> engine <b>stopped</b> working and needs to be revised, delaying this task one or two hours. Thereby, the robustness concept can be included in the scheduling techniques to take into consideration some incidences and return a set of robust schedules. In this thesis, we have developed a new domain-dependent planner to obtain more effi- cient solutions in the generic problem of reshuffles of containers. Planning heuristics and optimization criteria developed have been evaluated on realistic problems and they are applicable to the general problem of reshuffling in blocks world scenarios. Additionally, we have developed a scheduling model, using constructive metaheuristic techniques on a complex problem that combines sequences of scenarios with different types of resources (Berth Allocation, Quay Crane Assignment, and Container Stacking problems). These problems are usually solved separately and their integration allows more optimized solutions. Moreover, in order to address the impact and changes that arise in dynamic real-world environments, a robustness model has been developed for scheduling tasks. This model has been applied to metaheuristic schemes, which are based on genetic algorithms. The extension of such schemes, incorporating the robustness model developed, allows us to evaluate and obtain more robust solutions. This approach, combined with the classical optimality criterion in scheduling problems, allows us to obtain, in an efficient in way, optimized solution able to withstand a greater degree of incidents that occur in dynamic scenarios. Thus, a proactive approach is applied to the problem that arises with the presence of incidences and changes that occur in typical scheduling problems of a dynamic real world. Rodríguez Molins, M.
