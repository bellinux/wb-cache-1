50|$|Usually, when yarn is cut, {{the ends}} fray {{similar to the}} way the ends of a braid or rope would fray when they are cut and a kind of a brush forms. This fraying must be avoided in {{cut-pile}} carpets by all means. A <b>cut</b> <b>pile</b> <b>carpet</b> with frayed yarn ends would have a poor appearance, a shorter life cycle and ergonomic disadvantages for the “walker” as scientific research has proven. The carpet is less elastic and doesn’t absorb the steps of the user as well as a heat set carpet would. A carpet manufactured from heat set yarn is more attractive, durable and comfortable for the user. The added value of heatset carpet is significant. Normally a heat set carpet can be identified by its grainy structure, which is called “pinpoint tip definition” in the industry. The appearance of the cut pile ends is similar to pin points.|$|E
50|$|People {{restoring}} classic {{cars will}} often freshen up the interior by putting in new carpet to cover new floor pans. When they do replace the carpet {{in their cars}} they have quite a few options in molded carpet. There are several websites that specialize in molded carpets. There are several styles of molded carpet, the most popular include 80-20 loop, cutpile and essex. Most cars from the 1940s to the mid-1970s used 80-20 loop carpet. The major exception being Cadillac which used cut pile in their cars at various times. After 1974 car makers used cut pile or essex carpet exclusively. 80-20 loop which is 80% rayon 20% nylon thus the name. It has a texture similar to berber house carpet. Cut pile is {{what you see in}} modern cars. It looks like little strands of hair. Essex is a longer more plush version of <b>cut</b> <b>pile</b> <b>carpet.</b> It's softer to the touch than cut pile and 80-20 loop, but is also more expensive than the other two.|$|E
40|$|Research was {{conducted}} in an experimental room to measure the effect of human activity on airborne dispersal of settled fungal spores from carpet and vinyl tile flooring. A series of experiments were conducted in which commercial loop pile carpet, residential <b>cut</b> <b>pile</b> <b>carpet,</b> or vinyl tile installed in the experimental room were contaminated with Penicillium chrysogenum spores. The flooring materials were contaminated to two different levels (106 and 107 colony forming units per square meter [c. f. u. /m 2] of flooring surface). Airborne culturable and total P. chrysogenum concentrations were measured using Andersen single-stage impactor samplers and Burkard personal slide impactor samplers, respectively. Bioaerosol concentrations were measured at floor level, 1 meter, and the adult breathing zone (1. 5 meter) heights before and after human activity consisting of walking in a prescribed pattern for 1 minute in the room. Airborne P. chrysogenum concentrations were greater with the higher surface loading for all three flooring materials. For all flooring materials {{there was no significant}} difference between sampler locations, although the data from the 1 -meter location were the highest, followed by the floor level and the breathing zone locations, respectively. The data from these experiments indicate that while a very small fraction of culturable P. chrysogenum spores present on flooring materials were aerosolized by walking, relatively high airborne concentrations of spores maybe re-entrained from contaminated materials. The airborne P. chrysogenum concentrations were significantly higher after walking on <b>cut</b> <b>pile</b> <b>carpet</b> than with the other two flooring materials at both contamination levels, with the differences in concentration often ≥ 2 orders of magnitude. No differences were measured in airborne culturable P. chrysogenum between vinyl flooring and loop pile carpet at both contamination levels. Total spore data from the experiments with the 107 c. f. u. /m 2 contamination level indicated that walking on loop pile carpet produced higher airborne spore concentrations than similarly contaminated vinyl tile although no significant difference was observed at the 106 c. f. u. /m 2 level...|$|E
50|$|Carpet {{styles are}} divided into two basic types. These types are loop <b>pile</b> <b>carpets</b> and <b>cut</b> <b>pile</b> <b>carpets.</b> Especially for {{cut-pile}} and its variations (Saxony, shag, frieze) the heat setting process is of highest importance.|$|R
50|$|The {{quality of}} <b>cut</b> <b>pile</b> <b>carpets</b> is {{improved}} significantly by {{a reduction of}} inner tensions in the yarn. This essential benefit results {{from the effects of}} steaming and heatsetting.|$|R
50|$|The SE model {{featured}} <b>cut</b> <b>pile</b> <b>carpets,</b> a tachometer, overhead reading lamps, door step lamps, rear footwell lamps, four-speaker AM/FM/MPX stereo radio/cassette system, remote {{boot and}} fuel cap releases, adjustable lumbar support and tilt {{for the driver}} seat, and tinted side windows.|$|R
25|$|The SJ {{hatchback}} and SJ Safari wagon models feature soft nylon upholstery, <b>cut</b> <b>pile</b> <b>carpeting,</b> padded {{and cloth}} covered door panels, and a fabric headliner, plus rally instruments, the higher-output two barrel engine, four-speed or automatic (over a three-speed manual) gearbox and radial tires. A GT package {{option for the}} hatchback and Safari wagon combined the lower-line interior with the SJ's performance and handling features.|$|R
50|$|Trim {{levels were}} standard, Deluxe and XE, while price range were between US$4,949 for the base two-door sedan up to US$6,899 for the two-door XE {{hatchback}} coupe. Standard equipment on all models were four-wheel independent suspension, front disc brakes and rear drums, {{rack and pinion}} steering, maintenance free battery, rear ashtray and bucket seats. Deluxe models added halogen headlamps, remote-locking gas filler door, carpeted trunk and rear wiper-washer on the wagon. Deluxe and XE offered tinted glass, trip odometer, vanity mirror, dual remote mirrors and door trim. XE offered <b>cut</b> <b>pile</b> <b>carpeting,</b> analogue quartz clock, remote rear window opener, low-fuel warning light, AM-FM Clarion stereo radio, power steering, tachometer and 155/13 whitewall radial tires. Sunroof was available as an option.|$|R
50|$|Eleven Murena sports wagons with Ford 429 Hi Performance engines were built. These luxury {{packages}} (four leather seats, bars with <b>cut</b> glass, deep <b>pile</b> <b>carpets,</b> aircraft switches etc.) were built, {{again as}} running cars, for an importer in New York. The Murenas {{were a great}} hit with the entertainment group in California.|$|R
50|$|The term frieze {{can also}} be used for the curly nap frieze fabrics have, as well as the action of raising the nap, which differs from {{standard}} methods. Today, frieze is also a term applied to a textile technique used in modern machine-loomed carpeting, as well as the textile produced. Carpets made with this technique are known for their resilience, due to a high twist rate, outperforming standard <b>cut</b> or loop <b>pile</b> <b>carpets.</b>|$|R
2500|$|The Ninety-Eight was restyled for 1980, {{along with}} the Delta 88. That year, it gained a new 307 cid (5.0 L) V8 as an option. The 403 was dropped completely. The 1980 models {{received}} new exterior sheet metal, without drastically changing {{the look of the}} car. To improve aerodynamics and fuel economy the hood was sloped downward, while the trunk area was higher. This also gave all models a heavier, more substantial appearance, while even slightly increasing interior and trunk space. 1981 saw the introduction of Buick's 252in³ V6 as standard, as well as a new 4-speed THM200-4R automatic transmission. The gas 350 engine was dropped that same year, completely replaced by the smaller 307. The new Regency Brougham model was introduced for 1982. This car featured plush [...] "Prima" [...] velour seats with embroidered emblems, <b>cut</b> <b>pile</b> <b>carpeting,</b> and electroluminescent opera lamps on the B-pillars. [...] Regency became the new 'base' model as the LS was discontinued. A redesigned steering wheel and slightly revised instrument panel were also new that year. The 1983 models received a new grille, but were otherwise unchanged. The federal [...] impact standard was rolled back for 1984, prompting GM to make major changes to the bumpers to save weight; predictably, this drastically reduced their effectiveness. An optional 8-track tape player and the 4.1 L V6 were no longer available, though the CB radio was still optional.|$|R
50|$|The {{carpet of}} the Oval Office bears the Seal of the President. President Harry S. Truman's oval carpet {{was the first}} to {{incorporate}} the presidential seal. In Truman's carpet, the seal was represented monochromatically through varying depths of the <b>cut</b> <b>pile.</b> His <b>carpet</b> was used in the Eisenhower and Kennedy administrations. In recent years most administrations have created their own rug, working with an interior designer and the Curator of the White House. As part of her overall restoration of the White House, Jacqueline Kennedy had a redecoration of the Oval Office begun on November 21, 1963, when she accompanied President John F. Kennedy on a trip to Texas. The next day, November 22, a new carpet was installed just as the Kennedys were making their way through Dallas and the President was assassinated.|$|R
25|$|The carpet is {{produced}} on a loom {{quite similar to}} woven fabric. The pile can be plush or Berber. Plush <b>carpet</b> is a <b>cut</b> <b>pile</b> and Berber <b>carpet</b> is a loop pile. There are new styles of carpet combining the two styles called cut and loop carpeting. Normally many colored yarns are used and this process is capable of producing intricate patterns from predetermined designs (although some limitations apply to certain weaving methods with regard to accuracy of pattern within the carpet). These carpets are usually the most expensive due to the relatively slow speed of the manufacturing process. These are very famous in Iran, India, Pakistan and Arabia.|$|R

50|$|Moquette {{originated}} in France, {{where it was}} woven by hand. The standard width was a Flemish ell of 27 inches. There were two finishes: moquette velouté, which had a <b>cut</b> <b>pile</b> like English Wilton, and moquette bouclé, which had an uncut <b>pile</b> like Brussels <b>carpet.</b> It is still woven in Yorkshire using traditional techniques.

2500|$|The knotted <b>pile</b> <b>carpet</b> {{probably}} {{originated in}} the 3rd or 2nd millennium BC in West Asia, perhaps the Caspian Sea area (Northern Iran) [...] or the Armenian Highland, although {{there is evidence of}} goats and sheep being sheared for wool and hair which was spun and woven as far back at the 7th millennium. The earliest surviving <b>pile</b> <b>carpet</b> is the [...] "Pazyryk carpet", which dates from the 5th-4th century BC. It was excavated by Sergei Ivanovich Rudenko in 1949 from a Pazyryk burial mound in the Altai Mountains in Siberia.

2500|$|Machine-woven carpets like Axminster and Wilton {{are made}} by massive looms that weave {{together}} ‘bobbins’ of carpet yarn and backing. The finished result, which can be intricately patterned, creates a floor that provides supreme underfoot luxury with high performance. Tufted carpets are also popular in the home. They are relatively speedy to make - a pre-woven backing has yarns tufted into it. Needles push the yarn through the backing and which is then held in place with underlying [...] "loopers". Tufted carpets can be twist pile, velvet, or loop <b>pile.</b> Twist <b>pile</b> <b>carpets</b> are produced when one or more fibres are twisted in the tufting process, {{so that in the}} finished carpet they appear to be bound together. Velvet <b>pile</b> <b>carpets</b> tend to have a shorter pile and a tighter construction, giving the finished article a smooth, velvety appearance. Loop <b>pile</b> <b>carpets</b> are renowned for being hard wearing and lend carpets great texture. The traditional domain of rugs from far away continents, hand knotted squares and rugs use the expertise of weavers to produce work of the finest quality. Traditional rugs often feature a deliberate ‘mistake’ on behalf of the weaver to guarantee their authenticity.|$|R
