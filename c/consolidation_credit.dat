40|$|The author models {{the choice}} between credit cards and home equity lines of credit (HELOCs) within a {{framework}} where consumers hold lines of credit as instruments of consumption smoothing across state and time. Flexible repayment schemes for lines of credit induce risk-averse consumers with sufficiently high discount rates to underinsure and hold lines of credit instead as a buffer, even when {{they have access to}} full and fair insurance markets. Weighing the fixed upfront fees and higher default costs of HELOCs against the advantages of low and income-tax-deductible interest payments, the author finds a threshold level of potential borrowing belowwhich consumers prefer to use credit cards exclusively. Above that threshold, consumers decide touse HELOCs and consolidate all outstanding credit card debt into them; however, a rising probability of default and the resulting loss of equity in the home will put an upper bound on the potential HELOC borrowing that will prevent full debt <b>consolidation.</b> <b>Credit</b> and credit aggregates...|$|E
40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{bachelor}} {{thesis is}} to compare the conditions of consolidation of loans and credits by three banks of my choice in the Czech Republic and then to choose the best offer for the potential clients. The introduction deals with the deficit status of households. Afterwards I have provided the explanation of the following words: <b>consolidation,</b> <b>credit</b> and loan. After explaining all the words comes {{the characteristics of the}} loans and credits. The last part of the theoretical part deals with insolvency law. The practical part deals with the evaluation of household indebtedness from 2005 through 2015. The entire finance position of the household sector in 2014 is assessed as well as the literacy of the inhabitants in the Czech Republic. Services of the consolidation by Česká spořitelna, a. s., GE Money bank, a. s., a Československá obchodní banka, a. s are also compared. These three banks were chosen on the grounds of a well arranged offer of the products, regarding issues of unification of the loans and credits.

The results also show that despite the onesided positive causality from credit supply to economic growth, the total contribution of the consolidated credit growth to real activity was not significant. The paper, therefore, recommends that in order to improve the credit channel of monetary policy transmission, policy makers should take into account how the banks react to such policies...|$|R

40|$|TERRITORIAL ASPECTS OF THE BANK/FIRM RELATIONSHIP IN SOUTHERN ITALY (1994 - 2014). – The Italian {{banking system}} has {{experienced}} deep {{changes in the}} Nineties, mainly focusing on privatization, de-specialization and concentration. In the Mezzogior- no such dynamics, together with the gradual disintegration of the assisted economic mo- del and with the starting of a new philosophy of development support, {{have led to the}} acquisition of the control of a large proportion of Southern banks by external banking groups. Actually, the balance cost/benefit of this process is uncertain. Credit policy has become more efficient, but the increased functional distance (distance between the terri- tory and the «brain» of the bank), has damaged the relationship between banks and local firms, mostly SME. The paper investigates evolution and current characteristics of banking system, both in Italy and in the South, aiming to understanding positive and ne- gative effects of the <b>consolidation</b> on bank-firm <b>credit</b> relationships.

ABSTRACT: This paper examined the impact of bank <b>consolidation</b> on <b>credit</b> access and availability to small and medium scale enterprises (SME’s) in Nigeria for the period 1999 - 2012. The main objectives are (1) To examine whether or not bank consolidation in Nigeria brought about increased lending to SME’s. (2) Determine the level of lending risk to SME’s. (3) Determine {{if there is any}} significant difference between SME’s financing in pre and post consolidation in 2005. Data on commercial bank loans to SME’s as percentage of total credit was the main variable used and were obtained from CBN Statistical Bulletin 2012. The mean, standard deviation descriptive statistics and the t-test tool were used for the analysis. The study found out that bank consolidation in Nigeria led to a drastic reduction of SME’s financing to less than one percent (0. 37 %) on average. The lending riskiness of banks to SME’s in post consolidation reduced while there is no significant difference between SME’s financing in pre and post consolidation era. The results however go contrary to the much taunted belief that bank consolidation will lead to increased SME’s financing in Nigeria. The study recommends improved transparency of SME’s accounting and reporting of their activities, banks should relax some of the stringent lending measures to SME’s while government should design policies that should group SME’s in such a manner for proper identification and planning (specifically according to trade and industry) so that it can guarantee credit facilities and ensure prompt repaymen...|$|R
40|$|In {{an attempt}} to correct {{economic}} shortfalls, authorities in Nigeria deployed consolidation as the main policy instrument in the 2004 - 2006 reform of the banking industry. The Central Bank of Nigeria drew lessons from similar challenges faced by Malaysian and Indonesian authorities. Nigerian banks were given an 18 month window, to achieve an increased minimum capital base of N 25 billion. To survive, banks could either raise the new requirements {{on their own or}} engage in mergers or acquisitions. The process of consolidation resulted in the reduction of banks from 89 to 24 and the emergence of three categories of banks namely: Stand alone, Common ownership, and Common interest banks. Primarily, this study examines change management practices of senior bank managers directly involved in implementing consolidation in Nigeria, and the impact of <b>consolidation</b> on <b>credit</b> availability to the private sector. Aggregate secondary data on the Nigerian banking industry from 2001 - 2009 were analysed and used to inform in-depth semi-structured interviews with thirteen senior bank managers and a respected independent financial analyst. Mixed methods were used to conduct further analysis. A conceptual framework was developed through an extension of Pettigrew’s 1988 model, while a modified Berger et al. 1998 model was deployed to test credit availability. Findings indicate that most aspects of organisational change were successful, but a lot {{more needs to be done}} to improve cultural integration and employee motivation. The successes achieved by Nigerian banks, resulted in higher levels of credit being made available to the private sector. There is, however, scope for further improvement to be made. For example, senior bank managers should deploy a more holistic approach to planned change, and there should be an improved collaborative approach between the government and private sector which could help enhance alternative credit delivery channels such as micro finance firms, venture capitalists and business angels.

40|$|This {{research}} aims at {{providing a}} depth analysis of {{total factor productivity}} in Vietnamese agriculture and its determinants. Specifically, the research focuses on four major aspects: (a) measuring agricultural total factor productivity growth; (b) regional analysis of agricultural total factor productivity; (c) determinants of provincial agricultural total factor productivity levels; and (d) convergence in agricultural total factor productivity. The works on those aspects in this thesis could be considered as separate essays. The research uses both Data Envelopment Analysis and Stochastic Frontier Analysis to measure the sources of agricultural total factor productivity growth in Vietnam, based on provincial level data in the period 1990 - 2006. It concludes that (a) total factor productivity had grown during the period; (b) shift of the production possibility frontier (technical change) was {{the major source of}} total factor productivity growth, while actual production moved further away from the frontier (technical efficiency reduction); (c) pure technical efficiency change was the most important reason for explaining technical efficiency reduction; and (d) there was a trend of technical efficiency diversification among provinces. Regional analysis of total factor productivity in Vietnamese agriculture has been done in this thesis by using both global meta-frontier Malmquist index and meta-frontier Stochastic Frontier Analysis. By grouping all provinces into six regions, the thesis concludes that (a) not only gaps in agricultural production technology existed, but also these gaps widened among regions; North Midlands and Central Coast lagged further behind; (b) North provinces and Central Coast were better in exploiting their production condition efficiently, while South provinces were better in applying new production technology. The gaps in production technology among those regions were well explained by regional characteristics, especially input ratios (land per labour, tractor per labour). By using the concept of shadow price, implicit input value share and Tornqvist total factor productivity index, a model examining determinants of provincial differences in agricultural total factor productivity level was constructed in this thesis. It concludes that Vietnam’s agriculture has become relatively more capital-intensive during the period 1990 - 2006. The research found several important on-farm and off-farm determinants of agricultural total factor productivity such as provincial GDP per capita, credit access of agricultural household, land quality, size of agricultural population, percentage of non-farm rural population in total agricultural population, farm size, size of land plot, and land fragmentation. This thesis also tests the productivity convergence hypothesis in Vietnam’s agriculture by using both cross-section beta convergence and stochastic long-run convergence. It concludes provinces in the same regions with similar production conditions showed stronger evidence for convergence in their agricultural total factor productivity levels. This thesis suggests several policies for improving agricultural total factor productivity, which focused on three major issues of Vietnam’s agriculture: labour immobility, land consolidation and mechanization. Such policies include promoting labour mobility and resources accumulation in the agricultural sector, agricultural land <b>consolidation,</b> promoting agricultural <b>credit,</b> encouraging agricultural production technology transfer and resource mobility among provinces, developing irrigation activities and developing large scale agricultural areas...|$|R
