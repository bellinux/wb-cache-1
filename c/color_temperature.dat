5|$|A {{white dwarf}} is very hot when it forms, {{but because it}} has no source of energy, it will {{gradually}} radiate its energy and cool. This means that its radiation, which initially has a high <b>color</b> <b>temperature,</b> will lessen and redden with time. Over a very long time, a white dwarf will cool and its material will begin to crystallize (starting with the core). The star's low temperature means it will no longer emit significant heat or light, and {{it will become a}} cold black dwarf. Because the length of time it takes for a white dwarf to reach this state is calculated to be longer than the current age of the universe (approximately 13.8 billion years), it is thought that no black dwarfs yet exist. The oldest white dwarfs still radiate at temperatures of a few thousand kelvins.|$|E
25|$|<b>Color</b> <b>temperature</b> can be {{indicated}} in kelvins or mireds (1 million {{divided by the}} <b>color</b> <b>temperature</b> in kelvins). The <b>color</b> <b>temperature</b> of a light source is the temperature of a black body that has the same chromaticity (i.e. color) as the light source. A notional temperature, the correlated <b>color</b> <b>temperature,</b> the temperature of a black body which emits light of a hue which to human color perception most closely matches {{the light from the}} lamp, is assigned.|$|E
25|$|For {{lighting}} building interiors, it {{is often}} important {{to take into account}} the <b>color</b> <b>temperature</b> of illumination. A warmer (i.e., a lower <b>color</b> <b>temperature)</b> light is often used in public areas to promote relaxation, while a cooler (higher <b>color</b> <b>temperature)</b> light is used to enhance concentration, for example in schools and offices.|$|E

25|$|The <b>color</b> <b>{{temperature}}</b> of a {{light source}} is the temperature of an ideal black-body radiator that radiates light of a color {{comparable to that of}} the light source. <b>Color</b> <b>temperature</b> is a characteristic of visible light that has important applications in lighting, photography, videography, publishing, manufacturing, astrophysics, horticulture, and other fields. In practice, <b>color</b> <b>temperature</b> is meaningful only for light sources that do in fact correspond somewhat closely to the radiation of some black body, i.e., those on a line from reddish/orange via yellow and more or less white to blueish white; it does not make sense to speak of the <b>color</b> <b>temperature</b> of, e.g., a green or a purple light. <b>Color</b> <b>temperature</b> is conventionally expressed in kelvin, using the symbol K, a unit of measure for absolute temperature.|$|E
25|$|Lighting {{designers}} sometimes select filters by <b>color</b> <b>temperature,</b> commonly {{to match}} light that is theoretically white. Since fixtures using discharge type lamps produce a {{light of a}} considerably higher <b>color</b> <b>temperature</b> than do tungsten lamps, using the two in conjunction could potentially produce a stark contrast, so sometimes fixtures with HID lamps, commonly producing light of 6000–7000K, are fitted with 3200K filters to emulate tungsten light. Fixtures with color mixing features or with multiple colors, (if including 3200K) are also capable of producing tungsten-like light. <b>Color</b> <b>temperature</b> {{may also be a}} factor when selecting lamps, since each is likely to have a different <b>color</b> <b>temperature.</b>|$|E
25|$|When a CFL is dimmed, its <b>color</b> <b>temperature</b> (warmth) stays the same. This is {{counter to}} most other light sources (such {{as the sun}} or incandescents) where color gets redder as the light source gets dimmer. The Kruithof curve from 1934 {{described}} an empirical relationship between intensity and <b>color</b> <b>temperature</b> of visually pleasing light sources.|$|E

25|$|The NTSC and PAL TV norms {{call for}} a {{compliant}} TV screen to display an electrically black and white signal (minimal color saturation) at a <b>color</b> <b>temperature</b> of 6500K. On many consumer-grade televisions, {{there is a very}} noticeable deviation from this requirement. However, higher-end consumer-grade televisions can have their color temperatures adjusted to 6500K by using a preprogrammed setting or a custom calibration. Current versions of ATSC explicitly call for the <b>color</b> <b>temperature</b> data {{to be included in the}} data stream, but old versions of ATSC allowed this data to be omitted. In this case, current versions of ATSC cite default colorimetry standards depending on the format. Both of the cited standards specify a 6500K <b>color</b> <b>temperature.</b>|$|E

40|$|<b>Color</b> <b>temperatures</b> {{have been}} {{estimated}} by comparing ultraviolet observations of HgMn and magnetic Ap stars {{with those of}} normal stars. Ultraviolet data from the OAO- 2, ANS, TD- 1, and IUE satellites generally give similar results. The values for the normal stars were derived from comparison of fluxes predicted by solar-composition fully line-blanketed model atmospheres with optical region spectrophotometry. The ultraviolet temperatures of the HgMn stars cover a narrower temperature range than do their optical region values. Magnetic Ap stars with similar optical region temperatures can show substantial differences in their ultraviolet <b>color</b> <b>temperatures.</b> This may result from magnetic field configuration and abundance differences...|$|R

The high-luminosity stars have generally lower, determinable color temperatures; the infinite or indeterminable <b>color</b> <b>temperatures</b> are contained by the set of lower luminosity stars. About half the stars exhibit a mixture of line features, most commonly He II 1640 A and C IV 1550 A in emission or absorption.

The resulting detector responses and their ratio as a function of plasma temperature were then fit with simple analytic curves. Over the entire range between 5 and 30 million degrees, these fits reproduce the calculated <b>color</b> <b>temperatures</b> within 2 % and the calculated emission measures within 5 %.
