40|$|The paper {{presents}} several original GMAW torches {{destined for}} special/universal welding processes. The first category is destined for underwater welding with local drying. The technical designing variants are original, but the fundamental is already known: an air or water curtain is providing a protected area, not permitting the access {{of the water}} (compensating the exterior hyperbaric pressure with the dynamic pressure of the curtain). The protecting gas is classically introduced in the welding arc aria. The second category of torches presented is used in heavy-duty GMAW welding processes, any welding position (antigravity welding). One or two <b>cooling</b> <b>parts</b> are included, in order to permit high values for the welding current intensity. Special materials and technical designing variants were used.

40|$|We demonstate {{stabilization}} of a {{computational fluid dynamics}} model of an unstable system. The unstable heating of a two-dimensional plate {{is used as a}} case study. Active control is introduced by <b>cooling</b> <b>parts</b> of the boundaries of the plate. The high order of the original model is reduced by proper orthogonal decomposition, giving an unstable reduced order model with a state space structure convenient for controller design. A stabilizing controller based on pole placement is designed for the reduced order model and integral action is included to enhance performance. The controller is then applied to the full model, where it is shown through simulations to stabilize the system. The demonstrated procedure makes it possible to analyze stability properties and design control systems for a class of systems that would otherwise be very computationally demanding...|$|E

40|$|Tungsten {{is a prime}} {{candidate}} {{material for}} the plasma-facing components in future fusion devices, e. g. ITER and DEMO.

To alleviate the thermal stresses at the joint, a sharp interface may {{be replaced by a}} gradual one with a smoothly varying composition. In this paper, several techniques for the formation of tungsten-steel composites and graded layers are reviewed. These include plasma spraying, laser cladding, hot pressing and spark plasma sintering. Structure, composition and selected thermal and mechanical properties of representative layers produced by each of these techniques are presented. A summary of advantages and disadvantages of the techniques and an assessment of their suitability for the production of plasma-facing components is provided...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: During {{temperature}} cycles, metallic alloys {{for high}} temperature applications are usually oxidized with forma-tion of an external protective oxide scale, but they loose {{it during the}} cooling. This problem of oxide spallation can be studied by specific tests of cyclic oxidation but first indications can be provided by analyzing the <b>cooling</b> <b>parts</b> of thermo-gravimetry curves. This possibility was studied in this work for simple {Co or Fe} – 30 wt. % Cr alloys containing be-tween 0 and 0. 8 wt. % of carbon, and for two of these alloys after addition of about 5 wt. % of tantalum. These alloys, elaborated by foundry process, were exposed to oxidation at 1000, 1100 or 1200 °C for 50 hours, with recording of their mass gain during heating, isothermal dwell and cooling. The analysis of the cooling part of the thermogravimetry files al-lowed specifying several data characterizing the spallation of the external oxide, such as the temperature at which the phenomenon begins and the rate with which the mass decreases because {{of the loss of}} oxide. Metallographic data about oxidation and spallation were obtained by examination of cross-sections of the oxidized samples. Oxide spallation, char-acterized by its beginning’s temperature and its corresponding mass loss rate, was obviously more severe for the cobalt al-loys than for the iron ones, for the carbon-free alloys than for carbides-containing ones and for tantalum-containing alloys than for the tantalum-free ones. Most of these effects were explained...|$|E
