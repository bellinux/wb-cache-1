5|$|It is rumoured that Briatore {{arranged}} {{an agreement}} with Red Bull that, if they offered Webber a race seat, Renault would supply them with engines. On 26 January 2007 the new Red Bull RB3 challenger was unveiled in Spain, and Webber drove the car in a shakedown in Barcelona on the same day. The car featured heavy revisions to the team's previous cars and looked very much like designer Adrian Newey's previous cars which had either won or <b>come</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> World Title. The car was fitted with a Renault RS27 engine.|$|E

5|$|In 1993, the Senators {{would sign}} Daigle to a $12.25 million contract, the largest rookie salary in League history, which {{would lead to}} a cap on rookie {{contracts}} a few years later. The club would promote Daigle over Alexei Yashin, nominating Daigle for rookie of the year over Yashin. His play did not justify full-time status and in 1995, coaches Rick Bowness and Alain Vigneault demoted Daigle to part-time status. The move led to Bowness and Vigneault being fired. In the end, Daigle did not <b>come</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> career the Senators hoped for. After scoring only 74 goals in just over four seasons, he was traded to the Philadelphia Flyers, and is widely {{regarded as one of the}} biggest draft busts in sports history.|$|E
5|$|The ba of a god {{was said}} to {{periodically}} leave the divine realm to dwell in the images of that god. By inhabiting these images, the gods left their concealed state and took on a physical form. To the Egyptians, a place or object that was ḏsr—"sacred"—was isolated and ritually pure, and thus fit for a god to inhabit. Temple statues and reliefs, as well as particular sacred animals, like the Apis bull, served as divine intermediaries in this way. Dreams and trances provided a very different venue for interaction. In these states, it was believed, people could <b>come</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> gods and sometimes receive messages from them. Finally, according to Egyptian afterlife beliefs, human souls pass into the divine realm after death. The Egyptians therefore believed that in death they would exist {{on the same level}} as the gods and fully understand their mysterious nature.|$|E

He improved his batting considerably, and in 1970 passed a thousand first-class runs in a season for the only time, finishing with 1,158 at 26.93; he had also <b>come</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> mark in 1967, when he scored 917 runs.|$|E

25|$|Mansa Mahmud IV {{retired to}} Niani and died by 1610. His three sons tore the {{remnants}} of the country apart, and Mali became a scattering of loosely allied chiefdoms. These were swallowed up by the Bamana Empire, which even the pashalik of Timbuktu would eventually have to pay tribute to. Still, none of the emergent powers would <b>come</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> hegemony of Mali or Songhai.

Beckman sold the unprofitable Shockley Labs to investors from Cleveland. On July 23, 1961, Shockley was seriously injured in a car crash, and after recovery left the company and returned to teaching at Stanford. In 1969, IT, the new owners of Shockley Labs moved the company to Florida. When the staff refused to move, the lab ceased to exist.|$|E
25|$|Many rare mammals, birds, {{and fish}} have been sighted or caught {{in and around}} Caithness waters. Harbour porpoises, {{dolphins}} (including Risso's, bottle-nosed, common, Atlantic white-sided, and white-beaked dolphins), and minke and long-finned pilot whales are regularly seen from the shore and boats. Both grey and common seals <b>come</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> shore to feed, rest, and raise their pups; a significant population over-winters on small islands in the Thurso river only {{a short walk from}} the town centre. Otters can be seen close to river mouths in some of the quieter locations.|$|E
25|$|Although Georgia {{experiences}} many tropical cyclones, it {{only rarely}} experiences a direct hurricane strike {{due to its}} fairly small coastline. The last hurricane to directly affect the Georgia coastline was Hurricane David in 1979. The last major hurricane (Category 3 or higher) to hit the Georgia coast directly was in 1898. More common are hurricanes which strike the Florida Panhandle, weaken over land, and bring tropical storm or hurricane-force winds and heavy rain to the Georgia interior (especially the southwestern areas), as well as hurricanes that <b>come</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Georgia coastline, brushing the coast on their way up to hit the Carolinas.|$|E

25|$|Poultry housing {{has been}} shown to have adverse effects on the {{respiratory}} health of workers, ranging from a cough to chronic bronchitis. Workers are exposed to concentrated airborne particulate matter (PM) and endotoxins (a harmful waste product of bacteria). In a conventional hen house a conveyor belt beneath the cages removes the manure. In a cage-free aviary system the manure coats the ground, resulting in the build-up of dust and bacteria over time. Eggs are often laid on the ground or under cages in the aviary housing, causing workers to <b>come</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> floor and force dust and bacteria into the air, which they then inhale during egg collection.|$|E
25|$|At dawn on 25 January, {{the three}} frigates and one sloop of Galloway's {{division}} were sighted from the San Francisco de Asís sailing north-eastwards {{at a distance}} of 11 leagues from the port of Cádiz, parallel to the city. The lack of response to the signals of recognition made from the Spanish ship put on alert its crew. The British ships began to <b>come</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> San Francisco de Asís relying on their lightness and their advantage, both in number and in artillery, as the division's ships mounted 40 pieces each of the two heaviest frigates, 34 the lesser one, and 28 the sloop. Minerve and Meleager were armed, moreover, with 24-pounder carronades.|$|E
25|$|Fronsac is {{initially}} {{skeptical about the}} beast's existence, since survivors describe it as much larger than any wolf he has ever seen. However, by studying the bite size on {{a victim of the}} beast, he deduces that it must weigh more than 500lb (227kg). Captain Duhamel, an army officer leading the hunt for the beast, has killed dozens of ordinary wolves, but has not <b>come</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> actual killer. While staying in Gévaudan, Fronsac romances Marianne de Morangias, the daughter of a local count, whose brother, Jean-François, was also an avid hunter and a world traveler, before losing one arm to a lion in Africa. Fronsac is also intrigued by Sylvia, an Italian courtesan at the local brothel.|$|E

25|$|Kiffin's {{defenses}} {{were known}} as gang tacklers with tremendous team speed with a front four that could pressure the quarterback consistently, fast sideline-to-sideline linebackers, and a hard-hitting secondary that caused turnovers. Many teams have copied the Tampa 2, but none have <b>come</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> success the Buccaneers experienced led by numerous Pro Bowlers and Hall of Famers. The Tampa Bay defense featured future Hall of Famers, Derrick Brooks and Warren Sapp, and Pro Bowlers, John Lynch, Ronde Barber, Hardy Nickerson, Simeon Rice, Shelton Quarles, Donnie Abraham, and Super Bowl XXXVII MVP Dexter Jackson. Sapp and Nickerson were named to the 1990s All-Decade 2nd Team while the 2000s All-Decade Team featured Sapp and Brooks as 1st Team players and Ronde Barber on the 2nd Team.|$|E
25|$|The highest {{temperature}} {{ever recorded}} is 112°F (44.4°C) in Louisville on July 24, 1952, while the lowest is −17°F (−27.2°C) in northern Floyd County on January 27, 1940. Georgia {{is one of}} the leading states in frequency of tornadoes, though they are rarely stronger than F1. Although tornadoes striking the city are very rare, a F2 nonviolent tornado hit downtown Atlanta on March 14, 2008, causing moderate to severe damage to various buildings. With a coastline on the Atlantic Ocean, Georgia is also vulnerable to hurricanes, although direct hurricane strikes were rare during the 20th century. Georgia often is affected by hurricanes that strike the Florida panhandle, weaken over land, and bring strong tropical storm winds and heavy rain to the interior, as well as hurricanes that <b>come</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Georgia coastline, brushing the coast on their way north.|$|E

Jackson enjoyed her first charting on the Billboard Hot 200 LP chart, peaking at number 58.

Billboard inexplicably failed to include The Party Ain't Over on the Billboard Hot Country LPs chart, although several of the songs were clearly country, and the genre in which Jackson was always most successful in the United States.|$|E
