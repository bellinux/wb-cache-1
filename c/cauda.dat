5|$|In {{some ancient}} atlases, the constellations Serpens and Ophiuchus were {{depicted}} as two separate constellations, although more often they were shown {{as a single}} constellation. One notable figure to depict Serpens separately was Johann Bayer; thus, Serpens' stars are cataloged with separate Bayer designations from those of Ophiuchus. When Eugène Delporte established modern constellation boundaries in the 1920s, he elected to depict the two separately. However, this posed {{the problem of how}} to disentangle the two constellations, with Deporte deciding to split Serpens into two areas—the head and the tail—separated by the continuous Ophiuchus. These two areas became known as Serpens Caput and Serpens <b>Cauda,</b> caput being the Latin word for head and <b>cauda</b> the Latin word for tail.|$|E
5|$|In November 1533, {{before the}} {{appearance}} of the fifth edition, Sepúlveda sent Erasmus a description of the ancient Vatican manuscript, informing him that it differed from the text which he had edited in favour of the Vulgate in 365 places. We do not know anything about these 365 readings except for one. Erasmus in Adnotationes to Acts 27:16 wrote that according to the Codex from the Library Pontifici (i.e. Codex Vaticanus) name of the island is καυδα (<b>Cauda),</b> not κλαυδα (Clauda) as in his Novum Testamentum (Tamet si quidam admonent in codice Graeco pontificiae bibliothecae scriptum haberi, καυδα, id est, <b>cauda).</b> In another letter sent to Erasmus in 1534 Sepúlveda informed him, that Greek manuscripts were altered from the Vulgate.|$|E
5|$|Serpens is {{the only}} one of the 88 modern constellations to be split into two {{disconnected}} regions in the sky: Serpens Caput (the head) and Serpens <b>Cauda</b> (the tail). The constellation is also unusual in that it depends on another constellation for context; specifically, it is being held by the Serpent Bearer Ophiuchus.|$|E
40|$|The {{localisation}} of the motoneuronal pool of {{the individual}} tail muscles of the cat was studied by using intramuscular injections of horseradish peroxidase (HRP) to retrogradely label motoneurons innervating tail muscles. The motoneurons innervating muscles located on the medial side, extensor <b>caudae</b> medialis (ECM) and flexor <b>caudae</b> brevis (FCB), {{were placed in the}} mediodorsal area of the ventral horn, while those of extensor <b>caudae</b> lateralis (ECL) and flexor <b>caudae</b> longus (FCL) muscles were located in the ventral part of the ventral horn in S 2 and 3 segments. The distribution of these motoneurons was shifted to the lateral side in coccygeal segments, but the motoneurons of lateral muscles (ECL, FCL) were located lateral to those of medial muscles (ECM, FCB). The motoneurons of abductor <b>caudae</b> externus (ACE), abductor <b>caudae</b> internus (ACI) and iliocaudalis and levator ani (IC) were distributed in the intermediate area of the ventral horn. The minimum and maximum diameters of motoneurons innervating the tail muscles were measured and shown in histograms. The histograms were unimodal and the motoneurons of ECM, ECL, FCL and FCB were bigger than those of ACE and ACI...|$|R

5|$|Part of the Milky Way's galactic plane {{passes through}} Serpens <b>Cauda,</b> which is {{therefore}} rich in galactic deep-sky objects, {{such as the}} Eagle Nebula (IC 4703) and its associated star cluster Messier 16. The nebula measures 70 light-years by 50 light-years and contains the Pillars of Creation, three dust clouds that became famous for the image taken by the Hubble Space Telescope. Other striking objects include the Red Square Nebula, {{one of the few}} objects in astronomy to take on a square shape; and Westerhout 40, a massive nearby star-forming region consisting of a molecular cloud and an H II region.|$|E
5|$|Serpens Caput is {{bordered by}} Libra to the south, Virgo and Boötes to the east, Corona Borealis {{to the north}}, and Ophiuchus and Hercules to the west; Serpens <b>Cauda</b> is bordered by Sagittarius to the south, Scutum and Aquila to the east, and Ophiuchus {{to the north and}} west. Covering 636.9 square degrees total, it ranks 23rd of the 88 constellations in size. It appears {{prominently}} in both the northern and southern skies during the Northern Hemisphere's summer.

5|$|The first formal {{scientific}} {{description of}} the common stingray, as Raja pastinaca, was authored by the father of taxonomy Carl Linnaeus in the 1758 tenth edition of Systema Naturae. It has since been placed in the genus Dasyatis. There are at least 25 earlier references to this ray in literature, under various non-binomial names such as Raja corpore glabro, aculeo longo anterius serrato in <b>cauda</b> apterygia, Pastinaca marina prima, and Pastinaca marina lævis. Many of these early accounts, including Linnaeus', also incorporated information from other species. Consequently, the designation of a lectotype is warranted {{in the interests of}} taxonomic stability, but this has yet to be enacted.|$|E

5|$|Imaging is {{indicated}} {{when there are}} red flags, ongoing neurological symptoms that do not resolve, or ongoing or worsening pain. In particular, early use of imaging (either MRI or CT) is recommended for suspected cancer, infection, or <b>cauda</b> equina syndrome. MRI is slightly better than CT for identifying disc disease; the two technologies are equally useful for diagnosing spinal stenosis. Only a few physical diagnostic tests are helpful. The straight leg raise test is almost always positive in those with disc herniation. Lumbar provocative discography {{may be useful to}} identify a specific disc causing pain in those with chronic high levels of low back pain. Similarly, therapeutic procedures such as nerve blocks can be used to determine a specific source of pain. Some evidence supports the use of facet joint injections, transforminal epidural injections and sacroilliac injections as diagnostic tests. Most other physical tests, such as evaluating for scoliosis, muscle weakness or wasting, and impaired reflexes, are of little use.|$|E
5|$|The {{brightest}} {{star in the}} tail, Eta Serpentis, is similar to Alpha Serpentis' primary {{in that it is}} a red giant of spectral class K. This star, however, is known to exhibit solar-like oscillations over a period of approximately 2.16 hours. The other two stars in Serpens <b>Cauda</b> forming its asterism are Theta and Xi Serpentis. Xi, where the asterism crosses over to Mu Serpentis in the head, is a triple star system located approximately 105 parsecs away. Two of the stars, with a combined apparent magnitude of around 3.5, form a spectroscopic binary with an angular separation of only 2.2 milliarcseconds, and thus cannot be resolved with modern equipment. The primary is a white giant with an excess of strontium. Theta, forming the tip of the tail, is also a multiple system, consisting of two A-type main-sequence stars with a combined apparent magnitude of around 4.1 separated by almost half an arcminute.|$|E
5|$|As {{the galactic}} plane passes through it, Serpens <b>Cauda</b> {{contains}} many massive OB stars. Several {{of these are}} {{visible to the naked}} eye, such as NW Serpentis, an early Be star that {{has been found to be}} somewhat variable. The variability is interesting; according to one study, it could be one of the first discovered hybrids between Beta Cephei variables and slowly pulsating B stars. Although not visible to the naked eye, HD 167971 (MY Serpentis) is a Beta Lyrae variable triple system consisting of three very hot O-type stars. A member of the cluster NGC 6604, the two eclipsing stars are both blue giants, with one being of the very early spectral type O7.5III. The remaining star is either a blue giant or supergiant of a late O or early B spectral type. Also an eclipsing binary, the HD 166734 system consists of two O-type blue supergiants in orbit around each other. Less extreme in terms of mass and temperature is HD 161701, a spectroscopic binary consisting of a B-type primary and an Ap secondary, although it is the only known spectroscopic binary to consist of a star with excess of mercury and manganese and an Ap star.|$|E

Spermatogenesis in the banana bat began in late September and spermatozoa were released into the <b>caudae</b> epididymides from late April to late July. Spermatozoa remained present in the <b>caudae</b> epididymides throughout August. Mating was initiated in May and ovulation and fertilization occurred {{at the beginning of}} August. Implantations first occurred during early August and parturition followed from late October to the end of November. Lactating females were found until mid January.

Concentrations of LH and testosterone in serum were similar (P 3 ̆e. 10) for crossbred and purebred boars at all but one sampling time. At 3 h after treatment with GnRH concentrations of LH were greater (P 3 ̆c. 05) in crossbred than purebred boars and concentrations of testosterone were greater (P 3 ̆c. 05) in crossbred than purebred boars at 4 h after GnRH. There was a significant breed x time interaction for concentrations of LH and testosterone. Breed of boar influenced (P 3 ̆c. 05) concentrations of LH at 1, 2 and 3 h after treatment with GnRH, and concentrations of testosterone were affected by breed at 2 and 4 h after treatment. However, breed of boar did not influence either LH or testosterone in serum before treatment with GnRH (0 h) and LH in serum at 4 h and testosterone in serum at 1 and 3 h after GnRH. These results indicate that breed of boars influences testicular characteristics and concentrations of testosterone and LH in serum after GnRH.
