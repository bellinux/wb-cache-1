50|$|Nowadays {{the steel}} reels have {{replaced}} the orthodox wooden reels in the cable and wire industry. They can also be made as <b>collapsible</b> <b>steel</b> drums or <b>collapsible</b> <b>steel</b> reels. The steel reels/drums are manufactured in an eco-friendly manner and are more durable than wooden drums. The life of a drum is longer and hence the overheads for the purchaser/user decrease as compared to those for the user of wooden drums. These steel reels are not as easily stolen. The major industry today prefers steel reels/drums instead of wooden or plywood or plastic reels/drums. The steel reels can be loaded with a different range cables and wires from the most heavy cables to the lightest wires. So {{it can be said}} to be multipurpose reel.|$|R

This allowed solid-slab construction where shearing stresses could be maintained better. Large walls with few supports meant generous-sized windows could be installed on exterior walls to provide better natural sunlight and ventilation. This led to the design in factories known as the [...] "Kahn Daylight System." [...] The company had {{a wide selection of}} steel products for reinforcement and prefabricated them to customer needs and specifications. Some products were <b>collapsible</b> column reinforcements, <b>steel</b> joists, and standardized <b>steel</b> <b>forms.</b> The company had several divisions.

40|$|A signficant problem {{faced by}} the Indian farmer today is thedifficulty of obtaining labor for farm operations. The most labor intensiveoperation is the post-harvest {{resource}} collection. A simple, economical,compact cable way system has been designed, developed and fabricatedto haul sugarcane loads from the field. The cable way is made up ofsimple <b>collapsible</b> <b>steel</b> 'A' posts, which can be assembled on-site fromready-made frames. The sugarcane loads are slung on trolleys whichmove on a steel cable passing {{over the top of}} the frames, the cable beingtightened with a chain pulley block. The trolleys are pulled along by arecirculating rope operated by a winch. The empty trolley is pulled alongby the same rope along a cable way running near the bottom of the 'A'post,. Several trolleys can move simultaneously along the cable way. With a 2 HP motor the trolley speed was noticed to be about 0. 3 m/s andthe overall performance of the prototype was satisfactory.

The projecting rounded shape of this feature is reflected in the base and support of the large semicircular arched opening, through which it projects. On the face of the projection are a number of elongated semicircular arched windows, filled with stained and coloured glass panels, and beneath these are a number of decorative brick bands. The bowed base of the arched opening has a series of window openings, like slits, which provide natural lighting to the corridor within. The base of the archway is supported on a concrete corbel. Below this projection, at street level, are three semicircular arched door openings, fitted with <b>collapsible</b> <b>steel</b> gates, with ornamental ironwork in the head of the archway. Flanking these openings are two arched openings fitted with four windows glazed with square multi-paned glass panels.|$|R

He is ranked as the strongest Namimori student {{by the young}} statistician, Futa, and is also remarked to have an unlimited potential for growth by the Chiavarone's Mafia boss, Dino. His primary weapons are a pair of <b>collapsible</b> <b>steel</b> tonfas which have several hidden compartments containing chains and different types of spikes. After becoming a Vongola Guardian, he acquires the [...] "Vongola Cloud Ring", a special high level ring that helps in manifesting his cloud wave energy into purple flames which possess propagation characteristics. Hibari possesses strong amounts of wave energy, {{so much so that}} when his future self uses normal rings, they shatter shortly after. Future Hibari has also acquired special boxes which release flame covered tonfas or hedgehogs when activated by his rings. Using his flame's characteristics, the hedgehogs can multiply, expand its spikes, or grow into a huge spiked sphere that can either damage everything it touches or encase people within an airtight space.|$|R
