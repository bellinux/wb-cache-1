500|$|The song {{begins with}} a six second-long sample of former NASA public affairs officer Steve Nesbitt, {{recorded}} moments after Space Shuttle Challenger disaster on January 28, 1986: [...] "Flight controllers here looking very <b>carefully</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> situation. Obviously a major malfunction." [...] These were the last words spoken before the disintegrating vehicle fell into the sea. The use of the sample has been criticized in the media, including Hardeep Phull of the New York Post, who described its presence in the song as [...] "tasteless". Former NASA astronauts and families were also dismayed and labeled {{the use of the}} sample as [...] "insensitive". Keith Cowing of NASA Watch suggested that the use of the clip ranged from negligence to repugnance.|$|E
500|$|In 1978 Soedjatmoko {{received}} the Ramon Magsaysay Award for International Understanding, often called Asia's Nobel Prize. The citation read, in part: Encouraging both Asians and outsiders {{to look more}} <b>carefully</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> village folkways they would modernize, [...] is fostering awareness of the human dimension essential to all development. [...] is writings have added consequentially {{to the body of}} international thinking on {{what can be done to}} meet one of the greatest challenges of our time; how to make life more decent and satisfying for the poorest 40 percent in Southeastern and southern Asia. In response, Soedjatmoko said he felt [...] "humbled, because of [...] awareness that whatever small contribution [...] may have made is dwarfed by the magnitude of the problem of persistent poverty and human suffering in Asia, and by the realization of how much still remains to be done." ...|$|E
2500|$|Although female genital {{mutilation}} – {{the practice of}} cutting off a woman's labia and sometimes clitoris, {{and in some cases}} creating a seal across her entire vulva – is illegal across the Western world, Davis argues that [...] "when you really look <b>carefully</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> language used in some of those laws, they would also make illegal the labiaplasties that are being done by plastic surgeons in the U.S." [...] The World Health Organization (WHO) defines female {{genital mutilation}} as [...] "all procedures that involve partial or total removal of the external female genitalia, or other injury to the female genital organs for non-medical reasons." [...] The WHO writes that the term is not generally applied to elective procedures such as labiaplasty.|$|E

60|$|He bent down, <b>carefully</b> looking <b>at</b> <b>the</b> little, thin, {{wounded knee}} of the child. Egbert bent over him.|$|R

2500|$|When {{training}} resumed for the 1893–94 season, full-back Tom Bayley {{had been}} released, but the Post expected Speller {{to take his}} place. He had played in practice matches and was [...] "fully confident {{of his ability to}} perform as well as ever he did". Teddy Jolley and newcomer Bernard Pumfrey began the season at full back, but a defeat at Liverpool and a heavy defeat at Burslem Port Vale gave Speller his chance. His first game for almost a year came in a visit to Ardwick, won 1–0 by Small Heath. According to the Post, [...] "he played <b>carefully</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> start, but gained confidence as the game proceeded, and many times put a stop to extremely dangerous attacks by the clever right wing of the home team." [...] He played in the next game, a 5–2 win at home to Grimsby Town, then lost his place to William Reynolds. At Christmas, Small Heath played a friendly at Marlow, in which Speller had [...] "not been seen in such form since his leg was broken". Nevertheless, he retired {{at the end of the}} season. Before he broke his leg, he had not missed a game in League or FA Cup since the ankle injury some two-and-a-half years earlier.|$|E

60|$|The {{king was}} overjoyed by her words, and from {{early in the}} morning till late at night he sat <b>at</b> <b>the</b> window and looked <b>carefully</b> <b>at</b> all <b>the</b> passers-by, in the hopes of finding a {{son-in-law}} among them.|$|R
60|$|Carmichael {{maintained}} a discreet silence, and <b>carefully</b> avoided looking <b>at</b> <b>the</b> girls.|$|R

5000|$|If {{we are to}} {{integrate}} the wisdom of yesterday {{with the knowledge of}} today—and that means, in the broadest sweep, the best of premodern, modern, and postmodern—we will have to look <b>carefully</b> <b>at</b> what <b>the</b> postmodern linguistic turn brought {{to our understanding of the}} Kosmos added.

5|$|Monument 215 {{is a part}} of the Cargador del Ancestro sculpture. It {{was found}} {{embedded}} in the east face of Structure 7A, where it was <b>carefully</b> placed <b>at</b> <b>the</b> same time as the royal burial was interred in the centre of the structure.|$|R

6000|$|Dan'l Borem rose, coughed, expectorated <b>carefully</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> usual {{spot in the}} fender, {{his general}} custom of {{indicating}} {{the conclusion of a}} subject or an interview, and said dryly: [...] "I'm thar!" ...|$|E
60|$|Malbihn screamed {{to her to}} halt. He {{seemed to}} have gone mad with rage at the {{realization}} {{that he could not}} overtake her, and then he threw his rifle to his shoulder, aimed <b>carefully</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> slim figure scrambling into the trees, and fired.|$|E
50|$|In 1967, {{the villa}} made news when Jim Thompson mysteriously {{disappeared}} from the Cameron Highlands. The home was visited by scores of searchers.

50|$|The {{manuscript}} was rediscovered in its cumdach in 1813, {{and given}} by its last hereditary keeper to the Royal Irish Academy in 1843.

60|$|Guy {{studied it}} for a few moments <b>carefully,</b> and looked <b>at</b> <b>the</b> scale. Then he pointed to a certain spot.|$|R
60|$|Mr Kay looked <b>carefully</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> ex-head of his house. Fenn was a finely-developed youth. He stood six feet, {{and all of}} {{him that}} was not bone was muscle. A useful {{colleague}} to have by one in a hunt for a possibly ferocious burglar.|$|E
60|$|He {{looked up}} at the pantry ceiling, which was shaking with the {{stamping}} and shuffling of feet on the floor above, listened for a moment to the piano and then glanced at the girl, who was folding his overcoat <b>carefully</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> end of a shelf.|$|E
60|$|We {{drew near}} and looked <b>carefully</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> place.

50|$|For food safety, the CDC {{recommends}} proper fruit {{handling and}} preparation {{to reduce the}} risk of food contamination and foodborne illness.

60|$|We {{examined}} the cask <b>carefully.</b> <b>At</b> <b>the</b> bottom was a bunghole {{in which a}} bung had been placed; but either the riding of the raft or the shock had loosened the bung, and it had dropped out and allowed the water to run away to the last drop.|$|E
60|$|They now {{looked more}} <b>carefully</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> sand-boat, {{and saw that}} the bottom was {{modelled}} with two sharp runners which would glide through the sand. The front of the sand-boat was pointed like the bow of a ship, and there was a rudder at the stern to steer by.|$|E
6000|$|A {{little before}} eight o'clock, Monsieur Rubelle {{came back with}} my unopened letter in his hand.

6000|$|... 252. I spoke {{just now}} {{only of the}} ill-shaped body of this figure of Fortune, or Pleasure. Beneath her feet is an {{elaborate}} landscape.

50|$|Here Virilio mixes up {{velocity}} (vitesse) and acceleration, the {{two basic}} concepts of kinematics (the description of motion), which are introduced and <b>carefully</b> distinguished <b>at</b> <b>the</b> beginning of every introductory physics course.221 Perhaps this confusion isn’t worth stressing; {{but for a}} purported specialist {{in the philosophy of}} speed, it is nonetheless a bit surprising.|$|R
