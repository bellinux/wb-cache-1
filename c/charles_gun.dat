60|$|As I {{climbed out}} of the vehicle a splendid-looking and portly person, arrayed in a velvet coat and a scarlet waistcoat, {{approached}} with the air of an emperor, followed by an individual in whom I recognized <b>Charles,</b> carrying a <b>gun</b> under each arm.|$|R
50|$|On 15 October 1810 the {{privateer}} <b>Charles,</b> of 20 <b>guns</b> and 200 men, {{captured the}} Howe, Pentrick, master. Howe had sailed for Penzance from Quebec in {{a convoy of}} 25 vessels under escort by , but had separated from the convoy five days earlier.

6000|$|Scroope made {{me angry}} by {{slapping}} me so hard upon the back that it hurt, and nearly {{caused me to}} let off the other barrel of the <b>gun.</b> <b>Charles</b> seemed to become one great grin, and Lord Ragnall, with a brief congratulatory [...] "Never enjoyed a shoot so much in my life," [...] called {{to the men who}} were posted behind us to pick up all the dead pheasants, being careful to keep mine apart from those of Sir Junius Fortescue.|$|R
50|$|The Preacher's Corners {{citizens}} begin fearing Charles. He is chased {{away from}} one house with rocks and <b>guns.</b> <b>Charles</b> asks the Chapelwaite's former maid for information about Jerusalem's Lot. She reveals that a rift in Charles' family was caused when his grandfather, Robert Boone, attempted to steal De Vermis Mysteriis from his brother Philip, presumably to destroy it. Philip was a minister heavily involved in the occult. On October 31, 1789, Philip vanished along with the populace of Jerusalem's Lot. Charles dismisses it as superstition, but cannot forget what {{he saw in the}} church.|$|R
50|$|The next day, Charles becomes {{convinced}} {{his son is}} responsible for the deaths. When Christine tells him that Andy is on a double date with his high school sweetheart, Joanne, his sister and his best friend, <b>Charles</b> gets his <b>gun</b> and goes looking for them. At a drive-in cinema, Andy visibly decays due to lack of blood. He attacks and kills Joanne and his friend. The other patrons witness the attack. Andy flees before he can inject his victims' blood, running over and killing one of the patrons.|$|R
5000|$|At {{approximately}} 11 p.m. on July 23, 1900, {{three white}} police officers, Sergeant Jules C. Aucion, August T. Mora, and Joseph D. Cantrelle, investigated reports of “two suspicious looking negroes” {{sitting on a}} porch in a predominantly white neighborhood. They found Robert Charles and his roommate, 19-year-old Leonard Pierce, at the scene. The policemen questioned the two men, demanding {{to know what they}} [...] "were doing and how long they had been there." [...] One of the two men replied that they were [...] "waiting for a friend." [...] Charles stood up, which the police took as an aggressive move. Mora grabbed him and the two struggled. Mora hit Charles with his billet club. Mora and <b>Charles</b> pulled <b>guns</b> and exchanged shots. Reports vary on who drew first; both men received non-lethal gunshot wounds to the legs. Charles fled the scene to his residence, leaving a trail of blood. Pierce, also armed, was covered by a police officer when Charles ran.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh! you {{cannot be}} such a {{fortunate}} man as to want nothing, Charles," [...] said Lady Marney with a smile. [...] "A dressing-case you have: your rooms are furnished enough: all this is in my way; but there are such things as horses and guns of which I know nothing, but which men always require. You must want a horse or a <b>gun,</b> <b>Charles.</b> Well, I should like you to get either; the finest, the most valuable that money can purchase. Or a brougham, Charles; {{what do you think}} of a new brougham? Would you like that Barker should build you a brougham?" ...|$|R
5000|$|Abby's ex-husband, Charles [...] "Chip" [...] Putney, {{comes to}} the White House when he is {{nominated}} for Virginia's U.S. Senator, which devastates Abby. Olivia helps Abby by working on the campaign of the other nomination, Susan Ross, and successfully getting her elected Senator. Abby confronts <b>Charles</b> with a <b>gun</b> and he backs off, which finally gives her closure about her marriage. She also becomes closer with Leo Bergen after he ruins Charles' campaign. When revealing pictures of Cyrus and Michael hit the news, Abby must control the press. After the news scandal is over, Abby finally earns respect from Fitz and Cyrus.|$|R
60|$|It was true. The Duke of York in the Royal <b>Charles,</b> of eighty <b>guns,</b> and the Eendracht, of eighty-four, the {{flagship}} of Admiral Obdam, had met and engaged each other fiercely. For {{a time the}} Dutchmen had the best of it. A single shot killed the Earl of Falmouth, Lord Muskerry, and Mr. Boyle, three gentlemen Volunteers, who at the moment were standing close to the Duke, and the Royal Charles suffered heavily until a shot {{from one of her}} guns struck the Dutchman's magazine, and the Eendracht blew up, only five men being rescued out of the five hundred that were on board of her.|$|R
50|$|Anna {{goes back}} to her law office {{building}} where she confronts her former boss, Charles Adams, {{who has been working}} behind the scenes to orchestrate this whole thing. When Anna tries to shoot him, she is attacked by Chiba, the brutal Japanese assasin sent from Japan to kill her. After a climatic and brutal fistfight between the two women {{in the lobby of the}} building, Anna gets the upper hand and kills the female Yakuza by slashing her neck with her cross necklass that she wears around her neck. Relieved but exhausted, Anna is only confronted by <b>Charles,</b> pointing a <b>gun</b> at her. Before he can shoot Anna, Detective Garcia runs in and shoots him dead.|$|R
5000|$|The Edmonton {{chapter of}} the Rebels folded in 1997, soon after the arrest of then secretary-treasurer Scott Jamieson. In 2004, Joey [...] "Crazy Horse" [...] Morin, a.k.a. Joey Campbell, a former {{associate}} of the Edmonton {{chapter of the}} Rebels, and Robert <b>Charles</b> Simpson were <b>gunned</b> down outside an Edmonton strip club. At {{the time of the}} murders, the Bandidos website identified Morin as a probationary member and Simpson as a hangaround. Sources close to the investigation speculated at the time that Morin and Simpson were in Edmonton to set up shop and the murders were committed by a group opposed to that happening. To date no arrests have been made and the file is still officially open and active.|$|R
5000|$|John Browne {{developed}} {{a type of}} cannon known as [...] "The Drake" [...] in the 1620s. This cannon was much lighter than previous cannons firing a similar weight of shot, thus enabling ships to be more heavily armed. One such cannon made by Browne was recovered from the wreck of HMS Swan, a 200 LT Cromwellian warship lost in a storm off the Isle of Mull in 1653 whilst attacking Duart Castle. This cannon weighed 3cwt, 2qtrs, 23 lbs (415 lb) and had a 3½" [...] (89mm) muzzle. It fired shot weighing 4 lb. HMS Swan was the last ship built for <b>Charles</b> I; its <b>guns</b> were all cast in iron. A larger ship, HMS Sovereign of the Seas had 92 Drakes, cast in bronze, as well as 10 non-Drakes, also cast in bronze.|$|R
5000|$|On Monday, July 24, 1900, Charles {{sat on a}} {{front porch}} in New Orleans talking quietly with a friend, while waiting for another to return. Close to midnight, three police {{officers}} arrived to interrogate and then (according to the wounded officer's own statement) attempted to arrest them when Charles stood up. In the ensuing altercation, <b>Charles</b> drew his <b>gun</b> and wounded one of the officers. Wounded himself, he fled to his own place. [...] Grabbing a rifle for self-defense, Charles moved from one hiding place to another. Along his trail he left five dead police officers and a dozen wounded ones. A mob of over one thousand joined the police in the manhunt, frequently firing indiscriminately into the black community, taking at least eight innocent lives and brutally beating and arresting many more. Finally surrounded, Charles was burned out of his hiding place and immediately riddled with bullets. As was customary, the mob mutilated the body.|$|R
