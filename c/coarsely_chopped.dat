5000|$|Part of the {{function}} of menu prose is to impress customers {{with the notion that}} the dishes served at the restaurant require such skill, equipment, and exotic ingredients that the diners could not prepare similar foods at home. In some cases, ordinary foods are made to sound more exciting by replacing everyday terms with their French equivalent. For example, instead of stating that a pork chop has a dollop of applesauce, a high-end restaurant menu might state [...] "Tenderloin of pork avec compôte de pommes." [...] Although [...] "avec compôte de pommes" [...] translates directly as [...] "with applesauce," [...] it sounds more exotic—and more worthy of an inflated price tag. Menus may use the culinary terms concassé to describe <b>coarsely</b> <b>chopped</b> vegetables, coulis to describe a puree of vegetables or fruit, or au jus, to describe meat served with its own natural gravy of pan drippings.|$|E
5000|$|In Italy, raw rocket {{is often}} added to pizzas {{just before the}} baking period ends or {{immediately}} afterwards, {{so that it will}} not wilt in the heat.

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{increasing}} levels of solvent-extracted {{palm kernel meal}} (SPKM) and corn distillers dried grains (CDG) in corn silage-based diets on feed intake and milk production were examined in 2 experiments. In Experiment 1, 20 Holstein cows averaging 100 d in milk (DIM) (SD = 61. 5) {{at the start of}} the experiment were utilized in an 11 -wk randomized complete block design with 4 treatments in 5 blocks to study effects of increasing levels of SPKM in the diet. During a 3 -wk preliminary period, cows were fed a standard diet. At the end of the preliminary period, cows were blocked by 4 % fat-corrected milk yield, parity number (primiparous and multiparous), and DIM, and were assigned randomly to 1 of 4 experimental diets. The total mixed ration (TMR) consisted of (dry matter basis) 40 % corn silage, 5 % <b>coarsely</b> <b>chopped</b> wheat straw, and 55 % concentrate. The increasing dietary levels of SPKM were achieved by replacing protein sources and citrus pulp with SPKM and urea (0, 5, 10, and 15 % SPKM and 0. 06, 0. 22, 0. 38, and 0. 55 % urea for SPKM 0, SPKM 5, SPKM 10, and SPKM 15, respectively). In Experiment 2, 18 Holstein cows averaging 93 DIM (SD = 49. 1) {{at the start of the}} experiment were utilized in an 11 -wk randomized complete block design with 3 treatments in 6 blocks to study effects of increasing levels of CDG in the diet. The preliminary period lasted for 2 wk. Assignment of cows to treatments was the same as in Experiment 1. The TMR consisted of (dry matter basis) 40 % corn silage, 5 % <b>coarsely</b> <b>chopped</b> wheat straw, and 55 % concentrate.

There were no significant treatment effects on dry matter intake, milk yield, or milk composition in Experiment 1. Inclusion of SPKM tended to increase protein and lactose contents of milk. The SPKM 0 diet promoted body weight loss. There were no treatment effects in Experiment 2, except for milk protein content, which was decreased by CDG. Plasma Lys concentration tended to be affected by SPKM and CDG inclusions. Plasma concentrations of 3 -methylhistidine and Leu seemed to be related to body protein degradation/synthesis. The feeding of SPKM up to 15 % in the diet decreased feed costs without detrimental effects on productive responses and tended to increase milk protein content. The inclusion of CDG in diets based on corn silage and corn byproducts might decrease milk protein content due to an unbalanced supply of AA, particularly Lys...|$|E
