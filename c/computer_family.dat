5|$|At the 1982 AMOA Show, Parker Brothers {{secured the}} license to publish home {{conversions}} of the Q*bert arcade game. Parker first published a port to the Atari 2600, {{and by the}} end of 1983, the company also advertised versions for Atari 5200, Intellivision, ColecoVision, the Atari 8-bit <b>computer</b> <b>family,</b> Commodore VIC-20, Texas Instruments TI-99/4A and Commodore 64. The release of the Commodore 64 version was noted to lag behind the others but appeared in 1984. Parker Brothers also translated the game into a stand-alone tabletop electronic game. It uses a VFD screen, and has since become a rare collector's item. Q*bert was also published by Parker Brothers for the Philips Videopac in Europe, by Tsukuda Original for the Othello Multivision in Japan, and by Ultra Games for the NES in North America.|$|E
