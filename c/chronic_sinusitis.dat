5|$|Diffuse panbronchiolitis (DPB) is an {{inflammatory}} lung disease of unknown cause. It is a severe, progressive form of bronchiolitis, {{an inflammatory}} {{condition of the}} bronchioles (small air passages in the lungs). The term diffuse signifies that lesions appear throughout both lungs, while panbronchiolitis refers to inflammation found in all layers of the respiratory bronchioles (those involved in gas exchange). DPB causes severe inflammation and nodule-like lesions of terminal bronchioles, <b>chronic</b> <b>sinusitis,</b> and intense coughing with large amounts of sputum production.|$|E
5|$|DPB and bronchiolitis obliterans are {{two forms}} of primary bronchiolitis. Specific {{overlapping}} features of both diseases include strong cough with large amounts of often pus-filled sputum; nodules viewable on lung X-rays in the lower bronchi and bronchiolar area; and <b>chronic</b> <b>sinusitis.</b> In DPB, the nodules are more restricted to the respiratory bronchioles, while in OB they are often found in the membranous bronchioles (the initial non-cartilaginous section of the bronchiole, that divides from the tertiary bronchus) up to the secondary bronchus. OB is a bronchiolar disease with worldwide prevalence, while DPB has more localized prevalence, predominantly in Japan. Prior to clinical recognition of DPB in recent years, it was often misdiagnosed as bronchiectasia, COPD, IPF, phthisis miliaris, sarcoidosis or alveolar cell carcinoma.|$|E
5|$|Because many genes {{belonging}} to HLA remain unidentified, positional cloning (a method {{used to identify}} a specific gene, when only its location on a chromosome is known) {{has been used to}} determine that a mucin-like gene is associated with DPB. In addition, diseases caused by identified HLA genes in the DPB-susceptibility region have been investigated. One of these, bare lymphocyte syndrome I (BLS I), exhibits a number of similarities with DPB in those affected, including <b>chronic</b> <b>sinusitis,</b> bronchiolar inflammation and nodules, and the presence of H.influenzae. Also like DPB, BLS I responds favorably to erythromycin therapy by showing a resolution of symptoms. The similarities between these two diseases, the corresponding success with the same mode of treatment, {{and the fact that the}} gene responsible for BLS I is located within the DPB-causing area of HLA narrows the establishment of a gene responsible for DPB. Environmental factors such as inhaling toxic fumes and cigarette smoking are not believed to play a role in DPB, and unknown environmental and other non-genetic causessuch as unidentified bacteria or viruseshave not been ruled out.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Sub {{acute and}} <b>chronic</b> maxillary <b>sinusitis</b> is {{commonly}} encountered in {{day to day}} ENT practice. Here we compare the management options available {{in the treatment of}} these two conditions. Methodology: Endoscopic sinus surgery and antral wash out are two well known and authentic procedures used in the management of maxillary sinusitis. Here we evaluate the effectiveness and advantages of both the procedures in the management of sub acute and <b>chronic</b> maxillary <b>sinusitis.</b> 40 patients were evaluated. 20 patients underwent antral lavage and the remaining 20 underwent Endoscopic sinus surgery. Equal number of patients with sub acute and chronic maxillary sinusits underwent both the procedures. Result: Evaluation was done based on the symptoms, anterior rhinoscopy finding and radiological finding. Conclusion: Endoscopic sinus surgery is an ideal management tool for <b>chronic</b> maxillary <b>sinusitis.</b> But sub acute maxillary sinusits can be treated as a day care procedure by antral washout...|$|R

25|$|A more recent, {{and still}} debated, {{development}} in <b>chronic</b> <b>sinusitis</b> {{is the role}} that fungi play in this disease.

25|$|Sinusitis is {{a common}} condition, with between 24 and 31 million cases {{occurring}} in the United States annually. <b>Chronic</b> <b>sinusitis</b> affects approximately 12.5% of people.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to present the current {{classification}} of fungal sinusitis and share our experiences in diagnostic procedures and treatment outcomes. The study includes 31 patients operated since 2000 - 2009. in whome some form of fungal infection had been diagnosed. There were 10 patients with mycetoma, and 16 patients with <b>chronic</b> non-invasive fungal <b>sinusitis,</b> while in five patients allergic fungal sinusitis was proven. All patients were treated postoperatively with topical steroids and irrigation with saline solution, without use of fungicides. Characteristics of <b>chronic</b> non-invasive funga <b>sinusitis</b> and mycetoma are CT with specific opacification and calcification with involement of maxillary sinus unilaterally or bilateral together with pathohistological finding of positive staining by Grocott with the identification of fungi from secret or tissue. Allergic fungal sinusitis is characterized by eosinophilia, positive skin test to fungal allergens, elevated serum level of both specific IgE antibodies to causal fungus and total IgE, as well as, pathohistological finding of allergic mucus which include non-invasive hifa.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{investigate}} {{the accuracy of}} cone beam CT (CBCT) to diagnose non-invasive chronic fungal rhinosinusitis. METHODS: Preoperative CT evaluation of non-invasive chronic fungal rhinosinusitis was performed by CBCT (3 D Accuitomo 170 ®) and traditional multidetector CT (MDCT) (Aquilion 32 ®) in 13 and 38 patients with non-invasive <b>chronic</b> fungal maxillary <b>sinusitis,</b> respectively, in different facilities. Detection of intrasinus calcification was compared between these two groups. RESULTS: Detection of intrasinus calcification in patients with non-invasive <b>chronic</b> fungal maxillary <b>sinusitis</b> was higher in the MDCT group (84. 2 %) than the CBCT group (46. 2 %). CONCLUSION: CBCT is inferior to MDCT in detection of intrasinus calcification in patients with non-invasive <b>chronic</b> fungal maxillary <b>sinusitis.</b> CBCT is frequently used in the screening of the paranasal lesion, {{but it is not}} enough to evaluate non-invasive <b>chronic</b> fungal maxillary <b>sinusitis</b> alone.

25|$|Some {{researchers}} {{have proposed that}} recurrent ear infections, and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis might be tied, in some cases, to GERD; however, a causative role has not been established. GERD {{does not appear to}} be linked to <b>chronic</b> <b>sinusitis.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Chronic</b> <b>sinusitis</b> {{cases are}} {{subdivided}} into cases with polyps and cases without polyps. When polyps are present, {{the condition is}} called chronic hyperplastic sinusitis; however, the causes are poorly understood and may include allergy, environmental factors such as dust or pollution, bacterial infection, or fungus (either allergic, infective, or reactive).|$|E
50|$|As antral Washout is a {{much simpler}} {{procedure}} compared to FESS, it may be done on an outpatient basis for Subacute Maxillary Sinusitis. However, FESS remains gold standard in treatment of <b>Chronic</b> Maxillary <b>Sinusitis.</b>|$|R
40|$|Nasal secretions, maxillary sinus aspirates and {{specimens}} of the maxillary sinus mucosa {{were collected in}} 44 patients aged between 25 and 60 affected by mono- or bilateral <b>chronic</b> maxillary <b>sinusitis,</b> {{in order to establish}} the best sampling technique for microbiological purposes, the most frequently involved bacteria and the physiopathological mechanism underlying chronic maxillary disease. The sinusal mucosa resulted to be the most reliable sample as it reduces contamination and microbial variability. Anaerobic bacteria were isolated in nasal swab (15. 6 %), in maxillary sinus aspirates (30. 4 %) and in maxillary sinus mucosa (36. 4 %) of maxillary sinusitis patients. In controls anaerobic bacteria were isolated only in one nasal swab (2. 3 %), while they could not be isolated in maxillary sinus aspirates and in maxillary sinus mucosa.

25|$|Attempts {{have been}} made to provide a more {{consistent}} nomenclature for subtypes of <b>chronic</b> <b>sinusitis.</b> The presence of eosinophils in the mucous lining of the nose and paranasal sinuses has been demonstrated for many patients, and this has been termed eosinophilic mucin rhinosinusitis (EMRS).

40|$|This is a {{case report}} of <b>chronic</b> maxillary <b>sinusitis</b> caused by root canal {{overfilling}} of Calcipex II (Techno-Dent). A 60 year-old male complained of dull pain in the right maxillary molar area after complicated endodontic treatment using Calcipex II paste and was finally diagnosed with a <b>chronic</b> maxillary <b>sinusitis</b> through a clinical and radiological observation. In the biopsy examination, the periapical granuloma contained a lot of dark and translucent Calcipex II granules which were not stained with hematoxylin and eosin. They were usually engulfed by macrophages but rarely resorbed, resulting in scattering and migrating into antral mucosa. Most of the Calcipex II granules were also accumulated in the cytoplasms of secretory columnar epithelial cells, and small amount of Calcipex II granules were gradually secreted into sinus lumen by exocytosis. However, chronic granulomatous inflammation occurred without the additional recruitment of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) and lymphocytes, and many macrophages which engulfed the Calcipex II granules were finally destroyed in the processes of cellular apoptosis. It is presumed that Calcipex II granules {{are likely to have}} a causative role to induce the granulomatous foreign body inflammation in the periapical region, and subsequently to exacerbate the <b>chronic</b> maxillary <b>sinusitis</b> in this study. ...|$|R

25|$|About 25% of {{individuals}} with situs inversus have an underlying condition known as primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD). PCD is a dysfunction of the cilia that manifests itself during the embryologic phase of development. Normally functioning cilia determine {{the position of the}} internal organs during early embryological development, and so embryos with PCD have a 50% chance of developing situs inversus. If they do, they are said to have Kartagener syndrome, characterized by the triad of situs inversus, <b>chronic</b> <b>sinusitis,</b> and bronchiectasis. Cilia are also responsible for clearing mucus from the lung, and the dysfunction causes increased susceptibility to lung infections. Kartagener syndrome can also manifest with male infertility as functional cilia are required for proper sperm flagella function.|$|E
25|$|It has {{recently}} been shown that biofilms are present on the removed tissue of 80% of patients undergoing surgery for <b>chronic</b> <b>sinusitis.</b> The patients with biofilms were shown to have been denuded of cilia and goblet cells, unlike the controls without biofilms who had normal cilia and goblet cell morphology. Biofilms were also found on samples from two of 10 healthy controls mentioned. The species of bacteria from intraoperative cultures did not correspond to the bacteria species in the biofilm on the respective patient's tissue. In other words, the cultures were negative though the bacteria were present. New staining techniques are being developed to differentiate bacterial cells growing in living animals, e.g. from tissues with allergy-inflammations.|$|E

40|$|Objective: The authors {{report on}} a patient whose {{unilateral}} <b>chronic</b> maxillary <b>sinusitis</b> {{was caused by the}} migration of a silastic implant used for orbital floor repair. Case report: A 32 -year-old woman presented with a three-year history of right-sided maxillary discomfort that was associated with a purulent discharge. Her medical history included chronic allergic rhinitis and the placement of a silastic implant after a right orbital floor fracture at the age of 14. The silastic implant was then removed endoscopically in a right maxillary sinus meatotomy. The symptoms improved within three weeks after surgery. Conclusion: Orbital implant migration is a rare cause of <b>chronic</b> unilateral <b>sinusitis,</b> and it must be suspected {{on the basis of a}} careful anamnesis, appropriate clinical examination, and sinus computed tomography. Misdiagnosing such a condition may increase patient morbidity by leading to inappropriate treatment. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R

500|$|Symptoms of DPB include <b>chronic</b> <b>sinusitis</b> (inflamed {{paranasal}} sinuses), wheezing, crackles (respiratory sounds made by obstructions such as phlegm and secretions in the lungs), dyspnea (shortness of breath), and {{a severe}} cough that yields {{large amounts of}} sputum (coughed-up phlegm). There may be pus in the sputum, and affected individuals may have fever. Typical signs of DPB progression include [...] (enlargement) of the bronchiolar passages and hypoxemia (low levels of oxygen in the blood). If DPB is left untreated, bronchiectasis will occur; it is characterized by dilation and thickening of {{the walls of the}} bronchioles, inflammatory damage to respiratory and terminal bronchioles, and pooling of mucus in the lungs. DPB is associated with progressive respiratory failure, hypercapnia (increased levels of carbon dioxide in the blood), and can eventually lead to pulmonary hypertension (high blood pressure in the pulmonary vein and artery) and cor pulmonale (dilation of the right ventricle of the heart, or [...] "right heart failure").|$|E
2500|$|By {{definition}} <b>chronic</b> <b>sinusitis</b> lasts {{longer than}} three months and {{can be caused by}} many different diseases that share chronic inflammation of the sinuses as a common symptom.

Each of these symptoms has multiple other possible causes, which should be considered and investigated as well. [...] Often <b>chronic</b> <b>sinusitis</b> can lead to anosmia, the inability to smell objects. In a small number of cases, acute or chronic maxillary sinusitis is associated with a dental infection.

40|$|Respiratory {{disease has}} {{affected}} human populations throughout {{our history and}} remains a significant cause {{of morbidity and mortality}} today. In spite of this, there is a dearth of bioarchaeological research on this important subject. Previous research has suggested a relationship between poor air quality and the prevalence of <b>chronic</b> maxillary <b>sinusitis</b> and rib periostitis. These conditions have many causes (e. g. congenital disorders, allergies, poor air quality, climate, infectious disease). <b>Chronic</b> maxillary <b>sinusitis</b> and rib periostitis are recognised as bone formation and/or destruction, indicating long-term inflammation of the soft tissues of the sinuses and ribs in some upper and lower respiratory tract conditions. If air quality is a significant contributor to respiratory disease, the highest prevalence rates would be expected in populations exposed to high concentrations of indoor and outdoor pollutants. This study examines 12 skeletal samples from cemeteries located in southern England, ranging in date from the Iron Age to the Post Medieval Period. The samples were chosen to examine both synchronic and diachronic trends in respiratory disease, contrasting contemporaneous populations living in rural and urban contexts, as well as populations from high and low social status groups. A total of 1203 individuals were examined for this study. Of these, 1101 had at least one sinus preserved, and of these individuals, 546 (49. 6 %) had sinusitis in one or both sinuses. A total of 2091 sinuses were recorded. Of these, 854 (40. 8 %) had <b>chronic</b> maxillary <b>sinusitis.</b> 50. 42 % of 720 males and analysed had sinusitis and 47. 85 % of 372 females (not significant).

40|$|Abstract. An {{investigation}} of the indices {{of the system of}} immunity has been carried out in 80 children with frequent recurrence of respiratory infection and 35 healthy children. It has been found that the frequent recurrence of respiratory infection is associated with depression of the cell component of the immune system as a reduction in the total pool of TCD 3 +-lymphocytes with a predominance of deficit TCD 4 +-lymphocytes, an activation of the humoral component against a background of a decrease of the major classes of immunoglobulins. The development of <b>chronic</b> purulent <b>sinusitis</b> occurs against a background of the immune suppressant profile with a prevalent depression of the cellular link. The formation of <b>chronic</b> polypous <b>sinusitis</b> is associated with an activated profile of the humoral immune response in terms of reduced cellular immune deficiency and a deficit of nonspecific resistance factors.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{validate}} the usefulness of Functional Endoscopic Sinus Surgery (FESS) for the treatment of <b>Chronic</b> Maxillary <b>Sinusitis</b> of Dental Origin (CMSDO). Methods. A group of 12 patients treated with FESS in association with endodontic surgery for CMSDO was retrospectively compared to a control group of 12 patients who underwent a surgical procedure according to Caldwell-Luc.
