40|$|The {{kinetics}} and {{mechanism of}} oxidation of metformin hydrochloride (MET) with sodium N-chlorobenzenesulfonamide or <b>chloramine</b> <b>B</b> {{have been investigated}} in alkaline medium at 308 K. The reaction rate shows a first order dependence of rate each on CAB 0 and MET 0, and an inverse-first order dependence on OH. The stoichiometry of the reaction {{is found to be}} in the mole ratio of 1 : 1. The oxidation products are characterized as metformin N-oxide by GC-MS data. Activation parameters have been computed from the Arrhenius plot. The conjugate acid (PhSO 2 NHCI) is postulated as the reactive oxidizing species. The observed experimental results have been justified by a plausible reaction mechanism and the related kinetic rate law has been devised...|$|E
40|$|The {{kinetics}} of oxidn. of allyl and crotyl alcs. by sodium N-chlorobenzenesulfonamide or <b>chloramine</b> <b>B</b> (CAB) {{in presence}} of hydrochloric acid (0. 06 - 0. 26 M) {{has been studied}} at 0 Â°. The rate of reaction is first order in [CAB], independent of substrate concn. and is first order {{with respect to the}} gross concn. of HCl (0. 06 - 0. 12 M), which changes to second order at higher acidities (0. 15 - 0. 26 M). Chloride ion catalyzes the oxidn. Ionic strength and addn. of the reaction product, benzenesulfonamide, have negligible influence on the rate. The effect of changes in dielec. const. of the medium on the reaction rate has been studied. Activation parameters for the reaction have been calcd. H 2 OCl+ interacts with the alcs. forming a chloronium complex which loses a proton giving a hypochlorite which undergoes proton abstraction to form the conjugated. oxidn. products allyl and crotyl aldehydes.

The reaction rate shows first-order dependence each on CAB], hydroxy acid] and Pd(II) ] and a fractional-order dependence on H+]. Additions of chloride ions, perchlorate ions and the reduction product of CAB, benzenesulfonamide (BSA), {{have no effect on}} the reaction rate. Variations of ionic strength and dielectric permittivity of the medium have no effect on the rate. Activation parameters have been evaluated. A mechanism consistent with kinetic data is proposed. A Taft linear free-energy relationship is observed for the reaction with rho(*) = - 3. 593, indicating an increase in the rate with the presence of electron-donating substituents. An isokinetic relationship is observed with = 376 K, indicating the effect of enthalpy factors on the rate...|$|R
40|$|Macrophage {{deactivation}} factor (MDF) in P 815 tumor cell-conditioned medium was assayed by its {{suppression of}} the ability of activated mouse peritoneal macrophages to release hydrogen peroxide. MDF displayed properties of a soluble protein(s) associated with both low (8 - 25, 000) and high (greater than 450, 000) Mr fractions. MDF was purified 6, 140 - fold by a seven-step procedure: extraction with acid-ethanol; precipitation with ether; and fractionation on gel filtration, anion- exchange, diphenyl reversed-phase and C 4 reversed-phase HPLC columns, the last column twice. The final preparation contained two species: (a) a approximately 13, 000 Mr band on reducing or nonreducing SDS-PAGE and on autoradiograms after radioiodination with <b>chloramine</b> T, and (<b>b)</b> a 66, 000 Mr species ranging from approximately 5 % to approximately 50 % of the protein detectable by silver strain. The 66, 000 Mr species was identified as albumin from its NH 2 -terminal amino acid sequence. However, no amino acid sequence could be obtained for the approximately 13, 000 Mr species, either in fluid phase or after electroelution of the corresponding SDS-PAGE band. Thus, approximately 13, 000 Mr MDF associates tightly with albumin {{through a variety of}} separation techniques, and may have a blocked NH 2 terminus. Purified MDF afforded 50 % inhibition of activated macrophage H 2 O 2 releasing capacity at a concentration of 1 - 10 nM. Separation of MDF from most higher Mr moieties was associated with disproportionately small increases in specific activity, suggesting MDF might be partially inactivated by purification. As purified, MDF was approximately 1, 000 -fold less potent at deactivating macrophages than TGF-beta. Antibodies that neutralized the macrophage-deactivating effect of TGF-beta did not inhibit deactivation by MDF...|$|R
40|$|Our methodological {{procedure}} established successful {{technique of}} the direct dying of elastic fibers and lamellas in elastic tissues. Experiments were carried out on a human autopsy material. Blocks rich in elastic fibers were fixed by 10 % buffered neutral formaline and cut in the thickness of 5 mm. Deparaffinization of slides is done by xylol treatment (2 x 15 min). Additional denaturation is achieved by combined solution, which contains 1. 2 g of picric acid in 30 % solution of glacial acetic acid. By <b>chloramine</b> <b>B</b> application as blocking agent in form of 1 % DMSO solution the dye's affinity for eviromental tissue is decreased. Tissues prepared in this way are treated with 0. 5 % solution of acidic sulfonic color Evans Blue (C. I. 23860) in ratio 2 : 1. Lamellas are dark violet with light violet periphery. Obtained results {{are in favor of}} high applicability of this method in light microscopy. In our opinion, this method can be recommended as one of the methods for identification of elastic tissues...|$|E
