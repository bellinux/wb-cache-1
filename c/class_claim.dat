40|$|The present paper aims {{to propose}} a schema for {{analysing}} the contemporary politics of national and ethnic identity in post-colonial and post-socialist states. To this end it will seek: (a) to provide a comprehensive operational definition of nationalism, (b) to qualify that definition {{by the addition of}} the adjective ‘ethnic,' (c) to assess {{the extent to which the}} concept ‘ethnic nationalism' can help us to understand some of the politics of ethnicity and national identity in a post-independence setting, and (d) to problematize the notion of ‘false consciousness' in ethno-national political appeals. My argument will be situated within the broad theoretical framework of a non-reductionist, neo-Marxist class analysis, for it is my conviction that ethno-national consciousness and politics are better understood if we are able to trace the concrete class interests and motives of their promoters. In other words, whether as sentiment or as movement, nationalism cannot be divorced from the class interests of its leading promoters. But one must be cautious when absolutizing the <b>class</b> <b>claim,</b> for in the specific case of ethnic nationalism, for example, Robin Williams has noted that "to dismiss ethnicity as false consciousness ignores the clear evidence that ethnies often sacrifice economic interests in favour of symbolic gains" (1994 : 64 - 65), and even beyond this, as Ronaldo Munck reminds us, "nationalism matters because people die for it" (1986 : 2). ...|$|E

50|$|The {{area covered}} by the {{agreement}} was declared off-limits to soldiers of both countries. The agreement also stipulated that no settlers would be permitted in the Neutral Ground. Nevertheless, settlers from New Spain and the United States territory began to move in. After the area was recognized {{as a part of}} the United States, these settlers were granted third <b>class</b> homestead <b>claims.</b> (Those with Spanish land grants predating the sale of the Louisiana Purchase to the United States were granted first <b>class</b> <b>claims.)</b> Some of the settlers from the United States would form the nucleus of the Louisiana Redbone community. This lawless area also attracted exiles, deserters, political refugees, fortune hunters, and a variety of criminals. Eventually, the highwaymen organized to the degree that they manned outposts and organized spies in order to better fleece travelers and avoid the American and Spanish military. In 1810 and again in 1812 the two governments sent joint military expeditions into the area to expel outlaws.|$|R

40|$|Although {{they promise}} better {{deterrence}} {{at a lower}} cost, class actions are infected with problems that can keep them from delivering on this promise. One of these problems occurs when the agents for the class (the class representative and class counsel) advance their own interests {{at the expense of}} the class. Controlling agency cost, which often manifests itself at the time of settlement, has been the impetus behind a number of class-action reform proposals. This Article develops a proposal that, in conjunction with reforms in fee structure and opt-out rights, controls agency costs at the time of settlement. The idea is to allow the court, once a settlement has been achieved, to put the <b>class’s</b> <b>claims</b> up for auction, with the settlement acting as reserve price. An entity that outbids the settlement becomes owner of the <b>class’s</b> <b>claims,</b> and may continue to pursue the case against the defendant. A successful auction results in more compensation for the class. On the other hand, if no bids are received, the court has evidence that the settlement was fair. The prospect of a settlement auction also deters class counsel and the defendant from negotiating a sweetheart deal that sells out the class. The Article works through a series of theoretical and practical issues of settlement auction, including the standards that a court should use to evaluate bids, the limitations on who may bid, and the ways to encourage the emergence of an auction market...|$|R

Marx himself later in his life acknowledged that the middle class was not disappearing, in his work Theories of Surplus Value. However, due to {{the popularity of the}} Communist Manifesto and the obscurity of Theories of Surplus Value, Marx's acknowledgement of this error is not well known.|$|R

40|$|When Congress {{expanded}} the remedies available to Title VII {{the plaintiffs in}} the Civil Rights Act of 1991 to include compensatory and punitive damages, it {{did not realize that}} it was creating a minefield for certifying would-be Title VII class actions. The Fifth Circuit thoroughly explored many of the new pitfalls and hazards in its landmark opinion in Allison v. Citgo Petroleum Corp. This article attempts to critically evaluate a recent post-Allison trend whereby Title VII plaintiffs seeking class certification have foregone their claims for compensatory damages while still seeking punitive damages. Plaintiffs, relying on the Supreme Court 2 ̆ 7 s recent cases concerning punitive damages, argue that a class-wide claim for punitive damages brought in a mandatory Rule 23 (b) (2) class provides the best procedural mechanism for protecting the defendant 2 ̆ 7 s due process rights, while assuring that each plaintiff gets his or her fair share of the punitive damages pot. In developing its jurisprudence, as to the constitutional requirements of due process in awarding punitive damages, the Supreme Court showed no intent to thwart the will of Congress to allow Title VII plaintiffs to pursue <b>class</b> <b>claims</b> for punitive damages. Until a decision of the Court clarifies the limits of due process upon Title VII <b>class</b> <b>claims</b> for punitive damages, plaintiffs and defendants in such actions must litigate in a minefield where class certification, and the course of proceedings for any such class actions that are certified, is uncertain at best and arbitrary at worst...|$|R
40|$|Aggregate litigation’s {{potential}} {{as a tool for}} the disempowered is not being realized. Class actions have come under serious attack in the last decade as critics have successfully worked to change traditional notions of victimhood. The leading narrative identifies big businesses as the vulnerable prey needing protection from large <b>class</b> <b>claims</b> and the greedy class actions attorneys who bring them. Relying on this narrative, courts and Congress have made class actions harder to pursue, from filing and class certification to settlement approval. Vulnerability theory offers an alternative framework to rehabilitate class actions. From this perspective, the legal system currently disadvantages consumers. Without more balanced class action procedures, these vulnerable subjects have little realistic economic means to judicial access. This, in turn, further empowers corporate defendants by under-enforcement of the substantive legal theories most-often pursued as <b>class</b> <b>claims,</b> impacting overall social and economic well-being. The ambitious goal of this Article is to describe vulnerability theory and its intersection with class actions. Part I provides a foundational understanding of vulnerability theory. Part II maps out a narrative shift in the legal literature that downplays class actions as a way to empower the unempowered and instead emphasizes the need to protect potential defendants. Part III highlights how battles over narratives have consequences. In class actions, the narrative shift means courts are ignoring the disadvantages consumers face in bringing claims, including financial, informational, and judicial favoritism challenges. Part IV, using vulnerability theory, explain how class actions offer consumers resiliency tools. Enhancing these resiliency tools provides a new direction for class action reform that redefines prey and predator...|$|R
