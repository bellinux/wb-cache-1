The readers use a pre-made rubric to assess the answers and normally grade only one question in a given exam. Each question is graded on a scale from 0 to 4, with a 4 representing the most <b>complete</b> <b>response.</b> Communication and clarity in the answers receive a lot of emphasis in the grading.|$|E

25|$|IL-2 (Proleukin) was {{the first}} new therapy {{approved}} (1990 Europe, 1992 USA) {{for the treatment of}} metastatic melanoma in 20 years. Studies have demonstrated that IL-2 offers the possibility of a complete and long-lasting remission in this disease, although only in a small percentage of patients.

25|$|The first {{treatment}} involves adoptive {{cell therapy}} (ACT) using TILs immune cells (tumor infiltrating lymphocytes) isolated from a person's own melanoma tumor.

40|$|Achievement of <b>complete</b> {{molecular}} <b>response</b> {{in patients}} with chronic phase chronic myeloid leukemia has been recognized as an important milestone in therapy cessation and treatment-free remission; the identification of predictors of <b>complete</b> molecular <b>response</b> in these patients is, therefore, important. This study evaluated <b>complete</b> molecular <b>response</b> rates in imatinib-treated chronic phase chronic myeloid leukemia patients with major molecular response by using the international standardization for quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis of the breakpoint cluster region-Abelson 1 gene. The correlation of <b>complete</b> molecular <b>response</b> with various clinical, pharmacokinetic, and immunological parameters was determined. <b>Complete</b> molecular <b>response</b> was observed in 75 / 152 patients (49. 3 %). In the univariate analysis, Sokal score, median time to major molecular response, ABCG 2 421 C>A, and regulatory T cells were significantly lower in chronic phase chronic myeloid leukemia patients with <b>complete</b> molecular <b>response</b> than in those without <b>complete</b> molecular <b>response.</b> In the multivariate analysis, duration of imatinib treatment (odds ratio: 1. 0287, P= 0. 0003), time to major molecular response from imatinib therapy (odds ratio: 0. 9652, P= 0. 0020), and ABCG 2 421 C/C genotype (odds ratio: 0. 3953, P= 0. 0284) were independent predictors of <b>complete</b> molecular <b>response.</b> In contrast, number of natural killer cells, BIM deletion polymorphisms, and plasma trough imatinib concentration were not significantly associated with achieving a <b>complete</b> molecular <b>response.</b> Several predictive markers for achieving <b>complete</b> molecular <b>response</b> were identified in this study.

40|$|Patients {{with chronic}} myeloid leukemia, treated with imatinib, {{who have a}} durable <b>complete</b> {{molecular}} <b>response,</b> might remain in <b>complete</b> molecular <b>response</b> after stopping treatment. Previous reports of patients stopping treatment in <b>complete</b> molecular <b>response</b> have included only patients with a good response to imatinib. We describe 3 patients with stable <b>complete</b> molecular <b>response</b> on dasatinib treatment following imatinib failure. Two of the 3 patients remain in <b>complete</b> molecular <b>response</b> more than 12 months after stopping dasatinib. In these 2 patients we used highly sensitive patient-specific BCR-ABL 1 DNA PCR {{to show that the}} leukemic clone remains detectable, as we have previously shown in imatinib-treated patients. Dasatinib-associated immunological phenomena, such as the emergence of clonal T-cell populations, were observed both in one patient who relapsed and in one patient in remission.

25|$|No new {{guidelines}} dealing specifically with HPV+OPC have yet been developed, outside of clinical trials. Indirect data suggests {{the efficacy of}} less intense treatment. A retrospective analysis of advanced (N+) HPV+OPC suggested 96% 5 year local control with deintensified radiation of 54Gy and concurrent cisplatin based chemotherapy. The conclusions of the above pair of similar phase II trials have been supported by several other phase II trials. A prospective trial (ECOG 1308) demonstrated similar locoregional control with 54Gy., and another study, a high pathological <b>complete</b> <b>response</b> rate at 60Gy. These studies all used well below the previous standard dose of 70Gy. Since long term toxicity is associated with radiation dose, determining the efficacy of lower and hence less morbid doses of radiation is a priority, since many HPV+ patients {{can be expected to}} have long term survival.|$|E

2500|$|Current {{consensus}} is that the long-term prognosis of c-SCLC patients {{is determined by the}} SCLC component of their tumor, given that [...] "pure" [...] SCLC seems to have the worst long-term prognosis of all forms of lung cancer.

40|$|The {{choice of}} test in phase II cancer trials {{assessing}} continuous tumour shrinkage when <b>complete</b> <b>responses</b> are expected James MS Wason and Adrian P Mander Traditionally, phase II cancer trials test a binary endpoint formed from a dichotomisation of the continuous change in tumour size. Directly testing the continuous endpoint provides considerable gains in power, although also results in several statistical issues. One such issue is when <b>complete</b> <b>responses,</b> i. e. <b>complete</b> tumour removal, are observed in multiple patients; {{this is a}} problem when normality is assumed. Using simulated data and a recently published phase II trial, we investigate how the choice of test affects the operating characteristics of the trial. We propose using parametric tests based on the censored normal distribution, comparing them to the t-test and Wilcoxon non-parametric test. The censored normal distribution fits the real dataset well, but simulations indicate its type-I error rate is inflated, and its power is only slightly higher than the t-test. The Wilcoxon test has deflated type I error. For two-arm designs, the differences are much smaller. We conclude that the t-test is suitable for use when <b>complete</b> <b>responses</b> are present, although positively skewed data can result in the non-parametric test having higher power...|$|R
