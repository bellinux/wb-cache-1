30|$|However, in 3  mm of deflection, {{which was}} the highest tested, the CB showed higher forces than the SLB.

40|$|Block {{copolymers}} {{that combine}} a side-group liquid crystalline polymer (SGLCP) block and a pH-responsivehydrophilic block, poly(acrylic acid) (PAA), are shown to confer pH-dependent anchoring {{of the director}} orientation at the aqueous/LC interface. The SGLCP block, poly(4 -cyanobiphenyl- 4 -oxyundecylacrylate), was chosen based {{on its ability to}} influence the director field of the 5 CB (4 -cyano- 4 '-pentylbiphenyl). At low pH the PAA block collapses and the inherent, planar alignment tendency of 5 CB at a water interface prevails. As pH increases, the polyelectrolyte block becomes increasingly charged and expands, producing a change to homeotropic anchoring. The change in anchoring occurs as quickly as the buffer can be changed (within 2 s) and is reversible, with a response that is repeatable over as many cycles as were tested (approximately 20 cycles). The polymer-mediated anchoring persists for 6 days, indicating that the SGLCP block secures the self-assembled layer on the 5 <b>CB,</b> <b>even</b> under conditions that cause repulsive interactions among the PAA blocks. Thus, SGLCP blocks can translate conformational changes of a responsive hydrophilic block into rapid, reversible changes in the director fiel...|$|R

40|$|The {{spontaneous}} and energy-releasing reaction of protein aggregation is typically prevented by cellular quality control machinery (QC). TRIM 32 {{is a member}} of the TRIM (tripartite motif-containing) ubiquitin E 3 ligases, and when overexpressed in cultured cells, readily forms spherical inclusions designated as cytoplasmic bodies (<b>CBs)</b> <b>even</b> without proteasome inhibition. Here, we show that HSP 70, a central QC component, is a primary binding factor of overexpressed TRIM 32. Contrary to expectation, however, we find that this molecular chaperone facilitates and stabilizes CB assembly depending on intrinsic ATPase activity, rather than preventing CB formation. We also show that the HSP 70 -TRIM 32 complex is biochemically distinct from the previously characterized 14 - 3 - 3 -TRIM 32 phospho-complex. Moreover, the two complexes have opposing roles, with HSP 70 stimulating CB formation and 14 - 3 - 3 retaining TRIM 32 in a diffuse form throughout the cytosol. Our results suggest that CB inclusion formation is actively controlled by cellular QC and requires ATP, similar to protein folding and degradation reactions...|$|R
40|$|Aim: To compare stress, morale, and {{intended}} job turnover in staff in non-congregate settings where the minority of residents had CB and congregate settings {{where the majority}} of residents had CB. Method: A self-completion survey questionnaire was used to collect information on the characteristics of staff, staff stress, job satisfaction, and propensity to leave employment. Information was also collected on the characteristics and working practices of settings. Results: There were few significant differences between non-congregate and congregate settings. Over 25 % of staff reached criterion on the GHQ- 12 for experiencing emotional distress. Over 33 % were likely to seek new employment in the next year. The greatest sources of stress were lack of resources and lack of staff support, not service user CB. Lowest satisfaction was with rate of pay. Those in non-congregate settings reported greater stress due to lack of procedures to deal with CB. Conclusions: High levels of staff intended turnover are due more to job insecurity and lack of support than service user <b>CB,</b> <b>even</b> in settings {{where the majority of}} residents display CB.

30|$|BCSs and CB do {{not prevent}} from classic {{spoofing}} attacks [184] (presenting fake physical biometrics). However, {{there are other}} possibilities to detect fake biometric inputs (e.g., liveness detection [185]) which can be integrated in both technologies, the same holds for replay attacks. Performing substitution attacks to BCSs is more difficult compared to conventional biometric systems since biometric templates are either bound to cryptographic keys or used to extract helper data (the original biometric template is discarded). Substitution attacks against BCSs require additional knowledge (e.g., of bound keys in case of key-binding schemes). In case of CB substitution, attacks are feasible if impostors are in possession of secret transform parameters or secret keys within approaches to biometric salting. Both technologies are more resilient to masquerade attacks [10, 186]. Since reconstruction of original biometric templates should not be feasible the synthetization of original biometric inputs is highly complicated (e.g., [187]). Performance rates of both technologies decrease compared to conventional biometric systems which makes BCSs and <b>CB</b> <b>even</b> more vulnerable to false acceptance attacks. In contrast to CB, overriding final yes/no responses in a tampering scenario is hardly feasible within BCSs as these return a key instead of binary decisions (intermediate score-based attacks could still be applied [188]).|$|R
40|$|The {{discovery}} of fullerene, carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and graphene has impacted very positively in the electrochemical field. The presence of CNTs or graphene {{on the surface}} of working electrodes can improve the electron transfer between the surface of modified electrodes obtaining improved analytical performances. Because of advantages of these nanomaterials, various procedures have been developed to produce these nanoscale materials, although sometimes {{it is not easy to}} obtain high yields, or concerning graphene, to get one single sheet (pristine) rather than few layers. During recent years another interesting carbonaceous material, but less noble if compared with the previous ones, is becoming interesting for its excellent characteristics and electrocatalytic properties: Carbon Black nanoparticles (CB). CB finds applications as sensitive and filler material, and it is cost‐effective (about 1 euro/kg). The advantage to use CB for analyte detection was demonstrated by our research group [1], then several investigations carried out by us and by other groups have confirmed its excellent electrocatalytic properties of CB. In this work a comparative study using Screen‐Printed Electrodes (SPEs) modified by drop casting with CB, Single Walled Carbon Nanotubes–COOH, Graphene Oxide, and reduced Graphene Oxide is reported. The carbon nanomaterials employed were characterised by X‐ray photoelectron and Raman spectroscopy, while the modified SPEs have been morphologically and electrochemically characterized. Nanoengineered SPEs have been tested with ferricyanide, NADH, ascorbic acid and cysteine in cyclic voltammetry observing a reduced overpotential. Furthermore, the CB‐SPE was also tested with NADH, ascorbic acid and cysteine in amperometric mode reaching a detection limit of 1 μM for the analytes tested.

This evidence is inconsistent with the hypothesis of attributing the long-run under-performance of CB issuers to the failure of matched-firm technique to provide a proper control for the dynamics of systematic risk surrounding the issuance. Consequently, our findings give additional support to the “under-reaction” hypothesis. On the other hand, both idiosyncratic and total risk increase significantly in the period following a CB issue.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{test the}} {{effectiveness}} of an integrative psychotherapeutic nursing home program (integrative reactivation and rehabilitation [IRR]) to reduce multiple neuropsychiatry symptoms (MNPS) of cognitively impaired patients and caregiver burden (CB). DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial. SETTING: Psychiatric-skilled nursing home (IRR) and usual care (UC), consisting {{of different types of}} nursing home care at home or in an institution. PARTICIPANTS: N = 168 (81 IRR and 87 UC). Patients had to meet classification of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition for dementia, amnestic disorders, or other cognitive disorders. Further inclusion criteria: Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) >/= 3; Mini-Mental State Examination >/= 18 and /= 5 and </= 19. INTERVENTION: IRR consisted of a person-oriented integrative psychotherapeutic nursing home program to reduce MNPS of the patient and CB. UC consisted of different types of nursing home care at home or in an institution, mostly emotion oriented. MEASUREMENTS: Primary outcome variable was MNPS (number and sum-severity of NPI). Furthermore, burden and competence of caregiver were also measured. ASSESSMENTS: T 1 (inclusion), T 2 (end of treatment), T 3 (after 6 months of follow-up). Cohen's d (Cd) was calculated for mean differences (intention to treat). For confounding, repeated measurement modeling (random regression modeling [RRM]) was applied. RESULTS: In the short term {{from the perspective of the}} caregiver, IRR showed up to 34 % surplus effects on MNPS of the patients; NPI symptoms: 1. 31 lower (Cd, - 0. 53); and NPI sum- severity: 11. 16 lower (Cd, - 0. 53). In follow-up, the effects were sustained. However, from the perspective of the nursing team, these effects were insignificant, although the trend was in the same direction and correlated significantly with the caregiver results over time (at T 3 : r = 0. 48). In addition, IRR showed surplus effects (up to 36 %) on burden and competence of caregiver: NPI emotional distress: 3. 78 (Cd, - 0. 44); CB: 17. 69 (Cd, - 0. 63) lower; and Competence: 6. 26 (Cd, 0. 61) higher. In follow-up, the effects increased up to 50 %. RRM demonstrated that the effects were stable. CONCLUSION: From the perspective of the caregiver, IRR was significantly more effective than UC to reduce MNPS in cognitively impaired patients and CB. In follow-up, the effect on <b>CB</b> <b>even</b> increased. However, from the perspective of the nursing team, the effects on MNPS were statistically insignificant. Nevertheless, the trend was in the same direction and correlated significantly with the caregiver results over time.

40|$|Despite the {{importance}} of change detection (CD) for visual perception and for performance in our environment, observers often miss changes that should be easily noticed. In the present study, we employed time–frequency analysis to investigate the neural activity associated with CD and change blindness (CB). Observers were resented with two successive visual displays and had {{to look for a}} change in orientation in any one of four sinusoid gratings between both displays. Theta power increased widely over the scalp after the second display when a change was consciously detected. Relative to nochange and CD, CB was associated with a pronounced theta power enhancement at parietal-occipital and occipital sites and broadly distributed alpha power suppression during the processing of the prechange display. Finally, power suppressions in the beta band following the second display show that, even when a change is not consciously detected, it might be represented to a certain degree. These results showthe potential of time–frequency analysis to deepen our knowledge of the temporal curse of the neural events underlying CD. The results further reveal that the process resulting in <b>CB</b> begins <b>even</b> before the occurrence of the change itself.

2500|$|The Carmina Burana {{contains}} numerous poetic {{descriptions of}} a raucous medieval paradise (CB 195–207, 211, 217, 219), {{for which the}} ancient Greek philosopher Epicurus, known for his advocation of the blissful life, is even taken as an authority on the subject (CB 211). CB 219 describes, for example, an ordo vagorum (vagrant order) to which people from every land and clerics of all rankings were invited—even presbyter cum sua matrona, or [...] "a priest with his lady wife" [...] (humorous because Catholic priests must swear an oath of celibacy). <b>CB</b> 215 <b>even</b> {{provides an example of}} the religious rites of this order, the Officium lusorum, the [...] "Service", or [...] "Mass", [...] "of the Gamblers".

40|$|The {{expression}} {{pattern of}} aromatase (ARO), the enzyme converting androgens to estrogens, was analyzed in the olfactory bulb of adult male rats and was {{compared with the}} distribution of estrogen receptor beta (ER beta), the main estrogen receptor isoform expressed in this brain region. A strong ARO immunolabeling obtained with a specificity tested antibody was observed in juxtaglomerular neurons of the glomerular layer and a weaker immunoreaction was detected in the mitral cell layer of the main olfactory bulb, while the granule cell layer of the main olfactory bulb {{as well as all}} layers in the accessory olfactory bulb showed faint immunolabeling. Fluorescence double labeling experiments revealed that ARO detected in juxtaglomerular neurons of the main olfactory bulb colocalized with tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and glutamic acid decarboxylase 67 (GAD 67), while no colocalization between ARO and the calcium binding proteins calretinin (CR) and calbindin (CB) was observed. Furthermore, the TH immunoreactive neurons expressed metabotropic glutamate receptor 1 (mGluR 1) too. ER beta immunoreactivity, in contrast to ARO, was detected in all layers of both the main and accessory olfactory bulb. In the glomerular layer of the main olfactory bulb it was expressed in TH and GAD 67 containing juxtaglomerular neurons, and it colocalized with CR, <b>CB</b> and <b>even</b> with glial fibrillary acidic protein too. Our morphological findings suggest that ARO expression is a novel feature of dopaminergic/GABAergic juxtaglomerular neurons in the adult rat main olfactory bulb, and raise the possibility that ARO activity may change in function of olfactory input via mGluR 1.

40|$|The {{isotropic}} phase {{dynamics of}} a system of 4 -n-hexyl- 4 '-cyano-biphenyl (6 CB) molecules has been studied by molecular dynamics computer simulations. We have explored the range of 275 - 330 K keeping the system isotropic, although supercooled under its nematic transition temperature. The weak rototranslational coupling allowed us to separately evaluate translational (TDOF) and orientational degrees of freedom (ODOF). Evidences of subdiffusive dynamics, more apparent at the lowest temperatures, are found in translational and orientational dynamics. Mean square displacement as well as self-intermediate center of mass and rotational scattering functions show a plateau, also visible in the orientational correlation function. According to the mode coupling theory (MCT), this plateau is the signature of the beta-relaxation regime. Three-time intermediate scattering functions reveal that the plateau is related to a homogeneous dynamics, more extended in time for the orientational degrees of freedom (up to 1 ns). The time-temperature superposition principle and the factorization property predicted by the idealized version of MCT hold, again for both kinds of dynamics. The temperature dependence of diffusion coefficient and orientational relaxation time is well described by a power law. Critical temperatures T(c) are 244 +/- 6 and 258 +/- 6 K, respectively, the latter is some 10 K below the corresponding experimental values. The different values of T(c) we obtained indicate that ODOF freezes earlier than TDOF. This appears due to the strongly anisotropic environment that surrounds a 6 <b>CB</b> molecule, <b>even</b> in the isotropic phase.
