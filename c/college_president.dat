40|$|This is a {{case study}} of one state's {{community}} <b>college</b> <b>presidents</b> as an organized power network. I examine community college leadership as a function of group or class interests and social and institutional environments. Institutional leadership is not seen as the efforts of a single leader in a single institution. This case study uses a Delphi survey and content analysis to explore the general and specific transmission mechanisms of class interests, structural dependence, and power networks. The Delphi survey examined class formation and interests through identifying the consensus ideology held by community <b>college</b> <b>presidents.</b> Content analysis of the minutes of a statewide community college presidents' organization identified collective presidential concerns and actions. Content analysis of the minutes of local community college district governing boards identified institutional decision making related to collective presidential interests. Together, the Delphi survey and content analyses led to interpretations regarding statewide structural dependence on community <b>college</b> <b>presidents</b> and their operating as an organized power network, both micro-level social mechanisms involved in system reproduction. I have drawn the following conclusions about community <b>college</b> <b>presidents</b> and institutional decision making (1) Community college leadership can be understood as the result of group or class interests. (2) Community <b>college</b> <b>presidents</b> are powerful and dominant actors in the community college system. (3) Community <b>college</b> <b>presidents</b> can be shown to have organized into elite power networks. (4) Community <b>college</b> <b>presidents</b> in this case study occupy central positions that have local governing boards, the state board, affiliated associations, and top administrators, {{to a greater or lesser}} degree, in structurally dependent positions. (5) Community <b>college</b> <b>presidents,</b> as a collective, shape institutional decisions across individual community colleges. (6) Community <b>college</b> <b>presidents,</b> as educational leaders of "democracy's colleges," do not embrace democratic mechanisms...|$|R

40|$|Community <b>college</b> <b>presidents</b> serving rural {{populations in}} the state of Oklahoma have been forced to take on new {{responsibilities}} related to institutional fundraising due to multiple economic challenges including continued budgetary shortfalls and limited resource allocation.

5|$|The Philaletheis Society (often {{shortened}} to Philaletheis or just Phil {{and founded}} as The Philalethean Society) {{is a student}} theatre group at Vassar College {{in the town of}} Poughkeepsie, New York, and the school's oldest student organization. Founded in December 1865, Phil began as a college literary society and its first leader was <b>college</b> <b>president</b> John Howard Raymond. Control of the organization was swiftly handed to the students and the group split into three chapters, each with a distinct focus. The group maintained its literary focus until the 1890s, by which point dramatic productions had taken over in popularity. The tradition of producing four and later three plays per year continued into the mid-twentieth century, but in 1958, the organization disbanded due to lack of interest. It was revived in 1975, first as an arm of student government and then as an independent student organization.|$|E

5|$|On October 15, 1937, Danville {{resident}} Emma Weisiger {{donated the}} land that comprises Constitution Square Historic Site to the Commonwealth of Kentucky in memory of her brother, John. The state made the land into a state park; it was originally called Old Public Square, then Constitutional Square. Using a combination {{of state and local}} funds, the Danville Chamber of Commerce and the local chapter of the American Legion began constructing replicas of the jail, courthouse, and meetinghouse that originally occupied the square. At the time of the park's dedication on April 20, 1942, it was dubbed the John G. Weisiger Memorial State Park. Later, the name was changed to Constitution Square State Shrine. At the time of the dedication ceremony, all non-essential construction projects in the U.S. had been halted by the War Production Board due to the country's entry into World War II, and renovations to the park's attractions had consequently ceased. Dedication speeches by Governor Keen Johnson and Centre <b>College</b> <b>president</b> Robert L. McLeod, Jr. contained reminders of the ongoing war and praise for the ideals of democracy. In addition, a plaque honoring the framers of the first Kentucky Constitution was dedicated by Louisville judge Lafon Allen and unveiled by Johnson's daughter, Judith, and Louise McDowell, a descendent of Judge Samuel McDowell, who presided over all ten constitutional conventions {{that took place in the}} original Constitution Square courthouse.|$|E
