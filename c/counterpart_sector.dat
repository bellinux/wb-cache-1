The NA-IS show a complete activity cycle of an institutional sector, moving from production to the generation and use of income for consumption or savings, capital transactions and, finally, acquisitions of financial assets and liabilities in detail financial instruments and <b>counterpart</b> <b>sector.</b> The NA-IS offer also financial statementswhich include stocks of financial assets and liabilities, revaluations and other changes in assets accounts that reconcile the operations with changes in the balance sheets. These results are valuable in the macroeconomic analysis of the various institutional sectors, from both a real and a financial perspective. ...|$|E

This comparison rests, {{for the most}} part, on financial measures of performance, and such a comparison provides much of the rationale for privatization of PSBs. In this paper, we attempt a comparison between PSBs and their private <b>sector</b> <b>counterparts</b> based on measures of productivity that use quantities of outputs and inputs. We employ two measures of productivity: Tornqvist and Malmquist total factor productivity growth.

Out {{of a total of}} four comparisons we have made, there are no differences in three cases, PSBs do better in two, and foreign banks in one.

We present a model where higher turbulence benefits decentralized firms because the value of local information and urgent action increases. Since turbulence rises in severe downturns, decentralized firms do relatively better. We show that the data support our model over alternative explanations such as recession-induced reduction in agency costs (due to managerial fears of bankruptcy) and changing coordination costs. Countries with more decentralized firms (like the US) weathered the 2008 09 Great Recession better: these organizational differences could account for about 16 % of international differences in post-crisis GDP growth...|$|R

40|$|The work {{motivation}} construct {{is central}} to the theory and practice of many social science disciplines. Yet, due to the novelty of validated measures appropriate for a deep cross-national comparison, studies that contrast different administrative regimes remain scarce. This study represents an initial empirical effort to validate the Public Service Motivation (PSM) instrument proposed by Kim and colleagues (2013) in a previously unstudied context. The two former communist countries analyzed in this dissertation—Belarus and Poland— followed diametrically opposite development strategies: a fully decentralized administrative regime in Poland and a highly centralized regime in Belarus. The employees (n = 677) of public and nonprofit organizations in the border regions of Podlaskie Wojewodstwo (Poland) and Hrodna Voblasc (Belarus) are the subjects of study. Confirmatory factor analysis revealed three dimensions of public service motivation in the two regions: compassion, self-sacrifice, and attraction to public service. The statistical models tested in this dissertation suggest that nonprofit sector employees exhibit higher levels of PSM than their public <b>sector</b> <b>counterparts.</b> Nonprofit <b>sector</b> employees also reveal a similar set of values and work attitudes across the countries. Thus, the study concludes that in terms of PSM, employees of nonprofit organizations constitute a homogenous group that exists atop the administrative regimes. However, the findings propose significant differences between public sector agencies across the two countries. Contrary to expectations, data suggest that organization centralization in Poland is equal to—or for some items even higher than—that of Belarus. We can conclude that the absence of administrative decentralization of service provision in a country does not necessarily undermine decentralized practices within organizations. Further analysis reveals strong correlations between organization centralization and PSM for the Polish sample. Meanwhile, in Belarus, correlations between organization centralization items and PSM are weak and mostly insignificant. The analysis indicates other factors beyond organization centralization that significantly impact PSM in both sectors. PSM of the employees in the studied region is highly correlated with their participation in religious practices, political parties, or labor unions as well as location of their organization in a capital and type of social service provided...|$|R

The Pissarides-Weber approach hypothesizes that data would reflect such underreporting as “excess food consumption”. Our results suggest informal sector members spend more than their formal <b>sector</b> <b>counterparts</b> with comparable reported income levels. Using this information, we estimate the average size of the true informal sector to be about 1. 25 times the official estimate.

Though it is now universally agreed that the public sector can be entrepreneurial just like its private <b>sector</b> <b>counterpart,</b> {{it is not clear what}} makes up the PSE construct.

The dimensions are based on the different roles the state plays in trying to optimally provide public value to its citizens. This study offers a conceptual definition that could more broadly represent PSE. As with any new concept, this conceptual framework still has to be tested for efficacy and be validated through future research...|$|R
