5|$|At {{this stage}} in his career, Smetana's command of the <b>Czech</b> {{language}} was poor. His generation of Czechs was educated in German, and he had difficulty expressing himself in what was supposedly his native tongue. To overcome these linguistic deficiencies he studied <b>Czech</b> grammar, and {{made a point of}} writing and speaking in <b>Czech</b> every day. He had become Chorus Master of the nationalistic Hlahol Choral Society soon after his return from Sweden, and as his fluency in the <b>Czech</b> language developed he composed patriotic choruses for the Society; The Three Riders and The Renegade were performed at concerts in early 1863. In March of that year Smetana was elected president of the music section of Umělecká Beseda, a society for <b>Czech</b> artists. By 1864 he was proficient enough in the <b>Czech</b> language to be appointed as music critic to the main <b>Czech</b> language newspaper Národní listy. Meanwhile, Bettina had given birth to another daughter, Božena.|$|E

50|$|Although <b>Czechs</b> are {{not one of}} Minnesota's larger ethnic groups, {{they were}} ranked seventh in 1910 with a {{population}} of 33,247. Nationwide and also in Minnesota, first- and second-generation <b>Czechs</b> pursued agricultural trades more than any other occupation in 1900. <b>Czechs</b> mainly lived in Le Sueur, Scott, and Rice counties. There were smaller pockets of <b>Czechs</b> elsewhere in the state, however, including Poplar Township of Roseau County.|$|R
50|$|As South Omaha's meatpacking {{industry}} grew, many <b>Czechs</b> {{moved from}} Bohemia Town to South Omaha, {{closer to their}} employment.

5|$|After leaving {{elementary}} school in 1893, Kafka {{was admitted to the}} rigorous classics-oriented state gymnasium, , an academic secondary school at Old Town Square, within the Kinský Palace. German was the language of instruction, but Kafka also spoke and wrote in <b>Czech.</b> He studied the latter at the gymnasium for eight years, achieving good grades. Although Kafka received compliments for his <b>Czech,</b> he never considered himself fluent in <b>Czech,</b> though he spoke German with a <b>Czech</b> accent.

50|$|The Young <b>Czechs</b> {{differed}} {{mostly from}} the Old <b>Czechs</b> in their active politics policies {{as opposed to the}} latter’s passive resistance policies. After 1874, the Young <b>Czechs</b> claimed to be the heirs of Karel Havlíček Borovský, a journalist and martyr who advocated Slavic reciprocity and criticized the authoritarian Russian government. This, in part, helped establish a “founding father” much like Palacký was to the Old <b>Czechs.</b> Establishing this historic base also provided historical support to the Party’s mission and ideology.|$|R
50|$|The {{supporters}} of the Young <b>Czechs</b> came from petty tradespeople, lawyers, progressive intellectuals, teachers and university students, some leaders in the Sokol gymnastic organization and middling farmers hurt by Hungarian and North American competition. Their followers believed in the liberal approach to the nationalist program prescribed by the Young <b>Czechs</b> rather than the more conservative approach of the Old <b>Czechs.</b>|$|R

5|$|<b>Czech</b> {{national}} opera {{until this}} {{time had been}} represented only by minor, rarely performed works. This opera, Smetana's second, {{was part of his}} quest to create a truly <b>Czech</b> operatic genre. Smetana's musical treatment made considerable use of traditional Bohemian dance forms such as the polka and furiant, and although he largely avoided the direct quotation of folksong he neverthess created music considered by Czechs to be quintessentially <b>Czech</b> in spirit.|$|E
5|$|Due to a suspension, Nedvěd {{missed the}} <b>Czech</b> Republic's quarter-final match against Portugal. The Czechs won {{in his absence}} and progressed.

50|$|In the 1860s many <b>Czechs,</b> {{primarily}} from Bohemia and Moravia, immigrated to Nebraska. Edward Rosewater and John Rosicky, early Omaha newspaper editors originally from Bohemia, encouraged countrymen {{to come by}} extolling promises of free land in frontier Nebraska. By 1880 <b>Czechs</b> were the most concentrated ethnic group in the city. Their major neighborhood was called Little Bohemia, and it stands with several historic businesses today. <b>Czechs</b> had a strong political and cultural voice in Omaha, and {{were involved in a}} variety of trades and businesses, including banks, wholesale houses, and funeral homes.

5000|$|The {{ancestors}} of the <b>Czechs</b> and Slovaks were united in the so-called [...] "Samo Empire" [...] for some thirty years in the seventh century. The {{ancestors of}} the Slovaks and Moravians were later united in Great Moravia between 833 and 907. The <b>Czechs</b> were only part of Great Moravia for some seven years before splitting from it in 895. Furthermore, {{in the second half}} of the tenth century, the <b>Czechs</b> conquered and controlled western Slovakia for around thirty years. This was the last time the two nations were united; the Hungarians had conquered Slovakia by the eleventh century, while the <b>Czechs</b> maintained their own principality (a kingdom since 1198) of Bohemia, from around 900 to 1919.|$|R
50|$|A much changed team {{under new}} manager Michal Bílek entered the Euro 2012 qualifiers. The {{campaign}} began disastrously {{with a home}} loss to Lithuania. But an important win at home to Scotland was followed by wins against Liechtenstein. World champions Spain defeated the <b>Czechs</b> in between the Liechtenstein games, but the play-off spot was still in their hands. In the next game, a controversial last minute penalty from Michal Kadlec away to Scotland secured a 2-2 draw. Despite Scotland winning their next two games and the <b>Czechs</b> again being defeated by Spain, the team could finish second if they could beat Lithuania away from home in the final game, assuming Spain would beat Scotland at home. Spain won 3-1 and the <b>Czechs</b> convincingly defeated Lithuania 4-1 to seal second spot and {{a place in the}} play-offs. The <b>Czechs</b> were drawn to face Montenegro in the two-legged play-off. A memorable goal from Václav Pilař and a last minute second from Tomáš Sivok helped the <b>Czechs</b> to a 2-0 first leg lead. In the second leg in Podgorica, a late goal from Petr Jiráček sealed a 1-0 win and the <b>Czechs</b> ran out 3-0 aggregate winners and qualified for Euro 2012.|$|R

The city remained a German-speaking enclave until 1880, after which <b>Czechs</b> became the majority. Until the end of World War II, the city contained a significant German minority (about 15.5% in 1930).

40|$|During {{the late}} nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, {{thousands}} of immigrants arrived in America from Europe. Along with some personal belongings, the immigrants carried with them across the Atlantic their customs, which helped perpetuate cultural conservation and slow assimilation. Many of these immigrants settled in the Great Plains, including the state of Nebraska. ^ In Saunders County, Nebraska, located in the eastern section of the state, most European immigrants were <b>Czechs,</b> Swedes, and Germans. Saunders County had the largest percentage of <b>Czechs</b> and Swedes in aggregate than any other county in Nebraska. Unlike the Germans, the <b>Czechs</b> and Swedes in the county maintained strong ethnic identities through 1910 and assimilated slowly. ^ By 1910, almost 50 percent of Saunders County 2 ̆ 7 s population were <b>Czechs</b> and Swedes. Despite their universal strength, both groups carved out separate clustered areas. Only in the town of Wahoo were there many <b>Czechs</b> and Swedes in the same community. In each of their clustered areas, there were a few small villages, but otherwise they were rural. ^ Clustering was the principal reason the <b>Czechs</b> and Swedes sustained their ethnic identities. Both groups clustered to help in the difficult transition into American society. In one precinct of Saunders County, 762 of the 763 people were <b>Czechs.</b> Both ethnic groups were also endogamous, which was fostered through clustering. Endogamy was a key factor for cultural conservation and maintaining ethnic identity. ^ The <b>Czechs</b> and Swedes in Saunders County utilized several tools to maintain strong ethnic identities, including religion, education and social and cultural organizations. Swedish Lutherans in Nebraska founded Luther Academy, in the county, in 1883. This school, which added a two-year college shortly after 1900, was established to train Swedish Lutheran students to teach and minister to fellow Swedish Lutherans. By 1910, both the <b>Czechs</b> and Swedes in Saunders County, Nebraska, had not only preserved their ethnic identities, but also managed to assimilate at a slow rate. ...|$|R
