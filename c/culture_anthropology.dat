5000|$|John Bowers {{was the son}} of Basil Bowers, {{headmaster}} of Cheltenham College Junior School, and {{was educated}} at Cheltenham College and Trinity College, Oxford. After postgraduate courses in Arabic, Islamic <b>Culture,</b> <b>Anthropology</b> and Law, he joined the Sudan Political Service in 1935. Three years later, he married Sheila Tinson, with whom he lived among the Dinka people of the southern Sudan. During World War II he was seconded to the Sudan Artillery Regiment, based at Kufra oasis. Later he fought in Ethiopia with the Upper Nile Scouts and in the Libyan desert, where he was badly wounded. An out-of-body experience during a subsequent operation gave Bowers a lifelong interest in mysticism. He was private secretary to Lord Moyne, the British Minister Resident in the Middle East, who was murdered by the Stern Gang in 1944. Following the war he joined UNESCO, at the request of Sir Julian Huxley, where he worked in adult education, agriculture and literacy in Africa, India, South-East Asia and Central America. Bowers was a vigorous supporter of the Third World through the United Nations. He inducted qualified educationists from the so-called Third World countries to the UNICEF, who later on contributed immensely to their respective countries in the field of education, such as Mushtaq Ahmed Azmi, who is considered as one of the pioneers in the field of Adult Education in India ...|$|E

50|$|The {{anthropology}} of religion involves {{the study of}} religious institutions {{in relation to other}} social institutions, and the comparison of religious beliefs and practices across <b>cultures.</b> Modern <b>anthropology</b> assumes that there is complete continuity between magical thinking and religion, and that every religion is a cultural product, created by the human community that worships it.|$|R
40|$|The {{concept of}} culture is {{traditionally}} the home turf of anthropologists. However, economists {{have become increasingly}} interested in culture, using the language of culture to study both macro- and micro-level economic phenomena.

This paper examines, from a philosophy of science perspective, the inherent differences between the disciplines of anthropology and economics that {{lie at the heart}} of this battle.

40|$|Annotation: The {{subject of}} this {{bachelor}} thesis is magical thinking in children of younger school age. The concept of magical thinking is defined in the theoretical part {{from the perspective of}} developmental psychology and <b>culture</b> <b>anthropology,</b> further the concept of magical thinking by Jean Piaget is introduced. His perspective is crucial for this thesis. The main objective of this research, which is based on my own empirical material, is to discover whether magical thinking is still present in the concepts of children of younger school age. Magical thinking (concepts of children) is used in contrast to realistic thinking (concepts of adults). Attention is given to analogical thinking, too. The data were collected by using methods of participant observation and semi-structured interviews. Findings of this research are compared with Piaget's conclusions. The result of this thesis is a characterization of thinking in first-grade pupils, categorization and definition of used principles of thoughts, description of aspects of magical, realistic and analogical thinking.

40|$|This peer-reviewed {{chapter is}} the first in the Surface Tensions volume, and sets out a {{theoretical}} and contextual rationale for the consideration of many aspects of surface, linking this to the chapters that follow. Like the anthology itself, the chapter considers surface under three headings: time and work; textiles and skin; depth and im/permeability – synthesising material from a broad theoretical literature to create new insights. The chapter's basic premise is that 'surface', whether defined in binary opposition to terms such as 'depth' or 'structure', or in more complex ways, is a crucial category in the analysis of designed objects, in the past or present, and particularly in their communicative qualities and their ongoing relationships with users. The book is interdisciplinary in nature, and fills an important gap in the literature on design and material culture. The proposal for it was assessed and peer-reviewed by two independent readers. The book itself is the final outcome of the Surface Tensions research network, which held two symposia events with papers given by researchers working in design history, material <b>culture,</b> <b>anthropology,</b> fashion and textile history and theory, and creative practice...|$|E
40|$|The {{brain and}} the nervous system are our most {{cultural}} organs. Our nervous system is especially immature at birth, our brain disproportionately small in relation to its adult size and open to cultural sculpting at multiple levels. Recognizing this, the new field of neuroanthropology places the brain {{at the center of}} discussions about human nature and <b>culture.</b> <b>Anthropology</b> offers brain science more robust accounts of enculturation to explain observable difference in brain function; neuroscience offers anthropology evidence of neuroplasticity’s role in social and cultural dynamics. This book provides a foundational text for neuroanthropology, offering basic concepts and case studies at the intersection of brain and culture. After an overview of the field and background information on recent research in biology, a series of case studies demonstrate neuroanthropology in practice. Contributors first focus on capabilities and skills [...] including memory in medical practice, skill acquisition in martial arts, and the role of humor in coping with breast cancer treatment and recovery [...] then report on problems and pathologies that range from post-traumatic stress disorder among veterans to smoking as a part of college social life. 438 page(s...|$|E
40|$|Book synopsis: In about 25 BC tribesmen of {{the kingdom}} of Meroe placed a bronze head of Augustus, cut from a {{full-length}} statue, beneath the steps of a temple of victory: the decapitated head of the Emperor was thus regularly trampled underfoot. Two millennia later, during the second Gulf War, Iraqis 'insulted' a toppled bronze statue of Saddam Hussein by beating it with their shoes. Do these chronologically distant but apparently related examples of the defamation of images imply that the persons represented were regarded by their detractors as in some way 'present' in the images? Presence: The Inherence of the Prototype within Images and Other Objects reconsiders the notion of 'presence' in objects. The first book to address the issue directly, it contains a series of case studies covering a broad geographical and chronological range from ancient Greece and the Incas to industrial America and contemporary India, as well as examples from the canon of western European art. The studies reveal the widespread evidence for this striking form of response and allow readers to see how 'presence' is evoked and either embraced or repressed in differing historical and cultural contexts. Featuring a variety of disciplines and approaches, the book will be of interest to students of art history, art theory, visual <b>culture,</b> <b>anthropology,</b> psychology and philosophy...|$|E
