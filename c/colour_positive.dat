50|$|Before digital chroma keying, bluescreening was {{accomplished}} using film. The camera colour negative was printed onto high-contrast {{black and white}} film, using either a filter or the colour sensitivity of {{the black and white}} film to limit it to the blue channel. Assuming this film was a negative it produced clear where the bluescreen was, black elsewhere, except it also produced clear for any white objects (since they also contained blue). Removing these spots could be done by a suitable double-exposure with the <b>colour</b> <b>positive,</b> and many other techniques. The end result was a clear background with an opaque shape of the subject in the middle. This is called a female matte, similar to an alpha matte in digital keying. Copying this film onto another high-contrast negative produced the opposite 'male matte'. The background negative was then packed with the female matte and exposed onto a final strip of film, then the camera negative was packed with the male matte was double-printed onto this same film. These two images combined together creates the final effect.|$|E
40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{dissertation}} was {{to provide}} a thorough description of the coronary microvasculature at different phases of cardiac contraction, during normal postnatal growth, and pathologically accelerated growth due to pressure and volume overloading. The histochemical technique used to visualize capillaries was novel in that it served to distinguish arteriolar and venular capillary regions by colour. Arteriolar capillary (AC) regions stained blue in <b>colour,</b> <b>positive</b> for the presence of Alkaline Phosphatase in the endothelium. Venular capillary (VC) regions stained red in <b>colour,</b> <b>positive</b> for the presence of Dipeptidyl Peptidase IV. The morphometric methods used to assess capillary geometry from cross and longitudinal tissue sections were classified according to AC and VC regions. From tissue cross sections, capillaries were represented as a bivariate (CV, blue; VC, red) point pattern in the tissue plane. Our software program for capillary domains served to divide the plane into polygonal regions of tissue, each polygon enclosing one capillary. The area subtended by each polygon, the capillary domain, was closer to the enclosed capillary than any other. From individual domain areas, the equivalent radius of the Krogh cylinder with the same area was calculated. As the distribution of these radii is log-normal, the variability was best characterized by the logarithmic standard deviation (SDlog). In this manner, SDlog, the heterogeneity of capillary spacing was determined. From longitudinal sections, scale drawings of capillary sets, which consisted of all the capillary pathways that could be clearly followed from the same terminal arteriole to collecting venule served as the basic unit of study. From these capillary sets, we have defined and measured several morphometric parameters, appropriate as indicators of geometrical conditions for oxygen supply. Among these parameters are the minimal capillary length, the shortest contiguous pathway from arteriole to venule; mean capillary length, the average length of all possible capillary paths from arteriole to venule; and capillary segment length, the distance between two successive capillary branch points. To illustrate the effect of changes in capillary geometry on myocardial oxygenation, we have chosen as an illustration, the results obtained from pressure overloaded hearts.

40|$|This paper {{notes the}} {{adoption}} of digital photography as a primary recording means within archaeology, and reviews some issues and problems that this presents. Particular attention {{is given to the}} problems of recording high-contrast scenes in archaeology and High Dynamic Range imaging using multiple exposures is suggested as a means of providing an archive of high-contrast scenes that can later be tone-mapped to provide a variety of visualisations. Exposure fusion is also considered, although it is noted that this has some disadvantages. Three case studies are then presented (1) a very high contrast photograph taken from within a rock-cut tomb at Cala Morell, Menorca (2) an archaeological test pitting exercise requiring rapid acquisition of photographic records in challenging circumstances and (3) legacy material consisting of three differently exposed <b>colour</b> <b>positive</b> (slide) photographs of the same scene. In each case, HDR methods are shown to significantly aid the generation of a high quality illustrative record photograph, and it is concluded that HDR imaging could serve an effective role in archaeological photographic recording, although there remain problems of archiving and distributing HDR radiance map data...|$|E

50|$|Anthropological {{research}} {{demonstrates that}} in contexts where breastfeeding {{is essential to}} infant survival, such as in resource poor settings, PMTCT infant feeding guidelines challenge notions of motherhood and women’s decision making power over infant care, and <b>colour</b> HIV <b>positive</b> mothers’ infant feeding experiences. In eastern Africa, infant mortality is high and breastfeeding is vital for infant survival. Here, motherhood {{is defined as the}} responsibility for ensuring the child’s proper growth and health. Breastfeeding is also seen as a cultural practice that helps create a social bond between mother and child. However, there is a disjuncture between PMTCT policy’s infant feeding guideline and what is considered to be good mothering behaviour. The PMTCT policy promotes replacement feeding because it is believed to prevent the risk of transmission of HIV. However, adhering to such guidelines are difficult for mothers in resource-limited settings who believe that not breastfeeding one’s child would be harmful to their health and survival, as well as threaten the “development of close bodily and emotional bonds between mother and child”. As such, not breastfeeding, for HIV-positive women, is perceived as failing to be a good mother. Thus, PMTCT programs impact HIV-positive women’s agency and decision-making in infant care, as well as challenge their cultural conceptions of good motherhood.|$|R

40|$|The 2 -colouring {{discrepancy}} of arithmetic progressions is {{a well-known}} problem in combinatorial discrepancy theory. In 1964, Roth proved that if each integer from 0 to N is coloured red or blue, there is some arithmetic progression in which the number of reds {{and the number of}} blues differ by at least (1 / 20) N^ 1 / 4. In 1996, Matousek and Spencer showed that this estimate is sharp up to a constant. The analogous question for homogeneous arithmetic progressions (i. e., the ones containing 0) was raised by Erdos in the 1930 s, and it is still not known whether the discrepancy is unbounded. However, it is easy to construct partial colourings with density arbitrarily close to 1 such that all homogeneous arithmetic progressions have bounded discrepancy. A related problem concerns the discrepancy of quasi-progressions. A quasi-progression consists of successive multiples of a real number, with each multiple rounded down to the nearest integer. In 1986, Beck showed that given any 2 -colouring, the quasi-progressions corresponding to almost all real numbers in (1, ∞) have discrepancy at least log* N, the inverse of the tower function. We improve the lower bound to (log N) ^ 1 / 4 - o(1), and also show that there is some quasi-progression with discrepancy at least (1 / 50) N^ 1 / 6.
