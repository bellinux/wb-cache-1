40|$|As part of {{a larger}} {{research}} project, we interviewed ten parents with refugee backgrounds about their experiences of contact with <b>child</b> <b>welfare</b> <b>services</b> in Norway. Despite parents describing both positive and negative experiences, and trust as well as distrust, we found that fear of the <b>child</b> <b>welfare</b> <b>services</b> was a central theme. Thematic analyses showed that fear of the <b>child</b> <b>welfare</b> <b>services</b> was not primarily related to the interviewees' own negative experiences, but to a variety of perceptions or representations of the <b>child</b> <b>welfare</b> <b>services</b> that informants described as common or prevalent among people from ethnic minorities in general. We found that the representations of the <b>child</b> <b>welfare</b> <b>services</b> could be categorized into the following themes: 1) <b>child</b> <b>welfare</b> <b>services</b> primarily take <b>children</b> away from parents, 2) <b>child</b> <b>welfare</b> <b>services</b> do not go into dialogue with parents, and 3) <b>child</b> <b>welfare</b> <b>services</b> discriminate against ethnic minority families. The analysis is discussed critically in light of Axel Honneth and Nancy Fraser's understandings of recognition and social justice. We suggest that the parents’ fear of the <b>child</b> <b>welfare</b> <b>services</b> can be understood as fear of experiencing humiliation and disrespect through contact with <b>child</b> <b>welfare</b> services; fear of losing their children, becoming invisible and being discriminated against. A key implication of the study is the need for further research that examines the fear of <b>child</b> <b>welfare</b> among people from ethnic minorities, as well as measures that address distrust of services in parts of the population...|$|R

5000|$|In Hungary {{the first}} teams to be {{involved}} in school social work were formed in the early 1990s. Their formation was based on the recognition of how important role schools might play in child and youth protection work (Gedeon 1996). On the other hand, teams benefited from the professional assistance members could offer each other. Social services provided by external experts were introduced in several schools at the same time. In a school located in District VII of Budapest school social work, which was launched in Autumn 1991, was rendered by a local child care centre. On the basis of this experience a team of school social workers was set up {{with the help of the}} local government in 1992. In District VIII it was also a child care centre that posted a school social worker to a local school. The social worker worked with groups of children with an underprivileged social background and organized summer camping for them. In 1993, in District XI the so-called Child Protection Group initiated child protection services. At the outset the group belonged to the Educational Service Centre, and later it was converted into a child welfare centre (Bányai 2009, Molnár 2009, Mihály 1991). It is important to distinguish the external model from the network of independent child protection workers mentioned earlier. The latter was also organized by an external body, but its superior was the educational department of the local government. [...] Probably the best-known experimental project carrying out [...] "external" [...] school social work was the [...] "Ferencváros" [...] Network of School Social Workers. The network was started in the Summer of 1992. Later it was renamed [...] "Ferencváros" [...] White Raven <b>Child</b> <b>Welfare</b> <b>Service.</b> In District IX of Budapest, the local government promoted the establishment of the <b>child</b> <b>welfare</b> <b>service</b> in 1992. The concept of the service was developed by dr Mihaly and her colleagues. The main principle on which they stood was the following: [...] "Child protection must be removed from schools, but it must not be handed over to the system of authorities. A child protection system independent form authorities has to be created" [...] (Dr Mihaly, 2008). It is a characteristic of the model that it takes the community surrounding the school including the network of supporting organizations into consideration. From the beginning they aspired to create and run a region-based child protection system. The social worker did not want to take up the child protection worker's duties. He/she focused on to play the role of a mediator, a co-ordinator, a [...] "catalyst". Working with pupils was reduced, since social workers were on duty at schools only once a week. His/her range of activities covered group work, organizing club sessions, summer camping and playrooms, offering homework help instead of doing case management for individuals. Furthermore, they worked with families and were entitled to offer them financial and in kind assistance as well. A structure of services different from that of the traditional school social work evolved due to the lack of modern child protection services and institutions providing customized care for clients in Hungary. Especially services offered to families to prevent children from being removed from their birth parents were not available. There were neither temporary homes for children nor basic child welfare services separated from the operation of authorities. [...] "Ferencváros" [...] <b>Child</b> <b>Welfare</b> <b>Service</b> attempted to fill this gap. The programme is well known. The expression: [...] "child welfare service" [...] was transplanted to the text of the Child Welfare Act that came into effect in November 1997. After the law came into effect the [...] "Ferencváros" [...] <b>Child</b> <b>Welfare</b> <b>Service</b> underwent a transformation: child welfare activities began to outweigh school social work, which was at the beginning of crucial importance. The Child Welfare Act created absolutely new conditions for the operation of the other networks of school social workers and child welfare services as well, since the already active groups of school social workers were assigned the tasks of child welfare services due to lack of financial resources on the side of local governments.|$|E
50|$|MISS ELLEN BARRON.whose death {{took place}} {{yesterday}} opened the first training school in child welfare nursing in Brisbane in 1923. The late Miss Barron, {{who was born}} in Berkshire, England, was educated at Oxford and Queensland, and trained at the Brisbane General Hospital. In the 1914-18 war she was stationed at Lemnos during the landing at Gallipoli, and she also served in Egypt and France. On her return from active service, she was appointed to the Valley Centre of the Maternal and Child Welfare Services, and in 1922 she was sent to New Zealand for six months to study child welfare under Sir Truby King. In 1928 the late Miss Barron was appointed superintendent of nurses, Maternal and <b>Child</b> <b>Welfare</b> <b>Service,</b> and retired in 1939. She was associated with the A.T.N.A.

During this time the Fortitude Valley Child Health Centre continued to operate as a baby clinic although the use of the entire building had somewhat diminished since the 1941 relocation of the administrative, training and residential functions. Consequently, little alteration has been made to the building fabric since then. In 1997, the directorate of Queensland Health's Oral Health Service moved into the building and in 2011 occupied the upper level and two offices on the ground level. Community Child Health Services continues to occupy the remainder of the ground level of the building.|$|E
