50|$|Introduced by {{a working}} group from the World Health Organization (WHO) in 1985, WHO {{diagnostic}} criteria states that CSE can occur in three stages, organic affective syndrome (type I), mild <b>chronic</b> <b>toxic</b> <b>encephalopathy</b> (type II), and severe <b>chronic</b> <b>toxic</b> <b>encephalopathy</b> (type III). Shortly after, a workshop in Raleigh-Durham, NC (United States) released a second diagnostic criterion which recognizes four stages as symptoms only (type 1), sustained personality or mood swings (type 2A), impairment of intellectual function (type 2B), and dementia (type 3). Though not identical, the WHO and Raleigh criteria are relatively comparable. WHO type I and Raleigh types 1 and 2A are believed to encompass the same stages of CSE, and WHO type II and Raleigh type 2B both involve deficiencies in memory and attention. No other international classifications for CSE have been proposed, and neither the WHO nor Raleigh criteria have been uniformly accepted for epidemiological studies.|$|E
5000|$|... "Encephalopathy" [...] is {{a general}} term {{describing}} brain malfunctions and [...] "toxic" [...] asserts that the malfunction is caused by toxins on the brain. The most prominent characteristic of toxic encephalopathy is an altered mental status. Acute intoxication is a reversible symptom of exposure to many synthetic chemical neurotoxicants. Acute intoxication symptoms include lightheadedness, dizziness, headache and nausea, and regular cumulative exposure to these toxic solvents {{over a number of}} years puts the individual at high risk for developing toxic encephalopathy. Chronic exposure to low levels of neurotoxic chemicals can also cause reversible changes in mood and affect which resolve with cessation of exposure. Acute and <b>chronic</b> <b>toxic</b> <b>encephalopathy</b> on the other hand, are persistent changes in neurological function that typically occur with exposure to higher concentrations and longer durations respectively. The symptoms of acute and <b>chronic</b> <b>toxic</b> <b>encephalopathy</b> do not resolve with cessation of exposure and can include memory loss, small personality changes/increased irritability, insidious onset of concentration difficulties, involuntary movements (parkinsonism), fatigue, seizures, arm strength problems, and depression. [...] Neurobehavioral effects of occupational exposure to organic solvents exists among painters. The condition may also be referred to as substance-induced persistent dementia.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{describe}} {{a case of}} possible <b>toxic</b> <b>encephalopathy</b> in a surgical patient receiving high-dose intravenous haloperidol. CASE SUMMARY: A 54 -year-old African-American man was admitted for spinal fusion. His medical history included bipolar disorder and a cerebrovascular accident. His recovery from surgery was complicated {{by the development of}} agitation, which was treated with increasing doses of intravenous haloperidol. An electroencephalogram was consistent with <b>toxic</b> <b>encephalopathy.</b> The patient's mental status returned to normal 8 days after discontinuation of haloperidol. DISCUSSION: High-dose intravenous haloperidol for severe agitation has been reported as an effective and safe treatment option for the hospitalized patient. We report the occurrence of <b>toxic</b> <b>encephalopathy</b> in a patient who received high-dose intravenous haloperidol. CONCLUSIONS: Caution should be used when high-dose intravenous haloperidol is used in an agitated patient. If the patient's clinical response is paradoxical to what is anticipated and the resulting agitation is mistakenly attributed to inadequate treatment, increasingly higher doses may only aid in the development of <b>toxic</b> <b>encephalopathy...</b>|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVES: The {{questionnaire}} 16 (Q 16) {{is commonly}} used to study prevalences of neurotoxic symptoms among workers exposed to organic solvents. It has also been recommended that exposed workers reporting more than six symptoms should be referred for further examination of possible <b>chronic</b> <b>toxic</b> <b>encephalopathy.</b> It {{would be useful to}} know whether symptoms reported in the questionnaire also reflect impairment of similar functions measured with objective or semiobjective methods in a formerly highly exposed group. METHODS: 135 painters and 71 carpenters answered the Q 16, were interviewed about symptoms compatible with an organic brain damage, and took a battery of psychometric tests. A subsample of 52 painters and 45 carpenters were interviewed for psychiatric diagnosis according to Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders, 3 rd version (DSM III) and their vibration thresholds in hands and feet were measured. The entire group was followed up in the register of diagnoses at early retirement 1971 - 93. The lifetime exposure to organic solvents was assessed. Current exposure to organic solvents was found to be low or none. RESULTS: The prevalence of people with more than six symptoms in the Q 16 rose with increasing cumulative exposure to solvents. The sensitivity of the questionnaire (more than six symptoms) to detect people who were assessed to exhibit symptoms compatible with an organic brain damage was only 38 %. One of seven people who had retired early with a diagnosis compatible with a <b>chronic</b> <b>toxic</b> <b>encephalopathy,</b> and two of five people with a psychiatric diagnosis compatible with this condition, had more than six symptoms in the Q 16. The agreement between Q 16 replies and psychometric test results, as well as other examinations, was low. CONCLUSIONS: The notable exposure-response relation indicates that the questionnaire is useful for comparison of groups with different exposures to organic solvents. There was low agreement between the number of symptoms on the questionnaire and the assessment of symptoms compatible with organic brain damage, as well as psychiatric, or early retirement diagnoses compatible with <b>chronic</b> <b>toxic</b> <b>encephalopathy.</b> The questionnaire does not seem useful for screening of patients with <b>chronic</b> <b>toxic</b> <b>encephalopathy</b> in groups without ongoing exposure to organic solvents...|$|E

Thirty two patients underwent computed brain tomography (CT), were retested psychometrically, {{and the results}} were compared with a group of age matched control subjects from the same socioeconomic level. The age of the patients was 33 - 69 (median 55) and they had been exposed to organic solvents for 7 - 50 years (median 26). The CT examinations were quantified by linear measurements on the films of the four largest sulci, the minimum width of the cella media and the third ventricle. Bifrontal horn, bicaudate, and third ventricle [...] Sylvian fissure distances were also measured; and measurements were adjusted for variation in skull diameter. No {{differences were found between the}} patients and controls. Most of the measures were correlated with age, to a somewhat higher degree in the patients. The patient-control differences did not increase with increasing age of the subjects. Psychometrically the patients performed worse than the controls despite adjustments for possible differences of intellectual level in the two groups. In the patients correlations were found between some of the CT measures and psychometric test performances suggesting slower psychomotor speed and attention difficulties among subjects with central and cortical brain substance reduction.

40|$|Aim: We {{investigated}} global DNA methylation {{alterations in}} lymphocytes of solvent workers and <b>chronic</b> <b>toxic</b> <b>encephalopathy</b> (CTE) patients and explored potential gene-environment interactions for GST.

Global DNA methylation was negatively associated with exposure. Furthermore, GSTP 1 genotypic polymorphism was found to be significantly associated (p = 0. 033) with global DNA hypomethylation, which indicates a potential role for gene-environment interaction in the etiology of solvent-induced neurobehavioral disorders.

50|$|In addition, chemicals, such as lead, {{that could}} {{instigate}} <b>toxic</b> <b>encephalopathy</b> are sometimes found in everyday {{products such as}} cleaning products, building materials, pesticides, air fresheners, and even perfumes. These harmful chemicals can be inhaled (in the case of air fresheners) or applied (in the case of perfumes).

40|$|Abstract: A 70 -year-old man {{developed}} a slowly progressive cerebellar syndrome {{after having been}} exposed to carbon disulfide (CS 2) in a viscose rayon plant for 27 years. Ataxia, dysmetria, dysarthria and adiadochokinesia appeared 7 years after retirement from work (at age 54), and were later accompanied by cognitive deterioration, dysmnesia, spatio-temporal disorientation, emotional lability, and paranoid-obsessive disturbances. Brain computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed advanced global cerebellar atrophy, {{and a picture of}} less severe cerebrocortical atrophy. The case illustrates the possibility of <b>chronic</b> <b>toxic</b> <b>encephalopathy</b> among patients with previous long-term exposure to CS 2. In such instances, cerebellar damage may develop as an exceptional, delayed manifestation of neurotoxicity: brain imaging techniques can significantly contribute to the diagnosis and follow-up, in addition to occupational anamnesis and neuropsychiatric evaluation. The patient presented also serves as a remainder that neurodegenerative disorders of apparently unknown origin sometimes derive from occupational toxic exposures suffered in the past. The clinical manifestations may appear several years after retirement from work, when the effects of toxic damage combine with age-related neuronal loss to overcome the brain functional reserve...|$|E
40|$|This article {{presents}} a schematic {{review of the}} clinical manifestations of occupational neurologic disorders in Korea and discusses the toxicologic implications of these conditions. Vascular encephalopathy, parkinsonism, <b>chronic</b> <b>toxic</b> <b>encephalopathy,</b> cerebellar dysfunction, peripheral neuropathy, and neurodegenerative diseases are common presentations of occupational neurotoxic syndromes in Korea.

Detailed neurologic examinations and categorization of the clinical manifestations of neurologic disorders will improve the clinical management of occupational neurologic diseases. Physicians {{must be aware of}} the typical signs and symptoms of possible exposure to neurotoxins, and they should also pay attention to less-typical, rather-vague symptoms and signs in workers because the toxicologic characteristics of occupational neurologic diseases in Korea have changed from typical patterns to less-typical or equivocal patterns. This shift is likely to be due to several years of lowdose exposure, perhaps combined with the effects of aging, and new types of possibly toxicant-related neurodegenerative diseases.

40|$|This article schematically {{reviews the}} {{clinical}} features, diagnostic approaches to, and toxicological implications of toxic encepha-lopathy. The review {{will focus on}} the most significant occupational causes of toxic encephalopathy. <b>Chronic</b> <b>toxic</b> <b>encephalopathy,</b> cerebellar syndrome, parkinsonism, and vascular encephalopathy are commonly encountered clinical syndromes of toxic en-cephalopathy. Few neurotoxins cause patients to present with pathognomonic neurological syndromes. The symptoms and signs of toxic encephalopathy may be mimicked by many psychiatric, metabolic, inflammatory, neoplastic, and degenerative diseases of the nervous system. Thus, the importance of good history-taking that considers exposure and a comprehensive neurological examination cannot be overemphasized in the diagnosis of toxic encephalopathy. Neuropsychological testing and neuroimaging typically play ancillary roles. The recognition of toxic encephalopathy is important because the correct diagnosis of occupational disease can prevent others (e. g., workers at the same worksite) from further harm by reducing their exposure to the toxin, and also often provides some indication of prognosis. Physicians must therefore be aware of the typical signs and symptoms of toxic encephalopathy, and close collaborations between neurologists and occupational physicians are needed to determine whether neurological disorders are related to occupational neurotoxin exposure.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this article was to provide a {{literature}} review of occupational neurological disorders and related research in Korea, focusing on chemical hazards. We reviewed occupational neurological disorders investigated by the Occupational Safety and Health Research Institute of Korean Occupational Safety and Health Agency between 1992 and 2009, categorizing them as neurological disorders of the central nervous system (CNS), of the peripheral nervous system (PNS) or as neurodegenerative disorders.
