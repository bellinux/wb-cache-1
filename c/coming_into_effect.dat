To evaluate the reform we introduce an estimator that, unlike the much used difference-in-difference approach, accounts {{for the fact that}} policy changes are typically phased in gradually rather than <b>coming</b> <b>into</b> full <b>effect</b> immediately.

40|$|Abstract: The generous Nordic {{model of}} welfare is {{commonly}} {{viewed as an}} exceptional success {{both in terms of}} equality and economic growth. However, it has recently become evident that subgroups of the population with weak labour market attachment and high welfare dependency, such as lone mothers, were vastly overrepresented among the poor. This motivated a workfare reform of the Norwegian welfare system for lone mothers; activity requirements were introduced, time limits imposed, and benefit levels raised. To evaluate the welfare reform we introduce an estimator that, unlike the much used difference-in-difference approach, accounts for the fact that policy changes are typically phased in gradually rather than <b>coming</b> <b>into</b> full <b>effect</b> at once. We find that the workfare reform did not only increase earnings and education as well as lower welfare caseloads and by this route ease the financial burden of the government, but also reduced poverty.

40|$|This study reviews {{development}} of the Russian roundwood exports to main importing countries in Northern Europe. In addition to unit prices and traded volumes, this study also shortly describes the significance of imported Russian roundwood with respect to national roundwood markets in importing countries. According to the trade flows, majority of the roundwood from Russia has been traded to Scandinavia and around the Baltic Sea region. Especially, Finland and Sweden {{have been the most}} important roundwood importers from Russia. Although some amounts of roundwood from Russia have also been traded to Central Europe, their role and importance with respect to local forest production and removals have been only marginal. Due to its geographic location and lower logistic costs, Finland has typically paid lower import prices for Russian roundwood than the other importers. If the customs tariffs programme for Russian roundwood exports is <b>coming</b> <b>into</b> full <b>effect</b> in 2011 or later, {{it is clear that the}} effects on the national roundwood markets and the production possibilities for the traditional Nordic exporters of forest products such as Finland and Sweden are large. The Baltic States and their sawnwood industry will face a lack of logs. Also, termination of roundwood exports from Russia is likely to cause crucial rechanges in roundwood flows around the Baltic Sea region...|$|R

It has been argued that while this strategy was extremely effective in advancing the safety, dignity and equality of Canadian homosexuals, its emphasis of sameness came at the expense of difference and may have undermined opportunities for more meaningful change.|$|E
