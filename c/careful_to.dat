5|$|The {{question}} of prohibition of alcohol {{was a major}} issue in South Carolina during Tillman's governorship. Tillman opposed banning alcohol, but was <b>careful</b> <b>to</b> speak well of temperance advocates, many of whom were women. The concern Tillman had with alcohol issues was that they divided the white community, leaving openings for black Republicans to exploit.|$|E

5|$|As he {{had done}} for other Adventures of Tintin which {{featured}} sea travel, Hergé was <b>careful</b> <b>to</b> obtain as much data about ships as possible {{in order to make}} his portrayals more realistic. The design of the Aurora was based on the RRS William Scoresby, while that of the Peary was most likely based upon another Antarctic ship, the RRS Discovery. The seaplane on which the expedition travels was based on the German Arado 196-A. Hergé nevertheless later criticised his own efforts in this area, saying that if Aurora had been a real ship, it would probably be unseaworthy.|$|E
5|$|Despite his fervour, Saglio's {{negotiations}} with the local people were unsuccessful. Niomoune and Carabane were the first two villages to attempt to apply this innovative approach, but both failed. The inhabitants were reluctant to participate, and the young inexperienced promoter had to abandon some of his ethnographic theories in favour of being <b>careful</b> <b>to</b> understand the daily realities of villages. The project was eventually abandoned, and the Catholic missions house was transformed by the nuns themselves into a modern, functional building. Despite the failure of Saglio's initiative in Carabane, agritourist camps were set up over the following decade in a dozen other nearby towns.|$|E
5|$|Harding {{wished to}} try again for {{elective}} office. Though a longtime admirer of Foraker (by then a U.S. senator), he had been <b>careful</b> <b>to</b> maintain {{good relations with the}} party faction led by the state's other U.S. senator, Mark Hanna, McKinley's political manager and chairman of the Republican National Committee (RNC). Both Foraker and Hanna supported Harding for state Senate in 1899; he gained the Republican nomination and was easily elected to a two-year term.|$|E

5|$|In 1861 Sophia Ripley died. George Ripley remarried, to Louisa Sclossberger, in 1865, {{and was a}} part of the Gilded Age New York {{literary}} {{scene for}} the remainder of his life. Because of his convivial nature, he was <b>careful</b> <b>to</b> avoid the city's rampant literary feuds at the time. He became a public figure with a national reputation and, known as an arbiter of taste, he helped establish the National Institute of Literature, Art, and Science in 1869. In his later years, he began suffering frequent illnesses, including a bout with influenza in 1875 which prevented him from traveling to Germany. He also suffered from gout and rheumatism.|$|E
5|$|In January 1985, Collins renewed her {{push for}} {{additional}} education funding and changes by appointing herself {{secretary of the}} state Education and Humanities Cabinet. Following the announcement, Collins and several key legislators {{held a series of}} meetings in every county, advocating for her proposed changes and seeking information about what types of changes the state's citizens desired. At the meetings, Collins was <b>careful</b> <b>to</b> separate the issues of her proposed education plan and potential tax increases. She believed that opposition to increased taxes had prevented her previous package from being enacted.|$|E
5|$|In {{reality the}} House of Hohenzollern, of which Albrecht was a member, the ruling {{family of the}} Margraviate of Brandenburg, had been {{actively}} expanding its territorial influence; for example already in the 16th century in Farther Pomerania and Silesia. Motivated by a current political expediency, Sigismund Augustus in 1563 allowed the Brandenburg elector branch of the Hohenzollerns, excluded under the 1525 agreement, to inherit the Prussian fief rule. The decision, confirmed by the 1569 sejm, made the future union of Prussia with Brandenburg possible. Sigismind II, unlike his successors, was however <b>careful</b> <b>to</b> assert his supremacy. The Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, ruled after 1572 by elective kings, was even less able to counteract the growing importance of the dynastically active Hohenzollerns.|$|E

5|$|In the Senate, Nixon took a {{prominent}} position in opposing global communism, traveling frequently and {{speaking out against}} it. He maintained friendly relations with his fellow anti-communist, the controversial Wisconsin senator, Joseph McCarthy, but was <b>careful</b> <b>to</b> keep some distance between himself and McCarthy's allegations. Nixon also criticized President Harry S. Truman's handling of the Korean War. He supported statehood for Alaska and Hawaii, {{voted in favor of}} civil rights for minorities, and supported federal disaster relief for India and Yugoslavia. He voted against price controls and other monetary restrictions, benefits for illegal immigrants, and public power.|$|E
5|$|Justice Anthony Kennedy wrote a {{concurrence}} which {{stated that}} Congress was very <b>careful</b> <b>to</b> base {{the changes to}} the statute on inherent tribal powers and not on a delegation of authority. Kennedy states that {{is all that is}} needed to decide the case, but that the Court went further than was necessary when it decided that Congress had the power under the constitution to authorize tribes to prosecute non-member Indians. Finally, Kennedy was concerned that the court did not address the question of the Equal Protection Clause. He would have reversed the Eighth Circuit without going into the additional detail.|$|E
5|$|Russell is <b>careful</b> <b>to</b> {{indicate}} that {{his support for}} nationalisation rests {{on the assumption that}} it can be accomplished under the auspices of a robust democracy, and that it may be safeguarded against statist tyranny. If either condition fail, then nationalisation is undesirable. In delivering this warning, Russell emphasises the distinction between ownership and control. He points out that nationalisation – which would allow the citizens to collectively own an industry – would not guarantee any of them control over the industry. In the same way, shareholders own parts of companies, but the control of the company ultimately rests with the CEO (Russell 1938:235).|$|E

5|$|The ancient {{historian}} Tacitus describes Domitian's first {{speech in}} the Senate as brief and measured, {{at the same time}} noting his ability to elude awkward questions. Domitian's authority was merely , however, foreshadowing what was to be his role for at least ten more years. By all accounts, Mucianus held the real power in Vespasian's absence and he was <b>careful</b> <b>to</b> ensure that Domitian, still only eighteen years old, did not overstep the boundaries of his function. Strict control was also maintained over the young Caesar's , promoting away Flavian generals such as Arrius Varus and Antonius Primus and replacing them by more reliable men such as Arrecinus Clemens.|$|E
5|$|Voorhis was a {{conscientious}} congressman towards his constituents, <b>careful</b> <b>to</b> remember births, anniversaries, and in-district events.

On April 1, 1946, Richard Nixon sent Voorhis a thank you letter for the pamphlet.|$|E
5|$|While the {{superstructure}} {{and two of}} {{the four}} main gun turrets were removed, the barbette of one of the turrets remains visible above the water. Since her sinking, oil still leaks from the hull, with more than 2.3 quarts (2.18l) escaping into the harbor per day. The Navy, in conjunction with the National Park Service, has recently overseen a comprehensive computerized mapping of the hull, being <b>careful</b> <b>to</b> honor its role as a war grave. The Navy is considering non-intrusive means of abating the continued leakage of oil to avoid the further environmental degradation of the harbor.|$|E

5|$|While {{there were}} many {{violations}} of the ceasefire, the incidents were relatively minor.

The latter course was promoted by France and most African states, while the Reagan Administration saw a resumption of the conflict as the best chance to unseat Gaddafi.|$|E
5|$|With legal appeals, {{petitions}} from {{subjects and}} judicial queries of magistrates and governors, the emperors were <b>careful</b> <b>to</b> {{consult with the}} jurists (iuris consulti), who were usually secretaries drafted from the equestrian order. From the reign of Augustus (27BC–AD14), jurists began compiling organized repositories of imperial edicts (constitutiones), and juristic scholarship became an imperially sponsored function of administration. Every new judicial decision was founded on archived legal precedents and earlier deliberations. The edict repositories and the imperially sponsored juristic scholarship {{gave rise to the}} earliest law school system of the Western world, aimed specifically at training professional jurists.|$|E
5|$|With no {{permanent}} plans for conquest, the Assyrians left control of Egypt {{to a series}} of vassals who became known as the Saite kings of the Twenty-sixth Dynasty. By 653BC, the Saite king Psamtik I (taking advantage of the fact that Assyria was involved in a fierce war conquering Elam and that few Assyrian troops were stationed in Egypt) was able to free Egypt relatively peacefully from Assyrian vassalage with the help of Lydian and Greek mercenaries, the latter of whom were recruited to form Egypt's first navy. Psamtik and his successors however were <b>careful</b> <b>to</b> maintain peaceful relations with Assyria. Greek influence expanded greatly as the city of Naukratis became the home of Greeks in the delta.|$|E
