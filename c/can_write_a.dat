5|$|Bell {{explained}} that he, Jed Whedon, and Tancharoen supervise {{all of the}} series' creative decisions, often consulting with Loeb. When the showrunners are writing the series, one person <b>can</b> <b>write</b> <b>a</b> script while the other two break stories, so that a story can be broken every few weeks. If the executive producers sign off on a story, {{a member of the}} series' writers room then produces an outline, gets notes on it from the showrunners, writes a full script, gets notes on it from ABC and the production crew, and then goes to set to produce the episode.|$|E

Inspired {{by the sight of}} Homer accidentally slicing Marge's hair off with hedge shears, they write a script titled [...] "Little Barbershop of Horrors", but their episode is rejected by Roger Meyers Jr., head of Itchy & Scratchy International. Correctly guessing that Meyers did not take them seriously because they were children, they resubmit the manuscript under Grampa's name, leading Meyers to hire Grampa as a staff writer. Bart and Lisa inform Grampa about what they did and the three of them conspire to continue passing off Bart and Lisa's scripts as Grampa's own, splitting the money three ways.|$|E

The film ran along with Once Upon a Honeymoon (1956), a short film about a married couple forced to postpone their honeymoon even further so that the husband <b>can</b> <b>write</b> <b>a</b> song for a telephone company and an angel who helps them out. Night of the Blood Beast {{was one of several}} Roger Corman-produced or -directed films that were featured on the show, along with It Conquered the World (1956), The Viking Women and the Sea Serpent (1957), Teenage Caveman (1958), and Attack of the Giant Leeches (1959).

[...] With this encouragement, Ice Cube wrote the screenplay for what became the 1995 comedy Friday, in which he also starred, alongside then up-and-coming comedian Chris Tucker. Friday earned $28million worldwide on a $3.5million budget, and spawned two sequels, Next Friday and Friday After Next. In 1995, he also starred in his second collaboration with John Singleton, Higher Learning, as university student Fudge.|$|E

Jim later introduces Blair to Simon Banks, the chief of Major Crimes, and gets Blair a ninety-day observer's pass so that Blair can help with his senses. The excuse they give is that Blair is Jim's kid cousin, whom he is helping get his doctorate by allowing him to study the police force so he <b>can</b> <b>write</b> <b>a</b> dissertation on the [...] "thin blue line" [...] and the closed society of the police force.|$|E
2500|$|Being very {{detached}} from the Hollywood scene, Murray {{does not have an}} agent or manager and reportedly only fields offers for scripts and roles using a personal telephone number with a voice mailbox that he checks infrequently. This practice has the downside of sometimes preventing him from taking parts in films such as Who Framed Roger Rabbit, Monsters, Inc., The Squid and the Whale, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, and Little Miss Sunshine. [...] When asked about this practice, however, Murray seemed content with his inaccessibility, stating, [...] "It's not that hard. If you have a good script that's what gets you involved.

2500|$|The long poem genre {{has several}} {{advantages}} over prose and strictly lyric poetry. [...] The most obvious {{difference between the}} long poem and other literary genres is the sheer difficulty of composing a long work entirely in verse. [...] Poets who undertake the long poem face the serious problem of creating a work that is consistently poetic, sometimes taking strict forms and carrying them through the whole poem. [...] However, the poets who do choose the long poem turn this liability into an advantage—if a poet <b>can</b> <b>write</b> <b>a</b> long poem, they prove themselves to be worthy. [...] The very difficulty gives the genre an implicit prestige. [...] Long poems {{have been among the}} most influential texts in the world since Homer. [...] By writing a long poem, a poet participates in this tradition and must prove their virtuosity by living up to the tradition. As discussed below, the traditionally difficult long poem's prestige can be revised to serve radical purposes.|$|E
