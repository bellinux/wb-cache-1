The ability to breathe and readjust to volume fluctuations of the foot has made leather a unique material of choice in footwear industry. The environmental pollution problems pressures on chromium and forced the leather industry to find the possible alternatives. In the present study, a <b>combination</b> <b>tanning</b> system based on a garad –aluminum tannage {{for the production of}} hair on upper leathers as a cleaner alternative is presented. Acacia nilotica spp nilotica pods (garad) from Sudan have been evaluated for its tanning characteristics in a <b>combination</b> <b>tanning</b> system based on garad and aluminum sulfate. Aluminum-garad (Al-garad) leathers tanned using 2 % Al 2 O 3; followed by 20 % garad resulted in shrinkage temperature above 96 °C.

40|$|Ecological {{pressures}} on chromium have now forced the leather industry {{to look for}} possible alternatives. A vegetable- aluminum combination tannage has been studied, with special attention being given to intended final product. Aluminum is mineral tanning agents that are widely used to stabilize collagens in the leather industry. In this study, the crosslinking of vegetable and aluminum, with collagens, have been explored. This kind of chrome free tannage give us leathers with shrinkage temperature around 125 oC, elongation at break 65. 6 %, tensile strength 38 N/mm 2, and tear strength 98 N/mm. The chemical properties of the <b>combination</b> <b>tanned</b> leathers {{are found to be}} quite normal. Among the combination system evaluated, a vegetable pretannage followed by retannage with basic aluminum sulphate was found to produce stronger leather with the durable characteristics. In contrast, pre-tanning with aluminum possibly tightens the collagen fiber network, preventing high molecular weight vegetable tannins from interacting with collagen fibres. Optimal results were obtained when 10 % (w/w) vegetable tannins (garad) and 2 % Aluminum sulphate was used...|$|R
40|$|Various oxygen- and nitrogen-donor ligands were {{investigated}} as potential zirconium masking agents in zirconium tanning. α-Hydroxycarboxylic acid ligands {{were identified as}} effective zirconium(IV) chelators in acidic aqueous solution. Glycolic acid, lactic acid, mandelic acid, 4 -hydroxymandelic acid, 4 -chloromandelic acid and 4 -bromomandelic acid complexes were synthesised, isolated and characterised using a range of analytical techniques. Linear Free Energy Relationships were examined to optimise {{the stability of the}} zirconium complexes. Hammett [sigma] plots and Yukawa-Tsuno modified σ plots of the mandelate ligand and zirconium complex series indicated that inductive effects dominate within the benzene ring, however, mesomeric effects are significant outside the ring. Zirconium 4 -hydroxymandelate complex solutions were identified as the most effective tanning agents and achieved shrinkage temperatures of 80 and 97 ºC for hide powder and goatskin, respectively. The zirconium and 4 -hydroxymandelic acid interact synergistically to yield leather equivalent to <b>combination</b> <b>tanned</b> leather in one step.

40|$|Chromium tannage is {{the most}} used {{technology}} in processing of garment leathers. Due to environmental requirements and demands on natural products there is an increasing interest on alternatives to chromium tannage especially on vegetable tanned leathers. Leather properties vary in a very wide range depending on the animal type it is obtained from and the process type and chemicals used in the manufacturing. In this study, the effect of various tanning materials to the sewability of garment leathers was investigated. For this purpose, vegetable, chromium and chromium-vegetable <b>combination</b> <b>tanned</b> garment leathers from the same animal origin were supplied from a garment leather manufacturing factory. Needle penetration force and the sewability values of these leathers were determined by using L&M Sewability Tester.

40|$|To {{elucidate}} the reaction between collagen, condensed tannins and oxazolidine, two prodeiphinidin tannins have been studied: extracts from pecan nutshell pith and myrica esculenta bark. The tannin chemistry study showed pecan tannins are copolymers of catechin and gallocatechin with a ratio 1 : 6 and myrica tannins are prodeiphinidins with 40 % {{of the structural}} units gallated. The average molecular weight was measured by GPC and the {{number average molecular weight}} of tannins was found to be 25 00 - 3000. The molecular structure of oxazolidine, 1 -aza- 5 -ethyl- 1, 3 -dioxacyc 1 o[3. 3. 0] octane, was confirmed by IR, GC-MS and ‘H-NMR spectra. From NMR, the ratio between cis and trans conformations is nearly 1 : 1. Complete hydrolysis of oxazolidine is slow under weakly acidic or neutral conditions. The reaction of polyphenols with oxazolidine was modelled using simple phenols phioroglucinol, pyrogallol and resorcinol; the process was followed by chromatographic and NMR methods. The results show the reaction is second order: phloroglucinol has the highest reactivity. By using catechin and gallocatechin, it was shown that the cross-linking reaction of gallocatechins can happen between an A- ring and a B-ring, while for catechin, the reaction is only at the A-ring. Polyphenol polymer studies also support this result; more oxazolidine can be reacted with prodeiphinidins. The reaction of collagen with oxazolidine was studied; the reaction sites were determined using modified collagen. Few cross-linking reactions were found, which is supported by hydrothermal isometric tension (HIT) results. The reaction between polyphenol, collagen and oxazolidine was studied by HIT and {{it was found that the}} cross-linking is between collagen and tannins, which is responsible for the high stability of treated collagen. Based on this, organic <b>combination</b> <b>tanning</b> can be explained as an effect of covalent bonding, hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic bonding together, but the high shrinkage temperature is mainly due to the covalent bonding forming a complex matrix structure around the collagen fibresEThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E

40|$|Degradation of Kraft lignin {{by using}} hemin and {{hydrogen}} peroxide was investigated to produce phenolic compounds. The degradation products were identified using spectroscopic methods and gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS). 2 -Methoxyphenol, 4 -hydroxybenzaldehyde, vanillin, and vanillic acid were produced. Their polymerisation products {{were used as}} synthetic tanning agents for tanning collagen. Polymerised 2 -methoxyphenol can increase the hydrothermal stability of collagen, like a conventional syntan, through hydrogen bonding interactions between the polymers and the protein. These products have potential {{to be used as}} raw materials for tanning of animal skins and other industries, such as chemical, pharmaceutical, food, and perfumery industries. Therefore, this can add value to the industrial byproduct (Kraft lignin), often considered a waste, and reduce its environmental impact. Leather tanning reactions between collagen and dihydroxynaphthalenes (DHNs) and oxazolidine have also been investigated, using hide powder and sheepskin pickled pelt. This investigation showed that some DHNs have a tanning effect on collagen. The measurement of combined and cross-linked DHNs on collagen showed that 30 – 40 % of 1, 6 - and 2, 6 -DHNs were fixed through covalent bonding. Shrinkage temperature of the leather changed little after the non combined DHNs had been removed from the leather, indicating that the high stability of the <b>combination</b> <b>tanned</b> leather comes from the covalent bonding formed between DHNs and collagen through oxazolidine.

40|$|Kraft lignin {{degradation}} by a biomimetic {{system was}} investigated, using haemin and hydrogen peroxide, which mimics the catalytic mechanism of lignin peroxidase to produce phenolic compounds. The degradation products were identified using spectroscopic methods and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. 2 -methoxyphenol, 4 -hydroxybenzaldehyde, vanillin and vanillic acid were produced and their formaldehyde polymerisation products {{were used for}} tanning collagen. The denaturation (shrinkage) temperature of collagen was raised to 80 °C through hydrogen bonding interactions between the polymers and the protein. For dyeing of hide powder, the lignin degradation products were reacted with laccase (a polyphenol oxidase); 2 -methoxyphenol gave the darkest colour. These products have potential {{to be used as}} raw materials for tanning and dyeing of animal skins. Therefore, this can add value to the industrial byproduct (Kraft lignin) and reduce its environmental impact. Polyphenols are the basic building blocks of natural skin and hair pigments: they can be polymerised to create versions of natural black, brown and orange melanins. These reactions can be catalysed by laccase; not only do they create colour, but also if they are conducted in the presence of collagen, the resulting pigment is bound to the leather in a covalent tanning manner. Therefore, the leather becomes coloured by a lightfast pigment, which is firmly fixed. It appears to be a feature of this type of stabilising mechanism for collagen, the creation of a polyphenol matrix around the triple helix, that it has the added benefit of actually strengthening the leather. Since every traditional process step effectively weakens collagen, especially tanning, this is the first chemical reaction that has been shown to reverse that effect. Leather tanning reactions between collagen and dihydroxynaphthalenes (DHNs) and oxazolidine have been investigated, using hide powder and sheepskin pickled pelt. This investigation showed that some DHNs have a tanning effect on collagen.

40|$|Studies {{have been}} made of the {{reactions}} which take place when zirconium compounds and vegetable tannins react with chromium tanned leather, in order to elucidate the mechanisms of the reactions which occur on retannage. Statistical procedures have been used in all investigations because of the variable nature of the substrate, and computer techniques have been applied to the repetitive statistical computations. Although chromium and vegetable tannages are well understood, further information on the reaction of zirconium with collagen was necessary before attempting to interpret the results of the studies of combination tannages with chromium, and this has been obtained by a comparative study of the reactions of chromium and zirconium with modified collagen. It is concluded that the mechanism of the reaction of basic zirconium sulphate with collagen is multipoint attachment of the tanning material by residual valency forces, although charge effects with basic groups may be supplementary. Zirconyl chloride reacts with carboxyl groups but does not form satisfactory, stable cross-links with collagen. Further evidence for this theory was obtained from the investigation of the reaction of zirconium compounds with chromium tanned collagen. Zirconyl sulphate does not interfere with effective chromium tannage and therefore can have little affinity for the carboxyl groups on the protein, but it displaces chromium complexes loosely held by auxiliary valencies without reducing the shrinkage temperature of the chromium leather Zirconyl chloride, although only fixed to a limited extent, apparently forms co-ordination compounds with the carboxyl groups, disrupting the chromium tannage because there is an over-all loss of hydrothermal stability. There is no evidence that zirconium co-ordinates with, or releases acid from chromium-collagen complexes, since <b>combination</b> chromium/zirconium <b>tanned</b> leathers are stable on storage. Retannage of chromium tanned leather with vegetable tanning materials generally results in loss of strength and a product which tends to deteriorate on ageing. Lower initial strength is probably due to the increased avidity of chromium tanned pelt for vegetable tannins, resulting from the liberation of internally neutralised reactive sites which are not normally available in vegetable tannage, and from the co- ordination of vegetable tannins and non-tannins to the chromium complex with the displacement of sulphate radicals. From a study of the retannage of chromium tanned modified collagen, it appears that basic groups probably play an important part in the rapid absorption of vegetable tannin. These reactions result in overloading of the fibre and an increased number of cross-links, both of which tend to produce weak leather. Deterioration with age is primarily a hydrolytic degradation of the protein which is catalysed by acid liberated from the chromium complexes by the entry of vegetable tannins, those factors which favour the formation of acid causing greater and more rapid deterioration...|$|R
