40|$|<b>Cetamolol</b> {{is a new}} beta-adrenoceptor {{blocking}} agent {{shown in}} animals to have moderate beta 1 -adrenoceptor selectivity and partial agonist activity. In healthy normal volunteers, beta 1 -adrenoceptor blockade was measured as the reduction of exercise-induced tachycardia, systolic blood pressure, and double product at 2, 8, and 24 h after a single oral dose of 10, 25, and 50 mg <b>cetamolol.</b> beta 1 -adrenoceptor blockade was significantly linearly related to log serum <b>cetamolol</b> level, was maximal at 2 h, and was still clinically significant at 24 h. A crossover study of single 0, 10, and 25 mg doses confirmed these findings...|$|E
