40|$|OBJECTIVE: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the effect of various degrees of implant displacement on the tissue differentiation around immediately loaded <b>cylindrical</b> <b>turned</b> titanium implants. DESIGN: The experiments were conducted in repeated sampling bone chambers placed in the tibia of 10 rabbits. Tissues could grow into the bone chambers via perforations. Due to its double structure, tissues inside the chamber could be harvested leaving the chamber intact. This allowed several experiments within the same animal. The chambers contained a <b>cylindrical</b> <b>turned</b> titanium implant that was loaded in a well-controlled manner. In each of the 10 chambers, four experiments were conducted with the following test conditions: immediate implant loading by inducing 0 (control), 30, 60 and 90 microm implant displacement, 800 cycles per day at a frequency of 1 Hz, twice a week during a period of 6 weeks. Histological and histomorphometrical analyses were performed on methylmethacrylate histological sections. An ANOVA was conducted on the dataset. RESULTS: The total tissue volume was significantly lowest in the unloaded control condition. The bone volume fraction on the other hand, was significantly larger in the unloaded and 90 microm implant displacement, compared to the 30 microm implant displacement. Bone density increased with increasing micro-motion with significantly higher values for the 60 microm- and 90 microm-test conditions compared to the unloaded situation. The chance to have bone-to-implant contact decreased in case of micro-motion at the tissues-implant interface. CONCLUSION: The magnitude of implant displacement had a statistically significant effect on the tissue differentiation around immediately loaded <b>cylindrical</b> <b>turned</b> titanium implants.

It {{is still unclear}} whether immediate loading limits or promotes peri-implant osteogenesis and which mechanical parameters are important herein. The present study evaluated the influence of well-controlled mechanical stimuli on the tissue response around immediately loaded <b>cylindrical</b> <b>turned</b> titanium implants at two different observation periods. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A repeated sampling bone chamber, consisting of dual-structure perforated hollow cylinders with a cylindrical implant, was installed in the tibia of 14 rabbits and used to conduct three displacement-controlled immediate loading experiments: (i) 30 microm - 400 cycles/day - 1 Hz frequency - 2 x/week - 6 weeks; (ii) 30 microm - 400 cycles/day - 1 Hz - 2 x/week - 6 weeks, followed by another 6 weeks with a 50 microm - 800 cycles/day - 1 Hz - 2 x/week loading protocol; and (iii) 0 microm implant displacement for 12 weeks. A linear mixed model and logistic mixed model with alpha= 5 % were conducted on the data set. RESULTS: The tissue area fraction was significantly the highest after 12 weeks of loading. The bone area fraction was significantly different between all three loading conditions, with the highest values for the 12 -week loading experiment. Twelve-week stimulation resulted in a significantly higher mineralized bone fraction than 6 weeks. Loading did have a significantly {{positive effect on the}} mineralized bone fraction. The incidence of osteoid-to-implant and bone-to-implant contact increased significantly when loading the implant for 12 weeks. CONCLUSION: Immediate loading had a positive effect on the tissue differentiation and bone formation around <b>cylindrical</b> <b>turned</b> titanium implants. Controlled implant micro-motion up to 50 microm had a positive effect on the bone formation at its interface. Peer reviewe...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} an algorithm to extract machinable volumes {{that need to}} be removed from a stock, given a boundary model of the part. Machinable implies that these volumes are extracted and arranged in a hierarchy such that each volume in the list is accessible for machining after its preceding volume has been machined. These volumes can be used to automate process planning and NC tool path generation. The algorithm identifies the cavity volumes in the part with respect to outermost faces in the part and fills them with the appropriate primitive volume to obtain the stock from which the part can be realized. Unlike the decomposition-based approaches reported, this algorithm directly identifies primitive volumes that when combined form the cavity volumes corresponding to the machining features. Primitive volumes enable handling parts with interacting features and renders redundant the additional processing of machining features required to generate a NC tool path. The primitive machinable volumes are cuboids, wedges and collars. The algorithm handles both prismatic and <b>cylindrical</b> (<b>turned)</b> components. Results of implementation for prismatic and turned components are provided and the extension of the algorithm to handle preformed stock is discussed...|$|R
