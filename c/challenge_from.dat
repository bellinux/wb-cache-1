The Montreals eventually won the game, 5–1, and their crosstown rivals were awarded the Cup.|$|E

5|$|In the Belmont, Paynter led {{for most}} of the race until the final furlong when Smith came off the rail, {{allowing}} winner Union Rags to slip through and win by a neck. Paynter had already fended off two challengers during the race, and Smith had switched his whip from his right hand to his left in an attempt to fend off a late <b>challenge</b> <b>from</b> Atigun; Smith considered his decision to be an error that cost him the race.|$|E
5|$|In the primary, Tydings faced {{a strong}} <b>challenge</b> <b>from</b> Congressman Paul Sarbanes, who {{had entered the}} race several months earlier. This head start gave Sarbanes a {{considerable}} organizational and monetary advantage, and he had already secured influential endorsements. To fend off Sarbanes, Tydings hoped his name recognition and charisma on television would compensate for Sarbanes' other advantages. He also worked to relabel himself as more fiscally conservative than Sarbanes, since both candidates were seen as liberal.|$|E

5|$|After leaving Eton, {{he went to}} Magdalene College, Cambridge, on a music scholarship, and was {{expected}} to make music his career. A highlight of his undergraduate musical career was playing a two piano arrangement of Chabrier's España with Boris Ord, then organist of King's College, Cambridge. However, Chadwick chose to further his interest in Evangelical Christianity, which had existed from his school days. He graduated in 1941 and began his theological training in 1942, at Ridley Hall, Cambridge, being ordained deacon by the Archbishop of Canterbury, in Canterbury Cathedral, in 1943 and priest by the Bishop of Dover in 1944. He served a curacy at the Evangelical parish of Emmanuel, Croydon, arriving {{towards the end of}} the Second World War, as Croydon was attacked by German V-weapons, which provided a difficult pastoral <b>challenge.</b> <b>From</b> there, he became an assistant master at Wellington College. He married Peggy Browning in 1945, and they had three daughters.|$|E
5|$|As a Republican {{representing}} heavily-Democratic Maryland, Mathias faced {{a potentially}} difficult re-election {{bid for the}} 1974 election. State Democrats nominated Barbara Mikulski, then a Baltimore City Councilwoman who was well-known to residents in her city as a social activist, but with limited name recognition {{in the rest of}} the state. Mathias was renominated by Republicans, fending off a primary election <b>challenge</b> <b>from</b> conservative doctor Ross Pierpont. Pierpont was never a substantial threat to Mathias, whose lack of competition was due in part to fallout from the Watergate scandal.|$|E
