25|$|To {{obtain a}} Professional certificate, the {{applicant}} must have completed a NYS-approved {{teacher education program}} at a college/university and hold a master's degree or above. Each state has different requirements to become a permanently certified teacher, and the requirements keep increasing. For example, professional certification in NYS requires three years of <b>classroom</b> <b>teaching</b> experience. It also requires being mentored by a certified teacher within the first year teaching. However NYS no longer offers permanent certification to those who haven't already been certified by February 2004.The Professional certificate replaces it. To maintain a professional certificate, a teacher must complete 100 hours of professional development every five years. These professional development hours are decreased by a few percentages for every year teaching in a non-public school. One {{does not have to}} teach in New York State to maintain their certificate as many New York teachers teach in Connecticut and New Jersey.|$|E

2500|$|As Dewey notes, other {{professional}} fields, such as law and medicine cultivate a professional spirit {{in their fields}} to constantly study their work, their methods of their work, and a perpetual need for intellectual growth and concern for issues related to their profession. [...] Teacher education, as a profession, has these same obligations (Dewey, 1904; Dewey, PST, 2010). [...] As Dewey notes, [...] "An intellectual responsibility {{has got to be}} distributed to every human being who is concerned in carrying out the work in question, and to attempt to concentrate intellectual responsibility for a work that has to be done, with their brains and their hearts, by hundreds or thousands of people in a dozen or so at the top, no matter how wise and skillful they are, is not to concentrate responsibility—it is to diffuse irresponsibility" [...] (Dewey, PST, 2010, p.39). [...] For Dewey, the professional spirit of teacher education requires of its students a constant study of school room work, constant study of children, of methods, of subject matter in its various adaptations to pupils. [...] Such study will lead to professional enlightenment with regard to the daily operations of <b>classroom</b> <b>teaching.</b>|$|E
