40|$|Background The {{prognostic}} {{value of}} <b>circulating</b> <b>tumor</b> <b>cells</b> {{in patients with}} metastatic breast cancer has been widely established. This study examines the prognostic value of <b>circulating</b> <b>tumor</b> <b>cells</b> in pre operative blood samples from patients with non metastatic breast cancer. Methods Between september 2003 and januari 2009, 404 patients with non metastatic breast cancer were included. Pre-operative blood samples were analyzed {{for the presence of}} CTC’s with the Cellsearch system. Patiënts were monitered in follow-up for recurence and overal survival. 91 patients with benign histological results after surgery and with no history of malignancy from 5 years before inclusion were included in a control group. All statistal analysis were performed with SPSS 15. 0. Results There were 74 (18, 3 %) patients with <b>circulating</b> <b>tumor</b> <b>cells</b> en 41 (10, 1 %) patients developed recurrence. There was a significant difference between people with and without CTC’s for developing recurrence (p= 0, 019). After multivariate logistic regresion the presence of CTC’s was found to be an independent prognostic value for disease recurrence (p= 0, 048) together with estrogenreceptorstatus and Her 2 /neu-receptorstatus. The five year overal survival of patients with <b>circulating</b> <b>tumor</b> <b>cells</b> is significantly shorter then the survival of patients without <b>circulating</b> <b>tumor</b> <b>cells.</b> Only half the patiënts with recurrence and <b>circulating</b> <b>tumor</b> <b>cells</b> was treated with adjuvant systemic therapy. Conclusion Patients with non metastatic breast cancer and pre-operative <b>circulating</b> <b>tumor</b> <b>cells</b> have a greater chance on disease recurrence then patients without <b>circulating</b> <b>tumor</b> <b>cells.</b> The overal survival rate after 5 years is significantly less in patients with CTC’s compared to those without CTC’s. A prospective study should be performed to see if patiënts who according to current guidelines do not receive systemic adjuvant therapy but do have <b>circulating</b> <b>tumor</b> <b>cells</b> shouldn’t receive systemic adjuvant therapy after all. ...|$|R

50|$|Using a novel {{high-throughput}} screening assay, Mawji et al. showed that anisomycin can sensitize metastatic epithelial cells to anoikis and reduce <b>circulating</b> <b>tumor</b> <b>cell</b> implantation in vivo. Anisomycin achieved this anti-metastatic activity {{in part by}} decreasing the abundance of the death receptor inhibiting protein FLIP. In related work, Schimmer's team showed that FLIP levels are higher in metastatic cells than non-metastatic cells, and that reducing FLIP levels using RNAi (RNA Interference) or other small molecule inhibitors of FLIP can sensitize metastatic cells to anoikis. Given that FLIP is an inhibitor of anoikis, and that reducing FLIP can sensitize metastatic cells to anoikis, Mawji et al. hypothesize that FLIP reduction may be a viable therapeutic strategy against cancer metastasis.|$|E
40|$|International audienceBACKGROUND:Despite {{aggressive}} regimens, {{the clinical}} outcome of {{head and neck}} squamous cell carcinoma remains poor. The detection of <b>circulating</b> <b>tumor</b> <b>cells</b> could potentially improve the management of patients with disseminated cancer, including diagnosis, treatment strategies, and surveillance. Currently, CellSearch(®) is {{the most widely used}} and the only Food and Drug Administration-cleared system for <b>circulating</b> <b>tumor</b> <b>cells</b> detection in patients with metastatic breast, colorectal, or prostate cancer. In most cases of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, only low counts of <b>circulating</b> <b>tumor</b> <b>cells</b> have been reported. CASE PRESENTATION:A 56 -year-old white male with no particular medical history, was diagnosed with a squamous cell carcinoma of oral cavity. According to the imaging results (computed tomography and (18) F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography / computed tomography) and panendoscopy, the TNM staging was classified as T 4 N 2 M 0. A non-interruptive pelvimandibulectomy was conducted according to the multidisciplinary meeting advices and the postoperative observations were normal. The patient complained of a painful cervical edema and a trismus 6 weeks after the surgery. A relapse was found by computed tomography and the patient died two weeks later. The search for <b>circulating</b> <b>tumor</b> <b>cells</b> in peripheral venous blood by using the CellSearch(®) system revealed a very high count compared with published reports at three time points (pre-operative: 400; intra-operative: 150 and post-operative day 7 : 1400 <b>circulating</b> <b>tumor</b> <b>cells).</b> Of note, all detected <b>circulating</b> <b>tumor</b> <b>cells</b> were epidermal growth factor receptor negative. CONCLUSION:We report {{here for the first time}} a rare case of oral squamous cell carcinoma with extremely high <b>circulating</b> <b>tumor</b> <b>cells</b> counts using the CellSearch(®) system. The absolute number of <b>circulating</b> <b>tumor</b> <b>cells</b> might predict a particular phase of cancer development as well as a poor survival, potentially contributing to a personalized healthcare...|$|R

50|$|An {{epithelial}} to mesenchymal transition was mimicked in metastatic cells by adapting PC-3 {{prostate cancer}} cells from adherent to suspension culture and then examined to investigate changes in gene expression concurrent with this adaption to suspension. It {{was found that}} the asparagine synthetase expression was sixfold greater in the suspension cells than in the adherent cells. In xenografts from a human breast cancer cell line in an established metastatic mouse model, asparagine synthetase was elevated in circulating tumor cells isolated from the mouse blood compared with the parental cell line. When these circulating tumor cells were returned to an in vitro culture and exposed to hypoxia, they showed higher basal expression and greater induction of asparagine synthetase than their parental cell line. These circulating tumor cells were also found to have an increased capacity for colony formation in soft agar assays under hypoxic conditions and grew faster when reimplanted as xenografts. The increased prevalence of asparaginase synthetase in the metastatic cells suggests that its activity may be beneficial for <b>circulating</b> <b>tumor</b> <b>cell</b> survival.|$|E
50|$|There are {{two types}} of liquid biopsy (which is not really a biopsy as they are blood tests that do not require a biopsy of tissue): <b>circulating</b> <b>tumor</b> <b>cell</b> assays or {{cell-free}} circulating tumor DNA tests. These methods provide a non-invasive alternative to repeat invasive biopsies to evaluate the mutations in cancer and plan individualized treatments. In addition, because cancer is a heterogeneous genetic disease, and excisional biopsies provide only a snapshot in time of some of the rapid, dynamic genetic changes occurring in tumors, liquid biopsies provide some advantages over tissue biopsy-based genomic testing. In addition, excisional biopsies are invasive, can’t be used repeatedly, and are ineffective in understanding the dynamics of tumor progression and metastasis. By detecting and quantifying genomic alterations in CTCs and cell-free DNA in blood, liquid biopsy can provide real-time information on the stage of tumor progression, treatment effectiveness, and cancer metastasis risk. This technological development could make it possible to diagnose and manage cancer from repeated blood tests rather than from a traditional biopsy.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: Circulating {{tumor cells}} are {{malignant}} cells in peripheral blood that originate from primary tumors or metastatic sites. The heterogeneous {{natural history and}} propensity for recurrence in prostate, bladder and kidney cancers are well suited for improved individualization of care using circulating tumor cells. The potential clinical applications of circulating tumor cells include early diagnosis, disease prediction and prognosis, and selection of appropriate therapies. Materials and Methods: The PubMed (R) and Web of Science (R) databases were searched using the key words circulating tumor cells, CTC, prostate, kidney, bladder, renal cell carcinoma and transitional cell carcinoma. Relevant articles and references from 1994 to 2011 were reviewed for data on the detection and significance of circulating tumor cells in genitourinary cancer. Results: Technical challenges have previously limited the widespread introduction of <b>circulating</b> <b>tumor</b> <b>cell</b> detection in routine clinical care. Recently novel platforms were introduced to detect these cells that offer the promise of overcoming these limitations. We reviewed {{the current state of}} <b>circulating</b> <b>tumor</b> <b>cell</b> capture technologies and their clinical applications for genitourinary cancers. Conclusions: In genitourinary cancer <b>circulating</b> <b>tumor</b> <b>cell</b> enumeration has been useful for prognosis in patients with castration resistant prostate cancer. Soon characterizing individual circulating tumor cells in blood will serve as a noninvasive real-time liquid biopsy to monitor molecular changes in cancer, allowing clinicians to custom tailor treatment strategies. Circulating tumor cells will serve as a treatment response biomarker.

40|$|Abstract] Background: Detection of {{tumor cells}} in the blood, or minimal {{deposits}} in distant organs as bone marrow, could be important to identify cancer patients {{at high risk of}} relapse or disease progression. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of tissue or tumor selective mRNA is the most powerful tool for the detection of this circulating or occult metastatic cells. Our study aims to identify novel gastrointestinal cancer-specific markers for <b>circulating</b> <b>tumor</b> <b>cell</b> detection. Method: Phase I preclinical study was performed by means of computational tools for expression analysis. In silico data were used to identify and prioritize molecular markers highly expressed in gastrointestinal cancers but absent in hematopoietic-derived libraries. Selected genes were evaluated by means of qRT-PCR in gastrointestinal cancer and hematopoietic cell-lines, normal human bone marrows and bloods, tumor tissue, and blood from cancer patients. Results: Novel and known mRNA markers for <b>circulating</b> <b>tumor</b> <b>cell</b> detection in gastrointestinal cancer have been identified. Among all the genes assessed, PKP 3, AGR 2, S 100 A 16, S 100 A 6, LGALS 4, and CLDN 3 were selected and assays based on blood qRT-PCR were developed. Reliably qRT-PCR assays for the novel targets plakophilin 3 (PKP 3) and anterior gradient- 2 (AGR 2) to identify blood-borne cells in cancer patients were developed. Conclusions: Novel and known gastrointestinal-specific mRNA markers for circulating tumor cells have been identified through in silico analysis and validated in clinical material. qRT-PCR assay targeted to PKP 3 and AGR 2 mRNAs might be helpful to detect circulating tumor cells in patients with gastrointestinal cancer.
