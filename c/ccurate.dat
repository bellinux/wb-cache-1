40|$|A <b>ccurate</b> and {{reliable}} measurements of dialysate volumes {{are needed in}} a wide range of clinical and physiological studies of peritoneal dialysis. Assessment of ultrafiltration capacity and solute mass transfer during peritoneal dialysis exchanges requires estimation of infusion and drain dialysate volumes and often warrants determination of pre and postex change residual volumes. Kinetic studies of peritoneal dialysis, in addition, frequently require evaluation of changes in the intraperitoneal volume of dialysis solution during the dwell time. Several approaches for measuring these dialysate parameters have been reported in recent years (1 - 24). From these studies have evolved the preferred methods for estimating peritoneal ultrafiltration capacity, intraperitoneal residual volume, and dialysate volume as a function of dwell time.

Maintaining reliability of measurement within longitudinal studies can be especially challenging, given that test items may need to be added or removed over time to preserve sensitivity of measurement across de-velopmental stages. Such necessary modifications, as well as revision of existing instruments over time or use of alternative test forms, can threaten comparability of the resulting test scores. Without comparable measure-ment across occasions of study, one cannot determine whether any observed change in test scores over time is due to real growth or is simply an artifact of differing procedures of measurement.

In a study at San Antonio Mountain in north-central New Mexico near Antonito, Colorado, extrapolation and interpolation of surface wind velocities were compared. The methods compared were estimating surface winds at remote locations by extrapolating from nearby surface locatioro, extrapolating from 700 -mb winds, and interpolating bet ween two surface locations. Interpolation bet ween two stations provided more accurate {{estimates of}} wind velocity than did extrapolation from a nearby surface observation station or from 700 -mb winds. The error of the estimated surface winds extrapolated from 700 -mb winds was relavitely small.

40|$|Implicit {{numerical}} {{integration of}} nonlinear ODEs requires solving {{a system of}} nonlinear algebraic equations at each time step. Each of these systems is often solved by a Newton-like method, which incurs a sequence of linear-system solves. Most model-reduction techniques for nonlinear ODEs exploit knowledge of system's spatial behavior to reduce the computational complexity of each linear-system solve. However, the number of linear-system solves for the reduced-order simulation often remains roughly {{the same as that}} for the full-order simulation. We propose exploiting knowledge of the model's temporal behavior to 1) forecast the unknown variable of the reduced-order system of nonlinear equations at future time steps, and 2) use this forecast as an initial guess for the Newton-like solver during the reduced-order-model simulation. To compute the forecast, we propose using the Gappy POD technique. The goal is to generate an a <b>ccurate</b> initial guess so that the Newton solver requires many fewer iterations to converge, thereby decreasing the number of lin ear-system solves in the reduced-order-model simulation.

40|$|The preconditioned {{conjugate}} gradient (CG) method is becoming {{accepted as a}} powerful tool for solving the linear systems of equations resulting from the application of the finite element method. Applications of the non-linear algorithm are mainly confined to the diagonally scaled CG.

The preconditioning matrices used to improve the ellipticity of the problem and to reduce the computer storage requirements are obtained by the application of the partial preconditioning and the partial elimination techniques.

40|$|OBJECTIVE — We {{investigated}} whether metabolic biomarkers {{and single}} nucleotide poly-morphisms (SNPs) improve diabetes prediction beyond age, anthropometry, and lifestyle risk factors. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS — A case-cohort study within a prospective study was designed. We randomly selected a subcohort (n 2, 500) from 26, 444 participants, of whom 1, 962 were diabetes free at baseline. Of the 801 incident {{type 2 diabetes}} cases identified in the cohort during 7 years of follow-up, 579 remained for analyses after exclusions. Prediction models were compared by receiver operatoring characteristic (ROC) curve and integrated dis-crimination improvement. RESULTS — Case-control discrimination by the lifestyle characteristics (ROC-AUC: 0. 8465) im-proved with plasma glucose (ROC-AUC: 0. 8672, P 0. 001) and A 1 C (ROC-AUC: 0. 8859, P 0. 001). ROC-AUC further improved with HDL cholesterol, triglycerides, -glutamyltransferase, and alanine aminotransferase (0. 9000, P 0. 002).

40|$|A {{rapid and}} {{sensitive}} direct spectrophotometric method for {{the determination of}} cerebrospinal fluid protein which usesas little as 0. 1 ml. of sample has been de-scribed. The result is not affected by the ratio of albumin to globulin in the sample. Interfering substances are removed prior to spectrophotometric measurement with an automatic separation chamber employing the principle of gel filtration. Slight alterations of the procedure described for the measurement of protein enable one to obtain the nonprotein moiety for study or to measure proteins in other biologic fluids. A <b>CCURATE</b> DETERMINATION of protein in cerebrospinal fluid is ham-pered by the low concentration of protein present, the relatively small volume of fluid available for analysis, {{and the presence of}} relatively large amounts of different types of protein, mainly albumin and globu-lin. Plum et ci. (i) have reviewed current technics for this determina-tion and commented in detail on their inadequacies. Turbidimetric methods employing reagents such as sulfosalicylic acid give results which depend very markedly upon the relative amounts of albumin and globulin in the sample, since the degree of turbidity obtained with given amounts of these two proteins is quite different. The same diffi-culty is encountered in most colorimetric methods, along with the added problem that colorimetric reagents measure not only proteins but in many cases nonprotein nitrogenous substances.

Accurate quantifications depend on accurate determination of the mass, percentage N, and percentage 15 N enrichment of each pool and past studies have mainly used physically isolated subplots to reduce variability. We thus assessed the within-plot and within-plant variability of 15 N recovery by maize and by two hedgerow tree species, Gliricidia sepium and Peltophorum dasyrrachis, following applications of 15 N-enriched materials to unbounded plots. We also assessed the potential for estimating total plant 15 N recovery from a reduced set of samples, and for estimating N content allometrically from simple measurements. 15 N uptake beyond 1 m radius was negligible in maize but recommended minimum inter-plot spacing for Gliricidia sepium and Peltophorum dasyrrachis was 8 m. Within-plant variation was also greater in trees than in maize.

Measuring the credibility is significant since a collaborative environment generally allows anyone with Internet access to provide contribution. Collaborative web systems are susceptible to malicious users who intentionally provide inaccurate contents. With the help of reputation systems, the effect of such malicious activities can be reduced. Reputation systems allow Internet users to rate the contributions made by other users. However, there are malicious us ers who will go beyond providing wrong contributions. They attempt to make reputation systems useless by launching attacks such as slandering. Slandering happens when a malicious user or group of malicious users intentionally provide a negative rating to a <b>ccurate</b> contributions provided by good users.

40|$|Backgroud: The {{burden of}} TB and HIV {{infection}} {{is estimated to}} be about 512 / 100, 000 and 3, 000, 000 people respec tively. However, a <b>ccurate</b> data on TB/HIV co - mo r bidity in different parts of Nigeria wer e not available due to limited access to HIV Counseling and Testing (HCT) by individuals with TB infection. This study was designed to determine the true rate of HIV infection among newly diagnosed TB patients by providing comprehensive HCT services in 43 DOTS centers in Oyo State, Southwestern Nigeria. Methods: All patients meeting the case definition for TB suspects who presented at each of the 43 DOTS Centres were counse l led and those who consented tested for presence of HIV antibodies using HIV 1 / 2 Determin e, Unigold and Stat-Pak rapid test kits in a seri a l algorithm. Results: A total of 13, 109 TB positive patients were enrolled for the study, out of which 1605 (12. 3 %) tested positive for HIV antibodies. HIV infection was higher among female (15. 5 %) than male (9. 5 %) TB patients (p 0. 05). The rates also varied among the age groups, ranging from 4. 3 % in the 10 - 19 years to 18. 0 % in the 40 - 49 years age group. A relatively high rate (10. 5 %) of HIV infection was found among children less than ten years of age. Conclusion: The results of this work show the true burden of TB/HIV in any region in Nigeria for the first time. Higher rate of TB/HIV co-infection among female patients and children are significant and important factors that should be considered in the planning of interven tion measures in Nigeria and other TB and HIV endemic countries in Africa. </p...|$|E

INTR~Du~~I~N <b>CCURATE</b> characterization of high-speed optoelec-A tronic components {{is essential to the}} design and implementation of systems such as high-speed optical links. For photodiodes, a number of characterization methods have been studied, including pulse spectrum analysis [11, optical heterodyne detection [2]-[5], and response of a photodetector to a directly or externally modulated laser source [6]- [lo] or to white optical noise [111. Comparison of results from various methods of characterization has been discussed previously [6], [9], [ll], [12], and further work is in progress [131, [14). The various characterization methods are not equivalent. For example, impulse response measurements allow prediction and minimization of the influence of the detector on eye pattern measurements, whereas the scalar (magnitude only) information available from an optical heterodyne setup is insufficient. On the other hand. narrow resonances that are readily characterized with the optical heterodyne setup may not be fully resolved in a pulse response measurement. In this paper we report characterization of high-speed photodetectors by optical heterodyne and pulse response techniques and compare the results. Linearity of the detector response is verified, validating comparison in the frequency domain using a Fourier transform of the pulse response data. The comparison is limited to the magnitude of the transfer function in the frequency domain, since the optical heterodyne technique does not give phase information.

40|$|One of the {{objectives}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate soil testing equipment based on its capability of measuring in-place stiffness or modulus values. As design criteria transition from empirical to mechanistic-empirical, soil test methods and equipment that measure properties such as stiffness and modulus and how they relate to Florida materials are needed. Requirements for the selected equipment are that they be portable, cost effective, reliable, a <b>ccurate,</b> and repeatable. A second objective is that the selected equipment measures soil properties without the use of nuclear materials. The current device used to measure soil compaction is the nuclear density gauge (NDG). Equipment evaluated in this research included lightweight deflectometers (LWD) from different manufacturers, a dynamic cone penetrometer (DCP), a GeoGauge, a Clegg impact soil tester (CIST), a Briaud compaction device (BCD), and a seismic pavement analyzer (SPA). Evaluations were conducted over ranges of measured densities and moistures. Testing (Phases I and II) was conducted in a test box and test pits. Phase III testing was conducted on materials found on five construction projects located in the Jacksonville, Florida, area. Phase I analyses determined that the GeoGauge had the lowest overall coefficient of variance (COV). In ascending order of COV were the accelerometer-type LWD, the geophone-type LWD, the DCP, the BCD, and the SPA which had the highest overall COV. As a result, the BCD and the SPA were excluded from Phase II testing. In Phase II, measurements obtained from the selected equipment were compared to the modulus values obtained by the static plate load test (PLT), the resilient modulus (MR) from laboratory testing, and the NDG measurements. To minimize soil and moisture content variability, the single spot testing sequence was developed. At each location, test results obtained from the portable equipment under evaluation were compared to the values from adjacent NDG, PLT, and laboratory MR measurements. Correlations were developed through statistical analysis. Target values were developed for various soils for verification on similar soils that were field tested in Phase III. The single spot testing sequence also was employed in Phase III, field testing performed on A- 3 and A- 2 - 4 embankments, limerock-stabilized subgrade, limerock base, and graded aggregate base found on Florida Department of Transportation construction projects. The Phase II and Phase III results provided potential trend information for future research—specifically, data collection for in-depth statistical analysis for correlations with the laboratory MR for specific soil types under specific moisture conditions. With the collection of enough data, stronger relationships could be expected between measurements from the portable equipment and the MR values. Based on the statistical analyses and the experience gained from extensive use of the equipment, the combination of the DCP and the LWD was selected for in-place soil testing for compaction control acceptance. Test methods and developmental specifications were written for the DCP and the LWD. The developmental specifications include target values for the compaction control of embankment, subgrade, and base materials...|$|E
