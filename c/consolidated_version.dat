25|$|The 9th-century Catalogue of Fortresses and Regions to the North of the Danubewhich {{lists the}} peoples along {{the borders of}} East Francia in a north-to-south ordermentions that the Moravians or Marharii had 11 fortresses or civitates. The {{document}} locates the Marhari between the Bohemians and the Bulgars, and also makes mention of the Merehani and their 30 fortresses. According to Havlík, who writes that Conversion is a <b>consolidated</b> <b>version</b> of notes made by several authors in different years, the Moravians are twice mentioned in the text: first as Marhari, and next as Merehani. He says, that the reference to the Marhari and their 11 fortresses was made between 817 and 843, and the note of the Merehani shows the actual state under Svatopluk I. In contrast with Havlík, Steinhübel together with Třeštík and Vlasto identify the Meherani with {{the inhabitants of the}} Principality of Nitra. A third view is presented by Püspöki-Nagy and Senga, who write that the reference to the Merehaniiwho obviously inhabited the southern regions of the Great Hungarian Plains {{to the north of the}} Danube, but south of the territories dominated by the Bulgarsand their 30 fortresses shows the existence of an other Moravia in Central Europe.|$|E

2500|$|Under the {{direction}} of Nugroho Notosusanto of the Armed Forces History Centre, Indonesia published in 1966 its first account of the coup, [...] "which was largely a <b>consolidated</b> <b>version</b> of Army propaganda setting out 'proof' that the coup attempt was a Communist plot". In 1967, Guy Pauker, an analyst of Indonesian affairs for the RAND Corporation informed the Army {{of the existence of}} the [...] "Cornell Paper" [...] and its proposed theories. According to University of Melbourne scholar Katharine E. McGregor, the U.S. government-sponsored RAND Corporation [...] "clearly acted to help the New Order regime defend its version of the coup and hence its legitimacy". In conjunction with Lieutenant Colonel Ismail Saleh and Pauker, Nugroho worked to publish an English version of the Army's account during his visit to California in 1967. The foreword to the publication stated that it was written in response to [...] "a campaign waged by certain circles in Western countries against the New Order government". The work itself argued that the coup attempt was not an internal military affair after taking into account the testimonies of PKI members made during a series of military trials.|$|E

Two types of versioning have been separately considered so far: branching and temporal.

In this work, we propose a general model which integrates the two approaches by supporting both design and temporal schema versions. The model is provided with a complete set of schema change primitives for full-fledged version manipulation whose semantics is described in the paper...|$|R

40|$|Security Requirements Engineering is an {{emerging}} field which {{lies at the}} crossroads of Security and Software Engineering. Much research has focused on this field in recent years, spurred by the realization that security must be dealt with in the earliest phases of the software development process as these phases cover a broader organizational perspective. Agent-oriented methodologies have proved to be especially useful in this setting as they support the modeling of the social context in which the system-to-be will operate. In our previous work, we proposed the SI* modeling language to deal with security and trust, and the Secure Tropos methodology for designing secure software systems. Since then, both have been revised and refined in light of experience gained from their application to several industry case studies. This chapter presents the <b>consolidated</b> <b>versions</b> of the SI* modeling language and the Secure Tropos methodology and recounts our experiences, explaining the practical and theoretical reasons behind each consolidation step...|$|R
40|$|Since the {{beginning}} of its existence {{in the form of}} communities, the European Union’s decision making process underwent constant evolution. There were continuous adjustments that transformed a pure intergovernmental process into one having rather federal features. Based on the hypothesis that changes have occurred at the decision level in regards to the actors, procedures, influence and ways of taking decisions in order for the new realities, needs and will at the European level to be properly addressed, this paper aims to present the reforms performed through the adoption of new treaties and the modification of the existing ones. The reality is that in order for the European dream and integration to go on and also for further development of the European Union, finally becoming an entity far beyond the founders expectations, decision makers had to constantly and carefully adapt the decision making process. The purpose of this paper will be achieved by conducting a research based on the qualitative method, analyzing the related researches on this topic and the <b>consolidated</b> <b>versions</b> of the treaties. Thus, we will finally validate our research hypothesis that there was an evolution in what the EU’s decision making process and decision procedures are concerned...|$|R

Reports from the combat zone showed that Liberator squadrons with 30-caliber nose guns were sustaining very high casualty rates. Newer {{models of the}} Liberator destined for Army use (B-24H with Emerson or Consolidated turrets) did not come off the assembly lines until June 1943. PB4Y-1 Liberators destined for Navy use {{did not get the}} refit at NAS San Diego with ERCO 250SH-1 powered turrets with twin 50-caliber gun mounts until after May 1943. VB-102 was scheduled to go into combat before any of the refitted models could be obtained. In a flash of inspiration, Commander Chick Hayward, who was in command of the newly established Patrol Service Wing at Kaneohe, decided that tail gun turrets (<b>Consolidated</b> <b>versions)</b> in the slow and unwieldy PB2Y-2 Coronado seaplanes then sitting on the ramp awaiting maintenance or cargo runs to the mainland—would be more useful in the noses of the PB4Y-1s which were going into combat. A few days later the commander of the PB2Y squadron walked down on the ramp to find all the tail turrets of his aircraft missing! They had been put in the noses of the VB-102 aircraft.|$|R

However, users have different preferences and evolving requirements. It is not practical to attempt perfect schema definitions with strict constraints.

We propose a system called StYLiD for sharing wide variety of structured information. Users freely define their own structured concepts. The system <b>consolidates</b> different <b>versions</b> defined by different users. Combined search and browsing can be done. Popular concepts gradually emerge from the concept cloud and stabilize. Concept definitions are flexible. The suggestive range for attribute values does not constrain the contributors.
