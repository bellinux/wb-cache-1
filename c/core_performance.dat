40|$|Previous {{reviews of}} the {{literature}} on the relationship between age and job performance have largely focused on <b>core</b> task <b>performance</b> but have paid much less attention to other job behaviors that also contribute to productivity. The current study provides an expanded meta-analysis on the relationship between age and job performance that includes 10 dimensions of job performance: <b>core</b> task <b>performance,</b> creativity, performance in training programs, organizational citizenship behaviors, safety performance, general counterproductive work behaviors, workplace aggression, on-the-job substance use, tardiness, and absenteeism. Results show that although age was largely unrelated to <b>core</b> task <b>performance,</b> creativity, and performance in training programs, it demonstrated stronger relationships with the other 7 performance dimensions. Results also highlight that the relationships of age with <b>core</b> task <b>performance</b> and with counterproductive work behaviors are curvilinear in nature and that several sample characteristics and data collection characteristics moderate age-performance relationships. The article concludes with a discussion of key research design issues that may further knowledge about the age-performance relationship in the future. © 2008 American Psychological Association. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

40|$|This study {{explores the}} role of work {{engagement}} as an affective – motivational mechanism through which transformational leadership may relate to proactive behaviour. In line with a resource-based approach (Hobfoll, 1989), we hypothesize that employees only invest resources provided through work engagement into proactivity when job strain is low. Under conditions of high job strain, work engagement {{is less likely to}} translate into proactive behaviours. In contrast, for <b>core</b> task-related job <b>performance,</b> we expect work engagement to be positively related to <b>core</b> job <b>performance</b> regardless of job strain. The hypotheses were tested in a multisource field study among 148 employee – colleague dyads. Focal employees self-rated their work engagement, job strain, and their supervisor’s transformational leadership. Employee proactivity (personal initiative and voice behaviour) and <b>core</b> job <b>performance</b> were rated by colleagues. The findings support the moderated mediation model. Transformational leadership related positively to work engagement and in turn to proactivity in terms of both personal initiative and voice. Low job strain formed a necessary precondition for work engagement to translate into higher proactivity, whereas the relationship between work engagement and <b>core</b> job <b>performance</b> was independent from job strain...|$|R

There is also a special TurboCore mode that can turn off half of the cores from an eight-core processor, but those 4 cores have access to all the memory controllers and L3 cache at increased clock speeds. This makes each core's performance higher which is important for workloads which require the fastest sequential performance at the cost of reduced parallel performance.

40|$|The history {{behind the}} {{evolution}} of the American postsecondary education has imitated the European system {{with the exception of the}} community college. The community college strives to meet the needs of all students with an enrollment open door policy. This study examined relationships between student demographics and the achievement of <b>core</b> <b>performance</b> indicators by Ohio community colleges. The <b>core</b> <b>performance</b> indicators measure technical skill attainment; credential, certificate, or degree achievement; student retention or transfer; student placement; and nontraditional participation and completion. Using archived data from 2007 - 2013 required by the Carl D. Perkins Career and Technical Education Act of 2006, a linear mixed model analysis was performed discovering significant relationships between the <b>core</b> <b>performance</b> indicators and other demographic factors such as, gender, race, students who meet the definition of students with disabilities, students who are economically disadvantaged, students who are displaced homemakers, students with limited English proficiency, and those students pursuing nontraditional careers for their gender. The linear mixed model was used due to the fixed effects of the student demographics, and the Ohio community colleges as random factors. The cohort years comprised the repeated measure. The results of the LMM indicated that the factor of gender was significant under two of the <b>core</b> <b>performance</b> indicators with positive impact towards achieving the target goal by the community college. Race was found significant under all <b>core</b> <b>performance</b> indicators with positive impact. Students meetings the definition of disabilities, displaced homemakers, and those students seeking nontraditional career paths each had significance under one <b>core</b> <b>performance</b> indicator. Students meeting the definition of economically disadvantaged were found significant under three different <b>core</b> <b>performance</b> indicators with positive impact. Single parent status negatively impacted the achievement of the <b>core</b> <b>performance</b> indicators. Students with limited English proficiency were found to be significant twice under different <b>core</b> <b>performance</b> indicators, once with positive impact and once with negative impact. Understanding the relationships of the effects may enable Ohio community colleges to better use their limited resources based on the needs of the students attending each statewide location.
