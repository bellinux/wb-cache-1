40|$|During {{the last}} decade laser {{scanning}} {{turned out to be}} one of the most promising techniques in photogrammetry. Some photogrammetrists even say that laser scanning has caused a paradigm change in photogrammetry because of its big impact on methods like DTM generation or 3 D city model reconstruction. Originally, laser scanning was designed for DTM generation in forest areas. For that purpose several filtering approaches had been proposed and partly realized in commercial systems. This paper describes another alternative for filtering of laser scanning data. It combines a pre-filter based on a convex hull and a subsequent finite element adjustment. The pre-filter creates a <b>crude</b> <b>TIN</b> DTM assuming that the lowest measured laser points are representing the terrain accurately enough. The following adjustment of this TIN utilizes all laser points except non-ground points. This leads to a slight height change of the TIN points according to statistical and geometrical constraints and to a better approximation of the terrain. The method works hierarchically in a data pyramid starting from a coarse point density of about 4 m. The preliminary system has been successfully applied to laser scanning data that have been captured by the TopoSys system in a test site located in the National Park Bavarian Forest. The results show clearly that the method is successfully applicable in forests areas with different forest structures. The accuracy derived in controlled tests lies in the range of 15 – 25 cm and is also equivalent to the DTM quality of standard filtering procedures. 1. 1 General remarks 1...|$|E
40|$|The {{tin metal}} could be {{retractable}} from wasted tin scrap, sludge, and wasted electroplated solution hydrometallurgical treatment, and purification process. In {{order to be}} used as resource of electronic devices, the retracted crude metal should be purified to the extent of higher than 99. 9 %. In this study, tin electro-refining process was performed to purify the casted <b>tin</b> <b>crude</b> metal at various experimental conditions: at the current density of 3, 5 A/dm 2, and in various electrolytes such as hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid and methansulfonic acid. Additional experiment was conducted using Rotating Disk Electrode (RDE) in order to investigate the rate determining step of tin electro-refining process. The current efficiency, 65. 6 %, was achievable at the condition of current density, 5 A/dm 2, and in the electrolyte of Hydrochloric acid. During tin electro-refining process, impurity dissolved from <b>tin</b> <b>crude</b> metal into the electrolyte was analyzed using Inductively Coupled Plasma Optical Emission Spectrometer (ICP-OES), and the result showed the concentration of impurity metal gradually increased. Quantitative analysis on casted <b>tin</b> <b>crude</b> metal showed that it consists of tin with 93. 9 wt. % and several impurity metals of Ag, Bi, Pb, Cu, and etc. After tin electro-refining process, the purity of tin increased up to 99. 985 wt. %...|$|R
50|$|Brazil and Bolivia {{have been}} working on {{expanding}} and diversifying trade between the two countries {{in the last quarter of}} 2008. The 6th Meeting of the Commission for Monitoring Brazil-Bolivia trade was used to this end. As it stood, at the time Brazil was the main destination for exports from Bolivia, having bought, in 2007, 35.7% of the products that Bolivian companies sell to other countries. They were also the main exporter to Bolivia, sending 24.7% of products imported into Bolivia. As industrialized products represented 94.6% of Brazilian sales up to September of the year, Bolivian sales in the same period were limited largely to natural gas, which accounted for up to 92.7% of the total purchased from the country, or US$1.89 billion. The products with the greatest scope for an increase in trade from Brazil to Bolivia were crude oil, insecticides, aircraft, vehicle engines, soy in grain, vegetable oils and ironworks products, amongst others. From Bolivia to Brazil, products such as animal feed, vegetable oil, <b>crude</b> oil, <b>tin,</b> ores of precious metals, precious gems, dried and fresh fruit, plants, leather and garments were also capable of seeing sales grow.|$|R
40|$|Myanmar, {{formerly}} known as Burma, has large mineral resources of gemstones and considerable resources of offshore natural gas. Myanmar produced {{a wide variety of}} minerals, which included barite, carbonate rocks, chromium, clays, coal, copper, feldspar, gold, gypsum, lead, natural gas, nickel, petroleum, salt, silver, tin, tungsten, and zinc. The country also produced processed mineral products, which included cement, refined copper, polished precious gemstones, refined gold, refined lead, refined petroleum products, refined silver, <b>crude</b> steel, refined <b>tin,</b> and nitrogen fertilizer materials (table 1). With the exception of precious gemstones, Myanmar’s minerals production was small in quantity and was mostly for domestic consumption. None of Myanmar’s mineral production was of world significance. The mining sector, which included oil and gas, contributed about 2 % to Myanmar’s gross domestic product (GDP), which was estimated to be $ 14. 2 billion. The country’s GDP growth was 10. 9 %, and inflation was about 3. 6 % in fiscal year 1999 - 2000 (the last year for which data are available by th...|$|R
