50|$|<b>Crashbox</b> is a Canadian-American {{educational}} children's television {{game show}} that airs on the HBO Family digital cable television channel in the United States. It aims to educate grade-school children in history, math, vocabulary, and other various subjects. <b>Crashbox</b> {{is known for}} many famous guest appearances, including voice acting from Ralph Macchio, Joyce DeWitt and Gilbert O'Sullivan.|$|E

5000|$|Chassis Frame material/construction: St37 tubular {{space frame}} Bodywork (material): carbon fiber <b>Crashbox</b> (material): {{aluminum}} honeycomb Suspension Suspension type Front: double equal length A-arms with push rods Rear: double equal length A-arms with push rods ...|$|E
50|$|The chassis is {{a carbon}} fiber {{monocoque}} with a steel roll cage, all by Dallara. There are also <b>crashboxes</b> {{which are based}} on the FIA LMP1 regulations from 2014. All of the bodywork is made of composite.|$|R
40|$|Two {{different}} closed-cell aluminium foams, {{manufactured by}} compact powder technology starting from 7075 and 6061 alloys, were studied {{with the aim}} of investigating the effect of heat treatments on their axial crushing behaviour. By means of scanning electron microscopy/energy-dispersive spectroscopy analyses, the crushing response was investigated in an attempt to understand how heat treatments may improve the absorbing efficiency of <b>crashboxes.</b> (C) 2009 Acta Materialia Inc.

50|$|For the {{relaunch}} in 2010 Van Diemen {{was selected}} as the supplier of the spec chassis for the series. Initially the car was named the Van Diemen DP08 the car was renamed Élan DP08 after Van Diemen was fully integrated into the latter. The car was initially designed to compete in the SCCA Formula Continental ranks but was heavily upgraded to run in the USF2000 series. The upgrades included a stronger steel spaceframe, improved side <b>crashboxes</b> and new brakes. Elite Engines {{was selected as}} the sole engine builder for the series. The company headed by former driver Steve Knapp builds the engines before shipping them to the Andersen Promotions headquarters.|$|R
50|$|<b>Crashbox</b> {{was one of}} the {{cornerstone}} programs for the relaunch of the HBO Family channel in February 1999. The series has never been released on DVD or VHS, but remains on HBO Family to this day.|$|E

40|$|Three {{different}} aluminium foams, {{manufactured by}} compact powder technology starting from 7075, 6061 and AlSi 7 alloys were studied by performing microstructural and morphometric analyses, {{with the aim}} of explaining their different behaviour during axial crushing. Void distribution coupled with material microstructure justifies the behaviour of load-displacement curves obtained during axial crushing of the foams. The results show that 7075 alloy seems to be the material having the best behaviour during crushing, at least when the foam is removed of the external walls. Despite that outer skin presence coupled with the intrinsic brittle behaviour of this alloy may cause instability, if it is used to fill hollow components like <b>crashboxes.</b> During deformation process 6061 and AlSi 7 alloys that are more ductile, give in and maintain contact adapting to the encasement deformation.

5000|$|Shadowmation is a {{relatively}} new technique, but has so far been used in several prominent children's television shows, including Disney's The Book of Pooh, PBS's It's a Big, Big World, Bear in the Big Blue House and CBC Television and Discovery Kids' Wilbur. The [...] "Revolting Slob" [...] segments on <b>Crashbox</b> also use this technique.|$|E

50|$|After {{her work}} in Ri¢hie Ri¢h (1994), she co-starred in the movie Multiplicity, as Beth, and after that, as Eva in Normal Life, Fine Line, and Darlene Patterson in That Thing You Do!, all in 1996. However she {{played the role of}} Allison Douglas in Adam also playing the role of Caitlin in Hope & Gloria. In 1997 she starred in mainly {{television}} as Marie in Soul Man and Connie in Just Shoot Me!. Once the year of 1998 started she starred as Stacy in I-5 and Natalie in Ringmaster. A year after that she played the minor role of a Salesgirl in My Favorite Martian. After that she stayed in the television business as Kimberly Sutter in Sons of Thunder and Valley girl voice in <b>Crashbox.</b>|$|E
50|$|Pursuing new projects, Motiki {{continued}} to host various programs and live events. He also started voice acting in numerous animated series. His first was <b>Crashbox</b> on HBO, playing the digitally enhanced stop motion character Professor Rocket, {{both on the}} show and in a cycle of shorts entitled Who Knew?. He then provided the voice of Rocky Canyon for the TV series Rescue Heroes, subsequently voicing Rocky Canyon for the Fisher-Price action figures and the 2003 film Rescue Heroes: The Movie. He voiced Metabee on the anime series Medabots which aired on FOX. He also played the part of South African data raider Ozubo Monduma/Conjureman, who is recruited alongside five other international beta testers to save Earth in the web series 7th Portal, produced by Stan Lee Media.|$|E
50|$|In {{the late}} 1990s, Stiller {{appeared}} {{in a series of}} Nike television commercials as the ghost of deceased Green Bay Packers head coach Vince Lombardi. Stiller has appeared in various motion pictures, most notably Zoolander (2001) and Secret of the Andes (1999). On February 9, 2007, Stiller and Meara were honored with a joint star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. On October 28, 2010, the couple appeared on an episode of The Daily Show with Jon Stewart. Stiller voiced the announcer on the children's educational show <b>Crashbox.</b> Starting in October 2010, Stiller and Meara began starring in a Yahoo web series, Stiller & Meara from Red Hour Digital, in which they discussed current topics. Each episode was about two minutes long. As of 2012, Stiller has been a spokesman for Xfinity.|$|E
40|$|In {{this work}} the crash {{behaviour}} of a trapezoidal bar is investigated using the software LS-DYNA of LSTC. A possible application {{might be a}} <b>crashbox</b> in a helicopter floor. The hybrid structure of the bar consists of both carbon and aramid fabrics. In total four loading conditions are determined. Crash experiments and simulations have already been made in 2000 / 2001 at the Institute of Structures and Design of the German Aerospace Center DLR within a diploma thesis. At that time they used the software PAM-CRASH of ESI to forecast the crash behaviour. In particular the global force-displacement-curves have been generated. In this work the crash procedure of the bar is to be simulated again, using LS-DYNA of LSTC. The main interest is to evaluate the material models for composites by comparing the simulation results with existing data of the former experiments. Thereby {{the focus is on}} many parameters within the material model to be sure about there influence on crash behaviour. The assembling of the finite element model is explained step by step. Theoretical principles of nonlinear FE computation are given...|$|E
