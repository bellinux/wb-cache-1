25|$|The gap {{caused by}} the digital divide in China is {{beginning}} to close. The percentage of the Chinese population using the internet has been increasing dramatically each year. In the year 2000 only 1.7 percent of the Chinese population were internet users. By 2010 that percentage had increased to 31.6 percent of the population. This data shows that the gap separating China {{and the rest of}} the world is closing. However, the digital divide among Chinese citizens remains strong. Many Chinese citizens are faced with the issues of the digital divide because of their income, education, or location. While China has made great strides in improving the country's <b>communication</b> <b>infrastructure</b> as well as narrowing the overall digital divide, there remains a divide between urban and rural areas of the country. This divide between rural and urban, developed and under developed, is illustrated in the lack of ICTs between the western (i.e., Xinjiang province) and eastern (i.e., Jiangsu province) parts of the country.|$|E

2500|$|The {{creation}} of a modern industrial economy took place. With the {{creation of}} a transportation and <b>communication</b> <b>infrastructure,</b> the corporation became the dominant form of business organization and a managerial revolution transformed business operations. In 1890, Congress passed the Sherman Antitrust Act—the source of all American anti-monopoly laws. The law forbade every contract, scheme, deal, or conspiracy to restrain trade, though the phrase [...] "restraint of trade" [...] remained subjective. By the beginning of the 20th century, per capita income and industrial production in the United States exceeded that of any other country except Britain. Long hours and hazardous working conditions led many workers to attempt to form labor unions despite strong opposition from industrialists and the courts. But the courts did protect the marketplace, declaring the Standard Oil group to be an [...] "unreasonable" [...] monopoly under the Sherman Antitrust Act in 1911. It ordered Standard to break up into 34 independent companies with different boards of directors.|$|E
2500|$|An initial plan, {{given to}} the Eastern Command by General (later Field Marshal) [...] Sam Manekshaw, {{involved}} an incursion into East Pakistan and the capture of the provinces of Chittagong and Khulna. Senior Indian Army officers were reluctant to execute an aggressive invasion for fears of early ceasefire demands by the United Nations and a looming threat posed by China. That, together with the difficulty of navigating the marshy terrain of East Pakistan through three wide rivers, led the commanders to initially believe that the capture of all of East Pakistan was not possible. Jacob disagreed; his [...] "war of movement" [...] plan aimed {{to take control of}} all of East Pakistan. Jacob felt that the capital Dhaka was the geopolitical centre of the region, and that any successful campaign had to involve the eventual capture of Dhaka. Realizing that the Pakistani Army commander, Lt. General A. A. K. Niazi, was going to fortify the towns and [...] "defend them in strength", his plan was to bypass intermediary towns altogether, neutralize Pakistan's command and <b>communication</b> <b>infrastructure,</b> and use secondary routes reach Dhaka. Jacob's plan was eventually approved by the Eastern Command.|$|E
2500|$|Communications: Curiosity is {{equipped}} with several means of communication, for redundancy. An X band Small Deep Space Transponder for communication directly to Earth via the NASA Deep Space Network and a UHF Electra-Lite software-defined radio for communicating with Mars orbiters. [...] The X-band system has one radio, with a 15W power amplifier, and two antennas: a low-gain omnidirectional antenna that can communicate with Earth at very low data rates (15bit/s at maximum range), regardless of rover orientation, and a high-gain antenna that can communicate at speeds up to 32kbit/s, but must be aimed. The UHF system has two radios (approximately 9W transmit power), sharing one omnidirectional antenna. This can communicate with the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) and 2001 Mars Odyssey orbiter (ODY) at speeds up to 2Mbit/s and 256kbit/s, respectively, but each orbiter is only {{able to communicate with}} Curiosity for about 8 minutes per day. [...] The orbiters have larger antennas and more powerful radios, and can relay data to Earth faster than the rover could do directly. Therefore, most of the data returned by Curiosity (MSL), is via the UHF relay links with MRO and ODY. The data return via the <b>communication</b> <b>infrastructure</b> as implemented at MSL, and observed during the first 10 days was approximately 31 megabytes per day.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—We {{propose a}} {{wireless}} sensor networks deployment strategy for constructing wireless <b>communication</b> <b>infrastructures</b> for a rescue robot with considering a throughput between sensor nodes (SNs). Recent studies for reducing disaster damage focus on a disaster area information gathering in underground spaces. Since information gathering activities in such post disaster underground spaces present {{a high risk of}} personal injury by secondary disasters, a lot of rescue workers were injured or killed in the past. Because of this background, gathering information by utilizing the rescue robot is discussed in wide area. However, there are no wireless <b>communication</b> <b>infrastructures</b> for teleoperation of rescue robot in the post-disaster environment such as the underground space. Therefore, we have been discussing the construction method of wireless <b>communication</b> <b>infrastructures</b> for remotely operated the rescue robot by utilizing the rescue robot.
