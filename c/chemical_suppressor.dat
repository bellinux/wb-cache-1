40|$|SummaryGenetic {{screening}} for suppressor mutants {{has been successfully}} used to identify important signaling regulators. Using an analogy to genetic suppressor screening, we developed a <b>chemical</b> <b>suppressor</b> screening method to identify inhibitors of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. We used zebrafish embryos in which chemically induced β-catenin accumulation led to an “eyeless” phenotype and conducted a pilot {{screening for}} compounds that restored eye development. This approach allowed us to identify geranylgeranyltransferase inhibitor 286 (GGTI- 286), a geranylgeranyltransferase (GGTase) inhibitor. Our follow-up studies showed that GGTI- 286 reduces nuclear localization of β-catenin and transcription dependent on β-catenin/T cell factor in mammalian cells. In addition to pharmacological inhibition, GGTase gene knockdown also attenuates the nuclear function of β-catenin. Overall, we validate our <b>chemical</b> <b>suppressor</b> screening as a method for identifying Wnt/β-catenin pathway inhibitors and implicate GGTase as a potential therapeutic target for Wnt-activated cancers...|$|E

The {{influence of the}} central metal on these properties was analyzed according to solvent type, axial ligands and their paramagnetic and diamagnetic effect. Fluorescence lifetimes were recorded using a time correlated single photon counting setup (TCSPC) technique. In order to demonstrate the generation of reactive oxygen species under light irradiation, the indirect method (applying 1, 3 -diphenylisobenzofuran (DPBF) as <b>chemical</b> <b>suppressor)</b> and the direct method (analyzing the phosphorescence decay curves of singlete oxygen at 1270 nm) were employed. Compounds 1, 2 and 3 showed a monomeric behavior in all media while compound 4 presented low aggregation in DMSO, but a very pronounced aggregation behavior in THF. Steady-state fluorescence anisotropy was compared with emission spectra and complex 4 presented values beyond the expected limits.   DOI: [URL]  </p...|$|E
40|$|AbstractNiemann–Pick type C (NP-C) {{disease is}} a {{progressive}} neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the inappropriate accumulation of unesterified cholesterol in lysosomes [1]. NP-C patients show various defects including hepatosplenomegaly, ataxia, dystonia and dementia. Most cases of NP-C are associated with inactivating mutations of the NPC 1 gene [2], which encodes a protein implicated in the retrograde transport of sterols and other cargo from lysosomes [3]. Furthermore, localization of the NPC 1 protein to lysosomal/endosomal compartments is essential for proper transport [4]. To create a model of NP-C disease in a simple, genetically tractable organism, we generated deletion mutations in two Caenorhabditis elegans homologs of the human NPC 1 gene, designated npc- 1 and npc- 2. Animals mutant for npc- 1 developed slowly, laid eggs prematurely, and were hypersensitive to cholesterol deprivation. Furthermore, npc- 1; npc- 2 double-mutant animals inappropriately formed dauer larvae under favorable growth conditions. These phenotypes in C. elegans provide a model system for both genetic and <b>chemical</b> <b>suppressor</b> screening that could identify promising drug targets and leads for NP-C disease...|$|E
40|$|As a model {{organism}} Saccharomyces cerevisiae {{has greatly}} contributed {{to our understanding}} of many fundamental aspects of cellular biology in higher eukaryotes. More recently, engineered yeast models developed to study endogenous or heterologous proteins that lay at the root of a given disease have become powerful tools for unraveling the molecular basis of complex human diseases like neurodegeneration. Additionally, with the possibility of performing target-directed large-scale screenings, yeast models have emerged as promising first-line approaches in the discovery process of novel therapeutic opportunities against these pathologies. In this paper, several yeast models that have contributed to the uncovering of the etiology and pathogenesis of several neurodegenerative diseases are described, including the most common forms of neurodegeneration worldwide, Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and Huntington's diseases. Moreover, the potential input of these cell systems in the development of more effective therapies in neurodegeneration, through the identification of genetic and <b>chemical</b> <b>suppressors,</b> is also addressed...|$|R
40|$|The DNA/RNA-binding {{proteins}} TDP- 43 and FUS {{are found}} in protein aggregates in {{a growing number of}} neurodegenerative diseases, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and related dementia, but {{little is known about the}} neurotoxic mechanisms. We have generated Caenorhabditis elegans and zebrafish animal models expressing mutant human TDP- 43 (A 315 T or G 348 C) or FUS (S 57 Δ or R 521 H) that reflect certain aspects of ALS including motor neuron degeneration, axonal deficits, and progressive paralysis. To explore the potential of our humanized transgenic C. elegans and zebrafish in identifying <b>chemical</b> <b>suppressors</b> of mutant TDP- 43 and FUS neuronal toxicity, we tested three compounds with potential neuroprotective properties: lithium chloride, methylene blue and riluzole. We identified methylene blue as a potent suppressor of TDP- 43 and FUS toxicity in both our models. Our results indicate that methylene blue can rescue toxic phenotypes associated with mutant TDP- 43 and FUS including neuronal dysfunction and oxidative stress...|$|R
40|$|In human cancer, PTEN (Phosphatase and TENsin homolog on {{chromosome}} 10, {{also referred}} to as MMAC 1 and TEP 1) is a frequently mutated tumor suppressor gene. We have used the zebrafish as a model to investigate the role of Pten in embryonic development and tumorigenesis. The zebrafish genome encodes two pten genes, ptena and ptenb. Here, we report that both Pten gene products from zebrafish are functional. Target-selected inactivation of ptena and ptenb revealed that Ptena and Ptenb have redundant functions in embryonic development, in that ptena-/- and ptenb-/- mutants did not show embryonic phenotypes. Homozygous single mutants survived as adults and they were viable and fertile. Double homozygous ptena-/-ptenb-/- mutants died at 5 days post fertilization with pleiotropic defects. These defects were rescued by treatment with the phosphatidylinositol- 3 -kinase inhibitor, LY 294002. Double homozygous embryos showed enhanced cellular proliferation. In addition, cell survival was dramatically enhanced in embryos that lack functional Pten upon gamma-irradiation. Surprisingly, adult ptenb-/- zebrafish developed ocular tumors later in life, despite the expression of ptena in adult eyes. We conclude that whereas Ptena and Ptenb have redundant functions in embryonic development, they apparently do not have completely overlapping functions later in life. These pten mutant zebrafish represent a unique model to screen for genetic and/or <b>chemical</b> <b>suppressors</b> of Pten loss-of-function...|$|R
40|$|The sarco-endoplasmic {{reticulum}} Ca(2 +) -transport ATPase (SERCA) loads intracellular releasable Ca(2 +) stores by transporting cytosolic Ca(2 +) {{into the}} endoplasmic (ER) or sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR). We characterized the only SERCA homologue of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, which is encoded by the sca- 1 gene. The sca- 1 transcript is alternatively spliced {{in a similar}} mode as the vertebrate SERCA 2 transcript, giving rise to two protein variants: CeSERCAa and CeSERCAb. These proteins showed structural and functional conservation to the vertebrate SERCA 2 a/b proteins. The CeSERCAs were primarily expressed in contractile tissues. Loss of CeSERCA through gene ablation or RNA interference resulted in contractile dysfunctioning and in early larval or embryonic lethality, respectively. Similar defects could be induced pharmacologically using the SERCA-specific inhibitor thapsigargin, which bound CeSERCA at a conserved site. The conservation of SERCA 2 homologues in C. elegans will allow genetic and <b>chemical</b> <b>suppressor</b> analyses to identify promising drug targets and lead molecules for treatment of SERCA-related diseases such as heart disease. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Tightly {{regulated}} Ca(2 +) homeostasis is {{a prerequisite}} for proper cardiac function. To dissect the regulatory network of cardiac Ca(2 +) handling, we performed a <b>chemical</b> <b>suppressor</b> screen on zebrafish tremblor embryos, which suffer from Ca(2 +) extrusion defects. Efsevin was identified based on its potent activity to restore coordinated contractions in tremblor. We show that efsevin binds to VDAC 2, potentiates mitochondrial Ca(2 +) uptake and accelerates the transfer of Ca(2 +) from intracellular stores into mitochondria. In cardiomyocytes, efsevin restricts the temporal and spatial boundaries of Ca(2 +) sparks and thereby inhibits Ca(2 +) overload-induced erratic Ca(2 +) waves and irregular contractions. We further show that overexpression of VDAC 2 recapitulates the suppressive effect of efsevin on tremblor embryos whereas VDAC 2 deficiency attenuates efsevin 2 ̆ 7 s rescue effect and that VDAC 2 functions synergistically with MCU to suppress cardiac fibrillation in tremblor. Together, these findings demonstrate a critical modulatory role for VDAC 2 -dependent mitochondrial Ca(2 +) uptake in the regulation of cardiac rhythmicity...|$|E
40|$|Vitamin D is a known {{modulator}} of inflammation. Native dietary vitamin D 3 {{is thought}} to be bio-inactive, and beneficial vitamin D 3 effects are thought to be largely mediated by the metabolite 1, 25 (OH) 2 D 3. Reduced serum levels of the most commonly measured precursor metabolite, 25 (OH) D 3, is linked to an increased risk of multiple inflammatory diseases, including: cardiovascular disease, arthritis, multiple sclerosis, and sepsis. Common to all of these diseases is the disruption of endothelial stability and an enhancement of vascular leak. We previously performed an unbiased <b>chemical</b> <b>suppressor</b> screen on a genetic model of vascular instability, and identified cholecalciferol (D 3, dietary Vitamin D 3) as a factor that had profound and immediate stabilizing and therapeutic effects in that model. In this manuscript we show that the presumed inactive sterol, D 3, is actually a potent and general mediator of endothelial stability at physiologically relevant concentrations. We further demonstrate that this phenomenon is apparent in vitamin D 3 metabolites 25 (OH) D 3 and 1, 25 (OH) 2 D 3, and that the effects are independent of the canonical transcription-mediated vitamin D pathway. Our data suggests the presence of an alternative signaling modality by which D 3 acts directly on endothelial cells to prevent vascular leak. The finding that D 3 and its metabolites modulate endothelial stability may help explain the clinical correlations between low serum vitamin D levels and the many human diseases with well-described vascular dysfunction phenotypes...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Vascular {{branching}} morphogenesis {{is responsible}} for the extension of blood vessels into growing tissues, a process crucial for organogenesis. However, the genetic mechanism for vessel branching is largely unknown. Zebrafish reg 6 is a temperature-sensitive mutation exhibiting defects in blood vessel branching which results in the formation of swollen vessel lumina during capillary plexus formation. Results We performed a screening for <b>chemical</b> <b>suppressors</b> of reg 6 and identified SKF 91488, an inhibitor of histamine methyltransferase (HMT), that can rescue the reg 6 vessel branching defects in a dose-dependent manner. Inhibition of HMT by SKF 91488 presumably blocks histamine degradation, thus causing histamine accumulation. Consistent with this idea, we found that a high level of histamine also showed significant suppression of reg 6 vessel phenotypes. Interestingly, when reg 6 adults that had already developed swollen vessel lumina in regenerating fins were treated with histamine or SKF 91488, either treatment significantly reduced the number of swollen vessels within 12 h, suggesting a rapid and constant influence of histamine on blood vessel branching. Furthermore, the expression of HMT was significantly elevated in reg 6 regenerating fins. Conversely, lowering histamine by administering urocanic acid, a histidine decarboxylase inhibitor, enhanced the reg 6 phenotypes. Finally, we identified that the transcription factor, egr- 1 (early growth response factor 1), was closely associated with the reg 6 phenotype and chemical treatments. Conclusion Taken together, our results suggest that blood vessel branching is influenced by histamine metabolism, possibly through regulating the expression of the egr- 1 transcription factor. </p...|$|R
40|$|Severe acute {{respiratory}} coronavirus (SARS-CoV) {{emerged in}} 2002, resulting in roughly 8000 cases worldwide and 10 % mortality. The animal reservoirs for SARS-CoV precursors still exist {{and the likelihood}} of future outbreaks in the human population is high. The SARS-CoV papain-like protease (PLP) is an attractive target for pharmaceutical development because it is essential for virus replication and is conserved among human coronaviruses. A yeast-based assay was established for PLP activity that relies on the ability of PLP to induce a pronounced slow-growth phenotype when expressed in S. cerevisiae. Induction of the slow-growth phenotype was shown to take place over a 60 -hour time course, providing the basis for conducting a screen for small molecules that restore growth by inhibiting the function of PLP. Five <b>chemical</b> <b>suppressors</b> of the slow-growth phenotype were identified from the 2000 member NIH Diversity Set library. One of these, NSC 158362, potently inhibited SARS-CoV replication in cell culture without toxic effects on cells, and it specifically inhibited SARS-CoV replication but not influenza virus replication. The effect of NSC 158362 on PLP protease, deubiquitinase and anti-interferon activities was investigated but the compound did not alter these activities. Another suppressor, NSC 158011, demonstrated the ability to inhibit PLP protease activity in a cell-based assay. The identification of these inhibitors demonstrated a strong functional connection between the PLP-based yeast assay, the inhibitory compounds, and SARS-CoV biology. Furthermore the data with NSC 158362 suggest a novel mechanism for inhibition of SARS-CoV replication that may involve an unknow...|$|R
40|$|AbstractHistone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors {{are being}} {{developed}} as new clinical agents in cancer therapy, {{in part because they}} interrupt cell cycle progression in transformed cell lines. To examine cell cycle arrest induced by HDAC inhibitor trichostatin A (TSA), a cytoblot cell-based screen was used to identify small molecule suppressors of this process. TSA suppressors (ITSAs) counteract TSA-induced cell cycle arrest, histone acetylation, and transcriptional activation. Hydroxamic acid-based HDAC inhibitors like TSA and suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA) promote acetylation of cytoplasmic α-tubulin as well as histones, a modification also suppressed by ITSAs. Although tubulin acetylation appears irrelevant to cell cycle progression and transcription, it {{may play a role in}} other cellular processes. Small molecule suppressors such as the ITSAs, available from <b>chemical</b> genetic <b>suppressor</b> screens, may prove to be valuable probes of many biological processes...|$|R

40|$|This work {{presents}} {{an investigation into}} the challenges involving the utilisation of ion chromatography (IC) for the identification of impurities in pharmaceutical compounds, which is an essential task in the pharmaceutical industry. In IC, the use of a suppressor results in insensitive conductivity responses when applied to weak acids. In an attempt to circumvent this problem, signal enhancement through a post-suppressor reaction was performed by introducing a low concentration of a basic reagent, via a tee-connector, into the suppressor effluent. This approach exhibited enhancements of up to 500 -fold for weak acids with pKa > 4. 7. However, signal enhancement was limited to high concentrations and sample volumes (at least 10 nmol on column), and did not greatly improve the limits of detection due to 50 - 100 times increase in baseline noise after reagent mixing. pH detection was also assessed, either after suppression or after base introduction, yet it hardly exhibited any signal enhancement of weak acids and at best resulted in limits of detection 4 -times lower than suppressed conductivity. Universal detection methods suitable for coupling to IC were then investigated. However, the non-volatile ionic eluents commonly used in IC pose an obstacle in coupling to mass spectrometry (MS) and aerosol-based detectors, as the high ionic content can cause severe interferences in these detectors. A detailed study of the use of commercially-available <b>chemical</b> or electrolytic <b>suppressors</b> for desalting eluents comprising isocratic or gradient steps and containing organic solvents was undertaken. First, <b>chemical</b> and electrolytic <b>suppressors</b> were evaluated for baseline drift, noise and efficiency of suppression using aqueous/organic eluents containing up to 40...|$|R
40|$|The {{synthesis}} of proteins bearing unnatural amino acids {{has the potential}} to enhance and elucidate many processes in biochemistry and molecular biology. There are two primary methods for site specific unnatural amino acid incorporation, both of which use the cell’s native protein translating machinery: in vitro <b>chemical</b> acylation of <b>suppressor</b> tRNAs and the use of orthogonal amino acyl tRNA synthetases. Total chemical synthesis is theoretically possible, but current methods severely limit the maximum size of the product protein. In vivo orthogonal synthetase methods suffer from the high cost of the unnatural amino acid. In this thesis I sought to address this limitation by increasing cell density, first in shake flasks and then in a bioreactor in order to increase the yield of protein per amount of unnatural amino acid used. In a parallel project, I used the in vitro chemical acylation system to incorporate several unnatural amino acids, key among them the fluorophore BODIPYFL, with the aim of producing site specifically fluorescently labeled protein for single molecule FRET studies. I demonstrated successful incorporation of these amino acids into the trial protein GFP, although incorporation was not demonstrated in the final target, FEN 1. This also served to confirm the effectiveness of a new procedure developed for chemical acylation...|$|R
