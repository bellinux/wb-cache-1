Appropriate cultures were obtained before initiating broad spectrum antimicrobial therapy and supportive measures were performed following Surviving Sepsis <b>Campaign</b> guidelines. <b>Modification</b> of the antimicrobial regimen after culture results was left at the decision of physician {{in charge of the}} patient. The following variables were recorded: demographic characteristics, underlying diseases, severity of illness at admission (APACHE II and SOFA scores), adequacy of empirical antimicrobial therapy, SOFA score at the day of culture results, worst SOFA score in the ICU, development of nosocomial infection, leght of stay and mortality. We also analyzed clinical characteristics, sepsis source, presence of bacteremia and type of pathogen. We used Student´s T test, Mann-Whitney U test or Chi square (as appropriate) to compare the variables. A multivariate analysis was also performed to control for confounding variables in order to asses the factors associated with no de-escalation.|$|R

40|$|We {{discuss the}} design, operation, and {{performance}} of a vacuum setup constructed for use in zero (or reduced) gravity conditions to initiate collisions of fragile millimeter-sized particles at low velocity and temperature. Such particles are typically found in many astronomical settings and in regions of planet formation. The instrument has participated in four parabolic flight campaigns to date, operating {{for a total of}} 2. 4 h in reduced-gravity conditions and successfully recording over 300 separate collisions of loosely packed dust aggregates and ice samples. The imparted particle velocities achieved range from 0. 03 to 0. 28 m s - 1 and a high-speed, high-resolution camera captures the events at 107 frames/s from two viewing angles separated by either 48. 8 ° or 60. 0 °. The particles can be stored inside the experiment vacuum chamber at temperatures of 80 – 300 K for several uninterrupted hours using a built-in thermal accumulation system. The copper structure allows cooling down to cryogenic temperatures before commencement of the experiments.

Đukanović's cabinet actively {{participated in the}} Siege of Dubrovnik from the autumn of 1991 until spring 1992, {{which resulted in the}} city suffering heavy structural damage. The surrounding area of Konavli also suffered due to looting raids. During this period Đukanović {{was one of the most}} vociferous hawks in the Montenegrin government. Some of his notable statements from this period include a proclamation about [...] "starting to hate chess because of the šahovnica (the chequerboard Croatian coat-of-arms)" [...] and an aggressive declaration delivered in a public speech during the assault on Dubrovnik that [...] "We have already thinned the AVNOJ borders of Montenegro and Herzegovina, that is eastern Bosnia and Montenegro.

40|$|Abstract. Stimulated {{electromagnetic}} emission (SEE) {{may occur}} when the nearEarth space plasma of the ionosphere is subjected to a powerful high frequency (HF, 330 MHz) electromagnetic wave tuned to match a natural E or Fregion plasma frequency. The emission is usually attributed to nonlinear interactions between HFpumpinduced ionospheric magnetoionic wave modes, and is observed in the radio spectrum as sideband peaks around the HF pump frequency. Several SEE features, among them the downshifted peak (DP), reveal a strong dependence on the offset between the pump frequency and local gyrofrequency harmonics, demonstrating the key role of the geomagnetic field in the physics of SEE. In the observations reported here, a number of extremely narrowband SEE spectral components, {{of the order of}} 1 or 2 Hz in width, were detected near the expected frequency of the DP during an HF <b>modification</b> <b>campaign</b> held at the EISCAT observatory near Tromsø, Norway in the autumn of 2004. The extreme narrowness of the lines suggests that they cannot be due to the same wavewave interactions suggested for other SEE features. The apparently geophysical variation in the frequencies of the lines, however, suggests that they are due to ionospheric interaction processes. As has been observed for the DP in the F region, the angle of arrival of these E region emissions remains nearly constant during a change in pump beam angle, suggesting, as for the DP, a role for the magnetic field in explaining the origin of these waves. The ability to compute direction angle and spectra at very high frequency and time resolution are particularly interesting features of the observational technique used for these measurements. ...|$|R

The blinding sequelae, which occur in middle age, are felt {{to be the result}} of numerous or lengthy episodes of severe inflammatory trachoma in childhood. Risk factors for constant, severe trachoma were identified in a group of children enrolled in a longitudinal study in Kongwa, Tanzania, where villages were randomized in a clinical trial of mass treatment and a behavior <b>modification</b> <b>campaign.</b> In 1989, each of 1, 417 randomly selected children had photographs taken of an upper eyelid for determination of their trachoma status. The photographs were graded by a reader who was masked as to the village and date of each photograph. Risk factor data on the family's socioeconomic status, distance to water, and hygiene practices were obtained at baseline. Follow-up examinations occurred 2, 6, and 12 months from baseline. Data from all four time points were available for 82 % of the children enrolled. Overall, 10 % of the children had constant, severe trachoma, defined as severe trachoma at three or four examinations. The odds ratio for severe trachoma was 1. 9 for female children (95 % confidence interval 1. 3 - 2. 7). Familial cattle ownership and having one or more siblings with trachoma at baseline were also significantly related to the odds of having severe trachoma. Children with a sustainably clean face had lower odds (odds ratio = 0. 4, 95 % confidence interval 0. 3 - 0. 7).

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to explore the {{perceptions}} of RDP beneficiaries on the extent to which the RDP housing project meets their housing needs in South Africa through a case study of Golf Course Estate in Alice Town with the following specific objectives; to assess the extent to which the Alice Golf Course housing project has achieved the RDP programme objectives; to establish beneficiaries‟ perceptions on the extent the RDP Alice Golf Course houses meet their needs; and to explore the level of satisfaction on the RDP houses by beneficiaries. This study utilized triangulation of both quantitative and qualitative methodologies with qualitative as the dominant approach while quantitative was less dominant. The qualitative design took the form of a case study while the quantitative took the form of mini survey. The study sampled 72 participants from the study population. The study utilized an interview guide and a questionnaire as instruments of data collection. The findings indicated that the gender representation of the beneficiaries was skewed. This is because there were more females heading the houses than males; unemployment was also high; most participants were unmarried and most were adults. This study also discovered that most people residing in these houses are not the real owners who were allocated the houses. There were qualitative problems associated with the components of these houses such as poor roofing, doors, windows, floors and walls. Service delivery complaints were based on inadequate access to clean water, small size and spacing of the RDP house. Security was also a challenge because all the houses did not have street lights and the roads were very bad. Though it is commendable that drainage and sewer facilities are available, but they are not serving their purpose since there is no water in these houses. The findings also indicated that there were discrepancies in allocation of the houses; pervasiveness of social ills; inadequate consultative meetings between the RDP Administrator or social worker and the beneficiaries; as well as the pervasiveness of HIV/AIDS among other issues. This researcher recommended that the government needs to promote economic empowerment to deal with unemployment; to improve the quality of the material building the houses; improvement on service delivery gaps; to beef up infrastructure; renovation and revamping of current houses; to establish commissions of inquiry to deal with corruption; to honour and monitor waiting lists. Partnership with other stakeholders was also critical, in addressing access to social services and helps deal with social ills and run behaviour <b>modification</b> <b>campaigns.</b> This researcher also recommended that there is a need to carry out further research on the role played by the municipalities in the RDP housing project as well as conducting a purely qualitative research to further explore the perceptions of other stakeholders, NGOs, traditional leaders, church leaders, and police on the implementation of the housing project. This researcher advises that such a research could be carried out through focus group discussions and also since this study was bound by a case study it is also necessary for similar research to be carried out in different places in South Africa...|$|R
40|$|Australia 2 ̆ 7 s water {{resources}} {{over the next}} few decades, and most likely beyond, will be under increasing pressures as populations enlarge and as the amount of water per person becomes more limited from a decline in rainfall across much of the continent. Perth is considered lucky among most Australian cities when it comes to {{water resources}}, in that we have an extensive groundwater network that is readily accessible both for both private (wells and bores) and public (scheme water) supplies. However, this resource has also seen substantial declines over the last few decades resulting from declining rainfall and increased use. Although domestic users individually may have minimal impact on the groundwater, their cumulative impact may be far greater. At some stage we will need to understand the variety and complexities among this user group {{if we are going to}} manage water effectively, without having to raise the price beyond what an average family can afford -it is water after all, it can not be denied from those simply too poor. Understanding and trust needs to be built among a community of users if they are going to work together with resource managers through an understanding of the nature of the resource the need for restrictions and regulations. However, before we can develop such understandings we first need to develop an awareness of the perceptions that exist within this group, followed by understanding as to how it may influence their behaviour. To obtain a sample of such perceptions to groundwater resources, a qualitative study was designed to gain an insight into the broad range of perceptions that might exist within this community. An in-depth interview was developed and undertaken among a small community of users. The data obtained were analysed and coded according to a set of themes and issues that were present throughout the interviews. From here some discussions were presented about the potential meaning of such data and the implications it may have for management or behaviour <b>modification</b> <b>campaigns</b> (i. e. promoting water conservation behaviours etc.). A variety of commonly held perceptions existed for a number of themes. The majority of participants were aware of a decline in Perth 2 ̆ 7 s groundwater resources, with most attributing this to either overuse, particularly by irrigators, and or to a decline in rainfall. On the topic of property rights in water, most did not believe that individuals had ownership rights over groundwater, but rather it was a commonly owned resource, with many suggesting that government had the ultimate control in ensuring the resource is allocated equitably and sustainably. On the topic of recommendations for policy makers, many had suggested the ways in which we need to start obtaining new water sources, as opposed to the better management of our existing water supplies. However, many also suggested the education of groundwater users on such things as restrictions and why they have been put in place. Some of the main findings of most concern to resource managers are those relating to equity in regards to fees being applied to groundwater use, potential misconceptions, the expressed need for better education of groundwater users, the nature in which people appear more in favour of deflecting the issue than changing management and use and the lack of awareness as to who manages the groundwater and what their role is...|$|R
