In the control strategy, the paper deduces the switching surface and switching control law of SMVSC, and calculates the sliding existence domain based on the mathematical model of <b>current</b> source <b>converter.</b> Finally, the simulation results show that the control scheme can make <b>current</b> source <b>converter</b> have better output current waveform, fast tracking the reference current, and strong anti-interference ability.

The sea cable is planned as a bipolar system with earthing through the return cable. This way, the disadvantages of a ground-return electrode with earthing in the sea, such as production of chlorine compounds and metal corrosion, are avoided. Anticipated life span of the cable would be about 40 years.

A decentralised rail traction <b>current</b> <b>converter</b> plant built on the railway bridge on the line towards Frankena supplied electricity to sections of both lines. It was closed after 27 years of operation in July 2008 and replaced by a modern substation.

40|$|This chapter {{gives an}} {{overview}} on some interesting DC–DC (direct <b>current)</b> power <b>converter</b> topologies that are seldom {{discussed in the}} literature. It also provides, from a circuit-theory viewpoint, a discussion on the derivation of such converters and their relationships with fundamental converters. A family of <b>current</b> <b>converters</b> and their modified versions, which are derivable from fundamental voltage converters using the principle of circuit duality, are discussed. These <b>current</b> <b>converters,</b> which could also be formulated using {{the framework of a}} switching-capacitor cell, may be useful for applications where the energy source and load behave like current sources and sinks. A discussion on how fourth-order Ćuk, SEPIC (single ended primary inductor converter), and zeta converters can be derived using a two-inductor–two-switch circuit cutset approach is provided. It is shown that there is a missing circuit from this family of fourth-order converters under this cutset. The details of this circuit will be provided. An alternative, but more systematic approach of cascading two fundamental converters to result in a fourth-order converter is discussed. With this approach, nine possible types of cascaded fourth-order converters can be obtained. Out of these nine types of cascaded converters, there are seven types which are possibly quadratic converters, if properly configured. Single-switched quadratic converters are useful for applications that require a wide conversion range, e. g. in ultra-low-voltage devices. Finally, fourth-order converters which can be obtained from fundamental converters through the addition of second-order inductive-capacitive filters are described.

40|$|Practical {{switching}} devices have finite turn-on and turn-off times. Normally a blanking time is added between the turn-off and turn-on of switches {{to avoid a}} short circuit during switching.

Topologies based on only one active device in series with a freewheeling diode, like the opposed <b>current</b> <b>converter,</b> do not need blanking time, and the output voltage distortion is greatly improved but not absent.
