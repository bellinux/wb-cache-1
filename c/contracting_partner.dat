In the sector of rail infrastructure output-contracts, in which the contractor is judged on achieved performances, are getting more in use. The assumption is that this {{will lead to a}} more efficient and innovative execution of the maintenance, because the parties involved in the contract have less contact and thus need to take more responsibilities for their proper tasks. Unknown however is how to manage such a contract: What are the risks a <b>contracting</b> <b>partner</b> is confronted with during the term of the contract and how could these risks be managed? This article will discuss a method that will provide answers to these questions. The method consists of a matrix of the possible risks and control measures that the management level of both the sourcing partner and the contractor should discuss. These are cooperation risks and not the safety and availability risks. Within HTM, the bus and tram company of The Hague, this method is used to give direction for a new maintenance contract. It was concluded that management based on performances not always means that <b>contracting</b> <b>partner</b> and contractor have less contact but that it resulted in another behavior and cooperation both for the <b>contracting</b> <b>partner</b> as the contracting party.

40|$|Purpose – This paper {{seeks to}} report the {{findings}} of a research project that observed and monitored the performance of a four-year strategic partnering agreement between a consortium of Registered Social Landlords (AMPHION) and their <b>contracting</b> <b>partner</b> as they procured approximately 800 new houses, across 33 separate development projects. Design/methodology/approach – The research project used a combination of in-depth case studies (of individual housing projects and the relationship between the client group and their main contractor) supplemented by quantitative measures of project performance (Key Performance Indicators) and integrated workshops to study the operational factors that affected the success of the partnering initiative. Findings – The paper concludes that failures to manage expectations within and between partners undermined confidence and trust in the partnering process. Research limitations/implications – Whilst strategic partnering within the UK social housing sector was immature {{at the time of the}} study, the lessons learned have implications for other organisations considering strategic partnering relationships.

A potential buyer and seller want to trade a widget and prior to trade the seller can make an investment to create an improved version of the widget. We assume that buyer and seller cannot be sure that this improved widget can be described accurately. To be more precise we assume that with a certain probability the seller can exploit loopholes in the contract and make an e¤ort to create a new widget which also satis…es the requirements of the contract. The creating of this widget is ine ¢ cient, but since it cannot be distinguished from the improved widget by a third party, it allows the seller to haggle for a larger share of the surplus. We show that whenever a contract provides incentives to foster investments to improve the widget, this contract also fosters investments to create a haggling widget.

40|$|Prior {{research}} {{over several}} decades has catalogued many factors underlying firm‟s equity participation in joint ventures. This analysis empirically investigates whether agency {{problems associated with}} monitoring specialized activities influence the negotiated distribution of equity between collaborating partners at the inception of an equity joint venture (EJV). The proposed framework modifies a financial contracting perspective based upon agency theory and draws on existing theories of EJVs; namely, transaction cost economics, bargaining power and resource-based theory. The central contention is that a primary determinant {{of the division of}} equity capital is the requirement for each <b>contracting</b> <b>partner</b> to guarantee its subsequent value-enhancing productive activities that jointly determine the future success of the EJV. Specifically, it is argued that the inherent characteristics of the expertise and/or nature of the strategic assets that a firm contributes to an inter-firm EJV may make it difficult for that firm to guarantee (ex ante) its productive contribution during the negotiation stage. Results from a sample of 194 UK-based EJVs support the view that owners of strategic assets whose potential contribution {{to the success of the}} EJV are the most difficult to measure ex ante will negotiate a higher share of equity capital, thereby, partially, guaranteeing their actions. ...|$|E
40|$|In {{automated}} negotiation systems {{consisting of}} self-interested agents, contracts {{have traditionally been}} binding, i. e., impossible to breach. Such contracts do not allow the agents to e ciently deal with future events. This de ciency can be tackled by using a leveled commitment contracting protocol which allows the agents to decommit from contracts by paying a monetary penalty to the <b>contracting</b> <b>partner.</b> The e ciency of such protocols depends heavily on how the penalties are decided. In this paper, dif-ferent leveled commitment protocols and their parameterizations are experimentally compared in sequences of multiple contracts. In the di erent experiments, the agents are of di erent types: self-interested or social welfare maximizing, and they can carry out game-theoretic lookahead or be myopic. Several meeting technologies, ways of set-ting the contract price, and ways of setting and increasing the penalties are compared. Surprisingly, self-interested myopic agents reach a higher social welfare quicker than cooperative myopic agents when decommitment penalties are low. The social welfare in settings with agents that perform lookahead does not vary as much with the de-commitment penalty as the social welfare in settings that consist of myopic agents. In all of the settings, {{the best way to}} set the decommitment penalties is to choose low penalties, but ones that are greater than zero. This indicates that leveled commitment contracting protocols outperform both full commitment protocols and commitment free protocols. ...|$|E

40|$|Innovation {{has been}} {{acknowledged}} by both researchers and practitioners {{as a vital}} tool to yield growth and maintain competitive advantages. However, firms face stiff challenges in managing innovations. Developing new product generally requires substantial resource input, but the success rate is usually low due to internal technical difficulties and external market uncertainties. Even with successful innovative products, it is not guaranteed that the innovators will be rewarded for their efforts and investments, as the return from innovations may be siphoned off by suppliers, customers, and competitors. To profit from innovations, firms need to first create value with the right R&D strategies, and further capture value in the execution of innovations when dealing with the relevant partners. This dissertation studies the management of innovations and addresses these two important issues respectively. In the first essay, we investigate how strategically managing information can improve the new product performances in competitive R&D markets. The new product development process is essentially a series of inter-linked information processing activities: firms generate ideas, gather information from external environment to evaluate the feasibility and potential of the ideas, conduct research to create new knowledge and intellectual property, and finally commercialize the new knowledge into the market to generate value. We focus on how firms should acquire and manage external market information in competitive R&D markets, and how the information acquisition and management strategies impact their R&D investment decisions. The second essay studies how firms should manage {{the relationship with the}} relevant parties in the execution of innovations. The intrinsic uncertainty in the materialization of innovations, the intangibility of technical knowledge assets, and the difficulty of specifying and monitoring the performance of the other party, are the primary clauses that give rise to the hold-up problem in innovation partnerships [...] that is, the R&D investment by a firm leaves it vulnerable to ex post opportunistic behaviors by its <b>contracting</b> <b>partner</b> (whether its supplier, customer, or joint venture partner). We study how the operational aspect of an evolving relationship may influence a firm's innate incentives to take advantage and `hold-up' the partner and mitigate the hold-up problem in innovation partnerships. The third essay extends the discussion of hold-up problem to general incomplete contracts and moral Darwinism. In conventional economic models, rational players are usually assumed to be self-interested and can take opportunistic actions to maximize their own payoffs, while socially desirable traits such as honesty and trust are often characterized as irrational and studied as deviations from tenets of rationality. However, these irrational traits are commonly observed in practice despite the widespread nature of incomplete contracts which have plenty of room for opportunism. This essay asks why traits such as honesty have not been weeded out by economic Darwinism, and offers a justification that the choice of honesty emerges both as desirable and rational under very reasonable conditions...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{offers an}} {{alternative}} to conventional accounting in the conceptualisation of the economic entity. Framed by the principles of philosophical hermeneutics, {{the writings of the}} German Lutheran theologian Dietrich Bonhoeffer (1906 – 1945) are explored in order to provide an alternative conceptualisation of the economic entity. This thesis then examines the implications of this conceptualisation for accounting for labour, beyond the confines of conventional accounting. The most widely accepted conceptualisation of the economic entity in business disciplines, including conventional accounting, is the nexus-of-contract perspective. The nexus-of-contract perspective conceptualises the entity as an atomised, ahistorical and artificial fiction that serves as a nexus for contracting relationships among various parties. Because it is merely a nexus, the entity cannot be construed as an actor with ethical responsibility. The normative behaviour of the nexus-of-contract entity is profit and shareholder wealth maximisation. Despite the dominance of this approach, this perspective is limited in addressing the ethical controversies that economic entities currently face. As an alternative, the conceptualisation of the entity as “responsible collective person” – based on Bonhoeffer‟s concept of mandates and his concept of the collective person – is provided to address the limitations of the nexus-of-contract approach. The “responsible collective person” has two features. The first feature is the positioning of the entity amidst various spheres of life, called “mandates”. The “mandates” exist in relations of “being-with”, “being-for” and “being-against” each other. The second feature is the delineation of the boundary of the entity through the notion of influence. The ethical imperative of the “responsible collective person” is based on Bonhoeffer‟s ethic of responsible action. Any conceptualisation of the entity has implications for how various stakeholders are perceived and accounted for by the entity. In regards to labour as a major stakeholder, the nexus-of-contract approach views labour as an equal, <b>contracting</b> <b>partner</b> that has a “fixed claim” from the entity in the form of agreed-upon remuneration. Following this perspective, conventional accounting characterises labour as a cost to the entity, with the assumption that remuneration to labour is adequate compensation for their services. While there have been attempts at recognising labour as assets, the strong adherence towards the principles of conventional accounting have thwarted these efforts. There are several ethical limitations to these approaches. Firstly, the categorisation of labour as cost leads to the commodification of human beings in the pursuit of profits. Secondly, the adherence towards the “hard” and calculative nature of conventional accounting means that the goal of accounting for the worth of labour cannot come to fruition. Thirdly, conventional accounting for labour is mostly {{from the perspective of the}} entity, silencing labour‟s own voices. In contrast, the “responsible collective person” approach argues that “the labourer” cannot be separated from “the human”, and that any debate on labour necessarily entails a debate on humanity. To this end, it is proposed that accounting, via its communicative function, can act as a discourse that provides the “responsible collective person” with a wide array of information – information that will be helpful in enabling the entity to become an ethical and responsible agent. In regards to accounting for labour, it is argued that labour should not be negatively ascribed as an expense, but as a significant and important contributor to the entity. Space should be given for multiple forms of accounting from multiple perspectives, ranging from the “hard” financial representations to the “soft” narrative and visual approaches. Three approaches to accounting for labour are explored: the Statement of Redistribution of Income; Self-Accountings from Labour; and Accounting for Labour from Others...|$|E

Joint venturing can allow participating companies to rapidly change the scale or scope of their businesses. However, joint ventures are often regarded as a risky business. The construction industry is associated with high degrees of risk in the nature of its business activities, operational environment and organization. The success of a construction project depends on the results it is supposed to achieve. But achieving results depends upon how well companies manage the risks that confront their projects. This paper aims to identify the risk factors associated with joint venture projects in the Malaysian construction industry at the project-specific, internal and external levels. The main factors crucial to joint venture success were identified from a literature review and through a questionnaire survey administered to both local and foreign construction organisations in Malaysia. The major risks factors were found to be the agreement of the <b>contract,</b> <b>partner</b> selection, control/equity, sub-contractors, renegotiations and training.
