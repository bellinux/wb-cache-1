5|$|Ryder <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>no</b> ships {{other than}} {{seven or eight}} burning MLs. He then {{realised}} that the landing places at the Old Mole and {{the entrance to the}} basin had both been recaptured by the Germans. There was nothing more they could do for the Commandos, so they headed out to sea. On their way they were continuously illuminated by German searchlights and were hit at least six times by the German guns. Passing ML 270, they ordered her to follow and made smoke to hide both boats.|$|E
5|$|Two {{attempts}} were made to travel back to Shipwreck Camp to pick up extra food, but both failed, the second resulting in further losses of dogs and equipment. Chafe, whose feet had become gangrenous after severe frostbite, had his toes removed by second engineer Williamson, with improvised tools. McKinlay and Munro risked their lives by travelling over the sea ice towards Herald Island, in a final effort to locate either of the missing parties. They could get no nearer than , and from an examination of the distant island through binoculars <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>no</b> indications of life.|$|E
5|$|By the 1960s, {{only the}} Saint Thomas Creek, the City Mills River and the Channelsea River {{were still being}} used for {{commercial}} traffic. A section of the Channelsea River between Stratford High Street and Lett Road was culverted between 1957 and 1958. As traffic ceased, the lock structures deteriorated, and by 2006, City Mills Lock and Carpenters Road Lock were officially disused. The 1968 British Waterways Act had classified most waterways into commercial, cruising and remainder waterways. Remainder waterways were those for which {{the government of the}} time <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>no</b> economic future, and which would only therefore be subject to maintenance to prevent them becoming unsafe. The Bow Back Rivers fell into this category, and remained neglected until their full restoration was enshrined in a British Waterways policy document in 2002.|$|E

5|$|Page and MacLachlan flew to No. 96 Squadron RAF {{which was}} then flying de Havilland Mosquito night fighters. He {{requested}} his old gunner, Les Davies, who now piloted Mosquitos to join them. Davies accepted but MacLachlan was killed before he could take up the offer. MacLachlan and Page flew to Tangmere on 15 July. On his next mission on 18 July 1943 MacLachlan's Mustang FD442 was probably hit by ground fire when crossing the French coast near Dieppe. Page noticed MacLachlan's Mustang suddenly pull up sharply from their tree-top height by about 1,000 feet. He saw MacLachlan pull back the canopy but apparently {{changed his mind about}} bailing out as the aircraft leveled out and descended. The Mustang then headed towards a small field. MacLachaln touched down three-quarters the way across and the Mustang ploughed into an orchard at the field's edge which ripped off the wings. Page orbited the crash site several times and considered landing to rescue him but the space was too confined. Page dived at the wreck and took gun-camera footage but <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>no</b> signs of life and then headed home. The Operations Record was unable to determine the cause of the crash. MacLachlan made no radio broadcast. It was possibly the result of enemy small-arms fire or mechanical failure. On 30 July MacLachlan was awarded a second Bar to his DFC.|$|E

25|$|As the {{transport}} was being abandoned Trout proceeded close aboard and passed 12 to 15 life boats. The enemy ship was ablaze {{and low in}} the water with her bow nearly awash.

That night, the submarine set a course for Hawaii and arrived at Pearl Harbor on 4 October 1943.|$|E
25|$|In July 1897, {{both the}} West Lancashire and the Liverpool, Southport and Preston Junction Railways were {{absorbed into the}} Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway (L). The L had a large {{terminus}} at Southport Chapel Street and <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>no</b> sense in operating two termini at very close proximity. In 1901, the L completed a remodelling of the approach lines to Central to allow trains to divert onto the Manchester to Southport line and into Southport Chapel Street Station. Southport Central was closed to passengers {{and it became a}} goods depot eventually amalgamating with Chapel Street depot. It survived intact well into the 1970s.|$|E

25|$|Underway {{again on}} 6 December, Balao {{spent two days}} in {{training}} exercises and practice approaches with Coucal as her target. On 13 December, the submarine conducted communication and identification tests with friendly search planes and then began her patrol.

The four warships maneuvered in a radical zigzag plan at a speed of , passing the submarine so rapidly that she only managed a shot at the second cruiser. Balao fired four torpedoes which overran their target. While rigging for depth charges, she heard three explosions, but upon surfacing, <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>no</b> sign of damage.

25|$|By {{this time}} Johnson had {{lost control of}} the Democratic Party, which was {{splitting}} into four factions, each of which generally disliked the other three. The first consisted of Johnson (and Humphrey), labor unions, and local party bosses (led by Chicago Mayor Richard J. Daley). The second group consisted of students and intellectuals who were vociferously against the war and rallied behind McCarthy. The third group were Catholics, Hispanics and African Americans, who rallied behind Robert Kennedy. The fourth group were traditionally segregationist white Southerners, who rallied behind George C. Wallace and the American Independent Party. Vietnam was one of many issues that splintered the party, and Johnson <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>no</b> way to win the war and no way to unite the party long enough for him to win re-election.|$|E
25|$|In 1888, John Boyd Dunlop, a Scottish {{veterinary}} surgeon living in Ireland discovered the pneumatic tyre principle. Willie Hume created publicity for J B Dunlop's discovery by winning {{seven out of}} eight races with his pneumatic tyres. To own the rights and exploit the discovery, the Pneumatic Tyre and Booth's Cycle Agency Co. Ltd was incorporated in 1889 and floated by Harvey du Cros who was, amongst other things, president of the Irish Cyclists' Association. The invitation to du Cros to participate was made by William Bowden, a Dublin cycle agent. J B Dunlop who <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>no</b> prosperous future in his discovery, had informally made over his rights to Bowden. Initially J B Dunlop held a 20 {{percent stake in the}} venture. The company and manufactory was first founded in Stephens Street in Dublin.|$|E

25|$|Confusion between {{ship and}} shore {{led to the}} South Saskatchewans {{reducing}} their defensive perimeter too quickly, yielding the western heights to German infantry. The original order for evacuation was for 10:00 but was changed to 11:00. The change proved disastrous for the assault troops, as the Queen's Own Cameron Highlanders of Canada had already started to withdraw to the beach at 09:30, closely followed by the Saskatchewans. They would {{have to contend with}} the increasing enemy action for another hour, despite the perimeter now being too close to the beach. At about 10:30, all available craft were sent to Green Beach at Dieppe, which was still under intense fire from mortars and machine-guns. At 10:45, six LCAs came inshore to Green Beach under heavy fire. It was a mistake; the evacuation should have begun on Red Beach. As Alasdair Ferguson grounded his LCA, he <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>no</b> movement on the beach. Moments later, so many troops were rushing Ferguson's craft that it was swamped and, as he made out to sea, the craft was hit by a shell and capsized. He helped the survivors board another craft, and the traumatized sailors and soldiers returned to Newhaven. The other five LCAs participated in a chaotic evacuation, taking men aboard and clearing the beach successfully, but casualties mounted. A second flight of LCAs appeared soon after, but the state of the tide was changing markedly and the risk of becoming stranded kept the LCAs well off shore. The loss of the western heights and the receding tide made further attempts to evacuate most costly. Heavy losses occurred on the sand and in the water. By 11:30, the few men left on the beach were overwhelmed by an enemy attack and captured while attempting to disengage.|$|E
500|$|Fundamental in {{this view}} of {{conscience}} is that humans consider some [...] "other" [...] as being in a social relationship. Thus, nationalism is invoked in conscience to quell tribal conflict {{and the notion of}} a Brotherhood of Man is invoked to quell national conflicts. Yet such crowd drives may not only overwhelm but redefine individual conscience. Friedrich Nietzsche stated: [...] "communal solidarity is annihilated by the highest and strongest drives that, when they break out passionately, whip the individual far past the average low level of the 'herd-conscience.' Jeremy Bentham noted that: [...] "fanaticism never sleeps... it is never stopped by conscience; for it has pressed conscience into its service." [...] Hannah Arendt in her study of the trial of Adolf Eichmann in Jerusalem, notes that the accused, as with almost all his fellow Germans, had lost track of his conscience {{to the point where they}} hardly remembered it; this wasn't caused by familiarity with atrocities or by psychologically redirecting any resultant natural pity to themselves for having to bear such an unpleasant duty, so much as by the fact that anyone whose conscience did develop doubts <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>no</b> one who shared them: [...] "Eichmann did not need to close his ears to the voice of conscience... not because he had none, but because his conscience spoke with a [...] "respectable voice", with the voice of the respectable society around him".|$|E
500|$|Rodgers and Hammerstein had disliked Landon's {{novel as}} a basis for a musical when it was published, and their views still held. [...] It {{consists}} of vignettes of life at the Siamese court, interspersed with descriptions of historical events unconnected with each other, except that the King creates most of the difficulties in the episodes, and Anna tries to resolve them. Rodgers and Hammerstein <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>no</b> coherent story from which a musical could be made until they saw the 1946 film adaptation, starring Irene Dunne and Rex Harrison, and how the screenplay united the episodes in the novel. [...] Rodgers and Hammerstein were also concerned about writing a star vehicle. [...] They had preferred to make stars rather than hire them, and engaging the legendary Gertrude Lawrence would be expensive. [...] Lawrence's voice was also a worry: her limited vocal range was diminishing with the years, while her tendency to sing flat was increasing. [...] Lawrence's temperament was another concern: though she could not sing like one, the star was known to be capable of diva-like behavior. [...] In spite of this, they admired her acting â€“ what Hammerstein called her [...] "magic light", [...] a compelling presence on stage â€“ and agreed to write the show. [...] For her part, Lawrence committed to remaining in the show until June 1, 1953, and waived the star's usual veto rights over cast and director, leaving control {{in the hands of the}} two authors.|$|E
