This paper looks at the legal implications of these restrictions and explores the current international regulatory framework applicable to international capital movements and current payments. It shows how international capital flows suffer {{from the lack of}} a comprehensive and coherent regulatory framework that would harmonize the patchwork of multilateral, regional, and bilateral treaties that currently regulate this issue. These treaties include the Articles of Agreement of the International Monetary Fund (IMF Articles), the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS), free-trade agreements, the European Union treaty, bilateral investment treaties, and the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) <b>Code</b> <b>of</b> <b>Liberalization</b> of Capital Movements (OECD Code of Capital Movement). Each of these instruments regulate differently capital movements with little coordination with other areas of law. This situation sometimes leads to regulatory overlaps and conflict between different sources of law. Given the strong links between capital movements and trade in services, this paper pays particular attention to the rules of the GATS on capital flows and discusses the policy space available in the GATS for restricting capital flows in times of crisis. international capital flows, capital controls, exchange restrictions, regulatory framework, international capital movement...|$|E

This time, however, Trudeau had taken over as Prime Minister from Lester B. Pearson and was confident in the new mandate given to him by the Canadian electorate. As a result, he appointed John Napier Turner as his new Justice Minister. Therefore, what Trudeau and the Liberals were proposing was the modernization of the country's family law.

40|$|<b>Liberalization</b> and {{privatization}} <b>of</b> {{the electricity}} industry {{is one of}} the most important processes in the few last years. Even when the electricity market is fully open, substantial barriers to competition often remain. These barriers are refusal of access to the market, the lack of capacity in interconnectors and long-term contracts. The process <b>of</b> <b>liberalization</b> has shown that a third-party access to the network is a critical and important factor in ensuring a real and effective <b>liberalization</b> <b>of</b> the market. The process <b>of</b> <b>liberalization</b> has also supported new ways and forms of energy trading including financial contracts instead of purely physical contracts for the delivery of electricity. It is a question if the benefits <b>of</b> <b>liberalization</b> <b>of</b> the electricity industry compared with a regulated private monopoly or public monopoly were profitable.

40|$|This thesis {{sets out}} to explain the outcome <b>of</b> <b>liberalization</b> {{processes}} across the globe during the post war period, the research question being: When a regime liberalizes, what affects {{the risk of the}} process ending with either democratization or authoritarian reversal? Scholars of comparative politics have strived to explain the many regime changes throughout the post war period to the present, in particular, democratic transitions. As more and more hybrid regimes, neither fully democratic nor autocratic, has been recognized in the literature, the debate has acknowledged that the traditional transition paradigm must be modified as to disentangle the process <b>of</b> political <b>liberalization</b> from that <b>of</b> transitions. Rather, democratic transition is only one possible outcome <b>of</b> political <b>liberalization</b> - it might as well end with authoritarian reversal. However, despite this acknowledgement, the various outcomes <b>of</b> <b>liberalization</b> processes has not been systematically compared and explained on a global scale. Here lies the motivation of this thesis. A process-oriented approach traces historical events <b>of</b> political <b>liberalization</b> by observing movements upwards along the Polity IV scale. This generates 115 spells <b>of</b> <b>liberalization</b> in the analysis period from 1950 to 2006, by which a 105 is examined due to loss of data on the independent variables. Following the perspective of structural contingency, the outcome <b>of</b> <b>liberalization</b> - democratic transition or authoritarian reversal - is examined by an event history analysis, more specifically, Cox competing risk models. The analysis results imply that different endpoints <b>of</b> <b>liberalization</b> can be explained by economic growth performance, ethnic fractionalization of society, type of autocracy, presence of legislative assembly and the conflict level during liberalization periods, while the inclusion of opposition parties do not significantly affect the outcome...|$|R
