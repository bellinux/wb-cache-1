50|$|<b>Clocortolone</b> {{pivalate}} (brand names Cilder, Cloderm, Purantix), {{also known}} as <b>clocortolone</b> trimethylacetate, is a synthetic glucocorticoid corticosteroid and corticosteroid ester which is marketed in the United States and Austria. It is the C21 pivalate (trimethylacetate) ester of <b>clocortolone,</b> and acts as a prodrug of <b>clocortolone</b> in the body.|$|E
50|$|<b>Clocortolone</b> (Cloderm) is {{a topical}} steroid. It {{is used in}} the form of an ester, <b>clocortolone</b> pivalate, and applied as a cream. It is used for the {{treatment}} of dermatitis and is considered a medium-strength corticosteroid. It is unusual among steroids in that it contains a chlorine atom and a fluorine atom.|$|E
50|$|Vital to the {{pharmacological}} action of <b>clocortolone</b> {{is the presence}} and location of its functional groups. There were several molecular modifications done to create <b>clocortolone</b> pivalate, including beta-hydroxylation at C-11, methylation at C-16, double bonds at C-12, esterification at C-21, and halogenation at C-6 and C-9. It is common {{in the medical community}} to associate halogenation of topical corticosteroids with adverse effects. This notion is, in fact, incorrect—it is both the presence and location of halogenation in steroids that matter. In comparison to all other topical corticosteroids, the combination of the chlorine at C-9 and the fluorine at C-6 is unique to <b>clocortolone.</b> <b>Clocortolone</b> pivalate, due to its unique nature, has both upper-mid potency and the safety profile associated with a lower potency topical corticosteroid. This versatility allows for Cloderm cream to be a treatment option for a variety of patients.|$|E
50|$|In Phase III trials, Cloderm {{was found}} to be {{especially}} useful in treating eczema, atopic dermatitis, and psoriasis. Phase III trials also showed rapid action and relief {{for the majority of the}} patients involved. There is no age restriction on the use of <b>clocortolone</b> pivalate 0.1% cream. Clinical trials comparing <b>clocortolone</b> pivalate 0.1% topical cream with vehicle in atopic dermatitis/eczematous dermatitis, psoriasis, and contact dermatitis included pediatric patients (N=44). The mean age of pediatric subjects was 10 years (range 3-14 years). <b>Clocortolone</b> pivalate 0.1% cream was efficacious for the majority (75%) of the pediatric patients in these trials, with no serious adverse effects occurring in either group.|$|E
50|$|In August 2016 Cloderm Cream 0.1% <b>clocortolone</b> {{pivalate}} was {{priced at}} $3.64 per gram and $140.98 per 45 gm tube.|$|E
50|$|In six parallel, double-blind, {{placebo-controlled}} trials, {{patients with}} atopic dermatitis/eczematous dermatitis were randomized to treatment with <b>clocortolone</b> pivalate 0.1% topical cream (total n=109) or vehicle (total n=100), applied three times daily over a duration of 14 days. According to evaluations {{completed by the}} physician investigators, a significantly higher proportion of patients in the <b>clocortolone</b> pivalate group than patients in the vehicle group demonstrated a good or excellent response at Days 4, 7, and 14.|$|E
50|$|Cloderm, {{the brand}} {{formulation}} of <b>clocortolone</b> pivalate 0.1% cream, {{was approved by}} theFood and Drug Administration in 1977 {{for the treatment of}} corticoid responsive dermatoses.|$|E
50|$|<b>Clocortolone</b> is {{synthesized}} by {{the following}} process. 6α-Fluoro-16α-methyl-21-hydroxy-1,4,9(11)-pregnatriene-3,20-dione is suspended in nitroethane while being heated. 1 N perchloric acid is added to this suspension; afterwards, t-butyl hypochlorite is added dropwise. While being heated, this mixture is agitated, then cooled to room temperature, mixed with methanol, stirred, and then poured with water containing ice. This mixture is then stirred. Precipitated product is then filtered out and washed neutral with water. After being dried, this crude product is treated with hot methanol and then recrystallized from ethanol. 9α-chloro-6α-fluoro-11β,21-dihydroxy-16α-methyl-1,4-pregnadiene-3,20-dione, or <b>clocortolone,</b> {{is the product of}} this recrystallization.|$|E
50|$|The {{synthesis}} of <b>clocortolone</b> was invented and patented by Emanuel Kaspar and Rainer Philippson in 1973 with United States Patent 3,729,495. The original assignee of the patent was Schering AG, a research-centered German pharmaceutical company. The rights to <b>Clocortolone</b> were then sold to Germapharm, {{and then to}} Coria Laboratories, Ltd. of DFB Pharmaceuticals, Inc., a Fort Worth-based pharmaceutical company. Coria Laboratories, Ltd., the dermatology division of DFB Pharmaceuticals, Inc., was then sold to Valeant Pharmaceuticals in 2008. In 2011, Promius Pharma, LLC, an affiliate of Dr. Reddy's Laboratories, and Valeant Pharmaceuticals International, Inc. announced that they had signed a joint agreement for Cloderm. Per this collaborative agreement, Promius Pharma made an upfront payment will continue to pay royalties as the consideration {{for the right to}} manufacture, distribute and market Cloderm in the United States.|$|E
50|$|<b>Clocortolone</b> is an upper-mid potency topical {{corticosteroid}} formulation. It is rated at a class 4 potency {{on a scale}} of 1 (highest potency) to 7 (lowest potency). Most patients are treated with mid-potency {{topical corticosteroid}}s, for they are an effective medium between safety and efficacy for short and long-term conditions.|$|E
50|$|<b>Clocortolone</b> {{pivalate}} 0.1% is {{formulated in}} a cream that contains three ingredients which assist in stratum corneum permeability barrier integrity: white petrolatum (occlusive), mineral oil (humectant), and stearyl alcohol (long-chain fatty alcohol emollient). This cream {{does not contain}} lanolin, fragrance, nor propylene glycol, {{all of which have}} been known to be problematic for some patients.|$|E
50|$|Additionally, a {{clinical}} {{study investigated the}} potential of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis suppression. Ten men with no major health issues applied 30g of <b>clocortolone</b> pivalate 0.1% cream twice a day for 21 days while wearing a plastic sweat suit for twelve hours per day. Through the measurements of plasma cortisol and urinary 17-ketosteroid levels, the investigators monitored effects on the HPA axis, and no signs of adrenal suppression were evident.|$|E

40|$|Sanjay Singh,* Baldeep Kaur Mann*Department of Dermatology and Venereology, Institute of Medical Sciences, Banaras Hindu University, Varanasi, Uttar Pradesh, India*Both authors contributed {{equally to}} the articleAbstract: <b>Clocortolone</b> {{pivalate}} 0. 1 % cream is a class IV mid-strength topical glucocorticoid. After topical application the glucocorticoid achieves higher concentration in inflamed skin compared with normal skin. Furthermore, pharmacologic {{studies have shown}} that there is little systemic absorption of <b>clocortolone</b> pivalate and hence no adrenal suppression. Systematic review was performed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the glucocorticoid. PubMed, the Cochrane Library, and individual websites of the top 20 dermatology journals were searched using a defined strategy. Following the selection criteria, eight clinical trials were selected, of which five were randomized controlled trials. The trials mainly included patients with atopic dermatitis and eczemas. Quality appraisal of randomized controlled trials was done using the Delphi list, which showed that the trials had weaknesses in several items. The results of the systematic review tend to show that <b>clocortolone</b> pivalate cream is generally effective with early onset of action and has a good safety profile in the treatment of these conditions. Further studies comparing this glucocorticoid with other glucocorticoids and treatments in steroid-responsive dermatoses are desirable.
