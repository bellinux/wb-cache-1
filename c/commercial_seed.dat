2500|$|The {{flowers of}} Cannabis sativa are {{unisexual}} and plants {{are most often}} either male or female. It is a short-day flowering plant, with staminate (male) plants usually taller and less robust than pistillate (female) plants The flowers of the female plant are arranged in racemes and can produce hundreds of seeds. Male plants shed their pollen and die several weeks prior to seed ripening on the female plants. Although genetic factors dispose a plant to become male or female, environmental factors including the diurnal light cycle can alter sexual expression. Naturally occurring monoecious plants, with {{both male and female}} parts, are either sterile or fertile but artificially induced [...] "hermaphrodites" [...] can have fully functional reproductive organs. [...] "Feminized" [...] seed sold by many <b>commercial</b> <b>seed</b> suppliers are derived from artificially [...] "hermaphrodytic" [...] females that lack the male gene, or by treating the plants with hormones or silver thiosulfate.|$|E

50|$|Another {{problem has}} been {{the fact that it}} is {{somewhat}} expensive to register and then maintain a cultivar on a national list.

40|$|The {{effects of}} season and {{community}} composition as generated by livestock herbivory of differing intensity on seed species preference by Pogonomyrmex barbatus (F. Smith) were studied in a semiarid savanna on the Edward’s Plateau, TX. Seasonal differences in nutrient {{requirements of the}} colony could lead to differential preferences for seeds harvested in spring and fall. Field cafeteria studies were conducted {{to test the hypothesis}} that late successional species, with their high nutrient content, would be chosen regardless of grazing intensity or season. <b>Commercial</b> <b>seeds</b> of known nutrient content were used to test the hypothesis that high protein levels would be chosen in spring and high carbohydrate levels in the fall. Naturally occurring seeds were differentially harvested and some were preferred regardless of relative availability. Total seed harvest in cafeteria experiments was higher in spring than in fall. <b>Commercial</b> <b>seeds</b> were harvested equally among treatments within a season; thus, nutrient selection was indistinguishable. Preference for native species was significantly different in both seasons but was influenced by a significant interaction with grazing treatments. Bouteloua curtipendula, a late successional mid-grass, was harvested significantly more in the spring than the fall and at higher rates in the heavily grazed treatment, rejecting the hypothesis that they would be chosen regardless of treatment or season. Seed preference for late successional grasses within heavily grazed communities may slow succession after grazing. During disturbance recovery, late successional species may be reduced by forager preference and rates of spring harvest...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. There is a {{conflict}} between the wishes of farmers to seed all available occasions and those of scientists to randomly exclude some occasions that provide controls for comparison. This paper proposes the compromise of experimenting on differential effects of various treatments such as rates of seeding, seeding materials, place of delivery, etc [...] Randomized allocation of the alternative treatments could be "piggybacked " on ongoing <b>commercial</b> <b>seeding</b> operations- no occasion would be lost to seeding and yet randomized comparisons would be available. If such piggyback randomization were carefully monitored to avoid biases it should provide additional scientific evidence on seeding effects without {{reducing the amount of}} seeding desired by farmers...|$|R

5000|$|The main {{advantage}} of F1 hybrids in agriculture is also their drawback. When F1 cultivars {{are used as}} parents, their offspring (F2 generation) vary greatly from one another.
