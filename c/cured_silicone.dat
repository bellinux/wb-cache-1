For each paint an impression was recorded of a gauge block of known step height (1270 μm) and five impressions of the palatal surface of a laboratory standard maxillary central incisor were also recorded. All impressions were taken using an addition <b>cured</b> <b>silicone</b> impression material (President). The resultant electroconductive replicas were mapped using a computer controlled probe.

We first&# 13; tested this technique on the respiratory structure of a cadaver dog and then applied it to two small&# 13; manatees which had died through natural causes. Incisions {{were made in the}} trachea of both dog and&# 13; manatees and commercially available liquid silicone was then forced into the upper and lower&# 13; respiratory tracts used a slightly modified common automobile grease gun. The animals were then&# 13; refrigerated overnight and the silicone was allowed to cure for a period of 24 h. Results: In dog, we&# 13; removed <b>cured</b> <b>silicone</b> model by applying mild force to it after surgically opening the nasal cavity. In&# 13; the manatees some dissection was necessary for release of mold from the upper nasal cavity, but only&# 13; mild force was necessary with no dissection to release silicone model from the lower tract. Because the&# 13; models created exhibited great accuracy and fine structure, including presence of tertiary bronchi in&# 13; the manatee respiratory tract, we realized that the technique was applicable for use in other hollow&# 13; organs. We applied this method to the visualization of internal structure of a fresh beef heart and were&# 13; pleased with the accuracy and detail of model produced.

40|$|Rigid {{silicone}} resins, generally {{referred to}} as polyalkylsilsesquioxanes, are an important class of hybrid thermosetting polymers with both inorganic and organic characteristics. They have superior thermal stability, heat resistance, fire resistance, and still can be easily processed. Silicone resins recently have attracted much interest as low dielectric constant materials replacing silicon dioxide as interlevel dielectrics. Unfortunately, poor mechanical properties, such as brittleness and low strength, limit their broader acceptance and applications. Efforts to toughen them {{date back to the}} 1970 's, but little success has been achieved until now. Conventional polymer toughening techniques, such as incorporating second phase particles directly into the resins, typically do not work. Neither does decreasing the crosslink density of the resin network, which can compromise modulus and other properties. High fracture toughness and modulus addition <b>cure</b> rigid <b>silicone</b> resins are obtained in this study by a combination of intrinsic toughening and extrinsic toughening techniques. The addition <b>cure</b> <b>silicone</b> resin comprises two components: polyphenylsilsesquioxane oligomers containing silicon vinyls and low molecular weight silane crosslinkers containing silicone hydrides. The resin is cured by hydrosilylation between the two. Intrinsic toughening improves the plasticity and rigidity of the resin by choices of crosslinkers and polyphenylsilsesquioxane oligomers. The characteristics of molecular structure of the crosslinker and polyphenylsilsesquioxane oligomers that contribute to high fracture toughness and modulus are identified. (cont.)

40|$|PhDThe {{viscoelastic}} {{properties of}} soft lining materials are of enormous interest and importance as they clearly govern the biomechanical function of these materials. Forced vibration (Non-resonant) {{dynamic mechanical analysis}} was used to characterise the viscoelastic properties {{of a wide range of}} commercial (8 brands) as well as experimental soft liners (7 formulations). Forced vibration DMA is the ideal way of studying these materials as it can closely and accurately mimic physiological temperatures and frequencies under which they operate. The materials were studied as processed, and subsequently after simulated ageing for time periods up to twelve months. The water absorption and the subsequent changes in the viscoelastic behaviour of these materials are important as they spend a large part of their working lifetime immersed in solution. The results, where possible, were compared with the work of other researchers, and any sources of discrepancy examined. It was noted that the materials whose glass to rubber transition (Tg) was near their operating temperature (i. e. the acrylics) were particularly prone to any changes in the time and temperature domain of the experiment. A large variation was observed in the properties of the commercial materials available. At 37 Â°C and 1 Hz a seven fold range was seen in the real part of the modulus (2. 79 - 19. 7 MPa), and a fifty fold range was observed in the loss tangent (0. 029 - 1. 52). Given this wide disparity it is surprising that a universally recommended range of properties does not exist, although there is some speculation in the literature. The study of the ageing behaviour of these materials in water showed that the traditional hardening of the acrylics has been overcome. A heat <b>cured</b> <b>silicone</b> material was seen to be virtually unaffected by time, while for a cold cured competitor the opposite was true.

40|$|Crosslinking is a {{well-known}} procedure for improving a variety of features of polymers, particularly the dimension stability at elevated temperatures. Crosslinking implies {{the formation of a}} network, the gel, but there is always a certain portion of the material, the sol, that remains non-crosslinked within the network. Both fractions contribute to the properties of the crosslinked polymer, and the relative importance of the respective fraction depends on the type of polymer and the field of application. In this thesis, the significance of the molecular structure and property of a sol was illustrated by investigating the ability of crosslinked silicone elastomers to contaminate nearby structures, while analyses of the molecular structure of crosslinked polyethylene elucidated the behaviour of the network. The silicone study showed that the non-crosslinked fraction of a <b>cured</b> <b>silicone</b> elastomer consists mainly of non-volatile, low molecular weight siloxanes with a potential capacity of causing silicone contamination through migration. Gel-content determinations together with molecular weight determinations of the sol clearly showed that {{the most effective way to}} minimise migration is to remove the low molecular weight fraction prior to crosslinking. Thermal analyses demonstrated the pronounced temperature sensitivity of the crosslinking process, something which must be considered, as a too low temperature could lead to unnecessary low gel-contents, whereas an elevated temperature can be used as a tool to increase the final curing level. Analyses of crosslinked polyethylene demonstrated an extensive impact of the molecular weight on the gel-content formed upon crosslinking. Bimodal polyethylene, which always contains a substantial amount of low molecular weight chains, can thereby be prevented from developing high gel-contents upon crosslinking. A polymer network is to a large extent affected by the presence of long chain branches on the polymer chain. The amount and length of the branches influence the network performance mainly by affecting disentanglement of the branches. Coil volume and intramolecular crosslinking are other factors that are governed by the presence of long chain branches...|$|E
40|$|This {{study was}} {{undertaken}} {{to determine the}} root cause of secondary blooming (surface progesterone) and mottling (translucent regions) in the CIDR insert. A stability study on CIDR inserts found that the alternative supplier silicone (Dow Corning silicone is used in normal manufacture) did not exhibit either secondary blooming or mottling, in agreement with previous work. There was no difference in ‘in vitro’ drug release rate between CIDR inserts made from the two silicone feedstocks. This silicone was found to have a higher ratio of low molecular weight cyclic silicone compounds to straight chain silicone compounds (Measured through detected ion ratios in the leachate by ESMS). The exact relationship between blooming and secondary mottling and this discovery remains unknown. Results from this research found that part B of the Dow Corning silicone was not responsible for causing secondary blooming and mottling in contrast to previous research. ESMS and GCMS results found that the Dow Corning part B had a more complex composition than of the samples from Dow Corning part A and alternative supplier silicone part A and part B. It was found that addition of a silicone crosslinker into the Dow Corning silicone, increased mottling, but not secondary blooming. Increasing the mixing of progesterone and liquid silicone decreased mottling (via a static mixer), but did not increase surface progesterone. The results from two studies into the packing of CIDR inserts immediately after manufacture were contradictory as one found a decrease in mottling from packing in line, while the other found no change in mottling. However there was no difference observed in surface progesterone levels between the packing conditions. Studies on the length of cure were also found to have no predictable effect on mottling. Studies on arresting the cooling <b>cured</b> <b>silicone</b> above, between and below the melting points of the α and β progesterone polymorphs found that pausing cooling after cure at ~ 135 °C resulted in decreased secondary blooming and mottling, and that pausing after cure at ~ 125 °C exhibited less secondary blooming. Neither DSC nor XRD was able to determine a polymorphic bias in progesterone cooled by this cooling process (β progesterone polymorph was in all but one case (that had an added reduction in normal cooling rate)). Studies (XRD and DSC) on the cooling rate of progesterone found that only with very slow cooling rates was the α progesterone polymorph formed. XRD studies also revealed that the mottled regions of CIDR inserts exhibit the β progesterone polymorph, whereas the α progesterone polymorph was detected in non-mottled regions. The mottled regions were found to continue to exhibit the same polymorph after removal of surface progesterone, whereas the non-mottled regions gave no detectable XRD peak intensity. The study found useful information to assist in the determination of {{the root cause of}} secondary blooming and mottling in CIDR inserts. However the root cause remains unknown...|$|E
