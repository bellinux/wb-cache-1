50|$|A {{solution}} of ferric chloride etchant {{is applied to}} the surface of the cylinder, where it eats away the copper through the <b>carbon</b> <b>tissue.</b> In the highly exposed areas, where the <b>carbon</b> <b>tissue</b> photoresist is thickest and hardest, the etchant takes a long time to eat through the hard emulsion, while in the least exposed, thinnest regions the etchant eats through the resist into the copper very quickly. Thus, in a given period of etching, the cells etched into the copper will be deepest (and thus will print the darkest) in those regions where the etchant has eaten through the quickest, while the cells etched into the copper will be the shallowest (and thus print the lightest) in those regions where the etchant has eaten through the slowest.|$|E

50|$|In the {{original}} version of the printing process, <b>carbon</b> <b>tissue</b> (a temporary support sheet coated {{with a layer of}} gelatin mixed with a pigment—originally carbon black, from which the name derives) is bathed in a potassium dichromate sensitizing solution, dried, then exposed to strong ultraviolet light through a photographic negative, hardening the gelatin in proportion to the amount of light reaching it. The tissue is then developed by treatment with warm water, which dissolves the unhardened gelatin. The resulting pigment image is physically transferred to a final support surface, either directly or indirectly. In an important early 20th century variation of the process, known as carbro (carbon-bromide) printing, contact with a conventional silver bromide paper print, rather than exposure to light, was used to selectively harden the gelatin. A wide variety of colored pigments can be used instead of carbon black.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: A {{study on}} the Mode II interlaminar {{fracture}} characteristics of non-woven <b>carbon</b> <b>tissue</b> (NWCT) interleaved composites was carried out using the end-notched-flexure (ENF) test. The NWCT interleaved composites were made by interleaving NWCT-prepreg between CFRP layers. CFRP specimen [024] as well as NWCT interleaved specimen [012 /T/ 012] were prepared to compare the character-istics. The symbol ‘‘/T/’ ’ means that the NWCT layer {{is located at the}} 0 / 0 mid-plane of the interleaved specimen. Three kinds of interlaminar cracks, which have different positions in the NWCT layer, were introduced to the interleaved specimen. The ENF testing results were analyzed using the normal distribution. The mean GIIC of the interleaved specimen with an upper crack is about 26 % higher than that of the CFRP specimen due to a blunt shape of crack tip by Teflon film in the NWCT layer. The mean GIIC of the interleaved specimens with a center crack and a lower crack is about 260 and 205 % higher than that of the CFRP specimen due to the short fiber bridging from in-plain random short carbon fibers in the NWCT layer, respectively.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Interlaminar {{fracture}} {{behavior of}} non-woven <b>carbon</b> <b>tissue</b> (NWCT) interleaved composites was investigated under a Mode I loading condition using a double-cantilever-beam (DCB) specimen. The NWCT interleaved specimens {{were made by}} interleaving NWCT-prepregs between CFRP layers. CFRP specimen ([024]), NWCT interleaved specimen ([012 /Tn/ 012]) and NWCT composite specimen ([T 80]) were prepared under the same cure condition of the CFRP specimen. The symbol ‘‘/Tn/’ ’ means that the NWCT layer {{is located at the}} 0 / 0 mid-plane of the interleaved specimen, and n is the number of NWCT layers. The NWCT has short carbon fibers, discretely distributed with in-plane random orientation fibers. An interlaminar crack is introduced to a center of the interleaved specimens. The DCB testing results were analyzed using the normal distribution. When the short carbon fiber volume fraction in the NWCT layer is about 10 %, the Mode I interlaminar fracture toughness of the NWCT interleaved specimen is about 28 % higher than that of the CFRP specimen due to the fiber breakage of out-of-plane oriented short carbon fibers in the NWCT layer. The fracture process on the side-section and fracture surfaces of the interleaved specimen was observed with an optical microscope and a scanning electron microscope, and the failure mechanism was discussed.

40|$|The thesis work {{focuses on}} the electrosynthesis of active species on {{carbonaceous}} materials, their characterization and energy applications. Two protocols of electrochemical synthesis that lead to two forms of hexacyanoferrate copper (CuHCF) with different composition and structure, were applied. The procedure used is a “two–step” method that involves the deposition of metallic copper and the subsequent anodization {{in the presence of}} ferricyanide ion, using as support graphite sheet, carbon cloth and carbon toray paper. Another protocol was that of electrosynthesis of double layer hydroxide (LDH) containing cobalt as bivalent cation and aluminium or iron as trivalent metal, using as support graphite sheet, carbon cloth, carbon toray paper and nickel foam. After studying the correlation between the electrodeposition time and the masses obtained, the specific capacities of the deposited materials were calculated. The last used protocol was the electrochemical synthesis of nickel hexacyanoferrate on nickel foam. All the film obtained were electrochemically characterized by cyclic voltammetry. SEM – EDX and XRD analyses were performed on some samples in order to obtain morphological and chemical informations. Some tests were conducted using the supports or some of the electrodeposited samples as cathodes in lithium–air batteries, to understand their potential as sources of energy. After performing oxygen and argon cyclic voltammetries, controlling in what way the potential change at different current density and carrying out full discharge at constant current density, {{it was found that the}} <b>carbon</b> <b>tissue</b> was the one that produced the best results.

40|$|An {{idealized}} numerical ocean {{model is}} used to investigate {{the sensitivity of the}} partial pressure of atmospheric carbon dioxide (pCO 2) to changes in surface wind stress when mesoscale eddies are permitted in the flow. When wind stress increases, pCO_ 2 increases, and vice versa. The introduction of mesoscale eddies reduces the overall sensitivity of pCO 2 by changing the sensitivity of ocean carbon storage due to the saturation state of carbon dioxide, the net air-sea disequilibrium, soft <b>tissue</b> <b>carbon,</b> and the carbonate pump. However, a full carbon pump decomposition shows different responses for different ocean carbon storage terms.

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{attractive}} attributes of the gravure process {{is its ability to}} print a variable ink film by virtue of cell depth variation. This cell depth variation is achieved {{through the use of a}} diffusion resist. All diffusion resists are negative-working and, after exposure, require transfer to plate or cylinder. A 2 ̆ 2 negative-working 2 ̆ 2 resist is one where the emulsion becomes insoluble to the developing solution in those areas struck by actinic radiation. Presently available resists, which are directly applied to plate or cylinder prior to exposure, are not capable of controlling cell depth variation. Thus, the tone range obtainable in the print is limited. This sacrifice has been justified by advantages inherent in the direct system, such as ease of application and seamless image capability. It has long been recognized, however, that a direct system capable of variable cell depth control would be most advantageous. The purpose of this study is to examine the possible application of a radiation-sensitive/positive-working iron salt system for use as a direct diffusion resist. 2 ̆ 2 Positive-working 2 ̆ 2 refers to an emulsion which becomes soluble in those areas struck by actinic radiation. The is sensitized by immersing it in a potassium dichromate solution, and is then dried in the dark. The concentration of dichromate ranges from 2. 5 to 5 percent. The time of immersion varies with the temperature, the pH, and the strength of the bath. The water content of the gelatin before sensitizing is also most important. In general practice, gravure tissues are immersed in the dichromate bath for approximately three minutes. 2 ̆ 2 <b>Carbon</b> <b>tissue</b> is a long-scale process which can accurately reproduce a tone range of 1. 30 to as much as 1. 50 without going into the under- or over-exposed regions of the 2 photographic reproduction curve. 2 ̆ 2 Despite many disadvan tages associated with the instability of dichromated colloid layers, no other radiation-sensitive material has been found, up to the present, which can do the job so well. The sensitized and dried pigment paper is then exposed behind a photogravure screen which consists of opaque squares separated by narrow, clear lines (about 150 to 175 lines to the inch). The clear lines are usually about 1 / 3 the width of the opaque squares which they separate. The effect of this screen exposure is to form a network of insoluble lines of hardened gelatin. The next step is to print the screened tissue behind a continuous- tone positive transparency. This results in a negative resist in which the shadows are represented by gelatin hardened to only a historical roots of this concept are explored and the results of empirical tests explained. It is concluded that the relief characteristics of such a resist system are manifest in the solarization region of the characteristic curve...|$|E

40|$|Seagrass {{ecosystems}} {{have recently}} been identified for their role in climate change mitigation due to their globally-significant carbon sinks; yet, the capacity of seagrasses to sequester carbon {{has been shown to}} vary greatly among seagrass ecosystems. The recalcitrant nature of seagrass tissues, or the resistance to degradation back into carbon dioxide, is one aspect thought to influence sediment carbon stocks. In this study, a global survey investigated how the macromolecular chemistry of seagrass leaves, sheaths/stems, rhizomes and roots varied across 23 species from 16 countries. The goal was to understand how this seagrass chemistry might influence the capacity of seagrasses to contribute to sediment carbon stocks. Three non-destructive analytical chemical analyses were used to investigate seagrass chemistry: thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and solid state 13 C-NMR and infrared spectroscopy. A strong latitudinal influence on carbon quality was found, whereby temperate seagrasses contained 5 % relatively more labile carbon, and tropical seagrasses contained 3 % relatively more refractory <b>carbon.</b> Sheath/stem <b>tissues</b> significantly varied across taxa, with larger morphologies typically containing more refractory carbon than smaller morphologies. Rhizomes were characterized by a higher proportion of labile carbon (16 % of total organic matter compared to 8 – 10 % in other tissues); however, high rhizome biomass production and slower remineralization in anoxic sediments will likely enhance these below-ground tissues' contributions to long-term carbon stocks.
