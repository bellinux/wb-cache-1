40|$|Areas of {{particular}} significance during the Survey period include products liability and governmental immunity. In {{the area of}} products liability, the Michigan Supreme Court declined {{to determine whether a}} manufacturer of birth control pills has a duty to warn the ultimate user, stating that this determination is best left to the legislature. The court 2 ̆ 7 s reluctance to rule in the area of products liability for drugs sharply contrasted with its willingness to abolish implied warranty as a theory of liability for design defects. In the area of governmental immunity, the supreme court restructured the governmental immunity doctrine to shield state and local governmental agencies from tort liability, subject to narrow exceptions.

40|$|The {{increase}} of antidumping measures could represent {{a source of}} mounting frictions in the trading systems among Canada, United States and Mexico. Mexico is an active user of antidumping measures suggesting that both private sector groups and government policy makers have found antidumping measures to be a convenient response to the pressures of import competition. In the last two decades, Mexico has opened its economy to international commerce. Nevertheless, its economy and legal system are not {{comparable to those of}} the United States or Canada, although it has adopted analogous antidumping laws. The Mexican antidumping practice is based today on common law practices influencing civil law formalities. In the NAFTA context, more specifically, in its Chapter 19, legal problems facing the binational panel review system have arisen from Mexico's different legal tradition, notably in the areas of transparency and procedural issues, standard of review, parallel amparo and the power of panel vis-a-vis national courts. The procedural requirements of the Antidumping Agreement prove a challenge for Mexico and will likely lead to trade disputes <b>concerning</b> <b>procedure</b> because it lacks the tradition of administrative and legal process...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Transanal total mesorectal {{excision}} (TaTME) has rapidly {{become an}} important component of the treatment of rectal cancer surgery. Cohort studies have shown feasibility <b>concerning</b> <b>procedure,</b> specimen quality and morbidity. However, concerns exist about quality of life and ano(neo) rectal function. The aim of this study was to prospectively evaluate quality of life in patients following TaTME for rectal cancer with anastomosis. METHODS: Consecutive patients who underwent restorative TaTME surgery for rectal adenocarcinoma in an academic teaching center with tertiary referral function were evaluated. Validated questionnaires were prospectively collected. Quality of life was assessed by the EuroQol 5 D (EQ- 5 D), European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer's QLQ-C 30 and QLQ-CR 29 and low anterior resection syndrome (LARS) scale. Outcomes of the questionnaires at 1 and 6 months were compared with preoperative (baseline) values. RESULTS: Thirty patients after restorative TaTME for rectal cancer were included. Deterioration for all domains was mainly observed at 1 month after surgery compared to baseline, but most outcomes had returned to baseline at 6 months. Social function and anal pain remained significantly worse at 6 months. Major LARS (score > 30) was 33 % at 6 months after ileostomy closure. No end colostomies were required. CONCLUSIONS: TaTME is associated with acceptable quality of life and functional outcome at 6 months after surgery comparable to published results after conventional laparoscopic low anterior resection...|$|E

40|$|In any context the {{distinction}} between direct and derivative claims carries significant consequences. The procedural requirements are different, as are the available remedies. In addition, the remedies benefit different parties. A successful derivative claim typically enriches the corporate treasury, while a successful direct claim typically puts money directly {{in the hands of}} the shareholder claimant. Moreover, derivative defendants can shelter behind several powerful bulwarks-including special litigation committees and the business judgment rule-that are unavailable to direct defendants. Under the 2 ̆ 7 internal affairs 2 ̆ 7 doctrine, Minnesota law governs the direct/derivative issue for all Minnesota corporations. Current Minnesota law provides inadequate guidance when the corporation is closely held. The inadequacy has two main sources. First, the Minnesota rule for distinguishing between direct and derivative claims in general contains a serious conceptual flaw which confuses analysis regardless of the number of shareholders. Second, Minnesota close corporation cases rarely address the direct/derivative issue, and those that do, do so in a cursory fashion. Minnesota law, therefore, lacks a comprehensive, coherent approach for making the direct/derivative distinction in a Minnesota close corporation. This article seeks to improve matters by (1) examining and proposing a remedy for the fundamental conceptual flaw and (2) providing a conceptual framework for making the fine distinctions necessary in the close corporation context. As background, Part II describes direct and derivative claims in their pure forms. Part III describes the special problems faced by derivative plaintiffs as contrasted with direct plaintiffs and thereby shows why the direct/derivative distinction matters. Part IV explains why it is important to draw that distinction early in any litigation. Part V examines and critiques Minnesota 2 ̆ 7 s current approach to the direct/derivative analysis. Part VI proposes a special rule for making {{the distinction}} in the context of closely held corporations, and Part VII wraps up the analysis with some important details <b>concerning</b> <b>procedure</b> and remedies...|$|E
