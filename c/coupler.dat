5|$|Octave couplers, which add {{the pipes}} an octave above (super-octave) or below (sub-octave) each note that is played, may operate on one {{division}} only (for example, the Swell super octave, which adds the octave above {{what is being}} played on the Swell to itself), or act as a <b>coupler</b> to another keyboard (for example, the Swell super-octave to Great, which adds to the Great manual {{the ranks of the}} Swell division an octave above what is being played).|$|E

50|$|<b>Couplers</b> are the {{fittings}} which {{hold the}} tubes together. The most common are called scaffold <b>couplers,</b> {{and there are}} three basic types: right-angle <b>couplers,</b> putlog <b>couplers</b> and swivel <b>couplers.</b> To join tubes end-to-end joint pins (also called spigots) or sleeve <b>couplers</b> are used. Only right angle <b>couplers</b> and swivel <b>couplers</b> {{can be used to}} fix tube in a 'load-bearing connection'. Single <b>couplers</b> are not load-bearing <b>couplers</b> and have no design capacity.|$|R

40|$|We rigorously {{analyze and}} compare preferential-order {{waveguide}} grating output <b>couplers</b> using {{the finite-difference time-domain method}} in the total-field/scattered-field formulation for TE and TM polarizations. Four kinds of preferential-order grating <b>couplers</b> are studied: volume holographic grating <b>couplers,</b> slanted parallelogrammic surface-relief grating <b>couplers,</b> double-corrugated surface-relief grating <b>couplers,</b> and reflecting-stack surface-relief grating <b>couplers.</b> The outcoupling efficiencies and branching ratios of the <b>couplers,</b> revealing their preferentiality, are calculated and {{compared with the}} rigorous coupled-wave analysis leaky-mode method.

25|$|Two {{versions}} of radial <b>coupler</b> {{were used in}} South Africa. One, the Johnston <b>coupler,</b> commonly known as a bell link-and-pin <b>coupler,</b> was introduced in 1873 and is similar in operation to and compatible with link-and-pin couplers, but bell-shaped with a circular <b>coupler</b> face. The other, the bell-and-hook <b>coupler,</b> was introduced in 1902 and {{is similar to the}} Norwegian <b>coupler,</b> but also with a circular <b>coupler</b> face and with a <b>coupler</b> pocket which is open {{at the top of the}} <b>coupler</b> face to accommodate the drawhook.|$|E
25|$|The <b>coupler</b> {{is similar}} to the Norwegian <b>coupler.</b> It is a radial <b>coupler</b> with a <b>coupler</b> pocket which is open {{at the top of the}} {{coupling}} face. Instead of a link and pins, it makes use of a drawhook which, upon coupling, slides over the drawhook pin in the <b>coupler</b> of the next vehicle in the train. To prevent the drawhook of the mating <b>coupler</b> from accidental uncoupling, the <b>coupler</b> bell is equipped with a drawhook guard, commonly known as a bridle, above the <b>coupler</b> pocket.|$|E
25|$|Also {{known as}} a Janney <b>coupler</b> and the buckeye <b>coupler,</b> the knuckle <b>coupler</b> is the {{derivative}} of a coupling device that links and connects rolling railway cars such as passenger, refrigerator, freight, and stock cars together on railroad track. The knuckle <b>coupler</b> have a bifurcated drawhead and a revolving hook, which, when brought in contact with another <b>coupler,</b> automatically interlocks with its mate. Knuckle couplers replaced the much more dangerous link-and-pin couplers and {{became the basis for}} standard <b>coupler</b> design {{for the rest of the}} 19th century. The knuckle <b>coupler</b> was invented and patented by Eli H. Janney in 1873.|$|E
