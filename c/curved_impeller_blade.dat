In this work, the power requirements for seven types of 6 -curved <b>blade</b> <b>impellers</b> of varying curvature angles and central disk sizes, were analyzed via response surface methodology (RSM) and compared to a Ruston turbine. The experiments were conducted using water as the working fluid in a standard mixing vessel. Power consumptions were measured using a load cell arrangement {{for a wide range}} of speeds in both aerated and un-aerated conditions. The data revealed that the power number (NP) of the elliptical shape curved blade was 2. 8 whereas for CB 180 Â°, CB 160 Â° and CB 140 Â° were respectively 21, 32 and 75 higher. Furthermore, the power number values for the impeller with a 3 / 4 D central disk size was approximate 3. 4, while the impellers with 1 / 2, 1 / 4 and without central disk were respectively 15, 20 and 23. 5 higher. The results under different gas flow rates illustrated the power reduction of the <b>curved</b> <b>blades</b> <b>impellers,</b> both various central disk sizes and curvature angles, were in the range of 1 - 20 meanwhile the Rushton turbine was in the range of 5 - 45. Curvature angle and central disk size found as the significant parameters through variance analysis (ANOVA). The results also indicated that the significance of the central disk size was less than the other variables. The R-squared values indicated a fitting of the models with the experimental data.

This tekst covers {{fluid energy}} shape which uses in pump system. A pump is machine that imparts energy to a liquid to {{increase}} its pressure and move it from one point to another. There are many pump classification. One classification is acording to the method energy is imparted to the liquid: kinetic energy, or positive displacement. A centrifugal pump is of kinetic energy type because it imparts energy to a liquid by means of centrifugal force produced by a rotating impeller. Displacement pumps are of lower flow range and have pulsating flow rate. Centrifugal pump is rotodinamic pump that uses a rotating impeller to increase the pressure of liquid. They are commonly used to move liquids through a piping system. The liquid enters to the pump impeller along or near to the rotating axis and is accelerated bay the impeler, flowing radially outward into diffuser or volute chamber (casing), from where it exist into the downstream piping system. Like most pumps, a centrifugal pumps converts mechanical energy from a motor to energy of a moving fluid (liquid). Some of energy goes into kinetic energy of liquid motion and some into potential energy, represented by a liquid pressure or by lifting the liquid against gravity to higher level. The two major components of a centrifugal pumps are impeller and the casing in which it rotates. The transfer of energy from mechanical rotation of the impeller to the motion and pressure of the liquid is usually described by means of centrifugal force. Power from the driver, which is an electric motor, a diesel engine or a steam turbine (not for firefigting use) is transmitted to the pump through the shaft, rotating the impeller at high speed. In the modern centrifugal pump, most of the energy conversation {{is due to the}} outward force that <b>curved</b> <b>impeller</b> <b>blades</b> impart on the liquid. Invariability, some of the energy also pushes the liquid into a circular motion, and this circular motion can also convey some energy and increase the pressure at the outlet. The pumps are identified by the direction of the flow through impeller, with refernce to the axis of rotation. The total head of the pump is the energy imparted to the liquid as it passes through the pump. It may be expressed in various units of pressure, but for fire protection it’s generally given in units for pressure-bar or in units for long-m. The total head is calculated by subtracting the energy in the incoming fluid from the energy in the discharging liquid. Neto positive suction head (NPSH) is the pressure head that causes liquid to flow through the suction pipe and fitting into the eye of a pump impeller. The pump itself has no ability to ‘lift’ and the suction pressure depends {{on the nature of the}} supply. There are a two kinds of NPSH to consider. Pump NPSH is a function of the pump design and varies with the capacity and speed of any pump and with the design of different pumps. Available NPSH is a function of the system in which the pump operates and can be calculated readily. When the water source is above the pump, available NPSH is equal atmospheric pressure plus static head on suction minus friction and fitting losses in suction pipping minus vapor pressure of liquid. For any pump installation, the available system NPSH must be equal or greater than the pump NPSH at the desired operating condition. Pumps suppliers set the NPSH required (NPSHR) for a given pump. The (NPSHR) takes into account any potential head losses that might occur between the pump’ suction nozzle and impeller, thus ensuring that the liquid doesn’t drop below it’s vapour pressure...|$|R
