40|$|Epilepsy {{is one of}} {{the most}} common {{neurological}} disorders in humans, affecting all ages and both genders. The purpose of this study (approved by NHS Research Ethics Committee, Reference 14 /NW/ 0332) was to evaluate the potential of diffusion tensor and kurtosis imaging for detecting differences in measures of regional white matter integrity in adult patients with newly diagnosed epilepsy (NDE) in comparison with healthy controls. Diffusion Kurtosis imaging (DKI) is an extension of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) that can evaluate the abnormalities in white matter integrity, assuming a non-Gaussian distribution (Jensen at al. 2005). To our knowledge there are few studies reported using DKI in patients with Epilepsy (Zhang et al, 2013). Data were collected from patients attending Walton Centre NHS Foundation Trust and 15 NDE patients and 13 sex and age-matched healthy controls were recruited. All subjects were scanned using a Siemens 3 T Trio whole-body scanner (Siemens, Germany) with eight-channel radiofrequency (RF) <b>coil</b> <b>head</b> coil and immobilization to comfortably restrict head motion. DKI sequence consisted of 3 B-values and 60 Directions with the following parameters; TR/TE 5700 / 104 ms, acquisition matrix 72 * 72 mm, and a scan time of 12 minutes. Pre-processing and extraction of DKI/DTI measurements such as fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), mean kurtosis (MK) was done using ExploreDTI.

40|$|The transmit–receive (Tx/Rx) {{birdcage}} <b>head</b> <b>coil</b> {{is often}} used for excitation instead of the body coil because of the presumably lower risk of heating in and around conductive implants. However, this common practice has not been systematically tested. To investigate whether the Tx/Rx birdcage <b>head</b> <b>coil</b> produces less heating than the body coil when scanning individuals with implants, we used a 3 T clinical scanner and made temperature measurements around a straight 15 cm conductor using either the Tx/Rx body or the <b>head</b> <b>coil</b> for excitation. Additionally, the transmitted fields of a Tx/Rx <b>head</b> <b>coil</b> were measured both in air and in gel using a resonant and a non-resonant B field probes {{as well as a}} non-resonant E field probe. Simulations using a finite-difference time domain solver were compared with the experimental findings. When the body coil was used for excitation, we observed heating around the 15 cm wire at various anatomical locations (both within and outside of the active volume of the <b>head</b> <b>coil).</b> Outside its active area, no such heating was observed while using the Tx/Rx <b>head</b> <b>coil</b> for excitation. The E and B fields of the Tx/Rx birdcage <b>head</b> <b>coil</b> extended well-beyond the physical dimensions of the coil.

While caution must always be exercised when scanning individuals with metallic implants, these findings support the use of the Tx/Rx birdcage <b>head</b> <b>coil</b> in place of the body coil at 3 T in order to reduce the risk of heating in and around conductive implants that are remote from the <b>head</b> <b>coil...</b>|$|R

40|$|PURPOSE To quantitatively and qualitatively compare MR imaging of the {{temporomandibular}} joint (TMJ) using {{a standard}} TMJ surface <b>coil</b> and a <b>head</b> <b>coil</b> at 3. 0 Tesla (T). MATERIALS AND METHODS Twenty-two asymptomatic volunteers were MR-imaged using a 2 -channel surface coil (standard TMJ coil) and a 32 -channel <b>head</b> <b>coil</b> at 3. 0 T (Philips Ingenia, Philips Healthcare, The Netherlands). Imaging protocol consisted of an oblique sagittal PDw-TSE sequence (TR/TE, 2700 / 26 ms). For quantitative assessment, a spherical phantom was imaged {{using the same}} sequence including a noise scan and a B 1 + scan. Signal-to-noise-ratio-(SNR) -maps and B 1 + maps were calculated on a voxel-wise basis. For qualitative evaluation, all volunteers underwent MR imaging of both TMJs with the jaw in closed position. Two independent blinded readers assessed accuracy of TMJ anatomical representation and overall image quality on a 5 -point-scale. Quantitative and qualitative measurements were compared between coils using t-tests and wilcoxon-rank test, respectively. RESULTS Quantitative analysis showed similar B 1 + and significantly higher SNR for the <b>head</b> <b>coil</b> compared to the TMJ surface coil. Qualitative analysis showed significantly better visibility and delineation of clinically relevant anatomical structures of the TMJ, including the articular disc, bilaminar zone and lateral pterygoid muscle. Furthermore, better overall image quality was observed for the <b>head</b> <b>coil</b> compared to the TMJ surface coil. CONCLUSION A 32 -channel <b>head</b> <b>coil</b> is preferable to a standard 2 -channel TMJ surface coil when imaging the TMJ at 3. 0 T, because it yields higher SNR, thus increasing accuracy of the anatomical representation of the TMJ...|$|R

40|$|PURPOSE: Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) {{is highly}} {{sensitive}} to noise and improvement of radiofrequency coil technology represents a straightforward way for augmenting signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) performance in {{magnetic resonance imaging}} (MRI) scanners. The {{aim of this study}} was to characterize the dependence of DTI measurements of fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) on the choice of <b>head</b> <b>coil,</b> comparing two <b>head</b> <b>coils</b> with different functional designs and sensitivities. METHODS: Fourteen healthy subjects underwent DTI acquisitions at 1. 5 T. Every subject was scanned twice, using a standard quadrature birdcage <b>head</b> <b>coil</b> (coil-A) and an eight-channel array <b>head</b> <b>coil</b> (coil-B). FA and MD maps, estimated using both the linear least squares (LLS) and nonlinear least squares (NLLS) methods, were nonlinearly normalized into a standard space. Then, volumetric regions of interest encompassing typical white and gray matter structures [splenium of the corpus callosum (SCC), internal capsule (IC), cerebral peduncles (CP), middle cerebellar peduncles (MCP), globus pallidus (GP), thalamus (TH), caudate (CA), and putamen (PU) ] were analyzed. Significant differences and trends of variation in DTI measurements were assessed by the Wilcoxon test for paired samples with and without Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons, respectively. RESULTS: The overall SNR of coil-B was 30 % higher than that of coil-A. When comparing DTI measurements (coil-B versus coil-A), mean FA values (SCC, IC, and TH), mean MD values (IC, CP, GP, and TH), FA standard deviation (CP, MCP, GP, and CA), and MD standard deviation (IC, CP, TH, and PU) resulted decreased (significant difference, p(cor) < 0. 05, or trend of variation, P(uncor) < 0. 05) in several gray and white matter regions of the human brain. With the exception of CP, the results in terms of revealed significant difference or trend of variation were independent of the method (LLS and NLLS) used for estimating the diffusion tensor. CONCLUSIONS: In various gray and white matter structures, the eight-channel array <b>head</b> <b>coil</b> yielded more precise and accurate measurements of DTI derived indices compared to the standard quadrature birdcage <b>head</b> <b>coil...</b>|$|R
