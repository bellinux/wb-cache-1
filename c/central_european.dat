5|$|Gyromitra caroliniana is {{the type}} species of {{subgenus}} Caroliniana of genus Gyromitra. This grouping comprises species that have, in maturity, coarsely reticulate ascospores (i.e., with a network of ridges on the surface) with multiple blunt spines that originate from the reticulum on the spores. Other species in this subgenus include G.fastigiata and the <b>central</b> <b>European</b> species G.parma. In 1969, Erich Heinz Benedix believed that the spore reticulation was sufficiently unique to be worthy of designation as a separate genus, and he described Fastigiella to contain G.caroliniana. Harri Harmaja disagreed, later placing Fastigiella in synonymy with Gyromitra.|$|E
