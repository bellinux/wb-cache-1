50|$|ISAR is {{utilized}} in maritime surveillance for the <b>classification</b> <b>of</b> <b>ships</b> and other objects. In these applications {{the motion of}} the object due to wave action often plays a greater role than object rotation. For instance a feature which extends far over the surface of a ship such as a mast will provide a high sinusoidal response which is clearly identifiable in a two dimensional image. Images sometimes produce an uncanny similarity to a visual profile with the interesting effect that as the object rocks towards or away from the receiver the alternating doppler returns cause the profile to cycle between upright and inverted. ISAR for maritime surveillance was pioneered by Texas Instruments in collaboration with the Naval Research Laboratory and became an important capability of the P-3 Orion and the S-3B Viking US Navy aircraft.|$|E

40|$|Since {{the launch}} of ERS- 1 in 1991, {{a decade and a}} half of {{research}} has been devoted to automatic detection of ships in satellite radar imagery. However, it is only quite recently that this capability is operationally used; at present primarily in the fields of fisheries control and defence. The key has been the combination of remote sensing data with vessel position data from other sources. In contrast to detection, <b>classification</b> <b>of</b> <b>ships</b> in satellite radar imagery is much less developed, and will likely remain difficult in the near future. Concerning optical imagery, the recent high-resolution systems can readily detect ships from space, and their classification power is much higher than that of radar. However, much less effort has been devoted to development of automatic systems for optical, mostly because these sensors suffer more from the weather and are less suited for wide area surveillance.

40|$|The {{aim of the}} {{research}} presented in this paper is to find out whether automatic <b>classification</b> <b>of</b> <b>ships</b> from Forward Looking InfraRed (FLIR) images is feasible in maritime patrol aircraft. An image processing system has been developed for this task. It includes iterative shading correction and a top hat filter for the detection of the ship. It uses a segmentation algorithm based on the gray value distribution of the waves and the Hough transform to locate the waterline of the ship. A model has been developed to relate the size of the ship and the angle between waterline and horizon in image coordinates, to the real-life size and aspect angle of the ship. The model uses the camera elevation and distance to the ship. A data set was used consisting of two civil ships and four different frigates under different aspect angles and distances. From each of these ship images, 32 features were calculated, among which are the apparent size, the location of the hot spot and of the superstructures of the ship, and moment invariant functions. All features were used in feature selection processing using both the Mahalanobis and nearest neighbor (NN) criteria in forward, backward, and branch & bound feature selection procedures, to find the most significant features. Classification has been performed using a k-NN, a linear, and a quadratic classifier. In particular, using the 1 -NN classifier, good results were achieved using a two-step classification algorithm...|$|E

40|$|Arctic {{operations}} are mostly {{carried out in}} seas covered in ice. For these operations, both DNV GL and IACS provide regulations for <b>classification</b> <b>of</b> <b>ships.</b> Interaction with ice is difficult to determine, as it could occur in many different ways. The ice vary both spatial and temporal, hence each individual interaction are distinct. The strength of sea ice depends on; ice temperature, porosity, salinity, and load direction. The main scope of this Master s thesis is to study the behaviour of two plate fields located in the bow region of ice-going vessels, applying measurements of sea ice for load prediction. Uni-axial compression tests and parametric measures have been conducted by UNIS and prediction of ice loads are discussed in papers by Leira et al. (2009), Løset et al. (2006) and Riska (2011). This Master s thesis presents sea ice theory down to a molecular level. Applying both theory and measurements, the flexural strength of both level ice and ridged ice were predicted. Further, the flexural strengths were applied in estimation of empirical contact pressures. These pressures were compared to pressures obtained from regulations provided by DNV GL and IACS, by conducting an assessment of a local plate field in the bow region. The assessment of the local plate field proved the dimensioning based on regulations to be a minimum requirement. The findings stated that regulations from DNV GL in general provide less contact pressure than similar regulations from IACS. Additionally, {{it was found that}} the empirical contact pressure model was able to give a simplified estimate of one interaction with ice, as ice have large temporal and spatial variations. For the plate model located in the stem area, an empirical ridge ice pressure was applied and the boundary conditions were assessed. The model applied one fixed and three spring modelled boundaries. Findings from the assessment indicated the spring-modelled boundary to approach the behaviour of a fixed condition, as the spring stiffness was increased. Further, the modelling of the boundaries was only able to account for warping of the supportive frames. Both models suffered from large permanent deformations and entered the non-linear behaviour region, as the applied pressures had a high magnitude. Additionally, the stiffeners providing support for the plates suffered from both plastic hinges and warping...|$|E

Shipbuilding {{industry is}} formed through the maritime requirements and these requirements are {{formed by the}} national and international trade. Nowadays {{the activities of the}} energy sector taking place in the off-shore, around rigs, platforms and harsh sea conditions lead to new ship types and developments of new main and auxiliary systems on ships. Significant ship types of this purpose can be counted as floating production, storage and offloading units (FPSO’s), anchor handling vessels, seismic research vessels, pollution prevention ships (oil recovery ships), fire-fighting ships, accomodation ships, platform supply vessels, pipe laying vessels, etc. and they require features as to keep steady relative to a spatial or terrestrial reference point because they are oftenly subject to human or material transfer. Recently there are dynamic positioning systems present and even being developed for such vessels, in order to keep them in a specified position, route and avoid them from being affected by the environmental factors in the difficult sea conditions without being convicted to the abilities of persons. These systems try to fulfill their purpose on one hand with their complex mathematic structures {{and on the other hand}} with the components they work together as a whole. For this reason, component selection is to be made taking into consideration the purpose of the ship and areas where the ship will work. Due to high initial investment costs, physical impossibilities/difficulties of changes or conversions, great importance should be given to the right decisions at the beginning of the design phase. This thesis consists of five sections, from which the first is the Introduction, where the idea and main methods of position keeping is described. Three methods have been taken into account as most common, respectively jack-up systems, anchoring systems, which are more basic systems and lastly the dynamic positioning systems, which constitute more complex computer systems, enabling great maneouvring for the vessels. The first two systems, due to their nature, have constraints, the length of the legs of the jack-up barge and the chains of the anchor are defining the maximum sea depth they can be used. Moreover these systems are only available to work over a sea bed without obstructions. In the contrary, the dynamic positioning systems keep their position with the thrusters and they have no depth limit in the sea. They produce a high flexibility, because their position can easily be changed by a new command onto the computer, without the need of long time to retract legs or an anchor handling vessel to help collect the anchor. Components of dynamic positioning systems on ships have been taken into consideration and described with detailed information and the interaction between different components has been researched in the second section of the thesis. Components of the system are taken into account basically on four main subjects, namely reference systems, control systems, thrust systems and power systems. All the individual components of these subjects have been evaluated in accordance with their complexity, operational requirements, dependence to exterior references and effects of weather and other environmental factors. Radar based and DGPS reference systems are dependent on terrestrial equipment, however the acoustic and taut-wire systems operate only with their equipment, however these systems require areas where the equipment are not to be damaged or affected by environmental factors. They also do not work with an ultimate coordinate system however they can fix a reference system on each operation and keep their position relatively. The type and number of control system components will be determined in accordance with the DP class of the vessel and comfort of the operator requested. Therefore their criteria relevant to the dynamic positioning system are less and these systems are designed in an economical point of view compared to the material quality and furtherly to meet statutory regulations and classification society rules. The section continues with statutory requirements and class rules, in the examples of Norwegian Maritime Administration <b>classification</b> <b>of</b> <b>ships</b> operations requiring the dynamic positioning systems and Italian Classification Society RINA (Registro Italiano Navale) classification of equipment used on these systems. There are four principle classes defined for these ships, shortly semi automatic systems (not classified), automatic systems without backup (Class 1), with backup of active components (Class 2) and with a backup of physical separation of the equipment (Class 3). Equipment classes are determined in the design phase in accordance with the operations the vessel will be involved throughout its life. A computer code has been developed in Excel and VBA to provide an occasion to compare components on virtual ships and to discuss the results. The program aims to calculate the behaviour of a vessel with defined power systems, thrust systems and control parameters, from a point to another target point and direction. The calculation works by a step by step movement of the ship in three phases. In the first phase, the vessel turns its direction to the target point. Complying an accuracy defined in the program, the program shifts to the second phase, where the vessel moves towards the target and respectively to the third phase, where the vessel finally reached the target position and turns around to comply the target direction. In each step, thruster requirements, power demands and resulting consumption from all engines are cumulatively calculated. Section three of the thesis has all the details of the program and the parametric analysis, which is carried out to evaluate the systems, which are based on equipment capacity and effect the economic life of the vessel. The analysis has been conducted with eight virtual ships to compare two different parameters, from which one is the generator set power and the next is the Diff parameter of the control system, which regulates the behaviour of thrusters when approaching the target. The results of eight different ships have been presented in results graphs in section four, which enables the evaluation of the said parameters. The results have shown for ships with all other parameters completely equivalent and only generator powers different, that the less power led the generators under load continuously and further need of shaft alternators to cover the required power by thrusters. Too much capacity led to the non use of the second generator and the only one generator being heavily loaded. Intermediate generator powers led to the most economic results. The next parametric analysis showed that less number for approaching parameter Diff, resulted in the vessel to behave aggressive to approach the target before slowing down to catch the target, which led to more consumption on short time to aggressively stop the vessel on target and even in some cases led the vessel to miss the target and make more effort to catch back. In the contrary, too high parameters led the vessel to slow down very early and resulted in a long and less economic approach to target. Repeatingly the intermediate values chosen have shown more economic results. The program has been developed as an introductory code to evaluate the required components and therefore missed several features explained in the thesis with their reasons. These exclusions can be listed in four main subjects: 1) Program assumes the actual and target positions of the vessel are certain points and the processing of the data received from the reference systems has not been programmed. 2) The effects of the environmental factors have been neglected, because they have been considered to have an equal effect on each vessel in the parametric analysis. For this reason, processing of data such as wind/sea flow measurement and their effect on the ship have not been programmed. 3) It is deemed that each ship in water will have different behaviour and each thrust component power demand and their reaction on the vessel will be variable, main assumptions explained in the section 3. 3 have been made and the Diff and Chng parameters have been taken equal for each different thrust component. This leads to certain results at certain power demands and the need of mathematical model correction via a Kalman Filter is avoided. In fact, while applying the program to a real application, each thrust component should be defined separately by the values obtained from manufacturers, so that the forces and moments can be calculated acting on the ship at each unit power of the said thrust component. Furthermore the parameters should be defined for each thrust unit, defining how fast the thruster can react when sudden demands for power occur. 4) In dynamic positioning systems, it is possible to follow various algorhytms to reach a target position and keep that position. For instance, one method would be using the side thrusters in same direction together with the propulsion propellers to move towards the target without changing its ahead direction. Another method, obtained in this thesis, would be turning to the target in advance, approaching using propulsion propellers and lastly turning in position to keep the direction as targeted. These algorhytms are various and is matter of choice for the engineer designing the system. The program has been developed so far to support naval architects who are intending to design ships equipped with those systems or develope the dynamic positioning systems. In conclusion, section five summarizes the component selection and the results of the parametric analysis. This thesis, being the first to be written on the subject in Turkey, has made very clear with the computer program results, that selection of systems is not based on cheap/less capacity is economic or expensive/high capacity is unfeasable. All components are to be taken very carefully into account in the design phase of these vessels preferably with mathematic and/or physical models to estimate and evaluate the behaviour of the vessel under several position-keeping scenarios.

Determining the exact type <b>of</b> <b>ship</b> is not enough to declare it a threat. However, in the whole process from (multi-sensor) detection to the decision to act, <b>classification</b> <b>of</b> a <b>ship</b> into a more general class is already of great help, when this information is combined with other data to assist an operator. We investigated several aspects of the use of electro-optical systems. As for classification, this paper concentrates on discriminating classes of small vessels with different electro-optical systems (visual and infrared) as part of the larger process involving an operator. It addresses both selection of features (based on shape and texture) and ways of using these in a system to assess threats. Results are presented on data recorded in coastal and harbor environments for several small targets...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: {{to reveal}} {{directions}} of optimization {{of the legal}} adjusting of certification <b>of</b> air <b>ships</b> <b>of</b> general aviation, by realization of analysis of rules, procedure and subjects of registration <b>of</b> civil air <b>ships</b> and permissive system in Ukraine, USA, {{and also in the}} countries of the European concord.   Exposure of factors that restrain development of general aviation in Ukraine and grant to suggestion in relation to the improvement of the legal adjusting of certification <b>of</b> air <b>ships</b> <b>of</b> general aviation. Methods : the use of approach of the systems allowed to reveal basic directions of optimization of the legal adjusting of certification <b>of</b> air <b>ships</b> <b>of</b> general aviation of Ukraine, being base on experience of leading countries of the world. Results: in the article attention is accented on the lacks of the legal adjusting of Ukrainian general aviation,  in particular, to the legislative vagueness of concept of general aviation that limits her development in direction of realization as commercial and substantially narrows the spectrum of possibilities for her subjects, and also does this sector of aviation economically unattractive. Substantially absence <b>of</b> the ramified <b>classification</b> <b>of</b> air <b>ships</b> complicates the legal adjusting, what took into account sizes <b>of</b> air <b>ship,</b> engine, condition <b>of</b> take off the plane and landings, distance of flights, carrying capacity and other. The questions of optimization of the legal adjusting of certification <b>of</b> air <b>ships</b> <b>of</b> general aviation touch simplification of procedure of certification for ultralight, being base on experience of the USA, Canada, and also some countries of Europe. Discussion: authors offer the ways of optimization of the legal adjustment of certification <b>of</b> air <b>ships</b> <b>of</b> general aviation of Ukraine. </p...|$|R
40|$|Abstract:- Catamaran is a dual hull ship {{which has}} many {{advantages}} then the mono hull <b>ship.</b> Some <b>of</b> {{the advantages are}} excellent stability, Cruise in shallow water, large wide deck areas, large load carrying capacity, faster and Motion comfort etc. In this paper work, design of main or strength deck and Bulkhead structural member calculations for Catamaran ship used for transport for the crane (Mantis ® 10010 mx 46 ton tele-boom crawler crane) to its place <b>of</b> work. <b>Ship’s</b> main deck or Strength deck hull structural scantlings or calculations play a very vital role in carrying the deck loads such as crane load safely against the external pressures which are acting on the deck. This can done by designing the suitable deck and hull plate thickness, and it’s strengthening stiffening. The design of main deck involves determination of scantlings of deck plate, deck plate stiffeners, girders, pillars, Bulkhead and its stiffeners against the wheel load. Scantlings of deck and Bulkhead plates, stiffeners and girders to meet the local strength requirements are to be determined {{in accordance with the}} general principles of the rules. Scantlings of hull members should contribute the longitudinal strength <b>of</b> the <b>ship</b> and to be subjected to compressive stresses.
