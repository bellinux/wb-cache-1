30|$|Previous studies {{reported}} that continuous ingestion of <b>carbohydrate</b> before or during prolonged exercise attenuated elevation of plasma IL- 6 concentration (Nehlsen-Cannarella et al. 1997; Nieman et al. 2005). However, beneficial effect of <b>carbohydrate</b> ingestion was not {{evident in the}} present study. The {{finding is consistent with}} previous studies by Abbey and Rankin (2009) and Sim et al. (2012). Abbey and Rankin (2009) reported that <b>carbohydrate</b> ingestion (1.0  g/kg) before and the middle of 90  min of a simulated soccer game did not influence plasma IL- 6 concentration. Similarly, <b>carbohydrate</b> ingestion (3  ml/kg; 6  % <b>carbohydrate</b> solution) during 90  min of running did not affect exercise-induced IL- 6 response (Sim et al. 2012). The author speculated that the lack of the influence of <b>carbohydrate</b> ingestion on inflammatory response was due to insufficient amount of <b>carbohydrate</b> (a total of 855  ml solution, containing 0.73  g/kg of <b>carbohydrate).</b> However, the volume consumed during exercise session (1.0  g/kg) in the present study {{does not appear to be}} problematic because similar volume of <b>carbohydrate</b> (a total of 1219  ml solution, containing 1.1  g/kg of <b>carbohydrate)</b> revealed previously attenuation of inflammatory response during 90  min of high-intensity intermittent running (Bishop et al. 2002). Therefore, inconsistent outcomes among relevant studies may be attributed to the timing of <b>carbohydrate</b> consumption. In the previous studies that reported beneficial effect of <b>carbohydrate</b> ingestion (Nehlsen-Cannarella et al. 1997; Nieman et al. 2005), the subjects were provided <b>carbohydrate</b> frequently during prolonged exercise (every 15  min). Similarly, Bishop et al. (2002) demonstrated that <b>carbohydrate</b> ingestion during intermittent shuttle running maintained blood glucose concentration and subsequently blunted elevation of IL- 6 concentration when the <b>carbohydrate</b> was supplied every 15  min during the exercise. Considering these results, it is possible that more frequent supplementation of <b>carbohydrate</b> may cause apparent protective effect on elevation of IL- 6 concentration. Furthermore, Mb and CK concentrations (indirect muscle damage markers) did not differ significantly among three trials in the present study, although we expected that <b>carbohydrate</b> ingestion before and during exercise attenuated elevation of muscle damage markers. A plausible reason for lack of the effect may be also lower frequency of <b>carbohydrate</b> ingestion during exercise sessions.|$|R

40|$|To {{evaluate}} {{the effect of}} dietary <b>carbohydrate</b> content on postabsorptive glucose metabolism, we quantified gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis after 11 days of high <b>carbohydrate</b> (85 % <b>carbohydrate),</b> control (44 % <b>carbohydrate),</b> and very low <b>carbohydrate</b> (2 % <b>carbohydrate)</b> diets in six healthy men. Diets were eucaloric and provided 15 % of energy as protein. Postabsorptive glucose production was measured by infusion of [6, 6 - 2 H 2]glucose, and fractional gluconeogenesis was measured by ingestion of 2 H 2 O. Postabsorptive glucose production rates were 13. 0 +/- 0. 7, 11. 4 +/- 0. 4, and 9. 7 +/- 0. 4 micromol/kg x min after high <b>carbohydrate,</b> control, and very low <b>carbohydrate</b> diets, respectively (P < 0. 001 among the three diets). Gluconeogenesis was about 14 % higher after the very low <b>carbohydrate</b> diet (6. 3 +/- 0. 2 micromol/kg x min; P = 0. 001) compared to the control diet, but was not different between the high <b>carbohydrate</b> and control diets (5. 5 +/- 0. 3 vs. 5. 5 +/- 0. 2 micromol/kg x min).

We conclude that under eucaloric conditions in healthy subjects, dietary <b>carbohydrate</b> content affects the rate of postabsorptive glucose production mainly by modulation of glycogenolysis.

5|$|Because the {{ketogenic}} diet {{alters the}} body's metabolism, it is a first-line therapy {{in children with}} certain congenital metabolic diseases such as pyruvate dehydrogenase (E1) deficiency and glucose transporter 1 deficiency syndrome, which prevent the body from using <b>carbohydrates</b> as fuel, leading to a dependency on ketone bodies. The ketogenic diet is beneficial in treating the seizures and some other symptoms in these diseases and is an absolute indication.

5|$|Carbohydrate {{catabolism}} is {{the breakdown}} of <b>carbohydrates</b> into smaller units. <b>Carbohydrates</b> are usually taken into cells once they have been digested into monosaccharides. Once inside, the major route of breakdown is glycolysis, where sugars such as glucose and fructose are converted into pyruvate and some ATP is generated. Pyruvate is an intermediate in several metabolic pathways, but the majority is converted to acetyl-CoA through aerobic (with oxygen) glycolysis and fed into the citric acid cycle. Although some more ATP is generated in the citric acid cycle, the most important product is NADH, which is made from NAD+ as the acetyl-CoA is oxidized. This oxidation releases carbon dioxide as a waste product. In anaerobic conditions, glycolysis produces lactate, through the enzyme lactate dehydrogenase re-oxidizing NADH to NAD+ for re-use in glycolysis. An alternative route for glucose breakdown is the pentose phosphate pathway, which reduces the coenzyme NADPH and produces pentose sugars such as ribose, the sugar component of nucleic acids.|$|E
40|$|Aim: <b>Carbohydrate</b> {{counting}} is used {{to adjust}} premeal insulin to <b>carbohydrate</b> intake in intensive insulin regimens. The aim {{of the present study}} was to determine the potential variability in the <b>carbohydrate</b> content of a slice of bread (one ‘exchange’) from that reported on the label and hence, the potential variability in <b>carbohydrate</b> intake when consuming a serve. Methods: A cross-sectional survey of 11 different loaves of bread commonly consumed by children with type 1 diabetes was undertaken. All slices in each loaf were weighed to an accuracy of ± 1 g; and the reported <b>carbohydrate</b> content per 100 g of each loaf was used to determine the <b>carbohydrate</b> content of the mean, minimum and maximum slice in each loaf of bread. Results: There was no difference between the reported and the mean estimated <b>carbohydrate</b> content of a slice. The minimum slice of bread across all loaves was estimated to contain only 10. 0 g of <b>carbohydrate,</b> whereas the maximum slice contained an estimated 20. 7 g of <b>carbohydrate.</b> The greatest variation in <b>carbohydrate</b> amount within a loaf was 12. 3 g. Conclusions: In commercially available loaves of bread in Australia, the <b>carbohydrate</b> content of a slice can vary by up to 45 % of that reported on the label, in accordance with Food Standards Australia New Zealand.

Results: The 40 -g <b>carbohydrate</b> meal resulted in significantly more hypoglycaemia than the other meals (P = 0. 003).
