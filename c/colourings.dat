5|$|Other {{defensive}} {{strategies are}} {{the use of}} camouflage, fleeing, and aggression. Some species have adopted <b>colourings,</b> shapes, and patterns that {{make it difficult for}} predators that hunt by sight to detect them. They tend to be dull shades of brown, grey, and green that blend into their background, and desert species tend to be pale. Some species can fly, but the mode of flight tends to be clumsy, so the most usual response to danger is to scuttle away to find a hiding place.|$|E
5|$|The red fox {{originated}} from smaller-sized ancestors from Eurasia during the Middle Villafranchian period, and colonised North America {{shortly after the}} Wisconsin glaciation. Among the true foxes, the red fox represents a more progressive form {{in the direction of}} carnivory. Apart from its large size, the red fox is distinguished from other fox species by its ability to adapt quickly to new environments. Despite its name, the species often produces individuals with other <b>colourings,</b> including albinos and melanists. Forty-five subspecies are currently recognised, which are divided into two categories: the large northern foxes, and the small, basal southern foxes of Asia and North Africa.|$|E
5|$|Many {{amphibians}} are nocturnal {{and hide}} during the day, thereby avoiding diurnal predators that hunt by sight. Other amphibians use camouflage {{to avoid being}} detected. They have various <b>colourings</b> such as mottled browns, greys and olives to blend into the background. Some salamanders adopt defensive poses when faced by a potential predator such as the North American northern short-tailed shrew (Blarina brevicauda). Their bodies writhe and they raise and lash their tails which {{makes it difficult for}} the predator to avoid contact with their poison-producing granular glands. A few salamanders will autotomise their tails when attacked, sacrificing this part of their anatomy to enable them to escape. The tail may have a constriction at its base to allow it to be easily detached. The tail is regenerated later, but the energy cost to the animal of replacing it is significant.|$|E
40|$|The VERTEX <b>COLOURING</b> {{problem is}} known to be NP-complete in the class of triangle-free graphs. Moreover, it remains NP-complete even if we {{additionally}} exclude a graph F which is not a forest. We study the computational complexity of the problem in (K(3), F) -free graphs with F being a forest. From known results it follows that for any forest F on 5 vertices the VERTEX <b>COLOURING</b> problem is polynomial-time solvable in the class of (K 3, F) -free graphs. In the present paper, we show that the problem is also polynomial-time solvable in many classes of (K 3, F) -free graphs with F being a forest on 6 vertices...|$|R
40|$|One of {{the driving}} {{problems}} in the CSP area is the Dichotomy Conjecture, formulated in 1993 by Feder and Vardi [STOC' 93], stating that for any fixed relational structure G the Constraint Satisfaction Problem CSP(G) is either NP [...] complete or polynomial time solvable. A large amount of research has gone into checking various specific cases of this conjecture. One such variant which attracted {{a lot of attention}} in the recent years is the LIST MATRIX PARTITION problem. In 2004 Cameron et al. [SODA' 04] classified almost all LIST MATRIX PARTITION variants for matrices of size at most four. The only case which resisted the classification became known as the STUBBORN PROBLEM. In this paper we show a result which enables us to finish the classification - thus solving a problem which resisted attacks for the last six years. Our approach is based on a combinatorial problem known to be at least as hard as the STUBBORN PROBLEM - the 3 -COMPATIBLE <b>COLOURING</b> problem. In this problem we are given a complete graph with each edge assigned one of 3 possible colours and we want to assign one of those 3 colours to each vertex {{in such a way that}} no edge has the same colour as both of its endpoints. The tractability of the 3 -COMPATIBLE <b>COLOURING</b> problem has been open for several years and the best known algorithm prior to this paper is due to Feder et al. [SODA' 05] - a quasipolynomial algorithm with a n^O(log n / log log n) time complexity. In this paper we present a polynomial-time algorithm for the 3 -COMPATIBLE <b>COLOURING</b> problem and consequently we prove a dichotomy for the k-COMPATIBLE <b>COLOURING</b> problem.

40|$|Tabu Search (TS) is a {{well known}} local search method which has been widely used for solving AI problems. Different {{versions}} of TS have been proposed in the literature, and many features of TS have been considered and tested experimentally. The feature that is present in almost all TS variants is the so called (short-term) tabu list which is recognised as the crucial issue of TS. However, {{the definition of the}} parameters associated with the tabu list remains in most TS applications still a handcrafted activity. In this work we undertake a systematic study of the relative influence of few relevant tabu list features on the performances of TS solvers. In particular, we apply statistical methods for the design and analysis of experiments. The study focuses on a fundamental theoretical problem (GRAPH <b>COLOURING)</b> and on one of its practical specialisation (EXAMINATION TIMETABLING), which involves specific constraints and objectives. The goal is to determine which TS features are more critical for the good performance of TS in a general context of applicability. The general result is that, when the quantitative parameters are well tuned, the differences with respect to qualitative parameters become less evident...|$|R

40|$|In this thesis, we {{research}} the computational {{complexity of the}} graph colouring problem and its variants including precolouring extension and list colouring for graph classes that can be characterised by forbidding one or more induced subgraphs. We investigate the structural properties of such graph classes and prove {{a number of new}} properties. We then consider to what extent these properties can be used for efficiently solving the three types of colouring problems on these graph classes. In some cases we obtain polynomial-time algorithms, whereas other cases turn out to be NP-complete. We determine the computational complexity of k-COLOURING, k-PRECOLOURING EXTENSION and LIST k-COLOURING on P_k-free graphs. In particular, we prove that k-COLOURING on P_ 8 -free graphs is NP-complete, 4 -PRECOLOURING EXTENSION P_ 7 -free graphs is NP-complete, and LIST 4 -COLOURING on P_ 6 -free graphs is NP-complete. In addition, we show the existence of an integer r such that k-COLOURING is NP-complete for P_r-free graphs with girth 4. In contrast, we determine for any fixed girth g≥ 4 a lower bound r(g) such that every P_r(g) -free graph with girth at least g is 3 -colourable. We also prove that 3 -LIST <b>COLOURING</b> is NP-complete for complete graphs minus a matching. We present a polynomial-time algorithm for solving 4 -PRECOLOURING EXTENSION on (P_ 2 +P_ 3) -free graphs, a polynomial-time algorithm for solving LIST 3 -Colouring on (P_ 2 +P_ 4) -free graphs, and a polynomial-time algorithm for solving LIST 3 -COLOURING on sP_ 3 -free graphs.

25|$|The Sillaginidae are {{medium-sized}} fishes which grow to {{an average}} of around 20cm and around 100 g, although the largest member of the family, the King George whiting is known to reach 72cm and 4.8kg in weight. The body shape and fin placement of the family is quite similar to most {{of the members of the}} order Perciformes. Their bodies are elongate, slightly compressed, with a head that tapers toward a terminal mouth. The mouth has a band of brush-like teeth with canine teeth present only in the upper jaw of Sillaginopsis. The cranial sensory system of the family is well developed above and laterally, with the lower jaw having a pair of small pores behind which is a median pit containing a pore on each side. On each side of the elongate head the operculum has a short sharp spine. They have two true dorsal fins; the anterior one supported by 10 to 13 spines while the long rear one is held up by a single leading spine followed by 16 to 27 soft rays. The anal fin is similar to the second dorsal fin, having two small slender spines followed by 14 to 26 soft rays. Their bodies are covered in ctenoid scales, with the exception of the cheek which may have cycloid or ctenoid scales. There is a wide variation in the amount of lateral line scales, ranging from 50 to 141. The swimbladder in the Sillaginidae is either absent, poorly developed, or highly complex with anterior and lateral extensions that project well into the caudal region. A unique duct-like process is present from the ventral surface of the swimbladder to just before the urogenital opening in most species. The presence and morphology of each species' swim bladder is often their major diagnostic feature, with McKay's three proposed subgenera based on swimbladder morphology alone. The sillaginids have only a small range of body <b>colourings</b> and frequently the only colour characteristics to identify between species are the arrangements of spots and bars on their upper bodies. Most of the family are a pale brown – creamy white colour, while a few species are silver all over. The undersides of the fish are usually lighter than the upper side, and the fins range from yellow to transparent, often marked by bars and spots.|$|E
