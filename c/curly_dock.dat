5000|$|The {{mountain}} leafhopper survives on winter {{annual weeds}} during winter, usually near stream banks or canals. In late winter or spring, adults {{can be found}} in sugar beet fields and can then migrate to favored weed hosts (<b>curly</b> <b>dock,</b> burclovers) in orchards. The mountain leafhopper is most often the abundant vector found on cherry, however, cherry is not the preferred host and the leafhopper does not reproduce on cherry. Preferred hosts for the mountain leafhopper are; alfalfa, California burclover, clovers, <b>curly</b> <b>dock,</b> and sweet clovers. Of the preferred hosts alfalfa and <b>curly</b> <b>dock</b> cannot become infected with the disease itself but are just a host for the leafhopper. Occasional hosts are; vetches (in legume family) and sweet cherry. It’s believed that the role of this leafhopper is introducing the disease into cherry orchards rather than spreading the disease between cherry trees within an orchard.(http://ucanr.org/sites/cccoopext/files/80935.pdf) ...|$|E
50|$|The {{herbaceous}} hosts {{are common}} weeds (i.e. clovers, dandelions, alfalfa) {{that serve as}} a feeding ground for the mountain leafhoppers. The herbaceous hosts {{are the source of}} the X Disease, which is picked up and transmitted to the cherry hosts by the mountain leafhopper. (See Environment) For a control, conventional herbicides are effective. There exists a common herbaceous host, <b>curly</b> <b>dock,</b> which serves as the mountain leafhopper's main breeding ground. Getting rid of <b>curly</b> <b>dock</b> with an herbicide would be key to limit the population, thus limiting the spread of the X Disease to the cherry hosts.|$|E

Removal of the other host plants, such as <b>curly</b> <b>dock,</b> wild dock, sunflower, and thistle, during midsummer, when the L. concavus larvae are still in them, may also help to reduce pest populations.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Curly</b> <b>dock</b> {{grows in}} a wide variety of habitats, {{including}} disturbed soil, waste areas, roadsides, fields/meadows, shorelines, and forest edges.It is widely naturalised throughout the temperate world and has become a serious invasive species in many areas, including throughout North America, southern South America, New Zealand and parts of Australia. It spreads through the seeds contaminating crop seeds, and sticking to clothing. It is classified as an [...] "injurious weed" [...] under the UK Weeds Act 1959. It is often seen in disturbed soils at the edges of roadsides, railway beds, and car parks.|$|E
50|$|It {{can be used}} as a wild leaf vegetable; {{the young}} leaves should be boiled in several changes of water to remove as much of the oxalic acid in the leaves as {{possible}} or can be added directly to salads in moderate amounts. Once the plant matures it becomes too bitter to consume. Dock leaves are an excellent source of both vitamin A and vitamin C, as well as a source of iron and potassium. <b>Curly</b> <b>Dock</b> leaves are somewhat tart due to the presence of high levels of oxalic acid, and although quite palatable, this plant should only be consumed in moderation as it can irritate the urinary tract and increase the risk of developing kidney stones. It should be used with care during lactation, as it may cause a laxative effect in the infant.|$|E
50|$|Lixus concavus {{is able to}} {{complete}} its lifecycle in the stalks of <b>curly</b> <b>dock,</b> sunflowers, and thistles; eggs are laid singly in 1/8 in cavities, created by feeding activity, and hatch within a week to 10 days. One grub usually develops per plant, the larva having borrowed through the stalk down to ground level, where pupation occurs after around nine weeks; the larva chews an exit hole for the adults before pupating. The pupa is whitish and measures 14-15 mm long. The head bears the long snout of the adult form. The abdominal segments are marked with short spines. The larva takes {{a few weeks to}} develop into an adult that feeds for a few weeks before seeking out a site to overwinter. The weevil has one generation per year. The adult weevil feeds upon the margins of the leaves besides puncturing the stalks; damage appears as distinct notches in the plant tissues.|$|E
50|$|Mountain {{leafhopper}} (Colladonus montanus) overwinters on winter annual weeds, particularly near {{streams and}} canals. Adults can be plentiful on sugarbeet during late winter/spring and migrate to favored weed hosts such as <b>curly</b> <b>dock</b> or burclovers in orchards. The Mountain leafhopper is most abundant vector found on cherry {{but does not}} reproduce on cherry. The mountain leafhopper (Colladonus montanus) spreads the disease from wild herbaceous hosts to woody hosts. It is believed {{that it is more}} responsible for the introduction of the disease into cherry trees, then in transferring them from cherry tree to cherry tree in an orchard. The cherry leafhopper (Fieberiella florii) reproduces on a broad range of woody hosts. The cherry leafhopper is more important in vectoring the disease from tree to tree within an orchard, since cherry is a favored host. After a leafhopper feeds on an infected host the pathogen has to undergo a latent period. During the latent period the pathogen spreads and multiplies inside the vector. Depending on temperature and the vector, the average latent period for the cherry x disease is about a month or longer. The phytoplasma is then transmitted from the leafhopper to the tree when the leafhopper is feeding on the trees phloem. It's then spread throughout the tree becoming systemic. July through October is when the highest concentrations of pathogen are present in leaves of infected trees.|$|E

Treatments were temperature ranges (5 / 15, 10 / 20, 15 / 25, 15 / 30 and 20 / 35 ° C night / day) and different levels of salinity (0, 10, 20, 40, 80, 160 and 320 mM of NaCl). The effect of pH adjusted to 5 - 9 by using acid buffer solution. Seeds were planted at different depth (0, 1, 2, 3 and 4 cm) to study their effects on seedling emergence. Results showed that black henbane exhibited highest germination percentage at 25 / 15 diurnal tempratures, with 86. 50 and 60. 50 respectivly for daylight and complete darkness. Germination of ground cherry was highest (93 %) at 10 / 20 diurnal temprature and 41 % in complete darkness. Highest germination percentage for <b>curly</b> <b>dock</b> at diurnal temperatures of 20 / 10, 25 / 15 and 30 / 20 with light / dark regime of constant darkness was abserved. The seeds at diurnal temprature of 35 / 25 in both light regimes did not germinate. Increasing salinity reduced germination. Increasing the osmotic potential, also reduced germination significantly. Highest germination percentage of black henbane (97 %) was observed at pH 7, and lowest germination (17 %) at pH 9. Increasing planting depth reduced seedling emergence significantly.

40|$|Third instar hop vine borer (Hydraecia immanis) {{and potato}} stem borer (H. micacea) are new pest species on corn in the Midwest. Early instar larvae feed on small-stemmed grasses, and later instar larvae switch to broad- stemmed hosts to {{complete}} development. In {{order to assess}} potential suitability of various weeds of corn fields, larvae were reared on seven selected broad- leaved plants for 16 - 18 days under greenhouse conditions to determine their feeding behavior and performance. Domestic plants included hop (Humulus lupulus) and potato (Solanum tuberosum); weed species included <b>curly</b> <b>dock</b> (Rumex crisp us), redroot pigweed (Amaranthus retroflexus), lambsquarters (Chenopodium album), common ragweed (Ambrosia artemisiifolia) and giant ragweed (A. trifida).

40|$|High {{germination}} of <b>curly</b> <b>dock</b> (Rumex crispus L.) seeds {{is evident}} after suitable imbibition and temperature shift treatment, but germination at constant temperatures fails without an input of far red-absorbing form of phytochrome. Preliminary imbibitions at high temperatures (30 C) sharply reduce germination induced by temperature shifts. High germination may be restored by low energies of red radiation, or by brief far red adequate for the photosteady state. Prolonged far red during imbibition also nullifies temperature shift-induced germination. After prolonged far red, high germination may be restored by red radiation of an energy {{dependent upon the}} duration of the far red treatment. The evidence supports the conclusion that dark germination induced by temperature shifts arises from the interaction of pre-existent far red-absorbing form of phytochrome in the mature seeds with the temperature shift...|$|E

40|$|Onion thrips, Thrips tabaci Lindeman, {{is a key}} foliage-feeding pest of onion {{worldwide}} and the principal vector of a serious onion pathogen, Iris yellow spot virus (IYSV). Long-term management of T. tabaci and IYSV will require an understanding of T. tabaci ecology and IYSV epidemiology in onion ecosystems. This study focused on identifying winter-annual, biennial and perennial weed species that host both T. tabaci and IYSV. Unlike summer-annual weeds, weeds with these habits survive overwinter and {{could serve as a}} green bridge for IYSV to survive between onion-growing seasons. T. tabaci larvae and adults were sampled every two weeks from 69 weed species in five areas located adjacent to onion fields in western New York in 2008 and 2009. Twenty-five of the 69 weed species were identified as hosts for T. tabaci larvae and populations were highest on the Brassicaceous weeds, Barbarea vulgaris Ait. f., Sinapis arvensis L., and Thalspi arvense L. None of these species are hosts for IYSV.

40|$|Most {{powerful}} and effective method of weed control is by chemical substances called herbicides. In recent years, they were published quite data on different {{side effects of}} herbicides on humans, animals, crops and the environment as a whole. Therefore, the increased interest for biological weed control lately is reasonable, since its improvement and expansion will contribute to limiting excessive use of herbicides, respectively their harmful effects and will support the successful implementation of complex weed control. The {{purpose of this study}} was to investigate the effect of selected plant species, containing allelopathic active substances, on germination, growth and biomass of some widespread weeds in wheat. Experiments were carried out at laboratory conditions using seeds of wheat (Triticum aestivum L., sort Sadovo 1) and most common weeds therein: Johnson grass (Sorghum halepense (L) Pers), white pigweed (Chenopodium album L.), twitch (Cynodon dactylon L.) and <b>curly</b> <b>dock</b> (Rumex crispus L.). Allelopathic substances were extracted with distilled water from flowers of lavender (Lavandula angustifolia Mill.), leaves of basil (Ocimum basilicum L.), leaves of spearmint (Mentha longifolia (L) Huds.), and leaves of peppermint (Mentha piperita L.). Of the tested active allelopathic plants, the most negative impact on germination of all weeds seeds (including wheat), as well as on the development of plants exhibited the water extract of lavender. Lavender and basil had a stronger negative effect on white pigweed and twitch compared with both mint species.

40|$|Graduation date: 2003 Small broomrape, a holoparasitic weed, is a {{relatively}} new weed introduction in the Pacific Northwest that has contaminated a limited number of red clover fields in Oregon. Greenhouse and field studies were conducted to evaluate small broomrape response to common crop and weed species in the Pacific Northwest. Host species in the greenhouse or field study included alfalfa, arrowleaf clover, carrot, celery, common vetch, crimson clover, lettuce, prickly lettuce, red clover, spotted catsear, subterranean clover, white clover, and wild carrot. False-host species included barley, birdsfoot trefoil, creeping bentgrass, cucumber, field corn, fine fescue, flax, Italian ryegrass, nasturtium, oat, orchardgrass, perennial ryegrass, snap bean, sugar pea, sunflower, sweet corn, tall fescue, tomato, and wheat. Non-host species included sugar beet and <b>curly</b> <b>dock.</b> The greenhouse polyethylene bag system provided a rapid and inexpensive screening for plant species host status to small broomrape. Germination and attachment to host roots are initiated by chemical exudates, that may change concentration in response to nutrient availability and microorganisms. Red clover was grown in varying concentrations of ammonium sulfate fertilizer with and without Rhizobium inoculation, and with small broomrape seeds. Neither Rhizobium inoculation nor ammonium concentration influenced the number of small broomrape attachments to red clover roots. A survey was conducted of red clover seed growers with small broomrape-contaminated fields in the Pacific Northwest. Red clover seed from six respondents were cleaned at the same cleaning facility, and the same respondents purchased their seed stock from this cleaning facility.

Common lespedeza, Kummerowia striata cv. Kobe, was a good host for all populations and isolates. Therefore, a plant {{was considered to be}} a host if the number of females produced on it was 10 % or more of the number on Kobe. All seven populations reproduced on Trifolium repens and T. pratense. None reproduced on Beta vulgaris or Glycine max. One single-cyst isolate from the Australian population produced a few females on T. pratense. The Australian population maintained on carnation, Dianthus caryophyllus, produced females on carnation but not on <b>curly</b> <b>dock,</b> Rumex crispus. However, its subpopulation maintained on T. repens produced females on R. crispus but not on carnation. Four of the other six populations produced females on R. crispus, and four produced females on carnation. Differences in host range were observed among seven of the mother populations and their SCI, and among isolates within each population. Five host range patterns were found in populations and SCI of H. trifolii. Significant quantitative differences occurred among populations in the numbers of females on most hosts, between isolates and their original populations, and among isolates from the same population. SCI selected from white clover produced fewer females on a series of test hosts and had host ranges the same as or narrower than those of the original populations. However, SCI selected from Kobe lespedeza had more females on some hosts and had host ranges the same as or wider than those of the original populations.

40|$|Onion thrips, Thrips tabaci Lindeman (Thysanoptera: Thripidae), is a pest of onion {{crops and}} other Allium spp. {{worldwide}} {{and is the}} only known vector of Iris yellow spot virus (IYSV) (Bunyaviridae: Tospovirus), a yieldreducing pathogen infecting onion. IYSV was first detected in New York onion fields in 2006 and has since been found throughout all of the major onion producing regions in the state. Recent studies in New York have shown that IYSV can reduce bulb size, suggesting that this disease may cause serious economic losses for the onion industry. Sources of IYSV in New York onion fields have only recently become better understood. IYSV may be annually introduced via transplanted onions imported from AZ, where the virus is established. IYSV also may be established in New York and bridge seasons through volunteer onion p lants and winter-annual, biennial and perennial weeds near onion fields. However, weed species that may be important in the epidemiology of IYSV in onion fields are not known. T. tabaci can only acquire IYSV as first instars. Therefore, a weed can only be a source for IYSV if it is also a host for immature T. tabaci. Because weed hosts that would support larval populations of T. tabaci were not known for the Great Lakes region of North America including New York, the main purpose of this research was to identify weed species that supported populations of T. tabaci larvae. In 2008 and 2009, common weed species and T. tabaci larvae were sampled from spring through early fall in the Elba Muck onion-growing region in western New York, the second largest onion growing region in the state. Ninety-eight weed species were sampled and 30 had at least one T. tabaci larva. A total of 2, 121 T. tabaci larvae were found on weeds sampled in 2008 and 2009; 17 % of the weed species were members of Asteraceae and 20 % were in the Brassicaceae. Most of the larvae (90 %) were found on species of these two families. Because IYSV is thought to be non-transmissible by seed, winterannual, biennial and perennial weed species have the ability to act as overwintering reservoirs for IYSV in onion cropping systems. Thus, these types of weed species may likely be the most important sources for this virus. Of the 30 weed species hosting T. tabaci larvae, 25 were winter-annual, biennial and perennial weeds. Of these, only four are confirmed hosts of IYSV: common burdock, Arctium minus, chicory, Cichorium intybus, <b>curly</b> <b>dock,</b> Rumex crispus, and dandelion, Taraxacum officinale. Among these four species, plant densities and populations of T. tabaci larvae were highest on common burdock and dandelion, suggesting that these weed species may have the greatest potential to impact the epidemiology of IYSV in New York onion fields. Densities of T. tabaci larvae were estimated to be 3, 536 and 3, 851 larvae per hectare on common burdock in 2008 and 2009, respectively, whereas densities were estimated to be 4, 720 and 24, 964 larvae per hectare on dandelion in 2008 and 2009, respectively. Larvae were only observed on <b>curly</b> <b>dock</b> in 2008 (3 larvae per hectare) and on chicory in 2009 (143 larvae per hectare). In a separate field survey in the fall of 2009, populations of T. tabaci larvae were highest on common burdock and dandelion plants adjacent to onion fields (0 - 50 m), whereas no larvae were observed on these weed species farther than 5 km from onion fields. Samples of common burdock and dandelion did not test positive for IYSV; however, the relative localization of T. tabaci populations suggests that management of these weed species near onion fields in an effort {{to reduce the number of}} viruliferous T. tabaci that may colonize onion fields warrants further investigation. In addition to IYSV, there are other important viruses of vegetable crops grown in muck soils. Survey results covering the presence of these weed species in the Elba Muck are presented and discussed...|$|E
