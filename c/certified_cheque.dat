50|$|Because of the {{liquidity}} and {{certainty of}} payment of a <b>certified</b> <b>cheque,</b> {{it is sometimes}} considered equivalent to cash, {{such as in the}} regulation of credit for casino gaming in Macau, where the law explicitly states that if a casino patron obtains casino chips and pays with a <b>certified</b> <b>cheque,</b> the transaction is not regarded as credit for gaming (see Law 5/2004, art. 2).|$|E
5000|$|When a <b>certified</b> <b>cheque</b> is drawn, {{the bank}} {{operating}} the account verifies {{there are currently}} sufficient funds in the drawer's account to honour the cheque. Those funds are then set aside in the bank's internal account until the cheque is cashed or returned by the payee. Thus, a <b>certified</b> <b>cheque</b> cannot [...] "bounce", and its liquidity is similar to cash, absent failure of the bank. The bank indicates this fact by making a notation {{on the face of}} the cheque (technically called an acceptance).|$|E
5000|$|A {{certified}} check or <b>certified</b> <b>cheque</b> {{is a form}} of cheque for which the bank verifies that sufficient funds exist in the account to cover the cheque, and so certifies, at the time the cheque is written. Those funds are then set aside in the bank's internal account until the cheque is cashed or returned by the payee. Thus, a <b>certified</b> <b>cheque</b> cannot be stopped (can't [...] "bounce"), and, in this manner, its liquidity is similar to cash, barring bank failure or illegal act (such as the funds being based on a fraudulent loan, at which point the cheque will be disavowed).|$|E
5000|$|As {{inflation}} gathered pace, Banco Central introduced cheques de gerencia (cashier's <b>cheques,</b> <b>certified</b> <b>cheques,</b> bank drafts) for 5000 and 10,000 pesos bolivianos in 1982.|$|R
50|$|Money orders {{have limited}} {{acceptance}} {{in the insurance}} and brokerage industry because of concerns over money laundering. Because of provisions within the USA PATRIOT Act and the Bank Secrecy Act, money orders have far more regulatory processing requirements than personal cheques, cashier's <b>cheques,</b> or <b>certified</b> <b>cheques.</b>|$|R
50|$|In some countries, e.g. Germany, it {{is illegal}} for a regular bank to certify checks. This {{regulation}} is supposed to prevent <b>certified</b> <b>cheques</b> from becoming a universal substitute for cash, which is considered the only legal tender. The Deutsche Bundesbank (Federal Bank) is the only financial institution authorized to issue certified checks.|$|R
50|$|It is {{possible}} to counterfeit or forge a <b>certified</b> <b>cheque,</b> in which case it is not binding on the bank and is worthless. See entry on cashier's check for an exploration of associated risks.|$|E
50|$|Starace's case {{revolved}} around his final in Casablanca against the Spaniard Pablo Andújar, which the Italian lost. Starace had led their head-to-head 5-0 {{going into the}} match. Bookmaker Massimo Erodiani asked via Skype if Starace had received a <b>certified</b> <b>cheque</b> to lose match and received an affirmative answer, explaining that all bets were safe on a Starace loss.|$|E
50|$|For a {{transitional}} period another pictogram, the ec electronic cash pictogram, {{is still to}} be found as an acceptance mark on debit cards issued by the German credit services sector and on POS terminals. This mark was used during the transition from Eurocheque (payment via <b>certified</b> <b>cheque)</b> to payment via ec-card (card based payment with PIN). After {{the abolition of the}} Eurocheque, the allocation of ec-cards by the German credit services sector was suspended and the trademarks for Eurocheque were sold to MasterCard.|$|E
50|$|Insurance is {{restricted}} to registered member institutions, and covers only the first $100,000 in very specific categories of accounts, such as savings accounts and chequing accounts, guaranteed investment certificates (GICs) and other term deposits with an original term to maturity of five years or less, money orders, travellers' cheques and bank drafts issued by CDIC members and <b>cheques</b> <b>certified</b> by CDIC members, and debentures issued by loan companies that are CDIC members. Credit unions and Quebec and New Brunswick's caisses populaires are not insured federally, because they are created under provincial charters and backed by provincial insurance plans, which generally follow the federal model. Deposits in foreign currencies are not insured, even when held by a registered CDIC financial institution. Guaranteed Investment Certificates with a term longer than 5 years are also not insured. Funds in foreign banks operating in Canada are not covered. Some funds in Registered Retirement Savings Plans or Registered Retirement Income Funds at a bank may not be covered if they are invested in mutual funds or held in specific instruments like debentures issued by government or corporations. The general principle is to cover reasonable deposits and savings, but not deposits deliberately positioned to take risks for gain, such as mutual funds or stocks.|$|R
5000|$|A {{money order}} is {{purchased}} {{for the amount}} desired. In this way it {{is similar to a}} <b>certified</b> <b>cheque.</b> The main difference is that money orders are usually limited in maximum face value to some specified figure (for example, the United States Postal Service limits domestic postal money orders to US $1,000.00 [...] ) while certified cheques are not. Money orders typically consist of two portions: the negotiable cheque for remittance to the payee, and a receipt or stub that the customer retains for his/her records. The amount is printed by machine or checkwriter on both portions, and similar documentation, either as a third hard copy or in electronic form and retained at the issuer and agent locations.|$|E
50|$|A {{call for}} tenders was sent out {{requiring}} a deposit of $150,000 which would be lost if the tendered offer was withdrawn. Ron Engineering submitted an offer along with the required deposit {{in the form of}} a <b>certified</b> <b>cheque.</b> The submitted tenders were opened by the owner and Ron Engineering was the low bidder by a substantial margin. It was then discovered that the price on the tender documents was far lower than the price that Ron Engineering had intended to submit, and that they had made a mistake in calculating their total bid price. They informed the owner of the mistake and tried to have the offer changed. The change was refused, the contract was given to another company, and the owner kept Ron Engineering's bid deposit. Ron Engineering sued to get their deposit back. The owner counter-claimed for costs incurred as a result of having to go with a different bidder. At trial the counter-claim was dismissed but it was held that the owner was entitled to keep the deposit. The Ontario Court of Appeal reversed the trial decision and held, relying on the contractual doctrine of mistake, that Ron Engineering was entitled to get its deposit back. The owner appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada.|$|E
40|$|This article {{deals with}} {{three types of}} {{negotiable}} instruments payable on demand which are issued, stamped or signed by banks prior to their collection and payment, and used as mechanisms for the transmission of funds. These instruments are the bank draft, including the bank money order, the <b>certified</b> <b>cheque,</b> and the personal money order. The article {{is concerned with the}} binding effect, or the irrevocability, of the bank 2 ̆ 7 s obligation on these instruments under the law of bills and notes. It concludes that (1) the issuer of the bank draft is liable as a drawer, and under some circumstances, also as a maker or acceptor, that (2) cheque certification amounts to the acceptance of the cheque, and that (3) imprinting the amount on a personal money order ought to be treated like cheque certification. As to all three species, the bank 2 ̆ 7 s obligation is thus irrevocable...|$|E
40|$|A {{bank draft}} or <b>certified</b> <b>cheque</b> (2 ̆ 2 banker 2 ̆ 7 s {{instrument}} 2 ̆ 2) is a negotiable instrument {{on which a}} bank is obligated, used by a paying party in payment to a creditor. The issue explored {{in this article is}} the autonomy of the banker 2 ̆ 7 s obligation on the banker 2 ̆ 7 s instrument, namely whether the payee-creditor may enforce it irrespective of the obligated bank 2 ̆ 7 s defences against the paying party, {{as well as of the}} paying party 2 ̆ 7 s defences against the payee-creditor. From a doctrinal point of view, the questions are whether the payee-creditor can be a holder in due course (so as not to be subject to the obligated bank 2 ̆ 7 s defences against the paying party), and whether jus tertii, that is, a defence based on rights ofa thirdparty (here the payingparty), is available to the obligated bankagainsta holdernot in due course. This article answers thefirst question in the affirmative butprovides only apartly affirmative answer to the second. The conclusion is thus that as a holder in due course the-payee-creditor takes the banker 2 ̆ 7 s instrumentfreefrom the obligated bank 2 ̆ 7 s defences against thepayingparty. At the same time, as a holder notin due course, the payee-creditor holds the instrument subject to the obligated bank 2 ̆ 7 s defences against thepaying party; regardless ofwhether thepayingpartyjoins the action ofthe payee-creditor against the obligated bank, the payee-creditor holds the instrument subject also to thepaying party 2 ̆ 7 s claimfor the specific restitution of the instrument. Contract defences of the paying party against the payeecreditor, other than the retroactive cancellation oftheir contract leading to such a claimfor the restitution ofthe instrument, are not available to theobligated bank against the payee-creditor. Autonomy is thus not entirely achieved...|$|E
