40|$|Introduction: The battery {{charging}} {{performance in a}} stand-alone solar PV system affects the PV system efficiency and the load operating time. The New Energy Center of National Taiwan University {{has been devoted to}} the development of a PWM charging technique to continue charging the lead-acid battery after the overcharge point to increase the battery storage capacity by more than 10 %. The present study intends to use the super-capacitor to further increase the charge capacity before the overcharge point of the battery. The super-capacitor is connected in parallel to the lead-acid battery. This will reduce the overall <b>charging</b> <b>impedance</b> during the charge and increase the charging current, especially in sunny weather. A system dynamics model of the lead-acid battery and super-capacitor was derived and the control system simulation was carried out to predict the charging performance for various weathers. It shows that the overall battery impedance decreases and charging power increases with increasing solar radiation. An outdoor comparative test for two identical PV systems with and without supercapacitor was carried out. The use of super-capacitor is shown to be able to increase the lead-acid charging capacity by more than 25 % at sunny weather and 10 % in cloudy weather. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2011...|$|E

In order to satisfy battery design requirements, a 10 Ahr battery containing two parallel 8 -cell strings was proposed. The proposed battery has a weight and volume of approximately 3. 2 kg and 1. 6 liters, respectively. Cell qualification procedures include initial characterization, followed by charge/discharge cycling at 100 % DOD with intermittent EIS measurements at various state of charge. Certain cells were also subjected to extreme operational temperatures for worst-case analysis. Excellent specific energy (> 130 Whr/kg) was obtained with initial characterization cycles.

40|$|Collective instabilities are an {{important}} consideration in the 2 -GeV rapidly-cycling synchrotron (RCS) of the proposed 1 -MW spallation neutron source upgrade due to the very high beam intensity of 1. 04 {times} 10 {sup 14 } protons per pulse.

The DLi+ values are 3.89 [*]×[*] 10 − 12, 6.99 [*]×[*] 10 − 12, 7.99 [*]×[*] 10 − 11, 4.88 [*]×[*] 10 − 11, 8.43 [*]×[*] 10 − 11  cm 2  s− 1 for Ga- 0, Ga- 0.04, Ga- 0.06, Ga- 0.08, Ga- 0.1, respectively. The difference in the DLi+ between Ga-doped and pristine samples amount to 1 order of magnitude, indicating that Ga doping {{is a good way to}} enhance the ionic conductivity. The lowest <b>charge</b> transfer <b>impedance</b> and the highest diffusion coefficient of Li+ of Ga- 0.06 gave it excellent cycling and rate properties compared to all the samples. The increase of DLi+ can be ascribed to the reduced LixNi 1 -xO impurity phase.

40|$|Interpretation of the {{impedance}} of {{the silicon}} electrolyte interface is particularly complicated under conditions in which anodic silicon dissolution occurs. In the present work the frequency-resolved potential modulated microwave reflectivity (PMMR) technique has been combined with electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) to study the behaviour of low-doped p-type silicon in buffered ammonium fluoride. The EIS response {{is determined by the}} total impedance of the system, whereas the PMMR response originates from modulation of the hole density in the silicon space charge region.

The signals were obtained with a coasting beam directly after multi-turn injection, {{and during the}} adiabatic RF capture. The results show a longitudinal instability at currents a factor 2 - 3 below the transverse space charge limit. The origin of this instability is the shunt impedance of the two cavities and the longitudinal space <b>charge</b> <b>impedance.</b> Together they exceed the impedance threshold for longitudinal beam stability, since no feedback is applied in SIS. The detected longitudinal instabilities have been simulated using a two dimensional particle-in-cell code. The simulation results are in good agreement with the signals and intensity thresholds observed in the experiments. On this basis we have used the simulation code to estimate an upper limit for the cavity shunt impedance of a Heavy-Ion Driven Fusion Ignition Facility (HIDIF), where beam currents up to 70 A are expected. In this regime the beam-cavity interaction is of great importance for the beam stability. Two injection scenarios have been investigated- an adiabatic RF capture process and the multi-turn injection into a barrier bucket. ...|$|R

Results revealed that the impedances of these cells tended to increase with storage time; the magnitude of the impedance rise was dependent primarily on temperature and to a lesser degree on storage mode. Typical values for 50 A-hr cells were usually less than 100 mohm immediately after activation and from 1 to 30 ohm after 6 - 10 months of storage. Transient voltages of these cells droped sharply during the first msec of discharge and then rose to a stablized value during the following few seconds. The magnitude of the initial drop and the stabilized voltage values were found to be related to impedance but not in a linear manner. The magnitude and duration of the low transient voltages may be unacceptable in some applications of these cells.

These interactions also provide {{a rich source of}} dynamic phenomena for analytical, computational, and experimental study.

40|$|One of {{performance}} {{requirements of the}} Spallation Neutron Source (SNS) {{is to keep the}} uncontrolled beam loss in the storage ring to less than 2 x 10 {sup {minus} 4 } per pulse. For 2 MW SNS, the maximum beam intensity is N = 2 x 10 {sup 14 } protons per ring. Since the bunch lengthening has impact on both the extraction beam loss and the lowering of e-p instability threshold, the longitudinal space charge effect requires attentions. Such a space charge effect has been studied both analytically and using computer simulations. The longitudinal space charge effect, which is a defocusing force below transition, is a plausible source of the bunch leakage. In this article, the total RF potential, which takes into account the space charge effect together with the RF power, is used to provide analytical predictions for the bunch lengthening. The prediction is confirmed by the computer simulation. It is found that for 2 MW SNS storage ring, the longitudinal space charge induced bunch leakage into the interbunch gap is not significant. Therefore, corrections to the longitudinal space <b>charge</b> <b>impedance,</b> such as the proposed ferrite insertion in the PSR ring, are probably not necessary.
