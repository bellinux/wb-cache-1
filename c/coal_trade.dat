5|$|Bute died in 1900 and his widow, the Marchioness, {{was given}} a life {{interest}} in Castell Coch; during her mourning, she and her daughter, Lady Margaret Crichton-Stuart, occupied the castle and made occasional visits thereafter. Production in the castle vineyards ceased during the First World War due to the shortages of the sugar needed for the fermentation process, and in 1920 the vineyards were uprooted. John, the 4th Marquess, acquired the castle in 1932 but made little use of it. He also began to reduce the family's investments in South Wales. The <b>coal</b> <b>trade</b> had declined after 1918 and industry had suffered during the depression of the 1920s; by 1938, {{the great majority of}} the family interests, including the coal mines and docks, had been sold off or nationalised.|$|E

5|$|John, {{the fourth}} Marquess, {{acquired}} the castle in 1900 {{on the death}} of his father, and the family estates and investments around the castle began to rapidly reduce in size. Cardiff had grown hugely in the previous century, its population increasing from 1,870 in 1800 to around 250,000 in 1900, but the <b>coal</b> <b>trade</b> began to diminish after 1918 and industry suffered during the depression of the 1920s. John only inherited a part of the Butes' Glamorgan estates, and in {{the first decades of the}} 20th century he sold off much of the remaining assets around Cardiff, including the coal mines, docks and railway companies, with the bulk of the land interests being finally sold off or nationalised in 1938.|$|E
5|$|The canal company carried {{goods in}} their own boats, and {{produced}} {{a report on the}} four years from August 1846 to June 1850 in 1851. This showed an income of £180,746 from tolls, and identified six main types of traffic. These included iron goods from the Wolverhampton area to Liverpool; limestone from Trevor and Crickheath to Nantwich or Wappenshall on the Shrewsbury Canal, with a back trade in iron ore from near Burslem; general merchandise, which was carried between Chester and Liverpool; and general merchandise for Shropshire and North Wales. All of these were profitable. The carriage of general goods from Birmingham to Liverpool and the Chester <b>coal</b> <b>trade</b> both made a small loss.|$|E
25|$|In 1642 the English Civil War began. King Charles {{realised}} {{the value}} of the Tyne <b>coal</b> <b>trade</b> and therefore garrisoned Newcastle. A Royalist was appointed as governor. At that time, Newcastle and King's Lynn were the only important seaports to support the crown. In 1644 Parliament blockaded the Tyne to prevent the king from receiving revenue from the Tyne <b>coal</b> <b>trade.</b> Coal exports fell from 450,000 to 3,000 tons and London suffered a hard winter without fuel. Parliament encouraged the <b>coal</b> <b>trade</b> from the Wear to try to replace that lost from Newcastle but that was not enough {{to make up for the}} lost Tyneside tonnage.|$|E
50|$|Palais Gutmann is a Ringstraßenpalais in Vienna, Austria. It {{was built}} for the <b>coal</b> <b>trading</b> Gutmann family. It was built in 1869-1871. The {{architect}} was Carl Tietz.|$|R

50|$|In 1923, the mine's annual output {{was stated}} by the Colliery Year Book and <b>Coal</b> <b>Trades</b> Directory as being 165,000 tons. In 1933, {{it was given}} by the same source as 260,000 tons.|$|R
25|$|In {{the village}} of Offerton, roughly three miles in land from the area, skirmishes occurred. Parliament also {{blockaded}} the River Tyne, crippling the Newcastle <b>coal</b> <b>trade</b> which allowed the <b>coal</b> <b>trade</b> of the area to flourish for a short period. Because of the difficulty for colliers trying to navigate the shallow waters of the Wear, the coal was loaded onto keels (large boats) and taken downriver to the waiting colliers. The keels were manned by a close-knit group of workers known as 'keelmen'.|$|E
25|$|While she {{operated}} in Australia, the Advance became a well-known schooner, {{employed in the}} coastal <b>coal</b> <b>trade</b> and {{for a number of}} years trading between Sydney and the Northern and Southern collieries.|$|E
25|$|The Civil War {{had allowed}} the River Wear {{to emerge as}} a {{competitor}} of the Tyne for coal exports. By 1660 the Tyne <b>coal</b> <b>trade</b> had recovered but was now only a third greater than the Wearside production. At this time the Newcastle Hostmen clashed with the Sunderland coal traders by claiming their charter rights and imposing a shilling tax on all coals exported from Sunderland. The Newcastle monopoly continued until between 1700 and 1750 the coal production increased {{to such an extent}} that non-Hostmen businessmen were drawn in. This seriously weakened the strength of the Hostmen and they would never again have such a stranglehold on the north-east <b>coal</b> <b>trade.</b>|$|E

25|$|The {{properties}} {{associated with}} the Brogdens in Tondu and Maesteg were purchased by North's Navigation Collieries Ltd in 1889. The new company, initially led by Colonel John T.

25|$|The Merritt Company, {{awarded the}} salvage {{rights to the}} {{battered}} wreck of the Lamington, sold it for 17,500 dollars to C. A. Campbell and Company of Boston, Massachusetts, who planned to use her to work the <b>coal</b> <b>trade.</b> By April 1897, with her home port in Boston and renamed Sterling, she was moving coal along the United States' Atlantic coast, from {{as far south as}} Newport News, Virginia to as far north as Portsmouth, New Hampshire.|$|E
25|$|The North Midland Railway, {{running from}} Leeds to Derby, opened in 1840 and this {{represented}} {{a major threat}} to the domination of the <b>coal</b> <b>trade</b> by all the South Yorkshire navigations. Parts of the railway ran alongside the canal. At Adwick upon Dearne the railway constructed a long cutting, and in order to maintain their alignment, the canal tunnel was demolished and the canal was re-routed to share the new cutting. The canal Company took the opportunity to build interchange facilities with the new railway.|$|E

25|$|Two coal {{companies}} {{accounted for}} the <b>coal</b> <b>trade</b> carried by the railroad. At first competitors, the Rochester and Pittsburgh Coal and Iron Company and the Bell, Lewis, and Yates Coal Mining Company became very good friends when Frederick Bell, George Lewis, and Arthur Yates took seats on the Buffalo, Rochester and Pittsburgh Railway board of directors. In fact, with Iselin's resignation {{as president of the}} railway company, Yates took his place. The two coal companies then negotiated an agreement which eased competitive pressures and allocated access to the railroad's coal-transporting capacity. While Yates concentrated on coal, Merchant ran the railroad.|$|E
25|$|J.J. Smith {{operated}} the Star of Bengal for 7 more years, mainly for grain and <b>coal</b> <b>trade.</b> As the steamships were pushing sailing vessels out of business, the trading company {{could no longer}} operated her for profit, and in 1905, the Star of Bengal was sold to Alaska Packers' Association. This company was in business of canning Alaskan salmon, using its sailing ships for a single voyage a year: a spring sail from San Francisco to one of its Alaskan canneries with seasonal workers and supplies, followed by a return trip in early fall with the workers and a load of canned salmon.|$|E
25|$|By {{the end of}} the 18th century, Whitehaven was {{exporting}} its coal {{mainly to}} Ireland and to replace the tobacco trade Whitehaven turned to importing sugar from Barbados, cotton wool from Antigua and coffee and cocoa from St Lucia. There is little evidence to suggest that Whitehaven was involved in the slave trade. Due to the <b>coal</b> <b>trade</b> Whitehaven was, after London, the second port of England in terms of tonnage of shipping from 1750 to 1772. Even by 1835 Whitehaven was still the fifth placed port with 443 ships registered, but by {{the end of the}} 19th century only 68 vessels were registered.|$|E
