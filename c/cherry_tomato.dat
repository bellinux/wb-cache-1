40|$|AbstractThe aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the effectiveness of ultrasound treatment combined with commercial sanitizers in the decontamination step of minimally processed <b>cherry</b> <b>tomatoes.</b> Previously selected <b>cherry</b> <b>tomatoes</b> were treated with ultrasound (45 kHz) for 10 min in the presence of 20 and 200 mg/L sodium dichloroisocyanurate, 5 % hydrogen peroxide, 10 mg/L chlorine dioxide or 40 mg/L peracetic acid. The reduction of natural contaminant microbiota and inoculated Salmonella adhered to the surface of the tomatoes were evaluated. The aerobic mesophilic contamination on the <b>cherry</b> <b>tomatoes</b> was reduced by 0. 7 – 4. 4 log 10 cfu/g while molds and yeasts were reduced by 1. 1 – 3. 4 log 10 cfu/g after different sanitization treatments. The combined treatment of ultrasound and 40 mg/L peracetic acid resulted in the highest reduction of the natural contaminant population and a reduction of adherent Salmonella Typhimurium ATCC 14028 by 3. 9 log 10 cfu/g. These results indicate the potential of using ultrasound as auxiliary strategy in the sanitization of <b>cherry</b> <b>tomatoes...</b>|$|R

40|$|In Italy {{tomatoes}} {{represent a}} very important segment of the fruit and vegetable production and among the different varieties <b>cherry</b> <b>tomatoes</b> are of increasing economic importance. Nowadays, thanks to the improved agronomic techniques, <b>cherry</b> <b>tomatoes</b> {{can be found on}} the markets throughout the year and consumers are showing an increasing preference for this kind of product. Furthermore, there is also an increasing scientiﬁ c interest for the consumption of tomatoes, due to their content in antioxidants moieties (carotenoids, phenols, ascorbic acid, etc.), among which lycopene is of the utmost importance, also because its anticarcinogenic properties. At present, a signiﬁ cant amount of the Italian production of <b>cherry</b> <b>tomatoes</b> is sold in foreign countries, often quite far away from the production sites; therefore, an adequate shelf-life of the product is needed, in order to reach the markets with no or minimal changes of the organoleptic characteristics. In this work, the inﬂ uence of various commercial types of packaging on the shelf-life of <b>cherry</b> <b>tomatoes</b> was investigated. Shelf-life tests were conducted at 7 ° and 15 °C (90...|$|R
40|$|A multi-spectral {{fluorescence}} imaging technique {{was used to}} detect defective <b>cherry</b> <b>tomatoes.</b> The fluorescence excitation and emission matrix {{was used to measure}} for defects, sound surface and stem areas to determine the optimal fluorescence excitation and emission wavelengths for discrimination. Two-way ANOVA revealed the optimal excitation wavelength for detecting defect areas was 410 nm. Principal component analysis (PCA) was applied to the fluorescence emission spectra of all regions at 410 nm excitation to determine the emission wavelengths for defect detection. The major emission wavelengths were 688 nm and 506 nm for the detection. Fluorescence images combined with the determined emission wavebands demonstrated the feasibility of detecting defective <b>cherry</b> <b>tomatoes</b> with > 98 % accuracy.
