25|$|Lt. Col. Jan Kowalewski (23 October 1892 – 31 October 1965) was a Polish <b>cryptologist,</b> {{intelligence}} officer, engineer, journalist, military commander, and {{creator and}} first {{head of the}} Polish Cipher Bureau. He recruited a large staff of cryptologists who broke Soviet military codes and ciphers during the Polish-Soviet War, enabling Poland to weather the war and achieve victory in the 1920 Battle of Warsaw.|$|E
25|$|Friedman {{retired in}} 1956 and, with his wife, turned his {{attention}} to the problem that had originally brought them together: examining Bacon's supposed codes. Together they wrote a book entitled The <b>Cryptologist</b> Looks at Shakespeare which won a prize from the Folger Library and was published under the title The Shakespearean Ciphers Examined. The book demonstrated flaws in Gallup's work and in that of others who sought hidden ciphers in Shakespeare's work.|$|E
25|$|After {{his return}} in 1953, Twombly {{served in the}} U.S. army as a <b>cryptologist,</b> an {{activity}} that left a distinct mark on his artistic style. From 1955 to 1959, he worked in New York, where he became a prominent figure {{among a group of}} artists including Robert Rauschenberg, with whom he was sharing a studio, and Jasper Johns. Exposure to the emerging New York School purged figurative aspects from his work, encouraging a simplified form of abstraction. He became fascinated with tribal art, using the painterly language of the early 1950s to invoke primitivism, reversing the normal evolution of the New York School. Twombly soon developed a technique of gestural drawing that was characterized by thin white lines on a dark canvas that appear to be scratched onto the surface. His early sculptures, assembled from discarded objects, similarly cast their gaze back to Europe and North Africa. He stopped making sculptures in 1959 and did not take up sculpting again until 1976.|$|E

50|$|When {{the course}} finished, someone {{suggested}} that the novice <b>cryptologists</b> get some practical experience working with the Polish <b>cryptologists</b> in Poland. The Japanese students would go to Poland with their teacher. Arrangements were made and a study-abroad program of sorts was started. Five officers left for Poland with Kowalefsky late in 1924 (Taishō 13). They spent a year working in the Polish Army's Bureau of Ciphers before returning to Japan and taking up positions in the Japanese Army Cipher Department.|$|R
25|$|Before the Polish–Soviet war, Jan Kowalewski, a {{polyglot}} {{and amateur}} <b>cryptologist,</b> managed {{to break the}} codes and ciphers of {{the army of the}} West Ukrainian People's Republic and of General Anton Denikin's White Russian forces during his service in the Polish–Ukrainian War. As a result, in July 1919 he was transferred to Warsaw, where he became chief of the Polish General Staff's radio-intelligence department. By early September he had gathered a group of mathematicians from Warsaw University and Lwów University (most notably, founders of the Polish School of Mathematics—Stanisław Leśniewski, Stefan Mazurkiewicz and Wacław Sierpiński), who succeeded in breaking Soviet Russian ciphers as well. Decoded information presented to Piłsudski showed that Soviet peace proposals with Poland in 1919 were false and that in reality the Soviets had prepared for a new offensive against Poland and had concentrated military forces in Barysaw near the Polish border. Piłsudski decided to ignore the Soviet proposals, to sign an alliance with Symon Petliura of the Ukrainian People's Republic, and to prepare the Kiev Offensive. During the war, Polish decryption of Red Army radio messages made it possible to use small Polish military forces efficiently against the Soviet Russian forces and to win many individual battles, most importantly the 1920 Battle of Warsaw.|$|E

General Douglas MacArthur {{had been ordered}} to leave the Philippines and re-establish U.S. Army headquarters in Australia, from whence counterattacks might be launched. MacArthur recognized the need for cryptologic support, thus, on 15 April 1942, he established the Central Bureau (CB), cobbling it together from refugee elements of American <b>cryptologists</b> evacuated from the Philippines, Australian <b>cryptologists,</b> and other Allied contingents. CB began in Melbourne, then moved to Brisbane.|$|R
500|$|As {{it became}} clear that war was {{imminent}} and that Polish financial resources were insufficient {{to keep pace with the}} evolution of Enigma encryption (e.g., due to the prohibitive expense of an additional 54 bombas and due to the Poles' difficulty in producing in timely fashion the full 60 series of 26 [...] "Zygalski sheets"), the Polish General Staff and government decided to initiate their Western allies into the secrets of Enigma decryption. The Polish methods were revealed to French and British intelligence representatives in a meeting at Pyry, south of Warsaw, on 25 July 1939. France was represented by Gustave Bertrand and Air Force <b>cryptologist</b> Captain Henri Braquenié; Britain, by Government Code and Cypher School chief Alastair Denniston, veteran <b>cryptologist</b> Alfred Dillwyn Knox, and Commander Humphrey Sandwith, head of the section that had developed and controlled the Royal Navy's intercept and direction-finding stations. The Polish hosts included Cipher Bureau chief Gwido Langer, the Bureau's German-Section chief Maksymilian Ciężki, the Bureau's General-Staff-Intelligence supervisor Stefan Mayer, and the three cryptologists Rejewski, Różycki and Zygalski.|$|E
500|$|In 1929, {{while the}} Cipher Bureau's {{predecessor}} agency was still headed by Major Franciszek Pokorny (a {{relative of the}} outstanding World War I Austro-Hungarian Army <b>cryptologist,</b> Captain Herman Pokorny), Ciężki, Franciszek Pokorny, and a civilian Bureau associate, Antoni Palluth, taught a secret cryptology course at Poznań University for selected mathematics students. [...] Over ten years later, during World War II while in France, one of the students, Marian Rejewski, would discover that the entire course had been taught from French General Marcel Givièrge's book, Cours de cryptographie (Course of Cryptography), published in 1925.|$|E
500|$|Marian Adam Rejewski ( [...] 16 August 1905 – 13 February 1980) was a Polish {{mathematician}} and <b>cryptologist</b> who reconstructed the Nazi German military Enigma {{cipher machine}} sight-unseen in 1932. [...] The cryptologic achievements of Rejewski and colleagues Jerzy Różycki and Henryk Zygalski enabled the British to begin reading German Enigma-encrypted messages {{at the start}} of World War II, seven years after Rejewski's original reconstruction of the machine. The intelligence that was gained by the British from Enigma decrypts formed part of what was code-named Ultra and contributed—perhaps decisively—to the defeat of Germany.|$|E
5000|$|Prior to the machine's production, it {{had never}} been {{subjected}} to rigorous decryption attempts. Now it was decided to remedy this oversight. In early July 1941, Polish <b>cryptologists</b> Marian Rejewski and Henryk Zygalski received LCD-enciphered messages that had earlier been transmitted to the staff of the Polish Commander-in-Chief, based in London. Breaking the first message, given to the two <b>cryptologists</b> on July 3, took them only a couple of hours. Further tests yielded similar results.

500|$|US {{district}} court judge for the District of Columbia, Richard Leon, declared on December 16, 2013 that the mass collection of metadata of Americans' telephone records by the National Security Agency probably violates the fourth amendment prohibition of unreasonable searches and seizures. Leon granted the request for a preliminary injunction that blocks the collection of phone data for two private plaintiffs (Larry Klayman, a conservative lawyer, and Charles Strange, father of a <b>cryptologist</b> killed in Afghanistan when his helicopter was shot down in 2011) and ordered the government to destroy any of their records that have been gathered. But the judge stayed action on his ruling pending a government appeal, recognizing in his 68-page opinion the [...] "significant national security interests at stake {{in this case and}} the novelty of the constitutional issues." ...|$|E
500|$|Rejewski and Zygalski were {{inducted}} as privates {{into the}} Polish Armed Forces on 16 August 1943 and were posted to a Polish Army facility in Boxmoor, cracking German SS and SD hand ciphers. The ciphers were usually {{based on the}} Doppelkassettenverfahren ("double Playfair") system, which the two cryptologists had already worked on in France. British <b>cryptologist</b> Alan Stripp suggests that [...] "Setting them {{to work on the}} Doppelkassetten system was like using racehorses to pull wagons." [...] On 10 October 1943, Rejewski and Zygalski were commissioned second lieutenants; on 1 January 1945 Rejewski, and presumably also Zygalski, were promoted to lieutenant. When Gustave Bertrand fled to England in June 1944, {{he and his wife were}} provided with a house in Boxmoor, a short walk from the Polish radio station and cryptology office, where it seems likely that his collaboration with Rejewski and Zygalski continued.|$|E
