25|$|In 1908, {{not long}} after Dost settled in Port Hedland, storekeepers at Marble Bar began {{arranging}} contracts {{with some of the}} camel operators to have their goods transported from the Port Hedland wharves. <b>Contract</b> <b>rates</b> were lower than the established going rates. Tensions flared. Non contractors refused to cart for the storekeepers and went “on strike” rallying against “non-union” rates. Two hundred and fifty camels at 32 Mile Well were unhobbled and scattered into the scrub. Camel loads were flung to the ground. The dispute was eventually settled after police and officials from both Perth and the local area intervened and facilitated discussions between the opposing parties. Troubles resurfaced periodically - three years later agreement was reached to almost double cartage rates, but it had been a period of financial stress to the cameleers.|$|E

40|$|The {{supply of}} {{and demand for}} {{residential}} mortgages {{has been the subject}} of much discussion in the literature. Many of these studies have used single equation, partial adjustment models with the price specified as the <b>contract</b> <b>rate.</b> In this study, two of the assumptions that underlie these previous studies are tested empirically. First, the proper specification of the price of mortgage funds is tested by using both the <b>contract</b> <b>rate</b> alone and all of the terms of the mortgage as the price. Second, the speed of adjustment in the mortgage market is examined by estimating the model in both the instantaneous adjustment and partial adjustment forms. Both of these tests are carried out using a simultaneous equation rather than a single equation model. The empirical results indicate that the <b>contract</b> <b>rate</b> along with the loan initiation fees, the loan-to-value ratio and the maturity is the better specification of price and that the partial adjustment model performs better than the instantaneous model in the mortgage market.

50|$|In Morgan Stanley Capital Group, Inc. v. Public Utility District No. 1 of Snohomish County (2008), the Supreme Court {{determined}} that the Mobile-Sierra doctrine also applied when {{the burden of the}} improvident contract was on the purchaser.

50|$|Secondly, the FPA {{also allows}} the FPC {{to set aside}} a {{contract}} upon a determination that the rate is unlawful. The parties during the FPC proceeding had stipulated that a reasonable or fair rate of return (ROR) for PG&E was 5.5%, and that the <b>contract</b> <b>rate</b> provided a ROR of 2.6% while the new filed rate schedule provided a ROR of 4.75%, which was the lowest that PG&E stated it would accept. The FPC had in its order found that the 1948 <b>contract</b> <b>rate</b> to be unreasonably low and unlawful because of its low ROR. The Supreme Court, however, noted that while a regulatory agency such as the FPC may not normally impose upon a public utility a ROR that {{is less than the}} fair ROR, it did not follow that the public utility may not itself agree by contract to a ROR that is less than the fair ROR, or that if it does so, that it is entitled to regulatory relief of its improvident bargain. Under the FPA, the proper standard for determining whether a <b>contract</b> <b>rate</b> is unlawful is whether the rate is so low as to adversely affect the public interest, such as having been unduly discriminatory to third parties, excessively burdensome to consumers, or a threat to continued service to the utility company.|$|R
5000|$|The Staggers Act {{followed}} the Railroad Revitalization and Regulatory Reform Act of 1976 (often called the [...] "4R Act"), which reduced federal regulation of railroads and authorized implementation details for Conrail, the new northeastern railroad system. The 4R reforms included allowance {{of a greater}} range for railroad pricing without close regulatory restraint, greater independence from collective rate making procedures in rail pricing and service offers, <b>contract</b> <b>rates,</b> and, to a lesser extent, greater freedom for entry into and exit from rail markets.|$|E
50|$|The lender had a condictio {{action for}} the value of the thing if a similar thing was not {{returned}} as described. It was stricti iuris ("strict law") - the lender could not claim interest. Despite this, it became the standard arrangement for moneylenders in the Roman republic. Interest would instead have to be given in a stipulatio, an additional <b>contract.</b> <b>Rates</b> of interest were heavily regulated by the state. As a mutuum did not place on the borrower any specific date on which to return the equivalent thing, this would also be given in a stipulatio if required. In the later law, the stipulatio replaced mutuum completely.|$|E
5000|$|Ocean {{transportation}} was {{the last}} to be addressed. This was done in two acts, the Ocean Shipping Act of 1984 and the Ocean Shipping Reform Act of 1998. These acts were less thoroughgoing than the legislation dealing with U.S. domestic transportation, in that they left in place the [...] "conference" [...] system in international ocean liner shipping, which historically embodied cartel mechanisms. However, these acts permitted independent rate making by conference participants, and the 1998 Act permitted secret <b>contract</b> <b>rates,</b> which tend to undercut collective carrier pricing. According to the United States Federal Maritime Commission, in an assessment in 2001, this appears to have opened up substantial competitive activity in ocean shipping, with beneficial economic results.|$|E

50|$|In other words, {{a forward}} rate {{agreement}} (FRA) is a tailor-made, over-the-counter financial futures contract on short-term deposits. A FRA transaction is a contract between two parties to exchange payments on a deposit, called the Notional amount, {{to be determined}} {{on the basis of}} a short-term interest rate,referred to as the Reference rate, over a predetermined time period at a future date. FRA transactions are entered as a hedge against interest rate changes. The buyer of the contract locks in the interest rate in an effort to protect against an interest rate increase, while the seller protects against a possible interest rate decline. At maturity, no funds exchange hands; rather, thedifference between the <b>contracted</b> interest <b>rate</b> and the market rate is exchanged. The buyer of the contract is paid if the reference rate is above the <b>contracted</b> <b>rate,</b> and the buyer pays to the seller if the reference rate is below the <b>contracted</b> <b>rate.</b> A company that seeks to hedge against a possible increase in interest rates would purchase FRAs, whereas a company that seeks an interest hedge against a possible decline of the rates would sell FRAs.|$|R

50|$|Consolidators, customs brokers, freight forwarders, and NVOCC’s can be {{a factor}} in {{determining}} freight rate because of their experience, business relationships, and the volume at which they operate. These factors help keep the freight rate down for small businesses and the individual with a shipping need. In the commercial trucking industry, many shippers tender loads to freight brokers {{whose job it is to}} find qualified carriers to move the freight at an acceptable price for all parties. Brokers have access to a suite of technological tools to help determine the most cost-effective way to move cargo, including access to load boards. The best load boards provide rate analysis tools based on actual transactions on every lane in North America, since their databases hold a wealth of pricing information. For example, DAT Solutions offers RateView for carriers, brokers and shippers, providing access to shippers’ <b>contract</b> <b>rates</b> and spot market (broker buy) rates. This allows brokers to analyze market demand and capacity to assure competitive pricing.|$|E
5000|$|The United Gas Pipe Line Co., {{a natural}} gas {{pipeline}} company that operated {{in several states}} and was subject to regulation under the NGA, provided gas under long term contracts to distribution companies such as the Texas Gas Transportation Corp., Southern Natural Gas Co., and the Mississippi Valley Gas Co. The Memphis Light, Gas, and Water Division (MLGW), a distribution system in Memphis, Tennessee, purchased gas from Texas Gas under a contract in which MLGW was required to reimburse Texas Gas for any increases {{in the cost of}} gas provided by United Gas. Each of these contracts had a clause which specified that the rate for the gas was that on the United Gas rate schedule on file with the FPC or any effective rate schedule. On September 30, 1955, United Gas filed a new rate schedule with the FPC which proposed to increase the <b>contract</b> <b>rates.</b> The FPC suspended the rates as provided in the NGA and initiated an administrative proceeding to determine the lawfulness of the new rate schedule. The distribution companies and MLG&W intervened in the proceeding. After the Supreme Court issued its Mobile Gas decision which held that the unilateral filing of a new rate schedule could not abrogate a gas contract with a specified rate on February 27, 1956, the distribution companies and MLGW moved to dismiss the new rate schedule. The FPC upheld the new rate schedule on the basis that the distribution companies had contracted to essentially pay the [...] "going" [...] rate on the effective United Gas rate schedule, and distinguished Mobile Gas as applying to gas contracts with a fixed rate.|$|E

5000|$|Scope of the {{concession}} and regulatory framework of railway activity. Sitarail is technically and financially responsible for (a) {{the operation of}} freight and passenger services, including all equipment maintenance; (b) the maintenance of rail infrastructure and, in part, the renewal and adaptation of infrastructure; and (c) the current management {{of the real estate}} belonging to the railway domain.While rail transport is still qualified in {{the concession}} agreement as a [...] "public service activity," [...] the concession agreement makes a clear distinction between commercial services and services operated under a Public Service Obligation (PSO) scheme.For commercial freight and passenger services, Sitarail has the freedom to set service configuration and tariffs, in accordance with profitability criteria set by Sitarail. The concessionaire is simply required to keep the governments informed of the criteria used for selecting services operated commercially. Tariffs freely set and revised by Sitarail are applicable one month after their communication, for information, to the governments, and fifteen days after they are publicized. Special <b>contract</b> <b>rates</b> may be negotiated with shippers; these rates are not publicized.Services operated under a specific PSO scheme can be run at the request of one or both national governments, or at the request of local governments under special contracts between the authority requesting the service and Sitarail. Contracts have to specify the characteristics of the service and the modalities of the financial compensation paid to Sitarail. Presently, no service is operated under a PSO scheme.The concession agreement reserves the governments’ right to grant access to rail infrastructure to [...] "third party" [...] operators after a seven-year exclusivity period. Third-party operators would then pay an infrastructure access fee, to be negotiated between Sitarail and the operator (or to be decided through arbitration, if the parties cannot agree on the fee).The concessionaire is subject to the tax regime applicable to private enterprises. However, for petroleum products used in locomotives, Sitarail is exempt from the fraction of the petroleum taxes levied by the governments for road user charges.|$|E
40|$|Lenders use {{discount}} {{points to}} vary effective yields from stated <b>contract</b> <b>rates.</b> In the past, this practice resulted from interest-rate regulation. In market, however, {{there seems to}} be an absence of economic rationale as to how points are applied in individual cases. This paper provides an economic rationale for the use of points. An option pricing model is used to derive some basic rules for determining the relationship between changes in the contract rate and the payment of points. This explains current practices by lenders in that the option value effect could justify a reduction in the contract rate of well over one-eighth of a percent and shows that lenders are justified in varying the size of the trade-off between points and <b>contract</b> <b>rates</b> based on risk of prepayment. Lenders must charge a premium for providing the prepayment option; however, the payment of points provides a means whereby this call provision can be retained but reduced in value to suit the preferences of individual borrowers. ...|$|E
