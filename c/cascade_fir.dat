Using USFS Forest Inventory & Analysis (FIA) plots at a density of one every 5. 47 km (3. 4 miles) across California allowed for the first stand-level analysis of the entire red fir distribution zone in California. The results show that mortality is increasing in red fir, which suggests that at least a short term decline is occurring. The rate at which mortality is increasing varies, depending on which analysis approach is used and decreases if recently burned plots are removed from the analysis. At the individual tree level, red fir mortality (all size classes) is occurring at an annual rate of 2. 64 %. Red fir dwarf mistletoe is the most significant factor in red fir mortality and decline based on our field observations and statistical analysis. There is a clear visual and statistical difference in forest health between areas that possess red fir dwarf mistletoe and those that don't. This remains true even when stands are heavily stocked and Annosus root disease is present, suggesting that Annosus root disease (which is common throughout the red fir distribution range) is greatly exacerbated by the presence of red fir dwarf mistletoe. Cytospora canker is associated with red fir dwarf mistletoe, and is likely a significant reason why the red fir dwarf mistletoe impacts red fir forest health so significantly. The only variation in spatial pattern of red fir mortality in California is an area of very low red fir mortality around Mt. Shasta (where red fir dwarf mistletoes does not occur). There was not a consistent correlation between red fir mortality and drought stress. The amount of fir engraver activity in California is not well characterized making it difficult to assess its' role in red fir mortality...|$|R
40|$|This thesis has two parts. In both parts we use {{nonlinear}} approximations {{to obtain}} accurate {{solutions to problems}} where traditional numerical approaches rapidly become computationally infeasible. The first part describes a systematic method for designing highly accurate and efficient infinite impulse response (IIR) and finite impulse response (FIR) filters given their specifications. In our approach, we first meet the specifications by constructing an IIR filter, without requiring the filter to be causal, and possibly {{with a large number}} of poles. We then construct, for any given accuracy, an optimal IIR version of such filter. Finally, also for any given accuracy, we convert the IIR filter to an efficient <b>FIR</b> filter <b>cascade.</b> In this <b>FIR</b> approximation, the non-causal part of the IIR filter only introduces an additional delay. Because our IIR construction does not have to enforce causality, the filters we design are more efficient than filters designed by existing methods. The second part describes a fast algorithm to propagate, for any desired accuracy, a time-harmonic electromagnetic field between two planes separated by free space. The analytic formulation of this problem (circa 1897) requires the evaluation of the Rayleigh-Sommerfeld integral. If the distance between the planes is small, this integral can be accurately evaluated in the Fourier domain; if the distance is large, it can be accurately approximated by asymptotic methods. The computational difficulties arise in the intermediate region where, in order to obtain an accurate solution, it is necessary to apply the oscillatory Rayleigh-Sommerfeld kernel as is. In our approach, we accurately approximate the kernel by a short sum of Gaussians with complex exponents and then efficiently apply the result to input data using the unequally spaced fast Fourier transform. The resulting algorithm has the same computational complexity as methods based on the Fresnel approximation. We demonstrate that while the Fresnel approximation may provide adequate accuracy near the optical axis, the accuracy deteriorates significantly away from the optical axis. In contrast, our method maintains controlled accuracy throughout the entire computational domain...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 2009 Two forest {{management}} objectives being debated {{in the context}} of federally managed landscapes in the US Pacific Northwest involve a perceived trade-off between fire restoration and C sequestration. The former strategy would reduce fuel (and therefore C) that has accumulated through a century of fire suppression and exclusion that has led to extreme fire risk in some areas. The latter strategy would manage forests for enhanced C sequestration as a method of reducing atmospheric CO 2 and associated threats from global climate change. We explored the tradeoff between these strategies by modeling their effects at both the stand and landscape-scale. We began with an assessment {{of the extent to which}} uncertainties in model parameter values, model structure, and field measurements can influence model performance. We adapted the generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation (GLUE) methodology for Biome-BGC, a widely used terrestrial ecosystem model. We found that the phenomenon of parameter equifinality exerted significant control on model performance, but that issues with model structure in the Biome-BGC model may present an even greater obstacle to model accuracy. We then examined the effects of fuel reduction on fire severity and the resulting long-term stand-level C storage by utilizing the STANDCARB model for three Pacific Northwest ecosystems: the east Cascades Ponderosa Pine forests, the west <b>Cascades</b> Western hemlock–Douglas <b>fir</b> forests, and the Coast Range Western hemlock– Sitka spruce forests. Finally, we then tested the extent to which various landscape-level fuel reduction treatments, when applied at various annual treatment areas, altered pyrogenic C emissions and long-term C storage in the east Cascades Ponderosa pine ecosystems. For this we employed the LANDCARB model, which models forests throughout a landscape on a stand-by-stand basis. Results from both the stand and landscape-level modeling indicate that, for fuel reduction treatments to be effective in reducing wildfire severity, they must be applied at higher frequencies and over larger areas than they are currently. Furthermore, fuel reduction treatments almost always reduce stand and landscape-level C storage, since reducing the fraction by which C is lost in a wildfire requires the removal of a much greater amount of C, since most of the C stored in forest biomass (stem wood, branches, coarse woody debris) remains unconsumed even by high-severity wildfires...|$|R
40|$|DoctorAs the multi-functional {{communication}} systems are developed, mobile terminals should be operated at multi-band multi-mode {{to handle the}} various systems. The software defined radio (SDR) system is introduced as an ultimate goal of multi-mode multi-band receiver systems. However, the technical limits in SDR system prevent the existence. A digital RF sampling receiver is suggested as a middle stage technique for the SDR. To satisfy the global communication market demands, highly integrated digital RF systems are being developed very rapidly. In this thesis, the simple architecture and concept of the digital RF receiver are introduced with comparison of the existing receiver systems. An approach to map the Bluetooth (BT) and mobile-WiMAX (WiBro) standards specifications into the architecture and specifications for {{the building blocks of}} a digital RF receiver are proposed. The design procedure focuses on optimization of the performance in each standard while attaining an efficient shared RF front-end solutions. Especially, analysis for two key building blocks for the digital RF receiver system is presented and applied in the designed building blocks. The proposed receiver design is verified through each circuit and a fully integrated implementation using IBM 130 -nm and Samsung 65 -nm CMOS technology. Firstly, architecture of the digital RF receiver systems are introduced and compared with other receiver systems. It is shown that the digital RF receiver architecture is suitable for the next generation system because of its reliability and digital tunability. Among various applications, we choose BT for narrowband characteristics and WiBro for its popularity and inherent wideband characteristics. Therefore architecture and system considerations of digital RF receiver are introduced. This thesis presents circuit designs, including RF front-end and baseband circuits, for BT and WiBro applications. The wideband low noise amplifier (LNA) is designed to cover poor linearity and noise figure and achieves 4 dBm IIP 3 and under 3. 8 dB noise figure in 0. 7 - 3. 5 GHz. The blocker filtering LNA is designed to remove the SAW filter in BT standard and achieves 1. 46 dBm IIP 3, 1. 85 dB noise figure, - 8. 2 dBm P 1 dB and - 13 dBc attenuation level at sideband. The charge-domain passive mixer (CDPM) with a trans-conductance amplifier (TA) block is designed to mitigate the critical flicker noise problem that is frequently encountered the direct conversion receivers and achieves a low flicker noise with corner frequency of under 100 kHz, 8. 1 dB noise figure, 10. 6 dB conversion gain, 2. 5 dBm IIP 3, and - 5. 7 dBm P 1 dB with 2. 4 GHz LO driving at 5 dBm. In the baseband region, DC offset is resolved via feedback loop with resistors and capacitors at variable gain amplifier block and the filtering requirements for both applications are achieved by the proposed discrete-time (DT) filters with non-decimation filters and an anti-aliasing filter. This thesis also presents analysis of the performance of a charge-domain passive mixer with a capacitive load. We analyze performance of the mixer in terms of conversion gain and the 1 dB compression point and show the accuracy of our analysis by comparing with simulated results for a 130 -nm technology based mixer design. The load capacitance influences the conversion gain of the mixer, and the bias voltage affects it linearly. The results provide a theoretical basis for CDPM in the digital RF receiver. Finally, a new FIR filter has been developed to realize a DT filter for wideband signal processing, and compared the conventional FIR filter and proposed FIR filter for filtering characteristic with numerical expressions. The filter maintains the moving average effect, but the decimation function is removed to realize a cascadable filter. The design is fabricated with a 65 -nm CMOS process. By <b>cascading</b> the proposed <b>FIR</b> filter with a conventional FIR filter, about - 60 dB attenuation across 50 MHz signal bandwidth is possible at the sampling rate of 600 Ms/s, and the noise generated by adding the proposed FIR filter is negligible. By the cascade more stages, the bandwidth can be even wider. This bandwidth is wide enough to process the signals of the next generation systems, opening up the possibility to realize a wide sampling receiver, which was not possible so for...|$|R
