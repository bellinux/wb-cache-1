40|$|The active vitamin D {{metabolite}} 1 α, 25 -dihydroxyvitamin D 3 [1 α, 25 (OH) 2 D 3] has wide but {{not fully}} understood antitumor activity. A previous transcriptomic analysis of 1 α, 25 (OH) 2 D 3 action on human colon cancer cells revealed cystatin D (<b>CST</b> <b>5),</b> which encodes an inhibitor of several cysteine proteases of the cathepsin family, {{as a candidate}} target gene. Here we report that 1 α, 25 (OH) 2 D 3 induced vitamin D receptor (VDR) binding to, and activation of, the <b>CST</b> <b>5</b> promoter and increased <b>CST</b> <b>5</b> RNA and protein levels in human colon cancer cells. In cells lacking endogenous cystatin D, ectopic cystatin D expression inhibited both proliferation in vitro and xenograft tumor growth in vivo. Furthermore, cystatin D inhibited migration and anchorage-independent growth, antagonized the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, and repressed c-MYC expression. Cystatin D repressed expression of the epithelial-mesenchymal transition inducers SNAI 1, SNAI 2, ZEB 1, and ZEB 2 and, conversely, induced E-cadherin and other adhesion proteins. <b>CST</b> <b>5</b> knockdown using shRNA abrogated the antiproliferative effect of 1 α, 25 (OH) 2 D 3, attenuated E-cadherin expression, and increased c-MYC expression.

Thus, the fungal lineage has restructured specific scaffolding modules to coordinate the proteins required to direct the gene expression, polarity, and cell cycle regulation essential for mating. IMPORTANCE The mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase cascade is an extensively used signaling module in eukaryotic cells, and the ability to regulate these modules is critical for ensuring proper responses to a wide variety of stimuli. One way that cells regulate this signaling module is through scaffold proteins that insulate related pathways against cross talk, improve signaling efficiency, and ensure that signals are connected to the correct response. The Ste 5 scaffold of the S. cerevisiae mating response is a well-studied representative of this class of proteins. Using bioinformatics, structural modeling, and molecular genetic approaches, we have investigated the equivalent scaffold in the pathogenic yeast Candida albicans. We show that the C. albicans protein is structurally distinct from that of Saccharomyces cerevisiae but still provides similar functions. Increases in pathway complexity have been associated with changes in scaffold connectivity, and overall, the tethering capacity of the scaffolds has been more conserved than their structural organization.

40|$|Resumen del trabajo presentado al " 6 th International EMT Meeting: Symposium VI. Cancer and EMT I" celebrado en Alicante (España) del 13 al 16 de noviembre de 2013. The active vitamin D {{metabolite}} 1 alpha, 25 -dihydroxyvitamin D 3 (calcitriol, 1, 25 (OH) 2 D 3) is a pleiotropic secosteroid hormone {{with wide}} regulatory actions. 1, 25 (OH) 2 D 3 acts via the vitamin D receptor (VDR), {{a member of}} the superfamily of nuclear receptors, which binds specific DNA sequences in its target genes and modulates their transcription rate. Additionally, 1, 25 (OH) 2 D 3 activates rapid, non-genomic signaling pathways. We have reported that 1, 25 (OH) 2 D 3 inhibits proliferation and induces differentiation of human colon carcinoma cells via the control of a high number of genes and the antagonism of the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway (Pálmer et al., J. Cell Biol., 2001; Cancer Res., 2003). 1, 25 (OH) 2 D 3 increases the expression of CDH 1 /E-cadherin RNA and protein through the activation of a rapid non-genomic pathway (Ca 2 +-RhoA-ROCK-MSK 1) and the subsequent increase in transcription (Ordóñez-Morán et al., J. Cell Biol., 2008). Additionally, it induces other proteins involved in epithelial adhesion structures such as the tight junctions components claudin- 7, occludin and ZO- 1. These effects are partially mediated by the induction of <b>CST</b> <b>5</b> /cystatin D, a protease inhibitor that regulates gene expression within the cell nucleus, and KDM 6 B/JMJD 3 histone H 3 lysine 27 demethylase, and by the repression of SPROUTY- 2, a modulator of tyrosine kinase receptor signalling (Alvarez-Díaz et al., J. Clin. Invest., 2009; Barbáchano et al., Oncogene, 2010; Pereira et al., Human Mol. Genet., 2011). In addition, <b>CST</b> <b>5</b> /cystatin D and KDM 6 B/JMJD 3 downregulate SNAI 1, SNAI 2, ZEB 1 and ZEB 2 genes. Moreover, SPROUTY- 2 represses miR- 200 b/c leading to ZEB 1 upregulation, and also several adhesion and polarity genes and ESRP 1, an inhibitor of EMT. Remarkably, a reciprocal inhibitory loop exists between 1, 25 (OH) 2 D 3 and EMT, as SNAIL 1 and SNAIL 2 /SLUG repress VDR expression (Pálmer et al., Nat. Med., 2004; Larriba et al., Carcinogenesis, 2009). Altogether, our results show that 1, 25 (OH) 2 D 3 represses EMT in human colon carcinoma cells through several mechanisms that affect the expression of EMT regulators and of epithelial adhesion and polarity genes. Conversely, the EMT inducers SNAIL 1 / 2 inactivate the vitamin D system via VDR downregulation. Peer Reviewe...|$|E

Three groups of isolated perfused hearts from adult Wistar rats underwent 30 -min ischemia and 120 -min reperfusion (I/R, Group 1), or were post-conditioned by brief ischemic episodes (PostC, 5 -cycles of 10 -s I/R at the beginning of 120 -min reperfusion, Group 2), or with exogenous CST (75  nM for 20  min, CST-Post, Group- 3) at the onset of reperfusion. Perfusion pressure and left ventricular pressure (LVP) were monitored. Infarct size was evaluated with nitroblue-tetrazolium staining. The <b>CST</b> (<b>5</b>  nM) effects were also tested in simulated ischemia/reperfusion experiments on cardiomyocytes isolated from young-adult rats, evaluating cell survival with propidium iodide labeling. Infarct size was 61  ±  6 % of risk area in hearts subjected to I/R only. PostC reduced infarct size to 34  ±  5 %. Infarct size in CST-Post was 36  ±  3 % of risk area (P <  0. 05 respect to I/R). CST-Post reduced post-ischemic rise of diastolic LVP, an index of contracture, and significantly improved post-ischemic recovery of developed LVP. In isolated cardiomyocytes, CST increased the cell viability rate by about 65 % after simulated ischemia/reperfusion. These results suggest a novel cardioprotective role for CST, which appears mainly due to a direct reduction of post-ischemic myocardial damages and dysfunction, rather than to an involvement of adrenergic terminals and/or endothelium...|$|E
40|$|Statins, the 3 -hydroxy- 3 -methyl-glutaryl (HMG) -CoA reductase inhibitors, {{are widely}} {{prescribed}} {{for treatment of}} hypercholesterolemia. Although statins are generally well tolerated, up to ten percent of statin-treated patients experience myalgia symptoms, defined as muscle pain without elevated creatinine phosphokinase (CPK) levels. Myalgia is the most frequent reason for discontinuation of statin therapy. The mechanisms underlying statin myalgia are not clearly understood. To elucidate changes in gene expression associated with statin myalgia, we compared profiles of gene expression in skeletal muscle biopsies from patients with statin myalgia who were undergoing statin re-challenge (cases) versus those of statin-tolerant controls. A robust separation of case and control cohorts was revealed by Principal Component Analysis of differentially expressed genes (DEGs). To identify putative gene expression and metabolic pathways that may be perturbed in skeletal muscles of patients with statin myalgia, we subjected DEGs to Ingenuity Pathways (IPA) and DAVID (Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery) analyses. The most prominent pathways altered by statins included cellular stress, apoptosis, cell senescence and DNA repair (TP 53, BARD 1, Mre 11 and RAD 51); activation of pro-inflammatory immune response (CXCL 12, <b>CST</b> <b>5,</b> POU 2 F 1); protein catabolism, cholesterol biosynthesis, protein prenylation and RAS-GTPase activation (FDFT 1, LSS, TP 53, UBD, ATF 2, H-ras). Based on these data we tentatively conclude that persistent myalgia in response to statins may emanate from cellular stress underpinned by mechanisms of post-inflammatory repair and regeneration. We also posit that this subset of individuals is genetically predisposed to eliciting altered statin metabolism and/or increased end-organ susceptibility that lead {{to a range of}} statin-induced myopathies. This mechanistic scenario is further bolstered by the discovery that a number of single nucleotide polymorphisms (e. g., SLCO 1 B 1, SLCO 2 B 1 and RYR 2) associated with statin myalgia and myositis were observed with increased frequency among patients with statin myalgia...|$|E
40|$|Many studies {{support a}} {{protective}} action of vitamin D against colon cancer. 1 α, 25 -Dihydroxyvitamin D 3 (1, 25 (OH) 2 D 3) exerts wide gene regulatory effects in human colon cancer cells. We previously reported that 1, 25 (OH) 2 D 3 increases cytosolic Ca 2 + concentration and transiently activates RhoA and its effector the Rho-associated coiled-kinase (ROCK), and later p 38 MAPK-MSK. We {{found that the}} inhibition of ROCK signaling by Y 27632 or that of MSK by Ro 318220 prevent the formation of epithelioid islands of SW 480 -ADH cells by 1, 25 (OH) 2 D 3 and disrupts the adhesive phenotype of HT 29 cells. ROCK and MSK inhibition also abrogates the induction of 1, 25 (OH) 2 D 3 24 -hydroxylase (CYP 24), E-cadherin, and vinculin and the repression of cyclin D 1 by 1, 25 (OH) 2 D 3. Moreover, 1, 25 (OH) 2 D 3 does not promote the localization of the tight junction protein occludin at the plasma membrane in cells expressing a dominant negative RhoA (N 19 -RhoA). In addition, 1, 25 (OH) 2 D 3 specifically increases {{the level of the}} cysteine protease-inhibitor cystatin D, whereas that of cystatin SN is unaffected. The increase of cystatin D protein caused by 1, 25 (OH) 2 D 3 is abrogated in N 19 -RhoA cells. Thus, activation of the RhoA-ROCK-p 38 MAPK-MSK signaling pathway is essential for the regulation of the phenotype and of the <b>CST</b> <b>5</b> /cystatin D candidate tumor suppressor and other target genes by 1, 25 (OH) 2 D 3 in colon cancer cells. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|We {{investigated}} whether cutaneous {{stimulus threshold}} (CST), as determined using a Neurometer, {{could be used}} for quantitative and differential nerve evaluation of reversible and irreversible nerve block following intrathecal lidocaine administration in rats. Rats with intrathecal catheters were {{randomly assigned to one of}} five groups (saline or 2, 5, 10, or 20 % lidocaine). Prior to and 4 days after drug administration, CST was determined at 5, 250, and 2000 Hz. In the 2 % lidocaine group, CST from end of lidocaine infusion to re-covery from anesthesia was also monitored. Skin-clamp testing and gait observation were performed for comparison with CST findings. Behavioral examinations revealed persis-tent sensory or motor impairment lasting 4 days in groups receiving 5 % lidocaine but not in the saline and 2 % lido-caine groups. With 2 % lidocaine, return to baseline <b>CSTs</b> at <b>5</b> and 250 Hz was delayed compared with thresholds at 2000 Hz. Although <b>CSTs</b> in the <b>5</b> % group at 5 and 250 Hz in-creased significantly, thresholds at 2000 Hz did not differ from those in rats administered saline. CSTs with 10 % lidocaine displayed no differences between frequencies. At each frequency, CSTs for rats with 5 % lidocaine increased in a clearly concentration-dependent manner. These results suggest that CST testing enables evaluation of the different nerve functions for A, A, and C fibers in rats for lidocaine concentrations 5 % and allows quantitative assessment of persistent neurological deficit induced by lidocaine in rats. Current perception threshold (CPT) has recently seen wide use in the evaluation of sensory function in humans with peripheral neuropathy resulting from diabetes mellitus, car-pal tunnel syndrome, or complex regional pain syndrome (Katims et al., 1989; Masson and Boulton, 1991; Suzuki et al., 1995; Dinh et al., 1997).

40|$|Cystatins are {{a family}} of inhibitors of {{cysteine}} peptidases that comprises the salivary cystatins (D and S-type cystatins) and cystatin C. These cystatins are encoded by a multigene family (CST 3, <b>CST</b> <b>5,</b> CST 4, CST 1 and CST 2) organized in tandem in the human genome. Their presence and functional importance in human saliva has been reported, however the distribution of these proteins in other mammals is still unclear. Here, we performed a proteomic analysis of the saliva of several mammals and studied the evolution of this multigene family. The proteomic analysis detected S-type cystatins (S, SA, and SN) in human saliva and cystatin D in rat saliva. The evolutionary analysis showed that the cystatin C encoding gene is present in species of the most representative mammalian groups, i. e. Artiodactyla, Rodentia, Lagomorpha, Carnivora and Primates. On the other hand, D and S-type cystatins are mainly retrieved from Primates, and especially the evolution of S-type cystatins {{seems to be a}} dynamic process as seen in Pongo abelii genome where several copies of CST 1 -like gene (cystatin SN) were found. In Rodents, a group of cystatins previously identified as D and S has also evolved. Despite the high divergence of the amino acid sequence, their position in the phylogenetic tree and their genome organization suggests a common origin with those of the Primates. These results suggest that the D and S type cystatins have emerged before the mammalian radiation and were retained only in Primates and Rodents. Although the mechanisms driving the evolution of cystatins are unknown, {{it seems to be a}} dynamic process with several gene duplications evolving according to the birth-and-death model of evolution. The factors that led to the appearance of a group of saliva-specific cystatins in Primates and its rapid evolution remain undetermined, but may be associated with an adaptive advantage.

40|$|Resumen del trabajo presentado al 15 th International Congress of the ASociación Española de Investigación sobre el CAncer (ASEICA), celebrado en Sevilla del 21 al 23 de octubre de 2015. Colorectal cancer (CRC) {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{frequent}} and mortal neoplasias worldwide. Despite improvements in CRC patient management and treatment in the last twenty years, no satisfactory therapy exists when surgery is not curative. There is thus a clear need for increased prevention, early diagnosis, novel treatments and better knowledge of this disease. The active vitamin D derivative 1 α. 25 -dihydroxyvitamin D 3 (calcitriol or 1, 25 (OH) 2 D 3) is a pleiotropic hormone that, in addition to its classical effects on the regulation of calcium and phosphate homeostasis and bone biology, modulates proliferation, survival, differentiation and metabolism, and potentiates the antitumoral activity of certain chemotherapeutic agents, in a cell-type- and -context-dependent manner in many ce lis in the organism. These effects rely on the activation of vitamin D receptor (VDR), a member of the superfamily of nuclear receptors that regulares the transcription rate of hundreds of human genes. Many epidemiological studies suggest that vitamin D deficiency is associated with increased colorectal cancer risk and mortality. Additionally, high circulating 1, 25 (OH) 2 D 3 levels at diagnosis associate with better outcome in CRC. However, definitive clinical evidence of the protective action of vitamin D awaits for the results of ongoing prospective intervention trials. 1, 25 (OH) 2 D 3 inhibits proliferation and prometes epithelial differentiation of human colon carcinoma ce lis. We have reported that 1, 25 (OH) 2 D 3 induces the expression of the key intercellular adhesion molecule and invasion suppressor E-cadherin and antagonizes the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, whose alteration initiates and fuels colon tumorigenesis. Moreover, we have reported the regulation by 1, 25 (OH) 2 D 3 of several genes that variably affect CRC such as SPROUTY(SPRY- 2, DICKKOPF(DKK) - 1, <b>CST</b> <b>5</b> /Cystatin D or KDM 6 BIJMJD 3. In vivo, 1, 25 (OH) 2 D 3 reduces intestinal tumorigenesis inApcM> mice and in other mouse models of colon cancer. Aiso,VDR deficiency in mice (Ydr'·) provokes colonic hyperplasia and a strong oxidative stress, and we and others have shown that it in creases tumor load in ApcMin mice. We have also shown that SNAI and SNAI 2 genes encoding the epithelial-to-mesenchymal inducers SNAILI and SNAIL 2 /SLUG repress VDR and that an inverse relation between the expression of these genes exist in human colon tumors. Today it is accepted that both tumor stroma and the alteration of tissue stem cells play crucial roles in cancer. Fibroblasts are the major stromal cellular component and u pon activation by the tumor microenvironment contribute to tumorigenesis. Recendy, we have started the study of the action of 1, 25 (OH) 2 D 3 on CRC patient-derived normal and cancer-associated fibroblasts and on normal and cancer stem cells. lnitial data of the effects of 1, 25 (OH) 2 D 3 on these two key tumor compartments will be presented.

40|$|Candida albicans is {{the most}} common human {{pathogenic}} fungus and the main causal agent of superficial and systemic candidiasis. The genetics of this fungus has several unique characteristics. Most notably, C. albicans does not follow the universal genetic code, by translating the CUG codon into serine instead of leucine. Consequently, the use of Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a host for yeast two-hybrid experiments with C. albicans proteins is limited due to erroneous translation caused by theaberrant codon usage of C. albicans. To circumvent the need for heterologous expression and codon optimization of C. albicans genes we aimed to construct a two-hybrid system with C. albicans itselfas the host with components that are compatible for use in this organism. The conceptual basis was taken from the traditional yeast two-hybrid system where an interaction isobserved by the complementation of a transcription factor upon binding of two proteins of interest, each fused with either the DNA-binding (bait) or activation domain (prey) of the transcription factor. This reassembled protein will then activate one or more reporter genes. The technical basis was borrowedfrom the C. albicans one-hybrid system, which makes use of Streptococcus thermophilus lacZ as chromogenic reporter gene and Staphylococcus aureus LexA as DNA-binding protein, both compatible with the alternative codon usage of C. albicans. Other elements in the system, such as the activation domain and the bait and prey promoters, were chosen from different candidates to establish a final optimized configuration. The functionality of this two-hybrid system was shown by successful interactionassays with the C. albicans protein pairs Kis 1 -Snf 4, Ino 4 -Ino 2 and Bcy 1 -Tpk 1. Non-overlapping positive results with the yeast and C. albicans two-hybrid system illustrate that both methods are complementary for interaction studies. To further evaluate the system, all downstream components of the Cek 1 filamentation/mating MAP kinase pathway were cloned in the bait and prey vector and all possible binary interactions were tested. The data confirmed expected interactions but also suggested a rewiring of the pathway concerning the function of scaffold protein <b>Cst</b> <b>5</b> and a physical connection between MAP kinases Cek 2 and Cek 1. One of the advantages of working with a homologous two-hybrid system is that the influence of externalfactors within the cell can be examined. Orf 19. 5219 (Ira 2), the putative inhibitor of the G protein Ras 1 was partially characterized and the downstream effect of an IRA 2 deletion strain was investigated. Induced homodimerization of transcription factor Efg 1 and interaction between Cek 1 and its target transcription factor Cph 1 were observed in the ira 2 /ira 2 strain confirming the role of Ira 2 as an indirect inhibitor of the Cek 1 MAP kinase pathway and the cAMP-PKA pathway. Finally, the two-hybrid strain and bait plasmid were applied to study the transcription activatingabilities of putative C. albicans transcription factors. Just under 200 putative transcription factors were cloned in the bait vector without added nuclear localisation sequence. A number of 65 proteinswere able to activate reporter gene HIS 1 and 74 proteins were positive in a galactosidase assay. For context-dependent activity, the strains were grown in 9 different conditions on selective medium. Several putative transcription factors showed a dynamic activation pattern among different conditions. These results could facilitate the characterization of transcription factors in C. albicans. In conclusion, a Candida specific two-hybrid system was developed, evaluated and applied for the analysis of the Cek 1 signal transduction pathway, the characterization the putative inhibitor of Ras 1 andthe one-hybrid study of transcription activating abilities of putative transcription factors. nrpages: 207 status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Background. Motor {{learning}} principles {{suggest that}} interventions to promote mobility should incorporate goal-directed activities within the specific environmental context to achieve better outcomes. Aims: We aimed {{to determine the}} feasibility, safety and potential benefit of goal-directed, task-specific mobility training for individuals with mid-stage HD. Methods: Thirty individuals were enrolled and randomized into control or intervention group in this blinded, multi-centre trial. Training focused on walking, sit-to-stand and standing, twice a week for 8 weeks at home. Goal attainment scaling was used to individualize and direct the intervention. Time to complete 5 chair sit-to-stand repetitions (<b>5</b> <b>CST)</b> was recorded at each intervention session. Adherence and adverse events were monitored. Adjusted between-group comparisons on standardized outcome measures (blinded) at 8 and 16 weeks informed assessment of benefit. Results: Loss to follow up was minimal (2 participants); adherence in the intervention group was excellent (96. 9 %). Ninety-two percent (92 %) of goals were achieved {{at the end of}} the intervention and 46 % achieved much better than expected outcome; the majority of goals focused on improving walking endurance and confidence. Mean (95 % CI) improvement in <b>5</b> <b>CST</b> in intervention group was 5. 5 sec (2. 2, 8. 9). There was no clear evidence of benefit on standardized outcome measures at 8 - or 16 -week assessments. Conclusions. Most participants exceeded goal expectation with excellence adherence. While the programme was well received by people with HD and facilitated achievement of personal mobility goals, training intensity and specificity was likely insufficient to achieve systematic improvements in standardized outcome measures...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} verify the results from {{simulations}} in <b>CST,</b> a <b>5</b> -element prototype array was produced {{with the objective of}} comparing simulations on a 5 -element array in CST with those obtained from the prototype. The hypothesis was that if the measured performance on the prototype array was within acceptable limits of the simulated results, then one can presume that a full 11 element array will perform according to the simulation results given above. The center element of the 5 -element array showed almost identical performance in terms of radiation patterns for both horizontal and vertical polarization, however with a higher level of cross polarization. A shift in center frequency of 30 MHz was found in measurements and it was found that this most likely {{stems from the fact that}} the quarter-wave balun used in the prototype, was not included in CST simulations. Apart from this, the measurements on the prototype array suggests that the CST simulations on the full 11 element array are valid, thus serving as a motivational factor to build a full 11 element prototype and characterize it through measurements.|$|R
