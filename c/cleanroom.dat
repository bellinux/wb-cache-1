5|$|It {{was clear}} that the planned {{processing}} flow could not be followed and still meet the 1986 launch date. It was decided on Cosmonaut's Day (12 April) 1985 to ship the flight model of the base block to the Baikonur cosmodrome and conduct the systems testing and integration there. The module arrived at the launch site on 6 May, with 1100 of 2500 cables requiring rework {{based on the results of}} tests to the ground test model at Khrunichev. In October, the base block was rolled outside its <b>cleanroom</b> to carry out communications tests. The first launch attempt on 16 February 1986 was scrubbed when the spacecraft communications failed, but the second launch attempt, on 19 February 1986 at 21:28:23 UTC, was successful, meeting the political deadline.|$|E
5|$|Items include granite pavers {{that have}} {{memories}} of past Hillsboro citizens {{carved into the}} stone and photographs etched onto glass. Photographs range from pioneer times {{to life in the}} 1990s. There are also letters etched in glass from people such as Albert E. Tozier, Robert Summer, Chavela Mendoza, Lester C. Mooberry, Mary Ramsey Wood, George Iwasaki, and Howard Vollum. Gunfights, hangings, funerals, the internment of Japanese Americans during World War II, the Great Depression, and an outbreak of diphtheria in the 1890s are among the events represented. More recent photographs show the defunct Oregon Electric Railway, which the westside line often uses the old right-of-way of the former line, and employees at Intel dressed in <b>cleanroom</b> suits.|$|E
25|$|The modern <b>cleanroom</b> {{was invented}} by American {{physicist}} Willis Whitfield. As employee of the Sandia National Laboratories, Whitfield created the initial plans for the <b>cleanroom</b> in 1960. Prior to Whitfield's invention, earlier cleanrooms often had problems with particles and unpredictable airflows. Whitfield designed his <b>cleanroom</b> with a constant, highly filtered air flow to flush out impurities. Within {{a few years of}} its invention in the 1960s, Whitfield's modern <b>cleanroom</b> had generated more than 50 billion USD in sales worldwide.|$|E
5000|$|ISO 14644-5 {{provides}} the basic requirements for operating and maintaining <b>cleanrooms</b> and associated controlled environments. This standard addresses requirements that are basic {{to the operation}} of all <b>cleanrooms,</b> regardless of the application. Topics include: ...|$|R
50|$|<b>Cleanrooms</b> and {{zones are}} {{typically}} classified {{according to their}} use (the main activity within each room or zone) and confirmed by the cleanliness of the air by the measurement of particles. <b>Cleanrooms</b> are microbiologically assessed through environmental monitoring methods.|$|R
50|$|This part {{specifies}} {{test methods}} for designated classification of airborne particulate cleanliness and for characterizing {{the performance of}} <b>cleanrooms</b> and clean zones. These test methods are specified in the document for {{two different types of}} <b>cleanrooms</b> and clean zones; unidirectional flow and nonunidirectional flow.|$|R
25|$|Equipment {{inside the}} <b>cleanroom</b> is {{designed}} to generate minimal air contamination. Only special mops and buckets are used. <b>Cleanroom</b> furniture {{is designed to}} produce a minimum of particles and is easy to clean.|$|E
25|$|Low-level cleanrooms {{may only}} require special shoes, with {{completely}} smooth soles {{that do not}} track in dust or dirt. However, for safety reasons, shoe soles must not create slipping hazards. Access to a <b>cleanroom</b> is usually restricted to those wearing a <b>cleanroom</b> suit.|$|E
25|$|A <b>cleanroom</b> {{or clean}} room is an environment, {{typically}} used in manufacturing, including of pharmaceutical products or scientific research, {{as well as}} aerospace semiconductor engineering applications with {{a low level of}} environmental pollutants such as dust, airborne microbes, aerosol particles, and chemical vapors. More accurately, a <b>cleanroom</b> has a controlled level of contamination that is specified by the number of particles per cubic meter at a specified particle size. To give perspective, the ambient air outside in a typical urban environment contains 35,000,000 particles per cubic meter in the size range 0.5μm and larger in diameter, corresponding to an ISO 9 <b>cleanroom,</b> while an ISO 1 <b>cleanroom</b> allows no particles in that size range and only 12 particles per cubic meter of 0.3μm and smaller.|$|E

25|$|Some {{manufacturing}} facilities {{do not use}} fully classified cleanrooms, but use some <b>cleanroom</b> practices to maintain their contamination requirements.|$|E
25|$|Cleanrooms {{maintain}} particulate-free {{air through}} the use of either HEPA or ULPA filters employing laminar or turbulent air flow principles. Laminar, or unidirectional, air flow systems direct filtered air downward or in horizontal direction in a constant stream towards filters located on walls near the <b>cleanroom</b> floor or through raised perforated floor panels to be recirculated. Laminar air flow systems are typically employed across 80% of a <b>cleanroom</b> ceiling to maintain constant air processing. Stainless steel or other non shedding materials are used to construct laminar air flow filters and hoods to prevent excess particles entering the air. Turbulent, or non unidirectional, air flow uses both laminar air flow hoods and nonspecific velocity filters to keep air in a <b>cleanroom</b> in constant motion, although not all in the same direction. The rough air seeks to trap particles that may be in the air and drive them towards the floor, where they enter filters and leave the <b>cleanroom</b> environment. US FDA and EU have laid down guidelines and limit for microbial contamination which is very stringent to ensure freedom from microbial contamination in pharmaceutical products.|$|E

25|$|The air {{entering}} a <b>cleanroom</b> from outside is filtered to exclude dust, {{and the air}} inside is constantly recirculated through high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) and/or ultra-low particulate air (ULPA) filters to remove internally generated contaminants.|$|E
25|$|Small numbers {{refer to}} ISO 14644-1 standards, which specify the decimal {{logarithm}} {{of the number}} of particles 0.1µm or larger permitted per m3 of air. So, for example, an ISO class 5 <b>cleanroom</b> has at most 105 particles/m3.|$|E
25|$|Cleanrooms {{can be very}} large. Entire {{manufacturing}} facilities can be contained within a <b>cleanroom</b> with factory floors covering thousands of square meters. They are used extensively in semiconductor manufacturing, biotechnology, the life sciences, and other fields that {{are very sensitive to}} environmental contamination. There are also modular cleanrooms.|$|E

40|$|This article reports an {{investigation}} into the ability of the air supply in non-unidirectional <b>cleanrooms</b> to aid recovery from episodes of airborne contamination, and minimise airborne contamination at important locations. The ISO 14644 - 3 (2005) recovery test, which measures the rate of decay of test particles, was assessed and a reinterpretation of the test results suggested. This allowed air change effectiveness indexes to be calculated and used to evaluate the ventilation effectiveness of the <b>cleanroom’s</b> air supply. Air change effectiveness indexes were measured in various designs of <b>cleanrooms,</b> and reasons for deviations {{in the value of the}} indexes investigated...|$|R
25|$|In {{assessing}} <b>cleanroom</b> microorganisms, {{the typical}} flora are primarily {{those associated with}} human skin (Gram-positive cocci), although microorganisms from other sources such as the environment (Gram-positive rods) and water (Gram-negative rods) are also detected, although in lower number. Common bacterial genera include Micrococcus, Staphylococcus, Corynebacterium, and Bacillus, and fungal genera include Aspergillus and Pencillin.|$|E
25|$|In the {{healthcare}} and pharmaceutical sectors, control of microorganisms is important, especially microorganisms {{likely to be}} deposited into the air stream from skin shedding. Studying <b>cleanroom</b> microflora is of importance for microbiologists and quality control personnel to assess changes in trends. Shifts {{in the types of}} microflora may indicate deviations from the “norm” such as resistant strains or problems with cleaning practices.|$|E

25|$|Interest in {{robotics}} {{increased in}} the late 1970s and many US companies entered the field, including large firms like General Electric, and General Motors (which formed joint venture FANUC Robotics with FANUC LTD of Japan). U.S. startup companies included Automatix and Adept Technology, Inc. At {{the height of the}} robot boom in 1984, Unimation was acquired by Westinghouse Electric Corporation for 107 million U.S. dollars. Westinghouse sold Unimation to Stäubli Faverges SCA of France in 1988, which is still making articulated robots for general industrial and <b>cleanroom</b> applications and even bought the robotic division of Bosch in late 2004.|$|E
25|$|Membrane filters used in {{production}} processes are commonly made from {{materials such as}} mixed cellulose ester or polyethersulfone (PES). The filtration equipment and the filters themselves may be purchased as pre-sterilized disposable units in sealed packaging or must be sterilized by the user, generally by autoclaving at a temperature that does not damage the fragile filter membranes. To ensure proper functioning of the filter, the membrane filters are integrity tested post-use and sometimes before use. The nondestructive integrity test assures the filter is undamaged and is a regulatory requirement. Typically, terminal pharmaceutical sterile filtration is performed inside of a <b>cleanroom</b> to prevent contamination.|$|E
