The fact of using cable arises a lot of challenge in analyzing the kinematics and dynamics of such a robot. <b>Cable</b> <b>driven</b> redundant parallel robots consist of a moving platform which is connected by the means of actuated cables to the base.

40|$|The design {{analysis}} of a conveyor mechanism for an automatic car park is discussed. The conveyor assembly {{is made up of}} three units; the rack-pinion unit, the <b>cable</b> <b>drive</b> unit and the cantilever. The rack-pinion unit converts the rotational motion of a stepper motor to a linear forward and backward motion of the conveyor. The <b>cable</b> <b>drive</b> converts the rotational motion of another stepper motor to upward and downward motion of the cantilever to lift and lower the car at will. The cantilever is responsible for positioning the vehicle in the stack unit. The parameter for the cantilever is estimated to avoid excess deflection that could result from impact loading of a vehicle on the lift mechanism. The pinion-rack design for strength and rigidity is considered for the load required to be translated by the conveyor.

40|$|Industrial robots {{are most}} often {{position}} controlled and insensitive to external forces. In many robotic applications, however, such as teleoperation, haptics for virtual reality, and collaborative robotics, a close cooperation between humans and robots is required. For such applications, force sensing and control capabilities are required for stable interactions with the operator and environment. The robots must also be backdrivable, i. e., the robot {{must be able to}} follow user’s induced movements with the least possible resistance. High force efficiency is also desirable. These requirements are different from the design drivers of traditional industrial robots and call for specific actuators and reducers. Many such devices were proposed in the literature. However, they suffer from several drawbacks, offering either a limited reduction ratio or being complex and bulky. This paper introduces a novel solution to this problem. A new differential <b>cable</b> <b>drive</b> reducer is presented. It is backdrivable, has a high efficiency, and a potentially infinite reduction ratio. A prototype actuator using such a reducer has been developed and integrated on a test bench. The experimental characterization of its performance confirms its theoretical advantages...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—In {{this paper}} the dynamic {{analysis}} of a <b>cable</b> <b>drive</b> parallel manipulator is described in detail. The manipulator architecture is a simplified planer version adopted from the structure of Large Adaptive Reflector (LAR), the Canadian design of next generation giant radio telescopes. This structure consists of a parallel redundant manipulators actuated by long cables. The dynamic equations of this structure are nonlinear and implicit. Long cables, large amounts of impelling forces and high accelerations raise more concern about the elasticity of cables during dynamic analysis, which has been neglected in the preceding works. In this paper, the kinematic analysis of such manipulator is illustrated first. Then the nonlinear dynamic of such mechanism is derived using Newton-Euler formulation. Next a simple model for cable dynamics containing elastic and damping behavior is proposed. The proposed model neither ignores longitude elasticity properties of cable nor makes dynamic formulations heavily complicated like previous researches. Finally, manipulator dynamic with cable dynamic is derived, and the cable elasticity effects are compared in a simulation study. The results show significant role of elasticity in a cable-driven parallel manipulator {{such as the one}} used in LAR Mechanism...|$|E

In this paper, a position control in the null and range space is used to avoid cables from slacking and to achieve the desired performances. Indeed, a <b>cable</b> <b>driven</b> manipulator is a redundant system and its null space represents the internal forces, that is the tensions of the cables. To guarantee robustness against model parametric uncertainties and external disturbances, a position based disturbance observer has been designed. Proof of stability of the proposed control and bounds of the estimation error have been given. Simulation and experimental results show that the proposed control achieve the desired performances keeping the cables taut...|$|R
