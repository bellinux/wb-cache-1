40|$|The {{construction}} of water management and navigation structures often requires temporary works to exclude water to facilitate {{construction in the}} dry or at least under a lower water level within the construction area. The use of <b>cellular</b> <b>cofferdams</b> for both temporary and permanent earth/water retaining works is very common. A number of theories are presented that describe the failure mechanisms involved. These failure mechanisms were identified from model studies on circular type cofferdams are applied independent of cofferdam geometry. It is common to use diaphragm type cofferdams. To asses the validity of common failure mechanisms associated with <b>cellular</b> <b>cofferdams</b> when applied to diaphragm type cofferdams, a series of numerical modelling analyses were conducted. These were validated using field monitoring results of a large scale diaphragm type cofferdam constructed at St. Germans, Norfolk, UK. A series of plane strain analyses of a diaphragm type cofferdam were conducted using the geometry from a critical section of cofferdam. These analyses identified the lowest factor of safety based on the drained strength of the clay on which the cofferdam was constructed. The water level within the river was increased to accommodate flooding and soil strength was reduced to identify the general failure mechanism. The structural forces were calculated using both 2 D and 3 D models for a larger width section (13 m wide) to allow comparison with wall bending moments and displacements measured in field. The 3 D analyses used actual tie spacing and membrane effects whilst reducing the lateral stiffness of the wall to accommodate the stiffness reduction due to variation in the interlock forces. To measure the bending moment in sheet piles, resistance type strain gauges were installed on a 13 m wide section of cofferdam. The cell deflection, river and cell water levels were also monitored to identify tidal river effect {{and the influence of}} cell water level on performance. Comparison of field and numerical results highlighted a number of important design and construction detail related to diaphragm type <b>cellular</b> <b>cofferdams.</b> EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
2500|$|Landfill {{material}} from {{construction of the}} World Trade Center was used to add fill for the southern portion. <b>Cellular</b> <b>cofferdams</b> were constructed to retain the material. After removal of the piers, wooden piles and overburden of silt, the northern portion (north of, and including the marina) was filled with sand dredged from areas adjacent to Ambrose Channel in the Atlantic Ocean, as well as stone from the construction of Water Tunnel #3. By 1976, the landfill was completed. Seating stands for viewing the American Bicentennial [...] "Operation Sail" [...] flotilla parade were {{set up on the}} completed landfill in July 1976. Construction efforts ground to a halt in 1977, {{as a result of the}} city's fiscal crisis. That year, the presidential administration of Jimmy Carter approved mortgage insurance for 1,600 of the development's proposed units. In 1979, the title to the landfill was transferred from the city to the Battery Park City Authority, which financially restructured itself and created a new, more viable master plan, designed by Alex Cooper and Stanton Eckstut. By that time, only two of the proposed development's buildings had been built, and the $200 million bond issue was supposed to have been paid off the next year.|$|R

This dock, which was built inside a <b>cellular</b> steel pile <b>cofferdam,</b> was {{completed}} and placed in service in March 1943. The cofferdam was later incorporated as part of Piers 5 and 6.|$|R
40|$|The {{construction}} of cofferdams to protect building pits nearby rivers against high water dis-charges {{is part of}} the history in development of geotechnical engineering. Today cofferdams with a total height up to 25 m and a width up to 30 m and more are to be built as a part of quaywalls in modern marine terminals for bulk-goods and containers. The calculation methods for this high specialised constructions are world wide very different. The goal of all calculations is to minimize the dimensions and in consequence of this the costs of the quay wall. German geotechnical engineers normally use the method of JELINEK which is proposed in the recommendation R 100 of the EAU 1990. Applying this recommendation for the planning of a sea-lock for ocean-going vessels up to 150, 000 dwt it was found out that there are some differences in calculation between cofferdams used as protection elements against flood levels and cofferdams used as quay walls with a very complexe load of different dynamic influences of several live loads and water-pressure at one side and bulkhead weight, passive earth pressure and the support body as statically load on the other side. The comparison of the results for some cofferdam cross-sections of the improved JELINEK-method by using the diagrams with the results, won by using other calculation methods are sufficient. So the found out method for cofferdam calculation can be generally recommended to geotechnical engineers. At last a comparison is given about needed steel for sheet-piles and surface to be driven into the subsoil under the future dredging level for <b>cellular</b> <b>cofferdams</b> and double-wall cofferdams.

40|$|<b>Cellular</b> <b>cofferdams</b> are {{increasingly}} being used as permanent retaining walls, navigation or breakwater structures. When used as breakwaters, the metal fatigue can become a possible mode of failure for cellular structures due to the cyclic unbalanced lateral loads imposed by the wave action;This study was initiated as {{an investigation of the}} cell failures of the Calumet Harbor Breakwater structure in the South Chicago Harbor. The primary objective was the assessment of the interlock force fluctuations in the sheetpiles induced by the wave action on the structure;It has been well established that the conventional design methods for cellular structures have substantial shortcomings. These methods are usually overconservative and incapable of predicting deformations. In the past 15 years finite element method has been applied to analyze the cellular structures. The method provides the means to deal with soil-structure interaction problem, loading and geometric irregularities, as well as behavioral complexities of the materials. Past finite element work consisted of two-dimensional model versions. Each of these models require certain assumptions and simplifications regarding loads and geometry and can provide only specific information. Three-dimensional modelling can eliminate these drawbacks at the cost of complex and tedious modelling work and considerable increases in computation time and memory requirements;The Calumet Harbor Breakwater structure was analyzed using two-dimensional vertical slide and three-dimensional finite element models in parallel to evaluate the performances on a comparative basis. The analysis consisted of three main sequential stages: (1) simulation of the construction, (2) simulation of the permanent cumulative wave load effects on the structural condition of the breakwater, (3) wave load analysis;The analysis results showed that the model predictions regarding the interlock forces, displacements and lateral pressures were consistent in the construction simulation stage. However, the differences became more predominant under the increased loading {{in the second and third}} stages. In the second stage, the analysis results confirmed that the permanent effects of the wave loads alter the structural state of the breakwater considerably. Regarding the wave load analysis, three-dimensional model predictions resulted in a better agreement with the field recorded data...|$|R
