50|$|John Beasley {{published}} a <b>corrective</b> <b>note</b> on his website http://www.jsbeasley.co.uk/. His {{conclusion is that}} the game described to P. A. Hill in 1969 appeared once more to reduce to a single informant whose statements were at variance with all other known testimony. Moreover, John Beasley has found and proven that the game is flawed if played seriously.|$|E
5000|$|In {{reaction}} to this publication, Beasley was sent information that a set of this chess had made an apparition in an exhibition in Tokyo in 2002 {{as well as in}} several Japanese books that preceded or followed, written by Umebayashi Isao and Okano Shin. They could have rediscovered these rules by translating a book bought in Cambodia, where the Elephant could not capture sideways. The names they gave for the chessmen were somewhat different from Gollon (Kwon, Neamahn, Kwo, Seh, Tuuk, Trey as for the table). Umebayashi and Okano designated that game as [...] "shattrong". A photo of a complete set was available showing the 18 pieces on a board with marked diagonals. Beasley published a <b>corrective</b> <b>note</b> in the British specialized magazine Variant Chess (Issue 55, September 2007 and issue 64, August 2010 [...] ) to acknowledge this second “evidence”. He acknowledged that the game is apparently absent [...] "from the streets of Phnom Penh in 2003" [...] and stated that Peter suggested [...] "that this may have been a minor consequence of the mass killings of the Pol Pot era.".|$|E
50|$|Audit In April 2014, the Pennsylvania Auditor General {{conducted}} a performance {{audit of the}} District. The findings were reported to the School Board and the District’s administration. In December 2011, the Pennsylvania Auditor General {{conducted a}} performance audit of the District. Multiple findings were noted. Additionally, the District was cited for failure to addresses prior audit recommendations to take <b>corrective</b> actions <b>noted</b> in audits conducted in the 2005-06 and 2004-05 school years.|$|R
2500|$|Entering {{into the}} fifth season, the {{production}} team knew {{the series was}} not being renewed and had saved money from the budget of each season five episode {{for use in a}} climactic battle for the season finale. The money was instead used for the penultimate episode, [...] "Eye of the Storm", while the last episode ended with an unresolved cliffhanger. Insiders have various theories as to why this happened. The producers were concerned the Sci Fi Channel had lost interest in the show (even though it was their highest-rated program at the time) after they ceased supplying <b>corrective</b> <b>notes</b> for the episodes, and it was believed they did not even bother reading the scripts. One strict rule the Sci Fi Channel had was that a gun couldn't be pointed at a person's head. To test this rule, executive producer Bill Dial presented a script featuring a character getting his head shot completely off—which was ignored. Dial then presented the script for the final episode cliffhanger, which was also ignored. Some claim this was done to encourage fans to push for a sixth season, but members of the production team claim that the decision was personal.|$|R
5000|$|Johnston High School again {{made the}} news when President Ronald Reagan cited the Time {{magazine}} article during {{a press conference}} on May 17, 1983, noting how local officials were taking the initiative to transform schools without federal aid and the court-ordered desegregation that Reagan often opposed. [...] The New York Times offered a <b>corrective,</b> <b>noting</b> that court-ordered busing and $368,000 in federal aid “transformed the Johnston High School from a decaying slum school into an institution that has gained national attention for educational excellence.” [...] The paper quoted Principal Adan Salgado, who shared that President Reagan “did not really understand our situation. He did not have all the facts." [...] Salgado noted that the President’s decision to eliminate federal funding under the Emergency School Assistance Act negatively impacted the Johnston community, which, before desegregation through busing, was “99 percent Mexican-American and black, …the ‘doormat of the district.’” [...] The article continued: “Before that, Mr. Salgado said, his school was deteriorating badly, suffering from poor attendance, low achievement and lack of parental involvement. He said the Federal aid allowed him to keep promises to parents about school improvements. New classrooms were built, the gymnasium and locker rooms were remodeled, courses in Latin and computer sciences were added, and new band uniforms were purchased.” ...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to compare the effects of two types of {{corrective}} feedback on EFL learners’ writing skill. Thirty five advanced learners in three groups participated in this study. Structures of written texts were taught in all three classes during fourteen sessions of treatment; and each session, a related topic was given and the learners were asked to write about it. In class A, the learners had to deliver their assignments to the teacher in classroom; then the teacher wrote the <b>corrective</b> <b>notes</b> on their papers and gave their papers back the next session. In class B, students had to write their assignments on their electronic instruments, and after that send written tasks via email to the teacher, and he also sent the corrective comments on their errors through email. In class C, as control group, no corrective feedback was given to learners’ errors in their written tasks. Moreover, in class C, learners were free to deliver their writings whether in class or by email. The obtained results showed both methods to be effective since the scores of both experimental groups were significantly higher than the scores of control group, but electronic feedback was more effective and profitable than traditional type; because scores of the learners in group B (Electronic feedback) were significantly higher than class C (Traditional feedback).

It serves as a form of after-disaster briefing for all parties involved to analyze what worked well, what needs improvement, what person or agency needs to be responsible for said improvements, and the assignments and timelines for the <b>noted</b> <b>corrective</b> and proactive improvements to be in place.|$|R
40|$|Over {{the past}} 14 years, an {{effort was made}} to {{summarize}} and improve our knowledge of the Arkansas pteridophyte flora beyond that developed by Taylor and Demaree (1979). They presented a flora of 68 species plus 2 varieties plus 4 hybrids, for a total of 74 taxa vouchered with 1335 county-level occurrence records. Changes in accepted nomenclature, field work, and herbaria searches have added as new to the flora 10 species plus 1 variety plus 7 hybrids, supported with 74 county-level occurrence records. Another 815 county-level occurrence records were added to the known flora. The Arkansas pteridophyte flora now consists of 78 species plus 3 varieties plus 11 hybrids, supported with 2224 county-level occurrence records. Achecklist, 92 distribution maps, a history of Arkansas pteridophyte floristics, <b>corrective</b> nomenclatural <b>notes,</b> and a phylogeny based ona recent national treatment on pteridophytes are provided...|$|R

5000|$|A civil {{investigation}} conducted between 2011 and 2013 {{found that}} the city of Miami Police Department (MPD) has [...] "engaged in a pattern or practice of excessive use of force through officer-involved shootings {{in violation of the}} Fourth Amendment of the Constitution." [...] Between 2008 and 2011, officers intentionally shot at individuals on 33 separate occasions, three of which MPD itself found unjustified. The US DOJ found that a number of MPD practices, including deficient tactics, improper actions by specialized units, as well as egregious delays and substantive deficiencies in deadly force investigations, contributed to the pattern or practice of excessive force. However, {{it should be noted that}} all of the aforementioned officer-involved shootings that have been analyzed to date by the State Attorneys Office were found to be justified. [...] The DOJ's findings noted that MPD did not provide close supervision or hold individuals accountable for their actions by failing to complete thorough, objective and timely investigations of officer-involved shootings. For a significant number of the shootings, including one that occurred in 2008, MPD has not reached a conclusion internally as to whether or not the officer’s firearm discharge was lawful and within policy. The DOJ also found that MPD’s failure to complete timely and thorough investigations of officer-involved shootings undermined accountability and exposed MPD officers and the community to unreasonable risks that might have been addressed through prompt <b>corrective</b> action, <b>noting</b> that several investigations remained open for more than three years. Significantly, a small number of officers were involved in a disproportionate number of shootings, while the investigations into their shootings continued to be egregiously delayed. The DOJ noted that similar deficiencies were found in its previous investigation that began in 2002. The 2011-2013 investigation was conducted by the Special Litigation Section of the Department of Justice’s Civil Rights Division and the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of Florida, with the assistance of an experienced law enforcement expert, pursuant to the pattern or practice provision of the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994. It involved an in-depth review of thousands of documents, including written policies and procedures, training materials, and internal reports, photographs, video and audio recordings and investigative files. The review benefited from productive dialogue with MPD supervisors and officers, city of Miami officials, the Office of the State Attorney, the Civilian Investigative Panel, and members of the Miami community. The DOJ provided feedback to MPD during the investigation and commended Miami police chief Manuel Orosa for taking steps to address some of the deficiencies identified since the investigation began. [...] The findings letter of the investigation is available on the DOJ website. To address the issues it identified, the city will enter a judicially overseen agreement with the DOJ. In a statement responding to the investigation, Chief Manuel Orosa said, [...] "The Miami Police Department welcomes this long-awaited response and looks forward to the opportunity to clarify several components of the letter, as well as to labor intensely to negotiate an agreement with the Department of Justice, as promptly as possible.” ...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to {{evaluate}} the internal control system in ZETDC (Zimbabwe Electricity Transmission and Distribution Company) on service delivery with regards to the period 2009 to 2012. This is the period when Zimbabwe, as a country commenced using the US dollar and other foreign currencies after experiencing several years of devastation by a record inflation, on the local Zimbabwean currency. Most services were expected to improve with the stability in the economy. ZETDC is a subsidiary of ZESA Holdings (Zimbabwe Electricity Supply Authority), the electricity utility service provider in Zimbabwe. The COSO framework on internal controls as noted by Chambers and Rand (2011) articulates that internal controls should provide reasonable assurance regarding the achievements of objectives on the effectiveness and efficiency of operations, the reliability of financial reporting and compliance with applicable laws and regulations. Authors such as Hopkin (2012), Warren (2012) and Graham (2010) in supporting the COSO framework, notes that there are five elements of internal controls that form an umbrella over the business to protect it from control threats and these include, the control environment, risk assessment, control procedures, monitoring and information communication. A good internal control system should have three forms of controls as noted by Hall (2010), which include preventative, detective and <b>corrective</b> controls. As <b>noted</b> by Harrer (2010), strong controls put up roadblocks for fraud, bad decisions, human error and help to minimise pitfalls and surprises. On the other hand, poor internal controls were noted to negatively affect service delivery and Braiota, Gazzaway, Colson, Colson and Ramamoorti (2010) believe that an organisation cannot produce reliable services or products without good internal controls. Obtaining sufficient resources, recruiting and retaining the right expertise and maintaining good communications and relations are some of the challenges in implementing effective internal controls highlighted by Hightower (2008). The target population for the study consist of ZETDC staff members estimated at 5, 000 inclusive of board members. A sample of 100 staff members was selected using multistage random sampling to ensure a fair representation of all hierarchical levels of staff in ZETDC on the sample. Data was collected through a survey questionnaire which was distributed to staff members in ZETDC including board members. A 55...|$|R
