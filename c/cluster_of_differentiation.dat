The Notch Signaling Pathway is a highly conserved pathway that functions to establish and regulate cell fate decisions in many organ systems. Once the JAG1-NOTCH (receptor-ligand) interactions take place, a cascade of proteolytic cleavages is triggered resulting in activation of the transcription for downstream target genes. Located on human chromosome 20, the JAG1 gene is expressed in multiple organ systems in the body and causes the autosomal dominant disorder Alagille syndrome (ALGS) resulting from loss of function mutations within the gene.

50|$|The {{majority}} of gastric lymphomas are non-Hodgkin's lymphoma of B-cell origin. These tumors may range from well-differentiated, superficial involvements (MALT) to high-grade, large-cell lymphomas. Sometimes, it's hard to differentiate poorly differentiated high grade B-cell gastric lymphoma from gastric adenocarcinoma clinically or radiologically, yet histopathology with immunohistochemistry is recommended to stain specific markers on the malignant cell that favor {{the diagnosis of}} lymphoma. Immunohistochemistry stains specific <b>clusters</b> <b>of</b> <b>differentiation</b> that are present on B-cells like CD20.

40|$|The {{identification}} of cell surface markers, defined as <b>clusters</b> <b>of</b> <b>differentiation</b> antigens (CD’s) {{could be used}} to classify and sub-classify leukemia. Although the same antigens are expressed on normal cells, the phenotype on malignant cells are aberrantly and frequently asynchronously expressed and may be present in combinations not observed in normal blood or bone marrow. Aberrant expression of surface antigens corresponds with poor therapeutic response and short survival. Additional surface marker analysis complementary to morphologic evaluation and cytochemical staining has greatly improved our ability to characterize hematologic malignancies. A review and illustration on the diagnostic significance of immunophenotyping in leukemia will be presented. Data from 225 patients having complete assessments including morphology, cytochemistry and immunophenotyping in the period of 1994 - 2001 were collected and analyzed. Based on morphologic evaluation and cytochemistry, the diagnosis of acute myeloid leukemia and acute lymphoblastic leukemia were established in 51. 1 % and 48. 9 % of cases, respectively. Based on immunophenotyping AML was found in 49. 0 % of the cases. ALL could be classified into 4. 9 % pre-B-ALL, 18. 7 % B-ALL, and 14. 7 % T-ALL. Cases expressing cross-lineage antigens were found in 12. 7 %. The prognostic significance of these aberrant expression of antigens for those cases has yet to be established but some of the cases responded poorly to therapy. Immunophenotyping provides the tool to: 1) distinguish normal from clonal populations of leukemic cells; 2) define lineage and reveal the stage of maturation; 3) identify inappropriate expression of lineage associated antigens; 4) provides more informations to establish diagnosis and prognosis compared to standard methods.

2500|$|Each {{of these}} {{different}} cell types are expressed in <b>cluster</b> <b>of</b> <b>differentiation</b> 1 molecules (CD1). There are 5 subtypes of CD1 molecules that range from a through e. The a through d subtypes are capable of binding to sulfatide. CD1a, CD1b, and CD1c subtypes present lipid antigens to T cells, while CD1d cells present lipids, glycolipids, and lipoproteins to Natural killer T cells. CD1 a through c cell subtypes initiate T helper type 1 and type 2 responses, and they facilitate sulfatide loading {{onto the surface of}} the cells. There are two types of cell subtypes that interact with CD1d cells: Type 1 Natural killer T cells and Type 2 Natural killer T cells. Type 2 Natural killer T cells are able to recognize sulfatide/ CD1d tetramers, and as a result, they are activated by different tissues specific forms of sulfatide. [...] Type 2 Natural killer T cells that react with sulfatide help aid in protection from autoimmune disease and ischemic reperfusion. They are capable of such protection because the Type 1 Natural killer T cells can be regulated by Type 2 Natural killer T cells that react with sulfatide by altering how the dendritic cells function.|$|E

5000|$|The {{combination}} of the microscopic examination of the peripheral blood {{and analysis of the}} lymphocytes by flow cytometry to confirm clonality and marker molecule expression is needed to establish the diagnosis of CLL. Both are easily accomplished on a small amount of blood. A flow cytometer instrument can examine the expression of molecules on individual cells in fluids. This requires the use of specific antibodies to marker molecules with fluorescent tags recognized by the instrument. In CLL, the lymphocytes are genetically clonal, of the B cell lineage (expressing marker molecules <b>clusters</b> <b>of</b> <b>differentiation</b> 19 and 20), and characteristically express the marker molecules CD5 and CD23. These B cells resemble normal lymphocytes under the microscope, although slightly smaller, and are fragile when smeared onto a glass slide, giving rise to many broken cells, which are called [...] "smudge" [...] or [...] "smear" [...] cells.|$|R
50|$|The {{diagnosis}} of CLL {{is based on}} the demonstration of an abnormal population of B lymphocytes in the blood, bone marrow, or tissues that display an unusual but characteristic pattern of molecules on the cell surface. This atypical molecular pattern includes the coexpression of cell surface markers <b>clusters</b> <b>of</b> <b>differentiation</b> 5 (CD5) and 23. In addition, all the CLL cells within one individual are clonal, that is, genetically identical. In practice, this is inferred by the detection of only one of the mutually exclusive antibody light chains, kappa or lambda, on the entire population of the abnormal B cells. Normal B lymphocytes consist of a stew of different antibody-producing cells, resulting in a mixture of both kappa- and lambda-expressing cells. The lack of the normal distribution of these B cells is one basis for demonstrating clonality, the key element for establishing a {{diagnosis of}} any B cell malignancy (B cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma).|$|R

40|$|AbstractIntroductionIntradermal bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG) {{vaccination}} by needle-free, disposable-syringe jet injectors (DSJI) is {{an alternative}} to the Mantoux method using needle and syringe (NS). We compared the safety and immunogenicity of BCG administration via the DSJI and NS techniques in adults and newborn infants at the South African Tuberculosis Vaccine Initiative (SATVI) research site in South Africa. MethodThirty adults and 66 newborn infants were randomized 1 : 1 to receive intradermal BCG vaccine (0. 1 mL in adults; 0. 05 mL in infants) via DSJI or NS. Wheal diameter (mm) and skin fluid deposition at the site of injection (SOI) were measured immediately post-vaccination. Adverse events and SOI reactogenicity data were collected 30 min and 1, 2, 4, and 12 weeks after vaccination for adults and at 30 min and 4, 10, and 14 weeks for infants. Blood was collected in infants at 10 and 14 weeks to assess BCG-specific T-cell immune responses. ResultsMore infant BCG vaccinations by DSJI deposited > 5 μL fluid on the skin surface, compared to NS (49 % versus 9 %, p= 0. 001). However, all 12 infant vaccinations that did not produce any SOI wheal occurred in the NS group (36 %, p< 0. 001). Median wheal diameter, in participants for which an SOI wheal formed, did not differ significantly between groups in infants (combined 3. 0 mm IQR 2. 0 to 4. 0, p= 0. 59) or in adults (combined 9. 0 mm IQR 7. 0 to 10. 0, p= 0. 13). Adverse events were similar between study arms. Proportion of participants with BCG scars after three months did not differ in adults (combined 97 %, p= 0. 67) or infants (combined 62 %, p= 0. 13). Frequencies <b>of</b> BCG-specific <b>clusters</b> <b>of</b> <b>differentiation</b> 4 (CD 4) and <b>clusters</b> <b>of</b> <b>differentiation</b> 8 (CD 8) T-cells co-expressing IFN-γ, TNF-α, IL- 2, and/or IL- 17 were not different in the DSJI and NS groups. ConclusionBCG vaccination of newborn infants via DSJI was more likely to deliver an appropriate intradermal wheal at the SOI as compared to NS, despite leaving more fluid {{on the surface of the}} skin. Safety, reactogenicity, and antigen-specific T-cell immune responses did not differ between DSJI and NS techniques...|$|R
40|$|AbstractDuring {{the last}} decades for several species – e. g. swine – many mAb to leukocyte-specific {{molecules}} have been developed and <b>clusters</b> <b>of</b> <b>differentiation</b> corresponding to human CD could be established.

These clusters contain antigens with currently no obvious orthologs to human leukocyte differentiation antigens. In this study, we describe the generation of a eukaryotic cDNA expression library from in vitro activated porcine peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Screening of this library with an antibody recognizing SWC 1 enabled isolation and sequencing of cDNAs coding for the porcine SWC 1 molecule. A BLAST search of the obtained sequence revealed that SWC 1 is the orthologous molecule of human CD 52. Therefore, our study provides the basis for comparative studies on the role of CD 52 in different mammalian species. In addition, the established cDNA library can be used for investigation of additional SWC-defined molecules...|$|R
