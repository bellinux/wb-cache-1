50|$|The 13 March 1938 Anschluss of Austria to Nazi Germany {{marked the}} forced {{end of the}} Rothschild's {{business}} in Austria. Because he was Jewish, Baron Louis von Rothschild, head of the bank at the time, was held in prison {{for a year and}} only released after a substantial ransom was paid by his family. After Baron Louis was stripped of his Austrian citizenship and allowed to leave the country empty-handed, in March 1939 the Nazis placed the firm of S M von Rothschild under <b>compulsory</b> <b>administration</b> and then sold it to the German private bank Merck, Finck & Co. in October of that year.|$|E
50|$|Only in 1875, Brioschi’s successor, Arcangelo Scacchi, {{was able}} to {{transfer}} the Italian Society seat definitely from Modena to Rome, in the premises of the Engineering School in San Pietro in Vincoli. The XL remained there until 1934, when the fascist government decreed by law that the Society of the XL {{be transferred to the}} “Royal Lincei Academy” (Reale Accademia dei Lincei), which at the time was subjected first to a <b>compulsory</b> <b>administration</b> and thereafter was incorporated in the Royal Academy of Italy. Starting from 1935, even though the formal seat was at Villa Farnesina, the archive and part of the library were moved to the newly established School of Mathematics on the Rome University Campus by Guido Castelnuovo who was in office as Academy manager.|$|E
50|$|The Rothschild {{business}} empire {{was passed}} down to ensuing generations until the March 13, 1938 Anschluss of Austria to Nazi Germany {{when the family}} was pressured to sell its banking operations {{at a fraction of}} its real worth. While other Rothschilds had escaped the Nazis, Baron Louis was imprisoned for a year and only released after a substantial ransom was paid by his family. After Louis was allowed to leave the country, in March 1939 the Nazis placed the firm of S M von Rothschild under <b>compulsory</b> <b>administration.</b> Nazi officers and senior staff from Austrian museums also emptied the Rothschild family estates of all their valuables. Post war, some of the family's assets were restored to the survivors, but others were not. In 1999, as a result of international Jewish pressure groups along with a determined personal effort by Bettina von Rothschild, the government of Austria returned some 250 Rothschild art treasures worth more than US$100 million. The artworks, which had been looted by the Nazis and placed in the Kunsthistorisches, the Albertina, the Leopold Museum and other state museums after World War II, were returned to the eldest surviving heir of two Vienna Rothschild brothers.|$|E
40|$|The {{dissertation}} investigates {{support by}} economists {{for the global}} policy shift away from unfunded public pension schemes towards funded private pension schemes. Influential economists and institutions, including the World Bank, present a suite of economic arguments that suggest that this shift will have positive effects on national economies, particularly {{in the context of}} aging. The arguments may be categorised according to their relation to the operation of three sets of institutions: capital markets, labour markets and political systems. In capital markets, the transition is purported to increase private and national saving, increase {{the quantity and quality of}} investment, and provide more efficient private administration. In labour markets, it is claimed that the shift will reduce labour market distortions associated with public pensions, which inhibit competitiveness, produce unemployment and encourage early retirement. According to the World Bank, public pensions systems cause these distortions without achieving their stated objective of reducing inequality. In the political sphere, the shift is purported to insulate the pension system from political pressures, which otherwise inevitably lead to crisis. The thesis provides evidence which refutes these claims. The best research, including studies by orthodox economists, indicate that the shift does not increase savings or investment, or improve the quality of financial investment. The main effect of tax concessions associated with private pension systems is to divert to private pension funds savings that would occur in any case via other mechanisms. The tax concessions are also regressive, even in systems with <b>compulsory</b> elements. Private <b>administration</b> of pensions, particularly in a plural consumer market setting, is highly inefficient, with customers at a disadvantage in dealing with providers due to the complexity and opacity of products and pricing. A negative relationship is found between public pension spending and levels of elderly poverty, suggesting that reducing public pension spending increases levels of elderly inequality. Public pensions are found not to explain differences in economic growth between regions. Elements of system design which distort labour markets, such as by encouraging early retirement, can easily be adjusted. However, such elements are explicit government policy in several countries. A review of public and private pensions finds that examples of public system crisis are associated with instances of economic and political collapse, rather than system design. Private funded systems are found to be more vulnerable, not less, to the same external influences. Relatively generous universal public pension systems are found to be financially sustainable despite demographic change, assuming modest levels of economic growth...|$|R
5000|$|Tucci was a {{supporter}} of Italian Fascism and Benito Mussolini. His activity under Il Duce started with Giovanni Gentile, at the time Professor of the History of Philosophy at the University of Rome and already close friend and collaborator of Mussolini, when Tucci was studying {{at the university of}} Rome, and went on until Gentile killing, and the <b>compulsory</b> <b>administration</b> of IsMEO for over two years until 1947. In November 1936 - January 1937 he was the representative of Mussolini in Japan, where he was sent to improve the diplomatic relations between Italy and Japan and to make Fascist propaganda. On April 27, 1937 he gave a speech on the radio in Japanese on Mussolini's behalf. In this country his strong and tireless action paved the way to the inclusion of Italy to the Anti-Comintern Pact (November 6, 1937). He wrote popular articles for the Italian state that decried the rationalism of industrialized 1930s-1940s Europe and yearned for an authentic existence in touch with nature, that he claimed could be found in Asia. According to Tibetologist Donald S. Lopez, [...] "For Tucci, Tibet was an ecological paradise and timeless utopia into which industrialized Europe figuratively could escape and find peace, a cure for western ills, and from which Europe could find its own pristine past to which to return." ...|$|E
