In our study we employed an accurate interaction potential derived from quantum mechanics. We explored the stability domains of circular and collapsed cross section structures of armchair (n, n), zigzag (n, 0), and chiral (2 n, n) isolated single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) up to a circular cross section radius of 170 A. We have found three different stability regions based on circular cross section radius. Below 10 A radius only the circular cross section tubules are stable. Between 10 and 30 A both circular and collapsed forms are possible, however, the circular cross section SWNTs are energetically favorable. Beyond 30 A (<b>crossover</b> <b>radius)</b> the collapsed form becomes favorable for all three types of SWNTs.

40|$|For {{cylindrical}} and spherical {{heat transfer}} systems, {{it is imperative}} that the radius of thermal material is matched to the associated heat transfer objective. For systems that intend to maximize heat transfer, the critical radius defines the optimal radius for a specific scenario. For systems that intend to minimize heat transfer, the <b>crossover</b> <b>radius</b> defines the radius required to achieve an equal heat transfer rate to the un-insulated scenario; with any further increase in radii resulting in a monotonic reduction in the associated heat transfer rate. The critical radius is well defined for the steady-state scenario. In recent literature, the steady-state <b>crossover</b> <b>radius</b> has also received attention; however, the literature does not provide clarity for the transient scenario. This work overcomes this identified limitation by quantifying the crossover and critical radii of a transient cylindrical system, allowing novel conclusions to be drawn between the steady-state and transient scenarios. In particular, this work identifies that the cycle-average heat transfer rate can stabilize to a quasi-static value in response to transient heating...|$|E
40|$|We {{present results}} {{illustrating}} {{the effects of}} using explicit summation terms for the r^- 6 dispersion term on the interfacial properties of a Lennard-Jones fluid and SPC/E water. For the Lennard-Jones fluid, {{we find that the}} use of long-range summations, even with a short "crossover radius," yields results that are consistent with simulations using large cutoff radii. Simulations of SPC/E water demonstrate that the long-range dispersion forces are of secondary importance to the Coulombic forces. In both cases, we find that the ratio of box size L_∥ to <b>crossover</b> <b>radius</b> r_ c^ k {{plays an important role in}} determining the magnitude of the long-range dispersion correction, although its effect is secondary when Coulombic interactions are also present.

40|$|We propose an {{approximation}} for {{the total}} ice nucleation rate J=J(T,R) in supercooled water droplets {{as a function of}} both droplet radius R and temperature T, taking account of both volume-based and surface-stimulated nucleation modes. Its crucial idea is that, even in the surface-stimulated mode crystal nuclei initially emerge (as sub-critical clusters) homogeneously in the sub-surface layer, not "pseudo-heterogeneously" at the surface. This mode is negligible in large droplets, but becomes increasingly important with decreasing droplet size and is dominant in small droplets. The <b>crossover</b> droplet <b>radius</b> for the transition of homogeneous ice nucleation from the volume-based mode to the surface-stimulated mode nonmonotonically depends on T from 233 K to 239. 5 K, ranging there from about 2 microns to about 100 microns. Using experimental data on ice nucleation rates in small droplets, we determine that the ice-air interfacial tension of basal facets of ice crystals monotonically increases from about 89 dyn/cm at T= 234. 8 K to about 91 dyn/cm at T= 236. 2 K.

40|$|Excitons with a {{radius of}} a few lattice {{constants}} can be affected by strong central-cell corrections, leading to significant deviations of the optical spectrum from the hydrogen-like Rydberg series, and also to an enhancement of the exciton mass. We present an approach to this situation based on a lattice model that incorporates {{the effects of a}} non-parabolic band structure, short distance corrections to the Coulomb interaction between electrons and holes, spin-orbit and exchange coupling. The lattice model allows for observation of the <b>crossover</b> from large <b>radius</b> Wannier to small radius Frenkel excitons without invoking a continuum approximation. We apply the lattice model approach especially to the yellow exciton series in the cuprous oxide, for which the optical spectrum and exciton mass enhancement are obtained through adaptation of only a few model parameters to material-specific values. Our results predict a strongly anisotropic ortho-exciton mass. Comment: 10 pages, 7 figure...|$|R
40|$|The {{scattering}} {{function and}} {{radius of gyration}} of an ideal polymer network are calculated depending {{on the strength of}} the bonds that form the crosslinks. Our calculations are based on an exact theorem for the characteristic function of a polydisperse phantom network that allows for treating the crosslinks between pairs of randomly selected monomers as quenched variables without resorting to replica methods. From this new approach it is found that the scattering function of an ideal network obeys a master curve which depends on one single parameter x = (ak) 2 N/M, where ak is the product of the persistence length times the scattering wavevector, N the total number of monomers and M the crosslinks in the system. By varying the crosslinking potential from infinity (hard δ-constraints) to zero (free chain), we have also studied the <b>crossover</b> of the <b>radius</b> of gyration from the collapsed regime where R g ≃ O(1) to the extended regime R g ≃ O (√ N). In the crossover regime the network size R g is found to be proportional to (N/M) 1 / 4. The latter result can be understood in terms of a simple Flory argument...|$|R
40|$|For 6 Li {{scattering}} from 12 C at five laboratory energies from 90 to 318 MeV, {{we study}} the dynamic polarization potential, DPP, {{due to the}} breakup of the projectile. The breakup is evaluated using standard continuum discretized coupled-channels formalism applied to a two-body cluster model of the projectile. The DPP is evaluated over a wide radial range using both direct S-matrix-to-potential inversion and trivially equivalent local potential methods which yield substantially and systematically different results. The radius at which the real DPP changes from external repulsion to interior attraction varies systematically with energy. This should be experimentally testable because, according to notch tests, this <b>crossover</b> <b>radius</b> is within a radial range to which elastic scattering should be sensitive. The imaginary DPP has an emissive (generative) region at the lower energies; this may be associated with counterintuitive properties of |S L |...|$|E

We have found three different stability regions based on circular cross section radius. Below 10 Å radius only the circular cross section tubules are stable.

Beyond 30 Å (<b>crossover</b> <b>radius)</b> the collapsed form becomes favorable for all three types of SWNTs. We report {{the behavior of the}} SWNTs with radii close to the <b>crossover</b> <b>radius</b> ((45, 45), (80, 0), (70, 35)) under uniaxial compressive and tensile loads. Using classical thin-plane approximation and variation of strain energy as a function of curvature, we calculated the bending modulus of the SWNTs. The calculated bending moduli are [kappa][sub](n,n) = 963. 44 GPa, [kappa][sub](n, 0) = 911. 64 GPa, and [kappa][sub](2 n,n) = 935. 48 GPa. We also calculated the interlayer spacing between the opposite sides of the tubes and found d[sub](n,n) = 3. 38 angstroms, d[sub](2 n,n) = 3. 39 angstroms, and d[sub](n, 0) = 3. 41 angstroms. Using an enthalpy optimization method, we have determined the crystal structure and Young's modulus of (10, 10) armchair, (17, 0) zigzag and (12, 6) chiral forms (which have similar diameter as (10, 10)). They all pack in a triangular pattern in two dimensions. Calculated lattice parameters are a[sub](10, 10) = 16. 78 angstroms, a[sub](17, 0) = 16. 52 angstroms and a[sub](12, 6) = 16. 52 angstroms. Using the second derivatives of potential we calculated Young's modulus along the tube axis and found Y[sub](10, 10) = 640. 30 GPa, Y[sub](17, 0) = 648. 43 GPa, and Y[sub](12, 6) = 673. 94 GPa. Using the optimized structures of (10, 10), (12, 6) and (17, 0), we determined the vibrational modes and frequencies. Here, we report the highest in-plane mode, compression mode, breathing mode, shearing mode and relevant cyclop mode frequencies...|$|E
