5|$|WALL-E (stylized with an interpunct as WALL·E) is a 2008 American computer-animated {{science fiction}} film {{produced}} by Pixar Animation Studios for Walt Disney Pictures. It was directed and co-written by Andrew Stanton, produced by Jim Morris, and co-written by Jim Reardon. It stars {{the voices of}} Ben Burtt, Elissa Knight, Jeff Garlin, Fred Willard, John Ratzenberger, Kathy Najimy, Sigourney Weaver, and the MacInTalk system, and was the overall ninth feature film produced by the company. It follows a trash <b>compactor</b> robot in a deserted world, left to clean a largely abandoned city. However, he is visited by a probe sent by the Axiom ship, whom he {{falls in love with}} and pursues across the galaxy.|$|E
5|$|When Nora arrives home, Ray {{shows up}} {{demanding}} {{the name of}} the person responsible. She tells him that the man responsible is Owen Harris. Ray finds Harris, along with his family, and nearly kills him. However, he realizes that Harris was an accountant who accidentally sent the barrel to the salvage yard. Seeing that he was ultimately innocent, Ray spares him and goes off to die. Scully believes that this act represented the last of Ray’s humanity. At {{the very end of the}} episode, a car is dropped into a <b>compactor</b> at a salvage yard and crushed. As the camera fades out, Ray's eye is seen, still alive as the car is crushed.|$|E
5|$|Gordon escapes the {{destroyed}} lab. Surviving staff {{tell him}} that communications {{with the outside world}} have been cut and urge him to head to the surface. Gordon fights his way through Black Mesa, defending himself against hostile Xen creatures — such as Vortigaunts and parasitic headcrabs, which attach themselves to human hosts — and US marines sent to cover up the incident. At the surface, Gordon learns that scientists from the Lambda Complex may have a way to close the portal. Gordon travels {{to the other end of}} the facility to assist them. Along the way, he activates a rocket engine test facility to destroy a giant tentacled creature and uses a disused railway system to reach and launch a satellite rocket. After he is captured by Black Ops and left for dead in a garbage <b>compactor,</b> he escapes and makes his way to an older part of the facility, where he discovers Xen specimens collected before the resonance cascade.|$|E
50|$|There {{are also}} trash <b>compactors,</b> {{hydraulic}} or manual, designed for residential use. Likewise, they reduce {{the volume of}} garbage. For example, some <b>compactors</b> reduce the volume of polystyrene to 1/30.|$|R
50|$|These <b>compactors</b> {{are almost}} {{exclusively}} of welded steel construction for two reasons: durability under pressure {{and exposure to}} the elements, as <b>compactors</b> are installed either completely outdoors or sometimes under a covered loading dock.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{a systematic}} methodology for calculating the aliasing probability when an arbitrary finite-state machine {{is used to}} compact the response of a combinational circuit to a sequence of randomly generated test input vectors. The proposed approach is general {{and is based on}} simultaneously tracking the states of two (fictitious) <b>compactors,</b> one driven by the response of the fault-free combinational circuit and the other one driven by the response of the faulty combinational circuit. By deriving the overall Markov chain that describes the combined behavior of these two <b>compactors,</b> we are able to calculate the exact aliasing probability based on its stationary distribution and to demonstrate regimes over which nonlinear <b>compactors</b> may be preferable over linear <b>compactors...</b>|$|R

25|$|Early garbage removal {{trucks were}} simply open bodied dump trucks pulled {{by a team}} of horses. They became {{motorized}} {{in the early part of}} the 20th century and the first close body trucks to eliminate odours with a dumping lever mechanism were introduced in the 1920s in Britain. These were soon equipped with 'hopper mechanisms' where the scooper was loaded at floor level and then hoisted mechanically to deposit the waste in the truck. The Garwood Load Packer was the first truck in 1938, to incorporate a hydraulic <b>compactor.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{vehicle was}} fitted with 7mm armour, was {{powered by a}} 20hp {{gasoline}} internal combustion engine, {{and was able to}} move both forward and backward, with two driver positions, one at the front and the other at the back. It was to be equipped with machine guns on raised platforms attached to the <b>compactor</b> chassis: one in front, one in the rear, and two projecting from the sides for 360 degrees coverage. This armament was never actually fitted: the gun shields in the pictures are the result of retouching. The retouched photographs seem to indicate two cannon and six machine guns. Total length was 7 metres, width 2 metres, height 2.3 metres. It weighed a little under 10 tons. It would have been manned by a crew of nine: one commander, two mechanics and six gunners. Speed varied between 3 and 5km/h.|$|E
25|$|There {{are also}} other methods and {{materials}} to create pavements that have appearance of brick pavements. The first method to create brick texture is to heat an asphalt pavement and use metal wires to imprint a brick pattern using a <b>compactor</b> to create stamped asphalt. A similar {{method is to}} use rubber imprinting tools to press over {{a thin layer of}} cement to create decorative concrete. Another method is to use a brick pattern stencil and apply a surfacing material over the stencil. Materials that can be applied to give the color of the brick and skid resistance can be in many forms. An example is to use colored polymer-modified concrete slurry which can be applied by screeding or spraying. Another material is aggregate-reinforced thermoplastic which can be heat applied to the top layer of the brick-pattern surface. Other coating materials over stamped asphalt are paints and two-part epoxy coating.|$|E

25|$|The third {{match was}} between Matt and Jeff Hardy with Lita as the Special Guest Referee. In the beginning, {{the two had}} several {{reversals}} until Matt got in control. Jeff sidestepped when Matt attempted a diving leg drop. Jeff hit a falling headbutt and a clothesline. Jeff went on to deliver a diving leg drop of his own. Jeff went to the top rope but Matt trapped him in a Tree of Woe. Matt then applied the sunset flip, which Jeff countered and both men were lying outside the ring. In the ring, Jeff injured his left knee, which Matt would work on. He hit a chop block {{and a series of}} moves. He tried a powerbomb, but Jeff countered it into a <b>Compactor</b> Clutch. Matt assaulted Jeff again with a Half Boston Crab. Jeff got to the ropes, breaking the hold, and kicked Matt to the outside. Jeff went to the top, but, because of his hurt knee, he fell down. Matt grabbed Jeff's leg but Jeff hit a mule kick. Matt tried a Twist of Fate, but Jeff countered it into a leg drop. Jeff hit a suplex, and went to the top rope again but, because of his knee, Matt took advantage and clutched him. Matt tried to hit a Twist of Fate but Jeff reversed it into his own. Matt attempted a pinfall on Jeff and used ropes for leverage but Lita ordered him to break it. Jeff went to the top rope again, but Matt caught him, and tried to hit him a Twist of Fate from the top. Jeff forced Matt off and hit a Swanton Bomb. Matt tried to get his feet on the ropes, but Jeff pulled them off, and won the match.|$|E
500|$|WALL•E {{proves to}} this {{generation}} {{and beyond that}} the film medium's only true boundaries are the human imagination. Writer/director Andrew Stanton {{and his team have}} created a classic screen character from a metal trash <b>compactor</b> who rides to the rescue of a planet buried in the debris that embodies the broken promise of American life. Not since Chaplin's [...] "Little Tramp" [...] has so much story—so much emotion—been conveyed without words.

500|$|On January 31, 1968, two Memphis {{sanitation}} {{workers were}} crushed {{to death in}} a malfunctioning garbage <b>compactor,</b> prompting the start of the Memphis Sanitation Strike on [...] The mostly black sanitation workers were Memphis's lowest paid civil servants, and received no overtime or holiday pay. Memphis's mayor was now Henry Loeb, a former member of Temple Israel, who converted to Christianity soon after starting his term in 1968, after marrying an Episcopalian woman. He refused to negotiate with the workers, and the strike soon came to national attention as a civil rights issue. After being contacted by black ministers, Wax arranged a meeting on [...] between Loeb, local union leaders, and Jerry Wurf, head of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees. The talks, which continued until [...] on the 19th, and resumed later that day, resolved nothing. Temple Israel member Dreifus used her past support for Loeb in his 1967 mayoralty campaign as a means of trying to force him to resolve the strike, and act as a representative of both white and black Memphians. The strike continued through March. In an attempt to defuse tension, Wax called a meeting of Memphis's two clergy groups, the mostly white Memphis Ministers Association and the black Interdenominational Alliance for [...] The meeting, if anything, had the opposite effect; the black ministers wanted to march immediately on the mayor's office, while most of the white clergy, including Wax, refused to join the march, which they argued would just inflame the white public.|$|E

2500|$|According to Christian, the Millennium Falcon set was {{the most}} {{difficult}} to build. Christian wanted the interior of the Falcon to look like that of a submarine. He found scrap airplane metal [...] "that no one wanted in those days and bought them". He began his creation process by breaking down jet engines into scrap pieces, giving him the chance to [...] "stick it in the sets in specific ways". It took him several weeks to finish the chess set (which he described as [...] "the most encrusted set") in the hold of the Falcon. The garbage <b>compactor</b> set [...] "was also pretty hard, because I knew I had actors in there and the walls had to come in, and they had to be in dirty water and I had to get stuff that would be light enough so it wouldn't hurt them but also not bobbing around". A total of 30 sets consisting of planets, starships, caves, control rooms, cantinas, and the Death Star corridors were created; all of the nine sound stages at Elstree were used to accommodate them. The massive rebel hangar set was housed at a second sound stage at Shepperton Studios; the stage was the largest in Europe at the time.|$|E
60|$|As the Brissago council came {{to realise}} {{that what it}} had {{supposed}} to be temporary camps of refugees were rapidly developing into great towns of a new type, {{and that it was}} remoulding the world in spite of itself, it decided to place this work of redistributing the non-agricultural population {{in the hands of a}} <b>compactor</b> and better qualified special committee. That committee is now, far more than the council of any other of its delegated committees, the active government of the world. Developed from an almost invisible germ of 'town-planning' that came obscurely into existence in Europe or America (the question is still in dispute) somewhere in the closing decades of the nineteenth century, its work, the continual active planning and replanning of the world as a place of human habitation, is now so to speak the collective material activity of the race. The spontaneous, disorderly spreadings and recessions of populations, as aimless and mechanical as the trickling of spilt water, which was the substance of history for endless years, giving rise here to congestions, here to chronic devastating wars, and everywhere to a discomfort and disorderliness that was at its best only picturesque, is at an end. Men spread now, with the whole power of the race to aid them, into every available region of the earth. Their cities are no longer tethered to running water and the proximity of cultivation, their plans are no longer affected by strategic considerations or thoughts of social insecurity. The aeroplane and the nearly costless mobile car have abolished trade routes; a common language and a universal law have abolished a thousand restraining inconveniences, and so an astonishing dispersal of habitations has begun. One may live anywhere. And so it is that our cities now are true social gatherings, each with a character of its own and distinctive interests of its own, and most of them with a common occupation. They lie out in the former deserts, these long wasted sun-baths of the race, they tower amidst eternal snows, they hide in remote islands, and bask on broad lagoons. For a time the whole tendency of mankind was to desert the river valleys in which the race had been cradled for half a million years, but now that the War against Flies has been waged so successfully that this pestilential branch of life is nearly extinct, they are returning thither with a renewed appetite for gardens laced by watercourses, for pleasant living amidst islands and houseboats and bridges, and for nocturnal lanterns reflected by the sea.|$|E
