5|$|Rome's {{control over}} the city ended {{following}} {{the chaos of the}} Crisis of the Third Century, when the empire nearly disintegrated as a series of generals seized and lost power through civil wars, palace coups and assassinations. Around 280, Roman rule collapsed in much of Mauretania and was never re-established.In 285, the emperor Diocletian reorganised {{what was left of the}} province to retain only the coastal strip between Lixus, Tingis and Septa (modern Ceuta). Although a Roman army was based in Tingis, it was decided that it would simply be too expensive to mount a reconquest of a vulnerable border region. Occupation of the city continued, however, as fine mosaics such as that of a chariot race conducted by animals in the House of Venus <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> been created earlier than the fourth century. The end of the Roman city probably came in the form of an earthquake towards the end of the century, which buried numerous bronze statues in the wreckage of the houses.|$|E

2500|$|Logical positivists such as Rudolf Carnap and A. J. Ayer viewed {{any talk}} of gods as literal nonsense. For the logical positivists and adherents of similar schools of thought, {{statements}} about religious or other transcendent experiences <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> a truth value, and are deemed to be without meaning, because such statements {{do not have any}} clear verification criteria. As the Christian biologist Scott C. Todd put it [...] "Even if all the data pointed to an intelligent designer, such a hypothesis is excluded from science because it is not naturalistic." [...] This argument limits the domain of science to the empirically observable and limits the domain of God to the unprovable.|$|E
2500|$|A {{number of}} flaws have been {{identified}} for the statistic, most notable among these {{the fact that a}} bowler who has taken no wickets <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> a bowling average, as dividing by zero does not give a result. The effect of this is that the bowling average can not distinguish between a bowler who has taken no wickets and conceded one run, and a bowler who has taken no wickets and conceded one hundred runs. The bowling average also does not tend to give a true reflection of the bowler's ability when the number of wickets they have taken is small, especially in comparison to the number of runs they have conceded. In his paper proposing an alternative method of judging batsmen and bowlers, Paul van Staden gives an example of this: ...|$|E

This can be verified by the fact that Latin Rōmānī later emerges in Gothic as Rumoneis (that is, Rūmōnīs). It is explained by Ringe {{that at the time of}} borrowing, the vowel matching closest in sound to Latin ā was a Proto-Germanic ā-like vowel (which later became ō). And since Proto-Germanic therefore lacked a mid(-high) back vowel, the closest equivalent of Latin ō was Proto-Germanic ū: Rōmānī > *Rūmānīz > *Rūmōnīz > Gothic Rumoneis.|$|E
