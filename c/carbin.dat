50|$|The {{remainder}} of the year featured a rare F4 tornado in New England that struck along the New York/Massachusetts state border on August 28, killing four people and injuring 36, with F4 damage to a home in West Stockbridge, Massachusetts. An outbreak sequence consisting of several tornado families hit mainly Kansas and Nebraska on September 24-26, with three deaths and almost 60 injuries. At {{the end of the}} year, on December 20, Dade County, Florida, experienced one of its most damaging tornadoes to date when an F2 tornado passed through farmland near Homestead, with $800,000 in contemporary losses. In the United States, 1973 was the most active tornado year up to that time, with over 1,100 confirmed tornadoes. Tornadoes killed 89 people nationwide, which exceeded the annual average of about 60, and there were almost 2,400 injuries. Greg <b>Carbin</b> of the Storm Prediction Center (SPC), upon examining data maintained, concluded that strong El Niño events—as measured by the multivariate ENSO index—may foster better conditions for more tornadoes.|$|E
5000|$|Octocopter is {{the first}} UAV {{developed}} by Morning Wind. The origin of Morning Wind octocopter {{is rooted in the}} need of an indigenous UAV for Morning Wind’s own use. Morning Wind has been using various UAVs of other Chinese UAV developer to perform aerial cinematography and photography missions, however, due to the unique requirements of its mission, none of the UAV used can completely meet all requirements. For example, for the few UAVs that meet all technical requirements, their price tag is too high, but cheaper UAVs cannot meet all technical requirements satisfactorily. Consequently, Morning Wind decided to develop an UAV of its own to meet its own unique set of requirements dictated by the mission. The result is an octocopter that is constructed of <b>carbin</b> fiber composite material, and it is electrically powered. The general designer Mr. Liu Jing (刘静) has incorporated a “return to origin” button in the design for the octocopter, so that when the control is lost, the UAV would automatically return to the take off point and land, based on the GPS coordinate stored. The entire flight path is recorded as soon as take-off, based on the GPS system. Specification: ...|$|E
50|$|Ristie caused one of {{the biggest}} upsets in kickboxing history when he knocked out both Giorgio Petrosyan and Robin van Roosmalen to win the Glory 12: New York - Lightweight World Championship Tournament in New York City, New York, US on November 23, 2013. Against Giorgio Petrosyan in the semi-finals, Ristie applied a lot of {{pressure}} and caused the Italian problems in finding his rhythm, but Petrosyan controlled the first two rounds nonetheless. Going into the third in need of a knockout, Ristie managed just that when he landed a huge right hand that had Petrosyan stunned only for him to follow it up with a combination of a right, left and another left that finished it, becoming the first man to stop Petrosyan and ending his forty-two fight, six year undefeated streak. Riding the wave of momentum that saw him dethrone kickboxing's all-time greatest, Ristie continued his rich vein of form in the final against Robin van Roosmalen, dropping the Dutchman towards the tail end of round one before putting him away in two. Ristie had some problems with his camp in the weeks prior to the tournament, leaving his longtime trainer Lucien <b>Carbin</b> to form his own Team Ristie.|$|E
50|$|When {{it comes}} to beaches and coastal resorts within the region, the most popular ones are Lakawon Island in Cadiz City, Jomabo Island in Escalante City, Sipaway/Refugio Island {{in the city of}} San Carlos, Sipalay City, Hinoba-an and Manjuyod's sand bar. The top attractions in Cauayan are the Punta Bulata White Beach Resort and Danjugan Island, which serves as a major diving spot in Negros Occidental. Also, a marine reserve is {{established}} in Sagay City, which protects the marine life and reefs of <b>Carbin</b> and Maca, making it a popular draw for marine life enthusiasts. Dauin is known for its beach resorts and Apo Island, a famous diving spot and marine reserve in Negros Oriental. The city of Dumaguete is popular amongst students, largely because of its presence as a university city in the region. Bais City has since then become a tourist spot for whale and dolphin watching, due to its coastline touching the Tañon Strait. Antulang Beach Resort and Tambobo Bay, as well as the inland Lake Balanan serve as three important attractions in the town of Siaton. Situated within the towns of Sibulan, San Jose and Valencia is the Balinsasayao Twin Lakes Natural Park, which serves as an important draw for tourists going to inland Negros Oriental.|$|E
40|$|To {{restore the}} {{diminishing}} {{population of the}} giant clam Tridacna gigas in Sagay Marine Reserve (SMR), Negros Occidental, central Philippines, two size classes [8 - and 10 -cm shell length (SL) ] of hatchery-bred T. gigas were reared in an adjacent ocean nursery for restocking to <b>Carbin</b> Reef later upon reaching grow-out size of â‰¥ 20 cm SL. Growth rates did not significantly differ for both sizes and were on average 0. 67 cm month âˆ’ 1. However, survival after 382 days of rearing T. gigas was significantly higher in the 10 -cm SL clams than the 8 -cm SL clams (96 and 83 %, respectively). For future restocking projects, the use of 8 -cm SL clams is recommended because the lower survival of this size class is compensated by its cheaper price. While rearing the clams to attain grow-out size, the population of wild clams (Family Tridacnidae) in <b>Carbin</b> Reef was assessed using ten 50 Ã— 2 -m belt transects. Four species of tridacnid clams have been recorded: Hippopus hippopus, Tridacna crocea, T. maxima>, and T. squamosa. T. crocea comprised 12. 5 â€“ 93. 9 % of all the clams observed in all ten transects. There {{was a significant difference}} in clam density between species (ANOVA, F = 6. 94, P < 0. 001), with T. crocea having the highest density. Living T. gigas were absent, but presence of dead shells was indicative of its presence in the reef in the past. It can be expected that the release of hatchery-bred T. gigas juveniles in <b>Carbin</b> Reef could provide future breeders that will repopulate this reef and the adjacent reef communities. This project was funded by the SEAFDEC/AQD (Budget Code 5205 -T-RD-FS 0106) and the Government of Japan Trust Fund (Budget Code 8100 -T-FD-FS 0106).

It is composed from generic vocabularies derived from Scandinavian and other references, and is demonstrated by a study for a health retreat at Poland Spring, Maine. The site and program were teamed on t he premise that communion with the landscape can develop, for the willing user, awareness to holistic health. Structural elements were deployed to signal the nature of places, such as circulation, shelter or exposure. The site is organized into receiving, athletic, treatment and retreat clusters. At both building and site size, they range from containment to openness as appropriate for Maine's variable climate. by Julie Patricia <b>Carbin.</b> Thesis (M. Arch.)

40|$|Tridacna crocea is the {{smallest}} among the eight species of Family Tridacnidae and the most abundant tridacnids in reefs around the Philippine archipelago. This investigation describes the characteristic mantle pattern and color of T. crocea and correlates them to genetic structure; verifies the characteristic mantle color and pattern of T. crocea underwater and differentiates it from its closely related species, T. maxima in the field. Tissue samples of Tridacna crocea and T. maxima were collected and preserved in 95 % alcohol. Prior to any mantle collection, each clam was photographed. Thirteen mantle patterns were identified from the 174 Tridacna crocea individuals of six reef areas: Pamilacan, Tanon Strait, <b>Carbin,</b> Camiguin, Southeastern Samar and Spratlys. Results revealed that Tridacna crocea can be distinguished from T. maxima in the field by the appearance and arrangement of their hyaline organs. Moreover, analysis on genotype-phenotype correlation using the T. crocea mantle morphology/color, found no significant relationship between the mantle morphs and genetic structure of the individuals...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} recent {{progress on}} materials modelling and numerical simulation {{of the impact}} response of fibre reinforced composite structures. A continuum damage mechanics model for fabric reinforced composites is developed as a framework within which both in-ply and delamination failure may be modelled during impact loading. Damage evolution equations are derived and appropriate materials parameters determined from experiments. The model for in-plane failure has been implemented in a commercial explicit finite element code, and new techniques are used to model the laminate as a stack of shell elements tied via contact interface conditions. The code is applied to predict the response of <b>carbin</b> fabric reinforced epoxy plates impacted at different velocities by a steel impactor. A comparison of structural response and failure modes from numerical simulations and impact tests is given which shows a good agreement for the prediction of delamination damage at low impact energies and fracture and penetration at higher impact energies...|$|E
40|$|The {{large size}} of modern {{software}} systems {{has led to}} an increase in the complexity of the interaction between a system's code, its input, and its output. I propose the following classifications for the regions of a system's input: * Critical control: data that influences the internal operation and output of the system. * Critical payload: data that heavily contributes to the output of the program but does not substantially influence the internal operation of the program. * Benign control: data that influences the internal operation of the system, but does not contribute to the output of the system. * Benign payload: data that neither contributes to the output nor substantially influences the internal operation of the program. In this thesis, I present Chaos, a system designed to automatically infer these classifications for a program's inputs and code. Chaos monitors the execution trace and dynamic taint trace of an application over a suite of inputs to determine how regions of the programs' code and input influence its behavior and output. This thesis demonstrates the accuracy of Chaos's classifications for a set of imaging applications and their support libraries. These automatically inferred classifications are relevant to a variety of software engineering tasks, including program understanding, maintenance, debugging, testing, and defect correction triage. by Michael <b>Carbin.</b> Thesis (S.

40|$|Improving program {{performance}} and resilience are long-standing goals. Traditional approaches include {{a variety of}} transformation, compilation, and runtime techniques that share the common property that the resulting program has the same semantics as the original program. However, researchers have recently proposed {{a variety of new}} techniques that set aside this traditional restriction and instead exploit opportunities to change the semantics of programs to improve performance and resilience. Techniques include skipping portions of a program's computation, selecting different implementations of program's subcomputations, executing programs on unreliable hardware, and synthesizing values to enable programs to skip or execute through otherwise fatal errors. A major barrier to the acceptance these techniques in both the broader research community and in industrial practice is the challenge that the resulting programs may exhibit behaviors that differ from that of the original program, potentially jeopardizing the program's resilience, safety, and accuracy. This thesis presents the first general programming systems for precisely verifying and reasoning about the programs that result from these techniques. This thesis presents a programming language and program logic for verifying worst-case properties of a transformed program. Specifically the framework, enables verifying that a transformed program satisfies important assertions about its safety (e. g., that it does not access invalid memory) and accuracy (e. g., that it returns a result within a bounded distance of that of the original program). This thesis also presents a programming language and automated analysis for verifying a program's quantitative reliability - the probability the transformed program returns the same result as the original program - when executed on unreliable hardware. The results of this thesis, which include programming languages, program logics, program analysis, and applications thereof, present the first steps toward reaping the benefits of changing the semantics of programs in a beneficial yet principled way. by Michael James <b>Carbin.</b> Thesis: Ph.
