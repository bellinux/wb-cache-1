It is colored white to buff, with weakly developed spiral bands and several flame-like, purple-brown axial stripes.

25|$|Intertidal {{organisms are}} also {{especially}} prone to desiccation {{during periods of}} emersion. Again, mobile organisms avoid desiccation {{in the same way}} as they avoid extreme temperatures: by hunkering down in mild and moist refuges. Many intertidal organisms, including Littorina snails, prevent water loss by having waterproof outer surfaces, pulling completely into their shells, and sealing shut their shell opening. Limpets (Patella) do not use such a sealing plate but occupy a home-scar to which they seal the lower edge of their flattened <b>conical</b> <b>shell</b> using a grinding action. They return to this home-scar after each grazing excursion, typically just before emersion. On soft rocks, these scars are quite obvious. Still other organisms, such as the algae Ulva and Porphyra, are able to rehydrate and recover after periods of severe desiccation.|$|E
25|$|Mausoleums {{were rarely}} built as {{free-standing}} structures after the 14th century, being instead often attached to madrasas in pairs. Domes of these madrasas, {{such as those}} of the madrasa of Goharshad (1417–1433) and the madrasa at Ḵargerd (1436–1443), had dramatically innovative interiors. They used intersecting arches to support an inner dome narrower than the floor below, a change that may have originated with the 14th century use of small lantern domes over transverse vaulting. The madrasa of Goharshad is also the first triple-shell dome. The middle dome may have been added as reinforcement. Triple-shelled domes are rare outside of the Timurid era. The dome of the Amir Chakhmaq mosque (1437) has a semi-circular inner shell and an advanced system of stiffeners and wooden struts supporting a shallow pointed outer shell. Notably, the dome has a circular drum with two tiers. Another double shell dome from the early Seljuq period at the shrine complex of Bayazid Bastami was changed in the Timurid period by the addition of a third <b>conical</b> <b>shell</b> over the existing two domed shells.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{sensitivity}} of laminated <b>conical</b> <b>shells</b> to imperfection is considered, via the initial post-buckling analysis, {{on the basis}} of three different shell theories: Donnell’s, Sanders’, and Timoshenko’s. Unlike isotropic <b>conical</b> <b>shells</b> or laminated cylindrical shells, in the case of laminated <b>conical</b> <b>shells</b> the thickness and the material properties vary with the shell coordinates, which complicates the problem considerably. The main objective of the study is to investigate the influence of the variation of the stiffness coefficients on the buckling behavior and on the imperfection {{sensitivity of}} laminated <b>conical</b> <b>shells.</b> It is felt that by finding the various parameters that influence the shell’s imperfection sensitivity, it is possible to improve the behavior of the whole structure. A special Level- 1 computer code ISOLCS (Imperfection Sensitivity of Laminated <b>Conical</b> <b>Shells)</b> had been developed. ISOLCS calculates the classical buckling load and the imperfection sensitivity via Koiter’s theory of laminated <b>conical</b> <b>shells</b> with consideration to the variation of the material properties in the shell’s coordinates. The range of validity of the Level- 1 predictions by ISOLCS is verified by the Level- 3 code STAGS-A...|$|R

2500|$|Orthalicus reses is a snail with a large, <b>conical</b> <b>shell</b> that is {{approximately}} 45 to 55mm in length. The {{thickness of the}} shell varies, but is usually more lightweight and translucent than other species of Orthalicus. [...] The external ground color of the shell is white to buff, with three poorly developed spiral bands and several flame-like purple-brown axial stripes that stop at the lower of the spiral bands. The axial stripes are typically narrower than their whitish interspaces and do not fork near the upper suture. There are two to three white apical whorls. The last whorl contains two to four darker brown growth-rest varices. The columella and parietal callus are white or faint chestnut brown.|$|E

40|$|Composite <b>conical</b> and {{cylindrical}} <b>shells</b> {{are gaining}} more application in aerospace industry (e. g., helicopter tailboom, airplane fuselage) {{due to their}} high specific strength and stiffness properties coming from material (composite) and geometry advantages. Stability is always a concern for these types of structures under different loading conditions. One of the major loading scenarios is the bending load in which composite <b>conical</b> <b>shells</b> can buckle under bending. Although there have been extensive studies on the buckling of <b>conical</b> and cylindrical <b>shells</b> under axial load, buckling under bending receives less attention in the literature from theoretical and experimental points of view. In this study, the bucking behavior of composite <b>conical</b> <b>shells</b> has been studied experimentally and theoretically. In the theoretical approach, a first order shear deformation shell theory has been proposed to study buckling and bending behavior of composite <b>conical</b> <b>shells.</b> A semi-analytical approach (Ritz method) {{has been applied to}} study buckling under axial load and buckling under bending of composite <b>conical</b> <b>shells.</b> An analytical solution (Levy type solution) has been applied to study the bending response of cross-ply <b>conical</b> <b>shells</b> under sinusoidal bending load. Also, a new formulation has been proposed to study bending, buckling and vibration of cross-ply cylindrical shells using an analytical solution (Levy type solution). A different displacement field from what was assumed in the literature has been proposed and consequently a new formulation has been obtained for the problem. In the experimental approach, a composite tube-bending setup has been designed and developed to study bending, and buckling under bending load, behavior of composite shells. The setup has been designed to apply equal bending moments at the both ends of the structure, simulating pure bending test conditions. Experimental result has been obtained for buckling under pure bending of composite <b>conical</b> <b>shells.</b> Regarding the manufacturing technique, Automated Fiber Placement (AFP) has attracted the aerospace industry due to its fast production rate, repeatability, and minimum material waste. Advanced thermoplastic composites obtain special attention in the aerospace industry as well, considering their superior properties (e. g., fracture toughness) and their capability to make aero-structures without requiring autoclave treatment with respect to thermoset ones. Considerable challenges remained unresolved regarding optimum process parameters for manufacturing of thermoplastic composites made by AFP and their quality. This thesis also addresses the effect of autoclave treatment on the stiffness quality of the thermoplastic composite cones made by AFP. The determination of optimum process parameters for AFP in the manufacturing of thermoplastic composite (AS 4 /PEEK) has been performed from both stiffness and strength point of view. ...|$|R
