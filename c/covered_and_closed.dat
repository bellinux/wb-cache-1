60|$|It {{was indeed}} one admirable piece of conduct in the said magistrates, that {{the streets were}} kept {{constantly}} clear and free from all manner of frightful objects, dead bodies, or any such things as were indecent or unpleasant; unless where anybody fell down suddenly, or died in the streets, as I have said above, and these were generally covered with some cloth or blanket, or removed into the next churchyard till night. All the needful works that carried terror with them, that were both dismal and dangerous, were done in the night. If any diseased bodies were removed, or dead bodies buried, or infected clothes burned, {{it was done in}} the night; and all the bodies which were thrown into the great pits in the several churchyards or burying grounds, as has been observed, were so removed in the night, and everything was <b>covered</b> <b>and</b> <b>closed</b> before day. So that in the daytime there was not the least signal of the calamity to be seen or heard of, except what was to be observed from the emptiness of the streets, and sometimes from the passionate outcries and lamentations of the people, out at their windows, and from the numbers of houses and shops shut up.|$|E

40|$|International audienceBACKGROUND:Tobacco {{smoking is}} {{the main cause of}} death among mentally ill persons. Since February 2007, smoking has been {{strictly}} forbidden in French <b>covered</b> <b>and</b> <b>closed</b> psychiatric wards. The fear of an increased violence risk induced by tobacco withdrawal {{is one of the most}} frequent arguments invoked against this tobacco ban. According to the literature, it seems that the implementation of this ban does not imply such a risk. All these studies compared inpatients' violence risk before and after the tobacco ban in a same psychiatric ward. AIM:We aimed to analyse the strict tobacco withdrawal consequences on the violence risk in a retrospective study including patients hospitalised in a psychiatric intensive care unit of the university hospital of Caen during the same period. METHODS:We compared clinical and demographic data and the violence risk between the smoker group (strict tobacco withdrawal with proposed tobacco substitution) and the non-smoker group (control group). In order to evaluate the violence risk, we used three indicators: a standardised scale (the Bröset Violence Checklist) and two assessments specific to the psychiatric intensive care setting ("the preventing risk protocol" and the "seclusion time"). The clinical and demographic data were compared using the Khi 2 test, Fisher test and Mann-Whitney test, and the three violence risk indicators were compared with the Mann-Whitney test. Firstly, comparisons were conducted in the total population, and secondly (in order to eliminate a bias of tobacco substitution) in the subgroup directly hospitalised in the psychiatric intensive care setting. Finally, we analysed in the smoker group the statistical correlation between tobacco smoking intensity and violence risk intensity using a regression test. RESULTS:A population of 72 patients (50 male) was included; 45 were smokers (62. 5 %) and 27 non-smokers. No statistically significant differences were found in clinical and demographic data between smoker and non-smoker groups in the whole population, as well as in the subgroup directly hospitalised in the psychiatric intensive care setting. Whatever the violence risk indicators, no statistically significant difference was found between the smoker group and the non-smoker group in the total population, as well as the subgroup directly hospitalised in the psychiatric intensive care setting. Moreover, no correlation was found between the tobacco smoking intensity and the violence risk intensity in the smoker group. CONCLUSION:Strict tobacco withdrawal does not appear to constitute a violence risk factor in psychiatric intensive care unit inpatients. However, further studies are needed to confirm these results. They should be prospective and they should take into account larger samples including patients hospitalised in non-intensive care psychiatric wards...|$|E

40|$|A built {{environment}} is psychosocially supportive, when its quality can strengthen or sustain {{the ability of}} an individual to perform his/her role, conduct him-/herself in society, and communicate or interact with others in accordance to his/her values, interest, and self-concept. The aim of this thesis was to investigate potential methods in design and re-design for identification, visualization, and evaluation of such environmental qualities. The thesis {{is divided into two}} main theoretical approaches of psychosocial supportiveness. The first approach, the psychoevolutionary, postulates that stress-related anticipation, negative evaluation, and harm as well as emotion and aesthetics affect the individual. Finding a methodology which reveals all these factors in terms of environmental qualities was one of the objectives of {{the first part of the}} thesis. An Empowering Environment Evaluation (Triple-E) tool was developed and tested in a hospital, a health care facility, and a railway operational environment. Initially, the Triple-E was a combination of a structured brainstorming session, a semantic environmental description, and an architectural aesthetical preference measure. The results of these building performance measures indicated, that participants' opinions about the negative environmental aspects with respect to psychosocial supportiveness were somewhat difficult to grasp. Nevertheless, the Triple-E tool provided sufficient information about the psychosocial qualities of the indoor environments to generate design scenarios. These scenarios were constructed using a research-based design model. The evaluation of the design scenarios showed that, overall, the indoor components like artificial light and windows appeared to be the most psychosocially supportive entities. The second approach, the attention restoration theory, postulates that an environment is psychosocially supportive when restoration of depleted mental resources can be achieved through four constructs (being away, extent, fascination, and compatibility). To detect restoration supportive environmental qualities, the architectural aesthetical preferences questionnaire was modified to be sensitive on restoration (the Built Environment Restoration Support (BERS)). Two studies were conducted, one in Sweden and one in the Netherlands. The aim of these was to identify, visualize, and evaluate restorative supportiveness. While the Swedish study was a CAD-based visualization, the Dutch study was a real environment. The framework for designing both scenarios originates from the perceptual model of Brunswik (1956). The combination of the most frequent distal and proximal cues provided the criteria for the restorative design scenarios. As a conclusion, environmental components such as carpets (Persian carpet, dark and thick, single color), windows (many and large), and doors (<b>covered</b> <b>and</b> <b>closed)</b> as well as view (a nice open garden with a lawn and a pond) and natural light (a lot of daylight and candle) might be some architectural details which facilitates restoration and, thus, psychosocial supportiveness in the indoor environment. The two theoretical approaches resulted in design scenarios and in both similar environmental components were identified in relation to psychosocial supportiveness. These common environmental features indicated freedom/control through the natural and artificial light and openings as well as safety/security through walls, floor, and ceiling. This duality of experience of psychosocial supportiveness in the indoor environment is possible to trace back to the very basic human instincts of survival in terms of escaping and shelter. Further exploration of psychosocial supportiveness in design is needed. As a scenario, the combination of the two theories into a process continuum with enhanced relations to indoor environmental details might be a clear application model for design professionals.

At the end of the Sicilian campaign the entire group was transferred to Twelfth Air Force, and the pilots received a brief respite from combat. The 316th was given the job of training newly arrived pilots in all the subtleties of combat. The men began to chafe under this mundane unexciting duty, and they welcomed orders alerting the squadron for transfer to Italy.|$|R

The deck was covered in motorcycles, cars and trucks earmarked for the Afrika Korps. Wanklyn ordered a boarding party to loot whatever they could and lay scuttling charges, which blew up the ship. He elected to leave the destroyer, which lay in much shallower water, until the following day.
