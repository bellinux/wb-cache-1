5|$|Symptoms of Huntington's disease most {{commonly}} become noticeable {{between the ages}} of 35 and 44years, but they can begin at any age from infancy to old age. In the early stages, there are subtle changes in personality, cognition, and physical skills. The physical symptoms are usually the first to be noticed, as <b>cognitive</b> <b>and</b> <b>behavioral</b> symptoms are generally not severe enough to be recognized on their own at the earlier stages. Almost everyone with Huntington's disease eventually exhibits similar physical symptoms, but the onset, progression and extent of <b>cognitive</b> <b>and</b> <b>behavioral</b> symptoms vary significantly between individuals.|$|E

5|$|Outcome {{is related}} to the extent and {{duration}} of lead exposure. Effects of lead on the physiology of the kidneys and blood are generally reversible; its effects on the central nervous system are not. While peripheral effects in adults often go away when lead exposure ceases, evidence suggests that most of lead's effects on a child's central nervous system are irreversible. Children with lead poisoning may thus have adverse health, <b>cognitive,</b> <b>and</b> <b>behavioral</b> effects that follow them into adulthood.|$|E

25|$|Educational {{psychology}} is {{the branch of}} psychology concerned with {{the scientific study of}} human learning. The study of learning processes, from both <b>cognitive</b> <b>and</b> <b>behavioral</b> perspectives, allows researchers to understand individual differences in intelligence, cognitive development, affect, motivation, self-regulation, and self-concept, as well as their role in learning. The field of educational psychology relies heavily on quantitative methods, including testing and measurement, to enhance educational activities related to instructional design, classroom management, and assessment, which serve to facilitate learning processes in various educational settings across the lifespan.|$|E

25|$|Parkinson's {{disease is}} a common {{neurological}} disorder characterized by a degeneration of dopamine neurons in the substantia nigra {{and a loss of}} dopamine in the putamen. It is described as a motor disease, but it also produces <b>cognitive</b> <b>and</b> <b>behavioral</b> symptoms. The most common treatment is dopamine replacement therapy, which consists in the administration of levodopa (L-Dopa) or dopamine agonists (such as pramipexole or ropinirole) to patients. Dopamine replacement therapy is well known to improve motor symptoms but its effects in <b>cognitive</b> <b>and</b> <b>behavioral</b> symptoms are more complex. Dopamine has been related to the normal learning of stimuli with behavioral and motivational significance, attention, and most importantly the reward system. In accordance with the role of dopamine in reward processing, addictive drugs stimulate dopamine release. Although the exact mechanism has yet to be elucidated, the role of dopamine in the reward system and addiction has been proposed as the origin of DDS. Models of addiction have been used to explain how dopamine replacement therapy produces DDS. One of these models of addiction proposes that over the usage course of a drug there is a habituation to the rewarding that it produces at the initial stages. This habituation is thought to be dopamine mediated. With long-term administration of L-dopa the reward system gets used to it and needs higher quantities. As the user increases drug intake there is a loss of dopaminergic receptors in the striatum which acts in addition to an impairment in goal-direction mental functions to produce an enhancement of sensitization to dopamine therapy. The behavioral and mood symptoms of the syndrome are produced by the dopamine overdose.|$|E
25|$|Norrie {{disease can}} also have <b>cognitive</b> <b>and</b> <b>behavioral</b> symptoms. Developmental delay and mental {{retardation}} are present in about 30 to 50% of males who have Norrie disease. Psychotic-like features and poorly characterized behavior abnormalities may also be present. Auditory symptoms are common with Norrie disease. Progressive hearing loss starts in early childhood {{for a majority of}} males with the condition. Early hearing loss is sensorineural, mild and asymmetric. By adolescence, high-frequency hearing loss begins to appear. Hearing loss is severe, symmetric, and broad-spectrum by the age of 35. However, studies show that while the hearing loss is deteriorating, the ability to speak well is highly preserved. The slowly progressing hearing loss is more problematic to adjust to than the congenital blindness for most people with Norrie disease.|$|E
25|$|The {{first line}} {{treatment}} for social anxiety disorder is cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) with medications recommended only in {{those who are not}} interested in therapy. CBT is effective in treating social phobia, whether delivered individually or in a group setting. The <b>cognitive</b> <b>and</b> <b>behavioral</b> components seek to change thought patterns and physical reactions to anxiety-inducing situations. The attention given to social anxiety disorder has significantly increased since 1999 with the approval and marketing of drugs for its treatment. Prescribed medications include several classes of antidepressants: selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), and monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs). Other commonly used medications include beta blockers and benzodiazepines. It is the most common anxiety disorder with up to 10% of people being affected {{at some point in their}} life.|$|E

25|$|Some {{disorders}} cause a {{wide array}} of affects, and language impairment is merely one of many possible symptoms. The two major disorders of this type are the autism spectrum disorders and epilepsy. Autism and other autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are disorders in which the patient suffers from decreased social skills and lowered mental flexibility. As a result, many patients suffering ASDs also have language problems, arising from both the lack of social interaction and lowered mental flexibility. Epilepsy is a disorder where electrical malfunctions or mis-communications in the brain cause seizures, leading to muscle spasms and activation of other organs and systems of the body. Over time, epilepsy can lead to <b>cognitive</b> <b>and</b> <b>behavioral</b> decay. This mental decay can eventually lead to a loss of language and communication skills.|$|E
25|$|Mind in the ToK system {{refers to}} the set of mental {{behaviors}}. Mental behaviors are behaviors of animals mediated by the nervous system that produce a functional effect on the animal-environment relationship. As such, Mind is essentially synonymous with what behavioral psychologists have meant when they use the term behavior. Thus, a fly avoiding a fly swatter, a rat pushing a bar or a human getting {{a drink of water}} are all mental behaviors. Mind is not synonymous with sentience or the capacity for mental experience, although such processes are presumed to emerge in the mental dimension. Cognition, in the broad sense of the term (i.e., as meaning neuro-information processing) is seen as covert mental behavior, whereas change between the animal and the environment is defined as overt mental behavior. Thus, by defining mind as mental behavior, Henriques argues that the ToK System provides a way to bridge the epistemological differences between <b>cognitive</b> <b>and</b> <b>behavioral</b> science.|$|E
