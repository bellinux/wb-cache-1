5|$|<b>Carboxypeptidase</b> cleaves peptide {{linkages}} during digestion of proteins. A coordinate {{covalent bond}} is formed between the terminal peptide and a C=O group attached to zinc, {{which gives the}} carbon a positive charge. This helps to create a hydrophobic pocket on the enzyme near the zinc, which attracts the non-polar part of the protein being digested.|$|E
5|$|The {{non-magnetic}} {{character of}} zinc and {{its lack of}} color in solution delayed discovery of its importance to biochemistry and nutrition. This changed in 1940 when carbonic anhydrase, an enzyme that scrubs carbon dioxide from blood, was shown to have zinc in its active site. The digestive enzyme <b>carboxypeptidase</b> became the second known zinc-containing enzyme in 1955.|$|E
25|$|Detyrosination: {{the removal}} of the C-terminal {{tyrosine}} from alpha-tubulin. This reaction exposes a glutamate at the new C-terminus. As a result, microtubules that accumulate this modification are often referred to as Glu-microtubules. Although the tubulin <b>carboxypeptidase</b> has yet to be identified, the tubulin—tyrosine ligase (TTL) is known.|$|E
40|$|The {{silkworm}} (Bombyx mori) is an economically-important insect {{that can}} secrete silk. <b>Carboxypeptidases</b> {{have been found}} in various metazoan species and play important roles in physiological and biochemical reactions. Here, we analyzed the silkworm genome database and characterized 48 <b>carboxypeptidases,</b> including 34 metal <b>carboxypeptidases</b> (BmMCP 1 –BmMCP 34) and 14 serine <b>carboxypeptidases</b> (BmSCP 1 –BmSCP 14), to better understand their diverse functions. Compared to other insects, our results indicated that <b>carboxypeptidases</b> from silkworm have more family members. These silkworm <b>carboxypeptidases</b> could be divided into four families: Peptidase_M 2 <b>carboxypeptidases,</b> Peptidase_M 14 <b>carboxypeptidases,</b> Peptidase_S 10 <b>carboxypeptidases</b> and Peptidase_S 28 <b>carboxypeptidases.</b> Microarray analysis showed that the <b>carboxypeptidases</b> had distinct expression patterns, whereas quantitative real-time PCR demonstrated that the expression level of 13 <b>carboxypeptidases</b> significantly decreased after starvation and restored after re-feeding. Overall, our study provides new insights into the functional and evolutionary features of silkworm <b>carboxypeptidases...</b>|$|R

30|$|<b>Carboxypeptidases</b> are exopeptidases that hydrolyze peptide bonds {{from the}} C-terminus of {{peptides}} or proteins. They {{function in a}} variety of physiological processes such as fibrinolysis, inflammation, blood coagulation, and prohormone and neuropeptide processing (Arolas et al. 2007; Vendrell et al. 2000). They {{can also be used to}} decrease the bitterness of peptides in food industries (Fu et al. 2011; Ge and Zhang 1996; Komai et al. 2007; Umetsu et al. 1983). According to the presence of particular active site residues, <b>carboxypeptidases</b> are classified as metallocarboxypeptidases, serine <b>carboxypeptidases,</b> or cysteine <b>carboxypeptidases.</b> Among them, metallocarboxypeptidases possess a conserved active site motif, (HXXE……H) or (HEXXH), which requires their binding to divalent metal ions for activity (Lee et al. 1996). To date, there are few reports concerning the characterization of metallocarboxypeptidase from the genus Streptomyces. Using genome data from S. cinnamoneus TH- 2, we succeed in expressing and characterizing a novel metallocarboxypeptidase, TH 2 -CP. TH 2 -CP shows broad substrate specificity, with a preference for hydrophobic amino acids.|$|R
25|$|Proteases are {{involved}} in digesting long protein chains into shorter fragments by splitting the peptide bonds that link amino acid residues. Some detach the terminal amino acids from the protein chain (exopeptidases, such as aminopeptidases, <b>carboxypeptidase</b> A); others attack internal peptide bonds of a protein (endopeptidases, such as trypsin, chymotrypsin, pepsin, papain, elastase).|$|E
25|$|The {{tissue samples}} are then {{examined}} {{under a microscope}} to determine whether cancer cells are present, and to evaluate the microscopic features (or Gleason score) of any cancer found. Prostate specific membrane antigen is a transmembrane <b>carboxypeptidase</b> and exhibits folate hydrolase activity. This protein is overexpressed in prostate cancer tissues and {{is associated with a}} higher Gleason score.|$|E
25|$|Coordination {{compounds}} have uses in both {{nature and}} in industry. Coordination compounds {{are vital to}} many living organisms. For example, many enzymes are metal complexes, like <b>carboxypeptidase,</b> a hydrolytic enzyme important in digestion. This enzyme consists of a zinc ion surrounded by many amino acid residues. Another complex ion enzyme is catalase, which decomposes the cell's waste hydrogen peroxide. This enzyme contains iron-porphyrin complexes, {{similar to those of}} heme in the hemoglobin molecule. Chlorophyll contains a magnesium-porphyrin complexes (chlorin), and vitamin B12 is a complex with cobalt and corrin.|$|E
50|$|<b>Carboxypeptidases</b> {{are usually}} {{classified}} {{into one of}} several families based on their active site mechanism.|$|R
5000|$|Other <b>carboxypeptidases</b> {{that use}} active site serine {{residues}} are called [...] "serine carboxypeptidases" [...] (EC number 3.4.16).|$|R
40|$|AbstractCarboxypeptidase {{activity}} was studied in subcellular fractions from a transplantable rat insulinoma {{and found to}} be localised principally in the insulin secretory granule. The activity, which was specific for peptide substrates with C-terminal basic amino acids, {{appeared to be a}} single enzyme with Mr 54 000. This enzyme differed with respect to size and pH optimum from other basic amino acid-specific <b>carboxypeptidases,</b> such as <b>carboxypeptidases</b> B and N, and may be a secretory granule-specific enzyme involved in propolypeptide processing...|$|R
25|$|BPFs {{are members}} of a family of {{peptides}} whose potentiating action is linked to inhibition of bradykinin by ACE. Molecular analysis of BPF yielded a nonapeptide BPF teprotide (SQ 20,881), which showed the greatest ACE inhibition potency and hypotensive effect in vivo. Teprotide had limited clinical value {{as a result of its}} peptide nature and lack of activity when given orally. In the early 1970s, knowledge of the structure-activity relationship required for inhibition of ACE was growing. David Cushman, Miguel Ondetti and colleagues used peptide analogues to study the structure of ACE, using <b>carboxypeptidase</b> A as a model. Their discoveries led to the development of captopril, the first orally-active ACE inhibitor, in 1975.|$|E
25|$|The POMC gene {{is located}} on {{chromosome}} 2p23.3. The POMC gene is expressed in both the anterior and intermediate lobes of the pituitary gland. This gene encodes a 285-amino acid polypeptide hormone precursor that undergoes extensive, tissue-specific, post-translational processing via cleavage by subtilisin-like enzymes known as prohormone convertases. The encoded protein is synthesized mainly in corticotroph cells of the anterior pituitary, where four cleavage sites are used; adrenocorticotrophin (ACTH), essential for normal steroidogenesis {{and the maintenance of}} normal adrenal weight, and β-lipotropin are the major end-products. However, there are at least eight potential cleavage sites within the polypeptide precursor and, depending on tissue type and the available convertases, processing may yield as many as ten biologically active peptides involved in diverse cellular functions. Cleavage sites consist of the sequences Arg-Lys, Lys-Arg, or Lys-Lys. Enzymes responsible for processing of POMC peptides include prohormone convertase 1 (PC1), prohormone convertase 2 (PC2), <b>carboxypeptidase</b> E (CPE), peptidyl α-amidating monooxygenase (PAM), N-acetyltransferase (N-AT), and prolylcarboxypeptidase (PRCP).|$|E
500|$|Zinc is an {{efficient}} Lewis acid, {{making it a}} useful catalytic agent in hydroxylation and other enzymatic reactions. The metal also has a flexible coordination geometry, which allows proteins using it to rapidly shift conformations to perform biological reactions. Two examples of zinc-containing enzymes are carbonic anhydrase and <b>carboxypeptidase,</b> which are vital to the processes of carbon dioxide (...) regulation and digestion of proteins, respectively.|$|E

500|$|... virus {{primarily}} {{interferes with}} {{the functions of the}} liver by replicating in hepatocytes. A functional receptor is NTCP. There is evidence that the receptor in the closely related duck hepatitis B virus is <b>carboxypeptidase</b> D. The virions bind to the host cell via the preS domain of the viral surface antigen and are subsequently internalized by endocytosis. HBV-preS-specific receptors are expressed primarily on hepatocytes; however, viral DNA and proteins have also been detected in extrahepatic sites, suggesting that cellular receptors for HBV may also exist on extrahepatic cells.|$|E
500|$|On December 2, 1957, at Yale University, Richards {{performed}} a simple experiment on the protein Ribonuclease A (RNase A) that helped change the scientific community's {{view of the}} physical nature of protein molecules. Using a particular protease (Subtilisin), RNase A was converted into a split protein (RNase S), which is composed of two parts called S-peptide and S-protein (...) [...] Richards had developed that cleavage system as a postdoc at the Carlsberg Laboratory in Copenhagen, Denmark, using purified ribonuclease protein that had been donated to Christian Anfinsen by the Armour Company and that Anfinsen shared with Richards and other researchers. Richards found that, when separated, S-protein and S-peptide had no RNase activity, but that the RNase enzymatic activity was restored when the parts were recombined in the test tube. In an autobiographical piece, Richards wrote that [...] "this discovery {{came as a surprise}} to the scientific community at that time.... In retrospect, this may have been the high point of my career in terms of excitement." [...] This experiment showed that proteins maintain 3-dimensional order and tight binding between their interacting parts and that the structural information is inherent in the protein itself, foreshadowing both Anfinsen's later work showing that sequence determines structure and also the idea that hormones or other small molecules can bind tightly and specifically to proteins, a concept basic to how pharmaceutical companies design drugs today. Two years later, the protein structure of myoglobin confirmed such specific 3D relationships. [...] Later, with Marilyn Doscher and Flo Quiocho, Richards demonstrated that ribonuclease S as well as <b>carboxypeptidase</b> were enzymatically active in the crystals, important evidence to silence doubts that the conformations of proteins in crystals are directly relevant to their biological activity in cells.|$|E

40|$|Serine <b>carboxypeptidases</b> {{contain a}} conserved {{catalytic}} triad of serine, histidine, and aspartic acid active-site residues. These enzymes cleave the peptide {{bond between the}} penultimate and C-terminal amino acid residues of their protein or peptide substrates. The Arabidopsis Genome Initiative has revealed that the Arabidopsis genome encodes numerous proteins with homology to serine <b>carboxypeptidases.</b> Although many of these proteins {{may be involved in}} protein turnover or processing, the role of virtually all of these serine carboxypeptidase-like (SCPL) proteins in plant metabolism is unknown. We previously identified an Arabidopsis mutant, sng 1 (sinapoylglucose accumulator 1), that is defective in synthesis of sinapoylmalate, one of the major phenylpropanoid secondary metabolites accumulated by Arabidopsis and some other members of the Brassicaceae. We have cloned the gene that is defective in sng 1 and have found that it encodes a SCPL protein. Expression of SNG 1 in Escherichia coli demonstrates that it encodes sinapoylglucose:malate sinapoyltransferase, an enzyme that catalyzes a transesterification instead of functioning like a hydrolase, as do the other <b>carboxypeptidases.</b> This finding suggests that SCPL proteins have acquired novel functions in plant metabolism and provides an insight into the evolution of secondary metabolic pathways in plants...|$|R

2500|$|Proinsulin {{undergoes}} maturation into active insulin {{through the}} action of cellular endopeptidases known as prohormone convertases (PC1 and PC2), {{as well as the}} exoprotease <b>carboxypeptidase</b> E. [...] The endopeptidases cleave at 2 positions, releasing a fragment called the C-peptide, and leaving 2 peptide chains, the B- and A- chains, linked by 2 disulfide bonds. [...] The cleavage sites are each located after a pair of basic residues (lysine-64 and arginine-65, and arginine-31 and −32). After cleavage of the C-peptide, these 2 pairs of basic residues are removed by the <b>carboxypeptidase.</b> [...] The C-peptide is the central portion of proinsulin, and the primary sequence of proinsulin goes in the order [...] "B-C-A" [...] (the B and A chains were identified on the basis of mass and the C-peptide was discovered later).|$|E
2500|$|Once {{released}} from the signal peptide, it undergoes additional proteolysis and posttranslational modification (indicated by ^). 11 amino acids are removed from the N-terminus by the enzyme proprotein convertase 2 (PC2) while 16 are removed from the C-terminus of the proIAPP molecule by proprotein convertase 1/3 (PC1/3). [...] At the C-terminus <b>Carboxypeptidase</b> E then removes the terminal lysine and arginine residues. The terminal glycine amino acid that results from this cleavage allows the enzyme peptidylglycine alpha-amidating monooxygenase (PAM) to add an amine group. Finally, a disulfide bond is formed between cysteine residues numbers 2 and 7. After this the transformation from the precursor protein proIAPP to the biologically active IAPP is complete (IAPP sequence: KCNTATCATQRLANFLVHSSNNFGAILSSTNVGSNTY).|$|E

2500|$|DL-Phenylalanine (DLPA) is {{marketed as}} a {{nutritional}} supplement for its purported analgesic and antidepressant activities. [...] DL-Phenylalanine {{is a mixture}} of D-phenylalanine and L-phenylalanine. The reputed analgesic activity of DL-phenylalanine may be explained by the possible blockage by D-phenylalanine of enkephalin [...] degradation by the enzyme <b>carboxypeptidase</b> A. The mechanism of DL-phenylalanine's supposed antidepressant activity may be accounted for by the precursor role of L-phenylalanine in the synthesis of the neurotransmitters norepinephrine and dopamine. Elevated brain levels of norepinephrine and dopamine are thought to have an antidepressant effect. [...] D-Phenylalanine is absorbed from the small intestine and transported to the liver via the portal circulation. A small amount of D-phenylalanine appears to be converted to L-phenylalanine. D-Phenylalanine is distributed to the various tissues of the body via the systemic circulation. It appears to cross the blood–brain barrier less efficiently than L-phenylalanine, and so a small amount of an ingested dose of D-phenylalanine is excreted in the urine without penetrating the central nervous system.|$|E
2500|$|In the {{alternative}} pathway, C3b binds to Factor B. [...] Factor D releases Factor Ba from Factor B bound to C3b. [...] The complex of C3b(2)Bb is a protease which cleaves C5 into C5b and C5a. C5 convertase is also {{formed by the}} Classical Pathway when C3b binds C4b and C2a. C5a is an important chemotactic protein, helping recruit inflammatory cells. C3a is the precursor of an important cytokine (adipokine) named ASP (although this is not universally accepted [...] ) and is usually rapidly cleaved by <b>carboxypeptidase</b> B. [...] Both C3a and C5a have anaphylatoxin activity, directly triggering degranulation of mast cells as well as increasing vascular permeability and smooth muscle contraction. C5b initiates the membrane attack pathway, which results in the membrane attack complex (MAC), consisting of C5b, C6, C7, C8, and polymeric C9. MAC is the cytolytic endproduct of the complement cascade; it forms a transmembrane channel, which causes osmotic lysis of the target cell. Kupffer cells and other macrophage cell types help clear complement-coated pathogens. [...] As part of the innate immune system, elements of the complement cascade {{can be found in}} species earlier than vertebrates; most recently in the protostome horseshoe crab species, putting the origins of the system back further than was previously thought.|$|E

40|$|Eukaryote homologues of <b>carboxypeptidases</b> Taq {{have been}} {{discovered}} by Niemirowicz et al. in the protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi, the causative agent of Chagas' disease. This is surprising, because the peptidase family {{was thought to be}} restricted to bacteria and archaea. In this issue of the Biochemical Journal, the authors propose that the Trypanosoma <b>carboxypeptidases</b> are potential drug targets for treatment of the disease. The authors also propose that the presence of the genes in the zooflagellates can be explained by a horizontal transfer of an ancestral gene from a prokaryote. Because peptidases are popular drug targets, identifying parasite or pathogen peptidases that have no homologues in their hosts would be a method to select the most promising targets. To understand how unusual this phyletic distribution is among the 183 families of peptidases, several other examples of horizontal transfers are presented, as well as some unusual losses of peptidase genes...|$|R
40|$|Aspartoacylase catalyzes {{hydrolysis}} of N-acetyl-l-aspartate to aspartate and acetate in the vertebrate brain. Deficiency in {{this activity}} leads to spongiform degeneration of the white matter {{of the brain and}} is the established cause of Canavan disease, a fatal progressive leukodystrophy affecting young children. We present crystal structures of recombinant human and rat aspartoacylase refined to 2. 8 - and 1. 8 -Å resolution, respectively. The structures revealed that the N-terminal domain of aspartoacylase adopts a protein fold similar to that of zinc-dependent hydrolases related to <b>carboxypeptidases</b> A. The catalytic site of aspartoacylase shows close structural similarity to those of <b>carboxypeptidases</b> despite only 10 – 13 % sequence identity between these proteins. About 100 C-terminal residues of aspartoacylase form a globular domain with a two-stranded β-sheet linker that wraps around the N-terminal domain. The long channel leading to the active site is formed by the interface of the N- and C-terminal domains. The C-terminal domain is positioned in a way that prevents productive binding of polypetides in the active site. The structures revealed that residues 158 – 164 may undergo a conformational change that results in opening and partial closing of the channel entrance. We hypothesize that the catalytic mechanism of aspartoacylase is closely analogous to that of <b>carboxypeptidases.</b> We identify residues involved in zinc coordination, and propose which residues may be involved in substrate binding and catalysis. The structures also provide a structural framework necessary for understanding the deleterious effects of many missense mutations of human aspartoacylase...|$|R

The similarity of the AMP 1 protein to glutamate <b>carboxypeptidases,</b> and in particular to N-acetyl α-linked acidic dipeptidases, suggests that the AMP 1 gene product modulates the level of a small signaling molecule that acts to regulate a number of aspects of plant development, in particular the size of the apical meristem...|$|R
