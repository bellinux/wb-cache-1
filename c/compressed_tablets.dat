5|$|Alprazolam, {{available}} {{under the}} trade name Xanax, is a potent, short-acting benzodiazepine anxiolytic—a minor tranquilizer. It {{is commonly used}} {{for the treatment of}} anxiety disorders, especially of panic disorder, but also in the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) or social anxiety disorder. It was the 12th most prescribed medicine in the United States in 2010. Alprazolam, like other benzodiazepines, binds to specific sites on the GABAA receptor. It possesses anxiolytic, sedative, hypnotic, skeletal muscle relaxant, anticonvulsant, amnestic, and antidepressant properties. Alprazolam is available for oral administration as <b>compressed</b> <b>tablets</b> (CT) and extended-release capsules (XR).|$|E

5000|$|The word [...] "tabloid" [...] {{comes from}} the name given by the London-based {{pharmaceutical}} company Burroughs Wellcome & Co. to the <b>compressed</b> <b>tablets</b> they marketed as [...] "Tabloid" [...] pills in the late 1880s.

50|$|The {{compressed}} tablet {{is the most}} popular dosage form in use today. About two-thirds of all prescriptions are dispensed as solid dosage forms, and half of these are <b>compressed</b> <b>tablets.</b> A tablet can be formulated to deliver an accurate dosage to a specific site; it is usually taken orally, but can be administered sublingually, buccally, rectally or intravaginally. The tablet {{is just one of the}} many forms that an oral drug can take such as syrups, elixirs, suspensions, and emulsions. Medicinal tablets were originally made in the shape of a disk of whatever color their components determined, but are now made in many shapes and colors to help distinguish different medicines. Tablets are often stamped with symbols, letters, and numbers, which enable them to be identified. Sizes of tablets to be swallowed range from a few millimeters to about a centimeter.|$|E
40|$|Globules, <b>compressed</b> <b>tablets</b> and tablet triturates {{are solid}} dosage forms used in homeopathy. Divergences can be noted between the {{preparation}} techniques described in official compendiums {{as well as}} those applied in homeopathic pharmacies. The difficulty associated with standardization of the impregnation of these dosage forms occurs {{due to the lack of}} detail provided for the techniques in the literature, leaving it up to each pharmacy to decide on the exact method of preparation. The objective was to optimize the impregnation technique, through investigating the variables that influence the impregnation of globules, <b>compressed</b> <b>tablets</b> and tablet triturates, applying the statistical tool of factorial design. The independent variables were the dosage form, percentage and type of impregnation and drying temperature, and the dependent variables were the mass gain, disintegration time, friability and hardness. For the globules, the greatest mass gain was for 10 % impregnation and drying at 20 ºC. For the tablet triturates and <b>compressed</b> <b>tablets</b> the greatest mass gain was for 15 % impregnation and there was no difference between the results obtained using simple and triple impregnation or different drying temperatures. The results can contribute to improving the final product quality, besides aiding in the establishment of standardized techniques for the official compendiums...|$|E
40|$|Pharmaceutical oral solid dosage forms {{have been}} used widely for decades mainly due to their {{convenience}} of administration and their suitability for delivery for delivery of drugs for systemic effects. The most commonly used pharmaceutical solid dosage forms today include granules, pellets, tablets and capsules. The tablets and capsules can be made directly from powders or from granules pellets, or from film-coated multiple units. Tablets are now the most popular dosage form, accounting for some 70 % of all ethical pharmaceutical preparations produced. Tablets may be defined as solid pharmaceutical dosage forms containing drug substances with or without suitable diluents and prepared by either compression or molding methods. Hence, tablets can be broadly classified as <b>compressed</b> <b>tablets</b> and molded tablets. <b>Compressed</b> <b>tablets</b> can be further classified as directly compressible tablets, chewable tablets and tablet triturates...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} the internal structure of <b>tablets</b> <b>compressed</b> from binary mixtures of sodium chloride and pregelatinised starch. The minimum particle diameter of pregelatinised starch inside <b>tablets</b> <b>compressed</b> from mixtures was {{calculated from the}} difference between the initial pore size distribution and the pore size distribution after removal of the starch particles by burning. Subsequently, the tablets were carefully crushed. These powders, consisting of almost only sodium chloride particles, were measured by laser diffraction. It was found that the diameter of the sodium chloride particles hardly changed, whereas the minimum diameter of starch particles strongly decreased during the compaction process. As an effect of the difference in yield pressure, the harder sodium chloride particles cause deformation of the softer starch particles, resulting in a change in particle shape. The pore size distribution of <b>tablets</b> <b>compressed</b> from mixtures of sodium chloride and starch is typically that of viscoelastic materials; the larger pores (> 5 μm) change, while the small pores stay constant in number and size. The median pore diameter in <b>tablets</b> <b>compressed</b> from the mixtures is higher than the median pore diameter in <b>tablets</b> <b>compressed</b> from the pure materials. This paper shows that the formation of large pores {{was the result of the}} extra porosity expansion of <b>tablets</b> <b>compressed</b> from binary mixtures of sodium chloride and pregelatinised starch. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.

The prepared granules of all batches showed excellent to passable flowability and were suitable for compression into tablets. Most of the granules were hard and expected to withstand handling during the subsequent compression into tablets. Granules with high friabilities were only those prepared with high amount of sodium sulfate or low amount of chitosan.
