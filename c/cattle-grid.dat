5000|$|The tramway track {{leaves the}} [...] "Buderim loop", in the Palmwoods Station yard near the present passengers' car park, and moves {{north to the}} unknown site of the former engine shed. From the shed it {{apparently}} reversed in a turning triangle and then descended to a lower level (between three and four metres below the main line), to exit the station yard {{where it can be}} discerned to the east opposite the station building and then clearly as an embankment crossing Palmwoods Creek, before proceeding across the junction of the Chevallum and Nicklin roads to cross the Bowling Club property. Remains of a small bridge are found on private property some seventy metres from the eastern boundary, after which the track turns east across a dam wall, possibly for tram water supply, and then a lagoon wall formed by the embankment, over the remains of a probable <b>cattle-grid,</b> and then the remaining embankment is breached as it crosses Nicklin Road into suburban development.|$|E
5000|$|BBC Music {{reviewer}} Sarah Bee {{felt that}} [...] "Sumner's voice seems {{more suited to}} the loping of reggae than the skittering of electro-pop and its cousins ... and maybe she'll relax into similar territory next time around. There's nothing radical here, but revolution isn't all it's cracked up to be." [...] In a review for the NME, Alex Denney described [...] "Caesar" [...] as a [...] "good-ass pop tune", but stated that [...] "for the most part The Constant boils down to a thin chart gruel, too lumpenly pitched between the Carling Academies and the <b>cattle-grid</b> nightclubs to leave a mark." [...] Ian Gittins of Virgin Media found that Sumner [...] "has spectacularly inherited her father's idiosyncratic musicality, with her husky, masculine tones and mannered whoops and yowls illustrating that she has paid close attention to her dad's vocal repertoire." [...] Louisa Emery of The Wharf expressed that [...] "Coco has created an album that shows she {{is more than a}} over privileged kid playing popstar, even if it will do little to shake off her Sumner stigma." [...] Neil Condron of Clash magazine characterised the album as [...] "predictably pristine, ultimately inessential". The Observers Killian Fox argued that [...] "the album ends up feeling oddly flat. We are left with a sense of excitement unfulfilled." ...|$|E
50|$|It is {{commonly}} {{held that the}} rail used {{on some of the}} <b>cattle-grids</b> on the Trefriw to Cowlyd access road came from the former tramway, but comparison of the two reveals clearly that the tramway rail was considerably lighter, and would not be sufficiently heavy for this later use. It is more likely that it came from the Eigiau tramway, which at one time carried standard gauge engines, and would have been laid in heavier rail.|$|R
