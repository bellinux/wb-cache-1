2500|$|An {{hour and}} a half before the {{departure}} of BE 548, its rostered captain, Stanley Key, a former Royal Air Force pilot who had served during World War II, was involved in a quarrel in the <b>crew</b> <b>room</b> at Heathrow's Queen's Building with a first officer named Flavell. The subject was the threatened strike, which Flavell supported and Key opposed. Both of Key's flight deck crew on BE 548 witnessed the altercation, and another bystander described Key's outburst as [...] "the most violent argument he had ever heard". Shortly afterward Key apologised to Flavell, and the matter seemed closed. Key's anti-strike views had won enemies and graffiti against him had appeared on the flight decks of BEA Tridents, including Papa India. The graffiti on Papa India's flight engineers' desk was analysed by a handwriting expert to identify who had written it, but this could not be determined. The public inquiry found that none of the graffiti had been written by crew members on BE 548 {{on the day of the}} accident.|$|E
