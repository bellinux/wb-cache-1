2500|$|Grades 5 and 6 form an {{orientation}} phase (Orientierungsstufe) during which students, {{their parents and}} teachers decide which of the above-mentioned paths the students should follow. In all states except Berlin and Brandenburg, this orientation phase is embedded into the program of the secondary schools. The decision for a secondary school influences the student's future, but during this phase changes can be made more easily. In practice this rarely comes to bear because teachers are afraid of sending pupils to more academic schools whereas parents are afraid of sending their children to less academic schools. In Berlin and Brandenburg, the orientation is embedded into that of the elementary schools. [...] Teachers give a so-called educational (path) recommendation (Bildungs(gang)empfehlung) based on scholastic achievements in the main subjects (mathematics, German, natural sciences, foreign language) and <b>classroom</b> <b>behavior</b> with details and legal implications differing from state to state: in some German states, those wishing {{to apply for a}} Gymnasium or Realschule require such a recommendation stating that the student is likely to make a successful transition to that type of school; in other cases anybody may apply.|$|E
2500|$|Research {{has found}} {{that there is a}} high risk of {{educational}} underachievement for children who are from low-income housing circumstances. This is often a process that begins in primary school for some less fortunate children. Instruction in the US educational system, as well as in most other countries, tends to be geared towards those students who come from more advantaged backgrounds. As a result, children in poverty are at a higher risk than advantaged children for retention in their grade, special deleterious placements during the school's hours and even not completing their high school education. Advantage breeds advantage. There are indeed many explanations for why students tend to drop out of school. One is the conditions of which they attend school. Schools in poverty-stricken areas have conditions that hinder children from learning in a safe environment. Researchers have developed a name for areas like this: an urban war zone is a poor, crime-laden district in which deteriorated, violent, even war-like conditions and underfunded, largely ineffective schools promote inferior academic performance, including irregular attendance and disruptive or non-compliant <b>classroom</b> <b>behavior.</b> Because of poverty, [...] "Students from low-income families are 2.4 times more likely to drop out than middle-income kids, and over 10 times more likely than high-income peers to drop out" ...|$|E

50|$|Many {{classroom}} {{and teaching strategies}} draw on principles of social learning to enhance students' knowledge acquisition and retention. For example, using the technique of guided participation, a teacher says a phrase and asks the class to repeat the phrase. Thus, students both imitate and reproduce the teacher's action, aiding retention. An extension of guided participation is reciprocal learning, in which both student and teacher share responsibility in leading discussions. Additionally, teachers can shape the <b>classroom</b> <b>behavior</b> of students by modelling appropriate behavior and visibly rewarding students for good behavior. By emphasizing the teacher's role as model and encouraging the students to adopt the position of observer, the teacher can make knowledge and practices explicit to students, enhancing their learning outcomes.|$|E

40|$|Objective: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} on-site, behavioral treatment of the disrup-tive <b>classroom</b> <b>behaviors</b> of a 16 -year-old male high school student diagnosed as having autism. Method: A descriptive analysis of the problem behaviors was conducted. A number of behav-ioral treatments, including environmental modification, relaxation training, and self-monitoring, were introduced under the direction of a social worker. Results: Seriously disruptive behaviors were reduced to zero frequency, and the frequency of less severe disruptive behaviors was also reduced. Outcomes remained positive during 1 year of intervention. Conclusion: Descriptive assessment and on-site behavioral interventions are potentially effective interven-tions for social workers treating disruptive behaviors of clients with autism and related develop-mental disabilities.
