5|$|Following {{the rise}} of <b>classical</b> <b>genetics,</b> many biologists—including {{a new wave of}} {{physical}} scientists in biology—pursued the question of the gene and its physical nature. Warren Weaver—head of the science division of the Rockefeller Foundation—issued grants to promote research that applied the methods of physics and chemistry to basic biological problems, coining the term molecular biology for this approach in 1938; many of the significant biological breakthroughs of the 1930s and 1940s were funded by the Rockefeller Foundation.|$|E
5|$|Natural {{selection}} {{is one of}} the cornerstones of modern biology. The concept, published by Darwin and Alfred Russel Wallace in a joint presentation of papers in 1858, was elaborated in Darwin's influential 1859 book On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection, which described natural selection as analogous to artificial selection, a process by which animals and plants with traits considered desirable by human breeders are systematically favoured for reproduction. The concept of natural selection originally developed {{in the absence of a}} valid theory of heredity; at the time of Darwin's writing, science had yet to develop modern theories of genetics. The union of traditional Darwinian evolution with subsequent discoveries in <b>classical</b> <b>genetics</b> formed the modern synthesis of the mid-20th century. The addition of molecular genetics has led to evolutionary developmental biology, which explains evolution at the molecular level. While genotypes can slowly change by random genetic drift, natural selection remains the primary explanation for adaptive evolution.|$|E
25|$|Polymorphism crosses several {{discipline}} boundaries, including {{ecology and}} genetics, evolution theory, taxonomy, cytology, and biochemistry. Different disciplines may {{give the same}} concept different names, and different concepts may be given the same name. For example, there are the terms established in ecological genetics by E.B. Ford (1975), and for <b>classical</b> <b>genetics</b> by John Maynard Smith (1998). The shorter term morphism may be more accurate than polymorphism, but is not often used. It was the preferred term of the evolutionary biologist Julian Huxley (1955).|$|E
50|$|This {{term was}} {{introduced}} to describe geographically structured genetic signals within and among species. An explicit focus on a species' biogeography/biogeographical past sets phylogeography apart from <b>classical</b> population <b>genetics</b> and phylogenetics.|$|R
40|$|Some {{writers have}} urged that {{evolutionary}} theory produces generalizations that hold only ceteris paribus, that is, provided “everything else is equal. ” Others {{have claimed that}} all laws in the special sciences, or even all laws in science generally, hold only ceteris paribus. However, if we lack a way to determine when everything else really is equal, hedging generalizations with the phrase ceteris paribus renders those generalizations vacuous. I propose {{a solution to this}} problem for the case of causal equations from <b>classical</b> population <b>genetics.</b> When coupled with the right proviso, equations in <b>classical</b> population <b>genetics</b> function as strict laws...|$|R
50|$|Coalescent {{theory is}} a natural {{extension}} of the more <b>classical</b> population <b>genetics</b> concept of neutral evolution and is an approximation to the Fisher-Wright (or Wright-Fisher) model for large populations. It was discovered independently by several researchers in the 1980s.|$|R
25|$|Because {{mutations}} in the CFTR gene are typically small, <b>classical</b> <b>genetics</b> techniques {{had been unable}} to accurately pinpoint the mutated gene. Using protein markers, gene-linkage studies were able to map the mutation to chromosome 7. Chromosome-walking and -jumping techniques were then used to identify and sequence the gene. In 1989, Lap-Chee Tsui led a team of researchers at the Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto that discovered the gene responsible for CF. CF represents a classic example of how a human genetic disorder was elucidated strictly by the process of forward genetics.|$|E
25|$|In <b>classical</b> <b>genetics,</b> if genes A and B are mutated, {{and each}} {{mutation}} by itself produces a unique phenotype {{but the two}} mutations together show the same phenotype as the gene A mutation, then gene A is epistatic and gene B is hypostatic. For example, the gene for total baldness is epistatic to the gene for brown hair. In this sense, epistasis can be contrasted with genetic dominance, which is an interaction between alleles at the same gene locus. As the study of genetics developed, and {{with the advent of}} molecular biology, epistasis started to be studied in relation to Quantitative Trait Loci (QTL) and polygenic inheritance.|$|E
25|$|Recombinant DNA {{technology}} arose as {{a result}} of advances in biology that began in the 1950s and 60’s. During these decades, a tradition of merging the structural, biochemical and informational approaches to the central problems of <b>classical</b> <b>genetics</b> became more apparent. Two main underlying concepts of this tradition were that genes consisted of DNA and that DNA encoded information that determined the processes of replication and protein synthesis. These concepts were embodied in the model of DNA proposed by James Watson and Francis Crick, and further research on the Watson-Crick model yielded theoretical advances that were reflected in new capacities to manipulate DNA. One of these capacities was recombinant DNA technology.|$|E

30|$|<b>Classical</b> {{population}} <b>genetics</b> analyses do {{not allow}} inferring the direction of migration using molecular data. Although some Bayesian analyses have been more recently developed to do so [8, 9], many require complex and time-consuming computing of the likelihood functions, restraining the ability to explore more than often too simple evolutionary scenarios and molecular models [10].|$|R
25|$|Martin Richards {{estimated}} that only 11% of European mtDNA {{is due to}} immigration in this period, suggesting that farming was spread primarily due to being adopted by indigenous Mesolithic populations, rather than due to immigration from Near East. Gene flow from SE to NW Europe seems to have continued in the Neolithic, the percentage significantly declining towards the British Isles. <b>Classical</b> <b>genetics</b> also suggested that the largest admixture to the European Paleolithic/Mesolithic stock {{was due to the}} Neolithic revolution of the 7th to 5th millennia BC. Three main mtDNA gene groups have been identified as contributing Neolithic entrants into Europe: J, T1 and U3 (in that order of importance). With others, they amount up to around 20% of the gene pool.|$|E
25|$|Another post-war {{activity}} was Huxley's {{attack on the}} Soviet politico-scientist Trofim Lysenko, who had espoused a Lamarckian heredity, made unscientific pronouncements on agriculture, used his influence to destroy <b>classical</b> <b>genetics</b> in Russia and to move genuine scientists from their posts. In 1940, the leading botanical geneticist Nikolai Vavilov was arrested, and Lysenko replaced him {{as director of the}} Institute of Genetics. In 1941, Vavilov was tried, found guilty of 'sabotage' and sentenced to death. Reprieved, he died in jail of malnutrition in 1943. Lysenko's machinations were the cause of his arrest. Worse still, Lysenkoism not only denied proven genetic facts, it stopped the artificial selection of crops on Darwinian principles. This {{may have contributed to the}} regular shortage of food from the Soviet agricultural system (Soviet famines). Huxley, who had twice visited the Soviet Union, was originally not anti-communist, but the ruthless adoption of Lysenkoism by Joseph Stalin ended his tolerant attitude. Lysenko ended his days in a Soviet mental hospital, and Vavilov's reputation was posthumously restored in 1955.|$|E
500|$|In {{the early}} 20th century the modern {{evolutionary}} synthesis integrated <b>classical</b> <b>genetics</b> with Darwin's {{theory of evolution}} by natural selection through the discipline of population genetics. The importance of natural selection {{as a cause of}} evolution was accepted into other branches of biology. Moreover, previously held notions about evolution, such as orthogenesis, evolutionism, and other beliefs about innate [...] "progress" [...] within the largest-scale trends in evolution, became obsolete. Scientists continue to study various aspects of evolutionary biology by forming and testing hypotheses, constructing mathematical models of theoretical biology and biological theories, using observational data, and performing experiments in both the field and the laboratory.|$|E

As Gluecksohn-Waelsch combined the embryological expertise she had acquired at Spemann´s lab with methods of <b>classical</b> mouse <b>genetics,</b> she is considered the founder of mammalian developmental genetics. She co-authored over 100 publications on developmental genetics.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this article}} is to discuss and develop the {{diagnose}} of the Hardy- Weinberg law made by van Fraassen (1987, p. 110), according to which: 1) that law cannot be considered a law used as an axiom for the <b>classical</b> population <b>genetics</b> as a whole, since it is an equilibrium-law that holds only under certain special conditions; 2) it just determines a subclass of models; 3) its generalization shades off into logical vacuity; and 4) more complex variants of the law can be deduced for more realistic assumptions. The discussion and development of such a diagnose will be carried out with the notions of another semantic conceptions of theories, related to that of van Fraassen, namely, the structuralist view of theories, and a rational reconstruction of <b>classical</b> population <b>genetics</b> made within the framework of such a metatheory, also presented in this paper...|$|R

[...] H. J. Muller, while interested, was focused more on physical rather than chemical studies of the gene, as were most {{of the members of the}} phage group.

40|$|The {{following}} dissertation is an inferentialist {{account of}} <b>classical</b> population <b>genetics.</b> I present the theory as a definite body of interconnected inferential rules for generating mathematical models of population dynamics. To state those rules, I use {{the notion of}} causation as a primitive. First, I put forward a rule stating the circumstances of application of the theory, one that uses causal language {{to pick out the}} types of entities over which the theory may be deployed. Next, I offer a rule for grouping such entities into populations based on their competitive causal relationships. Then I offer a general algorithm for generating <b>classical</b> population <b>genetics</b> models for such populations {{on the basis of what}} causal influences operate within them. Dynamical models in population genetics are designed to demystify natural phenomena, chiefly to show how adaptation, altruism, and genetic polymorphism can be explained in terms of natural rather than supernatural processes. In order for the theory to serve this purpose, it must be possible to understand, in a principled fashion, when and how to deploy the theory. By presenting the theory as a system of ordered inferential rules that takes causal information as its critical input and yields dynamical models as its outputs, I show explicitly how <b>classical</b> population <b>genetics</b> functions as a non-circular theoretical apparatus for generating explanations. The generalization of the theory achieved by presenting it using causal vocabulary shows how the scope of the theory of natural selection extends beyond its traditional domain of systems distinguished by genetic variations...|$|R
