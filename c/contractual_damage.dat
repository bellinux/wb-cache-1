40|$|Contract law’s {{liquidated}} damage rules prevent enforcement of <b>contractual</b> <b>damage</b> measures {{that require the}} promisor, if it breaches, to transfer to the promisee a sum that exceeds the net gain the promisee expected to make from performance; but these rules permit the promisor to transfer less than the promisee’s expectation. We define a <b>contractual</b> <b>damage</b> multiplier as any number between zero and infinity by which the promisee’s expected gain [...] its expectation interest [...] is multiplied. Multipliers of one or less thus comply with the {{liquidated damage}} rules while multipliers that exceed one do not; the high multipliers are unenforceable penalties. This paper shows that multipliers of any size can be efficient or inefficient, depending on the parties’ purposes in creating them. For example, a multiplier that exceeds one will decrease welfare if used by a seller with market power to deter entry; but will increase welfare if used by parties to induce efficient relation specific investment. As a consequence, a court should inquire, not into {{the size of the}} multiplier, but into the purpose the multiplier serves for the parties. The practical implication of this view is that it no longer should be a sufficient defense to an action to enforce a <b>contractual</b> <b>damage</b> measure that the parties’ multiplier exceeded one...|$|E

This means that remedies for {{breach of contract}} are broader than mere compensation. Yet in many cases the courts strain logic by attempting to equate a gain with a loss under the rubric of compensation. A fresh approach that is attracting judicial support is to recognise that the performance interest forms the essence of <b>contractual</b> <b>damages.</b> Once this is recognised, there should be an open acceptance of compensation for loss and accounting for gain. The reach of accounting for profit is comprehensively defined by the performance interest and only operates once compensatory damages are inadequate.

40|$|This article aims {{to point}} out that some of the figures {{recurring}} in the debate on extracontractual liability are indeed unable to sustain a serious screening under the categories of tortious liability. Pure economic loss is the typical <b>contractual</b> <b>damage</b> and is alien to systems like the Italian one which, providing in art. 2043 c. c. that damage has to be “ingiusto”, contradicts a loss being purely economic. The same is to be said about the loss of chance, which paradoxically is the result of what as a damage is purely economic then not “ingiusto”, at the level of causation lacks of a link properly intended, and as a loss is uncertain. Punitive damages are the fruit of a common law (the American particularly) still inclined to consider civil liability a place for the score settling and the vengeance, even though new theories try to credit them in new perspectives. Finally the “danno esistenziale” is a fairly new Italian figure of non patrimonial damage which has contributed to muddle things up, whereas what is intended by this label already finds compensation through “danno biologico” and non-pecuniary loss, the two parts in which non patrimonial damage still divides...|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} {{examines the}} impact of Chinese cultural values on the application of law on <b>contractual</b> <b>damages.</b> Following an experimental design, 43 in-depth {{interviews were conducted with}} Chinese judges in 13 cities and provinces across China. The data reveal two patterns. First, the judges took the cultural values into account when determining the amount of damages. Second, the consideration of cultural value factors reduced the judges’ consideration of legal factors. The local cultural values did not change the Chinese judges’ understanding of law. Instead, the judges compromised the legal requirements and cultural desires by using the discretion offered to them or by recommending mediation. The consideration of cultural values is not only the result of judges’ personal preferences, but also of judges seeking social approval. The motivation of Chinese judges to obtain social approval may be enhanced by the assessment criteria and the institutional constraints of Chinese courts...|$|R

40|$|This note {{discusses}} a 2008 House of Lords {{decision on}} the proper test for remoteness of <b>contractual</b> <b>damages</b> following a breach of contract. In The Achilleas, Lord Hoffmann set out a test for remoteness which varied slightly from the traditional Hadley v Baxendale test of foreseeability entrenched in Common Law countries world-wide. Lord Hoffmann’s test draws on the broader context of an agreement, including {{whether there was a}} tacit assumption of risk by one of the parties, as well as standard norms in the industry in question. Although the Court was not unanimous in The Achilleas, this represents a significant departure from settled law. In South Africa, our Supreme Court of Appeal has favoured a ‘contemplation’ (foreseeability) test over a ‘convention’ (assumption of risk) one. In an important decision in 2001, however, this Court gave an obiter indication that it may also in future revise our foreseeability test in favour of a more flexible one, in line with other branches of the law of obligations.

40|$|In this {{extensive}} article I revisit {{my earlier}} writings from the 1970 s {{that deal with}} tort liability in both stranger and consensual arrangements. On the former, I examine Stephen Perry’s 1988 critique of my work, and more recent contributions by Joshua Getzler and Benjamin Zipursky, to defend the view that a rigorous conception of causation under a theory of strict liability is neither logically impossible nor practically unworkable. In so doing, I reexamine the earlier efforts by writers such as Joseph Beale and H. L. A. Hart 2 ̆ 6 Tony Honoré on causation {{in order to show}} how some controversial moves within their theories can be clarified without having to resort to the standard views of causation that work off the notion of “but for” causes. In addition, I explain, in connection with the critique of Jill Horwitz, why some form of a negligence system remains appropriate for medical malpractice cases. In these consensual cases, doctrines of charitable immunity for nonprofit institutions often removed the need to investigate the basis of liability. But once those were removed, a contractual system, which in practice would never embrace a strict liability rule would often turn to some form of negligence, often coupled with institutional changes, such as arbitration and explicit limitations on <b>contractual</b> <b>damages...</b>|$|R
40|$|Although American {{common law}} allows punitive damages for {{reckless}} or intentional torts, it will neither allow {{a jury to}} assess punitive damages for breach of contract nor permit enforcement of a <b>contractual</b> <b>damages</b> clause that is deemed to be punitive. This approach is rooted in an early Chancery practice of granting equitable relief from oppressive penal bonds and has been more recently justified {{as a means of}} facilitating efficient breach. Economic efficiency, however, can be accomplished even if punitive damages could be assessed for intentional breach, because the parties would have an incentive to negotiate a release from the first contract to enable both to share in the surplus offered by an intervening contractual opportunity. Moreover, negotiation of an enforceable penalty clause would allow some parties to maximize their utility by exchanging a signal of assurance of performance for a premium fee. Additionally, the French experience invites a fresh look, because – although it generally disallows punitive damages of a judicial origin for any civil wrong, tort or breach of contract [...] it honors freedom of contract and the autonomy of the parties by enforcing a contractual penalty clause (although the court may reduce an excessive contractual penalty). Taking a cue from the French approach, American courts and legislatures should reconsider their refusal to sanction freely negotiated penalty clauses and enforce them {{to the extent that they}} permit the parties to maximize their collective utility...|$|R
