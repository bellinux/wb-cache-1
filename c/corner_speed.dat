25|$|MotoGP, {{the premier}} class of GP {{motorcycle}} racing, {{has changed dramatically}} in recent years. From the mid-1970s through to 2001, the top class of GP racing allowed 500cc displacement with a maximum of four cylinders, {{regardless of whether the}} engine was a two-stroke or four-stroke. Consequently, all machines were two-strokes, due to the greater power output for a given engine capacity. Some two- and three-cylinder two-stroke 500s were seen, but though they had a minimum-weight advantage under the rules, typically attained higher <b>corner</b> <b>speed</b> and could qualify well, they lacked the power of the four-cylinder machines.|$|E
500|$|Early {{practice}} speeds approached [...] NASCAR had mandated {{before the}} qualifier that {{the holes in}} the cars' restrictor plates be reduced by , later conceding that the rule may have affected some teams more than others. According to Gilliland, [...] "They threw a curveball at us this morning with the restrictor plate and (engine builder) Doug Yates wasn't worried at all. He put the super-tune on it and the thing ran great." [...] Earnhardt called the reduction in speed unnecessary: [...] "The track is safe... I don't feel (the late change in plate size) is a very fair situation for everybody. Once you're up around the 190s, what's two miles an hour? I don't see what the big deal is. The speed average is up because the <b>corner</b> <b>speed</b> remains better with the new asphalt. As far as running in a straight line, we're no faster than we've always run here." [...] Despite the mandated change, NASCAR did not schedule an additional practice session.|$|E

2500|$|With {{the advent}} of the ETR 470 Pendolino, the class {{designation}} N was introduced. [...] Thanks to their tilt technology, these multiple unit trains have an even higher <b>cornering</b> <b>speed</b> compared with designation R (e.g. , instead of [...] ). [...] The Swiss Federal Railways Tilt Train RABDe 500 (InterCityNeigezug) also achieves this norm, but the train itself was given the designation R. [...] Technically, locomotives of the class R can also operate to the standards of class N, but in practice the maximum <b>cornering</b> <b>speeds</b> are lower, to improve passenger comfort by reducing lateral forces.|$|R
50|$|In {{the context}} of air combat maneuvring (ACM), the {{maneuvering}} speed {{is also known as}} <b>corner</b> <b>speed</b> or cornering speed.|$|E
5000|$|Both turn rate, (degrees per second), {{and turn}} radius, (diameter of the turn), {{increase}} with speed, until the [...] "corner speed" [...] is reached. At this point, the growing turn radius begins {{to decrease the}} turn rate, so the aircraft will reach its best turn performance at its particular <b>corner</b> <b>speed.</b> <b>Corner</b> <b>speed</b> {{is defined as the}} minimum speed at which the maximum sustainable g-force load can be generated (the load at which power equals drag), and varies with the fighter's structural design, weight (including added weight from missiles, drop-tanks, etc...), and thrust capabilities. It often falls in the area of 250 - 400 kn. The maximum sustainable-load the aircraft can generate also varies, but is typically between 3 and 5 g's. At the <b>corner</b> <b>speed,</b> the fighter can attain its maximum turn-rate, flying the craft just at the edge of buffeting (the turbulence preceding a stall). Below this speed, the aircraft will be limited to flying at lower g's, resulting in a decrease in turn rate. If the pilot attempts to [...] "pull" [...] more g's, the aircraft will buffet and aerodynamically stall. On the other hand, if the fighter is flown above its <b>corner</b> <b>speed</b> {{it will be able to}} pull higher g's, but doing so will cause it to lose airspeed from the excess drag created. Turning at the maximum sustainable-load at speeds above the <b>corner</b> <b>speed</b> will result in an increase in turn radius which, respectively, will cause a decrease in turn rate.|$|E
50|$|The circuit is 4.5 km {{with long}} three long straights and offers many passing opportunities. A quick lap around the circuit {{involves}} smooth entries and exits, maintaining good <b>corner</b> <b>speed</b> and maximising terminal speeds on the straights.|$|E
5000|$|During testing [...] in 2009 it {{was found}} that the new ETR 610 trains were too heavy for the main Gotthard route from Zurich to Milan for which they had been ordered. The weight of the train {{influences}} the permitted <b>cornering</b> <b>speed</b> due to forces on the track - the heavier the train the slower the <b>cornering</b> <b>speed</b> allowed. It was found the new trains would have to run so slowly that traditional trains without tilting technologies would be just as fast, thus calling the whole project into question.|$|R
50|$|The {{benefit of}} a fan car is that it pulls air out from {{underneath}} the car, creating an area of comparatively lower pressure. This difference in pressure {{above and below the}} car presses it towards the ground, producing downforce. The fan principle allows the X2010 to maintain a high <b>cornering</b> <b>speed</b> in low <b>speed</b> <b>corners.</b>|$|R
50|$|May is {{generally}} credited with introducing the first manipulated elevated wing onto a racing car - a Porsche 550 - to produce downforce (or down thrust) for enhanced braking and <b>cornering</b> <b>speeds</b> to reduce lap times.|$|R
50|$|Retired from racing since 2000, he {{is renowned}} for his high <b>corner</b> <b>speed</b> riding style, {{combined}} with an aggressive competitiveness, which netted him 59 victories and four World Superbike Championships (1994, 1995, 1998 and 1999). His greatest success came with the factory Ducati team.|$|E
50|$|The ARES {{has very}} good turning {{performance}} {{as a result of}} low wing loading. Its turn rate is 32 degree/second at 6G and 36 degree/second at 7G (the structure is limited to 8G). The <b>corner</b> <b>speed</b> is 210 kt (390 km/h) the stall speed is 78 kt (145 km/h).|$|E
50|$|Two-circle flow {{will also}} result in another merge. In two-circle flow, turn radius {{is of little}} importance, because what matters is which fighter {{can get back to}} the merging place first. Two-circle flow is a turn rate fight, and the angular {{advantage}} usually goes to the aircraft with the higher turn rate at its <b>corner</b> <b>speed.</b> Pilots will often slice turn in order to maximize their turn rate.|$|E
5000|$|As a {{response}} to widespread changes in the technical regulations expected to increase <b>cornering</b> <b>speeds</b> by up to 40 kph mph, the FIA requested that every circuit on the calendar undergo revisions to update safety features.|$|R

50|$|In {{response}} to increasing <b>cornering</b> <b>speeds,</b> another aerodynamic overhaul {{was introduced in}} 2017, lowering downforce by 25%. Furthermore, KERS units were banned, although the only manufacturer to utilize such systems, Honda, had already discontinued their usage in 2016.|$|R

5000|$|In 1997 Mick Doohan {{wanted to}} run a 180Â° screamer engine. HRC crew chief Jerry Burgess {{explains}} why: [...] "The 180 got back a direct relationship between the throttle and the rear wheel, When the tire spun I could roll off without losing drive. The big bang {{has a lot of}} engine braking, so it upsets the bike into corners, then when you open the throttle you get this sudden pulse of power, which again upsets the suspension. Mick's secret is <b>corner</b> <b>speed,</b> so he needs the bike to be smooth and the 180 is much smoother." ...|$|E
50|$|Until {{telemetry}} {{data was}} released {{four days after}} Salom's death, his team believed {{the front of the}} bike lost control whilst braking over a bump at turn 12. The telemetry showed that due to a low acceleration at the exit out of turn 11, he had applied the brakes nine metres later than usual, in order to maintain a proper <b>corner</b> <b>speed</b> at turn 12. As a result, he was still on the brakes when he hit an irregularity on the asphalt, as opposed to previous laps where he already had released the brakes on that spot. The stress this produced on the front tyre, caused a loss of grip over the irregularity, resulting in the crash.|$|E
25|$|Further, from 1995 {{designs were}} {{required}} {{to be drawn from}} a reference plane (template), and strict limitations were enforced as to the minimum and maximum tolerances for aspects of the vehicle such as the size of the cockpit opening (an idea well known in Champ Car for a decade) and of aerodynamic devices, commonly called wings. Further, maximum engine displacement was reduced from 3.5 litres to 3 litres. Further changes were mandated as the FIA continued to try to curb the increase in speeds of Formula One cars as the years progressed. These changes included the increase in size of the cockpit opening (to ensure driver egress was easy and to minimise possible side head impacts), introducing grooved tyres (to reduce <b>cornering</b> <b>speeds</b> by reducing grip) and narrower bodywork (this would complicate cooling and also reduce <b>cornering</b> <b>speed),</b> raising and reducing wing sizes and elements (cutting aerodynamic downforce, thus reducing <b>cornering</b> <b>speed),</b> and introducing comprehensive checks on stiffness tolerances and measurements to ensure cars conformed completely with the regulations (for example, weight tests on wings and bodywork to ensure that they maintained integrity and did not flex to give an aerodynamic advantage in a straight line).|$|R
50|$|Today, Gatsonides' fame largely {{results from}} inventing the Gatso speed camera, a speed {{measuring}} device used today by many police forces to catch speeding drivers. He originally invented the Gatso speed camera to measure his <b>cornering</b> <b>speed</b> {{in an attempt}} to improve his driving.|$|R
5000|$|The 2010 main panel afforded greater head {{protection}} to the driver, whilst increasing peripheral vision. Increased {{room in the}} cockpit resulted in a lower seating position, increasing driver comfort (particularly for taller drivers), driver safety and improving <b>cornering</b> <b>speeds</b> by lowering the centre of gravity.|$|R
5000|$|The DeltaWing was {{designed}} to reduce aerodynamic drag dramatically, to allow a marginally faster straight and <b>corner</b> <b>speed</b> than a 2009-2011 Dallara IndyCar on both ovals and road/street courses with half as much weight, engine power and fuel consumption. As the name suggests, it has a delta wing shape, with an unusually narrow 0.6 m front track and a more traditional 1.7 m rear track. The car lacks any front or rear wings - downforce comes from the underbody. In 2012, the engine was a four-cylinder turbocharged direct injection 300 bhp unit assembled by Ray Mallock Engineering with largely Chevrolet parts. [...] The model to run at Le Mans had a 40 L fuel tank, bespoke BBS 15 in wheels and Michelin tyres, a weight of 475 kg, a power-to-weight ratio of 631 brake horsepower per ton, and a drag coefficient of 0.35.|$|E

According to Gilliland, [...] "They threw a curveball at us this morning with the restrictor plate and (engine builder) Doug Yates wasn't worried at all.

50|$|Successful BFM {{requires}} geometry {{as much as}} it does {{skill and}} stamina. Pilots must know their aircraft's <b>corner</b> <b>speed,</b> as well as optimum angles of bank (AOB) and angles of attack (AOA), without consciously thinking about them. At the same time, pilots must remain conscious of the angle between the opponent's velocity vector and their own, called the track crossing angle (TCA), which is important when aligning or avoiding a firing solution. Most importantly, the pilot must remain aware of the angle off tail (AOT), which is the angle between flight paths. A high AOT causes a high rate of closure, but makes achieving a suitable guns solution nearly impossible. Acquiring a low AOT, (getting on an enemy's tail), can decrease or even reverse closure rate, and is usually the primary goal before an overshoot occurs. However, an uncooperative defender may try {{to take advantage of the}} high closure rate by turning to increase AOT, forcing an overshoot.|$|E

5000|$|The V-twin {{water-cooled}} two-stroke {{used the}} same crankcase reed-valve induction as the Honda NSR500 V4. The 100-degree V2 also used a single crankshaft, a feature common to all of Honda's GP race bikes of the time. Weighing in at 103 kg, it produced a claimed [...] when running on hi-octane avgas. Although it made less power than its V4 counterpart (some 40-50 hp less), it was lighter, easier to ride and better handling. At many circuits it was capable of lapping just {{as fast as a}} V4, given a clear track. Its main strength was being able to carry a higher <b>corner</b> <b>speed</b> than the V4. However its weakness became apparent in traffic. If the V2 lost its momentum through the corner, a V4 was able to use its better acceleration and power to pull away. It was nevertheless to fulfil its purpose of being a competitive and realistic machine for private teams.|$|E
5000|$|Shawn Windsor of the Detroit Free Press {{said that}} {{lowering}} [...] "the downforce {{on the front}} of the cars let drivers rip along the long, wide straightways at MIS pushing 220 m.p.h. The increased speed â and alternately slower <b>corner</b> <b>speed</b> â meant drivers had more opportunity to maneuver and actually drive their cars." [...] He also noted that [...] "the speed difference between the turns and the straightaway was as much as 40 m.p.h. This means â in theory â drivers have a chance to really maneuver as they hit the stretch. And that means they need more control of their cars, which NASCAR aimed to give them with the new rules that let teams lower the downforce. The flip side, as Logano pointed out, is that extra speed and more bunched-together drivers â feeling like they have more control â 'is a recipe for disaster.' That recipe might be good for ratings, however. Everyone agrees the sport needs more passing, more jockeying. Itâs in the heat of the scrum that reveals personalities, shows us who is willing to live on the edge and who is not." ...|$|E
50|$|Though a high thrust-to-weight {{ratio and}} high {{aerodynamic}} maneuverability are found on both aerodynamic and supermaneuvering aircraft, the technology most {{directly linked to}} supermaneuverability is thrust vectoring, in which the geometry of the exhaust nozzle of a traditional jet engine can be modified to angle the engine's thrust in a direction other than directly to the rear (i.e., upwards or downwards). This applies force {{to the rear of}} the aircraft in the opposite direction similar to a conventional control surface, but unlike a control surface the force from the vectored thrust is dependent on current engine thrust, not airspeed; thus thrust vectoring not only augments control surfaces (generally that of the elevators) at speed, but allows the aircraft to retain maximum maneuverability below <b>corner</b> <b>speed</b> and some attitude control below stall speed while in maneuvers. Technology demonstrators such as the X-31, F-16 VISTA and F-15 S/MTD were built to showcase the capabilities of an aircraft using this technology; it has since been incorporated into pre-production and production fighters such as the F-22 Raptor. Eastern Bloc design companies have also introduced this technology into variants of fourth-generation aircraft such as the MiG-29 and Su-27 to produce the MiG-29OVT tech demonstrator and Su-30MKI air superiority fighter respectively, and planned fifth-generation Russian-designed aircraft such as the Sukhoi Su-57 will use the technology as well. In addition domestic Russian Su-30 fighters will be upgraded with thrust vectoring engines.|$|E
