6000|$|The {{owner is}} a man called John Ford, about seventy, and {{seventeen}} stone in weight--very big, on long legs, with a grey, stubbly beard, grey, watery eyes, short neck and purplish complexion; he is asthmatic, and has a very courteous, autocratic manner. His clothes are made of Harris tweed--except on Sundays, when he puts on black--a seal ring, and a thick gold <b>cable</b> <b>chain.</b> There's nothing mean or small about John Ford; I suspect him of a warm heart, but he doesn't let you know much about him. He's a north-country man by birth, and has been out in New Zealand all his life. This little Devonshire farm is all he has now. He had a large [...] "station" [...] in the North Island, and was much looked up to, kept open house, did everything, as one would guess, in a narrow-minded, large-handed way. He came to grief suddenly; I don't quite know how. I believe his only son lost money on the turf, and then, unable to face his father, shot himself; if you had seen John Ford, you could imagine that. His wife died, too, that year. He paid {{up to the last}} penny, and came home, to live on this farm. He told me the other night that he had only one relation in the world, his granddaughter, who lives here with him. Pasiance Voisey--old spelling for Patience, but they pronounce, it Pash-yence--is sitting out here with me at this moment on a sort of rustic loggia that opens into the orchard. Her sleeves are rolled up, and she's stripping currants, ready for black currant tea. Now and then she rests her elbows on the table, eats a berry, pouts her lips, and, begins again. She has a round, little face; a long, slender body; cheeks like poppies; a bushy mass of black-brown hair, and dark-brown, almost black, eyes; her nose is snub; her lips quick, red, rather full; all her motions quick and soft. She loves bright colours. She's rather like a little cat; sometimes she seems all sympathy, then in a moment as hard as tortoise-shell. She's all impulse; yet she doesn't like to show her feelings; I sometimes wonder whether she has any. She plays the violin.|$|E

50|$|Some gravity railroads were {{designed}} to allow {{the weight of the}} descending loaded cars to lift the empty cars back up to the top, using a cable looped around a pulley at the top for a portion of the line. A later revision designed by John B. Jervis, used two separate tracks known as the loaded or heavy track which carried cars loaded with coal to the destination, and the light track, used to return empty cars to the mines. This method allowed cars to travel in a loop, without the need for passing sidings. A stationary steam engine and a looping <b>cable,</b> <b>chain</b> or iron bands were used to raise the empty cars up the lift planes. The cars then coasted down a slight grade to the next lift plane. When cars reversed direction at the ends of the line on a switch or turnout instead of a loop, the railroad was known as a switchback gravity railroad.|$|E

40|$|The gold {{market is}} one of the major world markets and the Italian {{companies}} place the country as one of the major players in this sector. However, the production in these companies is mostly based on the use of artisan skills, without investing in research and studies about the production processes of these materials. In fact, often the process depends on a "craft" way of working, in which the technical and scientific knowledge are dictated more by experience than by a systematic scientific approach. The international bibliography regarding the world of machining of gold alloys is not as developed as in the case of other metal alloys (steels and aluminum alloys), in which the aesthetic appearance is much less important than the functional aspect. The increase in the nationally and internationally competitiveness caused a growing interest to the study of these materials and their metallurgical properties, with the need to create more complex products that are able to maintaining their extremely high quality. Many of the metallurgical concepts of other materials (in particular face-centered cubic structure alloys) can be applied to gold alloys. However, the greatest variety in composition, the well-defined standards in form, the mechanical and aesthetic properties that they have to satisfy, made necessary the knowledge of mode and characteristics, with which the different constituents influencing the machining, heat treatments and the final quality of the semi-finished product. In the first part of the thesis, the main properties of pure gold and gold alloys will be presented, with a particular attention to the main jewelry production technologies and the main usage of gold in the world market. In first chapter the supply, demand and pricing of gold will be generally described to allow an easy collocation of the information contained and the results explained in this thesis, in a larger context such as the world gold market. After, in chapter 2, will be described the main features of gold, which make its the most important metal used for the production of precious artifacts. The attention will be focused mainly on the electronic configuration of gold, and on the physical, optical, and crystallographic properties that result from this. In chapter 3, the aim is to introduce the metallurgical principles of alloying for improve particular properties, such as strengthening, or for adjust other characteristics of gold alloys in order to meet certain requirements. Will be introduced the industrial operations of casting, deformation, heat treatment, and interesting using of innovative approaches to the goldsmith production. Chapter 4 is an overview of the main technologies used in gold jewelry manufacture, the aim is to give a more complete idea of the means of the term “jewelry”, and of the key role of a scientific approach, or the scientific research, focused to improve and develop the industrial production system. The second part of this thesis summarizes the work carried out during the three-year Ph. D in Industrial Engineering. The objectives of the project are the determination of the relationships between the composition and different properties of the gold alloys (the caratage, the color, the mechanical properties,…) used by the goldsmith company in the different stage of the production cycle for the realization of full pipe and <b>cable</b> <b>chain.</b> In particular will be studied the effect of the various constituents and their quantity in the alloys, the mechanical properties and the weldability of these. The investigation will be performed from the melting process, through different plastic deformation and annealing steps, until the realization of the welded semi-finished product. A further objective of the project is the study of the mechanisms of plastic deformation of the different alloys used in the company, in order to optimize the processes of deformation and heat treatments depending on the material used, the various alloying elements and the different production cycles. In chapter 5, will be briefly described the experimental apparatus used for the characterization of the samples (taken from the whole production process in the goldsmith company FilK S. p. A.), in the laboratories of the Department of Industrial Engineering of the Padua University. In chapter 6, will be described the production cycle of the gold welding wires used to solder the hollow gold chain produced. The effect of the microstructure and residual stresses on the corrosion and mechanical properties will be discussed. The study will focus on the control of production parameters in order to improve machinability of the gold wires and to increase their properties. In chapter 7, a statistic analysis of some mechanical and compositional characteristics of gold alloy wires will be reported. The purpose is to individuate an approximation of the possible existing influences and relationships between these and the energy absorbed during deformation. The properties that will be investigated are elongation, Young modulus, ultimate strength and the concentration of gold. In Chapter 8, the production processes of gold alloys plates will be described. The aim of this part of thesis is to optimize the microstructure and the mechanical properties of the products, which, successively, will be welded to an iron sheet to create the base for the final hollow chain products. The parameters of production cycles and the intrinsic properties of the different gold alloys will be studied, with particular attention to the stresses and the microstructures generated from the subsequent deformation and annealing steps. Finally, in chapter 9 the plating process will be analyzed, in order to define the influence of the process parameters on the characteristics of the semi-finished products. Furthermore, different ageing treatments for various gold alloy compositions will be described, the results will allow to optimize time and temperature of the age-hardening treatments for the company’s gold alloys. The whole production tests were performed, in collaboration with Ing. Fabrizio Furlan, in Filk S. p. A., the goldsmith company partner of this collaboration and unique supplier of the material for this research. The main part of the characterization of the different gold samples was carried out at the metallurgy laboratories in the Department of Industrial Engineering, University of Padua, under the supervision of prof. Manuele Dabalà and in collaboration with Ing. Luca Pezzato. Some analyzes, especially the chemical etching of the specimens with different solutions of cyanides, have been performed at other structure: in the laboratories of Progold S. p. A. in collaboration with Ing. Daniele Maggian, Dr. Patrizio Sbornicchia and Dr. Valerio Doppio. The obtained results allowed improving the workability of the gold alloys used by the company with a reduction of the industrial wastes. The optimization of the production parameters, in the different processes, allowed to increase the microstructural quality of the semi-finished products with an improvement on the mechanical and metallurgical characteristics. A suitable control on the production processes and, the optimization of the gold alloy’s compositions, allowed to increase the constancy, the reproducibility of the results and the quality in the production of hollow and cable pipe chains. The obtained results also have a scientific relevance that have allowed their presentation in numerous national and international conferences and publication in scientific journals as reported at the end of the thesis. ...|$|E
