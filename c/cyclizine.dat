40|$|The {{investigations}} {{detailed in}} this dissertation {{have been conducted}} to address the paucity of pharmacokinetic information, in published literature, pertaining to <b>cyclizine.</b> The areas of investigation have included the selective quantitation of both <b>cyclizine</b> and its demethylated metabolite, norcyclizine in serum and urine, assessment of stability of both compounds in stored biological samples, dosage form analysis, dissolution rate testing of tablets, and bioavailability and pharmacokinetics following administration of an intravenous solution, and tablets to humans. High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) {{was used as the}} main analytical technique throughout these studies. An original HPLC method employing ultraviolet detection with a limit of quantitation of 5 μg/ℓ was developed for the determination of <b>cyclizine</b> in serum and both <b>cyclizine</b> and norcyclizine in urine, Solid-phase extraction using extraction columns packed with reversed-phase C 18 material, and followed by a simple phase-separation step proved successful for the accurate and precise isolation of the compounds. The validated method was applied to the analysis of serum and urine samples from a pilot study in which a single volunteer was administered 50 mg of <b>cyclizine</b> hydrochloride. Several samples collected during the pilot study revealed the presence of both drug and metabolite in concentrations below the limit of detection. In order to improve the selectivity and sensitivity of the analytical method an HPLC method with electrochemical detection operating in the "oxidative-screen" mode was developed. The solid-phase extraction procedure was modified slightly and the method found to be precise, accurate, selective and highly sensitive with a limit of quantitation of Iμg/g/l for both <b>cyclizine</b> and norcyclizine in both serum and urine. This method was applied to the determination of both compounds after intravenous and oral administration of <b>cyclizine</b> to humans. HPLC with electrochemical detection was used for the analysis of samples collected during dissolution studies on the batch of tablets used for pharmacokinetic studies. In addition, this method was used to assess content uniformity of the tablets and of samples from the batch of intravenous ampoules of <b>cyclizine</b> lactate. Dissolution studies showed that all tablets tested passed the compendial specifications for <b>cyclizine.</b> Content uniformity assessment revealed that within-batch uniformity existed for both the tablets and ampoules and, therefore, variations in pharmacokinetic parameters for the drug would more than likely be as a result of inter- and intra-individual variability within the subject population. Pharmacokinetic information for <b>cyclizine</b> was obtained following administration of an intravenous bolus dose of <b>cyclizine</b> lactate as a solution, oral administration of <b>cyclizine</b> hydrochloride as a single dose of 50 mg and as fixed multiple doses of 50 mg every 8 hours for five days. Further information was acquired following administration of single doses of 100 mg and 150 mg <b>cyclizine</b> hydrochloride. Data collected from these studies were evaluated using both compartmental and non-compartmental techniques. <b>Cyclizine</b> was rapidly absorbed following oral administration with mean kₐ = 1. 54 hr⁻¹ and was found to have an absolute bioavailability (F) of 0. 47. The presence of norcyclizine in serum following oral and not intravenous dosing suggests <b>cyclizine</b> is susceptible to "first-pass" metabolism in either the gut wall or the I iver. Mean ClTOT determined following the intravenous dose was 0. 865 ℓ/hr/kg. The mean ClTOT of 0. 823 ℓ/hr/kg calculated following oral dosing, using a unique value of F for each subject compared favourahly with that obtained following intravenous dosing. Renal clearance of <b>cyclizine</b> is negligihle indicating that non-renal routes of elimination account for the majority of removal of <b>cyclizine</b> form the body. <b>Cyclizine</b> is extensively distributed and the mean Vz following an intravenous dose was 16. 70 ℓ/kg. This value is lower than that calculated from all oral studies from which the mean Vz was determined to be 25. 74 ℓ/kg. <b>Cyclizine</b> is eliminated slowly with a mean elimination t½ = 20. 11 hours. <b>Cyclizine</b> dose not appear to follow dosedependent kinetics and therefore, inability to predict steady state levels are more than likely due to accumulation as a result of frequent dosing rather than saturation of elimination mechanisms. Modelling of intravenous data to one-compartment (lBCM), two-compartment (2 BCM) and threecompartment models indicated that the pharmacokinetics of <b>cyclizine</b> can be adequately described by a 3 BCM. The drug is rapidly distributed into a "shallow" peripheral compartment (α = 9. 44 hr⁻¹, and k₂₁ = 2. 09 hr⁻¹), and slowly distributed to the "deep" peripheral compartment (β = 0. 451 hr⁻¹ and k₃₁ = 0. 120 hr⁻¹). Modelling of all oral data indicated that a 2 BCM best described the pharmacokinetics of the drug, however, distribution to the peripheral compartment is not as rapid as to the "shallow" peripheral compartment following the intravenous dose. Mean distribution parameters were α = 0. 64 hr⁻¹ 1 and, k₂₁ = 0. 39 hr⁻¹. Mean CITOT following intravenous dosing of 0. 70 ℓ/hr/kg was similar to the mean CIToT of 0. 73 ℓ/hr/kg determined after oral dosing. The mean distribution volume at steady state determined following intravenous dosing (17. 78 ℓ/kg) was lower than that obtained from the oral studies (25. 52 ℓ/kg). The mean terminal elimination half-lives calculated for <b>cyclizine</b> following fitting of intravenous and oral data was 25. 09 hours. In general, mean pharmacokinetic parameters calculated following titting of data to a 2 BCM after oral administration correlate closely with those calculated using non-compartmental techniques. However, the pharmacokinetics following intravenous dosing are better described by a 3 BCM and a close correlation between parameters estimated using noncompartmental techniques and compartmental techniques is evident when a 3 BCM model is used. ...|$|E

40|$|Background Post-operative {{nausea and}} {{vomiting}} (PONV) is common, especially following gynaecological surgery. Patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) is frequently complicated by nausea. We assessed PONV, pain and sedation in patients receiving <b>cyclizine</b> or droperidol during PCA following abdominal hysterectomy in a double-blind trial. Methods Thirty women were randomised to receive either <b>cyclizine</b> 0. 7 mg/kg or droperidol 0. 04 mg/kg during surgery followed by PCA containing morphine sulphate with <b>cyclizine</b> 2 mg or droperidol 0. 05 mg per demand. Blinded observers scored levels of nausea, sedation, anxiety and pain. Results Pain scores, PCA usage and supplemental antiemetic requirements were comparable. Nausea and sedation scores {{were similar in}} both groups. Two patients in each group developed refractory PONV. Pre-operative anxiety scores were similar and decreased comparably over time. Patients developing refractory emetic sequelae had {{a higher incidence of}} previous PONV. Previous PONV also predicted lower PCA medication intake despite similar demand rates, suggesting increased usage during lock-out periods. Conclusion Prophylactic <b>cyclizine</b> and droperidol have similar efficacy during PCA. Neither is associated with perioperative anxiety. A minority of patients have refractory PONV during PCA.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D. (Pharmaceutics)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2004. A {{comprehensive}} review of the nasal route of administration, in particular the nasal drug delivery system has been presented. The physicochemical properties, mode of action and pharmacology of H 1 -receptor antagonists, in particular <b>cyclizine</b> HCl, have been highlighted. The techniques {{for the assessment of}} toxicity (in-vitro ciliary beat frequency (CBF) studies for human nasal explants and morphology studies of the rat nasal mucosa), synthesis of <b>cyclizine</b> lactate, solubility studies of both <b>cyclizine</b> HCI and <b>cyclizine</b> lactate, viscosity determination of the gel formulated and assessment of the deposition and distribution of the hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose (HPMC) dispersions within the human nasal cavity model were conducted. In this study, preliminary studies on the toxicity of the various formulation components (excipients and active ingredient) were carried out. Results from these studies indicated that for both the excipients and the drug, pH significantly affects the ciliary motility hence all ciliary beat frequency determinations were conducted at nasal pH. Furthermore, effects of the various concentrations (0. 0625 %(w/v), 0. 125 %(w/v), 0. 25 %(w/v), 0. 5 %(w/v) and l%(w/v)) of the excipients on ciliary motility were investigated. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) studies proved useful in evaluating the integrity and changes in the surface morphology of the rat nasal mucosa post treatment with the various excipients (carboxymethyl cellulose, hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose, trimethyl chitosan 36. 3 % DQ, Carbopol P 934 and polysorbate- 80) at varying concentrations. Of the excipients investigated, hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose (HPMC) showed ciliofriendliness since there was no apparent ultra structural damage, although a slight decrease in ciliary beat frequency (CBF) was observed at the highest viscosity. Moreover, hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose (HPMC) {{is said to be a}} bioadhesive excipient, which would therefore confer its bioadhesive properties to the intranasal preparation to enhance the retention time between the absorbing mucosa and the drug and hence increase nasal drug absorption. This excipient was therefore selected as the ideal for use in the formulation of the intranasal preparation. The aqueous solubility of a drug plays an important role in nasal administration since it is required that the drug component be applied in a limited volume of about 200 pl. To enhance the aqueous solubility of the sparingly water-soluble <b>cyclizine</b> HCl, a lactate salt was synthesised and characterised. This compound was found to be highly soluble in water. The intranasal preparation was therefore manufactured using the lactate form of <b>cyclizine.</b> A single blind study was conducted to determine and compare the pharmacokinetic parameters for both Valoid oral tablets containing 100 mg <b>cyclizine</b> HCl (reference drug) and <b>cyclizine</b> lactate intranasal preparation 125 mglml (study drug). The results obtained indicated a significant improvement in the bioavailability of <b>cyclizine.</b> For oral administration Cmax = 200. 79 ng/ml at tmax = 5. 57 h and for the intranasal preparation Cmax = 5354. 22 ng/ml at tmax = 1. 59 h. A 19. 2 -fold increase in drug bioavailability was observed after intranasal administration (AUCin = 122860. 70 ng/ml/h) compared with oral administration (AUCpo = 5943. 48 ng/ml/h). This enhanced bioavailability through nasal administration indicated that enhanced nasal drug absorption and hence increased bioavailability not only depends on the favourable anatomical and physiological characteristics of the nasal mucosa but possibly on the inherent physico-chemical characteristics of the drug molecule and the formulation components. Thus chemical modification of the sparingly water-soluble <b>cyclizine</b> HCl to the highly water-soluble <b>cyclizine</b> lactate facilitated the dissolution of more solute in a limited volume of solvent. This new feature therefore may have impacted positively to the transport of <b>cyclizine</b> across the nasal mucosa. Furthermore, the hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose (HPMC), component of the formulation, could have conferred its mucoadhesive properties to the preparation. Perhaps it increased the retention time of the dosage form within the nasal passages through bond formation with the nasal mucosa thereby increasing the contact time between the absorbing mucosa and the dosage form. This interaction between the mucoadhesive and the nasal mucosa may have resulted in the modification of tissue permeability (possibly transient opening of the tight junctions) and eventual increase in the drug penetration/absorption.
