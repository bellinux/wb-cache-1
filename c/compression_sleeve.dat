40|$|Aim. The {{purpose was}} to examine the changes in tissue oxygen {{saturation}} (StO 2) in response to the application of different commercially available calf <b>compression</b> <b>sleeves.</b> Methods. Eight subjects came to the laboratory to complete a session in seated position including 10 [*]min of quiet rest followed by 3 [*]min measuring calf StO 2 without <b>compression</b> <b>sleeves</b> and then alternating of 3 [*]min of passive rest and 3 [*]min measuring StO 2 with calf <b>compression</b> <b>sleeves.</b> A total of 15 different commercially available <b>compression</b> <b>sleeves</b> were studied in a randomized order. Calf StO 2 was recorded using near-infrared spectroscopy. Results. StO 2 was significantly increased with all <b>compression</b> <b>sleeves</b> p< 0. 05 compared with no compression (from + 6. 9 % for the least effective to + 22. 6 % for the most effective). Large differences were observed between <b>compression</b> <b>sleeves</b> p< 0. 05. StO 2 was positively correlated with compression pressure (p< 0. 05; r= 0. 84). Conclusion.

We conducted this study to compare the impact of different pressure rates on the hemolysis of packed red blood cells and on the outlet temperature when a blood warmer set at 41. 5 °C is used. Pressure rates tested were 150 and 300 mmHg. Ten packed red blood cells units were provided by Héma-Québec and each unit was sequentially tested. We found no increase in hemolysis either at 150 or 300 mmHg. By cons, we found that the blood warmer was not effective at warming the red blood cells at the specified temperature.

40|$|Hypothesis: The {{creation}} of positive-pressure pneumoperitoneum during laparoscopic operations {{can lead to}} adverse hemodynamic changes, mainly decreased cardiac output. We hypothesized that pneumatic <b>compression</b> <b>sleeves</b> worn on the legs during pneumoperitoneum could abolish the pressure gradient between the abdominal cavity and the legs and so eliminate these adverse hemodynamic changes. Design Prospective, randomized, controlled clinical trial with an additional calibration group. Setting A regional referral center. Patients Forty-five consecutive patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy who developed hemodynamic changes on induction of positive-pressure pneumoperitoneum were randomized to 3 groups. Interventions Low-pressure, nonsequential pneumatic <b>compression</b> <b>sleeves,</b> wrapped around the legs, were used to equilibrate the pressure gradient in the study group and to gradually exceed it in the calibration group. In the control group, no sleeves were used. Main Outcome Measures Transesophageal Doppler cardiac output, stroke volume, and systemic vascular resistance were monitored noninvasively. Results: The {{creation of}} positive-pressure pneumoperitoneum caused a significant decrease of cardiac output and stroke volume and increased systemic vascular resistance. In the experimental groups of patients, pressurizing the sleeves to the pneumoperitoneal pressure caused a significant increase of cardiac output (from 4. 82 to 6. 74 L/min), increased stroke volume, and decreased systemic vascular resistance (P<. 001). This was not seen in the control group. Additional gradual pressure increase in the sleeves of the calibration group produced no further improvement. Releasing the pressure abolished the hemodynamic advantages. Conclusions: Applying pressure on the legs equivalent to the positive-pressure pneumoperitoneum improves hemodynamic performance during pneumoperitoneum by nullifying the pressure gradient {{that is responsible for}} the adverse consequences. This might be of major practical value, especially for cardiac patients undergoing prolonged laparoscopic operations...|$|R

40|$|Exercise {{training}} {{is known to}} increase endothelial function and provoke arterial remodelling both locally and systemically. This thesis was designed to further examine these relationships by investigating the acute response to different exercise intensities, with and without shear rate modification. Shear rate modification was also {{used to examine the}} impact of systemic exercise training on brachial haemodynamics. Finally, the effect of inactivity on vascular function and arterial remodelling were studied using novel models of inactivity. The aim of Study 1 was to examine the effect of shear stress on upper limb brachial artery dilation during acute cycle exercise of different intensities. The impact of three randomised bouts of 30 mins leg cycling (50, 70 and 85 % HRmax) on brachial artery blood flow, shear rate (SR) and brachial diameter, was measured bilaterally and simultaneously. SR was further manipulated in one arm via forearm heating (40 ? 1 ?C) in a water bath (+ 0 C) throughout the exercise bouts. Exercise induced stepwise increases in SR in the unheated arm (~ 0 C) (P 0. 05 vs. baseline), 7 % (70 %HRmax; P O. 05) across the 8 week intervention period. These data suggest that lower limb cycle training induces a transient increase in upper limb vascular function in healthy young humans which is, at least partly, mediated via shear stress. Exercise {{training is}} associated with rapid changes in endothelial function, which occur within days of starting training. Whilst long-term physical inactivity has a strong effect on vascular structure, {{little is known about the}} immediate impact of inactivity on vascular function. Therefore, Study 4 measured changes in vascular function before, during (day 4) and after 8 days of unilateral forearm inactivity induced by wearing a sling on the non-dominant arm. Maximal handgrip strength of the inactive forearm decreased after 8 days, confirming physical deconditioning. There were no significant changes in brachial artery baseline diameter, FMD, iEX or GTN across the 8 days in either arm (P> 0. 05). A significant decrease in peak blood flow was found in the intervention arm (2 -way interaction: P= 0. 03) that is suggestive of remodelling of forearm resistance vessels. However, measures of (largely and partly) NO-mediated endothelial conduit artery function were not altered across an 8 day period of inactivity. Whilst increases in mean arterial shear stress are known to induce improvements in arterial function and remodelling in humans, animal data have demonstrated that retrograde shear is associated with pro-atherogenic effects. However, relatively little is known regarding the effect of retrograde shear rate on vascular function in humans in vivo. In order to provoke retrograde shear, subjects wore a <b>compression</b> <b>sleeve</b> on one forearm for 8 clays. Measurements were taken before and during acute (lhr) exposure to a <b>compression</b> <b>sleeve</b> on baseline day O. Measurements were taken after 4 and 8 days exposure to the <b>compression</b> <b>sleeve.</b> There were no significant changes in mean or antegrade shear rate during exposure to the <b>compression</b> <b>sleeve.</b> However, the <b>compression</b> <b>sleeve</b> resulted in an immediate increase in retrograde shear rate in 6 subjects (P O. 05, control-group) i. e. subjects in whom the <b>compression</b> <b>sleeve</b> did not increase retrograde shear were the control group. The intervention group demonstrated a significant decrease in FMD after 1 h <b>compression</b> <b>sleeve</b> (P O. 05). After 8 -days using the <b>compression</b> <b>sleeve,</b> no significant changes in FMD, iEX, or GTN-response in the intervention and control group (all P>O. 05) were observed.

40|$|Aim of the {{research}} : The {{aim of this study}} was to answer the question of whether wearing compression products on the upper limb in the second phase of complex decongestive therapy (CDT) can be replaced with lymphatic application of kinesiology taping. The importance of antiedematous prophylaxis and the impact of complementary treatment on the results of physiotherapeutic management were assessed. Material and methods: Retrospective analysis was applied in 80 women after mastectomy treated for lymphoedema in the Holycross Cancer Centre in Kielce. The method CDT was applied in all the patients in phase I. In phase II, 50 (62 %) women used <b>compression</b> <b>sleeves</b> in everyday life, and lymphatic applications of Kinesiology Taping (KT) were introduced in 30 (38 %) patients. The research included the following: interview, linear measurement of the upper limb circumferences, palpation of tissues, and assessment of pain; statistical analysis in terms of these parameters was also performed. Results : Application of antiedematous prophylaxis was confirmed by 65 % of the women, and complementary treatment was introduced in 75 % of the patients from both groups. After phase I of the CDT a significant reduction in the circumferences of the limb in patients from both groups was demonstrated. Comparable results were observed after phase II, but in the second group the circumferences underwent a slight increase. After phases I and II of the therapy there was a beneficial change in the consistency, from hard into soft in both groups. Conclusions : The applied antiedematous prophylaxis was not essential in the course of the treatment. Introduction of radiotherapy had a significant impact on the state of the oedema. Application of physiotherapy resulted in an improvement in the oedema parameters in all the patients after phase I of the therapy. The results were maintained in the phase II in the women who used <b>compression</b> <b>sleeves.</b> Applications of KT did not provide an improvement of the state of the limb circumferences in phase II, but they affected the maintenance of the right oedema consistency and caused a reduction in pain...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} whether calf <b>compression</b> <b>sleeves</b> (CS) affects physiological and biomechanical parameters, exercise performance, and perceived sensations of muscle fatigue, pain and soreness during prolonged (~ 2 h 30 min) outdoor trail running. Methods: Fourteen healthy trained males took part in a randomized, cross-over study consisting in two identical 24 -km trail running sessions (each including one bout of running at constant rate on moderately flat terrain, and one period of all-out running on hilly terrain) wearing either degressive CS (23 ± 2 mmHg) or control sleeves (CON, & 4 mmHg). Running time, heart rate and muscle oxygenation of the medial gastrocnemius muscle (measured using portable near-infrared spectroscopy) were monitored continuously. Muscle functional capabilities (power, stiffness) were determined using 20 s of maximal hopping before and after both sessions. Running biomechanics (kinematics, vertical and leg stiffness) were determined at 12 km·h− 1 at the beginning, during, and at the end of both sessions. Exercise-induced Achilles tendon pain and delayed onset calf muscles soreness (DOMS) were assessed using visual analog scales. Results: Muscle oxygenation increased significantly in CS compared to CON at baseline and immediately after exercise (p & 0. 05), without any difference in deoxygenation kinetics during the run, and without any significant change in run times. Wearing CS was associated with (i) higher aerial time and leg stiffness in running at constant rate, (ii) with lower ground contact time, higher leg stiffness, and higher vertical stiffness in all-out running, and (iii) with lower ground contact time in hopping. Significant DOMS were induced in both CS and CON (> 6 on a 10 -cm scale) with no difference between conditions. However, Achilles tendon pain was significantly lower after the trial in CS than CON (p & 0. 05). Discussion: Calf compression did not modify muscle oxygenation during ~ 2 h 30 of trail running but significantly changed running biomechanics and lower limb muscle functional capabilities toward a more dynamic behavior compared to control session. However, wearing <b>compression</b> <b>sleeves</b> did not affect performance and exercise-induced DOMS, while it minimized Achilles tendon pain immediately after running...|$|R

Foot temperature was recorded for the 10 minutes during running and 5 minutes immediately after. Heart rate and subjective ratings of perceived comfort and heat were recorded throughout. There {{were no significant differences in}} foot temperature across socks during or after running. Subjects perceived their feet as being warmer in the cotton and blend socks compared to the synthetic sock or the blend sock plus the sleeve. There were no differences in comfort perception across trials. Expectedly, there was a trial order effect for subjects who didn’t warm up such that foot temperature was higher in later trials compared to earlier trials. These results suggest that (a) socks of differing materials may transfer heat similarly, (b) wearing a calf <b>compression</b> <b>sleeve</b> influences perceptions of foot temperature, and (c) subjects perceptions of foot temperature may not coincide with actual temperature.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this article is to provide a {{systematic}} review of Combined Physical Therapy, Intermittent Pneumatic Compression and arm elevation for the treatment of lymphoedema secondary to an axillary dissection for breast cancer. Combined Physical Therapy starts with an intensive phase consisting of skin care, Manual Lymphatic Drainage, exercises and bandaging and continues with a maintenance phase consisting of skin care, exercises, wearing a <b>compression</b> <b>sleeve</b> and Manual Lymphatic Drainage if needed. We have searched the following databases: PubMed/MEDLINE, CINAHL, EMBASE, PEDro and Cochrane. Only (pseudo-) randomised controlled trials and non-randomised experimental trials investigating the effectiveness of Combined Physical Therapy and its different parts, of Intermittent Pneumatic Compression and of arm elevation were included. These physical treatments had to be applied to patients with arm lymphoedema which developed after axillary dissection for breast cancer. Ten randomised controlled trials, one pseudo-randomised controlled trial and four non-randomised experimental trials were found and analysed. Combined Physical Therapy can be considered as an effective treatment modality for lymphoedema. Bandaging the arm is effective, whether its effectiveness is investigated on a heterogeneous group consisting of patients with upper and lower limb lymphoedema from different causes. There is no consensus on the effectiveness of Manual Lymphatic Drainage. The effectiveness of skin care, exercises, wearing a <b>compression</b> <b>sleeve</b> and arm elevation is not investigated by a controlled trial. Intermittent Pneumatic Compression is effective, but once the treatment is interrupted, the lymphoedema volume increases. In conclusion, Combined Physical Therapy is an effective therapy for lymphoedema. However, the effectiveness of its different components remains uncertain. Furthermore, high-quality studies are warranted. The long-term effect of Intermittent Pneumatic Compression and the effect of elevation on lymphoedema are not yet proven. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Background Although acute {{elevation}} in retrograde {{shear rate}} (SR) impairs endothelial function, {{no previous study}} has explored the effect of prolonged elevation of retrograde SR on conduit artery vascular function. We examined the effect of 2 ‐weeks elevation of retrograde SR on brachial artery endothelial function in young and in older men. Methods and Results Thirteen healthy young (23 ± 2 years) and 13 older men (61 ± 5 years) were instructed to continuously wear a <b>compression</b> <b>sleeve</b> around the right forearm to chronically (2 weeks) elevate brachial artery retrograde SR in 1 arm. We assessed SR, diameter, and flow‐mediated dilation in both the sleeve and contralateral control arms at baseline and after 30 minutes and 2 weeks of continuous sleeve application. The sleeve intervention increased retrograde SR after 30 minutes and 2 weeks in both young and older men (P= 0. 03 and 0. 001, respectively). In young men, brachial artery flow‐mediated dilation...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to {{evaluate}} the clinical results of the Headless Compression Screw (HCS, Synthes) when used for treatment of acute scaphoid waist fractures. The new screw design generates interfragmentary compression with use of a <b>compression</b> <b>sleeve.</b> Twenty-one patients were treated for acute scaphoid waist fractures type B 2 with HCS screws. The average time to the final follow-up examination was 12. 8 months. All 21 fractures united after a mean time of 7. 2 weeks. The mean DASH score was 7. 1. The average motion of the wrist in extension was 61 °, flexion was 46 °, radial abduction reached 25 ° and the ulnar abduction was 31 °. The maximally achieved grip strength was 86 % compared to the uninjured side. Treatment of type B 2 scaphoid fractures with the Headless Compression Screw showed good functional and radiographic results. The results are similar to those identified using other screw fixation systems...|$|E
40|$|In {{the present}} work, {{mechanical}} behaviour of <b>compression</b> arm <b>sleeves</b> based on knitted fabrics has been reported. Rib fabrics were developed using 95 % polyamide knitting yarns and 5 % polyamide covered elastane yarns as inlays using stockings technology. Samples were produced varying the characteristics (fineness of elastane core and polyamide cover) of elastane yarns {{in order to}} investigate its influence {{on the performance of}} knitted arm sleeves. The performance of developed arm sleeves was characterized in terms of level of compression that can be achieved as well as the permanent deformation and energy dissipation, which occurs during stretching. It was observed that the compression performance improved significantly with the linear density of elastane core and the improvement is higher for finer cover yarns. However, the energy dissipation and permanent deformation in the first stretching cycle also increased with the fineness of elastane core and therefore, proper selection of elastane yarn is extremely necessary to achieve required degree of compression with minimum permanent deformation while stretching...|$|R
40|$|Physical {{exercise}} is challenging {{for individuals who}} are blind because they lack the spatial awareness necessary to imitate described motions for exercises, and additionally require physical guidance. The current solutions involve tactile equipment to assist in body placement, but a person with low vision cannot compare their own position to the correct position and adjust properly. The proposed solution is an instructional yoga program that will give feedback to the user based on her exercise performance, allowing {{people who are blind}} to be able to perform these exercises independently at home. The design will incorporate the Skeletal Tracking program of the Microsoft Kinect, which uses infrared waves to determine 3 D positions of twenty points on the body relative to one another. The program will use these points to determine the relative anatomical joint angles and relate them to the angles that correspond to the yoga positions. It will determine for each limb segment what motion is needed to match the desired yoga position. The user will then receive vibratory feedback on the portion of the limb in the direction in which it must move. There will be four vibrators each on the humerus and femur, one each for flexion, extension, abduction, and adduction, and two each on the forearm and lower leg, one for flexion and one for extension. Because only one of the vibrators corresponding to opposing motion will be on at a time, there are twelve channels of communication, each with three different positions (0 : both off, 1 : one on, - 1 : other on). Each limb will be adjusted and given feedback separately before the user holds the pose. A microcontroller will be programmed to activate the appropriate vibrator based on data sent wirelessly from the computer. The vibrators will be attached to <b>compression</b> <b>sleeves,</b> so their positioning is constant and in contact with the skin. Our progress includes designing the software concept and program outline as well as determining the hardware needed to provide feedback including a parts list. We also chose yoga poses that we expect to be detectable by the Kinect, and vibrators that are compatible both with our hardware and the sensitivity of the mechanoreceptors. We initially were underestimating the complexity of the hardware needed for wireless communication and for controlling the actuators, but our advising and research allowed us to understand and make decisions about these design components. We also modified the number of vibrators in our design due to eliminating rotating motion, at the suggestion of our advisor. We learned about how low vision affects balance and coordination, exercising, and spatial awareness. [URL]...|$|R
40|$|The {{indicator}} {{is characterized}} by an elongated elastic body having extended from the opposite ends of threaded shanks adapted to selected tension members. A pair of external shoulders, {{one of which is}} axially displaceable relative to the other, and a rigid tubular sleeve interposed between said shoulders are included. Tension is applied to the elastic body for imparting strain. The movable shoulder can be advanced into abutting engagement with the sleeve, whereby the sleeve is placed in compression once the tensile forces are removed from the shanks. A reapplication of tensile forces equal to the initially applied tensile forces removes the <b>sleeve</b> from <b>compression,</b> whereby the <b>sleeve</b> is freed for rotation for thus indicating the magnitude of the applied tensile forces...|$|R
