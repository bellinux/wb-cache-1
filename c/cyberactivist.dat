The main argument presented here is that the attainment of freedom of the Internet and the success of the revolt created new opportunities for formal political involvement for the <b>cyberactivists</b> as they transited from dissidents under the Ben Ali regime to citizen-participants of a nascent democratic order. A subsidiary argument is that a new generation of Tunisian leadership came to the fore of Tunisia’s private and public spheres to advance the stated aims of the revolution, including inter alia combating unemployment, securing civil liberties, stemming corruption, and the ever deepening of pro-democracy reforms. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{integration}} of the Internet in our society has shaped alot {{of the things we}} do in our lives. The Web allows us to achieve certain things directly through our computers, such as reading the paper and paying our bills. But this integration has also lead to another interesting change. Activists have begun to unload their operations onto the Net instead of holding on to the more traditional demonstrations performed in squares. This study aims to look into the world of cyberactivism and examine how <b>cyberactivists</b> experience the way activism has changed as a result of using the Internet. The study is based on interviews with four <b>cyberactivists</b> operating in various fields. It points to a change in activism, not in its core or message, but in the way activism is engaged. Based on the interviews, three common categories can be found: dissemination of information, communication and new dimension. These categories show that {{with the use of the}} Internet, information dissemination, communication and acting independently of time and space has been made easier. Putting this aside, new challenges have also arisen concerning ownership of the message, uncontrolled communication and a larger distance to the activism itself. However, there is no doubt that the Internet has played a huge role in how activism is conducted today...|$|R

Protesters used Facebook to mobilize supporters and organize events and YouTube videos and Flickr photos gave {{the rest of the world}} visuals of the events of the Spring. Twitter functioned as a live newsfeed for other domestic and international activists as well as international media organizations. Mobile phones, especially those with cameras and Internet access, served as a key tool for <b>cyberactivists.</b> Blogs were another vital method for women to disseminate information. The numbers of female and male bloggers from Arab Spring countries were relatively even.|$|R

O consumo, entendido enquanto manipulação de bens na construção de identidades (BARBOSA, 2009) sugere uma aproximação com o conceito de performance em sites de rede sociais. Frente a isso, pergunta-se: 1) que apropriações do consumo podem ser identificadas nas práticas ciberativistas da WikiLeaks no Facebook? 2) o conceito de performance problematiza esse tipo de consumo? Esta pesquisa se define como exploratória, com coleta de dados via levantamento bibliográfico e de dados na web. Percebeu-se que práticas de consumo online ciberativistas se prestam à construção de identidade e, ainda, que em sites de redes sociais é possível, não só performar (mostrar o que se faz), quanto fazer propriamente dito.  This work analyses online consumption {{practices and}} its association {{to the concept}} of performance on the WikiLeaks page on Facebook. Consumption, understood as manipulation of goods in identity construction (Barbosa, 2009), suggests a close relation with the concept of performance in social network.

This research is exploratory, with data capture through both bibliographic and online research. We {{came to the conclusion that}} practices of <b>cyberactivist</b> online consumption serve to the identity construction and that its possible not only to perform but to truly do something in social network...|$|E
40|$|Computer-mediated {{communication}} has revolutionised the way activist groups {{influence the}} opinion of corporations, governments and the community. It has never been so cheap or convenient to publish high-quality material to push a specific issue or cause. Activists are no longer restricted to satisfy the news values of media corporations to reach wide publics. Nor do these businesses (or governments) have any apparent advantage, despite their more economically sustainable and highly-resourced positions. Current literature is able to examine and explore how the Internet is used and the problems involved, yet much research fails to examine how these constraints and opportunities are negotiated and embraced by users. This thesis provides a window {{to the use of}} computer-mediated-communication within three activist groups, and explores how <b>cyberactivist</b> organisations use the Internet, and how this use influences their capacity to communicate, articulate problems, mobilise resources and maintain relationships within a public relations framework. Activist groups advocate for the implementation of change and have the power to affect an organisations ability to accomplish its goals and missions. As a result, research on activism has become an important aspect of public relations research. Activists represent articulate and vigilant publics who can organise sustained and effective action on diverse issues; yet dominant public relations literature views activists as 2 ̆ 7 the enemy 2 ̆ 7 of the corporate world. The rise of the networked world has shifted the social and political configurations of the twenty-first century, creating new ways of understanding power and change. From all over the world, activism and cyberactivism will increasingly contribute to shaping those changes...|$|E

Aiming to {{contribute to the development of}} this literature, we conduct a qualitative netnographic investigation of the Fat Acceptance Movement, an online-based movement led by consumer-activists who attempt to change societal attitudes about people who are fat. Our main goal is, therefore, to investigate how consumer activists who congregate online, that is, <b>cyberactivists,</b> reframe market offers while attempting to promote market and cultural change. We identify several rhetorical strategies employed by online consumer activists in their quests to change themselves, other consumers, and the broader culture. Our findings advance consumer research on how consumers may mobilize resources to initiate and promote self-, market-, and cultural transformations...|$|R
40|$|This article {{argues that}} the trends in state regulation, {{surveillance}} {{and control of the}} internet in Asia stand to effectively reduce political expression. A variety of international media watch and human rights organisations have noted that since 11 September 2001, a slew of anti-terrorism laws have been adopted in Asia which place greater restric-tions on the internet. Laws against online pornography, gambling, hate speech and spam have been revised to cover online political content and mobilisation. Such measures limit and reduce the space <b>cyberactivists</b> have to push the democratic agenda online.

50|$|The {{opposition}} parties have been weak and divided and {{compared to the}} NDP. The November 2000 People's Assembly elections saw 34 members of the opposition win seats in the 454-seat assembly, facing a clear majority of 388 ultimately affiliated with the ruling National Democratic Party (NDP). The Muslim Brotherhood, founded in Egypt in 1928, was kept an illegal organization and not recognized as a political party (current Egyptian law prohibits the formation of political parties based on religion). Members are known publicly and openly speak their views. Members of the Brotherhood have been elected to the People's Assembly and local councils as independents. The Egyptian political opposition also includes groups and popular movements such as Kefaya and the April 6 Youth Movement, although they are somewhat less organized than officially registered political parties. Bloggers, or <b>cyberactivists</b> as Courtney C. Radsch terms them, have also played an important political opposition role, writing, organizing, and mobilizing public opposition.|$|R
40|$|In {{the last}} few years, the Arab world has been {{shifting}} to new technology, particularly social media, to create new connections and spaces for public engagement. This technology has opened new prospects in freedom of expression, especially in political reforms. Through the recent Arab Spring events, social media platforms have been helping <b>cyberactivists</b> for social changes. The 2011 Egyptian revolution {{is a prime example}} to show how social media platforms were used to ignite strikers and overthrow the autocratic regime. At the same time, the number and size of diasporas in the Middle East are increasing. Yet scholars have not explored how diasporic communities in the region are engaged with recent political changes, namely the Arab Spring. This study reports the results of interviews with Egyptians living in Saudi Arabia during the 2011 Egyptian revolution in order to explore how that diaspora used social media platforms during that time. Grounded theory is used to analyze these interviews. The study concludes that social media was a proper platform for the Egyptian diaspora to collect new political information, connect with people in Egypt, and discuss and share it with people in their homeland and other communities. This Egyptian diaspora used social media to sustain strong ties to people in their homeland, increase their sense of political participation, and to confirm political activity in their homeland...|$|R
40|$|New {{forms of}} {{networked}} action and informal collaboration are challenging traditional notions of civil society. Based on {{the proliferation of}} new technologies, and spurred by the spread of trans-border delocalized communities and the increasing disillusionment with traditional forms of political organization, civic action is becoming increasingly flexible, temporary and elusive. This type of non-traditionally organized collective action often stays below the radar of public discourse, unless it is propelled to the spotlight because of international political developments such as the WikiLeaks case (and the related actions by the cyber-activist network Anonymous) and the mass protests in Northern Africa and the Middle East (and the role of social networking tools in these uprisings). In this article, we investigate the interactions and (in) compatibilities of internet-based networked collective action with institutionalized spaces of policy debate. We begin by characterizing online networked action as an emerging form of organized civil society, focusing on the realm of <b>cyberactivists</b> who are building and using cyber-infrastructure (‘grassroots tech groups’). In particular, we examine their values, identity features and organizational forms. Based on this analysis, we explore two dimensions in which cyberactivism challenges established forms of institutionalized policy debate: the structural dimension and the realm of action repertoires. We ask whether these new forms of civil society are structurally compatible with current multi-stakeholder governance, and we discuss their repertoires of action with regards to policy advocacy and policy interventions, and thus the level and type of their engagement with governance processes and institutions...|$|R
40|$|There is {{an ongoing}} {{struggle}} in the digital public sphere over the signification of “Anonymous. ” Anonymous exists {{at the intersection of}} multiple discursive networks battling for control of the internet including governments, private corporations, non-governmental organizations, individual citizens and multi-lateral institutions. In this dissertation, I propose to document and analyze the battle for signification and re-signification of “Anonymous” between the American network state and hacktivist networks that deploy the moniker Anonymous. Internally, I argue that Anonymous is a meme complex used by counterpublic networks of satire and/or dissent. Anonymous originated in a digital civic space: the image board 4 chan. The tactics of Anonymous reflect the creative culture of 4 chan. On 4 chan, participants share, alter, create and exchange memes. Anonymous networks practice “image politics” and operate on a logic of mass inclusion that treats the cyberspace as a location of direct action as well as organization. Externally, Anonymous highlights the contradictory nature of American responses to hacktivism. While there is universal rejection of Anonymous within the American network state, the State Department rhetorically supports hacktivism in places such as Egypt while the FBI, US Cyber Command, and NSA label domestic hacktivists as terrorists. The outcome of the rhetorical battle over Anonymous has implications for the future of free speech and protest in cyberspace. Domestic penalties for <b>cyberactivists</b> are severe, and the preservation of the rhetorical space for digital protest is under threat...|$|R
40|$|A presente Tese, intitulada âMovimentos de protestos virtuais da Anonymous no Brasil: unidos como um e divididos por fakesâ, apresenta um estudo analÃtico da Rede de Protestos Anonymous, desde seus primÃrdios, no site 4 chan, atÃ os protestos contra a Copa do Mundo no Brasil - 2014, tendo como Ãpice as ManifestaÃÃes de Junho de 2013, nas quais a Anonymous teve influente participaÃÃo, tanto por meio de prÃticas de ativismo online quanto em aÃÃes diretas, offline. O ideÃrio Anonymous Ã caracterizado por uma forma de luta polÃtica que objetiva alcanÃar a emancipaÃÃo humana por meio da hiperdemocracia, tecnocracia, total liberdade de expressÃo, informaÃÃo e comunicaÃÃo. O processo de conquista deste ideÃrio se daria pela prÃtica de novos modelos de mobilizaÃÃes sociais, ou seja, por um processo educativo autÃnomo, autovigilante, anÃnimo, que se desenvolveria num movimento horizontal, sem lideranÃas, sem interferÃncias de partidos polÃticos e sem ideologias. Este modelo se diferencia da forma de luta polÃtica do sÃculo XX, caracterizada pela tradicional dicotomia entre esquerda e direita, movimentos com lideranÃas verticalizadas, personalistas e guiadas por tendÃncias ideolÃgicas explÃcitas. No intuito de compreender o desenvolvimento das aÃÃes de protestos Anonymous no Brasil, utilizou-se como base empÃrica de pesquisa diversas fontes virtuais, tais como pÃginas do Facebook e canais do Youtube das cÃlulas de Anonymous no Brasil e exterior, alÃm de observaÃÃo dos protestos de rua, âOperaÃÃo 7 de setembroâ e a âOperaÃÃo NÃo vai ter Copaâ, e entrevistas com ativistas Anonymous. O processo de anÃlise das fontes foi ponderado pelo estudo dos conteÃdos e das diversas formas de linguagens utilizadas nas aÃÃes ciberativistas. Verificou-se que o desenvolvimento da luta polÃtica com base no ideÃrio Anonymous, na medida em que se propÃs a romper com o modelo tradicional de movimento polÃtico, apesar de agregar significativo nÃmero de ativistas, o ideÃrio Anonymous nÃo foi compreendido pela maioria de seus seguidores e ativistas. A prÃpria forma de criaÃÃo das cÃlulas Anonymous no Brasil teve um inÃcio desvirtuado, tendo sido conduzido de modo verticalizado, em cujo anonimato permitiu que os ativistas seguissem planos estabelecidos por pequenos grupos ou organizaÃÃes desconhecidas, bem como a apropriaÃÃo das cÃlulas Anonymous por fakes, que conduziram determinadas mobilizaÃÃes orientadas por interesses polÃticos, partidÃrios e ideolÃgicos. Tal fato resultou em divisÃes, rupturas e denÃncias por partes de algumas cÃlulas. Por exemplo, a Anonymous FUEL, que continuou ativa, mas com uma postura vigilante em relaÃÃo ao ideÃrio Anonymous, bem como as cÃlulas Anonymous ParanÃ e Anonymous Curitiba, que se declararam inativas, dadas a deturpaÃÃo de ativistas Anonymous que passaram a assumir causas militaristas e golpistas. Para fins deste estudo, a metodologia utilizada teve como referÃncia a anÃlise de discurso de Bakhtin (2002) e Ducrot (1987). Para temas que permeiam o estudo, como o ciberespaÃo, hackerativismo, pÃs-modernidade e movimentos sociais, utilizou-se como base teÃrica as contribuiÃÃes de Castells (2003), LÃvy (1999), Melucci (1989), Tilly (1978), Vegh (2003), Harvey (2008), Santos (2000), (2002), Giddens (1991) e Beck (2000). This thesis, {{entitled}} "Movement {{of virtual}} protests by the Anonymous in Brazil: united as one and divided by fakes," presents an analytical {{evaluation of the}} Anonymous Protests Network, since its inception, in the site 4 chan, to show dissent against the World Cup Brazil - 2014, having reached its peak in the June 2013 Demonstrations, in which Anonymous had influential participation, either through online activism practices as in direct actions offline. The ideology supporting Anonymous {{is characterized by a}} form of political struggle which aims at achieving human emancipation through hiper-democracy, technocracy and complete freedom of expression, information and communication. The process of a successful establishment of these ideas would take place through the practice of new models of social mobilization, that is, by an autonomous educational process - self-vigilant, anonymous - which would develop a horizontal movement without leaders, without interference from political parties and without ideologies. This model differs from the political form of struggle of the twentieth century, characterized by the traditional split between left and right movements with leaders in a personality vertical hierarchal power line, guided by explicit ideological tendencies. In order to understand the development of the Anonymous protest actions in Brazil, it was used as a empirical research base several virtual sources such as Facebook pages and YouTube channels of Anonymous cells in Brazil and abroad, as well as observation of street protests, such as "Operation September 7 " and "Operation No World Cup", besides interviews with Anonymous activists. The process of analysis of the sources was weighted by the study of the contents and the various forms of languages used in the actions of <b>cyberactivists.</b> It was found that the development of political struggles based on ideas spawned by Anonymous, as far as it proposes to break the traditional model of political action, in spite of counting with significant number of activists, the Anonymous ideology was not understood by most of his followers and activists. The very form of creating Anonymous cells in Brazil had a distorted start and was conducted in vertical fashion, anonymity allowing activists to follow plans established by small groups or unknown organizations, as well as appropriation of Anonymous cells by fakes, which led to certain mobilizations guided by political interests of a partisan and ideological nature. This fact resulted in divisions, ruptures and complaints by parts of some cells. As an example of this situation one can cite Anonymous FUEL, which remained active, but with a vigilant stance on Anonymous ideology, and two other branches, Anonymous ParanÃ and Anonymous Curitiba, which declared themselves inactive, given misrepresentation of Anonymous ideas by other cells that assumed militarist causes and defended a coup dâÃtat in Brazil. For this study, the methodology used had as reference discourse analysis of Bakhetin (2002) and Ducrot (1987). For themes that permeate the study, such as cyberspace, hacktivism, postmodernism and social movements, it was used as a theoretical basis the contributions of Castells (1999), Levy (1999), Melucci (1989), Tilly (1978), Vegh (2003), Harvey (2008), Santos (2000), (2002), Giddens (1991) and Beck (2000) ...|$|R
