25|$|The {{location}} {{that was later}} to become Williamston started as the <b>cross-road</b> of the Grand River and Saginaw Indian Trails. It was first occupied by {{a small band of}} the Saginaw tribe of the Chippewa People which by the mid-19th century used the area as a 'summer village' (it was not used by them year-round, but they 'wintered' in the area that is now Meridian Township). They used Williamston for planting crops, burying their dead, and holding an annual spring gathering, primarily using the land just north of the Red Cedar River.|$|E

This was to prove a historic encounter and a <b>cross-road</b> in Piazzolla's career.|$|E
