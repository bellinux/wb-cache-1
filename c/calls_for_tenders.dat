40|$|Green Public Procurement (GPP) {{can be seen}} as a {{promising}} method to promote environmentally sound product design and motivate manufacturers to make products with reduced environmental impacts. For furniture, environmental impacts are quite limited during use but more associated with production and disposal. The requirements and criteria for furniture purchasing should be targeted to those environmental aspects that have the most influence and could, through eco-design, lead to the greatest environmental benefits. In order to do this, an RPS selection tool (Relevance-Potential-Steerability) is used. It is a tool developed for the assessment of the feasibility of eco-labelling criteria for a certain product group, and is applied in this study. The purpose of this paper is to recognize the major environmental aspects of furniture and to analyze to which extent they are taken into consideration in public purchasing, i. e., in the <b>calls</b> <b>for</b> <b>tenders.</b> The paper begins with describing the concepts of GPP and eco-design, as well as essential elements in this context such as the 'most economically advantageous' tender, the environmental aspects of furniture, eco-labels and eco-design strategies. The article continues with an analysis of 31 <b>calls</b> <b>for</b> <b>tenders</b> of furniture, including 15 Finnish and 16 Swedish <b>calls</b> <b>for</b> <b>tenders.</b> Finally, the paper discusses about the potential of GPP in promoting eco-design of furniture, i. e., what criteria are relevant from the view point of eco-design. The criteria that were presented in the studied <b>calls</b> <b>for</b> <b>tenders</b> seemed to be relevant from this perspective and subsequently may encourage eco-design among furniture manufacturers.

40|$|Green Public Procurement (GPP) {{has been}} {{considered}} as an important policy instrument {{in the context of}} sustainable consumption and production. The state and progress of GPP has earlier been measured by questionnaires and interviews, both methods being based on the assessment by the purchaser, and questionnaires having low response rates. Recently, a new method was developed, analyzing the existence of environmental criteria in the <b>calls</b> <b>for</b> <b>tenders.</b> However, the studies have dealt neither with the progress in GPP, nor the statistical evidence of differences between countries. Our aim was to analyze more thoroughly whether the differences in the proportions of 'green' <b>calls</b> <b>for</b> <b>tenders</b> between the three Nordic countries, Denmark, Finland and Sweden, in 2003 and 2005 were real, and whether there had occurred any progress between the years concerned. The paper also presents the 'GPP-record' method, which enables more valid measurement of the environmental soundness of public purchasing. The statistical analyses were done using logit models with country, year and product group as the explanatory factors. It proved to be relevant {{to take into account the}} variation that occurred from the random existence of product groups in the samples of calls for tender. There were less environmental criteria in the <b>calls</b> <b>for</b> <b>tenders</b> in Finland than in Denmark and Sweden in 2003, but in 2005 no significant difference between Finland and Denmark was observed. Both Finland and Sweden saw progress in this area between 2003 and 2005. Green Public Procurement (GPP) Progress <b>Calls</b> <b>for</b> <b>tenders</b> Environment Statistical Logit models...|$|E

This paper describes a tool and techniques to help users discovering relevant business opportunities, in particular, <b>calls</b> <b>for</b> <b>tenders.</b> The tool includes spidering, information extraction, classification, and a search interface. Our focus in this paper is on classification, which aims to organize <b>calls</b> <b>for</b> <b>tenders</b> into classes, so as to facilitate user’s browsing. We describe a new approach to classification of business opportunities on the Web using language modeling (LM) approach.

Our goal is to investigate whether LM can bring improvement to text classification.

The experimental results show that LM-based classification can significantly improve the classification performance on both test corpora, compared with the traditional Naïve Bayes (NB) classifier. In particular, it seems to have stronger impact on FBO than on Reuters. This result shows that LM can greatly improve classification on the Web. 1...|$|E
