5|$|Effects artist Scott Stoddard {{described}} his look for Jason's face {{as a combination}} of Carl Fullerton's design for Friday the 13th Part 2 and Tom Savini's design for Friday the 13th: The Final Chapter. Stoddard's vision of Jason included hair loss, skin rashes, and the traditional deformities in his face. Stoddard tried to craft Jason's look so it would allow more human side of the character to be seen. Mears was required to wear full body make-up from the chest upwards while performing as Jason. The actor wore a <b>chest</b> <b>plate</b> with fake skin that would adjust to his muscle movements. He wore a hump on his back {{to give the impression}} that Jason had scoliosis. A prosthetic eye was glued to Mears' face to show realistic eye movements. Stoddard initially spent three-and-a-half hours applying the make-up to Mears' head and torso. He was eventually able to reduce the required time to just over an hour for scenes in which Mears wore the hockey mask. For scenes in which Jason's face is revealed, it took approximately four hours to apply the make-up.|$|E
25|$|The {{lines of}} foliage treatment, so {{common in the}} bands of the 15th-century roodscreens and the panel work {{especially}} of Germany, serve to illustrate the widely different motives of the craftsmen of these two great epochs. Again, while the Renaissance designer as a rule made {{the two sides of}} the panel alike, the Gothic carver seldom repeated a single detail. While his main lines and grouping corresponded, his detail differed. Of numberless examples a 15th-century <b>chest</b> (<b>Plate</b> III. fig. 6) in the Kunstgewerbemuseum Berlin may be referred to. The arrangements of foliage, etc., on top, back and front, are typical of Gothic at its best.|$|E
500|$|Early on the 16thday, the [...] "soul" [...] of Aravan is {{transferred}} {{back to his}} repainted head and the cuvami tirukkan tirattal ("opening of the god's holy eyes") ceremony is performed with painting of the pupils. The head is then paraded around the village on a portable platform called a ketayam. The ketayam is accompanied by two other platform-chariots, one holding the <b>chest</b> <b>plate</b> and epaulettes of Aravan—without which the festival is considered incomplete; the other carries his flower-crown. The ceremony ends with a sacrificial offering of roosters. Aravan's head is fixed on the post, with his large epaulettes and <b>chest</b> <b>plate</b> fixed to his body, which is made of straw and surrounded by a garland. The image is then paraded across the village in preparation for his kalappali and ritual re-enactment of his death on the eighth day of the war. At noon his chariot turns north, a symbolic gesture representing his kalappali and then he is {{turned to face the}} ceremonial Kurukshetra battlefield, symbolizing his entry onto the battlefield to die at the hands of Alambusha. On arrival in Kurukshetra, the garlands are removed, indicating the removal of his flesh and his defeat on the eighth day of war.|$|E

500|$|In any case, the pre-battle {{sacrifice}} {{is the common}} element in the Tamil traditions. After Aravan requested and was granted his boons, {{he was ready for}} the sacrifice. He proceeds to the Kurukshetra battlefield. While Yudhishthira is worshipping Kali in his [...] "hall of weapons", Aravan removes his epaulettes and <b>chest</b> <b>plate.</b> He then cuts his body into 32pieces—one cut for each of his 32 bodily perfections—which are offered by Yudhishthira to Kali. In a terukuttu performance, this is depicted by covering the actor playing Aravan with a white cloth from the neck down. It is also believed that Aravan's spirit may possess the actor at this point. Sometimes a chicken is sacrificed on stage in a terukuttu performance to signify the sacrifice. In Villiputuralvar's retelling, an elephant is sacrificed to the goddess, complementing Aravan's own self-sacrifice.|$|E
500|$|The manipular army got {{its name}} from the manner in which its heavy {{infantry}} was deployed. Maniples were units of 120 men each drawn from a single infantry class. The maniples were small enough to permit tactical movement of individual infantry units on the battlefield {{within the framework of the}} greater army. The maniples were typically deployed into three discrete lines (Latin: triplex acies) based on the three heavy infantry types of hastati, principes and triarii. The first type, the hastati, typically formed the first rank in battle formation. [...] They typically wore a brass <b>chest</b> <b>plate</b> (though some could afford mail), a helmet called a galea, and occasionally, greaves (shin guards). They carried an iron bossed wooden shield, 120cm (4ft) tall and rectangular in shape with a curved front to partially protect the sides. Traditionally they were armed with a sword known as a gladius and two throwing spears known as pila: one the heavy pilum of popular imagination and one a slender javelin. However the exact introduction of the Gladius and the replacement of the spear with the sword as the primary weapon of the Roman Legions is uncertain, and it's possible that the early manipular legions still fought with the Hastati and Principes wielding the Hasta or Spear.|$|E
50|$|The <b>chest</b> <b>plate</b> is {{not only}} a {{defensive}} component of the Arkham Knight's suit, but also a psychological one. As the Arkham Knight, through unknown means, knows how much the past Arkham incidents have affected Batman, he has purposefully emblazoned the Arkham symbol on his <b>chest</b> <b>plate,</b> putting the Caped Crusader at a psychological disadvantage. The angular design of the <b>chest</b> <b>plate</b> was designed not only for the A-shape of the Arkham logo, but also as a means of deflecting the Batclaw.|$|E
25|$|With the Mochica culture, goldwork flourished. The {{pieces are}} no longer simple metalwork, but are now masterful {{examples}} of jewellery making. Pieces are sophisticated in their design, and feature inlays of turquoise, mother of pearl, spondylus shell, and amethyst. The nose and ear ornaments, <b>chest</b> <b>plates,</b> small containers and whistles are considered masterpieces of ancient Peruvian culture.|$|R
50|$|The first formal {{investigation}} of a claimed burial site located at El Caño was conducted {{by a group of}} American archaeologist who were researching the written accounts from early Spanish Conquistadors. According to many of the Spanish accounts, while travelling through this region they made contact with {{a group of people who}} lived in a society ruled by a small number of elites and created magnificent forms of gold work. In later Spanish accounts of the battles against these indigenous people, it was noted by Spanish soldiers that the higher elites of these societies differentiated themselves from lower ranks by wearing golden <b>chest</b> <b>plates</b> and other forms of jewelry as they fought in battle. Spanish explorers claimed that there were countless number of stories from the indigenous population telling of ceremonial burial sites that laid along the river, many of which held the bodies of priest and other high elites who were adorned with golden <b>chest</b> <b>plates</b> and other golden artifacts. According to one story written throughout the time of Spanish occupation, it was reported that a group of Spaniards discovered one of these graves and looted 335 pounds of gold objects.|$|R

40|$|Mineralization and {{ossification}} in {{the human}} costal cartilages were studied radiologically. The aim of our study was to evaluate differences {{between males and females}} with respect to patterns of costal cartilage calcification and also with respect to ageing. Material for this study consists of 1044 chest and abdominal radiograms of the Czech population from the Depart-ment of Radiology (537 males and 507 females). Further radiograms of 18 <b>chest</b> <b>plates</b> were obtained at routine necropsy of cadavers. The radiograms were examined for pattern of ossification of the costal cartilage. The first rib cartilages were not considered because there are no sex differences. The lower ribs exhibit sexual dimorphism.

The sexual difference in pattern of human costal cartilages is statistically significant and thus highly predictive of sex determination...|$|R

50|$|Harnesses are {{not only}} good dog {{handling}} tools, as they are also used for training. There {{are a variety of}} dog training harnesses, usually made of nylon or leather. Both of these materials are perfect for this purpose. Commonly, nylon harnesses are cheaper than leather ones. There are specially designed harnesses with fully padded <b>chest</b> <b>plate</b> for agitation, protection, and attack training.

Although many fans believed {{this to be the}} reason for his persisting cough heard in Revenge of the Sith, Grievous was actually intended to have had the cough all along (evidenced by him having the cough from the beginning in the subsequent CGI series Star Wars: The Clone Wars). The confusion arose due to the writers of Star Wars: Clone Wars having to produce the series before all of Grievous's final characterizations had been nailed down.|$|R
50|$|For {{the most}} part, the Gaelic Irish fought without armour, instead wearing saffron {{coloured}} belted tunics called léine (pronounced 'laynuh'), the plural being léinte (pronounced 'layntuh/laynchuh'. Armour was usually a simple affair: the poorest might have worn padded coats; the wealthier might have worn boiled leather armour called cuir bouilli; and the wealthiest {{might have had}} access to bronze <b>chest</b> <b>plates</b> and perhaps mail (though it did exist in Ireland, it was rare). Gallowglass mercenaries have been depicted as having worn mail tunics and in latter period, steel burgonet helmets, {{but the majority of}} Gaelic warriors would have been protected only by a small shield. Shields were usually round, with a spindle shaped boss, though later the regular iron boss models were introduced by the Anglo-Saxons and Vikings. A few shields were also oval in shape or square, but most of them were small and round, like bucklers, to better enable agility.|$|R

Because the muscle is poorly described in the surgical literature, the aim of the present study is to examine in details its variations. Methods: The data was obtained at standard autopsies of 120 Caucasian subjects (Bulgarians) of both sexes (97 males and 23 females), ranging in age from 18 to 91 years (mean age 52. 8 ± 17. 8 years).
