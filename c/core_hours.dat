In {{addition to the}} full 14 -round version, MANTIS 7, the designers also propose an aggressive 10 -round version, MANTIS 5. The security claim for MANTIS 5 is resistance against “practical attacks”, defined as related-tweak attacks with data complexity 2 d less than 230 chosen plaintexts (or 240 known plaintexts), and computational complexity at most 2126 −d. We present a key-recovery attack against MANTIS 5 with 228 chosen plaintexts and a computational complexity of about 238 block cipher calls, which violates this claim. Our attack {{is based on a}} family of differential characteristics and exploits several properties of the lightweight round function and tweakey schedule.

40|$|We {{investigate}} the sign problem for full configuration interaction quantum Monte Carlo (FCIQMC), a stochastic algorithm for finding the ground state {{solution of the}} Schrödinger equation with substantially reduced computational cost compared with exact diagonalisation. We find k-space Hubbard models for which the solution is yielded with storage that grows sub-linearly {{in the size of}} the many-body Hilbert space, in spite of using a wave function that is simply linear combination of states. The FCIQMC algorithm is able to find this sub-linear scaling regime without bias and with only a choice of Hamiltonian basis. By means of a demonstration we solve for the energy of a 70 -site half-filled system (with a space of 10 ^ 38 determinants) in 250 <b>core</b> <b>hours,</b> substantially quicker than the ∼ 10 ^ 36 <b>core</b> <b>hours</b> that would be required by exact diagonalisation. This is the largest space that has been sampled in an unbiased fashion. The challenge for the recently-developed FCIQMC method is made clear: expand the sub-linear scaling regime whilst retaining exact on average accuracy. This result rationalizes the success of the initiator adaptation (i-FCIQMC) and offers clues to improve it. We argue that our results changes the landscape for development of FCIQMC and related methods. Comment: 6 pages, 4 figures. The mentioned supplementary material is included as "Ancillary files".

40|$|We {{introduce}} a powerful iterative algorithm to compute protein folding pathways, with realistic all-atom force fields. Using the path integral formalism, we explicitly derive a modified Langevin equation which samples directly the ensemble of reactive pathways, exponentially reducing {{the cost of}} simulating thermally activated transitions. The algorithm also yields a rigorous stochastic estimate of the reaction coordinate. After illustrating this approach on a simple toy model, we successfully validate it against the results of ultra-long plain MD protein folding simulations for a fast folding protein (Fip 35), which were performed on the Anton supercomputer. Using our algorithm, computing a folding trajectory for this protein requires only 1000 <b>core</b> <b>hours,</b> a computational load which could be even carried out on a desktop workstation.

The {{data were collected from}} 619 neurologically normal individuals, ages 18 - 87. The processed results from the resting recordings are completed and available online.

40|$|Obtaining {{accurate}} {{estimates of}} satellite drag coefficients in low Earth orbit {{is a crucial}} component in positioning and collision avoidance. Simulators can produce accurate estimates, but their computational expense is much too large for real-time application. A pilot study showed that Gaussian process (GP) surrogate models could accurately emulate simulations. However, cubic runtimes for training GPs meant that they could only be applied to a narrow range of input configurations, and still achieve the desired level of accuracy. In this paper we show how extensions to the local approximate Gaussian Process (laGP) method allow accurate full-scale emulation. The new methodological contributions, which involve a multi-level global/local modeling approach, and a set-wise approach to local subset selection, are shown to perform well in benchmark and synthetic data settings. We conclude by demonstrating that our method achieves the desired level of accuracy, besting simpler viable (i. e., computationally tractable) global and local modeling approaches, when trained on seventy thousand <b>core</b> <b>hours</b> of drag simulations for two real-satellites: the Hubble space telescope (HST) and the gravity recovery and climate experiment (GRACE).
