5|$|Julius Schaub {{was born}} on 20 August 1898 in Munich, a largely Catholic city in {{southern}} Bavaria. On 28 June 1914, Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria {{and his wife were}} assassinated by a group of Serbian and Bosnian rebels. This triggered the outbreak of World War I in Europe. On 17 January 1917, Schaub was drafted to serve as a field medic in the German Army. According to Traudl Junge, one of Hitler's private secretaries, both of Schaub's feet had been injured in the war, making him semi-handicapped. By the end of the war, Schaub found work as a <b>contract</b> <b>worker</b> at the Munich Central Supply Office.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Mr. Glowery, {{a bitter}} New York City {{journalist}} and writer {{who believes that}} a rival author is sabotaging his literary career, arrives in Tyburn where he is to speak at a fiction workshop being held at the Admiral Benbow Inn. He is immediately tasered by one of Castro's detectives, who mistakenly confuses him for Picasso. Back at the Admiral Benbow Inn, the innkeeper, George Hawthorne, worries about Mr. Briscoe, a cross-dressing <b>contract</b> <b>worker</b> who is stranded in the abandoned lighthouse just off the coast because of the raging nor'easter, while his unhappy wife, Magdalene Hawthorne, threatens to leave him. The next morning, Mr. Glowery is stuck in a restaurant where he is being coerced by a psychotic cook to peddle his novel {{in order to pay}} off a debt he incurred during the night. When Professor Eggman, the director of the fiction workshop, comes across Mr. Glowery, he rescues him and brings him back to the inn. However, few people show up for the fiction workshop because of the storm. Hawthorne's wife returns from a spa with Picasso; Mr. Hawthorne informs her that he is trying to procure a prostitute for his new arrival, Jesus Castro, who has registered under the false name of Mr. Wassermann. Mr. Hawthorne asks Picasso if he has had sex with his wife and Picasso meekly admits to it.|$|E

40|$|Contractual {{employment}} {{is an increasing}} phenomenon in the in-house production while informal workers are available outside at low cost. The obvious question is: are they more productive? To enquire this, the present paper examines the elasticity and productivity differential between direct and <b>contract</b> <b>workers</b> using the three-digit industrial data for major Indian states during 1998 – 2006. A simple theoretical exercise suggests that when direct and <b>contract</b> <b>workers</b> are employed respectively for core and peripheral activities within in-house production, the use of <b>contract</b> <b>workers</b> could rise in response to technological change even if direct workers are more productive and decline. We assume that a firm can undertake core activities by subcontracting out in place of using direct employment. Our empirical results suggest that both elasticity and productivity of <b>contract</b> <b>workers</b> have been {{lower than those of}} direct workers, even when the share of <b>contract</b> <b>workers</b> is highly explained by the capital–output ratio. We argue that the contractworkers are less productive because they do not receive direct benefits from the technological upgradation in core in-house activities. While the technological upgradation can replace direct workers and subcontracting, the <b>contract</b> <b>workers</b> to be used for peripheral in-house activities can increase along with in-house production...|$|R
25|$|Robin {{soon became}} a {{shearing}} contractor and his gangs were highly sought after by stations throughout Hawke's Bay, Wairarapa and Wellington. He eventually became the biggest contractor in Hawke's Bay and, {{at the peak of}} his success, Robin employed over 100 workers for both shearing and general farm work. He was able to offer work and accommodation to young homeless Maori, and worked with social welfare agencies in Napier and Hastings. The freezing works at Whakatu and Tomoana caused Robin's shearing contracts to decline as many of his men left his gang and chose to find work independently rather than as a <b>contract</b> <b>worker.</b>|$|E
2500|$|In March 2015, James King, {{a former}} <b>contract</b> <b>worker</b> at the Mail's New York office, {{wrote an article}} for Gawker titled 'My Year Ripping Off the Web With the Daily Mail Online. In the article, King alleged that the Mails {{approach}} was to rewrite stories from other news outlets with minimal credit {{in order to gain}} advertising clicks, and that staffers had published material they knew to be false. He also suggested that the paper preferred to delete stories from its website rather than publish corrections or admit mistakes. In September 2015, the Mail's US company Mail Media filed a lawsuit against King and Gawker Media for libel. Eric Wemple at the Washington Post questioned the value of the lawsuit, noting that [...] "Whatever the merits of King's story, it didn't exactly upend conventional wisdom" [...] about the website's strategy.|$|E
2500|$|On 21 July 2012, citing safety concerns, {{the company}} {{announced}} a lockout under The Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 pending results of an inquiry the company has requested of the Haryana government into {{the causes of the}} disorder.

On 26 July 2012, Maruti announced employees would not be paid for the period of lock-out in accordance with Indian labour laws. The company further announced that it will stop using contract workers by March 2013. The report claimed the salary difference between contract workers and permanent workers has been much smaller than initial media reports – the <b>contract</b> <b>worker</b> at Maruti received about [...] 11,500 per month, while a permanent worker received about [...] 12,500 a month at start, which increased in three years to [...] 21,000-22,000 per month.

40|$|Studies on {{the rate}} of {{occupational}} accidents among migrant <b>contract</b> <b>workers</b> is sparse, although they are increasingly used in the furniture manufacturing industry in Malaysia. Therefore, {{the rate of}} occupational accidents among migrant <b>contract</b> <b>workers</b> in the Malaysian wooden furniture industry were studied in sixty furniture manufacturing factories, using a structured questionnaire. The two-part questionnaire were aimed at collecting data on comparative accidents rates among the foreign workers and local workers, while identifying the main factors that lead to occupational accidents. The findings of the study show conclusively that the migrant <b>contract</b> <b>workers</b> are less prone to occupational accidents compared to their local counterparts and hence, are more productive. Further, the results also revealed that the migrant <b>contract</b> <b>workers</b> have a more positive attitude towards the work and hence, pick up the essentials of safe working quickly. It must therefore be recognized that the production oriented mentality prevalent in the industry which has been argued to compromise {{occupational safety and health}} standards in the industry may be debatable. In this context, it is essential for the policy makers to re-examine the employment of migrant <b>contract</b> <b>workers</b> for the furniture manufacturing industry, as changing the psycho-economic parameters of the industry may be warranted before the industry is deemed attractive to the local workforce...|$|R
