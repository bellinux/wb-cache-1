5|$|After Cassandra Cain {{abandoned}} the role a mystery character appeared {{as the new}} Batgirl in the Birds of Prey comic. Possessing superpowers, the teen claimed the empty mantle {{in an attempt to}} honor the character. However, Barbara Gordon quickly dissuaded the teen from continuing in the role. Charlie Gage-Radcliffe acquiesced, but modified her <b>costume</b> <b>and</b> changed her name to Misfit.|$|E
5|$|But I'm a Cheerleader was Babbit's {{first feature}} film. It was {{inspired}} by an article about conversion therapy and her childhood familiarity with rehabilitation programs. She used {{the story of a}} young woman finding her sexual identity to explore the social construction of gender roles and heteronormativity. The <b>costume</b> <b>and</b> set design of the film highlighted these themes using artificial textures in intense blues and pinks.|$|E

5|$|Stephanie Brown, {{formerly}} the Spoiler and briefly the fourth Robin, {{takes up the}} mantle of Batgirl after Cassandra Cain gives Brown her costume under Batman's order.

5|$|The {{visual effects}} supervisor, John Sullivan, hired Arc Productions to create just under 500 shots with {{computer}} generated imagery, between a quarter {{and a third}} of what a blockbuster film would feature. The Covenant that appear are all completely computer generated, as is the academy's space elevator, weapons' muzzle flashes and a few shots of Master Chief. Hendler felt that the visual effects were the area that needed particular focus and spent a much larger percentage of the budget on the Master Chief <b>costume</b> <b>and</b> computer generated imagery than is normal for a production.|$|E
5|$|Watts {{was born}} 28 September 1968, in Shoreham, Kent, England. She is the {{daughter}} of Myfanwy ("Miv") Edwards (née Roberts), an antiques dealer and <b>costume</b> <b>and</b> set designer, and Peter Watts (1946–1976), a road manager and sound engineer who worked with Pink Floyd.

5|$|Clark Gregg reprises {{his role}} as Coulson from the film series, and is joined by {{principal}} cast members Ming-Na Wen, Brett Dalton, Chloe Bennet, Iain De Caestecker, Elizabeth Henstridge, and Nick Blood. Guest star Maya Stojan reprises her role as Agent 33, before being replaced by Wen when the character takes on {{the appearance of the}} latter's character Melinda May. This leads to the climactic fight between both of Wen's characters, realized through choreographed stunt work and CGI; the crew worked harder to meet the standards of Tancharoen following his acclaimed action work on , including the stunt team, who had worked on that series, and the <b>costume</b> <b>and</b> set designers, who looked to accommodate the fight.|$|E

The museum opened in 2000 in an old house with an 18th-century frontage. It was restored with the help of grants from the Heritage Lottery Fund, Somerset County Council, South Somerset District Council and Crewkerne Town Council.

5|$|Earlier, at the Sibiu Conference of 26 April/8 May 1848, Transylvanian revolutionaries {{had also}} adopted a blue-white-red {{national}} flag (vertical, {{according to the}} memoirs of George Bariţ). It was emblazoned with the words “VIRTUTEA ROMANĂ REÎNVIATĂ” (“ROMAN VIRTUE RESURRECTED”). A number of contemporary sources attests these colors (including the Blaj newspaper Organul naţionale and Alexandru Papiu Ilarian’s Istorie a românilor din Dacia superioară). They had a twofold significance: their importance in Romanian <b>costume</b> <b>and</b> their union of the Transylvanian principality’s old colors (blue and red) with the white symbolizing peace. It appears that the two specimens with blue-yellow-red stripes preserved today at the National Museum of Romanian History were made later to commemorate the events at Blaj; yellow replaced white {{as a symbol of}} Romanian Transylvanians’ desire to join Romania.|$|E
5|$|Fans may wear a full {{or partial}} fursuit or other costume {{to express their}} {{identity}} and entertain others, though typically less than 15% of attendees bring a <b>costume,</b> <b>and</b> few of these wear them all the time. Others may wear accessories such as ears or a tail, particularly outside the main convention area. Nearly all will wear one or more custom convention badges featuring a depiction of their anthropomorphic persona, some with attached ribbons providing an indicator of social status, such as a notice of affiliation, or sponsorship of the convention. Sales of such accessories form {{a part of the}} commerce at furry conventions.|$|E

5|$|Freema Agyeman, {{who played}} Martha Jones in Doctor Who and Torchwood, {{introduced}} the episode, which was shown {{on a large}} screen above the stage and smaller screens {{around the edge of}} the Dress Circle in the Royal Albert Hall. As the Doctor addressed them, the Royal Albert Hall audience shouted back responses. Manuscript paper fell to the stage as the Doctor was seen to feed his sheet music to the orchestra. When the Graske sneaked through the portal, he appeared in the audience carrying the Doctor's water pistol and squirting members of the audience. A cellist had to defend himself from an attack by the Graske who promptly exited as, on screen, the Doctor pulled him back to the TARDIS. The Graske in the audience was Jimmy Vee in <b>costume</b> <b>and</b> prosthetics.|$|E
5|$|Gaara's initial attire, {{along with}} the costumes of his siblings, was {{difficult}} for Kishimoto to draw on a weekly basis. Because of this, Kishimoto gave {{the three of them}} simpler costumes towards the end of Part I; Gaara received an outfit with an upright collar. In addition to being easier to draw, it was used to demonstrate the change in relationship between Gaara and Naruto following their previous fight. Kishimoto cites The Matrix, one of his favorite movies, as an inspiration for Gaara's new <b>costume,</b> <b>and</b> he considers it to be his favorite costume of the three siblings. For Part II, there was a scene where an antagonist Deidara was sitting on Gaara's body. This shot was inspired by Akira, a manga by Katsuhiro Otomo that Kishimoto was a fan of.|$|E
5|$|Halo: Combat Evolved Anniversary was {{announced}} to the public with a trailer on June 6, 2011, at Microsoft's annual E3 global media briefing, which closed with the teaser trailer for Halo 4.

During the Halo Universe panel at the 2011 San Diego Comic-Con, a short trailer showcasing the animation used in the terminals with a narration by 343 Guilty Spark was shown to the fans.

5|$|Hergé's {{principal}} {{source of}} information about the Andes was Charles Wiener's 1880 book Pérou et Bolivie ("Peru and Bolivia"), which contained 1,100 engravings from which Hergé could base his own illustrations. In this way, small details about Andean <b>costume</b> <b>and</b> material culture were accurately copied. Part of the ceremonial costume worn by the Incan priest was based upon a colour painting of Mexican Aztecs produced by Else Bostelmann for the National Geographic Society which Hergé had a copy of in his files. He ensured that his depiction of the Peruvian trains was accurate by basing them upon examples found in a two-volume picture encyclopedia of railways published by Librarie Hachette in 1927.|$|E
5|$|Maloney cast John Franklyn-Robbins as the Time Lord {{because he}} had worked with him before and {{intended}} his character to resemble Death in The Seventh Seal. Hilary Minster, who played a Thal soldier, had also played a Thal in Planet of the Daleks (1973). Minster had been considered {{for the role of}} Mogran. Peter Miles previously played Dr. Lawrence in Doctor Who and the Silurians (1970) and Professor Whitaker in Invasion of the Dinosaurs (1974). Stephen Yardley, who played the Muto Sevrin, later appeared in Vengeance on Varos (1985). During filming of Genesis, Yardley walked into the casting department on his lunch break in <b>costume</b> <b>and</b> asked for a job; because of his costume, they assumed he was a tramp from the street. Dennis Chinnery, who played Gharman, had previously been seen in The Chase (1965) and would later appear in The Twin Dilemma (1984).|$|E

Instead of his normal costumed identity, he adopted four other <b>costumes</b> <b>and</b> created a {{different}} crime-fighting persona for each suit. After this crisis had ended, he discarded the four <b>costumes,</b> <b>and</b> they subsequently disappeared, reappearing in the possession of the Golden Age superhero called the Black Marvel. The Marvel gave the costumes to four youths, and trained them to become heroes.|$|R
