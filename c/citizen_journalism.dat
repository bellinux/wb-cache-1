He argues that <b>citizen</b> <b>journalism</b> draws from voluntary contributions from its participants who utilize technology and the Internet to coordinate the process of <b>citizen</b> <b>journalism.</b> <b>Citizen</b> <b>journalism</b> may take place in websites such as Indymedia, Slashdot, OhmyNews, and The Huffington Post. Bruns also expands on the importance of social networking sites, such as Twitter, serving as platforms for <b>citizen</b> <b>journalism</b> to take place. Commentary on websites like The Huffington Post and Twitter respond to already existing and published news stories. However, Bruns states that it collects and combines these already existing materials and contextualizes them by pointing out new ways for their interpretation and analysis. As a result, he claims that comments compile information by highlighting its implications and are a form of news curation. In addition, Bruns utilizes Twitter's hashtag system as an example of providing an open and accessible space for individuals to participate in <b>citizen</b> <b>journalism</b> and produsage. When users tag their posts with hashtags, they are enabling for a larger conversation to take place with other Twitter users and further extend the potential number of participants engaging in <b>citizen</b> <b>journalism.</b> The process of news curation is decentralized and shared; Twitter users collaborate on compiling, collaborating and curating information. As a result, Twitter is an online space that allows its users to share, report, and discuss news stories in a collaborative and open group.|$|E

40|$|News {{organizations}} in many Western democracies face decreasing trust amid fake news accusations. In this situation, news organizations risk losing their license to operate {{and need to}} defend their legitimacy. This study analyzes how The New York Times (NYT) discredits fake news accusations, which are prominently expressed by US President Trump. A critical discourse analysis of the NYT’s news articles about fake news accusations in the first 70 days following President Trump’s inauguration reveals four delegitimizing strategies. First, the accusations are taken as a “badge of honor” for professional journalism but are morally evaluated to damage journalism’s role as the fourth estate in democracy. Second, using sarcasm, the articles criticize President Trump’s capacity to govern and thus question his legitimacy. Third, reporting implies that fake news accusations aim at suppressing critical thinking as in authoritarian regimes. Fourth, accusations are described as irrational responses to professional reporting or proven to be factually wrong, when possible. Overall, reporting in the NYT portrays President Trump as an irresponsible leader risking {{the well-being of the}} country’s <b>citizens,</b> its <b>journalism,</b> and its democracy, as well as journalism in foreign countries...|$|R
40|$|Despite India’s {{remarkable}} communication media revolution {{the rural}} subalterns remained uninformed, unheard and voiceless, who asks the question: Whose Media, Whose Voice? This created {{a space for}} community radio (CR) because it is of, for, and by the community. However, {{in spite of the}} alternative, counter-hegemonic, and participatory communication ethos, the contribution of CR’s and CRR’s lingered unexplored and unacknowledged. To bridge this gap, within the theoretical framework of alternative-media-theory this study has been undertaken. Based on case studies of India’s pioneer CR’s (Sangam Radio and Radio Bundelkhand) using media ethnography tools a qualitative inquiry was carried out. Findings suggest that CR’s can be seen as means of developing capabilities among the subalterns through equitable inclusion not merely as participants but as active producers, partners and managers. The dialectical, dynamic, non-hierarchical and <b>citizen</b> controlled <b>journalism</b> of CRR’s reflects antagonisms of reality and high level of community belongingness and responsibility that created fundamental distinctiveness-challenges to mainstream media. Finally, providing platform for expression enlarges the voices of the subalterns which will ultimately facilitate community dialogs and deliberations around local issues and helps to redefine their community identity in their own way and might lead to positive social change...|$|R
