CCR converts activated cinnamic acids (hydroxycinnamoyl–SCoAs) to cinnamaldehydes; <b>cinnamaldehydes</b> are then reduced to cinnamyl alcohols by CAD. The transformations caused the incorporation of nontraditional components into the extractable tobacco lignins, as evidenced by NMR. Isolated lignin of antisense-CAD tobacco contained fewer coniferyl and sinapyl alcohol-derived units that were compensated for by elevated levels of benzaldehydes and <b>cinnamaldehydes.</b> Products from radical coupling of <b>cinnamaldehydes,</b> particularly sinapaldehyde, which were barely discernible in normal tobacco, were major components of the antisense-CAD tobacco lignin.

40|$|Since the {{discovery}} of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) as the bacterial agent causing tuberculosis, the permanent eradication of this disease has proven challenging. Although a number of drugs exist {{for the treatment of}} tuberculosis, 1. 7 million people still die every year from this infection. The current treatment regimen involves lengthy combination therapy with four different drugs in an effort to combat the development of resistance. However, multidrug-resistant and extensively drug-resistant strains are emerging {{in all parts of the}} world. Therefore, new drugs effective in the treatment of tuberculosis are much-needed. The work presented in this thesis was focused on the early stages of drug discovery by applying different hit identification and hit expansion strategies in the exploration of two new potential drug targets, glutamine synthetase (GS) and 1 -deoxy-D-xylulose- 5 -phosphate reductoisomerase (DXR). A literature survey was first carried out to identify new Mtb GS inhibitors from compounds known to inhibit GS in other species. Three compounds, structurally unrelated to the typical amino acid derivatives of previously known GS inhibitors, were then discovered by virtual screening and found to be Mtb GS inhibitors, exhibiting activities in the millimolar range. Imidazo[1, 2 -a]pyridine analogues were also investigated as Mtb GS inhibitors. The chemical functionality, size requirements and position of the substituents in the imidazo[1, 2 -a]pyridine hit were investigated, and a chemical library was designed based on a focused hierarchical design of experiments approach. The X-ray structure of one of the inhibitors in complex with Mtb GS provided additional insight into the structure–activity relationships of this class of compounds. Finally, new α-arylated fosmidomycin analogues were synthesized as inhibitors of Mtb DXR, exhibiting IC 50 values down to 0. 8 µM.

Lignin is a water-insoluble complex phenolic polymer made up of condensed phenylpropanoid subunits. The enzyme Cinnamyl CoA reductase (CCR) catalyses the synthesis of <b>cinnamaldehydes</b> from the corresponding CoA esters of the cinnamic acids prior to their further reduction by cinnamylalcohol dehydrogenases to monolignols.

Lignin is present in secondary plant cell walls and is an essential component of conducting and supportive structural tissue (e. g. wood) in the plant body. Lignin is very resistant to enzymatic attack and due to its impervious nature, lignin deposition in primary cell walls is a component of plant defence against infection. The purpose of this work, which was part of a collaborative project between several groups, was to address different aspects of the role of lignin in defence in the model plant A. thaliana. Ten Arabidopsis thaliana lignin biosynthesis mutants which had altered lignin amount and composition were provided by the other partners for testing.

40|$|This Ph. D. study {{constitutes}} part of {{an extensive}} project dealing with the design and development of new agents with antimalarial activity. The enzyme 1 -deoxy-D-xylulose- 5 -phosphate reductoisomerase (DXR), which {{is involved in the}} DOXP pathway for isoprenoid synthesis, was chosen as drug target. This non-mevalonate pathway is not operating in humans and inhibitors of DXR can therefore be considered as selective for parasites. Fosmidomycin and its methyl homologue FR 900098, well-known inhibitors of this enzyme that show antimalarial activity in vivo, were used as lead compounds for inhibitor design. The structure of fosmidomycin is characterized by a retrohydroxamic acid group, which acts as a ligand for the metal ion in DXR, and a phosphonate group, which mimics the phosphate group in the substrate structure. It was our objective to further expand the structure-activity relationship (SAR) of fosmidomycin as DXR inhibitor and to discover analogues showing superior activity against the enzyme and/or better antimalarial activity. Modifications were applied to the retrohydroxamic acid group and the propyl chain of the parent structures. Synthetic pathways to these modified fosmidomycines were elaborated. As initial screening method all new compounds were tested for their ability to inhibit DXR of Escherichia coli. The most promising inhibitors were further tested in an in vitro assay on two different Plasmodium falciparum strains. Our investigations are discussed in 4 chapters. 1. To explore the impact of structural modifications of the hydroxyl group of the retrohydroxamic moiety, analogues were synthesized with methyl, ethyl or hydroxyl ethyl substituents on the nitrogen (2. 1 - 2. 9). These modifications did not produce any acceptable inhibitors, which demonstrates the importance of the hydroxyl group in ligating the divalent metal. 2. A synthetic procedure for the preparation of α-aryl-substituted fosmidomycin analogues was developed starting from the corresponding benzylphosphonates or the appropriate <b>cinnamaldehydes.</b> Seven analogues were synthesized, allowing to perform an initial SAR study of this α-aryl series (3. 1 c,e and 3. 2 a-e). Although the α-aryl analogues were generally weaker DXR inhibitors than fosmidomycin, these analogues unambiguously surpassed the activity of fosmidomycin in inhibiting P. falciparum growth. Remarkably, the formyl analogues 3. 1 c and 3. 1 e consistently outperformed the acetyl derivatives 3. 2 c and 3. 2 e, both in the enzyme and the parasite growth inhibition assays. Compound 3. 1 e emerged as the most promising analogue with an IC 50 value of 0. 059 μM. Due to their straightforward synthesis these compounds are suitable for upscaling in further drug development programmes. The deoxygenated sideproducts 3. 17 a,c demonstrated the contribution of the hydroxyl group to the overall affinity. The Michael addition procedure, used to prepare the α-substituted analogues from phenyl-substituted <b>cinnamaldehydes,</b> proved also valuable to prepare the fosmidomycin cyclopentyl analogues 3. 3 and 3. 4. These compounds, featuring a restricted mobility, showed that a trans orientation of the retrohydroxamic acid moiety and the phosphonate group is optimal for binding the enzyme. 3. An efficient and reliable synthesis was established for β- and γ-oxa fosmidomycin analogues. Analogue 4. 4, which combines a β-oxa modification with a hydroxamate moiety was almost as potent in inhibiting DXR as FR 900098. In an in vitro assay it proved almost twice as active as FR 900098 in inhibiting the growth of a P. falciparum 3 D 7 strain. 4. Several synthetic pathways towards the transition state analogue 5. 1 were explored. A 10 -step sequence, involving an asymmetric dihydroxylation, afforded compound 5. 1 in a reasonable yield. Unfortunately, this compound did not show any worth mentioning inhibitory activity. In conclusion, this Ph. D. thesis highlights some important structural requirements for DXR inhibitors. This study also provides valuable information for modifications on fosmidomycin toward new and more efficient inhibitors: introducing aryl modifications on the α-position of the phosphonate moiety significantly improves the antiplasmodial activity in vitro and one oxa analogue with a hydroxamic acid proved to be a more potent inhibitor and to show superior antiplasmodial activity than the parent compound, fosmidomycin. Further investigation on analogues 3. 1 e and 4. 4 is desirable since these compounds are significantly more potent than fosmidomycin on P. falciparum strains. Especially the latter one is very interesting, since it can be easily synthesized. Before further development the toxicological properties of these analogues need to be investigated and their pharmacokinetic profile needs to be established. In vivo studies, employing murine and monkeys models, are required. Further drug design may involve other sterically hindered analogues as well as prodrugs of the most promising analogues.
