40|$|A <b>coating</b> <b>applicator</b> for {{application}} of coating {{material to the}} surface of a web or a flexible substrate. The coating device contains a walled application chamber where a flowing stream of the coating liquid first comes into contact with the substrate. The coating liquid enters a channel of the application chamber at the upstream side and wets the substrate as it flows {{in the same direction as}} the substrate. A doctor element is positioned at the downstream side of the channel where the excess coating in the channel follows the contour of the boundary formed by the doctor element and leaves the channel. One of the applicator walls is designed to be a floating or moving wall or belt. The floating applicator wall and geometry of the streamlined boundaries of the coating device eliminates the formation of recirculating eddies or vortices. The elimination of vortices eliminates flow instability due to centrifugal forces and removes harmful pressure fluctuations which could result in coat-weight nonuniformities.

40|$|A SERDP-sponsored program aims at {{developing}} environmentally benign {{zinc phosphate}} conversion coatings and their process technologies for the electrogalvanized steel (EGS). We succeeded in formulating an environmentally acceptable phosphate solution without Co- and Ni-related additives, {{and also in}} replacing a hexavalent Cr acid sealant applied over the zinc phosphate (Zh-Ph) layers with a water-based polysiloxane sealers. The specific advantages of the newly developed Zn-Ph coatings were as follows: (1) there was rapid growth of uniform, dense embryonic Zn-Ph crystals on the EGS surfaces due {{to the creation of}} short-circuited cells with Mn acting as the cathode and the galvanized (zinc) coatings as the anode, (2) an excellent protection layer against corrosion was formed, extending the service life of zinc layers as galvanic sacrifice barriers, and (3) adhesion to the electro-deposited polymeric primer coating was improved because of the interaction between the siloxane sealer and primer. A full-scale demonstration to evaluate the reproducibility of this new coating technology on mini-sized automotive door panels made from EGS was carried out in collaboration with the Palnut Company (as industrial <b>coating</b> <b>applicator)</b> in New Jersey. All of the 150 mini-door panels were successfully coated with Zn-Ph...|$|E
40|$|Many {{different}} {{products are}} manufactured by depositing a thin liquid layer onto a moving substrate and subsequently solidifying it. Examples of products include premium papers, magnetic tapes and disks, printing materials, photosensitive coatings, membranes, films used {{in different types}} of displays, microelectronics circuits and many others. The region where the liquid first comes {{into contact with the}} substrate is called the coating bead [...] It is usually bounded by two gas-liquid interfaces, or menisci, the solid walls of the <b>coating</b> <b>applicator</b> and the moving substrate. The competition among viscous, capillary and pressure forces, and in some cases inertial and elastic forces, sets the range of operating parameters at which the viscous free surface flow can be two-dimensional and steady â€“ the conditions prerequisite for uniform coating. Coating technology remained an art until the 1940 's. Since then, rigorous mathematical analysis of viscous free surface flows started to be used to gain basic understanding of coating flows. Today, both industrial and academic coating flow research are based on comprehensive theoretical and experimental analysis. Theoretical analysis usually require advanced numerical methods to solve the mass and momentum conservation equations coupled with the appropriate boundary conditions for flows with gas-liquid interfaces. Most of the theoretical analysis can provide details and insights into the physics that control the two-dimensional flow in successful coating operations, stability limits of the flow states and, ultimately, stability limit maps of the process. However, the availabl...|$|E

50|$|A {{bottom-up}} approach was investigated. In 2017 dry contact transfer {{was used to}} press a fiberglass <b>applicator</b> <b>coated</b> with a powder of atomically precise graphene nanoribbons on a hydrogen-passivated Si(100) surface under vacuum. 80 of 115 GNRs visibly obscured the substrate lattice with an average apparent height of 0.30 nm. The GNRs do not align to the Si lattice, indicating a weak coupling. The average bandgap over 21 GNRs was 2.85 eV {{with a standard deviation}} of 0.13 eV.|$|R
40|$|Ceria (CeO 2), chromia (Cr 2 O 3), yttria-stabilized {{zirconia}} (Y 2 O 3 -ZrO 2), {{and sodium}} cerium oxide (Na 2 CeO 3) {{were used as}} barrier coatings on Ufala, an alumina-based ceramic refractory, {{to determine if they}} were effective at increasing the life of the refractory in a high-temperature black liquor gasification environment. The ceria, chromia, and yttria-stabilized zirconia coatings were applied at atmospheric pressure using a <b>coating</b> <b>applicator</b> at the Institute of Paper Science and Technology at the Georgia Institute of Technology. The sodium cerium oxide coatings in addition to the three other coating types were applied under atmospheric pressure at C 3 International Technologies in Alpharetta, GA. The coated refractory, as well as a set of uncoated refractory used for baseline analysis, were tested using molten synthetic smelt at 1000 C for 36 hours. Uncoated refractory samples were also tested for 12, 72, 120, and 168 hours {{in order to make a}} kinetic reaction rate determination. The refractory were analyzed using gravimetric and dimensional analysis, X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy to determine the severity of the physical changes that occurred after exposure to molten smelt. The data gathered from these experiments were not able to conclude that barrier coatings are sufficient to impede corrosion of the Ufala refractory material in molten smelt. M. S.

40|$|Abstract:This {{study was}} focused on {{evaluating}} the bactericidal and anti-adhesive efficacy of silver-hydroxyapatite / titania nanocomposites (nAg-HA/TiO 2) coating on titanium against oral bacteria. Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia and Fusohacterium nucleatum and Streptococcus mutans were used. Antibacterial activity of nAg-HA/TiO 2 coating was investigated quantitatively using film <b>applicator</b> <b>coating</b> method and titanium plates incubated with bacteria were prepared for SEM to observe the adherence of oral bacteria. The viability of each type of bacteria on the antibacterial film was suppressed to about 10 % after anaerobic incubation for 3 hours. Image of SEM demonstrated that bacteria on sandblasting surfaces were relatively confluent whilst on coated surfaces fewer bacteria were observed. Adherence of bacteria on nAg-HA / TiO 2 -coated surfaces compared with uncoated surfaces was remarkably decreased...|$|R
40|$|Thin films {{containing}} silver nanoparticles homogeneously dispersed, {{with narrow}} size distribution below 10 nm, were synthesized on flat glass surface, {{by using an}} ionic silsesquioxane as stabilizer and crosslinking agent. The films can be prepared without previous functionalization of substrate surfaces and without addition of other components. The films were heat treated up to 200 ÂºC and characterized by ultraviolet-visible, transmission electron microscopy, atomic force microscopy, thermogravimetric analysis and ellipsometry. The films were thermally stable when heated up to 200 ÂºC, presenting the same thickness, and maintaining both optical and morphological properties of silver nanoparticles. The antibacterial activity of the films, containing the silver nanoparticles, was evaluated against Staphylococcus aureus by using the film <b>applicator</b> <b>coating</b> method, showing an excellent performance even after the third cycle of sterilization...|$|R
40|$|Aim: The {{present study}} was {{undertaken}} to compare and evaluate the effect of technique-sensitivity on shear bond strength (SBS) of one-step self-etch adhesive, using multiple <b>coats</b> and different <b>applicator</b> designs, to dentin in deciduous molars. Materials and Methods: Flat buccal dentinal surfaces were obtained on 60 extracted human primary molars. The specimens were divided into 3 equal groups (n = 20). Self-etch adhesive was applied on the dentinal surface of group I with cotton pellet, group II with microapplicator tip, and group III using 3 M brush. The groups were further divided into 2 subgroups-single coat of dentin-bonding agent (DBA) in subgroups A and triple coat (with no curing in between coats) in subgroups B. The composite {{was placed on the}} dentinal surface using split nylon cylinder and cured. SBS was tested for all specimens with Instron Universal testing machine. Data were statistically analyzed using one-way analysis of variance and Student&#x 2032;s t test. Results: There was no statistically significant difference in the main study groups, that is, {{no significant difference in the}} SBS with the use of different applicator tips. However, the use of triple coat of self-etch DBA exhibited highly significant difference in the SBS as compared with single coat. Conclusion: This study revealed that one-step self-etch adhesive could prove attractive in pediatric dentistry because of its lesser technique-sensitivity; however, increasing the number of coats of DBA (with no curing in between the layers) enhanced the bond strength to dentin owing to the improved resin infiltration...|$|R
