[...] Distance relays are actually double actuating quantity relays with one coil energized by voltage and other coil by current. [...] The <b>current</b> <b>element</b> produces a positive or pick up torque while the voltage element produces a negative or reset torque.

The simplest approach is to use the calculation of the vector potential A(r) using the formula for the retarded potential. Although the value of A is not unique, we shall constrain it according to the Lorenz gauge, and assuming sinusoidal current at radian frequency ω the retardation of the field is converted just into a phase factor , where the wavenumber k = ω/c in free space and r is the distance between the point being considered to the origin (where we assumed the current source to be), thus r = |r|.

50|$|A better {{exponential}} time algorithm is known which runs in time O(2N/2). The algorithm splits arbitrarily the N elements into two sets of N/2 each. For each of these two sets, it stores {{a list of the}} sums of all 2N/2 possible subsets of its elements. Each of these two lists is then sorted. Using a standard comparison sorting algorithm for this step would take time O(2N/2N). However, given a sorted list of sums for k elements, the list can be expanded to two sorted lists with the introduction of a (k + 1)st element, and these two sorted lists can be merged in time O(2k). Thus, each list can be generated in sorted form in time O(2N/2). Given the two sorted lists, the algorithm can check if an element of the first array and an element of the second array sum up to s in time O(2N/2). To do that, the algorithm passes through the first array in decreasing order (starting at the largest element) and the second array in increasing order (starting at the smallest element). Whenever the sum of the <b>current</b> <b>element</b> in the first array and the <b>current</b> <b>element</b> in the second array is more than s, the algorithm moves to the next element in the first array. If it is less than s, the algorithm moves to the next element in the second array. If two elements with sum s are found, it stops. Horowitz and Sahni first published this algorithm in a technical report in 1972.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} two new {{theories and}} a new current representation to explain the magnetic force between two filamentary <b>current</b> <b>elements</b> {{as a result of}} electric force interactions between current charges. The first theory states that a current has an electric charge relative to its moving observer. The second theory states that the magnetic force is an electric force in origin. The new current representation characterizes a current as equal amounts of positive and negative point charges moving in opposite directions at the speed of light. Previous work regarded electricity and magnetism as different aspects of the same subject. One effort was made by Johnson to unify the origin of electricity and magnetism, but this effort yielded a formula that is unequal to the well-known magnetic force law. The explanation provided for the magnetic force depends on three factors: 1) representing the electric current as charges moving at the speed of light, 2) considering the relative velocity between moving charges, and 3) analyzing the electric field spreading in the space due to the movement of charges inside <b>current</b> <b>elements.</b> The electric origin of the magnetic force is proved by deriving the magnetic force law and Biot-Savart law using the electric force law. This paper is helpful for unifying the concepts of magnetism and electricity. Comment: 24 pages, 27 figures. Published in IEEE ACCESS ([URL]).
