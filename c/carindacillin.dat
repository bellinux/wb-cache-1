50|$|<b>Carindacillin</b> (INN), {{also known}} as Carbenicillin indanyl (USAN) is a {{penicillin}} antibiotic. It is a prodrug of carbenicillin.|$|E
40|$|Absorption {{characteristics}} of <b>carindacillin</b> (CIPC) were investi-gated using Caco- 2 cells, {{and the results}} were compared with those of its parent drug, carbenicillin (CBPC). Uptake of CBPC was not affected by the metabolic inhibitor or the change in extracellular pH. CBPC appeared to be taken up into Caco- 2 cells by passive diffusion. In contrast, the uptake of CIPC was greater at lower extracellular pH and was inhibited in the pres-ence of carbonyl cyanide p-(trifluoromethoxy) phenyl hydra-zone, a protonophore. Also, transport of CIPC through Caco- 2 cell monolayer was energy and temperature dependent. More-over, the uptake and transport of CIPC were significantly inhib-ited in the presence of various monocarboxylic acids, which are the substrates of the monocarboxylic acid transport system(s), whereas the substrates of the oligopeptide transporter had n...|$|E
