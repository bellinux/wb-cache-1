Rats were submitted to chronic supplementation (21 - 90 days of life) with fish oil, rich in omega- 3 PUFAs, and were uni- or bilaterally lesioned with 4 mu g of the neurotoxin 6 -hydroxydopamine (6 -OHDA) in the medial forebrain bundle Although lipid incorporation was evidenced in neuronal membranes, it was not sufficient to <b>compensate</b> <b>motor</b> deficits induced by 6 -OHDA. In contrast, omega- 3 PUFAs were capable of reducing rotational behavior induced by apomorphine, suggesting neuroprotection over dyskinesia The beneficial effects of omega- 3 PUFAs were also evident in the maintenance of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances index from animals lesioned with 6 -OHDA similar to levels from SHAM and intact animals. Although omega- 3 PUFAs did not modify the tyrosine hydroxylase immunoreactivity in the substantia nigra pars compacta and in the ventral tegmental area, nor the depletion of dopamine (DA) and its metabolites in the striatum, DA turnover was increased after omega- 3 PUFAs chronic supplementation Therefore, it is proposed that omega- 3 PUFAs action characterizes the adaptation of remaining neurons activity. altering striatal DA turnover without modifying the estimated neuronal population.

40|$|Motor {{performance}} recovery after {{a demanding}} finger motor task {{does not follow}} the excitability dynamics of primary motor cortex (M 1), which remains depressed also when performance is restored. Thus, other neural circuits are supposed to cope with central fatigue, re-establishing adequate motor performance levels. A hint that the basal ganglia (BG) can {{be involved in this}} process is provided by studies showing an association of central fatigue with the BG. To investigate this possibility, we conducted an fMRI study with simultaneous motor performance recording in 20 healthy volunteers at different stages of a demanding finger motor task: baseline, central fatigue induced by 5 -min sequence repetition, performance recovery after a short rest period. When motor performance was recovered, we observed a significant activation with respect to baseline in subcortical structures belonging to different BG circuits (putamen and globus pallidus), involving the limbic system functionally interacting with the BG (amygdala). Then, to assess whether the BG activation was exclusively related to the fatigue and recovery processes or to increasing automatism in motor performance, a control fMRI experiment based on a shorter motor task duration was carried out on 14 healthy subjects. In this case, the task repetition did not induce decreased performance, and no significant effect on the BOLD signal change was found in BG regions of interest with respect to baseline. All these findings suggest that motor and non-motor BG circuits run parallel and converge in a common motor path to successfully <b>compensate</b> <b>motor</b> performance deterioration in a central fatigue condition...|$|R
40|$|We {{explored}} whether cerebral cortical impact injury (CCI) effects {{extend beyond}} direct lesion sites to affect remote brain networks, and whether acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibition elicits discrete changes in functional activation of motor circuits following CCI. Adult male rats underwent unilateral motor-sensory CCI or sham injury. Physostigmine (AChE inhibitor) or saline were administered subcutaneously continuously via implanted minipumps (1. 6 micromoles/kg/day) for 3 weeks, followed by cerebral perfusion mapping during treadmill walking using [14 C]-iodoantipyrine. Quantitative autoradiographs {{were analyzed by}} statistical parametric mapping and functional connectivity (FC) analysis. CCI resulted in functional deficits in the ipsilesional basal ganglia, with increased activation contralesionally. Recruitment was also observed, especially contralesionally, of the red nucleus, superior colliculus, pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus, thal-amus (ventrolateral n., central medial n.), cerebellum, and sensory cortex. FC decreased significantly within ipsi- and contralesional motor circuits and between hemispheres, but increased between midline cerebellum and select regions of the basal ganglia within each hemisphere. Physostigmine significantly increased functional brain activation in the cere-bellar thalamocortical pathway (midline cerebellum/ventrolateral thalamus/motor cortex), subthalamic nucleus/zona incerta, and red nucleus and bilateral sensory cortex. In conclusion, CCI resulted in increased functional recruitment of contralesional motor cortex and bilateral subcortical motor regions, as well as recruitment of the cerebellar– thalamocortical circuit and contralesional sensory cortex. This phenomenon, augmented by physostigmine, may partially <b>compensate</b> <b>motor</b> deficits.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: The three-dimensional kinematics of the upper limb were quantified during unconstrained reaching movements in seven healthy individuals and in 15 stroke patients. Nine patients were followed-up. Individual observations were correlated with anatomical and functional brain imaging described elsewhere (Feydy et al. Stroke 2002; 33 : 1610). RESULTS: Healthy subjects used mainly elbow extension and shoulder flexion, scaled to movement distance. Patients with hemiparesis because of stroke used different patterns of joint recruitment with different scaling rules. Patients with the greatest impairment compensated by recruiting extra degrees of freedom, particularly trunk bending. Improvement was because of a restoration towards a normal movement pattern (recovery) and/or to a reinforcement of compensation, {{which led to a}} poorer outcome.

40|$|ALS is a fatal {{neurodegenerative}} disease {{characterized by a}} progressive loss of motor neurons and atrophy of distal axon terminals in muscle, resulting in loss of motor function. Motor end plates denervated by axonal retraction of dying motor neurons are partially reinnervated by remaining viable motor neurons; however, this axonal sprouting is insufficient to <b>compensate</b> for <b>motor</b> neuron loss. Activating transcription factor 3 (ATF 3) promotes neuronal survival and axonal growth. Here, we reveal that forced expression of ATF 3 in motor neurons of transgenic SOD 1 G 93 A ALS mice delays neuromuscular junction denervation by inducing axonal sprouting and enhancing motor neuron viability. Maintenance of neuromuscular junction innervation {{during the course of}} the disease in ATF 3 /SOD 1 G 93 A mice is associated with a substantial delay in muscle atrophy and improved motor performance. Although disease onset and mortality are delayed, disease duration is not affected.

However, details of adaptive changes in structural connectivity are not well understood. Here, we show long-term changes in white matter microstructure that relate to motor recovery in stroke patients. We studied ten subcortical ischemic stroke patients who showed motor hemiparesis at the initial clinical examination and an infarcted lesion centered in the posterior limb of internal capsule of the unilateral hemisphere at the initial diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging scan. The participants underwent serial diffusion tensor imaging and motor function assessments at three consecutive time points; within 2 weeks, and at 1 and 3 months after the onset. Fractional anisotropy (FA) was analyzed for regional differences between hemispheres and time points, {{as well as for}} correlation with motor recovery using a tract-based spatial statistics analysis. The results showed significantly increased FA in the red nucleus and dorsal pons in the ipsi-lesional side at 3 months, and significantly decreased FA in the ipsi-lesional internal capsule at all time points, and in the cerebral peduncle, corona radiata, and corpus callosum at 3 months. In the correlation analysis, FA values of clusters in the red nucleus, dorsal pons, midbody of corpus callosum, and cingulum were positively correlated with recovery of motor function.

40|$|It {{is unclear}} whether {{additionally}} recruited sensorimotor areas in the ipsilesional and contralesional hemisphere and the cerebellum can compensate for lost neuronal functions after stroke. The objective {{of this study was}} to investigate how increased recruitment of secondary sensorimotor areas is associated with quality of motor control after stroke. In seventeen patients (three females, fourteen males; age: 59. 9  ±  12. 6  years), cortical activation levels were determined with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in 12 regions of interest during a finger flexion–extension task in weeks 6 and 29 after stroke. At the same time points and by using 3 D kinematics, the quality of motor control was assessed by smoothness of the grasp aperture during a reach-to-grasp task, quantified by normalized jerk. Ipsilesional premotor cortex, insula and cerebellum, as well as the contralesional supplementary motor area, insula and cerebellum, correlated significantly and positively with the normalized jerk of grasp aperture at week 6 after stroke. A positive trend towards this correlation was observed in week 29. This study suggests that recruitment of secondary motor areas at 6  weeks after stroke is highly associated with increased jerk during reaching and grasping. As jerk represents the change in acceleration, the recruitment of additional sensorimotor areas seems to reflect a type of control in which deviations from an optimal movement pattern are continuously corrected. This relationship suggests that additional recruitment of sensorimotor areas after stroke may not correspond to restitution of motor function, but more likely to adaptive motor learning strategies to <b>compensate</b> for <b>motor</b> impairments...|$|R

40|$|Impaired motor {{coordination}} is {{prevalent in}} children with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) and affects adaptive skills. Little {{is known about the}} development of motor patterns in young children with ASD between 2 and 6 years of age. The purpose of the current study was threefold: 1) to describe developmental correlates of motor coordination {{in children with}} ASD, 2) to identify the extent to which motor coordination deficits are unique to ASD by using a control group of children with other developmental disabilities (DD), and 3) to determine the association between motor coordination variables and functional fine motor skills. Twenty-four children with ASD were compared to 30 children with typical development (TD) and 11 children with DD. A precision grip task was used to quantify and analyze motor coordination. The motor coordination variables were two temporal variables (grip to load force onset latency and time to peak grip force) and two force variables (grip force at onset of load force and peak grip force). Functional motor skills were assessed using the Fine Motor Age Equivalents of the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scale and the Mullen Scales of Early Learning. Mixed regression models were used for all analyses. Children with ASD presented with significant motor coordination deficits only on the two temporal variables, and these variables differentiated children with ASD from the children with TD, but not from children with DD. Fine motor functional skills had no statistically significant associations with any of the motor coordination variables. These findings suggest that subtle problems in the timing of motor actions, possibly related to maturational delays in anticipatory feed-forward mechanisms, may underlie some motor deficits reported in children with ASD, but that these issues are not unique to this population. Further research is needed to investigate how children with ASD or DD <b>compensate</b> for <b>motor</b> control deficits to establish functional skills...|$|R
40|$|Recognizing a 3 D object from 2 D images seems {{easy and}} occurs everyday, {{but it is}} in {{principle}} an ill-defined problem. Here we report two behavioural experiments investigating how representations of 3 D objects are built under varying the conditions of the recognition context, i. e. the set of test objects, the prior object knowledge and the degree of stimulus input information. We used a classification paradigm with initially unknown, “structure only” classification criteria, consisting of a category learning part and a subsequent generalization test. The acquisition of prior object knowledge was varied with an intra-modal (visual) group and a trans-modal (blindfold motor) group. Results show that subjects are able to build structure-based object representations from desultory 2 D images. We observe a clear context-dependency, i. e. the task was much more difficult without prior object knowledge (control group) and for images with poor stimulus input information. If, in the 2 D image, alignment cues are only sparsely available and thus the 3 D object structure is ambiguous, this lack of visual information can be trans-modally <b>compensated</b> by <b>motor</b> prior knowledge which seems to be transferred in real-time to the view-dependent representations. The results further suggest the existence of several steps in the recognition process: 1. Image understanding with generation of a hypothetical object model. 2. Transformation and rotation in order to obtain a matching with the image input signal (matching-to-fit-cycle). 3. If step 2 is unsuccessful (e. g. mirror-symmetric objects), the hypothetical object model is referred to an external reference.

40|$|Nowadays {{switched}} {{reluctance motor}} (SRM) drives {{have been widely used}} in the field of controlled electric motor drives. The paper proposes a model reference signal adaptive control method for SRM drives. The main goal of the drive control is to improve dynamical performance by <b>compensating</b> for the <b>motor</b> nonlinearities. The adaptation practically works only in a relatively narrow speed error track (adaptation range) which is equal to approximately 20 - 100 revolution/min absolute value of speed error. The drawback of this limitation is the relatively short time for the algorithm to operate. At the same time the convergence of the algorithm is extremely fast which significantly reduces the effect of this drawback. Two more important advantages emerge when adaptation works only with small speed errors. First of all the controller at changing drive parameters adapts to parameters around the value specified by speed reference signal which also assists to speed the adaptation.

40|$|Nowadays {{switched}} {{reluctance motor}} (SRM) drives have been widel y used {{in the field of}} controlled electric motor drives. The paper proposes a model reference par ameter adaptive control method for SRM drives. The main goal of the drive control is to improve dynami cal performance by <b>compensating</b> for the <b>motor</b> nonlinearities. The adaptation practically works only in a relatively narrow speed error track (adaptation range) which is equa l to approximately 20 - 100 revol ution/min absolute value of speed error. The drawback of this limitation is the relatively short time fo r the algorithm to operate. But the convergence of the algorithm is extremely fast which significan tly reduces the effect of this drawback.
