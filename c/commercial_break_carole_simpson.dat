5000|$|Hedges {{was born}} in West Des Moines, Iowa, where he was raised, the son of <b>Carole</b> (<b>Simpson),</b> a psychotherapist, and the Rev. Robert Boyden Hedges, an Episcopal priest. He {{attended}} Valley High School, where {{he was involved in}} the theater department, including the improv group and the mime troupe, The Bakers Dozen. He later went to the North Carolina School of the Arts where he studied drama.|$|R
50|$|The show debuted on October 4, 1964 (replacing the Cliff Solway-produced series Background) with hosts John Drainie, Laurier LaPierre and <b>Carole</b> <b>Simpson</b> (not to be {{confused}} with the now-retired ABC weekend news anchor of the same name). Simpson was soon replaced by Dinah Christie, and Watson himself replaced Drainie in the show's second season when Drainie (who died in 1966) was too ill to continue with the series.|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} number (0, 3, 6) and {{placement}} (natural, unnatural) of <b>commercial</b> <b>breaks</b> on perception, comprehension and memory were examined. Eighty-eight college students were shown {{one of two}} films and then asked to complete six tasks: (1) estimation of film's duration, (2) rating of film's comprehensibility, (3) summarization of story plot and theme, (4) scene recognition, (5) temporal ordering of scenes, and (6) identifying the location of <b>commercial</b> <b>breaks.</b> Overall, results suggest that an unnatural placement of <b>commercial</b> <b>breaks</b> has an adverse effect on cognitive processing and that performance increasingly deteriorates with more <b>commercial</b> <b>breaks.</b> Conversely, <b>commercial</b> <b>breaks</b> appearing at natural breakpoints led to a higher overall performance that was less affected {{by the number of}} <b>commercial</b> <b>breaks</b> that occurred. An effect of film was also found, suggesting that a film with a more organized plot structure can integrate natural <b>commercial</b> <b>breaks</b> more beneficially than a less-structured film...|$|R

50|$|MTG {{said they}} weren't {{allowed to use}} <b>commercial</b> <b>breaks</b> in the {{terrestrial}} network. The <b>commercial</b> <b>break</b> were replaced by captions. Kanal 5 did however continue broadcasting their <b>commercial</b> <b>breaks</b> as they did on satellite. In January 2001, MTG introduced an extra fee of 115 SEK for TV3, ZTV and TV8 to cover the losses made as they didn't broadcast advertising.|$|R
50|$|In Greece, {{where most}} {{television}} stations and channels do not remove their logo before a <b>commercial</b> <b>break,</b> it is mandatory for public and commercial TV stations {{to separate the}} advertisements {{from the rest of}} the program with each station's ident. Subliminal advertising, tobacco and medication advertisements are not allowed. Most programmes (series, documentaries, etc.) can have one <b>commercial</b> <b>break</b> every 20 minutes. Advertisements must not exceed the 15% of the broadcasting day or 20% if there are direct advertisements for buying or renting products (like informercials). A <b>commercial</b> <b>break</b> must not exceed the length of 4 minutes with the exceptions of movies/telefilms with the length exceeding the 45 minutes, which can have one <b>commercial</b> <b>break</b> for 9 minutes and of the movies/telefilms that exceed the length of 110 minutes which can have more than one <b>commercial</b> <b>break</b> every 45 minutes for 9 minutes.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the choice of}} <b>commercial</b> <b>breaks</b> by a television network in both monopoly and duopoly settings. Viewers dislike commercials in the model, while the networks seek to maximize the total audience for these commercials through their choice of the number, length, and timing of <b>commercial</b> <b>breaks.</b> The model’s prediction of a network’s optimal choice seems to match what we observe in reality; in particular, <b>commercial</b> <b>breaks</b> appear more frequent {{toward the end of}} the program, and the optimal length of breaks is single-peaked. In duopoly equilibrium, <b>commercial</b> <b>breaks</b> on two networks must have the same length and appear at the same time. Compared to monopoly, the breaks in a duopoly equilibrium are longer and/or appear later...|$|R

50|$|Fox, {{who started}} {{covering}} NASCAR in 2001, resisted {{the use of}} the technology for many years. By about 2010, however, executives began exploring the concept. In 2011, they conducted one experimental <b>commercial</b> <b>break</b> with a split-screen format. Through 2011, Fox has preferred to air traditional, full-screen commercials, and if any action occurs during the break, their policy is to interrupt the commercial and return to the live action (e.g. at the 2013 Auto Club 400, the broadcast was in a <b>commercial</b> <b>break</b> when Clint Bowyer blew an engine and spun, so the feed immediately cut the <b>commercial</b> <b>break</b> right away; at the 2013 Aaron's 499, the feed was in <b>commercial</b> <b>break</b> when a crash occurred on lap 43). FOX returned to using the side-by-side coverage during the 2012 Daytona 500.|$|R
