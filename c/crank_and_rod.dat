40|$|A {{mechanical}} {{analysis of}} the hydraulic saw of Hierapolis is presented. The device is the oldest example of saw moved by a water wheel and using a <b>crank</b> <b>and</b> <b>rod</b> mechanism. A bas relief representing the machine was found in Hierapolis, Phrygia, now Turkey, and was studied by the Italian Archaeological Mission in Hierapolis. The bas relief was dated III Century A. D. The paper starts from the archaeological studies of the find and from the early reconstructions that were proposed and presents a new pictorial reconstruction, a mechanical model and a model made by means of WM 2 D™; the latter permitted to easily obtain the mechanical behavior of the machine. The water wheel was also modeled starting from archaeological relict found at Venafro, Italy...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Rake-car’s {{driving system}} of ore {{reclaimer}} originally used <b>crank</b> <b>and</b> connecting <b>rod</b> mechanism as driving mechanism. The driving mechanism got some trouble that parts got severe wear and failure rate of mechanism was high. The hydraulic system {{is used to}} drive rake car in view of hydraulic driving system’s advantage. By analysis on existing problem of <b>crank</b> <b>and</b> connecting <b>rod</b> mechanism, the actual working load of equipment is tested and the working situation is analysed. The working situation of the hydraulic system is also analysed by computer simulation. By optimization of the hydraulic system design, the final design is determined. The whole system is actually used. It works well. Overview The ore reclaimer is key equipment in mineral material factory. It is used to convey ore to belt. One mine material factory of some large steel enterprise has four ore reclaimer. The rake car of the ore reclaimer is driven by <b>crank</b> <b>and</b> connecting <b>rod</b> mechanism. It is composed of motor, gearbox, <b>crank</b> <b>and</b> connecting <b>rod</b> mechanism <b>and</b> rake car. During running, there were some faults that mechanical wear, gear of reduction box getting broken, movement of mechanism having serious impact and so on. In recent years, domestic ore is main source instead of importing ore. Th...|$|R

50|$|Only {{the fixed}} {{parts of the}} engine, such as the block and head, are cooled {{directly}} by the main coolant system.

High performance engines frequently have additional oil, beyond the amount needed for lubrication, sprayed upwards onto the bottom of the piston just for extra cooling.

A more aggressive camshaft was used, with higher lift and duration, and harder valve springs were installed. Compression ratio was increased to 10.2:1. The C2/1 2.7 made 210 bhp with 267 Nm of torque and was the fastest E30 {{available at the time}} (227 km/h top speed). 108 cars were built.|$|R

50|$|The <b>crank</b> <b>and</b> {{connecting}} <b>rod</b> mechanism which converts circular into reciprocal {{motion is}} of utmost importance for the mechanization of work processes; it is first attested for Roman water-powered sawmills. During the Renaissance, its use is greatly diversified and mechanically refined; now connecting-rods are also applied to double compound cranks, while the flywheel is employed to get these cranks over the 'dead-spot'. Early evidence of such machines appears, among other things, {{in the works of}} the 15th-century engineers Anonymous of the Hussite Wars and Taccola. From then on, <b>cranks</b> <b>and</b> connecting <b>rods</b> {{become an integral part of}} machine design and are applied in ever more elaborate ways: Agostino Ramelli's The Diverse and Artifactitious Machines of 1588 depicts eighteen different applications, a number which rises in the 17th-century Theatrum Machinarum Novum by Georg Andreas Böckler to forty-five.|$|R

25|$|From the 16th century onwards, {{evidence}} of <b>cranks</b> <b>and</b> connecting <b>rods</b> integrated into machine design becomes {{abundant in the}} technological treatises of the period: Agostino Ramelli's The Diverse and Artifactitious Machines of 1588 alone depicts eighteen examples, a number which rises in the Theatrum Machinarum Novum by Georg Andreas Böckler to 45 different machines, {{one third of the}} total.|$|R
50|$|The {{crankpins}} for {{the coupling}} rods {{were placed in}} line with the corresponding inside crankpins for the connecting rods. This arrangement was also developed by Stroudley, who claimed that the motion of the inside cranks was smoothly transferred to the coupling rods, as happens in an outside-cylindered engine, where the connecting rod acts directly on a crankpin shared with the coupling rod. According to Stroudley, the axleboxes, bearing surfaces, hornblocks <b>and</b> coupling <b>rods</b> of locomotives with outside cylinders had a service life twice as long as those on inside-cylindered examples. However, by aligning the two cranks together, heavy balancing weights were required on the driving wheels, at 180° to the outside crank, to counteract the combined mass of the <b>cranks</b> <b>and</b> <b>rods.</b> The Badmintons had massive crescent-shaped balancing weights, which made the unmounted pairs of wheels difficult to handle in the workshop.|$|R
5000|$|Later C2 /2 2.7 (and early 1987 B3 2.7) {{used the}} M20B25 block with ETA (325e) <b>crank</b> <b>and</b> <b>rods.</b> The intake {{manifold}} was also redesigned for better flow. The head was decked to improve compression ratio ( [...] 10.1:1 for models with the 731 head, 9.6:1 for later [...] "885" [...] head models with catalytic converter [...] ) and matched with custom pistons - flat MAHLE pistons for engines {{equipped with the}} 731 head, and domed KS pistons for engines equipped with the 885 head. Larger throttle bodies were installed (the C2/2 version uses the same throttle body as the M20B25 325i). A total of 309 cars were built between 1986 and 1987. The C2/2 2.7 makes 204 bhp and 266 Nm of torque. Top speed is 224 km/h and 0-100 kp/h is achieved in 7.5 seconds.|$|R
