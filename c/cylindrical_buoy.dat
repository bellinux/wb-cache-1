The wave barrier consists of a thin flexible membrane suspended {{in the water column}} by a moored <b>cylindrical</b> <b>buoy</b> on the free surface and fixed to a hinge at the seafloor. The analytical model combines the three-degree of freedom rigid body motion of the <b>cylindrical</b> <b>buoy</b> with the two-dimensional analog of a vibrating string for the response of the flexible membrane. Theoretical results for reflection and transmission coefficients, dynamic mooring line tension, horizontal hinge force, horizontal and vertical displacements and rotation of the <b>cylindrical</b> <b>buoy</b> are compared with measured results presented by Bender(1989). In general, the theoretical results compare favorably with measured results for moored systems. However, additional studies are required to more precisely quantify the added mass and radiation damping properties of flexible membranes in oscillating flows...|$|E
40|$|AbstractFloating {{wave energy}} {{converters}} (WECs) {{operating in the}} resonance region are strongly affected by non-linearities arising from {{the interaction between the}} waves, the WEC motion and the mooring restraints. To compute the restrained WEC motion thus requires a method which readily accounts for these effects. This paper presents a method for coupled mooring analysis using a two-phase Navier–Stokes (VOF–RANS) model and a high-order finite element model of mooring cables. The method is validated against experimental measurements of a <b>cylindrical</b> <b>buoy</b> in regular waves, slack-moored with three catenary mooring cables. There is overall a good agreement between experimental and computational results with respect to buoy motions and mooring forces. Most importantly, the coupled numerical model accurately recreates the strong wave height dependence of the response amplitude operators seen in the experiments...|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} capture ocean wave energy and {{transform}} it into electric energy, Uppsala University has developed a point absorber wave energy converter (WEC) for electricity production. For {{a better understanding of}} a torus shaped buoy’s performance, this paper conducts a force analysis under linear conditions, to investigate the hydrodynamic characteristic and line force differences between the torus buoy {{that is going to be}} deployed, and two similar <b>cylindrical</b> <b>buoys.</b> The result reveals the line force from this torus buoy is roughly 5 % larger than from <b>cylindrical</b> <b>buoys</b> for the most energy dense wave climate in Lysekil test site, and negative added mass phenomena won’t have a significant impact for the line force.

40|$|A {{mathematical}} model is presented for a slack-moored wave-energy converter (WEC), {{consisting of a}} semi-submerged heaving buoy moving relative to a submerged plate. For the WEC investigated {{the diameter of the}} <b>cylindrical</b> <b>buoy</b> is 3. 3 m and the cylinder ends are, at equilibrium, 3. 1 m below mean water level and 2. 0 m above. The plate has diameter 8. 0 m, is 0. 2 m thick and is submerged 10 m. The geometry is chosen so that the heave excitation forces on the two bodies are approximately equal in magnitude, but in opposite direction, for wave periods we want to absorb energy from. A high-pressure hydraulic machinery is proposed for energy production and motion control. A valve in the machinery can be actively controlled, and it is used to obtain largest possible power production, and to limit the excursion of the buoy, {{in order to protect the}} hydraulic machinery. In addition, an end-stop device is provided as a safety measure, in case the control fails to limit the excursion. A procedure is developed for control of the device in both sinusoidal and irregular waves. This procedure determines the opening instant of the controllable valve so that, i...|$|E

The experiment was the first experiment made at the Swedish wave energy research area located close to Lysekil on the Swedish west coast. The Lysekil project {{is run by the}} Swedish Centre for Renewable Electric Energy Conversion at Uppsala University.                   The experimental set-up consists of a <b>cylindrical</b> <b>buoy,</b> with a diameter of 3 m and a height of 0. 8 m.

The rope in parallel with the springs represents the limited stroke length of a linear generator type wave energy converter. The measurement system consists of a force transducer between the buoy and the rope, a three axis accelerometer inside the buoy and a data logger remotely operated through the GSM network.      The peak forces related to the significant wave height showed a trend of 33 kN/m.

To maximize the electrical energy extracted from the PTO system, the relative heave motions between the dual buoys must be highly amplified by the multiple resonance phenomena of dual-buoy and internal-fluid motions. The high-performance range can be widened by distributing those natural frequencies with respect to the peak frequency of the wave spectrum. The performance of the newly developed dual-buoy WEC was measured throughout the systematic 1 : 5. 95 -model test in regular and irregular waves conducted in a wave tank at Seoul National University.

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} effect that several {{different}} floaters' geometries have on the performance characteristics of tightly moored vertical axisymmetric wave energy converters (WECs). A <b>cylindrical</b> <b>buoy</b> with and without vertical and horizontal skirts mounted at its bottom, a cone, {{as well as two}} piston-like arrangements, consisting of an internal floater (cone or cylinder) and an exterior torus, have been examined and comparatively assessed. The WEC's first-order hydrodynamic characteristics are evaluated using a linearised diffraction-radiation semi-analytical method. Axisymmetric eigenfunction expansions of the velocity potential are introduced into properly defined ring-shaped fluid regions surrounding the bodies and the potential solutions are matched at the boundaries of adjacent fluid regions by enforcing continuity of the hydrodynamic pressures and radial velocities. A dynamical model for the floaters' performance in time domain is developed that properly accounts for the floater's hydrodynamic behaviour, the coupling terms between the different modes of motion and of the power take-off mechanism. Numerical results are presented and discussed, in terms of the expected power production.

Additionally, results for the power ex-traction are statistically compared with measurements per-formed during field tests in Monterey Bay, California. Dur-ing these tests performance measurements were logged by the buoy, and wave data was recorded by a measurement buoy positioned 1 km from the deployment site. This allows the comparison of actual performance to model predictions run for the sea state present during testing. In general, the results of the numerical model match fairly well with the data acquired in field testing.

The electromechanical system is consisted of a linear permanent magnet generator (LPMG), combined with a cylindrical floating buoy moving due to the sea wave incidence. The basic advantage using LPMG for sea wave energy extraction applications is that the generator exploits directly the vertical movement of the incident sea wave. In such a case, the linear generator is directly coupled with a vertical <b>cylindrical</b> <b>buoy</b> in heave. This topology involves a lighter and simpler mechanical system, in comparison with a complex system that converts the vertical linear movement of the sea wave to rotation, in case that a rotating generator is used. In order to efficiently exploit the wave energy using a point absorber like a floating buoy, {{it is important to}} tune the movement of the coupled mechanism, with the main frequency of the incident wave by using appropriate control.

40|$|Wave energy {{converters}} {{of point}} absorber type {{have been developed}} and constructed. Full scale experiments {{have been carried out}} at sea and electricity has been successfully delivered. Linear permanent magnet generators together with a subsea substation and buoys of various geometric shapes have been investigated theoretically and experimentally. The design has in large extent an electronic approach, keeping the mechanical part of it as simple as possible, due to the long life span and reliability of electric components. Because of the nature of a linear generator, the internal translator with permanent magnets has a limited stroke length which will be reached when the buoy is exposed to large wave heights. Internal springs at {{the top and bottom of}} the generator prevent the translator from hitting the generator hull. Inertial forces due to the mass and velocity of the translator and the buoy and its heave added mass compresses the spring. The added mass is a rather large part of the total moving mass. Simulations of a converter with a vertical <b>cylindrical</b> <b>buoy</b> and with a toroidal buoy were conducted, as well as real sea experiments with converters with cylindrical buoys of two different sizes and a toroidal buoy. The overloads are likely to affect the design and service life of the generator, the buoy and the wire which interconnects them. Buoy shapes with as much excitation force as possible and as little heave added mass as possible were sought. A toroidal buoy caused less overloads on the generator at sea states with short wave periods and relatively large wave height, but for sea states with very long wave periods or extremely high waves, the magnitude of the overloads was mainly determined by the maximum displacement of the buoy. Snap loads on the interconnecting wire, as the slack wire tensed up after a very deep wave trough, were found to be greater but of the same order of magnitude as forces during the rest of the wave cycle. During a 4 day period at various wave conditions, two converters with cylindrical buoys proved efficiency between 11. 1 % and 24. 4 %. The larger buoy had 78 % larger water plane area than the other buoy which resulted in 11 % more power production. Short wave period was beneficial for the power production. Infinite frequency heave added mass was measured for a <b>cylindrical</b> <b>buoy</b> at real sea and found to be greater than the linearly calculated theoretical added mass...|$|E
40|$|An {{important}} {{class of}} floating wave energy converters (that includes the IPS buoy, the Wavebob and the PowerBuoy) comprehends devices {{in which the}} energy is converted from the relative (essentially heaving) motion between two bodies oscillating differently. The paper considers {{the case of the}} IPS buoy, consisting of a floater rigidly connected to a fully submerged vertical (acceleration) tube open at both ends. The tube contains a piston whose motion relative to the floater-tube system (motion originated by wave action on the floater and by the inertia of the water enclosed in the tube) drives a power take-off mechanism (PTO) (assumed to be a linear damper). To solve the problem of the end-stops, {{the central part of the}} tube, along which the piston slides, bells out at either end to limit the stroke of the piston. The use of a hydraulic turbine inside the tube is examined as an alternative to the piston. A frequency domain analysis of the device in regular waves is developed, combined with a one-dimensional unsteady flow model inside the tube (whose cross-section is in general nonuniform). Numerical results are presented for a <b>cylindrical</b> <b>buoy</b> in regular waves, including the optimization of the acceleration tube geometry and PTO damping coefficient for several wave periods...|$|E
40|$|Wave {{and current}} energy can be {{harnessed}} in the East China Sea and South China Sea; however, both areas {{are subject to}} high frequencies of typhoon events. To improve {{the safety of the}} ocean energy conversion device, a Floating Ocean Energy Conversion Device (FOECD) with a single mooring system is proposed, which can be towed to avoid severe ocean conditions or for regular maintenance. In this paper, the structure of the FOECD is introduced, and it includes a catamaran platform, an oscillating buoy part, a current turbine blade, hydraulic energy storage and an electrical generation part. The numerical study models the large catamaran platform as a single, large buoy, while the four floating buoys were modeled simply as small buoys. Theoretical models on wave energy power capture and efficiency were established. To improve the suitability of the buoy for use in the FOECD and its power harvesting capability, a numerical simulation of the four buoy geometries was undertaken. The shape profiles examined in this paper are cylindrical, turbinate (V-shaped and U-shaped cone with cylinder), and combined cylinder-hemisphere buoys. Simulation results reveal that the suitability of a turbinate buoy is the best of the four types. Further simulation models were carried out by adjusting the tip radius of the turbinate buoy. Three performance criteria including suitability, power harvesting capability and energy capture efficiency were analyzed. It reveals that the turbinate buoy has almost the same power harvesting capabilities and energy capture efficiency, while its suitability is far better than that of a <b>cylindrical</b> <b>buoy...</b>|$|E
40|$|Structural Load & Fatigue on Floating Structures conference, London UK, 25 February 2015 The industrialised and densely {{populated}} coastal regions in China are {{in search of}} local energy supplies {{in order to avoid}} expensive energy transmission from the West of China. Wave energy technology is considered as one of the possible solutions with a potential installed capacity of 13 GW around China. However, typhoons are a major meteorological threat for China’s coastal regions with estimated damages of over 20 bnRMB. Prediction, prevention and mitigation of typhoons have greatly improved and coastal regions at risk are readily identified. This paper will outline the environmental load conditions that are faced by floating installations in the Chinese Sea. The paper assesses the feasibility of novel mooring solutions that aim to absorb energy during the most severe load conditions in order to reduce peak and fatigue loads. Their suitability for wave energy converters in high-intensity typhoon conditions is assessed by a fully-coupled hydrodynamic analysis. Initial modelling has been conducted in the time-domain employing a moored <b>cylindrical</b> <b>buoy</b> with six degrees of freedom. The mooring line properties have been chosen to be characteristic of the strongly nonlinear behaviour of novel mooring designs. The results show a reduction in peak loads along {{the entire length of the}} mooring line in comparison to standard rope mooring, whilst crucially not restricting the heave motion of the buoy.

40|$|International audienceIn our days, {{wave energy}} still remains an {{important}} resource {{of renewable energy}} {{that has not been}} yet completely exploited and fully understood. Various prototypes of point absorbers have already been tested numerically and experimentally in wavetanks or real sea, but only a few of them has reach the full scale prototype stage. For the family of wave absorbers based on oscillating bodies principle, the energy production may be enhanced by motion control. The choice of a particular mode of control remains decisive in the design of point absorbers and is closely linked to the mechanism architecture. It has been shown [1] that the theoretical maximum absorption can be reached by bringing the system into resonance applying a so called ”complexconjugate”control. Several sub optimal control strategies have been derived from this observation, trying to overcome the drawbacks of this method, mainly the non-causality of the optimal control [3]. Non-causality implies that one needs to predict the excitation signal in the near future to optimize the controlcommand. The aim of the present study is to propose a new methodology to reduce the prediction horizon needed to apply a complex-conjugate control. Afterwards, a simplification is made leading to a causal non-adaptive control. In this study, a <b>cylindrical</b> <b>buoy</b> constrained to move in heave only is employed to test numerically the aforementioned control. Numerical comparisons are made under regular and irregular waves with the performance of control based on the classical complex-conjugate method.
