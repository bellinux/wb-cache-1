40|$|Libraries are artifact-bound institutions, and as such, will be {{replaced}} as the dominant technology for information communication moves from tangible objects to electronic bits on a network. As this transition occurs, {{it is important to}} understand not what libraries have done, but rather what they are for. Libraries make information easily, publicly, and cheaply available. They are the means through which organizations and communities subsidize the distribution of information to residents and members. Without such support, information is underused, and its potential benefit is lost. As the library fades as the channel for this subsidy, it is critical that the subsidy itself is not lost. If it is, our organizations will be less effective and our communities poorer. By understanding these issues, librarians can shape the information economy so that institutional and <b>community</b> <b>subsidy</b> is maintained, and new technologies enhance and extend information availability. If preserving the library as an institution is our focus, we will fail in these tasks...|$|E

The reasecher {{was interested in}} studying this problem since P 2 KP is the government’s new program {{which is expected to}} be able to solve the current poverty considering there have been many poverty countermeasure programs organized by the government but poverty problem is still difficult to cope with. P 2 KP with its activity in the form of BLM is stimulant fund which is hoped to be capable of developing the community self-support in order that the community is able to support themselves in confronting their prevailing poverty. To solve poverty through this P 2 KP project takes participation of all community without exception, especially of the poor. P 2 KP is one of poverty countermeasure program which enables the poor to take part deeply concerning that activities of P 2 KP, from the beginning, have been planned, conducted, and utilized by the poor themselves. Therefore, this study aims at knowing to what extent the poor community takes part in BLM P 2 KP from the planning, implementation, until result utilization stages. This {{research is}} a quantitative descriptive study. The source of data employed are primary and secondary and collected by using observation technique, deep interview and documentation. Samples were taken by using purposive sample technique. Data validity is by source triangulation technique. While data analysis is by data reduction method, data presentation, and data verification. This research is focused on the poor community who receives BLM P 2 KP in Ngadirejo Village of Kartasura Subdistrict of Sukoharjo Regency. From the research, it can be concluded that there is some participation of the poor community in BLM P 2 KP in the village from planning, implementation until result utilization stages. Although the poor community involves only in one stage, it can be included that they have participated. Anyway, there is obstruction faced by the poor in utilizing BLM P 2 KP either from the inside or outside. Nevertheless, the obstacle does not make the community stops participating in BLM P 2 KP since this program is one of the ways to solve the poverty they have undergone in order to increase their welfare...|$|E

40|$|The {{arable crop}} sector in Spain is highly {{dependent}} of the <b>Community</b> <b>subsidies</b> and account for 33 % of total transfers {{received by the}} Community. Then, {{it is expected that}} the introduction of the Single Farm Payment (SFP) will drive important changes in the arable crop production in Spain. The quantitative assessment of the SFP impacts on the arable crop sector in Spain is the overall objective of this paper. To achieve this goal, an econometric, dynamic, multi-product and partial equilibrium commodity model has been built disaggregating between irrigated and non-irrigated land use for cereals called Spanish Econometric Simulation of Agricultural Policies (SESAP). Results indicated that the introduction of the SFP has only induced considerable changes from the Agenda 2000 in the supply side, having found only small changes in imports and exports, and insignificant or null changes in domestic use. Cereals and oilseeds production is expected higher decreases under the SFP scenario than under the Agenda 2000. The main differences between irrigated and non-irrigated production of the different cereals are two. Wheat and barley are mainly produced in non-irrigated land where production shows less dependence on policy changes in the case of wheat and have a positive impact in the case of barley. However, barely and maize irrigated production would have remained constant under the Agenda 2000 but a decrease of 25 % is predicted under the SFP scenario. In addition, maize is mainly produced in irrigated land, and the non-irrigated production will enormously decrease until almost disappear in the near future.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{predict the}} {{geographical}} effects of community rating {{of health insurance}} premiums on the amount individuals pay for insurance. DATA SOURCES: We estimate premiums and health expenditures for a 5 percent sample of Californians from the 1990 U. S. Census (the Public Use Microdata Sample) and use data from Blue Cross of California to adjust for regional price differences in services. STUDY DESIGN: We use an episodic health simulation model to estimate health expenditures for 975, 074 Californians. Because the simulations do not reflect expenditure differences due to price variation in cost of services, we adjust these data for relative price differences by county. This leaves us {{with a sample of}} Californians for whom we have estimated health expenditures. We then compute average expenditures within areas of different sizes (all California, two regions, within counties) to estimate community-rated premiums. We then compare these premiums with actual expenditures on a county-by-county basis. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: With a single California-wide premium, rural residents pay premiums that exceed their use of care, while urban residents pay premiums that are less than their use of care. These transfers are substantial. Dividing California into regional risk pools at the county level still results in poorer <b>communities</b> providing substantial <b>subsidies</b> to their more wealthy counterparts. CONCLUSIONS: Mandated community rating of premiums in a heterogeneous state such as California results in large unintended transfers of wealth from poorer, rural communities to urban, wealthier communities. Allowing premiums to vary with the regional cost of medical care would eliminate some of the transfers without sacrificing the benefits of <b>community</b> rating. <b>Subsidies</b> to low-income families could also effectively mitigate this redistribution.

At the household level, 420 farm households were surveyed to analyse both the determinants of adoption {{and the extent of}} adoption (i. e. hectares dedicated to jatropha). The variables determining adoption were analysed at both levels using generalised linear models. The extent of jatropha adoption was assessed using ordinary least squares multiple regression.

40|$|The {{biosphere}} {{is composed}} of a mosaic of ecosystems that are connected to one another through biological and physical processes. Animals that migrate over large spatial scales can {{play a significant role}} in vectoring nutrients and energy from one ecosystem to another. For example, seabirds forage in pelagic ecosystems on fish, krill, and squid and then migrate thousands of kilometers to breeding islands where they deposit large concentrations of nutrient-rich feces, or guano. Over sixty years ago, G. E. Hutchinson hypothesized that nutrients from seabird guano could increase primary productivity in recipient marine ecosystems. The nutrients in seabird guano have been widely documented to dramatically alter recipient terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems, but the influence of guano on nearshore marine ecosystems remains elusive. In the following dissertation, I assess the impact of seabird guano on one of the most biodiverse marine ecosystems on earth; coral reefs. First, I examine the influence of seabird guano subsidies on coral reef benthic community composition and fish biomass across one of the largest marine protected areas on earth, the Pacific Remote Islands Marine National Monument. I demonstrate that coral reefs next to islands with high densities of seabird guano have more herbivorous fishes and significantly different benthic communities. Next, I use stable isotope analysis and benthic percent cover data to evaluate the nitrogen-footprint from seabirds on coral reef macroalgae adjacent to Rose Atoll, American Samoa. I demonstrate that algae adjacent to Rose Island, which is home to a large seabird colony, is enriched in delta 15 N. However, algal ecological responses to seabirds are taxon-specific: fleshy algal cover increases with increasing proximity to Rose Island, whereas calcareous algal cover decreases with increasing proximity to Rose Island. Finally, I assess relative differences in seawater nutrients and algal nitrogen isotope values in the complex, anthropogenically-modified coral reefs of Oahu, Hawaii to see how seabird <b>community</b> <b>subsidies</b> may alter coral reefs in pristine vs. impacted Pacific islands. Even in the midst of anthropogenic fishing and nutrient enrichment, I demonstrate that islets with large seabird colonies have greater dissolved phosphate values and higher algal delta 15 N compared to islets with small seabird colonies. Together, these three data chapters are the first test of Hutchinson’s local enrichment hypothesis in coral reef ecosystems, and they provide strong evidence that seabirds significantly influence coral reef ecology and biogeochemistry via cross-ecosystem nutrient subsidies. Coral reefs and seabirds are two of the most threatened marine communities on the planet, but they are currently managed in isolation. The results of this research indicate that seabirds should no longer be ignored as a significant source of nutrients on coral reefs. Instead, seabird and coral reef conservation should be integrated in order to maximize efficient and potentially synergistic management of these two globally-imperiled marine communities...|$|R

It remains unclear, however, how dropout can be effectively reduced, as many different factors are determining student dropout. Community schools recognize this and modernize education such that it better accommodates students' personal needs. As a result these schools cooperate more with external organizations, stimulate parental involvement in the educational process and organize more extracurricular activities. Despite {{the increasing number of}} community schools, there is no empirical evidence that these schools reduce student dropout. This study examines the impact of Dutch community schools on student dropout. It focuses in particular on pre-vocational education, because dropout is particularly high in this educational track.

This enables us to estimate the community school impact by means of a difference-in-differences estimation model combined with an iterative matching approach. The estimation results suggest that community schools are as effective as regular schools with respect to dropout reduction. <b>Community</b> school <b>subsidies</b> do not seem to contribute to reducing dropout...|$|R

Densities in autotroph communities were also strikingly higher when receiving <b>subsidies</b> from heterotroph <b>communities</b> compared to their own subsidies when grown in isolated ecosystems. In contrast, communities connected to predator-dominated ecosystems collapsed, without any direct contact with the predators. Our results demonstrate that because community composition and structure modify the distribution of biomass within a community, they may also a ect <b>communities</b> connected through <b>subsidies</b> through quantitative and qualitative changes of detritus ows. is stresses that ecosystem management should account for such interdependencies mediated by spatial subsidies, given that local community alterations cascade across space onto other ecosystems even if species dispersal is completely absent...|$|R

Whether recipient communities adjust their composition, in turn, {{to maximize their}} function in response to changes in donor composition at these two scales of diversity is unknown. We use small stream communities that rely on riparian subsidies as a model system. We used leaf pack experiments to ask how variation in plants growing beside streams in the Olympic Peninsula of Washington State, USA affects stream <b>communities</b> via leaf <b>subsidies.</b> Leaves from red alder (Alnus rubra), vine maple (Acer cinereus), bigleaf maple (Acer macrophyllum) and western hemlock (Tsuga heterophylla) were assembled in leaf packs to contrast low versus high diversity, and deployed in streams to compare local versus non-local leaf sources at the among and within species scales. Leaves from individuals within species decomposed at varying rates; most notably thin leaves decomposed rapidly. Among deciduous species, vine maple decomposed most rapidly, harbored the least algal abundance, and supported the greatest diversity of aquatic invertebrates, while bigleaf maple was at the opposite extreme for these three metrics. Recipient communities decomposed leaves from local species rapidly: leaves from early successional plants decomposed rapidly in stream reaches surrounded by early successional forest and leaves from later successional plants decomposed rapidly adjacent to later successional forest. The species diversity of leaves inconsistently affected decomposition, algal abundance and invertebrate metrics. Intraspecific diversity of leaf packs also did not affect decomposition or invertebrate diversity. However, locally sourced alder leaves decomposed more rapidly and harbored greater levels of algae than leaves sourced from conspecifics growing in other areas on the Olympic Peninsula, but did not harbor greater aquatic invertebrate diversity. In contrast to alder, local intraspecific differences via decomposition, algal or invertebrate metrics were not observed consistently among maples. These results emphasize that biodiversity of riparian subsidies at the within and across species scale {{have the potential to}} affect aquatic ecosystems, although there are complex species-specific effects...|$|R
