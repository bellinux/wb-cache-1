However, the mechanisms underlying the beneficial effects of PLP are still unclear. Using Drosophila as a model system, we show that PLP deficiency caused either by mutations in the pyridoxal kinase-coding gene (dPdxk) or by vitamin B 6 antagonists results in chromosome aberrations (CABs). The CAB frequency in PLP-depleted cells was strongly enhanced by sucrose, glucose or fructose treatments, and dPdxk mutant cells consistently displayed higher glucose contents than their wild type counterparts, an effect that is {{at least in part}} a consequence of an acquired insulin resistance. Together, our results indicate that a high intracellular level of glucose has a dramatic <b>clastogenic</b> <b>effect</b> if combined with PLP deficiency. This is likely due to an elevated level of Advanced Glycation End-products (AGE) formation. Treatment of dPdxk mutant cells with alpha lipoic acid (ALA) lowered both AGE formation and CAB frequency, suggesting a possible AGE-CAB cause-effect relationship. The <b>clastogenic</b> <b>effect</b> of glucose in PLP-depleted cells is evolutionarily conserved. RNAi-mediated silencing of PDXK in human cells or treatments with PLP inhibitors resulted in chromosome breakage, which was potentiated by glucose and reduced by ALA.

The genotoxic and antigenotoxic potential of punarnavine was assayed using the comet assay on lymphocytes, liver, spleen, brain, and bone marrow as well as using the micronucleus test in bone marrow cells including the in vitro chromosomal aberration test.

Materials and Methods: Different groups of mice were exposed to different doses of Gamma rays (alone). The other groups received different doses of these drugs two hours before intraperitoneal injection of 2 Gy irradiation. Samples were collected 24 hours after irradiation.

For each specimen, 1500 poly chromatic erythrocyte (PCE) and same number of Normo chromatic erythrocyte (NCE) and poly chromatic erythrocyte Containing micro- nuclei (mn PCE) were counted.
