5|$|One of {{the revolutionary}} {{features}} of the Apache was its helmet mounted display, the Integrated Helmet and Display Sighting System (IHADSS); among its capabilities, either the pilot or gunner can slave the helicopter's 30mm automatic M230 <b>Chain</b> <b>Gun</b> to their helmet, making the gun track head movements to point where they look. The M230E1 can be alternatively fixed to a locked forward firing position, or controlled via the Target Acquisition and Designation System (TADS). On more modern AH-64s, the TADS/PNVS {{has been replaced by}} Lockheed Martin's Arrowhead (MTADS) targeting system.|$|E
5|$|The Batmobile has two modes, {{which can}} be {{switched}} at any time: Pursuit and Battle. Pursuit is for moving from area to area and completing specific driving challenges. In Battle mode, the Batmobile becomes more tank than car, allowing a full 360-degree range of movement, including strafing in any direction, while revealing the multiple weapon systems on board, including a Vulcan <b>chain</b> <b>gun</b> for quick damage, a 60mm hypervelocity cannon for fire support, anti-tank guided missiles for wide-ranging damage against multiple targets, and a non-lethal riot suppressor.|$|E
5|$|Wolfenstein 3D is a first-person shooter {{presented}} with rudimentary 3D graphics. The game is broken up into levels, {{each of which}} is a flat plane divided into areas and rooms by a grid-based pattern of walls and doors, all of equal height. Each level is themed after Nazi bunkers and buildings. To finish a level, the player must traverse through the area to reach an elevator. Levels—ten in the original episodes—are grouped together into named episodes, with the final level focusing on a boss fight with a particularly difficult enemy. While traversing the levels, the player must fight Nazi guards and soldiers, dogs, and other enemies while managing supplies of ammunition and health. The player can find weapons and ammunition placed in the levels or can collect them from dead enemies; weapons include a knife, a pistol, a submachine gun, and a rapid-fire <b>chain</b> <b>gun.</b> While the levels are presented in a 3D perspective, the enemies and objects are instead 2D sprites presented from several set viewing angles, a technique sometimes referred to as 2.5D graphics.|$|E
25|$|Prior to {{turn-over}} to the Philippine Navy, {{the ship}} was armed with a Mk.75 Oto Melara 76 mm Compact main gun, two Mk.38 25 mm Bushmaster <b>chain</b> <b>guns</b> at midships, and a Phalanx CIWS system aft. The CIWS and <b>chain</b> <b>guns</b> were removed prior to its turn-over, with the Mk.75 gun remaining.|$|R
50|$|The Philippines ordered two new Mk. 38 Mod. 2 25mm <b>chain</b> <b>guns,</b> {{and these}} are {{expected}} to be installed to the ships of the class. On Feb. 17, 2014, it was reported that said <b>chain</b> <b>guns</b> were in the Philippines, waiting for the U.S. Coast Guard armament team for installation. As of January 25, 2015, 2 Mk. 38 Mod. 2 25mm guns had been installed on PF-16.|$|R
25|$|The Philippines {{reportedly}} ordered {{at least}} two new Mk.38 Mod 2 25mm <b>chain</b> <b>guns,</b> {{and are expected to}} be installed on all Gregorio del Pilar class.|$|R
25|$|As part of {{the first}} batch (PG-370 to PG-378), it is not {{equipped}} with Mk.38 Mod.0 M242 Bushmaster 25mm <b>chain</b> <b>gun</b> that her other sister ships carry. It was planned to install either a stabilized or unstabilized M242 25mm Bushmaster <b>chain</b> <b>gun</b> on her bow after some minor modifications, but as of to date has not materialized.|$|E
25|$|An AH-64 {{was used}} to attempt to {{suppress}} the Hulk in the 2008 film, The Incredible Hulk. Although it has the standard, nose mounted M230 <b>Chain</b> <b>Gun,</b> it instead attacks with the unusual configuration of twin, pylon-mounted miniguns.|$|E
25|$|The {{ship was}} {{armed with a}} Mk.75 Oto Melara 76 mm Compact main gun, two Mk.38 M242 Bushmaster 25mm <b>chain</b> <b>gun</b> at midships, and a Phalanx CIWS system aft. The CIWS and chain guns were removed by the US Coast Guard prior to its {{turn-over}} to the Philippine Navy. Only the Mk.75 gun remains.|$|E
50|$|The game {{features}} {{a wide variety}} of naval vessels, from tiny sampans to powerful speedboats and torpedo boats, on up to destroyers and a massive battleship. Over a dozen of these are playable and most have multiple weapon configurations. The weapon types include the standard <b>chain</b> <b>guns,</b> cannon, torpedoes, rockets and mines, plus some unique weapons that are unlocked as you progress through the game. Each boat has machine <b>guns</b> or <b>chain</b> <b>guns</b> as its base, primary armament. Most have one or more heavy weapons as their secondary armament.|$|R
50|$|The {{time that}} the chain takes to move around a {{complete}} loop of the rectangle controls the rate of fire, so varying the motor speed allows <b>chain</b> <b>guns,</b> in principle, to fire at a rate continuously variable from single rounds to the maximum safe rate imposed by the pressure drop rates in the barrel after firing a cartridge, mechanical tolerances, and other factors. For example, the 7.62mm NATO version EX-34 was advertised to offer 570 rounds per minute, and developmental work was underway for a 1,000-rounds-per-minute version. In practice, <b>chain</b> <b>guns</b> usually {{have two or three}} set firing speeds.|$|R
50|$|According to his bio, Roadbuster and his {{partners}} specialize in traveling across the galaxy to hunt down Decepticons. In the film, he speaks with a Scottish accent. Roadbuster has a pair of shoulder rockets and some <b>chain</b> <b>guns</b> on his hands.|$|R
25|$|Plans {{to install}} {{additional}} weapons were made, which includes one Mk. 38 Mod 1 25 mm <b>chain</b> <b>gun</b> aft, two Mk.16 20 mm autocannons midships, and six 12.7 mm machine guns. These were installed during its scheduled dock works before the commissioning ceremonies. Photos during the commissioning ceremonies confirmed {{the presence of}} such weapons.|$|E
25|$|The M2 Bradley turret {{provides}} the EIFV with considerable firepower on a cheap M113 chassis, and {{allows it to}} engage personnel, armored vehicles and tanks, as well as low flying targets and helicopters. It has the same fire control and stabilization features on the M2 Bradley. The armament consists of the 25mm M242 <b>chain</b> <b>gun</b> with 800 rounds and an effective range of 3000 m, and a coaxial 7.62 mm machine gun with 2,100 rounds. Using armor-piercing rounds, the <b>chain</b> <b>gun</b> can engage armored vehicles and tanks. The turret also has a two-tube TOW launcher, capable of launching TOW II ATGM missiles, which can destroy most tanks at a maximum range of 3750 m, enabling the vehicle {{to be used in}} an anti tank role. The only major drawback is that the missiles can only be launched when the vehicle is stationary. In addition to the two missiles in the launcher are four more missiles, stowed away inside the vehicle. The turret is standard equipped with passive IR and thermal imaging equipment.|$|E

25|$|The Sabre was {{a hybrid}} vehicle, with the turret from a Fox Armoured Reconnaissance Vehicle on a FV101 Scorpion hull and {{armed with the}} same 30mm RARDEN cannon as the Scimitar. One hundred and thirty-six of these hybrid {{vehicles}} were brought into service in 1995, after some modifications {{were made to the}} turret. These modifications included; redesigning the smoke grenade dischargers, replacing the standard machine gun with a L94A1 <b>chain</b> <b>gun</b> and domed hatches to improve headroom for the commander and gunner. They were assigned to the reconnaissance platoons of armoured and mechanised infantry battalions before being withdrawn from service in 2004.|$|E
25|$|MH-60L DAP: The Direct Action Penetrator (DAP) is {{a special}} {{operations}} modification of the baseline MH-60L, operated by the U.S. Army's 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment. The DAP is configured as a gunship, with no troop-carrying capacity. The DAP is equipped with ESSS or ETS stub wings, each capable of carrying configurations of the M230 <b>Chain</b> <b>Gun</b> 30mm automatic cannon, 19-shot Hydra 70 rocket pod, AGM-114 Hellfire missiles, AIM-92 Stinger air-to-air missiles, GAU-19 gun pods, and M134 minigun pods, M134D miniguns are used as door guns. which are typically fixed forward for firing during strafing runs.|$|E
25|$|The US Coast Guard removed {{some of the}} ship’s {{equipment}} {{before its}} transfer to the Philippine Navy and plans to use those equipment as spare parts for the other US Coast Guard ships. Among those that were removed are the AN/SPS-40 air surface search radar, Phalanx CIWS, and two Mk.38 M242 Bushmaster 25mm chain guns. In return, the US Coast Guard began procuring and installing the safe-to-sail navigation equipment, radar systems and additional electronics that the Philippines requested {{as part of its}} transfer support case. The Philippine Navy installed a 25 mm <b>chain</b> <b>gun,</b> two 20 mm guns, and six mounted 50-caliber guns as replacement for the equipment removed.|$|E

When Inferno Cop notices the exit to Hell, Mecha Cop chooses to stay in Hell and help others instead.|$|R
5000|$|The {{armament}} of {{the first}} four Wasp class consists of two Mark 29 octuple launchers for RIM-7 Sea Sparrow missiles, two Mark 49 launchers for RIM-116 Rolling Airframe Missiles, three 20 mm Phalanx CIWSs, four Mark 38 and 25 mm <b>chain</b> <b>guns,</b> and four [...]50 caliber machine guns. The next four ships, , , , and , have a slightly reduced weapons outfit compared to their preceding sister ships, with one Phalanx and one Mark 38 gun removed.|$|R
50|$|Speedboat: small, fast {{boat with}} light weaponry. This is the boat {{given to the}} player in {{the first chapter of}} Story Mode. Its {{armament}} usually consists of 4 <b>chain</b> <b>guns</b> or auto-cannons, but later adds a rocket launcher. However, the boat is completely stripped of all armaments for one special mission involving a time trial-style race. In one special mission later in the game it is armed with the Stinger, an extremely powerful, but short-ranged electrical weapon.|$|R
25|$|On 26 September 2016, the U.S. Army {{placed an}} order for another 130 JLTVs and 748 kits valued at $42 million; this was the third JLTV order since {{contract}} award. Fiscal Year 2016 funding budgets for 804 JLTVs. The Army received its first seven JLTVs for test {{at the end of}} September 2016 according to Colonel Shane Fullmer, JLTV project manager stated at an AUSA 2016 media briefing. He said test vehicles would be sent to Yuma, Arizona, for automotive and mobility testing; to Ft Huachuca, Arizona, for cyber, electronic warfare, and C4 testing; Aberdeen Proving Ground, Maryland, for reliability and automotive testing; and to Alaska for automotive and environmental testing. Some JLTV testing was deferred during the EMD phase, as the government did not want to pay for testing with three suppliers, and it is now set for testing with a fleet of 100 JLTVs. By April 2017 30 JLTVs had been delivered, testing expected to continue through the first quarter of FY19. Also at an AUSA 2016 media briefing, Scott Davis, program executive officer for Combat Support & Combat Service Support, stated that Overall the JLTV programme expects to cut about five years off of the total program and save about US$5.9 billion, as Oshkosh's final competitive bid was low enough so the army decided to 'buy to budget' and get more platforms each year, which shrunk the total length of the contract and increased cost avoidances accrued each year. At AUSA 2016, Oshkosh displayed a JLTV General Purpose variant equipped with an EOS R-400S-MK2 remote weapon system integrated with Orbital ATK's M230 LF 30mm lightweight automatic <b>chain</b> <b>gun.</b>|$|E
500|$|Most nations {{use these}} rapid-fire cannon on their light vehicles, {{replacing}} a more powerful, but heavier, tank gun. A typical autocannon is the 25mm [...] "Bushmaster" [...] <b>chain</b> <b>gun,</b> {{mounted on the}} LAV-25 and M2 Bradley armored vehicles.|$|E
500|$|The Boeing AH-64 Apache is an American four-blade, twin-turboshaft attack {{helicopter}} with a tailwheel-type landing gear arrangement and a tandem cockpit for a two-man crew. It features a nose-mounted sensor suite for target acquisition and night vision systems. It is {{armed with a}} [...] M230 <b>chain</b> <b>gun</b> carried between the main landing gear, under the aircraft's forward fuselage, and four hardpoints mounted on stub-wing pylons for carrying armament and stores, typically a mixture of AGM-114 Hellfire missiles and Hydra 70 rocket pods. The AH-64 has {{a large amount of}} systems redundancy to improve combat survivability.|$|E
50|$|Devil Boat: at 75 feet long, this is {{the largest}} and most heavily armed playable boat in the game. Inspired by the PT boats of WWII, it has 4 forward mounts for its primary {{armament}} of auto cannons or <b>chain</b> <b>guns.</b> Its secondary armament features dual center mounted rocket launchers, a rear-mounted mine launcher, and four side mounts. The side mounts may have 2 fixed cannons on the forward pair plus 2 torpedo launchers on the rear pair, or 4 torpedo launchers.|$|R
5000|$|USS Firebolt (PC-10) is the 10th {{member of}} the Cyclone-class of coastal patrol boats. She is a 174 ft vessel with a crew of {{approximately}} 30 sailors, normally homeported at Naval Amphibious Base Little Creek, Norfolk, Virginia. Her armament includes two Mk38 <b>chain</b> <b>guns,</b> two Mk19 automatic grenade launchers, and two [...]50 in machine guns, as well as six Stinger missiles. She was laid down by Bollinger Shipyards on 17 September 1993, launched on 10 June 1994, and commissioned into the Navy on 10 June 1995.|$|R
50|$|Catamaran: the game's {{signature}} boat, this {{is featured}} on the game's cover. Standard armament for this vessel includes 2 <b>chain</b> <b>guns</b> or auto cannons, with a center mount that may have a rocket launcher, the Stinger, or the Wave Gun (another special weapon type that generates a wave that can detonate torpedoes and sea mines as well as jolt smaller vessels. In addition, it has a pair of side mounts that may hold torpedo launchers or fixed cannons. These weapons differ in combination depending {{on the model of}} Catamaran.|$|R
500|$|Gears of War 2 is a {{third person}} shooter with an {{emphasis}} on the tactical use of cover, and retains much of the same gameplay from the first game. The player, playing as either Marcus or Dominic in the campaign mode, or as any of the human or Locust characters in multiplayer mode, can only carry a pistol, one type of grenade, and two other weapons at any time, though they may swap these for weapons found in strategic locations or left by downed foes or fallen allies. Each weapon can be used for normal fire as well as for melee attacks; the game's signature Lancer, an assault rifle mounted with a chainsaw bayonet for its melee, can be used to instantly kill foes. The game introduces the ability to engage in chainsaw duels should the player attempt to chainsaw an opponent also using the Lancer; the player is presented with a controller button to press rapidly to try to win the duel and avoid death. Gears of War 2 rebalances the power of the existing weapons while introducing five new ones: a flamethrower, a <b>chain</b> <b>gun,</b> a mortar cannon, a [...] "Gorgon" [...] Pistol, and the Ink Grenade. The <b>chain</b> <b>gun</b> and the mortar are heavy weapons, forcing the player to move at walking speed while carrying it in both hands. The Gorgon Pistol is an SMG-like machine pistol that fires four four-shot bursts per magazine. The Ink Grenade doesn't damage with its detonation, but instead temporarily poisons the area it was thrown, making it very useful for driving enemies out of cover. Grenades can be planted on walls or floors as proximity traps that go off when an enemy nears, but only fragmentation grenades have the ability to kill foes when they go off.|$|E
500|$|Most nations use rapid-fire cannon {{on light}} vehicles, {{replacing}} a more powerful, but heavier, tank gun. A typical autocannon is the 25mm [...] "Bushmaster" [...] <b>chain</b> <b>gun,</b> {{mounted on the}} LAV-25 and M2 Bradley armoured vehicles. Autocannons may be capable of a very high rate of fire, but ammunition is heavy and bulky, limiting the amount carried. For this reason, both the 25mm Bushmaster and the 30mm RARDEN are deliberately designed with relatively low rates of fire. The typical rate of fire for a modern autocannon ranges from 90 to 1,800 rounds per minute. Systems with multiple barrels, such as a rotary autocannon, can have rates of fire of more than several thousand rounds per minute. The fastest {{of these is the}} GSh-6-23, which has a rate of fire of over 10,000rounds per minute.|$|E
500|$|The AH-64 is {{adaptable}} to numerous different roles within its context as Close Combat Attack (CCA). In {{addition to the}} 30mm M230E1 <b>Chain</b> <b>Gun,</b> the Apache carries a range of external stores and weapons on its stub-wing pylons, typically a mixture of AGM-114 Hellfire anti-tank missiles, and Hydra 70 general-purpose unguided [...] rockets. An 18-aircraft Apache battalion can carry 288 Hellfire missiles, each capable of destroying a tank. Since 2005, the Hellfire missile is sometimes outfitted with a thermobaric warhead; designated AGM-114N, it is intended for use against ground forces and urban warfare operations. The use of thermobaric [...] "enhanced blast" [...] weapons, such as the AGM-114N, has been a point of controversy. In October 2015, the U.S. Army ordered its first batch of Advanced Precision Kill Weapon System (APKWS) guided 70mm rockets for the Apache.|$|E
5000|$|Airwolf {{was painted}} [...] "Phantom Gray Metallic" [...] (DuPont Imron 5031X) on top, and a custom pearl-gray (almost white) on the bottom, in a countershaded pattern. The craft was also fitted with various prop modifications, such as [...] "turbo jet" [...] engines and intakes, an in-air {{refueling}} nozzle and blister cowling on the nose, retractable <b>chain</b> <b>guns</b> at the wingtips, and a retractable rocket launcher, {{known as the}} [...] "ADF Pod" [...] (ADF standing for All Directional Firing, as the pod could rotate 180 degrees to fire at targets at the sides - 90 degrees to the left, forward, or 90 degrees to the right) on its belly.|$|R
5000|$|Standard {{armament}} {{consists of}} two remote-controlled Mk 38 Mod 2 25 mm <b>chain</b> <b>guns</b> and six crewed M2 [...]50 caliber machine guns. Depending on mission needs, gun mounts can hold M240 machine guns, M134 miniguns, and Mk 19 grenade launchers. The Mark VI is equipped with the MK50 Gun Weapon System (GWS), a shipboard version of the vehicle-mounted M153 CROWS remote turret that enables crewmen to use its camera and gun from the operator's station below deck. It is also planned to mount guided missiles such as the BGM-176B Griffin. Armor plating, able to withstand small-arms fire, is around key elements such as the engines and fuel tank.|$|R
