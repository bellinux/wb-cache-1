50|$|Though an {{important}} milestone, Zero 1 was not widely successful; both the <b>controller</b> <b>units</b> and the decoder modules {{required for the}} locomotives and accessories were expensive, but with a clean track and well serviced locos the system worked more or less as advertised.|$|R
50|$|ALE {{evolved from}} older HF radio {{selective}} calling technology. It combined existing channel-scanning selective calling concepts with microprocessors (enabling FEC decoding and quality scoring decisions), burst transmissions (minimizing co-channel interference), and transponding (allowing unattended operation and incoming-call signalling). Early ALE systems {{were developed in}} the late 1970s and early 1980s by several radio manufacturers. The first ALE-family <b>controller</b> <b>units</b> were external rack mounted controllers connected to control military radios, and were rarely interoperable across vendors.|$|R

40|$|This {{contribution}} presents {{some ideas}} on the synthesis of hierarchical control systems. Hierarchical control {{is an attempt to}} handle complex problems by decomposing them into smaller subproblems and reassembling their solutions in a hierarchical structure. A systematic approach to this topic clearly requires a mathematical guarantee that the resulting system of interacting <b>controller</b> <b>units</b> does indeed solve the underlying complex problem. We will argue that behavioural systems theory represents a neat conceptual framework where this can be achieved...|$|R
50|$|A {{multiple}} {{train control}} system named KATO Digital {{was introduced in the}} late 1980s for HO scale model trains. Conceptually it is similar to Digital Command Control (DCC). Although an important milestone for Kato, KATO Digital was not very successful; both the <b>controller</b> <b>units</b> and the decoder modules required for the locomotives were expensive, and locomotives equipped with a KATO Digital decoder could not be used on conventional systems, making it difficult to run one's locomotives on friends' layouts or club layouts.|$|R
50|$|Massbus {{storage devices}} each contain their own {{autonomous}} <b>controller</b> <b>units,</b> allowing fully overlapped operation of multiple storage units {{connected to a}} single Massbus. The interface between the computer and the Massbus is basically a pass-through device that allows connection of the common Massbus to the individual computer's internal buses (whether PDP-10 memory bus, Unibus, PDP-11/70 cache bus, or VAX Synchronous Backplane Interconnect). Whenever a storage controller has a data transfer ready, it arbitrates {{for the use of}} the Massbus's synchronous data channel.|$|R

50|$|Controllers {{used for}} {{building}} automation can be grouped in three categories: {{programmable logic controllers}} (PLCs), system/network <b>controllers,</b> and terminal <b>unit</b> <b>controllers.</b> However an additional device can also exist in order to integrate third-party systems (e.g. a stand-alone AC system) into a central building automation system.|$|R
40|$|Abstract — ITU-T Rec. H. 32 x {{is still}} the {{predominant}} standards family for video conferencing room systems and multipoint <b>controller</b> <b>units</b> (MCU). Although most MCUs and room systems support SIP as a second signaling protocol some more advanced functionality is available with H. 323 signaling only. Analysis reveals that {{this seems to be}} not due to missing, standardized signaling primitives. Lack of broad support of these features in existing end points and infrastructure components and the fear of potential interoperability issues seem to hinder their adoption...|$|R

5000|$|In {{order to}} ensure {{reliable}} transport, the vacuum sewer line is laid in a saw-tooth (length-) profile, which will be referred to more precisely afterwards. The whole vacuum sewers are filled with air at a pressure of -0.4 to -0.6 bar. The most important aspect for a reliable operation is the air-to-liquid ratio. When a system is well designed, the sewers contain only very small amounts of sewage. The air-to-liquid ratio is usually maintained by [...] "intelligent" [...] <b>controller</b> <b>units</b> or valves that adjust their opening times according to the pressure in the system.|$|R

The GBU-53/B accepts post-release control from either an airborne or ground <b>controller</b> <b>unit</b> to include the ability to receive retargeting and abort commands.|$|E
50|$|The memory {{controller}} is {{a digital}} circuit that manages {{the flow of}} data going {{to and from the}} computer's main memory. A memory controller can be a separate chip or integrated into another chip, such as being placed on the same die or {{as an integral part of}} a microprocessor; in the latter case, it is usually called an integrated memory controller (IMC). A memory controller is sometimes also called a memory chip controller (MCC) or a memory <b>controller</b> <b>unit</b> (MCU).|$|E

40|$|Incorporation {{of radio}} <b>controller</b> <b>units</b> into heavy {{equipment}} {{used in the}} electricity industry provides numerous advantages including: improved electrical isolation between plant and operator, ability to incorporate an additional remote operator, and reductions in vehicle wiring and hydraulic hoses for equipment control. However, secure operation of vehicles and plant incorporating radio control rely on establishing suitable levels of immunity to possible radio frequency interference. Interference levels {{in close proximity to}} high voltage power lines are of special concern to the electricity industry. This paper reports on a preliminary investigation into quantifying the levels of background radio interference at such locations in order to develop required immunity specifications for radio controlled equipment...|$|R
