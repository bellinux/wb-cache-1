40|$|Self-healing <b>cable</b> <b>apparatus</b> {{and methods}} are disclosed. The cable has a central core {{surrounded}} by an adaptive cover that can extend over {{the entire length of}} the cable or just one or more portions of the cable. The adaptive cover includes a protective layer having an initial damage resistance, and a reactive layer. When the cable is subjected to a localized damaging force, the reactive layer responds by creating a corresponding localized self-healed region. The self-healed region provides the cable with enhanced damage resistance as compared to the cable's initial damage resistance. Embodiments of the invention utilize conventional epoxies or foaming materials in the reactive layer that are released to form the self-healed region when the damaging force reaches the reactive layer...|$|E

A tape layer surrounds the C/E layer and is applied so that it surrounds and axially and/or radially compresses the C/E layer. When the self-healing cable is subjected to a damaging force that causes a breach in the outer jacket and the tape layer, the corresponding localized axially and/or radially compressed portion of the C/E foam layer expands into the breach to form a corresponding localized self-healed region.

40|$|Abstract: Inverted {{pendulum}} is {{a classical}} example and a famous tool for testing {{the effectiveness of}} many control schemes. Owing to their nonlinearity and unstable characteristic, a controller development either for swinging-up or stabilizing its upright position had been a great interest of many researchers. In this paper, the swinging-up control of the inverted pendulum using energy control will be presented. However, the saturation function in its control law could harm the experimental equipments. In addition, this swinging-up method did not consider limited sector of the arm angle to avoid another hazard, for instance, the twisted <b>cable</b> in the <b>apparatus.</b> Therefore, in this paper the position control of the arm angle using simple PD control {{in accordance with the}} energy control is proposed. Consequently, the limited arm sector angle can be achieved and the saturation function can also be replaced effectively by the PD control...|$|R

40|$|Partial {{discharge}} (PD) {{measurements are}} universally {{accepted as a}} technique giving some indication {{of the state of}} the insulation in high voltage <b>apparatus.</b> <b>Cable</b> end users are keen to adopt an on-line pd monitoring during commissioning of systems. However, because of noisy environments and the problems of interference the conventional methods are difficult to implement. As a consequence, ultra-high frequency (UHF) / very high frequency (VHF) techniques of on-site detection of partial discharges have been developed. However, to apply the techniques in the field, a thorough understanding of the principle and factors which may affect the signal is essential. This paper presents the principle of VHF partial discharge measurement in cables and cable joints using the capacitive coupler. The frequency response of the coupler has been analysed based on its equivalent circuit and compared with the measured response using the network analyser. The calibration method of the measuring system is also discussed. The discharges in a 66 kV cable and a 132 kV cable containing a joint have been detected using this method. It has been revealed that the minimal discharge detectable is less than 1 pC...|$|R

However, because of noisy environments and the problems of interference the conventional methods are difficult to implement. As a consequence, ultra-high frequency (UHF) / very high frequency (VHF) techniques of on-site detection of partial discharges have been developed. A technique based on the capacitive coupling has received much attention. It has been demonstrated that it is possible to using the technique to monitor the partial discharge in cables, particularly in joints/terminations. However, in order to obtain quantitative information about PD, calibration is required for this technique. Existing calibration methods are difficulty to implement on-site. In this paper a novel method is proposed and compared with the conventional method on a short piece of cable. It has been shown that individual capacitive coupler can also be accurately calibrated on-site and online using the new method, therefore it provides quantitative information about the amount of apparent discharge. In practice this is important for electricity utilities as the quantitative information about PD can be used to determine the quality of cable system and to decide whether the system needs to be repaired or replaced...|$|R

Aromatic polyamide also known as NOMEX(TM) type 410 is widely used for insulation in electric motors and transformers. TEFZEL(TM) resins are widely used to make compact wire and cable construction that provide long and reliable service in demanding environment [1][2]. KAPTON(TM) is an important material in wire and <b>cable</b> insulation. Rotating <b>apparatus,</b> transformers, capacitors, magnetic strips, pressure-sensitive tapes all can benefit by its use, since it maintain its properties {{over a wide range}} of temperature and frequency. PTFE is widely used in military applications and has found applications in industries such as fire alarm, cables, capacitor dielectrics, motor coil, phase and ground insulation, and substrate for flexiible printed circuits. MYLAR(TM) has wide applications in semiconductor manufacturing, electrical power and electronics equipments, and automotive industry. It is commonly used as wire or circuit board insulation, flexible circuits, membrane switches, and coil winding insulation. (Abstract shortened by UMI.) Dept. of Electrical and Computer Engineering.
