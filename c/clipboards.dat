2500|$|Noble had {{not done}} any acting work on TV until the summer of 2013 when he {{appeared}} opposite Ian Smith as a gay lover in the Australian TV series [...] "It's a date", or radio, as he prefers stand-up for giving him the freedom {{to say what he}} wants without being influenced by a script or crew. Nevertheless, he has made many TV appearances, which mainly take the form of interviews and panel game participation. In the UK, he has appeared on BBC's Johnny Vaughan Tonight and Friday Night with Jonathan Ross. Noble has also made 16 appearances, the highest number of appearances of any guest, on BBC One's Have I Got News for You including the first show guest presented by Paul Merton. His most memorable appearance on the show saw him and Paul Merton answer all their questions wrong, and getting no points in the entire show. He was Paul Merton's guest on Room 101, where he wanted to consign to history the likes of Craig David, cartoon animals who wear clothes, people who look like cats, <b>clipboards</b> and [...] Christian rock music. He makes regular contributions to BBC Radio 4's Just a Minute and has also appeared on I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue and presented 4 At The Store. In July 2007, Ross featured, as part of his [...] "In The Company Of...", on the Colin Murray show on BBC Radio 1, and in August 2007 Noble appeared on Steve Wright in the Afternoon on BBC Radio 2.|$|E

50|$|<b>Clipboards</b> can be {{constructed}} {{from a variety of}} material, including but not limited to, aluminum, PVC, polypropylene, High Impact Polystyrene, Foamex and even wood. <b>Clipboards</b> generally come in two different designs—single or folding. Single <b>clipboards</b> are the more traditional type and consist of a single piece of rigid material and some sort of fixing mechanism along the top. Folding <b>clipboards</b> are usually constructed from a single piece of flexible PVC with two rigid materials enclosed within. A folding hinge connects the two sections to allow the front to be folded over the content to provide protection and often to allow some sort of promotional print or instructions. Folding <b>clipboards</b> also provide additional benefits because of the extra space available, allowing the incorporation of pen holders and pockets for storage. The arrival of the microprocessor and Internet age gave rise to high-tech variants of the traditional clipboard, the first being the Ferranti Market Research Terminal that retained a clip, to hold A4 paper sheets (looking like a large clipboard) but recording answers to questions in its electronic memory.|$|E

40|$|Transferring data across {{applications}} is {{a common}} end user task, and copying and pasting via the <b>clipboard</b> lets users do so relatively easily. Using the <b>clipboard,</b> however, can also introduce inefficiencies and errors in user tasks. To help researchers and tool developers understand and address these problems, we studied how end users interact with the <b>clipboard</b> through cut, copy, and paste actions. This study was performed by logging <b>clipboard</b> interactions while end users performed everyday tasks. From the <b>clipboard</b> usage data, we have identified several usage patterns that describe how data is transferred within the desktop environment.
