This study {{investigated}} the model and simulation of dynamic cutting forces for high speed end mills, performed frequency spectrum analysis of dynamic cutting forces, and propounded the model and failure criterion of high speed end mills with indexable inserts. According to results of modal analysis and stress field analysis, the safety prediction and experiment of high speed end mills for machining aluminum alloy were done. Results indicate that more teeth of cutter and greater cutting contact angle make the energy more dispersible, higher cutting speed and greater rake of cutter can depress dynamic cutting forces. The rigidity failure rotational speed is higher the strength failure rotational speed, the connection strength between <b>cutter</b> <b>body</b> and screw bolt affects directly the safety of cutter.

40|$|Large {{improvements}} in cutting tool design and technology, including {{the application of}} advanced surface engineering treatments on the cemented carbide insert, have been achieved in the last decades to enhance tool performance. However, the problem of improving the tool body material is not adequately studied. Fatigue {{is the most common}} failure mechanism in cutting tool bodies. Rotating tools, tool {{going in and out of}} cutting engagement, impose dynamic stresses and require adequate fatigue strength of the tool. Working temperatures of milling cutter bodies in the insert pocket can reach up to 600 °C depending on the cutting conditions and material of the workpiece. As a result, steel for this application shall have good hot properties such as high temper resistance and high hot hardness values to avoid plastic deformation in the insert pocket of the cutting tool. Machinability of the steel is also essential, as machining of steel represents a large fraction of the production cost of a milling cutter. This thesis focus on the improvement of the cutting tool performance by the use of steel grades for tool bodies with optimized combination of fatigue strength, machinability and properties at elevated temperatures. The first step was to indentify the certain limit of the sulphur addition for improved machinability which is allowable without reducing the fatigue strength of the milling <b>cutter</b> <b>body</b> below an acceptable level. The combined effect of inclusions, surface condition and geometrical stress concentrator on the fatigue life of the tool steel in smooth specimens and in tool components were studied in bending fatigue. As the fatigue performance of the tools to a large extent depends on the stress relaxation resistance at elevated temperature use, the second step in this research was to investigate the stress relaxation of the commonly used milling <b>cutter</b> <b>body</b> materials and a newly steel developed within the project. Compressive residual stresses were induced by shot peening and their response to mechanical and thermal loading as well as the material substructures and their dislocation characteristics were studied using X-ray diffraction. Softening resistance of two hot work tool steels and a newly developed steel was investigated during high temperature hold times and isothermal fatigue and discussed of with respect to their microstructure. Carbide morphology and precipitation as well as dislocation structure were determined using transmission electron microscopy and X-ray line broadening analysis...|$|E

The <b>cutter</b> <b>body</b> comprises a substrate body (3), {{and a thin}} coating lamella (4) applied on a free surface side of the substrate body, where the substrate body has a lower wear resistance than the coating lamella. The coating lamella forms a cutting edge (2) having two cutting edge faces (5, 6) facing on each other at the cutting edge during cutting of a cutting product by an abrasion of the substrate body. The coating lamella comprises a nano-structured layer system with chemical composition changing over a layer thickness, and layer regions of different hardness, where hard-brittle layer regions and visco-elastic layer regions are alternatively arranged in the layer system. A relative mass portion of a first layer component with high hardness and/or a second layer component with low hardness in the layer system periodically alters over the layer thickness of the layer system. A gradation of the chemical composition of the layer system is provided with a continuous change over the layer thickness of the layer system of the relative mass portion of the first and/or second layer components. A maximum hardness of the hard-brittle layer region is 25 - 35 GPa. A maximum hardness of the visco-elastic region is 20 - 30 GPa. The hardness of the hard-brittle layer region starting from a maximum value in direction of adjacent visco-elastic layer regions is decreased. The hardness of the visco-elastic layer region starting from the minimum value in direction of adjacent hard-brittle layer regions is increased, where a continuous hardness transition is provided between the hard-brittle layer regions and the visco-elastic layer regions. A distance between two closest hard-brittle layer regions is 350 - 400 nm. The layer system is obtainable by a plasma assisted chemical vapor deposition process. The layer system is a titanium diboride-titanium nitride (TiB 2 -TiN) -layer system with TiB 2 as the first layer component and TiN as the second layer component.

40|$|The work {{reported}} herein is {{a continuation}} of the program initiated under DOE contract E(10 - 1) - 1546 * entitled "Program to Design and Experimentally Test an Improved Geothermal Bit"; the program is now DOE Contract EG- 76 -C- 1546 *. The objective of the program has been to accelerate the commercial availability of a tolling cutter drill bit for geothermal applications. Data and experimental tests needed to develop a bit suited to the harsh thermal, abrasive, and chemical environment of the more problematic geothermal wells, including those drilled with air, have been obtained. Efforts were directed at the improvement of both the sealed (lubricated) and unsealed types of bits. The unsealed bit effort included determination of the rationale for materials selection, the selection of steels for the bit <b>body,</b> <b>cutters,</b> and bearings, the selection of tungsten carbide alloys for the friction bearing, and preliminary investigation of optimized tungsten carbide drilling inserts. Bits build** with the new materials were tested under stimulated wellbore conditions. The sealed bit effort provided for the evaluation of candidate high temperature seals and lubricants, utilizing two specially developed test apparatus which simulate the conditions found in a sealed bit operating in a geothermal wellbore. Phase I of the program was devoted largely to (1) the study of the geothermal environment and the failure mechanisms of existing geothermal drill bits, (2) the design and construction of separate facilities for testing both drill-bit seals and full-scale drill bits under simulated geothermal drilling conditions, and (3) fabrication of the MK-I research drill bits from high-temperature steels, and testing in the geothermal drill-bit test facility. The work accomplished in Phase I is reported in References 1 through 9. In Phase II, the first generation experimental bits were tested in the geothermal drill-bit test facility. Test results indicated that hardness retention at temperature, but not at the expense of fracture toughness, was a primary requirement for geothermal bit bearings. Materials selections for the MK-II bit were made based on these results. Also in Phase II, effort was directed at the screening of elastomers for use as a high-temperature seal for sealed bits. References 10 though 13 report the work performed in Phase II. This report summarizes the work on Phase III, encompassing the period from May 18, 1977, to May 19, 1978. There were two major tasks in Phase III which consisted of material selection, fabrication and testing of MK-III bits and Seal and lubricant evaluation. [DJE - 2005...|$|R

In the present study, the different aspects associated with the steel properties as related to the milling <b>cutter</b> <b>body</b> application are reviewed. The working performance of a tool holder depends in particular on the fatigue strength, high temperature properties and machinability of the tool steel used. Rotating tools, tool {{going in and out}} of cutting engagement, impose dynamic stresses and require adequate fatigue strength off the tool. Different publications, as well as internal investigation at Uddeholm Tooling AB show that the working temperatures of milling cutter bodies in the insert pocket vary from 300 to 600 degrees Celsius depending on the cutting conditions and material of the workpiece. As a result, steel for this application needs good hot properties such as high temper resistance, high hot hardness values, etc. Machinability is also essential as machining of steel represents a large fraction of the production cost of a milling cutter. Its complex shape with flutes and insert pockets as well as small thread holes and small deep holes for cooling channels require time consuming and advanced machining operations. The essential properties mentioned above were characterized with the emphasis to the steel type, its microstructure and purity, processing and surface treatment and strong interrelations between them...|$|E
