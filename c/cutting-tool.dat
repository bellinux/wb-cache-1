40|$|Nowadays, the {{miniaturization}} of many {{consumer products}} is extending {{the use of}} micro-milling operations with high-quality requirements. However, the impacts of <b>cutting-tool</b> wear on part dimensions, form and surface integrity are not negligible and part quality assurance for a minimum production cost is a challenging task. In fact, industrial practices usually set conservative cutting parameters and early cutting replacement policies {{in order to minimize}} the impact of <b>cutting-tool</b> wear on part quality. Although these practices may ensure part integrity, the production cost is far away to be minimized, especially in highly tool-consuming operations like mold and die micro-manufacturing. In this paper, an adaptive control optimization (ACO) system is proposed to estimate <b>cutting-tool</b> wear in terms of part quality and adapt the cutting conditions accordingly in order to minimize the production cost, ensuring quality specifications in hardened steel micro-parts. The ACO system is based on: (1) a monitoring sensor system composed of a dynamometer, (2) an estimation module with Artificial Neural Networks models, (3) an optimization module with evolutionary optimization algorithms, and (4) a CNC interface module. In order to operate in a nearly real-time basis and facilitate the implementation of the ACO system, different evolutionary optimization algorithms are evaluated such as particle swarm optimization (PSO), genetic algorithms (GA), and simulated annealing (SA) in terms of accuracy, precision, and robustness. The results for a given micro-milling operation showed that PSO algorithm performs better than GA and SA algorithms under computing time constraints.

40|$|AbstractThe high {{precision}} requirements of complex mechanical product (CMP) results in that its processing often contains multiple stages. When part was processed and transmitted in multiple stages, dimensional variation of part will be accumulated, coupling and transformed as well. Since the {{high precision}} {{requirements of the}} CMP, there are more process parameters impacted the machining errors than general multistage process, and more diverse process parameters {{should be considered in}} CMP's processing. To describe machining variation propagation process accurately and effectively, the variation propagation model for CMP processing was proposed. Firstly, the parts and fixtures in CMP processing are described by differential motion vector based on the robot's kinematics principle, and the change of theirs space pose are obtained by homogeneous transformation. Then, the fixture-induced variation, datum-induced variation, machining-induced variation and <b>cutting-tool</b> wear induced variation are analyzed and derived. The machining-induced variation is the dimension deviation produced by cutting force impacting on part's machining surfaces, and the <b>cutting-tool</b> wear induced variation is mainly caused by tool's normal wear. Lastly, the coupling relationship of datum-induced variation, fixture-induced variation, machining-induced variation and <b>cutting-tool</b> wear induced variation of each process stage is described, and the state space model of variation propagation is developed. The relationship of dimensional variation from all work stages and all kinds of variations is explored. By a real case study, feasibility and effectiveness of the model is validated.

40|$|The last {{hundred years}} have been full of {{scientific}} discoveries leading to technological advances, such as, computers, smart phones, etc. Most of the advances {{would not have been}} possible without new discoveries within the vast field of materials science. The specific area within materials science covered in this thesis is multicomponent nitride alloys, which are commonly used as thin films in industrial applications, e. g., as hard wear-resistant coatings for <b>cutting-tools</b> or as part of intricate electronic components in mobile telecommunication devices. The core of this thesis is towards the fundamental understanding of existing, and the discovery of new, nitride alloys using theoretical tools. Knowledge about the quantum mechanics of the alloys was gained using density functional theory, alloy theory, and thermodynamics investigating piezoelectricity, phase stability, and surface diffusion. The focus of the piezoelectricity research is on piezoelectric properties of both ordered and disordered nitrides. The exploration of disordered wurtzite nitrides revealed important aspects of the nitride alloying physics and the implications for their piezoelectric response, in addition to the discovery of interesting alloy candidates and their synthesis, e. g., YxIn 1 -xN. For the ordered nitrides, novel TMZnN 2 (TM = Ti, Zr, Hf) structures with high piezoelectric responses have been predicted as stable. The focus of the piezoelectricity research is on piezoelectric properties of both ordered and disordered nitrides. The exploration of disordered wurtzite nitrides revealed important aspects of the nitride alloying physics and the implications for their piezoelectric response, in addition to the discovery of interesting alloy candidates and their synthesis, e. g., YxIn 1 -xN. For the ordered nitrides, novel TMZnN 2 (TM = Ti, Zr, Hf) structures with high piezoelectric responses have been predicted as stable. The thermodynamic stability of novel alloys with interesting properties is investigated in order to determine if equilibrium or non-equilibrium synthesis is feasible. The studies consist of ternary phase diagrams of TM-Zn-N, mixing enthalpies for disordered YxAl 1 -xN and YxIn 1 -xN that can be used to predict possible synthesis routes and guide experiments. In addition, mixing enthalpies for strained ScxAl 1 -xN/InyAl 1 -yN superlattices show that the stability of certain phases and, therefore, the crystalline quality can be improved by modifying in-plane lattice parameters through higher indium content in the InAlN layers. Surface diffusion is studied because it is an important factor during thin film growth with, for example, physical vapor deposition. It is the main atomic transport mechanism and, thus, governs the structure development of thin films. Specifically, the research is focused on diffusion on the surfaces of disordered alloys, and in particular Ti, Al, and N adatom diffusion on TiN and TiAlN surfaces. The investigations revealed that Ti adatom mobilities are dramatically reduced in the presence of Al in the surface layer on the TiN and Ti 0. 5 Al 0. 5 N(0 0 1) surfaces, while Al adatoms are largely unaffected. Furthermore, the reverse effect is found on the TiN(1 1 1) surface, Al adatom migration is reduced while Ti adatom migration is unaffected. In addition, it is shown that neglecting the magnetic spin polarization of Ti adatoms will locally underestimate the binding energies and the diffusion path, e. g., underestimating the stability of TiN(0 0 1) bulk sites...|$|R

40|$|Application of {{mechanical}} micromachining for fabricating complex three-dimensional (3 D) micro-scale features and small parts {{on a broad}} range of materials has increased significantly in the recent years. In particular, mechanical micromachining finds applications in manufacturing of biomedical devices, tribological surfaces, energy storage/conversion systems, and aerospace components. Effectively addressing the dual requirements for high accuracy and high throughput for micromachining applications necessitates understanding and controlling of dynamic behavior of micromachining system, including positioning stage, spindle, and the (micro-) tool, as well as their coupling with the mechanics of the material removal process. The dynamic behavior of the tool-collet-spindle-machine assembly, as reflected at the cutting edges of a micro-tool, often determines the achievable process productivity and quality. However, the common modeling techniques (such as beam based approaches) used in macro-scale to model the dynamics of cutting tools, cannot be used to accurately and efficiently in micro-scale case. Furthermore, classical modal testing techniques poses significant challenges in terms of excitation and measurement requirements, and thus, new experimental techniques are needed to determine the speed-dependent modal characteristics of miniature ultra-high-speed (UHS) spindles that are used during micromachining. The overarching objective of this thesis is to address the aforementioned issues by developing new modeling and experimental techniques to accurately predict and analyze the dynamics of micro-scale cutting tools and miniature ultra-high-speed spindles, including rotational effects arising from the ultra high rotational speeds utilized during micromachining, which are central to understanding the process stability. Accurate prediction of the dynamics of micromachining requires (1) accurate and numerically-efficient analytical approach to model the rotational dynamics of realistic micro-tool geometries that will capture non-symmetric bending and coupled torsional/axial dynamics including the rotational/ gyroscopic effects; and (2) new experimental approaches to accurately determine the speed-dependent dynamics of ultra-high-speed spindles. The dynamic models of cutting tools and ultra-high-speed spindles developed in this work can be coupled together with a mechanistic micromachining model to investigate the process stability {{of mechanical}} micromachining. To achieve the overarching research objective,first, a new three-dimensional spectral- Tchebychev approach is developed to accurately and efficiently predict the dynamics of (micro) cutting tools. In modeling the cutting tools, considering the efficiently and accuracy of the solution, a unified modeling approach is used. In this approach, the shank/taper/extension sections, vibrational behavior of which exhibit no coupling between different textural motion, of the cutting tools are modeled using one-dimensional (1 D) spectral-Tchebychev (ST) approach; whereas the fluted section (that exhibits coupled vibrational behavior) is modeled using the developed 3 D-ST approach. To obtain the dynamic model for the entire cutting tool, a component mode synthesis approach is used to `assemble 2 ̆ 7 the dynamic models. Due to the high rotational speeds needed to attain high material removal rate while using micro tools, the gyroscopic/rotational effects should be included in predicting the dynamic response at any position along the cutting edges of a micro-tool during its operation. Thus, as a second step, the developed solution approach is improved to include the effects arising from the high rotational speeds. The convergence, accuracy, and efficiency of the presented solution technique is investigated through several case studies. It is shown that the presented modeling approach enables high-fidelity dynamic models for (micro-scale) <b>cutting-tools.</b> Third, to accurately model the dynamics of miniature UHS spindles, that critically affect the tool-tip motions, a new experimental (modal testing) methodology is developed. To address the deficiency of traditional dynamic excitation techniques in providing the required bandwidth, repeatability, and impact force magnitudes for accurately capturing the dynamics of rotating UHS spindles, a new impact excitation system (IES) is designed and constructed. The developed system enables repeatable and high-bandwidth modal testing of (miniature and compliant) structures, while controlling the applied impact forces on the structure. Having developed the IES, and established the experimental methodology, the speed-dependent dynamics of an air bearing miniature spindle is characterized. Finally, to show the broad impact of the develop modeling approach, a macro-scale endmill is modeled using the presented modeling technique and coupled to the dynamics of a (macro-scale) spindle, that is obtained experimentally, to predict the tool-point dynamics. Specific contributions of this thesis research include: (1) a new 3 D modeling approach that can accurately and efficiently capture the dynamics of pretwisted structures including gyroscopic effects, (2) a novel IES for repeatable, high-bandwidth modal testing of miniature and compliant structures, (3) an experimental methodology to characterize and understand the (speed-dependent) dynamics of miniature UHS spindles...|$|R

However, {{there is a lack}} of incorporation of other factors that lead to increase of manufacturing cost and degrade of product quality, such as <b>cutting-tool</b> wear and machine-tool thermal state.

Burrs are undesirable because they present a hazard in handling machined parts and can interfere with subsequent assembly operations From the simulation point of view, most modeling efforts remain with 2 -D orthogonal cutting and describe only steady-state cutting. The importance of final state of cutting, tool exit, which creates burrs and other edge defects has been largely ignored. The Finite Element Method has been successfully applied in the last years and a new a days MOlecular Dynamics simulations of nanometric cutting where conducted under different cutting conditions to investigate burr formation and exit failure in metals. Several analytical approaches were attempted but were still based on experimental observation mixing theory of plasticity and geometrical Description of burr formation. The lack of precise material models describing material behavior under high strain rate and included size effects blocked further pursuit of analytical modeling of burr formation with theory of plasticity and pushed it in the direction of geometrical conformation theory with energy balance. So, the paper will consider the state-of-the-art in burr modeling and simulation at first from the theoretical point-of-view, starting with numerical models and coming up to analytical models. In the second main part, new trends will be pointed out - e. g. burr simulation in multilayered materials, crack initiation implementation, the "hydrostatic bowl" formulation, <b>cutting-tool</b> (geometry and dynamics) and friction influence and finally some aspects to consider size effects in process scaling to improve burr formation models. Finally aspects of measuring technique to verify the theoretical models will be pointed out...|$|E

Na konkrétním příkladě výroby ozubení odvalovacím způsobem je uveden nový nestandardní přístup v řešení řezného nástroje s cílem dosažení min. výrobních nákladů. Hlavními aktivačními faktory tohoto přístupu v řešení jsou: - stále doznívající vliv celosvětové ekonomické a finanční krize; - trvalé zkracování termínů realizace dodávek (tj. především výrobní etapy); - minimalizace režijních nákladů na zakázkách, tzn. i u řezných nástrojů; - jednoduchost-spolehlivost-operativnost-dostupnost-univerzálnost-efektivnost řešení. S ohledem na novou vysoce legovanou RO-PM se podařilo efektivní obrábění výkovků z ocele 18 CrNiMo 7, přičemž řezný nástroj (OF) byl bez povrchové úpravy (TV) a dosáhl min. srovnatelného výkonu při podstatně nižších vlastních nákladech, při zkrácení výrobního cyklu. The {{permanent}} {{raising of}} <b>cutting-tool</b> productivity with synchronous degrading effects of material machinability predicts {{the importance of}} achievement of high qualitative requirements on cutting life. The tool performance is so affected by many {{various factors such as}} edge resistance to plastic deformation, thermal load, microbuilt-up edges…., as well as by abrasive qualities, mechanical properties and inhomogeneity of machined materials or edge hardness. The leading manufacturers of high alloyed high-speed steels try therefore to develop new metallurgic technologies, to introduce new materials warranting the essential raising of cutting power in comparison with the present quality of HSS. The development in the branche of cutting tools is pointed to increasing of tool-performance, reliability, cutting life and stability of cutting edge including its good grindability. In recent years, the introducing of PM-steels produced by powder metallurgy technology i. e. by crystallisation in inert gas (N 2, Ar 2) evocates an essential improvement. The cutting tools manufactured by means of powder metallurgy are significantly more tough than conventional highspeed steels, thus the length of cutting edges may be essentially greater. The mentioned technology facilitates simultaneously a richer alloying so that the tool is quite tough by greater hardness (62 - 65 HRC). The tools have additional advantages: enhanced cutting power – abrasion and wear resistance, possibility to machine assorted qualities and sorts of materials, excellent grindability – surface integrity (due to the fine-grained structure) and therefore to the triple cutting edge life. The up-to-date developing quality of PM-HSS was applicated on the concrete tool - hob m= 6 and it facilitates not only to increase the cutting speed and the cutting life but also proves by its properties to substitute the thin PVD coatings, frequently used for the surface finish of tools. In this manner, the process of manufacture is essentialy cut down, costs are saved both for PVD deposition and for related resharpening and subsequent coating of tools...|$|E
