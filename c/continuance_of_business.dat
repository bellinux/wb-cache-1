40|$|Purpose The study {{considers}} the overall {{impact of the}} service encounters and projects undertaken on the long-term relationship between the agency and its clients. Design/methodology/approach The study employs a parallel mixed method design incorporating quantitative and qualitative elements in the client-advertising agency context. Data obtain via an online survey in Study 1 was analysed using structural equation modeling and bias-corrected bootstrapping technique. Study 2 featured 15 in-depth interviews with marketing managers and project leaders. Findings The findings revealed that advertising agencies deliver value and create trust through creativity aspects as well as project management processes. In addition, both perceived value and trust have crucial roles in fostering client-agency relationships and the <b>continuance</b> <b>of</b> <b>business</b> relationships. Value has a stronger direct effect on loyalty when compared with trust, confirmed {{by the results of}} Study 2. Several respondents pointed out the influence of client characteristics on both evaluation of creativity as well as loyalty. Practical implications The results highlight the importance of project management and planning which should be seen as an investment by both parties. Moreover, agencies need to involve clients in the creative process and focus on marketing themselves and the value they add to enhance client loyalty. Originality/value This study was the first to develop a model for the drivers of loyalty, drawing from literature in three key areas: service quality, relationship marketing and project management. An additional contribution of the study stems from the incorporation of an integrated parallel mixed methods approach...|$|E

50|$|Samuel Ledgard's estate totalled £129,491. As {{the company}} was still owned by him, it formed part of his {{personal}} assets. The then, punitive death duties amounted to £29,883, which threatened the <b>continuance</b> <b>of</b> the <b>business</b> and meant that, when looking to update the fleet, the executors had {{to look to the}} second-hand market. This strategy resulted a wide range of vehicles from various manufacturers entering service, including buses from: AEC, Albion, Bristol, Daimler and Leyland. A significant influx was 23 ex London Transport Executive 'austerity' Daimler CWA6's with Park Royal bodywork in 1953/54, 22 of which went into service unmodified, save for platform doors being fitted. They gave stirling service until the last one was withdrawn in 1962. However, one notable exception to the second-hand purchases, was six new AEC Regent V buses with Roe bodywork which were delivered in 1957. One of these buses was registered 1949U - a reversal of the registration on Samuel's first petrol lorry, in 1912.|$|R

However, the activity to distribute the credit takes a risk which can influence health and <b>continuance</b> <b>of</b> bank <b>business.</b> The credit risk which potentially occurs can be measured and controlled by analyzing directly whichever the credit client categorized to. The credit risk categorized to current credit, in specific concern credit, less current credit, doubtful credit and bad credit based on Bank Indonesia Regulation No. : 7 / 2 /PBI/ 2005. The independent variables used in this research are nominal credit, principal balance, in time being bank client, time period, and bank interest. Fisher multiple discriminant analysis is a method whose assumption equality of covariance matrices. The result from using the Fisher multiple discriminant analysis in data of credit client from bank “X” in Pati shows that variable principal balance, in time being bank client, time period, and bank interest significant to measure credit risk.

Discriminant analysis is a multivariate statistical technique {{which can be used}} to classify the new observation into a specific group. Kernel discriminant analysis is a non-parametric method which is flexible because it does not have to concern about assumption from certain distribution and equal variance matrices as in parametric discriminant analysis. The classification using the kernel discriminant analysis with the normal kernel function with optimum bandwidth 0, 1 in data of credit client from bank “X” in Lampung Province gives accurate classififcation 92 % whereas kernel discriminant analysis with the epanechnikov function with the optimum bandwidth 4, 6 gives the accurate classification 79 %...|$|R

For this aim in {{this research}} a scale prepared for researchers with 55 articles named “social capital levels in hotel managements” and again a scale to measure the job satisfaction of employees in accommodation services with 36 questions are used. The scale with 55 articles mentioned above is composed of five sections with titles of; organizational commitment, communication-social interaction, collaboration-social networks and participation, confidence, tolerance towards differences and sharing the norms. At the end of the research it has been found out that there is a positive relation between job satisfaction and social capital except for the aspects of tolerance towards differences and sharing the norms.
