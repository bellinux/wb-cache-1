50|$|In {{the early}} 20th century {{there was concern}} for the {{survival}} of the <b>Caribbean</b> <b>flamingo.</b> The National Audubon Society of the United States urged the Bahamas government to protect the flamingos, which led to passage of the Wildbirds (Protection) Act in 1905.|$|E
5000|$|Island Life: {{representative}} {{species from}} around the world including Galápagos tortoises, <b>Caribbean</b> <b>flamingos,</b> Abaco Island boas, San Esteban Island chuckwalla lizards, as well as a herpetarium with over 80 exhibits.|$|R
5000|$|Flocks of Chilean and <b>Caribbean</b> <b>flamingos</b> live {{in shallow}} water {{alongside}} a large island housing a group of ring-tailed lemurs and red-fronted lemurs. New indoor accommodation for the flamingos was completed in 2007.|$|R
50|$|The {{park has}} an interpretative centre, a walkway through a Bagá forest, a Taíno village and fauna {{exhibits}} (crocodiles, iguanas, flamingos and Cuban hutias). The archipelago {{is a natural}} habitat for <b>Caribbean</b> <b>flamingos</b> (Phoenicopterus ruber).|$|R
50|$|The aviary {{contains}} over 60 {{species in}} a walk-through building. One section is a cage-less room where birds fly free. Species {{in the exhibit}} include the <b>Caribbean</b> <b>flamingo,</b> scarlet ibis, rhinoceros hornbill, Bali mynah, king vulture, rockhopper penguin, Gentoo penguin, the whooping crane and sunbittern, as well as various pigeons and herons.|$|E

50|$|The zoo is {{involved}} in breeding a number of endangered species including black rhino, leopard, golden lion tamarin, dama gazelle, Attwater's prairie chicken, black mangabey, African lion, black-footed ferret, Komodo dragon, Andean condor, and <b>Caribbean</b> <b>flamingos.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Bahamas {{national}} park system protects many unique features, critical habitats and endangered species. Highlights include the world's largest breeding colony of <b>Caribbean</b> <b>flamingos,</b> miles of underwater cave {{systems and the}} first no-take marine reserves in the wider Caribbean.|$|R
25|$|Flocks of Chilean and <b>Caribbean</b> <b>flamingos</b> live {{in shallow}} water {{alongside}} a large island housing a group of ring-tailed lemurs {{and a pair of}} black and white ruffed lemurs. The lemurs are to be moved to a new Madagascar themed walk through enclosure in 2018 along with Fossa. New indoor accommodation for the flamingos was completed in 2007.|$|R
50|$|The plumage is pinker {{than the}} {{slightly}} larger greater flamingo, but less so than <b>Caribbean</b> <b>flamingo.</b> It can be differentiated from these species by its greyish legs with pink joints (tibio-tarsal articulation), {{and also by}} the larger amount of black on the bill (more than half). Young chicks may have no sign of pink coloring whatsoever, but instead remain grey.|$|E
50|$|Bonaire is also {{famed for}} its {{flamingo}} populations and its donkey sanctuary. Flamingos {{are drawn to}} the brackish water of the island's lagoons, which harbours the shrimp upon which they feed. Bonaire is home to one of only four nesting grounds for the <b>Caribbean</b> <b>flamingo.</b> Located in the Pekelmeer {{in the southern part of}} the island, no human entry is permitted in this sanctuary. In the 16th century, Europeans introduced sheep, goats, pigs, horses and donkeys on Bonaire, and the descendants of the donkeys, goats, and pigs roam the island today.|$|E
50|$|The American {{flamingo}} (Phoenicopterus ruber) {{is a large}} {{species of}} flamingo {{closely related to the}} greater flamingo and Chilean flamingo. It was formerly considered conspecific with the greater flamingo, but that treatment is now widely viewed (e.g. by the American and British Ornithologists' Unions) as incorrect {{due to a lack of}} evidence. It is also known as the <b>Caribbean</b> <b>flamingo</b> although it is present in the Galápagos Islands. In Cuba it is also known as the greater flamingo. It is the only flamingo that naturally inhabits North America.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Caribbean</b> Pink <b>Flamingos</b> exhibit shows {{flamingos}} in {{a natural}} outdoor lake setting.|$|R
50|$|Other {{species in}} the zoo's {{collection}} that {{are not part of}} a themed exhibit include Amur tigers, blesbok, Thomson's gazelle, Oriental small-clawed otters, red pandas, gemsbok, sloth bears, meerkats, Impalas, ostriches, reticulated giraffes, southern white rhinoceros, onager, Przewalski's wild horses, common chimpanzees, egrets, <b>Caribbean</b> <b>flamingos,</b> rockhopper penguins, Grévy's zebra, bongo, roan antelope, common hippopotamus, scimitar-horned oryx, Waterbuck, African penguin and ring-tailed lemurs.|$|R
50|$|The bird yard is {{the first}} thing {{visitors}} of the zoo see after they leave the visitor center. The bird yard contains a large pool, waterfall, and a mill house with a water wheel. The exhibit has large rocks separating the birds from two large galapagos tortoises. Animals in the exhibit include <b>Caribbean</b> <b>flamingos,</b> Chilean flamingos, Galapagos tortoises, mallard ducks, red-breasted geese, ruddy ducks, common shelducks, swan geese, and white-faced whistling ducks.|$|R
50|$|Scientists {{say that}} Guana has more {{flora and fauna}} than any island of its size yet studied in the Caribbean and {{possibly}} the world. The restoration program has brought extirpated species back to Guana and other Virgin Islands. The stout iguana had survived only on Anegada but now flourishes on Guana and lives on other islands as well. Other {{plant and animal species}} that have been restored and protected include the red-legged tortoise, the bridled quail-dove, the <b>Caribbean</b> <b>flamingo,</b> the white-crowned pigeon, Eggers' mallow tree, the Virgin Islands euphorb, Hohenberg's ground bromeliad, and a unique bromeliad found nowhere else.|$|E
5000|$|Another {{attraction}} {{was a large}} wired enclosure, {{within which}} unwanted pet rabbits (and tortoises, guinea pigs etc.,) were given a new home. This inevitably led to it getting the nickname 'Bunny Park', which is still how some locals refer to it today. Later, the animal collection became more exotic as it began to receive and house imported animals that remained unclaimed after their period of compulsory quarantine had expired. Better enclosures were built and it {{has now become a}} small zoo and is a recognized member of the British and Irish Association of Zoos and Aquariums (BIAZA). As of April 2016,the animal centre has since been renamed Hanwell Zoo,and is home to such animals as Mara (mammal), Capybara, Meerkats, <b>Caribbean</b> <b>Flamingo</b> and Crested Porcupine,and will soon be home to Emperor Tamarin monkeys and Ring-tailed Lemur ...|$|E
40|$|Unambiguous gender {{identification}} (ID) {{is needed}} to assess parameters in studies of population dynamics, behavior, and evolutionary biology of <b>Caribbean</b> <b>Flamingo</b> (Phoenicopterus ruber ruber) and other birds. Due to its importance for management and conservation, molecular (DNA-based) avian gender ID assays targeting intron-size differences of the Chromosome Helicase ATPase DNA Binding (CHD) gene of males (CHD-Z) and females (CHD-W) have been developed. Male (ZZ) and female (WZ) genotypes are usually scored as size polymorphisms through agarose or acrylamide gels. For certain species, W-specific restriction sites or multiplex polymerase chain-reaction (PCR) involving CHD-W specific primers are needed. These approaches involve {{a minimum of three}} steps following DNA isolation: PCR, gel electrophoresis, and photo-documentation, which limit high throughput scoring and automation potential. In here, a short amplicon (SA) High-resolution Melting Analysis (HRMA) assay for avian gender ID is developed. SA-HRMA of an 81 -Base Pair (bp) segment differentiates heteroduplex female (WZ) from homoduplex male (ZZ) genotypes by targeting Single-nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) instead of intron-size differences between CHD-Z and CHD-W genes. To demonstrate the utility of the approach, the gender of <b>Caribbean</b> <b>Flamingo</b> (P. ruber ruber) (17 captive from the Dallas Zoo and 359 wild from Ria Lagartos, Yucatan, Mexico) was determined. The assay was also tested on specimens of Lesser Flamingo (P. minor), Chilean Flamingo (P. chilensis), Saddle-billed Stork (Ephippiorhynchus senegalensis), Scarlet Ibis (Eudocimus ruber), White-bellied Stork (Ciconia abdimii), Roseate Spoonbill (Platalea ajaja), Marabou Stork (Leptoptilos crumeniferus), Greater Roadrunner (Geococcyx californianus), and Attwater's Prairie Chicken (Tympanuchus cupido attwateri). Although the orthologous 81 bp segments of Z and W are highly conserved, sequence alignments with 50 avian species across 15 families revealed mismatches affecting one or more nucleotides within the SA-HRMA forward or reverse primers. Most mismatches were located along the CHD-Z gene that may generate heteroduplex curves and thus gender ID errors. For such cases, taxon and species-specific primer sets were designed. The SA-HRMA gender ID assay can be used in studies of avian ecology and behavior, to assess sex-associated demographics and migratory patterns, and as a proxy to determine the health of the flock and the degree by which conservation and captive breeding programs are functioning...|$|E
50|$|In {{the early}} 1950s, Audubon expert Robert Porter Allen scoured the <b>Caribbean</b> searching for <b>flamingos.</b> In his popular book, On the Trail of Vanishing Birds, Allen {{found that the}} colonies {{on the island of}} Andros in the Bahamas had already disappeared. He {{determined}} that the largest surviving group of <b>Caribbean</b> <b>flamingos</b> inhabited the isolated back-waters of Lake Rosa on Inagua. That is where Allen and the Audubon Society decided to make a stand. A group of influential backers was recruited in Nassau to form a Society for the Protection of the Flamingo, with Arthur Vernay as its leader. Two wardens were hired on Inagua, brothers Samuel and James Nixon, and Audubon helped finance the entire operation.|$|R
40|$|Lateralization {{is defined}} as a {{behavior}} or mental process displayed by an animal {{in which there is a}} distinctive side preference. <b>Caribbean</b> <b>flamingos</b> have been shown to display lateralization in neck resting behavior (Anderson, Williams, & O‟Brien, 2009), and relationships between this side preference and aggression (Anderson, Williams, & Bono, 2010) and pair-bonding (Williams & Anderson, 2012) have been previously found. The present study investigated whether <b>Caribbean</b> <b>flamingos</b> display lateral behavioral preferences in foot scratching and two types of stamp-feeding behavior, and examined the relationship, if any, between these lateral behaviors and both pair-bonding and aggression. Four of the birds displayed an individual-level lateral preference on one of the two feeding behaviors. Foot scratching preference was related to age such that older birds tended to utilize the right foot more for scratching. Results also suggested that birds who scratch with the left foot are more likely to be involved in, to be targeted in, and to lose fights, suggesting that lateral foot usage during scratching may be somehow related to social behaviors in this species, but as significant lateral scratching preferences were not found, such results must be viewed with caution. The lateral feeding behaviors did not appear to be significantly related to social cohesion...|$|R
50|$|Anegada is {{also known}} for the large salt ponds that cover much of {{the west end of}} the island, These ponds, which support unique fauna, were {{designated}} a Ramsar Site on 11 May 1999. In the 1830s, thousands of <b>Caribbean</b> <b>flamingos</b> lived in these ponds, but they were hunted for food and feathers throughout the 19th and early 20th centuries and disappeared by 1950. They have been reestablished. As of 2016, the flamingo flock numbers approximately 200 birds. The birds are another tourist draw, but officials are trying to keep the number of visitors to the flamingo areas at a level that allows the birds to flourish.|$|R
40|$|Methods to {{determine}} genetic diversity and relatedness within populations are essential tools for proper wildlife management. Today {{the approach of}} choice is polymerase chain reaction-based microsatellite analysis. Seven new polymorphic loci were isolated from a microsatellite-enriched <b>Caribbean</b> <b>flamingo</b> genomic library and used to characterize survey populations of Caribbean and African greater flamingos. In addition, four of these loci were used to verify parentage relationships within a captive-breeding population of African greater flamingos. Parentage predictions based upon gamekeeper observations of breeding and nesting did not always agree with genetic-based parentage analyses of the nine suggested family groups. Four family groups were supported (groups I, II, III and VI) by there results. However, {{an analysis of the}} remaining five suggested groups, with a total of eight offspring/dam and eight offspring/sire suggested relationships, yielded seven exclusions of the suggested dam and six exclusions of the suggested sire. This put the overall suggested dam exclusion rate at 35 % and exclusion rate for suggested sires at 29 %. Although the keeper observation data for our family groups must be considered a variable of concern at this time, these findings are certainly suggestive that more carefully controlled studies may reveal that flamingos are not monogamous as long accepted, but rather socially monogamous or even promiscuous. Thus we have now been able to both characterize and demonstrate the utility of our polymorphic microsatellite loci. We hope these results will interest additional wildlife facilities in further parentage and behavioral studies that will collectively aid to improve monitoring and maintenance of genetic diversity, and as provide better insight into breeding habits of both wild and captive populations...|$|E
40|$|Flamingo species {{generate}} tremendous interest {{whether they}} are small captive groups or wild populations numbering in the thousands. Genetic pedigrees are invaluable for maintaining maximum genetic diversity in captive, as well as wild, populations. However, presently {{there is a general}} lack of genetic data for flamingo populations. Microsatellites are loci composed of 2 - 6 base pair tandem repeats, scattered throughout higher eukaryotic genomes, often exhibiting high levels of polymorphism and heterozygosity. These loci are thus important genetic markers for identity, parentage and population studies. Here, six microsatellite loci were isolated from a microsatellite-enriched <b>Caribbean</b> <b>flamingo</b> partial genomic library. Two are compound complex repeats and four are perfect trinucleotide repeats. Each locus was amplified from Caribbean, African greater, Chilean and lesser flamingo genomic DNAs. Heterozygosity frequencies were calculated for Caribbean (range 0. 12 - 0. 90) and African greater flamingos (range 0. 23 - 0. 94) loci. All six microsatellite loci were found to be in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium and linkage disequilibrium analyses did not suggest linkage for any pair of two greater flamingo subspecies (African and Caribbean) loci. At least five of the loci also exhibit polymorphism in Chilean and lesser flamingos, but due to small sample numbers, relevant allele/heterozygosity frequency calculations could not be estimated. Nucleotide sequence comparisons of the amplicons derived from the four flamingo groups reveal a high level of sequence conservation at all loci. Although small sample numbers again limit the data for lesser flamingos and to some degree for the Chilean birds, the sequences of the two greater flamingo subspecies were identical and the number of nonconserved nucleotides appears to be higher for lesser/greater comparisons than for Chilean/greater comparisons. This is consistent with Chilean flamingos being a different species within the same genus as the greater flamingos, while lesser flamingos belong to a separate genus. Parentage analyses on suggested African greater flamingo family groups from Disney's Animal Kingdom's collection were performed using microsatellite data. Results confirmed many suggested family groups but in other cases {{one or more of the}} suggested parents were clearly excluded. The six microsatellite loci isolated provide a new population management tool useful for both wild and captive flamingo populations...|$|E
50|$|All {{over the}} gardens, there are {{different}} kinds of birds. Some of them share the air and fly amongst the butterflies, some swim in the streams with the fish. The birds of the gardens are popular attractions, because of their antics and behaviours that raises the entertainment value for the visitors. The most popular birds in the gardens are Leo the orange-winged amazon parrot, and Mango and Houdini, the <b>Caribbean</b> <b>flamingos,</b> whom usually interact or show off their behaviours to visitors. Other such birds at the gardens include finches, canaries, parakeets, a white-cheeked turaco and more. It {{is interesting to note}} that none of the species of duck in the gardens quack; rather, they whistle or chirp. One of the most notable is Duchess, the sole survivor of her clutch, who is a puna teal duck.|$|R
40|$|Flamingos are filter feeders {{that only}} rarely ingest larger food items. Their bill anatomy {{is adapted to}} the suction, filtration, and {{ejection}} of a fluid medium. This case report documents a rare case of bill impaction {{in a group of}} <b>Caribbean</b> <b>flamingos</b> (Phoenicopterus ruber) that were kept in a mixed exhibit together with roseate spoonbills (Platalea ajaja) and scarlet ibis (Eudocimus ruber). The latter species received fatty minced meat as part of their diet, which was also accessible to the flamingos. Weakness and poor body condition of one flamingo were noted. On clinical examination, the animal was emaciated, hypoglycemic, and showed a severe impaction of the bill with a mixture of lard, mud, and sand. This mixture had compressed the tongue and eventually had most likely prevented further food intake. In five additional flamingos, a bulging of the gular area, similar to the extension of this area during the tongue-retraction stage of the feeding cycle, was noted and interpreted as a sign of tongue displacement by similar masses in their bills. All animals were caught and the masses removed. All animals resumed food intake immediately, and the emaciated animal rapidly improved in condition. Food presentation was changed so that the trays for the other species were no longer accessible to the flamingos, and no similar problems have been observed since that time...|$|R
40|$|Summary: Feather {{discoloration}} in psittacines {{has been}} attributed to aging of feathers, delayed moult, malnutrition, hypothyroidism, and often to liver disease. 1 Feather discoloration due to soiling and subsequent saprophytic fungal growth has been described in flamingoes at Slimbridge England. 2 Feather Fungus in Flamingoes This phenomenon was also observed at Parrot Jungle and Gardens in Miami after a dietary change, which increased the fat content of the diet. The flock of 57 <b>Caribbean</b> <b>flamingoes</b> was housed in a large open-air exhibit approximately 1 acre, with a large fresh water lake. The birds remained almost exclusively in the open sunny center of the exhibit adjoining the lake. The exhibit was surrounded by a well maintained but dense garden. Addition of a high quality dog food to the diet was intended to improve reproductive performance in the stable flock of flamingoes. The dietary change was followed by onset of the rainy season. Flamingoes engaged in nest building activities also tend to soil their plumage with mud used to construct mounds. The plumage, primarily of the back and wings, developed a dark discoloration appearing streaked with black. Physical exam revealed oily deposits coating the feathers with grossly visible opaque black coloration. Microscopic examination revealed black deposits on plumules often with corresponding degeneration of pennaceous barbs and barbules. Culture of feathers revealed several species of saprophytic fungi which are also associated with sooty mold,...|$|R
50|$|The {{first episode}} gives an {{overview}} of the variety of the Caribbean’s natural history, revealing the hidden wild side of the islands. Spotted and bottlenose dolphins cruise the shallow sand banks around the Bahamas. The mangrove forests of Barbuda’s shallow lagoons provide ideal nest sites for the Caribbean’s largest colony of frigatebirds. The birds are filmed jostling over the best locations and collecting floating sticks on the wing. The nearby islands of St Lucia, St Vincent and Dominica have a different character. The thickly forested slopes of their volcanic mountains harbour rare hummingbirds and parrots. Their fertile soils also attract people, but scenes of the Montserrat eruptions of recent years show the threat they live with. The deep waters off Dominica are breeding grounds for sperm whales, filmed engaging in tactile social behaviour at the surface. Caves are a feature of Cuba’s limestone geology, and provide homes for millions of bats as well as Cuban boas and secretive hutias, the latter filmed {{for the first time in}} the wild. The southerly ABC islands (Aruba, Bonaire and Curaçao), swept by dry trade winds, are virtual deserts. Every year, 20,000 <b>Caribbean</b> <b>flamingos</b> arrive to breed on their salt pans. The clear waters around Bonaire have the greatest variety of reef fish anywhere in the Caribbean. The final island to be featured is Trinidad, cut off from South America by rising sea levels 2,000 years ago. Its island fauna include many mainland species such as red howler monkeys, capuchins and scarlet ibis.|$|R
