40|$|In {{the last}} few years, psychologists and neuroscientists have {{increasingly}} investigated the presence of multisensory interactions in people’s perceptions of food and beverage. For example, {{the results of a}} recent questionnaire-based study showed that wine is believed to be more expensive and of better quality when contained in a heavier bottle. However, it remains unclear whether various foods or liquids share similar multisensory associations {{in the mind of the}} consumer. In a laboratory study, we investigated the multisensory interactions between the taste of mineral water and the weight of the plastic cup in which it is served. The participants evaluated the freshness, pleasantness, level of carbonation, and lightness of two types of mineral water (i. e., still and carbonated) using visual analogue scales. The water was served in three identical plastic cups, varying only in terms of their weight (i. e., light, medium, and heavy). The results showed that when a <b>heavier</b> <b>cup</b> was used, the participants perceived the mineral water as less pleasant. By contrast, they rated the water served in <b>heavier</b> <b>cups</b> as more carbonated than water served in lighter cups. These data demonstrate that crossmodal associations in taste perception depend on the category of the product being evaluated and the specific quality that is rated. Such findings are extremely important for understanding the role of sensory interaction in food evaluation as well as encouraging healthier eating and drinking behaviors...|$|R
50|$|The {{campaign}} {{began with}} a home win over Ipswich Town and after ten games the team had lost only once and were in the play-off places. Six defeats in 13 games between October and the new year saw Reading slip to 9th, though their form improved in January with three wins from five, including 7-1 and 5-1 victories over Bolton Wanderers and Blackpool respectively. Despite mixed form from February onwards, Reading remained in contention for the play-offs until the last game of the season. Needing only to equal Brighton & Hove Albion's result to finish in the top six, the team drew at home to already promoted Burnley whilst Brighton scored a last-minute winner at Nottingham Forest. Reading therefore finished seventh and were consigned to the Championship for another season. In the two domestic cup competitions, Reading were knocked out at the stage they entered. They were beaten 6-0 by Peterborough United {{in the second round}} of the League <b>Cup,</b> their <b>heaviest</b> defeat since 1999, whilst in the FA Cup third round they lost 1-0 to Brighton.|$|R

Small Heath threw men forward in search of an equaliser, which left them ill-protected in defence, and they conceded twice more. In the FA Cup, Small Heath were drawn at home to Bolton Wanderers, who were so keen to have the match played on their own ground that they offered Small Heath the total gate receipts up to £150 and a half share of receipts above that figure, with a minimum guarantee of £60, to agree to a change of venue. The offer was declined. Bolton were predicted to lose, but they did not. With the wind behind them, Small Heath took a two-goal half-time lead, but in the second half, Hollis, who had [...] "not given a worse display in goal all season", made numerous mistakes, gifted the visitors two goals, and the final score was 4–3 to the First Division side.|$|R

The regatta course in Vichy is on a natural river, which quality is highly influenced by the weather conditions.

On 25 July 2010 the Executive Committee of the International Canoe Federation awarded the vacant place in its meeting in Lausanne to Szeged, which came second behind Vichy in the official candidating process, and was originally scheduled to host of the 2013 ICF Canoe Sprint World Championships.|$|R
40|$|The Stanley Cup is {{the trophy}} {{assigned}} annually {{to the winner}} of the National Hockey League (aka the NHL). The cup is a small silver bowl measuring 18. 5 centimetres in height and 29 in diameter. The bowl rests on a gigantic stepped, cylindrical base with a lower diameter of 43. 8 centimetres. Altogether the cup is 89. 5 centimetres high and weighs 15. 5 kilograms. The Stanley Cup is by far the best trophy design in contemporary sports. It is certainly much more interesting than the simply adequate UEFA Champions League Cup; impossible to compare with the provincial wannabe-classicism of the Copa Libertadores; totally opposed to the sad modernism of the FIFA World Cup or the UEFA Europa League Cup; entirely free from the naivety of the FIFA Club’s World Cup and the NBA’s Larry O’Brien trophy; miles away from the souvenir-like irrelevance of the MLB Commissioner’s Trophy or the Invasion of the Body Snatchers aesthetic of the NFL’s Lombardi Trophy. Among today’s trophies, only the Venus Rosewater Dish (a silver dish measuring 48 centimetres in diameter and decorated with figures from mythology which is given to the Wimbledon Ladies’ Singles champion) possesses a comparable quality, but its beauty is definitely of another kind.

40|$|Optimising {{production}} {{is an important}} aspect in pig farming. Despite the fact that nowadays sows are able to reach a high litter size born alive, postnatal piglet mortality remains a problem in many pig farms. Due to the increased litter size, the birth weight of individual piglets is lower and as a consequence, the chances of survival of certain piglets are very low. It is therefore important that every piglet can consume enough milk. To ensure this, additional milk can be supplied in the farrowing crate, for example by introducing Rescue Cups. This means an extra cost for the pig farmer and the effects on production parameters of the piglets must be considered. To this end, 1, 710 piglets from 127 sows were followed during a suckling period of 22 days, from which 854 piglets (from 63 sows) had access to extra milk using Rescue Cups (treatment group) and 856 piglets (from 64 sows) had no access to extra milk (control group). The piglets in the treatment group had access to extra milk {{from the age of}} 4 days until the age of 15 days. Birth weight, weaning weight and piglet mortality were recorded as production parameters. Data were analysed using the generalized linear mixed model. No significant difference was found in piglets mortality. The mean mortality rate however was already very low (7, 53 %). This shows that the management in general at the pig fram in this study was already good. There was no difference found in daily growth rate. The uniformity within the litters does not seem to increase when extra milk was provided. This might be {{due to the fact that}} not only small piglets drink milk from the <b>cups,</b> but also <b>heavier</b> piglets. There was also no difference found in weaning weight between treatment and control group within the group of piglets with the lowest weaning weight. status: publishe...|$|R
50|$|Attendance for the June 11 Super Viernes was noticeably {{lower than}} {{the weeks leading up}} to the event, mostly due to the opening night of the 2010 FIFA World <b>Cup</b> and a <b>heavy</b> {{rainfall}} in and around Mexico City. The main event was billed as a relevos incredibles match, teaming up the tecnicos (good guys) El Hijo del Fantasma and Místico teaming up with the rudo (bad guy) Negro Casas to wrestle the rudos Héctor Garza and Olímpico as well as Volador, Jr. who had seemingly turned rudo during the 2010 Sin Salida show the previous Sunday. Mistico came to the ring wearing the Jersey of the Mexico National football team, instantly getting a favorable reaction from the crowd. Volador, Jr. came to the ring wearing the rudo mask that combined Volador, Jr.'s regular mask with the mask of Averno like the one he had worn during Sin Salida. While his alignment was up in the air after Sin Salida Volador, Jr. worked as a fully fledged rudo during the match, something which saw Volador, Jr. gain the support of a large portion of the crowd as he targeted Místico during the match. Olímpico won the first fall in the match that marked his return to Arena México. Héctor Garza pinned Hijo del Fantasma after a Moonsault, earning the first fall for their team in just 3:36. The second fall came just 2:42 later as Negro Casas rolled up Olímpico and Hijo del Fantasma pinned Garza. The third fall went longer than the first two falls combined with no clear advantage between the two teams. During the fall Garza dove out of the ring, hitting Hijo del Fantasma with such force that he was removed from the arena on a stretcher, leaving the match a two on three handicap match. The end of the match saw Volador, Jr. remove his mask, tossing it to Místico to give the impression that Místico had unmasked him. The rudo ploy worked as the referee disqualified Místico's team giving Volador, Jr., Garza and Olímpico the victory in the main event. Following the match Volador, Jr. and Místico exchanged challenges for a Lucha de Apuesta, mask vs. mask match, which was also accepted although no official match was booked at the time.|$|R
