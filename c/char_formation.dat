In order {{to better understand the}} influence of matrix nature on post-fire properties, the fiber - or matrix-dominated mechanical responses of laminates have been investigated by means of quasi-isotropic or angle-ply stacking sequences. Compared to carbon/PPS laminates, the mechanical properties of carbon/Epoxy laminates are higher in the virgin state (no prior fire exposure). The analysis of the post fire tensile properties shows that prior severe fire exposures are more detrimental to carbon/Epoxy than to carbon/PPS laminates. Although the PPS matrix behavior is highly ductile at a test temperature higher than glass transition temperature, it clearly appears that the decrease in the tensile properties laminates of PPS-based composites is much slower than the one observed in carbon/Epoxy laminates subjected to severe prior fire conditions. Provided the heat flux is high enough to lead to the outset of pyrolysis, PPS-based composites yield higher amounts of <b>char,</b> whose <b>formation</b> retains the structural integrity of fire-damaged composites.

Coal petrography was utilized to assess the maceral and <b>char</b> <b>formation</b> distribution of the feed coal samples and their packed-bed combustion unit’s products. The maceral distribution of the feed coal fractions differed from the typical run-of-mine Highveld coal petrographic composition; the smallest size fractions (53 mm and 37. 5 mm) having the highest vitrinite content. Maceral distribution was further divided into total reactive maceral particles, total inert maceral particles, and total inertinite particles. The 53 mm and 37. 5 mm feed coal samples had the highest total reactive maceral particle content. Inert char particles dominated in the packed-bed combustion unit samples due to high inertinite maceral group content of the Highveld coals. Unexpectedly, the 53 mm feed coal sample had higher content of total reactive maceral particles and lower content of total inert maceral particles; whereas the 37. 5 mm feed coal sample had high content of reactive maceral particles and high content of total inert maceral particles. This variation in maceral group content lead to the 53 mm feed coal sample being more reactive (producing more devolatilized and porous chars and thus reacting faster with reactant gases) than the 37. 5 mm feed coal sample. This was due to inert maceral particles restricting the 37. 5 mm feed coal sample from fully softening and reacting with reactant gas.
