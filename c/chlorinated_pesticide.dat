Biomonitoring results indicated that the bioavailability of chlorinated pesticides has been reduced from preremediation levels both in the dredged area and throughout Richmond Harbor. Total DDT and dieldrin concentrations in mussel tissues were dramatically lower than measured levels from preremediation surveys and also lower than Year 1 levels from post-remediation biomonitoring.

Functional complementation of a linB mutant of UT 26, UT 26 DB, was performed by the exogenous plasmid isolation technique using HCH-contaminated soil, leading to our successful identification of a plasmid, pLB 1, carrying the linB gene. Complete sequencing analysis of pLB 1, with a size of 65, 998 bp, revealed that it carries (i) 50 totally annotated coding sequences, (ii) an IS 6100 composite transposon containing two copies of linB, and (iii) potential genes for replication, maintenance, and conjugative transfer {{with low levels of}} similarity to other homologues. A minireplicon assay demonstrated that a 2 -kb region containing the predicted repA gene and its upstream region of pLB 1 functions as an autonomously replicating unit in UT 26. Furthermore, pLB 1 was conjugally transferred from UT 26 DB to other α-proteobacterial strains but not to any of the β- or γ-proteobacterial strains examined to date. These results suggest that this exogenously isolated novel plasmid contributes to the dissemination of at least some genes for γ-HCH degradation in the natural environment. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first detailed report of a plasmid involved in γ-HCH degradation...|$|E
40|$|Using in situ {{bioremediation}} {{to destroy}} pesticides in impacted soil is a cheaper, more permanent alternative to “dig-and-dump ” treatment methods By Alan Seech, PhD, and James Mueller, PhD As urban centers grow in size, substantial areas of agricultural and industrial land are being converted to residential use. One {{of the issues}} frequently encountered when such a change in land use is implemented {{is the presence of}} elevated concentrations of <b>chlorinated</b> <b>pesticides</b> and herbicides historically used in agricultural crop production. Understanding the Problem Where possible, pesticide-contaminate...|$|R
40|$|Research {{indicates}} that farmers {{are more likely}} than the general population to experience certain types of cancer (e. g., Frey; Burmeister; Schuman, Mandel, and Blackard; Blair and Zahm). An ongoing study by the National Cancer Institute (NCI) is addressing links between types of cancer and possible causes such as use of specific agricultural pesticides (Alavanja, et al.). Moreover, <b>chlorinated</b> <b>pesticides</b> are suspected (but not proven) to be endocrine disruptors (Tilson, Keith). The Endocrine Disruptor Research Initiative is analyzing chemicals suspected of being disruptors (EPA Jul...|$|R
50|$|In the {{electron}} capture mode, the PDD is a selective detector for monitoring high electron affinity compounds such as freons, <b>chlorinated</b> <b>pesticides,</b> and other halogen compounds. For {{this type of}} compound, the minimum detectable quantity (MDQ) is at the femtogram (10-15) or picogram (10-12) level. The PDD is similar in sensitivity and response characteristics to a conventional radioactive ECD, and can be operated at temperatures up to 400°C. For operation in this mode, He and CH4 are introduced just upstream from the column exit.|$|R
