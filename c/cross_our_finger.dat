40|$|Welcome to {{our special}} edition {{focusing}} on assessment. We have the pleas-ure of presenting eight articles that address assessment {{in social work}} edu-cation {{from a variety of}} perspectives. These contributions were chosen in keeping with the philosophy of this journal: The examination of issues and ideas that will influence how our profession will address the countless assessment ques-tions we continually discover. Assessment is interwoven throughout the fabric of social work education. We con-tinually take stock of what we are doing and how well we are accomplishing our intended goals. It permeates our academic lives whether we notice it or not. Assessment presents itself when we emerge from class. Are we smiling or frowning because of what occurred? Assessment happens when we select textbooks. Are we happy with our choices or do we have the urge to write our own? Assessment is salient againwhenwe craft syllabi. We can only cram somuch into 15 weeks—some-thing has to go—yet, we know from professional wisdom that we easily could use more time. It comes into play when the faculty meets to take stock of what the cur-riculum is accomplishing. Is graduation joyful because we are confident in what we have created? Or do we <b>cross</b> <b>our</b> <b>fingers</b> from reservations and misgivings? And...|$|R
40|$|The Pacific Northwest {{is running}} true to form. While {{the eastern and}} {{southern}} army camps are fighting epidemics of Spanish influenza our solitary western encampment at Camp Lewis [Tacoma] seems immune. The camp sanitary inspector admits there were 115 cases of influenza there on a recent date, but the case were not Spanish influenza, because, the official says, the latter ‘develops pneumonia, while this rarely occurs with influenza patients here. Here the disease is usually checked and patients discharged from the hospital in three days. ’”• “Happily then, the northwest must be contented with the common or garden variety of influenza and the imported type is not available, probably because of our distance from the source of supply, the scarcity of bottoms, prohibitive freight rates {{and the necessity of}} conserving all transportation facilities and these other little irritations that limit our trade relations with the Atlantic seaboard. ”• “At last the east has something the west does not want. It must take the bitter with the sweet. Meanwhile, as the health officer says, we should cough discreetly into our hankies, sleep with windows open, knock wood, <b>cross</b> <b>our</b> <b>fingers</b> and continue to enjoys Spanish influenza-less days and nights. ”Newspaper article...|$|R

40|$|ZAPATA ENGINEERING {{challenged}} our {{engineers and}} scientists, which included robotics expertise from Carnegie Mellon University, {{to design a}} solution to meet our client's requirements for rapid digital geophysical and radiological data collection of a munitions test range with no down-range personnel. A prime concern {{of the project was}} to minimize exposure of personnel to unexploded ordnance and radiation. The field season was limited by extreme heat, cold and snow. Geographical Information System (GIS) tools were used throughout this project to accurately define the limits of mapped areas, build a common mapping platform from various client products, track production progress, allocate resources and relate subsurface geophysical information to geographical features for use in rapidly reacquiring targets for investigation. We were hopeful that our platform could meet the proposed 35 acres per day, towing both a geophysical package and a radiological monitoring trailer. We held <b>our</b> breath and <b>crossed</b> <b>our</b> <b>fingers</b> as the autonomous Speedrower began to crawl across the playa lakebed. We met our proposed production rate, and we averaged just less than 50 acres per 12 -hour day using the autonomous platform with a path tracking error of less than +/- 4 inches. Our project team mapped over 1, 800 acres in an 8 -week (4 days per week) timeframe. The expertise of our partner, Carnegie Mellon University, was recently demonstrated when their two autonomous vehicle entries finished second and third at the 2005 Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) Grand Challenge. 'The Grand Challenge program was established to help foster the development of autonomous vehicle technology that will some day help save the lives of Americans who are protecting our country on the battlefield', said DARPA Grand Challenge Program Manager, Ron Kurjanowicz. Our autonomous remote-controlled vehicle (ARCV) was a modified New Holland 2550 Speedrower retrofitted to allow the machine-actuated functions to be controlled by an onboard computer. The computer-controlled Speedrower was developed at Carnegie Mellon University to automate agricultural harvesting. Harvesting tasks require the vehicle to cover a field using minimally overlapping rows at slow speeds in a similar manner to geophysical data acquisition. The Speedrower had demonstrated its ability to perform as it had already logged hundreds of acres of autonomous harvesting. This project is the first use of autonomous robotic technology on a large-scale for geophysical surveying...|$|R
