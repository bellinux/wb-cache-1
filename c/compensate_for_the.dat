5|$|Data {{from the}} {{captured}} Zero had been {{transmitted to the}} U.S. Navy's Bureau of Aeronautics (BuAer) and Grumman Aircraft. After careful study, Roy Grumman decided that he could match or surpass the Zero in most respects, except in range, without sacrificing pilot armor, self-sealing tanks and fuselage structure. The new F6F Hellcat would <b>compensate</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> extra weight with additional power.|$|E
5|$|During {{the period}} of time in which the battleships were out of {{commission}} in the United States, several technological updates and breakthroughs enabled naval ships, submarines, and aircraft to <b>compensate</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> absence of big guns within the fleet.|$|E
5|$|Enterprise was {{intentionally}} {{equipped with}} less advanced versions of technologies seen in previous series. For example, {{it has no}} tractor beam, uses missiles instead of photon torpedoes, and has only limited means of synthesizing foods and other consumable items.

5|$|In 1735 Harrison {{built his}} first chronometer, which he {{steadily}} improved {{on over the}} next thirty years before submitting it for examination. The clock had many innovations, {{including the use of}} bearings to reduce friction, weighted balances to <b>compensate</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> ship's pitch and roll in the sea and the use of two different metals to reduce the problem of expansion from heat.|$|E
5|$|In 1873, in {{an effort}} to improve {{navigation}} around the bridge and reduce accidents, two of the piers were removed, making the widest span a more easily navigated , and the bridge deck was strengthened with iron girders to <b>compensate</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> missing piers.|$|E
5|$|In early 1945, {{while under}} repair for combat damage, Mississippi {{received}} a new secondary battery. The old 51-caliber 5-inch guns were removed, and eight {{more of the}} 25-caliber anti-aircraft guns were installed, along with thirteen quadruple Bofors 40 mm mounts and forty 20 mm Oerlikon guns. To <b>compensate</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> added weight, the ship's armored conning tower was removed.|$|E

5|$|One {{major element}} of {{pressure}} on producers is the unchanged exchange regime of the Central Bank of Iran, which puts imported products at an advantage by failing to <b>compensate</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> relative increase in production costs of domestic producers.|$|E
5|$|The division's {{commanding}} officer, General Lafontaine, {{put more}} faith into fortifications than training, as {{he believed it}} would <b>compensate</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> weakness of the division.

5|$|Vision, chemoreception (tongue-flicking) {{and hearing}} are {{important}} senses for terrestrial snakes but these stimuli become distorted in water. The poor visibility, chemical dilution and limitation of ground-borne vibrations underwater suggest that sea snakes and sea kraits may have unique sensory abilities to <b>compensate</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> {{relative lack of}} other sensory cues.|$|E

5|$|A popular workmen's train (one penny per journey) ran between Ludgate Hill and Victoria via Herne Hill from 1865. Trains {{left from}} both termini at 04:55 and {{returned}} at 18:15. The LCDR {{was compelled to}} operate this service by Parliament to <b>compensate</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> large number of working-class homes destroyed in Camberwell during {{the construction of the}} City Branch. Regular one-way fares to Ludgate Hill were eightpence, sixpence and fourpence for first, second and third class respectively (or return for one shilling, ninepence and sevenpence respectively), with journey times of 15 minutes on express trains and 26 minutes when calling at all stops.|$|E
5|$|According to Di Tella and Zymelman (1967), {{the main}} {{difference}} between Argentina and other settler societies such as Australia and Canada was its failure to seek adequate alternatives to <b>compensate</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> end of geographical expansion with the definitive closing of the frontier. Solberg (1985) noted the differences between the land distribution in Canada, which led to a rising number of small farmers, and the small number of landowners each with large areas of land in Argentina.|$|E
5|$|After the hurricane's passage, {{officials}} deployed the Florida National Guard to {{affected areas}} {{in order to}} maintain order and quell looting. Across Florida, a total of 3,897people filed damage claims after receiving damage from the hurricane, 80% of them in the Miami area. Insurance companies paid about $1million to <b>compensate</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> storm damage. Due to the loss in citrus crop, prices briefly increased, although they returned to normal levels by late October.|$|E

Diphthongization <b>compensates</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> loss of the palatal stop (segment loss compensation). There are other cases where diphthongization <b>compensates</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> loss of point of articulation features (property loss compensation) as in [...] ('year') vs. [...] ('years').|$|R

5|$|Another nocturnal {{adaptation}} {{can be seen}} in kangaroo rats, which exhibit moonlight avoidance. These rodents forage {{in relatively}} open habitats and reduce their activity outside their nest burrows in response to moonlight. During a full moon, they shift their activity towards areas of relatively dense cover to <b>compensate</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> extra brightness. In controlled experiments, artificial moon-like illumination stimulates similar responses in their foraging behavior, suggesting that this behavior has evolved to reduce predation risk.|$|E
5|$|Between September 2008 and December 2010, twenty-two spectra were {{collected}} using the High Resolution Echelle Spectrometer (HIRES) instrument at Hawaii's W.M. Keck Observatory. This data {{was used to}} derive HAT-P-33's radial velocity. A far greater number of spectra were gathered for HAT-P-33 than the number usually gathered for planetary candidates to <b>compensate</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> data's jitter effect. It was concluded that the jitter in the data was caused by stellar activity and not {{the presence of other}} planets.|$|E
5|$|Immersion of {{the human}} body in water affects the circulation, renal system, fluid balance, and breathing, because the {{external}} hydrostatic pressure of the water provides support against the internal hydrostatic pressure of the blood. This causes a blood shift from the extravascular tissues of the limbs into the chest cavity, and fluid losses known as immersion diuresis <b>compensate</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> blood shift in hydrated subjects soon after immersion. Hydrostatic pressure on the body from head-out immersion causes negative pressure breathing which contributes to the blood shift.|$|E
