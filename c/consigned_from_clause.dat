40|$|This paper quantifies how {{real-time}} {{access to}} information on the arrival status of packages <b>consigned</b> <b>from</b> overseas for subsequent truck transportation {{can contribute to the}} efficiency of international couriers' ground delivery operations. The contribution is quantified by determining the eliminable ground transportation costs of next-best tactics that partially compensate for deficiencies in package arrival information. Next-best tactics include forecasting each package's arrival status and adjusting ground delivery routes when actual arrival information becomes known. The study shows that the contribution can be significant, reaching hundreds of dollars per day. The study also finds that tactics using forecasts, even highly accurate forecasts, are not always the most effective next-best tactics.
