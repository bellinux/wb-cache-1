5000|$|<b>Coopetition</b> or co-opetition (sometimes spelled [...] "coopertition" [...] or [...] "co-opertition") is a {{neologism}} coined {{to describe}} cooperative competition. <b>Coopetition</b> is a portmanteau {{of cooperation and}} competition, emphasizing the [...] "petition"-like nature of joint work.|$|E
5000|$|In 2012 and 2013, {{the concept}} of 'Coopetitive Knowledge Sharing' was {{inspired}} by inter-organization research literature toward developing a Coopetitive Model of Knowledge Sharing that explains (1) how <b>coopetition</b> should be conceptualized, (2) What forms <b>coopetition</b> (three formative constructs of outcome (goal, reward), means (task related), boundary (friendship, geographical closeness, sense of team belonging) interdependencies), and (3) How <b>coopetition</b> and its interrelated components interact and influence knowledge sharing behaviors in cross-functional software teams. This series of publications in the Journal of Systems and Software and Information Processing & Management conceptualize and operationalize the multi-dimensional construct of cross-functional <b>coopetition</b> and presents an instrument for measuring this construct. Cross-functional <b>coopetition</b> is conceptualized with five distinct and independent constructs, {{three of them are}} related to cross-functional cooperation (task orientation, communication, interpersonal relationships), and two are associated with cross-functional competition (tangible resources and intangible resources).|$|E
5000|$|One of the {{examples}} of <b>coopetition</b> in practice in high technology context is the collaborative joint venture formed by Samsung Electronics and Sony formed in 2004 for the development and manufacturing of flat-screen LCD Panels. [...] <b>Coopetition</b> is becoming more critical in high technology contexts because of several challenges such as shrinking product life cycles, need for heavy investments in research and development, convergence of multiple technologies, and importance of technological standards. While it is quite challenging to engage in <b>coopetition</b> (or cooperate with a competitor), <b>coopetition</b> engagements are helpful for firms to address major technological challenges, to create benefits for partnering firms, and to advance technological innovations that benefit the firms, the industry, and consumers.|$|E
5000|$|Cartels are not {{an example}} of <b>coopetition</b> because {{their goal is to}} limit competition, and the goal of <b>coopetition</b> is to take {{advantage}} of the complementary resources of the firms in order to reach lower costs and manage new innovation possibilities, still regarding competition in a further moment.|$|E
5000|$|At intra-organizational level, <b>coopetition</b> occurs between {{individuals}} or functional units {{within the same}} organization. Based on game theory [...] and social interdependence theories, some studies investigate the presence of simultaneous cooperation and competition among functional units, the antecedents of <b>coopetition,</b> {{and its impact on}} knowledge sharing behaviors. For example, the concept of coopetitive knowledge sharing is developed to explain mechanisms through which <b>coopetition</b> influences effective knowledge sharing practices in cross-functional teams. The underlying argument is that while organizational teams need to cooperate, they are likely to experience tension caused by diverse professional philosophies and competing goals from different cross-functional representatives.|$|E

50|$|The {{extension}} of the addiction based model required the re-definition of elements: self-help was used to develop the dialectic concept of <b>coopetition.</b> <b>Coopetition</b> means that an individual experiences simultaneously aspects of cooperation as well as competition within every professional context. Both must be integrated in the dialectical sense to act efficiently and effectively professionally.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Coopetition</b> {{occurs at}} inter-organizational or intra-organizational levels.Dagnino and Padula (2002)'s work is {{considered}} a pioneering contribution. They conceptualized that, at inter-organisational level, <b>coopetition</b> occurs when companies interact with partial congruence of interests. They cooperate {{with each other to}} reach a higher value creation if compared to the value created without interaction and struggle to achieve competitive advantage. Often <b>coopetition</b> takes place when companies that are in the same market work together in the exploration of knowledge and research of new products, {{at the same time that}} they compete for market-share of their products and in the exploitation of the knowledge created. In this case, the interactions occur simultaneously and in different levels in the value chain. This is the case of the arrangement between PSA Peugeot Citroën and Toyota to share components for a new city car—simultaneously sold as the Peugeot 107, the Toyota Aygo, and the Citroën C1, where companies save money on shared costs while remaining fiercely competitive in other areas. Several advantages can be foreseen, as cost reductions, resources complementarity and technological transfer. Some difficulties also exist, as distribution of control, equity in risk, complementary needs and trust. It is possible for more than two companies to be involved in <b>coopetition</b> with one another. Another possible case for <b>coopetition</b> is joint resource management in construction. Sadegh Asgari and his colleagues [...] (2013) presents a short-term partnering case in which construction contractors form an alliance, agreeing to put all or some of their resources in a joint pool for a fixed duration of time and to allocate the group resources using a more cost-effective plan. Sadegh Asgari, Abbas Afshar and Kaveh Madani [...] (2013) suggested cooperative game theory as the basis for fair and efficient allocation of the incremental benefits of cooperation among the cooperating contractors. Their study introduced a new paradigm in construction resource planning and allocation. Contractors no longer see each other as just competitors; They look for cooperation beyond their competition in order to reduce their costs.|$|E
50|$|<b>Coopetition</b> {{is a word}} coined from {{cooperation}} and competition. It is used when companies otherwise competitors collaborate in a consortium to cooperate on areas non-strategic for their core businesses. They prefer to reduce their costs on these non-strategic areas and compete on other areas where they can differentiate better.|$|E

50|$|Co-Opetition: A Revolution Mindset that Combines Competition and Cooperation is a non-fiction book on <b>coopetition,</b> {{business}} strategy, {{and game}} theory by Adam M.

50|$|Horizontal {{integration}} {{is related to}} horizontal alliance (also known as horizontal cooperation). However, {{in the case of}} a horizontal alliance, the partnering companies set up a contract, but remain independent. For example, Raue & Wieland (2015) describe the example of legally independent logistics service providers who cooperate. Such an alliance relates to <b>coopetition.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Some words contain {{simultaneous}} opposing or competing {{meanings in}} the same context, rather than alternative meanings in different contexts; examples include blend words such as <b>coopetition</b> (meaning a murky blend of cooperation and competition) and frenemy (meaning a murky blend of friend and enemy). These are not usually classed as contronyms, but they share the theme of containing opposing meanings.|$|E
50|$|The text {{discusses}} {{at length}} {{the notion of}} <b>coopetition,</b> a business strategy gained from game theory to demonstrate when it is better for competitors to work together rather than to go up against one another in contest. The authors use many examples to show the simultaneous interplay between competition and cooperation. Their research added to previous industry analysis such as Porter’s five forces model, which focused almost entirely on competition.|$|E
50|$|Central for {{in-depth}} systemics work is {{the continuous}} practice of one’s own individual mental-somatic models through the practice of Vipassana-meditation as taught by S.N. Goenka. This ensures that apart from the ongoing development of professional qualifications, reconstructive understanding, and <b>coopetition,</b> the transformative processes in {{the depth of the}} mind are maintained. Vipassana-meditation can be learned in initial 10-day retreats, after which individuals can continue to practice the meditation technique autonomously.|$|E

This resulted in the later publication of Universal Co-opetition; The Tortoise Shell Game, a novelization of co-opetition; and the non-fiction A Primal Wisdom (2014), corollary to the novel. (2d.

50|$|This {{emerging}} stage {{represents the}} most radical business refocusing so far. Through the global sourcing, sections and components of the internal process are being outsourced to external providers and contractors {{in search of the}} highest added value contribution. Long-term alliances are formed and companies are transforming themselves into networks. Network cooperation is replacing corporate competition: <b>coopetition</b> emerges. The majority of companies (also the educational and training institutions) could still be the leading global players in this incessant and accelerating paradigm shifting. Globally distributed process ushers in new forms of organization, coordination and modular integration.|$|E
5000|$|In 2009, the {{importance}} of <b>coopetition</b> was emphasized for Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises (SMEs). As technological battles intensify and technologies become more complex, SMEs face numerous challenges such as rising R&D costs, high risk and uncertainty in technological development, and lack of resources to pursue large-scale innovation projects. SMEs can more effectively deal with these problems if they work together by combining their own resources and expertise and develop their collective ability {{so that they can}} compete effectively with large firms and advance technologies {{they may not be able}} to advance alone.|$|E
50|$|Recycle Rush was the 2015 FIRST Robotics Competition game. It {{involves}} {{picking up}} and stacking totes on scoring platforms, putting pool noodles ("litter") inside recycling containers, {{and putting the}} containers on top of scoring stacks of totes. There is also a <b>coopetition</b> aspect of the game where both alliances of teams can pool their totes and stack them on a step dividing the field to each gain twenty points. Along with these robot actions, human players can attempt to throw the pool noodles across the field to gain four points for each noodle left in the opposing alliance's work zone.|$|E
5000|$|Co-opetition or <b>coopetition</b> - {{simultaneous}} {{competition and}} cooperation - {{is an important}} philosophy or strategy {{that goes beyond the}} conventional rules of competition and cooperation to achieve advantages of both. Global co-opetition, an application of co-opetition in a global context, is first systematically addressed in Luo’s (2004) book “Coopetition in international business”. According to this book, global co-opetition refers to the simultaneous competition and cooperation between multinational enterprises (MNEs) and their geographically dispersed business stakeholders such as global rivals, global suppliers, global distributors, global alliance partners, and foreign governments as well as among foreign subsidiaries within an MNE.|$|E
50|$|Strong early {{interest}} encouraged Freedman and Jennings {{to commit}} additional bootstrapping funds from themselves {{and friends and}} family. An R&D center was established in Calgary, Alberta, Canada in early 2002, and Alan Hawrylyshen joined the team. 2002 was spent turning the early demonstrator into a more full featured and supportable product. Ryan Kereliuk and Johnson Wu joined the company in Mid-2002, and in late 2002, Jasomi adopted a hybrid <b>coopetition</b> model of software development, keeping certain advancements proprietary while releasing others to the public through the resiprocate open-source SIP stack. David A. Bryan left the company and Alan Hawrylyshen became CTO in late 2002.|$|E
50|$|In-depth systemics is {{a context}} {{independent}} professional work approach and {{an extension of}} the field of systemic therapy and counseling approaches. The following elements are integrated: (a) classical systemic (family) therapy, (b) reconstructive work based on the principles of objective hermeneutics, (c) <b>coopetition</b> as an expression of the dialectic relationship of cooperation and competition, and (d) as the central core element, Vipassana-meditation in the tradition of Sayagyi U Ba Khin as taught by S.N. Goenka. Vipassana-meditation plays an essential {{role in the development of}} mindfulness and inner wisdom about oneself. It is an instrument to coordinate unconscious perceptions to reach a deeper dimension, which cannot be achieved through traditional therapeutic or counseling methods.|$|E
50|$|The {{application}} {{of the work in}} various contexts (e.g., case management, business leadership, coaching of prodigies) required a strong redesign and extension of the model. Vipassana-meditation became the central core, because it provides the actual instrument to initiate real personal transformation. It empowers practitioners to perceive themselves in a direct, realistic, and undistorted way - from moment to moment in the here-and-now. The goal is the development of equanimity to counteract the habitual addictive attitude at the existential level: the acceptance of unpleasant sensations and the relinquishing of craving for pleasant physical sensations. As a result, the inner world is perceived accurately and realistically. Mediated through the sensory organs, the outer world is also perceived more accurately and undistorted. As a consequence, individual actions become freer from reactions, since decisions are less influenced by habitual inner reactions than by the particularities of the specific case. The achieved autonomy flows into the {{application of}} the principles of <b>coopetition,</b> qualification, and reconstructive understanding.|$|E
40|$|The <b>coopetition</b> {{literature}} {{argues that}} <b>coopetition</b> {{is a dynamic}} relation that evolves over time {{but there is a}} gap {{when it comes to the}} understanding of this evolution. The aim of this paper is to investigate, via longitudinal cases studies, the evolution of <b>coopetition</b> relationships and its management at the inter-organizational level. Through multiple cases studies in the same industry (the French grain merchants industry), we reveal the existence of two differing states of the processes of <b>coopetition.</b> The spontaneous <b>coopetition</b> and the deliberate <b>coopetition.</b> Each form of <b>coopetition</b> is related to particular tools that are used by managers in order to sustain a <b>coopetition</b> strategy. These states of <b>coopetition</b> seem to be an evolving phenomenon but this evolution is not systematic and each state of <b>coopetition</b> (deliberate or spontaneous <b>coopetition)</b> can be stable for a while. Using these findings, we propose in this paper some principles and tools to manage the evolution of <b>coopetition...</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{very concept}} of <b>coopetition</b> is founded on the complementarity-based nature of this strategy. However, <b>coopetition</b> {{research}} has devoted relatively little attention to complementarity issues {{and their impact on}} <b>coopetition</b> results. By bridging the <b>coopetition</b> and economics of complementarities research fields, we develop a model representing a classical optimization problem in complementarities as applied to <b>coopetition,</b> in order to evaluate potential risks deriving at operational level from implementing a <b>coopetition</b> strategy. The model we develop is a situated one and is based on empirical data from a longitudinal case study of <b>coopetition</b> in the mineral water and soft drinks industry. The results highlight a potential risk of <b>coopetition</b> strategies, namely thresholds effects, as well as the associated risks a wrong understanding of complementarities in a <b>coopetition</b> setting may entail...|$|E
40|$|This article {{elucidates}} {{an increasingly}} prevalent facet of global competition: simultaneous competition and cooperation between global rivals (i. e., <b>coopetition).</b> In {{order to develop}} an overall framework to analyze <b>coopetition,</b> this article explains why <b>coopetition</b> occurs, discusses situations in which cooperation or competition increases or decreases in a <b>coopetition</b> scheme, and presents a typology for understanding the intensity and diversity of <b>coopetition</b> with major global rivals. The typology of the intensity of <b>coopetition</b> identifies four situations (contending, isolating, partnering, and adapting) to describe the varying degrees of cooperation and competition between a pair of global rivals. To capture the diversity of <b>coopetition,</b> this article also identifies four positions (dispersing, concentrating, connecting, and networking), depending {{on the number of}} global rivals and the number of international markets the firm involves in <b>coopetition.</b> The article provides several broad guidelines for building <b>coopetition</b> relationships. ...|$|E
40|$|A {{deterministic}} model {{is used to}} study the change of the market share with <b>coopetition</b> strategy for enterprises. The model takes into consideration both <b>coopetition</b> enterprises and other enterprises, and the <b>coopetition</b> threshold R 0 is identified and global dynamics are completely determined by R 0. It shows that R 0 is a global threshold parameter {{in the sense that}} if R 0 1, there is a unique <b>coopetition</b> equilibrium which is globally attractive with some conditions, and thus the market share of <b>coopetition</b> enterprises tends to a steady state value. By some sensitivity analysis of R 0 on parameters, we conclude that the size of the <b>coopetition</b> threshold R 0 and <b>coopetition</b> equilibrium depended on the cooperation competitiveness of <b>coopetition</b> enterprises...|$|E
40|$|In this study, {{we apply}} a paradox {{perspective}} on <b>coopetition</b> {{to investigate the}} effects of <b>coopetition</b> paradox on managers' experience and perception of coopetitive tensions, {{and the role of}} <b>coopetition</b> capability in managing such tensions. We propose a theoretical model to posit that the intensity of <b>coopetition</b> paradox positively associates with managers' experience of external tension, which in turn lead them to perceive internal tension. Further, <b>coopetition</b> capability plays a dual role—moderates the relation between <b>coopetition</b> paradox and external tension, and reduces internal tension. We tested hypotheses on a representative multi-industry sample of 1532 firms in Sweden and the results confirm them. Our study contributes to understanding the critical role of <b>coopetition</b> capability that enables firms to maintain a moderate level of tension regardless of the intensity of <b>coopetition</b> paradox. ...|$|E

40|$|Building on {{convergent}} {{insights of}} resource dependence and business political behavior, this article attempts {{to develop a}} conceptual and typological framework of <b>coopetition</b> in which cooperation and competition simultaneously coexist {{in the relationship between}} multinational corporations (MNCs) and host governments. The <b>coopetition</b> view does not see the MNC-government relationship (MGR) as dichotomous or as a continuum between cooperation and competition but as a simultaneous, inclusive partnership containing cooperation and competition as two separate yet interrelated continua. This article addresses why <b>coopetition</b> arises, what <b>coopetition</b> constitutes, and how <b>coopetition</b> configures with environmental and organizational dynamics. It offers a typology of <b>coopetition</b> that identifies MNCs involving varying cooperation and competition (estranger, contender, partner, and integrator) and elucidates each identity's political responses. <b>Coopetition</b> MNC Host government...|$|E
40|$|Even if {{academics}} and practitioners identify <b>coopetition</b> as a winning strategy, a <b>coopetition</b> relationship {{appear to be}} difficult to sustain. <b>Coopetition</b> is relied to be a paradoxical and unstable interfirm relationship related with tensions. Academic works begun to study the causes and nature of tension in <b>coopetition</b> relationship but {{little is known about the}} way those tension is managed. The aim of this paper is to investigate, via in depth case studies, the management tools used to manage <b>coopetition</b> at the inter-organizational level. Through multiples case studies in the same industry (the French grain merchants industry), we reveal the existence of differing management tools of the <b>coopetition</b> relationships. Some tools found by our research (tacit conventions, mediation arenas, <b>coopetition</b> inducers) seem particularly novel in the <b>coopetition</b> literature. The use of tacit convention and social pressure epitomize the embeddedness and the social construction of the <b>coopetition</b> relationship. It shows that inter-firm coordination can exist in a direct and informal way, without being locked into a rigid structure and without collusion. Moreover, we found that an external party can induce the <b>coopetition</b> and bring rival firms to consider a coopetitive relationship. This finding reveals that some tools can change inter-firms dynamics and rationalities giving rise to <b>coopetition.</b> Those findings lead us to reveal the perspective of a managerial engineering of <b>coopetition</b> and to suggest some embryonic basis to open the way for its development...|$|E
40|$|While the {{literature}} on coopetitive strategies is expanding, {{the topic of the}} drivers of <b>coopetition</b> has received little attention.

40|$|In {{the search}} for innovation, high {{technology}} firms in the same industries turn {{to each other for}} R&D collaborations. The collaboration form where competitors cooperate have been defined as “coopetition” and the term builds on the interplay between competitive and cooperative forces. While <b>coopetition</b> brings benefits such as shared risks and costs, it implies organizational and managerial challenges as two opposing logics merge. This complexity calls for a deeper understanding of how firms organize and manage <b>coopetition</b> and why they organization and manage <b>coopetition</b> in the way they do. This thesis is set to answer these questions by empirically investigate <b>coopetition</b> at a case firm active in a high technology context with a long experience of collaborating with competitors. By acknowledging <b>coopetition</b> as a phenomenon carried out in the shape of projects, the internal organization and management could been thoroughly understood as project management allows a more detailed view of <b>coopetition.</b> Key findings concludes that in this empirical context, finance is the prior reason for engaging in <b>coopetition,</b> competitive forces are superior to cooperative forces in <b>coopetition</b> projects and that <b>coopetition</b> influence innovation more through contributing with funding than by an exchange of knowledge between competitors. All these aspects are further stated to impact organization and management of <b>coopetition.</b> ...|$|E
