40|$|The {{presented}} report {{examines the}} origin of the uranium-concentration in pyrolitic carbon, which is deposited on spherical UO_ 2 -fuel kernels.

It was found that during the deposition uranium from the gas phase is stored up in the growing outer pyrolitic carbon layer.

40|$|Thermally sprayed {{aluminium}} (TSA) {{is widely}} used for corrosion protection on offshore installations. Rapid degradation of the TSA has earlier been discovered, if organic coating is applied {{on top of the}} TSA. In case of coating damages on the TSA, a duplex corrosion mechanism may occur. Due to access limitations with coating equipment or hot work limitations offshore, application of new TSA may be difficult. Therefore, it is necessary to develop a repair coating for TSA in connection with damage. The repair coating must provide corrosion protection without triggering the duplex corrosion mechanism and shall be applied without removing the intact TSA. Eight repair coatings were tested on steel coated with TSA to determine the corrosion behavior in marine environment. Four possible protection mechanisms were considered: (1) cathodic polarization, (2) buffering capacity, (3) ability to release an aggressive environment formed under the coating and (4) electrical conductive coatings. The coatings contained anodic elements such as aluminium, zinc or magnesium, except for an inorganic copolymer coating and an MgO pigmented coating. A cyclic <b>coating</b> <b>test</b> was conducted for 20 cycles according to ISO 20340. Highest amount of corrosion creep for the TSA was seen for the Zn epoxy, the inorganic copolymer coating, the high Zn primer and the modified Zn epoxy. An average corrosion creep of approximately 5. 1 mm was seen for the Zn epoxy. Due to corrosion products, blistering or cracking of the repair coat were seen for these coatings. The Zn-, MgO-, Mg- and Al-silicate showed promising results without blistering after the same test. The Zn silicate showed an average corrosion creep of approximately 0. 6 mm, while the MgO-, Mg- and Al-silicate showed negligible corrosion creep. Coating resistivity was measured by obtaining several electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) over a period of time, and the open circuit potential (OCP) was measured. The zinc containing coatings were exposed for 134 days, while the MgO-, Mg-, Al-silicate and the inorganic copolymer coating were exposed for 81 days. All coatings showed an OCP more negative than - 800 mV vs. Ag/AgCl, except for the inorganic copolymer coating. This coating had an initial potential of - 430 mV vs. Ag/AgCl with decreasing development towards a more negative potential. The coatings that revealed blistering or cracking of the repair coating during the cyclic <b>coating</b> <b>test</b> showed generally higher impedance, compared to the silicate coatings that did not blister. An open coating structure was considered as the most important protection mechanism for a TSA repair coat. The protection mechanisms regarding cathodic polarization, electrical conductive coatings and the buffering effect were assumed less important compared to the open coating structure. Crevice corrosion tests with different crevice designs were performed {{in order to have a}} short-term test for the TSA duplex corrosion mechanism. Further development of the test design is necessary before the mechanism can be investigated by this method...|$|E

The material utilization rate of the application processes is mostly rather low. An important starting point to improve this situation is the application of the electrostatic coating technology. Within the scope of a R&D project carried out by the Fraunhofer IPA, coordinated by the DFO, and supported by 20 companies, the transfer of the electrostatic coating technology into production processes has been investigated on the basis of three concrete applications.

By using suitable paint materials and innovative techniques, e. g. the employment of racks made of insulating material, contactless grounding by gas electrodes or the employment of repelling electrodes, insulating substrates can be coated directly by electrostatic techniques (e. g., by turbo bells). The potential for reducing the paint consumption is expected to be up to 50 %. For reducing paint sludge, it is expected to be up to 70 %.

40|$|The aim of {{the project}} was to improve the {{efficiency}} of gas turbines by improving the usage of the mechanical and thermal strength of the materials. This was achieved by investigations to get a better understanding of materials behaviour under high mechanical and thermal loads. Three materials for aero-engines applications were studied: Ti 6246 (a high strength titanium alloy), PWA 1484 (a single crystal nickel-base alloy) and M 247 (a conventionally cast nickel-base alloy). Investigations performed on Ti 6246 included tensile tests, creep tests, LCF and HCF tests on notched and un-notched test pieces as well as special tests to characterise fretting fatigue behaviour and manufacturing effects (influence of surface conditions on the cyclic life). The results indicate that, in many respects, the strength of Ti 6246 is superior to that of alternative titanium alloys such as Ti 64 or Ti 6242. The characterisation of PWA 1484 included tensile tests at constant deformation rate, conventional creep tests as well as isothermal fatigue and thermo-mechanical fatigue tests. With regards to modelling of elasto-plastic material behaviour, satisfactory results could be achieved. Both uncoated and <b>coated</b> <b>test</b> pieces were investigated under thermo-mechanical loading. The broad material characterisation achieved by the project allows the extension of application limits to higher mechanical and thermal loads. Investigations performed on M 247 included tensile tests at constant deformation rate, creep tests, isothermal and thermomechanical fatigue tests as well as cyclic crack growth tests.
