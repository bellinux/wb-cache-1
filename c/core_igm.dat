40|$|BACKGROUND—The {{significance}} of immunoglobulin (Ig) M antibody to hepatitis C virus (HCV) core antigen was studied in 60  patients with HCV infection after orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) diagnosed by polymerase chain reaction.  METHODS—Patients were followed {{up for a}} mean of 28  months after transplantation. Sera collected three months before transplantation, and one and 12  months after transplantation were analysed for anti-HCV <b>core</b> <b>IgM</b> (HCV-IgM EIA 2. 0  assay). After OLT protocol biopsies, procedures were performed routinely every six months. Semiquantitative histopathological assessment of allograft hepatitis was performed using Knodell's score. The results were correlated with clinical features, liver histology findings, and virological features, such as genotype and viraemic levels assessed by a branched DNA assay.  RESULTS—One year after liver transplantation, 29 / 60 (48 %) patients had chronic hepatitis on graft biopsy. The presence of anti-HCV <b>core</b> <b>IgM</b> one month (p= 0. 004) and 12  months (p= 0. 003) after OLT {{was positively correlated with}} recurrence of chronic hepatitis. The positive predictive value of anti-HCV <b>core</b> <b>IgM</b> detected one month after transplantation was 0. 88.  A significant relationship was observed between severity of graft disease and presence of anti-HCV <b>core</b> <b>IgM</b> 12  months after transplantation. The mean Knodell score was 8. 9  in anti-HCV <b>core</b> <b>IgM</b> positive patients compared with 3. 6  in those who were anti-HCV <b>core</b> <b>IgM</b> negative (p= 0. 001). The presence of IgM anti-HCV did not correlate with serum HCV RNA level or HCV genotype.  CONCLUSION—We confirm that the presence of anti-HCV <b>core</b> <b>IgM</b> after OLT is a marker of HCV induced graft damage. The recurrence and severity of HCV hepatitis in patients undergoing OLT for HCV cirrhosis is related to the presence of anti-HCV <b>core</b> <b>IgM</b> after liver transplantation. These findings have diagnostic relevance and confirm that measurement of IgM anti-HCV core may help to better monitor the treatment of HCV recurrence after transplantation.    Keywords: hepatitis C; orthotopic liver transplantation; anti-HCV core IgM; immunopathogenesi...|$|E

In acute symptomatic hepatitis, transaminase tests are markedly elevated, especially, in hepatitis A. This study was carried out to examine the feasibility of discrimination between hepatitis A and B in acute phase using serum transaminase concentrations so as to take isolation precautions and to plan supportive therapy in early phase. Methods: Between January 1996 and December 1998, 444 patients, [239 (53. 8 %) males and 205 (46. 2 %) females] are tested for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), hepatitis B <b>core</b> <b>IgM</b> antigen (anti-HBc IgM), and hepatitis A immunglobuline M (anti-HAV IgM), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartat aminotransferase (AST) and bilirubin concentrations and comparison of transaminase concentrations between patients infected with hepatitis A and hepatitis B has been made. Results: ALT concentrations of HAV-infected patients had a median of 879 (minimum: 4, maximum: 7201), whereas HBV-infected patients had a median of 66 (minimum: 16, maximum: 3118). AST concentrations of HAV-infected patients had a median of 492 (minimum: 8, maximum: 5718), whereas HBV-infected patients had a median of 59, 5 (minimum: 13, maximum: 2040). Transaminase concentrations of patients infected with hepatitis A are higher than patients infected with hepatitis B (for ALT and AST p< 0, 001). Also there was difference in transaminase concentration in acute hepatitis with age. Concentrations of serum transaminases in acute hepatitis increased with age and peaked at 7 - 8 years, having a median of 1565 (minimum: 9 and maximum: 4014) for AST and 1942 (minimum: 22 and maximum: 3950) for ALT.

To characterize persistent IgM anti-HBc better, 7 - 88 and 198 immunoglobulin fractions were prepared by rate-zonal centrifugation of sera from 17 patients with persistent hepatitis B (chronic active hepa-titis) and were tested for IgM anti-HBc by a specific radioimmunoassay.

Only 25. 8 % of the carriers were positive for HBV DNA in serum, and in the majority of these only trace amounts were detectable. IgM antibody to hepatitis B <b>core</b> antigen (<b>IgM</b> anti-HBc) was negative in 54 % ofthe carriers, and only 26 % had IgM anti-HBc in high titer.

40|$|Abstract. Routine antenatal {{hepatitis}} B {{surface antigen}} (HBsAg) screening and immunization of risk babies is {{very effective in}} preventing perinatal transmission of hepatitis B virus (HBV). We studied 1, 800 parturients attending a public hospital to assess the rationale for such vaccination in Bangladesh. In one in every 29 deliveries (63 of 1, 800 or 3. 5 %), the mother {{was found to be}} HBsAg positive. All were asymptomatic and many (41 of 63 or 65 %) without risk factors would remain undetected if HBsAg screening were performed on selected groups. Most of the HBsAg-positive mothers (54 of 63 or 85. 7 %) were found to be chronic carriers and 30. 2 % (19 of 63) were also hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) positive, indicating high infectivity. Although 23 cord blood were positive for HBsAg or HBeAg, none were positive for IgM antibody to hepatitis B <b>core</b> antigen (<b>IgM</b> anti-HBc), suggesting transplacental transmis-sion of the antigens rather than intrauterine infection. These findings are discussed in relation to the cost-effectiveness of routine prenatal screening and immunization of risk babies compared with universal infant immunization. Perinatal transmission of hepatitis B virus (HBV) from infected mother to infant often leads to severe long-term sequel. Infants born to mothers positive for both hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) have a 70 – 90 % chance of acquiring perinatal HBV infection...|$|R

40|$|Background: Most {{outbreaks}} of viral hepatitis in India {{are caused by}} hepatitis E. Recently in the year 2009, Modasa town of Sabarkantha district in Gujarat witnessed the outbreak of hepatitis B. Purpose: An {{attempt was made to}} study the outbreak clinically and serologically, to estimate the seropositivity of hepatitis B Virus among the cases and their contacts and to know the seroprevalence of hepatitis B envelope antigen (HBeAg) and IgM antibody against hepatitis B <b>core</b> antigen (<b>IgM</b> HBcAb) out of all the Hepatitis B surface Antigen (HBsAg) positive ones. Materials and Methods: Eight hundred and fifty-six (856) cases and 1145 contacts were evaluated for hepatitis B markers namely HBsAg, HBeAg and IgM HBcAb by enzyme-linked immuno Sorbent Assay (ELISA) test. Results: This outbreak of viral hepatitis B in Modasa, Gujarat was most likely due to unsafe injection practices. Evidence in support of this was collected by Government authorities. Most of the patients and approximately 40 % of the surveyed population gave history of injections in last 1. 5 - 6 months. Total 664 / 856 (77. 57 %) cases and 20 / 1145 (1. 75 %) contacts were found to be positive for HBsAg. 53. 41 % of the positive cases and 52. 93 % of the positive contacts were HBeAg-positive and thus in a highly infectious stage. Conclusions: Inadequately sterilized needles and syringes are an important cause of transmission of hepatitis B in India. Our data reflects the high positivity rate of a hepatitis B outbreak due to such unethical practices.

40|$|Abstract Chronic {{hepatitis}} B {{infection with}} the hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) -negative variant {{is associated with}} a severe clinical course and a low response rate to interferon (IFN). In an attempt to improve the chances of sustained response to interferon we designed a pilot study, using titres of IgM antibodies to hepatitis B <b>core</b> antigen (HBcAb <b>IgM)</b> to guide treatment initiation. Eighteen adults who were HBeAg-negative with biopsy-proven chronic active hepatitis (seven with cirrhosis) entered the study. They were followed-up bimonthly with routine liver function tests, and HBcAb IgM titres were also determined. Treatment (lymphoblastoid IFN 5 million units (MU) m(- 2) three times weekly for 6 months) was started when the HBcAb IgM titre was increasing. Fifteen (83. 3 %) patients had normal alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels and undetectable HBV DNA at the end of treatment. HBcAb IgM decreased in all responders. We observed a relapse in four patients (three with cirrhosis), in the first year after treatment, with an increase in ALT, HBV DNA and titre of HBcAb IgM. Eleven patients (61. 1 %) had a sustained response and eight of these 11 patients were followed-up for more than 18 months; two responders cleared hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg). Hence, the rate of sustained response to IFN in HBeAb-positive patients with chronic hepatitis is improved if treatment is started when HBcAb IgM levels are increasing...|$|R

Hepatitis D virus markers were present in twice as many patients positive for anti-HBc IgM requiring admission to hospital with acute hepatitis compared with outpatients attending a drug treatment centre. Tests on one patient showed complete disappearance of HBsAg, but hepatitis D antigen (HDAg or delta antigen) and hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) were still present in serum samples. All five patients with chronic active hepatitis had hepatitis D antibody (anti-HD) compared with seven of 24 (29 %) with chronic persistent hepatitis (p = 0. 008). Blocking anti-HD persisted for long periods after simultaneous infections with hepatitis B virus and hepatitis D virus but at lower titres than in patients with chronic liver disease...|$|R
40|$|In {{acute and}} chronic {{hepatitis}} B, antibodies of the immunoglobulin M (IgM) class against the hepatitis B <b>core</b> antigen (anti-HBc <b>IgM)</b> have been demonstrated. For {{the determination of}} anti-HBc IgM, a sensitive enzyme immunoassay with anti-mu-coated flat-bottomed microtiter plates is described and evaluated. The specificity of the anti-HBc IgM test system was proven by pretreatment of presumed anti-HBc IgM-positive samples with anti-mu to block anti-HBc IgM. The test system was highly sensitive. In the acute stage of hepatitis B, anti-HBc IgM could be demonstrated in serum dilutions up to 10 (- 7) (mean titer, 10 (- 5)), and in sera from patients with chronic hepatitis B, the mean titer was 10 (- 3). In a study of unselected patients whose sera were sent at irregular intervals for testing, anti-HBc IgM persisted in a high percentage (52 %) for at least 13 to 18 months after onset of illness {{despite the fact that}} these patients eliminated hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and produced antibodies to HBsAg (anti-HBs). By using the anti-HBc IgM test as an additional aid in the diagnosis of acute HBsAg-negative hepatitis, the hepatitis B etiology could be established in 13 of 42 patients (31. 4 %). Investigations of the prevalence of anti-HBc IgM in different groups of patients with chronic hepatitis B infection showed 89. 4 % anti-HBc IgM-positive results in patients with chronic active hepatitis B, 60 % in patients with HBsAg-negative chronic active hepatitis, 58. 2 % in patients with primary liver carcinoma and markers of hepatitis B infections, and 34. 9 % in healthy carriers of HBsAg...|$|R
40|$|The {{majority}} of patients with acute febrile jaundice (> 95 %) identified through a yellow fever surveillance program in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) test negative for antibodies against yellow fever virus. However, no etiological investigation has ever been carried out on these patients. Here, we tested for hepatitis A (HAV), hepatitis B (HBV), hepatitis C (HCV), hepatitis D (HDV), and hepatitis E (HEV) viruses, {{all of which can}} cause acute febrile jaundice, in patients included in the yellow fever surveillance program in the DRC. On a total of 498 serum samples collected from suspected cases of yellow fever from January 2003 to January 2012, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) techniques were used to screen for antibodies against HAV (IgM) and HEV (IgM) and for antigens and antibodies against HBV (HBsAg and anti-hepatitis B <b>core</b> protein [HBc] <b>IgM,</b> respectively), HCV, and HDV. Viral loads and genotypes were determined for HBV and HVD. Viral hepatitis serological markers were diagnosed in 218 (43. 7 %) patients. The seroprevalences were 16. 7 % for HAV, 24. 6 % for HBV, 2. 3 % for HCV, and 10. 4 % for HEV, and 26. 1 % of HBV-positive patients were also infected with HDV. Median viral loads were 4. 19 x 10 (5) IU/ml for HBV (range, 769 to 9. 82 x 10 (9) IU/ml) and 1. 4 x 10 (6) IU/ml for HDV (range, 3. 1 x 10 (2) to 2. 9 x 10 (8) IU/ml). Genotypes A, E, and D of HBV and genotype 1 of HDV were detected. These high hepatitis prevalence rates highlight the necessity to include screening for hepatitis viruses in the yellow fever surveillance program in the DRC...|$|R
