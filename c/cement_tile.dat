50|$|There are {{numerous}} <b>cement</b> <b>tile</b> manufacturers worldwide. The primary difference between manufacturers is the hydraulic method used. Small companies employ a hand-operated hydraulic press; {{the quality of}} the tiles varies due to inconsistent pressure. Larger manufacturers use electric-powered hydraulic presses that produce a consistently higher quality product. The higher pressure (1,500 PSI) permits a thicker pigment layer to be embedded into the cement layer. The pigment layer is usually 3-4 mm thick.|$|E

40|$|Este trabalho avaliou a eficiência de abrigos para bezerros, a partir de índices de conforto térmico (carga térmica radiante, índice de temperatura de globo e umidade e índice de globo negro), pela comparação entre abrigos cobertos por telha de cimento-amianto e telha de cimento- celulose. O experimento foi implantado num sistema de abrigos convencionais, tipo boxe, com cinco tratamentos: telhados de cimento-amianto, cimento-celulose, cimento-celulose pintado de branco e telhado duplo de cimento-celulose, todos expostos ao sol, e telhado de cimento-celulose em área sombreada. Foram {{realizadas}} cinco repetições (um bezerro por repetição), de setembro a novembro de 2002, em Pirassununga - SP. As variáveis fisiológicas registradas foram freqüência respiratória e temperatura retal. Os abrigos expostos ao sol e com telha de cimento-amianto apresentaram os índices menos satisfatórios quanto ao conforto térmico animal, em relação aos demais abrigos ao sol. Os abrigos com telhas de cimento-celulose e em área sombreada apresentaram os melhores índices de conforto térmico animal. Os resultados das variáveis fisiológicas foram melhores para o tratamento posicionado à sombra. Encontrou-se relação entre os resultados de conforto térmico e os fisiológicos, em especial para a freqüência respiratória. This {{work was}} focused in {{the efficiency of}} housing for calves, based on thermal comfort indexes (radiant thermal load, black globe humidity index and black globe index). It was compared animal housing covered with commercial corrugated sheets produced with asbestos cement and cellulose <b>cement</b> <b>tiles.</b> The experiment {{was carried out in}} a system of conventional housing, box type, with five treatments: roofs with asbestos <b>cement</b> <b>tiles,</b> cellulose <b>cement</b> <b>tiles,</b> cellulose <b>cement</b> painted <b>tiles</b> and double layer of <b>cement</b> cellulose <b>tiles,</b> all of them exposed to the sunlight and cement cellulose roof under shade. The experiment involved five replications (one calf per replication), during the spring time of 2002, in Pirassununga, State of São Paulo, Brazil. Physiological variables of thermoregulation (respiration rate and rectal temperature) were registered. The housing directly exposed to the sunlight and covered with asbestos cement sheets presented the less satisfactory results for the animal thermal comfort in comparison with the other treatments also exposed to the sun. The housing covered with cellulose <b>cement</b> <b>tiles</b> under shade showed the best results of thermal comfort. The results of the physiological variables were significantly better for the treatment positioned under shade. A satisfactory relation between the thermal comfort indexes and the physiological results (especially respiration rate) were found for the conditions of the present work...|$|R
50|$|Light Timber Construction schools, as {{the name}} suggests, were {{constructed}} using wooden framing. External walls are either clad in timber, sheet metal, brick, or <b>cement</b> <b>tile</b> (the most common option). Rooftops were always clad with corrugated iron, and supported by zig-zag steel rafters. LTC schools were always built as a single storey. Where multiple school wings were required, buildings were often linked with an iron covered-way {{in the case of}} primary schools, or a link corridor in the case of high schools.|$|E

5000|$|They {{are mostly}} known {{throughout}} the world as encaustic <b>cement</b> <b>tile.</b> Like their predecessors, encaustic clay tiles, they derive their name from the term [...] "encaustic" [...] which is an art term used for metal enameling that uses a type of lost wax procedure. They have this name because of the intricate patterns and designs that mimic the encaustic enameling process. Cement tiles are not fired; there is no glaze layer {{on the surface of}} the tile. They derive their durability from the combination of finely dehydrated ground Portland cement layer and a more coarse layer of sand and cement. The pigment layer is hydraulically pressed into the surface and becomes a part of the tile.|$|E

50|$|Sardar Rais Ghazi Mohammad Indhar, client, designer, patron and {{landlord}} conceived, {{directed and}} funded the entire building construction. The construction of mosque {{was carried out}} by specialists gathered from all over Pakistan and India: master masons from Rajisthan, India; craftsmen from Multan for the glazed tile, mosaic and woodwork; and painters and calligraphers from Karachi. Workshops were set up to train craftsmen in skills that had originally been passed from father to son. Materials and crafts used range from the traditional - teak, ivory, marble, colored glass, onyx, glazed tile, fresco, mirrors, gilded tracery, ceramics, calligraphy and inlay - to the modern and synthetic marbled industrial tile, artificial stone facing, terrazzo, colored <b>cement</b> <b>tile</b> and wrought iron. Sardar Rais Ghazi's intention was to represent as many forms of popular craft and as many Islamic religious architectural features as possible.There has been a recent addition to the mosque. A white marbled Quran has been constructed right outside the veranda.|$|E

40|$|The {{friction}} coefficient of rubber sliding against {{different types of}} flooring materials of different surface roughness was investigated under different sliding conditions: dry, water, water/detergent dilution, oil, water/oil dilution. The flooring materials are parquet, polyvinyl chloride (PVC), epoxy, marble, cement and ceramic. Surface roughness variations do take place by continuous rubbing during the life time of the flooring. Based on the experiments, it was found out that at dry sliding, {{friction coefficient}} decreased with increasing surface roughness. Epoxy displayed relatively higher friction than parquet and PVC, while <b>cement</b> <b>tiles</b> gave the highest friction coefficient. Ceramic showed relatively lower friction values than marble and cement. In the presence {{of water on the}} sliding surface, friction coefficient slightly increased up to maximum then decreased with increasing surface roughness. Parquet displayed the highest friction coefficient followed by PVC and epoxy. At higher roughness marble tiles gave the highest friction. Ceramic showed the lowest friction among the tested floorings. Sliding of rubber against water/detergent wetted tiles caused drastic decrease of friction coefficient. Parquet displayed the highest friction values followed by cement and marble. PVC, epoxy and ceramic represented relatively lower friction values. At oil lubricated sliding of flooring materials, friction coefficient slightly increased up to maximum then decreased with increasing surface roughness of the flooring materials. Hard floorings such as marble and ceramic showed friction increase with increasing surface roughness. Parquet and <b>cement</b> <b>tiles</b> showed the relatively highest friction. Finally, sliding of rubber against water/oil dilution wetted floorings caused significant decrease in friction coefficient. Parquet and <b>cement</b> <b>tiles</b> still displayed the highest friction...|$|R
50|$|The {{introduction}} of plastic tile served to reduce both {{the cost of}} tile installation, {{as well as the}} amount of labor involved. Rather than set individual sections of <b>cement</b> <b>tile</b> end-to-end in the trench, tile installers had only to unroll a continuous section of lightweight, flexible tile line. Towards {{the end of the twentieth}} century, when large, four-wheel-drive tractors became more common on American farms, do-it-yourself tile implements appeared on the market. By making tile installation cheaper and allowing it to be done on the landowner's schedule, farmers are capable of draining localized wet spots that may not create enough of a problem to merit more costly operations. In this way, farmers may enjoy increases in crop yield while saving on the capital costs of tile installation. Perhaps the most useful implement in drainage history was James B. Hill's Buckeye Traction Ditcher, which laid drainage tiles at a record pace. Hill's ditching machine drained the Great Black Swamp in Ohio, vast stretches of Louisiana, and Florida's swampland.|$|E
5000|$|The Victorian Education Department {{anticipated}} {{an increasing}} demand for technical school education in areas surrounding Dandenong when {{it decided to}} establish Doveton Technical School {{at the beginning of}} 1963. Temporarily housed in Dandenong Technical School, Doveton began with 115 boys in Form 1. The new school, built in <b>cement</b> <b>tile</b> veneer on the 14.5 acre site in Box St, became available at the beginning of 1964. The Principal W.J.H. Smith was joined by a staff of six. The Parents' Association formed in early 2010 was led by Mrs W. Montagne as President and Mrs B. King as Secretary. The Chief Inspector of Technical Schools, J.L. Kepert. attended the inaugural meeting of the Advisory Council when Cr G.F. Knowles was elected President. On 5 April 1968 the Minister, the Hon. L.H.S. Thompson, MLC, officially opened the school of which the first three stages had been completed. Enrolments from 1963 to 1968 included students from Doveton, the area E of the Frankston-Dandenong Rd, Narre Warren North, Beaconsfield, Pakenham East, Koo-Wee-Rup, Korumburra, Lang Lang and Cranbourne. Subsidised bus services, trains and school buses from Dandenong Railway Station brought children to Doveton. In 1967 girls courses at Form 1 level were introduced. The previous Doveton Campus, or Doveton Secondary College officially closed down 1 December 2008. Doveton Campus students joined students on the Dandenong Site {{for the remainder of the}} 2008 school year. [...] The buildings on the Doveton Campus have now been demolished. A new government P-9 school, Doveton College, opened in 2012 1.5 km east of the old Doveton SC location.|$|E
