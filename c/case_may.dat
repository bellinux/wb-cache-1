5|$|These speculations {{cannot be}} proven without doubt {{but as a}} governor, Odaenathus {{would have been the}} highest {{authority}} in the province and above any legionary commander and provincial officials; this would make him the commander of the Roman forces in the province. Whatever the <b>case</b> <b>may</b> be, starting from 258, Odaenathus strengthened his position and extended his political influence in the region. By 260, Odaenathus held the rank, credibility and power to pacify the Roman east following the Battle of Edessa.|$|E
5|$|If {{an offense}} is filed, the issue may be {{investigated}} by police on duty. Permission for {{search and seizure}} is issued by the police prosecutor on duty at the police district. Apprehended people are permitted a free defense counsel at the public's expense. If the police wish to keep apprehended people in detention, the issue is brought to the relevant district court, a process which may be repeated several times if the custody needs to be extended. Investigations are led by a police prosecutor. During investigation, the <b>case</b> <b>may</b> be concluded as a non-criminal offense, dismissed, or transferred to another police district. Minor cases with a positive finding may be resolved by police penalty notice, settlement by a conflict resolution board and withdrawal of prosecution.|$|E
5|$|An error as to a {{precedent}} fact, if committed, deprives the public authority {{of power to}} take the action or make the decision in question. The existence or non-existence of the fact, as the <b>case</b> <b>may</b> be, is a condition precedent or prerequisite to the exercise of the power. An example of an error of this nature {{can be found in}} the United Kingdom case White & Collins v. Minister of Health (1939). In that case, under the relevant statute, the authority could only issue a compulsory purchase order affecting the applicants' land if it was not part of, among other things, a park. A minister confirmed the purchase order but the Court of Appeal of England and Wales held that it should be quashed, finding that the minister could not exercise power to acquire the land since it was part of a park. Whether the land was or was not a park was {{a precedent}} fact, and the minister had committed an error concerning this fact.|$|E

5|$|The {{earliest}} animal-pollinated {{flowers were}} shallow, cup-shaped blooms pollinated by insects such as beetles, so the syndrome of insect pollination was well established {{before the first}} appearance of bees. The novelty is that bees are specialized as pollination agents, with behavioral and physical modifications that specifically enhance pollination, and are the most efficient pollinating insects. In a process of coevolution, flowers developed floral rewards such as nectar and longer tubes, and bees developed longer tongues to extract the nectar. Bees also developed structures known as scopal hairs and pollen baskets to collect and carry pollen. The location and type differ among and between groups of bees. Most bees have scopal hairs located on their hind legs or {{on the underside of}} their abdomens, some bees in the family Apidae possess pollen baskets on their hind legs while very few species lack these entirely and instead collect pollen in their crops. This drove the adaptive radiation of the angiosperms, and, in turn, the bees themselves. Bees have not only coevolved with flowers but it is believed that some bees have coevolved with mites. Some bees provide tufts of hairs called acarinaria that appear to provide lodgings for mites; in return, it is believed that the mites eat fungi that attack pollen, so the relationship in this <b>case</b> <b>may</b> be mutualistc.|$|E
5|$|Upon Carroll's {{return to}} Maryland, Hart was incensed {{both at the}} threat to his own power {{and the idea of}} a Catholic officeholder in the colony. Hart demanded that Carroll take the oath of allegiance, which he was willing to do, and the oath of abjuration {{confirming}} the Protestant succession to the English throne, which Carroll was not willing to do. Carroll began to act in the capacity authorized by the proprietor's commission, and Hart turned to the upper house of the colonial legislature for relief. Rejecting Carroll's arguments in support of his right to hold government offices, the assembly resisted his attempts to exercise the commission and, near the end of 1716, passed a series of laws confirming and restricting the oath requirements for officeholders, which were anti-Catholic by intent. Carroll's <b>case</b> <b>may</b> have been undermined {{when he came to the}} defense of his nephew, who had raised a toast to the Catholic James Stuart. Stuart had tried to take the British throne during a rebellion in 1715 and was extremely unpopular with Protestants in the colony. The proprietor, whose position had been so recently restored and who did not want to risk the loss of the colony, confirmed the decision of the assembly. Carroll's commission was formally revoked on 20 February 1717. According to a later account Hart gave to the assembly, Carroll began a campaign to undermine the Governor. There is no evidence that Hart was accurate, but the assembly passed stricter anti-Catholic laws in 1718, including disfranchisement, stripping Catholic males of the right to vote.|$|E
