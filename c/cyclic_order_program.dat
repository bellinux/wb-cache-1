The relation Co will be said to be an extended <b>cyclic</b> <b>order</b> (corresponding to the <b>cyclic</b> <b>order</b> C). It is clear that C and Co are uniquely determined by each other.

If, moreover, G is a group such that the group operation is compatible with the relation Co, then (G, +, Co) will be called an ec-group. The present paper deals with subdirect product decompositions of ec-sets and direct product decompositions of ec-groups. 1.
