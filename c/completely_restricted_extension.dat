MATERIAL AND METHODS: We reviewed with an average follow up of 36 months 22 patients (22 elbows) who had been treated conservatively after a first episode of posterior dislocation of the elbow. RESULTS: Nineteen patients (86 %) reported an excellent or a good subjective result, although 64 % suffered occasionally from pain. None had presented a recurrent dislocation. At physical examination, 27 % had a <b>restricted</b> <b>extension</b> of the elbow of 10 degrees and more, and 27 % {{had some kind of}} chronic laxity. Fifty percent had modifications visible on the X-rays. We found no correlation between laxity and duration of immobilization. At contrary, patients who were immobilized for a longer time than 3 weeks suffered more often of a painful <b>restricted</b> <b>extension</b> of the elbow. DISCUSSION: Conservative management of posterior dislocation of the elbow has a good prognosis. Occasional pain and chronic laxity are often present but well supported.

The foundation for the development of ethical guidelines to protect this population comes from the exploitation of vulnerable populations including prisoners in the Holocaust, totalitarian regimes, and even in countries with long histories of democracy. The main ethical issues relevant to research with prisoners are respect for persons, justice, and the theory of Utilitarianism. Within the ethical guidelines there is a conflict between protecting prisoners from exploitation in research and prisoners right to participate in research.

PIK is interest accruing period after period, thus increasing the underlying principal (i.e., compound interest).
