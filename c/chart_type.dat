40|$|Background: Spectra {{visualisation}} from {{methods such as}} mass spectroscopy, {{infrared spectroscopy}} or nuclear magnetic resonance {{is an essential part}} of every web-facing spectral resource. The development of an intuitive and versatile visualisation tool is a time- and resource-intensive task, however, most databases use their own embedded viewers and new databases continue to develop their own viewers. Results: We present SpeckTackle, a custom-tailored JavaScript charting library for spectroscopy in life sciences. SpeckTackle is cross-browser compatible and easy to integrate into existing resources, as we demonstrate for the MetaboLights database. Its default <b>chart</b> <b>types</b> cover common visualisation tasks following the de facto ‘look and feel’ standards for spectra visualisation. Conclusions: SpeckTackle is released under GNU LGPL to encourage uptake and reuse within the community. The latest version of the library including examples and documentation on how to use and extend the library with additional <b>chart</b> <b>types</b> is available online in its public repository...|$|R

5000|$|The {{control limits}} for this <b>chart</b> <b>type</b> are [...] where [...] is the {{estimate}} of the long-term process mean established during control-chart setup. Naturally, if the lower control limit is {{less than or equal}} to zero, process observations only need be plotted against the upper control limit. Note that observations of proportion nonconforming below a positive lower control limit are cause for concern as they are more frequently evidence of improperly calibrated test and inspection equipment or inadequately trained inspectors than of sustained quality improvement.|$|E

Analytical tools will provide statistical information analysis of the global terrorist network. The researcher will be able to analyze terrorism trends over time and to compare different aspects of terrorism between countries, regions and terrorist groups (for example: type of terrorist attacks, level of organization, tactics, communication level, size of a terrorist group, age or race of its members, and many others). The results of statistical analysis will be presented graphically in various charts, showing the dependencies and/or the comparisons of the chosen aspects. The <b>chart</b> <b>type</b> can also be chosen by the user.|$|E

As the 1990s wore on, several of Roadrunner's bands managed {{to make an impact}} on the mainstream, most notably Sepultura and Type O Negative. Sepultura's 1993 album, Chaos A.D., became the first Roadrunner band to crack the Top 40 on the Billboard album <b>chart.</b> <b>Type</b> O Negative became the first Roadrunner band to receive a certification from the RIAA; this was a Gold award (and later Platinum award) for the 1993 album Bloody Kisses, which was certified in 1995. The band also became the first Roadrunner band to receive radio play. In 2000, Slipknot became the first Roadrunner band to go Platinum. Nickelback were also very successful on the label (except they were on another label at home in Canada). Derek Shulman ran the label in the late '90s.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: A new {{approach}} to production process monitoring in organization using control <b>chart</b> <b>type</b> X-R has been presented. Design/methodology/approach: The possibility of use of basic element of Statistical Process Control (SPC method) is connected with continuous quality improvement of each production process in an enterprise. Interdependence of the quality research methods and production process’s requirements have been taken into account. Findings: At the present time the metallurgical enterprises should integrate quality management system and quality control with customer’s requirements, with defined both parameters of processes and quality methods. Such kind of strategy will enable to achieve success for these companies. Research limitations/implications: Control <b>chart</b> <b>type</b> X-R is very important quality tool. Its determined statistical measures are recorded properties of product obtained {{as a result of}} inspections taking randomly samples of products in the determined place of the process. Aim of control <b>chart</b> <b>type</b> X-R is observation and registration of the changeability of the characteristic of the researched element of the production process. Practical implications: The example of implementing control <b>chart</b> <b>type</b> X-R shows possibility of monitoring chosen parameters of production process according to an idea of defect prevention. Usage of this method allows for monitoring of production process, providing opportunities for cost reduction, and maintaining of production process stability. Originality/value: Application of basic element of Statistical Process Control in polish metallurgical companies have been presented...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—We study {{transmissions}} in multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) {{systems with}} antenna correlation. We focus on joint {{forward error correction}} (FEC) encoder and linear precoder design based on channel covariance information at the transmitter (CCIT). We aim to optimize the system performance using the extrinsic information transfer (EXIT) <b>chart</b> <b>type</b> curve matching principle. By adopting a Hadamard precoding technique, we show that, the EXIT <b>chart</b> <b>type</b> curve of the precoded system is asymptotically determined by the channel correlation matrix at the transmitter {{as the number of}} receive antennas tends to infinity. The encoder-precoder curve matching can be made asymptotically accurate even in the lack of full channel state information at the transmitter (CSIT). Excellent performance based on this strategy is demonstrated by simulation results in systems with only a moderately large number of receive antennas.

In addition to stable traits such as locus of control, research in psychology has found that temporary changes in affect (emotion) can significantly impact individual performance on cognitive tasks. We {{examine the relationship between}} fundamental visual judgement tasks and affect through a crowdsourced user study that combines affectivepriming techniques from psychology with longstanding graphical perception experiments. Our results suggest that affective-priming can significantly influence accuracy in visual judgements, and that some <b>chart</b> <b>types</b> may be more affected than others. ...|$|R

40|$|Background: The {{utility of}} {{statistical}} process control (SPC) methods has received growing interest in the healthcare community to help improve clinical and administrative processes. SPC charts are chronological graphs of process data {{that are used in}} many other industries to help understand, control, and improve processes and that, although based in statistical theory, are easy for practitioners to use and interpret. Objectives: The objective {{of this article is to}} provide an overview of SPC charts, the differ-ent types and uses of control charts, when to use each <b>chart</b> <b>type,</b> their statistical performance, and simple methods for determining appropriate sample sizes. The intended audience in-cludes practitioners and healthcare researchers seeking either an introduction to these meth-ods or further insight into their design and performance. Methods for dealing with rare events and low occurrence rates also are discussed. Methods: Recent empirical examples are used to illustrate appropriate applications of each <b>chart</b> <b>type,</b> sample size determination, and chart performance. Sensitivities are calculated and tabulated for a wide range of scenarios to aid practitioners in designing control charts wit...|$|E
