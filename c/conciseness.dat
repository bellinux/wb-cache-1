This will usually require a trade-offnbsp&— where one factor is optimized at the expense of others. For example, increasing the size of cache improves runtime performance, but also increases the memory consumption. Other common trade-offs include code clarity and <b>conciseness.</b>|$|E
25|$|Thomas Sprat {{wrote his}} History of the Royal Society in 1667 and set forth, {{in a single}} document, the goals of {{empirical}} science ever after. He expressed grave suspicions of adjectives, nebulous terminology, and all language that might be subjective. He praised a spare, clean, and precise vocabulary for science and explanations that are as comprehensible as possible. In Sprat's account, the Royal Society explicitly rejected anything that seemed like scholasticism. For Sprat, as {{for a number of}} the founders of the Royal Society, science was Protestant: its reasons and explanations had to be comprehensible to all. There would be no priests in science, and anyone could reproduce the experiments and hear their lessons. Similarly, he emphasised the need for <b>conciseness</b> in description, as well as reproducibility of experiments.|$|E
500|$|Soon after {{arriving}} in England, H.D. showed Pound some poems she had written. Pound {{had already begun to}} meet with other poets at the Eiffel Tower restaurant in Soho. He was impressed by the closeness of her poems to the ideas and principles he had been discussing with Aldington, with whom he had shared plans to reform contemporary poetry through free verse, the tanka and the tightness and <b>conciseness</b> of the haiku, and the removal of all unnecessary verbiage. In summer 1912, the three poets declared themselves the [...] "three original Imagists", and set out their principles as: ...|$|E

2500|$|Law of Good Gestalt—The law of good gestalt {{explains}} that elements of objects {{tend to be}} perceptually grouped together if they form a pattern that is regular, simple, and orderly. This law implies that as individuals perceive the world, they eliminate complexity and unfamiliarity so they can observe a reality in its most simplistic form. [...] Eliminating extraneous stimuli helps the mind create meaning. [...] This meaning created by perception implies a global regularity, which is often mentally prioritized over spatial relations. The law of good gestalt focuses {{on the idea of}} <b>conciseness,</b> which is what all of gestalt theory is based on. This law has also been called the law of Prägnanz. [...] Prägnanz is a German word that directly translates to mean [...] "pithiness" [...] and implies the ideas of salience, <b>conciseness</b> and orderliness.|$|E

2500|$|Italian {{journalist}} Tiziano Terzani and Ryszard Kapuściński {{shared a}} similar vision of journalism. [...] Jaime Abello Banfi, the friend and associate of Gabriel GarcíaMárquez, reports that GarcíaMárquez and Kapuściński, unbeknownst to each other, shared {{the opinion that}} the way to good journalism led through poetry (on account {{of the fact that it}} inculcates both the <b>conciseness</b> of expression and its aptness).|$|E
2500|$|His {{influence}} was derived {{primarily from the}} following elements of his writing: his skillful depiction of historical characters using details of their speech, conversations, and actions; his innovative use of informal, humorous, and varied language; and the simplicity and <b>conciseness</b> of his style.

2500|$|Because, {{like the}} {{standard}} Japanese {{from which it}} partly derives, JSL is strongly influenced by the complex Japanese writing system, it dedicates {{particular attention to the}} written language and includes elements specifically designed to express kanji in signs. For either <b>conciseness</b> or disambiguation, particular signs are associated with certain commonly used kanji, place names, and sometimes surnames. [...] (tracing kanji in the air) is also sometimes used for last names or place names, just as it is in spoken Japanese.|$|E
2500|$|Stalin {{had a soft}} voice, {{and when}} {{speaking}} Russian he did so slowly, carefully choosing his phrasing. Although he avoided doing so in public, in private Stalin used coarse language. Described as a poor orator, according to Volkogonov, Stalin's speaking style was [...] "simple and clear, without flights of fancy, catchy phrases or platform histrionics". He rarely spoke before large audiences, and preferred to express himself in written form. His writing style was similar, being characterised by its simplicity, clarity, and <b>conciseness.</b>|$|E
2500|$|After {{demobilisation}} {{from the}} forces, Culshaw joined the Decca recording company in November 1946, writing musical analyses and biographies of recording artists for Decca's classical albums. His first book, a short biography of Rachmaninov, {{was published in}} 1949 and was well received. The critic of The Times praised it for its discriminating judgment, <b>conciseness</b> and discretion. It was followed by two further books; a popular introduction to concertos (The Concerto [...] in [...] "The World of Music" [...] series in 1949), and a guide to modern music (A Century of Music in 1952).|$|E
2500|$|The Kirātārjunīya is {{the only}} known work of Bharavi. It [...] "is {{regarded}} {{to be the most}} powerful poem in the Sanskrit language". A. K. Warder considers it the [...] "most perfect epic available to us", over Aśvaghoṣa's Buddhacarita, noting its greater force of expression, with more concentration and polish in every detail. Despite using extremely difficult language and rejoicing in the finer points of Sanskrit grammar, Bharavi achieves <b>conciseness</b> and directness. His alliteration, [...] "crisp texture of sound", and choice of metre closely correspond to the narrative.|$|E
2500|$|The catechetical {{instructions}} of Saint Thomas Aquinas {{were used}} generally throughout the 13th and 14th centuries as manuals and textbooks for priests and teachers of religion. [...] "The Explanations of St. Thomas," [...] wrote Spirago, [...] "are remarkable for their <b>conciseness</b> and their simplicity of language; they are especially noteworthy because the main {{parts of the}} catechetical course of instruction are brought into connection with one another so that they appear as one harmonious whole." [...] The influence of these works is especially prominent in the [...] "Roman Catechism" [...] which the Council of Trent ordered written for parish priests and for all teachers of religion. Many of the explanatory passages in both works are almost identical.|$|E
2500|$|Meshullam was a {{prolific}} liturgical poet. Of the piyyutim {{contained in the}} kerobah of the [...] "Shacharit" [...] service of the Day of Atonement, at least twenty (possibly thirty-two) belong to him. He wrote also: an [...] "'Avodah," [...] recited after the prayer for the synagogue reader and containing a cursory review of Biblical history from Adam down to Levi; a yoẓer for Passover; and two zulot. Altogether thirty-eight piyyuṭim are attributed to him. Although their language is labored, they are distinguished by their elevation of thought and <b>conciseness.</b> There was another payyeṭan called [...] "Meshullam the Great," [...] to whom probably belongs the Aramaic poetical Targum on the Decalogue which is generally attributed to Meshullam the Great ben Kalonymus (comp. Landshuth, [...] "'Ammude ha-'Abodah," [...] s.v.).|$|E
2500|$|Hard Times, {{which shows}} Manchester (the satirical Coketown) in a {{negative}} light, challenged Gaskell and made the writing of her own novel more difficult; she had to ascertain that Dickens would not write about a strike. Gaskell found the time and technical constraints of serialised fiction particularly trying. She had planned to write 22 episodes, but was [...] "compelled to desperate compression" [...] to limit the story to 20. [...] North and South was less successful than Hard Times. On 14 October 1854, after six weeks, sales dropped so much that Dickens complained about what he called Gaskell's [...] "intractability" [...] because she resisted his demands for <b>conciseness.</b> He found the story [...] "wearisome to the last degree" [...] (Chapman 1999, p.28).|$|E
2500|$|One {{reviewer}} profiled Ford herself: [...] "Mrs Ford is an Eastern {{woman by}} birth, {{and has spent}} a great deal of her life in Boston, where she is well known and esteemed for her superior capabilities. … She possesses one of the finest libraries west of the Mississippi, which is rich in art works, rare translations from the Sanscrit, and the choicest editions of the poets. Her education is thorough to a remarkable degree… Aside from her literary ability, Mrs. Ford is a practical newspaper woman, and can pen a political editorial with the crisp <b>conciseness</b> of a vertebral chief-of-staff. When that historical attempt to run all the emancipated slaves into Kansas was made, Mrs. Ford accepted a commission from the New York Tribune to investigate the matter, and her series of caustic and exhaustive letters attained a national importance." ...|$|E
2500|$|Stukeley {{examined}} the text {{for years before}} reading {{his analysis of the}} work and its itineraries before the Society of Antiquaries in 1756 and publishing its itineraries in 1757. He was excited that the text provided [...] "more than a hundred names of cities, roads, people, and the like: which till now were absolutely unknown to us" [...] and found it written [...] "with great judgment, perspicuity, and <b>conciseness,</b> as by one that was altogether master of his subject". His account of the itineraries included a new engraving, reorienting Bertram's map to place north at the top. Later in 1757, at Stukeley's urging, Bertram published the full text in a volume alongside Gildas's Ruin of Britain and the History of the Britons traditionally ascribed to Nennius. Bertram's preface noted that the work [...] "contains many fragments of a better time, which would now in vain be sought for elsewhere". The preface goes on to note that, [...] "considered by Dr.Stukeley... a jewel... worthy to be rescued from destruction", Bertram printed it [...] "from respect for him". This volume's map was the earlier one and Stukeley later employed it for his own [...] published posthumously in 1776.|$|E

The weariness faded out of it, and once more she recognized the alert, resourceful, and quietly resolute Larry she had known before the troubles came. He turned swiftly and clasped her hand.|$|E
60|$|I was {{positively}} blinded. I could hardly read the note, a neatly written little square sheet of paper; {{and the words}} seemed to swim before my eyes. It was in the very thick of summer term, and I, Cyril Payne, M.A., Senior Proctor of the University of Oxford, was calmly asked to undertake the sole charge for a week of a wild American girl, travelling alone, and probably expecting me to run about with her just as foolishly as I had done at Nice. There it lay before me, that awful note, in its overwhelming <b>conciseness,</b> without hope of respite or interference. It was simply crushing.|$|E
60|$|Far Eastern {{pictures}} are epigrams rather than descriptions. They present {{a bit of}} nature with the terseness of a maxim of La Rochefoucault, and they delight as aphorisms do by their insight and the happy <b>conciseness</b> of its expression. Few aphorisms are absolutely true, but then boldness more than makes up for what they lack in verity. So complex a subject is life that to state a truth with all its accompanying limitations is to weaken it at once. Exceptions, while demonstrating the rule, do not tend to emphasize it. And though the whole truth is essential to science, such exhaustiveness {{is by no means}} a canon of art.|$|E

6000|$|In 1727 Ephraim Chambers, a Westmoreland Quaker, {{published}} in London two folios, entitled, a Cyclopædia or Universal Dictionary of the Arts and Sciences. The {{idea of it}} was broad and excellent. [...] "Our view," [...] says Chambers, [...] "was to consider the several matters, not only in themselves, but relatively, or as they respect each other; both to treat them as so many wholes, and as so many parts of some greater whole." [...] The compiler lacked the grasp necessary to realise this laudable purpose. The book has, however, the merit of <b>conciseness,</b> and is a singular monument of literary industry, for it was entirely compiled by Chambers himself. It had a great success, and though its price was high (four guineas), it ran through five editions in eighteen years. On the whole, however, it is meagre, {{and more like a}} dictionary than an encyclopædia, such as Alsted's for instance.|$|E
6000|$|The use {{of novel}} and piquant forms of speech {{is one of}} the most obvious of Stevenson's devices. No man handles his {{adjectives}} with greater judgment and nicer discrimination.

[...] It is dangerous to begin quoting, as the examples are interminable, and each suggests another. Now and then he misses his mark, but it is very seldom. As an example, an [...] "eye-shot" [...] does not commend itself as a substitute for [...] "a glance," [...] and [...] "to tee-hee" [...] for [...] "to giggle" [...] grates somewhat upon the ear, though the authority of Chaucer might be cited for the expressions.|$|E

60|$|This I {{might have}} done in prose, but I chose verse, and even rhyme, for two reasons. The one will appear obvious; that principles, maxims, or precepts so written, both strike the reader more {{strongly}} at first, and are more easily retained by him afterwards: The other may seem odd, but is true, I found I could express them more shortly this way than in prose itself; and nothing is more certain, than {{that much of the}} force as well as grace of arguments or instructions, depends on their <b>conciseness.</b> I was unable to treat this part of my subject more in detail, without becoming dry and tedious; or more poetically, without sacrificing perspicuity to ornament, without wandring from the precision, or breaking the chain of reasoning: If any man can unite all these without diminution of any of them, I freely confess he will compass a thing above my capacity.|$|E
