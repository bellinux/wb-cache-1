40|$|The {{mechanical}} and electric fields in a piezoelectric material around an elliptical <b>cylinder</b> <b>cavity</b> and the electric field within the cavity are formulated by complex potentials. The electric field inside the cavity is uniform and {{varies with the}} shape of the ellipse. When the cavity is reduced to a slit crack, the electric field strength inside the cavity is inversely proportional to the permittivity of the cavity. When the ratio of the short semi-axis of the ellipse over the long semi-axis is much smaller than the ratio of the permittivity of the cavity over that of the material, it can be used as the electric boundary condition that the electric field strength along the crack faces equals the remote one. In this case, the energy release rate for crack propagation depends only on the applied stress and can be represented in terms of the stress intensity factor as in a pure elastic body without coupling with the electric field. Electric loading may promote or retard crack propagation depending on whether it increases or decreases the applied stress...|$|E
40|$|Solid/liquid {{phase change}} process has {{received}} great attention for its capability to obtain high energy storage efficiency. In order to analyze these systems, undergoing a solid/liquid phase change, {{in many situations}} the heat transfer process can be considered conduction-dominated. However, in the past years, {{it has been shown}} that natural convection in the liquid phase can significantly influence the phase change process in terms of temperature distributions, interface displacement and energy storage. In this paper, a procedure to analyze systems undergoing liquid/solid phase change in presence of natural convection in the liquid phase based on the utilisation of a commercial computer code (FLUENT), has been developed. This procedure is applied to the study of a <b>cylinder</b> <b>cavity</b> heated from above and filled with a phase change material. It was found that when the coupling with the environment, even if small, is considered, natural convection in the liquid phase occurs.

40|$|Analytical {{solutions}} for an elliptical <b>cylinder</b> <b>cavity</b> or a crack inside an infinite piezoelectric medium under combined mechanical-electrical loadings are formulated via the Stroh formalism and well confirmed by finite element analysis. The {{results show that}} the stress and electric fields {{in the vicinity of the}} crack tip are, in general, determined by a complex vector of intensity factors. The complex vector of intensity factors may reduce to be real under certain circumstances. For a vacuum crack, the electric field inside the crack in the direction perpendicular to the crack magnifies the corresponding applied electric field by more than 1000 times. In this case, the electric field strength in the material has a finite value at the crack tip, but the electric displacement approaches infinity at the crack tip due to the piezoelectricity. The self-consistent analysis is developed to determine the deformed crack profile. The energy release rate for the cavity propagation is formulated under the condition that the ratio of the minor semi-axis to the major semi-axis of the ellipse remains unchanged. For an insulating crack, the applied electric field contributes nothing to the energy release rate when the undeformed crack profile is used, while the electric field resists crack propagation when the deformed crack profile is used. For a conducting slit crack, the energy release rate is independent of the applied electric field perpendicular to the crack, and is enhanced by the applied electric field parallel to the crack.

Without any loss of generality, we solve the problem for cylindrical cavity in metal. The task exceeds evidently standard scalar theory of diffraction, thus we solve the problem using a waveguiding theory. Following {{the principles of the}} electromagnetic theory, we derive required formulae to determine mode distribution at the entry of the cavity. Further, we solve numerically the radiation propagation through the cavity, then we actually seek for radiation distribution {{at the very end of}} the cavity. This yields, with a help of the discrete Fourier transform, an intensity distribution of Fraunhofer diffraction pattern, consequently compared with an intesity distribution of the radiation pattern of Fraunhofer diffraction on infinitely thin circular opening having the radius of the <b>cylinder</b> <b>cavity</b> under study. A comparison of such patterns results to a conclusion, that the cavity length has a significatn influence on the diffraction pattern and more importantly, that the scalar diffraction theory appears incorrect for a coherent light passage through cavities longer than their radius squared. Similarly, the same conclusion is inversely proportional to a wavelength of the interacting radiation. Finally, we mention an existence of the so called "focal regime", when the radiation repeatedly exhibits roughly one order increased intensity on the symmetry axis of the cavity...|$|E

It uses auxiliary RF deflecting cavities to rotate the bunches by an angle {{equal to the}} crossing angle {{so that they can}} collide head-on. For DAΦNE, this might be an OPTION for future luminosity upgrading. We show the general design criteria for the optimization of the cavity profile and a full comparison of two possible shapes with the present Cornell design for the B-Factory[2]. In this study no care was taken of the actual cavity location, since it is assumed that the relevant changes to the machine layout will be made possible, as soon as the need for crab crossing is recognized.

40|$|International audienceIn cyanobacteria, {{photoprotection}} from overexcitation of photochemical centers can {{be obtained}} by excitation energy dissipation {{at the level of the}} phycobilisome (PBS), the cyanobacterial antenna, induced by the orange carotenoid protein (OCP). A single photoactivated OCP bound to the core of the PBS affords almost total energy dissipation. The precise mechanism of OCP energy dissipation is yet to be fully determined, and one question is how the carotenoid can approach any core phycocyanobilin chromophore at a distance that can promote efficient energy quenching. We have performed intersubunit cross-linking using glutaraldehyde of the OCP and PBS followed by liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS-MS) to identify cross-linked residues. The only residues of the OCP that cross-link with the PBS are situated in the linker region, between the N- and C-terminal domains and a single C-terminal residue. These links have enabled us to construct a model of the site of OCP binding that differs from previous models. We suggest that the N-terminal domain of the OCP burrows tightly into the PBS while leaving the OCP C-terminal domain on the exterior of the complex. Further analysis shows that the position of the small core linker protein ApcC is shifted within the <b>cylinder</b> <b>cavity,</b> serving to stabilize the interaction between the OCP and the PBS. This is confirmed by a ΔApcC mutant.

40|$|Abstract — This paper {{presents}} an RF airflow sensor {{based on an}} evanescent-mode cavity resonator. The frequency loading is achieved by a capacitive post {{in the center of}} a <b>cylinder</b> <b>cavity.</b> As a sensing mechanism, an elastic membrane with a sensing beam is utilized to generate a strain on the top of the cavity. The airflow deflects the sensing beam, changing the parasitic capacitance of the cavity and hence, the resonant frequency of the resonator. The cavity resonator is fabricated by micro-molding of thermal-plastic polymers enabling a low cost batch fabrication. The coplanar waveguide (CPW) feeding structure is formed simultaneously during the molding process by using a metal transfer technique. The resonant frequency of the resonator as a function of the sensing beam deflection angle is demonstrated, and a wind tunnel test is performed to demonstrate an equivalent sensitivity of 0. 36 GHz/(m/s) for the air flow velocity measurement. Index Terms — evanescent-mode, cavity resonators, airflow, CPW, micro-molding. evanescent-mode cavity resonator. A CPW feeding structure on the bottom of the cavity is utilized to excite the cavity resonance. The simplicity of the feeding structures enables easy integration of the sensing elements.
