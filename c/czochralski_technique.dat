40|$|A {{well-established}} {{characterization method}} for investigating deep traps in semi-insulating (SI) GaAs is thermally stimulated current(TSC) spectroscopy; however, TSC {{is not considered}} to be a quantitative technique because it involves carrier mobility, lifetime, and geometric factors, which are either unknown or poorly known. In this paper, we first show how to quantify a TSC spectrum, by normalizing with infrared (hv = 1. 13 eV) photocurrent, and then apply this method (called NTSC) to study the lateral uniformity of the main deep centers across the diameters of undoped SI GaAs wafers. The wafers used in the study include both the standard 100 mm sizes and the new 150 mm variations, and are grown by both the low and high pressure liquid encapsulated <b>Czochralski</b> <b>techniques.</b> The results reveal that the 150 mm wafers have a worse NTSC uniformity for the main traps and a higher degree of compensation, as compared these parameters for the 100 mm wafers.

40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} the {{improvement}} of the energy resolution of hadron calorimeters. The approach is based on dual-readout, which consists in the simultaneous detection of both scintillation and Cherenkov light. The comparison of these two signals allows a compensation of the energy fluctuations, which are inherent to the detection of hadronic showers. Lutetium aluminium garnets (LuAG), which are efficient scintillators when activated with rare-earth dopants (i. e. Cerium), can also act as Cherenkov radiators when undoped. Both undoped and doped crystals can then be assembled to build an efficient dual-readout calorimeter. With the objective to investigate the feasibility of this concept, the effects of the doping concentration and the use of various co-dopant on the light output and the timing properties of LuAG were studied. The growth method was demonstrated to induce significant differences in the nature and concentration of structural defects. The optimum geometry, which is based on single-crystals shaped into fibers, favors the micro-pulling down technique. This technology does not outperform Bridgman and <b>Czochralski</b> <b>techniques</b> but was chosen on bases of cost considerations and large scale productions abilities. The optimization of the growth parameters led to the production of single-crystalline fibers of Cerium-doped LuAG with a light output of 8000 photons per MeV and an adequate behavior as light guide due to a well-controlled optical quality. Test with electrons and pions in high energy calorimetry conditions allow to engage a future production of a larger-scale prototype...|$|R
