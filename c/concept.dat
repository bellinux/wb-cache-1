This proved interesting enough for the Army and Air Force to collaborate on a follow-up study, Hardsite. The first Hardsite <b>concept,</b> HSD-I, considered defending bases within urban areas that would have Nike-X protection anyway. An example might be a SAC command and control center or an airfield on the outskirts of a city. The second study, HSD-II, considered the protection of isolated bases like missile fields.

40|$|In {{this paper}} I defend {{the claim that}} <b>concepts</b> are not public. I argue {{that two of the}} main {{constraints}} for theories of <b>concepts,</b> namely (1) that <b>concepts</b> are public and (2) that they serve to explain Frege Cases, are in tension. (1) requires <b>concepts</b> to be individuated coarsely, while (2) requires <b>concepts</b> to be individuated finely. Thus, no theory of <b>concepts</b> can accommodate both (1) and (2). I argue that (2) is a non-negotiable constraint for theories of <b>concepts,</b> while (1) is negotiable. Therefore, theories of <b>concepts</b> should individuate <b>concepts</b> finely enough to solve Frege Cases, and claim that <b>concepts</b> are not public...|$|R

40|$|It is {{generally}} accepted {{that there are}} two kinds of normative <b>concepts</b> : evaluative <b>concepts,</b> such as good, and deontic <b>concepts,</b> such as ought. The question that is raised by this distinction is how it is possible to claim that evaluative <b>concepts</b> are normative. Given that deontic <b>concepts</b> appear to be at the heart of normativity, the bigger the gap between evaluative and deontic <b>concepts,</b> the less it appears plausible to say that evaluative <b>concepts</b> are normative. After having presented the main differences between evaluative and deontic <b>concepts,</b> and shown that there is more than a superficial difference between the two kinds, the paper turns to the question of the normativity of evaluative <b>concepts.</b> It will become clear that, even if these <b>concepts</b> have different functions, there are a great many ties between evaluative <b>concepts,</b> on the one hand, and the <b>concepts</b> of ought and of reason, on the othe...|$|R

30|$|In {{several recent}} studies {{it has been}} claimed that experts’ {{knowledge}} builds around interrelated set of <b>concepts</b> connected by their relational structure (Goldwater and Schalk 2016). This {{is in contrast to}} views, where semantic connections and feature based <b>concepts</b> are in focus, where the <b>concepts</b> (or terms corresponding them) tend to form clusters, connections are close and <b>concepts</b> within clusters share more similarities than <b>concepts</b> between clusters (Chi and Ohlsson 2005; Kemp and Tenenbaum 2008). According the relational view on <b>concepts,</b> structure of experts’ knowledge is characterized by distant and complex conceptual connections, while novices’ knowledge often consists of <b>concepts</b> closely related but remains also shallower in comparison to experts’ knowledge. On the other hand, this difference reflects not only the distinction between feature based <b>concepts</b> and relational <b>concepts</b> but also how novices and experts can access and utilize such knowledge (Lachner and Nückles 2015). Here, the key <b>concepts</b> with high communicability are abstract, widely applicable and independent of specific situation, for example very general field <b>concepts.</b> Another set of <b>concepts</b> is the set with high local clustering coefficients. These <b>concepts</b> and conceptual elements are specific derived models or specific examples, or auxiliary <b>concepts</b> connected with them. They are not key <b>concepts</b> but auxiliary and strongly context specific <b>concepts</b> and conceptual elements and have a role in supporting or augmenting the theoretical skeletal structure formed by the abstract theoretical <b>concepts</b> with high global connectivity.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Domain-specific {{knowledge}} of paintings defines {{a wide range}} of <b>concepts</b> for annotation and flexible retrieval of paintings. In this work, we employ the ontology of artistic <b>concepts</b> that includes visual (or atomic) <b>concepts</b> at the intermediate level and high-level <b>concepts</b> at the application level. Visual-level <b>concepts</b> include artistic color and brushwork <b>concepts</b> that serve as cues for annotating high-level <b>concepts</b> such as the art periods for paintings. To assign artistic color <b>concepts,</b> we utilize inductive inference method based on probabilistic SVM classification. For brushwork annotation, we employ previously developed transductive inference framework that utilizes multi-expert approach, where individual experts implement transductive inference by exploiting both labeled and unlabelled data. In this paper, we combine the color and brushwork <b>concepts</b> with low-level features and utilize a modification of the transductive inference framework to annotate art period <b>concepts</b> to the paintings collection. Our experiments on annotating art period <b>concepts</b> demonstrate that: a) the use of visual-level <b>concepts</b> significantly improves the accuracy as compared to using low-level features only; and b) the proposed framework out-performs the conventional baseline method.
