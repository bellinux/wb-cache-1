2500|$|Typically, a lens is used {{to focus}} the light {{reflected}} or emitted from objects into a real image on the light-sensitive surface inside a camera during a timed exposure. With an electronic image sensor, this produces an electrical charge at each pixel, which is electronically processed and stored in a digital image file for subsequent display or processing. The result with photographic emulsion is an invisible latent image, which is later chemically [...] "developed" [...] into a visible image, either negative or positive depending on {{the purpose of the}} photographic material and the method of processing. A negative image on film is traditionally used to photographically create a positive image on a paper base, known as a print, either by using an enlarger or by <b>contact</b> <b>printing.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The [...] "calotype", or [...] "talbotype", was a [...] "developing out" [...] process, Talbot's {{improvement}} {{of his earlier}} photogenic drawing process {{by the use of}} a different silver salt (silver iodide instead of silver chloride) and a developing agent (gallic acid and silver nitrate) to bring out an invisibly slight [...] "latent" [...] image on the exposed paper. This reduced the required exposure time in the camera to only a minute or two for subjects in bright sunlight. The translucent calotype negative made it possible to produce as many positive prints as desired by simple <b>contact</b> <b>printing,</b> whereas the daguerreotype was an opaque direct positive that could only be reproduced by copying it with a camera. On the other hand, the calotype, despite waxing of the negative to make the image clearer, still was not pin-sharp like the metallic daguerreotype, because the paper fibres degraded the printed image. The simpler salted paper process was normally used when making prints from calotype negatives.|$|E
50|$|<b>Contact</b> <b>printing</b> allows {{fabrication}} of multi-color QD-LEDs. A QD-LED was fabricated with an emissive layer consisting of 25-µm wide stripes of red, {{green and blue}} QD monolayers. <b>Contact</b> <b>printing</b> methods also minimize the amount of QD required, reducing costs. The demonstrated color gamut from QD-LEDs exceeds the performance of both LCD and OLED display technologies.|$|E
5000|$|Photographers {{generally}} begin printing {{a roll of}} film {{by making}} a <b>contact</b> <b>print</b> of their negatives {{to use as a}} quick reference to decide which images to enlarge. Some large format photographers, such as Edward Weston, make only <b>contact</b> <b>prints</b> of their large (4x5", 5x7", 8x10" [...] or larger) negatives.|$|R

50|$|To apply a {{homogeneous}} pressure during the printing step, a magnetic force is used. For that, the stamp {{is sensitive to}} a magnetic field by injecting iron powder into a second layer of PDMS. This force can be adjusted for nano and micro-patterns. Fully automated micro <b>contact</b> <b>printing</b> equipment was developed. It consists of {{the steps of the}} micro <b>contact</b> <b>printing</b> process : loading, inking, drying, printing, alignment, cleaning, unloading. A pipeting module is used to deposit some drop of liquids like ethanol. This equipment is named InnoSTAMP40.|$|E
50|$|Since {{this process}} {{produces}} neither enlargements nor reductions, {{the image on}} the print is exactly the same size as {{the image on the}} negative. <b>Contact</b> <b>prints</b> are used to produce proof sheets from entire rolls of 35 mm negative (from 135 film cassettes) and 120 (2 film rolls) in order to aid in the selection of images for further enlargement, and for cataloging and identification purposes. For 120 roll film (once a common negative size for popular cameras) and larger film, <b>contact</b> <b>prints</b> are often used to determine the final print size. In medium and large format photography, <b>contact</b> <b>prints</b> are prized for their extreme fidelity to the negative, with exquisite detail that can be seen with the use of a magnifying glass. A disadvantage to using <b>contact</b> <b>prints</b> in the fine-arts is the laboriousness of modifying exposure selectively, when the use of an enlarger can achieve the same purpose.|$|R

5000|$|Computer {{screens and}} other {{electronic}} display devices provide {{an alternative approach}} to <b>contact</b> <b>printing.</b> A permanent image (negative, positive film or transparency, or translucent original) is not used, instead the light sensitive material is exposed directly to the display device {{in a dark room}} for a controllable duration. The resulting image generated by this mixed digital/analogue technique has been coined [...] "laptopogram". While limited by the image display device resolution, which can be much inferior to film negatives, the widespread use of electronic displays provides great potential to this unorthodox <b>contact</b> <b>printing</b> method.|$|E
5000|$|When large format film is contact printed {{to create}} {{finished}} work, it is possible, but not easy, to use local controls {{to interpret the}} image on the negative. [...] "Burning" [...] and [...] "dodging" [...] (either increasing the amount of light that one area of the print receives, or decreasing the amount of light in order to achieve the ideal tonal range in a particular area) require painstaking work with photographic masks, or the use of a production <b>contact</b> <b>printing</b> machine (Arkay, Morse, Burke and James are manufacturers who make <b>contact</b> <b>printing</b> machines).|$|E

50|$|Research and {{prototyping}} processes {{often use}} contact or proximity lithography, because it uses inexpensive hardware and can achieve high optical resolution. The resolution in proximity lithography is approximately the square {{root of the}} product of the wavelength and the gap distance. Hence, except for projection lithography (see below), <b>contact</b> <b>printing</b> offers the best resolution, because its gap distance is approximately zero (neglecting the thickness of the photoresist itself). In addition, nanoimprint lithography may revive interest in this familiar technique, especially since the cost of ownership is expected to be low; however, the shortcomings of <b>contact</b> <b>printing</b> discussed above remain as challenges.|$|E

50|$|<b>Contact</b> <b>printing</b> {{machines}} are more elaborate devices {{than the more}} familiar and widely available <b>contact</b> <b>printing</b> frames. They typically combine in a box the light source, intermediate glass stages, and a final glass stage for the negative and paper to be placed upon, {{as well as an}} elastic pressure plate to keep the negative and the paper in tight contact. Dodging can be accomplished by placing fine tissue paper on the intermediate glass stages between the light source and the negative/paper sandwich to modify the exposure locally. The benefit to such time intensive techniques is the ability to then make multiple prints with negligible variation, at full production speed.|$|E

Smaller <b>contact</b> <b>prints,</b> from films and formats such as 135 film cassettes, 35 mm (24×36 mm images), and 120/220 roll film (6 cm), are useful for evaluation of exposure, composition, and subject.|$|R
