Se trata de un paso estratégico importante, encuadrado en la búsqueda que el Grupo Inditex realiza diariamente para ofrecer el mejor servicio a los clientes en todo el mundo. El presente trabajo analiza la notoriedad de marca de Zara y las posibilidades que plantea Internet como herramienta de comunicación y como canal de distribución. Diseño/metodología: Se presenta un análisis descriptivo de la experiencia de Zara desde el lanzamiento de zara. com desde septiembre de 2010. Se muestra, además, un análisis comparativo respecto a dos de sus competidores: H&M y Mango. Resultados: Se observa cómo Zara parece estar superando en alcance y en número de páginas vistas a Mango, pero todavía no alcanza los niveles de H&M, a nivel internacional. Limitaciones: Se trata de un artículo descriptivo; no se han podido analizar con detalle los resultados de la venta online de Zara {{debido a}} su reciente incorporación en este canal de distribución y a que la política del Grupo Inditex es esperar a que transcurran doce meses de funcionamiento de la tienda virtual para ofrecer los primeros resultados. Implicaciones prácticas: Conocer la estrategia emprendida por Zara y sus competidores para, a través del comercio electrónico, lograr consolidar su imagen de marca internacional. Ello permite perfilar recomendaciones para los gestores y que la incursión en el canal de venta online sea un éxito. Valor añadido: Dada la situación de recesión económica en que nos encontramos y debido al papel protagonista que está tomando el sector textil en la comercialización y venta online en España en los últimos meses, el comercio electrónico en el sector textil resulta un tema de gran actualidad. Además, se centra en una de las empresas españolas que más estudios ha acaparado gracias a su indudable éxito.

In this paper, I argue that such a view does not fully conform to the way much trade occurs, resulting in efforts by many firms to implement e-commerce in a manner that at best fails to capitalize on existing assets and at worst disrupts existing relations and reduces value. In particular, work on the dynamics of <b>click</b> <b>and</b> <b>mortar</b> firms is used to highlight opportunities posed by taking a more situated view of e-commerce in business-to-consumer ecommerce.

Few retail Web sites offer complex integration capabilities, such as the ability to search local store inventories, or to pick up and return online purchases in a local outlet. Regression analyses reveal that the retail sector and firm resources help to explain this discrepancy.

Many manufacturers who had been doing business in the conventional (brick and mortar) are switching to online business (<b>click</b> <b>and</b> <b>mortar).</b> To answer the needs of customers, manufacturers are required to work harder. Therefore, this study aims to demonstrate the factors that influence online shopping decisions.

To evaluate the dynamic stages of e-tailing business as an innovative venture, we propose four stages: exploration, breakeven, growth, and maturity. The stages are measured by the impact of revenue and income on the firm value, and a regression model is adopted to formulate the model. To empirically examine the stages of e-tailers and retailers, we have collected 14 e-tailers, 112 C 2 ̆ 6 M, and 75 B 2 ̆ 6 M from the U. S. stock markets. According to this study, the proposed stage model explains the evolution of pure e-tailers very meaningfully. E-tailers were in the late exploration stage in 1999, breakeven stage in 2000, and growth stage in 2001. Unlike our hypothetical expectation, the stage model could not adequately explain the effect of online business to C 2 ̆ 6 M. In this regard, the impact of online channel to traditional retailers was not revolutionary. In 1999 and 2000, the primary contributing factor to firm value of C 2 ̆ 6 M was income, but in 2001, it was revenue.

40|$|E-commerce as we {{know today}} has burgeoned {{with the advent of}} the World Wide Web and the {{subsequent}} mass acceptance and usage of it. Its huge potential for commercial and transactional purposes has not yet been fully tapped. One of the newer areas of marketing theory application in the context of the Internet, or more specifically E-Commerce is Service Marketing. In this paper, we explore the possibility of extending the existing tools for assessing and measuring service quality as perceived by customers to the context of purely virtual enterprises. Our aim is to see whether there are differences perceived by customers in service quality across online service based companies: and identify the attributes responsible for any such perceived differences: and the areas in which customers do not distinguish between providers. Confirmation and disconfirmation of a set of hypotheses is used to determine the distinctions based on variances between the identified attributes. Our findings indicate customers today set purely internet based service companies apart based on tangibility, reliability, and responsiveness of the companies rather than their perceived credibility and security in services offered. This indicates a blurring down of the divisions between online and offline service providing companies in the customer’s mind. Our interpretation of this blurring down of division is that e-commerce and transactions online has gained maturity and customers no longer feel trepidation regarding the often touted issues of credibility and security exclusive to online entities. Rather, today they are more concerned with who is able to provide them with better service with respect to their product centric worries that are more traditional in nature. Our recommendation for marketers would be to stop viewing themselves as purveyors of online or off-line services, but rather as purveyors of simply “services” and ensure quality therein. The customer has stopped caring whether service is delivered online, or off-line: for them the novelty of receiving services online has worn out, with the resultant expectations that quality in the more traditional aspects of service delivery would match at least that received offline. It is time the marketers stopped worrying where to position their selves along the <b>click</b> <b>and</b> <b>mortar</b> spectrum, and follow the customer’s lead. Validerat; 20101217 (root...|$|E
40|$|As {{we leave}} the Industrial Age behind us and move into the Information Age, the {{transition}} from ?bricks and mortar? commerce to electronic commerce and from paper to electronic publishing pose major challenges for international intellectual property regimes. Electronic commerce has taken off. Whatever concerns about consumer acceptance there were five years ago {{have given way to}} ?<b>click</b> <b>and</b> <b>mortar?</b> business models where e-commerce has an established role complementing traditional commerce. The digital publishing market segment, approximately $ 8 billion today, is expected to reach $ 70 billion by 2004. 1 A significant portion of the GDPs of the industrialized countries is now based on the production and distribution of knowledge. While there are still issues that need to be dealt with, primarily the infrastructure of consistent standards for transactions, digital commerce in digital property will certainly continue to grow. 2 Copyright and patent law worldwide, of vital importance to the production and distribution of knowledge, are struggling to keep pace with advances in technology. Intellectual property experts speak of the ?growing incoherence? and ?incipient breakdown? of the international intellectual property system. ? 3 There is the possibility that much of traditional copyright law may be marginalized. Patents, too, are troubled. Two years ago the United States Patent and Trademarks Office began awarding patents for Internet business methods, such ?one-clicking shopping? and ?name your own price? reverse auctions. 4 The awarding of these ?junk? patents, which seem to fly {{in the face of the}} Patent Office?s requirement that an invention be original and not obvious, may pose a threat to innovation in e-commerce, since entrepreneurs would potentially be forced to license these patents before starting up their competing Web sites. The ability of an ordinary individual to make perfect digital copies and send them anywhere around the world undermines traditional copyright markets. Because of that fact, publishers have moved into electronic publishing with some hesitation. However, technical means are on the horizon that can restrict access to and uses of digitized works, which raises the specter of ?all-consuming copyright owner control. ? 5 My perspective in all of this is that of a librarian who attempts to deal with practical issues relating to copyright on my campus. An appreciation of the evolving and complex interrelationship between library services and copyright law should be a part of every librarian?s expertise. At this conference I hope to gain a clearer understanding of developments in intellectual property outside the United States and of the technology that will drive those developments...|$|E
