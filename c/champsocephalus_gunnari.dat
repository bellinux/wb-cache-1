40|$|Physiological {{adaptation}} of Antarctic teleosts to cold environment was studied {{with regard to}} the presence of regulatory peptides involved in (i) cardiac and ion-water homeostasis, (ii) brain, (iii) intestine, and (iv) gonads. Immunoreactivity for different regions of the Atrial Natriuretic Peptide was detected in the heart of Trematomus bernacchii, Chionodraco hamatus, Cryodraco antarcticus, and <b>Champsocephalus</b> <b>gunnari,</b> while immunoreactivity for other regulatory peptides (i. e., endothelin- 1, somatostatin- 14, and galanin) appeared to be widely distributed in the cardio-vascular system. Osmoregulatory peptides (somatostatin- 14, prolactin, atrial natriuretic peptide, galanin, and urotensin II) were localised by immunohistochemistry in the urinary bladder and gills. From studies on the distribution of the pituitary specific transcription factor 1 and adenohypophysial hormones (growth hormone, prolactin, and gonadotropin releasing hormone) in the brain and pituitary of Trematomus bernacchii and Pagothenia coriiceps, it was evident that the pituitary specific transcription factor 1 acts as a developmental regulator of the anterior pituitary, responsible for growth hormone and prolactin cell commitment, differentiation, and gene expression. This coexistence appeared to be a unique trait of Antarctic teleosts. Analyses of the distribution and localisation of gastrointestinal hormones and neuropeptides (insulin, glucagon, pancreatic polypeptide, somatostatin, vasoactive intestinal polypeptide, pituitary adenylate cyclase activating peptide, and peptide histidine isoleucine) in adults of Chionodraco hamatus, Pagetopsis mascropterus, and Notothenia coriiceps, and larvae of Pleuragramma antarcticum showed that most of the immunoreactive nerve fibres in Notothenioids are of extrinsic type.

40|$|Fatty acid {{analysis}} was used to study the trophic ecology of 10 demersal fish species in the South Georgia region. Principal component analysis grouped the species into three general clusters, revealing resource partitioning between species. Two groups were characterised by large proportions of either monounsaturated or polyunsaturated fatty acids, separating species according to their predominant feeding habitat. The third group showed fatty acid signatures overlapping with either or both of the previous two groups, suggesting a more opportunistic feeding behaviour for these species. Intraspecific comparisons furthermore revealed dietary variability with size, year and geographical location in several species. Mackerel icefish (<b>Champsocephalus</b> <b>gunnari)</b> in particular showed inter-annual differences in muscle lipid concentrations closely linked to prey availability with low lipid contents found in years of low krill (Euphausia superba) abundance. Despite the intraspecific differences the majority of species could be easily distinguished from each other, which indicates the utility of this method in the dietary analysis of higher predators. ...|$|E

The closure of the fishery for much of the 1990 s allowed the relationship between environmental conditions and recruitment to be studied without the confounding effects of fishing mortality.

40|$|Abstract The Antarctic Wsh fauna is {{characterized}} by high endemism and low species diversity with one perci-form suborder, the Notothenioidei, dominating the whole species assemblage on the shelves and slopes. Nototheni-oids diversiWed in situ through adaptive radiation and show a variety of life history strategies as adults ranging from benthic to pelagic modes. Their larval development is unusually long, lasting from {{a few months to}} more than a year, and generally includes a pelagic larval stage. There-fore, the advection of eggs and larvae with ocean currents is a key factor modulating population connectivity. Here, we compare the genetic population structures and gene Xow of seven ecologically distinct notothenioid species of the southern Scotia Arc based on nuclear microsatellites and mitochondrial DNA sequences (D-loop/cytochrome b). The seven species belong to the families Nototheniidae (Gobio-notothen gibberifrons, Lepidonotothen squamifrons, Tre-matomus eulepidotus, T. newnesi) and Channichthyidae (Chaenocephalus aceratus, <b>Champsocephalus</b> <b>gunnari,</b> Chionodraco rastrospinosus).

Moreover, our study indicates the presence of a significant genetic differentiation between individual year-classes pointing out the existence of dynamic processes acting at the population genetic level, according to recent results for broadly distributed marine species.

40|$|Understanding the key {{drivers of}} {{population}} connectivity {{in the marine}} environment {{is essential for the}} effective management of natural resources. Although several different approaches to evaluating connectivity have been used, they are rarely integrated quantitatively. Here, we use a ‘seascape genetics’ approach, by combining oceanographic modelling and microsatellite analyses, to understand the dominant influences on the population genetic structure of two Antarctic fishes with contrasting life histories, <b>Champsocephalus</b> <b>gunnari</b> and Notothenia rossii. The close accord between the model projections and empirical genetic structure demonstrated that passive dispersal during the planktonic early life stages is the dominant influence on patterns and extent of genetic structuring in both species. The shorter planktonic phase of C. gunnari restricts direct transport of larvae between distant populations, leading to stronger regional differentiation. By contrast, geographic distance did not affect differentiation in N. rossii, whose longer larval period promotes long-distance dispersal. Interannual variability in oceanographic flows strongly influenced the projected genetic structure, suggesting that shifts in circulation patterns due to climate change are likely to impact future genetic connectivity and opportunities for local adaptation, resilience and recovery from perturbations. Further development of realistic climate models is required to fully assess such potential impacts...|$|E

Information presented here, drawn largely from recent scientific research surveys, includes aspects of species composition, biomass and stock structure, reproduction and early life history, age, growth, and nat-ural mortality, and diet. Although Antarctic fish faunal groups overlap in the southern Scotia Arc, the region is dominated by species of low-Antarctic origin {{both in terms of}} biomass and number of species. Several basic biological parameters of the abundant fish species in the southern Scotia Arc are comparatively well known, though less so in the South Orkney Islands than the South Shetland Islands.

Parental care, a widespread behaviour among icefishes such as C. aceratus, is not observed in C. gunnari, which has a broadcast spawning strategy. There were large differences in total fecundity mainly due to the different sizes reached by each species (total fecundity range was 2, 500 – 21, 300 hydrated oocytes). Nevertheless, when comparing relative fecundity values, the average results were, in general, similar for P. georgianus and C. aceratus (6 – 9 hydrated oocytes per female gram). However, relative fecundity estimated for C. gunnari was 10 – 37 hydrated oocytes per ovary-free female gram. The difference may be a consequence of the smaller oocyte size of the species as compared to other icefishes. The small diameter of hydrated oocytes was also associated with low values of dry weight. The high relative fecundity recorded for C. gunnnari may compensate, in part, for a broadcast spawning strategy. サウスジョージアおよびシャグロック諸島周辺海域より得られたコオリウオ科 3 種（Champsocephalus gunnari，Pseudochaenichthys georgianus，Chaenocephalus aceratus）の繁殖特性を組織学的に解析した。親魚による卵保護はコオリウオ科に広く見られる行動であるが，浮性卵を産むC. gunnari には認められない。 3 種の孕卵数はその体サイズと関連し， 2500 ～ 21300 と大きな差が認められた。一方，相対孕卵数はP. georgianus とC. aceratus が 6 ～ 9 なのに対してC. gunnari では 10 ～ 37 であった。この差はC. gunnariの卵が他種に比べて小さいことが原因と考えられた。C. gunnari における相対孕卵数の多さは，浮性卵を産むこの種の繁殖戦略を補完するものと考えられる...|$|E

The fish species composition in the diet at each site showed a strong relationship with the local marine habitat/topography. The absence of formerly harvested fish species indicates a lack of recovery of stocks of Notothenia rossii Richardson, 1844 at South Georgia and <b>Champsocephalus</b> <b>gunnari</b> Lönnberg, 1905 at the South Orkney Islands. At South Georgia, Protomyctophum choriodon Hulley, 1981, Lepidonotothen larseni (Lönnberg, 1905), and C. gunnari {{were the most important}} species in the diet between 1991 and 2004. Variability in the occurrence of C. gunnari was driven mainly by annual scale processes, particularly those that influence the availability of Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba (Dana, 1852)). The occurrence of the pelagic P. choriodon was primarily influenced by shorter-term water mass changes within the foraging range of the seals. The fish composition in the diet reflects differences in marine habitat/topography, as well as variability, at a range of time scales that reflect environmental variability and harvesting...|$|E
40|$|Using Antarctic {{fur seals}} (Arctocephalus gazella (Peters, 1875)) in a feeding trial, we {{investigated}} {{the use of}} milk fatty acids to determine diet. In a regime designed to replicate an average foraging trip, six female seals were fed on four successive days meals of krill (Euphausia superba Dana, 1850; day 1), mixed krill and icefish (<b>Champsocephalus</b> <b>gunnari</b> Lönnberg, 1905; day 2), and icefish (days 3 and 4). Four milk samples were collected from each female, one every 12 h {{from the time of}} the last feed. Fatty acid profiles of samples were analysed using canonical discriminant analysis and classification trees. Milk fatty acids could be used to distinguish between seals fed the experimental diet, which was high in fish, and those feeding naturally, thought to be consuming mostly krill. However, there was significant variation between individual seals, which may have been the influence of feeding prior to the experiment. Milk fatty acids remained relatively unchanged over time, suggesting that the influence of dietary fatty acids was averaged over the suckling period. We conclude that, whilst this technique has potential in studying the diet of higher predators, further work is needed to test the underlying assumptions and mechanisms involved in the transfer of fatty acids from the diet into milk...|$|E
40|$|The {{occurrence}} {{of fish in}} the diet of the Antarctic fur seal (Arctocephalus gazella) at Bird Island, South Georgia was investigated by analysis of fish otoliths in scats (faeces) collected during late May to early November 1983. Of the 55 scats examined, 49 contained fish remains, and 45 contained fish otoliths. Ten fish species were represented by 415 otoliths, and 33 otoliths were too digested to be identified unequivocally. Fish size was estimated from otolith size based on published allometric equations. Four coastal notothenioid fishes dominated the fish component of the diet: <b>Champsocephalus</b> <b>gunnari</b> and Gobionotothen gibberifrons each comprised about 40 % of the total fish mass; Chaenocephalus aceratus was ranked third by mass and the smaller Lepidonotothen larseni occurred in {{one quarter of the}} scats but was of lower importance in terms of mass. The length-frequency distribution of C. gunnari landed by the commercial fishery in October 1982 to June 1983 is similar to that which comprised the bulk of the diet in the present study. Compared with recent studies on the fish component of the diet in the literature, the dominance of C. gunnari is generally similar, however, there was a greater proportion of G. gibberifrons during the 1983 winter and spring than reported for recent winters...|$|E
40|$|The diet of mainly {{adult and}} sub-adult male Antarctic fur seals (Arctocephalus gazella) was {{investigated}} during the austral winters of 1992 and 1993 using faecal (scat) analysis. Of samples containing identifiable prey remains (n = 376), c. 28 % contained krill alone, c. 37 % contained fish alone and c. 35 % contained both krill and fish. The mean size of krill taken {{was smaller than}} in summer due {{to the absence of}} large adult krill of 55 – 60 mm total length. Of the 25 fish taxa taken, krill-feeding species predominated, especially in scats that also contained krill. Non-krill feeding species were more abundant in scats containing fish alone. The mackerel icefish (<b>Champsocephalus</b> <b>gunnari</b> Lönnberg 1905), which feeds mainly on krill, was the most important fish species in terms of absolute frequency (53 %), frequency of occurrence (69 %) and estimated biomass (47 %); fur seals may {{have a significant impact on}} local stocks of this species. Cephalopods and pelagic fish (myctophids) were of minor importance in the diet (< 2 %). The importance of krill and krill-feeding fish species suggests that the male fur seals, which are present around South Georgia in winter, are targeting their foraging on a krill and fish community, probably associated with krill aggregations...|$|E
