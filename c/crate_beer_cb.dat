The team that could complete the stack without falling off, would get their next clue.|$|R

5|$|The {{stage of}} the Kaiserkeller was made of planks of wood {{balanced}} {{on the top of}} <b>beer</b> <b>crates,</b> so the two groups made a bet to see to who {{would be the first to}} break it. After punishing the stage for days, a slight crack appeared, and when Storm jumped off the top of the upright piano it finally broke. Johnny 'Guitar' Byrne remembered that as Storm hit the stage, it cracked loudly and formed a V-shape around him. He disappeared into it, and all the amplifiers and drummer Ringo Starr's cymbals slid into the hole. Koschmider was furious, and had to replace the live music with a juke box. Both groups went across the road to Harold's cafe for breakfast on the Grosse Freiheit, but were followed by Koschmider's doormen, armed with coshes, who beat them all as punishment.|$|R

The week-long final was fairly balanced until the Thursday evening session which Higgins won 6-0, creating a gap Spencer never looked like closing. Higgins duly went on to take the match 37-32. The match, played at the British Legion Club in Selly Oak Birmingham, often with emergency generators providing the lighting and with hundreds of spectators crammed in, many sat on <b>beer</b> <b>crates,</b> provided the crucial spark of interest in the modern era.
