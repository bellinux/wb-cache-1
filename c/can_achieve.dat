5|$|The lyrics {{focus on}} how the bonding of two lovers can become so strong that they {{practically}} become one entity, through the act of sexual intercourse. Apart from the sexual connotations, there is an aspirational undercurrent to the lyrics, and like many of their subsequent songs, desire is explicitly linked to ambition–"Free your mind of doubt and danger/Be for real don't be a stranger/We <b>can</b> <b>achieve</b> it/We <b>can</b> <b>achieve</b> it".|$|E

50|$|Another type of servicizing {{may be a}} {{strategy}} for providing access to services for people who cannot afford to buy products outright. For example, in the case where auto ownership is economically unfeasible, creative servicizing offers at least three possible solutions: one in which transportation <b>can</b> be <b>achieved</b> simultaneously (as in car-pooling); one in which transportation <b>can</b> be <b>achieved</b> sequentially (as in car-sharing); and one in which transportation <b>can</b> be <b>achieved</b> eventually (rent-to-own)..|$|R

5|$|The {{two most}} {{important}} kinetic properties of an enzyme are how quickly the enzyme becomes saturated with a particular substrate, and the maximum rate it <b>can</b> <b>achieve.</b> Knowing these properties suggests what an enzyme might do in the cell and can show how the enzyme will respond to changes in these conditions.|$|E
5|$|Although Christ, like man, {{is made in}} {{the image}} of God, he alone shares the {{likeness}} of God the Father. Christ is both sinless and apathetic, and thus by striving to imitate Christ, man <b>can</b> <b>achieve</b> salvation. To Clement, sin is involuntary, and thus irrational , removed only through the wisdom of the Logos. God's guidance of us away from sin is thus a manifestation of God's universal love for mankind. The word play on λόγος and αλόγον is characteristic of Clement's writing, and may be rooted in the Epicurean belief that relationships between words are deeply reflective of relationships between the objects they signify.|$|E

He was exiled to stasis after coming into conflict with the Master Builder, the leader of the Forerunners. The Master Builder is responsible for the creation of the titular Halo superweapons. The Didact is married to the Librarian, one of the most powerful and influential Lifeworkers to have lived.

In 1960, in one of the earliest studies to look at orgasm and SCI, the term phantom orgasm was coined to describe women's perception of orgasmic sensations despite SCI—but subsequent studies have suggested the experience is not merely psychological. Men with complete SCI report sexual sensations at the time of ejaculation, accompanied by physical signs normally found at orgasm, such as increased blood pressure. Women can experience orgasm with vibration to the cervix regardless of level or completeness of injury; the sensation is the same as uninjured women experience.|$|E
5|$|Grandmaster (shortened as GM; {{sometimes}} International Grandmaster or IGM is used) {{is awarded}} to world-class chess masters. Apart from World Champion, Grandmaster {{is the highest}} title a chess player can attain. Before FIDE will confer the title on a player, the player must have an Elo chess rating (see below) of at least 2500 at one time and three favorable results (called norms) in tournaments involving other grandmasters, including some from countries other than the applicant's. There are other milestones a player <b>can</b> <b>achieve</b> to attain the title, such as winning the World Junior Championship.|$|E
5|$|Instead of {{blurring}} and thresholding, {{this method}} can alternatively {{be described as}} applying a median filter with Gaussian weights to each pixel. It is possible to use kernels other than the heat kernel, or to adaptively refine the grid so that it has high resolution near the curve but does not waste time and memory on pixels far from the curve that do {{not contribute to the}} outcome. Instead of using only the two values in the pixelated image, a version of this method that uses an image whose pixel values represent the signed distance to the curve <b>can</b> <b>achieve</b> subpixel accuracy and require lower resolution.|$|E

5|$|One of the {{historically}} contentious views within Jainism {{is in part}} attributed to Mahavira and his ascetic life where he never wore any clothes as a mark of disowning everything (interpreted {{as a consequence of}} the fifth vow of Aparigraha).
