5|$|Stuckism is an {{international}} art movement founded in 1999 by Billy Childish and Charles Thomson to promote figurative painting as opposed to <b>conceptual</b> <b>art.</b> By May 2017 the initial group of 13 British artists had expanded to 236 groups in 52 countries.|$|E
5|$|The Stuckists gained {{significant}} {{media coverage}} {{for eight years}} of protests (2000–2006 and 2008) outside Tate Britain against the Turner Prize, sometimes dressed as clowns. In 2001 they demonstrated in Trafalgar Square at the unveiling of Rachel Whiteread's Monument. In 2002, they carried a coffin marked The Death of <b>Conceptual</b> <b>Art</b> to the White Cube Gallery.

5|$|A life-size {{model of}} the light cycle was put on display at a booth at Fan Expo 2009 in Toronto, Ontario from August 28–30, 2009, along with a special {{presentation}} of material from the production. The <b>conceptual</b> <b>art</b> shown at Comic-Con was shown in the session, along with some test film of the martial artists who play a more athletic style of Disc Wars. A segment from the film showed Flynn's son entering the now-decrepit arcade, playing a Tron stand-up arcade video game, noticing a passage in {{the wall behind the}} Tron game and entering it, the passage closing behind him. Flynn's son makes the visit to the arcade after Alan Bradley receives a page from the disconnected phone number of the arcade. The footage was used later as part of the trailer released on March 5, 2010.|$|E
5|$|An 1895 fire {{destroyed}} {{half the}} village, {{as it had}} no form of fire protection at that time. Throughout the 20thcentury, {{the decline of the}} natural cement industry caused Rosendale to suffer economically and lose population. The village was also battered by a series of severe floods, and the center of commerce began to shift from Main Street to Route32. By the 1970s the village was having severe problems with its utilities and tax code, and was no longer producing cement. The hippie movement brought many artists to the village during this time, which led to ideological clashes between the newcomers and the more conservative, established residents. In 1976, the village voted to dissolve itself to solve its municipal problems, and on January1, 1978, Rosendale became disincorporated. The village's mayor {{at the time of the}} vote viewed the dissolution as a work of <b>conceptual</b> <b>art,</b> and published a book on the matter.|$|E
5|$|By {{the early}} 1930s she was {{attending}} art {{classes at the}} Art Students League of New York, and in 1941 she had her first solo exhibition. A student of Hans Hofmann and Chaim Gross, Nevelson experimented with early <b>conceptual</b> <b>art</b> using found objects, and dabbled in painting and printing before dedicating her lifework to sculpture. Usually created out of wood, her sculptures appear puzzle-like, with multiple intricately cut pieces placed into wall sculptures or independently standing pieces, often 3-D. A unique feature of her work is that her figures are often painted in monochromatic black or white. A figure in the international art scene, Nevelson was showcased at the 31st Venice Biennale. Her work is seen in major collections in museums and corporations. Nevelson {{remains one of the}} most important figures in 20th-century American sculpture.|$|E

5|$|Irving Blum {{made the}} {{original}} thirty-two canvases {{available to the}} public through an arrangement with the National Gallery of Art in Washington, DC by placing them on permanent loan two days before Warhol's death. However, the original Campbell's Soup Cans is now a part of the Museum of Modern Art permanent collection. A print called Campbell's Soup Cans II is part of the permanent collection of the Museum of Contemporary Art in Chicago. 200 Campbell's Soup Cans, 1962 (Acrylic on canvas, 72inches x 100inches), in the private collection of John and Kimiko Powers is the largest single canvas of the Campbell's Soup can paintings.

My aim is to explore a balance through the combination of both ‘pictorial’ and ‘conceptual’ strategies. The studio submission Indifferent Attitude uses subtle shifts in production techniques to present a fractured suite of photographic works. In so doing, it plays with the convention of photographic practice and resists any requirement to provide a clear sense of limits...|$|R
