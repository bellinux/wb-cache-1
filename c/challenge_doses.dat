40|$|This {{experiment}} is {{an investigation of}} the mosquito?s ability to adapt to high levels of background gamma radiation. Radiation was used as a selective pressure to induce radioresistance among a group of Aedes aegypti mosquitos. Mosquitos were grouped into a High Background Group (HBG) or a Low Background Group (LBG), the LBG being the control group. The HBG was exposed to a continuous field of ionizing gamma radiation significantly higher than the normal background radiation level for the Bryan/ College station (B/CS) area. The HBG spent more than 23 hours per day exposed to the increased levels of radiation. The dose rate ranged from 36 rad/day to 28 rad/day {{over the course of several}} weeks. The radiation exposure to the mosquitos began at the larval stages and continued throughout the adult stages of the mosquito?s lifecycle. During the developmental stages of life living tissues are most susceptible to radiation. Thus by delivering radiation doses during those stages, it provided greater opportunity to induce radioresistance in the mosquitos DNA. Mosquitos in the LBG were reared using the same techniques as the HBG, but in radiation levels similar to that of typical background radiation levels in the B/CS area. The average normal background dose rate at the mosquito lab location is 24 mrem/ year. After mosquitos in the HBG obtained a total dose of approximately 1000 rads over the course of several weeks, the HBG was exposed to a <b>challenge</b> <b>dose</b> provided by a high dose rate gamma source which delivered a total dose of about 70, 000 rads over the course of 7 - 10 hours. Additionally, mosquitos in the LBG were also exposed to the same <b>challenge</b> <b>dose</b> for an equivalent amount of total dose, ? 10 %. Upon completion of the <b>challenge</b> <b>dose,</b> the LBG was cared for utilizing the same methods as before. The HBG, however, did not receive additional high doses of radiation and were only exposed to background radiation similar to the exposure to the LBG. Survival percentages were documented and compared immediately following the <b>challenge</b> <b>dose</b> and continued until all mosquitoes perished. The mosquitos in the HBG consistently had higher survival rates when compared to the LBG. For mosquitos in the first round LBG, 50 % lethality was reached on Day 3 post <b>challenge</b> <b>dose.</b> Mosquitos in the second round LBG, 50 % lethality on Day 1 post <b>challenge</b> <b>dose.</b> After the <b>challenge</b> exposures to the LBG, 62 % of round one and 72 % of round two survived the duration of the exposure. Mosquitos in the first round HBG reached 50 % lethality on Day 6 post <b>challenge</b> <b>dose.</b> The second round HBG reached 50 % lethality on Day 9 post <b>challenge</b> <b>dose.</b> After the <b>challenge</b> exposure to the HBG, 92 % of round one and 100 % of round two survived the duration of the exposure.

40|$|To {{investigate}} the induction of adaptive response (inducible protective processes) in mitotic cells of Swiss albino mouse, a {{monofunctional alkylating agent}} Me methanesulfonate (MMS) was employed. When the animals treated with a low dose of 50 mg/kg body wt. were challenged with a subsequent high (<b>challenging)</b> <b>dose</b> of 150 mg/kg body wt., after different time lags (2, 5, 8 or 10 h), the yield of chromosomal aberrations in bone marrow cells {{was found to be}} significantly reduced compared to the additive effects of both conditioning and <b>challenging</b> <b>doses.</b> It seems, therefore, that the low dose of MMS employed has made the cells less sensitive against further clastogenic effect of <b>challenge</b> <b>dose</b> of MMS.

So far, no need for a booster dose has been identified in healthy subjects; however further follow-up continues to determine the exact duration of protection. We evaluated antibody persistence and immune response to a hepatitis B vaccine <b>challenge</b> <b>dose</b> in children aged 15 – 16 years, previously vaccinated with 3 -doses of the same vaccine in infancy (third dose received before 18 months of age). MethodsA single hepatitis B vaccine <b>challenge</b> <b>dose</b> containing 10 μg hepatitis B surface (HBs) antigen was administered to adolescents aged 15 – 16 years. Blood samples were taken before and one month after the <b>challenge</b> <b>dose</b> to measure anti-HBs antibodies using a chemiluminescence immunoassay. Solicited local and general symptoms, as well as unsolicited and serious adverse events were recorded after the <b>challenge</b> <b>dose.</b> Results 303 subjects were enrolled, of whom 302 and 293 subjects formed the total vaccinated and according-to-protocol cohorts, respectively. Pre-challenge, 65. 4 % (95 % CI: 59. 6 – 70. 9) subjects were seroprotected (anti-HBs antibody concentration ≥ 10 mIU/mL). One month post-challenge, 97. 9 % (95 % CI: 95. 6 – 99. 2) were seroprotected, while 90. 8 % (95 % CI: 86. 8 – 93. 8) had anti-HBs antibody concentrations ≥ 100 mIU/mL.

40|$|Vaccination of mice with a peptide {{corresponding}} to the extracellular part of M 2 protein coupled to the immunodominant domain of hepatitis B core can protect mice from a lethal challenge with influenza A virus. As the extracellular part of M 2 protein is highly conserved in all known human influenza A strains, such a vaccine may protect against all human influenza A strains, which would represent a major advantage over current vaccine strategies. The present study demonstrates that protection is mediated exclusively by Abs, a very important feature of a successful preventive vaccine. However, these Abs neither bind efficiently to the free virus nor neutralize virus infection, but bind to M 2 protein expressed {{on the surface of}} virus-infected cells. The presence of NK cells is important for protection, whereas complement is not, supposing that protection is mediated via Ab-dependent, cell-mediated cytotoxicity. The absence of neutralizing Abs results in much weaker protection than that achieved by vaccination with UV-inactivated influenza virus. Specifically, whereas neutralizing Abs completely eliminate signs of disease even at high viral <b>challenge</b> <b>doses,</b> M 2 -specific Abs cannot prevent infection, but merely reduce disease at low <b>challenge</b> <b>doses.</b> M 2 -specific Abs fail to protect from high <b>challenge</b> <b>doses,</b> as vaccinated mice undergo lethal infection under these conditions.

To explore this question in a model relevant to human disease, ferrets were immunized with DNA/rAd 5 vaccines encoding NP, M 2, HA, NP+M 2 or HA+NP+M 2. Only HA or HA+NP+M 2 vaccination conferred protection against a stringent virus challenge.

40|$|Mucosal immune {{responses}} to fungal infection range from T helper type 2 (Th 2) cell-directed allergic inflammation to Th 1 -predominant neutrophilic inflammation, but the mechanisms directing these divergent mucosal immune outcomes {{and the role}} of T cells in host defense against mucosal fungal infections are not known. Here we examined the mouse mucosal immune {{responses to}} 12 filamentous environmental fungal species over a broad range of exposure doses and determined the requirement of T cells for host defense. For all tested fungi, low-grade conidium exposures induced Th 2 - and eosinophil-predominant allergic lung disease, whereas higher exposures led to rapid conversion to neutrophil- and Th 1 cell-predominant inflammation, a phenomenon we term immune phenotype switching. All fungal exposure doses were further linked to the secretion of interleukin- 17 A (IL- 17 A). Fungal infections with Curvularia lunata and Aspergillus fumigatus were typically confined to the airway during allergic inflammation but became locally invasive and disseminated to the brain at higher conidium <b>challenge</b> <b>doses,</b> in association with predominant Th 1 responses. Fungal dis-semination occurred at relatively low <b>challenge</b> <b>doses</b> with the conidia of Aspergillus fumigatus administered to recombinase activating gene 1 (Rag- 1) -deficient mice, which lack B and T cells, but B cell-deficient MT mice and T helper cell-reconstituted Rag- 1 -deficient mice were comparable to wild-type mice in preventing fungal dissemination. Our findings demonstrate that Th 2 cell-predominant allergic responses followed by immun...|$|E
40|$|Background: The vast {{majority}} of children will undergo their first exposure to common allergenic foods at home. However, the first exposure may lead to clinical reactions. It has been proposed to introduce allergenic foods gradually into the diets of children at risk for food allergy, but no practical dietary advice has been devised. Objective: The {{aim of this study}} was to devise safe introduction schedules for common allergenic foods for use at home, based on the <b>challenge</b> <b>doses</b> as administered in double-blind, placebo-controlled food challenge (DBPCFCs) in children who were never exposed previously to these foods. Methods: Seventy-two DBPCFCs were performed in 63 children as a first known exposure. The incrementing <b>challenge</b> <b>doses</b> were converted into equivalent portions of these foods in their usual household form and incorporated in introduction schedules. The feasibility of the introduction scales was tested in parents of the children attending our clinic. Results: Based on the results of the positive challenges (37) in which severe reactions did not occur, detailed introduction schedules and a reference photograph of the required increasing amounts of food were devised for use at home. Feasibility testing showed that, when using these introduction schedules, parents portioned the initial doses significantly lower than without detailed instructions. Conclusions: The introduction schedules and reference photograph provide information for parents to introduce the required amounts of allergenic foods in initial low doses at home. This is expected to improve the safety of this procedure...|$|E
40|$|C 57 BL/ 6 male mice {{injected}} with a <b>challenge</b> <b>dose</b> (20 mg/kg) of cocaine 72 h {{after the end}} of chronic intermittent treatment with the psychostimulant (two daily injections of 20 mg/kg for 10 days) exhibited a clear-cut increase in defensive upright and sideways postures and escape when confronted with a non-drugged conspecific. Treated mice spent 40 % of time showing defensive acts over the 5 -min testing session. Administration of the selective D 2 receptor antagonist (-) -sulpiride (25 mg/kg) before the <b>challenge</b> <b>dose</b> of cocaine completely antagonized the increase in defensive behaviour, while the selective D 1 receptor antagonist SCH 23390 (0. 25 - 0. 50 mg/kg) did not significantly affect defensive behavioural patterns. These results suggest the involvement of D 2 receptors in cocaine-induced hyperdefensiveness. The hypothesis that alteration in D 2 receptor functioning produced by chronic cocaine administration may produce hyperdefensiveness possibly due to altered perceptive processes is discussed...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} {{investigate}} the presence of adaptive response in cancerous cells, two monofunctional alkylating agents, namely, ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS) and methyl methanesulfonate (MMS), were employed to treat Ehrlich ascites carcinoma (EAC) cells in vivo. Conditioning dose of 80 [*]mg/kg body weight of EMS or 50 [*]mg/kg body weight of MMS and <b>challenging</b> <b>dose</b> of 240 [*]mg/kg body weight of EMS or 150 [*]mg/kg body weight of MMS were selected by pilot toxicity studies. Conditioned EAC cells when challenged after 8 [*]h time lag resulted in significant reduction in chromosomal aberrations compared to <b>challenging</b> <b>dose</b> of respective agents. As has been proved in earlier studies with normal organisms, even in cancerous cells (EAC), there is presence of adaptive response to methylating and ethylating agents. Furthermore, it is also interesting to note in the present studies that the methylating agent, MMS, is a stronger inducer of the adaptive response than the ethylating agent, EMS...|$|R
