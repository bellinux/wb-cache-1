40|$|The {{fragility}} (the abnormally strong {{temperature dependence}} of the viscosity) of <b>highly</b> <b>viscous</b> <b>liquids</b> is shown to have two sources. The first is the temperature {{dependence of the}} barriers between inherent states considered earlier. The second is the recently discovered asymmetry between the actual inherent state and its neighbors. One needs both terms for a quantitative description. PACS numbers: 64. 70. Pf, 77. 22. Gm Though there is as yet no generally accepted explanation of the flow in <b>highly</b> <b>viscous</b> <b>liquids</b> 1, 2, 3, {{it seems clear that}} its description requires the passage of high energy barriers between inherent states, i. e. local structural minima of the potential energy 4. According to the elastic models 2, the fragility stems from a proportionality of the height V of these barriers to the infinite frequency shear modulus G, which in the <b>highly</b> <b>viscous</b> <b>liquid</b> decreases strongly with temperature. The present paper shows that this {{is only part of the}} truth. There is a second source of fragility in the newly discovered 5 asymmetry of about 4 kBT between the actual inherent state and its neighbors, possibly due 6 to the elastic distortion accompanying a structural rearrangement (the ”Eshelby backstress ” 7). As will be seen, the quantitative explanation of the fragility of six different glass formers requires just this specific explanation of the asymmetry. The usual measure of the fragility of a glass former is the logarithmic slope of the relaxation time τα of the flow process m = d log τα/d(Tg/T) |Tg, (1) where the glass temperature Tg is defined as the temperature with τα = 1000 s. It is useful to relate τα to a critical barrier Vc via the Arrhenius relation τα = τ 0 exp(Vc/kBT), (2) where the microscopic attempt frequency is at 10 − 13 s, sixteen decades faster than the flow process at the glass temperature. The fragility index I is defined 2 by the logarithmic derivative I = −d lnVc/d lnT, taken at Tg...|$|R
40|$|The {{method of}} drop {{coalescence}} {{is used for}} determining the viscosity of <b>highly</b> <b>viscous</b> undercooled <b>liquids.</b> Low gravity environment is {{necessary in order to}} allow for examining large volumes affording much higher accuracy for the viscosity calculations than possible for smaller volumes available under 1 - g conditions.

40|$|It {{has been}} {{recently}} {{reported that in}} presence of low Reynolds number (Re<< 1) transport, preformed bacterial biofilms, several hours after their formation, may degenerate in form of filamentous structures, known as streamers. In this letter, we explain that such streamers form as the <b>highly</b> <b>viscous</b> <b>liquid</b> states of the intrinsically viscoelastic biofilms. Such "viscous liquid" state can be hypothesized by noting that the time of appearance of the streamers is substantially larger than the viscoelastic relaxation time scale of the biofilms, and this appearance is explained by the inability of a <b>viscous</b> <b>liquid</b> to withstand an external shear. Further, by identifying the post formation dynamics of the streamers {{as that of a}} <b>viscous</b> <b>liquid</b> jet in a surrounding flow field, we can interpret several unexplained issues associated with the post-formation dynamics of streamers, such as the clogging of the flow passage or the exponential time growth of streamer dimensions...|$|R
30|$|However, the {{mechanism}} is different {{at a rapid}} rotation rate, whereby the amount of wax deposits oddly increased at 600  rpm. This {{is contrary to the}} majority of results reported in the literature which show that wax deposits decrease with a higher rotation rate. This phenomenon was attributed to a few reasons: (1) shear thickening behaviour, (2) variation in the untreated wax deposit with reference to the shear and (3) amount of entrained crude oil in the wax deposits. Once the optimal rotation rate is exceeded, the wax content in the crude oil started to increase due to the shear thickening behaviour of the fluid which results from a <b>highly</b> <b>viscous</b> <b>liquid</b> (Ridzuan et al. 2015).|$|R
