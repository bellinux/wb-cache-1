50|$|The {{distinctive}} {{noise of}} a diesel engine is variably called diesel clatter, diesel nailing, or diesel knock. Diesel clatter is caused {{largely by the}} diesel combustion process; the sudden ignition of the diesel fuel when injected into the combustion chamber causes a pressure wave. Engine designers can reduce diesel clatter through: indirect injection; pilot or pre-injection; injection timing; injection rate; compression ratio; turbo boost; and exhaust gas recirculation (EGR). <b>Common</b> <b>rail</b> <b>diesel</b> <b>injection</b> systems permit multiple injection events {{as an aid to}} noise reduction. Diesel fuels with a higher octane rating modify the combustion process and reduce diesel clatter. CN (Cetane number) can be raised by distilling higher quality crude oil, by catalyzing a higher quality product or by using a cetane improving additive.|$|E

The effect of rail pressure, distillation profile, and consequent fuel viscosity on the drop size distribution developing during primary and secondary atomization was investigated. Samples of conventional crude-oil derived middle-distillate diesel and light distillate kerosene were delivered into an optically accessible mini-sac injector, using a customized high-pressure <b>common</b> <b>rail</b> <b>diesel</b> fuel <b>injection</b> system.

Results are presented for sprays obtained at maximum needle lift during the injection. These reveal that the emergent sprays exhibit axial asymmetry and vorticity. An increase in the rail pressure was observed to lead to finer atomization, with larger droplets observable in the neighbourhood of the central axis of the spray, decreasing with radius towards the spray boundaries. Finally, the light kerosene was observed to produce smaller droplets (as measured by Sauter mean diameter), relative to the conventional diesel, suggesting a correlation between distillation profile and viscosity, and mean spray droplet size...|$|R

Such powertrain platforms look set to remain the dominant source of heavy duty vehicle propulsion for decades to come. The currently reported work was concerned with experimental evaluation of the potential to partially displace diesel with hydrogen fuel, which continues to attract attention as a potential longer term alternative fuel solution whether produced on-board or remotely via sustainable methods. The single cylinder engine adopted was of 2. 0 litre capacity, with <b>common</b> <b>rail</b> <b>diesel</b> fuel <b>injection</b> and EGR typical of current production technology. The work involved fumigation of H 2 into the engine intake system at engine loads typically visited under real world driving conditions. Highest practical hydrogen substitution ratios increased indicated efficiency by up to 4. 6 % at 6 bar IMEPn and 2. 4 % at 12 bar IMEPn. In 6 bar IMEPn, CO 2, CO and soot all reduced by 58 %, 83 % and 58 % respectively while the corresponding reduction of these emissions in 12 bar IMEPn, were 27 %, 45 % and 71 % respectively toward diesel-only baseline.

40|$|An {{attempt to}} further {{understand}} {{the processes of}} auto-ignition, combustion and ultimately emission formation for a <b>common</b> <b>rail</b> <b>diesel</b> <b>injection</b> system, has lead to {{an investigation into the}} effects in-cylinder density and fuel injection pressure have on liquid penetration, vapour formation and auto-ignition delay. Although several correlations for diesel spray penetration at different operating conditions have been presented in the literature, to date the findings are in-conclusive with only limited investigation into the operating envelope expected in present and future high speed direct injection diesel engines. The present paper describes how two high-speed video cameras were utilised to achieved pseudo 3 -dimensional imaging of the spray (backlit) and of auto-ignition sites (flame lumines-cence). It also describes how Schlieren imaging enabled vapour phase analysis. Data have been gathered for in-cylinder densities in the range 10 to 50 kg. m- 3 and injection pressures be-tween 60 and 160 MPa. New correlations have been established for the penetration of both the liquid and vapour phases of a high-pressure diesel spray injected from a modern VCO nozzle common rail system. By increasing injection pressures and using small injector orifice sizes, it is thought that the injected diesel droplets reduce in size and penetrate further, hence increas-ing air utilisation, thus leading to faster evaporation rates and reduced ignition delay. An ex-perimental correlation for auto-ignition delay against in-cylinder density has been presented, suggesting that as the charge density increases, penetration is reduced but auto-ignition delay is reduced, indicating more favourable conditions for ignition. ...|$|E
40|$|In-cylinder {{blending}} {{of gasoline and}} diesel to achieve Reactivity Controlled Compression Ignition (RCCI) {{has been shown to}} reduce NOx and PM emissions while maintaining or improving brake thermal efficiency (BTE) as compared to conventional diesel combustion (CDC). The RCCI concept has an advantage over many advanced combustion strategies in that by varying both the percent of premixed gasoline and EGR rate, stable combustion can be extended over more of the light-duty drive cycle load range. Changing the percent of premixed gasoline changes the fuel reactivity stratification in the cylinder providing further control of combustion phasing and cylinder pressure rise rate than the use of EGR alone. This paper examines the combustion and emissions performance of light-duty diesel engine using direct injected diesel fuel and port injected gasoline to enable RCCI for steady-state engine conditions which are consistent with a light-duty drive cycle. A GM 1. 9 L four-cylinder engine with the stock compression ratio of 17. 5 : 1, <b>common</b> <b>rail</b> <b>diesel</b> <b>injection</b> system, high-pressure EGR system and variable geometry turbocharger was modified to allow for port fuel injection with gasoline. Engine-out emissions, engine performance and combustion behavior for RCCI operation is compared against both CDC and a premixed charge compression ignition (PCCI) strategy which relies on high levels of EGR dilution. The effect of percent of premixed gasoline, EGR rate, boost level, intake mixture temperature, combustion phasing, and cylinder pressure rise rate is investigated for RCCI combustion for the light-duty modal points. Engine-out emissions of NOX and PM were found to be considerably lower for RCCI operation as compared to CDC and PCCI, while HC and CO emissions were higher. BTE was similar or higher for many of the modal conditions for RCCI operation. The emissions results are used to estimate hot-start FTP- 75 emissions levels with RCCI and are compared against CDC and PCCI modes...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: In diesel engines, {{accurate}} EGR {{control is}} important {{due to its}} effect on nitrogen oxide and particulate matter emissions. Conventional EGR control system comprises a PI feedback controller for tracking target air mass flow and a feedforward controller for fast response. Physically, the EGR flow is affected by EGR valve lift and thermodynamic properties of the EGR path, such as pressures and temperatures. However, the conventional feedforward control output is indirectly derived from engine operating conditions, such as engine rotational speed and fuel injection quantity. Accordingly, the conventional feedforward control action counteracts the feedback controller in certain operating conditions. In order to improve this disadvantage, in this study, we proposed feedforward EGR control algorithm based on a physical model of the EGR system. The proposed EGR control strategy was validated with a 3. 0 liter <b>common</b> <b>rail</b> direct <b>injection</b> <b>diesel</b> engine equipped with a DC motor type EGR valve...|$|R
40|$|Most modern {{high-pressure}} <b>common</b> <b>rail</b> <b>diesel</b> fuel <b>injection</b> systems employ {{an internal}} pressure equalization system {{in order to}} provide the force necessary to support needle lift, enabling precise control of the injected fuel mass. This results in the return of a substantial proportion of the high-pressure diesel back to the fuel tank. The diesel fuel flow occurring in the injector spill passages {{is expected to be a}} cavitating flow, which is known to promote fuel ageing. The cavitation of diesel promotes nano-particle formation through induced pyrolysis and oxidation, which may result in deposit formation in the vehicle fuel system. A purpose-built high-pressure cavitation flow rig has been employed to investigate the stability of unadditised crude-oil derived diesel and a paraffin-blend model diesel, which were subjected to continuous hydrodynamic cavitation flow across a single-hole research diesel nozzle. Continuous in-situ spectral optical extinction (405 nm) has been employed to identify, determine and measure variations in fuel composition as a function of the cavitation duration. The results of two high-pressure diesel cavitation experiments are reported. The first dealt with the effect of injection pressure on the rate of induced variation in chemical composition of diesel, and concluded that faster degradation of the fuel occurred at higher pressure. The second experiment involved an investigation into the variation in composition occurring in diesel fuel and the paraffin-blend model diesel, subjected to cavitating flow over a longer duration. Observed differences suggest that the high-pressure cavitation resulted in hydrodynamic sono-chemical destruction of aromatics in the diesel, which is believed to lead to carbonaceous nano-particle formation...|$|R
40|$|Atomization {{characteristics}} of liquid fuel sprays control combustion efficiency and emissions in engines. The present work {{is motivated by}} the need to study the atomization and spray structure of vegetable oil biofuels for which no data in the literature exists. In this work, various laser-based diagnostic techniques such as laser shadowgraphy, Particle/Droplet Image Analysis (PDIA) and Laser Sheet Dropsizing (LSD) are applied for studying atomization characteristics, tip penetration, droplet size and liquid volume fraction of Pongamia vegetable oil (SVO) and its blends with diesel. A constant volume high pressure spray visualization chamber is designed and fabricated to study SVO sprays at high gas pressure and temperature conditions. This optical chamber can be used for gas pressures up to 60 bar and temperatures up to 600 K. Optical access inside the chamber is provided through four quartz windows to perform various optical spray diagnostic studies. A high pressure spray injection facility based on components of <b>common</b> <b>rail</b> <b>diesel</b> <b>injection</b> system is designed. This facility can provide an injection pressure of up to 1700 bar with independent control over injection duration and timing. A marked difference is observed between diesel and SVO spray structures under atmospheric gas pressure condition. A very interesting observation related to the behavior of 100 % SVO fuel when sprayed into atmospheric pressure is the presence of an intact liquid core even at injection pressure as high as 1600 bar. The presence of liquid core at high injection pressures is attributed to the high viscosity of SVOs and the non-Newtonian behavior of these oils under high pressure and shear. The spray characterization of the oil and its blends at high gas pressure shows that although the atomization is dramatically different from that at atmospheric gas pressure, it is still incomplete even at very high injection pressures. For a gas pressure of 30 bar, it is observed that the Sauter Mean Diameter (SMD) for Pongamia oil is more than twice that of diesel. A new method of simultaneously obtaining two-dimensional droplet size and quantitative liquid volume fraction data in sprays has been developed. Measurements with this method reveal a higher liquid volume fraction at the central axis of spray for Pongamia oil compared to that of diesel indicating potentially poor air-fuel mixing. The experimental data obtained and the spray tip penetration correlations developed for the vegetable oils and blends serve as useful inputs for fuel injection and engine system designers...|$|E
40|$|This work {{concentrates}} on investigating the combustion and emission characteristics of diesel engine running on butanol-diesel blends.

The test was carried out under two engine loads at a constant engine speed, using various combinations of EGR ratios and injection timings.

Increasing EGR ratio and retarding injection timing are effective approaches to reduce NOx emissions from combustion of butanol-diesel blends.

40|$|With a push to {{continuously}} develop traditional engine technology efficiencies {{and meet}} stringent emissions requirements, {{there is a}} need to improve the precision of injection rate measurement used to characterise the performance of the fuel injectors. New challenges in precisely characterising injection rate present themselves to the Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs), with the additional requirements to measure multiple injection strategies, increased injection pressure and rate features. One commonly used method of measurement is the rate tube injection analyser; it measures the pressure wave caused by the injection within a column of stationary fluid. In a rate tube, one of the significant sources of signal distortion is a result of the injected fluid pressure waves reflected back from the tube termination. Cepstral analysis has shown to be a useful tool when evaluating formants in speech analysis, evaluating speaker harmonics and identifying sideband families in mechanical systems for fault identification. It is of particular usefulness in single input multiple output systems where the signal is distorted by echoes from its source. This study employs cepstrum analysis for evaluating fluid born frequencies present in a rate tube injection measurement device in order to identify sources of distortion in the injection rate signal. A rate tube was used to measure the rate of injection from a Delphi EURO 6 commercial vehicle <b>common</b> <b>rail</b> <b>diesel</b> injector. <b>Injection</b> rate signals were acquired under stable temperature conditions then digitally processed and its cepstrum evaluated. With knowledge of the system, this study shows that it is possible to identify the influence of components on the system and sources of signal distortion present in the rate measurement using quefrency and rahmonics.

Test fuels were prepared by blending 0, 10, 20, 30 and 40 vol% ETBE to a commercial diesel fuel. Increasing ETBE fraction in the fuel helps to suppress the smoke emission increasing with EGR, but a too high fraction of ETBE leads to misfiring at higher EGR rates. While the combustion noise and NOx emissions increase with increases in ETBE fraction at relatively low EGR rates, they can be suppressed to low levels by increasing EGR. Though there are no significant increases in THC and CO emissions due to ETBE addition to diesel fuel {{in a wide range of}} EGR rates, the ETBE blended fuel results in higher aldehyde emissions than the pure diesel fuel at relatively low EGR rates. With the 30 % ETBE blended fuel, the operating load range of smokeless, ultra-low NOx (< 0. 5 g/kWi･h), and efficient diesel combustion with high rates of cooled EGR is extended to higher loads than with the pure diesel fuel...|$|R

IVC (inlet valve closing) timings were set at up to 60  CA (crank angle) degrees earlier than the production setting of 37 ° ABDC for the engine. At the earliest timing, effective compression ratio was reduced from 15. 2 : 1 to 13. 7 : 1. The effects on emissions were significant only for EIVC settings at least 40  CA degrees earlier than the production setting, and were sensitive to engine load. At 2  bar BMEP (brake mean effective pressure) and fixed levels of NOx, soot emissions were reduced but CO (carbon monoxide) and HC (hydrocarbon) increased unless fuel rail pressure was reduced. With increasing load, soot reduction diminished and was negligible at 6  bar BMEP; CO and HC emissions deteriorated further. At all conditions, EIVC raised exhaust gas temperature by > 50  °C; the effect on fuel economy was negligible or a fuel economy penalty. Comparisons indicate cylinder deactivation is the more effective strategy for reducing engine-out emissions of HC and CO and raising exhaust gas temperature under light load operating conditions...|$|R

Microbial biomass was converted through in situ transesterification. Methyl esters were then extracted using chloroform which was then distilled off before a final vacuum distillation of the methyl esters to ensure fuel purity. Engine testing was performed to quantify the performance and emissions from combustion of each fuel in a Tier 3, turbocharged, 4 -cylinder, 4. 5 L John Deere PowerTech Plus <b>common</b> <b>rail,</b> direct <b>injection</b> <b>diesel</b> engine.

The high temperatures experienced {{as a result of the}} implosion of fuel vapour bubbles are sufficient to produce pyrolytic degradation and dehydrogenation, as well as a growth mechanism that results in the formation of small particles that have similarities with the primary soot particles produced during diesel combustion. These nanosized particles agglomerate as a result of kinetically driven collisions during cavitation to form a dispersion of micron sized particles in the treated hydrocarbon. The particles are carbonaceous in character, being a mixture of amorphous and graphitic-like carbon. The mass of material produced increases with the C/H atomic ratio of the hydrocarbon undergoing cavitation and is decreased through the addition (1 - 3 %v/v) of low boiling paraffinic hydrocarbons, possibly as a result of lowering the temperature developed inside imploding cavities. Dispersions of microparticles contain equilibrated levels of nanoparticles. If sufficiently high numbers of these smaller primary particles are present they agglomerate due to thermally driven collisions during post-cavitation storage.

40|$|In this study, the {{biodiesel}} {{properties and}} effects of blends of oil methyl ester petroleum diesel on a CI direct <b>injection</b> <b>diesel</b> engine is investigated. Blends {{were obtained from the}} marine dinoflagellate Crypthecodinium cohnii and waste cooking oil. The experiment was conducted using a four-cylinder, turbo-charged <b>common</b> <b>rail</b> direct <b>injection</b> <b>diesel</b> engine at four loads (25 %, 50 %, 75 % and 100 %). Three blends (10 %, 20 % and 50 %) of microalgae oil methyl ester and a 20 % blend of waste cooking oil methyl ester were compared to petroleum diesel. To establish suitability of the fuels for a CI engine, the effects of the three microalgae fuel blends at different engine loads were assessed by measuring engine performance, i. e. mean effective pressure (IMEP), brake mean effective pressure (BMEP), in cylinder pressure, maximum pressure rise rate, brake-specific fuel consumption (BSFC), brake thermal efficiency (BTE), heat release rate and gaseous emissions (NO, NO and unburned hydrocarbons (UHC)). Results were then compared to engine performance characteristics for operation with a 20 % waste cooking oil/petroleum diesel blend and petroleum diesel. In addition, physical and chemical properties of the fuels were measured. Use of microalgae methyl ester reduced the instantaneous cylinder pressure and engine output torque, when compared to that of petroleum diesel, by a maximum of 4. 5 % at 50 % blend at full throttle. The lower calorific value of the microalgae oil methyl ester blends increased the BSFC, which ultimately reduced the BTE by up to 4 % at higher loads. Minor reductions of IMEP and BMEP were recorded for both the microalgae and the waste cooking oil methyl ester blends at low loads, with a maximum of 7 % reduction at 75 % load compared to petroleum diesel. Furthermore, compared to petroleum diesel, gaseous emissions of NO and NO increased for operations with biodiesel blends. At full load, NO and NO emissions increased by 22 % when 50 % microalgae blends were used. Petroleum diesel and a 20 % blend of waste cooking oil methyl ester had emissions of UHC that were similar, but those of microalgae oil methyl ester/petroleum diesel blends were reduced by at least 50 % for all blends and engine conditions. The tested microalgae methyl esters contain some long-chain, polyunsaturated fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) (C 22 : 5 and C 22 : 6) not commonly found in terrestrial-crop-derived biodiesels yet all fuel properties were satisfied or were very close to the ASTM 6751 - 12 and EN 14214 standards.

40|$|The thesis {{presents}} {{investigations of}} advanced combustion strategies {{in a modern}} V 6 diesel engine fuelled with mineral diesel and Tallow Methyl Ester (TME) -diesel blends, {{in order to meet}} future emissions legislation. One of the main objectives of this research is to improve fuel consumption whilst minimising engine emissions through the combined effects of injection strategy (fuel injection pressure, dwell period, pilot fuel quantity) and cooled Exhaust Gas Recirculation (EGR) on a modern V 6 <b>common</b> <b>rail</b> direct <b>injection</b> <b>diesel</b> engine. In the case of using EGR (49 – 52 %) at 1500 rpm and 10 % of engine peak torque, by increasing the fuel injection pressure from 300 to 800 bar, engine thermal efficiency increased from 16. 5 to 19. 1 % and 17. 1 to 19. 7 %, BSFC decreased by 13. 5 % and 13. 2 %, smoke level decreased by 74. 3 % and 70. 1 % and NOx emissions increased by 69. 6 % and 68. 0 %, respectively for a short (5 CAD) and a long (40 CAD) dwell period. In addition, the study of a variation of pilot fuel quantities (0. 8 – 3. 0 mg/stroke) with a fixed dwell period (5 CAD) at two different fuel injection pressures (250 bar and 800 bar) shows that the smaller pilot quantity with the higher fuel injection pressure can be considered as an enhanced strategy to control engine performance and emissions simultaneously. Therefore, the combination of higher injection pressure, longer dwell, smaller pilot quantity and the use of EGR could potentially improve fuel consumption and minimise engine emissions. The use of TME-diesel blends results in lower engine thermal efficiency and higher fuel consumption and NOx emissions. In the case of 1500 rpm and 25 % of engine peak torque, the combustion of TME 10 and TME 30 reduced the engine thermal efficiency from iii 35. 3 to 33. 7 % and 35. 3 to 33. 2 % and increased the BSFC by 4. 9 % and 6. 5 %, respectively. At the same engine condition, the combustion of TME-diesel blends increased NOx emissions by 1. 8 % and 10. 0 % and reduced CO by 0. 9 % and 1. 8 %, THCs by 18. 0 % and 23. 9 %, smoke by 30 % and 51. 7 % for TME 10 and TME 30 respectively. However, the engine thermal efficiency, BSFC and NOx emissions could be improved with the application of the combined effect of injection strategy (fuel injection pressure, dwell period, pilot fuel quantity) and EGR as shown in the first phase of this study.
