The main aim {{of this study was to}} characterize in smooth muscle of proximal segments of human ureter, the mechanical properties at level of muscle tissue and at level of myosin molecular motors. Methods: Ureteral samples were collected from 15 patients, who underwent nephrectomy for renal cancer. Smooth muscle strips longitudinally and circularly oriented from proximal segments of human ureter were used for the in vitro experiments. Mechanical indices including the maximum unloaded shortening velocity (Vmax), and the maximum isometric tension (P 0) normalized per cross-sectional area, were determined in vitro determined in electrically evoked contractions of longitudinal and circular smooth muscle strips.

40|$|Background. The {{effects of}} {{halogenated}} anaesthetics on cross-bridge (CB) kinetics are unclear. As halogenated anaesthetics do not markedly modify the intracellular calcium transient in the diaphragm, we used an isolated rat diaphragm preparation {{to assess the}} effects of halothane and iso¯urane on CB kinetics. Methods. The effects of halothane and iso¯urane (1 and 2 minimum alveolar concentration (MAC)) on rat diaphragm muscle strips were studied in vitro (Krebs±Henseleit solution, 29 °C, oxygen 95 %/carbon dioxide 5 %) in tetanus mode (50 Hz). From the force±velocity curve and using A. F. Huxley's equations, we determined the main mechanical and energetic variables and calculated CB kinetics. Results. At 1 and 2 MAC, iso¯urane and halothane induced no signi®cant inotropic effects. Whatever the concentrations tested, halothane and iso¯urane did not signi®cantly modify the <b>CB</b> <b>number,</b> the elementary force per CB, the attachment and detachment constants, the dur-ation of the CB cycle and mean CB velocity.

40|$|Impaired {{functions}} of myocardial muscle cells in human and animals, {{is a primary}} defect associated with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). The pathophysiological mechanisms implicated in the DCM are yet to be clarified and an effective therapy is still not available. The BIO TO- 2 cardiomyopathic Syrian Hamsters (CMSHs) represent an animal model of idiopathic DCM. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the effect of long-term treatment (2 months) with propionyl-L-carnitine (PLC), coenzyme Q(10), omega- 3 fatty acids and a combination of these three agents (formulation HS 12607) on mechanical properties and actomyosin crossbridges (CBs) kinetics of left ventricular (LV) papillary muscle from control and treated to month old BIO TO- 2 CMSHs. Isometric and isotonic contractile properties of isolated papillary muscle from control and treated CMSHs were investigated, and acto-myosin <b>CB</b> <b>number,</b> force and kinetics were calculated using Huxley's equations. Mechanical parameter values were higher in treated than in control hamsters, particularly when substances were administered together in a coformulation (HS 12607). Compared to control, HS 12607 -treated papillary muscles showed a significant increase of maximum peak isometric tension (P(o)) (30. 06 +/- 4. 91 vs. 19. 74 +/- 5. 00 mN/mm(2)), maximum extent of muscle shortening (0. 13 +/- 0. 03 vs. 0. 07 +/- 0. 02 L/L(max),), maximum unloaded shortening velocity (1. 18 +/- 0. 24 vs. 0. 53 +/- 0. 13 L/L(max) s(- 1)) and maximum peak of power output (5. 52 +/- 1. 61 vs. 1. 58 +/- 0. 83). The curvature of the hyperbolic force-velocity relationships did not differ between control and treated hamsters. When compared to controls, acto-myosin <b>CB</b> <b>number</b> increased in treated hamsters [(6. 67 +/- 1. 91) 10 (10) /mm(2) vs. (3. 55 +/- 2. 08) 10 (10) /mm(2) ], whereas the unitary force of single CB was similar in control and treated animals. The peak value of the rate constant for CB attachment (f(1)) and detachment (g(2)) was higher in treated animals when compared to control. (93. 87 +/- 25. 82 vs. 47. 28 +/- 10. 88 s(- 1) and 214. 40 +/- 44. 64 vs. 95. 56 +/- 23. 49 s(- 1), respectively). In conclusion, the present study illustrates that supplementation with PLC, Cog and omega- 3 fatty acids improved motor parameters, energetic, and CB kinetics of BIO TO- 2 CMSH papillary muscle indicating that these naturally occurring substances may be a valid adjuvant to conventional therapy in DCM...|$|E

The obtained results showed the presence of highly agyrophylic extranucleolar bodies in microspore and developing pollen cells, which were finally identified as Cajal bodies. In all cases, a strong accumulation of snRNP-indicating molecules including TMG cap, Sm proteins and U 2 snRNA, was observed in the examined nuclear bodies. In contrast to their number the size of the identified structures did not change significantly during pollen development. In the microspore and the vegetative cell of pollen grains CBs were more numerous than in the generative cell. At later stages of pollen development, a drastic decrease in <b>CB</b> <b>number</b> was observed and, just before anthesis, a complete lack of these structures was indicated in both pollen nuclei.

The composition and dynamics of CBs in cells of living organisms is not well understood. Here we establish the zebrafish embryo as a model system to investigate the properties of CBs during rapid growth and cell division, {{taking advantage of the}} ease of live-cell imaging. We show that zebrafish embryo CBs contain coilin and multiple components of the pre-mRNA splicing machinery. Histone mRNA 3 ′ end processing factors, present in CBs in some systems, were instead concentrated in a distinct nuclear body. CBs were present in embryos before and after activation of zygotic gene expression, indicating a maternal contribution of CB components. During the first 24 hours of development, embryonic cells displayed up to 30 CBs per nucleus; these dispersed prior to mitosis and reassembled within minutes upon daughter cell nucleus formation. Following zygotic genome activation, snRNP biogenesis was required for CB assembly and maintenance, suggesting a self-assembly process that determines CB numbers in embryos. Differentiation into muscle, neurons and epidermis was associated with the achievement of a steady state number of 2 CBs per nucleus.

40|$|Cerium oxide {{and mixed}} Cu/Ce oxide {{nanoparticles}} were {{prepared by the}} oil-in-water (O/W) microemulsion reaction method in mild conditions. The Cu/Ce molar ratio was varied between 0 / 100 and 50 / 50. According to X-ray diffraction (XRD), below 30 / 70 Cu/Ce molar ratio, the materials presented a single phase consistent with cubic fluorite CeO 2. However, above Cu/Ce molar ratio 30 / 70, an excess monoclinic CuO phase in coexistence with the predominant Cu/Ce mixed oxide was detected by XRD and High-Resolution Transmission Electron Microscopy (HRTEM). Raman spectroscopy showed that oxygen vacancies increased significantly as the Cu content was increased. Band gap (E g) was investigated {{as a function of}} the Cu/Ce molar ratio, resulting in values from 2. 91 eV for CeO 2 to 2. 32 eV for the mixed oxide with 30 / 70 Cu/Ce molar ratio. These results indicate that below 30 / 70 Cu/Ce molar ratio, Cu 2 + is at least partially incorporated into the ceria lattice and very well dispersed in general. In addition, the photodegradation of Indigo Carmine dye under visible light irradiation was explored for selected samples; it was shown that these materials can remove such contaminants, either by adsorption and/or photodegradation. The results obtained will encourage investigation into the optical and photocatalytic properties of these mixed oxides, for widening their potential applications. C. S. and K. P.

There were 687 patients with a first CB HSCT {{and a total of}} 763 allogeneic CB HSCT but no autologous CB HSCT reported in the year 2008. The 687 first transplants correspond to 6 % of the total 11, 408 allogeneic HSCT. All CB HSCT were for haematological indications; there were no CB transplants reported amongst the 598 cellular transplants listed for non-hematopoietic use. Indications were different depending on donor type. Main indications for the 48 HLA identical family donors CB HSCT were non-malignant disorders (36; 75 %) and acute leukaemia (8; 17 %). Main indications for the 639 unrelated first CB HSCT were acute leukaemia (337; 53 %), non-malignant disorders (115; 18 %) and lymphoproliferative disorders (53; 8 %). 159 teams out of the 368 teams performing allogeneic HSCT (43 %) reported 1 to 37 CB HSCT (median 3).

40|$|A major {{challenge}} in neuroscience {{is to determine}} the nanoscale position and quantity of signaling molecules in a cell type- and subcellular compartment-specific manner. We developed a new approach to this problem by combining cell-specific physiological and anatomical characterization with super-resolution imaging and studied the molecular and structural parameters shaping the physiological properties of synaptic endocannabinoid signaling in the mouse hippocampus. We found that axon terminals of perisomatically projecting GABAergic interneurons possessed increased <b>CB</b> 1 receptor <b>number,</b> active-zone complexity and receptor/effector ratio compared with dendritically projecting interneurons, consistent with higher efficiency of cannabinoid signaling at somatic versus dendritic synapses. Furthermore, chronic Δ(9) -tetrahydrocannabinol administration, which reduces cannabinoid efficacy on GABA release, evoked marked CB 1 downregulation in a dose-dependent manner. Full receptor recovery required several weeks after the cessation of Δ(9) -tetrahydrocannabinol treatment.

40|$|International audienceThe {{cannabinoid}} CB receptor-mediated modulation of γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) {{release from}} inhibitory interneurons {{is important for}} the integrity of hippocampal-dependent spatial memory. Although adenosine A receptors have a central role in fine-tuning excitatory transmission in the hippocampus, A receptors localized in GABAergic cells do not directly influence GABA release. CB and A receptors are the main targets for the effects of two of the most heavily consumed psychoactive substances worldwide: Δ-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC, a CB receptor agonist) and caffeine (an adenosine receptor antagonist). We first tested the hypothesis that an A-CB interaction influences GABA and glutamate release in the hippocampus. We found that A receptor activation attenuated the CB-mediated inhibition of GABA and glutamate release and this interaction was manifested at the level of G-protein activation. Using in vivo and in vitro approaches, we then investigated the functional implications of the adenosine-cannabinoid interplay that may arise following chronic caffeine consumption. Chronic administration of caffeine in mice (i. p., 3 mg/kg/day, for 15 days, > 12 h before trials) led to an A-mediated enhancement of the CB-dependent acute disruptive effects of THC on a short-term spatial memory task, despite inducing a reduction in cortical and hippocampal <b>CB</b> receptor <b>number</b> and an attenuation of CB coupling with G-protein. A receptor levels were increased following chronic caffeine administration. This study demonstrates that A receptors exert a negative modulatory effect on CB-mediated inhibition of GABA release, and provides the first evidence of chronic caffeine-induced alterations on the cannabinoid system in cortex and hippocampus, with functional implications in spatial memory...|$|R
40|$|Adolescence is a {{well defined}} {{developmental}} period during which marijuana use is common. However, {{little is known about}} the response to marijuana in adolescents compared with adults. We have shown previously that adolescent rats are more impaired than adults by 9 -tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the main psychoactive compound in marijuana, in a spatial learning task, but the mechanism responsible for this differen-tial impairment is not understood. We determined the role of THC tolerance and cannabinoid receptor type 1 (CB 1) regula-tion in THC-induced spatial learning impairment in adolescent and adult rats. We measured the development of tolerance to THC-induced learning impairment in adolescent (postnatal days 30 – 35) and adult (postnatal days 70 – 75) rats. We pre-treated them for 5 days with 10 mg/kg THC, and then evaluated the effects of vehicle or THC treatment on learning during training in the Morris water maze. We also determined <b>CB</b> 1 <b>number</b> and functional coupling in the hippocampus of adoles-cents and adults. Finally, we measured the time course of hippocampal CB 1 desensitization in adolescents and adults during treatment with 10 mg/kg THC or vehicle. Our results indicate that adults, but not adolescents, become tolerant to the effects of THC during water maze training after 5 days of pretreatment. CB 1 s in adolescent hippocampus are less func-tionally coupled to G proteins and desensitize more slowly in response to THC treatment than those of adults. THC may impair learning in adolescents more than in adults because of delayed activation of cellular homeostatic adaptive mecha-nisms underlying cannabinoid tolerance in the hippocampus...|$|R
40|$|Addiction as a {{psychiatric}} disorder involves interaction of inherited predispositions and environmental factors. Similarly to humans, laboratory animals self-administer addictive drugs, whose appetitive properties result from activation and suppression of brain reward and aversive pathways, respectively. The {{ventral tegmental area}} (VTA) where dopamine (DA) cells are located is {{a key component of}} brain reward circuitry, whereas the rostromedial tegmental nucleus (RMTg) critically regulates aversive behaviors. Reduced responses to either aversive intrinsic components of addictive drugs or to negative consequences of compulsive drug taking might contribute to vulnerability to addiction. In this regard, female Lister Hooded (LH) rats are more vulnerable than male counterparts to cannabinoid self-administration. We, therefore, took advantage of sex differences displayed by LH rats, and studied VTA DA neuronal properties to unveil functional differences. Electrophysiological properties of DA cells were examined performing either single cell extracellular recordings in anesthetized rats or whole-cell patch-clamp recordings in slices. In vivo, DA cell spontaneous activity was similar, though sex differences were observed in RMTg-induced inhibition of DA neurons. In vitro, DA cells showed similar intrinsic and synaptic properties. However, females displayed larger depolarization-induced suppression of inhibition (DSI) than male LH rats. DSI, an endocannabinoid-mediated form of short term plasticity, was mediated by 2 -arachidonoylglycerol (2 -AG) activating type 1 -cannabinoid (CB 1) receptors. We found that sex-dependent differences in DSI magnitude were not ascribed to <b>CB</b> 1 <b>number</b> and/or function, but rather to a tonic 2 -AG signaling. We suggest that sex specific tonic 2 -AG signaling might contribute to regulate responses to aversive intrinsic properties to cannabinoids, thus resulting in faster acquisition/initiation of cannabinoid taking and, eventually, in progression to addiction...|$|R

40|$|Addiction is a {{psychiatric}} disorder, whose aetiology involves interaction of inherited predispositions and environmental factors. Both clinical and preclinical {{findings indicate that}} there are important genetic variations in vulnerability to drug addiction, and that such differences may be mediated by the same biological mechanisms. Addictive drugs share the properties of being self-administered by laboratory animals, and of activating the brain reward circuitry, which stems from the ventral tegmental area (VTA) where dopamine (DA) cells are located. Endocannabinoids serve as retrograde signaling molecules at many synapses in the brain, including the VTA, and regulate reward seeking by modulating DA signaling. We took advantage of significant differences between pairs of lines of rats selectively bred for their voluntary alcohol preference or aversion, that is Sardinian alcohol-preferring (sP) or nonpreferring (sNP) rat line. We have found that depolarization-induced suppression of inhibition (DSI), a form of endocannabinoid-mediated short term synaptic plasticity, is differently expressed by two discrete sets of inhibitory synapses arising from rostral and caudal afferents onto VTA DA neurons. This phenomenon is selectively mediated by the endocannabinoid 2 -arachidonoylglycerol (2 -AG), which activates presynaptic type 1 -cannabinoid (CB 1) receptors. However, the two discrete DSI {{do not seem to}} depend upon differences in <b>CB</b> 1 <b>number</b> and/or function, but rather on the rate 2 -AG is degraded. Thus, 2 -AG by differently depressing inhibitory synapses arising from either rostral or caudal afferents might indirectly alter DA neuron functional state, and enhance the responsiveness of the reward pathway to phasic DA. Given that sP rats are vulnerable phenotypes, and that they possess this endocannabinoid-mediated form of short term plasticity, our results suggest that differences in equipment of the endocannabinoid system machinery might control specific sources of vulnerability. ...|$|R

MWCNT were dispersed in dipalmitoyl lecithin (DPL), a component of pulmonary surfactant, and the effects of dispersion in DPL were compared to those in two other media: ethanol (EtOH) and phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Effects of MWCNT were also compared to those of two asbestos fibers (chrysotile and crocidolite) and carbon black (CB) nanoparticles, not only in A 549 cells but also in mesothelial cells (MeT 5 A human cell line), used as an asbestos-sensitive cell type. MWCNT formed agglomerates on top of both cell lines (surface area 15 - 35 microm(2)) that were significantly larger and more numerous in PBS than in EtOH and DPL. Whatever the dispersion media, incubation with 100 microg/ml MWCNT induced a similar decrease in metabolic activity without changing cell membrane permeability or apoptosis. Neither MWCNT cellular internalization nor oxidative stress was observed.

40|$|Alcoholism is a {{psychiatric}} disorder, whose aetiology involves inherited predispositions and environmental factors. Alcohol activates the brain reward circuitry, which {{stems from the}} ventral tegmental area (VTA) where dopamine (DA) cells are located. Among synaptic inputs that regulate DA neuron impulse activity, those arising from the newly identified rostromedial tegmental nucleus (RMTg) play a major role. DA neurons can escape their afferent control by releasing endocannabinoids, which serve as retrograde signaling molecules at many synapses in the brain. In this study we took advantage of significant differences between pairs of lines of rats selectively bred for their voluntary alcohol preference or aversion, that is the Sardinian alcohol-preferring (sP) or nonpreferring (sNP) rat line and investigated their electrophysiological properties and synaptic plasticity both in vivo and in vitro. Extracellular single unit recordings in anesthetized rats revealed a difference in baseline firing activity of DA neurons between sP and sNP rats consistent with our previous study (Melis et al., 2009). More particularly, sP rats showed an increased spontaneous neuronal activity that was paralleled by a reduced strength of RMTg inputs. This enhanced firing activity of DA cells in sP rats negatively correlated with the duration of inhibition elicited by electrical stimulation of the RMTg. We next examined one form of short-term synaptic plasticity mediated by endocannabinoids that is depolarization-induced suppression of inhibition (DSI), at inhibitory synapses of DA cells. We have found that DSI is differently expressed by two discrete sets of inhibitory synapses arising from rostral and caudal afferents onto VTA DA neurons. This phenomenon is selectively mediated by the endocannabinoid 2 -arachidonoylglycerol (2 -AG), which activates presynaptic type 1 -cannabinoid (CB 1) receptors.

To investigate the potential usefulness of CB stem and progenitor cell populations to deliver new genetic material into the blood and immune systems, we have transduced these cells using retroviral technology and compared the efficiency of gene transfer into CB cells with normal adult human bone marrow cells using a variety of infection protocols. Using two retroviral vectors which differ significantly in both recombinant viral titers and vector design, low density CB or adult bone marrow (ABM) cells were infected, and committed progenitor and more primitive hematopoietic cells were analyzed for gene expression by G 418 drug resistance (G 418 r) of neophosphotransferase and protein analysis for murine adenosine deaminase (mADA). Standard methylcellulose progenitor assays were used to quantitate transduction efficiency of committed progenitor cells, and the long term culture-initiating cell (LTC-IC) assay was used to quantitate transduction efficiency of more primitive cells. Our results indicate that CB cells were more efficiently transduced via retroviral- mediated gene transfer as compared with ABM-derived cells. In addition, stable expression of the introduced gene sequences, including the ADA cDNA, was demonstrated in the progeny of infected LTC-ICs after 5 wk in long-term marrow cultures. Expression of the introduced ADA cDNA was higher than the endogenous human ADA gene in the LTC-IC-derived colonies examined. These studies demonstrate that CB progenitor and stem cells can be efficiently infected using retroviral vectors and suggest that CB cells may provide a suitable target population in gene transfer protocols for some genetic diseases...|$|R
40|$|Adolescence is a behaviorally {{well-defined}} developmental {{period during}} which experimentation with illicit drugs such as marijuana is common. While the lasting effects of adolescent marijuana use have been studied in humans and in animal models, relatively {{little is known about}} the acute response to marijuana in adolescents. It is known that adolescent rats are more impaired by the psychoactive ingredient in marijuana, delta- 9 tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), than adults in a water maze spatial learning task. However, what causes this greater sensitivity to THC-induced learning impairment is not understood. We characterized adolescent (postnatal day 30 - 35) and adult (postnatal day 70 - 75) rat cannabinoid <b>CB</b> 1 receptor <b>number,</b> distribution, and functional coupling in the hippocampus, the brain which may be the site at which THC impairs spatial learning impairment. Next, we elucidated the time course of hippocampal CB 1 receptor desensitization in adolescents and adults in response to daily treatment with 10 mg/kg THC. Finally, we characterized the development of tolerance to the learning impairment caused by THC in adolescent and adult rats by pre-treating them for five days with 10 mg/kg THC, and measuring learning performance in the Morris water maze. Our results indicate that agonist stimulation of the CB 1 receptor in adolescent hippocampus produces less functional coupling to G proteins than adults. Also, adolescent hippocampal CB 1 receptors desensitize less rapidly in response to 10 mg/kg THC treatment than those in adults. Finally, adolescent rats do not become tolerant to the learning impairment effects of 10 mg/kg THC after five days of pre-treatment, while adults do. We conclude that adolescents may be more impaired by THC than adults as a result of more slowly desensitizing hippocampal CB 1 receptors, which may be due to lesser functional CB 1 -G protein coupling in adolescents.

40|$|The {{cannabinoid}} CB 1 receptor-mediated modulation of γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) {{release from}} inhibitory interneurons {{is important for}} the integrity of hippocampal-dependent spatial memory. Although adenosine A 1 receptors have a central role in fine-tuning excitatory transmission in the hippocampus, A 1 receptors localized in GABAergic cells do not directly influence GABA release. CB 1 and A 1 receptors are the main targets for the effects of two of the most heavily consumed psychoactive substances worldwide: Δ 9 -tetrahydrocannabinol (THC, a CB 1 receptor agonist) and caffeine (an adenosine receptor antagonist). We first tested the hypothesis that an A 1 –CB 1 interaction influences GABA and glutamate release in the hippocampus. We found that A 1 receptor activation attenuated the CB 1 -mediated inhibition of GABA and glutamate release and this interaction was manifested at the level of G-protein activation. Using in vivo and in vitro approaches, we then investigated the functional implications of the adenosine–cannabinoid interplay that may arise following chronic caffeine consumption. Chronic administration of caffeine in mice (intraperitoneally, 3 [*]mg/kg/day, for 15 days, > 12 [*]h before trials) led to an A 1 -mediated enhancement of the CB 1 -dependent acute disruptive effects of THC on a short-term spatial memory task, despite inducing a reduction in cortical and hippocampal <b>CB</b> 1 receptor <b>number</b> and an attenuation of CB 1 coupling with G protein. A 1 receptor levels were increased following chronic caffeine administration. This study shows that A 1 receptors exert a negative modulatory effect on CB 1 -mediated inhibition of GABA and glutamate release, and provides the first evidence of chronic caffeine-induced alterations on the cannabinoid system in the cortex and hippocampus, with functional implications in spatial memory...|$|R
40|$|The gilthead {{sea bream}} (Sparus aurata) {{is one of}} the main European {{aquaculture}} products and a prospective model species for the Sparidae, which includes several other commercially important species. Future selective breeding of aquaculture stocks will be heavily underpinned by molecular genetic techniques, especially by marker-assisted selection (MAS). Gene marker resources in marine fish species, however, lag behind those of other agricultural animals, and only scanty information exists about the genetic source of phenotypic variation and the identity of quantitative trait loci (QTL). In order to develop molecular resources in gilthead sea bream, complementary DNA libraries were constructed from liver and mixed embryo and larval stages by unidirectional cloning. A long-read expressed sequence tag (EST) database was generated, containing 1394 cDNA clones representing 852 unique cDNA sequence-reads. Tissue-specific patterns of gene expression were determined when grouped using the proposal for characterizing cellular component put forward by the Gene Ontology consortium. Transcripts encoding cytoskeletal proteins were most abundant in the embryonic/larval library, while the most abundant transcripts in the liver library encoded secreted and extracellular proteins. Of both libraries, 505 clones were sequenced in both orientations (5 Vand 3 Vend sequencing), where 226 clones were determined as full-length sequence reads. Cluster analysis of 3 Vend-sequenced clones from both libraries revealed that alternative polyadenylation signals were utilized, although no evidence of alternative splicing was found. We report for the first time for gilthead sea bream or any sparid a transcriptional analysis of two tissues and briefly consider the utility of ESTs for characterizing tissue-specific expression profiles.

40|$|PURPOSE: In this work, a novel {{stochastic}} {{framework for}} patient positioning based on linac-mounted CB projections is introduced. Based on this formulation, the most probable shifts and rotations {{of the patient}} are estimated, incorporating interfractional deformations of patient anatomy and other uncertainties associated with patient setup. METHODS: The target position {{is assumed to be}} defined by and is stochastically determined from positions of various features such as anatomical landmarks or markers in CB projections, i. e., radiographs acquired with a CB-CT system. The patient positioning problem of finding the target location from CB projections is posed as an inverse problem with prior knowledge and is solved using a Bayesian maximum a posteriori (MAP) approach. The prior knowledge is three-fold and includes the accuracy of an initial patient setup (such as in-room laser and skin marks), the plasticity of the body (relative shifts between target and features), and the feature detection error in CB projections (which may vary depending on specific detection algorithm and feature type). For this purpose, MAP estimators are derived and a procedure of using them in clinical practice is outlined. Furthermore, a rule of thumb is theoretically derived, relating basic parameters of the prior knowledge (initial setup accuracy, plasticity of the body, and number of features) and the parameters of <b>CB</b> data acquisition (<b>number</b> of projections and accuracy of feature detection) to the expected estimation accuracy. RESULTS: MAP estimation can be applied to arbitrary features and detection algorithms. However, to experimentally demonstrate its applicability and to perform the validation of the algorithm, a water-equivalent, deformable phantom with features represented by six 1 mm chrome balls were utilized. These features were detected in the cone beam projections (XVI, Elekta Synergy) by a local threshold method for demonstration purposes only. The accuracy of estimation (strongly varying for different plasticity parameters of the body) agreed with the rule of thumb formula. Moreover, based on this rule of thumb formula, about 20 projections for 6 detectable features seem to be sufficient for a target estimation accuracy of 0. 2 cm, even for relatively large feature detection errors with standard deviation of 0. 5 cm and spatial displacements of the features with standard deviation of 0. 5 cm. CONCLUSIONS: The authors have introduced a general MAP-based patient setup algorithm accounting for different sources of uncertainties, which are utilized as the prior knowledge in a transparent way. This new framework can be further utilized for different clinical sites, as well as theoretical developments in the field of patient positioning for radiotherapy...|$|R
