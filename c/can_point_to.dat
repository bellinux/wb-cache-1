25|$|However, the {{question}} of external relationships of Kalaw Lagaw Ya is also complicated by tantalising resemblances between the Paman (Australian) and the Trans-Fly (Papuan) languages. Though few, these may be significant, and include forms such as those noted below, not all of which appear in Kalaw Lagaw Ya. Such resemblances <b>can</b> <b>point</b> <b>to</b> a deep-level relationship dating back to before the flooding of Torres Strait {{at the end of}} the last age, as well as to later contacts.|$|E
25|$|Blood testing {{includes}} liver enzymes, serology (i.e. for autoantibodies), {{nucleic acid}} testing (i.e. for hepatitis virus DNA/RNA), blood chemistry, and complete blood count. Characteristic patterns of liver enzyme abnormalities <b>can</b> <b>point</b> <b>to</b> certain causes or stages of hepatitis. Generally, AST and ALT are elevated {{in most cases}} of hepatitis {{regardless of whether the}} patient shows any symptoms. However, the degree of elevation (i.e. levels in the hundreds vs. in the thousands), the predominance for AST vs. ALT elevation, and the ratio between AST and ALT are informative of the diagnosis.|$|E
25|$|Patients {{are often}} {{monitored}} without treatment. While {{many of those}} with minor status do not require transfusion therapy, they still risk iron overload, particularly in the liver. A serum ferritin test checks iron levels and <b>can</b> <b>point</b> <b>to</b> further treatment. Although not life-threatening on its own, it can affect quality of life due to the anemia. Minor often coexists with other conditions such as asthma and can cause iron overload of the liver and in those with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, lead to more severe outcomes.|$|E

25|$|Scientific {{interest}} in power-law relations stems partly from {{the ease with}} which certain general classes of mechanisms generate them. The demonstration of a power-law relation in some data <b>can</b> <b>point</b> <b>to</b> specific kinds of mechanisms that might underlie the natural phenomenon in question, and can indicate a deep connection with other, seemingly unrelated systems; see also universality above. The ubiquity of power-law relations in physics is partly due to dimensional constraints, while in complex systems, power laws are often thought to be signatures of hierarchy or of specific stochastic processes. A few notable examples of power laws are the Pareto's law of income distribution, structural self-similarity of fractals, and scaling laws in biological systems. Research on the origins of power-law relations, and efforts to observe and validate them in the real world, is an active topic of research in many fields of science, including physics, computer science, linguistics, geophysics, neuroscience, sociology, economics and more.|$|E
25|$|An investigatory stop is {{a seizure}} under the Fourth Amendment. The state must justify the seizure {{by showing that}} the officer {{conducting}} the stop had a reasonable articulable suspicion that criminal activity was afoot. The {{important point is that}} officers cannot deprive a citizen of liberty unless the officer <b>can</b> <b>point</b> <b>to</b> specific facts and circumstances and inferences therefrom that would amount to a reasonable suspicion. The officer must be prepared to establish that criminal activity was a logical explanation for what he perceived. The requirement serves to prevent officers from stopping individuals based merely on hunches or unfounded suspicions. The purpose of the stop and detention is to investigate to the extent necessary to confirm or dispel the original suspicion. If the initial confrontation with the person stopped dispels suspicion of criminal activity the officer must end the detention and allow the person to go about his or her business. If the investigation confirms the officer's initial suspicion or reveals evidence that would justify continued detention the officer may require the person detained to remain at the scene until further investigation is complete.|$|E

500|$|OFC may be {{diagnosed}} {{using a variety}} of techniques. [...] Muscles in patients afflicted with OFC can either appear unaffected or [...] "bulked up." [...] If muscular symptoms appear upon the onset of hyperparathyroidism, they are generally sluggish contraction and relaxation of the muscles. Deviation of the trachea (a condition in which the trachea shifts from its position at the midline of the neck), [...] in conjunction with other known symptoms of OFC <b>can</b> <b>point</b> <b>to</b> a diagnosis of parathyroid carcinoma.|$|E
500|$|A stroke is a {{decrease}} in blood supply to {{an area of the}} brain causing cell death and brain injury. This can lead {{to a wide range of}} symptoms, including the [...] "FAST" [...] symptoms of facial droop, arm weakness, and speech difficulties (including with speaking and finding words or forming sentences). Symptoms relate to the function of the affected area of the brain and <b>can</b> <b>point</b> <b>to</b> the likely site and cause of the stroke. Difficulties with movement, speech, or sight usually relate to the cerebrum, whereas imbalance, double vision, vertigo and symptoms affecting more than one side of the body usually relate to the brainstem or cerebellum.|$|E
500|$|The {{story of}} the episode was {{influenced}} by the film Casablanca, and was affected by the timing of the 1988 Writers Guild of America strike. Because of the strike, the script was written in five days and it was only when it was filmed that it was discovered to be incomplete. Shearer was not happy with the result and felt that the on-screen chemistry of Stewart and Phillips was lacking. Reviews of the episode have been mixed, with one reviewer summing it up by saying [...] "there’s nothing I <b>can</b> <b>point</b> <b>to</b> at this episode and say is wrong, but it’s one of the more forgettable episodes." ...|$|E

500|$|Zack Handlen, {{reviewing}} the episode for The A.V. Club in May 2010, {{said that he}} enjoyed the [...] "time blips" [...] in the episode, but that he wasn't {{a fan of the}} romance between Jenice and Picard. He also felt that there wasn't much follow up on Manheim's experiments and that he seemed to be left to cause a more serious accident in the future. Keith DeCandido watched the episode for Tor.com in July 2011. He thought that Michele Phillips was [...] "incredibly radiant", and said, [...] "there’s nothing I <b>can</b> <b>point</b> <b>to</b> at this episode and say is wrong, but it’s one of the more forgettable episodes", giving it a score of four out of ten.|$|E
500|$|In C#, {{memory address}} {{pointers}} {{can only be}} used within blocks specifically marked as unsafe, and programs with unsafe code need appropriate permissions to run. Most object access is done through safe object references, which always either point to a [...] "live" [...] object or have the well-defined null value; {{it is impossible to}} obtain a reference to a [...] "dead" [...] object (one that has been garbage collected), or to a random block of memory. An unsafe pointer <b>can</b> <b>point</b> <b>to</b> an instance of a value-type, array, string, or a block of memory allocated on a stack. Code that is not marked as unsafe can still store and manipulate pointers through the System.IntPtr type, but it cannot dereference them.|$|E
500|$|Reviews for Blue Dragon were {{somewhat}} mixed, though generally favorable. On the review aggregator GameRankings, the game {{had an average}} score of 77% based on 62 reviews. While many reviewers praised the game for its traditional approach, a few reviewers criticized it for that very reason, with one reviewer remarking, [...] "In fact, {{there is very little}} you <b>can</b> <b>point</b> <b>to</b> in Blue Dragon that hasn't been done multiple times over before". The story also came under scrutiny from some reviewers for being too generic and too similar to existing Japanese RPGs, with slow pacing during the beginning of the game. Eurogamer stated that the apparent lack of effort put into the facial animations for each character resulted in a limited ability to express emotion. They also noted that the mouth movements are well timed, but {{that the rest of the}} characters' facial movements are [...] "static".|$|E
