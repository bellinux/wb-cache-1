40|$|AbstractThis study {{aimed to}} develop {{appropriate}} changes {{in a pair of}} shoes in order to improve the gait of an individual selected for this case study. This analysis took into account ergonomic aspects, namely those relating to the individual's anthropometrics. Gait analysis was done with the adapted footwear both before and after intervention. A conventional X-ray was performed, which revealed a 29 -mm left lower limb shortening and possible foot adduction. The anthropometric assessment confirmed a 27 -mm asymmetry between the left knee and foot. Corrective changes were implemented in the left boot, with a 20 -mm increase in the plantar aspect and approximately 30 -mm in the calcaneus area. The pressure-mapping system WalkinSense was used for the kinetic gait analysis. Results showed some improvement in plantar pressure distribution after <b>corrective</b> changes in <b>footwear.</b> Peak pressure in the left foot decreased from 2. 8 kg/cm 2 to 1. 6 kg/cm 2. The second peak also showed a marked decrease. The right foot presented with a reduction in peak plantar pressure from 2. 7 kg/cm 2 to 2. 3 kg/cm 2. After identifying asymmetries, the associated pathologies and modifying the footwear, a kinetic analysis of gait before and after altering the footwear was undertaken, which showed improvements in the gait. According to the obtained results, it was possible to demonstrate that the initially proposed objectives were achieved, i. e., the changes in footwear resulted in an improvement of the analyzed individual...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: Early {{diagnosis}} {{is one of}} meaningful elements of prevention and treatment of postural defects. The objective {{of the study was}} an attempt to determine the correlations among the spine - pelvis traits and the feet traits in the population of boys aged 4 to 6 years living in rural areas and cities. Material and method: The study group covered 1506 boys aged 4 to 6 years. The measurement of 104 traits of the spine-pelvis and feet complex was conducted by means of the projection Moiré method for computer-based examination of body posture. Results: there is not much publications on the influence and correlations between the complex of the pelvis-spine traits and the feet traits. There is a correlation between the forming foot type and formation of the spine. The proposed Steinmetz suggestion assuming that if the spine can be corrected with the foot then the foot can be corrected by means of the spine, raises a number of doubts. The author emphasizes the meaning of wearing <b>corrective</b> <b>footwear</b> since proper foot positioning provided by special shoes cannot be the cause of spinal deformities. Conclusions: The spine-pelvis trait in the population of boys most frequently revealing significant influence on the feet traits is the height and depth of thoracic kyphosis. The foot trait among the population of boys living in cities most frequently revealing significant influence on the spine-pelvis traits was the value of the right foot length. In the rural population significant influence on the spine-pelvis traits was revealed by: the length and height of the fifth longitudinal arch of the left foot...|$|E
40|$|A fifteen {{year old}} girl {{presented}} with a two week history of tingling over the heel and lateral aspect of the {{sole of the foot}} corresponding to the distribution of the lateral plantar and calcaneal branches of the posterior tibial nerve. At the same time she had noticed a swelling below and behind the right medial malleolus. Examination revealed paraesthesia over the cutaneous distribution of the lateral plantar and calcaneal nerves, but the medial plantar nerve was uninvolved. A small round cystic swelling, approximately 2 cms in diameter, was palpable posteroinferior to the medial malleolus. It was fixed deeply but not to the skin. A diagnosis of tarsal tunnel syndrome due to ganglion was made. Treatment was by surgical decompression. An incision was made over the swelling and the flexor retinaculum divided. The tibial nerve was obviously stretched across a large ganglion arising from the synovial sheath around the tendon of flexor digitorum longus. The ganglion was excised and the nerve was seen to be free from tension. The flexor retinaculum {{was not included in the}} closure. There was some relief of symptoms immediately after operation, with full recovery of sensation within five weeks. COMMENT Tarsal tunnel syndrome has been sporadically reported throughout the literature and its aetiology is diverse. The most commonly reported aetiological factors in the literature are trauma, post-traumatic fibrosis, deformity of the foot, local venous distension, tenosynovitis, rheumatoid arthritis, and a variety of anomalies of the muscles and tendons which pass through the tarsal tunnel. However, about 25 per cent of cases are idiopathic. ' Tarsal tunnel syndrome secondary to space occupying lesions is quite rare, and a review of the literature has revealed only five previous cases where a ganglion in the tarsal tunnel has been the aetiological agent. '- 5 Conservative treatment may be attempted initially by elimination or correction of the cause e. g., elastic stockings for venous engorgement, <b>corrective</b> <b>footwear</b> for deformity of the feet and local steroid injections for tenosynovitis. However, conservative measures are generally unsuccessful and surgical intervention is usually undertaken with good results. All reported cases to date of tarsal tunnel due to a ganglion '- 5 including the one reported by the author have responded successfully to surgical decompression...|$|E
