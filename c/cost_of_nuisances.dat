40|$|When {{considering}} the environmental {{damage caused by}} road traffic, one traditionally focuses attention on the consequences of accidents, or {{on the impact of}} air and noise pollution. This somewhat narrow definition should be enlarged to capture other, more psychological nuisances. The barrier effect created by heavily travelled streets belongs to this group <b>of</b> <b>nuisances,</b> rarely described and never estimated in monetary terms. It particularly affects children, the disabled and elderly people for whom the street becomes too large to cross. In a survey carried out at Neuchâtel, Switzerland, a contingent market was proposed to suppress the barrier effect around the city centre. A valuation function to predict the bids is estimated and used to infer the annual <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> the <b>nuisance.</b> Copyright Kluwer Academic Publishers 1995 Contingent valuation, barrier effect, road traffic nuisance,...|$|R

40|$|In England and Wales {{planning}} regulations require {{local governments}} to treat waste near its source. This policy principle alongside regional self-sufficiency and the logistical advantages of minimising distances for waste treatment mean that energy from waste incinerators have been built close to, or even within urban conurbations. There is a clear policy and research need to balance the benefits of energy production from waste incinerators against the negative externalities experienced by local residents. However, the monetary <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> <b>nuisance</b> emissions from incinerators are not immediately apparent. This study uses the Hedonic Pricing Method to estimate the monetary value of impacts associated with three incinerators in England. Once operational, {{the impact of the}} incinerators on local house prices ranged from approximately 0. 4 % to 1. 3 % of the mean house price for the respective areas. Each of the incinerators studied had been sited on previously industrialised land to minimise overall impact. To an extent this was achieved and results support the effectiveness of spatial planning strategies to reduce the impact on residents. However, negative impacts occurred in areas further afield from the incinerator, suggesting that more can be done to minimise the impacts of incinerators. The results also suggest that in some case the incinerator increased the value of houses within a specified distance of incinerators under specific circumstances, which requires further investigation...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} the effect an {{inactive}} landfill site {{had on the}} sales price of surrounding houses is described. The spatial extent of {{the damage done by}} a nuisance site that was present at the time the houses were built is considered. Evidence is provided of the limited extent of the damage created by a nuisance land-use that did not generate negative publicity and conflict. Indirectly, the findings show that impacts that do not evoke rancor or present possible hazards are limited to a relatively small and easily definable zone. It should not, therefore, be difficult to implement compensation plans for the impacts <b>of</b> <b>nuisance</b> producing land-use sites. The implementation of such plans should help to ensure that land-use conflicts do not spread the <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> the <b>nuisance</b> beyond the area they affect directly. The damage zone In this paper I describe the effect a landfill site had on the price of houses built in its vicinity, and I search for the boundaries of the impact zone (see Skaburskis and Bullen, 1987). In this way I have found an answer to the question: does the damage caused by a land-use nuisance attenuate continually and gradually from the site generating the nuisance, or is the effect immediate and localized...|$|R
40|$|In {{the last}} decades the European steel {{industry}} has made continuous efforts to reduce residues and byproducts and to increase recycling {{in order to reduce}} its environmental impact. While some steelmaking slags have been widely characterised and, to a certain extent reused, ladle furnace (LF) slag is used in different applications because of its specific properties. The main purpose of the case study presented in this paper concerns the reduction of potential LF slag environmental impacts, because of its intrinsic physicochemical properties. During the handling and cooling of LF slag, it disintegrates into a powder due to instability of the dicalcium silicate, causing an increase in dust emissions to the environment. The approach presented in this paper aims to reduce this phenomenon in order to achieve a more sustainable solution in term of reduction of powder dispersion in the environment, <b>of</b> <b>costs</b> saving and <b>of</b> <b>nuisance</b> reduction in the surroundings areas...|$|R

40|$|In {{most of the}} cases, only a subvector of the {{parameters}} is tested in a model. The remaining parameters arise in the tests as nuisance parameters. The presence <b>of</b> <b>nuisance</b> parameters causes biases in key estimates used in the tests. So inferences made on the presence <b>of</b> <b>nuisance</b> parameters may lead to less accurate conclusions. Even the presence <b>of</b> <b>nuisance</b> parameters can destroy the test. Thus in eliminating the influence <b>of</b> <b>nuisance</b> parameters from the test can improve the tests' performance. The effect <b>of</b> the <b>nuisance</b> parameters can be eliminated by the marginal likelihood, conditional likelihood, canonical likelihood, profile likelihood and Bayesian tests. This paper is concerned with marginal likelihood-based test for eliminating the influence <b>of</b> <b>nuisance</b> parameters. In general, existing one-sided and two-sided tests for autocorrelation are tested only autocorrelation coefficients but not the regression coefficients in the model. So we proposed a distance-based marginal likelihood one-sided Likelihood Ratio (DMLR) test in eliminating the influence <b>of</b> <b>nuisance</b> parameters for testing higher order autocorrelation with one-sided alternatives in linear regression model using marginal likelihood and distance-based approach. Monte Carlo simulations are conducted to compare power properties of the proposed DMLR test with their respective conventional counterparts. It is found that the DMLR test shows substantially improved power for most of cases considered. <br /...|$|R

40|$|We {{review the}} Bayesian {{approach}} {{to the problem of}} the elimination <b>of</b> <b>nuisance</b> parameters from a statistical model. Many Bayesian statisticians feel that the framework of Bayesian statistics is so clear and simple that the elimination <b>of</b> <b>nuisance</b> parameters should not be considered a problem: one has simply to compute the marginal posterior distribution of the parameter of interest. However we will argue that this exercise need not be so simple from a practical perspective. The paper is divided in two main parts: the first deals with regular parametric models whereas the second will focus on non regular problem, including the so-called Neyman and Scott’s class of models and semiparametric models where the nuisance parameter lies in an infinite dimensional space. Finally we relate the issues of the elimination <b>of</b> <b>nuisance</b> parameters to other, apparently different, problems.

30|$|In {{cases where}} the council and animal {{management}} officers define the nature <b>of</b> <b>nuisance,</b> the complainant is typically burdened to demonstrate that a particular barking incident meets that definition <b>of</b> <b>nuisance.</b> However if the complainant’s definition <b>of</b> <b>nuisance</b> is accepted prima facie, then {{the burden of proof}} transfers to the respondent to demonstrate that the complaint is manifestly unreasonable. In other words, regardless of how barking dog ‘nuisance’ is defined and consequently where the burden of proof lies, the enforcement process of council remains able to proceed accordingly. An interesting corollary then emerges which posits that no requirement for a clear or consistent definition <b>of</b> barking dog <b>nuisance</b> is necessary for the successful enforcement <b>of</b> barking dog <b>nuisance</b> because <b>of</b> the consistency in application of an enforcement process, whatever that process happens to be. Positive interventions which flow from the successful application of this enforcement process then reduce the incidence or severity <b>of</b> the <b>nuisance,</b> resulting in a more harmonious neighbourhood and a successful enforcement outcome.|$|R

Additionally, the conducted research has examined the representations <b>of</b> regulated <b>nuisance</b> in the Flemish press and, specifically, how the press has represented it overtime, through the voices of whom, and whether criminologists have played any role in shaping such representations.
