40|$|The {{construction}} industry needs engineers. Mechanical, electrical, and plumbing engineers, {{better known as}} MEPs, comprise {{a large number of}} employees who design and assist in the building of commercial structures. In particular, electrical engineers design power distribution systems for these buildings, including the power, lighting, low voltage, and fire protection subsystems. Here at Cal Poly, architectural engineers enrolled in ARCE 257 create authentic structural plans for a fictitious two-story structure. This senior project transforms these structural plans into an architectural model and creates a power distribution system for the entire building. This is done through a building information modeling (BIM) software called Revit. In this project, the architectural model is used to create floor plans where the separate power and lighting subsystems are drafted. Electric panel schedules define the loads on each circuit used within the subsystems. Finally, a single line diagram will present the overall architecture of the power distribution system by exhibiting the interconnections between the larger pieces of electrical equipment. The final product compiles of all this information onto personalized electrical <b>construction</b> <b>sheets...</b>|$|R

40|$|We call peacock an {{integrable}} {{process which}} is increasing in the convex order; such a notion {{plays an important}} role in Mathematical Finance. A deep theorem due to Kellerer states that a process is a peacock if and only if it has the same one-dimensional marginals as a martingale. Such a martingale is then said to be associated to this peacock. In this monograph, we exhibit numerous examples of peacocks and associated martingales with the help of different methods: <b>construction</b> of <b>sheets,</b> time reversal, time inversion, self-decomposability, SDE, Skorokhod embeddings!

50|$|The flag has a width-to-length {{proportion}} of 1:2. In the unveiling ceremony for the flag, the sample <b>construction</b> <b>sheet</b> provides a width of 3 feet (36 inches) and {{a length of}} 6 feet (72 inches). The top (blue) and bottom (red) stripes have widths of 7 inches each, while the middle (white) stripe is given a width of 22 inches. The provincial seal is given a diameter of 20.5 inches.|$|E
5000|$|Green, {{gold and}} red are {{considered}} Pan-African colors. [...] Green {{is also used}} to symbolize Islam, and the gold for the sands of the Sahara desert. The red stripes, which where added to the flag in 2017, represent [...] "the efforts and sacrifices that the people of Mauritania will keep consenting, to the price of their blood, to defend their territory". The crescent and star are symbols of Islam, which is Mauritania's state religion. Some writers have also speculated that green symbolises a bright future, and growth. There is no official specification or <b>construction</b> <b>sheet</b> for the exact relative measurements of the star and crescent, although the flag's measurements are 2:3.|$|E
50|$|The MPA's 1999 {{circular}} {{includes a}} <b>construction</b> <b>sheet</b> with detailed dimensions for {{the manufacture of}} the flag. The sheet is in inches and centimetres. The overall dimensions of the flag are 36 in by 72 in. The space between {{the top of the}} ensign {{to the top of the}} ring, and the bottom of the ring to the bottom of the ensign, is 9.7 in. The outer diameter of the ring is 16.6 in, and the ring itself is 0.95 in in thickness. The outer curve of the crescent has a radius of 5.45 in. Each star fits within a circle with a diameter of 3.2 in, and the centres of the five stars are positioned 72° from each other along the circumference of an imaginary circle with a radius of 3.25 in.

50|$|The former boiler {{erecting}} shop (now the Fabrication Services Building), {{the former}} carriage repair shop (now the Machine Shop), the timber mill (demolished), the coppersmith's (demolished) {{and the former}} electricians' shop (now the Plan Maintenance Building) were completed by 1918. The buildings were generally of steel frame <b>construction</b> and <b>sheeted</b> in corrugated iron, with gabled roofs. Some had earth floors while others were floored in timber or concrete. With the construction of these buildings, the workshops were all but complete. In 1918, work {{was transferred to the}} new workshops. The old workshops were used for the storage of rail carriages.|$|R
50|$|This {{process has}} been {{replaced}} in modern architecture by lath and plaster, a common building material for wall and ceiling surfaces, in which a series of nailed wooden strips are covered with plaster smoothed into a flat surface.

50|$|An {{unintended}} {{problem with}} {{the design of the}} laminated <b>construction</b> of the <b>sheets</b> in a roll is that, on occasion whilst un-rolling, separation occurs between laminations rather than at the intended interface. Perforations then become misaligned and sheets cannot be torn off cleanly. The problem is resolved by careful un-winding of one or more laminations until the perforations re-align.|$|R
5000|$|Under the {{proposed}} legislative and constitutional refinements, it is envisaged that the Flags Act would {{remain on the}} statute books, to provide the <b>construction</b> <b>sheet</b> for the Australian National Flag which would be {{described in terms of}} its essential elements in the constitution, thereby settling the question of popular sovereignty in relation to the process for reviewing the design - {{in whole or in part}} - with a weighty body of legal opinion against the constitutionality of the current statutory rules in subsections 3(2) & (3), which provide for an instant-runoff [...] for choosing between the existing flag and one or more alternatives, on the basis of universal suffrage. As the device occupying the lower hoist is simply referred to as a [...] "large white Commonwealth Star", the number of points on what is a well recognised heraldic symbol in its own right could be varied by ordinary legislation, according to changes in membership of the Australian Federation, and not by a plebiscite as currently required, which would remove what has been criticised as an [...] "anomalous and costly" [...] impediment.|$|E
50|$|When an IH {{vehicle was}} ordered, a factory build or <b>construction</b> <b>sheet</b> was created (when {{the order was}} sent to the factory) with the new vehicle's VIN or ID number, and all the codes for {{standard}} equipment and options that the salesman used to create this vehicle for his customer or inventory. This sheet was used to assemble the vehicle from beginning to finish. After the factory assembled the vehicle and the vehicle was shipped and sold, the Line Setting Ticket identified such things as the engine type, transmission type, drive line, paint codes, gear ratio, and standard and optional equipment specific to that vehicle. This was and still is a very valuable tool when ordering parts later at the dealership by the customer. There were different parts used on the same model in the same year. A very small copy of the Line Ticket was attached to each vehicle during the building process at the factory. The location of the ticket varied: 1971-1976 Scout II's had their Line Ticket copies mounted under their hoods, attached to the cowl cover panels. 1977-1980 Scout II's had their copies {{on the inside of the}} glove box doors. 1969-1975 pickups and Travelalls had them attached to the back of the glove boxes; depressing the keeper tabs on each side of the box lets the box swing down to reveal the Line Setting Ticket. If lost, Lineset tickets can be ordered through several Scout parts specialists, thanks to their diligence in maintaining these valuable resources.|$|E
