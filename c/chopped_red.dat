60|$|Mrs Bowater {{brought in}} my luncheon, and--as I insisted--her own, too. The ice from Mr Tidy, the fishmonger's, {{had given a}} {{slightly}} marine flavour to the cream, and I had to keep my face averted {{as much as possible}} from the scorched <b>red</b> <b>chop</b> sprawling and oozing on her plate. How could she bring herself to eat it? We are such stuff as dreams are made on, said Hamlet. So then was Mrs Bowater. What a mystery then was this mutton fat!

40|$|Trials were {{performed}} with red beet and white cabbage in 1998 - 2001 {{to assess the}} effects on yields and nutrient utilization of surface mulch (<b>chopped</b> grass and/or <b>red</b> clover). No other nutrients were applied. Nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) contents were measured in mulch, saleable products and above-ground plant residues. A single mulch application of about 12 Mg DM ha- 1 increased the yields of both crops significantly. Mean yields of saleable products were increased from 27 to 33, and from 44 to 56 Mg FW ha- 1 of red beet and white cabbage, respectively. However, the average apparent recoveries of mulch derived nutrients in above-ground plant parts (calculated by subtraction of uptakes in the control treatment) were only 13 %, 14 % and 18 % of N, P and K, respectively. Some 3 - 10 % of the N supplied in mulch was found as mineral N at 0 - 60 cm soil depth after harvest, and in late autumn {{approximately half of the}} P and all the K supplied was found as P-AL or K-AL (ammonium lactate and acetic acid) plus acid-soluble K in the topsoil. Mulch application also increased the yield level of spring cereals grown in the following year by on average 0. 6 Mg ha- 1, or 20 %...|$|R
50|$|Colo-colo {{is a type}} of hot {{and spicy}} {{condiment}} commonly found in Maluku cuisine of Maluku archipelago, Indonesia. It is believed to be originated from Ambon city. Colo-colo is similar with Manado's dabu-dabu, as they both uses a lot of <b>chopped</b> <b>red</b> chili peppers, bird's eye chili, shallots, red and green tomatoes, and a pinch of salt and sugar, mixed with fresh calamansi juice or locally known as lemon cui or jeruk kesturi.

The main difference is colo-colo recipe often added further with additional ingredients, such as chopped lemon basil, kenari nut, and tahi minyak or ampas minyak (black-colored cooking coconut oil residue), or caramelized rarobang (watery residue of coconut oil-making process). As the result colo-colo is darker and more oily than dabu-dabu.|$|E
50|$|Wat {{begins with}} {{a large amount of}} <b>chopped</b> <b>red</b> onion, which is simmered or sauteed in a pot. Once the onions have softened, niter kebbeh (or, in the case of vegan dishes, {{vegetable}} oil) is added. Following this, berbere is added to make a spicy keiy wat or keyyih tsebhi. Turmeric is used instead of bebere for a milder alicha wat or both are omitted when making vegetable stews, atkilt wat. Meat such as beef (ሥጋ, səga), chicken (ዶሮ, doro) or derho), fish (ዓሣ, asa), goat or lamb (በግ, beg or beggi) is also added. Legumes such as split peas (ክክ, kək or kikki') or lentils (ምስር, məsər or birsin); or vegetables such as potatoes (ድንች, Dənəch), carrots and chard (ቆስጣ) are also used instead in vegan dishes.|$|E
50|$|The {{beans are}} well washed and soaked {{overnight}} before cooking. The well water must exit the beans. The next day, start {{to cook the}} Debrecen sausage with the pork knuckle in the bone juice or broth (water). Add the bay leaf. Remove the sausage from the broth after 10 minutes and set aside. When the beans begin to soften, add the diced vegetables and 2 cloves of garlic, which is a slightly cut. Simmer. If the knuckle is soft, remove from the soup. We prepare the Hungarian roux (fat, flour, finely <b>chopped</b> <b>red</b> onion, red pepper), with this fried preparation, we condense the soup. Add sour cream to the soup with a little sour cream were collected and then add to the soup. Slight flavour the soup with vinegar. In the bone cooked pork, cut into small cubes, cut into slices {{and add to the}} soup in the boiling water.|$|E

Animal Feed Science and Technology, 144, (1 - 2), pp. 125 - 136 Keywords: Polyphenol oxidase; Silage inoculant; Red clover silage; Proteolysis; Lipolysis On file IMPF: 01. 88 RONO: 1920 4063 Sponsorship: Department of Environment Food and Rural AffairsPolyphenol oxidase (PPO) {{has been shown to}} reduce proteolysis and lipolysis in red clover through deactivation of proteolytic and lipolytic enzymes and/or through formation of protein?phenol?lipid complexes. This experiment investigated the time course of both lipolysis and proteolysis in two red clover lines with different PPO activities with and without addition of a silage inoculant to help understand the action of PPO in the silo, and its potential effects on protein and glycerol-based lipid conservation, and to determine effects of a more rapid pH reduction with inoculation on PPO activity. Four silages were prepared from high or low PPO precision <b>chopped</b> <b>red</b> clover in 60 test-tube-silos, each containing 120 g fresh weight: (a) high PPO red clover without inoculation (H?), (b) low PPO red clover without inoculation (L?), (c) high PPO red clover with inoculation (H+), and (d) low PPO red clover with inoculation (L+). Each treatment had three replicates for each time point of 1, 2, 4, 8 and 90 days. The inoculant used was Lactobacillus plantarum strain L 54 applied at a rate of 106 CFU/g fresh weight. Silage pH was reduced (P < 0. 001) by inoculation with no effect of PPO. Inoculation had no effect on either lipolysis or free amino acid release, although more (P < 0. 01) soluble protein and less (P < 0. 01) ammonia-N was in inoculated silages. H silages had a lower level of both proteolysis (release of free amino acids, P < 0. 05) and lipolysis (loss of membrane lipid, P < 0. 01) than L red clover silages. Results indicate that PPO reduced proteolysis and lipolysis in the silo and that inoculation had no adverse effects on PPO activity. Peer reviewe...|$|E
