40|$|Graduation date: 2012 Red fir (Abies magnifica) {{is a high}} {{elevation}} conifer generally growing {{between an}} altitude of 1, 400 and 2, 700 meters. In California, <b>red</b> <b>fir</b> grows in the Sierra Nevada, the Klamath Mountains, the eastern edges of the northern Californian Coast Ranges, and in the southern Cascades. Red fir commonly grows in pure stands and is often found in association with white fir (Abies concolor), lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta) or Jeffrey pine (Pinus Jeffreyi). Red fir is present in popular recreational areas including Yosemite, Kings Canyon, Sequoia and Lassen Volcanic national parks {{as well as the}} Mt. Shasta area and the Lake Tahoe region. Increasing and higher-than-expected <b>red</b> <b>fir</b> mortality and decline {{over the past five years}} has been observed in the central Sierra Nevada. This mortality and decline is seen as being caused by a complex interaction of biotic, anthropogenic and abiotic factors. The abiotic factors include drought, climate change (especially decreased snowpack), and the effects of changing fire regimes. The key anthropogenic factors are air pollution and forest management. The biotic factors include <b>red</b> <b>fir</b> dwarf mistletoe (Arceuthobium abietinum f. sp. magnificae), Annosus root disease (Heterobasidion annosum), Cytospora canker (Cytospora abietis), and the fir engraver beetle (Scolytus ventralis). Using USFS Forest Inventory & Analysis (FIA) plots at a density of one every 5. 47 km (3. 4 miles) across California allowed for the first stand-level analysis of the entire <b>red</b> <b>fir</b> distribution zone in California. The results show that mortality is increasing in <b>red</b> <b>fir,</b> which suggests that at least a short term decline is occurring. The rate at which mortality is increasing varies, depending on which analysis approach is used and decreases if recently burned plots are removed from the analysis. At the individual tree level, <b>red</b> <b>fir</b> mortality (all size classes) is occurring at an annual rate of 2. 64 %. Red fir dwarf mistletoe is the most significant factor in <b>red</b> <b>fir</b> mortality and decline based on our field observations and statistical analysis. There is a clear visual and statistical difference in forest health between areas that possess <b>red</b> <b>fir</b> dwarf mistletoe and those that don't. This remains true even when stands are heavily stocked and Annosus root disease is present, suggesting that Annosus root disease (which is common throughout the <b>red</b> <b>fir</b> distribution range) is greatly exacerbated by the presence of <b>red</b> <b>fir</b> dwarf mistletoe. Cytospora canker is associated with <b>red</b> <b>fir</b> dwarf mistletoe, and is likely a significant reason why the <b>red</b> <b>fir</b> dwarf mistletoe impacts <b>red</b> <b>fir</b> forest health so significantly. The only variation in spatial pattern of <b>red</b> <b>fir</b> mortality in California is an area of very low <b>red</b> <b>fir</b> mortality around Mt. Shasta (where <b>red</b> <b>fir</b> dwarf mistletoes does not occur). There was not a consistent correlation between <b>red</b> <b>fir</b> mortality and drought stress. The amount of fir engraver activity in California is not well characterized making it difficult to assess its' role in <b>red</b> <b>fir</b> mortality...|$|R

50|$|Abies procera is {{very closely}} related to <b>red</b> <b>fir</b> (Abies magnifica), which replaces it farther {{southeast}} in southernmost Oregon and California, being best distinguished by the leaves having a groove along the midrib on the upper side; <b>red</b> <b>fir</b> does not show this. Red fir also tends to have the leaves less closely packed, with the shoot bark visible between the leaves, whereas the shoot is largely hidden in noble fir. Red fir cones also mostly have shorter bracts, except in Abies magnifica var. shastensis; this variety is considered by some botanists to be a hybrid between noble <b>fir</b> and <b>red</b> <b>fir.</b>|$|R

30|$|From 2001 through 2006, 255 {{permanent}} monitoring plots {{were established}} in coniferous forests. Plots were assigned subjectively to three forest types based on dominant tree species, similarities in fuel characteristics, and expected fire behavior. The forest types include short-needle dominated conifer stands, long-needle dominated conifer stands, and <b>red</b> <b>fir</b> (Abies magnifica) stands. The <b>red</b> <b>fir</b> group {{was not included in}} the short-needle conifer group because of differences in fuel characteristics, including smaller needles, less productive environments, and higher surface fuel compaction due to snow. The long-needle group is dominated by ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa), Jeffrey pine (Pinus jeffreyi), or Coulter pine (Pinus coulteri). Other tree species present include white fir (Abies concolor), black oak (Quercus kelloggii), incense-cedar (Calocedrus decurrens), Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii), and sugar pine (Pinus lambertiana). The short-needle group is dominated by Douglas-fir, white fir or a combination of both. Other tree species present include ponderosa pine, sugar pine, incense-cedar and black oak.

40|$|Abstract: A strong {{positive}} association {{exists between}} Bryoria fremontii (Tuck.) Brodo & D. Hawksw. and <b>red</b> <b>fir</b> (Abies magnifica A. Murray) in mixed-conifer forest of the south-central Sierra Nevada in California. The hypotheses that <b>red</b> <b>fir</b> microclimate, foliar leachate pH, mineral nutrients, and needle morphology {{may be especially}} favorable for B. fremontii were investigated in this study. There were {{no statistically significant differences}} in fall–winter–spring period within-crown vapor pressure deficits among five conifer species. In spring leachate solutions, NH 4 + and K+ were significant indicators of <b>red</b> <b>fir,</b> which had generally greater ion concentrations than other species. Sugar pine (Pinus lambertiana Douglas) leachate had the lowest pH. Mineral nutrient concentrations and acidity increased across species in fall samples. Growth and estab-lishment of B. fremontii transplants were compared among the five conifer species. Grand mean annual transplant relative growth across conifer species was 6. 28 % with no statistically significant differences among species. Thallus retention in an establishment experiment was significantly greater in <b>red</b> <b>fir</b> than in shaded white fir (Abies concolor (Gordon & Glend.) Hildebr. var. lowiana (Gordon) Lemmon) or the other three investigated conifers. The most important factor explaining the association of B. fremontii with <b>red</b> <b>fir</b> was the latter’s erect needle morphology.
