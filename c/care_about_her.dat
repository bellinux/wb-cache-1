500|$|Carabott felt Charlotte's death {{could have}} been {{explored}} further, but as {{there was so much}} happening in the episode not enough time was made for her death.

Cynthia Littleton from Variety said {{this was one of the}} few times Charlotte did not annoy her, as she acts as a translator for Jin, [...] "finally do something worthwhile". Noel Murray of The A.V.

TV Guides Mickey O'Connor praised Mader's acting, saying [...] "Well done, Rebecca Mader, who has really done some fine work on Lost".|$|E

[...] She adds that [...] "with each blow that life delivers [...] bobs back up again, almost asking for more trouble, more pain, more suffering." [...] Dot is renowned for being a hypochondriac, her Christian faith and quoting from the Bible. She has been described by Rupert Smith, author of 20 Years in Albert Square, as [...] "God-bothering" [...] and self-righteous. According to Kingsley, [...] "nothing shakes Dot's view that the world is good because the creator made it so. Her faith sustains her through the most appalling ordeals." [...] The character once expressed {{part of the reason for}} her faith on-screen in 2000, commenting to a vicar, [...] "I couldn't manage without my faith, not with the life I've had"; former executive producer of EastEnders, John Yorke, has stated that this is his favourite line of EastEnders' entire existence. Author Antony Slide has noted that Dot's religious beliefs have given her solace, but has given her an excuse to be prejudiced against her neighbours, and to deal with the criminal antics of her wayward son.

500|$|Pfeiffer's {{performance}} {{continued to}} draw rave reviews from film critics, who hailed {{it as one}} of the decade's most powerful and sexiest. Film critic Roger Ebert predicted that The Fabulous Baker Boys would become [...] "one of the movies they will use as a document... when they begin to trace the steps by which Pfeiffer became a great star", concluding, [...] "This is the movie of her flowering - not just as a beautiful woman, but as an actress with the ability to make you <b>care</b> <b>about</b> <b>her,</b> to make you feel what she feels." [...] Ebert also identified Pfeiffer as a successor to classic Hollywood actresses Rita Hayworth and Marilyn Monroe. Pfeiffer won the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Motion Picture – Drama, her first win and second nomination after having been nominated the previous year for her performance as in Married to the Mob (1988). Some critics questioned why she had not been nominated in the award's Comedy or Musical category instead considering her several musical performances given throughout The Fabulous Baker Boys. Pfeiffer was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actress, her second Academy Award nomination. According to film critic Emanuel Levy, Pfeiffer and fellow nominee Jessica Tandy were considered to be the category's top two contenders due to the lackluster performances delivered by other nominees that year; the competition between Pfeiffer and Tandy was dubbed [...] "Old Hollywood Vs. Young Hollywood" [...] by the media {{as a result of the}} age difference between Pfeiffer (31) and Tandy (80) at the time. Despite being largely favored to win, Pfeiffer ultimately lost the award to Tandy, who won for her performance in Driving Miss Daisy (1989), a result that upset both surprised critics and the general public. Critics believe Tandy won because Academy Award voters felt sentimental towards her age, aided by the fact that her film had been nominated for an Academy Award for Best Picture while The Fabulous Baker Boys was not. Katey Rich of Vanity Fair insists that the award rightfully belonged to Pfeiffer, ranking the spectacle among [...] "10 Times the Golden Globes Got It Right and the Oscars Didn't". Pfeiffer became one of only seven actresses to win Best Actress awards from all four major United States film critics associations – the New York Film Critics Circle, the Los Angeles Film Critics Association, The National Board of Review and the National Society of Film Critics – for a single performance, as well as the only one of these seven actresses who did not go on to win the Academy Award for Best Actress for that same performance. According to Stylist, Pfeiffer won nearly every recognized [...] "Best Actress" [...] film award except for the Academy and British Academy Film Awards.|$|E

Kirkwood's team put much work into further developing Grace and allowing Wall to bring warmth to her on-screen counterpart's persona. Writers used an existing character, Esther Bloom (Jazmine Franks) and made her Grace's best friend and [...] "very surprising sidekick".

Alfie has kept going with Kat for the sake of their love and their history. But if he can't forgive her for this latest indiscretion, there's no way they can keep their family together." [...] He said that he and Wallace had [...] "a vested interest" [...] to get the scenes right, [...] "because our bosses gave us such a great opportunity. We spent a lot of time working on it—and I hope we've ticked every box." [...] Richie called the bedsit scene [...] "fantastic" [...] and told the BBC, [...] "It's very rare you get a 15-minute scene with two people in one room". He {{explained}} that he and Wallace spent a lot of time with the episode's director, Karl Neilson, [...] "just going over stuff, finding out where the emotions were, who was the victim, who was on the offensive, who was on the defensive", where usually there are no rehearsals. Richie also revealed that the bedsit set was a [...] "tiny space" [...] that was purposely built for the episodes, which Richie said was [...] "quite claustrophobic". He called it a [...] "square room [...] nowhere to hide", with [...] "every blink of the eye, every look, every frown, every sigh" [...] being seen, adding [...] "if you're looking angry, it's there to be seen, you're naked to it". He said he [...] "loved" [...] that about filming the episode, and said, [...] "you work hard to try and be as good an actor as you can and then you're given an opportunity by the BBC and by EastEnders to step up to the mark.

2500|$|On {{announcement}} of the storyline, Soaplife said it [...] "could be fun but could be the ruin of Kat if they get it wrong", and wondered if it would put EastEnders [...] "back on top of its game", saying, [...] "That depends on Kat. If we're made to love and <b>care</b> <b>about</b> <b>her,</b> yes. If she comes over as a conniving, sneaky cheat only interested in her own wants and desires, no." [...] They opined that Alfie {{should be the one}} having the affair, as he cannot do anything right in Kat's eyes. They also said they [...] "wondered which Kat we'd be getting back after Jessie Wallace's break. Would it be the tart with a heart that made Kat a soap icon? Or the alley Kat that we got last year (Kat down the alley with delivery man Mark was not her finest moment). Now with the reveal that she'll have a mystery that we can all spend weeks or months trying to guess , we fear it will be more alley Kat." [...] All About Soap thought that because of the way Kat got rid of Roxy after she moved in with Alfie while Kat was away, [...] "you'd think that [...] Kat was really committed to her husband [...] and determined to make her marriage work" [...] but called the affair [...] "sizzling", saying it would [...] "send shockwaves all round Albert Square!" [...] Soaplife said that the storyline {{may turn out to be}} a good mystery, but [...] "when it comes to affairs, we prefer ours with a heap-big dose of love". However, they later said the storyline was [...] "getting boring". In All About Soap, letters page editor Laura thought the affair would be [...] "the hottest thing in the Square this summer!" [...] Soaplife awarded the storyline a bronze medal in their [...] "2012 Soap Olympics" [...] for [...] "best storyline cycling", as Kat is [...] "cheating again. Round and round she goes." [...] Kate White from Inside Soap said: [...] "Well, Kathleen Slater Moon, if you were hoping to win our sympathy by suggesting that this secret fling business is all Alfie's fault, think again! Yes, it's a bit annoying when your other half is too busy to pay you much attention—but there should at least be an effort to sort out your issues before you decide cheating is the answer! We're finding it hard to have sympathy". The magazine later called the storyline [...] "unusual" [...] but said that [...] "Kat has been busy showing us how infidelity should be done". When the affair turned from lust to love, Soaplife said that it was [...] "what the affair needed right from the start in order to save Kat's reputation." [...] Steven Murphy, editor of Inside Soap said that when the storyline started, he and his colleagues were [...] "a little intrigued" [...] but after Michael was eliminated, they were [...] "totally obsessed!" [...] An Inside Soap reporter said that [...] " [...] decision to keep the man's identity a secret—and to have several characters reacting as if it could be them—means that this is soap like we've never seen it before", and added that [...] "it makes for frustrating viewing at times, but there's no denying that this plot has us well and truly hooked.
