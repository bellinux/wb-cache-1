25|$|Electronic {{ignition}} (EI) solves these problems. In {{the initial}} systems, points were still used but they handled only a low current {{which was used}} to control the high primary current through a solid state switching system. Soon, however, even these <b>contact</b> <b>breaker</b> <b>points</b> were replaced by an angular sensor of some kind - either optical, where a vaned rotor breaks a light beam, or more commonly using a Hall effect sensor, which responds to a rotating magnet mounted on the distributor shaft. The sensor output is shaped and processed by suitable circuitry, then used to trigger a switching device such as a thyristor, which switches a large current through the coil.|$|E

Zener diodes are used for voltage regulation. Early engines used <b>contact</b> <b>breaker</b> <b>point</b> ignition with electronic ignition becoming standard fitment on all Triumph's 750cc twins from 1979-on.|$|R

5000|$|The H100-S was {{introduced}} alongside the H100-A which continued in production until stocks were exhausted. The H100-S is a heavily {{revised version of}} the original, losing some of its more practical features as a result. This was felt necessary {{to give it a}} wider appeal. The oil tank was moved from being part of the fuel tank to behind the right hand side panel, the final drive chain casing was relieved for a sleeker, chrome plated top cover, the clocks were made separate from the headlight to allow for a new tachometer, and, strangely, the CDI ignition system was replaced by a <b>contact</b> <b>breaker</b> system (<b>points)</b> ...|$|R
500|$|Honda {{recommended}} daily checks of the lights, horn, tire pressure, brakes, fuel and oil level, and a weekly {{check of the}} battery electrolyte level.

At , major maintenance was due, requiring the removal and cleaning of the carburetor, drive chain, exhaust silencer, and wheel bearings. The rider closed a manual choke to aid in starting at cold temperatures. By {{the standards of the}} day, this was a simple motorcycle, with minimal maintenance demands, and it earned a reputation for high reliability.|$|E
2500|$|The KR200 ran on a [...] Fichtel & Sachs forced-air (fan) cooled single {{cylinder}} two-stroke engine positioned {{in front of}} the rear wheel, just behind the passenger's seat. The engine had two sets of <b>contact</b> <b>breaker</b> <b>points</b> and, to reverse, the engine was stopped and then restarted, going backwards. This was effected by pushing the key further in the ignition switch than normal, whether intentionally or not. One result of this was that the KR200's sequential, positive-stop transmission provided the car with the same four gear ratios available in reverse as in forward movement.|$|E

25|$|The {{ignition}} firing sequence {{begins with}} the <b>points</b> (or <b>contact</b> <b>breaker)</b> closed. A steady current flows from the battery, through the current-limiting resistor, through the primary coil, through the closed <b>breaker</b> <b>points</b> and finally back to the battery. This current produces a magnetic field within the coil's core. This magnetic field forms the energy reservoir {{that will be used}} to drive the ignition spark.|$|R
25|$|The {{disadvantage}} {{of the mechanical}} system {{is the use of}} <b>breaker</b> <b>points</b> to interrupt the low-voltage high-current through the primary winding of the coil; the points are subject to mechanical wear where they ride the cam to open and shut, as well as oxidation and burning at the contact surfaces from the constant sparking. They require regular adjustment to compensate for wear, and the opening of the <b>contact</b> <b>breakers,</b> which is responsible for spark timing, is subject to mechanical variations.|$|R
50|$|Fuel {{injection}} {{and computer}} engine management systems are now normal on middle range and larger motorcycles and {{are increasingly being}} incorporated onto the smaller machines, partly driven by better emission control and lower maintenance but mostly by manufacturing cost considerations. Ignition systems moved from magneto in the 1950s to battery-coil-contact <b>breaker</b> (<b>points),</b> and these were increasingly superseded by Capacitor Discharge Ignition (CDI) from the 1980s. Small, single-cylinder motorcycles abandoned the flywheel magneto system with <b>contact</b> <b>breakers</b> to similar flywheel driven solid-state systems {{at about the same}} time.|$|R

50|$|The Triumph worker's {{co-operative}} at the Meriden factory re-introduced the Thunderbird {{model name}} to their range in April 1981. The Triumph TR65 Thunderbird 650 cc parallel-twin was a short-stroke {{version of the}} 750 cc T140 Bonneville engine and was the cheapest model in Triumph's range with budget features such as a drum rather than disc rear brake, {{the absence of a}} tachometer, a siamesed exhaust system, painted rather than polished alloy and economy Dunlop Gold Seal tyres. Moreover, whereas Triumph's 750cc range had electronic ignition, the TR65 was fitted with <b>contact</b> <b>breaker</b> <b>points.</b> Respecting its lineage, the model retained the Turner-designed 'paper dart' logo on its side panels but with a different, updated 'Thunderbird' script. The TR65 was priced upon introduction at £1829.82.The economy finish was upgraded for 1982 'export' models although the <b>contact</b> <b>breaker</b> <b>points</b> and drum rear brake remained.|$|E

50|$|The term Renix {{also has}} a number of applications. In certain {{carburetor}} equipped Renault and Volvo models, it provides an electronic ignition system, consisting of an engine control unit (ECU) to replace the job of <b>contact</b> <b>breaker</b> <b>points</b> in the distributor. The system uses an angle sensor and a number of fuel sensors to provide a maintenance-free ignition system. The ECU is sealed and cannot be serviced, and the EPROM cannot be re-programmed.|$|E
50|$|Since {{they open}} and close several times with every turn of the engine, <b>contact</b> <b>breaker</b> <b>points</b> and cam {{follower}} suffer from wear—both mechanical and pitting caused by arcing across the contacts. This latter effect is largely prevented by placing a capacitor parallel across the contact breaker—this is usually referred to by the more old fashioned term condenser by mechanics. As well as suppressing arcing, it helps boost the coil output by creating a resonant LC circuit with the coil windings.|$|E
25|$|The flat twin {{cylinder}} 1948 Citroën 2CV used one double ended coil without a distributor, and just <b>contact</b> <b>breakers,</b> in a wasted spark system.|$|R
50|$|The <b>contact</b> <b>breaker</b> is {{operated}} by an engine-driven cam, {{and the position}} of the <b>contact</b> <b>breaker</b> is set so that it opens (and hence generates a spark) at exactly the correct moment needed to ignite the fuel {{at the top of the}} piston's compression stroke. The <b>contact</b> <b>breaker</b> is usually mounted on a plate that is able to rotate relative to the camshaft operating it. The plate is rotated by a centrifugal mechanism, thus advancing the ignition timing (making the spark occur earlier) at higher revolutions. This gives the fuel time to burn so that the resulting gases reach their maximum pressure at the same time as the piston reaches the top of the cylinder. The plate's position can also be moved a small distance using a small manifold vacuum-operated servomechanism, providing advanced timing when the engine is required to speed up on demand. This helps to prevent pre-ignition (or pinging).|$|R

50|$|A {{drawback}} {{of using}} a mechanical switch {{as part of the}} ignition timing {{is that it is not}} very precise, needs regular adjustment of the dwell (contact) angle, and at higher revolutions, its mass becomes significant, leading to poor operation at higher engine speeds. These effects can largely be overcome using electronic ignition systems, where the contact breakers are retrofitted by a magnetic (Hall effect) or optical sensor device. However, because of their simplicity, and since <b>contact</b> <b>breaker</b> <b>points</b> gradually degrade instead of catastrophically failing, they are still used on aircraft engines.|$|E

50|$|According to Triumphs 1982/3 range {{brochure}} {{the cycle}} {{parts of that}} seasons USA styled Thunderbird dispensed with the satin black finish, instead adopting bright chrome, polished alloy, a tachometer, twin bright-chromed exhausts and Marzocchi rear suspension units which came with black springs as standard. The UK version added the twin exhausts, Marzocchis suspension and a tachometer but retained the satin black cycle parts of the 1981/2 models. Whilst both versions retained their <b>contact</b> <b>breaker</b> <b>points</b> ignition, they were now, like the 750 cc models, shod with Avon Roadrunner tyres. There were price differentials for 1982 USA and UK/RoW styles.|$|E
5000|$|A <b>contact</b> <b>breaker</b> (or [...] "points") {{is a type}} of {{electrical}} switch, and the term typically refers to the switching device found in the distributor of the ignition systems of spark-ignition internal combustion engines.|$|R
2500|$|The {{simplest}} form of {{spark ignition}} is that using a magneto. The engine spins a magnet inside a coil, or, {{in the earlier}} designs, a coil inside a fixed magnet, and also operates a <b>contact</b> <b>breaker,</b> interrupting the current and causing the voltage to be increased sufficiently to jump a small gap. The spark plugs are connected directly from the magneto output. Early magnetos had one coil, with the <b>contact</b> <b>breaker</b> (sparking plug) inside the combustion chamber. In about 1902, Bosch introduced a double-coil magneto, with a fixed sparking plug, and the <b>contact</b> <b>breaker</b> outside the cylinder. Magnetos are not used in modern cars, but because they generate their own electricity they are often found on small engines such as those found in mopeds, lawnmowers, snowblowers, chainsaws, etc. where a battery-based electrical system is not present for any combination of necessity, weight, cost, and reliability reasons. [...] They are also used on piston-engined aircraft engines. [...] Although an electrical supply is available, magneto systems are used mainly because of their higher reliability.|$|R

50|$|Very few {{of these}} bikes {{seem to have been}} made and even fewer survived. The cast wheels were in an {{unpainted}} finish and the decals were in a distinctive stripe design on the tank and side panels. This bike had a 3-1 exhaust system, and Mikuni “Mark I” carburetors. The air box assembly was different from later years. The air filter could be changed by opening the seat. This model had triple <b>contact</b> <b>breaker</b> <b>points</b> making timing adjustment complex. Also featured was a separate regulator and rectifier. The seat has a short tail piece this year.|$|E

50|$|British magazine, The Classic Motorcycle sampled another running example, engine/frame number 00101, (originally {{owned by}} Triumph dealers CG Chell, then-owned by sidecar racer Chris Vincent and now at Triumph spares dealers TMS-see photograph) {{and found it}} 'an eminently rideable motor cycle', 'imparting {{a great deal of}} {{pleasure}} as a bonus'. Tellingly, the author found that whilst Triumph 'was well able to design and build a model to match contemporary Japanese designs in engine performance, and to out-handle them on the road', the <b>contact</b> <b>breaker</b> <b>points</b> assembly required replacing during the ride. Testing the same machine some 3 years earlier, British magazine, The Biker commented similarly as to the performance but instead concluded that the Bandit would merely have been an 'also-ran' against the-then Japanese competition.|$|E
50|$|A simpler device, the {{low tension}} coil, {{was already in}} use for {{stationary}} engines and spark-ignition gas engines. This was a simple iron-core inductor, used with a battery and a switch called a <b>contact</b> <b>breaker.</b> It had a single winding and so was not a transformer like the trembler coil. When the piston was at the right <b>point,</b> the <b>contact</b> <b>breaker</b> opened, breaking the battery current. Self-induction due to the collapsing magnetic field generated a high voltage pulse in the coil, which {{was applied to the}} spark plug. The drawback of the low tension coil was that the high ignition voltage was generated in the same circuit as the low voltage battery current flowed in.|$|R
