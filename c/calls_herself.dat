A key plot element revolves around the memorial tablet to Ayres in Postman's Park, in which it is revealed that the character Jane Jones (played by Portman in the film), who <b>calls</b> <b>herself</b> Alice Ayres for most of the story, has in fact fabricated her identity based on the tablet on the Memorial to Heroic Self Sacrifice, which she reads {{at the time of her}} first meeting with Dan Woolf (played by Jude Law in the film) at the beginning of the action. The park, and the memorial to Ayres, feature prominently in the opening and closing scenes of the film.|$|E
5|$|Although {{she writes}} under the pen name J. K. Rowling (pronounced rolling), her name, before her remarriage, was simply Joanne Rowling. Anticipating that the target {{audience}} of young boys {{might not want to}} read a book written by a woman, her publishers asked that she use two initials rather than her full name. As she had no middle name, she chose K (for Kathleen) as the second initial of her pen name, from her paternal grandmother. She <b>calls</b> <b>herself</b> Jo. Following her remarriage, she has sometimes used the name Joanne Murray when conducting personal business. During the Leveson Inquiry she gave evidence under the name of Joanne Kathleen Rowling and her entry in Who's Who lists her name also as Joanne Kathleen Rowling.|$|E
5|$|The three {{beings are}} {{discovered}} to be reptilian humanoids, {{and in a}} scuffle, they capture Elliot and strike Tony with a venomous forked tongue; the Doctor and Rory subdue one while the other two retreat with Elliot back into the earth. The Doctor realises the beings are {{a new form of}} Silurians, and that they have relented in their attack since both sides hold a hostage. The captured Silurian <b>calls</b> <b>herself</b> Alaya; {{she is a member of}} the warrior caste, awoken by the drill. Alaya believes, as do all Silurians, that the Earth still belongs to them, that the drilling was a form of attack by the humans, and that they will defeat humanity eventually. Tony, suffering from the effects of the venom, says they should dissect Alaya, but the Doctor warns that it would be seen as an act of war. The Doctor decides to travel in the TARDIS down the drilling shaft to talk to the rest of the Silurians and work out a truce; Nasreen accompanies him.|$|E
