40|$|The National {{football}} League (NFL) in the United States {{has become}} a quarterback-centric league, where an elite quarterback is needed to win a Super <b>Bowl.</b> This <b>paper</b> will aim to provide statistical insight into how to project which college quarterback prospects will have the most successful NFL careers. We specifically focus on two quarterbacks, Jameis Winston and Marcus Mariotta, who, respectively, were {{the first and second}} choice {{in the first round of}} the NFL draft recently, in May, 2015. However, our methodology is applicable to other quarterback draftees, and with modest adaptation, to evaluating players at other positions...|$|R
40|$|Golden Ten is an {{observation}} game which is {{played with a}} small ball rolling down in a large <b>bowl.</b> This <b>paper</b> describes {{the motion of the}} ball in the bowl by means of deterministic mechanical model, which leads to a set of ordinary second-order differential equations. A first impression of the solution is obtained through a numerical approximation, based on some preliminary estimates. Part of the solution is computed exactly, yielding a simple estimation procedure for the coefficient of air friction, {{which is one of the}} two main parameters controlling the system (the other parameter is the angle of inclination). An asymptotic solution method eventually leads to an approximate explicit solution, describing the motion of the ball as an elliptical spiral. One of the conclusions is a simple prediction strategy...|$|R

The <b>paper</b> has also pushed for more environmental awareness with its [...] "Minding the Murray" [...] campaign and more recently played a pivotal role in Echuca Regional Health securing funding for a new Echuca Hospital.|$|R

The chef first cooks the fresh noodles mixed with sesame oil in boiling water. When the noodles have cooked and cooled, it becomes pliable. Before eating, the noodles will be cooked in the same process again. Finally, dressings including spring onion and sauce will be added. When preparing reganmian, the noodles are placed into a Chinese strainer (a cone-shaped strainer) and dipped briefly into boiling water and then swirled and drained. The noodles are poured into a <b>paper</b> <b>bowl</b> and the sauce and pickled vegetables are poured on top. Chili oil is used in the seasoning of reganmian as well as a little fresh corriander.|$|R
40|$|There is a {{substantial}} body of literature to suggest that older people suffer more than most from poor public transport and a badly maintained transport infrastructure (Metz 2000, Banister and <b>Bowling,</b> 2004). This <b>paper</b> reports on a study which brings together health promotion professionals, transport planners and older people to understand these issues. A series of focus groups were used to establish the key travel behaviours and issues encountered by a sample of older travelers. The extent to which current transport planning processes identify and reduce these barriers was established {{through a series of}} accompanied walks with older people followed by discussions with the local authority engineers and by the application of a GIS tool for assessing accessibility by public transport to key facilities. The paper concludes by identifying the extent to which planning processes for older people can be improved...|$|R
40|$|In {{automated}} assembly lines, part feeders often {{impose a}} bottleneck that restricts throughput. To facilitate {{the design of}} parts and assembly lines, we'd like to estimate feedrates based on CAD models of parts. A previous paper [7] described how to predict throughput for a visionbased robotic part feeder given the distribution of part poses when parts are randomly dropped on a conveyor belt. Estimating this distribution is also useful {{for the design of}} traditional feeders such as vibratory <b>bowls.</b> In this <b>paper,</b> we describe three algorithms for estimating pose distributions. We review the quasi-static estimate reported in [20] and introduce a refinement that takes into account some measure of dynamic stability. The "quasi-dynamic" estimate can be computed very rapidly and is more accurate than the quasi-static. Still more accurate is the estimate based on Monte Carlo simulation using Impulse [11, 12], although the latter comes at the penalty of increased computation time. We compare est [...] ...|$|R
40|$|The {{formation}} {{of free trade}} agreements (FTAs) has been set in motion worldwide and its conclusion does not appear imminent in the near future. In {{the face of such}} developments, the Philippines is hard pressed to formulate a more rational FTA policy framework to deal with not just external, but perhaps more importantly, domestic repercussions. Like any other country, it would have to examine closely the motivations and impact, assess capacity needs, and balance short-term adjustments with long-term opportunities. It would need to look further ahead and formulate a vision about its regional and global participation. This short paper is an attempt to contribute toward this end. It starts with a brief discussion on current developments in Philippine FTA engagement. A suggested framework for FTA policy follows, with some discussion on the noodle <b>bowl</b> syndrome. The <b>paper</b> concludes with a discussion on the prospects for an East Asian FTA. regional trade agreement, preferential trading arrangements (PTAs), East Asian integration, free trade agreements (FTAs) ...|$|R
5000|$|The Tuscola-Pisgah rivalry, also {{referred}} to as the Pisgah-Tuscola Rivalry, the Haywood County Championship Game, the Iron Bowl, the Battle for Haywood, the <b>Paper</b> <b>Bowl,</b> and the County Clash {{is one of the best}} known and fiercest high school football rivalries in the southeastern United States. It has also been named the best high school rivalry in the state of North Carolina by USA TODAY. [...] It typically draws between 10,000 and 15,000 fans per year. [...] The intensity of the rivalry is caused by the fact that these are the only two high school football teams in Haywood County, North Carolina and are located less than 9 miles apart. Tuscola High School is located on a hill in Waynesville, NC that houses students from the western part of the county, primarily Waynesville, Maggie Valley, Crabtree, Fines Creek, Jonathan Creek, and western portions of Clyde. [...] Pisgah High School is located on the banks of the Pigeon River in Canton, NC and houses students from the eastern part of the county, primarily Canton, Beaverdam, Bethel, Cruso, and eastern Clyde.|$|R
5000|$|The paper also {{regularly}} publishes special extras, usually tabloid-style inserts {{of approximately}} eight to 12 pages. Focus Extras (called [...] "Out of Focus") are often published {{in accordance with}} the seasons (Fall, Winter, Spring), but the most common extras are put out by the Sports Department. An annual Homecoming Football Extra is published prior to the team's homecoming game, while Basketball Extras are published for major rivalry games. Husky Hoopla, an annual basketball issue, is published around Midnight Madness every year and highlights the upcoming season for both men's and women's basketball. The paper has also published special jackets (covering the entire paper) following basketball national championships, including full-color jackets on the consecutive days of April 6 and April 7, 2004 following UConn's unprecedented sweep of the men's and women's titles. Recently, the paper has published numerous jackets previewing or commemorating major events. Notable among these was a commemorative jacket published on the first anniversary of Jasper Howard's death and a jacket previewing the UConn football team's critical season finale against South Florida, a game that UConn would win on a late field goal to clinch the school's second Big East championship and first ever BCS <b>Bowl</b> berth. The <b>paper</b> has also published jackets previewing the outdoor hockey game played at Rentschler Field and several throughout the men's basketball team's run to the Big East and National Championship in 2011.|$|R
40|$|Increasing {{the numbers}} of {{individuals}} in higher education has been a central concern of Government in the United Kingdom over the last decade. Furthermore, access for those adults who traditionally would not attend university {{has been part of}} this agenda (The Scottish Office, 1998). Non-traditional students can be regarded as such {{as a result of a}} variety of factors such as age, income, class and ethnicity; those who could be considered as coming from disadvantaged backgrounds (<b>Bowl,</b> 2003). This <b>paper</b> reports on an ongoing research interest which aims to explore the experiences of students from a diverse range of backgrounds in higher education. Current literature in this field will be explored, and data gathered from a previous study of students on The BA in Community Education will be used as a case study to explore issues of inclusion and widening access. This study focused on the students’ experiences, perceptions and feelings and this influenced the research design. Therefore in-depth interviews were used to gather qualitative data. In the interviews the students described the personal journeys which led to their decision to attend higher education, the barriers they faced and the strategies that have helped them progress successfully through year one of the BA. The paper concludes that if the Scottish Government is to realise its vision of a lifelong learning society which seeks to close the gap between those ‘who achieve their full potential and those who do not’ (2003, p. 4) support strategies and opportunities for flexible approaches such as part-time study should continue to be supported and extended.

5000|$|West Alabama's {{football}} team was first fielded in 1931 {{when the school}} was known as Livingston State Teachers College. However, intercollegiate competition for all the university’s athletics was not scheduled until seven years later. In 1938, they competed in four games against Marion Institute, Jacksonville State, Demopolis A.S, and Troy State, {{all of whom were}} local teams. LSTC finished the season 2-2. That year also marked the start of World War II which led to a decline in college enrollment across the United States. Therefore, LSTC fielded no athletic teams from 1942-1945. In 1944, Dr. William Wilson Hill became president of the university and instantly started recruiting students to enroll. The return of males to campus reestablished an interest in sports. After a three-year hiatus, the {{football team}} returned to action under the guidance of new head coach E.G McCollum. They opened their season with the first of many future match-ups against Mississippi College, which resulted in a 24-14 loss. Also, that season, LSTC renewed its rivalry with, eventual Gulf South Conference foes, Troy State and Delta State. The team concluded the season with a 6-3 record. Due to success of the season, McCollum resigned to pursue a bigger opportunity elsewhere. Following two dismal seasons from 1947 and 1948, LSTC made a bold move and hired former University of Alabama star Vaughn Mancha as the fourth head coach in team history. Mancha at the time was only 28 years old with no prior coaching experience. The former two-time All-American had also recently completed his first and only season in the NFL {{as a member of the}} Boston Yanks. Under Mancha, the team experienced immediate success. In his first season, he led LSTC to one of the biggest accomplishments in school history, a 13-6 win over Florida State. The team also concluded the regular season 7-1-1, which at the time marked the best record in school history. The historical season earned LSTC right to play in the <b>Paper</b> <b>Bowl</b> against Jacksonville State. JSU won the hard fought defensive affair, 12-7. Until 1952, the Tigers played home games at Livingston High School. From then on, all their home games were played at Tiger Stadium, a 7,000-capacity stadium located on filled in land that was previously known as [...] "Crawdad Creek." [...] The stadium was built to fill the need for an on-campus stadium. Next season was once again successful as the team finished 6-3-1. However, they could not duplicate the accomplishments of the previous season. During Mancha’s third season, the team started off 2-4 and showed heavy signs of decline until putting on a strong finish to end the season 5-5. This season would mark the last in Mancha’s tenure at LSTC as he decided to take over as defensive coordinator at Florida State. Mancha departed with an 18-10-2 overall record.|$|R
