We present a bit-level algorithm that supports the partial evaluation of synchronous digital circuits. Full PE of combinational logic is noted to be equivalent to Boolean minimisation. A loop unrolling technique, supporting both partial and full unrolling, is described. Experimental results are given, showing that partial evaluation of a simple microprocessor against a ROM image is equivalent to compiling the ROM program directly into low level hardware. 1...|$|R

5000|$|A {{discrete}} {{structure is}} often used as the [...] "default structure" [...] on a set that doesn't carry any other natural topology, uniformity, or metric; discrete structures can often be used as [...] "extreme" [...] examples to test particular suppositions. For example, any group {{can be considered as}} a topological group by giving it the discrete topology, implying that theorems about topological groups apply to all groups. Indeed, analysts may refer to the ordinary, non-topological groups studied by algebraists as [...] "discrete groups" [...] In some cases, this <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>usefully</b> <b>applied,</b> for example in combination with Pontryagin duality. A 0-dimensional manifold (or differentiable or analytical manifold) is nothing but a discrete topological space. We can therefore view any discrete group as a 0-dimensional Lie group.|$|E

50|$|This report {{proposes a}} {{framework}} for ethical guidelines for computer and information security research, based on the principles {{set forth in the}} 1979 Belmont Report, a seminal guide for ethical research in the biomedical and behavioral sciences. Despite its age, the Belmont Report’s insightful abstraction renders it a valuable cornerstone for other domains. The Menlo Report describes how the three principles in the Belmont report <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>usefully</b> <b>applied</b> in fields related to research about or involving information and communication technology. ICT research raises new challenges resulting from interactions between humans and communications technologies. In particular, today’s ICT research contexts contend with ubiquitously connected network environments, overlaid with varied, often discordant legal regimes and social norms. The Menlo Report illustrates the application of these principles to information systems security research - a critical infrastructure priority with broad impact and demonstrated potential for widespread harm - although we expect the proposed framework to be relevant to other disciplines, including those targeted by the Belmont report but now operating in more complex and interconnected contexts. The Menlo Report details four core ethical principles: three from the original Belmont Report - respect for persons, beneficence and justice, and an additional principle - respect for law and public interest. The report explains each of these in the context of ICT research.|$|E

40|$|The general form of Maxwell’s {{velocity}} slip {{boundary condition}} for rarefied gas flows depends on both the geometry of the surface and the constitutive relations used to relate the viscous stress to rate of strain. The dependence on geometry is often overlooked in current rarefied flow calculations, and the generality of the constitutive dependence means the condition <b>can</b> also <b>be</b> <b>usefully</b> <b>applied</b> in regions where the Navier-Stokes equations fail, e. g. rarefied flows close to surfaces. In this paper we give examples illustrating the importance of both these dependencies and show, therefore, that implementing the general Maxwell condition produces substantially different results to conventional implementations of the condition. Finally, we also investigate a common numerical instability associated with Maxwell’s boundary condition, and propose an implicit solution method to overcome the problem...|$|R

To address this gap, we propose Canary, an approach for extracting and querying requirements-related information in online discussions. The highlight of our approach is a high-level query language that combines aspects of both requirements and discussion in online forums. We give the semantics of the query language in terms of relational databases and SQL. We demonstrate the usefulness of the language using examples on real data extracted from online discussions. Our approach relies on human annotations of online discussions. We highlight the subtleties involved in interpreting the content in online discussions and the assumptions and choices we made to effectively address them. We demonstrate the feasibility of generating high-quality annotations by obtaining them from lay Amazon Mechanical Turk users...|$|R
