A peristaltic pump is the most commonly used pump in FIA instruments but new variants of FIA technique use computer controlled syringe pumps that generate discontinuous flow precisely choreographed to the needs of assay protocol. The result is dramatic decrease in sample consumption, reagent consumption, and waste generation. The new technologies broadened applicability of FIA techniques from laboratory serial assays to research applications and continuous monitoring of environmental and industrial processes.|$|E
50|$|The {{stator core}} is built with lamination's of cold rolled {{grain-oriented}} sheet steel 0.013 in (0.033cm) thick, insulated {{from each other}} with insuline. The number of segments per circle is arranged so that the maximum practical percentage of core flux is {{in the direction of}} the oriented grain. The rings of lamination's are built into a skeleton frame which is flexibly supported inside the main stator frame to prevent double-frequency vibrations being transmitted to the foundations. Axial gas passages are provided within the core by holes punched in the lamination's, which line up throughout its length. The ends of the core are divided axially by spacers into a number of radial ducts. These ducts form the gas inlet and outlet passages for the axial gas passages. Separate radial ducts feed the extreme ends of the core with cold gas to cater for the increased heating experienced at the core ends during leading power factor operation. Each coil side of the stator winding consists of rectangular copper tubes, each tube being insulated with resin-impregnated glass braid, and the tubes are transposed within the <b>coil</b> <b>length</b> by the Roebel method to minimise stray copper losses. Inlet and outlet manifolds are arranged at opposite ends of the windings and all coil sides are fed in parallel from these. The water connections between the manifolds and coil sides are made with flexible hoses of insulating material. The electrical connections between coil sides consist of flexible copper straps, bolted and sweated to contact blocks which are brazed to the conductor tubes near to the end of each coil side. The rings used to connect up the phase groups to the terminals are also water cooled, the flow through these being in parallel with the flow through the coil sides.|$|E

Usually, epidural catheters are placed without confirmation of their position despite frequent reports of complications {{as a result of}} malposition. In this study, we evaluated the threading length of thoracic epidural catheters without coiling and assessed the influence of two different epidural approach angles on the threading <b>length</b> without <b>coiling.</b> Methods. Eighty-three patients scheduled for thoracotomy were enrolled and randomly allo-cated into the acute angle group and the obtuse angle group. In both groups, skin insertion was performed at the T 8 – 9 intervertebra level. Epidural access was performed under fluoro-scopy using a paramedian approach at the T 7 – 8 level in the acute angle group and at the T 6 – 7 level in the obtuse angle group, and an end-hole 19 -gauge epidural catheter was inserted. <b>Coiling</b> <b>length,</b> defined as the length of the catheter within the epidural space when any part of the catheter just begins to head caudally, was measured in both groups. Results. The <b>coiling</b> <b>length</b> was 7. 4 (4. 4) cm (95 % CI 6. 0 – 8. 7 cm) in the obtuse angle group compared with 4. 9 (3. 3) cm (95 % CI 3. 8 – 6. 0 cm) in the acute angle group (P 0. 005).

Approaching the thoracic epidural space with an obtuse approach angle provides longer <b>coiling</b> <b>length.</b> We recommend that an obtuse approach angle should be used to maxi-mize the chance of the catheter reaching the intended level with minimum risk of coiling...|$|R

30|$|The main {{advantage}} of hydrogel microcoils {{is to increase}} the packing density by hydrogel expansion among the coil interstices and to establish tight mechanical vessel occlusion without the aid of thrombus formation. These features may be helpful in the embolization procedure like for PAVMs under systemic heparinization. However, there have been few reports describing application of hydrogel microcoils for PAVM embolization. In an early report of peripheral application of hydrogel microcoils, the coils were deployed through the existing coil mesh in a partially recanalized PAVM (Nambiar et al. 2008). The additional increase in volume after hydrogel swelling helped to achieve complete occlusion of the PAVM. In other reported indications, hydrogel microcoils reduced the coil numbers when compared with fibered microcoils in prophylactic embolization of the gastroduodenal artery before yttrium- 90 radioembolization for liver cancers (Maleux et al. 2013). In another comparison study for intracranial aneurysms, the higher packing density, shorter total <b>coil</b> <b>length,</b> and lower recanalization rates were proven in the hydrogel microcoil group than in the bare coil group (White et al. 2011). The study suggested that hydrogel microcoils constitute at least 50 % of the total <b>coil</b> <b>length</b> for < 10  mm aneurysms, and at least two thirds of the total <b>coil</b> <b>length</b> for > 10  mm aneurysms. In our series, the median proportion of hydrogel microcoils was 66.7 % of the total <b>coil</b> <b>length.</b> However, there has been no report yet about the optimal proportion of hydrogel microcoils to decrease the recanalization rates of PAVMs. Although the significant sac shrinkage was obtained in our series in the short period up to eighteen months, longer-term follow-up is necessary to ensure the sac involution or freedom from symptoms, as reperfusion can occur in once resolved PAVMs even after more than two years (Milic et al. 2005).|$|E
