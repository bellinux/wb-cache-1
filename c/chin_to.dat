On April 1, Ebert announced his speech had not been restored. A further surgery was performed in April 2008 after Ebert fractured his hip in a fall. By 2011, Ebert was using a prosthetic <b>chin</b> <b>to</b> hide some of {{the damage done by}} his many chin, mouth, and throat surgeries.|$|E
5|$|A {{dominant}} male black wildebeest {{will have}} a harem of females and will not allow other males to mate with them. The breeding season occurs {{at the end of}} the rainy season and lasts a few weeks between February and April. When one of his females comes into oestrus the male concentrates on her and mates with her several times. Sexual behaviour by the male at this time includes stretching low, ears down, sniffing of the female's vulva, performing ritual urination and touching his <b>chin</b> <b>to</b> the female's rump. At the same time, the female keeps her tail upwards (sometimes vertically) or swishes it across the face of the male. The pair usually separates after copulation, but the female occasionally follows her mate afterwards, touching his rump with her snout. During the breeding season, the male loses condition as he spends little time grazing. Males are known to mount other males.|$|E
25|$|Clinical {{determinants}} include {{soft tissue}} analysis where the clinician assesses nasolabial angle, {{the relationship of}} the soft tissue portion of the <b>chin</b> <b>to</b> the nose, and the relationship between the upper and lower lips; also used is dental arch relationship assessment such as Angle's classification.|$|E

50|$|Yellow {{goatfish}} are benthic feeders, using {{a pair of}} long chemosensory barbels ("whiskers") {{protruding from}} their <b>chins</b> <b>to</b> rifle through the sediments {{in search of a}} meal.

25|$|At a {{news conference}} {{five days after the}} crash, NASCAR {{officials}} announced that the left lap belt on Earnhardt's seat belt harness had broken. Dr. Steve Bohannon, NASCAR's medical expert, said he thought the faulty belt had allowed Earnhardt's <b>chin</b> <b>to</b> strike the steering wheel, causing the fatal basilar skull fracture. This led to speculation that Earnhardt would have survived if his seat belt had not broken.|$|E
25|$|The species lacks {{distinct}} sexual dimorphism, but mature male monitors on Guam {{have been}} reported to be three times the mass of mature females. Males fight for females, and in one observation, after mounting the female, the male used his <b>chin</b> <b>to</b> rub the dorsum of the female's head and forequarters. While mounted and oriented head to head, the male and female slowly rotated in a clockwise direction through 360°, with the male remaining superior.|$|E
25|$|From {{the second}} verse, Rihanna {{and her boyfriend}} are seen happily running amok in a supermarket, pushing {{each other in a}} {{shopping}} cart and spraying canned drinks at each other. This scene is interrupted with Rihanna in a Pontiac Trans Am outside with her boyfriend who begins to recklessly drive in circles, resulting in Rihanna asking him to stop the car which ensues into an argument between the pair. The video then progressively shows the couple experiencing mounting difficulties in their relationship. Rihanna removes herself from the car and returns moments later where we see her boyfriend grab her <b>chin</b> <b>to</b> look at him, suggesting that he is domestically violent towards her. During the final chorus Rihanna can be seen vomiting what appears to be pink and white streamers; she is also seen passed out on the street while her boyfriend tries to revive her. In another scene, Rihanna is seen lying on a couch while her boyfriend tattoos the word 'MINE' on her backside. Eventually, Rihanna decides to leave her boyfriend after finding him passed out on the floor of his apartment – and most likely due to the previous events shown throughout the video. The clip ends with Rihanna curled up in the corner of a room, crying.|$|E

25|$|Sidewinders mature at two {{to three}} years of age, are capable of {{reproducing}} annually, and give birth to live young. Some females skip reproductive opportunities. Some might even skip two years if the food supply is scarce. Sidewinders mate in April through May and sometimes in fall. When the male and female mate, the male snake crawls along the female's back, rubbing her with his <b>chin</b> <b>to</b> stimulate or arouse her. The male then will wrap his tail around her tail, and then will try to bring their cloacae together. The cloaca is the posterior body opening through which snakes both excrete waste and reproduce. If the female wants to mate, she will lift her tail and allow him to mate with her. The snakes can mate for several hours, and if one of the snakes decides to move, the other is dragged along. Females might mate with several males in a season. Females give birth to five to 18 young in late summer to early fall. The young are born six to eight inches long. The birth takes only {{two to three}} hours altogether. Within a few minutes of being born, the baby sidewinder escapes from a thin, transparent membrane. The young stay at their natal burrow for seven to ten days until they shed, and then they disappear and have no future contact with their mother or their litter mates. While the density of sidewinders can be up to one individual per hectare, they rarely encounter each other except during mating season.|$|E

500|$|Castellaneta's normal {{speaking}} voice {{does not}} bear any resemblance to Homer's. To perform Homer's voice, Castellaneta lowers his <b>chin</b> <b>to</b> {{his chest and}} is said to [...] "let his I.Q. go". While in this state, he has ad-libbed several of Homer's least intelligent comments, such as the line [...] "I am so smart, s-m-r-t" [...] from [...] "Homer Goes to College" [...] (season five, 1993) which was a genuine mistake made by Castellaneta during recording. Castellaneta likes to stay in character during recording sessions, and he tries to visualize a scene {{so that he can}} give the proper voice to it.

500|$|In general, Roman cavalry helmets had {{enhanced}} protection, in {{the form}} of wider cheek-guards and deeper neck-guards, for the sides and back of the head than infantry helmets. Infantry were less vulnerable in those parts due to their tighter formation when fighting. During the 3rd century, infantry helmets tended to adopt the more protective features of Principate cavalry helmets. Cheek-guards could often be fastened together over the <b>chin</b> <b>to</b> protect the face, and covered the ears save for a slit to permit hearing e.g. the [...] "Auxiliary E" [...] type or its Niederbieber variant. Cavalry helmets became even more enclosed e.g. the [...] "Heddernheim" [...] type, which is close to the medieval great helm, but at the cost much reduced vision and hearing.|$|E
500|$|The teenage Victoria was a [...] "tall, dark girl, with violet eyes ... {{with the}} assuredness of an Empress {{and the high}} spirits of a tomboy," [...] {{according}} to one observer. Victoria had [...] "too little <b>chin</b> <b>to</b> be conventionally beautiful," [...] {{in the opinion of}} one of her biographers, but [...] "she had a good figure, deep blue eyes, and dark complexion." [...] In 1891, Victoria travelled with her mother to the funeral of Grand Duchess Alexandra Georgievna of Russia, the wife of her mother's brother Grand Duke Paul Alexandrovich. There Victoria met her first cousin Grand Duke Kirill Vladimirovich. Although the two were deeply attracted to each other, Victoria's mother was reluctant to allow her to marry him because the Russian Orthodox faith forbids the marriage of first cousins. She was also suspicious of the morality of the Romanov men. When her teenage daughters were impressed by their handsome cousins, their mother warned them against the Russian grand dukes who did not make good husbands.|$|E

5000|$|The Young Mizo Association (YMA) is a {{voluntary}} association in Mizoram whose mandate {{is to provide}} community service, which includes [...] "conservation of Mizo culture and heritage".

This breaches the international principle of non-refoulement because if <b>Chins</b> were <b>to</b> be sent back to Myanmar, persecution and suffering would be inevitable for them.

500|$|Around [...] long, Newton's parakeet {{was roughly}} the size of a rose-ringed parakeet. Its plumage was mostly greyish or slate blue in colour, which is unusual in Psittacula, a genus {{containing}} mostly green species. The male had stronger colours than the female and possessed a reddish instead of black beak, but details of a mature male's appearance are uncertain; only one male specimen is known, and it is believed to be immature. Mature males might have possessed red patches on the wing like the related Alexandrine parakeet. Both sexes had a black collar running from the <b>chin</b> <b>to</b> the nape, but this was clearer in the male. The legs were grey and the iris yellow. 17th-century accounts indicate that some members of the species were green, which would suggest that there were both blue and green colour morphs, but there is no definitive explanation for these reports. Little is known about its behaviour in life, but it may have fed on the nuts of the bois d'olive tree, along with leaves. It was very tame and was able to mimic speech.|$|E

The underside of the tail was greyish, the upper beak was dark reddish brown, and the mandible was black. The legs were grey and the iris yellow. The female was similar but had a greyer head and a black beak. The black collar was not so prominent as that of the male and did not extend {{to the back of the}} neck. The general appearance of Newton's parakeet was similar to the extant Psittacula species, including the black collar, but the bluish grey colouration set it apart from other members of its genus, which are mostly green.|$|E

500|$|Castellaneta is {{most famous}} {{for his role as}} Homer Simpson on the longest running {{animated}} television show The Simpsons. The Tracey Ullman Show included a series of animated shorts about a dysfunctional family. Voices were needed for the shorts, so the producers decided to ask Castellaneta and fellow cast member Julie Kavner to voice Homer and Marge Simpson rather than hire more actors. Homer's voice began as a loose impression of Walter Matthau, but Castellaneta could not [...] "get enough power behind that voice" [...] and could not sustain his Matthau impression for the nine- to ten-hour long recording sessions. He tried to find something easier, so he [...] "dropped the voice down", and developed it into a more versatile and humorous voice during the second and third season of the half-hour show. Castellaneta's normal speaking voice has no similarity to Homer's. To perform Homer's voice, Castellaneta lowers his <b>chin</b> <b>to</b> his chest, and is said to [...] "let his IQ go."
