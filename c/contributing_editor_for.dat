500|$|In {{the first}} half of 1923, Harding did two acts that were later said to {{indicate}} foreknowledge of death: he sold the Star (though undertaking to remain as a <b>contributing</b> <b>editor</b> <b>for</b> ten years after his presidency), and made a new will.

500|$|The {{film was}} well {{received}} by critics, both in its time period and in modern day.

[...] In a Film Mercury review, Anabel Lane predicted Florey would [...] "one day hold a position of one of the bigger film directors", and said of the film: [...] "If this production had been made in Europe and heralded as a hit, it would... have been called a masterpiece." [...] One reviewer from Variety even speculated as to whether A Hollywood Extra was [...] "an unannounced foreign-made short" [...] given how similar in style it was to European art films. Film director Henry King praised the film as [...] "way ahead of its time" [...] and [...] "a stroke of genius", declaring: [...] "It was the most original thought I ever saw".|$|E
