50|$|In 1930 Dorman {{introduced}} {{their first}} diesel engine, the RB, {{and from then}} on all new engines up to World War 2 were diesels. At the time of its introduction Dorman listed 19 different petrol engines from 8.5 to 100 bhp. This new twin-cylinder 4-stroke diesel used an Acro air-cell <b>combustion</b> <b>head.</b> The bore and stroke were 110mm and 180mm, giving a capacity of 3420cc, and it used Bosch 'solid' fuel injection.|$|E
50|$|The Carol {{was perhaps}} overengineered: {{it had a}} very strong {{monocoque}} body, a four-cylinder four-stroke engine with a five-bearing crankshaft and four-wheel independent suspension by torsion bars, but this led to high production costs, comparably high weight, and its very comfortable ride was offset by cramped accommodation. Nonetheless, the Carol was an incredible success in the marketplace, capturing 67% of the Kei market in its first year. A better equipped DeLuxe version was added in May 1962, along with a changed angle of the rear window to help it stay clean. In September 1963, shortly after a reshaped <b>combustion</b> <b>head</b> and upgrade to , a four-door version appeared.|$|E
5000|$|Major {{design changes}} to the 4.3L V6 for the 1996 model year. Like other small block Chevrolet V8s, the 4.3L engine {{received}} redesigned heads which had improved airflow and <b>combustion</b> efficiency. These <b>heads</b> {{are referred to as}} Vortec heads.|$|R
50|$|The engine {{made its}} {{official}} debut at the Geneva Motor Show {{in the new}} 1962 Renault Floride S, replacing the 845cc 40 hp Dauphine Gordini. The 956cc capacity, which delivered a dozen additional horsepower, (51 hp SAE),a few months later {{was seen in the}} new R8 sedan. For racing and motorsport versions, Amédée Gordini was responsible for designing a hemispherical <b>combustion</b> chambered <b>head</b> allowing 85-90 hp for a 1000cc version as opposed to 70 hp for the previous 700cc Gordini engine. Gordini revealed some weaknesses in the rigidity of the block which could lead to blown head gaskets; this prompted Renault to stiffen the block slightly.|$|R

50|$|Humphrey's pump {{consists}} of a large U-shaped tube, filled with water. One end is sealed by a heavy cast iron 'combustion head'. The <b>combustion</b> <b>head</b> contains the inlet and exhaust valves, the ignition source and withstands {{the pressure of the}} combustion chamber. Water enters the pump through sprung inlet valves below the combustion chamber. A distinctive feature of the Humphrey pump, compared to others, is that the water only has to flow through this single set of valves: there are no non-return outlet valves, only the inertia of the delivered water within the outlet pipe is used to control its flow. As there are no delivery valves opening and closing suddenly, the water flow changes smoothly, avoiding water hammer and the usual problems for this type of pump.|$|E

40|$|A {{new concept}} {{for the design}} of a {{residential}} oil burner is presented involving a low pressure, air atomizing nozzle. Advantages of this approach, relative to conventional, pressure atomized burners include: ability to operate at very low excess air levels without smoke, ability to operate at low (and possibly variable) rates, reduced boiler fouling, and low NO{sub x}. The nozzle used is a low pressure, airblast atomizer which can achieve fuel spray drop sizes similar to conventional nozzles and very good combustion performance with air pressure as low as 5 inches of water (1. 24 kPa). A burner head has been developed for this nozzle and combustion test results are presented {{in a wide variety of}} equipment including cast iron and steel boilers, warm air furnaces, and water heaters over the firing rate range 0. 25 gph to 1. 0 gph (10 to 41 kW). Beyond the nozzle and <b>combustion</b> <b>head</b> the burner system must be developed and two approaches have been taken. The first involves a small, brushless DC motor/fan combination which uses high fan speed to achieve air pressures from 7 to 9 inches of water (1. 74 to 2. 24 kPa). Fuel is delivered to the atomizer at less than 1 psig (6. 9 kPa) using a solenoid pump and flow metering orifice. At 0. 35 gph (14 kW) the electric power draw of this burner is less than 100 watts. In a second configuration a conventional motor is used with a single stage fan which develops 5 to 6 inches of water pressure (1. 24 to 1. 50 kPa) at similar firing rates. This burner uses a conventional type fuel pump and metering orifice to deliver fuel. The fuel pump is driven by the fan motor, very much like a conventional burner. This second configuration is seen as more attractive to the heating industry and is now being commercialized. Field tests with this burner have been conducted at 0. 35 gph (14 kW) with a side-wall vented boiler/water storage tank combination...|$|E

50|$|Settled in Manhattan, the two {{brothers}} set up Ardun (derived from Arkus and Duntov) which supplied parts to the military and manufactured aluminum overhead valve, hemispherical <b>combustion</b> chamber <b>heads</b> for the Flathead Ford V8 engine. The purpose of the overhead valve design (already common with in-line 6 cylinder engines of that era), was to cure the persistent overheating of the valve-in-block flathead designs. The Ford flat-head V-8 'siamesed' the two center exhaust ports into a single tube, passing the hot gasses between those two cylinders (a massive heat transfer to coolant which was not present in overhead valve designs). The Ardun heads (designed with overhead valves, now presenting no over-heating problems) allowed dramatic increases in power output from the Ford V8—to over 300 horsepower. Ardun grew into a 300 employee engineering company with a name as revered as Offenhauser, but the company later {{went out of business}} after some questionable financial decisions by a partner that Zora and Yura had taken on.

40|$|The {{objective}} of the current thesis work could be basically summarized as {{the realization of the}} flight version designs for the injector assembly and the <b>combustion</b> chamber <b>head</b> of a 500 N liquid bipropellant rocket engine. The work is embedded in the German Space Administration(DLR) -STERN project “SMART ROCKETS” consisting in the design, manufacture and flight campaign of a Liquid Oxygen-Ethanol propelled rocket. Both design problems were carried on in parallel, with the aim of not only realize a functional design capable of satisfying the driving requirements, but also amenable of being incorporated in the evolving engine concept, whose components interface features represent crucial aspects for the whole assembly realization and validation. The path toward the definition of the flight version coaxial swirl injector started with the characterization of the existing test injectors built within the project, based on existing flow models and experimental data gained through a series of cold flow and combustion tests. Those tests evidenced that the available fluid dynamic models, based on the strong hypothesis of inviscid flow, were only capable of accurately describe the behavior of the oxidizer injector while gave unacceptable prediction errors for the fuel injector, leading to the difficulty in find a reliable massflow-pressure correlation for the injection assembly. Therefore the focus shifted in enhancing the flow model including the viscosity effects believed to be the reason of the fuel injector discharge capability drop. The characterization of the Boundary Layer structure inside the swirl injector chamber under some simplifying hypotheses brought to a close form analytical solution of the viscous swirler problem. Thus, further cold flow tests were planned and conducted in order to verify the validity of the obtained solution: the test results matched with great accuracy the predictions of the built viscous model over a wide range of measurements, leading to the assessment of the enhanced injector flow model and the building of the operative map for both injectors. This gave the possibility to design the flight version injectors meeting the baselined requirements. The definition of the flight version <b>combustion</b> chamber <b>head</b> also started considering the analysis of the current project process: the interface nature of this element forced its design to be subject to several constraints coming from the other subsystems development. The optimization process of the flight version focused on the choice of the combination of geometric and material features of the designed concept, facing the compromise between weight saving and thermal-structural integrity. The use of lightweight materials such Aluminum alloys seemed to be the most promising solution for a lightweight design and an active cooling strategy has been implemented in order for the lightweight structure to withstand the thermal loads coming from combustion. A thermal model has been built for the convective heat transfer of burning gases and coolant beside the injector plate and coupled with a structural analysis, through which the optimum “leading thickness” of the structure has been obtained as the outcome of a thermal/stress analytical optimization, then validated through the use of FEM codes. Tuned the interface features together with the other mattering subsystems, a final lightweight design has been assessed with the choice of a High Temperature Aluminum Alloy, ready to be manufactured and capable of satisfying both thermal-structural and interface requirements...|$|R

Although the frame and suspension were innovative, the engine was essentially a generator, designed to run for long periods at a steady speed and it did not cope well with the varying engine speeds of motorcycling. There was also a tendency to sideways shaking at low engine speeds which was a feature of the horizontally opposed engine. Douglas hired former Sunbeam motorcycles designer Erling Poppe as Technical Director, Freddie Dixon as their specialist engine tuner and Walter Moore (who designed the Norton CS1) as Works Superintendent.

40|$|Gaseous methane and 90 % {{hydrogen}} peroxide at an equivalence ratio of 0. 8 {{were used to}} study combustion instabilities in the region where the system transitioned from stable to unstable combustion. A variable geometry unstable rocket combustor was used at a chamber pressure of 210 psi. The combustor consists of a coaxial shear injector and a simple dump plane combustor. The oxidizer injector is mounted on a translating shaft that allows the oxidizer post length to be changed from a ½ wave resonator to a ¼ wave resonator {{during the course of}} a test. The oxidizer injector was translated forward and backward to check for hysteresis effects. A series of tests with the oxidizer injector fixed at a given location were also performed. The results indicate that the translating post moves slow enough compared to the frequency of the pressure oscillations that the system can be considered “quasi-steady. ” High frequency pressure data from the oxidizer and fuel manifold, oxidizer post, and various chamber locations were obtained at a scan rate of at least 100 kHz. The physics of the combustion process were examined to determine whether or not they remained constant as the system transitioned from marginally stable to highly unstable combustion. The primary frequency of combustion, pressure mode shape, and phase angle between pressure at the head end of the chamber and pressure at the aft end of the chamber were found to change as the system transitioned to unstable combustion. The first five inches of the combustion chamber were replaceable with a quartz/acrylic housing. This allowed the <b>combustion</b> at the <b>head</b> end of the combustor to be filmed with a high speed camera. Line of sight optical images were obtained at scan rate of 10 kHz.

After helping Korra free captive airbenders in the Earth Kingdom capital of Ba Sing Se, Lin would join Team Avatar (Korra, Asami, Bolin and Mako) in searching for one more reported airbender in the Earth Kingdom city of Zaofu. When Lin arrived in Zaofu, she elected to stay on the ship instructing Team Avatar to not reveal her presence. However Lin's presence was detected and Suyin, matriarch of Zaofu, met Lin on the ship. Suyin revealed to Team Avatar that she was Lin’s sister, upon which Lin reminded her that she was her half-sister. Suyin shared that Lin’s niece, Opal, was the airbender. At an ensuing dinner, Lin made a number of snide remarks to many of Suyin statements. Before the argument escalated they were interrupted by Varrick, who was out of prison and resided in Zaofu. Later that night, Opal and Korra visited Lin in her room. In an attempt to reconcile the two sisters, Opal shared with Lin that she wanted her {{to be a part of}} the family. Lin responded with a cold [...] "get out". Opal ran out of the room in tears. In response to Lin’s behavior, Korra angrily told Lin that the police chief would always be a lonely and bitter woman before storming out of the room. Lin cried in her room alone. The next morning, Lin took up Suyin’s trusted advisor Aiwei advice to visit the city's acupuncturist to deal with her stress. During the ensuing sessions, which involved reaching into her buried memories, she revisited her checkered past with Suyin.

Upon awakening from her final session, she disregarded the doctor's suggestion to rest, deciding instead to confront Suyin. An enraged Lin started yet another argument with Suyin.

When an angry Opal finally broke up the fight, demanding to know why two sisters would want to hurt each other, Lin passed out from exhaustion, sleeping for the next sixteen hours. Upon waking up, Lin was well-rested and was in a substantially more positive mood. She apologized to Opal for her behavior, explaining she was not comfortable speaking about personal matters. She advised Opal to train with the other airbenders away from home, which Opal ultimately did. Lin also reconciled with Suyin. Later, Lin would be involved in a large-scale clash with the Red Lotus, an anarchist group. During the battle she and Suyin fought P'Li, a formidable foe and combustion-bender. P’li had the rare ability to generate fire from her forehead, causing explosions. Lin relayed to her sister that when she drew P'Li's fire, Suyin was to incapacitate her. Suyin objected, but Lin told her sibling she loved her before unilaterally initiating the plan. The police chief was hit by a blast from P’Li, nearly falling over a cliff. In one of the series’ more graphic moments, as P’Li was preparing to knock Lin off the cliff with a blast, Suyin quickly metalbent her plate of armor around the <b>combustion</b> bender’s <b>head.</b> This caused P'Li's explosion to blow up in her face, instantly killing her. While the fatal explosion was not shown on-screen, P’Li’s demise was apparent.|$|R
40|$|Methods for the {{determination}} of trace elements in interfering matrices were developed. The methods involve two strategies for the reduction of interferences: the use of new pretreatment methods for use with existing instrumentation, {{and the development of}} new instrumentation. ^ A comparison was made of inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) detection limits and interference reduction for arsenic by hydride generation, flow injection, continuous aspiration, and mixed gas methods. Practical considerations in implementing these common techniques, {{as well as in the}} general use and maintenance of an ELAN 5000 ICP-MS instrument are presented for the benefit of new users. ^ Two approaches for the elimination of interferences in {{the determination}} of arsenic in gold by ICP-MS. The main challenges in this analysis were the arsenic signal suppression by gold and the polyatomic interference due to chloride. A method was developed for the batch mode reductive precipitation removal of interfering gold matrix from the sample prior to hydride generation and detection of arsenic. This method has great potential value as the basis for other simple methods for the removal of transition metals that interfere with hydride generation. An on-line anion exchange method for the removal of interfering gold prior to hydride generation was subsequently developed to improve the speed of analysis. The batch-mode reduction method for the removal of gold resulted in a better detection limit than the anion exchange method. However, the automated anion exchange gold removal method required less bench chemistry, was faster, consumed less reagents, and created less mess than the off-line method. ^ On-line solid phase extraction methods are a valuable and increasingly popular method for the removal of matrix interferences. The automation of sample pretreatment as well as the small sample size required when the technique is combined with flow injection make it ideal for use in the analysis of hazardous materials. The severe signal suppression of uranium on lithium, beryllium, magnesium, and aluminum was overcome by the on-line flow injection-solid phase extraction removal of uranium using a column packed with Tru-Spec resin. The column was regenerated on-line using ammonium oxalate. ^ The development of an internal combustion engine as a novel source for atomic emission spectrometry was begun. This preliminary stage of development focused on the identification of important experimental parameters to be considered in future work. A one cylinder four stroke engine was modified to allow optical access through the cylinder <b>head.</b> <b>Combustion</b> radiation was monitored with a photomultiplier tube and the signal was stored using LabView software. It is hoped that this work will be the basis for the development of an inexpensive, portable, rugged instrument that will accept a variety of fuels. ...|$|R
