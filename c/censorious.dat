5|$|According to Meintjes, Kruger {{was still}} not {{particularly}} anti-British; he thought the British {{had made a mistake}} and would rectify the situation if this could be proven to them. After conducting a poll through the former republican infrastructure—587 signed in favour of the annexation, 6,591 against—he organised a second deputation to London, made up of himself and Joubert with Bok again serving as secretary. The envoys met the British High Commissioner in Cape Town, Sir Bartle Frere, and arrived in London on 29 June 1878 to find a <b>censorious</b> letter from Shepstone waiting for them, along with a communication that since Kruger was agitating against the government he had been dismissed from the executive council.|$|E
25|$|Hayakawa's early {{films were}} not popular in Japan because many felt that his roles portrayed {{an image of}} Japanese men being sadistic and cruel. Many Japanese viewers found this {{portrayal}} — which made him popular in the U.S. — insulting. Nationalistic groups in particular were <b>censorious.</b> Some Japanese believed that Hayakawa was contributing to increased anti-Japanese sentiment in the U.S., and regarded him as a traitor to the Japanese people. After Hayakawa established himself as an American superstar, the negative tone in the press that regarded him as a national and racial shame almost completely disappeared, and Japanese media started publicizing Hayakawa's cinematic achievements instead.|$|E
500|$|Dworkin also {{attracted}} criticism from sex-positive feminists, in {{what became known}} as the feminist sex wars of the late 1970s and 1980s. The sex wars were a series of heated debates which polarized feminist thought on a number of issues relating to sex and sexuality. Sex-positive feminist critics criticized Dworkin's legal activism as <b>censorious,</b> and argued that her work on pornography and sexuality promoted an essentialist, conservative, or repressive view of sexuality, which they often characterized as [...] "anti-sex" [...] or [...] "sex-negative". Her criticisms of common heterosexual sexual expression, pornography, prostitution, and sadomasochism were frequently claimed to disregard women's own agency in sex, or to deny women's sexual choices. Dworkin countered that her critics often misrepresented her views, and that under the heading of [...] "choice" [...] and [...] "sex-positivity", her feminist critics were failing to question the often violent political structures that confined women's choices and shaped the meaning of sex acts.|$|E
500|$|During {{the late}} 1970s and 1980s, Dworkin {{became known as}} a {{spokeswoman}} for the feminist anti-pornography movement, and for her writing on pornography and sexuality, particularly [...] (1981) and Intercourse (1987), which remain her two most widely known books. She wrote on pornography from a feminist perspective and in opposition to obscenity law, and she worked with Women Against Pornography and Linda Boreman. She considered the pornography industry to be based on turning women into objects for abuse by men. Dworkin and Catharine MacKinnon developed a legislative approach based on civil rights rather than obscenity to outlaw pornography and allow lawsuits against pornographers for damages, but their efforts were largely unsuccessful. She testified at a federal commission against pornography, leading some stores to withdraw certain magazines from sale, but a court ruled the government's efforts unconstitutional. Critics argued that no causal relationship between pornography and harm to women had been found. In 1992, a Canadian court adapted parts of Dworkin and MacKinnon's theory on sex equality, although Dworkin opposed parts of the court's view. Some sex-positive feminists criticized Dworkin's views as <b>censorious</b> and as denying women's agency or choice in sexual relationships, leading to the so-called feminist sex wars.|$|E
500|$|Spiegelman is a {{prominent}} {{advocate for the}} comics medium and comics literacy. [...] He believes the medium echoes the way the human brain processes information. [...] He has toured the US with a lecture called [...] "Comix 101", examining its history and cultural importance. [...] He sees comics' low status in the late 20th century as having come down from where {{it was in the}} 1930s and 1940s, when comics [...] "tended to appeal to an older audience of GIs and other adults". [...] Following the advent of the <b>censorious</b> Comics Code Authority in the mid-1950s, Spiegelman sees comics' potential as having stagnated until the rise of underground comix in the late 1960s. [...] He taught courses in the history and aesthetics of comics at schools such as the School of Visual Arts in New York. [...] As co-editor of Raw, he helped propel the careers of younger cartoonists whom he mentored, such as Chris Ware, and published the work of his School of Visual Arts students, such as Kaz, Drew Friedman, and Mark Newgarden. [...] Some of the work published in Raw was originally turned in as class assignments.|$|E
500|$|MacGregor reached Aux Cayes to find news of {{this latest}} debacle had preceded him, and he was shunned. A friend in Jamaica, Thomas Higson, {{informed}} him through letters that Josefa and Gregorio had been evicted, and until Higson's intervention had sought sanctuary in a slave's hut. MacGregor was wanted in Jamaica for piracy and so could not join his family there. He similarly could {{not go back to}} Bolívar, who was so outraged by MacGregor's recent conduct that he accused the Scotsman of treason and ordered his death by hanging if he ever set foot on the South American mainland again. MacGregor's whereabouts for the half year following October 1819 are unknown. Back in London in June 1820, Michael Rafter published his highly <b>censorious</b> account of MacGregor's adventures, Memoirs of Gregor M'Gregor, dedicating the book to his brother Colonel William Rafter and the troops abandoned at Porto Bello and Rio de la Hacha. In his summary Rafter speculated that following the latter episode MacGregor was [...] "politically, though not naturally dead"—"to suppose", he wrote, [...] "that any person could be induced again to join him in his desperate projects, would be to conceive a degree of madness and folly of which human nature, however fallen, is incapable".|$|E

Yugoslavia and Its Predecessors in Recent Historiography, Dušan J. Djordjevich observes that [...] "the {{quantity and quality}} of new historiography on Serbs and Serbia are disappointing", and states that [...] "fforts to reinterpret or fill gaps in the literature are often subject to obtrusive, distorting agendas of apology or condemnation". In a footnote to these observations, Djordjevich describes Cohen's and another book as ones which explore important topics, but [...] "in which <b>censorious</b> zeal trumps balanced scholarship".|$|E
2500|$|Beyond Italy, Reni's {{influence}} {{was important in}} the style of many Spanish Baroque artists, such as Jusepe de Ribera and Bartolomé Esteban Murillo. His work was greatly appreciated in France—Stendhal believed Reni must have had [...] "a French soul"—and influenced generations of French artists such as Eustache Le Sueur, Charles Le Brun, Joseph-Marie Vien, and Jean-Baptiste Greuze. In the 19th century, Reni's reputation declined as a result of changing taste—epitomized by John Ruskin's <b>censorious</b> judgment that the artist's work was sentimental and false. A revival of interest in Reni has occurred since 1954, when an important retrospective exhibition of his work was mounted in Bologna.|$|E

He reiterated that it was useless to 'become <b>censorious</b> about , to say there is no God'. He also mentioned that his novel, The Book of Dust, is based on the 'extreme danger of putting power into the hands of those who believe in some absolute creed, whether that is Christianity or Islam or Marxism'.|$|E
2500|$|Blethyn co-starred as Bobby Darin's mother Polly Cassotto in Beyond the Sea, a 2004 biographical {{film about}} the singer. The film was a {{financial}} disappointment: budgeted at an estimated US$25 million, it opened to little notice and grossed only $6 million in its North American theatrical run. Margaret Pomeranz of At the Movies said that her casting was [...] "a bit mystifying". Afterwards, Blethyn starred in A Way of Life, playing a bossy and <b>censorious</b> mother-in-law of a struggling young woman, played by Stephanie James, and in the television film Belonging, starring as a middle-aged childless woman, who is left {{to look after the}} elderly relatives of her husband and to make a new life for herself, after he leaves her for a younger woman. Blethyn received a Golden FIPA Award and a BAFTA nomination for the latter role.|$|E
2500|$|Aiken was {{appointed}} to this post by de Valera at {{the outbreak of the}} Second World War in 1939. Aiken gained notoriety in liberal Dublin circles for his overseeing of censorship. A trip to procure arms and supplies from America was ultimately unsuccessful, although Aiken did manage to secure two merchant ships. Aiken also oversaw the management of defence and recruitment to the Defence Forces. His clashes with R. M. Smyllie, editor of The Irish Times, ensured his <b>censorious</b> attitude was resented by many. Aiken, however, justified these measures, citing the 'terrible and all prevailing force of modern warfare'. During the Emergency he was also put in charge of Government censorship. He remained a confirmed anglophobe; thinking that Britain would lose the war in 1940, he refused to back McDonald's Plan for the Unification of Ireland. Yet according to De Valera he was [...] "a dogged and inquisistive minister." ...|$|E
2500|$|Amsterdam and Rotterdam {{operated}} {{as important}} cosmopolitan centres where merchant ships from {{many parts of}} the world brought people of various customs and beliefs. This flourishing commercial activity encouraged a culture relatively tolerant of the play of new ideas, to a considerable degree sheltered from the <b>censorious</b> hand of ecclesiastical authority (though those considered to have gone [...] "too far" [...] might have gotten [...] persecuted even in the Netherlands). Not by chance were the philosophical works of both Descartes and Spinoza developed in the cultural and intellectual background of the Dutch Republic in the 17th century. Spinoza may have had access to a circle of friends who were unconventional in terms of social tradition, including members of the Collegiants. One of the people he knew was Niels Stensen, a brilliant Danish student in Leiden; others included Albert Burgh, with whom Spinoza is known to have corresponded.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the late}} 1970s, {{economic}} reforms by Deng Xiaoping in mainland China {{led to the}} introduction of gangtai culture of Hong Kong and Taiwan, and pop music returned to mainland China. However, for a time the government still have a <b>censorious</b> attitude toward pop music; for example, Hong Kong's icon Anita Mui was banned from returning to the mainland concert stage after performing the song [...] "Bad Girl" [...] during the 1990s in China as punishment for what the Chinese government called her rebellious attitude. [...] Nevertheless, pop music continue to increase in popularity in mainland China, and by 2005, China had overtaken Taiwan in term of the retail value of its music sales. The beginning of the 21st century has seen an increasing number of mainland Chinese artists who produced a wide range of Mandarin pop songs and the release of many new albums. However, despite having a much larger population and increasing consumption of Chinese pop music, China is not yet considered a major production hub of pop music.|$|E
2500|$|One of Burnand's biggest successes, both in Punch and on stage, was satire of the {{aesthetic}} movement. His play The Colonel (1881), based on The Serious Family, a play by Morris Barnett, ran for 550 performances and toured extensively. It made so much money for the actor-manager Edgar Bruce {{that he was able}} to build the Prince of Wales Theatre. Burnand rushed The Colonel into production to make sure that it opened several months before Gilbert and Sullivan's similarly themed comic opera, Patience, but Patience ran even longer than The Colonel. Oscar Wilde, no fan of Burnand's farces, wrote, in anticipation of seeing Patience: [...] "With Gilbert and Sullivan I am sure we will have something better than the dull farce of The Colonel". For the Gaiety Theatre, Burnand wrote a burlesque of The Tempest entitled Ariel in October 1883, with music by Meyer Lutz, starring Nellie Farren and Arthur Williams. The Times complained of the [...] "flatness and insipidity" [...] of Burnand's text and of his vulgarising the original. The Observer was less <b>censorious,</b> finding the piece moderately amusing, and correctly predicting that it would run successfully until it had to make way for the annual Gaiety pantomime at Christmas.|$|E
2500|$|In an {{analysis}} of Parry's compositional process, Michael Allis draws attention to a widely held but inaccurate belief that Parry was a facile composer who dashed off new works without effort. He quotes the mid-20th century critics H C Colles and Eric Blom as equating Parry's supposed facility with superficiality. Allis also quotes Parry's diary, which regularly recorded his difficulties in composition: [...] "struggled along with the Symphony", [...] "thoroughly terrible and wearing grind over the revisions", [...] "stuck fast" [...] and so on. Parry himself is partly responsible for another belief about his music, that he was neither interested in nor good at orchestration. In a lecture at the RCM he was <b>censorious</b> of Berlioz who, in Parry's view, disguised commonplace musical ideas by glittering orchestration: [...] "When divested of its amazingly variegated colour [...] the ideas themselves do not convince us or exert much fascination." [...] Bax and others took this to mean that Parry (and Stanford and Mackenzie) [...] "regarded sensuous beauty of orchestral sound as not quite nice". [...] In 2001, the American writers Nicholas Slonimsky and Laura Kuhn took the view: [...] "In his orchestral music, Parry {{played a significant role}} in the fostering of the British symphonic tradition. While his orchestral works owe much to the German Romanticists, particularly Mendelssohn, Schumann, and Brahms, he nevertheless developed a personal style notable for its fine craftsmanship and mastery of diatonic writing. His 5 [...] reveal a growing assurance in handling large forms. He also wrote some effective incidental music and fine chamber pieces." ...|$|E
2500|$|The musicologist Christopher Palmer was <b>censorious</b> {{of those}} who sought to characterise Bliss's music as [...] "an early {{tendency}} to enfant terribilisme yielding very quickly to a compromise with the Establishment and a perpetuating of the Elgar tradition". Nonetheless, [...] {{as a young man}} Bliss was certainly regarded as avant garde. [...] Madam Noy, a [...] "witchery" [...] song, was first performed in June 1920. The lyric is by an anonymous author, and the setting is for soprano with flute, clarinet, bassoon, harp, viola, and bass. [...] In a 1923 study of Bliss, Edwin Evans wrote that the piquant instrumental background to the gruesome story [...] established the direction that Bliss was to take. [...] The second Chamber Rhapsody (1919) is [...] "an idyllic work for soprano, tenor, flute, cor anglais, and bass, the two voices vocalising on 'Ah' throughout, and being placed as instruments in the ensemble." [...] Bliss contrasted the pastoral tone of that work with Rout (1920) an uproarious piece for soprano and instrumental ensemble; [...] " [...] the music conveys an impression such as one might gather at an open window at carnival time … the singer is given a series of meaningless syllables chosen for their phonetic effect". In his next work, Conversations [...] for violin, viola, cello, flute and oboe (1921), Bliss chose a deliberately prosaic subject. It consists of five sections, entitled [...] "Committee Meeting," [...] "In the Wood," [...] "In the Ball-room," [...] "Soliloquy," [...] and [...] "In the Tube at Oxford Circus." [...] Evans wrote of this work that although the instrumentation is ingenious, [...] "much of [...] interest is polyphonic, especially in the first and last numbers." ...|$|E

60|$|When the {{conversation}} ranges from the mystery overhanging the <b>censorious</b> young gentleman's behaviour, {{to the general}} topics of the day, he sustains his character to admiration. He considers the new tragedy well enough for a new tragedy, but Lord bless us-well, no matter; he could say {{a great deal on}} that point, but he would rather not, lest he should be thought ill-natured, as he knows he would be. 'But is not Mr. So-and-so's performance truly charming?' inquires a young lady. 'Charming!' replies the <b>censorious</b> young gentleman. 'Oh, dear, yes, certainly; very charming-oh, very charming indeed.' After this, he stirs the fire, smiling contemptuously all the while: and a modest young gentleman, who has been a silent listener, thinks what a great thing it must be, to have such a critical judgment. Of music, pictures, books, and poetry, the <b>censorious</b> young gentleman has an equally fine conception. As to men and women, he can tell all about them at a glance. 'Now let us hear your opinion of young Mrs. Barker,' says some great believer in the powers of Mr. Fairfax, 'but don't be too severe.' 'I never am severe,' replies the <b>censorious</b> young gentleman. 'Well, never mind that now. She is very lady-like, is she not?' 'Lady-like!' repeats the <b>censorious</b> young gentleman (for he always repeats when he is at a loss for anything to say). 'Did you observe her manner? Bless my heart and soul, Mrs. Thompson, did you observe her manner?-that's all I ask.' 'I thought I had done so,' rejoins the poor lady, much perplexed; 'I did not observe it very closely perhaps.' 'Oh, not very closely,' rejoins the <b>censorious</b> young gentleman, triumphantly. 'Very good; then I did. Let us talk no more about her.' The <b>censorious</b> young gentleman purses up his lips, and nods his head sagely, as he says this; and it is forthwith whispered about, that Mr. Fairfax (who, though he is a little prejudiced, must be admitted to be a very excellent judge) has observed something exceedingly odd in Mrs. Barker's manner.|$|E
