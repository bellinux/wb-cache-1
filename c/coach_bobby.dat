5|$|In the United Kingdom, {{the game}} was shown live on ITV's The Match, which aired a live Division One game most {{weeks of the season}} from 1988 to 1992. Elton Welsby {{presented}} coverage and his guest was the England <b>coach</b> <b>Bobby</b> Robson. The match commentator on the night was Brian Moore, alongside former Tottenham Hotspur manager David Pleat. On radio, the action was summarised by Peter Jones on BBC Radio 2.|$|E
5|$|Florida State began 2010 after a 7–6 {{record in}} 2009 {{that ended with}} a 33–21 win against West Virginia in the 2010 Gator Bowl. Florida State also began the year under a new head <b>coach.</b> <b>Bobby</b> Bowden, who retired after 57years as a head coach, 34 at Florida State and 33consecutive winning seasons, was {{replaced}} by Jimbo Fisher. Immediately before the 2010 season began, Bowden claimed he had been pushed out as head coach, causing a stir before Florida State's first game.|$|E

5|$|Florida State's victory {{raised it}} {{to a final}} record of 84, and Virginia Tech's loss brought it also to a final record of 84. Following the loss, the Hokies had a 510 record in bowl games, {{including}} 13 in the Gator Bowl and 45 in bowl games under head coach Frank Beamer. Florida State's victory gave Seminoles head <b>coach</b> <b>Bobby</b> Bowden the 322nd win of his career, tying him for second in the overall Division I career wins list with Bear Bryant.|$|E
5|$|Under head <b>coach</b> <b>Bobby</b> Bowden, the Seminole {{football}} team {{became one of}} the nation's most competitive college {{football team}}s. The Seminoles played in five national championship games between 1993 and 2001 and won the championship in 1993 and 1999. The FSU football team was the most successful team in college football during the 1990s, boasting an 89% winning percentage. Bobby Bowden would retire with the record for most all-time career wins in Division I football. Jimbo Fisher succeeded Bowden as head coach in 2010. FSU football is well known for introducing talented players into the NFL; see list of Florida State University athletic alumni.|$|E
5|$|Bobby Robson was {{replaced}} at Ipswich by his chief <b>coach,</b> <b>Bobby</b> Ferguson. Ferguson {{made the transition}} from coach to manager in July 1982, but some success in the various cup competitions was offset by {{an end to the}} high league positions the club had enjoyed under Robson. In the three seasons from 1982–83 to 1984–85, Ipswich reached the FA Cup quarter-final and League Cup semi-final in 1985, but declined in the league, finishing 9th, 12th and 17th. In the following season, the team's league form was even poorer, resulting in a 20th-place finish and relegation to the Second Division. Ipswich finished fifth in the Second Division in the 1986–87 season to qualify for the play-offs, but Ferguson resigned after losing to 2–1 on aggregate to Charlton Athletic.|$|E

5|$|On September 23, 2007, however, he tore {{his right}} ACL while being {{restrained}} by Padres manager Bud Black during an altercation with first base umpire Mike Winters. Home plate umpire Brian Runge reportedly told Bradley that Winters {{said that he}} had tossed his bat in Runge's direction in a previous at-bat. After Bradley reached first base, he questioned Winters about the alleged bat throwing and subsequent communication with Runge. According to Bradley and Padres first base <b>coach</b> <b>Bobby</b> Meacham, Winters addressed Bradley with a barrage of profanity. Bradley then moved towards Winters. While restrained by Black, Bradley fell to the ground and injured himself. He missed the final week of the regular season in 2007, during which the Padres lost to the Colorado Rockies in a one game playoff for the National League wild card on October 1.|$|E
5|$|The Seminoles' second {{possession}} {{of the second half}} began with more success than their first possession. State gained a first down on two running plays, then Rix completed a 14-yard pass for another first down. Now at their 36-yard line, the Seminoles advanced the ball for short ground gains on the next two plays, then Rix completed a 30-yard pass to Bell. Following the pass and first down, the Seminoles were at the Tech 34-yard line. Two short gains and an incomplete pass failed to gain another first down, so State head <b>coach</b> <b>Bobby</b> Bowden ordered kicker Beitia into the game to attempt a 47-yard field goal. The kick attempt was successful, and Beitia gave Florida State a 1310 lead with 1:42 remaining in the quarter.|$|E
5|$|The current {{color scheme}} was {{selected}} in 1974 by then athletic director and former head <b>coach</b> <b>Bobby</b> Dodd. The original Wreck decor featured a wooden GT shield {{on both the}} driver and passenger-side doors. This shield was removed during Dodd's revitalization of the old Model A. Dodd chose an old gold paint from a Lincoln car paint catalogue as the base for the new color scheme. He also placed a slightly stretched GT emblem on the door, a Tech helmet on the rear quarter panel, and a 1952 version of the Yellow Jacket on the front quarter panel. According to Tech lore, Bobby Dodd was so enamored with the Lincoln gold that he changed the football helmet and uniform color to match the new Ramblin' Wreck paint scheme.|$|E

5|$|Virginia Tech quarterback Marcus Vick was {{predicted}} {{to be the}} key player for the favored Virginia Tech Hokies in pregame discussion. Vick had led the Hokies to a fifth place national ranking and an offense that earned 610rushing yards in the final two games of the regular season. Off the field, the matchup between head coaches also was a point of interest. At the time, Florida State head <b>coach</b> <b>Bobby</b> Bowden had the most wins of any active head coach in college football, while Virginia Tech head coach Frank Beamer was ranked third. Beamer had never defeated Bowden in a game. Before the game, Beamer was named the ACC's 2005 Coach of the Year for the second consecutive year.|$|E
5|$|After a {{successful}} (8–1–1) football season in 1955, Tech {{was invited to}} play in the 1956 Sugar Bowl in New Orleans against the University of Pittsburgh. It would be the school's fifth straight bowl appearance under renowned <b>coach</b> <b>Bobby</b> Dodd. Pittsburgh had a black starting player, fullback Bobby Grier, but as Tech had played a 1953 game against a desegregated Notre Dame team, and the University of Georgia had very recently played out-of-state games against desegregated opponents, president Van Leer and the Tech Athletic Association saw the game's contract as acceptable. However, racial tension in the South was high following the recent Brown v. Board of Education decision. Georgia Governor Marvin Griffin had privately given Dodd his support, but he surprised the campus and the state on Friday, December 2, 1955 by bowing to pressure from segregationists and sending a wire to the Georgia Board of Regents chairman, Robert O. Arnold, requesting not only that Tech not play the game, but that all University System of Georgia teams play only segregated games.|$|E
5|$|Florida State {{received}} {{the ball to}} begin the game, and returned the opening kickoff to its 19-yard line. In his opening drive, Seminoles quarterback Drew Weatherford completed several long passes, including a long 37-yard strike from his own 48-yard line to drive the Seminoles' offense inside the Virginia Tech red zone. Once there, however, the Florida State offense began to struggle with the Virginia Tech defense, which had recovered somewhat from the initial shock of Weatherford's offensive success. On the three plays that followed Weatherford's 37-yard pass, Florida State managed only six positive yards, but this total was largely negated by a five-yard false start penalty that pushed FSU's offense backward. Facing a fourth down, Florida State <b>coach</b> <b>Bobby</b> Bowden sent in kicker Gary Cismesia to attempt a 31-yard field goal. The kick was successful, and the three points gave Florida State an early 30 lead with 11:06 remaining in the quarter.|$|E
50|$|Miami Dolphins owner Wayne Huizenga quickly {{joined forces}} with bowl {{organizers}} and brought in Blockbuster Video, which he owned at the time, as title sponsor. The inaugural game, played on December 28, 1990, pitted Florida State and Penn State, and two legendary <b>coaches,</b> <b>Bobby</b> Bowden versus Joe Paterno in front of over 74,000 at Joe Robbie Stadium. Subsequent games, however, never matched {{the success of the}} first, even though the bowl was moved to the more prestigious New Year's Day slot starting in 1993.|$|R

In 1987, Thibodeau befriended Bill Musselman, a former head coach in the NBA, ABA and NCAA who was coaching the Albany Patroons of the Continental Basketball Association. According to the New York Times, [...] "the Patroons’ practices, the attention to detail, the efficiency, the sheer number of offensive sets, fed into Thibodeau’s addiction." ...|$|R
5|$|The {{publicity}} of Ryan White's story catapulted {{him into}} the national spotlight, amidst a growing wave of AIDS coverage in the news media. Between 1985 and 1987, the number of news stories about AIDS in the American media doubled. While isolated in middle school, White appeared frequently on national television and in newspapers to discuss his tribulations with the disease. Eventually, he became known as a poster child for the AIDS crisis, appearing in fundraising and educational campaigns for the syndrome. Ryan participated in numerous public benefits for children with AIDS. Many celebrities appeared with Ryan, starting during his trial and continuing {{for the rest of}} his life, to help publicly destigmatize socializing with people with AIDS. Singers John Cougar Mellencamp, Elton John and Michael Jackson, actor Matt Frewer, diver Greg Louganis, President Ronald Reagan and First Lady Nancy Reagan, Surgeon General Dr. C. Everett Koop, Indiana University basketball <b>coach</b> <b>Bobby</b> Knight and basketball player Kareem Abdul-Jabbar all befriended White. He also was a friend to many children with AIDS or other potentially debilitating conditions.|$|E
5|$|The {{week after}} the Miami game, the Seminoles had an even closer call against the Clemson Tigers—their closest, in fact, of the entire season. Despite the return of Peter Warrick, who was cleared of charges in a Florida courtroom, Florida State fell behind the Tigers in the first half. Trailing in Clemson, South Carolina, 143 at halftime, Florida State cut the gap to 146 with a field goal midway through the third quarter, then tied the game {{at the end of}} the third quarter with a {{touchdown}} and two-point conversion. The Seminoles clinched the victory after a field goal late in the fourth quarter gave them a 1714 lead and cemented the victory when a Clemson attempt to even the score with a field goal fell short. The victory was FSU head <b>coach</b> <b>Bobby</b> Bowden's 300thwin and came against his son, Tommy Bowden, coach of the Tigers.|$|E
5|$|Florida State {{began the}} fourth quarter in {{possession}} of the ball and facing a third down, needing three yards for a first down. Weinke completed a pass for {{just short of the}} needed three yards. Instead of punting the ball away, Florida State head <b>coach</b> <b>Bobby</b> Bowden ordered the team to attempt to convert the first down. He brought backup quarterback Marcus Outzen into the game as a misdirection move, and instead of running a quarterback sneak as anticipated, Outzen tossed the ball to Minor, who ran for 16yards and a first down. During the play, Virginia Tech committed a 15-yard personal foul penalty that advanced the ball further and gave Florida State a first down at the Virginia Tech 23-yard line. Weinke returned to the game and threw a 10-yard pass to Chaney for another first down. Weinke threw an incomplete pass, then Tech stopped a rush up the middle for no gain. On third down, Weinke connected on a touchdown pass to Dugans, returning the lead to Florida State. The Seminoles, as had Virginia Tech before them, elected to attempt a two-point conversion. Unlike Virginia Tech's failed two-point conversions, the Seminoles successfully earned two points with a pass to Warrick, and the scores gave Florida State a 3629 lead with 12:59 remaining.|$|E
