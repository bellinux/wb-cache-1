50|$|In November, 2012, NASA, the Russian Federal Space Agency (Roscosmos), {{and their}} {{international}} partners selected two veteran spacefarers for a one-year mission aboard the International Space Station in 2015. This mission included collecting scientific data important to future human exploration {{of our solar}} system. NASA selected Scott Kelly and Roscosmos chose Mikhail Kornienko. Kelly and Kornienko launched aboard a Russian Soyuz spacecraft from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan in March 2015 landed on March 1, 2016 at 22:00hr. Kelly and Kornienko already have a connection; Kelly was a backup crew member for the station's Expedition 23/24 crews, where Kornienko served as a flight engineer. The goal of their yearlong expedition aboard the orbiting laboratory was to understand better how the human body reacts and adapts to the harsh environment of space.

40|$|<b>Current</b> <b>assessment</b> {{practice}} and its models typically aspire {{to capture the}} considerable variety of airline pilots 2 ̆ 7 performance across highly specific behavioural markers and highly unspecific categories. Yet research {{into one of the}} most advanced assessment models has shown large disagreement among assessors in terms of both their scoring and reasoning. Rather than further attempts to eliminate this variety in assessors 2 ̆ 7 judgments, a deeper understanding is required of the source of disagreement. The aim of this study is to reflect on <b>current</b> <b>assessment</b> practice by considering opposing, yet complementary views of human error and safety. Considerable discrepancy is identified between the underlying assumptions of assessment {{practice and}} the precepts of advanced safety research. The shift that has occurred in safety thinking hardly seems to have penetrated assessment practice in aviation.

50|$|To aid {{financial}} institutions in their ongoing risk management practices, the supervisors have also {{put together an}} alternative “more adverse” scenario. By design, {{the path of the}} US economy in this alternative more adverse scenario reflects a deeper and longer recession than in the baseline. The consensus expectation is that economic activity is likely to be better than shown in the more adverse alternative; nonetheless, an outcome such as the alternative cannot be ruled out. The “more adverse” scenario was constructed from the historical track record of private forecasters as well as their <b>current</b> <b>assessments</b> of uncertainty. In particular, based on the historical accuracy of Blue Chip forecasts made since the late 1970s, the likelihood that the average unemployment rate in 2010 could be at least as high as in the alternative more adverse scenario is roughly 10 percent. In addition, the subjective probability assessments provided by participants in the January Consensus Forecasts survey and the February Survey of Professional Forecasters imply a roughly 15 percent chance that real GDP growth could be as least as low, and unemployment at least as high, as assumed in the more adverse scenario.|$|E

50|$|As this {{array of}} {{publications}} shows, Buber was a prolific writer; yet the scientific {{quality of his}} work does not suffer on this account, {{at least in the}} opinion of his contemporaries. (See below for <b>current</b> <b>assessments.)</b> At the outset he adopted a certain system to which he consistently adhered. For a determination of the reading of the text he availed himself of all accessible manuscripts and printed works—and everything is accessible to him, as he spared no expense in obtaining copies of manuscripts and the rarest printed editions; he conscientiously recorded the various readings in footnotes, and he bestowed special care, chiefly in the older midrashim, on the correction and explanation of words in the text borrowed from the Greek and the Latin. In the introductions, which almost assume the proportions of independent works (the introduction to the Tanchuma embraces 212 pages octavo), everything that bears upon the history of the work under consideration is discussed, and a compilation is given of the authors or works cited by the Midrash or serving as sources for it, and those that in turn have drawn upon the Midrash. His work is distinguished by thoroughness, and reveals his synthetic ability as well as the vast extent of his reading. The only serious opposition to the views encountered by Buber has been in regard to his theory concerning the Tanchuma.|$|E

40|$|The {{assessment}} of the clinical performance of physicians-in-training is an important task. The critical care rotation is a mandatory rotation for most residency training programs and is designed to ensure the graduation of trainees {{who are able to}} initiate lifesaving management during medical emergencies.
