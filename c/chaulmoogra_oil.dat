25|$|Starting in 1918, Dr. Cadbury treated lepers, {{who were}} outpatients in the Canton Hospital leprosy clinic, for one year. The Canton Hospital {{was the first}} to have an {{organized}} leprosy clinic in China. He injected these patients with a mixture of <b>chaulmoogra</b> <b>oil,</b> resorcin, and camphorated oil. Then, he reported the results in The China Medical Journal in 1920. He wrote:"We must state that the various remedies, as outlined above, while in most cases of leprosy they have definite therapeutic value, yet unless the patients are cared for in a sanatorium, given proper food, together with baths and attention to personal hygiene, a complete cure can hardly be looked for."In 1926, Dr. Cadbury tackled widespread issue of Chinese children not knowing their birth dates. He collected information from 1013 Cantonese children. His calculations to estimate the ages of these children revealed an understanding of the customs of the Canton people. For example, he learned that most of the children claimed they were born in August, September, and October most likely due to the tradition that Canton merchants were gone for most of the year except around Chinese New Year.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Chaulmoogra</b> <b>oil</b> had {{previously}} {{been used in the}} treatment of Hansen's disease (leprosy) with mixed results. [...] Most patients with Hansen's disease were hesitant to take the oil over the long term because it tasted bitter and tended to cause an upset stomach.|$|E
2500|$|Ball {{developed}} {{a process to}} isolate the ethyl esters of the fatty acids in the <b>chaulmoogra</b> <b>oil</b> {{so that they could}} be injected, but died before she could publish her results. [...] Arthur L. Dean, a chemist {{and the president of the}} University of Hawaii, continued her work, published the findings, and began producing large quantities of the injectable chaulmoogra extract. Dean published the findings without giving credit to Ball, and renamed the technique the Dean Method, until Hollmann spoke out about this. In 1918, a Hawaii physician reported in the Journal of the American Medical Association that a total of 78 patients were released from Kalihi Hospital by the board of health examiners after treatment with injections. The isolated ethyl ester remained the preferred treatment for Hansen's disease until sulfonamide drugs were developed in the 1940s.|$|E
50|$|In {{a medical}} journal {{published}} in 1892, the first advertisement of Okamura's <b>chaulmoogra</b> <b>oil</b> was found. It was registered in Japanese Pharmacopoeia. <b>Chaulmoogra</b> <b>oil</b> was produced later by Ministry of Welfare, {{but the quality}} of the oil was inferior to Okamura's oil. The efficacy of <b>chaulmoogra</b> <b>oil</b> for leprosy was studied in a special lecture in 1940 by Yutaka Kamikawa; it differed depending on sanatoriums from 30% to 80% and there were many recurrences. However, before promin was discovered in 1943 by Guy Henry Faget, <b>chaulmoogra</b> <b>oil</b> had been the only remedy known to be effective in this disease.|$|E

50|$|Review of {{treatments}} of leprosy, especially on <b>chaulmoogra</b> <b>oil.</b> He made a special lecture on this title at the 13th Congress of the JapaneseAssociation of Leprosy in 1939 at Sendai. His review included treatments of leprosy with gold, silver, cupper, arsenics, iodine, timol, pigments, nonspecific immune therapies, sulfon drugs, vitamine, bacterial toxins, serum therapies, nutritional therapies; especially <b>chaulmoogra</b> <b>oil.</b> On sulphon-amids, he tested Therapol (paraamino-benzolsulfon amid) {{and found it}} was effective in 55.6% (10 cases) out of 18 cases. However, he concluded that with Therapol only, the sulphon-amids could not be expected as treatment of leprosy. On <b>chaulmoogra</b> <b>oil,</b> he reported it was effective in 30% in the Kyushu Sanatorium (he studied it between 1919 and 1930) and in 56.6% in Formosa (data between 1930 and 1939), while Hayashi Y. reported that it was effective in 50-80% of cases in the Zenshoen Hospital, Tama Zenshoen Sanatorium. He concluded that <b>chaulmoogra</b> <b>oil</b> was the only hopeful treatment for patients whose leprosy was not severe, and the mechanism was the activation {{of the immune system}} by stimulating the reticulo-endothlial system or lymphatic system. This was also the conclusion of his reports for Ph.D. in 1930.|$|E
50|$|The {{effectiveness}} of <b>Chaulmoogra</b> <b>oil</b> brought other problems as well. People treated with <b>Chaulmoogra</b> <b>oil,</b> although {{free of the}} disease, suffered great physical mutilations caused by leprous sores. With the negative stigma of leprosy and unsightly sores, normal reintegration back into society after successful treatment became an almost impossible task. Authorities segregated {{part of the island}} where leprosy-free but badly mutilated patients could earn a living. Health-education, as proposed by the World Health Organization, was aimed to control this stigmatization.|$|E

50|$|Hydnocarpus is a genus {{of medium}} to large trees of Indochina, Indonesia, Malaysia and the Philippines, having {{alternate}} leaves, small dioecious racemose flowers, and capsular fruits of which several are sources of <b>chaulmoogra</b> <b>oil</b> and hydnocarpus oil.|$|E
50|$|While he was {{studying}} in Europe, he attended the first Congress of Leprosy in 1897 in Berlin. In 1912, he reported a review of treatments of leprosy; among various drugs, he recommended <b>chaulmoogra</b> <b>oil</b> based on his experience.|$|E
50|$|The use of <b>Chaulmoogra</b> <b>oil,</b> first {{demonstrated}} in a Louisiana leper Colony, became {{an effective way}} of treating the disease {{as a number of}} cases became negative after the first year. However, the treatment was very slow in improvement and recovery.|$|E

50|$|Heibei Okamura {{was born}} in Osaka in 1852, and his father went into the Okamura family. He married a girl of the Okamura family named Koteru. He was known in his city, Sakai, Osaka for being an amateur sumo wrestler, a tall height of 188 cm and for being a Japanese sword master. In 1888, he {{happened}} to save a miserable person with leprosy; he gave the patient a wash in a bathtub. Between 1888 and 1901, he cared for more than 1,000 leprosy patients in his house. He studied Chinese medicine and began to produce <b>chaulmoogra</b> <b>oil</b> probably in 1892, which was {{the year of the}} first advertisement. In 1944, the import of the materials of the oil discontinued, and the <b>chaulmoogra</b> <b>oil</b> age came to an end.|$|E
5000|$|... "Leprosy can be {{eliminated}} by this way" [...] was {{reported at the}} second leprosy meeting by Osaka Prefecture in 1929.

5000|$|He is {{credited}} with performing the first clinical and histological studies of juxta-articular nodes; structures associated with syphilis and yaws that are {{sometimes referred to as}} [...] "Jeanselme's nodules". or as [...] "Lutz-Jeanselme nodules", named in conjunction with Brazilian physician Adolfo Lutz. As a treatment for leprosy, he advocated a mixture of <b>chaulmoogra</b> <b>oil,</b> camphor and guaiacol.|$|E
50|$|The Okamura {{family had}} the {{technique}} of oil production, and since 1672, clove oil had been produced in the Okamura family. Clove oil had a variety of uses from Chinese medicine to the keeping of Japanese swords in good condition.

50|$|He also {{demonstrated}} that <b>chaulmoogra</b> <b>oil,</b> {{which at the}} time was thought to be an efficient treatment, was actually not beneficial, but harmful to the treatment of the disease. Instead, in 1944 he {{was the first one to}} use promin, as a treatment for leprosy in Mexico. He also made significant contributions for a disease called pinta, specifically about its diagnosis with early buds.|$|E
50|$|Piper also {{established}} the first leper treatment {{center in the}} area in 1932. He dedicated ten years to lobbying, drafting letters, and requesting for the Belgian authorities and the American Leprosy Mission to give them adequate funds for the land and buildings. With his assistants, Piper gave 32,000 injections of <b>Chaulmoogra</b> <b>oil</b> in one year. By 1940, the main clinic boasted of about 260 Hansen patients.|$|E
50|$|The first {{parenteral}} administration {{was given by}} the Egyptian doctor Tortoulis Bey, personal physician to the Sultan Hussein Kamel of Egypt. He had been using subcutaneous injections of creosote for tuberculosis. In 1894 he administered subcutaneous injection of <b>chaulmoogra</b> <b>oil</b> to a 36-year-old Egyptian Copt who {{had been unable to}} tolerate oral treatment. After 6 years and 584 injections, the patient was declared cured.|$|E
50|$|Under the appointment-ship of Governor General Leonard Wood, Culion {{continued}} {{to expand its}} staff and facilities and continued using <b>Chaulmoogra</b> <b>Oil</b> for treatment into the 1920s and 1930s. However, it was later shown that 46.4% of the patients discharged as negative subsequently relapsed. Therefore, sentiment began to grow in favor of decreasing the importance of Culion and in favor of modifications of the method of segregation in the islands.|$|E

50|$|A common pre-modern {{treatment}} of leprosy was <b>chaulmoogra</b> <b>oil.</b> The oil {{has long been}} used in India as an Ayurvedic medicine for the {{treatment of}} leprosy and various skin conditions. It has also been used in China and Burma. It was introduced to the West by Frederic John Mouat, a professor at Bengal Medical College. He tried the oil as an oral and topical agent in two cases of leprosy and reported significant improvements in an 1854 paper.|$|E
50|$|Leprosy has {{for some}} time been {{known to be a}} {{bacterial}} disease, with the result that <b>chaulmoogra</b> <b>oil</b> is no longer used in its treatment. Multidrug therapy (MDT), employing a number of antibacterial drugs, remains highly effective, and people are no longer infectious after the first monthly dose. It is safe and easy to use under field conditions due to its presentation in calendar blister packs. Relapse rates remain low, and no resistance to the combined drugs is seen.|$|E
50|$|As part of {{her work}} with lepers on the Ivory Coast she was {{instrumental}} in promoting and popularizing the use of chemotherapy for the cure of leprosy, by orally administering <b>chaulmoogra</b> <b>oil</b> which was extracted from the seed of a tropical plant.

50|$|Trees of {{the species}} that yield <b>Chaulmoogra</b> <b>oil</b> grow to a height of 12-15 m and in India trees bear fruits in August and September. The fruits are ovoid some 10 cm in {{diameter}} with a thick woody rind. Internally they contain 10-16 black seeds embedded in the fruit pulp. The seeds account for some 20% of the fruit weight. A typical tree produces 20 kg of seed/annum. The kernels make up 60−70% of the seed weight and contain 63% of pale yellow oil (mukherjee).|$|E
5000|$|The {{seeds of}} this plant have been {{confused}} with Hydnocarpus wightianus as the <b>chaulmoogra</b> <b>oil,</b> {{which is used}} in Indian medicine to treat several skin conditions and diseases. During British rule, several British doctors studied {{the use of this}} oil in the treatment of leprosy, lupus, scrofula, and many skin diseases. The oil was prescribed for leprosy as a mixture suspended in gum or as an emulsion. However, it has later been clarified that the actual chaulmoogra referred to in Sanskrit texts for the treatment of leprosy, as Tuvaraka [...] is actually Hydnocarpus wightianus.|$|E
50|$|He {{was born}} in Hiroshima Prefecture in 1892 and studied {{medicine}} at Nagasaki Medical School, Nagasaki University.

He intensively studied leprosy patients there. New patients were hospitalized but healed patients were discharged. In 1946 he returned to Japan but lost valuable data during repatriation. In 1947 he worked at Tohoku Shinseien Sanatorium and became its director in 1948. He retired in 1965.|$|E

50|$|Dr David William Johnson, the Medical Officer at Peel Island, visited Fantome in mid March 1940. He {{reported}} to Cilento that the diet was unsatisfactory {{for at least}} a month after arrival of the Peel Island patients, as the Palm Island authorities were unaware of importance of a good diet in the treatment of leprosy and poor weather prevented delivery of fresh produce. The 12 cows on Fantome Island were producing fresh milk for the lock hospital, but not the lazaret. Johnson also noted that Dr CA Courtney was not visiting Fantome Island regularly, partly owing to the weather, but he would visit weekly in future. However, Johnson noted that Courtney had no previous experience in leprosy, and further regular visits from medical officers were desirable. Tellingly, the standard Hansen's disease treatment of the time (<b>chaulmoogra</b> <b>oil)</b> had not been given to the patients since they left Peel Island.|$|E
