5|$|Allen {{played as}} the starter at right tackle {{in each of}} the Giants' three minicamps prior to the 2004 preseason, but {{incoming}} head <b>coach</b> <b>Tom</b> Coughlin moved right guard David Diehl to the right tackle position before the first preseason game. Allen was originally designated the primary backup at left and right tackle going into the 2004 season, but he was released after the Giants signed Marques Sullivan off waivers.|$|E
5|$|The Giants {{struggled}} in 2015, finishing 6-10 again {{and third in}} the NFC East due to the Giants defense blowing {{the lead in the}} final minutes in 6 of their 10 games. Despite their defensive struggles, Quarterback Eli Manning threw for a career-high 35 touchdown passes and also set career highs in attempts and completions. After the season, head <b>coach</b> <b>Tom</b> Coughlin resigned after 12 seasons.|$|E

5|$|NC State {{began the}} 1986 college {{football}} season coming off three consecutive losing seasons. Those losing seasons {{also resulted in}} the firing of head <b>coach</b> <b>Tom</b> Reed, who was replaced by Dick Sheridan. Sheridan's first game with the Wolfpack was at home against East Carolina on September 6. It was an auspicious beginning, as NC State won, 3810. After a 1414 tie the next week against Pittsburgh, the Wolfpack won their next two games: at home against Wake Forest, and in Maryland against Maryland.|$|E
5|$|The {{episode is}} the second of two to deal {{directly}} {{with the death of}} Hearst's basketball <b>coach,</b> <b>Tom</b> Barry (Matt McKenzie). In this installment, Veronica and Keith (Enrico Colantoni) search for Tom's missing son Josh (Jonathan Chase) while investigating a variety of alternate suspects. In addition, they continue to question Mindy O'Dell (Jaime Ray Newman) and Hank Landry (Patrick Fabian) with regards to the death of Dean Cyrus O'Dell. Meanwhile, Logan (Jason Dohring), Parker (Julie Gonzalo), Mac (Tina Majorino), and Bronson (Michael Mitchell) attend a scavenger hunt for Valentine's Day.|$|E
5|$|Fassel was {{replaced}} by current <b>coach</b> <b>Tom</b> Coughlin who has coached the team since 2004, also to inconsistent results and media scrutiny. The Giants acquired their current starting quarterback Eli Manning via a draft day trade from the San Diego Chargers. Manning had been the quarterback at University of Mississippi, {{and was the first}} pick in the 2004 NFL Draft. During this period standout Giants players include defensive end Michael Strahan, who set the NFL single season record in sacks in 2001, and running back Tiki Barber, who set a team record in rushing yards in 2005. The Giants made the playoffs four consecutive seasons, from 2005–2008 (including a Super Bowl victory during the 2007 season), but missed the playoffs in 2009 and 2010.|$|E

5|$|In July 1967, Taylor {{left the}} Packers for the {{expansion}} New Orleans Saints to play under head <b>coach</b> <b>Tom</b> Fears, a Hall of Fame receiver and a former assistant coach for five seasons in Green Bay under Lombardi. He was signed to four one-year contracts with the Saints, worth $68,000 for 1968 and $72,000 for each subsequent season. The Saints also signed Hornung, though he retired prior to the 1967 season. Taylor recorded his lowest rushing statistics since his rookie season, but was still relatively productive as a receiver, catching 38 passes. Prior to the 1968 season, he was relegated to special teams duties, {{and as a result}} he refused to play in that week's exhibition game. Taylor retired from pro football in September, at the end of training camp.|$|E
5|$|The 1972–73 saw {{upheaval}} at the Bruins. Coach Sinden {{became the}} general manager. Bruins players Gerry Cheevers, Derek Sanderson and Johnny McKenzie joined the upstart World Hockey Association. <b>Coach</b> <b>Tom</b> Johnson was fired fifty-two games into the season, replaced by Bep Guidolin, {{who had once}} coached Orr. The Adams family, which had owned the team {{since its founding in}} the 1920s, sold it to Storer Broadcasting. The Bruins' season came to a premature end in a first-round loss in the 1973 playoffs, losing Esposito to injury in that first round. Orr amassed 101 points during the regular season (he only played 63 games to due injury) but had only two points in the playoff loss.|$|E
5|$|The Cornhuskers' {{subsequent}} drive did {{not have}} the initial offensive explosion of Tech's drive, but it was in the end more successful. Benning rushed for five yards and Jeff Lake caught a 10-yard pass for a first down at the Nebraska 41-yard line. Frost then threw two incomplete passes and a nine-yard toss to Vershan Jackson. Facing fourth down and needing one yard, Nebraska head <b>coach</b> <b>Tom</b> Osborne elected to attempt to gain the yardage rather than punt the ball. Benning rushed for three yards, and Nebraska was able to convert the fourth down into another first down. Benning followed that success with another, breaking loose for a 33-yard run and the first touchdown of the second half. The extra point was good, and Nebraska extended its lead to 2414 with 4:58 remaining in the quarter.|$|E

5|$|As {{the players}} took {{the field for}} the second half, D.C. <b>coach</b> <b>Tom</b> Soehn decided to replace Fred, who had been a non-factor in the first half, with Santino Quaranta. In the 60th minute, Gomez, Pontius and Luciano Emilio {{combined}} inside Seattle's 18-yard box for a United opportunity, but Pontius mishit the shot, which resulted in an easy save for Seattle's goalkeeper, Kasey Keller. Seven minutes later, another failed D.C. United opportunity resulted in a Sounders FC counterattack, where Freddie Ljungberg's shot was saved by Wicks. The rebound rolled in front of Fredy Montero, who dove feet first and kicked the ball into the goal, giving Sounders FC a 1–0 lead. Following the goal, frustrated D.C. United goalkeeper Josh Wicks stomped on Montero's leg while he was still on the ground. After consulting with the fourth official, referee Alex Prus showed Wicks a red card for his behavior, dismissing him from the match. United's backup goalkeeper, Milos Kocic, was substituted for Christian Gomez after the incident, and D.C. played with 10 men {{for the remainder of the}} match.|$|E
5|$|The British {{wheelchair}} curling {{team was}} made up of Frank Duffy the skip, Ken Dickson, Tom Killin, Angie Malone and Michael McCreadie. This was the same team that had won the World Championships in January 2005 in Glasgow, all but Killin had also won the 2004 World Championships, and many considered them strong contenders for a medal. Although {{this was the first time}} wheelchair curling had been included as a Paralympic sport the team did have previous Games experience. Michael McCreadie, who made his first Paralympics appearance in 1972, was competing in his sixth Paralympics and had previously won two bronze medals for Lawn Bowls in the 1976 Summer Paralympics. Tom Killin was a previous silver medallist in wheelchair fencing at the 1980 Summer Games. The team received the same preparation as Great Britain's Olympic Curlers; funding came from the National Lottery as well as the Scottish Institute of Sport. The team's <b>coach,</b> <b>Tom</b> Pendreigh, was also personal coach of the men's Olympic skip David Murdoch.|$|E
5|$|The Hearst {{basketball}} <b>coach,</b> <b>Tom</b> Barry, berates his team, including Wallace (Percy Daggs III), after a game, and the coach's son quits as a result. One of Logan's teachers tells Dick that Logan {{must start}} attending classes. Dick sneaks into Logan's apartment for the hotel staff and finds it a mess. Veronica works at Mars Investigations {{for the day}} and walks in to find the Coach's family in the office, as the Coach has died. The son who quit, Josh, is the prime suspect, but the family suspects Mel Stolz (Jeremy Roberts) or one of the PCH bikers. Dick tries to set up Logan on a double date before realizing that one of the “twins” is actually eleven years old. Dick and the older sister leave, leading Logan to babysit the other sister, Heather (Juliette Goglia) although Logan just goes to bed. Keith talks to Mel Stolz, who says that he was on a plane at the time. Dick calls Logan and says he is in Las Vegas, leaving Logan to babysit Heather for another day.|$|E

5|$|After a brief search, Ernie Accorsi hired former Jacksonville Jaguars <b>coach</b> <b>Tom</b> Coughlin {{to be the}} Giants' head coach. Coughlin was {{considered}} a disciplinarian, {{in contrast to the}} departed Fassel, whose lenient style was criticized in his final years with the club. Accorsi coveted quarterback Eli Manning, brother of Peyton and son of Archie, in the 2004 NFL Draft. Manning had indicated before the draft {{that he did not want}} to play for the San Diego Chargers, who held the top pick. The Chargers drafted him nonetheless, and then traded him to the Giants for their first round picks in 2004 and 2005. The Giants released Kerry Collins, who was unhappy with a backup role, and signed veteran quarterback Kurt Warner. The plan was for Warner to be the starter, while the team groomed Manning to ultimately take over the job. After losing to the Eagles in the 2004 season opener, the Giants, with Warner at quarterback, won five of their next six games, making them 5–2. After losing two close games, to the Bears and Cardinals, to drop to 5–4, Coughlin announced that Manning would start the rest of the season. Manning struggled, and the Giants did not score more than 14 points in their next four games. He performed better later in the season, but the Giants finished the season 6–10. Barber established a career-high in rushing with 1,518yards. He also had 52 catches and a total of 15 touchdowns.|$|E
5|$|During {{his second}} NHL season, Eberle {{sustained}} a sprained knee after colliding with Dallas Stars forward Jamie Benn {{during a game}} on January 7, 2012. At {{the time of the}} injury, Eberle was among the league's top scorers and six points behind the league's leader. Despite his success, he was left off the 2012 NHL All-Star Game roster, which was selected while he was sidelined. Several members within the Oilers organization were outspoken regarding the omission, including captain Shawn Horcoff and Head <b>Coach</b> <b>Tom</b> Renney, to which the League replied that Eberle would have been selected had he not been injured. By January 19, Eberle returned to the Oilers line-up after missing four games. Five days later, he was nonetheless named as an All-Star replacement for the injured Mikko Koivu. Eberle was selected to Team Chara as part of the All-Star Fantasy Draft and went on to record an assist in the squad's 12–9 win against Team Alfredsson. The following month, Eberle recorded his 100th career NHL point on February 21, 2012, with a goal and two assists in a 6–1 victory over the Calgary Flames. He finished his second NHL season leading with a team-leading 34 goals, 42 assists and 76 points. Among league scorers, he ranked 16th in goals and points. The Oilers continued to struggle as a team, however, and finished 14th in the Western Conference with 32 wins and 74 points.|$|E
5|$|Formed in 1891, the storied Varsity Blues men's {{ice hockey}} team has left many {{legacies}} on the national, professional and international hockey scenes. Conn Smythe {{played for the}} Blues as a centre during his undergraduate years, and was a Blues coach from 1923 to 1926. When Smythe took over the Toronto Maple Leafs in 1927, his new team adopted the Varsity Blue's familiar blue-and-white sweater design. Blues hockey competed at the 1928 Winter Olympics and captured the gold medal for Canada. At the 1980 Winter Olympics, Blues <b>coach</b> <b>Tom</b> Watt served as co-coach of the Canadian hockey team in which six players were Varsity grads. In all, the Blues have won the U Sports University Cup national hockey title ten times, last in 1984. Varsity Arena has been the permanent home of the Blues ice hockey programs since it opened in 1926. In men's basketball, the Varsity Blues have won 14 conference titles, including the inaugural championship in 1909, but have not won a national title. In swimming, the men's team has claimed the national crown 16 times since 1964, while the women's team has claimed the crown 14 times since 1970. Established in 1897, the University of Toronto Rowing Club is Canada's oldest collegiate rowing club. It earned a silver medal for {{the country in the}} 1924 Summer Olympics, finishing second to Yale's crew.|$|E
