Keys <b>Attachment</b> <b>Centre</b> provides therapy for people diagnosed as suffering from attachment disorder. Its aims are to provide "an inclusive therapeutic service within a safe secure residential living environment" for people whose early traumatic life experiences have impacted on their ability to form positive reciprocal relationships...|$|R
40|$|Final {{report of}} this project whose aims were to {{describe}} and evaluate experiences and perceptions of social and psychotherapeutic provision (including outcomes) offered by Keys <b>Attachment</b> <b>Centre.</b> Keys <b>Attachment</b> <b>Centre</b> provides therapy for people diagnosed as suffering from Attachment disorder. Its aims are to provide "an inclusive therapeutic service within a safe secure residential living environment" for people whose early traumatic life experiences have impacted {{on their ability to}} form positive reciprocal relationships. Therapies for children and young people using ‘holding’ as an intervention (as Keys does) for severe difficulties with attachments are controversial. The views of a range of stakeholders (including children, young adults who had previously used the service, purchasers, outside professionals, and staff) about this service were collated directly by interview. This limited study, as reported subsequently in the peer-reviewed research paper by the investigators (Sudbery, Shardlow, Huntington, 2009), can refine the broader debates surrounding the therapeutic approach used by the service. Proponents argue that the service offered provides effective assistance for some of the most hurt and difficult children in society. Opponents state that some of the techniques involved have not been evaluated, are ethically questionable and are not based on a validated theoretical mechanism. The research design does not allow for a formal evaluation of effectiveness. With these cautions,however, the evaluative material in the study is clearly predominantly positive, with only small ‘outlier’ responses in some sections identifying the negative indicators. The results are in the researchers’ views more positive than would be reasonably predicted about welfare or therapeutic interventions by experienced worker...|$|R

AIM: Determining {{the center of}} insertion of the anterior cruciate ligament on the anterior intercondylar area relate to anterior and medial edge of {{the upper end of}} tibia. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The messurement has been done on 102 tibia. We measured distance from the center of ACL to anterior and medial edge of the uper part of tibia, and the lenght and the width of the tibial insetion. Also, we showed the procentual ratio these distances with medio-lateral and anteroposterior diametar of upper tibial part. RESULTS: The distance between the <b>centre</b> of <b>attachment</b> and medial edge is at 39 % from entire latero-medial diametar, while the distance from anterior edge is at 31 % from entire anterioposterior diametar. The possitive correlation between the distance of centar of the anterior cruciate ligament from anterior and inner edge (r= 0. 366, p) was found. CONCLUSION: The center of the attachment of the ACL at anterior intercondylarl area is at 1 / 3 of antero-posterial diametar behind the anterior edge of the upper part of tibia and 2 / 5 of latero-medial diametar inside from the medial edge...|$|R
40|$|The {{anterior}} cruciate ligament (ACL) consists of an anteromedial bundle (AMB) and a posterolateral bundle (PLB). A reconstruction restoring the functional two-bundled nature {{should be able to}} approximate normal ACL function better than the most commonly used single-bundle reconstructions. Accurate tunnel positioning is important, but difficult. The {{purpose of this study was}} to provide a geometric description of the <b>centre</b> of the <b>attachments</b> relative to arthroscopically visible landmarks. The AMB and PLB attachment sites in 35 dissected cadaver knees were measured with a 3 D system, as were anatomical landmarks of femur and tibia. At the femur, the mean ACL centre is positioned 7. 9  ±  1. 4  mm (mean ±  1 SD) shallow, along the notch roof, from the most lateral over-the-top position at the posterior edge of the intercondylar notch and from that point 4. 0  ±  1. 3  mm from the notch roof, low on the surface of the lateral condyle wall. The mean AMB centre is at 7. 2  ±  1. 8 and 1. 4  ±  1. 7  mm, and the mean PLB centre at 8. 8  ±  1. 6 and 6. 7  ±  2. 0  mm. At the tibia, the mean ACL centre is positioned 5. 1  ±  1. 7  mm lateral of the medial tibial spine and from that point 9. 8  ±  2. 1  mm anterior. The mean AMB centre is at 3. 0  ±  1. 6 and 9. 4  ±  2. 2  mm, and the mean PLB centre at 7. 2  ±  1. 8 and 10. 1  ±  2. 1  mm. The ACL attachment geometry is well defined relative to arthroscopically visible landmarks with respect to the AMB and PLB. With simple guidelines for the surgeon, the <b>attachments</b> <b>centres</b> can be found during arthroscopic single-bundle or double-bundle reconstructions...|$|R
40|$|This is {{a unique}} review because, while the Review was {{commissioned}} and managed by the Board of ILRI, TAC collaborated closely with ILRI in developing the terms of reference and {{in the selection of}} the Panel Chair and Members. This was possible because of TAC's own plan to undertake an external review of this Systemwide Programme. The review report was presented to the Board and Management of ILRI who, in association with other participating centres, prepared a written response. The Report of the Panel is accompanied by two attachments. The first contains the TAC commentary, which summarizes TAC's views on the Panel Report and on the Response of ILRI and the SLP participating <b>centres.</b> The second <b>attachment</b> is the Response of ILRI and the SLP participating centres to the Panel Report. The Committee believes that this Review model offers a promising alternative for more efficiently managing and effectively evaluating systemwide programmes and perhaps even other cross-centre activities...|$|R

40|$|In {{a recent}} article, Allen Schore (2002) {{reviewed}} the existing research literature concerning attachment, stress, trauma, physiology, and neuroscience. Schore investigated {{the connection between}} early attachment relationships and their effects on the infant’s developing brain and nervous system within {{the first two years}} of life. This paper is a partial summary of Schore’s article and focuses on secure and traumatizing attachment relationships. It is very important for an infant to form a secure attachment relationship with its caregivers. These bonds are crucial because the infant is dependant upon caregivers for everything related to survival such as nutrients, warmth, and protection. Recent studies have shown that early attachment relationships are strongly connected to the development of critical structures in the brain responsible for emotion regulation, attachment behaviour, and stress related coping mechanisms. The brain system responsible for instinctive attachment behaviour is located in the right orbitofrontal cortex, the outer layer of the brain behind the right eye. We will refer to this brain system and its connections as the <b>attachment</b> <b>centre.</b> The fact that th...|$|R

5000|$|The {{territory}} that was indisputably Darug Boorooberongal-Warmuli (Darug Lore) was the Cumberland Plain in western Sydney, {{that stretches from}} Wisemans Ferry in the north down to around Camden in the south.

[...] A strong <b>centre</b> of cultural <b>attachment</b> for the Darug people has been the [...] "Blacks Town" [...] (at the modern suburb of Colebee) in the Blacktown local government area (formerly Blacktown Shire).

But temper stepped between. Whether it began from Theodora's jealousy of the stranger, or from his annoyance at her cold haughty manner to his wife, he was vexed, and retaliated by teasing; she answered coldly, in proud suffering at being taunted on a subject which gave her much pain, and then was keenly hurt at his tone and way of leaving her, though in fact she was driving him away. She stood leaning against a pillar in the hall, looking after him with eyes brimming with tears; but on hearing a step approach, she subdued all signs of emotion, and composedly met the eye of her eldest brother. She could not brook that any one should see her grief, and she was in no mood for his first sentences: 'What are you looking at?' and seeing the pair standing by the fountain, 'Well, you don't think I said too much in her favour?' ...|$|R
