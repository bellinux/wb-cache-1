5000|$|As a {{substitute}} <b>for</b> <b>petrol,</b> TVO was developed. Paraffin (kerosene) was commonly {{used as a}} domestic heating fuel and was untaxed. Paraffin has a low octane rating and would damage an engine built <b>for</b> <b>petrol.</b> The manufacture of paraffin involves the removal of aromatic hydrocarbons from what is now sold as heating oil. These aromatics have an octane rating, so adding some of that otherwise waste product material back {{in a controlled manner}} into paraffin gave TVO. The resulting octane rating of TVO was somewhere between 55 and 70.|$|R

3000|$|... ‘There is {{a lesser}} degree of {{environmental}} cost coverage for diesel than <b>for</b> <b>petrol</b> because the current requirements for nitrogen oxide emissions per kilometre for new diesel cars are significantly less stringent than those <b>for</b> <b>petrol</b> cars. Diesel engines also emit significantly higher amounts of particulates than petrol engines. On the other hand, diesel cars emit significantly less CO 2 km− 1 because of their lower fuel consumption than petrol cars. Therefore, according to criteria {{used to assess the}} impact on the environment (gas and particulate emissions, noise), there would be no reason for taxing differently diesel fuel and petrol consumed by passenger vehicles. A reasonable balance would mean both being taxed at broadly similar rates’[111].|$|R
40|$|A fleet fuel {{consumption}} model for commercial vans and small trucks is developed {{based on a}} survey, completed by truck drivers in {{the normal course of}} their duty. The model uses engine displacement, vehicle mass and average speed to predict {{fuel consumption}} <b>for</b> <b>petrol</b> and diesel trucks. It explains 77. 4 % of the variance for diesel and 86. 3 % <b>for</b> <b>petrol</b> trucks respectively, with the mass term dominating the regression. The model was found to predict within 1 - 20 % of the actual fuel consumed by three instrumented trucks undergoing a controlled series of tests. As a fleet model, it represents an inexpensive and simple tool for monitoring vehicle and traffic changes...|$|R
40|$|Total {{deposition}} of petrol, diesel and {{environmental tobacco smoke}} (ETS) aerosols in the human respiratory tract for nasal breathing conditions was computed for 14 nonsmoking volunteers, considering the specific anatomical and respiratory parameters of each volunteer and the specific size distribution for each inhalation experiment. Theoretical predictions were 34. 6 % <b>for</b> <b>petrol,</b> 24. 0 % for diesel, and 18. 5 % for ETS particles. Compared to the experimental results, predicted deposition values were consistently smaller than the measured data (41. 4 % <b>for</b> <b>petrol,</b> 29. 6 % for diesel, and 36. 2 % for ETS particles). The apparent discrepancy between experimental data on total deposition and modeling results may be reconciled by considering the non-spherical shape of the test aerosols by diameter-dependent dynamic shape factors to account for differences between mobility-equivalent and volume-equivalent or thermodynamic diameters. While the application of dynamic shape factors is able to explain the observed differences <b>for</b> <b>petrol</b> and diesel particles, additional mechanisms may be required for ETS particle deposition, such as the size reduction upon inspiration by evaporation of volatile compounds and/or condensation-induced restructuring, and, possibly, electrical charge effects...|$|R
