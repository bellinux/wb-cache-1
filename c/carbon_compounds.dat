5|$|Bacteriophages are {{viruses that}} infect {{bacteria}} and archaea. The International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses officially recognises 28 genera of bacteriophages {{that belong to}} 11 families. They are important in marine ecology: as the infected bacteria burst, <b>carbon</b> <b>compounds</b> are released back into the environment, which stimulates fresh organic growth. Bacteriophages are useful in scientific research because they are harmless to humans and can be studied easily. These viruses {{can be a problem}} in industries that produce food and drugs by fermentation and depend on healthy bacteria. Some bacterial infections are becoming difficult to control with antibiotics, so there is a growing interest in the use of bacteriophages to treat infections in humans.|$|E
50|$|This {{term was}} {{proposed}} by B.Davis in 1961 to emphasise the dual metabolic role of such pathway. The citric acid cycle (The Krebs Cycle) {{is a good}} example of amphibolic pathway. The first reaction of the cycle, in which oxaloacetate (a four <b>carbon</b> <b>compound)</b> condenses with acetate (a two <b>carbon</b> <b>compound)</b> to form citrate (a six <b>carbon</b> <b>compound)</b> is typically anabolic. The next few reactions, which are intramolecular rearrangements, produce isocitrate. The following two reactions are typically catabolic. COO is lost in each step and succinate (a four <b>carbon</b> <b>compound)</b> is produced.|$|R

5|$|Carbon {{metabolism}} in bacteria {{is either}} heterotrophic, where organic <b>carbon</b> <b>compounds</b> {{are used as}} carbon sources, or autotrophic, meaning that cellular carbon is obtained by fixing carbon dioxide. Heterotrophic bacteria include parasitic types. Typical autotrophic bacteria are phototrophic cyanobacteria, green sulfur-bacteria and some purple bacteria, but also many chemolithotrophic species, such as nitrifying or sulfur-oxidising bacteria. Energy metabolism of bacteria is either based on phototrophy, the use of light through photosynthesis, or based on chemotrophy, the use of chemical substances for energy, which are mostly oxidised {{at the expense of}} oxygen or alternative electron acceptors (aerobic/anaerobic respiration).|$|E
5|$|Plant {{physiology}} encompasses all {{the internal}} chemical and physical activities of plants associated with life. Chemicals {{obtained from the}} air, soil and water {{form the basis of}} all plant metabolism. The energy of sunlight, captured by oxygenic photosynthesis and released by cellular respiration, is the basis of almost all life. Photoautotrophs, including all green plants, algae and cyanobacteria gather energy directly from sunlight by photosynthesis. Heterotrophs including all animals, all fungi, all completely parasitic plants, and non-photosynthetic bacteria take in organic molecules produced by photoautotrophs and respire them or use them in the construction of cells and tissues. Respiration is the oxidation of <b>carbon</b> <b>compounds</b> by breaking them down into simpler structures to release the energy they contain, essentially the opposite of photosynthesis.|$|E
5|$|The {{chemistry}} of silicon is generally nonmetallic (covalent) in nature. It {{is not known}} to form a cation. Silicon can form alloys with metals such as iron and copper. It shows fewer tendencies to anionic behaviour than ordinary nonmetals. Its solution chemistry is characterised by the formation of oxyanions. The high strength of the silicon-oxygen bond dominates the chemical behaviour of silicon. Polymeric silicates, built up by tetrahedral SiO4 units sharing their oxygen atoms, are the most abundant and important compounds of silicon. The polymeric borates, comprising linked trigonal and tetrahedral BO3 or BO4 units, are built on similar structural principles. The oxide SiO2 is polymeric in structure, weakly acidic, and a glass former. Traditional organometallic chemistry includes the <b>carbon</b> <b>compounds</b> of silicon (see organosilicon).|$|E

5|$|Carbon {{black is}} used as the black pigment in {{printing}} ink, artist's oil paint and water colours, carbon paper, automotive finishes, India ink and laser printer toner.

Carbon is used in chemical reduction at high temperatures. Coke is used to reduce iron ore into iron (smelting).

25|$|Part of Pauling's work on {{the nature}} of the {{chemical}} bond led to his introduction of the concept of orbital hybridization. While it is normal to think of the electrons in an atom as being described by orbitals of types such as s and p, it turns out that in describing the bonding in molecules, it is better to construct functions that partake of some of the properties of each. Thus the one 2s and three 2p orbitals in a carbon atom can be (mathematically) 'mixed' or combined to make four equivalent orbitals (called sp3 hybrid orbitals), which would be the appropriate orbitals to describe <b>carbon</b> <b>compounds</b> such as methane, or the 2s orbital may be combined with two of the 2p orbitals to make three equivalent orbitals (called sp2 hybrid orbitals), with the remaining 2p orbital unhybridized, which would be the appropriate orbitals to describe certain unsaturated <b>carbon</b> <b>compounds</b> such as ethylene. Other hybridization schemes are also found in other types of molecules.|$|E
25|$|Vegetation, in some regions, emits {{environmentally}} {{significant amounts}} of Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) on warmer days.

25|$|The {{synthesis}} of bacterial cellulose is a multistep process that involve two main mechanisms: the {{synthesis of}} uridine diphosphoglucose (UDPGIc), followed by the polymerization of glucose into long and unbranched chains (the Î²-1â†’4 glucan chain). Specifics on the cellulose synthesis has been extensively documented. The former mechanism is well known while the latter still needs exploring. The production of UDPGIc starts with <b>carbon</b> <b>compounds</b> (such as hexoses, glycerol, dihydroxyacetone, pyruvate, and dicarboxylic acids) entering the Krebs cycle, gluconeogenesis, or the pentose phosphate cycle depending on what carbon source is available. It then goes through phosphorylation along with catalysis, followed by isomerization of the intermediate, and {{a process known as}} UDPGIc pyrophosphorylase to convert the compounds into UDPGIc, a precursor to the production of cellulose. The polymerization of glucose into the Î²-1â†’4 glucan chain has been hypothesized to either involve a lipid intermediate or not to involve a lipid intermediate, though structural enzymology studies and in vitro experiments indicate that polymerization can occur by direct enzymatic transfer of a glucosyl moiety from a nucleotide sugar to the growing polysaccharide. A. xylinum usually converts <b>carbon</b> <b>compounds</b> into cellulose with around 50% efficiency.|$|E
