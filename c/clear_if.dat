5|$|In both The Moving Picture World and The Moving Picture News the {{character}} of Will was named Bill, {{but it is not}} <b>clear</b> <b>if</b> this was intentional, a renaming or error.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} objects (observed by Cassini) {{have not}} been confirmed as solid bodies. It is not yet <b>clear</b> <b>if</b> these are real satellites or merely persistent clumps within the F Ring.|$|E
5|$|Sarah was {{a hairdresser}} in Tottenham {{when she died}} in 2015. Before she met Amin, she was living with a boyfriend, Jesse Gitta; he {{vanished}} {{and it is not}} <b>clear</b> <b>if</b> he was beheaded, or detained after fleeing to Kenya.|$|E

50|$|Defensive rebounds must be <b>cleared</b> <b>if</b> {{the ball}} touched the rim. If the ball did {{not touch the}} rim, {{defensive}} rebounds {{do not need to}} be cleared.|$|R
50|$|Match Means <b>Clear</b> - <b>If</b> {{a player}} {{can match the}} current active play, the trick is <b>cleared.</b> For instance, <b>if</b> a 7 is played, one can play a 7 {{on top of this}} to <b>clear.</b> Or, <b>if</b> two Kings are played, one can play two Kings to clear. This is {{sometimes}} known as the Grand Palace Rule.|$|R
5|$|The vulcanoids are a {{hypothetical}} population of asteroids that orbit the Sun in a dynamically stable zone inside {{the orbit of}} the planet Mercury. They are named after the hypothetical planet Vulcan, whose existence was disproven in 1915. So far, no vulcanoids have been discovered, {{and it is not}} yet <b>clear</b> <b>if</b> any exist.|$|E
5|$|Zeno's paradoxes, {{particularly}} {{the paradox of}} the runner, are reminiscent of the apparent paradox that 0.999... and 1 are equal. The runner paradox can be mathematically modelled and then, like 0.999..., resolved using a geometric series. However, it is not <b>clear</b> <b>if</b> this mathematical treatment addresses the underlying metaphysical issues Zeno was exploring.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} other factors are less closely linked to COPD. The risk is greater in those who are poor, {{although}} it is not <b>clear</b> <b>if</b> this is due to poverty itself or other risk factors associated with poverty, such as air pollution and malnutrition. There is tentative evidence that those with asthma and airway hyperreactivity are at increased risk of COPD. Birth factors such as low birth weight may also play a role as do a number of infectious diseases including HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis. Respiratory infections such as pneumonia do not appear to increase the risk of COPD, at least in adults.|$|E
50|$|The wordplay of three-peat is <b>clearer</b> <b>if</b> repeat is {{stressed}} on {{the first}} syllable; this pronunciation is uncommon outside North America. Other English-speaking people may instead talk of a hat trick of championships, or simply a three-in-a-row.|$|R
5000|$|But both (a) and (b) are untrue—they {{contradict}} (i). In fact, (ii) and (iii) don't {{provide enough}} information to use Bayesian reasoning to reach those conclusions. That might be <b>clearer</b> <b>if</b> (i)-(iii) had instead been stated like so: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, Mr. Holmes, I {{admit that}} {{what you say is}} interesting: it's more than interesting--it's just wonderful. But let us have it a little <b>clearer</b> <b>if</b> you can. Is it forgery, coining, burglary--where does the money come from?" ...|$|R
5|$|At {{the time}} of the Spanish Conquest, the main Mam {{population}} was situated in Xinabahul (also spelled Chinabjul), now the city of Huehuetenango. They retreated to Zaculeu as a refuge during the Spanish attacks because of its fortifications. The refuge was attacked by Gonzalo de Alvarado y Contreras, brother of conquistador Pedro de Alvarado, in 1525, with 120 soldiers, and some 2,000 Mexican and K'iche' allies. The city was defended by Kayb'il B'alam commanding some 5,000 people (the chronicles are not <b>clear</b> <b>if</b> this is the number of soldiers or the total population of Zaculeu).|$|E
5|$|Avoidance therapy {{consists}} of minimizing or eliminating triggers. For example, {{in those who}} are sensitive to light, using a small television, avoiding video games, or wearing dark glasses may be useful. Operant-based biofeedback based on the EEG waves has some support in {{those who do not}} respond to medications. Psychological methods should not, however, be used to replace medications. Some dogs, commonly referred to as seizure dogs, may help during or after a seizure. It is not <b>clear</b> <b>if</b> dogs have the ability to predict seizures before they occur.|$|E
5|$|By contrast, a bottlenose's {{sense of}} smell is poor, because its blowhole, the {{analogue}} to the nose, is closed when underwater and it opens only for breathing. It has no olfactory nerves or olfactory lobe in the brain. Bottlenose dolphins are able to detect salty, sweet, bitter (quinine sulphate), and sour (citric acid) tastes, but {{this has not been}} well-studied. Anecdotally, some individuals in captivity have been noted to have preferences for food fish types, although it is not <b>clear</b> <b>if</b> taste mediates this preference.|$|E
50|$|Lastly, {{the channel}} should become free to take new calls when the {{previous}} call <b>clears.</b> <b>If</b> {{there was no}} indication of the call's disconnect, thus no teardown or clearing then all channels in the system would eventually be blocked.|$|R
5000|$|For example, the {{expression}} [...] may be <b>clearer</b> <b>if</b> written [...] (even though they mean {{exactly the same}} thing formally). The subtraction expression [...] is a different expression that doesn't represent the same operations, but it evaluates to the same result.|$|R
30|$|We are {{sorry for}} Mill (1823) but there can {{absolutely}} be ‘noxious’ K; not all K {{is by definition}} good for humans, as he claims. This is even <b>clearer</b> <b>if</b> the parameter is not our “good” but our subjective “happiness” (not the same!).|$|R
5|$|Hazelwood's driver's license {{had been}} {{suspended}} or revoked three {{times by the}} state of New York for alcohol violations since 1984. At the time of the Exxon Valdez incident, his New York state driving privileges were suspended {{as a result of a}} driving under the influence arrest on September 13, 1988. He entered a rehabilitation program in 1985 at South Oaks Hospital in Amityville, New York. Following rehabilitation he received 90 days of leave to attend Alcoholics Anonymous, but it is not <b>clear</b> <b>if</b> he attended during that leave.|$|E
5|$|In 796 or 797 the Welsh engaged Mercian {{forces at}} Rhuddlan. By 798 Coenwulf {{was in a}} {{position}} to invade in return, killing Caradog ap Meirion, the King of Gwynedd. A civil war in Gwynedd in the 810s ended with the succession of Hywel ap Caradog in 816 or 817, and Coenwulf invaded again, this time ravaging Snowdonia and taking control of Rhufuniog, a small Welsh territory near Rhos. It is not <b>clear</b> <b>if</b> the Mercians were involved in a battle recorded in Anglesey in 817 or 818, but the following year Coenwulf and his army devastated Dyfed.|$|E
5|$|In another {{stable isotope}} analysis, {{half of the}} Beringian wolves {{were found to be}} muskox and caribou specialists, and the other half were either horse and bison specialists or generalists. Two wolves from the full-glacial period (23,000–18,000 YBP) were found to be mammoth specialists, but it is not <b>clear</b> <b>if</b> this was due to {{scavenging}} or predation. The analysis of other carnivore fossils from the Fairbanks region of Alaska found that mammoth was rare in the diets of the other Beringian carnivores.|$|E
50|$|CLI <b>clears</b> <b>IF</b> (sets to 0), while STI sets IF to 1. POPF pops 16 bits off {{the stack}} into the FLAGS register, which means IF {{will be set}} or cleared based on the ninth bit {{on the top of}} the stack.|$|R
5000|$|For {{returning}} multiple {{values from}} a function, an {{alternative is to}} return a tuple. Syntactically this is <b>clearer</b> <b>if</b> automatic sequence unpacking and parallel assignment can be used, as in Go or Python, such as:def f (...) : return 1, 2a, b = f (...) ...|$|R

5|$|Jænberht (died 792) was {{a medieval}} monk, {{and later the}} abbot, of St Augustine's Abbey, Canterbury who was named Archbishop of Canterbury in 765. As archbishop, he had a {{difficult}} relationship with King Offa of Mercia, who at one point confiscated lands from the archbishopric. By 787, some of the bishoprics under Canterbury's supervision were transferred to {{the control of the}} newly created Archbishopric of Lichfield, although it is not <b>clear</b> <b>if</b> Jænberht ever recognised its legitimacy. Besides the issue with Lichfield, Jænberht also presided over church councils in England. He died in 792 and was considered a saint after his death.|$|E
5|$|Maximus {{is one of}} {{the last}} men to be {{recognized}} by both the Orthodox and Catholic Churches as a Father of the Church. In the encyclical Spe Salvi (2007), Pope Benedict XVI called Maximus 'the great Greek doctor of the Church', although it's not <b>clear</b> <b>if</b> the Pontiff intended to nominate Maximus 'Doctor of the Church' or to say that he already was one.|$|E
5|$|The bottom line, {{with the}} signing of the treaty, was that any capital ships under {{construction}} by the five signatories (the United States, Great Britain, France, Italy and Japan) had to be canceled and scrapped. For battlecruisers, this encompassed the United States Lexington class, Japan's , and Great Britain's G3 battlecruisers. For the U.S. Navy, the choice seemed <b>clear.</b> <b>If</b> it scrapped all six Lexingtons in accordance with the treaty, it would throw away $13.4 million that could otherwise go toward aircraft carriers. The Navy opted for the latter course.|$|E
60|$|This bit of {{cross-examination}} {{had caused}} great excitement in court. The {{heads of the}} many fashionably attired women present were busily laid together, and their whispers became so loud that the judge angrily threatened to have the court <b>cleared</b> <b>if</b> there was not immediate silence.|$|R
50|$|A DCR is the {{treatment}} of choice for most patients with acquired NLD obstruction. Surgical indications include recurrent dacryocystitis, chronic mucoid reflux, painful distension of the lacrimal sac, and bothersome epiphora. For patients with dacryocystitis, active infection should be <b>cleared,</b> <b>if</b> possible, before DCR is performed.|$|R
5000|$|The Danish philosopher Søren Kierkegaard {{provided}} a critical {{response to the}} cogito.

5|$|Women {{appear to}} have been allowed {{considerable}} freedom and independence during this period. Dutthagamani frequently sought his mother's advice during his military campaign. Rock inscriptions show that women donated caves and temples {{for the use of the}} sangha. However, there are no records of women holding any administrative posts. It is not <b>clear</b> <b>if</b> women were given equal footing with men, but they did have complete freedom in religious matters.|$|E
5|$|Garrett's Miss Pawhuska was a 1946 sorrel mare sired by Leo {{and out of}} Jenny Dee, a {{daughter}} of Jimmie Allred. Her dam (mother) was out of a mare named Big Bay, who was of unknown breeding. Jimmie Allred was sired by Dan whose father was Old Joe Bailey. Jimmie Allred's dam was Alice McGill who was sired by Little Hickory Bill, a son of Hickory Bill who was sired by Peter McCue Garrett's Miss Pawhuska was bred by Bill Rowe of Carlsbad, New Mexico, {{but by the time}} she was a yearling she was owned by Earl Jackson, of Pawhuska, Oklahoma. It isn't <b>clear</b> <b>if</b> Jackson bought Garrett's Miss Pawhuska as a foal or if he bought Garrett's Miss Pawhuska's dam while she was still carrying Garrett's Miss Pawhuska.|$|E
5|$|In 2010, some {{manufacturers}} (notably Samsung) introduced SSD controllers that extended {{the concept of}} BGC to analyze the file system used on the SSD, to identify recently deleted files and unpartitioned space. Samsung claimed that this would ensure that even systems (operating systems and SATA controller hardware) which do not support TRIM could achieve similar performance. The operation of the Samsung implementation appeared to assume and require an NTFS file system. It is not <b>clear</b> <b>if</b> this feature is still available in currently shipping SSDs from these manufacturers. Systematic data corruption has been reported on these drives {{if they are not}} formatted properly using MBR and NTFS.|$|E
