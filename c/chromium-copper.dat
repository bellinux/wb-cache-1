40|$|A {{method of}} forming an {{environmental}} resistant {{thermal barrier coating}} on a copper alloy is disclosed. The steps include cleansing a surface of a copper alloy, depositing a bond coat on the cleansed surface of the copper alloy, depositing a NiAl top coat on the bond coat and consolidating the bond coat and the NiAl top coat to form the thermal barrier coating. The bond coat may be a nickel layer or a layer composed {{of at least one}} of copper and <b>chromium-copper</b> alloy and either the bond coat or the NiAl top coat or both may be deposited using a low pressure or vacuum plasma spray...|$|E
40|$|The {{resistive}} {{and structural}} properties of chromium and <b>chromium-copper</b> alloy films {{were found to}} vary significantly with changes in substrate temperature and deposition rate, and with heat treatment. Properties such as resistance, temperature coefficient of resistance, and Hall coefficient differ considerably from the corrected bulk values. From {{an investigation of the}} structural properties of films, {{it was found that the}} lattice constants of the as-deposited chromium and copper films were somewhat smaller than the ASTM value. Heat treatment in air at 200 ℃ for 3 hrs has improved the resistive properties as determined on 500 Å thick films containing a copper content lower than 60 wt. ％...|$|E
40|$|Thermo-hygro-mechanical (THM) -densified wood is more {{resistant}} to colonisation and degradation by brown-rot fungi than untreated wood. Colonisation and degradation by soft-rot fungi was investigated in treated Norway spruce (Picea abies) and treated beech (Fagus sylvatica) to assess their suitability for utility class 4. Three different treatments were applied: thermal-hygro (TH) treatment, mechanical densification and THM-treatment including densification and post-treatment under saturated steam conditions at different temperatures. For comparison, additional wood specimens were treated with two concentrations of a <b>chromium-copper</b> (CC) wood preservative. After 32 weeks incubation, weight losses induced by soft-rot fungi were lowest in wood treated with CC. Highest weight losses were recorded from TH-treated wood, in which soft-rot erosion attack (type 2) was exclusively observed in spruce. In comparison to controls, significantly lower weight losses by soft-rot fungi were recorded in THM-treated spruce wood, but no such {{differences were found in}} beech wood. Microscopical examination showed that in THM-treated wood of spruce, soft-rot type 1 commenced from the outer wood surfaces and cavity formation was not found in deeper regions of the wood samples. THM-treated beech wood was more susceptible to degradation than that of spruce which can be partly explained by the higher syringyl lignin content in beech wood, which is more susceptible to all kinds of degradation. Hyphal colonisation and soft-rot was facilitated within deeper regions of beech wood mainly in the non-occluded lumina of parenchyma cells in multiseriate xylem rays. It can be concluded that TH-treated spruce wood and THM-treated beech wood is susceptible to soft-rot and therefore inappropriate for utility class...|$|E
