Worldwide, there is a modest correlation between economic atmosphere, information access, and the democratic political environment (Howard et al. 2010 : 110).

And while some researchers have worked on the global Internet inequality by developing quantitative measures, much less work has been done on developing benchmarks for measuring the internet divide within countries. However, since the 9 / 11 attack on the United States, banks and online payment processors have changed their policies and terms of use (Onodu 2013 :¶ 2). Some countries are not “supported online” as part of the ongoing but never ending reforms in the financial sector, while others are able to engage actively in its use. This shows a breach of fairness. Why would populations of a particular region have full access to information and communication technologies (ICTs) while others are denied access? [...]...|$|R

A survey to staff and students from three Nigerian universities revealed that the low acceptance of e-learning {{was due to the}} low awareness level, low computer literacy level, unreliable platform and Internet services, and the high cost of implementation (Folorunso, Ogunseye, & Sharma, 2006). Similarly, obstacles faced by Pakistani universities included infrastructure, students’ limited access to computer, untrained instructors, and cultural beliefs. It was further challenging when schools have to translate English, as the predominant language in the online environment, into the local language of Urdu in order to reach wider learners (Iqbal & Ahmad, 2010).

The adverse demographic structure (the significant decrease {{in the size of the}} young cohorts), the dual composition of the population by educational levels (high share of people with low and high educational attainment, and a very low share of medium attainment) and the huge and rapid increase of female participation rates have been key factors in this process.

This study aims to examine the engagement, acceptability, and retention of an online smoking cessation program (Smoke-Free Recovery; SFR) among a sample of orthopaedic trauma patients, as well as themes around the smoking cessation process. A pilot study of SFR with 31 orthopaedic trauma patients admitted to a public hospital in New South Wales, Australia took place. Semi-structured telephone interviews were conducted following hospital discharge. Thematic analysis and descriptive statistics were used. Engagement was high with 28 participants accessing SFR during admission. Twenty individuals completed follow-up phone calls. Program acceptability was rated favourably. After discharge, changes in smoking habits were noted, with program retention low. Themes on program use included: lack of time or need for additional support; <b>computer</b> <b>illiteracy</b> or technology issues; feeling unready or too stressed to quit; or feeling they had reached the boundary of what could be learnt from the program. This study highlights the difficulties faced by patients following hospital admission, the lack of follow-up support received, and the need for consumer testing prior to roll out.

Aspects of each component are described here, and practical applications are provided. introducing microcomputers into a pre-school program is a complicated task. Agen-cy planning must ensure that they are used effectively. Frequently, because of <b>computer</b> <b>illiteracy</b> or intimidation {{on the part of the}} agency administrator, appropriate software, hardware, or uses of the available tech-nology may not be explored. This may be es-pecially true in planning for the special,needs of the preschool population. These children require specific computer applica-tions (e. g., voice outputs, special input de-vices, stimulus-response activities) which dif-fer from the standard applications with school-age students (e. g., computer-assisted instruction, word processing). A lack of knowledge and awareness among key deci-sion-makers within the agency results in in-appropriate purchases. Computers are not put to use and are often found in closets or basements.

30|$|The {{electronic}} {{version was}} designed to resemble the paper-and-pencil version as closely as possible, including the possibility to skip single items. Previous studies, in several different patient groups, for different ages and different health and computer literacy, etc., have revealed that electronic versions of RAND- 36 and the SF- 36 produce comparable data with the paper-and-pencil versions, supporting the use of mixed-mode administrations [28 – 32]. In the present study, one elderly respondent stated this person {{would have preferred to}} use a paper-and-pencil version. It has been shown that older people tend to prefer paper-and-pencil administrations (probably because of <b>computer</b> <b>illiteracy,</b> as in the present study), whereas younger people and people with higher education tend to prefer electronic versions [33]. The main difference between the electronic and the paper-and-pencil versions is that fewer items are displayed at the same time [34]. Earlier studies have shown that this in fact may impact responses, but also that many persons prefer to view only a few items at the same time since displays with many items can be perceived as stressful [30, 35]. Our results indicate that the electronic version was easy to understand but some minor adjustments to font size, line spacing, etc. may enhance readability. Tablet user instructions may need to be extended to address issues of resizing and scrolling. Computer literacy is high in Sweden, which means that the acceptability of the electronic version in countries with less computer-literate populations may be lower.|$|E
40|$|Information {{retrieval}} {{has progressed}} from {{a reliance on}} traditional print sources to the modern era of computer databases and online networks. Surgeons, many from remote areas not served by professional medical libraries, must develop and maintain skills in information retrieval and management in both electronic and standard formats. One hundred thirty-three New Mexico general surgeons were surveyed to identify their information-seeking patterns in five areas: retrieval purposes, retrieval sources, barriers to access, techniques used, and continuing education needs. Ninety-nine (74. 4 %) surgeons responded to the survey. Ninety-five percent utilize professional meetings, the medical literature, and physician colleagues as information sources. Only 17 % utilize the outreach services of the state's only medical school library. Common retrieval barriers were practice demands (71 %), isolation from medical schools (30 %), <b>computer</b> <b>illiteracy</b> (28 %), and rural environment (25 %). Continuing education topics related to information management would be valuable to 61 % of the surgeons. Sixty-nine percent believe their current ability to access biomedical information is adequate, despite most frequently accessing their personal libraries for information related to decision-making or patient management. These data suggest that, despite significant information needs, surgeons have not embraced newer forms of information retrieval. It is imperative that surgeons acquire and maintain modern information retrieval skills {{as a means of}} remaining up-to-date in their profession.

40|$|In {{the past}} decade, {{the use of}} internet-based {{cognitive}} behavioral treatments (internet-based CBT) {{for a wide range}} of patients has grown intensively. Incorporating the patients' opinions and perspective into new health care innovations might improve the quality and applicability of these innovations, as high dropout rates and low attrition are the often-reported concerns in E-health research. Most studies to date have examined patient perspectives on specific internet-based interventions that patients had participated in, and not the views of the general public. The current paper explores the perspective of patients with rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis on internet-based CBT for these patient groups. In total, 100 patients (55 % male) participated in a semi-structured telephone interview about internet-based CBT, including questions about possible advantages and disadvantages and the readiness to participate in this kind of treatment. Most patients (78 %) were prepared to participate in internet-based CBT. Patients endorsed the advantages (57 %) more often than the disadvantages (34 %). The ease of internet-based CBT and the time saved were especially appealing to patients. Main disadvantages according to patients are that not all patients will be reached due to <b>computer</b> <b>illiteracy</b> and the lack of face-to-face interaction with the therapist. The results suggest that, from the patients' perspective, internet-based CBT is a promising health care development.

The study also aimed at establishing the constraints that hindered effective utilisation of OERs and provide possible remedies. The study used a mixed methods approach in which content analysis and survey methodologies were adopted. A sample of 50 dissertations from all faculties of ZOU was drawn from a total population of 78 projects submitted for assessment during the January to December 2012 academic year at the Mashonaland East Region. The 50 students whose dissertations were sampled were also asked to respond to a questionnaire which mostly required information pertaining to the use of OERs. Results from the study, among others, indicate that to a great extent, OERs were not being utilised by the students in the writing of their dissertation projects. Only 3 (6 %) cited e-books and only 1 (2 %) cited e-newspapers while unclassified web sites were cited in 13 (26 %) of the dissertations while the majority of dissertations 26 (52 %) cited the Wikipedia. The majority of the students cited issues of lack of access due to unavailability of electronic gadgets, <b>computer</b> <b>illiteracy</b> and lack of connectivity. Results also indicate that respondents had little knowledge and time to access OERs due to their geographical distances away from the regional centre internet as well as other internet cafes.

Information Technology (IT) {{that is used}} by {{developed countries}} for reasons of economical and political leadership should also be adopted by developing countries, like Lebanon, if these countries wish to survive and compete internationally. However the adoption of IT means the need for information workers, and schools are considered as having a role to play in preparing the young generation to become the information society of the future. According to the results of this research, the Lebanese Ministry of Education sees the introduction of computer education into schools as an inevitable step but is found, in our opinion, to lack both the expertise and seriousness needed for the implementation of such a huge project. The obstacles for the realization of the plan stem, according to the Ministry, from financial reasons, as well as from a lack of computer-awareness at all levels. On the other hand, private schools that have been introducing computers into their institutions ever since the mid-eighties are doing a rather successful job, although unregulated and uncoordinated, in fighting <b>computer</b> <b>illiteracy.</b> However here again, expertise in both education and computer science is badly needed if the practices are ever to evolve in the right direction. The recommendations to both the Ministry and private schools stress the importance of planning and research, as well as the cooperation between experts in both education and computer science to find out how computers can be integrated into the curriculum, based on national needs, rather than merely introduced. 1 bound copy: viii, 97 leaves; ill., tables available at RNL...|$|E
40|$|This thesis interrogates my and others&# 146; {{creative}} praxis {{using the}} tools of the Internet, webcam, blogging and digital video, to elucidate possibilities for communication. I examine whether these tools are productive for my creativity and others&# 146; in increasing communicative spaces and building social networks amongst the complexities of globalised culture. Many cultural commentators consider the Internet as a new kind of public sphere, developing community, strengthening the lifeworld and providing ethical discourse. The Internet, however, is a context not without problems. Still, less that one quarter of the world&# 146;s population has access, and <b>computer</b> <b>illiteracy</b> and governance (to name only a few) contribute to its limitations &# 150; this dichotomy is central to my investigation. I demonstrate that information communication technologies (ICTs) such as the Internet are radically altering our everyday lives and mediation is increasingly pervasive. I argue, therefore, that our globalised context demands alternative communicative spaces to mainstream media that allow diversity, plurality, intersubjectivity and new forms of interrogation. I ask whether the Internet can assist in the development of social networks and newest social movements (NSMs) by increasing civic bonds and communities. I posit communicative action, reflexivity and praxis as productive tools for a critical practice. I suggest that these theories are influential in researching the Internet&# 146;s potential in generating social awareness. I argue that the Internet can be used to construct social spaces and, in conjunction with creativity, can increase its productive capacity in developing diverse and ethical communicative contexts...|$|E
40|$|Background: It is {{estimated}} that one million people infected with HIV initiate anti-retroviral therapy (ART) in resource-constrained countries annually. This occurs {{against a background of}} overburdened health workers with limited skills to handle rapidly changing treatment standards and guidelines hence compromising quality of care. Electronic medical record (EMR) -based clinical decision support systems (CDSS) are considered a solution to improve quality of care. Little evidence, however, exists on the effectiveness of EMR-based CDSS on quality of HIV care and treatment in resource-constrained settings. Objective: The aim of this systematic review was to identify original studies on EMR-based CDSS describing process and outcome measures as well as reported barriers to their implementation in resource-constrained settings. We characterized the studies by guideline adherence, data and process, and barriers to CDSS implementation. Methods: Two reviewers independently assessed original articles from a search of the MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL and Global Health Library databases until January 2012. The included articles were those that evaluated or described the implementation of EMR-based CDSS that were used in HIV care in low-income countries. Results: A total of 12 studies met the inclusion criteria, 10 of which were conducted in sub-Saharan Africa and 2 in the Caribbean. None of the papers described a strong (randomized controlled) evaluation design. Guideline adherence: One study showed that ordering rates for CD 4 tests were significantly higher when reminders were used. Data and process: Studies reported reduction in data errors, reduction in missed appointments, reduction in missed CD 4 results and reduction in patient waiting time. Two studies showed a significant increase in time spent by clinicians on direct patient care. Barriers to CDSS implementation: Technical infrastructure problems such as unreliable electric power and erratic Internet connectivity, clinicians' limited computer skills and failure by providers to comply with the reminders are key impediments to the implementation and effective use of CDSS. The limited number of evaluation studies, the basic and heterogeneous study designs, and varied outcome measures make it difficult to meaningfully conclude on the effectiveness of CDSS on quality of HIV care and treatment in resource-limited settings. High quality evaluation studies are needed. Factors specific to implementation of EMR-based CDSS in resource-limited setting should be addressed before such countries can demonstrate its full benefits. More work {{needs to be done to}} overcome the barriers to EMR and CDSS implementation in developing countries such as technical infrastructure and care providers' <b>computer</b> <b>illiteracy.</b> However, simultaneously evaluating and describing CDSS implementation strategies that work can further guide wise investments in their wider rollout.
