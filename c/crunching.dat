25|$|In {{the middle}} of the Miocene epoch, the grazer Merychippus flourished. It had wider molars than its predecessors, which are {{believed}} to have been used for <b>crunching</b> the hard grasses of the steppes. The hind legs, which were relatively short, had side toes equipped with small hooves, but they probably only touched the ground when running. Merychippus radiated into at least 19 additional grassland species.|$|E
25|$|Wang's {{first attempt}} at a word {{processor}} was the Wang 1200, announced in late 1971, but not available until 1972. The design consisted of the logic of a Wang 500 calculator hooked up to an OEM-manufactured IBM Selectric typewriter for keying and printing, and dual cassette decks for storage. Harold Koplow, who had written the microcode for the Wang 700 (and its derivative, the Wang 500) rewrote the microcode to perform word processing functions instead of number <b>crunching.</b>|$|E

There was a version of <b>Crunch</b> Berries available briefly in which the berries, instead of being spherical, were three small berries in a cluster. The <b>Crunch</b> Berry Beast mascot {{was introduced}} alongside the cereal. There are currently four <b>Crunch</b> Berry colors: red, green (introduced in 2002), blue, and violet (both introduced in the '90s). All the berry pieces are flavored the same, regardless of color.|$|R
25|$|The {{equipment}} of the drummers {{in these}} groups was of particular {{significance in the}} development of early drum sets. Cymbals, bass, and snare drums were all used. Indeed, a method of damping a set of cymbals by <b>crunching</b> them together while playing bass drum simultaneously is probably how today's hi-hat, a major part of today's drum set, came about. Military technique and instrumentation were undoubtedly factors {{in the development of}} early jazz and its drumming, but the melodic and metric elements in jazz are more easily traced to the dance bands of the time period.|$|E
25|$|By midnight all was quiet, but {{the ship}} was still labouring to rejoin {{the main part of}} the convoy. Steaming on slowly, Saturday turned into Sunday. Sunday 26 October would be a day that the crew of the English Trader would never forget. Between 1 am and 1.30 am, {{the ship was}} {{struggling}} against a strong ebbing tide, which in turn forced her dangerously close to the sandbanks of Hammond Knoll. At around 1.45 am the crew felt a slight jolt followed by a more severe jolt. This flung the ship forward followed by loud grinding, <b>crunching</b> and scraping of metal. Then there was silence. The ship had run aground on Hammond Knoll.|$|E
25|$|Despite the Australian media {{treating}} {{the defeat of}} the Papua New Guinean team as a mere formality, with the team having odds of 125-1 to win the tournament, the players and journalists at home were positive that the Kumuls could make a lasting impression in the tournament. After their first up 42-0 defeat against Australia, the team's enthusiasm and <b>crunching</b> tackles were praised, but ball control and creativity let the team down hugely. However the team faced much more criticism after their 76-12 thrashing suffered at the hands of New Zealand, with fans angry at the poor display from the players and some questioning the credentials of new coach Stanley Gene. Days after the match a broader look at the sport in the country occurred with one assessment concluding that rugby league was poorly managed and former PNG great Marcus Bai called on clubs to supply a greater number of representative standard players especially from the New Guinea Islands region which had supplied five of this year's team. The way politics had made its way into the governing of the sport was also condemned.|$|E

It was discontinued in 2006, but made a return in 2015 due to its cult popularity among its fans. [...] Peanut Butter Toast <b>Crunch</b> was a cereal consisting of flakes similar but darker to Cinnamon Toast <b>Crunch.</b> Frosted Toast <b>Crunch</b> resembles Cinnamon Toast <b>Crunch</b> with vanilla coating. This cereal was discontinued by 2006. As another offshoot, Monopoly Cereal was a limited edition product created in April 2003 by General Mills.

Reachs system of interactive audio {{was much more}} complex, featuring the ability to combine up to seven layers of instrumentation compared to [...] Combat Evolveds two. Developers also expanded the sound effect system. Every interacting object in Reach produces two sounds for respective objects; for example, a Warthog vehicle that hits an armored Covenant soldier produces a <b>crunching</b> metal noise based on the two colliding elements. The interaction between objects and terrain was demonstrated in an in-game environment that O'Donnell called [...] "the stripey room" [...] after the bands of alternating colors on the objects and environment.|$|E

[...] Chris Gill of Guitar Player, conversely, said [...] "the most interesting parts are Durante's steel guitar lines, which howl like revving engines".

One can actually sense the beats of Shiva's dumru and fumes of intoxicating chillum. Simply unputdownable." [...] Nandita Sengupta from The Times of India felt that [...] "while the author spins a tale of adventure, {{it could have been a}} slightly snappier, tighter read.

500|$|In contrast, reviewers from GamesRadar and Computer and Video Games {{appreciated}} the linear nature; the former stated that [...] "the streamlined, focused structure eliminates potential tedium without dumbing anything down", {{while the latter}} felt it was [...] "a clever move", and kept the player from being [...] " [...] down with mundane number <b>crunching,</b> [...] finicky and repetitive leveling-up." [...] Many negatively noted the gradual unfurling of the player's abilities over this {{first part of the}} game, from battle gameplay to selecting the party leader. Combined with the game's linear nature, some reviews went as far as to describe these chapters as [...] "boring" [...] until the world of Gran Pulse was revealed.

500|$|Ronnie Kerswell of Rock Sound {{said that}} the album [...] "does not disappoint", {{describing}} it as having [...] "heady guitar trips and <b>crunching</b> grooves". She found Weiland's voice to be improved {{in part due to}} his sober lifestyle and wrote that the band was [...] "back in action". USA Todays Jerry Schriver praised the band for releasing a [...] "cohesive, self-produced reunion album", but admitted the tracks were not [...] "timeless". The songs were found to be [...] "pleasant" [...] but [...] "disposable" [...] and inoffensive. Schriver commended Dean DeLeo for keeping the [...] "well-constructed tunes" [...] moving forward, despite Weiland's lyrics. Allison Stewart, writing for The Washington Post, decided the album was a [...] "small victory" [...] and [...] "respectable" [...] but ultimately [...] "a weirdly mild, tension-free outing."

500|$|Despite {{its huge}} {{commercial}} success, critical reception was mixed. The specialist music press were generally positive.

[...] Like most critics, Q referred to the excesses of Steinman's style, citing {{the length of the}} songs (Q says that [...] "Objects..." [...] running for 10 minutes and 12 seconds is [...] "not necessary"). Unlike the original, where the epic loud songs were [...] "offset by the softness of stuff like 'Two Out of Three Ain't Bad'…even the ballads are Roman orgies of sound and fury." [...] This, they say, means [...] "the album's probable theme—the crushing effect growing up has on teenage dreams—seems to get lost among the thud and blunder." [...] However, overall, Q is positive, concluding with the sentiment that [...] "Ultimately, Back Into Hell may not trash its predecessor, but as a mad, <b>crunching,</b> stadium rock album, it's probably the best thing of its kind you'll hear this year." ...|$|E
500|$|Hellyeah {{received}} generally positive reviews. William Ruhlmann of Allmusic {{awarded the}} album {{three and a}} half stars out of five, commenting; [...] "Their album is a competent example of its genre, in which Tribbett and Maxwell combine to create crushing riffs over the pummeling rhythm section of Paul, while Gray howls typically enraged, expletive-littered lyrics to songs". However, Ruhlmann believes Hellyeah is not a notable variation from members' previous bands. Blabbermouth.net reviewer Don Kaye awarded the album 7 out of 10, praising the track [...] "Matter of Time" [...] for its slashing main riff, and [...] "One Thing" [...] as it [...] "marches to the finish line with a rumbling, <b>crunching</b> wall of guitars worthy of Dimebag himself". Kaye thought that Hellyeah's first studio effort was not equal to any of its members' main output. KNAC contributor Andrew Depedro stated [...] "it's a set of good songs recorded by 5 accomplished musicians from diverse backgrounds not letting their pasts define them and those songs {{in one form or another}} speak to you in different ways".|$|E
