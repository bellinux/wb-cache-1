5|$|In 1850, Cleveland's father {{moved to}} Clinton, Oneida County, New York, {{to work as}} {{district}} secretary for the American Home Missionary Society. Despite his father's dedication to his missionary work, the income was insufficient for the large family. Financial conditions forced him to remove Grover from school into a two-year mercantile apprenticeship in Fayetteville. The experience was valuable and brief, and the living conditions quite austere. Grover returned to <b>Clinton</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> schooling {{at the completion of}} the apprentice contract. In 1853, when missionary work began to take a toll on his health, Cleveland's father took an assignment in Holland Patent, New York (near Utica) and the family moved again.

25|$|No {{church or}} priest for Aslackby is {{recorded}} in the 1086 Domesday Book. The first mention of a priest is of Geoffrey de Temple in 1225, attendant to the Knights Templar who had established a preceptory at Aslackby the previous century. In 1164 benefactor Hubert de Rye provided a church and round chapel for the Templars, the remains of which stood until the 18thcentury when it became part of a farmhouse. The preceptory itself was probably founded in 1194 following the 1185 patronage of Robert de Rye. In 1312 the Templar preceptory was appropriated by King Edward II, and by 1338 it had been transferred to the Knights Hospitaller with an income of £40 per annum as a messuageincluding church and associated landunder the control of Henry, 3rd Earl of Lancaster. Following this the preceptory for administrative purposes {{became part of the}} previous Knights Templar property of Temple Bruer. The first Knights Hospitaller sponsored priest at Aslackby was Nicholas de Camelton in 1321. In 1541-42, following the dissolution of the monasteries, the lands were granted to Edward, Lord <b>Clinton</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> wife, Ursula. Parts of the original Templar round church still existed until 1800. The remaining preceptory tower was demolished in 1891. The building of the present StJames' church was begun c.1300, conjoined to the appropriated Templar property. The church was extended in the mid-15thcentury, with a further restoration in 1856 at which time the chancel was rebuilt.|$|E

500|$|Bush's {{approval}} ratings were around 80percent during the Gulf War, {{and he was}} described as unbeatable. When Bush compromised with Democrats to try to lower Federal deficits, he reneged on his , which hurt his approval rating. Clinton repeatedly condemned Bush for making a promise he failed to keep. By election time, the economy was souring and Bush saw his approval rating plummet to just slightly over 40percent. Finally, conservatives were previously united by anti-communism, but {{with the end of}} the Cold War, the party lacked a uniting issue. When Pat Buchanan and Pat Robertson addressed Christian themes at the Republican National Convention—with Bush criticizing Democrats for omitting God from their platform—many moderates were alienated. Clinton then pointed to his moderate, [...] "New Democrat" [...] record as governor of Arkansas, though some on the more liberal side of the party remained suspicious. Many Democrats who had supported Ronald Reagan and Bush in previous elections switched their support to Clinton. <b>Clinton</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> running mate, Al Gore, toured the country during the final weeks of the campaign, shoring up support and pledging a [...] "new beginning".|$|E

[...] The Clinton campaign had been TRM's sole client during 1992, collecting commissions from booking charter flights for the campaign.
