40|$|Over {{the last}} few decades, house prices in the UK have risen {{at a higher rate}} than general prices, as {{measured}} by, for example, the retail <b>price</b> index. <b>Construction</b> <b>prices,</b> on the other hand, tend to have risen broadly in line with general prices. Assuming the same things are being measured in each case, this implies that, over the period, the price of land, the most significant non-construction element of house prices, has risen at a faster rate than house prices and a much higher rate than <b>construction</b> <b>prices.</b> This paper reviews past price trends and concludes that not only have house prices risen faster than <b>construction</b> <b>prices</b> but also that, as a result, <b>construction</b> <b>prices</b> represent a smaller proportion of house prices. The paper also considers briefly what might be the implications if that trend continued- or if it did not. <b>Construction</b> <b>Prices</b> Land Prices House Prices Trends Allow Approx Picas,...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{investigate}} {{the role of}} technological differences between the construction sector and the general economy {{in the evolution of}} real housing prices. In particular we ask whether the recent soar in housing prices across countries reflects the different trends of total factor productivity (TFP) in the construction sector versus the other sectors. To do this, we first compare housing and <b>construction</b> <b>prices</b> in the U. S., the U. K., Germany and Spain. We find that the two prices follow a similar pattern before 1997 and diverge afterwards in all countries. Second, we perform a growth accounting exercise to measure the contribution of relative TFP on the <b>price</b> of <b>construction</b> relative to GDP for the four countries. We find evidence of a strong positive contribution of relative TFP to <b>construction</b> <b>prices</b> {{in the case of the}} United States and Germany. Instead, in the case of Spain and the U. K., relative TFP has contributed negatively to the evolution of <b>construction</b> <b>prices,</b> which have grown due to the dynamics of wages and capital returns. We conclude that in these two countries, market conditions, rather than technological factors, have been the main culprits of the recent soar in housing prices. ...|$|R
