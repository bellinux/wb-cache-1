Two samples were prepared {{in the presence}} of appropriate templating agents (hexadecyltrimethylammonium chloride, decyltrimethylammonium bromide). After template removal they were reacted with 3 -mercaptopropyltrimethoxysilane followed by transforming the thiol groups by oxidation to sulfonic acid functions. Two other catalyst samples were also prepared by treatment with phenyltriethoxysilane before template removal and functionalization. Sample characterization was performed by physical (low-angle X-ray powder diffraction, nitrogen adsorption, and desorption) and chemical (acid-base titration) methods. Three catalytic transformations were studied. Highly selective formation of para-tert-butylphenol through the isomerization of the ortho isomer was found in the alkylation of phenol with 2 -methylpropan- 2 -ol over three of the catalysts. In the pinacol rearrangement of meso-hydrobenzoine, the rates of formation of diphenylacetaldehyde produced through phenyl migration with much higher steric requirement, parallel the changes in pore sizes. The reactivity of three aromatic ketones (acetophenone, 2 -acetylnaphtalene, and 3 -acetylphenantrene) in the formation of cyclic ketals over three of the catalysts depends significantly on the steric bulk of the reacting molecules. Furthermore, reactivity of the molecules with larger ring size in competitive reactions decreased and even stopped almost completely after the first hour and only the smaller molecule reacted further. Molecular modeling indicated that steric requirements might have significant effects on the reactivity over MCM- 41 -based catalysts.

This investigation studied the fundamental factors known to contribute to catalyst deactivation, by developing the specific designs and by construction of ageing facilities that isolated the ageing factors under inspection. Various static ageing schedules were completed along with rapid ageing cycles {{with the aid of}} a custom built synthetic gas ageing machine named AutoCAS, (Automotive <b>Catalyst</b> <b>Ageing</b> System). Explicit characterisation techniques to help define the extent of catalyst degradation were also developed. These focused on use of scanning electron, microscopy and transmission electron microscopy to produce images of the catalyst which could then be analysed using image analysis software. The software program enabled statistical data to be collated, allowing conclusions to be drawn about the surface structure before and after ageing. Raman spectroscopy was used to probe the changes in catalyst substrate after the ageing process. Results uncovered that Platinum/Rhodium, (PtIRh), catalysts behave differently to Palladium, Pd, catalysts with respect to particle agglomeration. Pd loaded samples exhibited relationships with respect to ageing time and temperature whilst PtlRh catalysts were only susceptible to ageing temperature. Also, concluded was that PtlRh catalysts undergo agglomeration in an inert nitrogen environment which is in direct contradiction to mathematical expressions already published. Precious metal particle agglomeration was found to have a relatively insignificant role to play in overall catalyst deactivation. RATA ageing showed that the thermal stressing incurred by thermal cycling affected the catalyst activity more so than ageing at uniform temperature. Application ofthe current QUB catalyst model showed that there may be other factors contributing to deactivation rather than just washcoat sintering and precious metal agglomeration as measured in this research.

40|$|International @ ING+ERE:PFO:YSCInternational audienceIntroductionWith {{the need}} for energy {{resource}} diversification, there is an increasing interest in Fischer-Tropsch (FT) synthesis. This process allows syngas (CO+H 2) conversion issued from natural gas, coal or biomass into long-chain paraffins that can be upgraded into excellent diesel/kerosene fractions. Catalytic properties of cobalt-based FT catalysts strongly depend on their morphological and structural properties [1 - 2]. Previous in-situ XRD and magnetic studies during the activation showed the possibility to selectively orient the cobalt crystal phase to either mainly face centered cubic (fcc) or mainly hexagonal closed packed (hcp) according to the operating conditions during activation [3]. These catalysts have been tested in Fischer-Tropsch synthesis in order to differentiate activity, selectivity and potential mechanism specificities regarding to each crystal phase orientation {{as well as the}} particle size distribution. In order to get a fine description of the catalyst systems, high resolution chromatographic analysis combined with multi-product isotopic transient kinetic experiments have been carried out. In addition to classical data analysis, micro-kinetic modeling using different reaction mechanisms is used to correlate the key kinetic parameters to the catalyst structure. ExperimentalCatalyst testing for FT synthesis was carried out in a quartz plug flow reactor at 1. 6 bars, 215 - 235 °C with a H 2 /CO ratio of 2 and about 300 hours of time on stream (TOS) to account for <b>catalyst</b> <b>ageing.</b> Catalyst preparation and activation (via carbidization/decarbidization) affording mainly hcp and mainly fcc Co° crystal phase orientation have already been described elsewhere. Note that in both cases a mixture of hcp and fcc phases are obtained, but we refer to them as fcc or hcp Co°. The online analysis system for catalyst testing was composed of a cryogenic GC, a GC/MS with 16 storage loops and a MS gas analyzer. The combination of these techniques allowed monitoring product distribution (paraffins, α- and β-olefins and isomers) and determining the isotopic composition of a large range of products during SSITKA experiments (replacement of 12 CO by 13 CO). A large product’s isotopic diversity is transiently induced the SSITKA switch of the feed. To face this complexity in the modeling work, an algorithm has been developed to automatically explore all possible paths of the reaction network. It starts from a flexible reaction network based on elementary steps. The code then generates all species involved before and after the 12 CO/ 13 CO switch. The fully coupled ordinary differential equation system governed by the considered network is integrated by DVODE while ODRPACK is used for the multi-response adjustment of the kinetic parameters. Results and DiscussionThe hcp Co° oriented catalyst is less active than the fcc Co° oriented catalyst. The methane selectivity is slightly higher for hcp Co° than fcc Co° at low temperature (205 °C) whereas hardly any difference between the two samples is exhibited at higher temperature. Analysis of the product distributions reveals that the olefin to paraffin ratio for hcp Co° is lower than fcc Co° at the same time on stream (100 h) indicating that hcp Co° have a weaker hydrogenation power. SSITKA experiments were performed over both catalysts. Selected SSITKA responses of 1 -hexene are reported in figure 1. After the 12 CO/ 13 CO switch, the response curves for fcc Co° are faster than for hcp Co°. This is, the replacement of 12 C by 13 C in the final products is faster for fcc Co° catalyst. Based on SSITKA principles [4], it can be deduced that intermediates surface residence times are longer on hcp Co° particles for all intermediates leading to the product distribution than for fcc Co°. This delay over the hcp Co° could be explained by a slow-down of the intrinsic kinetics and/or by the existence of a larger intermediate reservoir taking more time to be replenished.

SSITKA experiments over fcc and hcp Co° with increasing time on stream show an increase of the surface residence time of intermediate species during the first hundreds hours on stream which could be linked to <b>catalyst</b> <b>ageing.</b> Since many products share the same intermediates and can be reinserted in the polymerization process, the direct quantification of the reaction rates and reservoirs sizes is not obvious.

40|$|AbstractAccelerated {{deactivation}} {{tests of}} the pre-sulfided Mo–W/SiO 2 –Al 2 O 3 commercial catalyst were performed using heavy vacuum petroleum feedstock. High reaction temperature employed in the accelerated <b>catalyst</b> <b>aging</b> resulted in large amounts of carbonaceous deposition with high aromaticity, which {{was found to be}} the principal deactivation cause. The effect of catalyst deactivation on hydrocracking of vacuum residue was studied. Experiments were carried out in a batch reactor at 60 bar, feed to catalyst ratio 10 : 1 and temperature 425 °C. The duration time for a cycle-run was 4 h. On increasing the interval duration times from 4 to 20 h (i. e. five cycles), the quality of the hydrocracked products was decreased. In each cycle-run, a fresh feedstock was used with the same sulfide catalyst. The quality of distillate products, such as hydrodesulfurization (HDS) was decreased from 61. 50 % to 39. 52 %, while asphaltene contents of the total liquid product were increased from 2. 7 % to 5. 2 % and their boiling ranges were increased during these duration times due to the successive catalyst deactivation during the 5 cycle-runs, caused by successive adsorption of coke formation...|$|R
40|$|Gold for {{stabilizing}} catalysts! The {{control of}} <b>catalysts</b> <b>aging</b> {{is a critical}} step {{for the preservation of}} their properties. This is particularly true for bimetallic nanoparticles, where the composition may change during the catalyzed reaction. While so far the observations on the stability of the catalysts were essentially performed «post mortem», that is to say, after use, we have followed individually by scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) the evolution under oxygen of Au-Cu nanopar-ticles supported on TiO 2 (110). These experiments demonstrate the direct link between stability and Au composition: while pure copper particles dissociate under O 2, bimetallic particles comprising at least 20 % Au are stable. This effect is explained by the local state density modification of Cu atoms induced by Au. Two key points have enabled us to obtain these results. First, we have measured individually the com-position of the particles, and, secondly, we have followed simultaneously four regions of the sample corresponding to Au, Cu, Au-Cu particles and the bare surface. The particles have been monitored from their synthesis up to their exposure to low oxygen pressure (up to 10 - 5 mbar) and, for exactly the sam...|$|R
40|$|Several {{aspects of}} {{catalyst}} deactivation {{have been studied}} with reference toselective acetylene hydrogenation, a reaction used industrially to purify ethylene from unwanted acetylene. A mathematical model has been developed for an industrial packed-bed reactor, employing a supported Pd catalyst. Based on the reactor model, anextended Kalman filter was developed to estimate catalyst activity from process data. This framework {{was found to be}} an excellent tool for combining information from measurements and partly uncertain process models. All systems using process data are sensitive to occasional gross errors. An improved scheme is presented for detection of such errors, based on balance equations and specified variable bounds. Within the scope of modelling, a new numerical algorithm has been developed for preparative liquid chromatography problems. The proposed algorithm is based on a novel view of axial dispersion and is superior to conventional algorithms for high-efficiency columns. Coke formation and its effects on reaction rates have been studied in an internal recycle reactor. The catalysts used were Pd/. alpha. -Al 2 O 3 and Pd/. gamma. - Al 2 O 3. Acetylene hydrogenation rate was only slightly affected by <b>catalyst</b> <b>aging,</b> while the product distribution changed more. Accumulation of coke in the porous catalysts was found to increase the intraparticle diffusion resistance leading to an increased ethane formation. This effect could be readily explained by a model for the intraparticle mass transfer. Aside from mass transfer effects, no direct relation was found between observed reaction rates and the amount of coke deposited on the catalyst. In contrast, ethane formation increased markedly when a <b>catalyst</b> was <b>aged</b> at low H 2 /C 2 H 2 ratios or {{in the presence of a}} liquid. TPO analyses showed no differences between coke formed at different conditions, suggesting that the increased ethane formation is caused by only a small fraction of the deposited species. The incorporation of deuterium in the deposited coke showed that hydrogen or deuterium from the gas is needed for coke formation. A half- hydrogenated species is suggested as the coke precursor...|$|R
40|$|International audienceNew silver-platinum {{bimetallic}} oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalysts are {{investigated in}} alkaline media both for kinetics and stability aspects. Polycrystalline materials and carbon-supported nanoparticles (Pt/C and Ag-Pt/C) are compared. All catalyst active areas are evaluated by hydrogen adsorption voltammetry and transmission electron microscopy. ORR pathway, studied on a rotating ring-disk electrode, involves four electrons per oxygen molecule both on bimetallic and pure platinum catalysts in classical sodium hydroxide solution (1 M NaOH at 25 °C). In industrial medium (11. 1 M NaOH at 80 °C), only three electrons are exchanged on bulk platinum resulting from partial peroxide formation; these peroxide ions are chemically decomposed {{in the active}} layer for carbon-supported catalysts leading to an apparent four-electron pathway. ORR is shown to be first order toward oxygen both in classical and industrial sodium hydroxide solutions. ORR kinetic parameters for silver-platinum bimetallic catalysts are comparable to platinum, even in industrial medium. Carbon-supported <b>catalysts</b> <b>aging</b> behaviors in industrial medium demonstrate the highly instable nature of Pt/C both in open-circuit and polarization, leading to particle growth and consequently to active area decrease. Conversely, Ag-Pt/C remains stable under the same aging conditions. Ag-Pt/C, stable and active, is therefore a suitable catalyst for the air cathode in the membrane chlor-alkali electrolysis process...|$|R
