5|$|DisplayPort {{connector}} {{is compatible}} with HDMI and can trasmit single-link DVI and HDMI 1.2/1.4/2.0 signals using attached passive adapters or adapter cables. The source device includes a dual-mode transmitter which supports both LVDS signals used by DisplayPort and TMDS signals used by DVI/HDMI. The same external connector is used for both protocols - when DVI/HDMI passive adapter is attached, the transmitter circuit switches to TDMS mode. DisplayPort Dual-mode ports and cables/adapters are typically marked with the DisplayPort++ logo. Thunderbolt ports with mDP connector also supports Dual-mode passive HDMI adapters/cables. Conversion to dual-link DVI and <b>component</b> <b>video</b> (VGA/YPbPr) requires active powered adapters.|$|E

25|$|Sony first {{demonstrated}} a wideband analog high-definition television system HDTV capable video camera, monitor and {{video tape recorder}} (VTR) in April 1981 at an international meeting of television engineers in Algiers. The HDVS range was launched in April 1984, with the HDC-100 camera, HDV-100 video recorder and HDS-100 video switcher all working in the 1125-line <b>component</b> <b>video</b> format with interlaced video and a 5:3 aspect ratio.|$|E
25|$|All luminanceâ€“chrominance formats {{used in the}} {{different}} TV and video standards such as YIQ for NTSC, YUV for PAL, YDBDR for SECAM, and YPBPR for <b>component</b> <b>video</b> use color difference signals, by which RGB color images can be encoded for broadcasting/recording and later decoded into RGB again to display them. These intermediate formats were needed for compatibility with pre-existent black-and-white TV formats. Also, those color difference signals need lower data bandwidth compared to full RGB signals.|$|E
25|$|NTSC DVDs {{may carry}} closed {{captions}} in data packets of the MPEG-2 video streams {{inside of the}} Video-TS folder. Once played out of the analog outputs of a set top DVD player, the caption data is converted to the Line 21 format. They are output by the player to the composite video (or an available RF connector) for a connected TV's built-in decoder or a set-top decoder as usual. They can not be output on S-Video or <b>component</b> <b>video</b> outputs {{due to the lack}} of a colorburst signal on line 21. (Actually, regardless of this, if the DVD player is in interlaced rather than progressive mode, closed captioning will be displayed on the TV over <b>component</b> <b>video</b> input if the TV captioning is turned on and set to CC1.) When viewed on a personal computer, caption data can be viewed by software that can read and decode the caption data packets in the MPEG-2 streams of the DVD-Video disc. Windows Media Player (before Windows 7) in Vista supported only closed caption channels 1 and 2 (not 3 or 4). Apple's DVD Player does not have the ability to read and decode Line 21 caption data which are recorded on a DVD made from an over-the-air broadcast. It can display some movie DVD captions.|$|E

25|$|At the 2007 Macworld conference, Jobs {{demonstrated}} the Apple TV (previously {{known as the}} iTV), a set-top video device intended to bridge the sale of content from iTunes with high-definition televisions. The device links up to a user's TV and syncs, either via Wi-Fi or a wired network, with one computer's iTunes library and streams content from an additional four. The Apple TV originally incorporated a 40GB hard drive for storage, included outputs for HDMI and <b>component</b> <b>video,</b> and played video at a maximum resolution of 720p. On May 30, 2007, a 160 GB hard disk drive was released alongside the existing 40GB model. A software update released on January 15, 2008, allowed media to be purchased directly from the Apple TV.|$|E
25|$|The PS3 {{supports}} numerous SDTV and HDTV resolutions (from 480i/576i up to 1080p) and connectivity options (such as HDMI 1.3a and <b>component</b> <b>video).</b> In {{terms of}} audio, the PS3 supports {{a number of}} formats, including 7.1 digital audio, Dolby TrueHD, DTS-HD Master Audio and others; audio output is possible over stereo RCA cables (analog), optical digital cables, or HDMI. The PS3 slim features an upgraded HDMI chip that allows bitstreaming of lossless audio codecs to an external receiver (earlier versions had to decode the signal internally before outputting it via LPCM). For the optical disc drive, {{a wide variety of}} DVD and CD formats are supported, as well as Blu-ray Discs. A 20, 40, 60, 80, 120, 160, 250, 320, or 500GB 2.5-inch SATA 150 hard disk is preinstalled. In the early 60GB and 80GB configurations, flash memory can also be used, either Memory Sticks; CompactFlash cards; or SD/MMC cards. All models support USB memory devices; flash drives and external hard drives are both automatically recognized. However, they must be formatted with the FAT32 file system. For communication, the system sported four USB 2.0 ports at the front on the 20 and 60GB models as well as the NTSC 80GB model, but the 40GB and 80GB PAL models only have two USB ports. All models (80 and 160GB) released after August 2008 have been reduced to two USB ports, as well as dropping CompactFlash and SD card support. One Gigabit Ethernet port, Bluetooth 2.0 support, and built-in Wi-Fi (except CECHBxx).|$|E
