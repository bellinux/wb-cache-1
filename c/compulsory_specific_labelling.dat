40|$|In immunoelectron {{microscopy}} (immuno-EM) on ultrathin sections, gold {{particles are}} used for localization of molecular components of cells. These particles are countable, and quantitative methods have been established to estimate and evaluate the density and distribution of “raw” gold particle counts from a single uncontrolled labeling experiment. However, these raw counts are composed of two distinct elements: particles that are <b>specific</b> (<b>specific</b> <b>labeling)</b> and particles that are not (nonspecific labeling) for the target component. So far, approaches for assessment of <b>specific</b> <b>labeling</b> and for correction of raw gold particle counts to reveal <b>specific</b> <b>labeling</b> densities and distributions have not attracted much attention. Here, we discuss experimental strategies for determining specificity in immuno-EM, and we present methods for quantitative assessment of (1) the probability that an observed gold particle is specific for the target, (2) the density of <b>specific</b> <b>labeling,</b> and (3) the distribution of <b>specific</b> <b>labeling</b> over a series of compartments. These methods should be of general utility for researchers investigating the distribution of cellular components using on-section immunogold labeling.

40|$|The second {{harmonic}} generation (SHG) active nanocrystals have been demonstrated as attractive imaging probes in nonlinear microscopy due to their coherent, non-bleaching and non-blinking signals with a broad flexibility {{in the choice of}} excitation wavelength.

The specificity was achieved by covalently coupling antibodies onto the nanocrystals.

40|$|The {{subcellular}} {{distribution of}} the 1, 4 -dihydropyridine receptor was determined in rabbit skeletal muscle in situ by immunofluorescence and immunoelectron microscopy. Longitudinal and transverse cryosections (5 - 8 microns) of rabbit gracilis muscle were labeled with monoclonal antibodies specific against either the alpha 1 -subunit (170, 000 -D polypeptide) or the beta-subunit (52, 000 -D polypeptide) of the 1, 4 - dihydropyridine receptor by immunofluorescence labeling. In longitudinal sections, <b>specific</b> <b>labeling</b> was present only near the interface between the A- and I-band regions of the sarcomeres. In transverse sections, <b>specific</b> <b>labeling</b> showed a hexagonal staining pattern within each myofiber however, the relative staining intensity of the type II (fast) fibers was judged to be three- to fourfold {{higher than that of}} the type I (slow) fibers. <b>Specific</b> immunofluorescence <b>labeling</b> of the sarcolemma was not observed in either longitudinal or transverse sections. These results are consistent with the idea that the alpha 1 -subunit and the beta-subunit of the purified 1, 4 - dihydropyridine receptor are densely distributed in the transverse tubular membrane. Immunoelectron microscopical localization with a monoclonal antibody to the alpha 1 -subunit of the 1, 4 -dihydropyridine receptor showed that the 1, 4 -dihydropyridine receptor is densely distributed in the transverse tubular membrane. Approximately half of these were distributed in close proximity to the junctional region between the transverse tubules and the terminal cisternae. <b>Specific</b> <b>labeling</b> was also present in discrete foci in the subsarcolemmal region of the myofibers. The size and the nonrandom {{distribution of the}}se foci in the subsarcolemmal region support the possibility that they correspond to invaginations from the sarcolemma called caveolae. In conclusion, our results demonstrate that the 1, 4 -dihydropyridine receptor in skeletal muscle is localized to the transverse tubular membrane and discrete foci in the subsarcolemmal region, possibly caveolae but absent from the lateral portion of the sarcolemma...|$|R
