FTIR results showed that absorption peaks of functional groups on the surface <b>of</b> <b>char</b> from catalytic pyrolysis at 700 T were more than that <b>of</b> <b>char</b> from noncatalytic pyrolysis. Raman results demonstrated values Of (I-D 3 + I-D 4) /I-G,I- <b>of</b> <b>chars</b> from catalytic pyrolysis and noncatalytic pyrolysis were 4. 76 and 3. 86, respectively, indicating that ordering <b>of</b> the <b>char</b> was decreased by Fe 2 O 3.

40|$|The <b>charring</b> <b>of</b> organic {{materials}} during carbon analysis bythermal methods {{makes it difficult}} to differentiate elemental carbon (EC) from organic carbon (OC). Failure to correct for charring results in the overestimation of EC and the underestimation <b>of</b> OC. The <b>charring</b> characteristics and thermal behaviors of aerosol OC are studied by subjecting hexane and water extracts of ambient aerosols to various analysis conditions. The complete evolution of water-soluble organic carbon (WSOC) aerosol materials is found to require a temperature as high as 850 degreesC and the presence of oxygen. EC would be oxidized under these thermal conditions as well. As a result, thermal methods relying only on temperature for the differentiation of EC and OC would give unreliable OC and EC concentrations. Our investigation also reveals that WSOC accounts for a large fraction (13 - 66 %) <b>of</b> <b>charring,</b> while hexane extractable organic compounds produce little <b>charring.</b> The extent <b>of</b> <b>charring</b> from WSOC, defined as the ratio between pyrolytically generated EC to the total WSOC, is found to increase with the WSOC loading in each analysis when the loadings are below a certain value, This ratio remains constant when the loadings are above this value. This may account for the high variability in the extent <b>of</b> <b>charring</b> among aerosol samples from different locations as well as among samples from a single location collected at different times. Charring is reduced if the residence time at each temperature step in a helium atmosphere is sufficiently long to allow for maximum C evolution at each step. Charring is also influenced by the presence of inorganic constituents such as ammonium bisulfate. For the few tested {{organic materials}}, it is observed that ammonium bisulfate enhances the <b>charring</b> <b>of</b> starch and cellulose but reduces the <b>charring</b> <b>of</b> levoglucosan...|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigated}} the use of TGA under different thermal decomposition conditions (nitrogen or air, and 5 or 40 ℃/min) to evaluate preservative-treated woods and their preservatives. It also analyzed the residual elements in the char using EDX. Two types of preservative-treated woods were investigated. One impregnated with CCA- 3 {{and the other one}} treated with ACQ- 1 using a full-cell treatment. The results of the TGA showed that the thermal properties of CCA- or ACQ-treated wood were similar to that of untreated wood in either a nitrogen or an air atmosphere, but the pyrolysis temperature for the heating rate of 5 ℃/min was lower than that of 40 ℃/min. Regardless of different atmosphere or heating rate, the <b>char</b> <b>of</b> the CCA specimens and the CCA- 3 was more than that of the ACQ ones and the ACQ- 1. The results of the EDX analysis of both preservative-treated woods show that the main element is C (CCA: 47. 96 %; ACQ: 50. 24 %), and that the relative proportion of C (CCA: 60. 42 %; ACQ: 77. 89 %) is higher after thermal decomposition. Cr from the <b>char</b> <b>of</b> CCA- 3 is a stable element, and the amount of Cr (34. 99 %) is obviously more than that of As (11. 89 %) and Cu (16. 69 %). The <b>char</b> <b>of</b> ACQ- 1 left a high amount of inorganic metal elements, such as Cu (50. 14 %). This suggests that by using EDX to analyze the residual elements in char, the results can provide experimental data for referencing the disposal-end practices (<b>char)</b> <b>of</b> both preservative-treated woods...|$|R
