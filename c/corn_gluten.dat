25|$|Reports of {{widespread}} and possibly intentional adulteration of Chinese animal feed with melamine {{have raised the}} issue of melamine contamination in the human food supply, both in China and abroad. On 27 April, the U.S. FDA subjected all vegetable proteins imported from China, intended for human or animal consumption, to detention without physical examination, including: wheat gluten, rice gluten, rice protein, rice protein concentrate, <b>corn</b> <b>gluten,</b> <b>corn</b> <b>gluten</b> meal, corn byproducts, soy protein, soy gluten, proteins (includes amino acids and protein hydrosylates), and mung bean protein. In a teleconference with reporters on 1 May, officials from the FDA and U.S. Department of Agriculture said between 2.5 and 3 million people in the United States had consumed chickens that had consumed feed containing contaminated vegetable protein from China.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to wheat gluten, products containing rice protein {{have also been}} contaminated with melamine.

25|$|The 2007 {{pet food}} recalls {{comprise}} the contamination and wide recall of many brands of {{cat and dog}} foods beginning in March 2007, and the ensuing developments involving the human food supply. The recalls in North America, Europe, and South Africa came in response to reports of renal failure in pets. Initially, the recalls {{were associated with the}} consumption of mostly wet pet foods made with wheat gluten from a single Chinese company. After more than three weeks of complaints from consumers, the recall began voluntarily with the Canadian company Menu Foods on 16 March 2007, when a company test showed sickness and death in some of the test animals. Soon after, there were numerous media reports of animal deaths as a result of kidney failure. In the following weeks, several other companies who received the contaminated wheat gluten also voluntarily recalled dozens of pet food brands. One month after the initial recall, contaminated rice protein from a different source in China was also identified as being associated with kidney failure in pets in the United States, while contaminated <b>corn</b> <b>gluten</b> was associated with kidney failure with pets in South Africa. As a result of investigating the 2007 pet food recalls, a broader Chinese protein export contamination investigation unfolded, raising concerns about the safety of the human food supply.|$|E

40|$|Este trabalho foi realizado em duas etapas, com o objetivo de avaliar o efeito dos glutens de milho e trigo, e do farelo de soja, em substituição ao fígado bovino no crescimento de pós-larvas de piava (Leporinus obtusidens). Na primeira etapa, foram elaboradas rações com glúten de trigo ou milho, em substituição ao fígado bovino nos níveis de 25, 50 e 100 %. O glúten de trigo foi mais eficiente que o de milho como substituto do fígado bovino, sendo que até 40 % de substituição proporciona maior tamanho e sobrevivência das pós-larvas. Na segunda etapa, foi avaliada a substituição dos 40 % de glúten de trigo por farelo de soja, em níveis crescentes de 25, 50, 75 e 100 %. A substituição do glúten de trigo por farelo de soja em até 75 %, apresenta os melhores índices para pós-larvas de piava, aos 21 dias de idade.

50|$|Bread machine {{recipes are}} often {{somewhat}} smaller than standard bread recipes, and are sometimes standardized {{based on the}} capacity of the machine's pan; most common in the United States market are 1.5 lb/700g units, and the majority of recipes are written for that capacity; however, 2 lb/900g units are not uncommon either. Packaged bread mixes are available, specifically designed for breadmakers, containing premeasured ingredients including flour and yeast, as well as flavorings and occasionally dough conditioners. Only water usually needs to be added. Bread machines generally do not deal well with non-wheat flours, so any recipe that requires a substantial addition of a grain such as rye or <b>corn</b> that lacks <b>gluten</b> will prove difficult at best in a bread machine, as will any dough with unusually large amounts of liquid (such as ciabatta).|$|R
50|$|Some {{people have}} allergies or sensitivities to foods {{which are not}} {{problematic}} to most people. This occurs when a person's immune system mistakes a certain food protein for a harmful foreign agent and attacks it. About 2% of adults and 8% of children have a food allergy. The amount of the food substance required to provoke a reaction in a particularly susceptible individual can be quite small. In some instances, traces of food in the air, too minute to be perceived through smell, {{have been known to}} provoke lethal reactions in extremely sensitive individuals. Common food allergens are <b>gluten,</b> <b>corn,</b> shellfish (mollusks), peanuts, and soy. Allergens frequently produce symptoms such as diarrhea, rashes, bloating, vomiting, and regurgitation.

40|$|The {{color of}} the egg yolk depends on the {{absorption}} and the deposition of carotenoids present in the hens´ diets and represents a sensory characteristic of great impact on the product acceptance. Corn is commonly used as energy value ingredient for hens´ diets formulations. Moreover, due to its additional pigmentation properties, it {{might be used to}} color egg yolk. The purpose of this research was to optimize the proportions between yellow and red pigments in hens´ corn based rations to provide color maximization for yolks. Sixty Dekalbe laying hens were separately distributed in cages inside a rearing barn to receive the experimental diets for 21 days at a daily feeding of 110 g and water ad libitum. Fifteen treatments were defined by means of a central composite rotatable design in which the variables were the yellow pigments from the diets (<b>corn</b> + <b>gluten</b> meal), the yellow supplementary pigments (lutein + zeaxanthin) and the red supplementary pigments (cantaxanthin), each of them at three different concentrations. Hens´ weights were recorded at the beginning {{and at the end of}} the experiment and the eggs weights were recorded daily. Yolks colors were determined by means of objective (L, a, b) and subjective (color fan) measurements. Global acceptance of yolks color was investigated with a five points hedonic scale. The results were analyzed by ANOVA, means comparison tests (t test and Dunn test) and regression analysis by Response Surface Methodology, at 5 % significance level. Hens` final weights and eggs weights were not influenced by the treatments. Seven distinct colors for yolks were identified with the color fan. The most preferred yolks scored 9 and derived from the treatment which provided the highest yellow pigments concentrations (2. 0 mg/hen/day) and no red pigments while the most rejected yolks scored 14 and derived from treatments which provided the highest concentration of red pigment (0. 7 mg/hen/day), besides the yellow [...] ...|$|R

40|$|Why has {{my patient}} come up {{reactive}} to foods {{claimed to have}} not been eaten? 1) Many foods that a patient may claim to have not eaten are foods which are commonly hidden, such as dairy, additives and preservatives, wheat/ <b>gluten,</b> <b>corn,</b> various sugars, potatoes, soy and eggs. Be sure your patient has not unknowingly eaten them as hidden ingredients in other foods. Most exposures occur in restaurants, friends’ homes, and eating prepared and commercial foods. 2) Your patient may have a cross-reac-tive response to that particular item. For example, there may be immune recogni-tion of an antigen specific to that item {{that is similar to}} another already immu-nologically reactive antigen. This could be a gut pathogen, related food (similar plant or animal species) or chemical. As an example, your patient may be reactive to potatoes, tomatoes, tobacco, and eggplant and claim they have never eaten eggplant. These foods are all in the nightshade family of plants and have similar antigens. Therefore, your patient may be responding to the eggplant due to cross reactivity. 3) Your patient may be reacting to a contaminant in the food item such as a pesticide. Contaminant reactions are not common but are increasingly becoming a problem...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe use of edible {{films to}} release {{antimicrobial}} constituents in food packaging {{is a form}} of active packaging that contributes to extend the shelf-life of a product and provides microbial safety for consumers. A number of plant and animal proteins have been investigated for the production of edible films such as <b>corn</b> zein, wheat <b>gluten,</b> soy and peanut proteins, gelatin, collagen, casein, and whey proteins. Several antimicrobial agents such as organic acids, enzymes, fungicides and natural antimicrobial compounds (spices and essential oils) can be incorporated into edible films. Potassium sorbate (PS) have a long history as a generally recognized as safe food preservative, being widely used to inhibit or retard the growing of a number of recognized food pathogens. Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) O 157 and non-O 157 strains have been associated with human disease, ranging from uncomplicated diarrhea to hemorrhagic colitis and hemolytic uremic syndrome. STEC is transmitted to humans through contaminated food, water, and direct contact with infected persons or animals. Several outbreaks caused by non-O 157 STEC were described although data implicating these STEC were scanty and the source of infection was not always known. Therefore, the objective {{of the present study was}} to incorporate PS into whey protein concentrate (WPC) films and to determine the inhibitory effects of these films against eight non-O 157 STEC strains isolated from readyto-eat food samples...|$|R
40|$|Bioplastics can be {{manufactured}} from protein or carbohydrate {{sources such as}} wheat <b>gluten,</b> <b>corn,</b> sun flower, keratin, casein, soy, gelatine and whey. A recently developed bioplastic is Novatein thermoplastic (NTP), which is produced from bloodmeal by adding water, urea, sodium sulphite, sodium dodecyl sulphate and tri-ethylene glycol (TEG), allowing it to be extruded and injection moulded. Bioplastics, compared to their petroleum counterparts, can readily adsorb or lose water, which then changes their physical properties such as tensile strength and glass transition temperature. NTP at different TEG and water contents was exposed to 20 - 85 % relative humidity (RH) environments and change in mass recorded over 35 days to determine equilibrium and dynamic moisture adsorption behavior. Equilibrium behavior was modelled using modified Freundlich and Langmuir- Freundlich isotherms, and dynamic behavior modelled using Pilosof, Singh- ulshrestha, exponential, Langmuir-Freundlich and simple rate equations. Excellent fits were obtained for both isotherms and the last three rate equations gave best overall fits for dynamics. NTP adsorbed up to 28 % by weight in water at 85 % RH, reaching equilibrium within 20 days. Plastics with high TEG had a greater affinity for water but lower water adsorption rates, while dry plastic samples had a lower adsorption rate than wet samples. The two parameter Freundlich model and the exponential or simple rate model is recommended for modelling NTP equilibrium and dynamic water adsorption...|$|R

40|$|Summary. The {{analysis}} of structure of starch containing raw materials processing in Russia Federation {{is provided in}} the article. There was noted an increase in volumes of corn and wheat processing, however the share of processed potato is still low (below 4 %). It was established that Russian starch products and starch sweeteners {{are on the same}} level on quality as best European samples and they are very competitive. Market demand in crystalline glucose for food and medical purposes (over 30 thous. tons) is fully covered by import. The volume of import of modified starches exceeds 80 % of total consumption. The biggest volume of import among native starches belongs to potato starch – over 60 %. The article provides suggestions on import substitution of mentioned starch products. The growth of starch production in Russia was accompanied by concentration of production at large enterprises. So, in 2013 over 90 % of glucose syrup was produced at six enterprises, over 80 % of dry starch – at five enterprises. Efficiency of corn and wheat processing into starch and starch products is achieved by production and selling of co-products (dry <b>gluten,</b> <b>gluten,</b> <b>corn</b> germ or corn oil, corn extract, feed products). Development of starch sweeteners production from starch could be achieved by expanding the consumption areas of different kinds of glucose syrup and production of glucose-fructose syrups as full substitute of sugar, providing import substitution of sugar, crystalline glucose of food and medicine purpose, deep processing of glucose into polyols (sorbit, maltit), polylactites, aminoacids...|$|R
