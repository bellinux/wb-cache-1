40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to achieve a quick and simple {{quantitative}} and qualitative method to detect even the trace amount of added soda in raw milk, since the existing tests methods are not applied in practical and real terms. For this purpose, after determining the microbiological and chemical characteristics of the raw milk, the samples were divided into 4 groups. Each group was added by different values of lactic acid, and then different rates of soda were added to the samples. Tests for acidity, pH value, electrical <b>conductivity,</b> alcohol, <b>ash</b> and Rosalic acid were conducted. According to the results with increasing the amount of soda, the electrical <b>conductivity</b> and total <b>ash</b> were increased, however the acidity was decreased. No significant correlation was observed between the added soda and pH value. Alcohol test had the same results on all samples. Rosalic acid test was negative in all treatments. In the case of alkaline ash, in none of the samples the volume of hydrochloric acid consumed reached to 1. 2 ml. It was concluded that Rosalic acid test did not work for the detection of soda in raw milk; in addition alkaline ash test did not specify the small amounts of soda.

40|$|AbstractPeatland {{ecosystems}} are valued as natural archives of past climatic and vegetation changes {{and as such}} their study is essential for palaeoenvironmental reconstructions over millennia. Fires in peatlands are dominated by smouldering combustion which is the self-sustained, slow, low temperature, flameless form of burning. Most studies on peat fires to date have focused on ignition conditions, C losses or atmospheric emissions, {{but there is a}} significant gap in the understanding of the evolution of organic matter (OM) following smouldering. A key feature of smouldering fires is that they consume most of the pyrogenic char produced. Consequently, it may be that most smouldering fires are simply not visible using standard palaeontological techniques. Here we present the possibility of identifying palaeofires by following their physical and chemical signature along a peat profile. We have undertaken laboratory experiments on Sphagnum peat columns and measured physical, chemical and spectroscopic changes of OM features induced by smouldering on samples of varying moisture content. We reveal that there is a higher production of aromatic and condensed molecules, an increase of the total N and a decrease of the C/N ratio, besides significant variations of pH, electrical <b>conductivity</b> and <b>ash</b> content. Several of these changes have, in previous studies, been taken to be indicative of alterations in atmospheric dust deposition and climate-driven changes (e. g., vegetation, water table fluctuation, decomposition and mineralization processes), but are also produced by smouldering fires. Our results imply that smouldering fires should therefore also be considered in climatic and floral reconstructions drawn from peat cores and that these additional physical and chemical changes may serve to enhance our understanding of palaeofire histories...|$|R

Municipal solid waste (MSW), MSW incineration ash, and mining wastes {{were included in the}} analysis. Spatial and temporal variations of waste temperatures, thermal gradients, thermal properties of wastes, average temperature differentials, and heat generation values are provided. Heat generation was influenced by climatic conditions, mean annual earth temperatures, waste temperatures at the time of placement, cover conditions, and inherent heat generation potential of the specific wastes. Time to onset of heat generation varied between months and years, whereas timelines for overall duration of heat generation varied between years and decades. For MSW, measured waste temperatures were as high as 60 – 90 °C and as low as − 6 °C. MSW incinerator ash temperatures varied between 5 and 87 °C. Mining waste temperatures were in the range of − 25 to 65 °C. In the wastes analyzed, upward heat flow toward the surface was more prominent than downward heat flow toward the subsurface. Thermal gradients generally were higher for MSW and incinerator ash and lower for mining waste. Based on thermal properties, MSW had insulative qualities (low thermal conductivity), while mining wastes typically were relatively conductive (high thermal <b>conductivity)</b> with <b>ash</b> having intermediate qualities. Heat generation values ranged from − 8. 6 to 83. 1 MJ/m 3 and from 0. 6 to 72. 6 MJ/m 3 for MSW and mining waste, respectively and was 72. 6 MJ/m 3 for ash waste.

40|$|Ash {{plays an}} {{important}} role in controlling runoff and erosion processes after wildfire and has frequently been hypothesised to clog soil pores and reduce infiltration. Yet evidence for clogging is incomplete, as research has focussed on identifying the presence of ash in soil; the actual flow processes remain unknown. We conducted laboratory infiltration experiments coupled with microscope observations in pure sands, saturated hydraulic conductivity analysis, and interaction energy calculations, to test whether ash can clog pores (i. e. block pores such that infiltration is hampered and ponding occurs). Although results confirmed previous observations of ash washing into pores, clogging was not observed in the pure sands tested, nor were conditions found for which this does occur. Clogging by means of strong attachment of ash to sand was deemed unlikely given the negative surface charge of the two materials. Ponding due to washing in of ash was also considered improbable given the high saturated <b>conductivity</b> of pure <b>ash</b> and ash-sand mixtures.

The highest concentration was observed for iron, copper, nickel, manganese, zinc, chromium, cobalt and cadmium in that order. The highest concentration of metals was observed in Adigrat honey and then Hagereselam, Abiy Adi, Hawezene and the least for Atsbi. DOI: [URL]...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} was {{undertaken}} to determine the heavy metal levels and the physicochemical parameters (pH, electrical <b>conductivity</b> (EC), and <b>ash,</b> moisture, and total sugar content) of honeys from Bangladesh. Three different floral honeys were investigated, namely, khalsi (Aegiceras corniculatum), mustard (Brassica juncea), and litchi (Litchi chinensis) honeys. The heavy metals in the honeys were determined by using a High Temperature Dry Oxidation method followed by Atomic Absorption Spectroscopy. The mean pH, EC, and ash, moisture, and total sugar contents of the investigated honeys were 3. 6, 0. 51 [*]mS/cm, 0. 18 %, 18. 83 %, and 68. 30 %, respectively. Iron was the most abundant among all the investigated heavy metals, ranging from 13. 51 to 15. 44 [*]mg/kg. The mean concentrations of Mn and Zn in the investigated honeys were 0. 28 [*]mg/kg and 2. 99 [*]mg/kg, respectively. Cd was below the detection limit, and lead was found in some honey samples, but their contents were below the recommended Maximum Acceptable Level. Cr was also found {{in all of the}} samples, but its concentration was within the limit. The physicochemical analysis of the honey samples yielded levels within the limits set by the international honey legislation, indicating that the honey samples were of good quality and had acceptable values for maturity, purity, and freshness...|$|R
40|$|The {{exposure}} to nicotine, sugar and trace elements in tobacco {{are associated with}} health risks including inflammation, sensitization and carcinogenesis. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the physicochemical properties of tobacco used in the cigarette brands available in Pakistan. Physical properties such as moisture, volatile matters, <b>ash,</b> pH, <b>conductivity,</b> and total reducing sugar were measured using standard procedures. Heavy metals, toxic metals, and nicotine were determined using atomic absorption spectrophotometer, flame photometry, and liquid chromatography, respectively. Local, and local branded samples were found to be rich with iron and magnesium and safe in terms of lower copper content when compared with the branded samples and other reported data of different countries of the world. Significant differences (p < 0. 05) have been observed in the values of <b>ash,</b> <b>conductivity,</b> iron, zinc, copper, nickel, cobalt, magnesium, lithium, sodium, and potassium in local, local branded and branded samples. The samples of different brands were discriminated and characterized on the basis of metal contents using statistical techniques such as multivariate analysis, and analysis of means. The properties of the local samples were found close to that of the local branded samples showing the same origin of tobacco leaves. On the basis of conducted study, it is concluded that more strict regulations are needed for import and export of cigarettes...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to examine the various chemical properties of the honey samples acquired from 20 different locations in the Hizan district of the Bitlis province. All samples were acquired from the apiarists who are members of the Hizan Beekepers Association. To this end; analyses have been carried out for moisture, insoluble solid substance, diastasis activity, electrical <b>conductivity,</b> proline, <b>ash,</b> total sugar, free acidity, HMF, fructose ratio, glucose ratio, fructose/glucose ratio in 100 gr., fructose+glucose amount in 100 gr. in terms of grams. The moisture values of the samples were determined to vary between % 15. 44 - % 17. 28, insoluble solid substance amount was determined to vary between % 0. 001 - % 0. 080, diastasis number between 10. 0 mg/ 100 gr - 26. 1 mg/ 100 gr, electrical conductivity value between 0. 18 ms/cm- 1 - 0. 25 ms/cm- 1, proline amount between 414. 2 mg/kg - 880. 8 mg/kg, ash amount between % 0. 01 - % 0. 07, total sugar average between % 69. 09 - % 75. 28, free acidity value between 16. 0 meq/kg - 26. 1 meq/kg, HMF value between 6. 5 mg/kg - 20. 8 mg/kg, fructose ratio between 27. 9 mg/ 100 gr - 41. 3 mg/ 100 gr, glucose ratio between 30. 6 mg/ 100 gr - 34. 6 mg/ 100 gr, fructose/glucose ratio between 1. 19 gr/ 100 gr - 1. 28 gr/ 100 gr, fructose+glucose amount in 100 grams in terms of grams was determined to vary between 67. 5 gr/ 100 gr - 75. 9 gr/ 100 gr. It was determined that none of the honey samples contained maltose and that only the samples acquired from Gayda and Keklik villages had very small amounts such as 2. 7 mg/ 100 gr and 2. 1 mg/ 100 gr. It was determined as a result of the studies carried out on the honey samples that especially proline amount was high. The fact that there was no sucrose in any of the honey samples except two put forth that no sugar has been used for feeding the bees. It was observed that the results were in accordance with the EU standards as well as the Turkish Food Codex Notification on Honey...|$|R
40|$|Background: Newfoundland and Labrador (NL) {{has one of}} {{the highest}} waste {{disposal}} rates in Canada and it has 200 small communities without access to central composting facilities. During Municipal solid waste (MSW) composting, the selection of bulking agents is critical. Bench-scale composting systems plus locally available bulking agents are thus desired for economic and effective MSW management in NL communities. This study evaluated the performance of locally available bulking agents (i. e., NL sawdust and peat) during MSW composting in a bench-scale system. Physiochemical (temperature, oxygen uptake rate, pH, electrical <b>conductivity,</b> moisture and <b>ash</b> content, and C/N ratio) and biological (enzyme activities and germination index) parameters were monitored to evaluate compost maturity and stability. Results: In peat composting, higher temperature for a longer duration was observed, indicating more effective pathogen removal and sterilization. High enzyme activities of dehydrogenase, β-glucosidase, and phosphodiesterase in the third week of composting imply high microbial activity and high decomposition rate. The low C/N ratio for compost product implies acceptable stability states. In sawdust composting, higher temperature and oxygen uptake rate (OUR) were observed in the third week of composting, and higher enzyme activities in the second week. Sawdust composting generated a higher germination index, indicating higher maturity. Conclusions: Both sawdust and peat are effective bulking agents for the bench-scale composting. The choice of a bulking agent for a particular community depends on the availability of the agent and land in the region, convenience of transportation, price, and the expected quality of the compost product...|$|R
