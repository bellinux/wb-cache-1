Jeff dispatches Scott in Thunderbird 1, while Virgil and Alan take off in Thunderbird 2 equipped with newly commissioned fire-fighting apparatus. Lowered into the shaft in a protective cage fitted with diacetylene sprinklers, Virgil and Alan clamp the stricken lift and return to ground level, whereupon Prescott is arrested. Police Commissioner Garfield notes that classified documentation regarding <b>criminal</b> <b>organisations,</b> including the Erdman Gang, has been destroyed in the fire. Prescott's claims about the hitch-hiker are validated when the charred remnants of the bracelet are discovered.|$|E

25|$|In some circles, it is {{considered}} bad luck to depict a dragon facing downwards, as {{it is seen as}} disrespectful to place a dragon in such manner that it cannot ascend to the sky. Also, depictions of dragons in tattoos are prevalent as they are symbols of strength and power, especially <b>criminal</b> <b>organisations</b> where dragons hold a meaning all on their own. As such, it is believed that one must be fierce and strong enough, hence earning the right to wear the dragon on his skin, lest his luck be consumed by the dragons.|$|E

25|$|The Italian {{judicial}} system {{is based on}} Roman law modified by the Napoleonic code and later statutes. The Supreme Court of Cassation is the highest court in Italy for both criminal and civil appeal cases. The Constitutional Court of Italy (Corte Costituzionale) rules on the conformity of laws with the constitution and is a post–World War II innovation. Since their appearance {{in the middle of}} the 19th century, Italian organised crime and <b>criminal</b> <b>organisations</b> have infiltrated the social and economic life of many regions in Southern Italy, the most notorious of which being the Sicilian Mafia, which would later expand into some foreign countries including the United States. Mafia receipts may reach 9% of Italy's GDP.|$|E
25|$|The Directorate of Military Intelligence National Security Intelligence Section (NSIS) {{deals with}} {{threats to the}} state and the Defence Forces. This {{includes}} identifying, monitoring and assessing possible threats {{to the state and}} Irish national interests at home and abroad, be it by hostile intelligence services, terrorist groups and/or <b>criminal</b> <b>organisations.</b> Counter-intelligence forms {{a large part of the}} section's remit, in addition to fulfilling counter-terrorist, counter-subversion, counter-insurgency, counter-sabotage roles, and physical security of critical infrastructure. The National Security Intelligence Section works very closely with the Garda SDU and Garda National Surveillance Unit (NSU) to spy on potential terrorism threats, particularly from Islamic terrorists and dissident republicans. Military Intelligence have a number of Arabic speakers in their ranks as a result of Defence Forces deployments overseas. NSIS members can conduct interrogations of suspects alongside Gardaí.|$|E
25|$|The {{government}} hastily approved several special {{laws for}} {{use during the}} Stammheim trial. Lawyers were excluded from trial {{for the first time}} since 1945, after being accused of various inappropriate actions, such as helping to form <b>criminal</b> <b>organisations</b> (Section 129, Criminal Law). The authorities invaded and checked the lawyers' offices for possible incriminating material. Minister of Justice Hans-Jochen Vogel stated proudly that no other Western state had such an extensive regulation to exclude defense attorneys from the trial. Klaus Croissant, Hans-Christian Ströbele, Kurt Groenewold, who had been working preparing for the trial for three years were expelled the second day of the trial. On 23 June (1975), Croissant, Ströbele (who had already been expelled) and Mary Becker were arrested, and in the meantime police invaded several defense attorneys' offices and homes, seizing several documents and files. Ströbele and Croissant were remanded and held for 4 weeks and 8 weeks accordingly. Croissant had to pay 80,000 Deutschmarks, to report weekly to police station as well as having his transport and identity papers seized.|$|E

25|$|Guy {{makes an}} {{appearance}} in UDON's Street Fighter II Turbo comic, {{in which he}} was given an invitation to fight in the Japanese branch of the Street Fighter Tournament by M. Bison. Dan tries to take Guy's invitation from him by force, yet is quickly defeated. At night, Dan breaks into Guy's house and steals his invitation; Guy witnesses the whole event, but decides to give Dan a chance, as he was not planning on joining the competition in the first place. Guy also appears in the manga adaptation of Street Fighter Alpha by Masahiko Nakahira, where he is depicted as a well-known vigilante ninja credited with bringing an end to several <b>criminal</b> <b>organisations.</b> Guy disguised himself as a member of Shadaloo to face M. Bison, but he is forced to reveal his identity when Vega tries to kill both Adon and a possessed Ryu. After making quick work of Vega, Guy kicks several oil drums at Ryu (a nod to the Final Fight series), then proceeds to fight Ryu. Due to Guy's superior speed and training to fight multiple enemies at once, Guy is able to block every attack from Ryu's Shun Goku Satsu and defeat him. He is last seen watching over the battle between Ryu and Sagat.|$|E
500|$|Despite Olympus' denials, {{the matter}} quickly snowballed into a {{corporate}} corruption scandal over concealment (called tobashi) {{of more than}} 117.7 billion yen ($1.5 billion) of investment losses and other dubious fees and other payments {{dating back to the}} late 1980s and suspicion of covert payments to <b>criminal</b> <b>organisations.</b> On 26 October, Kikukawa was replaced by Shuichi Takayama as chairman, president, and CEO. On 8 November 2011, the company admitted that the company's accounting practice was [...] "inappropriate" [...] and that money had been used to cover losses on investments dating to the 1990s. The company blamed the inappropriate accounting on former president Tsuyoshi Kikukawa, auditor Hideo Yamada and executive vice-president Hisashi Mori.|$|E
500|$|On {{the issue}} of nationality, Livingstone has {{expressed}} the view that he identifies as English rather than British, although his father was Scottish and he supports {{the continued existence of}} the United Kingdom. Although raised into a nominally Christian family, Livingstone renounced religious belief when he was eleven, becoming an atheist. In a 2005 interview he commented that in doing so he had rejected [...] "mumbo-jumbo in favour of rational science." [...] He is known for his enthusiasm for gardening and keeping and breeding newts. He {{was the first person to}} breed the Western Dwarf Clawed Frog Hymenochirus curtipes in captivity. Livingstone is a big fan of The Godfather film franchise, stating that the actions of the <b>criminal</b> <b>organisations</b> within the movies are very much akin to the world of politics.|$|E

500|$|The 100-page {{screenplay}} detailed plot {{developments and}} many of the visual traits, but very little dialogue was scripted, so the actors were asked to improvise their lines. Noé explained this approach: [...] "For me, directing actors is just finding the right people and putting them in the right mood on the set and letting them go. ... I think the energy has to come on the set at the very last minute." [...] Locations were used in Kabukichō and other parts of Shinjuku. Since much of the film was set in neighbourhoods known for gambling and prostitution, the producers made agreements with the Yakuza crime syndicates before filming some of the on-location scenes. <b>Criminal</b> <b>organisations</b> were not involved in the actual production. Studio scenes set in Tokyo were filmed at Toho Studios. More scenes than originally planned had to be filmed in the studio because of the many complicated crane arrangements. Some of the overhead sequences took a full day to arrange and film. The scenes where Oscar is alive were mostly shot on location, but the crane shots were exclusively taken in the studio; this included revisits to some of the previous locations, which were replicated as large indoor sets. Other shots were taken from helicopters flying over the city. Much attention was paid to the continuity of the geography, and filming was overseen by a supervisor from the visual-effects team.|$|E
500|$|Manstein {{was moved}} to Nuremberg in October 1945. He {{was held at the}} Palace of Justice, the {{location}} of the Nuremberg Trials of major Nazi war criminals and organisations. While there, Manstein helped prepare a 132-page document for the defence of the General Staff and the OKW, on trial at Nuremberg in August 1946. The myth that the Wehrmacht was [...] "clean"—not culpable for the events of the Holocaust—arose {{partly as a result of}} this document, written largely by Manstein, along with General of Cavalry Siegfried Westphal. He also gave oral testimony about the Einsatzgruppen, the treatment of prisoners of war, and the concept of military obedience, especially as related to the Commissar Order, an order issued by Hitler in 1941, requiring all Soviet political commissars to be shot without trial. Manstein admitted that he received the order, but said he did not carry it out. Documents from 1941 presented at Nuremberg and at Manstein's own later trial contradict this claim: He actually received regular reports throughout that summer regarding the execution of hundreds of political commissars. He denied any knowledge of the activities of the Einsatzgruppen, and testified that soldiers under his command were not involved in the murder of Jewish civilians. Otto Ohlendorf, commander of Einsatzgruppe D, contradicted this during his testimony, saying that not only was Manstein aware of what was happening but that the Eleventh Army was involved. In September 1946, the General Staff and the OKW were declared to not be <b>criminal</b> <b>organisations.</b>|$|E

2500|$|The {{economic}} paradigm was prevalent {{when the}} Italian Penal Code definition of criminal conspiracy (Article 416) was extended by Pio La Torre.

[...] The term Mafia-type organisations is used to clearly distinguish the uniquely Sicilian Mafia from other <b>criminal</b> <b>organisations</b> – such as the Camorra, the 'Ndrangheta, the Sacra Corona Unita – that are structured like the Mafia but are not the Mafia. According to historian Salvatore Lupo, [...] "if everything is Mafia, nothing is Mafia." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Māori Party {{condemned}} the raids, with the MP for Waiariki, Te Ururoa Flavell, criticising {{the police for}} putting a community in his electorate [...] "under siege," [...] referring to the roadblocks imposed on the town of Ruatoki. Co-leader Pita Sharples said the action had violated the trust that has been developing between Maori and Pakeha and had set race-relations back a hundred years. The Green Party was also critical, with co-leader Jeanette Fitzsimons saying the raids traumatised the local population. The party later joined protests in Auckland to pressure the government to withdraw the Terrorism Suppression Amendment and called for those arrested to be released on bail. MP Keith Locke told TVNZ that the party would continue to protest until those held in custody are released. In contrast, New Zealand First, MP Ron Mark stated that the police should be congratulated, and suggested a link between criminal gangs and the [...] "suspected terrorist groups." [...] He called for the anti-terrorism laws to be expanded to [...] "outlaw <b>criminal</b> <b>organisations</b> such as gangs once and for all". Aaron Loyd of the New Zealand Law Society {{pointed out that the}} legislation could already be used against gangs.
