Echoing aspects discussed about sustainability and organization (long-term technical support), as well as dissemination and implementation of <b>COAR</b> controlled vocabularies, the immediate projection of these issues has seemed to be quite feasible on PHAIDRA International long-term ecosystem. Nowadays this OAI-PMH environment consists of fourteen Open Access repositories disseminating their contents to EUROPEANA, OpenAIRE, OAPENLibrary, e-infrastructures Austria, and national CRIS etc. PHAIDRA International is taking all necessary steps to be constantly aligned with Trusted Digital Repositories criteria and harmonized (technically and semantically) in line with <b>COAR</b> Roadmap: Future Directions for Repository Interoperability. The <b>COAR</b> Roadmap stresses that still many challenges remain with improving interoperability. These involve standardization of controlled vocabularies in use, as well as metadata and indicators, in connection with state-of-the-art interoperability approaches supporting Linked Open Data.

40|$|The {{vision of}} the Confederation of Open Access Repositories (<b>COAR)</b> is a sustainable, global {{knowledge}} commons based on a network of open access digital repositories. In order to realize this vision, <b>COAR</b> works to align policies, standards and practices across the repository community. Part of this work involves semantic interoperability across repositories and repository networks. The <b>COAR</b> Interest Group “Controlled Vocabularies for Repository Assets” is developing a set of controlled vocabularies for the bibliographic metadata elements used describing research outputs. Controlled vocabularies offer a uniform standard terminology for describing content, and assist with resource discovery, sharing and reuse of metadata and content, as well as integration between different systems. This helps systems to inter-operate and become compliant with the open science principles. <b>COAR</b> is promoting {{the adoption of the}} vocabularies by the repository community in order to improve interoperability across systems, organizations and regions. To that end, <b>COAR</b> has been working with the most common repository software platforms to have the vocabularies integrated directly into their workflows. The adoption of <b>COAR</b> Vocabularies is also encouraged in international and national guidelines for repository and CRIS managers such as the OpenAIRE Content Provider Guidelines, LA Referencia Guidelines and the German DINI Certificate for repositories. The <b>COAR</b> Vocabularies are also integrated and referenced in value added services like the the Phaidra Classification Server of University of Vienna in Austria, and Research Vocabularies Australia operated by the Australian National Data Service (ANDS). Harmonization of vocabulary terms with the CASRAI dictionaries and glossaries is an ongoing task. So far the <b>COAR</b> Controlled Vocabularies Interest Group has released two vocabularies: Resource Types, to identify the genre of a scholarly output and Access Rights, to declare its degree of openness. A third vocabulary about Version Types is now under review. These vocabularies are designed to be multilingual and currently support 14 languages. The vocabularies are implemented in the web standard SKOS and released for public reuse under Creative Commons CC BY 4. 0 license.

This organism also has cytosolic metal-sensors from three further families represented by Zn(II) -sensors ZiaR and Zur plus Ni(II) -sensor InrS. Here we discover by competition with Fura- 2 that <b>CoaR</b> has KCo(II) weaker than 7 × 10 − 8 M, which is weaker than ZiaR, Zur and InrS (KCo(II) = 6. 94 ± 1. 3 × 10 − 10 M; 4. 56 ± 0. 16 × 10 − 10 M; and 7. 69 ± 1. 1 × 10 − 9 M respectively). KCo(II) for <b>CoaR</b> is also {{weak in the}} CoaR–DNA adduct. Further, Co(II) promotes DNA-dissociation by ZiaR and DNA-association by Zur in vitro in a manner analogous to Zn(II), as monitored by fluorescence anisotropy.

A dynamic load balancing method is presented that balances the workload across all processors with a global view. After each parallel tetrahedral mesh adaption, the method first determines if the new mesh is sufficiently unbalanced to warrant a repartitioning. If so, the adapted mesh is repartitioned, with new partitions assigned to processors so that the redistribution cost is minimized. The new partitions are accepted only if the remapping cost is compensated by the improved load balance. Results indicate that this strategy is effective for large-scale scientific computations on distributed-memory multiprocessors. 1 Introduction Dynamic mesh adaption on unstructured grids {{is a powerful}} tool for computing unsteady three-dimensional problems that require grid modifications to efficiently resolve solution features.

The factors which govern selectivity across different sensor families from Synechocystis sp.

Zn 2 + bound and allosterically regulated recombinant ZiaR and Zur in vitro. Cu+ failed to allosterically regulate recombinant Zur and inhibited Zn 2 +-mediated allostery in vitro. In Δatx 1 ΔgshB Synechocystis cells, proposed to be defective in normal cytosolic Cu+ trafficking, copper toxicity and inhibition of Zn 2 +-mediated repression of Zur-regulated gene expression was detected, consistent with inhibition of Zn 2 +-sensing in vivo by Cu+ normally bound to Atx 1. Cu+ bound in preference to Zn 2 + at the α 3 N sites of recombinant ZiaR and was allosterically ineffective; however, divalent metal binding and allostery were retained at the α 5 sites in vitro. In Δatx 1 Synechocystis cells, enhanced ZiaR-dependent expression was observed with no copper-dependency suggesting Atx 1 also sequestered Zn 2 +. Hence, Atx 1 is proposed to restrict access to Zn 2 + and Cu+ ions in vivo. Co 2 + bound to recombinant Zur and ZiaR, impaired ZiaR binding to DNA in vitro but ZiaR does not respond to Co 2 + in vivo. Unexpectedly, the Co 2 + affinity of recombinant <b>CoaR</b> was weaker than ZiaR and Zur, and Zur acquired Co 2 + in preference to <b>CoaR</b> following direct competition.

The control module computes a representation of thread interference, as an incremen-tally constructed data flow graph, using the data invariants provided by the data module. These invariants are used to rule out patterns of thread interference that can not occur in a real program execu-tion.

The features of Indian coins of different denominations are considered for classification. Indian Coins are released with different values and dominations which are classified based on different parameters of coin such as shape, size, surface, radius and so on. Considering these factors, {{a system of}} Indian coin recognition has been created which recognizes Indian coins based on the technique of image subtraction. This process checks the radius, centroid, coarse and fine subtraction on the input image. The mentioned subsequent checks enable Rotation Invariance, which helps to place the coin at a certain angle by rotation. A subtraction between the input object image and database image is performed. A proposed method is a simple automatic coin recognition system. Image subtraction provides fast recognition with good accuracy.

In this paper, we are introducing a new symbolic image representation technique and an indexing scheme for spatial similarity-based retrieval of images. In this technique, an image is recursively decomposed into a spatial arrangement of distinct features to preserve the spatial information of image objects. This scheme is independent of image size, translation and rotation and is essentially domain independent. Quadtrees are used to manage the decomposition hierarchy and help in establishing a measure of similarity for the retrievals. This scheme is incremental in nature and allows matchatvarious levels of details, from coarse to fine.

We then present novel estimators for the dynamical effective charge during free solution electrophoresis and compare them to static estimators.

We further evaluate the scaling behaviour of the effective friction of the polyelectrolyte-counterion complex with the surrounding fluid.
