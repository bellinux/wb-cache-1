The increased labour shortage and redced profitability are growing concerns to the farmers. Keeping this, the paper written {{with the following}} objectives: i) To assess the profitability among different <b>cropping</b> <b>systems</b> in the semi-arid tropics; ii) To assess the labour use pattern among different <b>cropping</b> <b>systems</b> and farm size; iii) To determine the resource use efficiency of the different <b>cropping</b> <b>systems</b> in the SAT India; and finally iv) To assess the influence of regional/local factors on incomes of farmers in the SAT India. The study used plot wise data collected from 16 villages from four states namely Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Maharashtra and Gujarat for the crop year 2010 for an in-depth analysis of the profitability and labour use among different <b>cropping</b> <b>systems</b> in semi-arid tropics of India. And it also estimated the resource use efficiency especially labour across different farm size groups in the SAT India and finally to assess the influence of regional/local factors on profitability of farmers. The study shows that input intensive <b>cropping</b> <b>systems</b> like cotton, paddy, wheat, fruits and vegetables based <b>cropping</b> <b>systems</b> are more profitable across many of the SAT villages compared to coarse cereals, pulses and oilseeds based <b>cropping</b> <b>systems.</b> Moreover, the area under these <b>cropping</b> <b>systems</b> is increased in the dry lands due {{to the introduction of}} Bt cotton varieties, short duration varieties, price incentives and subsidies. Although pulses based <b>cropping</b> <b>systems</b> remain attractive due to higher prices and less labour requirement, needs to provide incentives to increase area given its environmental benefits in enriching the soil. Most of the villages are experiencing the shortage of labour as indicated by higher marginal productivity of labour and increasing trend of mechanisation. Farm size is having positive association with the hired labour use and farm mechanisation, but having negative association with family labour. Female employment has inverted “U” shape relation with farm size. This indicates that the farms with more than five hectares of land are detrimental to women employment as farm mechanization in large farms replaces women labour...|$|R

In this study, high spatial and temporal resolution RapidEye bio-temporal data were utilized within a novel 2 -step hierarchical random forest (RF) classification approach to map areas of mono- and mixed maize <b>cropping</b> <b>systems.</b> A small-scale maize farming site in Machakos County, Kenya {{was used as a}} study site. Within the study site, field data was collected during the satellite acquisition period on general land use/land cover (LULC) and the two <b>cropping</b> <b>systems.</b> Firstly, non-cropland areas were masked out from other land use/land cover using the LULC mapping result. Subsequently an optimized RF model was applied to the cropland layer to map the two <b>cropping</b> <b>systems</b> (2 nd classification step). An overall accuracy of 93 % was attained for the LULC classification, while the class accuracies (PA: producer’s accuracy and UA: user’s accuracy) for the two <b>cropping</b> <b>systems</b> were consistently above 85 %. We concluded that explicit mapping of different <b>cropping</b> <b>systems</b> is feasible in complex and highly fragmented agro-ecological landscapes if high resolution and multi-temporal satellite data such as 5 m RapidEye data is employed.

50|$|The {{effect of}} crop {{rotation}} on erosion control varies by climate. In regions under relatively consistent climate conditions, where annual rainfall and temperature levels are assumed, rigid crop rotations can produce sufficient plant growth and soil cover. In regions where climate conditions are less predictable, and unexpected periods {{of rain and}} drought may occur, a more flexible approach for soil cover by crop rotation is necessary. An opportunity <b>cropping</b> <b>system</b> promotes adequate soil cover under these erratic climate conditions. In an opportunity <b>cropping</b> <b>system,</b> crops are grown when soil water is adequate {{and there is a}} reliable sowing window. This form of <b>cropping</b> <b>system</b> is likely to produce better soil cover than a rigid crop rotation because crops are only sown under optimal conditions, whereas rigid systems are not necessarily sown in the best conditions available.|$|E

40|$|SUMMARY. <b>Cropping</b> <b>systems</b> {{have been}} central to {{managing}} associ-ated pests for centuries.

The evolving philosophy of IPM and the recently renewed emphasis on eco-logically based pest management address the fact that significant levels of predation and/or parasitism are desirable insofar as they promote di-versity and sustainability of agroecosystems. Thus, <b>cropping</b> <b>systems</b> are beginning to focus on soil and crop health as well as specific IPM and production goals.

40|$|Europe’s {{agriculture}} is highly specialized, dependent on external inputs and responsible for negative environmental impacts. Legume crops are grown {{on less than}} 2 % of the arable land and more than 70 % of the demand for protein feed supplement is imported from overseas. The integration of legumes into <b>cropping</b> <b>systems</b> {{has the potential to}} contribute to the transition to a more resource-efficient agriculture and reduce the current protein deficit. Legume crops influence the production of other crops in the rotation making it difficult to evaluate the overall agronomic effects of legumes in <b>cropping</b> <b>systems.</b> A novel assessment framework was developed and applied in five case study regions across Europe with the objective of evaluating trade-offs between economic and environmental effects of integrating legumes into <b>cropping</b> <b>systems.</b> Legumes resulted in positive and negative impacts when integrated into various <b>cropping</b> <b>systems</b> across the case studies. On average, <b>cropping</b> <b>systems</b> with legumes reduced nitrous oxide emissions by 18 % and 33 % and N fertilizer use by 24 % and 38 % in arable and forage systems, respectively, compared to systems without legumes. Nitrate leaching was similar with and without legumes in arable systems and reduced by 22 % in forage systems. However, grain legumes reduced gross margins in 3 of 5 regions. Forage legumes increased gross margins in 3 of 3 regions. Among the <b>cropping</b> <b>systems</b> with legumes, systems could be identified that had both relatively high economic returns and positive environmental impacts. Thus, increasing the cultivation of legumes could lead to economic competitive <b>cropping</b> <b>systems</b> and positive environmental impacts, but achieving this aim requires the development of novel management strategies informed by the involvement of advisors and farmers...|$|R

40|$|Organic farming, as a {{model of}} {{sustainable}} agriculture, requires key agro-ecological principles to be taken into account. In the implementation of these principles, significant differences exist across farmers, geographical areas and production systems. How is this heterogeneity expressed on farms? This paper studied the different organic management styles, defined as varying patterns of <b>cropping</b> <b>systems.</b> Based on a farm survey carried out with 17 organic cash-crop farmers in the grain-producing Île-de-France region, we developed a farm-scale multi-criteria method to assess the diversity of <b>cropping</b> <b>systems</b> in organic farms. We measured the ratio between preventive and corrective techniques, and thus evaluated the coherence of organic <b>cropping</b> <b>systems</b> with the key agronomic principles of organic agriculture. We identified three types of organic management styles representing the wide diversity of strategies related to varying patterns of <b>cropping</b> <b>systems.</b> The three types relate to various structural determinants of farms, agri-food systems and agronomic conditions. We go beyond the conventionalization debate on organic farming to show that farmers mix and match different techniques and that their <b>cropping</b> <b>systems</b> are predominantly hybrid forms which are not necessarily long lasting. Finally, our multi-criteria method provides a tool for diagnosing regional organic farming practices and agronomic problems...|$|R
