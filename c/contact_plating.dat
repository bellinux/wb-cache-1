40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to find factors and suggest {{solutions}} to improve the long-term thermal and electrical stability of ABB’s AC switch-disconnectors. The challenges are found and solution are proposed {{in the area of}} the contact design, surface treatment and arc interruption, regarding the switch thermal stability. Tests are made to verify the proposed solutions. In the switches, high temperature rise is caused by the formation of insulating layers on the contacts. It is because of the lubricant burning, the contact’s surface wearing, and arcing near the contacts. It is found out that a high thermally stable lubricant can keep the temperature-rise value low. The wearing of the contacts can be decreased by its design modification. Decreasing the arc energy during the contact breaking would decrease the temperature rise of the contacts. Solid lubricant as a <b>contact</b> <b>plating</b> has shown low temperature-rise by decreasing the wearing of the contact surface...|$|E

Coliforms were identified as Klebsiella pneumoniae and Enterobacter spp. In the present report, evidence is presented {{which suggests that the}} origin of these coliforms is from the wood used to construct the reservoirs. In liquid expressed from freshly cut redwood, total bacterial counts in the range of 10 (5) to 10 (6) /ml were commonly observed. When present, coliform counts were over 10 (3) /ml of expressed liquid. E. agglomerans was the most prevalent coliform present, but Klebsiella was isolated from freshly cut logs. Citrobacter freundii was also occasionally isolated. No fecal coliform-positive Klebsiella were obtained from any of the samples. Highest total bacteria and coliform counts were observed in sapwood specimens. Coliforms were present throughout sapwood as evidenced by <b>contact</b> <b>plating</b> serial sections of freshly cut wood.

40|$|One of the A. aurita medusa main mesoglea polypeptides, mesoglein, {{has been}} {{described}} previously. Mesoglein belongs to ZP-domain protein family and therefore we focused on A. aurita oogenesis. Antibodies against mesoglein (AB RA 47) stain the plate {{in the place where}} germinal epithelium contacts oocyte on the paraffin sections. According to its position, we named the structure found the "contact plate". Our main instrument was AB against mesoglein. ZP-domain occupies about half of the whole amino acid sequence of the mesoglein. Immunoblot after SDS-PAGE and AU-PAGE reveals two charged and high M(r) bands among the female gonad germinal epithelium polypeptides.

40|$|Fretting {{corrosion}} {{is a form}} of accelerated atmo-spheric oxidation {{which occurs}} at the interface of con-tacting materials undergoing slight, cyclic relative mo-tion. In electric contacts involving non-noble metals, fretting action can cause rapid increases in contact re-sistance, proceeding to virtual open circuits {{in a matter of minutes}} in the worst cases. Experimental results of resistance increase due to fretting action are given for 36 different <b>contact</b> <b>plating</b> combinations, including hard and soft materials and noble as well as non-noble metals. Effects of contact load, both mechanical and electrical, were studied. The results show that all non-noble metals are susceptible to some degree to fretting corrosion and will suffer contact resistance increases. The beneficial effects of boundary lubricants are dem-onstrated. Fretting corrosion phenomena were studied on a laboratory test rig designed to produce a particularly damaging fretting motion. Actual and simulated con-nector configurations were also tested and found to ex-hibit similar trends in resistance increase, but at a slower rate. Differential thermal expansion is identified as one source of fretting motion in connectors...|$|E
40|$|Increasing the {{reliability}} of high power diode laser bars as a viable photon source in pumping and direct applications is necessary as increased reliability reduces costs and makes diode lasers more attractive for use. High stress levels and high thermal loads are the limiting factors for the lifetime of diode lasers. Large amounts of stress {{can be caused by}} the packaging process due to the expansion mismatch of the semiconductor and heat sink materials. Ductile solder is used to compensate for the mismatch. By using an expansion matched submount, a brittle solder such as gold-tin can be used. At the same time, due to the lower thermal conductivity of this expansion matched material, the thermal load increases. Here, the effects of expansion matching work against the reduction of the thermal load. For higher reliability of diode lasers, the packaging induced stress and thermal load need to be reduced. The thermal and mechanical influence of the packaging process on diode laser bars is described. One method to reduce mechanical strain is to use expansion matched heat sinks. To demonstrate this, expansion matched packages using two different types of actively cooled expansion matched heat sinks were developed. The integrated design has the advantage of having low thermal resistance. As the simulated as well as the experimental results show, the expansion mismatch of the expansion matched heat sink is nearly 1 ppm/K, instead of the 10 ppm/K mismatch seen in a conventional copper package. The thermal resistance is 0. 55 K/W compared to 0. 45 KW seen in the reference copper heat sink. The expansion matched heat sink increases the thermal load when compared with copper heat sinks. Stress measurements show that the stress is also reduced by a factor of 2. 5. These results lead to an increase in the lifetime of diode lasers mounted on these expansion matched heat sinks compared to the reference bars packaged on copper heat sinks. The FEM-simulations have been confirmed as accurate, so that this simulation tool can be used to design new types of expansion matched heat sinks with advanced materials such as diamond composites. Another method utilised to reduce mechanical stress, which is also used in standard packages with copper heat sinks, is to optimise the solder layer. The soft and ductile indium solder has the task of reducing the packaging induced stress during plastic deformation. The possibility of reducing stress by adapting the solder metallurgy was investigated in detail. Diffusion takes place during the soldering process which allows all of the gold available in the <b>contact</b> <b>plating</b> of the heat sink and the laser bar to diffuse into the indium solder. There, the brittle AuIn 2 intermetallic compound is formed. It is shown that the possibility of plastic deformation decreases with an increase of the intermetallic compound fraction. If the indium layer is thick enough, the intermetallic compound has nearly no influence on the relaxation behaviour of the solder joint. The thermal influence of a thicker solder layer {{is similar to that of}} a thin solder layer. Simulations and experiments show that the temperature increases caused by increasing the thickness from 2 µm to 10 µm is less than 1 K. The increased solder thickness is a way to reduce significantly the packaging induced stress for packages on copper heat sinks and has nearly no effect on the thermal behaviour. It was also shown, that a thicker solder layer and expansion matched heat sink can lower packaging induced stress...|$|E
40|$|With the {{increasing}} market demands for minimally processed foods, processes that optimise bacterial reduction while minimising the thermal load are of continued interest. Fish, in particular, is {{very sensitive to}} thermal processing and often becomes tough and dry when exposed to excess heat. In several stages of food production, microbiological contamination {{is most likely to}} occur on the food surface. Hence, optimal heat processes, should target the surface contamination without causing unwanted thermal degradation. Short time, high temperature surface treatments using steam is potentially an efficient process that combines these factors. Listeria monocytogenes remains a challenging pathogenic organism for the seafood industry. It is omnipresent and it can grow at refrigerated temperatures. It is also the most heat resistant of the non-spore forming pathogens. Hence, the inactivation of L. monocytogenes during processing, as well as the growth conditions for potential survivors during storage, are important factors {{to be taken into account}} in order to ensure food safety. The objectives of this work were: (i) to identify an appropriate surrogate of Listeria monocytogenes, (ii) to develop a test system for artificial inoculation with realistic levels of the bacteria on fish products, (iii) to characterise a steam surface pasteurisation process and finally (iv) to quantify the microbial recovery post-treatment for assessing the efficacy of this decontamination process. The growth Listeria monocytogenes strains isolated from fish processing environment and two reference (non pathogenic) Listeria innocua strains, was investigated in liquid broth at refrigerated and close to optimal growth temperatures. Estimates for the growth rates and the lag phase duration of single strains and cocktails were obtained from optical density measurements by using different growth parameter estimation methods. The serial dilution method was preferred it as yielded growth rate (&# 956;max) estimates close to the biological value, and in addition, lag time (&# 955;) estimates. To discriminate between different strains, &# 955; appeared to be a more suitable parameter than &# 956;max. This effect was most prominent for L. innocua, which showed significantly longer lag times as well as lower growth rates than L. monocytogenes at 4 and 8 ºC. In order to accurately describe a thermal process such as steam pasteurisation thermal characterisation of the system is required. Heat transfer modelling can be used to estimate the surface temperature in a steam environment, or alternatively thermal load can be estimated from recorded surface changes. In this work, reflectance spectroscopy was investigated with respect to monitoring thermal load. A well-defined water bath treatment procedure was compared to a surface steam pasteurisation process, both for the heat transfer modelling and the spectroscopic analyses. The spectroscopic measurements showed that visible spectroscopy (400 - 550 nm) has potential for assessing the thermal load of a fish product (surimi) surface heated in water in the temperature range between 70 and 95 ºC. Heat transfer modelling confirmed the thermal load indicated by the measurements, and demonstrated the large temperature gradients that occur with short time, high temperature treatments. The accurate thermal characterisation of the system could then serve as an input for its antimicrobial assessment that follows in this Thesis. Antimicrobial efficacy assessments were performed by first investigating the effect of the inoculation technique and the initial inoculation level for Listeria innocua on cooked surimi. High and low inoculation levels were subjected to the steam surface pasteurisation process previously characterised. Inoculation with high levels confirmed findings in the literature, showing an initial 1 - 2 log reduction with no further reductions with increasing processing time (up to 20 s). Inoculation with more realistic, low levels, and analysing the treated samples using a novel <b>contact</b> <b>plating</b> approach could serve as a reliable method to assess the efficacy of the treatments. Using logistic regression, results from this method were used to model the binary responses of Listeria. The low level inoculation represents a more realistic scenario, and as such the binary responses derived from this method are more in line with industrial processing assessments. The results reported here have contributed to improving the understanding of the mechanisms involved in the steam surface pasteurisation of real foods and therefore, assisted in improving food safety assurance under specific operation conditions. nrpages: 149 status: publishe...|$|E

30|$|In {{creating}} the wiping device, {{there are several}} factors to consider.

This load varies depending on the attachment position of the sensor and the weight of the device. Also, the <b>contact</b> <b>plate</b> is better to have a smooth and hard surface. If the surface of <b>contact</b> <b>plate</b> is rough, the contact area between the target surface and the device will decrease. And, if the hardness of the <b>contact</b> <b>plate</b> cover is too soft, it will be assumed that wear is caused by the wiping motion, and repeat measurement becomes difficult. Besides wear, self-excited vibration tends to occur because the system becomes unstable if the plate cover is soft. If we want {{to pay attention to the}} resistance force, this vibration is undesirable as it can hinder stable contact with the ground. For these reasons, it is desired that the plate cover is hard and smooth.|$|R

The efficacy of each technique for the recovery of C. difficile from sites in the clinical environment that are touched at a high frequency was evaluated. <b>Contact</b> <b>plates</b> recovered 19 to 32 % of the total contam-ination on test surfaces, whereas sponge swabs recovered 76 to 94 % of the total contamination, and <b>contact</b> <b>plates</b> failed to detect C. difficile contamination below a detection limit of 10 CFU/ 25 cm 2 (0. 4 CFU/cm 2). In use, <b>contact</b> <b>plates</b> failed to detect C. diffi-cile contamination (0 / 96 contact plates; 4 case wards), while sponge swabs recovered C. difficile from 29 % (87 / 301) of the sur-faces tested in the clinical environment.
