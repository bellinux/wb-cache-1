40|$|The paper {{presents}} a general framework for handling <b>coupling</b> <b>modes</b> in active databases and discusses the inter-relationships between {{a set of}} <b>coupling</b> <b>modes</b> of an application and transaction efficiency. While the major role of <b>coupling</b> <b>modes</b> in active databases is to reduce ambiguous interpretation of transactions, <b>coupling</b> <b>modes</b> can affect the transaction's efficiency as well. Therefore, a default <b>coupling</b> <b>mode</b> is defined for each rule in a given application, based on efficiency considerations. This mechanism enables a designer of an application to consider efficiency while determining <b>coupling</b> <b>modes,</b> and base the <b>coupling</b> <b>modes</b> decision on theoretical grounds. This issue is particularly important in workflow management, where use of active databases in workflows on the one hand, {{and the failure of}} commercial products to support applications with high-throughput workflows on the other hand, requires an efficient execution process.

In this paper, the priority and deadline assignment to triggered transactions under two <b>coupling</b> <b>modes,</b> the deferred and immediate, in a DRTADBS is discussed. Two new approaches, the data state dependent (DSD) and the transaction-data deadline (TDD) are proposed to assign criticality and deadlines to the triggered transactions, respectively. In the DSD approach, the criticality of a triggered transaction is defined {{according to the state}} of the temporal data object which is responsible for its triggering. The objective of the DSD approach is {{to increase the number of}} commit achieved by the triggered transactions especially the more critical ones. The performance of these two approaches under the two <b>coupling</b> <b>modes</b> has been investigated. The results show that the DSD approach is more effective under the immediate <b>coupling</b> <b>mode</b> than under the deferred <b>coupling</b> <b>mode</b> due to the late creation of the triggered transactions under the deferred <b>coupling</b> <b>mode.</b> The TDD approach can improve the system performance under both deferred and immediate <b>coupling</b> <b>mode.</b> ...|$|R

Realization of such nano-optical devices requires optical couplings of various nanostructured elements and field confinement at the nanoscale. In particular, symmetric <b>coupling</b> <b>modes,</b> {{also referred to as}} dark modes, have recently received considerable attention because these modes can confine light energy to small spaces. Although the coupling behavior of plasmonic nanoparticles has been relatively well studied, couplings of inverse structures, that is, holes and pores, remain partially unexplored. Even for the most fundamental coupling system of two dipolar holes, comparison of the symmetric and anti-symmetric <b>coupling</b> <b>modes</b> has not been performed. Here we present, for the first time, a systematic study of the symmetric and anti-symmetric coupling of nanopore pairs using cathodoluminescence by scanning transmission electron microscopy and electromagnetic simulation. The symmetric <b>coupling</b> <b>mode,</b> approximated as a pair of facing dipoles, is observed at a lower energy than that of the anti-symmetric <b>coupling</b> <b>mode,</b> indicating that the facing dipoles attract each other. The anti-symmetric <b>coupling</b> <b>mode</b> splits into the inner-and outer-edge localized <b>modes</b> as the <b>coupling</b> distance decreases. These coupling behaviors cannot be fully explained as inverses of coupled disks. Symmetric and anti-symmetric <b>coupling</b> <b>modes</b> are also observed in a short-range ordered pore array, where one pore supports multiple local resonance modes, depending on the distance to the neighboring pore. Accessibility to the observed symmetric modes by far field is also discussed, which is important for nanophotonic device applications...|$|R

40|$|The {{effect of}} plasmon and LO-phonon damping on the optical {{measurements}} of InN films is discussed. Phonon and plasmon damping dramatically modifies the spectral {{features of the}} optical spectra and destabilizes the <b>coupled</b> <b>modes</b> of the system. Phonon damping affects the optical properties in a qualitatively different way from plasmon damping. Increased phonon damping leads to a merging of the <b>coupled</b> <b>modes</b> for a certain range of carrier density. Plasmon damping broadens the spectral linewidths of both of the <b>coupled</b> <b>modes</b> when plasmon energies are {{of the order of}} LO-phonon energies. However, when plasmon energies are larger than LO-phonon energies, increasing plasmon damping makes the higher-energy mode completely degenerate with plasmon, and may even have lower energies than plasmon. In weakly damped situations, we also discuss the low-energy optical transmission region that forms in between the <b>coupled</b> <b>modes.</b> Finally, the effect of plasmon and LO-phonon coupling on the analyses of the experimental infrared reflection data of InN films (for different electron densities) is discussed. © 2004 American Institute of Physics...|$|R
