500|$|The {{middle years}} of Edward's reign were {{a period of}} {{significant}} legislative activity. Perhaps the best-known piece of legislation was the Statute of Labourers of 1351, which addressed the labour shortage problem caused by the Black Death. The statute fixed wages at their pre-plague level and checked peasant mobility by asserting that lords had first claim on their men's services. In spite of concerted efforts to uphold the statute, it eventually failed due to competition among landowners for labour. The law {{has been described as}} an attempt [...] "to legislate against the law of supply and demand", which made it doomed to fail. Nevertheless, the labour shortage had created a <b>community</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> between the smaller landowners of the House of Commons and the greater landowners of the House of Lords. The resulting measures angered the peasants, leading to the Peasants' Revolt of 1381.|$|E

40|$|Local {{government}} reform {{has been an}} important governance issue across Australia for many years. In 2007, in Queensland, concerns surrounding the economic viability of many local governments triggered a shift {{in the direction of the}} Size, Shape and Sustainability (“SSS”) local government review. During the SSS process, the Institute for Sustainable Regional Development (ISRD) was commissioned to undertake a study on the implications of Council amalgamations for the Mt Morgan and Fitzroy local government areas in central Queensland: this paper describes this workand its relevance for regional governance. A key aspect of the project was an examination of the ’communities of interest’ within the study area. <b>Communities</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> are an important consideration for local governments, particularly where boundary changes involve the amalgamation of previously separate shire areas and their respective <b>communities.</b> The purpose <b>of</b> this research was to ascertain (a) what, and where, <b>communities</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> existed within the Fitzroy-Mount Morgan study region and (b) the implications of these for the <b>communities</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> post-amalgamation. The research involved a literature review combined with an extensive community consultation phase, including face to face interviewing and a community survey. A number <b>of</b> <b>communities</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> were identified, particularly with respect to areas of local {{government reform}} preferences, satisfaction with services, equity of services, financial connections, community wellbeing, and community characters. The research was conducted prior to the decision to amalgamate the Fitzroy, Mount Morgan, Livingstone and Rockhampton local governments into the Rockhampton Regional Council (subsequently ratified by the Queensland State Government and operationalised in March 2008). The lessons learned from this work can be applied to local governments elsewhere in Australia, since the work serves to highlight the importance of identifying and considering <b>communities</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> when considering municipal boundary changes. In fact, this work demonstrates that <b>communities</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> are equally as important as issues regarding (for example) economies of scale. The paper concludes by providing suggestions on actions that could be undertaken at both the regional and local level in order to encourage and strengthen existing <b>communities</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> to the benefit <b>of</b> <b>community</b> wellbeing...|$|R
