40|$|Somatic cell hybrid (SCH) {{panels and}} {{radiation}} hybrid (RH) panels are powerful resources for <b>comparative</b> <b>gene</b> <b>mapping</b> because gene assignments are made without {{the detection of}} genetic polymorphism as needed for linkage mapping. A frequently encountered problem, however, is that the gene specific primers may amplify homologous PCR products of equal length from the donor and recipient species of the panel. Here, we describe a simple {{solution to this problem}} in which we utilize the formation of interspecies heteroduplexes that can be easily distinguished from the corresponding homoduplexes by native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. We denote these DNA–DNA interspecies hybrids, xenoduplexes (xeno[*]=[*]Gr. Xenos, foreigner). A merit of the method is that the formation of xenoduplexes strongly suggests that the PCR products from the two species represent homologous sequences. The method is thus particularly useful for <b>comparative</b> <b>gene</b> <b>mapping</b> when the PCR primers have been designed by use of sequence information from other species. In this study we have successfully used xenoduplex analysis and a pig-rodent SCH panel to map seven porcine genes (ACADM, AT 3, HOXD, IL 8 RB, LEPR, PAX 8, PKLR) for which no previous sequence information was available.

To extend this model, a genetic linkage map of microsatellite loci in the feline genome has been constructed including 246 autosomal and 7 X-linked loci. Two hundred thirty-five dinucleotide (dC · dA) n· (dG · dT) n and 18 tetranucleotide repeat loci were identified and genotyped in a two-family, 108 -member multigeneration interspecies backcross pedigree between the domestic cat (F. catus) and the Asian leopard cat (Prionailurus bengalensis). Two hundred twenty-nine loci were linked to at least one other marker with a lod score ≥ 3. 0, identifying 34 linkage groups. Representative markers from each linkage group were assigned to specific cat chromosomes by somatic cell hybrid analysis, resulting in chromosomal assignments to 16 of the 19 feline chromosomes.

40|$|Background: Sex-determining {{systems have}} evolved {{independently}} in vertebrates. Placental mammals and marsupials have an XY system, birds have a ZW system. Reptiles and amphibians have different systems, including temperature-dependent sex determination, and XY and ZW systems that differ in origin from birds and placental mammals. Monotremes diverged early in mammalian evolution, {{just after the}} mammalian clade diverged from the sauropsid clade. Our previous studies showed that male platypus has five X and five Y chromosomes, no SRY, and DMRT 1 on an X chromosome. In order to investigate monotreme sex chromosome evolution, we performed a comparative study of platypus and echidna by chromosome painting and <b>comparative</b> <b>gene</b> <b>mapping.</b> Results: Chromosome painting reveals a meiotic chain of nine sex chromosomes in the male echidna and establishes their order in the chain. Two of those differ {{from those in the}} platypus, three of the platypus sex chromosomes differ from those of the echidna and the order of several chromosomes is rearranged. <b>Comparative</b> <b>gene</b> <b>mapping</b> shows that, in addition to bird autosome regions, regions of bird Z chromosomes are homologous to regions in four platypus X chromosomes, that is, X 1, X 2, X 3, X 5, and in chromosome Y 1. Conclusion: Monotreme sex chromosomes are easiest to explain on the hypothesis that autosomes were added sequentially to the translocation chain, with the final additions after platypus and echidna divergence. Genome sequencing and contig anchoring show no homology yet between platypus and therian Xs; thus, monotremes have a unique XY sex chromosome system that shares some homology with the avian Z.

40|$|Abstract Background Identification {{of genes}} {{involved}} in adaptation and speciation by targeting specific genes of interest {{has become a}} plausible strategy also for non-model organisms. We investigated the potential utility of available sequenced fish genomes to develop microsatellite (cf. simple sequence repeat, SSR) markers for functionally important genes in nine-spined sticklebacks (Pungitius pungitius), as well as cross-species transferability of SSR primers from three-spined (Gasterosteus aculeatus) to nine-spined sticklebacks. In addition, we examined the patterns and degree of SSR conservation between these species using their aligned sequences. Results Cross-species amplification success was lower for SSR markers located in or around functionally important genes (27 out of 158) than for those randomly derived from genomic (35 out of 101) and cDNA (35 out of 87) libraries. Polymorphism was observed at a large proportion (65 %) of the cross-amplified loci independently of SSR type. To develop SSR markers for functionally important genes in nine-spined sticklebacks, SSR locations were surveyed in or around 67 target genes based on the three-spined stickleback genome and these regions were sequenced with primers designed from conserved sequences in sequenced fish genomes. Out of the 81 SSRs identified in the sequenced regions (44, 084 bp), 57 exhibited the same motifs at the same locations as in the three-spined stickleback. Di- and trinucleotide SSRs appeared to be highly conserved whereas mononucleotide SSRs were less so. Species-specific primers were designed to amplify 58 SSRs using the sequences of nine-spined sticklebacks. Conclusions Our results demonstrated that {{a large proportion of}} SSRs are conserved in the species that have diverged more than 10 million years ago. Therefore, the three-spined stickleback genome can be used to predict SSR locations in the nine-spined stickleback genome. While cross-species utility of SSR primers is limited due to low amplification success, SSR markers can be developed for target genes and genomic regions using our approach, which should be also applicable to other non-model organisms. The SSR markers developed in this study should be useful for identification of genes responsible for phenotypic variation and adaptive divergence of nine-spined stickleback populations, as well as for constructing <b>comparative</b> <b>gene</b> <b>maps</b> of nine-spined and three-spined sticklebacks. </p...|$|R

Only three macaque chromosomes (2, 7, 13) were each hybridized by two separate human libraries (7 and 21, 14 and 15, 20 and 22 respectively).

40|$|The work {{presented}} in this thesis was undertaken to identify regions of the mouse and cattle genomes' containing quantitative trait loci (QTL) and candidate genes for net feed intake (NFl). Prior to mapping QTL in mice, a number of experiments were performed on mice from the eleventh generation of selection for divergent NFl to quantify the effects of selection for NFl on growth, body composition, protein turnover, metabolic rate, activity, and gastric emptying. Eleven generations of selection for and against NFl did not significantly alter body weight or growth rate. Mice from the high NFl selection line contained 32 % less body fat, were 85 % more active with {{no significant difference in}} body weight, growth rate or protein synthesis. There was a significant diflerence in gastric emptying of solid food between the mice lines with the high NFI mice grinding (25 %) and emptying (21 %) their gastric contents faster than the low NFl mice. This difference indicates the potential for gut hormones that regulate gastric emptying such as cholecystokinin, gastrin, motilin, secretin, and peptide YY as candidate genes for NFL. Cattle that were more efficient (lower NFl) had lower maintenance requirements, and consumed less feed per day. The eye muscle area, peak force of the LD muscle and meat, fat and bone weight significantly influenced NFI. However, only 17 % of the variation in NFl was accounted for by these traits. Also, eating rate, number of feeding sessions per day and time spent feeding influenced NFl, accounting for 15 % of the variation in NFI. Low NFI cattle ate slower, spent less time feeding and had fewer trips to the feeder than those animals with higher NFl suggesting a possible action of the serotonin and/or dopamine systems as candidate genes for NFI. Multiple interval mapping revealed nine NFl QTL in F₂mice from the eighth generation of selection for divergent NFI. Interval mapping, a simpler method for QTL mapping was used in Limousin-jersey backcross cattle and detected four QTL for NFl on BTA 1, 8, 9, and 20. The <b>comparative</b> <b>gene</b> <b>maps</b> between cattle and mice revealed that NFl QTL located on BTA 1 and 20 were comparative with the NFl QTL detected on MMU 16 and 13 respectively. A further two QTL that were almost significant in cattle on BTA 6 and 16 were also comparative with two of the mouse NFl QTL (MMU 1 and MMU 5 respectively). Based on these cattle QTL results and certain assumptions regarding NFl, selection for NFl in stud bulls would appear to be profitable for a producer. Validation of these QTL in other beef cattle breeds is required before commercialisation of any DNA based test. There were 19 genes in these four regions that could act as candidates for NFl located in these regions. Overall, the neurotransmitters appear to be the most promising candidate genes making up 11 of the potential 19 candidate genes identified. However, further biochemical and gene expression studies are required in cattle to confirm or contradict this. Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Adelaide, School of Agriculture and Wine, 200...|$|R
40|$|Comparing {{chromosomal}} gene {{order in}} two or more related species is an important approach to studying the forces that guide genome organization and evolution. Linked clusters of similar genes found in related genomes are often used to support arguments of evolutionary relatedness or functional selection. However, as the gene order and the gene complement of sister genomes diverge progressively due to large scale rearrangements, horizontal gene transfer, gene duplication and gene loss, it becomes increasingly dif � cult to determine whether observed similarities in local genomic structure are indeed remnants of common ancestral gene order, or are merely coincidences. A rigorous comparative genomics requires principled methods for distinguishing chance commonalities, within or between genomes, from genuine historical or functional relationships.

However, the relatively large size of the salamander genome did not hinder efforts to map and identify conserved syntenies from a small sample of 24 protein-coding loci. Chromosomal segments that are conserved between fishes and mammals are also conserved in these salamanders. Thus, <b>comparative</b> <b>gene</b> <b>mapping</b> appears to be an efficient strategy for identifying orthologous loci between ambystomatid salamanders and genomically well-characterized vertebrate model organisms...|$|E
40|$|The {{peculiar}} cytology {{and unique}} evolution of sex chromosomes raise many fundamental questions. Why and how sex chromosomes evolved has been debated {{over a century}} since H. J. Muller suggested that sex chromosome pairs evolved ultimately {{from a pair of}} autosomes. This theory was adapted to explain variations in the snake ZW chromosome pair and later the mammal XY. S. Ohno pointed out similarities between the mammal X and the bird/reptile Z chromosomes forty years ago, but his speculation that they had a common evolutionary origin, or at least evolved from similar regions of the genome, has been undermined by <b>comparative</b> <b>gene</b> <b>mapping,</b> and it is accepted that mammal XY and reptile ZW systems evolved independently from a common ancestor. Here we review evidence for the alternative theory, that ZW⇔XY transitions occurred during evolution, citing examples from fish and amphibians, and probably reptiles. We discuss new work from comparative genomics and cytogenetics that leads to a reconsideration of Ohno's idea and advance a new hypothesis that the mammal XY system may have arisen directly from an ancient reptile ZW system...|$|E
40|$|Localization {{of disease}} {{susceptibility}} genes to certain {{areas in the}} human genome, or <b>gene</b> <b>mapping,</b> requires careful analysis of genetic marker data. <b>Gene</b> <b>mapping</b> is often carried out using a sample of individuals affected by the disease of interest and a sample of healthy controls. From a data mining perspective, <b>gene</b> <b>mapping</b> can then be cast as a pattern discov-ery and analysis task: which genetically motivated marker patterns help to separate affected individuals from healthy ones? The marker data constitutes haplotypes: a haplotype is a string of genetic markers from one chromosome. Individuals who share a common ancestor, {{such as those that}} have inherited the disease gene from this individual, potentially share a substring in their haplotypes. Classi-fication or association analysis of haplotypes is thus one approach to <b>gene</b> <b>mapping.</b> Further, analyzing the similarities of haplotypes and clustering them can provide insight to genetic rela-tionships of individuals, to different mutations, and thus to the genetic etiology of the disease. We describe and illustrate data mining approaches to <b>gene</b> <b>mapping</b> using haplotypes: as-sociation analysis, similarity analysis, and clustering. The association-based <b>gene</b> <b>mapping</b> methods have been found to perform well and are being routinely applied in <b>gene</b> <b>mapping</b> projects...|$|R
40|$|Several {{angiosperm}} plant genomes, including Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), rice (Oryza sativa), poplar (Populus trichocarpa), and grapevine (Vitis vinifera), {{have been}} sequenced, {{but the lack}} of reference genomes in gymnosperm phyla reduces our understanding of plant evolution and restricts the potential impacts of genomics research. A gene catalog was developed for the conifer tree Picea glauca (white spruce) through large-scale expressed sequence tag sequencing and full-length cDNA sequencing to facilitate genome characterizations, <b>comparative</b> genomics, and <b>gene</b> <b>mapping.</b> The resource incorporates new and publicly available sequences into 27, 720 cDNA clusters, 23, 589 of which are represented by full-length insert cDNAs. Expressed sequence tags, mate-pair cDNA clone analysis, and custom sequencing were integrated through an iterative process to improve the accuracy of clustering outcomes. The entire catalog spans 30 Mb of unique transcribed sequence. We estimated that the P. glauca nuclear genome contains up to 32, 520 transcribed genes owing to incomplete, partially sequenced, and unsampled transcripts and that its transcriptome could span up to 47 Mb. These estimates are in the same range as the Arabidopsis and rice transcriptomes. Next-generation methods confirmed and enhanced the catalog by providing deeper coverage for rare transcripts, by extending many incomplete clusters, and by augmenting the overall transcriptome coverage to 38 Mb of unique sequence. Genomic sample sequencing at 8. 5 % of the 19. 8 -Gb P. glauca genome identified 1, 495 clusters representing highly repeated sequences among the cDNA clusters. With a conifer transcriptome in full view, functional and protein domain annotations clearly highlighted the divergences between conifers and angiosperms, likely reflecting their respective evolutionary paths...|$|R
40|$|Recently, the Mouse ENCODE Consortium {{reported}} that <b>comparative</b> <b>gene</b> expression data from human and mouse tend to cluster more by species {{rather than by}} tissue. This observation was surprising, as it contradicted much of the <b>comparative</b> <b>gene</b> regulatory data collected previously, {{as well as the}} common notion that major developmental pathways are highly conserved across a wide range of species, in particular across mammals. Here we show that the Mouse ENCODE gene expression data were collected using a flawed study design, which confounded sequencing batch (namely, the assignment of samples to sequencing flowcells and lanes) with species. When we account for the batch effect, the corrected <b>comparative</b> <b>gene</b> expression data from human and mouse tend to cluster by tissue, not by species...|$|R
