5|$|In 1901, Beebe {{returned}} to Nova Scotia {{on his first}} expedition for the zoo, {{with the goal of}} collecting marine animals by searching tide pools and with additional dredging. The following year he was promoted from assistant <b>curator</b> to the rank of full <b>curator,</b> a post he held until 1918. He then went on to serve as an honorary <b>curator</b> from 1919 to 1962.|$|E
5|$|Beebe's {{position}} in the Zoological Society underwent a change in 1918: He was given the title of Honorary <b>Curator</b> of Birds, and was made {{the director of the}} newly created Department of Tropical Research. With his new position, Beebe no longer had the duty of caring for the zoo's animals, freeing him to devote himself fully to his writing and research. Beebe's duties as <b>curator</b> were passed to Lee Crandall, the former Assistant <b>Curator</b> who had worked under Beebe, although Crandall continued to rely on Beebe for help treating illness in birds, and caring for the exotic birds brought back from Beebe's expeditions.|$|E
