40|$|The {{combination}} of human {{population growth and}} resource depletion makes <b>catastrophes</b> highly probable. No long-term {{solutions to the problems}} of humankind will be discovered unless sustainable use of the planet is achieved. The essential first step toward this goal is avoiding or coping with global <b>catastrophes</b> that result from crossing major ecological thresholds. Decreasing the number of global <b>catastrophes</b> will reduce the risks associated with destabilizing ecological systems, which could, in turn, destabilize societal systems. Many <b>catastrophes</b> will be local, regional, or national, but even these upheavals will have global consequences. <b>Catastrophes</b> will be the result of unsustainable practices and the misuse of technology. However, avoiding ecological <b>catastrophes</b> will depend on the development of eco-ethics, which is subject to progressive maturation, comments, and criticism.

40|$|Article {{published}} in a journal of theoretical and empirical papers that analyze risk-bearing behavior and decision-making under uncertainty. Natural <b>catastrophes</b> often have catastrophic risks on insurance companies {{as well as on}} the insured. Using a very large dataset on homeowners' insurance coverage by state, by firm, and by year for the 1984 to 2004 period, this paper documents the positive effect on losses and loss ratios of both unexpected <b>catastrophes</b> as well as large events that the authors term "blockbuster <b>catastrophes.</b> " Insurers adapt to these catastrophic risks by raising insurance rates, leading to lower loss ratios after the catastrophic event. There is a widespread event of unexpected <b>catastrophes</b> and blockbuster <b>catastrophes</b> that reduces total premiums earned in the state, reduces the total number writing insurance coverage in the state, and leads to the exit of firms from the state.

Our contemporary world hasbeen swamped with fictional treatments of <b>catastrophes</b> – treatments that might seem to have the power of heralding thesecatastrophes and certainly of nurturing an obsessive fear of them.

5|$|Unlike Planck, Einstein {{entertained the}} {{possibility}} that there might be actual physical quanta of light—what we now call photons. He noticed that a light quantum with energy proportional to its frequency would explain a number of troubling puzzles and paradoxes, including an unpublished law by Stokes, the ultraviolet <b>catastrophe,</b> and the photoelectric effect. Stokes's law said simply that the frequency of fluorescent light cannot be greater than the frequency of the light (usually ultraviolet) inducing it. Einstein eliminated the ultraviolet <b>catastrophe</b> by imagining a gas of photons behaving like a gas of electrons that he had previously considered. He was advised by a colleague to be careful how he wrote up this paper, in order to not challenge Planck, a powerful figure in physics, too directly, and indeed the warning was justified, as Planck never forgave him for writing it.|$|E
