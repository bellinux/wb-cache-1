5|$|NY414 {{begins at}} an {{intersection}} with NY352 (Denison Parkway) in the Steuben County city of <b>Corning.</b> It initially heads north on Cedar Street, following it past two largely commercial blocks {{that make up}} part of the Market Street Historic District. Past the district, the route changes names to Centerway and crosses over the Chemung River, which flows east–west {{through the center of}} <b>Corning.</b> Across the river, the route traverses more commercial neighborhoods to reach Pulteney Street, designated as NY415 west of this point. Along this stretch, NY414 passes the former <b>Corning</b> Armory and the <b>Corning</b> Museum of Glass, the latter located on the southwest corner of the junction with NY415.|$|E

5|$|In Dix, NY414 makes a large reverse S-curve, {{turning to}} the east and {{northeast}} as it follows the <b>Corning</b> Secondary through another creek valley, this one surrounding Shequaga Creek. The creek eventually heads east toward Montour Falls; however, NY414 and the rail line continue northeast to the outskirts of Watkins Glen, a village located inside of a wide valley holding Seneca Lake. At {{the western edge of the}} gully, the <b>Corning</b> Secondary breaks from NY414 to follow the ridge north through Watkins Glen State Park. The route, meanwhile, descends the side of the valley to enter Watkins Glen, where it merges with NY14 at the foot of the hill.|$|E

5|$|In {{the city}} of <b>Corning,</b> NY44, and later NY414, {{originally}} entered from the north on Baker Street and met NY17 at Pulteney Street. The two routes then overlapped along Pulteney Street to Centerway, where they crossed the Chemung River via Centerway and Pine Street. At Market Street, NY17 and NY44 turned east and remained concurrent to Conhocton Street, where NY44 headed south to Caton while NY17 continued east on Market to the hamlet of Gibson. When the overlap through <b>Corning</b> was eliminated in 1949, NY414 was truncated to {{the western end of}} the overlap at the intersection of Baker and Pulteney Streets.|$|E

5|$|NY414 was {{truncated}} on January1, 1949, {{to begin}} in downtown <b>Corning.</b> Its former routing from Caton to <b>Corning</b> was redesignated as NY225 {{as part of the}} change. On April1, 1980, ownership and maintenance of CR120 east of NY225 in Caton was transferred from Steuben County to the state of New York as part of a highway maintenance swap between the two levels of government. All of CR7 in Chemung County was also transferred to the state sometime after 1978. The Caton–Big Flats roadway, now state-maintained along its entire length, became an eastward extension of NY225 by 1986.|$|E

5|$|Prior to the {{recession}} of the 1990s, downtown Albany was home to four Fortune 500 companies. After the death of <b>Corning</b> and the retirement of Congressman Sam Stratton, the political environment changes. Long-term office holders became rare in the 1980s. Local media began following the drama surrounding county politics (specifically that of the newly created county executive position); the loss of <b>Corning</b> (and eventually the machine) led {{to a lack of}} interest in city politics. The election of Gerald Jennings was a surprise, and he served as Mayor from 1994 until his retirement at the end of 2013. His tenure essentially ended the political machine that had been in place since the 1920s.|$|E

5|$|Harvey Littleton (June 14, 1922 – December 13, 2013) was an American {{glass artist}} and educator. Born in <b>Corning,</b> New York, {{he grew up}} in the shadow of <b>Corning</b> Glass Works, where his father headed Research and Development during the 1930s. Expected by his father to enter the field of physics, Littleton instead chose a career in art, gaining {{recognition}} first as a ceramist and later as a glassblower and sculptor in glass. In the latter capacity he was very influential, organizing the first glassblowing seminar aimed at the studio artist in 1962, {{on the grounds of the}} Toledo Museum of Art. Imbued with the prevailing view at the time that glassblowing could only be done on the factory floor, separated from the designer at his desk, Littleton aimed to put it within the reach of the individual studio artist.|$|E

40|$|Different <b>corn</b> hybrids and soybean cultivars {{were tested}} for their {{allelopathic}} {{effects on the}} subsequent <b>corn</b> yield. Three planting dates were imposed on a mid-season hybrid or cultivar so that the developmental stage effect of <b>corn</b> or soybean could be evaluated. The residues of <b>corn</b> and soybean were either removed or incorporated into the soil. On the average, <b>corn</b> and soybean did not significantly affect the subsequent <b>corn</b> yield. The difference between yields of <b>corn</b> in a continuous <b>corn</b> and <b>corn</b> following soybean was mainly due to the inhibitory allelopathic effect of the previous <b>corn.</b> Maturity type and hybrid of <b>corn,</b> associated with plant size, were the prime factors affecting the subsequent <b>corn</b> yield. Late <b>corn</b> hybrid and mid-season <b>corn</b> hybrid planted on May 15 strongly depressed grain yield of the subsequent <b>corn.</b> For the mid-season <b>corn</b> hybrid, the more progress the developmental stage of <b>corn</b> toward maturity, the stronger the inhibitory effect. Soybean cultivars {{did not affect the}} subsequent <b>corn</b> yield. Nevertheless, there was a slight increase in grain yield of the subsequent <b>corn</b> caused by soybean;When the data were compared to 100 % for oat control plots, the results indicate that the late <b>corn</b> hybrid obviously reduced the subsequent <b>corn</b> yield and all soybean cultivars increased grain yield of the subsequent <b>corn.</b> Either the <b>corn</b> residue removed or incorporated affected the subsequent <b>corn</b> yield similar to oat. For soybean, either the residue was removed or incorporated, grain yield of the subsequent <b>corn</b> was increased, as compared to oat control plots;Using the Lemna bioassay to detect the allelochemicals in the extracts of soil from the previous <b>corn</b> and soybean plots was unsuccessful. The results from the two years studied were sometimes contradictory. In general the highest extract concentration from both <b>corn</b> and soybean was inhibitory to Lemna growth;A study was conducted to determine if intercropping soybean into <b>corn</b> increased the grain yield of the subsequent <b>corn</b> by means of stimulatory allelochemicals.

5|$|NY63 was rerouted {{south of}} Mount Morris {{in the early}} 1940s to follow its current {{alignment}} to Wayland. The former alignment of NY63 from Hinsdale to Mount Morris was redesignated as NY408. In the early 1970s, construction began on {{the portion of the}} Southern Tier Expressway between Olean and <b>Corning.</b> From Hinsdale to Belvidere, the new highway closely followed NY408. By 1974, the highway was open from Olean to Hinsdale and from Almond to <b>Corning.</b> The segment between Hinsdale and NY19 in Belvidere was completed by January 1975, and the leg between Belvidere and Almond opened to traffic on January30, 1975, completing the Olean–Corning portion of the expressway. The bypassed section of NY408 between Cuba and Belvidere was subsequently transferred to Allegany County, and NY408 was truncated to its current southern terminus in Nunda as a result. The portion of NY408's former routing between Hinsdale and Cuba was retained as a state highway and renumbered to NY446 on July 1, 1974.|$|E
5|$|During the 1950s and 1960s, a {{time when}} federal aid for urban renewal was plentiful, Albany did not have growth in its economy or infrastructure.

40|$|Western <b>corn</b> rootworm, Diabrotica virgifera virgifera LeConte (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae), is {{a serious}} pest of <b>corn</b> in the United States, and recent {{management}} of western <b>corn</b> rootworm has included planting of Bt <b>corn.</b> Beginning in 2009, western <b>corn</b> rootworm populations with resistance to Cry 3 Bb 1 <b>corn</b> and mCry 3 A <b>corn</b> were found in Iowa and elsewhere. To date, western <b>corn</b> rootworm populations have remained susceptible to <b>corn</b> producing Bt toxin Cry 34 / 35 Ab 1. In this study, we used single-plant bioassays to test field populations of western <b>corn</b> rootworm for resistance to Cry 34 / 35 Ab 1 <b>corn,</b> Cry 3 Bb 1 <b>corn,</b> and mCry 3 A <b>corn.</b> Bioassays included nine rootworm populations collected from fields where severe injury to Bt <b>corn</b> had been observed and six control populations {{that had never been}} exposed to Bt <b>corn.</b> We found incomplete resistance to Cry 34 / 35 Ab 1 <b>corn</b> among field populations collected from fields where severe injury to <b>corn</b> producing Cry 34 / 35 Ab 1, either singly or as a pyramid, had been observed.
