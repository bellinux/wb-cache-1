25|$|Since {{officers}} {{have to be}} on <b>call-out</b> most of the day, they may be assigned to regular patrol duties. To decrease response times to situations that require a SWAT team, it is now a common practice to place SWAT equipment and weaponry in secured lockers in the trunks of specialized police cruisers. Departments that often use this style of organization are county sheriffs, due to the different sizes of counties, and the predominance of back-roads. In places like Los Angeles, where traffic may be heavy, the LAPD use cruisers such as this to respond with their officers so {{they do not have to}} return to a police station to armor up. However, heavier duty equipment may be needed depending on the situation that arises.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To examine {{patient and}} care {{characteristics}} of emergency ambulance <b>call-outs</b> {{and to determine}} how many of them were, in retrospect, effectively providing primary care. DESIGN: Retrospective cross-sectional study. METHOD: We charted patient and care characteristics of 598 emergency ambulance <b>call-outs</b> in the Zuid-Gelderland region in the east of the Netherlands by applying a retrospective dossier analysis method. Three reviewers independently retrospectively determined what the required care was: primary or secondary care. This judgment was compared with the actual care given to the patient: treatment-on-the-spot or transfer to hospital. RESULTS: A 1 care was provided in 74. 1 % and A 2 care in 25. 9 % of the ambulance <b>call-outs.</b> Mean patient age was 49. 2 years and 53. 3 % of the patients were male. The probability diagnoses 'becoming unwell' (11. 5 %) and 'trauma to extremity' (11. 2 %) were the most common. In retrospect, the patient could have been treated in primary care, or self-treated, in 42. 3 % of the ambulance <b>call-outs.</b> The percentage of primary care was higher during office hours than out of hours (49 vs 39). In 91. 7 % of cases the required care as determined by the reviewers was the same as the actual follow-up care given to the patient by paramedics. CONCLUSION: Almost half of emergency ambulance <b>call-outs</b> effectively provide primary care. This finding reinforces the need for research into cooperation between ambulance services, primary care practices and out-of-hours primary care cooperatives...|$|R

500|$|At the {{conclusion}} of the first season, one of the show's animators confirmed that [...] "Derpy" [...] would be a scripted background character in the second season, and was a part of several sight gags. In the original broadcast of the mid-season episode [...] "The Last Roundup" [...] {{as well as on the}} home media The Friendship Express release, [...] "Derpy" [...] was called out by name by Rainbow Dash, and given lines (as voiced by St. Germain) and klutzy mannerisms as a direct <b>call-out</b> to the brony fandom. Though most of the fans appreciated the inclusion, some viewers had a negative response to the character, believing her portrayal insulted the mentally handicapped. Hasbro subsequently modified these scenes, and while [...] "Derpy" [...] is still present in subsequent broadcast and digital versions of the episode, she is not named, and a different voice is used. According to Hasbro's Nicole Agnello, [...] "Some viewers felt that aspects of the episode 'The Last Roundup' did not stay true to the core message of friendship which is the heart and soul of the series. Hasbro Studios decided to make slight audio alterations to this single episode." [...] Despite Hasbro's intentions, some members of the brony community were disappointed, and some made efforts to restore the original voice. [...] "Derpy" [...] remained in background cameos throughout other episodes in season 2 and 3. Within season 4, Derpy was re-introduced, remaining silent and unnamed but with her original wall-eyed look, as a side character in the main story of [...] "Rainbow Falls". The appearance was planned as a big reveal for the brony fans, according to co-director Jim Miller, and that [...] "she is here to stay" [...] according to Hasbro's vice president for entertainment Mike Vogel.

40|$|Background and Aims: It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that distributing naloxone to people who inject drugs (PWID) will lead to fewer attendances by emergency medical services at opioid-related overdose incidents if peer administration of naloxone was perceived to have resuscitated the overdose victim successfully. This study evaluated the impact of a national naloxone programme (NNP) on ambulance attendance at opioid-related overdose incidents throughout Scotland. Specifically, we aimed to answer the following research questions: is there evidence of an association between ambulance <b>call-outs</b> to opioid-related overdose incidents and the cumulative number of ‘take-home naloxone’ (THN) kits in issue; and is there evidence of an association between ambulance <b>call-outs</b> to opioid-related overdose incidents in early adopter (pilot) or later adopting (non-pilot) regions and the cumulative number of THN kits issued in those areas? Design: Controlled time–series analysis. Setting: Scotland, UK, 2008 – 15. Participants: Pre-NNP implementation period for the evaluation was defined as 1 April 2008 to 31 March 2011 and the post-implementation period as 1 April 2011 to 31 March 2015. In total, 3721 ambulance attendances at opioid-related overdose were recorded for the pre-NNP implementation period across 158 weeks (mean 23. 6 attendances per week) and 5258 attendances across 212 weeks in the post-implementation period (mean 24. 8 attendances per week). Intervention: Scotland's NNP; formally implemented on 1 April 2011. Measurements: Primary outcome measure was weekly incidence (counts) of <b>call-outs</b> to opioid-related overdoses at national and regional Health Board level. Data were acquired from the Scottish Ambulance Service (SAS). Models were adjusted for opioid replacement therapy using data acquired from the Information Services Division on monthly sums of all dispensed methadone and buprenorphine in the study period.
