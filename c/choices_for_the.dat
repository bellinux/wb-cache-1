5|$|Bradley Cooper, Ryan Reynolds, Justin Timberlake, and Jared Leto {{were the}} producers' top <b>choices</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> {{starring}} role in July 2009. On July 10, Warner announced that Reynolds had been cast as Hal Jordan/Green Lantern. A website reported on January 7, 2010, that a crew-member had written on her blog that the film was greenlit {{the day before and}} that filming would begin in 10 weeks. Also in January, Blake Lively was cast as Carol Ferris, Peter Sarsgaard was in negotiations to portray Hector Hammond, and Mark Strong was in negotiations to play Sinestro. In February, Tim Robbins joined the cast as Senator Hammond. The following month, New Zealanders Temuera Morrison and Taika Waititi had joined the cast as Abin Sur and Tom Kalmaku, respectively.|$|E
5|$|Chopra {{said in an}} {{interview}} that Saif Ali Khan and Vidya Balan were not the first <b>choices</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> lead roles in Parineeta. In fact Abhishek Bachchan was being cast as Shekhar and Saif Ali Khan as Girish. However Abhishek walked out of the project and Saif readily was accepted as a replacement. This fact was corroborated by Saif in {{an interview}} when he said that even though Sarkar had faith in his abilities, Chopra was not too keen on having him.|$|E

5|$|In {{computer}} science, 2-satisfiability, 2-SAT or just 2SAT is a computational {{problem of}} assigning values to variables, {{each of which}} has two possible values, in order to satisfy a system of constraints on pairs of variables. It is a special case of the general Boolean satisfiability problem, which can involve constraints on more than two variables, and of constraint satisfaction problems, which can allow more than two <b>choices</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> value of each variable. But in contrast to those more general problems, which are NP-complete, 2-satisfiability can be solved in polynomial time.|$|E
5|$|Peckinpah's {{first two}} <b>choices</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> role of Deke Thornton were Richard Harris (who had co-starred in Major Dundee) and Brian Keith (who {{had worked with}} Peckinpah on The Westerner (1960) and The Deadly Companions (1961)). Harris was never {{formally}} approached, but Keith was, and turned the part down. Robert Ryan was ultimately cast in the part after Peckinpah {{saw him in the}} World War II action movie The Dirty Dozen (1967). Other actors considered for the role were Henry Fonda, Glenn Ford, Van Heflin, Ben Johnson (later cast as Tector Gorch), and Arthur Kennedy.|$|E
5|$|When {{casting the}} many {{characters}} of Pride and Prejudice, the producer Sue Birtwistle and director Simon Langton {{were looking for}} actors with wit, charm and charisma, who could also play the Regency period. Their <b>choices</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> story's protagonists, 20-year-old Elizabeth Bennet and 28-year-old Mr Darcy, determined the other actors cast. Hundreds of actresses between 15 and 28 auditioned, and those with the right presence were screen-tested, performing several prepared scenes in period costumes and makeup in a television studio. Straight offers were made to several established actors.|$|E

5|$|Armand Assante and Antonio Banderas were Glimcher's ideal <b>choices</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> {{roles of}} Cesar and Nestor Castillo. Prior to The Mambo Kings, Assante had {{appeared}} {{in a number of}} films but had not yet broken out as a major star. Banderas, a Spanish actor, had moved to Los Angeles, California, hoping to make an international debut with his first English speaking role. Warner Bros., however, wanted to cast Jeremy Irons as Cesar and Ray Liotta as Nestor. Both actors had received critical acclaim for their performances in Reversal of Fortune and Goodfellas respectively, and the studio felt that they would appeal to a wider audience. Through a translator, Glimcher told Banderas to work on improving his English for one month before performing a screen test opposite Irons. The Spanish actor, lacking the ability to speak English, learned his lines phonetically. Despite Irons's excellent screen test, Glimcher thought he was wrong for the part and insisted on Assante; he thought the charm and seductiveness of Assante made him perfect for the role, and the studio eventually gave in.|$|E
5|$|Morris {{started the}} 1947–48 Australian season strongly, scoring 162 {{in his second}} match as New South Wales crushed the touring Indians by an innings ahead of the Tests. He played {{in the first four}} Tests, scoring 45 and an unbeaten 100 in the Third Test victory in Melbourne. In that match, he dropped down the order as Bradman used the tail-enders to protect the batsmen from a sticky wicket. Morris then came in and {{combined}} with Bradman in a double century stand. The selectors wished to trial other possible <b>choices</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> 1948 tour of England, including Brown in the opening position, so wither Barnes or Morris had to sit out. This was decided by a coin toss. Morris lost and did not play; he was given 10 pounds as compensation. Morris thus ended the series with 209 runs at an average of 52.25. Australia won the final Test to seal the series 4–0, and Morris ended the season with 772 runs at 55.14. He scored four consecutive half-centuries for his state as they reclaimed the Sheffield Shield from Victoria. For the first two Tests, Morris was paired with the recovered Brown, before the latter was replaced by Barnes.|$|E
5|$|Some of his {{selections}} as captain {{were widely}} debated. Following {{incidents in the}} Caribbean, Trueman did not play for England again under Hutton's captaincy, although he was still regarded as an England prospect. Jim Laker was also omitted from the team, possibly because Hutton doubted Laker's commitment. Both Jim McConnon, Laker's replacement, and Vic Wilson were controversial <b>choices</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> 1954–55 Australian tour, whose selections Trevor Bailey attributed to Hutton; neither played a substantial role on the tour. A poor communicator, Hutton distanced himself from his team when a stronger lead was required. Trueman and Bailey thought Hutton {{found it hard to}} talk to his players: amateur critics considered this an inevitable consequence of a professional leading other professionals. On the other hand, Hutton {{played a key role in}} the development of fast bowlers Trueman, Tyson and Brian Statham. Tyson and Statham later acknowledged his advice and encouragement as factor in their subsequent success. Cowdrey also acknowledged Hutton's advice and assistance when the former began his career. Furthermore, on the 1954–55 tour of Australia, Hutton took a close interest in him and was a particular comfort when Cowdrey's father died during the tour.|$|E
