Geophones are more sensitive to disturbance immediately before the impact since the initial error is integrated. Geophones however are much cheaper than seismometers.

40|$|In {{the present}} work, {{the problem of}} an {{infinite}} elastic-perfectly plastic plate under axisymmetrical loading conditions resting on a Pasternak elastic foundation is considered. The plate is assumed thin, thus making possible to neglect the shear deformation according to the classical Kirchhoff theory. Yielding is governed by the Johansen’s yield criterion with associative flow rule. An uniformly distributed load is applied on a circular area {{on the top of}} the plate. As <b>the</b> <b>load</b> is increased, a circular elastic-plastic region spreads out starting from <b>the</b> <b>center</b> of <b>the</b> <b>loaded</b> area, whereas <b>the</b> outer unbounded region behaves elastically. Depending on the size of <b>the</b> <b>loaded</b> area, under <b>the</b> collapse <b>load</b> <b>the</b> inner elastic-plastic region can be separated into two or three different regions, corresponding to different yield loci. A closed form solution of the governing equations for each region is found for a special value of the ratio between Pasternak soil moduli. The performed analysis allows to estimate the elastic-plastic behavior of the plate up to the onset of collapse, thus providing <b>the</b> collapse <b>load</b> of <b>the</b> plate, the corresponding plastic mechanism and the size of the elastic-plastic regions. The influence of the soil moduli, plate bending stiffness, and size of <b>the</b> <b>loaded</b> area on <b>the</b> ultimate bearing capacity of the plate is then investigated in detail...|$|R

40|$|By {{analogy with}} lunar mare ridges and from morphologic evidence, {{such as the}} smooth slopes of arches, the wrinkle ridges of the Tharsis region of Mars are {{interpreted}} to primarily result from compressional folding of the volcanic plains. Comparison of ridge orientations in the Lunae Palus and Coprates quadrangles to a Tharsis center indicates that more than 60 % of the total length of ridges is orthogonal to a normal from this center. Graben trends in surrounding terrain indicate that nonorthogonal ridges are not significantly affected by regional scale structures. Comparison of orthogonal and nonorthogonal ridge frequencies suggests that <b>loading</b> due to <b>the</b> Tharsis plateau produced compressional features as far as 4000 km from <b>the</b> <b>center</b> of <b>the</b> <b>load,</b> and that additional compressional stress sources are needed to account for ridge systems at greater distances from the Tharsis plateau...|$|R
40|$|Geophysical {{models of}} {{flexural}} stresses in an elastic lithosphere {{due to an}} axisymmetric surface load typically predict a transition with increased distance from <b>the</b> <b>center</b> of <b>the</b> <b>load</b> of radial thrust faults to strike-slip faults to concentric normal faults. These model predictions are {{in conflict with the}} absence of annular zones of strike-slip faults around prominent loads such as lunar maria, Martian volcanoes, and the Martian Tharsis rise. We suggest that this paradox arises from difficulties in relating failure criteria for brittle rocks to the stress models. Indications that model stresses are inappropriate for use in fault-type prediction include (1) tensile principal stresses larger than realistic values of rock tensile strength, and/or (2) stress differences significantly larger than those allowed by rock-strength criteria. Predictions of surface faulting that are consistent with observations can be obtained instead by using tensile and shear failure criteria, along with calculated stress differences and trajectories, with model stress states not greatly in excess of the maximum allowed by rock fracture criteria...|$|R

40|$|The Autonomous Cooperative data Transfer Protocol (ACT protocol) {{is one of}} {{the data}} {{transfer}} protocols based on UDP/IP developed for the Metropolitan Seismic Observation network (MeSO-net). It has a robust re-send function to prevent data from being lost in the Internet route. Moreover, it also has a function to adjust the data transmission rate considering the quality of the Internet route and <b>the</b> <b>load</b> on <b>the</b> data-receiving system. If the Internet route is too busy to send all data, the transmission rate from the observation station is decreased automatically to ease the Internet traffic jam, and data that cannot be sent because of the limitation on the transmission rate are stored at each station. After conditions recover, the stored data are sent automatically at an increasing transmission rate and gradually catch up with real-time data. The transmission rate is decided by data transmission equipment at the station using pre-loaded algorithms, not at <b>the</b> data <b>center.</b> Therefore, <b>the</b> <b>load</b> at data <b>center</b> equipment is not so high even if the equipment receives data from hundreds of stations. We describe an overview of the ACT protocol, flow charts, and data format used in the protocol.
