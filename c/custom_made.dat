5|$|In the 1880s, Edward was {{a regular}} habitué of Parisian brothels, most notably Le Chabanais, which was {{regarded}} as the top establishment in Paris where brothels were legal. One room contained a <b>custom</b> <b>made</b> bath which was sometimes filled with champagne; and a specially designed and crafted siège d'amour (love seat) that allowed easy access for oral {{and other forms of}} sex for two or three people. It is now a museum piece.|$|E
5|$|Tony Iommi {{has been}} {{credited}} as the pioneer of lighter gauge guitar strings. The {{tips of his}} fingers were severed in a steel factory, and while using thimbles (artificial finger tips) he found that standard guitar strings were too difficult to bend and play. He found that there was only one size of strings available, so after years with Sabbath he had strings <b>custom</b> <b>made.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 2002, both <b>Custom</b> <b>Made</b> and Giltedge were {{retired from}} {{competition}}. In 2004, O'Connor retired from competition and quickly {{became involved in}} administrative aspects of the three-day eventing world. He served as the President of the United States Equestrian Federation from 2004 to 2012. In 2006, O'Connor was appointed the International Technical Advisor to the Canadian national eventing team.

5|$|Some winter service vehicles, {{especially}} those {{designed for use}} on footpaths or pedestrian zones, are built on a far smaller chassis using small tractors or <b>custom</b> <b>made</b> vehicles. These vehicles are often multi-purpose, and can be fitted with other equipment such as brushes, lawnmowers or cranes—as these operations are generally unable to run during heavy snowfalls, there is generally little overlap between the different uses, reducing {{the size of the}} fleet required by the agency or contractor.|$|E
5|$|After Hardy's client Adam Cole {{defeated}} Jay Briscoe {{to become}} the Undisputed Ring of Honor World Champion, Cole presented Jay Briscoe's <b>custom</b> <b>made</b> world championship belt (Briscoe claimed to still be the Ring of Honor champion as he forfeited the title due to injury and never officially lost it) to Hardy as a show of appreciation, Hardy re-branded the belt as the Ring of Honor Iconic (Innovative Creator and Originator of a New-Found Industry Champion) Championship, however, the title has not been sanctioned as an official championship by Ring of Honor. On June 22, 2014 at Best in the World, Hardy and Michael Bennett were defeated by The Briscoe Brothers in a no disqualification tag team match. In July, Hardy opted out of his ROH contract {{and went back to}} TNA.|$|E
5|$|In the US, {{there are}} four types of ambulances. There are Type I, Type II, Type III and Type IV. Type I is based upon a heavy truck chassis and is used {{primarily}} for Advanced Life Support and rescue work. Type II is a van based ambulance with little modifications except for a raised roof. Its use is for basic life support and transfer of patients. The Type III is a van chassis but with a <b>custom</b> <b>made</b> rear compartment and has the same use as Type I ambulances. Type IV's are nomenclature for smaller ad hoc patient transfer using smaller utility vehicles where passenger vehicles and trucks would have difficulty in traversing, such as large industrial complexes, commercial venues, and special events with large crowds. These do not, generally, fall under Federal Regulations.|$|E

5|$|The {{motorcycle}} sidecar missile used in one chase sequence {{was built}} by film staff at Pinewood and used a standard Kawasaki Z900 and a <b>custom</b> <b>made</b> sidecar outfit. The sidecar was made large enough so that a stuntman could lie flat inside. It had two 10 inch scooter wheels on each side, a Suzuki 185 engine and the detached projectile was steered through a small solid rubber wheel at the front. A heavily smoked perspex nose allowed the stuntman sufficient visibility to steer the device whilst being entirely hidden from view. A pincer type lock held the sidecar in place until operated by the pilot via a solenoid switch. The sequences involving the outfit were speeded up as {{the weight of the}} sidecar made the outfit very difficult to control.|$|E
5|$|Carbon fibre is {{actually}} a carbon-fiber-reinforced polymer, and is a strong, light-weight material used {{in a number of}} applications, including sporting goods like baseball bats, car parts, helmets, sailboats, bicycles and other equipment where rigidity and high strength-to-weight ratio is important. The polymer used for this equipment is normally epoxy, but other polymers are also used, depending on the application, and other reinforcing fibres may also be included. In the blade manufacturing process, sheets of impregnated material are cut into square sheets and pressed onto a form to produce the final shape. From 30 to 90 sheets may be layered, depending on the expected weight of the athlete, and the mold is then autoclaved to fuse the sheets into a solid plate. This method reduces air bubbles that can cause breaks. Once the result is cooled, it is cut into the shape of the blades. The finished blade is bolted to a carbon fibre socket that is an intimate fit to each of Pistorius' legs. These are <b>custom</b> <b>made</b> and make up the bulk of the total cost, along with the assessment and setting up of the finished prostheses. Each limb costs between $15–18,000 USD.|$|E
5|$|Verena Dietzel, {{creator of}} the fashion label V-Couture, who specializes in {{different}} kinds of corsets, were enlisted to create clothing for the video, {{as well as a}} Grammy Awards performance. Dietzel explained that she had initially thought Madonna's e-mail as spam, however after confirmation from the singer's assistant stylist, B. Åkerlund, she started working on the designs. Within 48 hours she sewed a new corset, as well as created two new ones, by basing them on the only information provided to her, that of Madonna's bra-size. She had to search on Google for deducing the rest of the singer's proportions. In total four different corsets were shipped off to Madonna. Lebanese designer Shady Zeineldine was also contacted by Åkerlund, who visited the designer's press conference in Los Angeles, and asked him to send his ideas and sketches for the video. After the deal was finalized, he created a <b>custom</b> <b>made</b> matador jacket which Madonna wore in the video. Another dress was a bodysuit, featuring a nude satin-stretch corset covered in three different types of lace, a black chiffon silk top and a satin tie. There was also a red velvet bolero jacket.|$|E

5|$|Hanneman used a black Gibson Les Paul {{modified}} with a Kahler Pro tremolo and a Joe Barden Two/Tone Humbucker bridge {{pickup in}} Slayer's early days {{and through the}} Show No Mercy and Hell Awaits era. In mid 1985 he began playing B.C. Rich guitars, notably a Rich Bich model he bought off his band colleague Kerry King, which he subsequently applied various graphics to. His first Bich had a 3x3 headstock, chrome hardware (including the Kahler Pro bridge) and the pickups were DiMarzio Super Distortions. He and King can both also be seen with {{a second set of}} B.C. Rich's around 1986-1987, which had 6-in-line headstocks, black hardware and DiMarzio pickups. He also used a B.C. Rich Ironbird model more rarely. From 1987, he was seen using a <b>custom</b> <b>made</b> B.C. Rich Gunslinger with similar specs as his '86-'87 era Bich, shortly after he had the pickups replaced with two active EMG 81 humbuckers. In 1988 he began playing the famous Jackson Soloist that he would use constantly as his main guitar for songs played in E-flat tuning until 2001. It was originally shipped to him with passive Jackson pickups (probably a J-50 and J-80) and a JE-1200 mid-boost circuit, but the pickups were soon changed for EMG 81 pickups and the mid-boost circuit was removed as well. Around 1990-1991 Hanneman began using ESP guitars, he mostly used as backup for this Jackson Soloist and other tunings. He had his own signature model made, based on the specs of his original Jackson Soloist. In 2000, Hanneman switched to ESP guitars, which he used exclusively until he stopped touring in early 2011. ESP also gave Hanneman his own signature model (see below), which is still available for purchase. When touring, Hanneman carried six guitars due to the different tunings he utilized. Most albums such as Haunting the Chapel – Divine Intervention and World Painted Blood have E-flat tuning. However, albums such as Diabolus in Musica – Christ Illusion feature alternate tunings such as Drop B and utilizing seven string guitars. The first album, Show No Mercy, was recorded in standard tuning, while live performances of those songs were played in E-flat since about 1984.|$|E
