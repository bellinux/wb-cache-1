40|$|A new {{analysis}} {{procedure for}} fungicides {{has been developed}} gearing toward estimation of worker exposure in greenhouses. The procedure includes sampling on leaves, glass, and polymers using vinclozolin and triadimefon as model substances and starts with solvation of the fungicides with ethanol from the surface. It proceeds by collection of the solution on disks of <b>cloth,</b> <b>disk</b> extraction with excess of ethanol, evaporation of the solution to dryness, and addition of 1 -chlorobutane and ends finally with HPLC determination. Validations of the evaporation step, the desorption of analyte from the disks, and the whole procedure were performed separately. The whole procedure gave recoveries of vinclozolin and triadimefon on leaves of 74 % (RSD 4. 2 %) and 79 % (RSD 5. 0 %), respectively, and on hard surfaces around 90 % (RSD ca. 6 %) for both substances. The losses in the evaporation and in the desorption step were small, the major losses occurring when the fungicide was collected from the surface. Also, some degradation products of vinclozolin and triadimefon, i. e., 3, 5 -dichloroaniline, triadimenol, and p-chlorophenol, were briefly studied...|$|E

40|$|An {{epithelial}} cell line (MDCK) {{was used to}} prepare monolayers which, in vitro, develop properties of transporting epithelia. Monolayers were formed by plating cells at high densities (106 cells/cm") on collagen-coated nylon <b>cloth</b> <b>disks</b> to saturate the area available for attachment, thus avoiding the need for cell division. An electrical resistance developed within 4 - 6 h after plating and achieved a steady-state value of 104 _ 1. 8 l). cm z after 24 h. Mature monolayers were morphologically and functionally polarized. They contained junctional complexes composed of desmosomes and tight junctions with properties {{similar to those of}} "leaky " epithelia. Monolayers were capable of maintaining a spontaneous electrical potential sensitive to amiloride, produced a net water flux from the apical to basal side, and discriminated between Na § and CI- ions. The MDCK permeability barrier behaves as a "thin " membrane with negatively charged sites. It has: (a) a linear conductance/concentration relationship; (b) an asymmetric instantaneous current/voltage relationship; (c) a reduced ability t...|$|R
40|$|Sustainable {{rates of}} sebaceous wax ester {{secretion}} were measured on the foreheads of 109 men and 167 women, aged 15 - 97. Each measurement was made after first depleting the cutaneous sebum reservoir by overnight absorption of lipid into {{a layer of}} bentonite clay. Lipid was then absorbed for 3 h into fresh clay in which two 2 -cm <b>cloth</b> <b>disks</b> were embedded. The absorbed lipid was extracted from the disks with ether and analyzed for wax esters by thin-layer chromatography. For {{both men and women}} there was a wide range of wax ester secretion rates at all ages. Rates were highest in the 15 - to 35 -year-olds and appeared to decline continuously throughout the adult age range. Values of log(wax esters) were better correlated with age than the untransformed values of wax ester secretion. The equations of best fit of log(wax esters) vs age suggested that sebum secretion declines about 23 % per decade in men and 32 % per decade in women...|$|R
40|$|An {{epithelial}} cell line (MDCK) {{was used to}} prepare monolayers which, in vitro, develop properties of transporting epithelia. Monolayers were formed by plating cells at high densities (10 (6) cells/cm 2) on collagen- coated nylon <b>cloth</b> <b>disks</b> to saturate the area available for attachment, thus avoiding the need for cell division. An electrical resistance developed within 4 - 6 h after plating and achieved a steady-state value of 104 +/- 1. 8 omega-cm 2 after 24 h. Mature monolayers were morphologically and functionally polarized. They contained junctional complexes composed of desmosomes and tight junctions with properties {{similar to those of}} "leaky" epithelia. Monolayers were capable of maintaining a spontaneous electrical potential sensitive to amiloride, produced a net water flux from the apical to basal side, and discriminated between Na+ and Cl- ions. The MDCK permeability barrier behaves as a "thin" membrane with negatively charged sites. It has: (a) a linear conductance/concentration relationship; (b) an asymmetric instantaneous current/voltage relationship; (c) a reduced ability to discriminate between Na+ and Cl- caused by lowering the pH; and (d) a characteristic pattern of ionic selectivity which suggests that the negatively charged sites are highly hydrates and of medium field strength. Measurements of Na+ permeability of electrical and tracer methods ruled out exchange diffusion as a mechanism for ion permeation and the lack of current saturation in the I/deltapsi curves does not support the involvement of carriers. The discrimination between Na+ and Cl- was severely but reversibly decreased at low pH, suggesting that Na+-specific channels which exclude Cl- contain acidic groups dissociated at neutral pH. Bound Ca++ ions are involved in maintaining the integrity of the junctions in MDCK monolayers as was shown by a reversible drop of resistance and opening of the junctions in Ca++-free medium containing EGTA. Several other {{epithelial cell}} lines are capable of developing a significant resistance under the conditions used to obtain MDCK monolayers...|$|R

Little did I know that what I was describing was the sudden emergence, at that very moment, of an entirely new music in French Guiana's fellow Départements d'Outre-Mer to the north, Martinique and Guadeloupe. Down in Cayenne, which has always had close ties to the French Antilles, there was a feeling in the air that some fresh and invigorating cultural trend was about to burst forth. Even in the Maroon villages of the French Guianese interior, where I relocated in early 1984, the excitement was palpable...|$|R
