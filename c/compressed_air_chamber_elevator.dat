Modern variations may employ <b>compressed</b> <b>air,</b> rubber <b>chambers,</b> springs, peristaltic pumps, or hydraulic pressure to propel the water.

50|$|Diaphragm valve: A {{diaphragm}} valve {{is used in}} pneumatic cannons where the barrel is within the <b>air</b> <b>chamber.</b> It is a disk of flexible material mounted directly behind the barrel that seals it when pressure is increased behind the disk. The design is such that air leaks past the diaphragm from behind it to the chamber around the barrel, sealing the soft rubber against {{the butt of the}} barrel. Once the chamber is fully pressurised the <b>compressed</b> <b>air</b> behind the diaphragm is quickly vented, causing the centre of the diaphragm to flex backwards, exposing the butt of the barrel to the <b>compressed</b> <b>air</b> inside the <b>chamber,</b> which rapidly exhausts through the barrel, launching the projectile. Sprinkler valves have also been modified to act in the same manner a {{diaphragm valve}} operates; changing the triggering of the valve to a release of air controlled by a blowgun valve, rather than electronically.|$|R

40|$|Blast injury {{has been}} coined the 2 ̆ 2 {{signature}} injury of the Iraq war 2 ̆ 2 {{resulting in a}} surge of interest in understanding and addressing the corresponding pathological sequelae. As modern warfare develops into a distinctly guerrilla style combat by smaller terrorist groups against larger, regimented forces, tactics like suicide bombing and roadside bombing with Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs) become more prevalent. 1, 2 This increased use of IEDs countered with improved body armor and protective technologies has significantly increased the survival rate of such attacks. 1. 2 However, as survival rates have improved with body armor and other protective technologies, the incidence of reported head and neck injuries has increased 2 {{and with it the}} incidence of long term cognitive, emotional, social and attentional deficits. These symptoms and disorders are not limited to the battlefield; these are the same veterans who eventually return home and often have difficulty coping with transition to civilian life and {{a better understanding of the}} mechanisms and etiology of these disorders should assist in early intervention strategies to improve long-term recovery outcomes. ^ Our lab has developed an animal model for blast injury using a <b>compressed</b> <b>air</b> <b>chamber</b> to deliver rapid explosive-like shock-wave exposures. The data shown here demonstrate physical, behavioral and biomarker based metrics used to evaluate the clinical relevance and severity of our injury model. The physical evaluation consisted of dynamic pressure transducer measurements to verify the range-dependent peak overpressure elicited by the blast. Following some initial evaluation of different exposure intensities, a mild blast was chosen for further analysis as a model surrogate for nonlethal blast exposure. Behavioral analysis using both an open-field exploration box and rotarod demonstrated no significant, gross motor deficits resulting from blast injury. However, further analysis using a tail swing tests suggest this injury model elicits significant depression-like symptoms compared to controls. Tissue and systemic-level examination for evidence of stress included assays for corticotrophin releasing factor(CRF), a known factor in neural circuits for anxiety and depression, and acrolein bound protein adducts in tissue and urine, markers of oxidative stress, indicative of membrane damage and lipid peroxidation. All three of these measured significant elevation in blast exposed animals. Imaging of extravasations of serum albumin, elevated in blast exposed animals indicated a possible mechanism of injury to the brain via inflammatory response to a foreign agent. ^ This model represents an avenue for examining the etiology of blast induced neurotrauma, biomarkers for early detection, and evaluation of potential treatment strategies to alleviate long-term deficits which may arise from secondary injury mechanisms like oxidative stress and neuroinflammatory responses. ...|$|R

DETAILED DESCRIPTION - A process for stamping structures on a carrier (1), especially hot stamping, comprises positioning a film (2) relative to the carrier, pressing the film to stamp out the desired structure (4) from the film, and removal of residual film (5). The stamper has one or more integral channels (6) which feed into intermediate chambers. Pressure in the channels is reduced when the stamper is raised from the carrier. The film consists of a metallic material and is used to produce conductors on the carrier. After the stamper has been raised, residual film material is removed using <b>compressed</b> <b>air.</b> The intermediate <b>chambers</b> are partially filled with an elastomer material. The stamping arrangement consists of a stamper that holds a stamping structure, a vacuum pump connected to the intermediate channels, and a heating unit.

40|$|A new cooling {{approach}} with cryogenic <b>compressed</b> <b>air</b> {{has been developed}} in order to cool the cutting tool edge during turning of Ti- 6 Al- 4 V alloy.

The chip temperature is lower with cryogenic <b>compressed</b> <b>air</b> cooling than those with <b>compressed</b> <b>air</b> cooling and dry machining. The combined effects of reduced friction and chip bending away from the cutting zone {{as a result of}} the high-speed air produce a thinner chip with cryogenic <b>compressed</b> <b>air</b> cooling and a thicker chip with <b>compressed</b> <b>air</b> cooling compared to dry machining alone. The marginally higher cutting force associated with the application of cryogenic <b>compressed</b> <b>air</b> compared with dry machining is the result of lower chip temperatures and a higher shear plane angle. The tendency to form a segmented chip is higher when machining with cryogenic <b>compressed</b> <b>air</b> than that with <b>compressed</b> <b>air</b> and dry machining only within the ranges of cutting speed and feed when chip transitions from continuous to the segmented. The effect of cryogenic <b>compressed</b> <b>air</b> on the cutting force and chip formation diminishes with increase in cutting speed and feed rate. The application of both <b>compressed</b> <b>air</b> and cryogenic <b>compressed</b> <b>air</b> reduced flank wear and the tendency to form the chip built-up edge.
