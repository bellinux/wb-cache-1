40|$|My master’s {{thesis is}} about multisensory {{approaches}} in visual art. In my work, {{this point of}} view is closely connected to the issues of accessibility and sharing. In my art, I combine vision, smell and touch. My thesis contributes to the field of visual culture as it observes both the production and reception of fine art based on sensory integration. The focus of my work is to experiment how multisensory approach may open alternative ways to access visual art and in what way an artist could better support participation on an equal yet diverse level. My plan has been to develop an experimental work of art, to create something small and uncertain. At the same time, my ambition was to incorporate in this project my experience of making installations and exhibitions. Carrying out this project made me face the problem of transforming my ideas into a small-scale format. My attempt to provide an intimate presentation of a small object also raised the question whether it is at all relevant to present it in an exhibition? I began this process with a version of a portable series of multisensory objects, which I subsequently developed into a more subtle artwork.. Through the process of making participatory installations, exhibitions and workshops I developed my new, portable artwork called “me”, we in Finnish. The experimental pieces are small, personal, intimate multisensory pads produced of <b>copper,</b> <b>felt</b> and scents. These are sense notes or messages accessible through visual, tactile and olfactory sense. The disk is handful and the weight of the copper gives it a suitable proportion. The fragrances impregnating the felt Braille are uniting the history of perfume and the cultural-bound scents living together today in Finland. One of the pieces has the Braille letter “m” on it, the other one has “e”. In Finnish “me” is the first person plural form of the personal pronoun, it is “we”. My intention was to focus on the Finnish meaning of the word: the two separate olfactory cultures living together as “us”. The beholders' touch is not only going to transform the shiny copper and the white felt into a “caressed condition”, but the two olfactory landscapes are going to be blended together...|$|E
40|$|The {{atmospheric}} concentration of CO 2 has increased significantly {{during the last}} two centuries. Since CO 2 is considered {{to be one of the}} largest contributors to the greenhouse effect and is postulated to cause global warming, it is important to stabilize and/or reduce its concentration. Apart from regulations for the amount of CO 2 that may be emmitted, carbon dioxide capture and storage (CCS), biological and chemical conversions are potential ways to stabilize and/or reduce the {{atmospheric concentration}} of CO 2. In the present thesis, the electrochemical CO 2 reduction in an electrochemical membrane reactor (ecMR) was investigated. An ecMR consists of two half-cells separated by a polymer electrolyte membrane. An electrical potential is applied as driving force for the reaction. The production of protons by the electrolysis of water takes place at the anode catalyst. The produced protons are transported through a cation exchange membrane (CEM) and electrons are transported via the external circuit to the cathode to reduce CO 2 (g) to hydrocarbons as desired products. The main undesired side reaction is the H 2 evolution. According to literature, Cu is the most promising catalyst material for the electrochemical CO 2 reduction if the focus is on the production of hydrocarbons. The Cu cathode catalyst was prepared by using electroplating on 3 D-structured woven stainless steel meshes. In order to receive a thin and uniform Cu layer on the 3 D-structured woven stainless steel mesh, the electroplating has to be performed at limiting current density. Higher temperatures and/or rotation speeds of the plating target caused an increase in the limiting current density. The electrochemical experiments for the reduction of CO 2 were performed in a G-G and a G-L type ecMR. Membrane electrode assemblies (MEA) were applied when gaseous reactants were involved. A MEA can be used to create a so-called three-phase boundary, whereby (i) the electrocatalyst, (ii) the ionomer/electrolyte and (iii) the reactant are in contact. In the G-G type ecMR a double-sided MEA was used comprising of a <b>copper</b> <b>felt</b> cathode and a Ti felt anode coated with iridium mixed metal oxide (IrMMO) catalysts separated by a proton conductive membrane. Here, IrMMO is used as anode catalyst, since it showed a high activity for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). In the G-L type ecMR a one-sided MEA was applied that only consists of the copper cathode and the CEM. The production of hydrocarbons with low current efficiency was achieved in both reactor types. The experiments performed with a G-L type ecMR did not show a limiting current density, which was the case when G-G type ecMR was used. A possible reason for the absence of the limiting current density is the conductivity of the membrane, which is increasing at higher relative humidity. Next to the experimental work, the electrochemical CO 2 reduction in a G-L type ecMR was modelled in Aspen+. Further, the activity and stability testing of a new Pt/Ir/V catalyst was carried out for the OER in acidic environment. The overpotential of Pt/Ir catalysts for the OER at 2 mA/cm 2 decreased with increasing Ir content for all studied temperatures. The V-containing catalysts deactivated during the stability measurements. However, the Pt/Ir catalysts showed only a slight deactivation, whereas pure Pt catalysts were stable after a whole period of stability tests. Besides, the activity for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) of the new Pt/Ir/V catalyst was determined. The Pt 65 Ir 22 V 13 catalyst showed the highest activity for the ORR...|$|E

40|$|A novel porous <b>copper</b> fiber {{sintered}} <b>felt</b> (PCFSF) as {{catalyst support}} is fabricated {{to construct the}} methanol steam reforming microreactor for hydrogen production. In this study, the heat and mass transfer properties of PCFSF with different porosities is experimentally investigated. The {{results show that the}} PCFSF with different porosities exhibits good uniform heat transfer. The thermal conductivity is decreased with increasing porosity in the porosity range of 70 - 90 %. With lower gas feed rate, no great change of the pressure drop is observed. However, larger pressure drop is produced with the higher gas feed rates. Moreover, we found that the resident time in the PCFSF is gradually decreased with increasing porosity. Much longer resident time is obtained when the lower gas feed rate is selected. The PCFSF with 80 % porosity as catalyst support presents better reaction performance because of the enhancement of heat and mass transfer resulting from the unique porous structure.

40|$|The use {{of carbon}} felt as a {{three-dimensional}} electrode {{appears to be}} very promising for the recovery of heavy metals, and toxic compounds removal from dilute solutions, considering its favourable physico-chemical properties : high specific surface area, good fluid permeability and compressibility, chemical inertness and good electrical conductivity. This work presents {{the contribution of the}} carbon felt electrode in two different steps of the gold cyanidation recovery process : firstly as a cathode for the electrowinning of gold solution obtained after the elution of loaded carbon; secondly as an anode for the electro-oxidation of cyanide ions present at low concentration (200 - 300 mg/l) in waste streams. In the first case, more than 10 kg of gold per m(2) of felt (2000 kg of gold per m(3) of felt) can be loaded at 400 A/m(2) from dilute gold solutions (30 mg/l Au) with classic Faradic yields (6 - 12 %) and high overall extraction efficiency (> 90 %). The felt homogeneously loaded with adhesive gold deposit can be smelted in an electric furnace without addition of fluxes since the carbon felt decomposes in gaseous products without formation of ashes. In the second case, the cyanide ion concentration can be lowered to as low as 10 mg/l by electro-oxidation to cyanate form (CNO-) at 400 A/m 2 in the anodic compartment of a divided cell. The presence of copper ion significantly improves the current efficiency of this electro-oxidation and sharply reduces the oxidation of the carbon <b>felt.</b> <b>Copper</b> ions accelerate the oxidation rate of free cyanide ions through the formation of easily oxidizable complexes owing to a mechanism in which the Cu-I/Cu-II redox couple acts as an electron transfer mediator.
