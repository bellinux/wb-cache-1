40|$|Abstract- After a {{cryogenic}} fluid has been liquefied and purified {{to the desired}} level; it must then be stored and transported. Cryogenic fluid storage-vessel and transfer line design has progressed rapidly {{as a result of}} the growing use of cryogenic liquids in many areas of engineering and science. The development of the Dewar vessel represented such an improvement in <b>cryogenic</b> fluid <b>storage</b> <b>vessels</b> that it could be classed as a “break-through ” in container design. The high performance <b>storage</b> <b>vessels</b> in use today are based on the concept of the Dewar design principle a double walled container with the space between the two vessels filled with an insulation and the evacuated from the space. The detailed conventional-cryogenic-fluid <b>storage</b> <b>vessel</b> design is covered in such standards as the American society of mechanical engineers (ASME) boiler and pressure vessel code, section VIII (1983), and British Standards Institution standards 1500 or 1515. Most users require that the vessels be designed, fabricated, and tested according to the code for sizes larger than about 250 dm 3 i. e. 66 U. S. gallons, because of the proven safety code design. <b>Cryogenic</b> <b>storage</b> <b>vessels</b> are pressure vessels are used for <b>storage</b> <b>cryogenic</b> liquids with minimum heat in-leak into the vessel from the outside as far as possible. The challenge of design is to use such materials that do not lose their desirable properties at such a low temperature. Here the utmost care is taken to design a <b>storage</b> <b>vessel</b> satisfying both mechanical and thermal design. The results will be compared to the existing vessel of industry...|$|R

Lack of insulation in the tanks (as existed in the pad B hydrogen tank at Kennedy Space Center) results in an excessive loss of commodity and can pose operational and safety risks if precautions are not taken to relieve the excessive gas build-up.

40|$|Double-wall <b>cryogenic</b> <b>storage</b> <b>vessels</b> {{containing}} perlite insulation {{are used}} to store LH 2 for test firing of NASA rockets. The vessels have been designed using {{the assumption that the}} perlite offers negligible structural resistance thus permitting the vessel to freely expand or contract under thermal cycles. Observation of perlite compaction has led to concern that after many loading cycles the perlite would become compacted enough to cause significant load transfer between the inner and outer tank, possibly causing structural damage. This study describes a detailed analysis of the potential for perlite compaction and assesses the potential for structural damage as a result of compaction. A finite element stress analysis program coded in FORTRAN was developed and implemented for this investigation. The vessel model was examined with dynamic and thermal loads to determine the effects by the given loads. The endochronic theory of plasticity was used to model the perlite insulation. Various tests were performed on the perlite to determine the parameters required by the model constitutive equations. These constitutive equations were then entered into the FEA program and the results compared with the test results. PublishedN/...|$|R
40|$|Collapsible <b>cryogenic</b> <b>storage</b> <b>vessels</b> may {{be useful}} for future space {{exploration}} missions by providing long-term storage capability using a lightweight system that can be compactly packaged for launch. Previous development efforts have identified an 'inflatable' concept as most promising. In the inflatable tank concept, the cryogen is contained within a flexible pressure wall comprised of a flexible bladder to contain the cryogen and a fabric reinforcement layer for structural strength. A flexible, high-performance insulation jacket surrounds the vessel. The weight of the tank and the cryogen is supported by rigid support structures. This design concept is developed through physical testing of a scaled pressure wall, and through development of tests for a flexible Layered Composite Insulation (LCI) insulation jacket. A demonstration pressure wall is fabricated using Spectra fabric for reinforcement, and burst tested under noncryogenic conditions. An insulation test specimens is prepared to demonstrate {{the effectiveness of the}} insulation when subject to folding effects, and to examine the effect of compression of the insulation under compressive loading to simulate the pressure effect in a nonrigid insulation blanket under the action atmospheric pressure, such as would be seen in application on the surface of Mars. Although pressure testing did not meet the design goals, the concept shows promise for the design.

40|$|Thesis (MIng (Mechanical Engineering)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2013 Current {{physical}} supports used in <b>cryogenic</b> <b>storage</b> <b>vessels,</b> {{in which}} liquid hydrogen is stored, conduct {{heat from the}} environment to the liquid hydrogen which causes the hydrogen temperature to rise and ultimately leads to hydrogen losses due to boil-off. The focus {{of this study is}} to investigate magnetic levitation as a possible suspension mechanism, eliminating the use of current physical supports and so doing reducing hydrogen losses due to boil-off. A conceptual design of a container which makes use of magnetic suspension is presented in this study. The concept is validated on the basis of the forces obtainable between a paramagnetic aluminium plate and an electromagnet, as well as the forces obtainable between a neodymium magnet and a bulk Yttrium-Barium-Copper-Oxide superconductor. The forces between the paramagnetic aluminium plate and electromagnet were determined mathematically and tested experimentally. The forces between the magnet and superconductor were determined mathematically and by finite element modelling and simulations using ANSYS Multiphysics. The results obtained in the mathematical- and finite element studies were then validated experimentally. It was found that the forces obtained experimentally between the aluminium plate and electromagnets are inadequate for magnetic suspension of the inner vessel given in the conceptual design. It was also found that the forces obtained experimentally and in the simulation studies for the magnet and superconductor of this study were inadequate due to shortcomings in the magnet and superconductor obtained for experimental tests. The conclusion of this study is that electromagnetic levitation should not be used as a magnetic suspension mechanism for storage of liquid hydrogen. It is also concluded that superconducting levitation can not be used as a suspension mechanism for the concept presented in this study, unless the methods suggested to increase the levitation forces between the neodymium magnet and superconductor are executed.

5000|$|Thermoacoustic-induced {{oscillations}} {{have been}} observed for centuries. Glass blowers produced heat generated sound when blowing a hot bulb {{at the end of}} a cold narrow tube. This phenomenon also has been observed in <b>cryogenic</b> <b>storage</b> <b>vessels,</b> where oscillations are induced by the insertion of a hollow tube open at the bottom end in liquid helium, called Taconis oscillations, but the lack of heat removal system causes the temperature gradient to diminish and acoustic wave to weaken and then to stop completely. Byron Higgins made the first scientific observation of heat energy conversion into acoustical oscillations. He investigated the [...] "singing flame" [...] phenomena in a portion of a hydrogen flame in a tube with both ends open. Putnam and Dennis gave a survey of the related phenomena. Rijke introduced this phenomenon into a greater scale by using a heated wire screen to induce strong oscillations in a tube (the Rijke tube). Feldman mentioned in his related review that a convective air current through the pipe is the main inducer of this phenomenon. The oscillations are strongest when the screen is at one fourth of the tube length. Research performed by Sondhauss in 1850 is known to be the first to approximate the modern concept of thermoacoustic oscillation. Sondhauss experimentally investigated the oscillations related to glass blowers. Sondhauss observed that sound frequency and intensity depends on the length and volume of the bulb. Lord Rayleigh gave a qualitative explanation of the Sondhauss thermoacoustic oscillations phenomena, where he stated that producing any type of thermoacoustic oscillations needs to meet a criterion: [...] "If heat be given to the air at the moment of greatest condensation or taken from it at the moment of greatest rarefaction, the vibration is encouraged". This shows that he related thermoacoustics to the interplay of density variations and heat injection. The formal theoretical study of thermoacoustics started by Kramers in 1949 when he generalized the Kirchhoff theory of the attenuation of sound waves at constant temperature to the case of attenuation in the presence of a temperature gradient. Rott made a breakthrough in the study and modeling of thermodynamic phenomena by developing a successful linear theory. After that, the acoustical part of thermoacoustics was linked in a broad thermodynamic framework by Swift.|$|R
