5|$|Being {{a form of}} carbon, diamond oxidizes in air if heated over 700°C. In {{absence of}} oxygen, e.g. in a flow of high-purity argon gas, diamond can be heated up to about 1700°C. Its surface blackens, but can be {{recovered}} by re-polishing. At high pressure (~20GPa) diamond can be heated up to 2500°C, and a report published in 2009 suggests that diamond <b>can</b> <b>withstand</b> temperatures of 3000°C and above.|$|E
5|$|Brachychiton rupestris {{has been}} {{recorded}} as a host plant for the mistletoe species Dendrophthoe glabrescens. Insects hosted by the species include the pale cotton stainer bug, a pest of cotton crops, and the kurrajong leaf roller caterpillar that chews on the foliage and rolls individual leaves, within which it then pupates. Bottle tree scrub is a key habitat of the near threatened black-breasted buttonquail. Brachychiton rupestris <b>can</b> <b>withstand</b> bushfires and responds by flowering and putting forth new foliage afterwards.|$|E

5|$|Cockroaches are {{abundant}} {{throughout the world}} and live {{in a wide range}} of environments, especially in the tropics and subtropics. Cockroaches <b>can</b> <b>withstand</b> extremely cold temperatures, allowing them to live in the Arctic. Some species are capable of surviving temperatures of −188°F (−122°C) by manufacturing an antifreeze made out of glycerol. In North America, 50 species separated into five families are found throughout the continent. 450 species are found in Australia. Only about four widespread species are commonly regarded as pests.|$|E
5|$|Geologically, Plymouth has {{a mixture}} of limestone, Devonian slate, granite and Middle Devonian limestone. Plymouth Sound, Shores and Cliffs is a Site of Special Scientific Interest, because of its geology.

5|$|Ailanthus {{has been}} used to re-vegetate areas where acid mine {{drainage}} has occurred and it has been shown to tolerate pH levels as low as 4.1 (approximately that of tomato juice). It <b>can</b> <b>withstand</b> very low phosphorus levels and high salinity levels. The drought-tolerance of the tree is strong due to its ability to effectively store water in its root system. It is frequently found in areas where few trees can survive. The roots are also aggressive enough to cause damage to subterranean sewers and pipes. Along highways it often forms dense thickets in which few other tree species are present, largely due to the toxins it produces to prevent competition.|$|E
5|$|An active {{vibration}} control system, {{known as the}} active control of structural response system, reduces airframe vibration by up to 80% which increases crew comfort and minimises the buildup of stress on the airframe.

5|$|Married people, however, {{are advised}} not to worship Dhumavati. It {{is said that}} her worship creates a feeling of wanting {{solitude}} and distaste of worldly things, which is considered as highest characteristics of a spiritual quest. Thus, Dhumavati's worship is appropriate for world renouncers who roam as lone wanderers and widows who parallel the life of world renouncers. Dhumavati is also described a being partial to single persons and especially partial to widows. Widows are considered the only beings who <b>can</b> <b>withstand</b> her power.|$|E
5|$|Because {{germanium}} is transparent in {{the infrared}} wavelengths, {{it is an important}} infrared optical material that can be readily cut and polished into lenses and windows. It is especially used as the front optic in thermal imaging cameras working in the 8 to 14micron range for passive thermal imaging and for hot-spot detection in military, mobile night vision, and fire fighting applications. It is used in infrared spectroscopes and other optical equipment that require extremely sensitive infrared detectors. It has a very high refractive index (4.0) and must be coated with anti-reflection agents. Particularly, a very hard special antireflection coating of diamond-like carbon (DLC), refractive index 2.0, is a good match and produces a diamond-hard surface that <b>can</b> <b>withstand</b> much environmental abuse.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the harsh}} environment, several life forms {{have been found}} that <b>can</b> <b>withstand</b> extreme space {{conditions}} for extended periods. Species of lichen carried on the ESA BIOPAN facility survived exposure for ten days in 2007. Seeds of Arabidopsis thaliana and Nicotiana tabacum germinated after being exposed to space for 1.5 years. A strain of bacillus subtilis has survived 559 days when exposed to low-Earth orbit or a simulated martian environment. The lithopanspermia hypothesis suggests that rocks ejected into outer space from life-harboring planets may successfully transport life forms to another habitable world. A conjecture is that just such a scenario occurred early {{in the history of}} the Solar System, with potentially microorganism-bearing rocks being exchanged between Venus, Earth, and Mars.|$|E
