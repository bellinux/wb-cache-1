A third title in the series is already out and a fourth and fifth one, featuring retired Green Beret and combat veteran Frankie McRae are scheduled for release in late 2013.|$|E
40|$|This {{paper is}} the second in a series that {{describes}} the progress of work on a PhD thesis. The present paper focuses specifically on a waste wood chipping machine, its construction and working principle. The main problems are discussed as well as up-to-date technical improvements and optimization. It also describes the essential, characteristic parameters of the cutting regimes in the cheeping process. As a result, it has been established that {{the distance between the}} knives and counter knives is a cyclic variable, caused by cutting force-induced <b>counter</b> <b>knife</b> vibrations. A brief insight is given into the influence of vibration on cutting regimes. In the conclusion, further steps towards minimizing <b>counter</b> <b>knife</b> vibration are offered. Subsequent research is described, aimed at developing comprehensive diagnostic methods for wood cheeping machines...|$|E
5000|$|Two young warriors {{from the}} rebel Shaolin Clan {{are engaged in}} a deadly secret mission that could bring down the empire. Tung Chien-chen is the [...] "Shaolin Hercules", who is sent from Shaolin to take revenge on the local Wudang experts. Li Detong and Li Pashan are the Wudang chiefs who attempt to kill Tung using li Detong's {{throwing}} knives technique after meeting him in a restaurant. Tung barely escapes and meets up with Chin Tailei and his sister who teach him a special kungfu to <b>counter</b> <b>knives.</b> He eventually meets up with Hu Wei-chen who is another Shaolin student. Wei Sing-hung is the son of a Ming general who was adopted by Wudang, but in his heart he supports Shaolin and frequently questions why the Wudang sect supports the Qing but is usually hushed quickly by his masters. His love interest is Wang Li's daughter, Li Erh-wan.|$|R
50|$|A {{cutting board}} is kitchen utensil used in {{conjunction}} with a knife. It is a flat surface, generally made of either wood, plastic or glass (glass are less common because they dull the blade; used more for decoration), on which to cut food and which protects <b>counter</b> tops and <b>knives</b> from damage.|$|R
25|$|Stainless {{steel and}} {{aluminum}} handles are durable and sanitary, {{but can be}} slippery. To <b>counter</b> this, premium <b>knife</b> makers make handles with ridges, bumps, or indentations to provide extra grip. Another problem with knives that have metal handles is that, since metal is an excellent heat-conductor, these knives can be very uncomfortable, and even painful or dangerous, when handled without gloves or other protective handwear in (very) cold climates.|$|R
50|$|Tony {{was taken}} in for questioning, but {{released}} {{due to lack of}} evidence. Roy, believing Tony was in police custody, went to the canal to do some bat-watching. Tony confessed to Maria he'd been questioned by the police over Liam's murder. Scared, Maria left. When she returned, Tony was gone - he was at Roy's Rolls, hiding behind the <b>counter</b> with a <b>knife</b> in his hand. Maria arrived at the caf√© and begged Hayley to tell her what was going on, to which Hayley admitted Tony killed Liam. As Maria sobbed, Tony was shown silently crying, digging the knife into his hand.|$|R
50|$|All but Jenn go {{swimming}} in the lake. Sam and Mary discuss whether to tell Jenn about their affair, but they are interrupted when beavers chew off Buck's foot and scratch Tommy. The same beaver that attacked Jenn earlier chases {{her back to the}} house. She pins it to the <b>counter</b> with a <b>knife,</b> but not before it scratches her leg. Sam throws Zoe's dog into the water as a distraction, {{and the rest of the}} group flee to the house, where they realize the beavers have cut the phone lines. As zombie beavers surround the house, Tommy offers to leave with Buck to get help, and Zoe accompanies him. The beavers bring down a tree in the road, and Tommy sets off on foot, only to be crushed by another falling tree.|$|R
50|$|While Maria visits {{her parents}} in Cyprus, Tony suffers a heart attack. He is taken to {{hospital}} by Roy, {{with whom he had}} previously clashed over the new housing development and confesses Liam's murder to him. He tries to buy Roy's silence but it doesn't work so he begins threatening him. Roy and his wife Hayley (Julie Hesmondhalgh) report him to the police and Roy decides to go bat spotting at the canal. When Maria comes looking for answers, Hayley tells her everything, unaware Tony is hiding behind the cafe <b>counter</b> with a <b>knife.</b> This upsets Tony even more and he goes to the canal and pushes Roy in the water but rescues him and confesses to the police. On 11 December 2009, Carla visits Tony in prison where he admits that Jimmy is still alive. He asks her if she thinks Maria will forgive him and she tells him that she never would and that he would be going to hell on his own, before leaving.|$|R
40|$|In {{agricultural}} regions of Serbia, {{especially in the}} Province Vojvodina, Serbian part of Pannonia plane, maize is most significant crop. Almost all small and majority of medium farms apply harvesting by use of picker-husker. First after natural drying and threshing of grains, maize cobs are residual biomass available for energy use. Modern farmers need more comfort and advanced heating facilities, e. g. boilers with automatic feeding. The objective was to develop processor for maize cobs crushing. The cobs should be so sized to enable feeding by use of charging screw, commonly used for wood chips. This will enable, after adjustment of combustion technique, use of serial produced boilers and feeding equipment. The following prerequisites have been set up: the processor has to be low-cost type, and produced granulation should fulfil demands similar to these defined for wood chips used as a fuel. Using previous experience with similar material the prototype based on cylinder with spirally positioned knives, stationary comb type <b>knife</b> <b>counter</b> and under-sieve has been selected and designed. The effects of stationary knifes, RPM of cylinder, different under-sieve openings and distance of sieves to rotated knife trajectory has been tested, and crushed maize cobs analyzed. The results showed that this processor can be successfully used for crushing of maize cobs for it use as fuel in boilers with crew conveyor, commonly used for wood chips. The fuel flow, due to lower density of crushed maize cobs, should have about 1. 5 times bigger volume. The capacity of processor overcomes need of one user. It can supply enough fuel for four to five consumers...|$|R
