40|$|This study {{deals with}} the {{occurrence}} of thermophilic Campylobacter, Listeria, Escherichia coli, Yersinia enterocolitica and Salmonella in a sheep slaughterhouse in Brandenburg, Germany. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate, how these zoonotic agents are distributed within the slaughterhouse and the processing line. Simultaneously, an interrelation between slaughterhouse and the relevant sheep farms was to investigate. Investigations were carried out from July 2008 to August 2009. A total of 423 samples was obtained from 14 excursions. 320 samples using excision method at four process positions of the line, five points of the carcass (before depelting, after depelting, after evisceration and at chilling) and 103 environmental swab samples (floor of the lairage stable floor, fleece depelting machine, deposition board of carcasses after removing the fleece, doorknobs as well as wall of the <b>chilling</b> <b>room</b> and knifes) were collected. The excision samples were analysed for Aerobic Plate Count (APC) and Enterobacteriaceae Count (EC) and all samples qualitative for Campylobacter, Listeria, E. coli, Salmonella and Yersinia. Campylobacter and E. coli isolates were characterized by PFGE (Kpn I enzyme) and PCR respectively. Results: Hygiene For excision samples the mean APC (log 10 CFU/cm 2) was 3. 79, the mean EC (log 10 CFU/cm 2) was 1. 58. An increase in the number of bacteria during the process untill chilling was observed (process position 4). The microbiological carriage of the carcasses for APC and EB was significantly different depending upon the process position. Zoonotic agents Thermophilic Campylobacter, Listeria spp. and E. coli were identified with an average of 20. 1 %, 11. 1 % and 60. 1 % of all samples respectively. Yersinia enterocolitica and Salmonella were not found in any sample here. Campylobacter was detected in 20. 1 % (85 of 423) by conventional technique, the highest detection rate was obtained in samples from lairage stable floor samples (68. 2 %). Campylobacter was not detected in sterilisation bassins, at doorknobs or on the walls in the <b>chilling</b> <b>room.</b> The highest findings on the carcasses was in the <b>chilling</b> <b>room</b> (27. 5 %) (process position 4). The Campylobacter isolates were differentiated using conventional and PCR technique: C. jejuni (71. 3 % / 55. 7 %), C. coli (23. 8 % / 11. 4 %) and C. lari (5. 0 % / 14. 8 %) were detected. Listeria was detected in 11. 1 % (47 of 423) of samples, mostly in samples from lairage stable floor samples (27. 3 %). Listeria was not detected in sterilisation bassins, on doorknobs, at the wall in the <b>chilling</b> <b>room</b> or on the deposition board of carcasses after depelting. The highest prevalence on the carcasses was found before depelting (12. 5 %) and in the <b>chilling</b> <b>room</b> (12. 5 %). Listeria isolates were L. ivanovii (57. 4 %; 27 of 47), L. denitrificans (27. 7 %; 13 of 47), L. monocytogenes (8. 5; 4 out of 47 %) and L. innocua (2. 1 %; 1 of 47) were found. E. coli was detected in 60. 1 % (254 of 423) of all samples, most of them were from the samples of the lairage stable floor and fleece depelting machine (100. 0 % each). The highest prevalence on the carcasses was found in the <b>chilling</b> <b>room</b> (72. 5 %). For Campylobacter isolates using PFGE, a relationship between some sample qualities was observed: Within particular excursions and also for different ones, the patterns of PFGE indicate the same genetic sequences of Campylobacter. Hence, transfer of Campylobacter from farm in to the slaughterhouse and the meat production process can not be excluded. In conclusion, thermophilic Campylobacter, Listeria and E. coli were identified on carcasses and in environmental samples especially in the lairage stable floor samples. A transfer of these pathogens from the farms to the slaughterhouse can be assumed...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to study {{chilling}} of beef carcasses in on-farm slaughterhouses in Sweden. Two approaches to evaluate the chilling process were used. Firstly, continuous measurements of surface temperatures on individual carcasses and, secondly, a recent Australian method in which temperature readings were combined with a predictive microbiology growth model. In the Australian method the potential growth of Escherichia coli during chilling is calculated based on the growth rate estimated by the growth model at the measured temperatures. The potential growth during the chilling process is the expressed as a refrigeration index, RI, which is the log 10 of the potential increase of the number of E. coli bacteria during chilling. In addition, a simple tool, i. e. an Excel spreadsheet, was developed and evaluated. The tool enables an estimation of the cooling capacity needed for chilling beef, lamb, or swine. The primary purpose of the tool is to indicate the required cooling capacity in planned slaughterhouses based on drawings and slaughter volumes. The present study only considered aspects of chilling related to food safety. Eleven slaughterhouses participated in the survey, and chilling of a total of 169 carcasses, ranging from 4 to 10 per occasion, were measured.

40|$|Temperature {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} factors that affect quality and shelf life aspects of meat products. Hence meat industries start controlling temperature of the meat soon after slaughter. A common way of controlling meat temperature for commercial purpose is by chilling the meat at the carcasses stage in a <b>chiller</b> <b>room</b> in which cold air circulates. After slaughter, in muscle cells biochemical reactions continue to produce energy substrates like adenosine triphosphate (ATP) for the postmortem muscle activities. The hydrolysis of ATP in turn produces heat, which can raise muscle temperature a couple of degrees above the initial body temperature of the animal, and hydrogen ions, which reduce the pH of the muscles. Thus in practice, the heat load during beef carcass chilling consists of the original body heat of the carcass and the heat that is produced due to biochemical reactions. To achieve the desired meat quality and shelf life, the rate of heat removal from a carcass during chilling needs to be controlled in such a way that the pH fall has a desired rate, while inhibiting the growth of microorganisms on the surface. At low cooling rates the glycolysis rate remains high for a longer time. The associated production of hydrogen ions favors a faster pH decline than at high cooling rates. The combination of low pH and high temperature has negative consequences on specific meat quality traits such as color. In large beef carcasses, such as is the case for the double-muscled Belgian Blue breed, it has been observed that important temperature gradients can develop during cooling which results in spatial differences in final meat quality of muscles from a single carcass. Due to the complexity of the heat and mass transfer and muscle reaction kinetics during cooling, understanding of the cooling process is limited and it has been difficult to determine experimentally more optimal cooling procedures. The main objective of this thesis was, therefore, to develop a mathematical model that calculates the temperature and pH distribution inside a beef carcass during cooling in a <b>chiller</b> <b>room.</b> The model includes the different relevant heat and mass transfer mechanisms coupled to a simple kinetics model that predicts postmortem glycogen conversion, heat production and pH fall. The model was validated for chilling of Belgian Blue beef carcasses as affected by temperature, relative humidity and air velocity in the <b>chiller</b> <b>room.</b> The coupled model was then used for exploring different cooling scenarios. The kinetics model was developed for the muscle energy metabolism in postmortem conditions. A single equation model described the glycogen conversion using Michaelis-Menten kinetics. The model parameters were identified using pH and temperature measurements conducted on inner and outer positions of M. biceps femoris of large Belgian Blue carcasses at different commercial slaughterhouses and for two distinct cooling rates. The developed kinetics model was then integrated with a computational fluid dynamics model (CFD) to predict changes in temperature, pH and heat generation rate during the chilling of beef carcasses. The chilling model accounted for the slaughter floor environment and <b>chiller</b> <b>room</b> conditions and was solved on the 3 D geometry of a beef carcass obtained by digital scanning. A three-step approach was followed for the <b>chiller</b> <b>room</b> simulation. In the first step, a steady state simulation of the airflow and thermal field around the carcass was done. From this simulation, local convective transfer coefficients (CTCs) on the carcass surface were determined in a second step. In the third step, these CTCs were used to perform a transient heat conduction simulation within the carcass itself, including also glucose conversion, pH evolution and internal heat production. The <b>chiller</b> <b>room</b> conditions (velocity, temperature and relative humidity) were measured and used as inputs for the CFD model. The measured carcass temperature at various depths and sections was used for model validation. The temperature predictions agreed with the measured temperature profiles at different positions inside the carcass, with better prediction in deeper positions as compared to near surface positions. The simulations unveiled large differences in cooling rates and pH evolution between different parts of the carcass. The commercial slaughterhouse considered for the above simulations was the conventional chilling system where the carcasses are directly railed from slaughter floor to the <b>chiller</b> <b>room.</b> However, modern slaughterhouses operate by including a pre-chilling stage, for the purpose of extracting the initial heat load and quickly reducing surface temperature. Model based optimization was performed to identify optimum operating conditions for different chilling practices in slaughterhouses with both pre-chilling and chilling stages. The chilling practices were categorized based on the weight given to the output variables (energy consumption, weight loss, cooling time and heat shortening duration) during the chilling operation. The values of these output variables depend on the input variables air temperature, air velocity and pre-chilling time at pre-chilling stage. The study indicated that optimum operation conditions in slaughterhouse depend on the nature of the cost variable that the operator wants to minimize and are a trade-off between adverse effects on energy use and quality. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Clostridium difficile is a spore-forming {{pathogen}} {{considered as}} {{a major cause of}} enteric disease in humans, with faecal-oral route as the primary mode of transmission. However, recent studies have reported the occurrence of C. difficile in ground meats at retail stores, indicating that foods could be an additional source of infection in the community. Purpose: The objective {{of this study was to}} determine the resistance of C. difficile spores in contaminated ground meat during cooking process. Methods: Prior to testing, to obtain spores and to enhance heterogeneity, spores of two different strains were produced in two nutritious broths. C. difficile spores were experimentally inoculated in 45 g of ground meat (beef and pork) in order to obtain a final contamination of 4, 500 ufc g- 1. Six heating temperatures (70, 75, 80, 85, 90 and 95 °C) were chosen. Samples were heating in a water bath with an integrated program for time-temperature. One sample without inoculum was used as control with a temperature probe placed inside. Once the desired temperature was research in the core of the sample, the heat treatment was prolonged for 10 min. Subsequently, all the samples were placed on the <b>chilling</b> <b>room</b> (4 °C) before analyse. These experiments were conducted in duplicate with a spore enumeration in triplicate. Results: Heating contaminated ground meat at 70, 75 and 80 °C for 10 min was not effective for C. difficile spores inhibition. However, 10 min of heat shock at 80 °C was the only temperature that significantly reduced the number of countable colonies. Heat treatment at 85 °C (or more) inhibits the germination of both of the strains tested. Significance: Ensure that ground meat, like burgers or sausages, is heated to more than 85 °C would be an important measure to reduce the risk of C. difficile food transmission...|$|E

Consumer-led product {{development is}} developed from the wish to fill the consumer’s needs and expectations and thereby be more likely to succeed. Lindell’s Gårdsslakteri AB is a local slaughter and meat processor in Västergötland. They wish to ex-pand their meat product assortment with a new product that fits into their otherwise traditional and quality oriented supply. A market survey led into the idea of developing a fermented sausage. The manufacturing of fermented sausage is complex with many parameters to consider producing a tasteful, visually attractive and safe sausage. Typical for all fermented sausages are the combination of lactic acid, salting and drying. A "medvurst" is a type of fast fermented sausage that is produced and ready to be sold within a few days. The manufacturing process started with the mixing of pork and beef meat with seasonings, starter culture and curing salt. When a paste was formed frozen pork fat was mixed in. After filling into semipermeable casings the sausage was left for tempering. The fermentation started in the smoke chamber followed by smoking and heat treatment to 47 °C. The sausage was then left in the <b>chilling</b> <b>room</b> to mature for 2 days. After two test trials the desired sausage was created. Following was the labeling and part of a risk analysis concerning EHEC. After the end of the project Lindell´s continued with the risk analysis, durability tests and launching.

Assim, objetivou-se neste trabalho caracterizar o processo de rigor mortis dos músculos Semitendinosus e Triceps brachii durante o resfriamento industrial e maciez da carne, em 10 carcaças ovinas. Foram escolhidos aleatoriamente 10 ovinos machos inteiros, sendo seis da raça Santa Inês e quatro F 1 Santa Inês x Dorper, abatidos no Matadouro Frigorífico de Campos - Campos dos Goytacazes, Rio de Janeiro. Após a sangria, analisou-se temperatura, pH, comprimento de sarcômero em diferentes intervalos de tempo (4 h; 6 h; 8 h; 10 h; 12 h; e 24 h) e força de cisalhamento ou maciez às 48 h, do músculo Semitendinosus. Paralelamente, foi realizada a correlação entre a análise sensorial e a análise instrumental desse músculo. A temperatura da câmara fria variou de 12, 2 °C (4 h) a - 0, 5 °C (24 h) e a temperatura média das carcaças foi de 26, 80 °C e - 0, 20 °C, respectivamente. O pH médio inicial do músculo Semitendinosus foi de 6, 62 e o final 5, 64 enquanto no músculo T. brachii foi de 6, 50 (4 h) e 5, 68 (24 h). A contração máxima do sarcômero do músculo Semitendinosus ocorreu na 12 ªh(1, 50 mm) após a sangria e no músculo Triceps brachii, no intervalo entre a 10 ªh e 24 ªh (1, 53 a 1, 57 mm). No músculo Semitendinosus a força de cisalhamento ou maciez foi semelhante entre cordeiros da raça Santa Inês e F 1 Santa Inês x Dorper, demonstrando que o grupo genético não influencia na maciez da carne. O painel sensorial confirmou os resultados obtidos na análise instrumental. Na correlação da análise instrumental (força de cisalhamento) com a análise sensorial, quando comparadas diferentes grupos genéticos, observou-se uma boa correlação inversa (r = - 0, 87).

The characteristics of rigor mortis process in ovine carcass during industrial chilling {{to obtain the}} chilled carcasses have been studied in other countries and in Brazil in Santa Ines sheep, but not yet established in F 1 Dorper x Santa Inês. Thus, this research was designed to characterize the rigor mortis process of Semitendinosus and Triceps brachii muscles during the industrial chilling and meat tenderness in 10 ovine carcasses. Ten intact male ovines breed were randomly assembled, six of Santa Inês breed and four F 1 Dorper x Santa Inês, slaughtered at Campos Slaughterhouse - Campos dos Goytacazes, Rio de Janeiro. After exsanguination, were measured temperature, pH and sarcomere length at different times (4 h; 6 h; 8 h; 10 h; 12 h; and 24 h) and shear force or tenderness (48 h) of Semitendinosus muscle. In parallel was accomplished the sensorial analysis relationships to instrumental values of this muscle. The <b>chilling</b> <b>room</b> temperature varied between 12. 2 °C (4 h) and - 0. 5 °C (24 h) and the mean temperature of carcasses was 26. 80 °C and - 0. 20 °C, respectively.

Temperatures (particularly air on and air off, maximum and near defrost heaters) relative humidity, airflow, layout and cleaning regimes were surveyed. In general, no correlation could be found between any of the physical measurements and the numbers and types of bacteria detected. Maximum mean temperatures in the <b>chilled</b> <b>rooms</b> varied from - 1 to + 16. 9 °C and few chilled units were regularly cleaned. Twenty five percent of sites examined had more than 105 colony-forming units per cm 2, although, very few pathogens or faecal indicator bacteria were detected. Listeria spp. were not found and coliforms were found only once, in low numbers. Low numbers of S. aureus or B. cereus were present in 9 of the 15 plants, B. cereus was found on evaporators and associated drip trays in two catering plants and two plants processing cooked meat. Enterococci and S. aureus were found most frequently in a raw red meat slaughterhouse (always in low numbers). In general, microbial contamination was lower in rooms where wrapped rather than unwrapped products were stored. The type of product also affected the degree of contamination, with raw red meat and poultry or dry ingredients giving highest counts, and raw vegetables and cooked products lowest. The work demonstrated that bacteria were present on evaporator cooling coils in all factory cold rooms visited. Although evaporator-cleaning procedures were carried out in some factories as part of routine maintenance these were not shown to be effective at maintaining low levels of bacteria on evaporators. To maintain evaporator hygiene {{it is suggested that}} more regular cleaning procedures, possibly by means of automated cleansing systems, should be considered. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|Forty-one M. semimembranosus (S. M.) {{muscles of}} beef were {{collected}} from the local slaughterhouse in Norway (part I) {{for the study of}} meat quality and color stability. All the slaughter variables like pH, weight, temperature, fat content, animal group and so on were recorded. Piece B (cut from proximal side of S. M.) and Piece A (cut from distal side of S. M) were vacuum packaged in the slaughter house and were left for 3 weeks in <b>chilling</b> <b>room</b> for maturation. A big S. M muscle (~ 5 kg) was divided into various pieces for measurements that were carried out the in slaughterhouse, namely; pH, mitochondrial isolation, permeablization and oxygen consumption rate (OCR). Further measurements of the pieces were followed up three weeks later at our lab in IKBM, namely; tenderness, drip loss and cooking loss (using both piece A and B) and, color stability and OCR(using tissue from piece B). A small piece of S. M and Longismus dorsi (L. D.) muscle was used for pH measurements at time t 0 (~ 4 hrs postmortem), t 1 (~ 8 hrs postmortem) and t 2 (~ 4 hrs postmortem) with three replicate at different positions each time. Results from tenderness measurement showed that SM piece at proximal end (Piece B) was tendered than the distal end (Piece A). The rate of pH decline was different between the collected samples from number 1 - 20 and from 21 - 41. Most of the samples had good and acceptable amount of combined drip and cooking loss. Oxygen consumption rate (OCR) was measured on permeabilization fibers after 3 weeks vacuum and chilled storage of the muscle. Similarly our results showed that, OCR could had some prediction ability for classifying the tender and tough group of Piece B from sample 21 - 41 but not for the 1 - 20 sample group. Regression of OCRs and WB values showed that removal of oxygen from the electron transport chain has a positive effect on tenderness. For the spectral measurements of 3 weeks stored muscle, a calibration model (part II-taken from paper (I)) for myoglobin state was required. Fresh S. M muscles (vacuum packaged 4 days postmortem) were prepared to have deoxy (DMb), oxy (OMb) and metmyoglobin (MMb) state using Chemically induced myoglobin states (CHEM) method and oxygen partial pressure packaging (OPP) method. Absorbance spectra (400 - 1100 nm) were made on the 24 sample surface (8 samples for each myoglobin state) with 4 replicate readings at different positions of each sample for each preparation method (OPP and CHEM). Absorbance spectra were transformed by using different ways like using Kubelka-Munk (K/S) and extended multiplicative signal correction (EMSC). Calibration and validation model were made from transformed spectra by using either selected wavelengths (SW) or partial least square (PLS) regression. Post-transformation steps were used to normalize the myoglobin states so that, none of them were larger than one or negative and ensured that, sum of three states was not more than one at particular time. Low Root mean square error of cross validation (RMSECV) and high correlation coefficient (Rc) was used as criteria to choose the best calibration model for myoglobin states. Use of OPP preparation method with EMSC transformation and PLS regression on absorbance gave the best model for calibration. The color stability of 3 weeks stored S. M muscle (Part III) were measured at different times from 0 - 7 days using absorbance spectra (400 - 1100 nm) and L*, a* and b* values. The calibration models were used to predict the change in myoglobin states after exposure to atmosphere using the absorbance spectra for all samples. N-partial least square (N-PLS) regression between variations in L*a*b* values and myoglobin states to OCR was carried out. The DMb concentration predicted from the calibration model decreased with time and indicated that with an increase in time of exposure to atmosphere, DMb first transforms transiently to OMb and then to MMb, whose level rose concomitantly. The change in a* values with time and OCR were highly related. It was found that pH t 0 and pH t 1 are important for color stability of the meat. In three weeks stored muscle, complex II of mitochondria was the most stable complex in the electron transport system and often the only viable site for accepting reducing equivalents, therefore color stability could be related to its activity. In conclusion, the activity of mitochondrial enzymes could be well related to color stability and also to tenderness for a subset of muscles that were characterized by a slower drop in pH early post mortem.

Two papers were written and has been submitted but not yet published to the Journal of meat science based on this thesis. those papers are also attached after appendix. Forty-one M. semimembranosus (S. M.) muscles of beef were collected from the local slaughterhouse in Norway (part I) {{for the study of}} meat quality and color stability. All the slaughter variables like pH, weight, temperature, fat content, animal group and so on were recorded. Piece B (cut from proximal side of S. M.) and Piece A (cut from distal side of S. M) were vacuum packaged in the slaughter house and were left for 3 weeks in <b>chilling</b> <b>room</b> for maturation. A big S. M muscle (~ 5 kg) was divided into various pieces for measurements that were carried out the in slaughterhouse, namely; pH, mitochondrial isolation, permeablization and oxygen consumption rate (OCR). Further measurements of the pieces were followed up three weeks later at our lab in IKBM, namely; tenderness, drip loss and cooking loss (using both piece A and B) and, color stability and OCR(using tissue from piece B). A small piece of S. M and Longismus dorsi (L. D.) muscle was used for pH measurements at time t 0 (~ 4 hrs postmortem), t 1 (~ 8 hrs postmortem) and t 2 (~ 4 hrs postmortem) with three replicate at different positions each time. Results from tenderness measurement showed that SM piece at proximal end (Piece B) was tendered than the distal end (Piece A). The rate of pH decline was different between the collected samples from number 1 - 20 and from 21 - 41. Most of the samples had good and acceptable amount of combined drip and cooking loss. Oxygen consumption rate (OCR) was measured on permeabilization fibers after 3 weeks vacuum and chilled storage of the muscle. Similarly our results showed that, OCR could had some prediction ability for classifying the tender and tough group of Piece B from sample 21 - 41 but not for the 1 - 20 sample group. Regression of OCRs and WB values showed that removal of oxygen from the electron transport chain has a positive effect on tenderness. For the spectral measurements of 3 weeks stored muscle, a calibration model (part II-taken from paper (I)) for myoglobin state was required. Fresh S. M muscles (vacuum packaged 4 days postmortem) were prepared to have deoxy (DMb), oxy (OMb) and metmyoglobin (MMb) state using Chemically induced myoglobin states (CHEM) method and oxygen partial pressure packaging (OPP) method. Absorbance spectra (400 - 1100 nm) were made on the 24 sample surface (8 samples for each myoglobin state) with 4 replicate readings at different positions of each sample for each preparation method (OPP and CHEM). Absorbance spectra were transformed by using different ways like using Kubelka-Munk (K/S) and extended multiplicative signal correction (EMSC). Calibration and validation model were made from transformed spectra by using either selected wavelengths (SW) or partial least square (PLS) regression. Post-transformation steps were used to normalize the myoglobin states so that, none of them were larger than one or negative and ensured that, sum of three states was not more than one at particular time. Low Root mean square error of cross validation (RMSECV) and high correlation coefficient (Rc) was used as criteria to choose the best calibration model for myoglobin states. Use of OPP preparation method with EMSC transformation and PLS regression on absorbance gave the best model for calibration. The color stability of 3 weeks stored S. M muscle (Part III) were measured at different times from 0 - 7 days using absorbance spectra (400 - 1100 nm) and L*, a* and b* values. The calibration models were used to predict the change in myoglobin states after exposure to atmosphere using the absorbance spectra for all samples. N-partial least square (N-PLS) regression between variations in L*a*b* values and myoglobin states to OCR was carried out. The DMb concentration predicted from the calibration model decreased with time and indicated that with an increase in time of exposure to atmosphere, DMb first transforms transiently to OMb and then to MMb, whose level rose concomitantly. The change in a* values with time and OCR were highly related. It was found that pH t 0 and pH t 1 are important for color stability of the meat. In three weeks stored muscle, complex II of mitochondria was the most stable complex in the electron transport system and often the only viable site for accepting reducing equivalents, therefore color stability could be related to its activity. In conclusion, the activity of mitochondrial enzymes could be well related to color stability and also to tenderness for a subset of muscles that were characterized by a slower drop in pH early post mortem. No relation between mitochondrial enzyme activity and drip loss and cooking loss was found...|$|E
40|$|Sponge {{samples were}} taken from the carcases, meat, {{personnel}} and surfaces involved in stunnin & slaughter and dressing/boning activities at three abattoirs, and from retail beef products. The samples were examined for the presence of central nervous system (cNs) -specific proteins (syntaxin 1 B and/or glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), as indicators of contamination with CNS tissue. Syntaxin 1 B and GFAP were detected in many of the sponge samples taken along the slaughter line and in the <b>chill</b> <b>rooms</b> of all three abattoirs; GFAP was also detected in one sample of longissimus muscle (striploin) taken in the boning hall of one of the abattoirs but not in the other two abattoirs or in retail meats...|$|R
6000|$|Raying {{and gleaming}} in the {{sunlight}} the hired landau {{drove up to the}} gate. Lawford, peeping between the blinds, looked down on the coachman, with reins hanging loosely from his red squat-thumbed hand, seated in his tight livery and indescribable hat on the faded cushions. One thing only was in his mind; and it was almost with an audible cry that he turned towards the figure that edged, white and trembling, into the <b>chill</b> <b>room,</b> to fling herself into his arms. 'Don't look at me,' he begged her, 'only remember, dearest, I would rather have died down there and been never seen again than have given you pain. Run--run, your mother's calling.

40|$|Mushrooms {{from growing}} trials {{are now being}} {{comprehensively}} screened for quality, shelf life and ability to withstand handling {{as part of an}} expanded programme on the quality evaluation of fresh mushrooms at Kinsealy Research Centre. Efficient cooling after harvesting using forced air <b>chill</b> <b>rooms,</b> vacuum or ice bank coolers coupled with the maintenance of chill temperatures (2 - 4 C) and good packaging during storage, distribution and retailing are the keys to an extended shelf life and a high quality product. The status of irradiation as a method of prolonging the shelf life of fresh mushrooms must be kept under constant review; present indications are that it is unlikely to become a commercial proposition in the immediate future for reasons of cost and consumer resistance...|$|R
5|$|Plant {{technology}} {{began to}} be turned {{to the problem of}} directly <b>chilling</b> <b>rooms</b> and containers, to replace the need to carry ice at all. Pressure began to grow for a replacement for ice bunkers on the trans-Atlantic routes during the 1870s. Tellier produced a chilled storeroom for the steamship Le Frigorifique, using it to ship beef from Argentina to France, while the Glasgow-based firm of Bells helped to sponsor a new, compressed-air chiller for ships using the Gorrie approach, called the Bell-Coleman design. These technologies soon became used on the trade to Australia, New Zealand and Argentina. The same approach {{began to be}} taken in other industries. Carl von Linde found ways of applying mechanical refrigeration to the brewing industry, removing its reliance on natural ice; cold warehouses and meat packers began to rely on chilling plants.|$|R

50|$|The {{death of}} Anna Wood {{nevertheless}} raised awareness about ecstasy {{use in the}} general community, which until that time had been less well known in Australia. Her death was seen as unusual because in 1995 {{the number of people}} who had died from ecstasy use was very low. The raised awareness of ecstasy use led to the Australian state governments instituting new laws in the running of dance venues. In NSW, the Code of Practice for Dance Parties was passed in 1997, which made the provision of <b>chill</b> <b>rooms</b> and free water compulsory for clubs to obtain their licence. This was seen as an acknowledgement of the reality of ecstasy use in the dance scene and the need for pragmatic legislation by governments to prevent further deaths. The coroner's report into Wood's death had also recommended public advice on ecstasy use and water intake to avoid further water intoxication fatalities.|$|R
60|$|When she {{had seen}} {{the upper part of the}} house, Mrs. Button offered to convoy her through the kitchens and servants' apartments, but she {{declined}} this for the present. She had done enough for the day. So she dismissed Mrs. Button, and took herself to the library. How often had she heard that books afforded the surest consolation to the desolate. She would take to reading; not on this special day, but as the resource for many days and months, and years to come. But this idea had faded and become faint, before she had left the gloomy, damp-feeling, <b>chill</b> <b>room,</b> in which some former Lord Ongar had stored the musty Volumes which he had thought fit to purchase. The library gave her no ease, so she went out again among the lawns and shrubs. For some time to come her best resources must be those which she could find outside the house.|$|R

50|$|Interchill Records is a Canadian {{independent}} {{record label}} specializing in downtempo/electronica music. Founded in Montreal, Quebec in 1995 by Andrew Ross Collins, Interchill {{got its start}} in the multi-sensory <b>chill</b> <b>rooms</b> of the early rave scene in Montreal. Originally launched to showcase and export Canadian ambient music {{to the rest of}} the world, the record label grew from a string of EPs to the seminal compilation 'Northern Circuits' and on to encompass music from producers around the planet. Now, after 19 years in operation and 51 albums in its catalogue, the label has soundly established itself as a key player in the downtempo electronic scene and is known worldwide for releasing hi-fidelity music that lasts. With a focus on 'organic electronica for expanding minds', Interchill maintains diversity while drawing a continuous thread through a wide variety of sounds and styles, bringing together the cutting-edge in dub, world-fusion, psy-chill, ambient, lounge and all points between. Over the years, Interchill has released albums from artists around the world like Eat Static, Mauxuam, Kaya Project, Gaudi, Ashtech, Adham Shaikh, Ishq, Pushmipulyu, Grouch (NZ) and Liquid Stranger.|$|R
60|$|He reached Taunton in {{the middle}} of the night,--during the small hours of the morning in a winter night; but yet he could not bring himself to go to bed. So he knocked up an ostler at the nearest inn, and ordered out a gig. He would go down to the village of Redicote, on the Minehead road, and put up at the public-house there. He could not now have himself driven at once to Belton Castle, as he would have done had the old squire been alive. He fancied that his {{presence}} would be a nuisance if he did so. So he went to the little inn at Redicote, reaching that place between four and five o'clock in the morning; and very uncomfortable he was when he got there. But in his present frame of mind he preferred discomfort. He liked being tired and cold, and felt, when he was put into a <b>chill</b> <b>room,</b> without fire, and with a sanded floor, that things with him were as they ought to be.|$|R
50|$|Another {{traditional}} cup is the masu, a box {{usually made}} of hinoki or sugi, which was originally used for measuring rice. The masu holds exactly 180 ml, so the sake {{is served by}} filling the masu to the brim; this is done for <b>chilled</b> or <b>room</b> temperature sake. In some Japanese restaurants, as a show of generosity, the server may put a glass inside the masu or put the masu on a saucer and pour until sake overflows and fills both containers.|$|R
60|$|In {{the pause}} of perplexity that followed, an eerie and {{sinister}} feeling crept over Turnbull's stubborn soul {{in spite of}} himself.

50|$|The {{process through}} which the artists work varies {{according}} to the sculptor, but often follows the same general steps. Most start with choosing {{one of the six}} dairy cattle breeds (Holstein, Guernsey, Jersey, Brown Swiss, Ayrshire, and Milking Shorthorn) to recreate. Usually, they produce drawings of the cattle or take several photographs from which to work. As the sculpting actually begins, {{it is important for the}} butter to be of the right consistency, which has been described as feeling like cold cream. In total, about 500-600 pounds of butter is used. Over the years, sculptors moved from working in <b>chilled</b> <b>rooms</b> to large refrigerated display cases with temperatures between 35 and 40oF. The butter is placed on a wooden-and-wire armature, at first in large amounts to achieve the general shape of the cow, and later in smaller quantities to fine-tune the form. The butter is added layer upon layer until the cow is in its finished form, taking between two days and a week, depending on the artist. Though the sculptors claim it was never a secret that the Buttercow is built on a wooden armature, many people assumed the sculpture was solid, and made entirely from butter, despite the logistical impossibilities.|$|R

The first floor was the <b>chill</b> out <b>room</b> where ice cold drinks and food were served, the second floor was the main dance floor and stage area for the PAs to play, and the third floor was a balcony overlooking the second floor. On most Friday nights the first floor {{was used as a}} second dance arena which had its own line up of DJs. The club's official capacity was 1,600.|$|R
5000|$|Other rooms {{included}} the Garage room. This had car hub caps {{on the walls}} and the DJ's decks were located in the front end of a VW Beetle which had been chopped in half. It also had a <b>chill</b> out <b>room</b> and small cinema located on the first floor where ambient music was played. The club had an outdoor section with a tea room and seating. There was also the [...] "Top Floor" [...] just after the main entrance where there was another DJ playing and a bar area.|$|R
