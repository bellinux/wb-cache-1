As 'offer and acceptance' or 'ijab' and 'qabul' i. e. sighah in popular juristic view is an absolute and executed after the possession of the <b>contracted</b> <b>item,</b> pre signing in normal circumstance has been seen as promise from one party to purchase or to sell. Hence, the question arises from the practice is does the promise can be considered as 'offer' or 'acceptance', or not? Any compliant issue in contract execution will affect the validity of the contract. Therefore, the study aims to discover few objectives such as Shari'ah view on sequence of contract execution in Islamic banking products; and Islamic banks' practices in executing contract in vehicle financing, house financing and personal financing. The paper discloses Islamic views on contract execution and how Islamic banks practices contract execution with customers. The paper suggests that the offer and acceptance should be done in proper manner as described by lslamic jurists and technology devices and communication technology should be used to overcome pre-signing needs...|$|E
40|$|Customer pre-signing of all {{transactional}} {{documents in}} one sitting is a questionable procedure as {{it does not follow}} the required sequence in the Shariah concept of “offer and acceptance”. As “offer and acceptance” or “ijab and qabul” (i. e. sighah) is, according to the vast majority of scholars, an absolute requirement of exchange contracts and can be executed only after the seller possesses the <b>contracted</b> <b>item.</b> Pre-signing in normal circumstances has been seen as either a promise from one party to purchase or to sell, or as an execution of contract without proper ownership by contracting parties. Hence, the study is integral in order to analyse the permissibility of considering pre-signing as offer and acceptance. Furthermore, it is assumed that any non-compliance issues in the execution of a contract will affect its validity. Therefore, this study aims to explain the Shariah view on the sequence of contract execution in Islamic banking products, and the Islamic banks' practices in executing contracts in vehicle financing, house financing and personal financing. The paper applies the qualitative research method comprising of document analyses, fiqh muqaran and interviews with the stakeholders. This paper suggests that “offer and acceptance” should be done in a proper manner as described by Islamic jurists and that modern technology, especially communication technology, should be used to overcome pre-signing needs. In a nutshell, this study contributes in sharpening the practices of Islamic banks to comply with contractual sequence as required by Islamic law...|$|E

30|$|Contract theory studies how {{economic}} decision-maker construct contractual arrangements, {{generally in}} the presence of hidden information [15]. In our model, the sources’ types constitute hidden information that is known only to the sources themselves. The relay does not know the type of each source, θ, and, thus, it needs to design <b>contract</b> <b>items</b> to attract the source to take part in cooperative communications. We assume that the relay has a prior distribution P(θ) over Θ. According to the revelation principle [15], for any feasible contract of incomplete information, there exists a payoff-equivalent revelation mechanism that enables the sources to truthfully report their types. Because of this, it is enough to design a optimal contract that consists of <b>contract</b> <b>items</b> (q (θ),π (θ)) for each source.|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{we study}} a broker-based TV white space market, where {{unlicensed}} white space devices (WSDs) purchase white space spectrum from TV licensees via a third-party geo-location database (DB), {{which serves as}} a spectrum broker, reserving spectrum from TV licensees and then reselling the reserved spectrum to WSDs. We propose a contract-theoretic framework for the database's spectrum reservation under demand stochasticity and information asymmetry. In such a framework, the database offers a set of <b>contract</b> <b>items</b> in the form of reservation amount and the corresponding payment, and each WSD chooses the best <b>contract</b> <b>item</b> based on its private information. We systematically study the optimal reservation contract design (that maximizes the database's expected profit) under two different risk-bearing schemes: DB-bearing-risk and WSD-bearing-risk, depending on who (the database or the WSDs) will bear the risk of over reservation. Counter-intuitively, we show that the optimal contract under DB-bearing-risk leads to a higher profit for the database and a higher total network profit...|$|R
30|$|In this paper, we {{have studied}} a pricing {{mechanism}} for multiuser cooperative communication in a cognitive-radio-based wireless network using a simple principal-agent framework, {{in which the}} relay acts as a principal who designs <b>contract</b> <b>items</b> and sources act as the agent who purchases the relaying service of sources. In this model, the <b>contract</b> <b>items</b> designed by the principal consist {{of a set of}} rate-price pairs. We have studied the optimal contract design under complete information and incomplete information. We have also analyzed the feasibility and optimality of the feasible contract under incomplete information and we have derived the best variable assignment and the best price assignment. Further, we have characterize cooperative gain, relay’s revenue, and expected data rate in the optimal contract under complete information and incomplete information. The proposed mechanism is simple and requires limited interaction between source and relay. Numerical simulation results have shown that this pricing mechanism can lead to a win-win situation, where the source nodes get good communication service and the relay nodes maximize their own profit. From a social surplus perspective, our results have shown that the social surplus under incomplete information is close to the maximum social surplus under complete information.|$|R

40|$|Legal {{translation}} of contract agreements {{is a challenge}} to translators as it involves combining the literary translation with the technical terminological precision. In translating legal contract agreements, a legal translator must utilize the lexical or syntactic precision and, more importantly, the pragmatic awareness of the context. This will guarantee an overall communicative process and avoid inconsistency in legal translation. However, the inability of the translator to meet these two functions in translating the <b>contract</b> <b>item</b> not only affects the contractors’ comprehension of the <b>contract</b> <b>item</b> but also affects the parties’ contractual obligations. In light of this, {{the purpose of this study}} was to find out how legal collocations used in contract agreements are translated from Arabic into English by student-translators in terms of (1) purely technical, (2) semi-technical, and (3) everyday vocabulary collocations. For the data collection, a multiple-choice collocation test was used to be answered by 35 EFL Iraqi undergraduate translator-students to decide on the aspects of weaknesses and strengths of their translation, thus decide on the aspects of correction. The findings showed that these students had serious problems in translating legal collocations as they lack the linguistic knowledge and pragmatic awareness needed to achieve the legal meaning and effect. They were also unable to make a difference among the three categories of legal collocations, purely technical, semi-technical, and everyday vocabulary collocations. These students should be exposed to more legal translation practices to obtain the required experience needed for their future career...|$|R

30|$|Multiuser {{cooperative}} communication significantly {{improves the}} performance of wireless communication networks. One key challenge of multiuser cooperative communication is how to design a cooperative mechanism to incentivize potential relay nodes to help a source node in its data transmission. In this paper, to address this problem, a contract-based principal-agent framework is proposed {{in the context of}} a cognitive-radio-based wireless relaying networks in which the sources’ wireless characteristics constitute hidden information which is not known by the relay. The problem is modeled as a monopolist’s problem, in which a mobile relay node acts as the principal who designs incentive-compatible (IC) and individually rational (IR) <b>contract</b> <b>items,</b> consisting of a set of rate-price pairs. Subsequently, <b>contract</b> <b>items</b> can be broadcast by the relay to nearby mobile users that want to send data. Once these sources optimally select an item and notify the relay that they are willing to accept it, the relay then chooses one source based on the highest revenue for which to provide service. The cooperative gain, relay’s revenue, and expected data rate are characterized for the optimal contract under complete information and incomplete information. Theoretical analysis and numerical results show that this pricing mechanism can lead to a win-win situation in which source nodes get good communication service and relay nodes maximize their own profit that can, in turn, be used to purchase the relay service of other nodes when needed in the future. Moreover, the proposed mechanism is shown to also exhibit other important features such as low complexity and low signaling overhead.|$|R

This ‘information’ or ‘knowledge’ is private for the source or in other words ‘hidden information’. Nevertheless, we assume the relay has a prior distribution over Θ given by P (θ) with a continuous density p (θ)> 0. Although the source informs the relay of this private information, the relay has to also consider the cost of receiving and forwarding data, which includes: cost of energy used to receive and forward data, cost of time when receiving and forwarding data, current battery level, as well as other factors.|$|R

40|$|Providing proper {{economic}} incentives {{is essential for}} the success of dynamic spectrum sharing. Cooperative spectrum sharing is one effective way to achieve this goal. In cooperative spectrum sharing, secondary users (SUs) relay traffics for primary users (PUs), in exchange for dedicated transmission time for the SUs' own communication needs. In this paper, we study the cooperative spectrum sharing under incomplete information, where SUs' types (capturing their heterogeneity in relay channel gains and evaluations of power consumptions) are private information and not known by PUs. Inspired by the contract theory, we model the network as a labor market. The single PU is the employer who offers a contract to the SUs. The contract consists of a set of <b>contract</b> <b>items</b> representing combinations of spectrum accessing time (i. e., reward) and relaying power (i. e., contribution). The SUs are employees, and each of them selects the best <b>contract</b> <b>item</b> to maximize his payoff. We study the optimal contract design for both weak and strong incomplete information scenarios. First, we provide necessary and sufficient conditions for feasible contracts in both scenarios. In the weak incomplete information scenario, we further derive the optimal contract that achieves the same maximum PU's utility as in the complete information benchmark. In the strong incomplete information scenario, we propose a Decompose-and-Compare algorithm that achieves a close-to-optimal contract. We future show that the PU's average utility loss due to the suboptimal algorithm and the strong incomplete information are both relatively small (less than 2 % and 1 : 3 %, respectively, in our numerical results with two SU types).
