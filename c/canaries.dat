5|$|A {{recent study}} of raven {{mitochondrial}} DNA showed that the isolated population from the Canary Islands is distinct from other populations. The study did not include any individuals from the North African population, and its position is therefore unclear, though its morphology {{is very close to}} the population of the <b>Canaries</b> (to the extent that the two are often considered part of a single subspecies).|$|E
5|$|Because of its low population, South Dakota {{does not}} host any major league {{professional}} sports franchises. The state has minor league and independent league teams, {{all of which}} play in Sioux Falls or Rapid City. Sioux Falls is home to four teams: the Sioux Falls <b>Canaries</b> (baseball), the Sioux Falls Skyforce (basketball), the Sioux Falls Stampede (hockey), and the Sioux Falls Storm (indoor American football). The <b>Canaries</b> play in the American Association, and their home field is Sioux Falls Stadium. The Skyforce play in the NBA G League, and are owned by the NBA's Miami Heat. They play at the Sanford Pentagon. The Stampede and Storm share the Denny Sanford Premier Center. The Stampede play in the USHL, and the Storm play in the CIF. Rapid City has a hockey team named the Rapid City Rush that plays in the ECHL. The Rush began their inaugural season in 2008 at the Rushmore Plaza Civic Center.|$|E
5|$|Filming was {{scheduled}} to start in December 1983, but was postponed for six months to accommodate Modine's shooting schedule for Mrs. Soffel (1984). Principal photography began in Philadelphia on May 15, 1984, with a budget of $12 million. The script required that a total of 24 locations be used for filming in Philadelphia and Santa Clara, California. Animal trainer Gary Gero employed the use of 80 different <b>canaries</b> for various scenes in the film, as well as pigeons, a hornbill, a cat, eighteen dogs and a seagull.|$|E

5|$|Birdy {{builds a}} new aviary {{in his bedroom}} and {{purchases}} two <b>canaries.</b> He names the female Perta and the male Alfonso after his friend. Upon returning to school, Birdy encounters a classmate, Doris Robinson, and Al encourages him to ask her out on a date. At the prom, Birdy dances unenthusiastically with Doris, leaving her confused and humiliated. Afterwards, Doris drives him to a secluded spot, where Birdy lightly rejects her sexual advances. Birdy returns home to his bedroom and lies down naked in the aviary. In a semi-conscious state, he expresses {{that he wants to}} die and be born again as a bird. He then imagines himself flying like a bird around his room, throughout the house and outside in the neighborhood.|$|E
5|$|Cagebirds such as <b>canaries,</b> budgerigars, cockatoos, lovebirds, quails, finches, and parrots {{are popular}} pets, whether for their song, their behaviour, their {{colourful}} plumage, or {{their ability to}} mimic speech. Among reasons for their popularity {{is that they can}} be kept in homes too small or otherwise unsuitable for dogs or cats. The cagebird trade {{in some parts of the}} world threatens certain species with extinction, when birds are illegally captured in the wild. For example, in Indonesia, at least 13 species are close to extinction including the Indonesian national bird, the Javan hawk-eagle, while five subspecies including the scarlet-breasted lorikeet may have become extinct in the wild.|$|E
5|$|In 1933, Stroud {{advertised in}} a {{publication}} {{that he had}} not received any royalties from the sales of Diseases of <b>Canaries.</b> In retaliation, the publisher complained to the warden, and, as a result, proceedings were initiated to transfer Stroud to Alcatraz, where he would not be permitted to keep his birds. In the end, however, Stroud was able to keep both his birds and canary-selling business at Leavenworth. Stroud avoided trouble for several more years, until it came to light that some of the equipment Stroud had requested for his lab was in fact being used as a home-made still to distill alcohol. Officials finally had the wedge they needed to drive Stroud out.|$|E

Both parties accept because White <b>Canary</b> dangles the life of Sin, Black <b>Canary's</b> adopted daughter, as her bait. However, The Huntress challenges Shiva instead and even manages to knock her down, to everyone's surprise, even after receiving many blows. The death match is stopped when Black <b>Canary</b> rescues Sin herself and points out a technicality, they need not continue the battle to death immediately and can pick it up {{at any time in the}} future.|$|R

5|$|Delta drifted {{slowly and}} erratically southwards {{for several days}} before {{accelerating}} north-eastwards then eastwards towards the Canary Islands and north Africa. During this period, it twice approached hurricane strength, although it never achieved hurricane intensity. On November 28 it merged with a frontal system northwest of the <b>Canaries</b> and became a vigorous extratropical storm. It caused severe damage in the Canary Islands and claimed at least seven lives, including six who drowned while attempting to reach the Canary Islands by boat from Africa. El Dedo de Dios, or God's Finger, a geological feature which had been pointing towards the sky for over a millennium and an important landmark for the Canary Islands, was toppled during the storm. Delta also caused power outages, leaving some 200,000people without power and forcing airports to close down.|$|E

As Tom chases Jerry, the <b>canary</b> helps Jerry by pulling a drying line, which tangles Tom. Tom then chases the <b>canary</b> with an axe, but misses and chops down a tree, which bounces off Tom's head to compress him. The <b>canary</b> motions for Jerry {{to join him in}} the birdhouse; Tom follows, but the <b>canary</b> gives him a 2,000 lb weight to send him plummeting. Jerry and the <b>canary</b> shake hands, but Tom uses a ladder to climb up again. The <b>canary</b> sets the ladder on fire to send Tom falling again. Tom uses a swing, but Jerry and the <b>canary</b> jump onto his hands. Tom then tries to pole vault to the birdhouse, but the <b>canary</b> uses a rollerskate to send Tom crashing into a nearby house, where he is hung up by a girdle.

5|$|Lambert was {{replaced}} by Birmingham City's manager Chris Hughton. With Norwich one place above the relegation zone and five matches remaining in the 2013–14 season, Hughton was sacked, and replaced by youth coach and former Norwich player Neil Adams. However, they could not avoid the drop to the Championship. Under Adams, Norwich began the 2014–15 season in the Championship with good form and were second in the table in September, but performances became mixed, the club slid to seventh place and a 2–0 defeat in the 2014–15 FA Cup by Preston North End F.C. (then in League One) led to Adams' resignation. He {{was replaced}} by Hamilton Academical coach Alex Neil. A revitalised and disciplined <b>Canaries</b> side achieved 17 victories in the remaining 25 games, qualifying {{for the end of}} season Football League playoffs. Neil's side secured victory over local rivals Ipswich Town, before defeating Middlesbrough in the final at Wembley Stadium, to return to the Premier League.|$|E
5|$|Low's tactics {{consisted}} {{primarily of}} hoisting false colours and approaching an unsuspecting vessel. Off {{the coast of}} St John's, Newfoundland, Low mistook a fully armed man-of-war for a fishing boat, and barely escaped. He moved on to Conception Bay, capturing a number of boats around the Grand Banks southeast of Newfoundland before crossing the Atlantic to the Azores. There, he captured a French (or Portuguese—sources differ) pink, a narrow-sterned former man of war, which Low rearmed and refitted as his new flagship, naming it the Rose Pink. He also captured an English vessel with two Portuguese passengers aboard. Low had his crew hoist them up and drop them back down from the yard arm several times, until they died. He {{moved on to the}} <b>Canaries,</b> Cape Verde and then back across to the coast of Brazil, where he was driven back by foul weather.|$|E
5|$|One of the {{cinematic}} techniques by which von Stroheim portrayed naturalism was animal symbolism. In Greed McTeague {{is associated with}} a canary, only briefly mentioned in the novel. Von Stroheim altered Norris's original ending and has McTeague release the canary in Death Valley. McTeague buys Trina a female canary as a wedding gift and early in their marriage von Stroheim cuts from a shot of them kissing to birds fluttering wildly in their cage. Another scene with animal imagery includes cross-cutting between a cat attempting to pounce on the <b>canaries</b> in the scene where Schouler bids goodbye to McTeague and Trina without telling them that he has informed on McTeague. Dogs, cats and monkeys are associated with various supporting characters. Von Stroheim also used the naturalist technique of giving characters specific objects, gestures or phrases that repeat throughout the film as a visual leitmotif. For example, Trina tugs on her lips and McTeague fiddles with his birdcage.|$|E
5000|$|After {{the end of}} {{the ongoing}} series, DC Comics {{published}} a four-part bi-monthly Black <b>Canary</b> miniseries in which Green Arrow teamed up with Black <b>Canary</b> to help get Sin into school and establish a new life. This series concluded with the Black <b>Canary</b> accepting his proposal. This resulted in DC Comics publishing three interconnected specials revolving around the Green Arrow/Black <b>Canary</b> wedding that tied into that month's [...] "Countdown" [...] stories. These were The Black <b>Canary</b> Wedding Planner, JLA Wedding Special, as well as The Green Arrow/Black <b>Canary</b> Wedding Special.

5|$|Composer Engelbert Humperdinck, after {{attending}} {{the debut of}} his opera Königskinder at the Metropolitan Opera, sailed on George Washington in early January 1911 in order to attend the opera's Berlin premiere. American sculptor George Grey Barnard returned to New York in April amidst controversy over some of his works. An organization called the National Society for Protection of Morals was protesting the presence of nude figures in sculptures he executed for the Pennsylvania State Capitol in Harrisburg. July saw George Washington transporting a menagerie of sorts. The liner was carrying a shipment from India of 6 white peacocks, 2 lions, 2 elephants, 150 monkeys, and some 2,000 <b>canaries</b> destined for the recently organized Saint Louis Zoological Park. In August, two men of note—both headed for Berlin—sailed on George Washington. Nathan Straus, co-owner with his brother Isidor of R.H. Macy & Company, sailed as the U.S. delegate {{to the third world}} congress for the protection of infants held in Berlin. Congressman Richard Bartholdt, charged by President Taft to deliver a statue of Friedrich Wilhelm von Steuben to the German government, sailed with the statue, which was a gift from the American people.|$|E
5|$|In the 15th century, West European mariners—beginning with Portugal—started making still longer voyages of exploration, using {{improvements}} on translated Islamic star {{charts and}} {{a variation on}} African fishing boats called the caravel. In 1473, Lopes Gonçalves crossed the equator and disproved the Aristotelian notion that a ring of fire would bar exploration of the southern hemisphere. Bartolomeu Dias rounded the Cape of Good Hope in 1487; in 1498, Vasco da Gama reached Malindi, where a local pilot showed him how to follow the monsoon to India. In 1492, relying on incorrect estimates of the circumference of the Earth, the Genovese Christopher Columbus sailed from Cadiz to the <b>Canaries</b> and thence into the open Atlantic in a Spanish attempt to reach the Orient. Instead, he made landfall on {{an island in the}} Caribbean Sea. The resulting Columbian Exchange introduced potatoes, corn, and chili peppers to the Old World while smallpox epidemics devastated the indigenous peoples of the Americas. This disruption and depopulation permitted rapid Spanish conquests and led to the widespread adoption of African slavery to man lucrative tobacco, sugar, indigo, and cotton plantations. In 1519, Juan Sebastián Elcano completed Magellan's Spanish expedition to sail around the world. These and other voyages permitted European maps to attain a previously impossible degree of accuracy. In 1538, Gerardus Mercator devised a map projection conveniently making constant bearings (rhumb lines) straight. In the Arctic, in 1594, the Dutch captain Willem Barentsz reached Svalbard and the Barents Sea while, in the south, Anthony de la Roché crossed the Antarctic Convergence in 1675 and three separate expeditions—one British, one American, and one Russian—all claimed to have discovered Antarctica in 1820. Not all voyages of discovery originated in Western Europe. Although accurate charting of the coasts of Russia only began in the 18th century and the archipelago of Severnaya Zemlya was not discovered until 1910, Novgorodians had been sailing the White Sea since at least the 13th century. Despite a long-standing preference for autarky, China briefly opened up under the Song and Mongol Yuan dynasties. In the early 15th century, Zheng He's fleet of treasure ships repeatedly sailed from Ming China with 37,000 men aboard 317 ships, reaching as far as the African coast. Chinese exploration, however, was soon curtailed again and finally outlawed. The peoples of East Asia were introduced to the true shape of the other continents from the maps of Matteo Ricci.|$|E
