25|$|As {{with the}} {{allocation}} of powers to the United States Congress under the United States Constitution, the Constitution of Australia grants a number of specified powers to the Parliament of Australia, while leaving unassigned powers to the state parliaments. Most of the powers granted to the federal parliament can also be exercised by the state parliaments, though because of section 109 of the Australian Constitution federal laws will prevail in case of inconsistency. This arrangement resulted in a <b>constitutional</b> <b>dispute</b> {{as to whether the}} federal government could be subject to state laws, and vice versa.|$|E

2500|$|The {{intention}} {{behind the}} amendments {{has long been}} called into question. The Akritas plan, written in {{the height of the}} <b>constitutional</b> <b>dispute</b> by the Greek Cypriot interior minister Policarpos Yorgadjis, called for the removal of undesirable elements of the constitution so as to allow power-sharing to work. The plan envisaged a swift retaliatory attack on Turkish Cypriot strongholds should Turkish Cypriots resort to violence to resist the measures, stating “In the event of a planned or staged Turkish attack, it is imperative to overcome it by force in the shortest possible time, because if we succeed in gaining command of the situation (in one or two days), no outside, intervention would be either justified or possible.” Whether Makarios's proposals were part of the Akritas plan is unclear, however it remains that sentiment towards enosis had not completely disappeared with independence. Makarios described independence as [...] "a step on the road to enosis". Preparations for conflict were not entirely absent from Turkish Cypriots either, with right wing elements still believing taksim (partition) the best safeguard against enosis.|$|E

5000|$|Certain {{forms of}} {{political}} and <b>constitutional</b> <b>dispute</b> are common to federations. One issue is that the exact division of power and responsibility between federal and regional governments is often a source of controversy.

The relationship between federal and local courts varies from nation to nation and can be a controversial and complex issue in itself.|$|E

However, China was slow to develop a sound constitutional review mechanism, which meant that constitutional law did not form part of the common conception of rule of law.

500|$|Drache {{was laid}} {{down at the}} Königliche Werft (Royal Dockyard) in Danzig on 27 July 1861; she was not {{launched}} until 3 August 1865, owing to <b>constitutional</b> <b>disputes</b> over the budget, which delayed construction of the gunboat. The Prussian Landtag (State Diet) tried to block the military expansion program advocated by Albrecht von Roon, the Prussian Ministry of War, leading to a constitutional crisis where the army and navy operated without legal budgets. The Navy was thus unable to spare funding to complete Drache and her sister [...] Draches completion was similarly delayed by budgetary problems, and she was finally delivered to the navy at its base at Dänholm off Stralsund in late April 1869.|$|R

50|$|In 1837, the Zürich Chamber of Commerce {{commissioned}} the engineer Alois Negrelli {{to investigate the}} route of such a line. In October {{of the same year}} the Zurich-Basel railway company was founded. The chosen route would lead from Zürich to Würenlos via Dietikon along the south bank of the Limmat, then crossing the river to follow the north bank of the Limmat via Wettingen, Ennetbaden and Obersiggenthal. In Untersiggenthal the line would turn to the north and have crossed the Aare at Döttingen. It would have then followed the south bank of the Rhine to Basel. In April 1838 surveying of the route began, but angry residents obstructed their work. The Züriputsch of 1839 and a civil war-like <b>constitutional</b> <b>dispute</b> in the canton of Aargau further delayed the start of construction.|$|E
