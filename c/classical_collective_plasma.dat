40|$|In {{the risk}} theory context, let us {{consider}} the <b>classical</b> <b>collective</b> model. The aim {{of this paper is}} to obtain a flexible bivariate joint distribution for modelling the couple (S,N), where N is a count variable and S=X 1 + [...] . +XN is the total claim amount. A generalization of the classical hierarchical model, where now we assume that the conditional distributions of SN and NS belong to some prescribed parametric families, is presented. A basic theorem of compatibility in conditional distributions of the type S given N and N given S is stated. Using a known theorem for exponential families and results from functional equations new models are obtained. We describe in detail the extension of two <b>classical</b> <b>collective</b> models, which now we call Poisson-Gamma and the Poisson-Binomial conditionals models.

40|$|This review {{presents}} {{results of}} the recent calculations of <b>collective</b> <b>plasma</b> processes of radiation transport in the solar interior. The review introduces a remarkable number of previously neglected effects which are shown to reduce substantially the Rosseland opacity at {{the centre of the}} Sun (the decrease of opacity is approximately 10 %, which is greater than the previously accepted possible errors in opacity). It is also shown that effects which were previously treated without taking into account the <b>collective</b> behaviour of <b>plasma,</b> change appreciably when the collective nature of the plasma is included. The analysis is based on modern concepts of plasma physics in which an essential role is played by photon scattering on ions and by the oscillations of ion electron shells in emission and bremsstrahlung absorption processes. The processes which contribute most to a decrease in opacity are: the broadening of the Raman resonance (due to both the Doppler effect and binary electron-ion collisions), frequency diffusion in radiation transfer processes, the processes of stimulated scattering and collective quantum corrections to the scattering.
