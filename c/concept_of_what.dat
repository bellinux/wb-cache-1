Calafia, in turn, convinces her people to take their ships, weapons, armor, riding beasts, and 500 griffins, and sail with her to Constantinople to fight the Christians, though she has no <b>concept</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> {{it means to be}} Moslem or Christian. Her {{subjects}} arm themselves with weapons and armor made of gold, as there is no other metal in California. They fill their ships with supplies and hasten to sea.|$|E
5|$|Jonathan Del Arco had no <b>concept</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> a Borg was {{prior to}} the audition. He {{received}} his script on the evening prior to meeting with the producers and felt that {{it gave him a}} decent sense of the character. Instead, Del Arco later explained that he was deliberately anti-social towards the other actors at the audition in order to get into Hugh's mindset. When he performed for the producers, someone else read the lines assigned to Picard and La Forge, and he felt like he immediately got a positive result. He received a call back, and returned to audition once more.|$|E
5|$|Because {{little was}} known about the region, the {{elements}} of its climate, citrus, water, and general ideas about illness and health, Stowe was possibly first among several authors and advertising schemes that portrayed Florida as an exotic place of natural wonders and powers that could rejuvenate frail health. What travel writers published on Florida were exaggerated claims, readily accepted by audiences hungry for escapist literature. Biographer Forrest Wilson considers the finished product, Palmetto Leaves—published in 1873—to be the first promotional writing about Florida ever. Occasionally letters about the state were printed in local newspapers in the North, but because Florida was {{still very much a}} rugged wilderness, Northerners really had no <b>concept</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> the region was like. Rather besotted with the marvelous properties she saw in the orange, Stowe intended to call the book Orange Blossoms, but changed the title to better express the plant that proliferated the region the most.|$|E

5|$|Carson and Zobel in 1923 had {{conclusively}} {{shown that}} filtering cannot remove noise {{to the same}} degree as, say, interference from another station could be removed. To do this they had analyzed random noise in the frequency domain and postulated that it contains all frequencies in its spectrum. This was the first use of Fourier analysis to describe random noise and hence described it in terms of a spread of frequencies. Also first published in this paper was the <b>concept</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> we would now call band-limited white noise. For Zobel this meant that characteristics of the receiving filter completely determine the figure of merit in the presence of white noise and that the filter design was key to achieving the optimum noise performance.|$|E
5|$|The {{title of}} the film was chosen to counter American author Katherine Mayo's 1927 polemical book Mother India, which vilified Indian culture. Allusions to Hindu mythology are {{abundant}} in the film, and its lead character {{has been seen as}} a metonymic representation of a Hindu woman who reflects high moral values and the <b>concept</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> {{it means to be a}} mother to society through self-sacrifice. Mother India metaphorically represents India as a nation in the aftermath of independence, and alludes to a strong sense of nationalism and nation-building. While some authors treat Radha as the symbol of women empowerment, others see her cast in female stereotypes. The film was shot in Mumbai's Mehboob Studios and in the villages of Maharashtra, Gujarat, and Uttar Pradesh states. The music by Naushad introduced Western classical music and Hollywood-style orchestra to Hindi cinema.|$|E

25|$|The Great Depression created {{economic}} obstacles for the park, and Owen {{lost her}} congressional seat. Coe, however, worked tirelessly for the park's establishment in Washington D.C. He sent coconuts to congressmen, President Herbert Hoover, and the Secretary of the Interior. While the <b>concept</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> landscapes were worth protecting were developing {{in the minds}} of scientists and politicians, Coe used any tactic he could think of to advance the idea of Everglades National Park, even equating its powers with the mythical Fountain of Youth. He took Congressional appointees from the Department of the Interior on tours through the Everglades, and though attempts to establish the park failed twice, it finally passed in May 1934. It carried a provision that the federal government would not be responsible for buying lands for the park, but its establishment ensured that no more land would be purchased from the protected area. Removing the prospect of developing lands in South Florida angered many state politicians. Newly elected governor Fred P. Cone fired Coe and left the Everglades Tropic National Park Commission without any guidance.|$|E

40|$|This paper aims at {{offering}} alternative methodological {{perspectives in}} health systems research, to produce critical, theoretical knowledge in domains {{such as health}} policy and management of health care, organization of disease control, political economy of health and medical practice. We first examined the reasons to believe that worldwide economic agents have driven publicly funded schools of public health to adopt their preferred policies and to orient their priority research topics. We then studied whether this hidden leadership has also contributed to shape research methodologies, which we contrasted with the epistemological consequences of a quest for intellectual independence, that is, the researcher’s quest to critically understand the state of health systems and generalize results of related action-research. To do so, we applied <b>concepts</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> could be named the ‘French School of Critical Sociology’ to qualitative research methodologies in descriptive health systems research.

500|$|The {{accompanying}} {{music video}} for [...] "Work" [...] {{was directed by}} Jonas & François and filmed in Hollywood and Lancaster, California in February 2013. A budget of about $100,000 {{was used for the}} production. Initially, Azalea wanted to provide a literal representation of the song, and planned to shoot the clip in Australia, but time constraints prevented her from travelling to the country. Accordingly, a desert location was chosen to emulate Azalea's hometown, Mullumbimby. Prior to the video's filming, Azalea felt she grasped the <b>concept</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> made a good music video and what viewers wanted to see in the clip for [...] "Work". In turn, she combined several different ideas into the visual because she feared that a music video budget of the same calibre would not arise in future.|$|E
500|$|In 1942, Teller {{was invited}} {{to be part of}} Robert Oppenheimer's summer {{planning}} seminar, at the University of California, Berkeley for the origins of the Manhattan Project, the Allied effort to develop the first nuclear weapons. A few weeks earlier, Teller had been meeting with his friend and colleague Enrico Fermi about the prospects of atomic warfare, and Fermi had nonchalantly suggested that perhaps a weapon based on nuclear fission could be used to set off an even larger nuclear fusion reaction. Even though he initially explained to Fermi why he thought the idea would not work, Teller was fascinated by the possibility and was quickly bored with the idea of [...] "just" [...] an atomic bomb even though this was not yet anywhere near completion. At the Berkeley session, Teller diverted discussion from the fission weapon to the possibility of a fusion weapon—what he called the [...] "Super", an early <b>concept</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> was later to be known as a hydrogen bomb.|$|E
500|$|The room, {{with the}} {{adjoining}} Billiards Room, {{is the only}} reception room at Waddesdon Manor to follow the French Renaissance style of the exterior; the other rooms are in broadly 18th-century styles, and contain a magnificent collection of paintings and furniture centred on that century. [...] The segregation of the collection {{was part of the}} <b>concept</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> has been called the [...] "neo-Kunstkammer", adopted by some other very wealthy collectors of the period. [...] The Renaissance Room at what is now the Wallace Collection and the collection of Sir Julius Wernher were other examples formed in England over the same period. [...] The neo-Kunstkammer aimed to emulate the collections formed during the Renaissance itself, mostly by princely houses; of these the outstanding survivals were the Habsburg collections in Vienna, Prague and Ambras, as well as the treasuries of the Grünes Gewölbe in Dresden, the Munich Residenz and Kassel.

500|$|The New Zealand {{visual effects}} studio Weta Digital was {{initially}} selected {{to assist in}} creating a preview clip for the 2007 Comic-Con Convention. The studio's 100 employees later developed the visual effects for 300 of the 600 shots in the film. In total, {{there are more than}} 100 jumps in the film, and each jump was modified based on the distance and location the character(s) jumped. The jumps were developed using Nuke and Shake software; many, including those to Big Ben and the Sphinx were created with Maya. Weta's VFX supervisor Erik Winquist explained how the visual effects of the jumps were created: [...] "The <b>concept</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> a jump looks like changed and evolved a little over the course of post production. There are shots in the film that use still array footage but not {{in the same way that}} we saw in The Matrix. The Matrix was largely about stopping time whereas this was about using slow shutter speeds on those still array cameras to end up with a streaky motion-blurred image as the perspective was changing, which is a pretty interesting look." [...] Other visual effects studios that assisted with the film include Hydraulx, Digital Domain, and Pixel Magic. Lightwave 3D was also used for some of the movie's scenes.|$|E
500|$|Suggesting {{that many}} of the {{philosophical}} and political underpinnings of the author's short stories stemmed from his views on domestic life, Palmer's focus turned to Dick's common use of sterility as a metaphor. In [...] "The Gun", [...] "Second Variety", The Penultimate Truth, and [...] "The Last of the Masters", people and sometimes the earth itself have been driven to sterility. As Palmer noted of [...] "The Last of the Masters", Bors can be interpreted as a symbol of infertility: [...] "It is not clear why he does not replicate himself, or educate his human servants: it is simply a given that he is sterile. The old, technologically advanced, highly organized civilization is a civilization of production, but now under Bors it can do no more than maintain itself." [...] Following an inspection of other short stories with similar references to sterility, Palmer asserts that Dick's work presented a social and existential protest. Palmer interpreted Dick's social critique to be that if the act of creation validates existence, and genuinely expresses a form of individuality, then the process of reproduction is alienating, oppressive, and retards an individual's liberty. As Palmer explains, [...] "...this process disempowers consumers, and even technocrats, by making them dependent on a process of which they have become entirely ignorant." [...] Existentially, Palmer interpreted Dick to further mean that reproduction violated the author's <b>concept</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> made an object unique and valuable: [...] "A thing can't be a real thing unless it is in some sense an individual thing." ...|$|E
