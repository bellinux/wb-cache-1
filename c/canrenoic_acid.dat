50|$|Potassium canrenoate (INN, JAN) or canrenoate {{potassium}} (USAN) (brand names Venactone, Soldactone), {{also known}} as aldadiene kalium, the potassium salt of <b>canrenoic</b> <b>acid,</b> is an aldosterone antagonist of the spirolactone group. Like spironolactone, it is a prodrug, and is metabolized to active canrenone in the body.|$|E
50|$|Canrenone is {{an active}} {{metabolite}} of spironolactone, <b>canrenoic</b> <b>acid,</b> and potassium canrenoate, and {{is considered to be}} partially responsible for their effects. It has been found to account for approximately 10 to 25% of the potassium-sparing effect of spironolactone, whereas another metabolite, 7α-thiomethylspironolactone (7α-TMS), accounts for around 80% of the potassium-sparing effect of the drug.|$|E
40|$|Elevated plasma {{concentrations}} of aldosterone (ALDO) are ob-served in patients treated with spironolactone. Because ALDO is eliminated via UGT 2 B 7 -catalyzed 18 -glucuronidation, this study aimed {{to determine whether}} spironolactone and its primary me-tabolites, canrenone and <b>canrenoic</b> <b>acid,</b> inhibit ALDO 18 -glucu-ronidation by recombinant UGT 2 B 7 and by human liver (HLM) and human kidney cortical (HKCM) microsomes. Initial experiments characterized the effects of all three compounds on 4 -methylum-belliferone and ALDO glucuronidation by recombinant human UGT 2 B 7. IC 50 values for spironolactone and canrenone ranged from 26 to 50 M, whereas <b>canrenoic</b> <b>acid</b> was a weak inhibitor. Inhibitor constant (Ki) values for spironolactone and canrenone inhibition of ALDO 18 -glucuronidation were subsequently deter-mined with HLM, HKCM, and UGT 2 B 7 as the enzyme sources. Spironolactone and canrenone were competitive inhibitors o...|$|E
40|$|Aims: We {{questioned}} whether aldosterone and oxidative stress {{play a role}} in vascular damage in severe hypertension and investigated the role of Nox 1 in this process. Materials and methods: We studied mesenteric arteries, aortas and vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) from WKY and SHRSP rats. Vascular effects of eplerenone or <b>canrenoic</b> <b>acid</b> (CA) (mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) blockers), ML 171 (Nox 1 inhibitor) and EHT 1864 (Rac 1 / 2 inhibitor) were assessed. Nox 1 -knockout mice were also studied. Vessels and VSMCs were probed for Noxs, reactive oxygen species (ROS) and pro-fibrotic/inflammatory signaling. Key findings: Blood pressure and plasma levels of aldosterone and galectin- 3 were increased in SHRSP versus WKY. Acetylcholine-induced vasorelaxation was decreased (61...|$|E
40|$|We have {{established}} a sensitive and specific radioreceptor assay for androgen receptor active materials in plasma, using tritiated methyltrienolone ([3 H]R 1881) as tracer, and spayed mouse kidney cytosol receptor as the binding species. On radioreceptor assay, plasma from mice chronically administered spironolactone contained approximately 10 times higher levels of androgen receptor active material than from mice administered potassium canrenoate. In parallel bioassays (antagonism {{of the effect of}} testosterone on seminal vesicle weight), spironolactone was greater than 4 times as potent an antiandrogen as potassium canrenoate. Administered potassium canrenoate circulates as <b>canrenoic</b> <b>acid,</b> in equilibrium with its lactonized congener canrenone. Since over 80 % of administered spironolactone is irreversibly converted to canrenone/canrenoic acid, its much higher anti-androgen activity on radioreceptor assay and bioassay may point to the generation of unidentified, minor metabolites with very high affinity for androgen receptors and/or a very long plasma half-life...|$|E
40|$|Relatively few {{selective}} substrate and inhibitor probes {{have been}} identified for human UDP-glucuronosyltransferases (UGTs). This work investigated the selectivity of trifluoperazine (TFP), as a sub-strate, and amitriptyline, androsterone, <b>canrenoic</b> <b>acid,</b> hecogenin, phenylbutazone, quinidine, quinine, and sulfinpyrazone, as inhibi-tors, for human UGTs. Selectivity was assessed using UGTs 1 A 1, 1 A 3, 1 A 4, 1 A 6, 1 A 7, 1 A 8, 1 A 9, 1 A 10, 2 B 7, and 2 B 15 expressed in HEK 293 cells. TFP was confirmed as a highly selective substrate for UGT 1 A 4. However, TFP bound extensively to both HEK 293 lysate and human liver microsomes in a concentration-dependent manner (fuinc 0. 20 – 0. 59). When corrected for nonspecific binding, Km values for TFP glucuronidation were similar for both UGT 1 A 4 (4. 1 M) and human liver microsomes (6. 1 1. 2 M) as the enzyme sources. Of the compounds screened as inhibitors, hecogenin, alone, was selective; significant inhibition was observed only fo...|$|E
40|$|An {{analytical}} procedure {{was developed for}} the fast screening of 16 diuretics (acetazolamide, althiazide, amiloride, bendroflumethiazide, bumetanide, <b>canrenoic</b> <b>acid,</b> chlorthalidone, chlorthiazide, clopamide, ethacrynic acid, furosemide, hydrochlorthiazide, hydroflumethiazide, indapamide, triamterene, trichlormethiazide) and a masking agent (probenecid) in human urine. The whole method involves three analytical steps, including (1) liquid/liquid extraction of the analytes from the matrix, (2) their reaction with methyl iodide at 70 ◦C for 2 h to form methyl derivatives, (3) analysis of the resulting mixture by fast gas chromatography/electron impact mass spectrometry (fast GC/EI-MS). The analytical method was validated by determining selectivity, linearity, accuracy, intra and inter assay precision, extraction efficiencies and {{signal to noise ratio}} (S/N) at the lowest calibration level (LCL) for all candidate analytes. The analytical performances of three extraction procedures and five combination of derivatization parameters were compared in order to probe the conditions for speeding up the sample preparation step. Limits of detection (LOD) were evaluated in both EI-MS and ECNI-MS (electron capture negative ionization mass spectrometry) modes, indicating better sensitivity for most of the analytes using the latter ionization technique. The use of short columns and high carrier gas velocity in fast GC/MS produced efficient separation of the analytes in less than 4 min, resulting in a drastic reduction of the analysis time, while a resolution comparable to that obtained from classic GC conditions is maintained. Fast quadrupole MS electronics allows high scan rates and effective data acquisition both in scan and selected ion monitoring mode...|$|E
40|$|Both {{spironolactone}} (SP) and {{its main}} metabolite, <b>canrenoic</b> <b>acid</b> (CA), prolong cardiac action potential duration and decrease the Kv 11. 1 (HERG) current. We {{examined the effects of}} SP and CA on cardiac hKv 1. 5, Kv 4. 3 and Kv 7. 1 +minK channels that generate the human IKur, Ito 1 and IKs, which contribute to the control of human cardiac action potential duration. hKv 1. 5 currents were recorded in stably transfected mouse fibroblasts and Kv 4. 3 and Kv 7. 1 +minK in transiently transfected Chinese hamster ovary cells using the whole-cell patch clamp. SP (1 [*]μM) and CA (1 [*]nM) inhibited hKv 1. 5 currents by 23. 2 ± 3. 2 and 18. 9 ± 2. 7 %, respectively, shifted the midpoint of the activation curve to more negative potentials and delayed the time course of tail deactivation. SP (1 [*]μM) and CA (1 [*]nM) inhibited the total charge crossing the membrane through Kv 4. 3 channels at + 50 [*]mV by 27. 1 ± 6. 4 and 27. 4 ± 5. 7 %, respectively, and accelerated the time course of current decay. CA, but not SP, shifted the inactivation curve to more hyperpolarised potentials (Vh− 37. 0 ± 1. 8 vs − 40. 8 ± 1. 6 [*]mV, n= 10, P< 0. 05). SP (10 [*]μM) and CA (1 [*]nM) also inhibited Kv 7. 1 +minK currents by 38. 6 ± 2. 3 and 22. 1 ± 1. 4 %, respectively, without modifying the voltage dependence of channel activation. SP, but not CA, slowed the time course of tail current decay. CA (1 [*]nM) inhibited the IKur (29. 2 ± 5. 5 %) and the Ito 1 (16. 1 ± 3. 9 %) recorded in mouse ventricular myocytes and the IK (21. 8 ± 6. 9 %) recorded in guinea-pig ventricular myocytes. A mathematical model of human atrial action potentials demonstrated that K+ blocking effects of CA resulted in a lengthening of action potential duration, both in normal and atrial fibrillation simulated conditions. The results demonstrated that both SP and CA directly block hKv 1. 5, Kv 4. 3 and Kv 7. 1 +minK channels, CA being more potent for these effects. Since peak free plasma concentrations of CA ranged between 3 and 16 [*]nM, these results indicated that blockade of these human cardiac K+ channels can be observed after administration of therapeutic doses of SP. Blockade of these cardiac K+ currents, together with the antagonism of the aldosterone proarrhythmic effects produced by SP, might be highly desirable for the treatment of supraventricular arrhythmias...|$|E
