40|$|Time to build” {{models of}} <b>investment</b> <b>expenditures</b> play an {{important}} role in many traditional and modern theories of the business cycle, especially for explaining the dynamic propagation of shocks. We estimate the structural parameters of a time-to-build model using firm-level investment data on equipment and structures. For equipment expenditures, we find no evidence of time-to-build effects beyond one period. For structures, by contrast, there is clear evidence of time to build in the range of 2 - 3 years. The contrast between equipment and structures is intuitively reasonable and consistent with previous results. The estimates for structures also indicate that initial-period expenditures are low, and increase as projects near completion. These results provide empirical support for including “time to plan” effects for investment in structures. More generally, these results suggest a potential source of specification error for Q models of investment and production-based asset pricing models that ignore the time required to plan, build and install new <b>capital.</b> <b>Investment</b> <b>expenditures,</b> Panel data, Italian firms, Time to build...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a dynamic investment model that explains {{differences in the}} sensitivity of small- and large-sized firms {{to changes in the}} money market interest rate. In contrast to existing studies on the firm size effects of monetary policy, the importance of firms as monetary transmission channel does not originate from credit market imperfections, but from size-related differences in the degree of investment irreversibility. The degree of investment irreversibility is determined by sunk <b>capital</b> <b>investment</b> <b>expenditures.</b> We show that size-related differences in sunk <b>investment</b> <b>expenditures</b> have two interdependent effects: they (i) affect the optimal investment behavior of small- and large-sized firms and (ii) account for differences in the interest rate sensitivity of small- and large-firm investment. We illustrate that sunk <b>investment</b> <b>expenditures</b> affect the region of zero and non-zero investment activity and, hence, the frequency at which large and small firms change investment regimes. Furthermore, sunk investment costs {{determine the extent to which}} small- and large-firm investment displays discrete jumps. We find that large firms change investment regimes less frequently than small firms and that swings in investment are more accentuated for large than for small firms. We illustrate that the response of small- and large-firm investment to monetary policy actions depends on the magnitude of the monetary policy shock.

30|$|By {{reviewing}} the literature, we propose an expansion co-planning (ECP) framework in a combined electricity market {{to address the}} above challenges. In this ECP model, the responsibility of planning the coupled natural gas and power system is undertaken by an independent system operator (ISO), which takes a similar role to Australian Energy Market Operators (AEMO) [22]. AEMO manages the Australia national electricity and gas markets through regulating the third party, which executes the function of maintaining and augmenting the system infrastructure. Focusing on providing planning suggestions with regard to network capability and constraints, AEMO leaves the investment decision to involved third party asset owners. From the point of ISO, the ECP model is a co-optimization problem, reflecting the non-linear and non-convex characteristics of integrated systems. The model is formulated {{for the sake of}} minimizing the total cost of gas and power sectors, in the meanwhile, meeting a variety of technical constraints. It is worth noting that in this research, the energy conversion efficiency between gas and electricity is considered in the ECP constraints as well. The innovative contributions of this paper are summarized as threefold: 1) Decision analysis is adopted to deal with uncertainties of the combined market in the planning process; 2) By using the method of selecting the maximum benefit ratio, augmentation options regarding <b>capital</b> <b>investments,</b> <b>expenditure</b> reductions and market benefits are compared; 3) DR impacts on gas and electricity expansion co-planning are detailed addressed in this research.|$|R

This paper exploits newly available data to examine the pattern of actual industrial use of antidumping in nine of the major"new user"developing countries - Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, India, Indonesia, Mexico, Peru, Turkey and Venezuela. For these countries we are able to match data from two newly available sources: data on production in 28 different 3 -digit ISIC industries from the Trade, Production and Protection Database to data on antidumping investigations, outcomes and imports at the 6 -digit Harmonized System (HS) product level from the Global Antidumping Database. Our econometric analysis is to estimate a two-stage model of the industry-level decision to pursue an antidumping investigation and the national government's decision of whether and how much antidumping import protection to provide. First, we find evidence consistent with the theory of endogenous trade policy: larger industries that face substantial import competition are more likely to pursue an antidumping investigation, and larger and more concentrated industries receive greater antidumping protection from imports. Second, we find that industries that use antidumping are more likely to face the changing economic conditions specified by the technical evidentiary criteria of the WTO Antidumping Agreement: industries that face rapidly falling import prices are more likely to pursue an investigation, and industries that are more susceptible to cyclical dumping due to greater <b>capital</b> <b>investment</b> <b>expenditures</b> and that face rapidly increasing competition from imports receive greater antidumping protection.

The total environmental capital expenditure of 8. 7 billion by our sample firms during 1989 - 2000 supports the focus on this industry.

The existing environmental literature suggests that investors condition their evaluation of the future economic benefits arising from environmental capital expenditure on an assessment of the firms 2 ̆ 7 environmental performance.

Organizational performance was assessed by analyzing return on common equity and return on asset measures. ^ Data was analyzed using discriminant analysis, within and between group analyses, and multiple regression/correlation analysis. A set of analyses was conducted for a matched pair of firms in which the treatment firm passed its first antitakeover amendment in 1983. In addition, this same set of analyses was replicated for a matched pair of firms in which the treatment firm passed its first antitakeover amendment in 1984. ^ The results of this research fall to indicate the existence of a general main effect of antitakeover amendments on the outcome measures related to the strategic, managerial, and organizational outcomes for either the 1983 or 1984 samples of firms. These findings dispute many of the arguments, both pro and con, concerning the relative merits of antitakeover amendments. While results indicate that antitakeover amendments do not adversely affect organizations, findings also suggest that they do not benefit them either. Results do indicate, however, that the relationship between antitakeover amendments and some outcome measures, especially those related to organizational performance, may be dependent upon the level of the outcome measure in prior periods. These findings indicate that the impact of antitakeover amendments on various outcomes may be more complex than existing literature would suggest. ...|$|R

Cloudbased SMEs and start-up firms therefore have the capacity to be ‘born-global’ by their very nature. The Cloud computing paradigm however brings associated threats for SMEs, including potential challenges in adapting to Cloud-based business models and increased competition from globally based competitors.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to model the impact of {{uncertainty}} on the investment decisions of firms in Europe and in Greece. To do so, the thesis builds a dynamic investment model, where financial variables, uncertainty and real investment are linked. In the absence of deviations from the neoclassical paradigm investment reacts positively to uncertainty. However, as frictions are introduced such as imperfect competition, irreversibility of capital and decreasing returns-to-scale, the positive sign of the investment-uncertainty relationship gradually dies out and eventually turns negative. Furthermore, this thesis provides empirical evidence in favour of the theoretical prediction by Lee and Shin (2000) that uncertainty may exert a non-uniform impact on investment as decision makers' production functions exhibit differential labour shares. Alternative measures of capital irreversibility are employed, stemming from either the technological or the transactional nature of irreversibility. The technology-based definition views irreversibility {{in terms of the}} ability to substitute labour for capital. From a transactions-based concept, data on used <b>capital</b> <b>investment</b> <b>expenditures</b> and leasing penetration rates are employed as indirect indicators for the degree of irreversibility. Consistent with the relevant literature, the empirical results indicate that the negative effect of uncertainty on investment is monotonically increasing with the degree of irreversibility. The extant literature focusing on the impact of uncertainty on investment has largely ignored capital heterogeneity. This thesis fills this apparent gap having as departure point {{the fact that in the}} presence of multiple <b>capital</b> goods total <b>investment</b> rate is the product of the extensive and intensive margins. Then building on the argument that uncertainty affects directly the extensive margin we empirically explore their relationship. Our main results indicate that uncertainty exerts a significantly negative impact on the number of capital types (extensive margin) the decision maker decides to invest in. In contrast the depth of investment (intensive margin) is found to be insensitive to uncertainty. We employ a dynamic panel data methodology, the GMM estimation technique, on a panel data set at an industrial level for most of the continental European countries for the periods 1987 - 2002, 1989 - 2004 and 1995 - 2003. In addition, a panel data set of Greek manufacturing industries is also exploited over the period 1993 - 2001. Finally, conditional volatility is generated in a panel framework applying the Pooled-Panel GARCH method. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper assesses Benin’s Fourth Review Under The Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF). Macroeconomic {{performance}} remained broadly in {{line with}} the objectives of the PRGF-supported program in 2002. All performance criteria for end-September 2002 were met, and the four structural benchmarks were observed by end-December 2002. However, spending on health and education remained below quantitative benchmarks, and the civil service reform continued to stall. The authorities finalized the poverty reduction strategy for 2003 – 05, which aims at achieving strong economic growth and reducing poverty, while maintaining financial stability.

40|$|Buildings {{are one of}} {{the major}} {{infrastructure}} investments in cities. Sustainable preservation of building assets in order to deliver an appropriate level of service throughout their life cycle requires a comprehensive and optimised decision making methodology. This decision making method needs to be supported not only by accurate data, but also by proper manipulation and aggregation techniques to target the highest potential longevity of construction materials. Condition monitoring methods help asset managers collect required information about their buildings to make justifiable judgments for maintenance and rehabilitation strategies. This data is collected in the condition monitoring stage within a defined scope of a condition monitoring manual. The level of detail in data collection may depend on the asset management system, element hierarchy adopted by the organization and criticality of assets. While detailed condition data is collected during building condition assessments, for higher-level optimised strategic asset management overall conditions of element groups are desirable to project the <b>capital</b> <b>investments</b> and <b>expenditures.</b> The paper reviews condition monitoring techniques for buildings and also presents a risk-based methodology for aggregating the inspected conditions to a higher group level of inspected elements which leads to a greater accuracy of decisions to be made for strategic management of buildings...|$|R
40|$|In highly industrialized countries, {{sophisticated}} {{technologies are}} continuously developed to utilize trash fish directly {{for human consumption}} rather than reducing it to fish meal and oil {{to be used for}} the production of more palatable animal protein. In seeking an outlet for trash and surplus fish in a small fishery, it is suggested that their use for direct feeding to poultry, pigs and other animals could offer the following advantages: Raise the incentive to increase the catch; Prolong the fishing season; Avoid <b>capital</b> <b>investment,</b> energy <b>expenditure</b> and ecological pollution; Fit and level of an agricultural population and thus avoid socialogical pollution; Pigs, poultry and eggs are more easily stored, transported and marketed than fishery products-as an additional source of animal protein they may improve the family diet. An estimate of 30 kg surplus offal and trash fish per fishermen per day for 100 days per annum, i. e. 3 tonnes of fish, might yield about 500 - 600 kg of meat (pig or chicken) and about 1, 000 eggs per year. About 600 kg of manure will be available for the growing of fruit and vegetab 1 e. s. Attention should be paid to the possibility of over-fishing which may result from implementing this approach...|$|R
