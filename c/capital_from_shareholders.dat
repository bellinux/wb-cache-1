3000|$|We {{apply to}} the {{concrete}} setup of a bank engaged into bilateral trade portfolios the XVA theoretical framework of [...] (Albanese and Crépey 2017), whereby so-called contra-liabilities and cost of capital are charged by the bank to its clients, {{on top of the}} fair valuation of counterparty risk, in order to account for the incompleteness of this risk. The transfer of the residual reserve credit <b>capital</b> <b>from</b> <b>shareholders</b> to creditors at bank default results in a unilateral CVA, consistent with the regulatory requirement that capital should not diminish as an effect of the sole deterioration of the bank credit spread. Our funding cost for variation margin (FVA) is defined asymmetrically since there is no benefit in holding excess capital in the future. Capital is fungible as a source of funding for variation margin, causing a material FVA reduction. We introduce a specialist initial margin lending scheme that drastically reduces the funding cost for initial margin (MVA). Our capital valuation adjustment (KVA) is defined as a risk premium, i.e. the cost of remunerating shareholder capital at risk at some hurdle rate.|$|E
40|$|Corporate law matters. Traditionally seen as {{the narrow}} study of the {{relationship}} between managers and shareholders, corporate law has frequently been relegated to the margins of legal discussion and political debate. The marginalization of corporate law has been especially prevalent among those who count themselves as progressives. While this has not always been true, in the last generation or so progressives have focused on constitutional law and other areas of so-called public law, and have left corporate law to adherents of neoclassical law and economics. To the extent that the behavior of businesses has been a matter of concern, that concern has been aimed at adjusting the rules of environmental law, administrative law, employment law, and the like. The time has come to reclaim corporate law as a topic of wide debate and progressive concern. Instead of being a narrow discipline with limited implications, corporate law determines the rules governing the organization, purposes, and limitations of some {{of the largest and most}} powerful institutions in the world. By establishing the obligations and priorities of companies and their management, corporate law affects everything from employees 2 ̆ 7 wage rates, to whether companies will try to skirt environmental laws, to whether they will tend to look the other way when doing business with governments that violate human rights. Corporate law also determines whether corporations will look at the long term or the short term, whether they will see themselves as owing any responsibilities to stakeholders other than shareholders, and indeed whether they consider themselves to be constrained by law at all. The main thesis of this article is that corporate law is much more important than most progressives realize. Corporate law can be part of the wider task of regulating corporations in particular and business in general. The rules that govern corporations should more expressly take into account the fact that corporations are collective enterprises that demand investment from a number of different sources. These investments come in various forms: inflows of <b>capital</b> <b>from</b> <b>shareholders</b> and creditors; cash inflows from customers; infrastructural support from governments and communities; and effort, intelligence, and direction from employees. Whereas corporate law presently focuses on the financial investments of shareholders only, it could, and should, be adjusted to take into account the contributions of non-equity investors. Adjusted in this way, corporate law will make it more possible for corporations to serve their purpose of facilitating the creation of wealth, broadly defined and distributed...|$|E
40|$|Savings banks {{differ from}} {{other types of}} banks, {{in the sense that}} they have noshareholders. This does however not mean that savings banks can ignore {{fundamental}} financial principles. Instead they are even more dependent on their ability to generate profits, since they cannot raise additional equity <b>capital</b> <b>from</b> <b>shareholders</b> or members. Furthermore the world for financial institutions has changed during the last 20 years, and become riskier and more competitive-driven. After the deregulation of the financial market in Sweden, banks had to take on extensive risk in order to earn sufficient returns. For managing the different types of risks within a savings bank, examining the standard accounting schedules is simply not enough. Asset and Liability Management is the management of both assets and liabilities simultaneously for the purpose of mitigating interest rate risk, providing liquidity and to enhance the value of the bank. Especially the effect of interest rate changes has been an important issue for the banking industry in recent years with many arguing that for example the U. S. savings and loans crisis was a result of bad interest rate risk management. Furthermore small banks, like savings banks lack the litheness of large banks when managing interest rate risk, and the management of interest rate risk varies with bank size. Earlier studies have found that savings banks have lower interest rate risk than commercial banks in Sweden, indicating that managers in savings banks seem to be more risk averse than the managers of commercial banks. This leads us to our inquiry questions: • What are the reasons for savings banks having lower interest rate risk than commercial banks in Sweden? • In what ways is the management of interest rate risk affected by the fact that savings banks have no shareholders? • What tools for managing interest rate risk are applied by savings banks and what makes them most suitable? • What are the trade-offs between benefits and costs for actively managing interest rate risk for savings banks? The purpose of this thesis is to study how and to what extent interest rate risk is managed in four Swedish savings banks. We wrote this thesis from the bank managers’ point of view and our goal was to create valuable knowledge, regarding management of interest rate risk, for managers of savings banks. We have studied four Swedish savings banks in Västra Götalands Län and how they manage interest rate risk. This is a qualitative study where we interviewed appropriate staff members from the four savings banks. We have also used books, scientific articles and databases for collection of relevant data. We found that the level of risk taking in savings banks varies between the different savings banks in our study, and the reason for savings banks having low interest rate risk is that they lack the resources and knowledge for managing higher interest rate risk efficiently. The level of interest rate risk taking is also affected by the fact that the savings banks act in a more limited and riskier markets, and have to balance the level of risk taking within the bank. Having no shareholder makes it possible for the savings banks to pursue long-term strategies and they do not need to take on more risks in order to earn higher returns. Neither are they exposed to the same pressure as commercial banks are towards the demands from their shareholders. Instead they focus on earning money on traditional banking activities and not on speculations. All the tools available for managing interest rate risk can be applied by savings banks, but some tools are more commonly used than others. The most common tools for measuring and managing interest rate risk are the gap model and interest rate swaps. There is no need for savings banks to acquire sophisticated Asset and Liability Management tools because they do not have complex balance sheets and large number of transactions, and thus the costs exceeds the benefits. Furthermore some savings banks choose to hedge their interest rate risk to such extent, making sophisticated Asset and Liability Management tools unnecessary. The main reason for savings banks having lower interest rate risk than commercial banks is due to more cautious risk policies. However there are great differences among the savings banks that cannot be explained by size and resources. Those savings banks with cautious risk policies have an embedded philosophy within the banks, which states that profits should be earned on traditional banking activities, and not on speculations...|$|E

50|$|The mutual {{traditionally}} raises <b>capital</b> <b>from</b> its customer {{members in}} order to provide services to them (for example building societies, where members' savings enable the provision of mortgages to members). It redistributes some profits to its members. By contrast a joint stock company raises <b>capital</b> <b>from</b> its <b>shareholders</b> and other financial sources {{in order to}} provide services to its customers, with profits or assets distributed to equity or debt investors. In a mutual organization, therefore, the legal roles of customer and owner are united in one form ("members"), whereas in the joint stock company the roles are distinct. This allows a broader capital base if the customers cannot or will not provide sufficient financing to the organization. However, a joint stock company must also try to maximize the return for its owners instead of only maximizing the return and customer services to its customers. This can lead to a decline in customer service to the extent that customers', management's and shareholders' interests diverge.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In the {{aftermath}} of the crisis, valuations of fixed income derivatives have significantly diverged from the principles of arbitrage-free pricing. Discrepancies arise because of the incompleteness of collateral trading markets which lack of reverse REPO contracts for cash upgrades accepting OTC derivatives as general collateral. This circumstance forces banks to implement sub-optimal super-replication strategies generating wealth transfers across the bank <b>capital</b> structure <b>from</b> <b>shareholders</b> to senior debt holders. The present value of the wealth transfer is the FVA. To avoid losses to shareholders, the bank cannot realistically carry out a Modigliani-Miller arbitrage which would involve buying back all its debt liabilities using equity capital or shorting its own credit. Transferring FVA costs to clients is a suboptimal solution which engenders systemic arbitrage opportunities and drives the financial system away from Pareto optimality. In this paper, we argue that one can arrive to economic equilibrium not with one but with two universal agents whereby market risk and credit risk are managed by two separate legal entities. In this context, we discuss market-completing collateral trading strategies which solve the problem at the root. They reduce or eliminate the FVA and DVA. They also exploit the form of bank capital structure arbitrage revealed in current derivative valuations. Similar strategies also mitigate counterparty credit risk for banks and reduce or eliminate CVA capital charges. 1...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{considers}} the capital {{structure of a}} bank in a continuous-time regime-switching economy. The modeling framework takes into account various categories of instruments, including equity, contingent convertible debts, straight debts, deposits and deposits insurance. Whereas previous researches concentrate on {{the determination of the}} capital structure that maximizes shareholders' equity, this work focuses on the fair pricing of liabilities that ensures no cross-subsidization among stakeholders. This is discussed in a case study where the bank's EBIT is modeled by a four-regime process and is fitted to real market data. A numerical analysis reveals that convertible debts can significantly reduce the cost of deposits insurance and straight debts as well as probabilities of bankruptcy. Although it is found that the risk of dilution for shareholders is important, paradoxically, a high conversion rate for the contingent convertible debt, compensated by a low interest cost before conversion, can delay this dilution. Finally, we find that in case of change of economic regime, there exists an optimal <b>capital</b> structure <b>from</b> the <b>shareholder's</b> perspective...|$|R
