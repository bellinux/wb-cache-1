40|$|A surface-mounted permanent-magnet (PM) {{synchronous}} motor {{with a novel}} structure is presented. It has the merits of line-start, and its PMs can be magnetized postassembly.

A time-stepping finite-element method, which can simulate the dynamic magnetizing process, is used to compare the performance of different designs and determine also the parameters of the magnetizing circuit.

50|$|Current {{transformers}} typically {{consist of}} a silicon steel ring core wound with many turns of copper wire {{as shown in the}} illustration to the right.

5000|$|New {{external}} conditions also cause this process: {{for example the}} <b>copper</b> <b>bar</b> in the example steady-state conduction experiences transient conduction {{as soon as one}} end is subjected to a different temperature from the other. Over time, the field of temperatures inside the bar reach a new steady-state, in which a constant temperature gradient along the bar is finally set up, and this gradient then stays constant in space. Typically, such a new steady state gradient is approached exponentially with time after a new temperature-or-heat source or sink, has been introduced. When a [...] "transient conduction" [...] phase is over, heat flow may still continue at high power, so long as temperatures do not change.|$|E

40|$|In {{shipbuilding}} {{and many}} other industries, <b>copper</b> weld backing <b>bars</b> are used to draw the heat out of the weld. The problem that some users of these bars encounter is that these bars, on occasion, actually melt in spots and become welded to the weld plates. After this happens a number of times, the backing bar becomes so degraded {{that it must be}} either discarded or machined, both of which are very costly and time-consuming actions. To avoid this fusion between the backing bar and the weld plate, the weld processes that are used cannot be ones of high beat input. This requirement is very limiting when thick plates are being welded. The plates must be beveled, and more weld passes must be run. These problems are also costly and time consuming. The aim of this project is {{to find a way to}} produce backing bars with nearly the same `chilling` effect but with both a greater resistance to molten metal and resistance to arcing to the backing bar itself. A possible solution currently being tested is to coat the <b>copper</b> <b>bars</b> with a thin layer of a ceramic coating.

Since the voltage developed in the squirrel cage winding is very low, no intentional insulation layer is present between the bars and the rotor steel.|$|R
5000|$|In the {{standard}} {{process of making}} type, a hard metal punch (made by punchcutting, with the letter carved back to front) is hammered into a softer <b>copper</b> <b>bar,</b> creating a matrix.

The matrix can be reused to create hundreds, or thousands, of identical sorts so that the same character appearing anywhere within the book will appear very uniform, giving rise, over time, to the development of distinct styles of typefaces or fonts. After casting, the sorts are arranged into type-cases, and used to make up pages which are inked and printed, a procedure which can be repeated hundreds, or thousands, of times. The sorts can be reused in any combination, earning the process the name of [...] "movable type". (For details, see Typography.) ...|$|E

40|$|This article {{presents}} finite-element method simulation results of current distribution in an aluminum electrolytic cell. The model uses {{one quarter of}} the cell as a computational domain assuming longitudinal (along the length of the cell) and transverse axes of symmetries. The purpose of this work is to closely examine the impact of steel and <b>copper</b> collector <b>bars</b> on the cell current distribution. The findings indicated that an inclined steel collector bar (φ = 1 °) can save up to 10 – 12 mV from the cathode lining in comparison to a horizontal 100 mm × 150 -mm steel collector bar. It is predicted that a <b>copper</b> collector <b>bar</b> has a much higher potential of saving cathode voltage drop (CVD) and has a greater impact on the overall current distribution in the cell. A <b>copper</b> collector <b>bar</b> with 72 % of cathode length and size of 100 mm × 150 mm is predicted to have more than 150 mV savings in cathode lining. In addition, a significant improvement in current distribution over the entire cathode surface is achieved when compared with a similar size of steel collector bar. There is a reduction of more than 70 % in peak current density value due to the higher conductivity of copper. Comparisons between steel and <b>copper</b> collector <b>bars</b> with different sizes are discussed in terms CVD and current density distribution. The most important aspect of the findings is to recognize the influence of <b>copper</b> collector <b>bars</b> on the current distribution in molten metal.
