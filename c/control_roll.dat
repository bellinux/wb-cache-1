5|$|Newer {{aircraft}} designs {{such as the}} McDonnell Douglas MD-11 {{have incorporated}} hydraulic fuses to isolate a punctured section and prevent a total loss of hydraulic fluid. Following the UAL 232 accident, such fuses were installed in the number 3 hydraulic system in the area below the number 2 engine on all DC-10 aircraft to ensure sufficient control capability remained if all three hydraulic system lines should be damaged in the tail area. Although elevator and rudder control would be lost, the aircrew would {{still be able to}} control the aircraft's pitch (up and down) with stabilizer trim, and would be able to <b>control</b> <b>roll</b> (left and right) with some of the aircraft's ailerons and spoilers. Although not an ideal situation, the system provides a greater measure of control than was available to the crew of United 232.|$|E
25|$|In {{spacecraft}} propulsion, rocket {{engines are}} generally {{mounted on a}} pair of gimbals to allow a single engine to vector thrust about both the pitch and yaw axes; or sometimes just one axis is provided per engine. To <b>control</b> <b>roll,</b> twin engines with differential pitch or yaw control signals are used to provide torque about the vehicle's roll axis.|$|E
25|$|Little {{detail about}} the {{stabilization}} system is recorded. It is known that the horizontal tail surfaces were hinged to allow the dihedral to change and that such motions were coupled to lift-changing flaps. Together, these stabilized pitch. The wing tips could rotate to <b>control</b> <b>roll.</b> The system was pneumatically powered and could be turned on and off in flight to test its efficiency.|$|E

50|$|The SNCASO Deltaviex or SNCASO-ONERA Deltaviex {{was a small}} French {{experimental}} jet aircraft, first flown 30 April 1954 {{and distinguished}} by highly swept, small span wings. It was designed to explore the possibility of <b>controlling</b> <b>roll</b> and yaw with fine jets of air bled from the engine's compressor.|$|R
50|$|The {{player can}} also choose {{to modify the}} {{controls}} for plane-type units, such as the Re-GZ, the Valkyrie's Fighter Mode and the transformations of machines like Layzner MK II and L-Gaim MK II. Flight Mode is the standard control system, where the player <b>controls</b> <b>roll</b> and pitch with the Left Analogue Stick, and can bank with the L1 and R1 buttons. Easy Mode has the analogue stick <b>control</b> both <b>roll</b> and pitch. Flight Reverse Mode reverses the natural set-up for altitude, so that tilting the analogue Stick down causes the machine to dive, while holding it up makes the machine climb.|$|R
25|$|The {{reaction}} control {{system is the}} only way to control spacecraft attitude outside the atmosphere. It consists of three sets of thrusters: there are thrusters at each wingtip to <b>control</b> <b>roll,</b> at the top and bottom of the nose to control pitch, and at the sides of the fuselage to control yaw. All thrusters have redundant backups, so there are twelve thrusters in all.|$|E
25|$|The Evoque was {{equipped}} with either two-wheel drive or a generation IV Haldex permanent Four-wheel drive system until the 2014 model year update when the Haldex system was replaced by two optional All-Wheel Drive Systems (Standard Driveline or Active Driveline) by GKN Driveline. The Evoque also comes standard with Land Rover's latest version of Terrain Response, which maximises traction {{in a variety of}} conditions by altering throttle response, power distribution, and suspension settings. The Terrain Response system also includes electronic stability <b>control,</b> <b>roll</b> stability control, traction control, and an optional hill descent control which automatically applies braking to control speed when moving down an incline.|$|E
25|$|The {{instantaneous}} {{attitude of}} the vehicle was compared with the desired vehicle attitude in the LVDC. Attitude correction signals from the LVDC were converted into control commands by the flight control computer. The required thrust direction was obtained by gimbaling the engines in the propelling stage to change the thrust direction of the vehicle. Gimbaling of these engines was accomplished through hydraulic actuators. In {{the first and second}} stages (S-IC and S-II), the four outboard engines were gimbaled to <b>control</b> <b>roll,</b> pitch, and yaw. Since the third (S-IVB) stage has only one engine, an auxiliary propulsion system was used for roll control during powered flight. The auxiliary propulsion system provides complete attitude control during coast flight of the S-IUB/IU stage.|$|E

40|$|An {{experimental}} {{investigation has}} been made at supersonic Mach numbers to determine the feasibility of using a ram-air-spoiler <b>roll</b> <b>control</b> device on a typical canard control missile configuration. As a basis for <b>roll</b> <b>control</b> comparisons, conventional aileron controls on the tail fins were also tested. Results are presented which indicate that the addition of nacelles on the missile tail fins resulted in satisfactory <b>roll</b> <b>control</b> effectiveness and only small changes in basic missile stability.

50|$|RCS {{effectively}} reduces {{body roll}} and pitching by hydraulically connecting all the shock absorbers together and regulating their damping pressures as necessary. Able to <b>control</b> both <b>roll</b> and pitching stiffness separately, RCS can {{operate in a}} variety of ways. It can, for example, reduce roll only when required during turn in or in other situations while being set up on the soft side to prioritize tire contact and ride comfort. Since the system <b>controls</b> <b>roll</b> stiffness hydraulically, it eliminates the need for stabilizer bars. In the integrated control of its component systems, S-AWC employs information from RCS's hydraulic system to estimate the tire load at each wheel.|$|R
2500|$|In 1905, using {{a radically}} {{different}} design looking more like a tailless biplane, he devised and flew a manned [...] "glider-kite". The machine was launched on a tether like a kite, and the tether was then released to allow gliding flight. The design showed little similarity to his earlier kites, but had more {{the appearance of a}} tailless biplane. It was notable in being the first aircraft to use ailerons (in fact they were elevons) effectively to <b>control</b> <b>roll.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Early {{aircraft}} had {{a variety}} of control arrangements. The use of a joystick to <b>control</b> <b>roll</b> and pitch had been patented by Robert Esnault-Pelterie in 1907 and a similar arrangement was used by Blériot, but the Antoinette monoplanes were controlled {{by a pair of}} wheels, one {{on either side of the}} cockpit, one operating the wing-warping (or ailerons, as with the Antoinette IV) and the other the elevator [...] and the Wright Model A had one lever to control wing-warping and rudder and a second to control the elevator. [...] The first design to have the roll and pitch controls connected to a single joystick, with the yaw control operated with one's feet, was Blériot's Type VIII design of 1908-09, pioneering the basis for the modern aircraft flight control system still in use in the 21st century.|$|E

50|$|The {{design was}} professionally {{engineered}} and incorporates a very clean cantilever wing {{that results in}} a 12:1 glide ratio. The control system is two-axis, using only elevator and rudder <b>controls,</b> <b>roll</b> being introduced by rudder via a generous dihedral angle. The elevator is stick-controlled, while the rudder is controlled via conventional aircraft pedals. The aircraft is stall and spin proof. Reported construction times are 450-600 hours.|$|R

50|$|Spoilers {{fall into}} two categories: those that are {{deployed}} at controlled angles during flight to increase descent rate or <b>control</b> <b>roll,</b> {{and those that are}} fully deployed immediately on landing to greatly reduce lift ("lift dumpers") and increase drag.
