5|$|According to the Polish {{historian}} Tadeusz Mańczuk, Piłsudski – who {{was planning}} a coup d'état in Kaunas – discouraged the local PMO activists from {{carrying out the}} Sejny Uprising. Piłsudski reasoned that any hostilities <b>could</b> <b>leave</b> Lithuanians even more opposed to the proposed union with Poland (see Międzymorze). The local PMO disregarded his recommendations and launched the uprising. While locally successful, {{it led to the}} failure of the nationwide coup.|$|E

5|$|On 25 May 2011, Barton's agent Willie McKay {{confirmed}} {{that his client}} would not be signing a new contract at St James' Park after contract talks broke down between the club and player. Barton was officially transfer listed by Newcastle on 1 August 2011, {{and it was also}} stated that he <b>could</b> <b>leave</b> for free with his current contract yet to expire. Barton was set to leave Newcastle following his teammate Kevin Nolan, who had earlier joined West Ham United, but Barton insisted on not moving. Joey Barton also criticised the Newcastle board after it was decided he <b>could</b> <b>leave</b> the club on a free transfer. With Newcastle continuing to decline the offer of a new contract, after he refused an earlier offer, on 24 August 2011, Barton was given permission to talk to QPR. Thanking the Newcastle fans, he left on 26 August 2011.|$|E

5|$|There is {{no formal}} {{sub-classification}} for the non-standard Type Ia supernovae.

This type of supernova may not always completely destroy the white dwarf progenitor and <b>could</b> <b>leave</b> behind a zombie star.|$|E
5|$|Eventually, Dexagoridas, {{one of the}} two {{garrison}} commanders, {{sent word}} to the Roman legate {{that he was willing to}} surrender the city. This plan fell through when Gorgopas, the other commander, learned of it and slew Dexagoridas with his own hands. Gorgopas continued to resist fiercely until Flamininus arrived with 4,000 additional troops that he had recently recruited. The Romans renewed their assault and Gorgopas was forced to surrender, though he did secure the condition that he and his garrison <b>could</b> <b>leave</b> unharmed and return to Sparta.|$|E

In the meantime, Principal Seymour Skinner and Edna Krabappel attend and have a conversation which leads to them discovering that they have romantic feelings for each other. They end up kissing in Martin's pink playhouse in an act witnessed by Bart Simpson, who did not get sick since he fed his oysters to Martin's cat, along with Lisa who feigns sickness so she <b>could</b> <b>leave</b> without excuse.|$|E
5|$|Sheriff Andrew Jackson (Lenny Von Dohlen) {{rules the}} death an accident, but Shawn {{receives}} the Dewey Decimal Classification number of a book, Reincarnation and Rebirth, {{the title of}} which parallels the revelation that Paula had supposedly drowned in Santa Barbara, California seven years earlier, though her body was never found. Bob reveals that Michelle's unstable sister Lucy left Dual Spires, taking with her Paula, whom Michelle and Bob had all but raised. When Paula sent them a letter detailing the drug use and child abuse, they helped Paula fake her death so she <b>could</b> <b>leave</b> Lucy. Detectives Juliet O'Hara (Maggie Lawson) and Carlton Lassiter (Timothy Omundson) reopen the case and leave to issue a warrant for Bob's arrest.|$|E
5|$|The {{situation}} would deteriorate further, additional legal and financial irregularities were uncovered, leaving Smallpeice {{and the other}} directors to consider resignation. Smallpeice was informed, after consulting Nicholas Wilson, a partner with Slaughter and May {{that he and the}} other directors <b>could</b> <b>leave</b> themselves liable to legal action for dereliction of duty. Counsel advised Smallpeice and the other directors that they should submit Lonrho to inspection by the Department of Trade and Industry, but in discussions with the Governor of the Bank of England, Sir Leslie O'Brien, this course of action was recommended against.|$|E

The Portuguese aristocracy carried with them all they <b>could,</b> <b>leaving</b> the Bank of Brazil bankrupt.

Groves then sent a personal letter to the head of their university or company asking for them to be released for essential war work. At the University of Wisconsin–Madison, Stanislaw Ulam gave one of his students, Joan Hinton, an exam early, so she <b>could</b> <b>leave</b> to do war work. A few weeks later, Ulam received a letter from Hans Bethe, inviting him to join the project. Conant personally persuaded Kistiakowsky to join the project.|$|E
5|$|A krsnik or kresnik {{was a man}} {{born with}} a caul, who <b>could</b> <b>leave</b> his body in spirit {{transformed}} into an animal. He fought demonic men called vukodlak (werewolves) and other evil agents. His victory meant that his village would have the abundance {{of all sorts of}} agricultural products. The krsnik was recorded in Istria, Gorski Kotar, the Kvarner Gulf, and parts of Slovenia. The benandanti were men born with a caul recorded in the region of Friuli in north-eastern Italy. They periodically fought for the fertility of the fields against male and female witches. The táltos, recorded in Hungary, were men and women born with teeth or some other physical peculiarity. They periodically fought each other in the shape of animals or flames. Their battles were often accompanied by storms. The winner would ensure abundant harvest for his village. The benandanti and the táltos were initiated at a certain age into their vocation by an older member of the same group, who visited them in a vision.|$|E
5|$|During early pregnancy, type 1 lobules {{quickly become}} type 2 lobules because {{of changes in}} {{estrogen}} and progesterone levels. Maturing into type 3 and then reaching full differentiation as type 4 lobules requires an increase of human placental lactogen (hPL) which occurs {{in the last few}} months of pregnancy. According to the abortionbreast cancer hypothesis, if an abortion were to interrupt this sequence then it <b>could</b> <b>leave</b> a higher ratio of type 2 lobules than existed prior to the pregnancy. Russo and Russo have shown that mature breast cells have more time for DNA repair with longer cell cycles, accounting for the slightly reduced risk of breast cancer for parous women against the baseline risk for women who have never conceived and those who have conceived and terminated their pregnancies.|$|E

5|$|Filming {{began on}} June 26, 1997, and ended on September 30 of that year, {{primarily}} {{taking place at}} Leavesden Film Studios in England. Leavesden was leased for a {{two and a half}} years so the production company <b>could</b> <b>leave</b> the sets intact and return after principal photography had been completed. The forest scenes on Naboo were filmed at Cassiobury Park in Watford, Hertfordshire. Pick-ups were shot between August 1998 and February 1999 after Lucas screened a rough cut of the film for friends and colleagues in May 1998. Most of the action and stunts were filmed by Roger Christian's second unit, which worked alongside the main unit instead of afterwards because of the high number of shots to be completed daily.|$|E
5|$|Following Blackburn's relegation, it was rumoured that Robinson would {{immediately}} {{return to the}} top flight, with Queens Park Rangers and West Ham United said to be interested, however no move materialized. Speculation continued over Robinson's future throughout the season, with Brad Friedel being rumoured to be returning to the club (a rumour he denied), further fuelled by Robinson being dropped in December for a match against Blackpool in favour of Jake Kean, with Robinson having played every match {{at that point in}} the season. However, following the match against Blackpool, Robinson did not make any further appearances, with Kean taking the goalkeeper position, fuelling further rumours that Robinson <b>could</b> <b>leave,</b> and Robinson was made available for loan in February. In March, Robinson was ruled out {{for the rest of the}} season with a back injury; however, in April, he suffered complications, and was ruled out for six months as a result of a pulmonary embolism following his surgery. He finished the season having made 21 league appearances for the club.|$|E
5|$|In 2003, NSB {{announced}} {{that they wanted to}} discontinue their operations in Narvik, hoping they <b>could</b> <b>leave</b> operation of passenger trains on the Ofot Line to Ofotbanen. In May, NSB signed an agreement with Ofotbanen, where the latter would take over NSB's responsibilities to operate trains from Narvik to Riksgränsen along the Ofot Line. The initial contract would last until 2006, and NSB paid NOK 13 million for the service. From 15 June, Ofotbanen took over all passenger transport on the line, including employing all former NSB employees in Narvik. On the same day, Connex Tåg took over the operations on the Swedish side of the border after winning a public service obligation contract with the Swedish government, and dismissing SJ of the right to offer the service. An operating and security license was granted from the Norwegian Railway Inspectorate to Ofotbanen on 11 June.|$|E

5|$|In November, Chaplin {{began working}} with Cherrill again {{in some of the}} Flower Girl's less {{dramatic}} scenes. While waiting for her scenes for several months, Cherrill had become bored and openly complained to Chaplin. During the filming of one scene, Cherrill asked Chaplin if she <b>could</b> <b>leave</b> early so that she could go to a hair appointment. Chaplin fired Virginia Cherrill and replaced her with Georgia Hale, Chaplin's co-star in The Gold Rush. However, Hale's screen tests proved that she was unsuitable for the role. Chaplin also briefly considered sixteen-year-old actress Violet Krauth, but he was talked out of this idea by his collaborators. Chaplin finally re-hired Cherrill to finish City Lights. She demanded and got a raise to $75 per week. Approximately seven minutes of test footage of Hale survives and is included on the DVD release; excerpts were first seen in the documentary Unknown Chaplin along with an unused opening sequence.|$|E
5|$|Individuals who <b>could</b> <b>leave</b> {{their body}} in spirit during sleep were called burkudzäutä among the Ossetians of the Caucasus, {{and they were}} called mazzeri in parts of Corsica. The burkudzäutä, mounted on animals or {{household}} objects, flew on a night between Christmas and New Year to burku, {{the land of the}} dead described as a great meadow. There they collected the seeds of agricultural plants and took them to their village, thus ensuring a rich harvest. The dead pursued and shot arrows at them as they flew back home. The wounded burkudzäutä would fall sick after the return, and some of them would die. The mazzeri of neighbouring villages fought each other in spirit on the night between 31July and 1August. The village of the defeated mazzeri would suffer more deaths during the next year.|$|E
5|$|It {{conveyed}} a {{tenth of}} the royal demesne– the lands of the crown as opposed to the personal property of the sovereign– into the hands of churches, ecclesiastics and laymen. In Anglo-Saxon England property was either folkland or bookland. The transmission of folkland was governed by the customary rights of kinsmen, subject to the king's approval, whereas bookland was established by the grant of a royal charter, and could be disposed of freely by the owner. Booking land thus converted it by charter from folkland to bookland. The royal demesne was the crown's folkland, whereas the king's bookland was his own personal property which he <b>could</b> <b>leave</b> by will as he chose. In the decimation Æthelwulf may have conveyed royal folkland by charter to become bookland, in some cases to laymen who already leased the land.|$|E
