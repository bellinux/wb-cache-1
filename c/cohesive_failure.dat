5000|$|Amorphous {{polyolefin}} (APO/APAO) polymers {{are compatible}} with many solvents, tackifiers, waxes, and polymers; they find wide use in many adhesive applications. APO hot melts have good fuel and acid resistance, moderate heat resistance, are tacky, soft and flexible, have good adhesion and longer open times than crystalline polyolefins. APOs tend to have lower melt viscosity, better adhesion, longer open times and slow set times than comparable EVAs. Some APOs can be used alone, but often they are compounded with tackifiers, waxes, and plasticizers (e.g., mineral oil, poly-butene oil). Examples of APOs include amorphous (atactic) propylene (APP), amorphous propylene/ethylene (APE), amorphous propylene/butene (APB), amorphous propylene/hexene (APH), amorphous propylene/ethylene/butene. APP is harder than APE, which is harder than APB, which is harder than APH, in accordance with decreasing crystallinity. APOs show relatively low cohesion, the entangled polymer chains have fairly high degree of freedom of movement. Under mechanical load, most of the strain is dissipated by elongation and disentanglement of polymer chains, and {{only a small fraction}} reaches the adhesive-substrate interface. <b>Cohesive</b> <b>failure</b> is therefore a more common failure mode of APOs.|$|E

50|$|The natures of {{the polymer}} and the {{additives}} used to increase tackiness (called tackifiers) influence {{the nature of}} mutual molecular interaction and interaction with the substrate. In one common system, EVA is used as the main polymer, with terpene-phenol resin (TPR) as the tackifier. The two components display acid-base interactions between the carbonyl groups of vinyl acetate and hydroxyl groups of TPR, complexes are formed between phenolic rings of TPR and hydroxyl groups {{on the surface of}} aluminium substrates, and interactions between carbonyl groups and silanol groups on surfaces of glass substrates are formed. Polar groups, hydroxyls and amine groups can form acid-base and hydrogen bonds with polar groups on substrates like paper or wood or natural fibers. Nonpolar polyolefin chains interact well with nonpolar substrates. Good wetting of the substrate is essential for forming a satisfying bond between the adhesive and the substrate. More polar compositions tend to have better adhesion due to their higher surface energy. Amorphous adhesives deform easily, tending to dissipate most of mechanical strain within their structure, passing only small loads on the adhesive-substrate interface; even a relatively weak nonpolar-nonpolar surface interaction can form a fairly strong bond prone primarily to a <b>cohesive</b> <b>failure.</b> The distribution of molecular weights and degree of crystallinity influences the width of melting temperature range. Polymers with crystalline nature tend to be more rigid and have higher cohesive strength than the corresponding amorphous ones, but also transfer more strain to the adhesive-substrate interface. Higher molecular weight of the polymer chains provides higher tensile strength and heat resistance. Presence of unsaturated bonds makes the adhesive more susceptible to autoxidation and UV degradation and necessitates use of antioxidants and stabilizers.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{indentation}} of coated systems {{allows the}} analysis of the mechanical properties of each individual constituent, or of the entire system, including material constitutive behavior and failure properties. Due to the progressive loading and unloading of the indentation cycle, both <b>cohesive</b> and adhesive <b>failures</b> can occur in the coating and at the coating/substrate interface, respectively. In this work, the Finite Element Method (FEM) was applied to develop a numerical model based on a spherical rigid indenter in contact with a coated compliant substrate. The coating behavior was defined based on the properties of brittle pure elastic materials, while the substrate was assumed elastic-perfectly plastic. Both <b>cohesive</b> and adhesive <b>failure</b> models were included in the analyses, allowing the evaluation of failure in the coating and/or at the coating/substrate interface. The eXtended Finite Element Method (XFEM) was applied to reproduce the cohesive cracks through the coating thickness, while the Cohesive Zone Model (CZM) was used to evaluate the coating/substrate interfacial crack. System failure was analyzed considering a range of coating parameters (elastic modulus, fracture toughness, energy release rate for cohesive propagation, thickness and residual stresses), coating/substrate interface properties (interface toughness and adhesive crack energy release rate) and the radius of the spherical indenter. The range of input values resulted in simulations with <b>cohesive</b> and/or adhesive <b>failures</b> and allowed determination of a parameter that presented good correlation with the occurrence of crack propagation and <b>failure.</b> <b>Cohesive</b> <b>failures</b> in the coating also produced signatures on the load–displacement (P–h) indentation curves, which allowed the evaluation of coating fracture toughness with good agreement with the input toughness values in cases where the coating was thin...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: To {{evaluate}} {{the effect of}} two adhesive systems and different aging protocols on the bond strength of a repaired microhybrid composite. Materials and Methods: Eighty test specimens (n = 20) and 10 control specimens measuring 8 x 4 mm were fabricated of a microhybrid composite (4 Seasons, shade A 2) and grouped according to time/aging protocol: G 1 : 24 h in artificial saliva; G 2 : 7 days in artificial saliva; G 3 : 30 days in artificial saliva; G 4 : artificial accelerated aging (AAA) for 384 h; G 5 : control. After aging, samples were submitted to three types of surface treatment: SB 2 : Adper Single Bond 2, a two-step adhesive (3 M ESPE); SB 3 : Adper Scotchbond Multi-Purpose, a three-step adhesive (3 M ESPE); C: without application of adhesive (control). After this, test specimens were repaired with the same composite of a different shade (C 3), and submitted to the microtensile test at a crosshead speed of 0. 5 mm/min. Failure modes were analyzed by scanning electron microscopy (Jeol JSM 7500). Statistical analysis was performed using ANOVA and Tukey's test (p < 0. 05).

It was confirmed by investigating the fracture surfaces that the fractures of the aluminum alloy specimens occurred mainly between the aluminum alloy and the adhesive.

40|$|The {{development}} of new aesthetic materials enables the dentist to treat patients based {{on the concept of}} minimal invasive dentistry. The concept of minimal invasive dentistry, which involves preservation of tooth structure by repair of existing restorations through relayering (composite-to-composite-bonding). Improvements of composite resins and problems occurring in composite restorations due to the influence of dynamic oral conditions are described. A composite restoration ages over time and failure frequently occurs. The success of relayering depends on the strength of composite-to-composite bonding. The first aim {{of this study was to}} find the best model for simulating intra-oral aging of composite resins. The second aim was to determine the best possible conditioning method for composite-to-composite repair based on the bond strength analyses. 	In this study, the composites were aged by four aging conditions: 1) Thermocycling (5000 x, 5 - 55 ºC), 2) Storage in water at 37 ºC for six months, or 3) Immersion in citric-acid at 37 ºC, pH 3 for one week and a non-aged control, 4) Exposed to oral biofilm in vitro. To reflect what actually occurs in the oral environment, in situ studies were carried out to forward a “gold standard” for comparison of results from in vitro aging methods. Based on the “gold standard” (intra-oral aging), it is concluded that exposure to biofilm in vitro is the best method to simulate intra-oral aging. 	Composite-to-composite repair can be done either on the fresh or aged composite resins. In this study, two surface conditioning, namely intermediate adhesive resin and silica coating were applied on the microhybrid, nanohybrid and nanofilled composite resins. Intermediate adhesive resin (IAR-application) conditioning did not improve the composite-to-composite immediate repair strength. Silica coating and silanization followed by its corresponding IAR (SC-application), strongly increased repair bond strengths and provided exclusively <b>cohesive</b> <b>failures</b> in the substrate in all composite resins. Repair bond-strengths in aged composite resins after IAR-application were always lower in non-aged ones, while SC-application led to higher bond strengths than IAR-application after aging conditions. In addition, SC-application led to more <b>cohesive</b> <b>failures</b> than after IAR-application, regardless the aging method. Consequently it is argued that in general SC-application is the best conditioning method to be used in relayering of composite restorations. ...|$|R

After incubation, half of the samples were thermocycled while the other half remained untreated. Push-out bond strength was calculated, and the modes of the bond failures were determined by SEM. The highest bond strength was seen in nonthermocycled Nano-WMTA samples and the lowest in thermocycled Bioaggregate samples. The significant differences between nonthermocycled and thermocycled samples were only noticed in WMTA and Nano-WMTA groups (P< 0. 001).

40|$|Objectives To {{evaluate}} {{the influence of}} post surface pretreatment on the delamination strength of different cements from a prefabricated FRC post tested in a three-point bending test. Methods Three cements were tested; RelyX Unicem, DC Core Automix, and Panavia F 2. 0. Per cement, 40 posts (D. T. Light Post Illusion size 3) were divided into four groups; no pretreatment (control), sandblasting, silanization, and sandblasting followed by silanization. A cement layer {{was applied to the}} posts using a standardized poly-oxy-methacrylate mold. The specimens were subjected to a three-point bending test recording the initial and catastrophic failure loads. Two-way ANOVA and Tukey post-hoc tests were used to analyze the differences between the variables. Results At the initial failure load, all specimens demonstrated delamination of the cement layer, therefore initial failure load was defined as delamination strength. With RelyX Unicem, none of the pretreatments showed significant differences. When using Panavia F 2. 0, silanization (735 ± 51 MPa) resulted in higher initial failure values than sandblasting (600 ± 118 MPa). When DC Core Automix was used, silanization (732 ± 144 MPa) produced significantly higher initial failure values than the no pretreatment group (518 ± 115 MPa) and the combined sandblasting and silanization group (560 ± 223 MPa).

Eight human teeth were sectioned to expose a flat dentin surface and were then randomly assigned to 2 groups. In the control group, the dentin surfaces were treated with the adhesive according to the manufacturer's instructions. In the experimental group, liquid A was replaced by 2 % CHX. Next, a 6 -mm-high resin composite block was incrementally built on the bonded surfaces. The restored teeth were then sectioned to produce stick-shaped specimens (cross-sectional area - 0. 8 mm 2). The microtensile bond strength (&# 181;TBS) was recorded, and the failure modes were assessed. Data were analyzed by two-way repeated measures ANOVA (&# 945;= 0. 05).
