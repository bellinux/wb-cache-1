40|$|Experiments {{were carried}} out on water flowing turbulently inside {{each of the four}} {{following}} electrically heated pipes: 1. 1 " inside diameter smooth circular pipe with a long <b>calming</b> <b>section.</b> 2. The same pipe fitted with a series of turbulence promoters made from spirally twisted strips having differing pitches. 3. &frac 34; inch square pipe with a long <b>calming</b> <b>section.</b> 4. A Row Indented tube. In case (1), the local coefficients of heat transfer were calculated and the results correlated by empirical equations based on the dimensional analysis. For cases (2) and (3), the local coefficients of heat transfer were likewise calculated, and then plotted against the pipe length for different Reynolds number. After a dimensional analysis of results (for the average coefficient of heat transfer) in the case of promoters, those results were correlated with those in previous research on air flowing inside pipes having different diameters and promoters of different pitches. In the case of the square pipe, the average coefficients and the coefficients of the tube of infinite length were correlated by the methods of both Dettus & Boeltcr, and Sieder & Tate, by the use of the hydraulic diameter in the dimensionless groups. For the Row tube the average coefficients of heat transfer were correlated as functions of mass flow rate. Finally, the effect of super or abnormal turbulence on the saving of power was also studied, by the plotting of the ratio of power (at the same coefficient of heat transfer) between the plain and fitted tubes against the coefficient of heat transfer...|$|E

40|$|There exists many {{investigations}} {{in the field}} of pressure drop inside smooth tubes; however, there is a research gap where this flow is in the transitional flow regime. All work in the transitional flow regime thus far has been concerned with a single tube and in limited cases the effect of different types of inlets were investigated. Many heat exchangers such as shell-and-tube heat exchangers consist of a number of closely packed tubes leading from a common header and in some cases may operate in or close to the transitional flow regime. However, it is not known what effect adjacent tubes will have on pressure drop and the flow distribution in the transitional flow regime. The {{purpose of this study is}} therefore to investigate the effect that the presence of adjacent tubes will have on the pressure drop in the transitional flow regime. The study is limited to smooth and circular, horizontal tubes in the fully developed, transitional flow regime and adiabatic pressure drops. The transition effects were investigated experimentally by developing and building an experimental set-up on which, firstly, the pressure drops could be measured of one tube to be used as a reference and then secondly, the pressure drop of three tubes in parallel, equally spaced, 1. 4 diameters apart. The internal tube diameters of all tubes were 3. 97 mm and the tube lengths were 6 m. The pressure drops were measured over a length of 1. 97 m, at the end of the tubes where the flow was fully developed. The pressure drops were measured with pressure transducers while the inlet and outlet temperatures of the water were measured with PT 100 probes. All the tubes were connected to a <b>calming</b> <b>section</b> to ensure a square-edge inlet. Experiments were conducted with water at Reynolds numbers from 700 to 5 100 to ensure that the pressure drops and thus friction factors could be determined for fully developed flow throughout the laminar, transitional and turbulent flow regimes. The uncertainty of the friction factors were all less than 1 %. It was found that the centre tube experienced an earlier onset of transition than that previously seen in single tube tests, at a Reynolds number of 1 840. In the outer tubes, transitional flow was delayed well beyond that previously seen in literature. The flow in all three tubes underwent transition into fully developed turbulent flow by the maximum Reynolds number of 3 340. The effect of having multiple, adjacent inlets caused a maldistribution in the mass flow rate, with a 5. 8 % difference in the flow rates of the outer tubes in the transitional flow regime. New correlations were developed to predict the friction factor for transitional flow in each of three adjacent tubes at an inlet pitch distance of 1. 4 times the inner tube diameter. Overall, it can be concluded that multiple tube entrances have an effect on the transitional flow in all of the tubes and should be further investigated for other pitch distance and tube arrangements.

50|$|Prior to {{the arrival}} of Europeans, Johnstown and the {{surrounding}} area had been sporadically occupied by various Native American cultures for many centuries. Evidence of their presence such as clay utensils and arrows have been found throughout the township. No physical evidence of significant Native American settlements, such as longhouses, have been discovered within the hamlet itself, however the hamlet was apparently frequented by Natives. According to the Edwardsburgh Centennial Committee, who compiled a history of the township in 1967, Johnstown was used by Native Americans as a stopover place due to its location. Before the construction of dams and later the Seaway, Johnstown was fronted by <b>calm</b> <b>section</b> of the St. Lawrence River located between two rapids. This would have made the land of present-day Johnstown a convenient place for those travelling on the river to rest.

50|$|Thi Lo Su Waterfall is {{the main}} reason people travel to Umphang. It is the largest {{waterfall}} in Thailand, containing many smaller drops combined with a magnificent view. Its height is about 200 meters and total width is about 400 meters. It is most beautiful during rainy season from June to November because of the larger water flow. However, during this period, road access to the waterfall is closed for safety reasons and some hiking is required. The peak season for tourism is in December and January when the water level is still high and the road to waterfall (25 km) is open to the public. Only cars with four wheel drive can pass this steep and slippery road. An alternative way to reach the waterfall is by whitewater rafting downstream along the <b>calm</b> <b>section</b> of Klong River and then continuing overland on foot or by car for another about 12 km.

40|$|The paper {{presents}} a combined experimental and numerical program directed at defining a cost/effective methodology for conjugate heat transfer CFD simulations of engine water cooling jackets. As {{a first step}} in the process, deficiencies in current numerical strategies for the analysis of conjugate heat transfer problems under typical engine operating conditions are exposed and commented. Results are shown form a wide validation program based on the comparison between experimental measurements from a test facility at Villanova University and CFD predictions at the University of Modena. On the experimental side, the test apparatus consists of a test section, pump, accumulator tank, rejection heat exchanger and required pumping. The test section is provided with a constant volumetric flow rate, and consists of a cylindrical aluminum body with a drilled horizontal flow channel. The section is heated by ten cartridge heaters located at a constant radial distance from the cylinder axis. The test section is connected to the flow loop by means of two <b>calming</b> <b>sections,</b> respectively at the cylinder inlet and exit. Twenty thermocouples are used to measure the test section local temperature along a radial plane cutting the cylinder. Water / ethylene-glycol binary mixture and pure water are tested and compared during the experimental program, in order to reproduce a set of thermal situations {{as close as possible to}} actual engine cooling system operation. On the CFD side, an extensive program reproducing the experiments is carried out in order to assess the predictive capabilities of some of the most commonly used eddy viscosity models available in literature. Both non-evaporating and evaporating conditions are tested, showing severe limitations to the use of simplified boiling models to correctly capture the complex interaction between turbulent boundary layer and vapor bubble dynamics. In order to overcome the above stated deficiencies under boiling conditions, a methodology is then proposed to both improve the accuracy of the CFD forecasts and reduce the computational costs of the simulations. A few preliminary results from the validation process are shown and briefly discussed at the end of the paper...|$|R

This graduate project {{consisted of the}} public performance of two works: Ludwig van Beethoven's overture The Creatures of Prometheus, Op. 43, and Richard Strauss' Serenade for Thirteen Wind Instruments, Op. 7. The first work was performed on December 6, 1988, with the CSUN Symphony Orchestra, David Aks, Music Director. The second work was performed on April 9, 1989, {{with members of the}} Santa Monica College Symphony Orchestra, Lida Beasley, Music Director. Both performances were part of the regularly scheduled concert series given by these orchestras. The Beethoven overture is scored for the typical classical orchestra: woodwinds, trumpets and horns in pairs, tympani and strings. This C Major work is similar to the first movement sonata-form used in late Haydn and early Beethoven symphonies, although it has neither a repeated exposition nor an extended development section. The opening Adagio begins with fortissimo tutti chords followed by a <b>calm,</b> pastoral <b>section.</b> The principal melodic material is first played by the oboes and horns, later followed by first violins and tutti woodwinds. This introduction leads directly into the first section of the exposition (Allegro) where the principal theme (C Major) is stated in the first violins accompanied by the other strings. It is then restated by the full orchestra. The second section of the exposition (G Major) begins with a light, gracefully arched theme played by the flutes and echoed in turn by the oboes, clarinets and bassoons, and finally the strings. What follows is a series of short developmental sections that are used as transition material and, in this case, as the substitute for a larger, independent development section. The exposition ends with a thirty-two measure codetta, which leads directly into the recapitulation. The recapitulation contains slight modifications of the exposition. Changes in phrase lengths and tonal centers create and maintain interest without introducing new motivic material. The codetta leads into a dramatic thirty-one measure coda.

The impact of antenna beam spreading on satellite-borne sensor measurements of coastal rainfall is also illustrated. Coastal rainfall measured by the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) over the Brazilian coast both over land and sea is also compared to rainfall observed by TSX. Because the sea surface cross section varies with wind speed and the wind direction with respect to the sub-satellite track, a surface reference derived from clear regions was considered (as in the case of the TRMM surface reference method). Wind roughened seas have relatively large cross sections so that attenuation by rain of radiation reflected from the sea surface is the dominant mechanism that affects the observed radar cross <b>section.</b> <b>Calm</b> seas have lower radar cross sections so that scattering by the volume of hydrometeors becomes more significant.
