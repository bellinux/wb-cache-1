40|$|In {{a recent}} publication, Peabody and Broun (1) have reemphasized, {{in the light}} of the {{increasing}} appreciation of the r 61 e of phagocytosis, the relatively large number of phagocytic ceils to be found in the bone marrow in pernicious anemia. Sabln, Doan, and Cunningham (2), in a survey of the phagocytic cells of the spleen, bone marrow, connective tissues, and serous exudates, by means of a supravital technique, have separated these mononuclear cells, the so called reticulo-endothelial apparatus of Aschoff, into two distinct strains, monocytes and clasmatocytes. The basis of the separation is fourfold, derivational, developmental, cytological, and functional. The <b>clasmatocyte,</b> probably of endothelial origin, and now of recognized importance in the physiological destruction of old red blood ceils, is of particular interest in its possible relationship to another function attributed, at least tentatively, to endothelium (3); viz., that of being the ultimate source of the red blood cells.

40|$|We {{have been}} engaged {{for a number of}} years in {{studying}} the local intrapleural infection in rabbits produced by a strain of Streptococcus haemolyticus of increased and extreme virulence. These studies have shown that the rabbit dies uniformly of empyema on receiving a dilution of a 24 hour broth culture that contains not more than ten chains of the streptococcus. The resistance may be markedly increased, so that animals recover without lesions, by producing, with indifferent substances, cell accumulations in the wall of the pleural cavity provided that these accumulations be allowed to pass into the stage of mononuclear (<b>clasmatocyte)</b> cell infiltration (Gay, Clark and Linton). Rabbits with a granulating pleura of this type are able to withstand many multiples of the lethal dose. It appears that this accumulation of clasmatocytes is effective not as a mechanical obstruction to infection but in virtue of the phagocytic value of its accumulated cells since inoculation in the opposite pleura, where no cell accumulatio...|$|E
40|$|A. The {{essence of}} this work has been to provide a {{systematic}} description of the elements and {{an explanation of the}} chief artefacts of the bovine spleen smear together with an atlas-guide. Hence no general summary is possible. But attention should be drawn especially to the following points: (1) The most active phagocytosing cell of the bovine spleen is a lymphocyte, termed a a phagocytosing lymphocyte by us, and doubtlessly corresponding to the macrophage, <b>clasmatocyte</b> (smaller type), " splenocyte", and even perhaps the "monocyte" of some authors. (2) Phagocytosis in the spleen includes erythrocytes, leucocytes, and blood platelets. Thrombophagocytosis is a very extensive phenomenon in the spleen of bovines, only to be appreciated by the use of refined technique. (3) Monocytes are of infrequent occurrence. They are derived from reticulum cells, through an intermediate stage which may be spoken of as a monoblast; but not from lymphocytes. (4) Although ultimately in aged plasma cells distinction between the two types is impossible, plasma cells may be derived from reticulum cells and monocytes, as well as from lymphocytes. (5) The sinus-lining cells have a distinct morphology, especially in their nuclear characters and their content of iron-containing pigment "haemofuscin" at both poles of the nucleus. No evidence of phagocytic or cytogenic abilities could be demonstrated. (6) The Schweigger-Seidel sheath cells are described in smears and details of their morphology are provided. The view is advanced that they are of the same nature as reticulum cells as far as reticulin production, mobilisation and phagocytosis are concerned, although differing morphologically from them in the resting state. (7) The nature of certain puzzling epithelial-like elements in routine spleen smears was cleared up by the finding that they are mesothelial cells of the splenic serosa. B. Besides the cells already mentioned, the following elements are briefly described as they appear in the Giemsa-stained spleen smear: endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells, mast cells, eosinophils (their youthful appearance and the presence of Liebreich's alpha 1 granules are commented upon), neutrophils (mention has been made of their macrophagocytic activity), megakaryocytes, erythrocytes, as well as blood platelets, reticulin, collagen and elastic fibres, haemosiderin and "haemofuscin". C. The status and genesis of artefacts have been discussed. Theoretically a distinction can be drawn between artefacts produced by making and subsequent manipulation of preparations (exogenously produced artefacts), artefacts conditioned by states of senescence or degeneration of the cells (endogenously conditioned artefacts), and artefact-like appearances resulting from physiological processes; in practice this distinction is not always possible. The artefacts described include cellular distortion, cytoplasmic fragments and free cytoplasmic constituents, naked nuclei, distorted and smudged nuclei, various contaminants, stain deposit, etc. The effects of autolysis have also been mentioned. D. Problems of cell derivation and terminology have been discussed. E. In view of the phagocytic powers of lymphocytes and neutrophils and the inactivity of the sinus endothelium in this respect, a critique is offered on the R. E. system, and the proposal is put forward that the name be changed to "Phagocytic System". The articles have been scanned in colour with a HP Scanjet 5590; 300 dpi.

40|$|The Kupffer cells {{procured}} {{from the}} liver of the rabbit and dog for culture in vitro have the typical characters of <b>clasmatocytes.</b> They are readily discriminated from the monocytes washed from the liver with them; {{and they have}} certain peculiar features which suffice to differentiate them from some at least of the <b>clasmatocytes</b> of other organs. Their surface is extraordinarily sticky,â€”far more so than that of blood leukocytes or of the <b>clasmatocytes</b> found in peritoneal exudates; and in consequence they are exceedingly difficult to handle in vitro. They put forth enormous, pellucid, circular membranes resembling those of exudate <b>clasmatocytes</b> but larger. Splenic <b>clasmatocytes,</b> on the other hand, put forth rather small, one-sided ground-glass membranes like broad tongues. On comparing them with Kupffer cells and exudate <b>clasmatocytes</b> one perceives {{that they are not}} wholly identical in their characters, but have secondary peculiarities. However, there exist good morphological reasons for grouping them together and terming them all reticulo-endothelial. Kupffer cells are notably sensitive to injury, surviving in Tyrode solution for a much shorter time than blood leukocytes. However, they can be readily cultured on lens paper in serum. Under such circumstances they scatter on the fibres and live separately, presenting the same general aspect as when in the liver; but in the course of proliferation they soon lose some of their pronounced characters, retaining such as are common to <b>clasmatocytes</b> in general. A considerable population of ordinary leukocytes exists in the hepatic sinuses over and above those circulating in the blood. During infection, their number may greatly increase. Several cubic centimeters of packed white cells have been obtained from the liver of a sick dog.

40|$|It {{has been}} found that {{although}} there is some parallelism between the quantity of tubercle bacilli demonstrable histologically and the number of colonies that can be isolated from a given tissue, the culture method is far the more efficient in indicating quantitative relations. Tubercle bacilli were not perceived in the organs of rabbits 1 day after infection with the modified BCG although as many as 1, 500 colonies were isolated from one of them. This may be solely because {{it is difficult to see}} widely dispersed single minute acid-fast rods in the diffuse infiltrations of mononuclears with their hyperchromatic nuclei and sparse cytoplasm. Later, with the formation of tubercle, the parallelism is much closer. The culture method gives evidence concerning the number of living tubercle bacilli in the tissue. The significance of the accumulation of acid-fast particles in the tissues has been discussed. It has been seen that from the beginning this accumulation is greater in the Kupffer cells of the liver, in the macrophages of the spleen and in the reticular cells of the bone marrow than within the mononuclears of the lung, the organ where the bacilli grow with the greatest rapidity and are destroyed with the greatest difficulty. Acid-fast particles are more prominent with the bovine than with the human bacillus or the BCG, the microorganism that is destroyed with the greatest difficulty thus leaving more incompletely digested bacillary debris at a given time within the cells. Thus it seems permissible to conclude from the presence of acid-fast material that some tubercle bacilli are undergoing destruction even 24 hours after infection. The initial accumulation of polynuclear leucocytes corresponds with the subsequent severity of the infection. Despite the greater primary localization of bacilli in the liver, this initial inflammatory reaction with all three infections is much greater in the lung than in the liver. In each organ it is more intense with the bovine than with the less virulent strains. The multiplication of the bacillus and its accumulation within large mononuclear and young epithelioid cells is accompanied by an intense formation of new mononuclears by mitosis. The more rapid the growth of the bacillus, the more conspicuous the regeneration of these cells. Thus with all strains mitosis is more intense in the more susceptible organ, as in the lung compared with the liver; with the most virulent strain the most extensive and diffuse accumulation of these new cells corresponds with the greater rise in the numbers of bovine bacilli after the lag of the 1 st week. With the maturation of the epithelioid cells and the formation of tubercles the bacilli have already been greatly reduced numerically and the speed of this process diminishes with the virulence of the three strains used. The faster the development of tubercle the faster the destruction of the bacillus and the earlier the resorption of the tubercle. Tubercle bacilli never accumulate in such large numbers in the mononuclears of the liver as they do in the lung. Though at first the tubercles in the liver may be more numerous than those in the lung they never attain the same size. The formation of new mononuclears by mitosis is restricted and Langhans' giant cells appear very early (1 st and 2 nd weeks). In the lung, giant cells are not found until much later with the BCG and the human bacillus (4 th week); they were not noted in the interstitial tubercles with the bovine type, but the extension of these tubercles was accompanied by an unabated mitosis of mononuclears until the death of the animal. The liver tubercles are resorbed early even with the bovine infection. Associated with these histological differences are the slow initial growth and the early and complete destruction of the tubercle bacilli even of bovine type in the liver, and the more rapid initial growth in the lung, with the later destruction of the BCG and the human bacillus and the unabated growth of the bovine bacillus. Similar differences were observed between the splenic pulp and corpuscle. In the former the accumulation of acid-fast particles was much greater and the tubercles developed earlier. Mitosis of mononuclears was less frequent and giant cells appeared earlier. Tubercle bacilli, always intracellular, disappeared from the tubercles in the pulp sooner than from those in the corpuscle, and the tubercles themselves first disappeared from the pulp. Consequently with the persistence of bacilli mitosis continued in the tubercles of the corpuscle and these attained a much larger size. Moreover individual resistance is linked with the ability to form mature tubercles early. In two animals simultaneously infected with the same strain and killed at the same time, the destruction or retardation of the bacillus is greater in that rabbit in which maturation of the tubercle and of epithelioid cells has proceeded further (Figs. 15 and 16). These observations indicate that the mononuclears of different organs or even of the same organ, as in the different parts of the spleen, have a different capacity to destroy the tubercle bacillus, and that the transformation of the mononuclear into the mature epithelioid cell follows its destruction of the tubercle bacilli. In the lung the more virulent types of bacillus are destroyed within the epithelioid cells of interstitial tubercles but persist in foci of tuberculous pneumonia. In this organ in rabbits infected with the human strain and to a lesser degree in rabbits infected with the bovine strain, the parasite largely disappears from the epithelioid cells of interstitial tubercles. But with both strains tubercle bacilli in large numbers may accumulate within epithelioid cells lying free in the alveoli. With the human type they are numerous within the cells and free in caseous material in the localized foci of caseous pneumonia. With the bovine infection, this caseous pneumonia is more often widespread and in the areas of caseous pneumonia the greater part of the vast accumulation of bovine bacilli in the lungs is found; as many as 200, 000 colonies have been isolated from 10 mg. of tissue (Fig. 11). Flooding of the respiratory passages by the caseation of tuberculous lesions into the bronchi plays an important rÃ´le in dissemination of tubercle bacilli through the lung. The process on the contrary is predominantly interstitial when the bovine bacillus is held in check (Fig. 12). Thus there is apparently some factor acting in the alveoli that favors the growth of the parasite. The accumulation of tubercle bacilli is seen especially in the peripheral epithelioid cells in immediate contact with the alveolar space. In the same lung the bacilli are much fewer in the interstitial tubercles. The accumulation in human tuberculosis of large numbers of tubercle bacilli in the tissues lining cavities is well known. Novy and Soule (20) have shown that within certain limits the growth of the bacillus in vitro is proportional to the oxygen tension of its environment. Corper, Lurie and Uyei (21) have confirmed these observations and have noted further that a difference in the gaseous environment of the bacilli equal to the difference between the conditions existing in the alveolar air and the venous blood is sufficient to cause a considerable increase in the growth of the microorganism in vitro. Loebel, Shorr and Richardson (22) by the use of Warburg's manometer have found that the oxygen consumption of tuberculous tissue is such that a tubercle 0. 5 mm. thick would completely exhaust the oxygen of the air before it reached the center. These observations suggest that a factor responsible for the greater multiplication of the bacillus in the cells of the alveoli may be the greater oxygen tension of the alveolar air. In the liver, spleen and bone marrow even with the bovine infection many instances were found of the effective destruction of the parasite synchronously with the maturation of epithelioid cells and the formation of tubercle. On the other hand, in the spleen and bone marrow of some rabbits, living bacilli persisted within the epithelioid cells of isolated tubercles even 2 months after infection, a condition never found with the human type or BCG infection. Thus the epithelioid cell is the means of defense for the rabbit against the bovine type bacillus, and as such it is usually adequate in the liver, spleen and bone marrow though ineffective in the lung and kidney. In the latter, descending infection, and the occasional colony-like multiplication of bacilli in unorganized material, tubular casts, determine the long persistence of large numbers of bacilli in this organ. In differentiating the mononuclear phagocyte of the connective tissues into the monocyte and <b>clasmatocyte</b> Sabin and her coworkers (23) have maintained that the <b>clasmatocyte</b> can efficiently destroy the tubercle bacillus but that the monocyte and its derivatives, the epithelioid and Langhans' giant cells, cannot. With the progress of the disease they have noted that the monocytes accumulate in great numbers in the foci of infection and overflow into general circulation (4). White (24) and Sabin and her coworkers have concluded that tuberculosis is specifically a disease of the monocyte, and that this cell and its derivatives act as incubators for the tubercle bacillus. Doan and Sabin (25) have therefore sought, with indecisive results, to protect the body against tuberculosis by an antimonocytic serum. However it has been shown here that although an intense multiplication of mononuclears is associated with the growth of the tubercle bacillus, their transformation into mature epithelioid cells is constantly associated with its destruction, and the rapidity of the destruction varies with the rapidity of the maturation of tubercle. Even in the bovine infection the epithelioid cells destroy the bacilli in the liver, spleen and bone marrow as a rule, and even in the lung, keep them in check in the interstitial tubercles. The appearance of giant cells is associated with cessation or diminution of mononuclear regeneration by mitosis, and is coincident with cessation of multiplication or marked reduction in the number of living bacilli. They therefore appear earlier and in larger numbers in these organs or parts of organs that first destroy the bacillus (Figs. 16 and 17). They were not observed even 2 months after the bovine infection in the interstitial tubercles in the lung. Their absence and the continued mitosis of mononuclears, which accounts for the massive pneumonic and interstitial consolidation of the lung with this infection, were associated with the failure of the lung to destroy effectively the bovine parasite. The formation of giant cells in the pneumonic foci in the bovine infection would seem to be an exception to this rule. The Langhans giant cells have often been considered an indication of the chronicity of the pathological process. It would appear that they are formed from existing epithelioid cells when the multiplication of the bacillus has ceased and the stimulus for the formation of new cells has decreased or stopped. Giant cells were most conspicuous in the liver and splenic pulp where, with the BCG infection, no caseation ever developed, and in the liver before caseation was seen anywhere in the body. In the human and bovine infections, giant cells formed in the liver before caseation appeared. Hence caseation is not a necessary requirement for giant cell formation, as maintained by Medlar (26), though these cells frequently form about caseous material. Lymphocytes and granulation tissue do not cause the destruction of tubercle bacilli, these being destroyed in their absence. They usually appear about tubercles due to all strains and in all organs, after the greater part of the microorganisms have been destroyed (Fig. 18). The bacilli are not destroyed in the lung with bovine infection where the tubercles are usually little permeated by lymphocytes and granulation tissue. There is however, no constant relation between granulation tissue and destruction of tubercle bacilli, for in the lung after the human infection and even in other organs after the bovine infection isolated tubercles may be surrounded and penetrated by lymphocytes and granulation tissue at a time when considerable numbers of living bacilli are still histologically demonstrable within the epithelioid cells. Caseation is usually not caused by the local accumulation of tubercle bacilli. At first, when the BCG (after 1 week) and the human microorganism (after 2 weeks) are present in the cells in very large numbers as demonstrated both histologically and by culture (Figs. 4 and 13) there is no necrosis of these cells. An exception to this rule found in the lung with the bovine infection is considered below. Later, after the bacilli have been destroyed to a great extent and even though the number of bacilli is small, caseation appears (Fig. 14). After this preliminary destruction the extent of caseation apparently varies with the number of residual bacilli. With the least virulent microorganism, the BCG, few bacilli remained in the liver in the 4 th week and no caseation was seen. In the tubercles of the splenic corpuscle at the same time bacilli were somewhat more numerous and there was scant caseation. On the other hand with the human bacillus after 4 weeks more bacilli survived and caseation was more extensive in both organs; with the bovine microorganism tubercle bacilli were much more numerous and caseation was far advanced. In the lung, however, caseation appeared with the first considerable accumulation of the bovine bacilli present 2 weeks after inoculation. That the bovine bacillus is primarily more injurious to the lung of rabbits than the BCG or the human bacillus is suggested by the greater intensity of the initial inflammation and by the more conspicuous accumulation of cells in the alveoli evident from the very beginning of infection. Maximow (27) showed that bovine bacilli even in small numbers cause the death of cells in tissue cultures of rabbit lymph nodes whereas the BCG or the human bacillus may accumulate within the cells in tremendous numbers without injuring them. Nevertheless in the liver, spleen and bone marrow of the living animal, caseation does not appear at the time when bovine bacilli are most abundant, but after they have been greatly reduced in numbers. Large numbers of the less virulent types of tubercle bacilli accumulated in different organs a short time after infection do not cause caseation, and with the bovine infection caseation under the same conditions occurs only in the lung. Later when the animal is sensitized caseation occurs in various organs in the presence of the small numbers of tubercle bacilli that remain in the tissues after most of them have been destroyed, and the extent of this caseation varies with the numbers of residual bacilli. These observations suggest that a large number of bacilli fail to cause necrosis soon after infection whereas a few bacilli produce caseation in the animal that is sensitized. Many investigators have held that caseation is due to sensitization. Krause (28), Huebschman (29) and Pagel (30) think that caseation is caused by the action of tuberculin-like substances on the sensitized tissues of the allergic animal. Rich and McCordock (31) view the process in essentially the same light. Recently Schleussing (32) has suggested that caseation is a coagulation necrosis in Weigert's sense of an allergically inflamed tissue, and is similar to the necrosis of the Arthus phenomenon...|$|E

Complete sterilization of the inoculated cavity occurs on approximately the 2 nd day. The serum, defibrinated blood and artificial pleural exudate of similarly treated animals inhibits {{the growth of the}} same streptococcus in the test tube but even repeated doses of such treated blood serum fail to sterilize the culture. The coccal chains grown in such drugged serum are elongated and present pleomorphic and metachromatic organisms and may give rise to colonies that are at first less predominantly mucoid in appearance. Such organisms have, however, lost little if any of their virulence. Cooperation on the part of locally derived <b>clasmatocytes</b> is apparently required in complete sterilization of the animal body. This conclusion is reached not only by a process of exclusion from comparison with the test tube results, but through the direct histological demonstration of a precocious and increasing mobilization of <b>clasmatocytes</b> in the parietal and visceral pleura of treated animals. In other words, sulfanilamide apparently produces a bacteriostasis sufficiently marked to protect the accumulated leucocytes and to allow the natural defense macrophages to accumulate.

The method applied to the bono marrow, connective tissues, and blood has yielded information of a new sort. There is no record in the literature of its application to all of the lymph nodes of the body and a corrdation of the findings with the histology of fixed tissues. Cunningham, Sabin, and Doan (1) studied the mesenteric lymph nodes of rabbits by means of punctures of these tissues and the withdrawal of cells. In their studies of living ceils so obtained, they found over 90 per cent of the ceils to be of the lymphocytic series.

40|$|In {{this series}} of rabbits {{it was found that}} the rabbits dying during the 1 st month after an {{injection}} of I or 2 mg. of bovine tubercle bacilli show the same conditions: extreme tuberculosis of the lungs, acute splenic tumor with tuberculosis, involvement of the lymph glands, an occasional small tubercle in the liver and extensive tuberculosis of the bone marrow. The peripheral blood has shown a sharp fall in the platelet count, an anemia and a fall in the granulocytic strain of white cells, and these changes have been correlated with the condition of the bone marrow. There has also been a rise in monocytes and a fall in lymphocytes, to a reversal of the normal ratio. When the rabbits have survived the first acute phase of the disease longer than 3 to 4 weeks, there have been signs in the peripheral blood of a recovery of the bone marrow; the first indication of this has been an increase in platelets, then a rise in hemoglobin followed in 1 or 2 days by a rise in red cells and later a return of the three strains of granulocytes. The bone marrow has shown a rapid spontaneous disintegration of the epithelioid cells correlated with the appearance of increased evidence of acid-fast debris in <b>clasmatocytes,</b> especially clear in those that lie along the vessels. The animals that have survived into the 3 rd month have all shown a hyperplastic phase of the healing marrow, both the red cells and all types of the granulocytes appearing in the peripheral blood in numbers above the normal. The epithelioid cells originally containing many bacilli all disappear from the marrow and the only sign left, possibly suggestive of the tuberculosis, is the acid-fast granules in the <b>clasmatocytes.</b> Finally, the marrow becomes entirely normal, giving the normal number of red cells and granulocytes to the blood. Thus, bone marrow in the rabbit has become involved in every instance with the injection of massive doses of viable bacilli. The findings at autopsy in those animals followed during the early reaction to infection confirm this directly and, since the curves of the cells in the peripheral blood of the more chronic animals were the same during the early stages of the disease as in those that died, the same conclusion seems justified from indirect inference for them. The method of healing has been a rapid disintegration of the epithelioid cells without caseation. The bone marrow heals itself entirely regardless of the progress of the disease elsewhere, so that one sees the remarkable condition of an animal recovering from the anemia and leucopenia while dying of tuberculosis elsewhere. The spleen also shows a tendency toward spontaneous healing. In the animals that have lived beyond 100 days there has been some gradual lessening of the diffuse distribution and extent of pulmonary lesions with the development of cavitation together with a marked involvement of the kidneys and lesions in the eyes...|$|R
40|$|The {{resistance}} to deformation of polymorphonuclear neutrophile leucocytes under the conditions of our observations {{has been shown to}} be on the average considerably less than the {{resistance to}} deformation of large mononuclear leucocytes. It is recognized of course that the viscosity of leucocytes, as of other cells, may be markedly influenced by osmotic conditions (17), by the reaction of the suspending medium (18, 19), by temperature, or by injury (20, 21). Although the conditions of our observations were quite different from those of the body, they were nevertheless closely similar to those of simultaneous phagocytosis experiments in which the cells functioned exceedingly well (3). Moreover E. R. and E. L. Clark (22) have noted that polymorphonuclear leucocytes in the tails of living tadpoles were more fluid than the macrophages. And Goss (23) in microdissecting human polymorphonuclear neutrophiles reports that they are more fluid than the <b>clasmatocytes</b> and monocytes studied by Chambers and Borquist (24). Other types of leucocytes have in our experience seemed to fall between the large mononuclear and the polymorphonuclear leucocytes in their average resistance to the interfacial tensions. The leucocyte of each type studied is surrounded by an exceedingly delicate membrane. This membrane appears under the dark-field microscope as a pale, silvery line not distinguishable by inspection alone from a simple phase boundary between two immiscible liquids. That this is a membrane, however, and not a mere interface between immiscible phases, seems certain. In the first place the cell cytoplasm and the suspending medium are not immiscible. When the cell organization is broken down by the interfacial tension the greater part of the cell contents is immediately dissolved or dispersed. Goss (23) has noted that when the membrane is torn with a microdissection needle disintegration at once spreads over the membrane and the cytoplasm undergoes profound change. Moreover it is improbable that a simple phase boundary could exist in the presence of so much protein, lipoid, and other surface active materials as are present in protoplasm; the tendency of these substances to lower the free interfacial energy must necessarily tend to their adsorption in the interface until, if sufficient material is available at the interface, an adsorption film or membrane may be formed. Kite (25), in a pioneer microdissection study, described the polymorphonuclear leucocyte as "naked" protoplasm. The contradiction between this statement and those just made is more apparent than real. For the capacity swiftly to form a limiting membrane between itself and other liquids is an attribute of "naked" protoplasm, as has been shown by the beautiful experiments of Chambers (20). The present study of the wetting properties of leucocytes shows that their external membranes are hydrophilic, a character suggesting a surface in which proteins, probably bound water and salts (27), possibly the polar radicles of soaps or fatty acids, rather than non-polar lipoid groupings, are predominantly exposed. This makes it the more remarkable that a cell of such fluidity as for instance the polymorphonuclear leucocyte, composed largely of water and of water-soluble materials, should maintain its integrity in an aqueous medium with the aid of a membrane so delicate and so mobile. The mobility of the membrane, frequently extended in forming new pseudopodia or spreading over the surface of particles being ingested, must require constant entrance into and exit from the membrane of component materials, and their constant reorganization there. The limiting factors in the reformation of such a membrane would be the amounts of adsorbable materials available and their rates of movement up to the surface rather than the time required for orientation there, since the latter phenomenon is exceedingly rapid. Harkins (29), for instance has calculated that at a water-water vapor interface at 20 Â°C., from the area occupied by one molecule of water, a molecule would jump out into the vapor and a vapor molecule would fall into this area of the surface 7, 000, 000 times in one second; the time of orientation of the water molecule he estimates to be of the order of 1 / 100, 000, 000 second or less. The mammalian erythrocyte possesses a surface membrane capable of being folded and of withstanding tension in the interface. This has also been stretched by microdissection needles (21). The surface of the erythrocyte, as evidenced by its wetting properties, is relatively hydrophobic, relatively non-polar in character, as compared with the leucocyte. Evidence indicating that the erythrocyte surface contains both lipoid and protein components has been summarized in earlier papers (8, 30). We have little to add here other than to point out that the wetting properties of the chicken erythrocyte surface are similar to those fully described for the mammal. A serious source of error in certain isoelectric point determinations is discussed...|$|R
