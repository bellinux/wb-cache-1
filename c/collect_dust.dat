25|$|The Salic Law {{outlines}} {{a unique}} way of securing the payment of money owed. It is called the Chrenecruda (or crenecruda, chren ceude, crinnecruda). In cases where the debtor could not pay back a loan in full {{they were forced to}} clear out everything from their home. If the debt still could not be paid off the owner could <b>collect</b> <b>dust</b> from all four corners of the house and cross the threshold. The debtor then turned and face the house with their next of kin gathered behind them. The debtor threw the dust over their shoulder. The person (or persons) that the dust fell upon was then responsible for the payment of the debt. The process continued through the family until the debt was paid. Chrenecruda helped secure loans within the Frankish society. It intertwined the loosely gathered tribes and helped to establish government authority. The process made a single person part of a whole group.|$|E
2500|$|Another near-Earth {{possibility}} are {{the five}} Earth–Moon Lagrange points. Although they would generally {{also take a}} few days to reach with current technology, many of these points would have near-continuous solar power because their distance from Earth would result in only brief and infrequent eclipses of light from the Sun. However, the fact that the [...] Earth–Moon Lagrange points [...] and [...] tend to <b>collect</b> <b>dust</b> and debris, whereas - require active station-keeping measures to maintain a stable position, make them somewhat less suitable places for habitation than was originally believed. Additionally, the orbit of – takes them out of the protection of the Earth's magnetosphere for approximately two-thirds of the time, exposing them to the health threat from cosmic rays.|$|E

2500|$|Electrostatic {{loudspeakers}} use a {{high voltage}} electric field (rather than a magnetic field) {{to drive a}} thin statically charged membrane. Because they are driven over the entire membrane surface rather than from a small voice coil, they ordinarily provide a more linear and lower-distortion motion than dynamic drivers. They also have a relatively narrow dispersion pattern that can make for precise sound-field positioning. [...] However, their optimum listening area is small {{and they are not}} very efficient speakers. [...] They have the disadvantage that the diaphragm excursion is severely limited because of practical construction limitations—the further apart the stators are positioned, the higher the voltage must be to achieve acceptable efficiency. [...] This increases the tendency for electrical arcs as well as increasing the speaker's attraction of dust particles. Arcing remains a potential problem with current technologies, especially when the panels are allowed to <b>collect</b> <b>dust</b> or dirt and are driven with high signal levels.|$|E
2500|$|Similarly, the Pirke De-Rabbi Eliezer {{told that}} when God began {{to create the}} first person, God began to <b>collect</b> <b>dust</b> from {{the four corners of}} the world – red, black, white, and yellow. Explaining why God {{gathered}} the first person's dust from the four corners of the world, God said that if a person should travel from the east to the west, or from the west to the east, and the time should come for the person to depart from the world, then the earth {{would not be able to}} tell the person that the dust of the person's body was not of the earth there, and that the person needed to return to the place from which the person had been created. This teaches that in every place where a person comes or goes, should the person approach the time to die, in that place is the dust of the person's body, and there the person's body will return to the dust, as [...] says, [...] "For dust you are, and to dust shall you return." ...|$|E

40|$|Comets {{are some}} {{to the most}} {{primitive}} bodies {{in the solar system}} and therefore should contain elemental, chemical, and isotopic records of the early history of the solar system. An opportunity to perform in situ analyses of a comet nucleus exists with the Comet Rendezvous Asteroid Flyby (CRAF) mission. An integrated gas chromatograph/X-ray fluorescence instrument (MEDA), being proposed for inclusion onboard the CRAF spacecraft, will measure the molecular and elemental constituents of <b>collected</b> <b>dust</b> grains and ices. The gas chromatograph, employing helium ionization detectors and three columns designed to separate light gases, polar gases, and hydrocarbons will measure the volatile compounds of the biogenic elements thermally released from <b>collected</b> <b>dust</b> grains. The sensitivity of the GC for compounds of interest is at the picogram level. X-ray fluorescence utilized cryogenically cooled Si(Li) solid state detectors of nominal 150 eV resolution at 5. 9 keV. Based on laboratory work with carbonaceous meteorites, both the GC and XRF can perform meaningful analyses with a few micrograms of <b>collected</b> comet <b>dust...</b>|$|R

40|$|Dust is {{injected}} into the interplanetary medium by both comets and asteroids and {{there is reason to}} believe that particles from both of these types of sources are represented in the population of interplanetary <b>dust</b> <b>collected</b> in the stratosphere. The presence of isotopic anomalies and of adjacent mineral and carbonaceous phases that are chemically unequilibrated indicates that these particles contain primitive materials that have avoided many of the alteration processes that have affected most other extraterrestrial materials since their aggregation in the Solar nebula. This suggests that many of the subcomponents of the <b>collected</b> <b>dust</b> may have a chemical and isotopic 'memory' that extends back through the formation of the Solar System and therefore reflects the properties of interstellar dust populations. Indeed, it is possible that some of the subcomponents of the <b>collected</b> <b>dust</b> could have been true interstellar dust grains prior to the formation of the Solar nebula. The implications of this possibility will be discussed in light of our present knowledge of interplanetary dust...|$|R
