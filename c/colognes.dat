25|$|In another short, Little Beau Pepé, Pepé, {{attempting}} {{to find the}} most arousing cologne with which to impress Penelope, sprays a combination of perfumes and <b>colognes</b> upon himself. This resulted in something close to a love-potion, leading Penelope to fall madly in love with Pepé in an explosion of hearts. Pepé is revealed to be extremely frightened of overly-affectionate women ("But Madame!"), much to his dismay, as Penelope quickly captures him and smothers him in more love than even he could imagine.|$|E
25|$|In the 20th century, {{the term}} {{took on a}} second meaning. Fragrance {{companies}} began to offer lighter, less concentrated interpretations of their existing perfumes, making their products available to {{a wider range of}} customers. Guerlain, for example, offered an Eau de Cologne version of its flagship perfume Shalimar. In contrast to classical <b>colognes,</b> this type of modern cologne is a lighter, diluted, less concentrated interpretation of a more concentrated product, typically a pure parfum. The cologne version is often the lightest concentration from a line of fragrance products.|$|E

2500|$|Instead of {{building}} a perfume from [...] "ground up", many modern perfumes and <b>colognes</b> are made using fragrance bases or simply bases.

Many of Guerlain's Aqua Allegoria line, with their simple fragrance concepts, are good examples of what perfume fragrance bases are like.|$|E
