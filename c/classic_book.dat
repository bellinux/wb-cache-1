25|$|His cookbook, Paul Prudhomme's Louisiana Kitchen, was {{published}} by William Morrow and Company in 1984. It was given a Culinary <b>Classic</b> <b>Book</b> Award in 1989 by the International Association of Culinary Professionals. Prudhomme has been credited with having popularized cajun cuisine and in particular blackened redfish during the 1980s. The popularity of the fish was such that commercial fishing of the species was restricted to prevent its extinction. Prudhomme was also credited with introducing the turducken into United States cuisine.|$|E
25|$|Cattle hides and tallow, {{along with}} marine mammal fur and other goods, {{provided}} the necessary trade articles for mutually beneficial trade. The first American, English, and Russian trading ships {{first appeared in}} California {{a few years before}} 1820. The <b>classic</b> <b>book</b> Two Years Before the Mast by Richard Henry Dana, Jr. provides a good first hand account of this trade. From 1825 to 1848 the average number of ships traveling to California increased to about 25 ships per year—a large increase from the average of 2.5 ships per year from 1769 to 1824.|$|E
25|$|The {{ability of}} a soapy {{solution}} {{to act as a}} detergent has been recognized for centuries. However, it is only {{at the beginning of the}} twentieth century that the constitution of such solutions was scientifically studied. Pioneering work in this area was carried out by James William McBain at the University of Bristol. As early as 1913, he postulated the existence of “colloidal ions” to explain the good electrolytic conductivity of sodium palmitate solutions. These highly mobile, spontaneously formed clusters came to be called micelles, a term borrowed from biology and popularized by G.S. Hartley in his <b>classic</b> <b>book</b> Paraffin Chain Salts: A Study in Micelle Formation.|$|E

25|$|The 1980s {{also saw}} the {{widespread}} acceptance of positioning theory. Although the theory originated with Jack Trout in 1969, it didn’t gain wide acceptance until Al Ries and Jack Trout wrote their <b>classic</b> <b>book</b> Positioning: The Battle For Your Mind (1979). The basic premise is that a strategy should not be judged by internal company factors but by the way customers see it relative to the competition. Crafting and implementing a strategy involves creating {{a position in the}} mind of the collective consumer. Several techniques enabled the practical use of positioning theory. Perceptual mapping for example, creates visual displays of the relationships between positions. Multidimensional scaling, discriminant analysis, factor analysis and conjoint analysis are mathematical techniques used to determine the most relevant characteristics (called dimensions or factors) upon which positions should be based. Preference regression can be used to determine vectors of ideal positions and cluster analysis can identify clusters of positions.|$|E
500|$|The Encyclopædia Britannica {{lists the}} same bird groups but also {{includes}} guinea fowl and squabs (young pigeons). In R. D. Crawford's Poultry breeding and genetics, squabs are omitted but Japanese quail and common pheasant {{are added to}} the list, the latter frequently being bred in captivity and released into the wild. In his 1848 <b>classic</b> <b>book</b> on poultry, Ornamental and Domestic Poultry: Their History, and Management, Edmund Dixon included chapters on the peafowl, guinea fowl, mute swan, turkey, various types of geese, the muscovy duck, other ducks and all types of chickens including bantams.|$|E
500|$|Following {{the success}} of the Joker in The Dark Knight, studio {{executives}} wished for the Riddler to be included as the primary villain as he was considered a similar character and encouraged the casting of Leonardo DiCaprio. However, Nolan wanted the antagonist to be vastly different from the previous incarnations and committed to using Bane instead, citing the need for a character with a physical presence within the film. He was initially unfamiliar with the character's back-story, but pointed out the appeal of an archetype, labelling it as [...] "the extreme of some type of villainy". When comparing the choice of Bane with the Joker, Nolan highlighted the Joker as an example of [...] "diabolical, chaotic anarchy and has a devilish sense of humor", juxtaposing him against Bane, whom he likened to [...] "a classic movie monster [...] with a terrific brain." [...] Nolan has said that his draft of the script was inspired by Charles Dickens' 1859 novel A Tale of Two Cities, which centers around the French Revolution. This homage to Dickens was briefly illustrated by having Bane inconspicuously finger knit paracord in the film, symbolizing his literary character Madame Defarge, and more overtly by Commissioner Gordon's eulogy for Bruce Wayne {{at the end of the}} film, which is taken directly from the <b>classic</b> <b>book.</b>|$|E

500|$|After Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex* (*But Were Afraid to Ask), Wilder {{began working}} on a script he called Young Frankenstein. After he wrote a two-page scenario, he called Mel Brooks, who {{told him that it}} seemed like a [...] "cute" [...] idea, but showed little interest. A few months later, Wilder {{received}} a call from his agent, Mike Medavoy, who asked if he had anything where he could include Peter Boyle and Marty Feldman, his two new clients. Having just seen Feldman on television, Wilder was inspired to write a scene that takes place at Transylvania Station, where Igor and Frederick meet for the first time. The scene was later included in the film almost verbatim. Medavoy liked the idea and called Brooks, asking him to direct. Brooks was not convinced, but having spent four years working on two box-office failures, he decided to accept. While working on the Young Frankenstein script, Wilder was offered the part of the Fox in the musical film adaptation of Saint Exupéry's <b>classic</b> <b>book,</b> The Little Prince. When filming was about to begin in London, Wilder received an urgent call from [...] Brooks, who was filming Blazing Saddles, offering Wilder the role of the [...] "Waco Kid" [...] after Dan Dailey dropped out at the last minute, while Gig Young became too ill to continue. Wilder shot his scenes for Blazing Saddles and immediately afterwards filmed The Little Prince.|$|E
