40|$|There is {{considerable}} interest in blending thermoplastic with crosslinkable monomers. The original reason for studying these blends was {{to enhance the}} toughness of the majority phase thermoplastic. However one of the relatively new ways of improving the processibility of high performance thermoplastic such as polyphenylene oxide {{involves the use of}} a <b>crosslinkable</b> <b>monomer</b> as a reactive plasticizer where the plasticizer can reduce the viscosity during the early stages of processing but polymerize and phase separate into a dispersed phase during the final stages of processing. To be effectively used as reactive plasticizer, the polymer should not form a network at an early stage of cure and should react slowly enough so as to allow adequate time for mixing at the processing temperature of the blend. Since allylic and epoxy monomers possess low polymerization rates and high gel conversions at high temperatures, this study aims at investigating their effect on the cure, rheology, processing, thermal behaviour and morphology of their blends with PPO. An initial indication of PPO solubility and miscibility with a series of allylic and DGEBA epoxy monomers was obtained by theoretical calculation of the solubility parameters of the components in the blends. Experimental studies of the uncured blends by hot-stage microscopy and DMTA suggested that blends of PPO with either allylic and epoxy monomers can undergo phase separation, depending on the temperature, when the concentration of the monomers is more than 40 wt%. Rheological studies on the miscible blends of PPO with the allylic and epoxy monomers showed a mark reduction of viscosity indicating their ability to dramatically improve the processibility of PPO. Curing studies of the allylic monomers with various organic peroxides revealed that the monomers exhibited similar cure kinetics when the same type of initiator was used while the heat of reaction depended on the initiator type. This data suggested that dicumyl peroxide, azo-tert butane and tert-butyl hydroperoxide are suitable initiators for the allylic monomers. Meanwhile, polymerization studies of pure DGEBA monomers and of DGEBA oligomer with various curing agents indicated that MCDEA has the lowest cure reaction thus the most suitable for high temperature processing and that the use of pure DGEBA only slightly reduces the reaction rate compared with the epoxy oligomer. The curing behaviour of epoxy-MCDEA in the presence of PPO indicated that the polymerization rate decreased in a monotonic pattern when the PPO concentration in the blend was raised due to a dilution effect on the reactants. A dilution effect was also observed in the cure of PPO/DAOP with DCP. However for blends PPO/DAOP with TBHP, a significant increase of polymerization rate was observed in the presence of PPO due to accelerated decomposition of TBHP to radicals by copper and cobalt impurities in the PPO. Further increases of PPO slightly reduced the rate of cure due to dilution effect but the rate was still faster than the system without PPO. Rheological properties of DGEBA-MCDEA and DAOP/DCP in the presence of PPO indicated a delayed gelation and vitrification with increasing PPO content. The variation of rheological properties during cure is affected by the PPO content and thus the morphology of the blends. The changes in the moduli/complex viscosity of PPO:DAOP/DCP is slightly different from that observed for PPO:DGEBA 340 /MCDEA. No significant inflection of the properties due to phase separation was observed in the former system and this might be due to different natures of polymerization, viz. chain growth polymerization versus step growth polymerization, respectively. The dynamic mechanical properties of the cured blends showed a slight reduction of Tg of PPO in the presence of reactive monomers but the Tgs were all above 170 °C for DAOP/DCP and 230 °C for DGEBA 340 /MCDEA respectively. SEM observations of the cured blends of indicated phase separated structure and that a bi-continuous morphology occurred at 40 wt% PPO for DAOP/DCP and 30 wt% PPO for DGEBA 340 /MCDEA, respectively. The significant reduction of viscosity in the presence of allylics or epoxy plasticizers would facilitate the dispersion and exfoliation of nanofillers in the blends matrix and would allow blending with techniques such as rotational moulding and powder coating...|$|E
40|$|AbstractA {{relatively}} {{new way to}} improve processability of thermoplastics is via the use of <b>crosslinkable</b> <b>monomers</b> which can act as reactive plasticizers and reduce the viscosity in the early stage of processing and then polymerize and phase separate during {{the final stage of}} processing thus recovering the original thermoplastics properties. This preliminary research aims to study the applicability of a range of allylic and epoxy monomers as reactive plasticizers of polyetherimide (PEI) in terms of solubility and processability of the monomers. Solubility parameters were calculated based on group additivity approach showed that only triallyl isocyanurate (TAIC) should be miscible with PEI. However, Tg of various concentrations of PEI/TAIC blends indicated immiscibility of the system in the presence of 10 wt% PEI while miscibility of the components improve with increasing PEI content. The lower Tgs of the PEI/TAIC blends compared with pure PEI suggested the improvement in processability of PEI with the presence of TAIC...|$|R
40|$|DNA {{has been}} used to guide the {{self-assembly}} of functional materials in this dissertation. Based on programmability of DNA, Y-shaped DNA (Y-DNA) and Xshaped DNA (X-DNA) were precisely labeled with fluorescence and quencher dyes. From these precise labelings, the stability of Y- and X-shaped DNA was studied by the Forster resonance energy transfer (FRET) method. In addition, the thermal stability of DNA nanostructures self-assembled from Y- and X-shaped DNA was thoroughly investigated. The nanosurface energy transfer (NSET) method was employed to monitor the conformation change of the nanostructures with nano-scale sensitivity. The effects of junctions on the thermal stability dendrimer-like DNA (DL-DNA) and DNA hydrogel were also studied with various types of FRET pair labeled building blocks. Based on the multivalency and anisotropicity of DNA nanostructures, DNAtemplated assembly of multifunctional nano-architectures was achieved. By ligation of branched DNA labeled with quantum dots, gold nanoparticles, and polyethylene glycol monoacrylate, anisotropic, branched, and <b>crosslinkable</b> <b>monomers</b> (ABC monomers) were created. Because of the precise labeling of multi-moieties on a single entity, DNA nano-architectures showed multifunctions such as optical coding, amplifying signal by polymerization, and detecting pathogen DNA. A target-driven polymerization by the ABC monomer achieved highly-sensitive pathogen detection. In addition, the polymers were used as a biocompatible multi-drug delivery vector. DNA-templated technology was applied in generating a novel functional DNA hydrogel. The formation of the gel was based on physical interactions of elongated DNA strands by rolling circle chain reaction (RCCR). Unlike traditional DNA based hydrogel, this novel DNA hydrogel was thermally stable, since it did not depend on base pairing. The new DNA hydrogel behaved like fluid but still held a specific shape and gel properties. In addition, the hydrogels showed thermoplastic property which allows hydrogel to be easily reshaped by molding and heating. With these excellent characteristics, our liquid-like DNA hydrogels were developed as an injectable extracellular matrix for tissue engineering...|$|R
40|$|A new four-step synthetic-route for {{combining}} chromophores with {{melamine resins}} {{was developed and}} practized. Despite of other melamine resins, the basis molecule of this system is the 2, 4, 6 -trichloro- 1, 3, 5 -triazine, the cyanuric chloride. In the first step the azochromophore was bonded to the s-triazine-ring. Then the residual chlorines of this triazine-chromophore were substituted by ammonia or primary amines. In the third step an aldehyde was added, leading to melamine- chromophore precondensates. For increasing the stability and the solubility of these precondensates the reactive methylolgroups were etherificated with methyl- or butylalcohol. The mass-spectra give evidence that the modified melamine precondensates are monomers and no mixture of different oligomers like else in melamine-aldehyde prepolymers. Though the result of these systems is a <b>crosslinkable</b> melamine-chromophore <b>monomer</b> which is converted in a resin by heating or under acid conditions. It is remarkable that these polymers show an excellent thermal stability with a decomposition temperature far beyond 300 °:C, a great advantage for using them a s optical materials. Resins, which build homogenous amorphous and highly transparent films, were achieved by thermal treating of the melamine-chromophore-resins. The reaction steps were monitored by online-IR-spectroscopy, which has enabled to find and optimize the reaction conditions of the syntheses steps. Furthermore the characteristic changing IR-bands and time-reaction-profiles were extracted. Concerning their usability in second order nonlinear optics the alignment of the dipoles was investigated by applying a corona discharge. Simultaneously to the poling process, the monomers were polycondensated by thermal heating. The continuously measured UV/Vis-absorptions of the poled polymer films have demonstrated that the absorption of the film have fallen within the first weeks after poling. An electric potential from 10 till 20 V could be measured during this period, indicating orientation processes of the poled films. The E/Z-switching behaviour of the azo-groups were investigated by Kelvin-Probe. The results have demonstrated that the new monomers and polymers are potential candidates for optical switching processes. The fixing of thioles on the triazine-chromophores of the first reaction step has been made successfully. E/Z-switchings of self-assembled monolayers of the azo-triazine-thioles on gold have indicated that these monolayers need {{only a few seconds}} for an isomerization process. <P...|$|R
