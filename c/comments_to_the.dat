5|$|After {{consecutive}} retirements in {{the previous}} three races which included first lap collisions in Austria and Germany, Michael Schumacher said that his objective in Hungary was to avoid any incidents on the first lap and to finish in a points-scoring position. He was also confident that Ferrari would perform well at the circuit. Barrichello revealed that he received backing from Ferrari president Luca di Montezemolo to challenge for more victories and the championship despite the latter's <b>comments</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> press about Barrichello assisting Michael Schumacher's title aspirations.|$|E
5|$|Along {{with the}} general {{administration}} of the sport, football associations and competition organisers also enforce good conduct in wider aspects of the game, dealing with issues such as <b>comments</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> press, clubs' financial management, doping, age fraud and match fixing. Most competitions enforce mandatory suspensions for players who are sent off in a game. Some on-field incidents, if considered very serious (such as allegations of racial abuse), may result in competitions deciding to impose heavier sanctions than those normally associated with a red card. Some associations allow for appeals against player suspensions incurred on-field if clubs feel a referee was incorrect or unduly harsh.|$|E
5|$|On 6 March, during United's 3–1 loss against Liverpool at Anfield, Nani {{was injured}} {{following}} a challenge from Jamie Carragher just before half-time. Nani shed tears after {{the challenge and}} was subsequently taken off the pitch in a stretcher. Following post-match <b>comments</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> press from Manchester United, it was believed Nani had suffered a broken leg. However, {{this was not the}} case as he started training the following week. It was thought Nani would miss up to three weeks as a result of this tackle and would return in April, but he recovered in time to play 61 minutes of a 2–1 victory over Marseille on 15 March.|$|E

Dolegiewicz also stated that he believed steroid use was so widespread in the throwing events that he could not name an individual who had not taken the drug. The <b>comments</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> governmental commission resulted in the loss of his Canadian shot record and his dismissal from his post at the University of Saskatchewan.

25|$|These referees each return an {{evaluation}} of the work to the publisher, noting weaknesses or problems along with suggestions for improvement. Typically, most of the referees' comments are eventually seen by the author, though a referee can also send 'for your eyes only' <b>comments</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> publisher; scientific journals observe this convention almost universally. The publisher, usually familiar with the field of the manuscript (although typically not in as much depth as the referees, who are specialists), then evaluates the referees' comments, her or his own opinion of the manuscript, and the context of the scope of the journal or level of the book and readership, before passing a decision back to the author(s), usually with the referees' comments.|$|E
25|$|During February 2015, Hamilton {{underwent}} {{shoulder surgery}} to repair the AC joint. While he was recovering, {{it was revealed that}} he had a relapse into his drug addiction, which he voluntarily reported to MLB. An outside arbitrator ruled that his voluntary admission did not violate baseball's drug policy and he could not be suspended. Despite the ruling, team owner Arte Moreno ordered all Hamilton's merchandise to be removed from the team stores and made <b>comments</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> media implying {{that he did not want}} Hamilton back on the team. The players union and several Angels players spoke up in Hamilton's defense. The Angels began to layout a rehab plan for him, but shortly afterwards reports surfaced that the Angels were looking to trade Hamilton.|$|E

25|$|In response, AET {{once again}} criticsed OFSTED, {{saying that the}} Ofsted judgements were unfairly {{negative}} and that many of its schools {{had a history of}} poor performance and would require time to turn round. Ian Comfort the CEO also directly queried the professionalism of OFSTED by claiming that OFSTED had unfairly turned the 'generally positive oral feedback' given at the time of inspections, into 'far more negative statements' in the final OFSTED letter which criticised standards at AET. In <b>comments</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Parliamentary Select Committee Ian Comfort also queried the appropriateness of having both OFSTED and the DfE involved in inspecting school standards as it put 'unnecessary pressure' on AET schools. In contrast to Ian Comfort other CEO's of Multi Academy Trusts, such as Dame Rachel de Souza have publicly stated that they are very happy with how the DfE and OFSTED work together to hold schools accountable.|$|E
25|$|There is {{some debate}} {{about whether or not}} Ibn al-Nafis participated in {{dissection}} to come to his conclusions about pulmonary circulation. Although he states in his writings that he was prevented from practicing dissection because of his beliefs, other scholars have noted that al-Nafis must have either practiced dissection or seen a human heart in order to come to his conclusions. According to one view, his knowledge about the human heart could have been derived from surgical operations rather than dissection. Other comments found in al-Nafis’s writings such as dismissing earlier observations with a reference to dissection as proof, however, support the view that he practiced dissection in order to come to his conclusions about the human heart and pulmonary circulation. Ibn al-Nafis’s <b>comments</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> contrary and the alternate explanations, however, keep his possible practice of dissection in question.|$|E
