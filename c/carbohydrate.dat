5|$|Carbohydrates are {{classified}} {{according to their}} glycemic index, a system for measuring how quickly a food that is eaten raises blood sugar levels, and glycemic load, which takes into account both the glycemic index {{and the amount of}} <b>carbohydrate</b> in the food. This has led to <b>carbohydrate</b> counting, a method used by diabetics for planning their meals.|$|E
5|$|Surfactant protein A (SP-A) is {{a protein}} of 248 amino acids usually found in large {{oligomeric}} structures. The mature SP-A1 monomer is a 35kDa protein that differs from SP-A2 in four amino acids at the coding region. The structure of SP-A1 monomers {{consists of four}} domains: an N-terminal, a collagen-like domain, a neck region, and a <b>carbohydrate</b> recognition domain. The C-terminal <b>carbohydrate</b> recognition domain (CRD) allows binding to various types of microorganisms and molecules.|$|E
2500|$|Studies {{have shown}} that {{learning}} and memory improve after consuming <b>carbohydrates.</b> There {{are two kinds of}} <b>carbohydrates</b> that you can consume, simple and complex. [...] Simple <b>carbohydrates</b> are often found in processed foods and release sugar into the bloodstream quickly after consumption. [...] Complex <b>carbohydrates</b> are digested more slowly and therefore cause sugar to be released into the bloodstream more slowly. [...] Good sources of complex <b>carbohydrates</b> are whole-grain breads, pasta, brown rice, oatmeal, and potatoes. [...] It is recommended that you consume more complex <b>carbohydrates</b> because consuming complex <b>carbohydrates</b> will cause the level of sugar in your bloodstream to be more stable which will cause less stress hormones to be released. [...] Consuming simple <b>carbohydrates</b> may cause the levels of sugar in your bloodstream to rise and fall which can cause mood swings.|$|R
25|$|The {{function}} of <b>carbohydrates</b> includes energy storage and providing structure. Sugars are <b>carbohydrates,</b> {{but not all}} <b>carbohydrates</b> are sugars. There are more <b>carbohydrates</b> on Earth than any other known type of biomolecule; {{they are used to}} store energy and genetic information, as well as play important roles in cell to cell interactions and communications.|$|R
50|$|The {{nutrition}} plan {{is composed}} of three phases. The first 30 days emphasize higher protein and lower <b>carbohydrates.</b> The second phase increases the percentages of <b>carbohydrates.</b> The third phase further increases the <b>carbohydrates.</b>|$|R
5|$|The {{ketogenic}} diet {{is calculated}} by a dietitian for each child. Age, weight, activity levels, culture and food preferences all affect the meal plan. First, the energy requirements are set at 80–90% of the recommended daily amounts (RDA) for the child's age (the high-fat diet requires less energy to process than a typical high-carbohydrate diet). Highly active children {{or those with}} muscle spasticity require more calories than this; immobile children require less. The ketogenic ratio of the diet compares the weight of fat to the combined weight of <b>carbohydrate</b> and protein. This is typically 4:1, but children who are younger than 18months, older than 12years, or who are obese may be started on a 3:1 ratio. Fat is energy-rich, with 9kcal/g (38kJ/g) compared to 4kcal/g (17kJ/g) for <b>carbohydrate</b> or protein, so portions on the ketogenic diet are smaller than normal. The quantity of fat in the diet can be calculated from the overall energy requirements and the chosen ketogenic ratio. Next, the protein levels are set to allow for growth and body maintenance, and are around 1g protein for each kg of body weight. Lastly, the amount of <b>carbohydrate</b> is set according to what allowance is left while maintaining the chosen ratio. Any <b>carbohydrate</b> in medications or supplements must be subtracted from this allowance. The total daily amount of fat, protein and <b>carbohydrate</b> is then evenly divided across the meals.|$|E

5|$|At {{the initial}} consultation, {{patients}} are screened for conditions that may contraindicate the diet. A dietary history is obtained and {{the parameters of}} the diet selected: the ketogenic ratio of fat to combined protein and <b>carbohydrate,</b> the calorie requirements and the fluid intake.|$|E
50|$|What has not {{generally}} {{been included in}} diabetic diet recommendations is the variation in effect from different <b>carbohydrates.</b> It has been recommended that <b>carbohydrates</b> eaten by people with diabetes should be complex <b>carbohydrates.</b>|$|R
2500|$|Traditionally, simple <b>carbohydrates</b> are {{believed}} to be absorbed quickly, and therefore to raise blood-glucose levels more rapidly than complex <b>carbohydrates.</b> This, however, is not accurate. Some simple <b>carbohydrates</b> (e.g., fructose) follow different metabolic pathways (e.g., fructolysis) that result in only a partial catabolism to glucose, while, in essence, many complex <b>carbohydrates</b> may be digested {{at the same rate as}} simple <b>carbohydrates.</b> [...] The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that added sugars should represent no more than 10% of total energy intake.|$|R
40|$|<b>Carbohydrates</b> are a {{major source}} of energy in the diet. Classified {{according}} to their chemistry, <b>carbohydrates</b> can be divided into sugars (monosaccharides and disaccharides), polyols, oligosaccharides (malto-oligosaccharides and non-digestible oligosaccharides) and polysaccharides (starch and non-starch polysaccharides). However, this classification does not allow a simple translation into nutritional effects since each class of <b>carbohydrates</b> has overlapping physiological properties and effects on health. <b>Carbohydrates</b> can also be classified according to their digestion and absorption in the human small intestine. Digestible <b>carbohydrates</b> are absorbed and digested in the small intestine; non-digestible <b>carbohydrates</b> are resistant to hydrolysis in the small intestine and reach the large intestine where they are at least partially fermented by the commensal bacteria present in the colon. There is no universal definition of the term ‘dietary fibre’; broadly speaking, it refers to {{some or all of the}} constituents of non-digestible <b>carbohydrates</b> and may also include other quantitatively minor components (e. g. lignin) that are associated with non-digestible <b>carbohydrates</b> in plant cell walls. ...|$|R

50|$|Maltose is a {{biomolecule}} {{that belongs}} {{to the group of}} <b>carbohydrates</b> within the division of biomolecules into the three main groups: <b>carbohydrates,</b> lipids and proteins. <b>Carbohydrates</b> are composed of carbon, oxygen and hydrogen C, O, H and are either polyhydroxyaldehydes or polyhydroxyketones.|$|R
5|$|Carbohydrates are {{aldehydes}} or ketones, {{with many}} hydroxyl groups attached, that can exist as straight chains or rings. Carbohydrates {{are the most}} abundant biological molecules, and fill numerous roles, such as the storage and transport of energy (starch, glycogen) and structural components (cellulose in plants, chitin in animals). The basic <b>carbohydrate</b> units are called monosaccharides and include galactose, fructose, and most importantly glucose. Monosaccharides can be linked together to form polysaccharides in almost limitless ways.|$|E
5|$|Carbohydrates make up {{the bulk}} of the fruit bodies, {{comprising}} 9.23% of the fresh weight (see table), and 65.4% of the dry weight. The <b>carbohydrate</b> component contains the monosaccharides glucose, mannitol and α,α-trehalose, the polysaccharide glycogen, and the water-insoluble structural polysaccharide chitin, which accounts for up to 80–90% of dry matter in mushroom cell walls. Chitin, hemicellulose, and pectin-like carbohydrates—all indigestible by humans—contribute to the nutritionally desirable high proportion of insoluble fibre in B.edulis.|$|E
5|$|Cassava {{chips are}} a common food in much of Africa, {{including}} the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ghana and Malawi. In Ghana, cassava chips are called konkonte. Dried cassava chips are also used to supplement the <b>carbohydrate</b> content of livestock feed in Ghana. In Malawi, cassava chips are prepared by soaking cassava, slicing it, and then letting it dry. This is the primary means by which cassava is transported to markets from production areas.|$|E

50|$|<b>Carbohydrates</b> are {{molecular}} {{substances that}} include sugars, starches, gums and celluloses. Most of the <b>carbohydrates</b> that {{are incorporated into}} aquatic diets are of plant origin and are sources of the enzyme amylase. <b>Carbohydrates,</b> however, are not a superior energy source for fish over protein or fat but digestible <b>carbohydrates</b> do spare protein for tissue building. Unlike in mammals, glycogen is not a significant storage depot of energy in fish.|$|R
30|$|Using 0.1 N HCl for acid hydrolysis, {{the amount}} of <b>carbohydrates</b> {{extracted}} in the acid hydrolysate and in the alkaline extract is similar. In {{the rest of the}} cases, the acid hydrolysate accounts for most of the extracted <b>carbohydrates.</b> The amount of <b>carbohydrates</b> in the KOH extract is irrelevant.|$|R
5|$|In animals, {{when there}} is an {{oversupply}} of dietary <b>carbohydrate,</b> the excess <b>carbohydrate</b> is converted to triglycerides. This involves the synthesis of fatty acids from acetyl-CoA and the esterification of fatty acids in the production of triglycerides, a process called lipogenesis. Fatty acids are made by fatty acid synthases that polymerize and then reduce acetyl-CoA units. The acyl chains in the fatty acids are extended by a cycle of reactions that add the acetyl group, reduce it to an alcohol, dehydrate it to an alkene group and then reduce it again to an alkane group. The enzymes of fatty acid biosynthesis are divided into two groups, in animals and fungi all these fatty acid synthase reactions are carried out by a single multifunctional protein, while in plant plastids and bacteria separate enzymes perform each step in the pathway. The fatty acids may be subsequently converted to triglycerides that are packaged in lipoproteins and secreted from the liver.|$|E
5|$|In the 1960s, it was {{discovered}} that medium-chain triglycerides (MCTs) produce more ketone bodies per unit of energy than normal dietary fats (which are mostly long-chain triglycerides). MCTs are more efficiently absorbed and are rapidly transported to the liver via the hepatic portal system rather than the lymphatic system. The severe <b>carbohydrate</b> restrictions of the classic ketogenic diet made it difficult for parents to produce palatable meals that their children would tolerate. In 1971, Peter Huttenlocher devised a ketogenic diet where about 60% of the calories came from the MCT oil, and this allowed more protein and up to three times as much <b>carbohydrate</b> as the classic ketogenic diet. The oil was mixed with at least twice its volume of skimmed milk, chilled, and sipped during the meal or incorporated into food. He tested it on twelve children and adolescents with intractable seizures. Most children improved in both seizure control and alertness, results that were similar to the classic ketogenic diet. Gastrointestinal upset was a problem, which led one patient to abandon the diet, but meals were easier to prepare and better accepted by the children. The MCT diet replaced the classic ketogenic diet in many hospitals, though some devised diets that were a combination of the two.|$|E
5|$|In {{the form}} {{trivalent}} chromium, Cr(III), or Cr3+, chromium {{was identified as}} an essential nutrient in the late 1950s and later accepted as a trace element for its roles in the action of insulin, a hormone critical to the metabolism and storage of <b>carbohydrate,</b> fat and protein. The precise mechanism of its actions in the body, however, have not been fully defined, leaving in question whether chromium is essential for healthy people.|$|E
5000|$|The term [...] "low-carbohydrate diet" [...] is {{generally}} applied to diets that restrict <b>carbohydrates</b> {{to less than}} 20% of caloric intake, but can also refer to diets that simply restrict or limit <b>carbohydrates</b> to less than recommended proportions (generally less than 45% of total energy coming from <b>carbohydrates).</b>|$|R
40|$|A first {{prospection}} {{was made}} of the content and identity of the <b>carbohydrates</b> in Chilean soils. Seven volcanic and two alluvial soils were selected. Determinations, by the Anthrone method, were done of free <b>carbohydrates</b> and, after acid hydrolylis of the soil, of total <b>carbohydrates.</b> Total carbohyfrates turned out to be greater in volcanic than in alluvial soils; their amount is high in relation to that appearing in the literature, and it correlated closely with the O.

5|$|Infants and {{patients}} fed via a gastrostomy tube {{can also be}} given a ketogenic diet. Parents make up a prescribed powdered formula, such as KetoCal, into a liquid feed. Gastrostomy feeding avoids any issues with palatability, and bottle-fed infants readily accept the ketogenic formula. Some studies have found this liquid feed to be more efficacious and associated with lower total cholesterol than a solid ketogenic diet. KetoCal is a nutritionally complete food containing milk protein and is supplemented with amino acids, fat, <b>carbohydrate,</b> vitamins, minerals and trace elements. It is used to administer the 4:1 ratio classic ketogenic diet in children over one year. The formula is available in both 3:1 and 4:1 ratios, either unflavoured or in an artificially sweetened vanilla flavour and is suitable for tube or oral feeding. Other formula products include KetoVolve and Ketonia. Alternatively, a liquid ketogenic diet may be produced by combining Ross <b>Carbohydrate</b> Free soy formula with Microlipid and Polycose.|$|E
5|$|Liver {{function}} {{tests can}} show {{a combination of}} results indicative of bile duct obstruction (raised conjugated bilirubin, γ-glutamyl transpeptidase and alkaline phosphatase levels). CA19-9 (<b>carbohydrate</b> antigen 19.9) is a tumor marker that is frequently elevated in pancreatic cancer. However, it lacks sensitivity and specificity, not least because 5% of people lack the Lewis (a) antigen and cannot produce CA19-9. It has a sensitivity of 80% and specificity of 73% in detecting pancreatic adenocarcinoma, and is used for following known cases rather than diagnosis.|$|E
