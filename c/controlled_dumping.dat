40|$|Abstract: Pilot scale {{simulation}} of {{young and old}} landfills was done by operating lysimeters filled with two types of substrate, viz., segregated fraction of fresh Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) and MSW mined from open dumpsite with periodic monitoring of leachate quality. For each substrate, one lysimeter was operated as a bioreactor and the other as a <b>controlled</b> <b>dump</b> with and without leachate recirculation, respectively, under dry weather {{for a period of}} 10 months. Densities of 652 - 825 kg/m 3 could be achieved initially due to higher levels of moisture (60 %) in fresh MSW and inerts (70 %) in mined MSW. Inspite of such compaction during waste placement, bioreactor technology aids in leachate management, {{especially in the case of}} young landfills. The prospective benefits of bioreactor option for young landfills was evident from the reduction in COD (86 %), BOD (82 %), DOC (85 %) and volatile solids (75 %) in leachates. Leachates from young landfill bioreactor exhibited characteristics comparable to that of leachates from old landfills in 6 months of operation. However, auxiliary treatment of leachate is required for removal of inhibitors like ammonia and refractory components like chlorides which accumulate during the process.

Young and old landfills were simulated by filling lysimeters with a segregated fraction of fresh municipal solid waste (MSW) and MSW mined from an open dump site, respectively, and periodically monitoring leachate quantity and quality and biogas quality. For each substrate, one lysimeter was operated as a bioreactor with leachate recirculation and another lysimeter was operated as a <b>controlled</b> <b>dump,</b> {{for a period of}} 10 months.

The benefits of leachate recirculation in the young landfill lysimeter were evident from the significant decrease in chemical oxygen demand (COD) (86), biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) (82), dissolved organic carbon (DOC) (85), and volatile solids (75) in leachates. However, ammonia nitrogen (amm-N) and chlorides in the leachates accumulated in bioreactor landfills.
