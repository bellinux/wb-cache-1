The sample of the study consisted of 48 students randomly chosen from King Saud University- College of languages and Translation-and assigned to experimental and control groups of 24 students each. Data {{of the study were}} <b>collected</b> <b>within</b> <b>two</b> <b>months</b> period via a pre-posttest design for equivalent groups. The control group was taught by the regular teacher with the direct administration of the researchers, however, the experiment group was taught by the researchers. The researchers assessed the effect of the extensive reading program on the writing performance of the Saudi EFL university students. Results showed that the experiment group outperformed the control group on the measure. This indicated that the extensive reading program may have a significant positive effect on learners ' writing performance...|$|E
40|$|Fetal microchimerism {{has been}} {{suggested}} to play contradictory roles in women’s health, with factors including age of the recipient, time elapsed since microchimerism occurred, and microchimeric cell type modulating disease. Both beneficial and harmful effects {{have been identified in}} wound healing and tissue regeneration, immune mediated disease, and cancer. This area of research is relatively new, and hindered by the time course from occurrence of fetal microchimerism to the multi-factorial development of disease. Dogs represent an excellent model for study of fetal microchimerism, as they share our environment, have a naturally condensed lifespan, and spontaneously develop immune-mediated diseases and cancers similar to their human counterparts. However, fetal microchimerism has not been described in dogs. These experiments sought preliminary evidence that dogs develop fetal microchimerism following pregnancy. We hypothesized that Y chromosomal DNA would be detected in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells of female dogs <b>collected</b> <b>within</b> <b>two</b> <b>months</b> of parturition. We further hypothesized that Y chromosomal DNA would be detected in banked whole blood DNA samples from parous female Golden Retrievers with at least one male puppy in a prior litter. Amplification of DNA extracted from five female Golden Retrievers that had whelped within the two months prior to collection revealed strong positive bands for the Y chromosome. Of banked, parous samples, 36 % yielded positive bands for the Y chromosome. This is the first report of persistent Y chromosomal DNA in post-partum female dogs and these results suggest that fetal microchimeris...|$|E

This study aimed to investigate the prevalence and clinical impact of NTM in pulmonary tuberculosis patients. MethodsWe retrospectively reviewed data of patients with culture-confirmed pulmonary tuberculosis from 2000 to 2006. Those in whom NTM were isolated from respiratory specimens <b>collected</b> <b>within</b> <b>two</b> <b>months</b> before and nine months after the index culture of tuberculosis was plated were compared with those without NTM. Patients were followed for one year after initiation of anti-tuberculous treatment. ResultsAmong 2133 patients with pulmonary tuberculosis, 48 (2. 3 %) with multiple and 106 (5. 0 %) with one isolate(s) of NTM were identified. Another 144 without NTM were selected and compared. The one-year mortality rates were similar among three groups. Patients with multiple NTM isolates {{were more likely to}} be symptomatic, sought medical help earlier, had smear-positive respiratory specimens, and received anti-tuberculous treatment later than those with single/no isolate(s). Cavities were more commonly visualized radiographically in patients with multiple/single NTM isolate(s) than those without NTM isolates. The mean duration of anti-tuberculous treatment was 8. 8 months for patients with multiple NTM isolates, significantly longer than that in patients with single (7. 6 months) and no NTM isolate(s) (7. 5 months). ConclusionsNTM were present in the respiratory tract of 7. 3 % of patients with pulmonary tuberculosis. Although the outcomes were similar, the presence of NTM was associated with different clinical manifestations and had a significant impact on the treatment of tuberculosis...|$|E

40|$|Objectives: Abacavir and {{nevirapine}} drug hypersensitivity {{reactions are}} common causes for early discontinuation of both drugs in patients initiating antiretroviral therapy. Rapid and severe reactions on rechallenge and associations with HLA alleles support {{the involvement of}} immunogenetic mechanisms for both these syndromes. The ELISpot assay detects antigen-induced IFN-g responses within 24 - 48 hours after blood collection. Our study investigated {{the use of the}} ELISpot assay to detect abacavir- and nevirapine- induced IFN-g responses in HIV-infected patients who had previously experienced a clinically diagnosed hypersensitivity reaction. Methods: Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells isolated from six HIV-infected patients with a previous abacavir hypersensitivity reaction (6 / 6 HLA-B* 5701), ten patients with a previous nevirapine hypersensitivity reaction (8 / 10 HLA-DR* 01) characterized by fever, rash or hepatitis within 8 weeks of initiating the drug, healthy controls and drug tolerant patients were also included in the IFN-g ELISpot assay (n= 10). Results: Anti-CD 3 -induced IFN-g responses were detected in samples from all HIV-infected patients. Abacavir-induced IFN-g responses were detected in two patients with abacavir hypersensitivity (105 and 490 spot forming units/million cells respectively) and three sequential samples from a patient with nevirapine hypersensitivity (245, 195 and 710 spot forming units/million cells). Two of three patients with positive drug-induced IFN-g responses had samples <b>collected</b> <b>within</b> <b>two</b> <b>months</b> of experiencing their hypersensitivity reaction. No drug-induced IFN-g responses were detected in samples from tolerant patients or healthy controls. Conclusions: The ELISpot assay is a novel technique for exploring the immunopathogenesis of abacavir and nevirapine associated hypersensitivity. While numerous pharmacological and immunological explanations exist for negative responses, longitudinal follow up of positive responses and CD 4 + and CD 8 + T cell depletion studies will give further insight into the mechanism of abacavir and nevirapine immune mediated hypersensitivity...|$|E
