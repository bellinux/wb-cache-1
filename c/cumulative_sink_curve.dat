A sample of 0. 5 kg of Maiganga coal was poured into a solution of zinc chloride having different densities of 1. 00, 1. 10, 1. 20, 1. 30, 1. 40, 1. 50, 1. 60, 1. 70, 1. 80, 1. 90 and 2. 00. The floats and sinks {{in each of these}} densities were obtained and used to calculate the <b>cumulative</b> float, <b>cumulative</b> <b>sink,</b> instantaneous ash and distribution of ash; these values were then used to develop the respective partition curves (washability curve) which were obtained by plotting the partition coefficient against the mean of its density range. A sink - float problem was tested using the partition curves obtained. A yield of 80 % was considered where the clean coal contains 16. 45 % ash with rejects of 70. 18 % ash separated at a specific gravity of 1. 7. The separation with a distribution value of 5 % becomes easy according to Burt (2004), Herbst (2005), Mills (2008) and Bird (2001) that if a low value less than 10 % for the distribution is recorded, the separation becomes easy, while a value more than 20 % gives a very difficult separation...|$|R

50|$|The {{residing}} magma {{starts to}} cool, {{with the higher}} melting point components such as olivine crystallizing out of the solution, particularly near to the cooler walls of the chamber, and forming a denser conglomerate of minerals which <b>sinks</b> (<b>cumulative</b> rock). Upon cooling, new mineral phases saturate and the rock type changes (e.g. fractional crystallization), typically forming gabbro, diorite, tonalite and granite or gabbro, diorite, syenite and granite. If magma resides in a chamber for a long period, then it can become stratified with lower density components rising {{to the top and}} denser materials sinking. Rocks accumulate in layers, forming a layered intrusion. Any subsequent eruption may produce distinctly layered deposits, for example the deposits from the 79 AD eruption of Mount Vesuvius include a thick layer of white pumice from the upper portion of the magma chamber overlaid with a similar layer of grey pumice produced from material erupted later from lower down in the chamber.|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Understanding and {{quantifying}} carbon (C) {{exchanges between}} the biosphere and the atmosphere—specifically {{the process of}} C removal from the atmosphere, and how this process is changing—is the basis for developing appropriate adaptation and mitigation strategies for climate change. Monitoring forest systems and reporting on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and removals are now required components of international efforts aimed at mitigating rising atmospheric GHG. Spatially-explicit information about forests can improve the estimates of GHG emissions and removals. However, at present, remotely-sensed information on forest change is not commonly integrated into GHG reporting systems. New, detailed (30 -m spatial resolution) forest change products derived from satellite time series informing on location, magnitude, and type of change, at an annual time step, have recently become available. Here we estimate the forest GHG balance using these new Landsat-based change data, a spatial forest inventory, and develop yield curves as inputs to the Carbon Budget Model of the Canadian Forest Sector (CBM-CFS 3) to estimate GHG emissions and removals at a 30  m resolution for a 13  Mha pilot area in Saskatchewan, Canada. Results Our results depict the forests as <b>cumulative</b> C <b>sink</b> (17. 98  Tg C or 0. 64  Tg C year− 1) between 1984 and 2012 with an average C density of 206. 5 (± 0. 6) Mg C ha− 1. Comparisons between our estimates and estimates from Canada’s National Forest Carbon Monitoring, Accounting and Reporting System (NFCMARS) were possible only on a subset of our study area. In our simulations the area was a C sink, while the official reporting simulations, it was a C source. Forest area and overall C stock estimates also differ between the two simulated estimates. Conclusions Both estimates have similar uncertainties, but the spatially-explicit results we present here better quantify the potential improvement brought on by spatially-explicit modelling. We discuss {{the source of the}} differences between these estimates. This study represents an important first step towards the integration of spatially-explicit information into Canada’s NFCMARS...|$|R
40|$|Three {{chemical}} tracer experiments and one extended injection of fluid low in concentration of dissolved {{species have been}} carried out during the Long Term Flow Test (LTFT) of the Fenton Hill Hot Dry Rock (HDR) reservoir. The tracer tests results illustrate the dynamic nature of the flow system, with more fluid traveling through longer residence time paths as heat is extracted. The total fracture volumes calculated from these tests allow us to determine the fate of unrecovered injection fluid, examine the pressure-dependence of fracture volume, and, through a comparison to the hydraulic performance, postulate a model for the nature of the pressure drops through the system. The Fresh Water Flush (FWF) test showed that while no dissolved specie behavior is truly conservative (no sources or <b>sinks),</b> several breakthrough <b>curves</b> are well explained with a pore fluid displacement model. Other dissolved components are clearly influenced by dissolution or precipitation reactions. Finally, the transient response of the chemistry during the FWF to an increase in production well pressure showed that some fractures connected to the production well preferentially open when pressure is raised...|$|R

Please cite this article as doi: 10. 1111 /gcbb. 12323 A 6 -ha field at Aberystwyth, UK, was converted in 2012 from semi-improved grassland to Miscanthus x giganteus for biomass production; results from transition {{to the end of}} the first 3 years are presented here. An eddy covariance sensor mast was established from year one with a second mast added from year two, improving coverage and providing replicated measurements of CO 2 exchange between the ecosystem and atmosphere. Using a simple mass balance approach, above-ground and below-ground biomass production are combined with partitioned CO 2 fluxes to estimate short-term carbon deltas across individual years. Years one and two both ended with the site as a net source of carbon following cultivation disturbances, cumulative NEE by the end of year two was 138. 57 ? 16. 91 g C m? 2. The site became a <b>cumulative</b> net <b>sink</b> for carbon by the end of June in the third growing season and remained so for the rest of that year; NEE by the end of year three was ? 616. 52 ? 39. 39 g C m? 2. Carbon gains were primarily found in biomass pools, and SOC losses were limited to years one (? 1. 43 Mg C ha? 1 yr? 1) and two (? 3. 75 Mg C ha? 1 yr? 1). Year three saw recoupment of soil carbon at 0. 74 Mg C ha? 1 yr? 1 with a further estimate of 0. 78 Mg C ha? 1 incorporated through litter inputs over the 3 years, suggesting a net loss of SOC at 3. 7 Mg ha? 1 from a 0 - to 30 -cm baseline of 78. 61 ? 3. 28 Mg ha? 1, down 4. 7 %. Assuming this sequestration rate as a minimum would suggest replacement of cultivation losses of SOC by year 8 of a potential 15 - to 20 -year crop. Potential coal replacement per hectare of harvest over the three-year study would offset 6 ? 8 Mg of carbon emission, more than double the SOC losses. publishersversionPeer reviewe...|$|R
50|$|The {{effect of}} wind, lift and sink on {{best glide speed}} is to move the curve within the plot {{by the amount of}} each component. That is, if flying into a headwind, with no {{vertical}} air movement, the curve would move left toward the origin by an amount equal to the velocity of the wind. The effect is the tangent line for best glide speed moves further down the graph for an increasing best glide speed but a lower best glide ratio. Thus, when flying into a head wind, the best glide speed is higher but the best glide ratio is lower. Conversely, for a tail wind, the polar curve moves away from the origin so that best glide speed is lower and the effective glide ratio is improved. In lift, move the curve up for a lower best glide speed and better glide ratio. In <b>sink,</b> move the <b>curve</b> down for a higher best glide speed and a worse glide ratio. The effect is that when flying between thermals, you would slow down in rising air and speed up when encountering sink. Wind with lift/sink would simply move the plot the according amount for each component.|$|R
40|$|The {{importance}} {{and consequences of}} extreme events on the global carbon budget are inadequately understood. This includes the differential impact of extreme events on various ecosystem components, lag effects, recovery times, and compensatory processes. In the summer of 2007 in Barrow, Arctic Alaska, there were unusually high air temperatures (the fifth warmest summer over a 65 -year period) and record low precipitation (the lowest over a 65 -year period). These abnormal conditions were associated with substantial desiccation of the Sphagnum layer and a reduced net Sphagnum CO 2 sink but did not affect net ecosystem exchange (NEE) from this wet-sedge arctic tundra ecosystem. Microbial biomass, NH 4 + availability, gross primary production (GPP), and ecosystem respiration (R eco) were generally greater during this extreme summer. The cumulative ecosystem CO 2 sink in 2007 {{was similar to the}} previous summers, suggesting that vascular plants were able to compensate for Sphagnum CO 2 uptake, despite the impact on other functions and structure such as desiccation of the Sphagnum layer. Surprisingly, the lowest ecosystem CO 2 sink over a five summer record (2005 – 2009) was observed during the 2008 summer (~ 70 % lower), directly following the unusually warm and dry summer, rather than during the extreme summer. This sink reduction cannot solely be attributed to the potential damage to mosses, which typically contribute ~ 40 % of the entire ecosystem CO 2 sink. Importantly, the return to a substantial <b>cumulative</b> CO 2 <b>sink</b> occurred two summers after the extreme event, which suggests a substantial resilience of this tundra ecosystem to at least an isolated extreme event. Overall, these results show a complex response of the CO 2 sink and its sub-components to atypically warm and dry conditions. The impact of multiple extreme events requires further investigation...|$|R
40|$|Author(s) 2015. The average {{depth in}} the ocean at which the {{majority}} of sinking organic matter particles remineralise is a fundamental parameter {{in the ocean}}'s role in regulating atmospheric CO 2. Observed spatial patterns in sinking fluxes and relationships between the fluxes of different particles in the modern ocean have widely been used to invoke controlling mechanisms with important implications for CO 2 regulation. However, such analyses are limited by the sparse spatial sampling of the available sediment trap data. Here we explore whether model ocean circulation rates, {{in the form of}} a transport matrix, can be used to derive remineralisation rates and infer <b>sinking</b> particle flux <b>curves</b> from the much more highly resolved observations of dissolved nutrient concentrations. Initially we show an example of the method using a transport matrix from the MITgcm model and demonstrate that there are a number of potential uncertainties associated with the method. We then use the Earth system model GENIE to generate a synthetic tracer data set to explore the method and its sensitivity to key sources of uncertainty arising from errors in the tracer observations and in the model circulation. We use a 54 -member ensemble of different, but plausible, estimates of the modern circulation to explore errors associated with model transport rates. We find that reconstructed re-mineralisation rates are very sensitive to both errors in observations and model circulation rates, such that a simple inversion cannot provide a robust estimate of particulate flux profiles. Estimated remineralisation rates are particularly sensitive to differences between the "observed" and modelled circulation because remineralisation rates are 3 - 4 magnitudes smaller than transport rates. We highlight a potential method of constraining the uncertainty associated with using modelled circulation rates, although its success is limited by the observations currently available. Finally, we show that there are additional uncertainties when inferring particle flux curves from reliable estimates of remineralisation rates due to processes that are not restricted to the vertical water column transport, such as the cycling of dissolved organic matter...|$|R
40|$|Inspired by microchannels {{networks}} in biological systems, microvascular composites {{are being used}} for various applications including active cooling, autonomic healing, and sensing. The recent development of a manufacturing technique for microvascular composites based on a sacrificial fiber approach has enabled the creation of complex networks of microchannels embedded in composite parts [1]. Motivated by these recent improvements in manufacturing of microvascular composites, we study design of an actively cooled composite plate. We {{examine the impact of}} microchannels configuration on the thermal response of the microvascular composite. Here, the composite plate is subjected to a heat flux that causes a high surface temperature {{in the absence of the}} active cooling by microchannels. The objective of this study is to determine the optimal configuration of the microchannels to maximize the thermal efficiency of microchannels to keep the domain temperature below a critical temperature value. We present a new gradient-based Isogeometric Interface-enriched Generalized Finite Element Method (IIGFEM) [2 – 4] optimization scheme that allows for the accurate and efficient extraction of the sensitivity of objective functions and constraints on the design parameters that define the geometry of the microchannels. At the heart of the modeling effort, the IIGFEM allows for the very accurate and efficient capture of the thermal impact of the embedded microchannel network on the thermal field in the composite part. Because the microchannels diameters are typically much smaller than other characteristic dimensions of the problem, we model microchannels as line (or <b>curve)</b> <b>sinks.</b> The IIGFEM solver allows for the capture of curved and branched microchannels over a mesh that does not conform to the geometry of the microchannels. One of the key challenges associated with the conventional finite element-based shape optimization of microvascular composites is the large mesh distortion that often takes place during the optimization process, as the finite element mesh must conform to the evolving microstructural elements. This mesh distortion may affect the accuracy of the optimum solution. Because of the stationary nature of the nonconforming mesh used by the IIGFEM, the issue of mesh distortion disappears. In this study, we adopt an isogeometric IGFEM-based adjoint shape sensitivity approach, which is simplified by the fact that only the enrichment (interface) nodes move, appear or disappear during the shape optimization process. To demonstrate the performance of the method, a set of microstructural shape optimization problems for the design of microvascular composites are presented...|$|R
