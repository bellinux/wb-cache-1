50|$|In 1995 one non-academic source erroneously {{suggested}} that Neumann <b>cutting</b> <b>lathes</b> applied a single high-frequency pole at 3.18 µs (50 kHz) {{and that a}} complementary zero should therefore be included upon playback. However, no such pole exists.|$|R
50|$|Georg Neumann GmbH (Neumann), {{founded in}} 1928 and based in Berlin, Germany, is a {{prominent}} manufacturer of professional recording microphones.

50|$|A {{technological}} spin-off from the short-lived TeD video system was Teldec's Direct Metal Mastering technology, called DMM, for the manufacturing of vinyl records: The <b>cutting</b> <b>lathe</b> engraves the audio signal groove {{directly into a}} copper-plated master disc, instead of a lacquer-plated aluminium disc.|$|E
50|$|While Linn {{engineers}} were testing their flagship product, the Sondek LP12 turntable, they became frustrated {{with some of}} the specialist test LPs they were using. Work began on an LP <b>cutting</b> <b>lathe</b> as a research product to improve testing for the LP12.|$|E
50|$|Transcription or {{recording}} lathes {{are used}} to make grooves on a surface for recording sounds. These were used in creating sound grooves on wax cylinders and then on flat recording discs. Originally the <b>cutting</b> <b>lathes</b> were driven by sound vibrations through a horn and then later driven by electric current, when microphones were used in recording. Many of these were professional models, {{but there were some}} used for home recording and were popular before the advent of home tape recording.|$|R
5000|$|The company's first tape recorder, the Ampex Model 200, {{was first}} shipped in April 1948. The first two units, serial numbers 1 and 2, {{were used to}} record the Bing Crosby Show. [...] The American Broadcasting Company used these {{recorders}} along with 3M Scotch 111 gamma ferric oxide coated acetate tape for the first-ever U.S. delayed radio broadcast of The Bing Crosby Show. Ampex tape recorders revolutionized the radio and recording industries because of their superior audio quality and ease of operation over audio disk <b>cutting</b> <b>lathes.</b>|$|R
50|$|Turning {{operations}} are operations that rotate the workpiece {{as the primary}} method of moving metal against the <b>cutting</b> tool. <b>Lathes</b> are the principal machine tool used in turning.|$|R
50|$|A {{critical}} factor in making interchangeable metal parts was the invention of several machine tools, such as the slide rest lathe, screw <b>cutting</b> <b>lathe,</b> turret lathe, milling machine and metal planer. One {{of the most important}} and versatile of these machine tools was David Wilkinson's lathe, for which he received a $10,000 award from the government of the United States.|$|E
50|$|Modern {{systems have}} far wider {{potential}} bandwidth. An essential feature of all cutting lathes—including the Neumann cutting lathes—is a forcibly imposed high frequency roll-off above the audio band (>20 kHz). This implies {{two or more}} additional time constants to those defined by the RIAA curve. This is not standardized anywhere, but set by the maker of the <b>cutting</b> <b>lathe</b> and associated electronics.|$|E
50|$|The {{official}} RIAA standard defines three time-constants with pre-emphasis rising indefinitely above 75 µs, but {{in practice}} this is not possible. When the RIAA equalization standard was written the inherent bandwidth limitations of the recording equipment and <b>cutting</b> <b>lathe</b> imposed their own ultimate upper limit on the pre-emphasis characteristic, so no official upper limit {{was included in the}} RIAA definition.|$|E
50|$|Burgess Macneal and, {{software}} programmer, Gerry Block {{created the}} impressively precise Sontec Compudisk pitch and depth automation controller for disc <b>cutting</b> <b>lathes,</b> which they debuted at the 1980 AES Convention. The Neumann VMS-80 {{appeared at the}} same convention, which {{made it difficult for}} people to decide whether to upgrade the whole lathe, or just improve their existing lathe's automation. The most famous studio to adopt the Compudisk was The Mastering Lab, which added one to their highly modified vintage Neumann lathes. They added an entraining bar which connected the carriages of three lathes so that the master lathe's Compudisk could move the carriages of all three lathes identically. Depth coils of the three lathes were operated electrically, in parallel, using the one controller for base depth and automated depth gain. The Compudisk cost about 3 times as much as the Zuma, but both greatly improved on the space-saving capabilities of previous designs.|$|R

5000|$|Vortex {{tubes are}} used for cooling of <b>cutting</b> tools (<b>lathes</b> and mills, both {{manually-operated}} and CNC machines) during machining. The vortex tube is well-matched to this application: machine shops generally already use compressed air, and a fast jet of cold air provides both cooling and removal of the [...] "chips" [...] produced by the tool. This completely eliminates or drastically reduces the need for liquid coolant, which is messy, expensive, and environmentally hazardous.|$|R
5000|$|Schnee was {{instrumental}} in launching Sheffield Lab Records and the modern era direct to disc audiophile recordings, when in 1975 he produced the Thelma Houston and Pressure Cooker album, I've Got the Music in Me.

50|$|The <b>cutting</b> <b>lathe</b> for DMM engraves {{the audio}} signal {{directly}} onto a copper-plated master disc, instead of engraving the groove into a lacquer-coated aluminum disc. Examination of early DMM discs revealed {{what appeared to}} be a high frequency modulation in the groove, thought to be caused by the use of an ultrasonic carrier tone. In fact, there was no carrier tone and the modulation was simply caused by the vibration (squeal) of the cutter head as it was dragged through the copper disc.|$|E
50|$|Recognizing the structure’s {{inherent}} superior acoustics, Kassem {{decided to}} use the church sanctuary as a recording area and build {{at the rear of the}} space a modern engineering control room with direct to disc recording and LP <b>lathe</b> <b>cutting</b> capabilities.|$|R

Also, DuNann told Stereophile that Contemporary sessions were recorded [...] "dry" [...] (without electronic echo added or in a reverberant room). Sometimes, {{such as in}} the case of Sonny Rollins' Way Out West, a plate reverb unit was inserted between the tape machine and the LP disc <b>cutting</b> <b>lathe.</b> This is why some later LP and CD reissues of Contemporary albums sound [...] "dry" [...] and [...] "dead" [...] compared to the original LPs mastered by DuNann.|$|E

40|$|International audienceTrends {{of modern}} {{engineering}} put forward higher requirements for quality bearings. This {{is especially true}} on production of bearings for special purposes with high speeds of rotation and resource. Much more opportunities in the technology management quality surface layers appear {{in the application of}} smoothing-strengthening methods, based on superficial plastic deformation. Working models of <b>cutting</b> <b>lathes,</b> grinders and tool smoothing sequence revealed the formation of operational parameters in the technological cycle of roller rings. The model of the dynamics of elastic deformation of the work piece tool helps identify actions radial force in the contact "surface-indenter. " Using mathematical modeling resolved a number of issues relevant process. Introduction. Trends of modern engineering put forward higher requirements for quality bearings. This {{is due to the fact}} that the reliability and durability of the machine mechanical largely depends on the operability established in her bearings. Most of the mechanisms operating in roller bearings are subjected to loads that differ from the calculation. Due to the large number of operational factors and mechanisms of their random nature complicated forecasting bearing behavior in real conditions. This leads to a premature loss of the performance of the bearing. This is especially true on production of bearings for special purposes with high speeds of rotation and resource. During work bearing an intense local working surfaces wear rings. Tangent surfaces tend to acquire a geometric shape and roughness that best match specific operating conditions. During this emerging higher contact stresses, which can lead to leakage of thermal processes in the surface layer of the metal and reduce its physical and mechanical properties. In areas of maximum deformation of the surface layer of the metal contact stresses the rise to critical values...|$|R
40|$|Finite Element Method has {{became the}} most {{powerful}} tool to solve static and dynamic problems of a structure. One of the structure that analyzed is dynamometer, which is an instrument to identify the cutting forces in turning process. In this study, we made static analysis for two dynamometers,i. e. cylindrical and boothroyd dynamometer by using ANSYS workbench 11. 0. The optimum condition was produced when the strain gauge was placed at 110 mm {{from the end of}} tool and loaded with 1975. 47 N.

50|$|The Model 700 was {{available}} in several different versions. In its most basic incarnation, it had two line-level, balanced inputs. One popular upgrade was the addition {{of one or two}} microphone preamps, which were installed on removable cards into slots in the machine. These allowed stereo recording directly into the Model 700, bypassing a mixing console. Since the recorder had a significantly lower noise floor than most mixers of the same era, this method made the best use of the system's available dynamic range. Another, much more rare accessory was the Model 700D Disc Mastering Delay. This was a device used for mastering vinyl records, and attached to a proprietary 25-pin digital output {{on the back of the}} Model 700 recorder. Because of the nature of vinyl records (which rotate at a constant angular velocity but at a changing linear velocity with respect to the needle as it moves inwards), it is necessary to send the audio signal to the computer controlling the movement (pitch) of the <b>cutting</b> <b>lathe.</b> In this way, during quiet passages the pitch is decreased thus enabling more grooves per inch. The computer needs an audio signal that is exactly one rotation ahead of the actual audio fed to the <b>cutting</b> <b>lathe,</b> so that it can move the cutting head rapidly forward before a loud passage is grooved. The disc mastering delay achieved this just like the analog mastering tape decks that used an extra playback head for this purpose.|$|E
50|$|An analog {{recording}} {{is one where}} a property or characteristic of a physical recording medium is made to vary in a manner analogous to the variations in air pressure of the original sound. Generally, the air pressure variations are first converted (by a transducer such as a microphone) into an electrical analog signal in which either the instantaneous voltage or current is directly proportional to the instantaneous air pressure (or {{is a function of}} the pressure). The variations of the electrical signal in turn are converted to variations in the recording medium by a recording machine such as a tape recorder or <b>cutting</b> <b>lathe.</b> Examples of properties that are modified are the magnetization of magnetic tape or the deviation (or displacement) of the groove of a gramophone disc from a smooth, flat spiral track.|$|E
50|$|The {{very high}} output {{impedance}} of valves (compared with transistors) usually requires matching transformers to drive low impedance loads such as loudspeakers or <b>cutting</b> <b>lathe</b> heads. The transformer {{is used as}} the load, {{in place of the}} resistor usually used in small-signal and driver stages. The reflected impedance of the transformer primary at the frequencies in use is much higher than the DC resistance of the windings, often kilohms. High performance transformers are, however, severe engineering compromises, are expensive and, in operation, are far from ideal. Output transformers dramatically increase the cost of a valve amplifier circuit compared to a direct-coupled transistor alternative. However, in both tube and solid state amps, matching output transformers are required for public address applications where low-loss high impedance/high voltage lines are used to connect multiple distant loudspeakers.|$|E
50|$|In 1895, Armstrong {{introduced}} a tool holder for <b>lathe</b> <b>cutting</b> bits. Rather than individual forged cutting tools, this product used a single forged shank with interchangeable cutting bits, drastically reducing {{the cost of}} such bits. The success of this product allowed Armstrong to build a factory in Chicago in 1900 (followed by a larger factory in 1905). In 1948, the company moved to its current facility, and in 1974, it opened a second facility in Fayetteville, Arkansas.|$|R

50|$|DLC {{coatings}} {{are often}} used to prevent wear due to their excellent tribological properties. DLC is very resistant to abrasive and adhesive wear making it suitable for use in applications that experience extreme contact pressure, both in rolling and sliding contact. DLC {{is often used to}} prevent wear on razor blades and metal <b>cutting</b> tools, including <b>lathe</b> inserts and milling cutters. DLC is used in bearings, cams, cam followers, and shafts in the automobile industry. The coatings reduce wear during the 'break-in' period, where drive train components may be starved for lubrication.|$|R
