40|$|AbstractSince hydroxyapatite-based {{materials}} have similar composition and crystallinity as natural calcified tissues, {{can be used}} for bone/tissue engineering. In the present study a novel nanocomposite based on bioceramics such as Natural Hydroxyapatite (NHA) and Baghdadite (BAG), was sintered by spark plasma sintering (SPS) technique. The prepared composite was characterized using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffractometer (XRD) and Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) techniques. The porosity of the samples was measured by Archimedes method. The <b>cold</b> <b>crushing</b> strength (CCS) <b>test</b> was applied to evaluate their mechanical properties. Our results demonstrated that NHA- 30 wt. %BAG nanocomposite specimens have the lower CCS in comparison with other examined composites. Consequently, NHA/BAG samples exhibited acceptable mechanical properties and could be suitable candidates for bone tissue engineering applications especially orthopaedic fields...|$|R
5000|$|The <b>Cold</b> <b>Crush</b> Brothers is an American hip hop {{group that}} formed in 1978 in the Bronx, New York City, New York. They were {{especially}} {{known for their}} memorable routines which included harmonies, melodies and stage-stomping performances. The <b>Cold</b> <b>Crush</b> Brothers {{set the standard for}} emceeing and became known as [...] "the Rolling Stones of hip hop". The <b>Cold</b> <b>Crush</b> Brothers still perform across the United States.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Cold</b> <b>Crush</b> Brothers toured {{all five}} boroughs of New York City {{and as far}} as Boston before commercially {{releasing}} records. Their popularity was strengthened by the sales of their live performances that were recorded on cassette by Tape Master (Elvis Moreno). The <b>Cold</b> <b>Crush</b> Brothers live performances/shows were taped and distributed worldwide via word-of-mouth promotion and mailed out to people everywhere including men and women serving in the armed forces around the world. The <b>Cold</b> <b>Crush</b> Brothers were featured in the 1982 movie Wild Style, the seminal work depicting Hip Hop Culture. In the movie, the <b>Cold</b> <b>Crush</b> Brothers featured in a number of scenes, the most notable being the <b>Cold</b> <b>Crush</b> Brothers' face off against their nemesis, the Fantastic Five in the classic basketball court scene. The other scene was the Battle at the Dixie Club where the brothers flex their emceeing / rap muscle, once again showing their prowess in the hip hop/rap genre. A year after the movie was released, the <b>Cold</b> <b>Crush</b> Brothers took hip hop abroad with tour dates in Japan and Europe.|$|R

5000|$|The <b>Cold</b> <b>Crush</b> Brothers most {{successful}} <b>Cold</b> <b>Crush</b> single {{to date is}} [...] "Fresh, Wild, Fly & Bold", released in 1984, which sold 16,000 units in its first week of release {{back in the early}} '80s that was a big deal. A distribution dispute between Tuff City Records and Profile Records hindered the sales of the single with the most potential of reaching gold status.|$|R
50|$|Another memorable {{moment of}} {{contribution}} of The <b>Cold</b> <b>Crush</b> Brothers {{was that they}} started the earliest foreign markets. The <b>Cold</b> <b>Crush</b> Brothers took 25 MCs, DJs, breakers, and bombers to Tokyo, Japan in 1983. This {{was one of the}} earliest foreign markets for hip hop other than La Belle, France. Although they had linguistic and cultural barriers, the Wild Style tour was a big success. Right after this, the <b>Cold</b> <b>Crush</b> Brothers were able to gain a CBS records, through the Tuff City Label. They were the first crew to do so, {{this was the first time}} in hip hop History that an independent hip hop record label and a major record company like CBS worked together.|$|R

5000|$|Because of the {{attention}} they began to attract, many groups would try to battle them to gain street credibility and for Hip Hop supremacy. This {{would lead to a}} fierce and well known rivalry with The Fantastic Five, culminating in a lyrical battle between the groups on July 3, 1981. The grand prize was $1000 cash. The Fantastic Romantic (as they later came to be known due to popularity with female audiences) Five won the battle but, as said by Grandmaster Caz, the <b>Cold</b> <b>Crush</b> Brothers [...] "won the war". After tapes of their battle began to circulate in the street, the people clearly thought that the <b>Cold</b> <b>Crush</b> Brothers won the battle. This established the <b>Cold</b> <b>Crush</b> Brothers as one of the strongest underground Hip Hop crews of all time.|$|R

30|$|Three {{batches of}} {{different}} phosphoric acid concentrations were fired at 1350 [*]°C for 1  h. Densification {{parameters of the}} fired batches {{as well as the}} <b>cold</b> <b>crushing</b> strength and thermal shock resistance were carried out. The mineral composition and microstructure of the selected batch were done using XRD as well as SEM and EDAX. It is concluded that by increasing phosphoric acid percentages, the porosities slightly increase and the <b>cold</b> <b>crushing</b> strengths drastically decrease; however, densities and shrinkages exhibit no remarked effects.|$|R

5000|$|While {{working at}} a pizzeria, Jackson did his job so well that when {{the owner of the}} shop {{expanded}} his business to Englewood, New Jersey, he brought Jackson over to head the Crispy Crust store. While managing for a local hip hop group, the <b>Cold</b> <b>Crush</b> Brothers, Jackson was discovered by Sylvia Robinson. She was out trying to find an act for the new hip-hop trend she had discovered through her son and she heard Jackson rapping some of the <b>Cold</b> <b>Crush</b> Brothers's rhymes. When Robinson asked him to join the group she was forming, Jackson went to Grandmaster Caz of the <b>Cold</b> <b>Crush</b> Brothers for rhymes. Caz gladly gave him his notebook, hoping to eventually get something in return. Jackson, now called [...] "Big Bank Hank," [...] was 22 {{years old at the time}} that the Sugarhill Gang's self-titled album was released.|$|R

30|$|It is {{observed}} that, on increasing of the phosphoric acid percentages, {{there is a}} noticeable increase in apparent porosities, while the <b>cold</b> <b>crushing</b> strengths decrease. The bulk densities {{as well as the}} linear shrinkages show slight changes from lower density, related to little expansion at 3 % phosphoric acid content, to higher density with the maximum shrinkage at 5 % phosphoric acid batch. It is also noticed that the batches containing the higher percentages of phosphoric acid exhibit higher porosities and lower <b>cold</b> <b>crushing</b> strengths.|$|R

40|$|Depending on phase {{components}} and densification, Magnesia-Zircon brick varies in appearance from white to veined and then brown with increasing sintering temperature. Properties including bulk density, apparent porosity and hot {{modulus of rupture}} as well as performance embodied with creep resistance and refractoriness continue to improve with sustaining enhancement of sintering temperature. Exceptionally, <b>cold</b> <b>crushing</b> strength first increases then decreases with rising sintering temperature and a peak exists at 1550 oC. Microstructural evolution suffers zircon decomposition companying by silica escape, forsterite formation, matrix solidification and zirconia coagulation, until a zirconia/forsterite composites belt tightly coating on magnesia aggregates.

The Fantastic Five was originally the [...] "L" [...] Brothers, which consisted of DJ Mean Gene, DJ Cordio, DJ Grand Wizard Theodore, MC Smiley, Master Rob, the Original Kevie Kev and sometimes Busy Bee Starski. Mr Tee also left <b>Cold</b> <b>Crush</b> and Tony Tone, Easy A.D. and Charlie Chase brought in Grandmaster Caz (formerly DJ Casanova Fly), Almighty Kay Gee and J.D.L. to fill the vacancy's in the line up.
