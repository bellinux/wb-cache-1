5|$|As {{early as}} 1933, {{two years before}} US13 had been {{completed}} as a four-lane divided highway from Dover to Wilmington, Delawareans petitioned DSHD to extend the divided highway south to the Maryland state line at Selbyville or Delmar (US13), a proposition DSHD acknowledged but deferred {{due to lack of}} funding, lack of proper planning, and higher priorities elsewhere in the state. Instead of adding divided highway in southern Delaware, DSHD needed to resolve the problem of the deterioration of 15- to 25-year-old <b>concrete</b> roads, such as those along the DuPont Highway. The department planned to address the issue by patching the <b>concrete</b> surface as needed, adding <b>concrete</b> shoulders, and applying a layer of bituminous <b>concrete,</b> more commonly known as asphalt <b>concrete</b> or blacktop, over the entire width of <b>concrete</b> to provide a wearing surface.|$|E

This {{may be because}} CA starch {{is known to have}} higher degree of polymerisation than MS starch (Swinkels 1985), resulting in greater binding force. This explains why CA starch <b>concretes</b> have lower slump when compared to the control <b>concretes</b> or MS starch <b>concretes.</b> Swinkels (1985) showed that the extent of polymerisation of starch molecule is influenced by the source of starch.|$|R

40|$|The {{quantitative}} scanning electron microscope-backscattered electron (SEM-BSE) {{image analysis}} was used to evaluate capillary porosity and pore size distributions in high-strength <b>concretes</b> at early ages. The Powers model for the hydration of cement was applied to the interpretation of the results of image analysis. The image analysis revealed that pore size distributions in <b>concretes</b> with an extremely low water/binder ratio of 0. 25 at early ages were discontinuous in the range of finer capillary pores. However, silica-fume-containing <b>concretes</b> with a water/binder ratio of 0. 25 had larger amounts of fine pores than did <b>concretes</b> without silica fume.

5|$|Recently the Canning Dam {{has been}} {{subjected}} to considerable cracking of the upper parts of the dam and upper gallery. Investigations have shown that cracking was due to strong AAR (alkali aggregate reactivity) in the <b>concrete.</b> AAR results in swelling of the <b>concrete,</b> which may cause secondary compressive stresses, localised map cracks, and, ultimately structural cracks. In addition, the <b>concrete</b> tensile strength and elasticity significantly decreases. Many old <b>concrete</b> dams are known to suffer from AAR, including Fontana Dam in Tennessee and Pian Telessio dam in Italy among others.|$|E
40|$|Alkali-activated <b>concretes</b> for {{structures}} {{have been}} developed for last 10 years, especially for the production of precast elements.

In this way <b>concretes</b> with the water to binder ratios 0. 45 and 0. 40 and with convenient workability were prepared with 28 -days strength up to 90  MPa. These <b>concretes</b> also show improved frost-resistance. Non-destructive tests for compressive strength were performed as well as and new correlation relationships were found. Finally, both fracture properties and fatigue tests were performed. All of these tests are important for a practical application of alkali-activated <b>concretes</b> for structures...|$|R

But <b>concrete</b> domes also required expensive wooden formwork, also called shuttering, to be built and kept in place during the curing process, which would usually have to be destroyed to be removed.

Results have emonstrated that 28 -day compressive cube strengths of 35 MPa can be attained by water-cured lime-pozzolan <b>concretes.</b> These strengths make the material suitable for many structural applications.

40|$|Traditionally <b>concretes</b> are {{proportioned}} {{for high}} compressive strength, {{even when the}} emphasis is on achieving high durability. Although, this approach results in <b>concretes</b> that have high strengths, the associated durability is not certain. <b>Concretes</b> proportioned using this approach typically contain high cement factors which can lead to other potential problems such as thermal cracking, excessive shrinkage, and creep besides being expensive. ^ In the present study, a new concept termed 2 ̆ 2 Porosity Transformation 2 ̆ 2 was developed to proportion high-performance <b>concretes</b> (HPC), to produce <b>concretes</b> that have improved properties without having to use high cement factors. The proposed approach was verified by preparing and testing a series of experimental <b>concretes.</b> To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, a set of reference <b>concretes,</b> designed using conventional procedure (ACI 211) were simultaneously prepared and tested. From this research, it was found that <b>concretes</b> proportioned using the porosity transformation approach exhibited superior mechanical and durability properties compared to <b>concretes</b> designed using conventional procedure, at about similar cement contents. ^ Another aspect that was investigated {{in the present study was}} the 2 ̆ 2 percolation phenomenon 2 ̆ 2 due to interfacial transition zone. An experimental program based on a inter-aggregate spacing was devised to evaluate the influence of percolation effect on selected properties of high-performance and conventional <b>concretes.</b> From this study it was found that, for <b>concretes</b> with normal range of inter-aggregate spacings (60 - 100 microns), the effects of percolation phenomenon were not apparent in any of the properties tested for either the high-performance or the conventional <b>concretes.</b> ^ Finally, in the present study, the alkali-silica reactivity of undispersed silica fume agglomerates in high-performance cementitious systems was investigated. This study was conducted to identify the state of condensed silica fume in cement pastes and mortars and then determine the mechanism and the factors influencing the associated alkali silica reaction. It was found from this study that significant fraction of condensed silica fume remains undispersed, even in high-sheared cement pastes and mortar systems. Further, these agglomerates were found to actively participate in an alkali silica reaction. Agglomerate size and its morphology were found to have a distinct influence on the degree of distress. Also, the degree of deterioration was found to be inversely related to the w/b ratio of the specimens. ...|$|R
