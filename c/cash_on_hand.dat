25|$|Most investors prefer {{their money}} to be in cash than in less fungible investments. <b>Cash</b> is <b>on</b> <b>hand</b> to be spent {{immediately}} if the need arises, but some investments require time or effort to transfer into spendable form. This is known as liquidity preference. A 1-year loan, for instance, is very liquid compared to a 10-year loan. A 10-year US Treasury bond, however, is liquid because it can easily be sold on the market.|$|R

Moody's also warned that it would downgrade Enron's commercial paper rating, the consequence of which would likely prevent the company from finding the further financing it sought to keep solvent.|$|E
5|$|Individual {{contributions}} made up {{the most}} of the campaign cash that Tancredo received, making up about 97% of his total pocketbook. PAC contributions were comparably low, producing only around $75,500, of the $1,311,869. He granted himself $200 for the campaign and received no federal funding. $88,457 of his money came from interest from the campaign's bank accounts and loans from outside sources.

5|$|Later in June, Fox News did {{a report}} on the {{families}} of the candidates running for President. Jim Gilmore's family was described as being busy with school and employment, limiting them from full-time campaigning. Two of the candidate's sons, Ashton and Jay were examined for the report. Ashton Gilmore worked full-time for his father's campaign headquarters, and Jay Gilmore worked in Washington and was only able to campaign as his schedule allowed. In election polling, unpromising results surfaced for the Gilmore campaign. In a CNN/Opinion Research Corporation poll, Gilmore failed to register half a percentage point among Republican voters. A grimmer portrait was painted for the campaign when end of the month finances revealed it was nearly broke with only $61,765 <b>cash</b> <b>on</b> <b>hand</b> from the $391,693 that had been raised overall.|$|E

This desired money balance of the individual constitutes his money demand {{and is based on}} his subjective valuation of holding money compared to their valuation of obtaining more goods and services. The amount of the money that the individual possess is his supply of money. Individuals will try to equate their desired and actual cash holdings through their spending behavior.|$|R

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the impact of}} creditor rights <b>on</b> <b>cash</b> holdings of firms from 53 countries. We find that the influence of creditor rights <b>on</b> <b>cash</b> holdings depends <b>on</b> country governance. In countries with poor overall governance, we observe that as creditor rights increase, the level of cash increases. We argue that management in these countries prefers to hold more cash when creditor rights are strong because they fear the consequences of financial distress and decide that it is prudent to perform risk reducing activities including holding more <b>cash.</b> <b>On</b> the other <b>hand,</b> we find that cash levels of firms residing in countries with strong country governance are not positively related to creditor rights. We believe that in these cases, creditors are not concerned with their money being expropriated and instead prefer companies to follow strategies of long run value maximization...|$|R

40|$|Funds for the {{eventual}} decommissioning and removal {{of nuclear power}} plants are accumulating. The amount will total many tens, perhaps hundreds of billions, of dollars. One of the ingredients in setting aside these funds is managing them so as to assure that just enough <b>cash</b> is <b>on</b> <b>hand</b> {{at the time of}} decommissioning to meet all required expenses at the lowest possible net present value cost to utility ratepayers. As with any investment, there can be a variety of opinions. For this reason, it is important to consult several sources for advice on the investment of such nuclear decommissioning trust funds (NDTs). The next three chapters provide such advice from the perspective of three different firms. The first, by Howard Hiller, stresses the importance of an adaptive approach, pointing out that the most difficult question is the choice of investment maturities. Hiller employs a simulation methodology to quantify the riskcost characteristics of strategies along the maturity spectrum [...] from short to long-term. He identifies some of the unique uncertainties inherent in decommissioning and brings these uncertainties into his analysis. He concludes that the steepness of the municipal yield curve can be exploited even in the presence of inflationary uncertainty. ...|$|R

He preferred to deal in ƒ1000 notes or Canadian $1000 notes (discontinued since 2000 in Canada) because it meant less bulk <b>cash</b> to have <b>on</b> <b>hand.</b> He required his distributors to convert all lower currencies into $50 or $100 notes at the least so as not to cause problems.|$|R
40|$|Factoring {{contract}} {{is a new}} phenomenon, compared to earlier forms of commerce in juridical circulation. Factoring is a method used by a firm to obtain cash when available cash balance, held by the firm, is insufficient to meet current obligations, and accommodate its other cash needs, such as new orders or contracts. The use of factoring to obtain the cash, needed to accommodate the firm’s immediate cash needs, will allow the firm to maintain a smaller ongoing cash balance. By reducing {{the size of its}} cash balances, more money becomes available for investment in the firm’s growth. A company sells its invoices at discount to their face value when it calculates that it will be better off proceeding to bolster its own growth than it would be by effectively functioning as its “customer’s bank”. Many businesses have cash flow that varies. A business might have a relatively large cash flow in one period, as well as a relatively small cash flow in another period. Because of this, firms find it necessary to both keep a <b>cash</b> balance <b>on</b> <b>hand,</b> and use such methods as factoring, in order to enable them to cover their short term cash needs in those periods in which these needs exceed cash flow...|$|R
