5|$|Following Charan Singh's resignation, Reddy summoned Chandrashekhar and Jagjivan Ram to Rashtrapati Bhavan to {{look into}} the {{possibility}} of forming an alternate government. Reddy, convinced {{that they would not be}} able to form one, accepted Singh's advice and dissolved Lok Sabha, calling for a mid term election. Singh was asked to continue as the caretaker prime minister till a new government was sworn in after the election. Reddy's decision was met with angry denunciations and protests by members of the Janata Party who even threatened to have him impeached. Although heading a caretaker government, Singh proposed as many as seven ordinances on a broad range of matters from effecting changes in <b>company</b> <b>law,</b> providing state funding of elections and reservation of jobs for the backward classes. Reddy however refused to promulgate the ordinances arguing that such momentous changes could not be made by a caretaker government.|$|E

He took the view that since the elected President should be politically neutral, Cabinet members should only be eligible to stand for election five years after leaving politics.|$|E
5|$|Under Protocol 3, Jersey {{is part of}} the European Union Customs Union of the European Community. The common customs tariff, levies {{and other}} {{agricultural}} import measures apply to trade between the island and non-Member States. There is free movement of goods and trade between the island and Member States. EU rules on freedom of movement for workers do not apply in Jersey. However, Article 4 of the Protocol requires the island's authorities to give the same treatment to all natural and legal persons of the Communities. In Pereira, the ECJ held that {{the scope of this article}} included any matter governed by the Treaties in a territory where the Treaties are fully applicable. The island is therefore within the scope of the Treaties to a limited extent, as a European Territory. To infer, as the French Ambassador and finance minister have attempted to argue, namely that the island is outside the European Union and Communities without qualification is therefore simplistic, in law false. The French blacklisting of the island had to be hastily revoked when this was pointed out. As a result, Jersey is not part of the single market in financial services. It is not required to implement EU Directives on such matters as movement of capital, <b>company</b> <b>law</b> or money laundering. However, the island's close proximity (135km south) and its close association with the financial sector of the U.K. has come under increasing scrutiny in recent years, with several mainline publications (e.g., The Wall Street Journal) labelling the island a tax haven.|$|E

40|$|In the British colonies {{from the}} latter part of the nineteenth century, one of the major indicia of whether a colonised economy was modernised was the {{presence}} of <b>company</b> <b>laws</b> modelled on the English Companies Act. This paper examines the manner in which, during the colonial period, companies legislation in a number of colonial locales was often highly politicised rather than being apolitical in nature. It is little noted in histories of <b>companies</b> <b>law</b> that in the colonies the legislation often had special provisions inserted to accommodate special circumstances existing in particular colonies. The presumed apolitical nature of <b>companies</b> <b>laws</b> is belied by practices such as typing companies by race in South Africa and, due to a distrust amongst colonists of indigenous Indian directors, the use of the managing agent system in Indian <b>companies</b> <b>law</b> up to the time of independence. This paper also examines the responses of indigenous political and business leaders to companies at the time of decolonisation. Of particular interest are the attitudes of these leaders to the possible effects of this introduced legislative regime on traditional business structures, and also their possible concerns as to the potential this legislation might hold for foreigners being able to acquire significant influence locally through large shareholdings in local companies. In this respect, the paper particularly focuses on Basutoland/Lesotho and the manner in which the introduction of modern <b>companies</b> <b>laws</b> was discussed at the moment of decolonisation. The paper then traces the manner in which those laws have influenced subsequent economic developments in Lesotho, and the salience or otherwise in hindsight of local leaders comments on the legislation at the point of decolonisation.
