40|$|The rapid {{development}} of increasingly complex in-vehicle electronics now offers an unprecedented level of convenience and versatility {{as well as}} accelerates the demand for <b>connected</b> <b>driving</b> experience, {{which can only be}} achieved in a comprehensive Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) technology based architecture. While a number of charging and range related issues continue to impede the Electric Vehicle (EV) market growth, integrating ITS technologies with EVs has the potential to address the problems and facilitate EV operations. This dissertation presents an ITS based vehicle infrastructure communication architecture in which abundant information can be exchanged in real time through vehicle-to-vehicle and vehicle-to- infrastructure communication, so that a variety of in-vehicle applications can be built to enhance the performance of EVs. This dissertation emphasizes on developing two applications that are specifically designed for EVs.

40|$|Connected and {{autonomous}} driving, highly automated {{transport systems}} and the related questions regarding traffic safety, the more efficient use of energy resources and the improved utilization of existing transport infrastructures – these developments are still {{at the beginning of}} extensive technology developments. Autonomous and <b>connected</b> <b>driving</b> are not restricted to high-tech applications in the automotive sector. Technologies such as computational perception and analysis of complex situations, navigation in difficult surroundings, secure exchange of large amounts of real-time data, control of the limits of driving dynamics and intuitive human-machine interfaces will soon be applied – e. g. in autonomous agricultural and forestry machinery, in driverless shuttle buses in public transport as well as in autonomous operational or urban logistics systems. So far, the questions regarding the safety assessment of autonomous driving functions remain largely unanswered. The following article will analyze various cases and solution approaches of autonomous driving to demonstrate that both statistical methods of reliability and safety assessment as well as redundancy concepts can only be applied to a limited extent...|$|E
40|$|Productive {{building}} {{energy efficiency}} (BEE) work is an approved {{factor in the}} progress of sustainable urbanization in China, with the assessment of carbon emission reduction in China’s public buildings (CERCPB) being {{an essential element of}} this endeavor. Nevertheless, such evaluation has been hampered by inadequate and inefficient approaches; this is the first study to utilize the Logarithmic Mean Divisia Index Type I (LMDI-I) to decompose the equation of China’s public building carbon emissions (CPBCE) with the <b>connected</b> <b>driving</b> factors (population in China, floor areas of China’s existing public buildings, building service level index of China’s existing public buildings, and the comparable CPBCE intensity), and this equation was established by the Stochastic Impacts by Regression on Population, Affluence, and Technology (STIRPAT) model. The LMDI and STIRPAT approaches subsequently assessed the CERCPB values from 2001 to 2015. The results indicated that: (1) Only the contribution of the comparable CPBCE intensity to CPBCE was negative during 2001 – 2015; this represents the CERCPB value for the period. (2) The assessment results indicated that CERCPB has accumulated considerably with the swift progress of BEE work in China in 2001 – 2015. The CERCPB values in 2001 – 2005, 2006 – 2010, and 2011 – 2015 were 69. 29, 158. 53, and 277. 86 million tons of carbon dioxide, respectively. (3) This study demonstrated that the positive effect of implementing public BEE work in China had led to significant results in 2001 – 2015, which can be regarded as a prerequisite for producing the considerable accumulation of CERCPB over this period. Overall, this study illustrated the feasibility of employing the LMDI and STIRPAT approaches for assessing the CERCPB value. Accordingly, we believe {{the results of this study}} are a significant driving force in the next phase of the development of the carbon emission control strategy of public buildings and sustainable urbanization in China...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{propeller}} shaft of rear-wheel drive vehicle is an axis which transfers power from an engine to rear-wheel through differential gear box. In this study, we studied {{the properties of}} friction welding required to produce the aluminum {{propeller shaft}} of lightweight rear-wheel-drive vehicle. We studied welding property to apply Al 7075 -T 6 aluminum yoke to automobile <b>connects</b> <b>driving</b> shaft and differential gear box. Here, solid phase friction welding method was used. In friction welding process, the principal parameter is spindle speed, up-set pressure and up-set time. We analyzed variable characteristics of friction welding strength according to the change of the spindle rate and up-set pressure. Friction welding strength was analyzed with ultimate tensile strength test with universal testing machine (UTM). The Al 7075 -T 6 {{was used as the}} round bar of the diameter of 25 mm. The ultimate tensile strength was 552. 3 MPa. It is 94 % of ultimate tensile strength of pure Al 7075 -T 6 material. The main parameters of characteristics are discussed in detail based on analysis of the main effects plot and multi-vari chart. Finally, the core factors to get the maximum effect of friction welding investigated...|$|R

40|$|Maize is {{the third}} most {{important}} cereal crop after wheat and rice and it is grown on about 120 million hectares worldwide. This crop is {{a major source of}} food and feed but, unfortunately, it is also a well-known host for toxigenic fungi as Aspergillus flavus able to contaminate the ripening kernels with aflatoxin B 1 (AFB 1) which is reported as carcinogenic for humans and animals. EU legislation fixed AFB 1 thresholds for raw maize destined to humans, dairy animals and other animal species (Commission Regulation 1181 / 2006 and Directive 100 / 2003). Modelling of the interactions between host, plant and environment during the season can enable prediction of pre-harvest AFB 1 risk and its potential management. In this work the relational diagram of A. flavus infection cycle was developed; state variables, rates and driving variables were decided and organized in a coherent structure. Quantitative data for crucial steps of the cycle were collected from literature and equations were elaborated to <b>connect</b> <b>driving</b> variables to rates; an algorithm was then developed to finalize the model.

40|$|Maize {{is one of}} the {{principal}} crops grown destined to food and feed worldwide, after wheat and rice, with more than 600 million tons produced annually (FAO, 2003). Unfortunately, maize is susceptible to mycotoxin producing fungi as Aspergillus flavus, which can contaminate the ripening kernels with aflatoxins. Aflatoxin B 1 is reported as the most toxic natural compound, causing chronic and acute toxicity on human and animal health. EU legal limits in raw maize are fixed at 5 µg/kg for products destined to humans and dairy animals and 20 µg/kg for other animal species (Commission Regulation 1181 / 2006, 165 / 2010 and Directive 100 / 2003). No mechanistic models for A. flavus–maize pathosystem are available in literature. In this work, the relational diagram of A. flavus infection cycle has been developed following the principles of “system analysis”; state variables, rates and driving variables were determined and linked in a coherent framework. Quantitative data for each steps of the cycle were collected from literature and mathematical equations were elaborated to <b>connect</b> <b>driving</b> variables to rates; an algorithm was also developed to finalize the model. The model predicts fungal development and toxin production (output) based on weather conditions (air temperature, relative humidity and rain). After a proper validation, the model may support stakeholders in order to: a) describe the dynamic of the contamination risk during the maize-growing season and at harvest, to rationalise harvest and post-harvest logistic; b) draw different scenarios based on real and simulated (climate change) meteorological data...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the fuel economy displayed by passenger vehicles {{and attempts to}} connect vehicular fuel consumption to such easily measurable parameters as vehicle speed, acceleration, gear and throttle position. The central contention is to understand how fuel consumption is <b>connected</b> to <b>driving</b> parameters in order to utilise such findings to reduce vehicle fuel consumption in future vehicle design. The New European Drive Cycle (NEDC) has been utilised as the testing framework to derive the mathematical relationship between fuel consumption and measurable driving parameters. The NEDC was simulated under laboratory conditions, and driving parameters together with the fuel consumption were measured. A few driving phases were identified so that any drive cycle may be composed by these phases; and mathematical relationships have been fitted on measured data {{for each of the}} phases...|$|R
