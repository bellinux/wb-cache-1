5|$|In the 6th century BC, the Greek philosopher Thales of Miletus {{experimented with}} amber rods and these {{experiments}} {{were the first}} studies into the production of electrical energy. While this method, {{now known as the}} triboelectric effect, can lift light objects and generate sparks, it is extremely inefficient. It was not until the invention of the voltaic pile in the eighteenth century that a viable source of electricity became available. The voltaic pile, and its modern descendant, the electrical battery, store energy chemically and make it available on demand in the form of electrical energy. The battery is a versatile and very <b>common</b> <b>power</b> source which is ideally suited to many applications, but its energy storage is finite, and once discharged it must be disposed of or recharged. For large electrical demands electrical energy must be generated and transmitted continuously over conductive transmission lines.|$|E
25|$|All {{sound is}} {{inherently}} powerful. If a hunter kills a lion {{he can see}} it, touch it, feel it and smell it. But if he hears a lion he must act, fast, because {{the sound of the}} lion signals its presence and its power. Speech is a form of sound that shares this <b>common</b> <b>power.</b> Like other sounds, it comes from within a living organism. A text can be ignored; it is just writing on paper. But to ignore speech can be unwise; our basic instincts compel us to pay attention.|$|E

[...] In the field of sensors and actuators, and for control systems using them, {{it is a common}} method of analysis to develop an {{electrical analogy}} of the entire system. [...] Since sensors can be sensing a variable in any energy domain, and likewise outputs from the system can be in any energy domain, analogies for all energy domains are required. [...] The following table gives a summary of the most <b>common</b> <b>power</b> conjugate variables used to form analogies.|$|E

2500|$|In the {{aftermath}} of World War I, Norway was not permitted to export more than 133,624 tonnes of iron ore to Germany per year, of which Sydvaranger was issued a quota of 65,000. None of the Allies were interested in importing from Sydvaranger. The rise of coal prices caused the company to again look into hydroelectricity, and the subsidiary Tårnelven Kraftselskap was given concession to build a power station in Tårnelven on 15 July 1919. This was based on moving the flow of Kobbholmvassdraget and Karpelven to Tårnelven to power a common station, but this proved impossible to accomplish. Instead the lakes of Viksjøen, Djupvann and Storvand were regulated and a <b>common</b> <b>power</b> station built at sea level. A [...] long transmission line was built to Bjørnevatn. This allowed the mainline railway between Kirkenes and Bjørnevatn to be electrified in 1920.|$|E
6000|$|He {{returned}} to his rooms at Merton direct from Germany. Like many men who have come back to Oxford at a riper age than that of undergraduate life, he now entered into the higher privileges and enjoyments of the University, the studies, friendships, and influences, as early youth sometimes fails to do. He was felt by his Oxford friends to have greatly developed since his Balliol terms had been over and the Eton boy left behind. Study {{was no longer a}} toil and conscientious effort. It had become a prime pleasure; and men wondered to find the plodding, accurate, but unenthusiastic student of three years back, a linguist and philologist of no <b>common</b> <b>power</b> and attainment. Mr. Roundell says, 'He had become quite another person. Self-cultivation had done much for him. Literature and art had opened his mind and enlarged his interests and sympathies. The moral and spiritual forces of the man were now vivified, refined, and strengthened by the awakening of his intellectual and esthetic nature.' ...|$|E
60|$|He {{had thought}} of {{marriage}} more than once, {{but it was a}} step from which he shrank. In Paris he had come by the opinion that marriage was a ridiculous institution of the philistines. He knew also that a permanent tie would ruin him. He had middle-class instincts, and it seemed a dreadful thing to him to marry a waitress. A common wife would prevent him from getting a decent practice. Besides, he had only just enough money to last him till he was qualified; he could not keep a wife even if they arranged not to have children. He thought of Cronshaw bound to a vulgar slattern, and he shuddered with dismay. He foresaw what Mildred, with her genteel ideas and her mean mind, would become: it was impossible for him to marry her. But he decided only with his reason; he felt that he must have her whatever happened; and if he could not get her without marrying her he would do that; the future could look after itself. It might end in disaster; he did not care. When he got hold of an idea it obsessed him, he could think of nothing else, and he had a more than <b>common</b> <b>power</b> to persuade himself of the reasonableness of what he wished to do. He found himself overthrowing all the sensible arguments which had occurred to him against marriage. Each day he found that he was more passionately devoted to her; and his unsatisfied love became angry and resentful.|$|E

In most cases, it is argued, the <b>common</b> law <b>power</b> is uncertain in its scope, and carries the risk of inappropriate or disproportionate use. There is also duplication, in that the <b>common</b> law <b>power</b> is matched by equivalent statutory powers. Given that the statutory powers are more clearly defined, and {{may be subject to}} safeguards not present in the common law, it is suggested that it would be preferable to abolish the <b>common</b> law <b>power.</b> This could be done without significantly restricting the power of the police to deal with behaviour which involves violence, or which may provoke violenc...|$|R
