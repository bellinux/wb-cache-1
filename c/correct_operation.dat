40|$|AbstractPurpose: To {{characterize}} {{the accuracy of}} color-flow duplex ultrasound (DUS) in planning lower extremity revascularization procedures, we prospectively compared operations predicted by means of DUS arterial scanning (DUSAS) and operations predicted by means of conventional angiography (CA) with actual operations performed in 36 patients undergoing 40 vascular reconstructions for critical (grade II/III) lower extremity ischemia. Methods: All patients were examined with lower extremity DUSAS followed by CA. DUSAS was performed from the aorta to the pedal vessels of the affected extremity. Adequacy of inflow was assessed, and the best distal target vessel with continuous, unobstructed flow was defined. An operative prediction was made and recorded based upon the DUSAS findings, and in a blinded fashion, based upon subsequent CA. The McNemar test for comparing correlated proportions was applied to test for the statistical significance of the difference (P <. 05) between <b>correct</b> <b>operations</b> predicted by DUSAS and CA. Results: Of the actual operations performed, 83 % were correctly predicted by means of DUSAS (95 % CI; range, 77 % to 89 %). Seven operations were incorrectly predicted with DUSAS. Of the actual operations performed, 90 % were correctly predicted by means of CA (95 % CI; range, 81 % to 99 %). Four operations were incorrectly predicted with CA. The McNemar test determined {{that the difference between}} <b>correct</b> <b>operations</b> predicted by means of DUSAS and <b>correct</b> <b>operations</b> predicted by means of CA was not statistically significant (P =. 50). Conclusions: With few exceptions, DUSAS can be used to reliably predict infrainguinal reconstruction strategies. Vessels defined as adequate with DUSAS are rarely unfit for bypass. Prospective investigation of lower extremity revascularization based solely upon DUSAS is warranted. (J Vasc Surg 1998; 28 : 482 - 91. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract-The QRD IUS {{algorithm}} is generally recognized as having good numerical properties under a finite-precision im-plementation. Furthermore, {{it is quite}} suited for VLSI imple-mentation since it can be easily mapped onto a systolic array. However, it is still unclear how to obtain the dynamic range of the algorithm in order a wordlength can be chosen to ensure <b>correct</b> <b>operations</b> of the algorithm. In this paper, we first propose a quasi-steady state model by observing the rotation parameters generated by boundary cells will eventually reach quasi-steady-state regardless of the input data statistics if A is close to one. With this model, we can obtain upper bounds of the dynamic range of processing cells. Thus the wordlength {{can be obtained from}} upper bounds of the dynamic range to prevent overflow and to ensure <b>correct</b> <b>operations</b> of the QRD RLS algorithm. Then we reconsider the stability problem under quantization effects with a more general analysis and obtain tighter bounds than given in a previous work 1131. Finally, two fault-tolerant problems, the missing error detection and the false alarm effect, that arise under finite-precision implementa-tion are considered. Detailed analysis on preventing missing error detection with a false alarm free condition is presented. I...|$|R

[...] In fact, a consist of such units can produce more than enough drawbar pull at start-up to damage or derail cars (if on a curve) or break couplers (the latter being referred to in North American railroad slang as [...] "jerking a lung"). Therefore, it is incumbent upon the engine driver to carefully monitor the amount of power being applied at start-up to avoid damage. In particular, [...] "jerking a lung" [...] could be a calamitous matter if it were to occur on an ascending grade, except that the safety inherent in the <b>correct</b> <b>operation</b> of automatic train brakes installed in wagons today, prevents runaway trains by automatically applying the wagon brakes when train line air pressure drops.|$|E
