After being moved from his local hospital in north London to University College Hospital in central London for intensive care, his blood and urine samples {{were sent to the}} UK's Atomic Weapons Establishment (AWE) for testing. Scientists at AWE tested for radioactive poison using gamma spectroscopy. No gamma rays were detected; however, a small spike was noticed at an energy of 803 kilo-electron volts (keV). The BBC reported that by coincidence another scientist, who had worked on Britain's early atomic bomb programme decades before, happened to overhear a discussion about the small spike and recognised it as the gamma ray signal from polonium-210, which was a <b>critical</b> <b>component</b> of early nuclear bombs. On the evening of 22 November, shortly before his death, his doctors were informed the poison was likely to be polonium-210. Further tests on a larger urine sample using spectroscopy designed to detect alpha radiation confirmed the result the following day.|$|E

40|$|Dimensionless {{nonlinear}} dynamical equations of a tilted {{support spring}} nonlinear packaging system with <b>critical</b> <b>components</b> were obtained under a rectangular pulse. To {{evaluate the damage}} characteristics of shocks to packaged products with <b>critical</b> <b>components,</b> a concept of the damage boundary surface was presented and applied to a titled support spring system, with the dimensionless critical acceleration of the system, the dimensionless critical velocity, and the frequency parameter ratio of the system taken as the three basic parameters. Based on the numerical results, {{the effects of the}} frequency parameter ratio, the mass ratio, the dimensionless peak pulse acceleration, the angle of the system, and the damping ratio on the damage boundary surface of <b>critical</b> <b>components</b> were discussed. It was demonstrated that with the increase of the frequency parameter ratio, the decrease of the angle, and/or the increase of the mass ratio, the safety zone of <b>critical</b> <b>components</b> can be broadened, and increasing the dimensionless peak pulse acceleration or the damping ratio may lead to a decrease of the damage zone for <b>critical</b> <b>components.</b> The results may lead to a thorough understanding of the design principles for the tilted support spring nonlinear system...|$|R
40|$|The {{nonlinear}} dynamical equations of tilted {{support spring}} packaging system with <b>critical</b> <b>components</b> were obtained under {{the action of}} half-sine pulse. To evaluate the shock characteristics of the <b>critical</b> <b>components,</b> a new concept of three-dimensional shock response spectrum was proposed. The ratio of the maximum shock response acceleration of the <b>critical</b> <b>components</b> to the peak pulse acceleration, the dimensionless pulse duration, and the frequency parameter ratio of system or the angle of tilted support spring system were three basic parameters of the three-dimensional shock response spectrum. Based on the numerical results, {{the effects of the}} peak pulse acceleration, the angle of the tilted support spring, the frequency parameter ratio, and the mass ratio on the shock response spectrum were discussed. It is shown that the effects of the angle of the tilted support spring and the frequency ratio on the shock response spectrum are particularly noticeable, increasing frequency parameter ratio of the system can obviously decrease the maximum shock response acceleration of the <b>critical</b> <b>components,</b> and the peak of the shock response of the <b>critical</b> <b>components</b> can be decreased at low frequency ratio by increasing mass ratio...|$|R
