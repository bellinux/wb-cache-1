In Study 1 we investigated whether {{the preference for}} <b>cute</b> infants depends on the ethnicity and species of the infant. We simultaneously presented two faces (one <b>cute</b> and one less <b>cute)</b> and asked Caucasian participants to choose the infant to whom they would rather give a toy (Task 1) and which infant they would rather adopt (Task 2). The infants were Caucasian or African human babies or dog puppies. For all face categories and in both tasks we found a strong preference for <b>cute</b> infants. A possible reason for preferring <b>cute</b> infants may be that <b>cute</b> infants look healthier than less <b>cute</b> infants. To investigate whether cuteness {{is associated with the}} assessment of health we conducted Study 2. Faces of Caucasian and African infants and dog puppies were rated for cuteness and health. The findings revealed a significant relationship between health and cuteness evaluation across all stimuli.

They tell it as an amusing but pointed illustration of the many struggles they have endured against a wide range of political opponents. Absurdly, in the early 1970 s Socosema had to fight to get Ciudad Juarez's garbage recognized by the federal government as Mexican. When the coop erative faced a tax bill from the Finance Ministry (Hacienda) charging im port duties on the recyclable materials the scavengers had recovered from the city's wastes, the cooperative countered with a very clever public re sponse. "Que nacionalidad tiene la basura?

Three multibody models have been developed and compared through optimal control simulations. The models differ from each other for the order of dynamics comprised: starting from a 14 degrees of freedom (dof) car which includes chassis and wheels motion, a 10 dof model model is obtained by neglecting the wheels hop dynamics, finally a 7 dof model is derived by completely eliminating the suspension motion. Optimal control problem simulations, including parametric analyses varying the center of mass position and suspensions stiffness, have been exe- <b>cuted</b> on a full lap on the International circuit of Adria. Simulations results show that the 10 dof model gives almost the same results of the 14 dof one, while significantly reducing the comput- ing time.

40|$|T {{his paper}} proposes a {{multi-band}} speech enhancement algorithm exploiting iterative processing for enhancement of single channel speech. In the proposed algorithm, {{the output of}} the multi-band spectral subtraction (MBSS) algorithm is used as the input signal again for next iteration process. As after the first MBSS processing step, the additive noise transforms to the remnant noise, the remnant noise needs to be further re-estimated. The proposed algorithm reduces the remnant musical noise further by iterating the enhanced output signal to the input again and performing the operation repeatedly. The newly estimated remnant noise is further used to process the next MBSS step. This procedure is iterated a small number of times. The proposed algorithm estimates noise in each iteration and spectral over-subtraction is exe <b>cuted</b> independently in each band. The experiments are conducted for various types of noises. The performance of the proposed enhancement algorithm is evaluated for various types of noises at different level of SNRs using, 1) objective quality measures: signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), segmental SNR, perceptual evaluation of speech quality (PESQ); and 2) subjective quality measure: mean opinion score (MOS). The results of proposed enhancement algorithm are compared with the popular MBSS algorithm. Experimental results as well as the objective and subjective quality measurement test results confirm that the enhanced speech obtained from the proposed algorithm is more pleasant to listeners than speech enhanced by classical MBSS algorithm. </p...|$|E
40|$|Pineapple fruits {{have a high}} {{concentration}} of ascorbic acid, nowadays everybody know it as Vitamin C in their composition. Today, ascorbic acid is one important supplement to take care of health.. There are a lot of benefits that can get from ascorbic acid. Before the extraction of ascorbic acid from fresh pineapple, the fresh pineapple was <b>cuted</b> and cleaned. Pineapple needed to blend and the filtered. After that, the sample is being mix with the solvent extraction, which is. 0. 02 M potassium phosphate, pH 2. 5 by phosphoric acid : acetonitrile (98 : 2.). The mixers then sonicated in ultrasonic extraction follow the time that are determined. There are two objectives in this research, first to determine the optimum extraction time. The parameters that will use are 10 minutes, 20 minutes and 30 minutes. Then the other one is to determine the optimum amount of sample. The parameters that used is 20 ml, 40 ml, and 60 ml of sample. Then the samples are filtered again before analysis. High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) was used to analyze where there are contain or not ascorbic acid in fresh pineapple. The HPLC method was used to developed and validated for determining the amount of ascorbic acid in fresh pineapple. The mobile phase that used in HPLC is 0. 02 M potassium phosphate, pH 2. 5 by phosphoric acid and acetonitrile. Ascorbic acid was determined at range one to two minutes and gets two peaks.

40|$|Genocide can {{be defined}} as a complex process of {{systematic}} persecution and annihi- lation of a group of people by a government. In the twentieth century, approximately 40 to 60 million defenseless people became victims of deliberate genocidal policies. The twenty-first century did not begin much better, with genocidal episodes going on in Darfur and the Congo. We can speak of genocide when individuals are perse- <b>cuted</b> and murdered merely {{on the basis of their}} presumed or imputed membership in a group rather than on their individual characteristics or participation in certain acts. Although it makes little sense to define genocide by a specific number of victims affected by it, we can state that a genocidal process always concerns a society at large and that genocide destroys a significant and often critical part of the affected community. It can be argued that genocidal processes are particularly malicious and destructive because they are directed against all members of a group, most often against innocent and defenseless people who are persecuted and killed regardless of their behaviour. Genocide always denotes a colossal and brutal collective criminality. For this reason, genocide has been studied as a modern phenomenon that is distinct from other forms of mass violence. After Raphael Lemkin died in 1959, the term seemed to be a dead letter. But in the 1970 s historians and social scientists redis- covered the concept and published the first academic work on genocide. Since then, the number of publications has grown and today genocide studies, with journals and research institutes in North America and Europe, is a respectable intellectual specialism...|$|E
40|$|Gurami (Osphronemus gouramy Lac.) is {{a popular}} fish species among Indonesian people. Several Gurami strains have been {{cultivated}} by fish farmer, {{one of which is}} Gurami Soang. This strain is belived to have a faster growth rate compared to other strains. However, like other strains, the fingerling of Soang strain have also a low survival and suceptible to disease, especially that caused by Aeromonas hydrophila infection. It has been proved that seeds from a single spawning event show varibale disease resistance. The difference in resistance among individuals is suggested related to the difference in their genetic component. One of the genes responsible for resistance is Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) class II B gene. Variability in resistance can be analyzed by using PCR - RFLP technique. PCR-RFLP is a technique that can produce a specific DNA fragments by PCR, followed by cutting the PCR product using restriction enzymes to describe {{the presence or absence of}} restriction sites in DNA fragments. This research aims to determine genetic marker to differiantiate between resitant and irresistant individual of Gurami Soang infected by A. hydrophila which die at a different time priod based on PCR-RFLP MHC class IIB gene. The study used survey method with purposive random sampling. The Data of PCR-RFLP band patterns were analyzed descriptively. The result indicated that cutting of the MHC class II B gene using HinfI produce two RFLP bands with 300 bp and 100 bp length in all samples. Meanwhile, the MHC IIB gene was not <b>cuted</b> by PstI, HindIII, BamHI and EcoRI enzymes forall samples. These mean that MHC II gene in all individuals were monomorphic. Therefore,it can be concluded that there is no specific genetic marker to differentiate gurami soang individulas which was dying in different time periods...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{contains}} first systematical {{revision of}} the results on traditional use of wild medicinal and aromatic herbs on the territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina (B&H) – west of Balkan Peninsula; Southeast of Europe. There have been detected 227 plants belonging to 71 different plant families, which are being used with ethno therapeutic purpose. Results were obtained by method of open ethno botanical interview which comprised 150 persons, whose average age was 63. Medicinal plants in ethno therapy are being used either in fresh, raw or dried condition. Different herbal parts, depending on period of vegetation season, sometimes even in winter, are basis for preparation of infusions (59 %), decoct (19 %), tinctures (4 %). Especially original are balms known as Bosnian »mehlems«, which are fresh <b>cuted</b> herbal parts mixed with lukewarm resin, raw cow butter or honey. In ethno therapy are mostly being used aerial plant organs. Majority of herbs is being used for treatment of illnesses of respiratory (22 %), gastrointestinal (19 %) and urinary and genital system (9 %), for treatment of skin conditions (11 %), {{as well as for}} nervous system and heart diseases (16 %). The most original plants on the field of ethno pharmacology, comparing with ethno therapy practice of other regions, are as follows: Ballota nigra, Aesculus hippocastanum, Calluna vulgaris, Centaurea cyanus, Euphrasia rostkoviana, Geranium robertianum, Gentiana asclepiadea, Helichrysum italicum, Lycopodium clavatum, Marrubium vulgare, Nepeta cataria, Populus tremula, Ruta graveolens, Tamus communis, Teucrium montanum, T. chamaedrys, and endemic plants Gentiana lutea subsp. symphyandra, Teucrium arduini, Micromeria thymifolia, Satureja montana, S. subspicata, Rhamnus fallax and Viola elegantula.

40|$|Abstract. The {{research}} in temporal databases has, so far, {{concentrated on the}} history of an object as it exists in the real world. Instead, in this paper we view the history of an object as it is recorded in a database. Such a history is obtained by extr lating the outcome of the u$ttes (insert, modify, and Yr elete) made to the object at drscrete instants. Our model su ports two kinds of query-users: the s stem-user, and the coszical-user. P For the classical-user, t E e interface to the database is identical to the usual inter-face in classical snapshot databases. We extend the classical relational model so that a transaction, i. e., an update or a (retrieval) query is recorded {{in such a way that}} its effect can be determine d at any time in the future; thus, our model is a zero information-loss model Theorem 1). The logical structure im oeed upon the mode I allows us to give a powerful algebra P or the system-user to query the circumstantial information surrounding updates and queries. In addition, a single execution of a query can be identified with the relation it retrieves; thus, a user can query queries, query queries on queries, ad infinitum. The model represents an application of temporal databases to mainstream databases. It can be used in auditing, and as a foundation for building secure systems. 1. INTFUJDUCTION. An update operation in classical databases is destructive- it not only destroys the environment in which it is exe <b>cuted,</b> but also destroys the environment for queries. After an update is made, only the new database state is available, without even a clue to its past states. A transaction in a database system is either sin update, or a query. The activities in a database system consist of a sequence T of such transactions. We present a model, called the zero injbmatin-loss model, in which n...|$|E
40|$|Solid Oxide Fuel Cells (SOFCs) are {{becoming}} a popular choice for meeting energy requirements of the present day due to their high efficiency and reformation capabilities. SOFCs are made of ceramic oxides with well-defined physical and thermal properties enabling a high operating temperature range (600 - 800 °C). Efficiency of a SOFC is typically well represented by its output voltage. Resistances across various compo- nents of the SOFC viz. anode, electrolyte and cathode diminish the maximum output voltage thus directly affecting {{the efficiency of the}} fuel cell. Each of the layers in a SOFC has generic as well as specific re- quirements warranting specialized fabrication processes. While such processes are many in number, they face limitations on size of the particles usable for the process, cost, ability to create graded porosity, thick- ness, etc. The main thrust of this work is the employment of a novel direct-write tool, namely the Optomec Aerosol Jet deposition system for fabricating the electrolyte layer of a SOFC that addresses some of the practical limitations of traditional SOFC fabrication techniques. While Optomec 2 ̆ 7 s Aerosol Jet deposition technique has been employed in several applications including printed electronics, a structured approach to identifying process parameters for printing materials was not found in literature. This work identifies and models process parameters significant to the deposition of nano- crystalline ceria with thickness of the deposited layer as response variable through design of experiments. Initial feasibility tests determined printability of the test ink and established a working range for the desired process parameters under investigation. A full factorial design with five factors and two levels was executed as the screening design. Three of five factors were determined as significant from the screening experiments. A regression equation was generated with the three significant terms from screening. Validation runs exe- <b>cuted</b> indicated lack of curvature within the design space for the significant parameters. Coefficients of terms from the regression equation were updated after regression analysis of a higher order design of experiments with three levels and the three significant parameters from screening. The updated regression equation provides a model with a reduced standard error and better fit of residuals as compared to the model from screening. A brief study on drying methods post-deposition {{and its impact on the}} quality of the printed film is also presented in this work...|$|E
