40|$|In {{spite of}} the rather diVerent {{procedures}} actually used in comparative studies to test the ability of diVerent species {{to rely on the}} human pointing gesture, there is no debate on the high performance of dogs in such tasks. Very little is known, however, on the <b>course</b> <b>through</b> <b>which</b> they acquire this ability or the probable factors inXuencing the process. Important developmental questions have remained unsolved and also some methodological concerns should be addressed before we can convincingly argue for one interpretation or another. In this study we tested 180 dogs of diVerent age (from 2 months to adults) to investigate their performance in the human distal momentary pointing gesture. The results, analyzed at both the group and the individual levels, showed no diVerence in the performance according to age, indicating that in dogs the comprehension of the human pointing may require only very limited and rapid early learning to fully develop. Interestingly, neither the keeping conditions nor the time spent in active interaction with the owner, and not even some special (agility) training for using human visual cues, had signiWcant eVect on the success and explained individual diVerences. The performance of the dogs was rather stable over time: during the 20 trials within a session and even when subsamples of diVerent age were repeatedly tested. Considering that in {{spite of the}} general success at the group level, {{more than half of the}} dogs were not successful at the individual level, we revealed alternative “decision-making rules” other than following the pointing gesture of the experimenter...|$|E
40|$|Rules can {{be found}} in every society {{governing}} the passage to adulthood. In some social systems, this transition is sharply demarcated, highly routinized, and carefully coordinated, while in others, it is far less easy to chart the <b>course</b> <b>through</b> <b>which</b> social members come of age. Sociologists and historians have shown little taste for studying patterns of transition, relegating these problems to anthropologists or social psychologists instead. Remarkably little work has been done on the scheduling of critical life events in our society, and on the existence of and changes in social timetables (Neugarten, 1968). How such scheduling is articulated with the requirements of other social institutions, though a subject of some speculation, has been generally neglected as a topic for empirical investigation (Elder, 1975). Although this paper explicitly addresses only the problem of youth, we regard the transition to adulthood as an illustrative case of a more general set of problems concerning how institutional constraints bear on the construction of the life course. The present paper may be seen as an exploratory study of some gross contrasts between youth “Then” [...] {{in the late nineteenth century}} [...] and "now " in 1970. At the same time, it proposes a series of analytic distinctions and a methodology. the implications of which will be discussed more fully further on. I. Youth and Uncertainty Discomfort, even turmoil, commonly characterize the period we have come to call youth. a stage of life during which major transitions of status are accomplished. These transitions, no doubt, are stressful in themselves, but our appreciation of the turmoil of youth typically rests on assumptions about the fit between the transition period and the society within which it occurs. It is widely held that this fit has changed substantially since industrialization. Most commentators have argued that the period of youth has been moved later in the life course (Musgrave...|$|E
