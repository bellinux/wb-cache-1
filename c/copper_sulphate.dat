He created a systematic approach to listing various different minerals and their use in medicinal concoctions, such as all the variously known forms of mica {{that could be used to}} cure ills through digestion. He wrote of the subconchoidal fracture of native cinnabar, signs of ore beds, and provided description on crystal form. Similar to the ore channels formed by circulation of ground water written of by the later German scientist Georgius Agricola, Su Song made similar statements concerning copper carbonate, as did the earlier Rihua Bencao of 970 with <b>copper</b> <b>sulphate.</b> Su's book was also the first pharmaceutical treatise written in China to describe the flax, Urtica thunbergiana, and Corchoropsis tomentosa (crenata) plants. According to Edward H. Schafer, Su accurately described the translucent quality of fine realgar, its origin from pods found in rocky river gorges, its matrix being pitted with holes and having a deep red, almost purple color, and that the mineral varied in sizes ranging from the size of a pea to a walnut.|$|E

Such combinations have applications in various settings, including {{the identification of}} novel compositions to study, treat and control infection.

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{the process of}} the <b>copper</b> (II) <b>sulphate</b> {{monohydrate}} from <b>copper</b> (II) <b>sulphate</b> pentahydrate (also known as a Blue vitriol or Bluestone) production was analyzed. <b>Copper</b> (II) <b>sulphate</b> pentahydrate {{is one of the most}} important copper salts which has been known since the ancient Egyptians. In the nineteenth century its application as a fungicide was discovered which provoked wide industrial production. Molecule of the <b>copper</b> (II) <b>sulphate</b> pentahydrate is a crystalohydrate with five water molecules linked by chemical bonds to a molecule of the <b>copper</b> (II) <b>sulphate.</b> <b>Copper</b> (II) <b>sulphate</b> exists as a series of compounds that differ in their degree of hydratation. The anhydrous form is a pale green or gray-white powder, whereas the pentahydrate (CuSO 4 • 5 H 2 O), the most commonly encountered salt, is bright blue. In order to obtain <b>copper</b> (II) <b>sulphate</b> monohydrate from <b>copper</b> (II) <b>sulphate</b> pentahydrate four water molecules need to be removed. To determine the optimum temperature and time required for the removal of four water molecules from a molecule of pentahydrate in this work thermogravimetric (TGA) analysis was performed. Thermogravimetric (TGA) analysis - dehydration of <b>copper</b> (II) <b>sulphate</b> pentahydrate is done using simultaneous TG-DSC thermal analyzer DTG-Q 600 SDT from TA Instruments. Analyzes was carried out for two type of samples, the sample containing particles of the average diameter equal to 0. 17 mm and the particles of the average diameter 0. 5 mm. In addition, fluidization and drying curve was determined using a semi-industrial fluidization column. On top, the industrial fluidization column aimed to produce 300 tones per month of <b>copper</b> (II) <b>sulphate</b> monohydrate was designed. Material and energy calculations were performed using software packages Simprosys 3. 0 and SuperPro Designer 5. 1. Simprosys 3. 0 is a software package designed for the modeling and simulation of a drying process as well as for 20 different unit operations.

The aim of this work was to assess the influence of <b>copper</b> (II) <b>sulphate</b> on intensity of lipid peroxidation (LPO) of Chlorobium limicola IMV K- 8 by measuring the content of primary (conjugated dienes and lipid hydroperoxides) and secondary lipid peroxidation products (TBA-reactive products). Microorganisms were cultivated at a temperature of 28 °C in GSB cultivation medium with exposure to light of wavelength 700 – 800  nm and intensity 40 lux. A suspension of C. limicola ІМV К- 8 cells in the phase of exponential growth was treated for one hour with metal salt solution in concentrations 0. 05 – 0. 50 mM for investigation of the influence of <b>copper</b> (II) <b>sulphate</b> on its physiological and biochemical properties. The control samples did not contain any <b>copper</b> (II) <b>sulphate.</b> Biomass was determined by turbidity of diluted cell suspension by application of photoelectric colorimeter KFK- 3. A mixture of n-heptane and isopropyl alcohol was added into cell-free extract for conjugated dienes determination. The samples were incubated at room temperature and centrifuged. Water was added into the supernatant and the samples were stirred. Ethanol was added to the heptanes phase and adsorption was measured at 233 nm. The content of lipid hydroperoxides was determined by a method based on protein precipitation by trichloroacetic acid followed by addition of ammonium thiocyanate. The concentration of TBA-reactive products in the cell-free extracts was determined by color reaction with malondialdehyde and thiobarbituric acid exposed to high temperature and acidity of the medium, which causes formation of trimetinic adduct with maximal absorption at 532 nm. It was shown that when CuSO 4 was added to the incubation medium the content of conjugated dienes and lipid hydroperoxides increased with the enhancement of salt concentration. However, its value decreased by the seventh and eighth days of cultivation. The content of TBA-reactive products under the influence of <b>copper</b> (II) <b>sulphate</b> varied depending on the duration of cultivation and concentration of the metal. Its highest quantity was observed on the eighth day of cultivation. Thus it was determined that under the influence of CuSO 4 the content of conjugated dienes, lipid hydroperoxides and TBA-reactive products increases. This indicates the increased activity of lipid peroxidation processes and the free radical chain reaction damage mechanism to lipids under these conditions...|$|R

Through ADT investigation, two similar monoclinic cell were determined, corresponding to cyanotrichite (a = 10. 16, b = 2. 90, c = 12. 64 Å and β = 92. 4 °) and carbonatecyanotrichite (a = 10. 16, b = 2. 91, c = 12. 42 Å and β = 98. 4 °).

40|$|Through vias on silicon or {{suspended}} membrane on a {{silicon substrate}} have aroused interest in various disciplines {{of science and}} engineering. Resources and effort are being devoted to research towards the realization of through vias in refined scale and possible applications of such vias. A process to fabricate nanoscale vias on layers of silicon oxide, which are subsequently suspended to form a membrane, was developed with photolithography steps. The process involves a photolithography pattern of a via pattern on layers of silicon oxide with an offset between the via pattern on different layers of silicon oxide. Due to partial overlapping caused by the offset, an array of nanoscale vias can be achieved. Polysilicon was incorporated to enable formation of the membrane by acting as a protective layer for etching via patterns on different layers of silicon oxide allowing independent pattern of the layers forming the offset pattern. Polysilicon was also utilized as etch mask for etching of via patterns onto the 3 μm thick oxide layer.

Samples were characterised by Fourier transformed IR spectroscopy. The selective catalytic reduction of NO with NH 3 in the presence of excess O 2 (SCR reaction), the NH 3 + O 2 and the NO + O 2 reactions were studied in a flow apparatus. Activity and selectivity did not depend on the sulphation method used for catalyst preparation but depended on the amount of <b>copper</b> and <b>sulphate,</b> particularly on the sulphate/copper ratio. As on Cu/Z, on Cu/SZ CuII was active for both SCR and NH 3 + O 2 reactions. The presence of covalent sulphates caused lower reducibility of CuII to CuI and higher Lewis acid strength of CuI in Cu/SZ than in Cu/Z. For (i) SCR, (ii) NH 3 + O 2 and (iii) NO + O 2, Cu/ZSg were less active than the parent Cu/Z. As the sulphate content in Cu/ZSg increased, the NO yield in the NH 3 + O 2 reaction markedly decreased, thus accounting for the increased selectivity in the SCR reaction.
