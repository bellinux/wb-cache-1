25|$|In some cases, pipe piles {{are filled}} with {{concrete}} to provide additional moment capacity or corrosion resistance. In the United Kingdom, this is generally not done {{in order to reduce}} the cost. In these cases <b>corrosion</b> <b>protection</b> is provided by allowing for a sacrificial thickness of steel or by adopting a higher grade of steel. If a concrete filled pipe pile is corroded, most of the load carrying capacity of the pile will remain intact due to the concrete, while it will be lost in an empty pipe pile.|$|E
25|$|The rate of {{corrosion}} protective {{formation is}} temperature dependent. For example, at 27°C (i.e., a common inlet temperature in the Middle East), rapid film formation and good <b>corrosion</b> <b>protection</b> can be expected within a few hours. At 16°C, it could take 2–3 months for the protection to mature. But once a good surface film forms, corrosion rates decrease, normally to 0.02–0.002mm/yr, as protective layers develop {{over a period of}} years. These alloys have good resistance to chloride pitting and crevice corrosion and are not susceptible to chloride stress corrosion.|$|E

25|$|The {{greatest}} {{advantage of}} the process {{is its ability to}} overcome hydrogen embrittlement problems, which is important for workpieces that have a hardness greater than HRC 40. Note that there still is some embrittlement of the workpiece. While this process does not cause problems with hydrogen embrittlement, and electroplating does, it still offers equivalent <b>corrosion</b> <b>protection.</b> There is a great cost savings in using mechanical plating over electroplating on hardened workpieces, because the electroplating processes requires a pre- and post-plating operation to overcome hydrogen embrittlement problems. Moreover, because mechanical plating occurs at room temperature there is no tempering of hardened workpieces.|$|E
25|$|Most ceramic {{materials}} are almost entirely immune to corrosion. The strong chemical bonds that hold them together leave very little free chemical {{energy in the}} structure; they {{can be thought of}} as already corroded. When corrosion does occur, it is almost always a simple dissolution of the material or chemical reaction, rather than an electrochemical process. A common example of <b>corrosion</b> <b>protection</b> in ceramics is the lime added to soda-lime glass to reduce its solubility in water; though it is not nearly as soluble as pure sodium silicate, normal glass does form sub-microscopic flaws when exposed to moisture. Due to its brittleness, such flaws cause a dramatic reduction in the strength of a glass object during its first few hours at room temperature.|$|E
