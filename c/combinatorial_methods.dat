2500|$|Graphs {{are basic}} objects in combinatorics. [...] The {{questions}} range from counting (e.g., {{the number of}} graphs on n vertices with k edges) to structural (e.g., which graphs contain Hamiltonian cycles) to algebraic questions (e.g., given a graph G and two numbers x and y, does the Tutte polynomial T'G(x,y) have a combinatorial interpretation?). [...] Although there are very strong connections between graph theory and combinatorics, these two are sometimes thought of as separate subjects. [...] This {{is due to the}} fact that while <b>combinatorial</b> <b>methods</b> apply to many graph theory problems, the two are generally used to seek solutions to different problems.|$|E

2500|$|Small {{cancellation}} {{theory was}} further generalized by Alexander Ol'shanskii who developed a [...] "graded" [...] {{version of the}} theory where the set of defining relations comes equipped with a filtration and where a defining relator of a particular grade is allowed to have a large overlap with a defining relator of a higher grade. Olshaskii used graded small cancellation theory to construct various [...] "monster" [...] groups, including the Tarski monster and also to give a new proof that free Burnside groups of large odd exponent are infinite (this result was originally proved by Adian and Novikov in 1968 using more <b>combinatorial</b> <b>methods).</b>|$|E
2500|$|Another {{influential}} {{paper of}} Stalling is his 1983 article [...] "Topology on finite graphs". Traditionally, the algebraic structure of subgroups of free groups {{has been studied}} in combinatorial group theory using <b>combinatorial</b> <b>methods,</b> such as the Schreier rewriting method and Nielsen transformations. Stallings' paper put forward a topological approach based on the methods of covering space theory that also used a simple graph-theoretic framework. The paper introduced the notion {{of what is now}} commonly referred to as Stallings subgroup graph for describing subgroups of free groups, and also introduced a foldings technique (used for approximating and algorithmically obtaining the subgroup graphs) and the notion of what is now known as a Stallings folding. Most classical results regarding subgroups of free groups acquired simple and straightforward proofs in this set-up and Stallings' method has become the standard tool in the theory for studying the subgroup structure of free groups, including both the algebraic and algorithmic questions (see [...] ). In particular, Stallings subgroup graphs and Stallings foldings have been the used as a key tools in many attempts to approach the Hanna Neumann conjecture.|$|E

We have developed a novel method called the Bayesian <b>combinatorial</b> <b>method</b> (BCM) for detecting combination of genetic variants that are predictive of disease.

40|$|A <b>combinatorial</b> <b>method</b> {{has been}} used to {{investigate}} the effects of anodic current density, and Mn(II) and H₂SO₄ concentrations on the electrochemical synthesis and characterization of electrolytic manganese dioxide (EMD). The <b>combinatorial</b> <b>method</b> involved rapid parallel and series electrochemical deposition of EMD from electrolytes with various Mn(II) (0. 15 – 1. 82 M) and H₂SO₄ (0. 05 – 0. 51 M) concentrations, at various anodic current densities (25 – 100 A m⁻²), onto individual 1 mm² titanium electrodes, in an overall array consisting of 64 electrodes. Electrode characterization was then by average plating voltage (recorded during deposition), and open circuit voltage and chronoamperometric discharge in 9 M KOH. The applicability and benefit of the method was demonstrated by identifying the conditions of 0. 59 M Mn(II), 0. 17 M H₂SO₄ and 62. 5 A m⁻² anodic current density as leading to the best performing EMD. These are comparable with existing knowledge regarding the synthesis and electrochemical performance of EMD, demonstrating clearly the capabilities of the <b>combinatorial</b> <b>method,</b> and providing a starting point for future experimentation. An added benefit of the method in this work was the considerable time saved during experimentation...|$|R
