40|$|Abstract. In this paper, {{a type of}} Si 3 N 4 /TiC micro-nano-composite ceramic tool {{materials}} were fabricated via hot pressing technique by adding Si 3 N 4 and TiC nanoparticles. Cutting forces, temperature and wear behavior in dry machining of nodular cast iron with Si 3 N 4 /TiC micro-nano-composite ceramic tool were investigated, in comparison with a commercial Sialon ceramic tool. Turning experiments were carried out at three different cutting speeds, which were 110, 175, and 220 m/min. Feed rate (f) and depth of cut (ap) were kept fixed at 0. 1 mm/rev and 0. 5 mm. The {{results show that the}} radial thrust force (Fy) become the largest among the three cutting force components (Fx, Fy and Fz), and Fy is the most sensitive to the changes of feed rate and depth of cut. In dry cutting of nodular cast iron, the cutting tool temperature rise rapidly with increase in cutting speed. The cutting temperature reach nearly 1000 ℃ at the cutting speed of 220 m/min. The two types of ceramic tools have similar cutting performance, while the Si 3 N 4 /TiC micro-nano-composite tool exhibits a better cutting performance than that of the Sialon tool.
