500|$|Due to poorer quality track {{than was}} the norm in its native England, the {{locomotive}} had much trouble with derailment; the C's engineers added a leading truck (an assembly consisting of an unpowered axle with smaller diameter wheels that was <b>connected</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>frame</b> and pushed {{in front of the}} locomotive) to help guide the engine into curves. [...] The leading truck's mechanism necessitated the removal of the coupling rod between the two main axles, leaving only the rear axle powered. Effectively, the John Bull became a 4-2-0 (a locomotive with two unpowered axles, one powered main axle, and no trailing axles). Later, the C also added a pilot ("cowcatcher") to the lead truck. [...] The cowcatcher is an angled assembly designed to deflect animals and debris off of the railroad track in front of the locomotive. To protect the locomotive's crew from the weather, the C also added walls and a roof (a cab) {{to the rear of the}} locomotive where the controls were located. C workshop crews also added safety features such as a bell and headlight.|$|E
2500|$|Coaster brakes {{have the}} {{advantage}} of being protected from the elements and thus perform well in rain or snow. Though coaster brakes generally go years without needing maintenance, they are more complicated than rim brakes to repair if it becomes necessary, especially the more sophisticated type with expanding brake shoes. Coaster brakes also do not have sufficient heat dissipation for use on long descents, a characteristic made legendary through events such as the 'Repack Downhill' race, where riders almost certainly would need to repack their coaster brakes after the grease melted or smoked due to the heat from lengthy downhill runs. A coaster brake can only be applied when the cranks are reasonably level, limiting how quickly it can be applied. As coaster brakes are only made for rear wheels, they have the disadvantage common to all rear brakes of skidding the wheel easily. This disadvantage may, however, be alleviated if the bicycle also has a hand-lever-operated front brake and the cyclist uses it. Another disadvantage is that the coaster brake is completely dependent on the chain being fully intact and engaged. If the chain breaks or disengages from the chainwheel and/or rear sprocket, the coaster brake provides no braking power whatsoever. [...] Like all hub brakes except disc brakes, a coaster brake requires a reaction arm to be <b>connected</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>frame.</b> [...] This may require unbolting when the wheel is removed or moved in its fork ends to adjust chain tension.|$|E

50|$|The basic {{motorcycle}} swingarm is a quadrilateral, {{with one}} short side <b>connected</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> motorcycle's <b>frame</b> with bearings {{so that it}} can pivot. The other short side is the rear axle around which the rear wheel turns. The long sides are <b>connected</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> motorcycle's <b>frame</b> or rear sub-frame with one or two shocks with coil-over springs.|$|R

50|$|Steering dampers {{have been}} {{available}} for bicycles as well. There is also a mechanism by the same name that consists only of a spring <b>connected</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>frame</b> and the fork that merely provides a progressive torque to straighten the steering.|$|E
5000|$|The duplex cradle type frame, {{is made of}} welded {{tubular steel}} with a steel {{box-section}} swingarm. Front suspension is conventional coil-sprung telescopic, but the rear has Suzuki's [...] "Full-floater" [...] type where the suspension is <b>connected</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>frame</b> by a linkage, which allows spring rates to increase in response to wheel travel.|$|E
50|$|SpeakerCraft's first {{innovation}} was {{the development}} of the architectural speaker. Architectural speakers are built into either walls or ceilings and use the structure of the wall or ceiling as <b>the</b> “cabinet” <b>to</b> enhance performance. Components of an architectural speaker include the driver (actual speaker), cross-over (which sends <b>the</b> correct frequencies <b>to</b> <b>the</b> correct driver), and termination point (which is where <b>the</b> speaker wires <b>connect</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>frame).</b> Driver configurations typically consist of two or three drivers that provide for the playback of the bass (low frequencies), the midrange (mid-level frequencies), and tweeter (high frequency) signals.|$|R

5000|$|The {{fabric that}} users bounce on (commonly {{known as the}} [...] "bounce mat" [...] or [...] "trampoline bed") is not elastic itself; the {{elasticity}} {{is provided by the}} springs that <b>connect</b> it <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>frame,</b> which store potential energy.|$|R
50|$|The single pivot is the {{simplest}} type of rear suspension. The rear axle {{is held by}} a swingarm which is <b>connected</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>frame</b> via a single pivot located near the bottom bracket. When the suspension moves through its travel, the path the rear axle describes is {{a circle around the}} pivot point. The rear triangle can be directly attached to the rear shock for a fairly linear leverage ratio between wheel travel and shock absorber travel.|$|E
50|$|Other {{changes that}} Ruger and Uziel Gal made to his {{original}} design included {{a change of}} materials used. The development of strong polymers through the years after the Second World War provoked the designers to change the materials used in the design. Therefore, the lower receiver and pistol grip of the MP9 are manufactured from Zytel (a strong and popular polymer at the time). The butt-stock is also made from a polymer, <b>connected</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>frame</b> via a nylon hinge.|$|E
50|$|Planar {{quadrilateral}} linkage, RRRR or 4R linkages {{have four}} rotating joints. One link {{of the chain}} is usually fixed, and is called the ground link, fixed link, or the frame. The two links <b>connected</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>frame</b> are called the grounded links and are generally the input and output links of the system, sometimes called the input link and output link. The last link is the floating link, which is also called a coupler or connecting rod because it connects an input to the output.|$|E
5000|$|For maximum {{strength}} and stability, {{as well as}} for easy levelling, most photographic tripods are braced around collapsible telescopic legs, with a center post that moves up and down. To further allow extension, the center post can usually extend above the meeting of three legs. At the top of the tripod is the head, which includes the camera mount (usually a detachable plate with a thumbscrew <b>to</b> hold <b>the</b> camera). <b>The</b> head <b>connects</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>frame</b> by several joints, allowing <b>the</b> camera <b>to</b> pan, tilt and [...] The head usually attaches to a lever so that adjustments <b>to</b> <b>the</b> orientation can be performed more delicately. Some tripods also feature integrated remote controls for a camera, though these are usually proprietary <b>to</b> <b>the</b> company that manufactured the camera.|$|R

50|$|In a pin-point analysis, a frame (or a transect) with a fixed {{grid pattern}} is placed above the vegetation. A pin is {{inserted}} vertically {{through one of}} the grid points into the vegetation and will typically touch a number of plants. The number of times the pin touches different plant species is then recorded. This procedure is repeated at each grid point. Vertical rulers <b>connected</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>frame</b> are used to prevent horizontal drift of the pins and to measure the height of vegetation hit by the pins.|$|E
50|$|Edokko Ichigo {{consists}} of four glass balls, a frame, a fish bait bar and a ballast weight. The glass balls consist of a communication ball, a transponder ball, a lighting ball and a video recording ball, which are connected vertically in a descending order. Each ball, housed in a protective plastic enclosure, can withstand deep-sea pressures. Among the four glass balls, only the communication ball is <b>connected</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>frame</b> via a rope. The other balls are fixed on the 1.5-meter-long metal frame. The fish bait bar and the ballast weight are fixed {{on the bottom of}} the frame.|$|E
50|$|When the action-cylinder-barrel {{assembly}} moves back, {{either by}} hand-cocking or recoil, a pivoting lever <b>connected</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>frame</b> cocks the hammer while a stud {{on the frame}} rides in the zig-zag grooves on the outer cylinder, revolving the next chamber part-way to ready position. When the internal spring brings the assembly forward the stud revolves the cylinder completely, and the chamber lines up with the barrel. Neither pulling the trigger nor manually cocking the hammer alone rotates the gun's cylinder; the entire assembly must be cocked {{to ensure that a}} chamber is properly lined up with the barrel.|$|E
50|$|Inside-journal bogies make {{particular}} {{demands on}} the pulse generator designer {{because they have no}} bearing cover on <b>the</b> end <b>to</b> serve as <b>the</b> basis from which the rotation of the wheelset shaft could be registered. In this case the pulse generator has to be mounted on a shaft stub attached <b>to</b> <b>the</b> wheelset and fitted with a torque converter <b>connected</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> bogie <b>frame</b> <b>to</b> prevent it from rotating.|$|R
50|$|The bogies were a {{fabricated}} steel design, with coil spring primary suspension. The traction motors and gearboxes (one per axle) were mounted <b>to</b> <b>the</b> bogie <b>frame</b> and <b>connected</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> wheels by a flexibly coupled quill drive. Traction links were <b>connected</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> bogie <b>frame</b> at {{a height of}} 200 mm above rail. The locomotive superstructure is supported on coil springs on a central swing bolster, and the centre bogie allows 200 mm of lateral movement to negotiate small-radius curves. Yaw dampers are also fitted.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{provides}} {{experimental results}} of an aircraft-relevant double panel structure mounted in a Sound transmission loss facility. The primary structure of the double panel system is excited either by a stochastic point force or by a diffuse sound field synthesized in the reverberation room of the transmission loss facility. The secondary structure, which is <b>connected</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>frames</b> of <b>the</b> primary structure, is augmented by actuators and sensors implementing an active feedforward control system. Special {{emphasis is placed on}} the causality of the active feedforward control system and its implications on the disturbance rejection at the error sensors. The coherence of the sensor signals is analysed for the two different disturbance excitations. Experimental results are presented regarding the causality, coherence and disturbance rejection of the active feedforward control system. Furthermore, the sound transmission loss of the double panel system is evaluated for different configurations of the active system. A principal result of this work is the evidence that it is possible <b>to</b> strongly influence <b>the</b> transmission of stochastic disturbance sources through double panel configurations by means of an active feedforward control system...|$|R
50|$|The {{church of}} the Nativity of the Mother of God is a cross-in-square design with a dome and built of stone, with some {{external}} carved decoration in the eastern façade where traditional niches have multifoil or scalloped tops <b>connected</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>frame</b> of the middle window. Its high dome, slightly shifted to the east, rests upon the two westerly located freely standing pillars and ledges of the altar. The southern entrance portal is fronted by the gate roofed with a star-shaped vault. Modern scholars have surmised {{that the church is}} actually an expanded, domed and decorated version of an earlier basilica probably dating from the 10th century.|$|E
50|$|In {{vertical}} decanter centrifuges {{the rotating}} assembly is mounted vertically with its weight {{supported by a}} single bearing at the bottom or suspended from the top. The gearbox and bowl are suspended from the drive head, which is <b>connected</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>frame.</b> The vertical decanter allows for high temperature and/or high-pressure operation due to the orientation and the rotational seals provided at one end. However, this makes the device {{more expensive than the}} horizontal decanter centrifuge, which is non-pressurised and open. The advantage of the vertical machine over the horizontal machine is that the noise emitted during production is much lower due to less vibration.|$|E
50|$|In {{order to}} make up for the delay of more than 12 hours in its transatlantic flight, the Hindenburg passed through a weather front of high {{humidity}} and high electrical charge. Although the mooring lines were not wet when they first hit the ground and ignition took place four minutes after, Eckener theorised that they may have become wet in these four minutes. When the ropes, which were <b>connected</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>frame,</b> became wet, they would have grounded the frame but not the skin. This would have caused a sudden potential difference between skin and frame (and the airship itself with the overlying air masses) and would have set off an electrical discharge - a spark. Seeking the quickest way to ground, the spark would have jumped from the skin onto the metal framework, igniting the leaking hydrogen.|$|E
5000|$|Envisioned as {{a luxury}} sports car, the Triumph Stag was {{designed}} to compete directly with the Mercedes-Benz SL class models. All Stags were four-seater convertible coupés, but for structural rigidity - and to meet new American rollover standards of the time - the Stag required a B-pillar [...] "roll bar" [...] hoop <b>connected</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> windscreen <b>frame</b> by a T-bar.

25|$|A {{trampoline}} is a gymnastic {{and recreational}} device {{consisting of a}} piece of taut, strong fabric stretched over a steel frame using many coiled springs to provide a rebounding force which propels the jumper high into the air. In a trampoline, the fabric is not elastic itself; the elasticity is provided by the springs which <b>connect</b> it <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>frame.</b> While <b>the</b> trampoline is an old invention which relied on crude and flawed designs, the modern trampoline was invented by George Nissen and Larry Griswold around 1934.|$|R
50|$|Modern {{machine guns}} are {{commonly}} mounted {{in one of}} four ways. The first is a bipod - often these are integrated with the weapon. This is common on light machine guns and some medium machine guns. Another is a tripod, where the person holding it does not form a 'leg' of support. Medium and heavy machine guns usually use tripods. On ships, vehicles and aircraft machine guns are usually mounted on a pintle mount - basically a steel post that is <b>connected</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>frame</b> or body. Tripod and pintle mounts are usually used with spade grips. The last major mounting type {{is one that is}} disconnected from humans, as part of an armament system, such as a tank coaxial or part of aircraft's armament. These are usually electrically fired and have complex sighting systems, for example the US Helicopter Armament Subsystems.|$|E
5000|$|Yet another {{variation}} of short link design is the [...] "Switch link", found on some Yeti bikes like the SB-66 designed by Dave Earle. In the original form, the rear triangle is <b>connected</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>frame</b> using an eccentric lower pivot, effectively creating {{a very short}} lower link whose length is that {{from the center of}} the eccentric to the attached pivot. The lower link would initially rotate upwards and backwards slightly. The links counter-rotated such that the top link would rotate forwards and upwards initially. As the top link rotated further it would move downwards reversing or [...] "Switching" [...] the lower link's direction downwards and forwards. In the more recent form, the lower link has been replaced with a liner bearing based on shock technology from Fox Racing Shox. This liner bearing simply moves up initially and then down towards the end of the suspension travel.|$|E
5000|$|The {{design of}} Saint Pablo Tour {{featured}} a [...] "first-of-its-kind floating stage" [...] which {{was composed of}} a main stage and an auxiliary stage that had an intricate system of pulleys and tracks designed to be <b>connected</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>frame</b> of each arena. The floating main stage had lights on the edge {{as well as on}} the bottom portion, which would occasionally shine on the audience. The second stage was composed of four rectangular portions which would move and provided ambient light for each song. The stages could then be manipulated to the needs of the tour, incorporating the audience into the experience at each concert as visitors would be able to engage with Kanye West. Each show had three sections separated by two intermissions, with uses of light increasing as the performance progresses. Some of the portions appeared to be influenced by various themes in popular culture, such as the show's intermissions which were similar to Close Encounters of the Third Kind by Steven Spielberg.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is <b>to</b> analyze <b>the</b> ways in which {{military}} activity in the arctic region is <b>framed</b> on <b>the</b> news website Russia Today. Russia Today is a state owned news agency which produces news intended for international audiences, and so this study has been positioned within international communication studies. The research employs discourse analysis as well as <b>framing</b> analysis. Initially, <b>the</b> search word “arctic” was used during <b>the</b> year 2014 <b>to</b> investigate <b>the</b> most common themes within news relating <b>to</b> <b>the</b> region. The most common news category was “military”, with 29 articles focusing on this topic. These articles were read and analyzed <b>to</b> determine <b>the</b> <b>frames</b> present, followed by a discourse analysis of two articles within each <b>frame</b> <b>to</b> further investigate <b>the</b> message presented. During the discourse analysis <b>the</b> <b>framing</b> of <b>the</b> arctic region was also investigated. The study suggests that on Russia Today, military activity in <b>the</b> arctic is <b>framed</b> in one of three ways: as defense, as matching military actions taken by the US or NATO, or as an effort to reclaim previously inhabited areas, which is <b>connected</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>framing</b> of <b>the</b> arctic as an exceptional region in which larger international issues are played out. As a result, this study has <b>the</b> potential <b>to</b> give some insight into the main message which is presented on the reasoning behind recent military activity in the arctic. ...|$|R
