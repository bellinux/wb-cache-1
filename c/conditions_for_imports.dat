The analytical axis is based in the main lines of continuity and in the inherent inflexion to the internal logic of regulatory instruments to international capital at this stage. Such study was the result of research of laws, decrees, orders and exchange actions which are generally the institutional framework of the period. Our conclusion was that although there are continuities between Vargas and Kubitschek regarding to the <b>conditions</b> <b>for</b> <b>imported</b> capital goods without exchange cover in the form of fdi, the selection criteria and essentiality mark a fundamental break in the distinct forms of association with the international capital between the two governments...|$|R
40|$|The active {{attraction}} of foreign capital {{is a most}} important condition to extricating the nation from a protracted economic crisis. But while fulfilling this condition, it is extremely important not to repeat today the errors of others. The experience of many Asian and Latin American countries {{as well as of}} a number of East European states warns us against becoming overly enthusiastic about foreign credits. Naturally, the latter are also necessary, but primarily for tactical purposes that are in particular connected with securing balance in the internal market as an important prerequisite to deeper qualitative and structural reforms. The resolution of the strategic problems of the economic reform and the transition to the rails of a market economy presuppose first of all the securing of favorable <b>conditions</b> <b>for</b> <b>importing</b> capital in its productive form, the development of foreign and joint enterprise, and the creation of special economic zones in the USSR. ...|$|R
40|$|In {{this study}} a {{solution}} procedure is developed {{for a class}} of industrial investment planning models which incorporates the following features: economies-of-scale in production, intermediate input-output relationships among production activities, and joint production of different products having common processing requirements (capacity sharing). The model is formulated as a mixed integer programming problem. It is single-period and disregards spatial considerations. The choice is between domestic production and imports (make-buy) to satisfy exogenously stated demands for a given set of interrelated products. A two-stage solution procedure was developed and specialized to various specifications of the planning model. At the first stage simple sufficiency <b>conditions</b> <b>for</b> <b>import</b> and <b>for</b> domestic production of a given product are systematically applied {{in an attempt to}} reduce the size of the problem. At the second stage (solution stage) an LP-based branch-and-bound (B-B) algorithm is used. Data from the mechanical engineering (metal working) sector of the Republic of Korea was used to implement the proposed two-stage solution procedure. The results from 25 test problems generated from the Korean data provide strong evidence of the efficiency of the approach. Moreover, computational experience with the B-B stage alone indicates that very large problems can be efficiently solved without dependence on the success of any form of problem reduction attempt...|$|R
40|$|The article reviews food {{security}} issues of Russia under foreign sanctions {{and the state}} of food products production and consumption in the Russian Federation. Food security is considered as a major factor of political and socio-economic stability of any country, with Russia a no exception. However, it {{has become one of the}} largest net food importers, chiefly due to its agrarian sector weakness. The present paper discusses major challenges of the agricultural industry and necessary <b>conditions</b> <b>for</b> <b>import</b> substitution, gives a definition to {{food security}} and analyzes Russian food security in the terms of crisis. The authors assess prospects <b>for</b> <b>import</b> substitution by domestic goods, examine regional food production sectors and define food-sufficiency level of the Russian population. The article consequently infers that successful import substitution rather than a redistribution of significant import flows of agricultural products between exporting countries requires a relatively long period, which constitutes more than one or two years. It is revealed, that Russian domestic production level is insufficient for provisioning its population, which is the main cause of the country importing necessary amount of food from abroad. According to medical norms, in spite of the positive consumption dynamics of basic food products, the population does not receive a significant amount of animal protein, vegetables and fruit, and in a number of cases, the quality of food is extremely low. In the article production of basic food products, as well as average daily household food rations per capita in terms of their energy and protein value are subjected to analysis. Moreover, the article gives an estimate to the Russian food import rates. It studies the annual consumption of basic food products, the dynamics of household expenditures share on food and the number of Russian population whose incomes are below the subsistence minimu...|$|R

The Torrens Island Avian Quarantine Station Stakeholder Group is made up of users of the quarantine station and the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service (AQIS). Their request arose from a desire to achieve higher throughputs at the Torrens Island quarantine station in particular, {{in order to reduce the}} backlog of applications for space in the facility. The request stated that reducing the PAQ period from 12 weeks post-hatch to 9 weeks post-hatch would allow an additional consignment to be accommodated, every 2 years. The request also provided information suggesting that such a reduction in PAQ period could be achieved without increasing the quarantine risk to Australia. Copies of the request, and supporting submissions from Dr Peter Scott, consulting veterinarian to Hy-line Australia Pty. Ltd. and Dr Peter Groves, Veterinary Consultant of Zootechny Pty. Ltd., are attached at Appendices 1 to 3 respectively. At the time of writing, there have been a total of 26 successful imports through the Torrens Island Quarantine station. There has never been a case of an exotic pathogen being detected during PAQ. There are currently three sets of <b>conditions</b> <b>for</b> the <b>import</b> of hatching eggs – one each for domestic hens, turkeys and ducks. This paper will, for domestic hens and turkeys: • summarise the existing quarantine requirements; • discuss the changes required to accommodate a reduced PAQ period, and • make recommendations for a reduction in the quarantine period for hatching eggs of domestic hens and turkeys. <b>Conditions</b> <b>for</b> the <b>import</b> of hatching eggs of domestic ducks will undergo further review, before any changes in the existing Conditions are considered.

40|$|A {{number of}} {{high-profile}} projects and {{a wave of}} recent investments have focused attention on the global gas-to-liquid (GTL) industry, suggesting a latent potential for gas-to-liquid fuels to usher in a new conceptualization of oil product markets. The clean-burning, high-quality characteristics of GTL diesel fuels lend support to this outlook, seemingly offering a viable substitute to oil-derived diesel in the global transport sector. However, doubts over the long-term viability of large-capacity GTL projects {{in the absence of}} heavily subsidized gas feedstock prices leads to an alternative narrative, suggesting that GTL products will have only a limited impact in the global transport sector by virtue of the industry’s unsustainable growth potential. Evidence of this is seen in Europe, where despite the favourable market <b>conditions</b> <b>for</b> diesel <b>imports,</b> GTL diesel remains a niche product with relatively narrow commercial applications. As such, the recent wave of GTL investments may not be totally justified by market context, and the potential for GTL fuels to impact oil product markets may be overstated...|$|R
40|$|The dispute Argentina-Measures Affecting the Importation of Goods {{concerns}} {{a series of}} measures imposed by Argentine authorities on economic operators as a <b>condition</b> <b>for</b> obtaining <b>import</b> licenses. These measures were introduced {{with the goal of}} advancing the Argentine government’s stated policies of re-industrialization, import substitution, and elimination of trade balance deficits. From a legal point of view, the least interesting feature of the dispute was the substantive compatibility of these measures with Article XI: 1 GATT as they clearly constituted import restrictions. Identifying and classifying the measures involved, however, proved more challenging: based on vague policy guidelines, devoid of any legal basis, and consisting largely of wholly discretionary ad hoc action by the authorities, clouded in confidential obscurity, the measures escaped familiar categories and distinctions of WTO law. From an economic perspective, although Argentina’s measures appear to have had no impact on its overall imports, they imposed large costs on foreign companies, as well as on Argentine importers and consumers.

40|$|A general {{approach}} to site-specific insertion of amino acid analogues into proteins in vivo {{would be the}} import into cells of a suppressor tRNA aminoacylated with the analogue of choice. The analogue would be inserted at any site in the protein specified by a stop codon in the mRNA. The only requirement is that the suppressor tRNA must not be a substrate {{for any of the}} cellular aminoacyl–tRNA synthetases. Here, we describe <b>conditions</b> <b>for</b> the <b>import</b> of amber and ochre suppressor tRNAs derived from Escherichia coli initiator tRNA into mammalian COS 1 cells, and we present evidence for their activity in the specific suppression of amber (UAG) and ochre (UAA) codons, respectively. We show that an aminoacylated amber suppressor tRNA (supF) derived from the E. coli tyrosine tRNA can be imported into COS 1 cells and acts as a suppressor of amber codons, whereas the same suppressor tRNA imported without prior aminoacylation does not, suggesting that the supF tRNA is not a substrate for any mammalian aminoacyl–tRNA synthetase. These results open the possibility of using the supF tRNA aminoacylated with an amino acid analogue as a {{general approach}} for the site-specific insertion of amino acid analogues into proteins in mammalian cells. We discuss the possibility further of importing a mixture of amber and ochre suppressor tRNAs for the insertion of two different amino acid analogues into a protein and the potential use of suppressor tRNA <b>import</b> <b>for</b> treatment of some of the human genetic diseases caused by nonsense mutations...|$|R

In this report, we describe <b>conditions</b> <b>for</b> the efficient <b>import</b> {{of each of}} these proteins by isolated pea thylakoids. Import of the 33 -kDa protein requires both light and stromal extract. The probable function of the stromal extract is to provide stromal processing peptidase to remove the first "envelope transit" signal of the presequence. Import of the 23 -kDa protein is also driven by light, but stromal extract is not required for import; furthermore, efficient import is still observed if the precursor is modified to completely block cleavage by residual stromal processing peptidase activity. The intermediate form of the 23 -kDa protein, which is generated by incubation of the precursor protein with stromal processing peptidase, is also efficiently imported. The results indicate that the thylakoidal protein transport system can import both the precursor and intermediate forms of the 23 -kDa protein, but probably only the intermediate form of the 33 -kDa protein...|$|R

40|$|Japan {{has been}} one of the largest {{importers}} of wood products in the world. However, a large area of domestic plantation forests has matured, and the Japanese government has adopted several policy measures aimed at increasing the supply of, and demand for, domestic wood. The Forest and Forestry Revitalization Plan aims to increase the domestic wood supply and increase Japan’s wood self-sufficiency rate to 50 % by 2020. The potential effect of the Revitalization Plan on the Japanese wood market, should be understood based on the competitive situation and substitutability of domestic and imported wood. This study examined the existence of a cointegration relationship between domestic and imported wood using sawlog and lumber price data. If both woods compete in a single Japanese market, then the law of one price, the necessary <b>condition</b> <b>for</b> substitution between <b>imported</b> and domestic wood to occur, must hold. Markets are said to be integrated if, at equilibrium, the law of one price (LOP) holds and no arbitrage opportunity exists as a necessary <b>condition</b> <b>for</b> price efficiency. If the LOP is upheld then trade models that assume price equilibrium among homogenous products can be used to study the effects that the Revitalization Plan would have on the volume of domestic and imported wood consumed in Japan. On the other hand, if the LOP does not hold to be true, then the assumption of these trade models is violated, and any results yielded by those trade models may not be correct. Using Johansen’s multivariate cointegration tests, it was revealed that the domestic wood market and the imported wood market had no cointegrating relationships. It was concluded that the market for domestic wood and that of imported wood are not closely connected through price arbitrage and that a price change for one wood product would not necessarily affect the prices of other wood products directly. Thus, the Revitalization Plan might not have a direct effect on the demand <b>for</b> <b>imported</b> wood products. However, in the case where the demand for wood remains constant or declining (as is the case in Japan), it is likely that a substantial increase in the demand for domestic wood would necessarily result in a corresponding decrease in the demand <b>for</b> <b>imported</b> wood. Perhaps more importantly, the combined impact of the subsidy programs targeted towards the forestry and wood products sectors in Japan will likely adversely impact the demand <b>for</b> <b>imported</b> wood. In this regard, several issues have to be pointed out. First, Japanese housing starts have been decreasing and they are not expected to dramatically increase given that the Japanese population is aging and shrinking. Since lumber demand is highly dependent on the housing industry, the declining trend of housing starts will reduce the total demand for wood in Japan. Given the emphasis of the Revitalization Plan on doubling the supply of domestic wood by 2020, this will inevitably lead to a reduced demand <b>for</b> <b>imported</b> wood. Second, as log imports decline, domestic sawmills and plywood mills have been switching from imported to domestic logs. This trend is strengthened by the government subsidy programs that support the expansion and modernization of domestic sawmills and plywood mills to replace older processing equipment with newer, more efficient processing technology that can utilize smaller diameter domestic logs. Thus, the share of imported logs used in domestic sawmills and plywood mills is likely to decline. Third, Japanese macroeconomic policy affects wood imports. Recent monetary-easing measures have impacted the exchange rate by depreciating the value of the yen by almost 50 % since Prime Minister Abe’s election in December 2012. The depreciation of the yen as a result of Japan’s change in monetary policy is likely to lead to a decline in total wood imports into Japan. Finally, and potentially most importantly, other government subsidy programs targeted to expand the use of domestic wood may distort the market relationships found in this study. In early 2013, MAFF announced a plan to introduce the “Wood Use Points Program (WUPP) ” which provides a substantial subsidy to homebuilders who use domestic wood in place of imported wood in the homes they build. If this program is successful, then the huge subsidies provided by the program would effectively expand the demand for domestic wood and the adverse impact of the WUPP Program on the demand <b>for</b> <b>imported</b> wood could be tremendous...|$|R
