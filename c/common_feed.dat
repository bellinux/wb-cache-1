40|$|Objective: To {{find out}} the nature of feeding {{practices}} among children with cleft lip and palate. Materials and Methods: A total of 155 subjects of less than 2 years of age with cleft lip and palate were chosen and divided into three groups according to their chronological age. Group I included 47 subjects (M= 35, F= 12) who were < 6 months old, Group II included 56 subjects (M= 36, F= 20) aged between 6 months and 1 year, and Group III included 52 subjects (M= 28, F= 24) of age between 1 and 2 years. Both {{the parents of the}} subjects with cleft lip and palate were interviewed and the details of the existing feeding practice were recorded on a standard proforma. Chi-square test was applied to find out any significant difference in the feeding method between males and females. Results: Spoon feeding was found as the most <b>common</b> <b>feeding</b> practice method. Breast feeding was the second most <b>common</b> <b>feeding</b> practice method among Group I subjects, whereas bottle feeding was the second most <b>common</b> <b>feeding</b> practice method among Group II and III subjects. The difference in the feeding practice between male and female subjects in all the three groups was very negligible and statistically not significant. Conclusion: Spoon feeding was found as the most <b>common</b> <b>feeding</b> method practiced by the parents of children with cleft lip and palate...|$|R

50|$|Feed rate {{affects the}} {{screening}} {{performance of the}} tumbler screener as well. The amount of material presented to a screen for processing is called feed rate. It is often related to the amplitude and frequency of the vibration. When feeding to a screener in a high rate, {{the capacity of the}} screening will be pushed to a limit very fast, causing stratification. In this case, the intensity of the vibration needs to be increased to process more materials in a certain period of time. However, when feeding in a low feed rate, the efficiency of the screener will be at low state as well. The particles will stay in a loose state, which will decrease the effectiveness. Material input to a tumbler screening technique should be constant and uniform throughout the running. Otherwise, the particles will not be evenly distributed on the screen and it may cause fluctuation. And it will lead to a poor performance of the tumbler screening. Feed rate should be more constant and steady when dealing with finer particles. The <b>common</b> <b>feed</b> rate range of a tumbler screening machine is 1 kg/h to 50 to/h.|$|E
50|$|An {{externally}} actuated weapon uses {{an external}} power source, {{such as an}} electric motor or even a hand crank to move its mechanism through the firing sequence. Most modern weapons of this type are called Gatling guns or chain guns in reference to their driving mechanism. Gatling guns have several barrels each with an associated action on a rotating carousel and a system of cams that load, cock, and fire each mechanism progressively as it rotates through the sequence; essentially each barrel is a separate bolt-action rifle using a <b>common</b> <b>feed</b> source. The continuous nature of the rotary action allows for an incredibly high cyclic rate of fire, often several thousand rounds per minute. Rotary guns are less prone to jamming than a gun operated by gas or recoil, as the external power source will eject misfired rounds with no further trouble, {{but this is not}} possible in the rare cases of self-powered rotary guns. Rotary guns are generally used with large rounds, 20mm in diameter or more, offering benefits of reliability and firepower, though the weight and size of the power source and driving mechanism makes them impractical for use outside of a vehicle or aircraft mount.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—A novel compact quadruplexer {{based on}} {{defected}} stepped impedance resonator (DSIR) with high isolation {{is presented in}} this paper. The proposed quadruplexer consists of a <b>common</b> input <b>feeding</b> line, four kinds of folded DSIRs and four individual output feeding lines. Considering the loading effect among channel filters, the input DSIRs must be properly located {{with respect to the}} <b>common</b> <b>feeding</b> line in order to realize all external quality factors at the same time, so that the loading effect becomes very small. Furthermore, since the compact DSIRs resonate at multiple fundamental frequencies, a high-isolation quadruplexer with size reduction can be obtained.
