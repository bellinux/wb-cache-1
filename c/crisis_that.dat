As the inflation rate grew during the period, the state financed part of these prices with subsidies. Investment in these areas decreased, and the generation and distribution networks suffered.

By the time he resigned in 1945, Macdonald's federal political career was in tatters.|$|E
5|$|Reginald {{took part}} in the {{negotiations}} in August and September 1169 that attempted to reach a settlement between Henry and Becket. These negotiations included papal nuncios and most of the Norman bishops and prominent abbots, as well as the royal clerks.

Reginald {{was one of the main}} clerics working for King Henry during the dispute with Becket, along with John of Oxford, Richard of Ilchester, and Geoffrey Ridel.

Thus, the compromise about them is quite hard and impossible, and these crises often last so long.
