40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the relationships between}} different social <b>contexts</b> <b>of</b> video game play, the player experience and wellbeing. In doing so it challenges the notion that video game play is socially isolating and shows that there are potential benefits to all <b>contexts</b> <b>of</b> play, including solitary play. Four studies utilizing different methodologies (survey, interview, experiment) collectively demonstrate how different social <b>contexts</b> <b>of</b> play provide distinct opportunities to maintain or enhance wellbeing...|$|R
40|$|In this chapter, {{we bring}} to the {{management}} scholar’s attention the concept <b>of</b> <b>contexts</b> <b>of</b> experience as {{a key factor in}} understanding the changes currently influencing the strategies of many businesses and the behavior of many consumers. The topic is introduced with a critical analysis of how the marketing literature has dealt with the difference between goods and services. Then we define the <b>contexts</b> <b>of</b> consumption of goods and services as <b>contexts</b> <b>of</b> experience for the subjects populating them. Consumers interact in these contexts, learning and feeling emotions. We go on to further analyze the role of emotions and the process of value co-production within <b>contexts</b> <b>of</b> experience. Finally, we propose to divide <b>contexts</b> <b>of</b> experience into two categories that may be useful for designing a successful marketing strategy, i. e. the (few) contexts with a high intensity of experience in which the firm conducts an exploratory activity of complexity, and the (many) contexts in which it exploits the results of this exploration...|$|R
40|$|Unlike {{previous}} studies of ground stone technology in the Greek Neolithic, this paper follows a more contextualised approach by looking at <b>contexts</b> <b>of</b> deposition of ground stone from Late Neolithic Makriyalos, Northern Greece. The patterns attested {{in the distribution of}} ground stone objects between domestic and communal areas will be discussed in terms of the spatial and social <b>contexts</b> <b>of</b> tool use, curation and deposition, contributing to wider discussions about the way acts of production, consumption and discard were structured within different <b>contexts</b> <b>of</b> social practice...|$|R
