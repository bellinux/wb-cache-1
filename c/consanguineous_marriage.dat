40|$|Aim: Consanguinity is an {{important}} risk factor in genetic diseases and in congenital malformations. This study was done to assess the knowledge and the attitude of youth couples on/towards <b>consanguineous</b> <b>marriages</b> {{in the north of}} Iran. Material and Methods: This descriptive-analytic study was carried out on 250 young people (125 couples) in Northern Iran during the year 2008. The information was obtained by a direct interview and the questionnaire included four sections which comprised of 39 closed questions. The data was analyzed by using SPSS, version 11. 5 and the Chi-Square test. Results: <b>Consanguineous</b> <b>marriages</b> were observed in 32. 5 % of the couples. <b>Consanguineous</b> <b>marriages</b> were determined in 20. 87 % and 11. 63 % of the rural and the urban residents respectively.

40|$|The {{prevalence}} of <b>consanguineous</b> <b>marriages</b> was studied in 940 families belonging to four different socio-economic groups {{in and around}} Lahore, Pakistan. The births occurring in these families from September 1984 to March 1987 were also investigated for birth defects. The overall {{prevalence of}} <b>consanguineous</b> <b>marriages</b> was 46 %. The first cousin marriages were most common (67 %), followed by the marriages between second cousins, 19 %. The prevalence of <b>consanguineous</b> <b>marriages</b> was clearly associated with the socio-economic status of the study groups; 50 % of the marriages was related in the periurban slum, 49 % in the village, 44 % in the urban slum and 31 % in the upper middle class. The birth defects were also more prevalent in the poorer areas, being highest in the periurban slum (17. 7 %) followed by the urban slum (15. 6 %) and then the village (14. 8 %) and lowest in the upper middle class (12. 3 %). Although, the frequency of both consanguinity and birth defects were related with the socio-economic levels of the study groups, there was no association between inbreeding and birth defects. Perhaps, deleterious recessive genes for birth defects have been 'bred out', because of continuous inbreeding over generations in this population. There was a significant predilection of major birth defects in boys without clear sex linkage. The conclusion is {{that the rate of}} <b>consanguineous</b> <b>marriages</b> was high, especially in the poorer areas, but the relationship between <b>consanguineous</b> <b>marriages</b> and birth defects was little or none.

The majority were married, well educated and were students, in private or government service or self employed. One hundred (25 %) of the respondents were either married or were planning to marry their first cousin, and 57 (14 %) their second cousin. The main reasons in favor of <b>consanguineous</b> <b>marriages</b> were quoted as: ‘arranged marriage’, ‘it is healthy to marry within the family’ and ‘it is traditional’. Some 271 (69 %) of the respondents said ‘yes’ to their son or daughter marrying within the family.

40|$|Introduction: <b>Consanguineous</b> <b>marriages</b> are {{a common}} {{practice}} in the Middle East, Asian and African populations. Many studies have stated an association between first cousin marriages and the incidence of autosomal recessive diseases and congenital malformations. High frequency of consanguinity is reported by researchers among South India. The objectives {{of this study were}} to determine the prevalence and type of <b>consanguineous</b> <b>marriages</b> among the different communities of Mangalore. Methods: This study was conducted on 1164 married women in Mangalore to investigate the prevalence and type of <b>consanguineous</b> <b>marriages.</b> All the women were interviewed personally using a structured questionnaire. Family pedigree was constructed to study the type of <b>consanguineous</b> <b>marriages.</b> Data analysis was done by SPSS Win 13. 0. Results: A low percentage of consanguinity (6. 53 %) was observed with a mean inbreeding coefficient of 0. 0339. Frequency of consanguinity between religions was highly significant. Of these the most frequent were first cousin marriages (43. 42 %). Within Hindu religion the highest rate of consanguinity was among the Billavas (47. 62 %) of which the most frequent were distant relative marriages (75 %) followed by second cousin marriages (57. 14 %). There {{was no significant difference in}} the frequency distribution of the types of consanguinity between the religions and also between the different groups among Hindus. Conclusion: The frequency of consanguinity was found to be low in Mangalore. The findings contradict with the earlier reports of high prevalence of <b>consanguineous</b> <b>marriages</b> in South India. Increased female education, increased socio-economic status and decrease in parental decisions in marriages may be the reasons...|$|R

Information {{was obtained from}} parish registers of 42 localities, corresponding {{to a total of}} 41, 696 weddings. <b>Consanguineous</b> <b>marriages</b> were defined as those up to the third degree of consanguinity (second cousins). From 1874 to 1975 the percentage of related mates was 4. 45 % and the inbreeding coefficient was 0. 0011868 (for 1874 to 1917 corresponding figures up to the fourth degree were 16. 44 % and 0. 0019085, respectively). In order to ascertain the characteristics and evolution of mating patterns in Gredos, the contribution of each degree of kinship was analyzed as a whole and then for each valley separately. Regarding total <b>consanguineous</b> <b>marriages</b> in Gredos, there is a low frequency of uncle-niece matings (0. 21 %) and a first-second cousin mating ratio (C 22 /C 33) of 0. 23 (up to the third degree of consanguinity). Before 1918 multiple matings (i. e., those involving more than a single relationship) accounted for 19. 16 % of <b>consanguineous</b> <b>marriages</b> (up to the fourth degree). The observed frequencies of multiple <b>consanguineous</b> <b>marriages</b> was, on average, about twice that expected at random, and the proportion of such marriages to total inbreeding was 34. 65 %.

The total frequency of <b>consanguineous</b> <b>marriages</b> (up {{to the fourth}} degree) is 23. 05 %; multiple <b>consanguineous</b> <b>marriages</b> are remarkably common, reaching 5. 43 % of the total. The first cousin/second cousin ratio (referred to as kinship-type frequencies) is 0. 43. The inbreeding values are the highest recorded in Spain and in Europe: 3 is 4. 82 10 3 for the whole period and 4 is 6. 78 10 3 for 1880 – 1919. The temporal trend of inbreeding shows high values (3 4. 5 10 3) for a particularly long period (1900 – 1959) and a rapid decline from 1960 onward. This historical inbreeding trend is clearly related to changes in population size. The frequencies of multiple <b>consanguineous</b> <b>marriages</b> and the analysis of isonymy show that the inbreeding structure is related to geographic and demographic factors. Comparing the results at two hierarchical levels (La Cabrera {{as a whole and}} the 37 parishes individually), we conclude that the inbreeding values are affected by internal geographic subdivision of the population (Wahlund effect).
