25|$|To {{overcome}} {{the need to}} use organic solvents and solid porogens, a technique using gas as a porogen has been developed. First, disc-shaped structures made of the desired polymer are prepared by means of <b>compression</b> <b>molding</b> using a heated mold. The discs are then placed in a chamber where {{they are exposed to}} high pressure CO2 for several days. The pressure inside the chamber is gradually restored to atmospheric levels. During this procedure the pores are formed by the carbon dioxide molecules that abandon the polymer, resulting in a sponge-like structure. The main problems resulting from such a technique are caused by the excessive heat used during <b>compression</b> <b>molding</b> (which prohibits the incorporation of any temperature labile material into the polymer matrix) and {{by the fact that the}} pores do not form an interconnected structure.|$|E

[...] After a settling period, lasting from minutes to days, the mould is heated at 360 to 380 degrees Celsius (680 to 716 degrees Fahrenheit), allowing the fine particles to fuse into a single mass.|$|E
2500|$|The glass {{transition}} temperature (Tg) of atactic PMMA is [...] [...] The Tg values of commercial grades of PMMA range from the range is so wide because of the vast number of commercial compositions which are copolymers with co-monomers other than methyl methacrylate. [...] PMMA is thus an organic glass at room temperature; i.e., it is below its Tg. [...] The forming temperature starts at the {{glass transition}} temperature and goes up from there. [...] All common molding processes may be used, including injection molding, <b>compression</b> <b>molding,</b> and extrusion. [...] The highest quality PMMA sheets are produced by cell casting, but in this case, the polymerization and molding steps occur concurrently. [...] The strength of the material is higher than molding grades owing to its extremely high molecular mass. [...] Rubber toughening {{has been used to}} increase the toughness of PMMA owing to its brittle behavior in response to applied loads.|$|E

We examined 26 direct <b>compression</b> <b>molded</b> components and 13 nondirect <b>compression</b> <b>molded</b> components and applied a new backside wear severity score.

Backside wear was related to polyethylene manufacturing process with direct <b>compression</b> <b>molded</b> implants having a wear score of 2. 3 and nondirect <b>compression</b> <b>molded</b> a score of 5. 7.

Obviously, the lower conductivity of the conducting phase in the <b>compression</b> <b>molded</b> film is caused by the partial thermal degradation of PANI-LSA under the melting treatment temperature (240  °C). The values of the critical exponent t for the cast and <b>compression</b> <b>molded</b> films are 1.14 and 2.62 accordingly. Such inequality in the critical exponent indicates a strong difference in the spatial structure of the percolation cluster, which results in the different slopes of the curves.

Electrical percolation threshold decreased from 2 - 3 wt. % CNT loading to 1 - 2 wt. % when the processing speed was increased from 500 rpm to 1100 rpm. A 2 wt. % sample processed at 1100 rpm showed a resistivity drop by 11 orders of magnitude compared to a sample processed at 500 rpm due to substantial reduction in the undispersed MWCNT area fractions (or better dispersion) which arises {{as a result of}} higher specific mechanical energy input. Volume resistivities of the <b>compression</b> <b>molded</b> samples were lower than that of the strand samples. Significant variations in resistivities are found in strand samples up to 3 wt. % MWCNT with different processing parameters while very little changes are observed in the <b>compression</b> <b>molded</b> specimens. Statistical analysis of dispersion qualities in terms of area fraction of undispersed MWCNT agglomerates was performed to correlate the morphology with specific mechanical energy inputs, resulting dispersions and measured resistivities.
