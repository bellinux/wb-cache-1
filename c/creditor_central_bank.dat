40|$|The paper {{initially}} discusses monetary {{policies in}} the context of the wide margins introduced on 1 August 1993. The new President of the European Monetary Institute (EMI) has suggested that a number of stringent non-monetary conditions must be met before there can be a return to narrow margins. While this list may be too comprehensive, the paper argues that there are also some monetary prerequisites which will be difficult to meet: at a minimum some mixture of less conditionality in interventions on behalf of <b>creditor</b> <b>central</b> <b>banks</b> and strong incentives for debtor <b>central</b> <b>banks</b> to raise interest rates to defend their currencies. The paper finds a continuation of wide margins for most of the transition realistic. Such a scenario might have certain advantages in relation to the transition to monetary union, provided participants continue to value exchange rate stability highly. In the second part the specific role of the EMI is reviewed. To the extent that the EMI President, the Director-General and other senior members of the staff succeed in taking charge of the work in the Council, The Alternates' Committee and the various writing groups monetary coordination and the preparations for full monetary union should be enhanced. The latter would also be helped if the EMI were to be given some operational functions beyond the passive holding and managing of internaitonal reserves specifically mentioned in the Treaty. An operational role also in domestic money market operations and in clearing in the ecu market appears desirable. ...|$|R
40|$|If {{interest}} rates (country spreads) rise, debt can rapidly {{be subject to}} a snowball effect, which becomes self-fulfilling with regard to the fundamentals themselves. This is a market imperfection, because we cannot be confident that the unaided market will choose the "good" over the "bad" equilibrium. We propose a policy intervention to deal with this structural weakness in the mechanisms of international capital flows. This is based on a simple taxonomy that breaks down the origin of crises into three components: confidence (spreads and currency crisis), fundamentals (real growth rate), and economic policy (primary deficit). Theory then suggests a set of circumstances in which a lender of first resort would be desirable. The policy would seek to short-circuit confidence crises, partly by using IMF support to improve ex ante incentives. Theory also illuminates the potential role of collective action clauses in reducing the risk of self-fulfilling debt crises.

40|$|We {{propose a}} {{modification}} to a baseline sovereign default framework {{that allows us}} to quantify the importance of debt dilution in accounting for the level and volatility of the interest rate spread paid by sovereigns. We measure the effects of debt dilution by comparing the simulations of the baseline model (with debt dilution) with the ones of the modified model without dilution. We calibrate the baseline model to mimic the mean and standard deviation of the spread, as well as the external debt level, the mean debt duration and a measure of default frequency in the data. We find that, even without commitment to future repayment policies and withoutcontingency of sovereign debt, if the sovereign could eliminate debt dilution, the number of default per 100 years decreases from 3. 10 to 0. 42. The mean spread decreases from 7. 38 % to 0. 57 %. The standard deviation of the spread decreases from 2. 45 to 0. 72. Default risk falls in part because of a reduction of the level of sovereign debt (36 % of the face value and of 11 % of the market value). But we show that the most important effect of dilution on default risk results from a shift in the set of government''s borrowing opportunities. Our analysis is also relevant for the study of other credit markets where the debt dilution problem could be present.

Although they account for the lion''s share of capital markets, regional public debt markets remain underdeveloped {{for a variety of}} reasons. The problems of small scale, dollarization, and weak public finances in many countries are compounded by poor structure and composition of debt (with sizeable nonstandard and non-tradable components), fragmentation of public debt between <b>central</b> <b>banks</b> and the sovereigns and across instruments, poor debt management practices, weaknesses in securities market, and small investor bases all of which result in high transaction costs and a lack of liquid benchmarks.

40|$|This article {{appeared}} in Strategic Insights (June 2003), v. 2 no. 6 The 1980 s began with Iraq recognized as {{being one of}} the most promising countries in the Middle East and in the developing world. It was a donor country as well as a significant international <b>creditor.</b> The <b>central</b> <b>bank</b> held approximately $ 36 billion in foreign assets (Jiyad, 2001, p. 15). Per capita income was around $ 4000 and, with a growing middle class and the start of a modern industrial sector, the country was poised for take-off to high-sustained growth. A plausible scenario at the time would have anticipated the country having a Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of close to $ 400 billion, with a per capita income of $ 15, 000, self sufficient in food, and an exporter of a wide variety of industrial products. Instead, Iraq sealed its demise in 1980 with its invasion of Iran. Two wars and a decade of sanctions later, GDP is not $ 400 billion but $ 30 billion [...] per capita income is $ 2000 at best. Industry has ceased to exist and unemployment is optimistically estimated to be around 50 %. This Strategic Insight examines Iraq's fiscal challenges and possible financial strategies over the next decade or so. What options are available under UN Resolution 1483 of May 23, 2003, as well as the resolutions coming out of the May 2003 G- 8 Finance Ministers' meetings?

40|$|Intercreditor equity {{represents}} one of the main objectives of bankruptcy proceedings. Yet, recent restructurings of sovereign debt suggest that violation of intercreditor equity is common. While existing contractual provisions, and guidelines issued by creditor committees, establish fundamental principles about creditor treatment, they seem to remain too vague to guide debt restructuring processes effectively. The paper focuses on distribution, and argues that lack of clear guidelines for distribution may complicate and delay the resolution process and induce undue uncertainty about the predictability and viability of the restructuring outcome.
