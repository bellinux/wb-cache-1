The calculation for determining PIR required finding the exact infrared (IR) peak heights for NR and SBR, at 1375 and 699 cm− 1, respectively. To obtain the exact peak heights, each of the spectra originally obtained from the IR spectrophotometer was modified using a newly developed numerical algorithmic method of baseline creation on and subsequent subtraction from the original spectrum.

40|$|In the paper, a {{combined}} numerical-experimental approach for {{the prediction of}} the activity of different peroxides at different vulcanization temperatures for EPM-EPDM rubber curing is proposed. Several experimental tests were conducted on the same recipe of an EPDM elastomer used in industry for medium and high voltage isolation cables, changing both peroxides used and controlled vulcanization temperature. In particular, test were conducted in a range temperature varying between 160 and 200 °C, with a 20 °C step, using different peroxides, changing their concentration and considering also a mixture of three of them. A huge amount of rheometric cure curves were obtained (one for each temperature, peroxide used and concentration) and quantitatively compared one each other, to have an insight into the most effective temperature and peroxide to use during such kind of vulcanization, {{in terms of both}} vulcanization velocity and maximum torque reached. In order to interpret theoretically experimental results obtained, a peroxide decomposition kinetic model is presented, considering the complex set of reactions that characterize peroxide crosslinking, namely homolytic cleavage of peroxide, hydrogen abstraction, polymer radicals formation, polymer radicals coupling, cross-link formation and polymer scission. Starting from the above -most probable- kinetic scheme, a system of non-linear differential equations with few variables is obtained and solved numerically, after suitable variable substitutions, by means of a Runge-Kutta algorithm. Crosslinking density is thus evaluated numerically and compared to rheometer experimental curve, which may provide a reliable indication of the average <b>cured</b> <b>rubber</b> crosslinking, once suitably scaled to unitary values. By means of the numerical approach proposed, an estimation of the kinetic constants per single reaction, once known kinetic decomposition laws, may be evaluated and hence the activity of each peroxide may be estimated using a few experimental data at only two different temperatures...|$|E

Styrene-butadiene rubber, synthetic polyisoprene rubber (IR), acrylonitrile-butadiene rubber, and natural rubber (NR) containing the same loading of a precipitated silica filler were prepared. The silica surface was pretreated with TESPT, which is a sulfur-bearing bifunctional organosilane to chemically bond silica to the rubber. The rubber compounds were subsequently cured by reacting the tetrasulfane groups of TESPT with double bonds in the rubber chains and the cure was optimized by adding sulfenamide accelerator and zinc oxide. The IR and NR needed more accelerators for curing. Surprisingly, there was no obvious correlation between the internal double bond content and the accelerator requirement for the optimum <b>cure</b> of the <b>rubbers.</b> Using the TESPT pretreated silanized silica was a very efficient method for cross-linking and reinforcing the rubbers.

In particular, tests are replicated in a temperature range between 160 and 200 degrees C, with data provided every 20 degrees C, using two different peroxides, a mixture of three commercial peroxides at five different concentrations. A huge amount of experimental data (cure curves) is obtained (one for each temperature, peroxide used and concentration) and results are critically compared one each other, to have a quantitative insight into the most effective temperature and peroxide to be used during this kind of vulcanization, {{with the aim of}} maximizing vulcanization velocity, final torque reached and mechanical properties of <b>cured</b> <b>rubber.</b> The comprehensive experimental study proposed is finally assessed from a numerical point of view, utilizing a complex kinetic scheme constituted by reactions occurring in series and parallel, which allows estimating numerically the vulcanization degree by means of a single second order nonlinear differential equation, with unknown parameters determined through non-linear least squares fitting, with target data represented by experimental rheoemeter curves.

30|$|The {{mixing of}} various kinds of {{polymers}} is a suitable method {{for the development of}} blends with characteristics better to those of the individual components. Properties of a polymeric blend or mixture depend mainly on the matrix phase (major component) but factors like amount, shape, size, and interfacial adhesion of the discontinue phase (minor component) also are important [1, 2, 3, 4]. The resulted binary blend of polypropylene (PP) and rubber component is called a thermoplastic elastomer (TPE). Thermoplastic elastomeric materials (TPEs) can be obtained from a blend of PP and various natural or synthetic types of rubbers. This kind of blend has the characteristics combination of thermoplastic and elastomeric phases [5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12] and it can be treated like thermoplastic materials. The majority of TPEs have non-uniform morphology. The TPEs based on rubber and thermoplastic compositions have been synthesized along two different procedures. One consists of a simple blend and the resulted mixture is called a thermoplastic elastomeric olefin (TPO). In the second procedure, the elastomeric phase is dynamically vulcanized, leading to a thermoplastic vulcanizates (TPVs) or also called dynamic vulcanizates (DVs). The TPVs are characterized by finely dispersed micron-sized cross-linked elastomeric particles distributed in a thermoplastic matrix [13]. The dynamic vulcanization operation makes the morphology of the material more stable. Consequently, a uniform and finer distribution of rubber particles in the thermoplastic matrix is obtained [14]. TPV procedure is based on the crosslinking of a rubber with cross-linking agents (sulfur or organic peroxide) to form a discontinuous phase of <b>cured</b> <b>rubber,</b> distributed in a continuous matrix of a thermoplastic [15]. The extensively used thermoplastic component is polypropylene (PP). PP has various applications due to its unique properties such as high melting temperature, low density, high chemical solvents and heat resistances. Furthermore, PP exhibits poor impact strength, which limits its applications. Different rubbers were blended with PP to prepare TPEs such as ethylene–propylene–diene rubber (EPDM), nitrile rubber (NBR), ethylene–propylene rubber (EPR), and rubber waste from truck and car tires [16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21].|$|E

Usage of natural rubber only to produce rubber products becomes disadvantages in economical and environmental aspect. It will be more efficient if the rubber is reinforced with filler as its additive without affecting its properties. Moreover, the increase interest in using natural fillers as reinforcement in natural rubber to substitute the conventional fillers {{has become one of}} the main concerns in nowadays. For this study natural rubber that been used is Standard Malaysian Rubber (SMR) while coconut fiber is the natural filler that being use to reinforced the SMR. The composite material using natural rubber and coconut filler are being done in two methods; first method is by mixing by using two roll mills to the natural rubber without any additional of fillers. The second method is to mix homogeneously the natural rubber with different loading (0 - 50 phr) of coconut fiber. Later chemical substances such as sulphur, softener, accelerator and etc were added using rolling process according to the formulation. The <b>cured</b> <b>rubber</b> is molded using hot press and sample is cut manually from the molded rubber for the testings. As the filler loading increases, the time consumed to blend the SMR and filler are getting long because the volume of coconut fiber is increasing. The mixing or rubber and other additive are also getting tougher as the filler loading increasing. The tensile strength is decreasing as the filler loading increases. Besides that, extension at break and time at break is decreasing when the filler loading is increasing. For swelling test, kerosene diffuse more than diesel in the reinforced rubber but decreasing as the filler loading increases. It is concluded that the new composite material using natural rubber and coconut filler giving less strength than using conventional filler.
