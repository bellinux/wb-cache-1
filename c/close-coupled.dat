40|$|We use three {{different}} implementations of the non-relativistic <b>close-coupling</b> method {{to investigate the}} convergence of theoretical predictions for electron scattering from magnesium at impact energies below 1 eV. It is found that the convergence of the <b>close-coupling</b> expansion is extremely slow, particularly for the L = 1 partial wave that is dominated by a shape-resonance common to many similar quasi-two-electron systems. An accurate prediction of the scattering length (we obtain − 2. 4 ± 0. 1 a 0) is also a nontrivial problem.

The computations involve determination and analytic fitting of a three-dimensional potential energy surface for the Li_ 2 Yb system and quantum dynamics calculations of varying complexities, ranging from exact quantum dynamics within the <b>close-coupling</b> scheme, to statistical quantum treatment, and universal models. It is demonstrated that the two simplified methods yield zero-temperature limiting reaction rate coefficients in reasonable agreement with the full <b>close-coupling</b> calculations. The effect of the three-body term in the interaction potential is explored by comparing quantum dynamics results from a pairwise potential that neglects the three-body term to that derived from the full interaction potential. Inclusion of the three-body term in the <b>close-coupling</b> calculations was found to reduce the limiting rate coefficients by a factor of two. The reaction exoergicity populates vibrational levels as high as v= 19 of the ^ 6 Li_ 2 molecule in the limit of zero collision energy. Product vibrational distributions from the <b>close-coupling</b> calculations reveal sensitivity to inclusion of three-body forces in the interaction potential. Overall, the results indicate that a simplified model based on the long-range potential is able to yield reliable values of the total reaction rate coefficient in the ultracold limit but a more rigorous approach based on statistical quantum or quantum <b>close-coupling</b> methods is desirable when product rovibrational distribution is required.
