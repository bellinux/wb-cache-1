50|$|In {{breeding}} plumage (February-July), the male has a slight orange-scarlet colored crest. The eyebrow {{and around the}} eye is golden yellow tinged with red. The cheeks, ear coverts and sides of the neck are olive-yellow. The chin and upper throat are <b>orange</b> <b>chrome,</b> melting into golden yellow chest. The sides of the chest and the upper sides are yellow-olive. The rear flanks and belly are pale yellow. The tips of the tail and wing feathers are white but worn. Year round, the iris is brown to dark brown, the bill dark blue-gray with a darker tip. Legs and feet are dark blue-gray. The underwing coverts are white with a yellow fringe tip.|$|R
30|$|Letter 668, to Theo van Gogh, 23 or 24 August 1888 “Would you ask Tasset {{his opinion}} on the {{following}} question? It {{seems to me that}} the more finely a colour is ground, the more it is saturated by oil. Now we’re not over-fond of oil, that goes without saying. If we painted like Monsieur Gérôme and the other trompe-l’oeil photographic ones, we’d no doubt ask for colours ground very fine. We, on the contrary, don’t strongly object to the canvas having a rough look. So if instead of having the colour ground on the stone for God knows how many hours, we grind it just long enough to make it workable, without bothering too much about the fineness of the grain, we’d have colours that were fresher, perhaps darkening less. If he wishes to do a test with the 3 <b>chromes,</b> Veronese, vermilion, <b>orange</b> lead, cobalt, ultramarine, I’m almost certain that at greatly reduced cost I would have colours that were both fresher and longer-lasting”.|$|R
5000|$|The size of {{the shell}} varies between 33 mm and 55 mm.The imperforate, orange-rose shell is conically turbinated. The whorls are convexly sloping, then encircled with two rows of scales, {{papillary}} grained throughout. The base of the shell is rather flat, tinged with <b>chrome</b> <b>orange.</b>|$|E

50|$|Minium and {{massicot}} {{are bright}} yellow and orange pigments made since ancient times by heating lead oxide and its variants. Minium {{was used in}} the Byzantine Empire for making the red-orange colour on illuminated manuscripts, while massicot was used by ancient Egyptian scribes and in the Middle Ages. Both were toxic, and were replaced {{in the beginning of the}} 20th century by <b>chrome</b> <b>orange</b> and cadmium orange.|$|E
50|$|Orange {{and blue}} became an {{important}} combination for all the impressionist painters. They all had studied the recent books on color theory, {{and they know that}} orange placed next to blue made both colors much brighter. Auguste Renoir painted boats with stripes of <b>chrome</b> <b>orange</b> paint straight from the tube. Paul Cézanne used orange made of touches of yellow, red and ochre against a blue background.|$|E
50|$|Anomochilus monticola grow to {{at least}} 509 mm in snout-vent length. Head is not {{distinct}} from the stout body. The eyes are small, 1.2 mm in diameter. Tail is short, just 11 - 13 mm. The body has iridescent blue black ground colour. The dorsum is largely uniform in colour, {{but there is a}} pale horn coloured transverse bar across the snout. Ventrally, there are series of large pale horn coloured blotches. <b>Chrome</b> <b>orange</b> band encircles the tail base.|$|E
50|$|The {{colors in}} greater areas of this {{painting}} are generally subdued and executed in ochres or in mixtures of several pigments. The dark green foliage {{in the upper}} part contains a glaze of emerald green and Scheele's green mixed with yellow lake with small addition of ivory black and yellow ochre. The strong colourful accents in the bonets and clothes of the children are painted in almost pure pigments such as cobalt blue, vermilion or <b>chrome</b> <b>orange.</b>|$|E
50|$|In 1797 a French {{scientist}} Louis Vauquelin {{discovered the}} mineral crocoite, or lead chromate, which led in 1809 to {{the invention of}} the synthetic pigment <b>chrome</b> <b>orange.</b> Other synthetic pigments, cobalt red, cobalt yellow, and cobalt orange, the last made from cadmium sulfide plus cadmium selenide, soon followed. These new pigments, plus {{the invention of the}} metal paint tube in 1841, made it possible for artists to paint outdoors and to capture the colours of natural light.|$|E
50|$|Orange {{became an}} {{important}} colour for all the impressionist painters. They all had studied the recent books on colour theory, {{and they know that}} orange placed next to azure blue made both colours much brighter. Auguste Renoir painted boats with stripes of <b>chrome</b> <b>orange</b> paint straight from the tube. Paul Cézanne did not use orange pigment, but created his own oranges with touches of yellow, red and ochre against a blue background. Toulouse-Lautrec often used oranges in the skirts of dancers and gowns of Parisiennes in the cafes and clubs he portrayed. For him it was the colour of festivity and amusement.|$|E
50|$|Dunn's spinytail lizard (Morunasaurus groi) is a hoplocercid lizard {{found in}} northwestern South America and Panama. Its tail {{is covered with}} small spines. Males are reddish-brown with dark brown {{transverse}} bands across the back, reaching {{to the middle of}} the sides and then breaking up into small, irregular dark spots. Small white spots occur between the dark bands above the first longitudinal row of tubercles. The neck is red, with an incomplete white collar three to five scales wide, extending somewhat obliquely from just ahead of the forearm upward to the scapular region; the collar is edged on both sides by dark brown. The head is reddish and the chin and infralabial region scarlet red. The gular area is dark grayish-brown, the chest is pale <b>chrome</b> <b>orange,</b> and the belly is dirty white. Adult females are essentially the same color, lacking the scarlet red in the infralabial region, and the belly is yellow.|$|E
30|$|It is {{possible}} to also discern a few individual flame details painted with a mid-tone orange, that show specifically both lead (Pb)and chromium (Cr) signals, suggesting the use of <b>chrome</b> <b>orange.</b> Finally {{there are a few}} last touches containing iron, likely to have been painted with an iron oxide red (Fe).|$|E
