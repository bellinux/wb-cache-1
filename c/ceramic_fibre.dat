New types of <b>ceramic</b> <b>fibres</b> usually are incorporated into a metal matrix by means of liquid infiltration or by hot pressing techniques.

40|$|Purpose: The aim of {{this study}} is an {{investigation}} and comparison of mechanical properties of <b>ceramic</b> <b>fibres</b> after they were influenced by temperature and plasma treatment. Design/methodology/approach: Single filament after being processed at different temperatures (200 oC, 400 oC, 700 oC and 1000 oC) and methane plasma treatment was separated with a magnifier, prepared on a punched mounting tab, and was evaluated in accordance with Japanese Industrial Standard.

40|$|OBJECTIVES [...] To {{study the}} {{relation}} between occupational exposure to <b>ceramic</b> <b>fibres</b> during manufacture and respiratory health. METHODS [...] The respiratory health of 628 current employees {{in the manufacture of}} <b>ceramic</b> <b>fibres</b> in seven European plants in three countries was studied with a respiratory questionnaire, lung function tests, and chest radiography. Simultaneous plant hygiene surveys measured subjects' current exposure to airborne <b>ceramic</b> <b>fibres</b> from personal samples with optical microscopy fibre counts. The measured exposures were combined with occupational histories to derive estimates of each subject's cumulative exposure to respirable fibres. Symptoms were related to current and cumulative exposure to <b>ceramic</b> <b>fibres</b> and lung function and findings from chest radiographs were related to cumulative exposure. RESULTS [...] The mean duration of employment was 10. 2 years and mean (range) cumulative exposure was 3. 84 (0 - 22. 94) (f. ml- 1. y). Eye and skin symptoms were frequent in all plants and increased significantly, as did breathlessness and wheeze, with increasing current exposure. Dry cough and stuffy nose were less common in the least exposed group but did not increase with increasing exposure. After adjustment for the effects of age, sex, height, smoking, and past occupational exposures to respiratory hazards, there was a significant decrease in both forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1) and forced midexpiratory flow related to cumulative exposure in current smokers (P < 0. 05) and in FEV 1 in ex-smokers (P < 0. 05). Small opacities were found in 13 % of the chest radiographs; their prevalence was not related to cumulative exposure to <b>ceramic</b> <b>fibres.</b> CONCLUSIONS [...] It is concluded that exposure to <b>ceramic</b> <b>fibres</b> is associated with irritant symptoms similar to those seen in other exposures to man made mineral fibres (MMMFs) and that cumulative exposure to respirable <b>ceramic</b> <b>fibres</b> may cause airways obstruction by promoting the effects of cigarette smoke...|$|R

50|$|In concept, it {{is simple}} to devise systems that will pass the test. As {{far back as}} the 1970s, it was {{apparent}} that when one uses enough high temperature qualified insulation, such as <b>ceramic</b> <b>fibre,</b> one is assured of a rating. However, this comes at the price of significant ampacity derating. Also, the concept that more fireproofing is better, was defeated by industry tests of Thermo-lag 330-1 (which is not a fibrous insulation). No matter what was done to this material (used for fireproofing purposes over electrical circuits in full scale fire testing) by various nuclear power plant owners (USNRC licensees) who sponsored extensive testing, where more of the old Thermo-lag was applied onto the older substrate, no satisfactory results were achieved. In order for licensees to come into compliance, other methods, replacements, overlays and MI Cable were used to fix the problem. Also, since the forerunner of this testing was the USNRC, and the commercial version of it (UL1724) has undergone various revisions, the UL systems listed in the UL Building Materials directory are not necessarily qualified to the latest USNRC compliant or the latest UL version.

40|$|Here the sol-gel {{technique}} was {{employed in the}} production of ultra-high temperature <b>ceramic</b> <b>fibres,</b> utilising forcespinning as the major fibre forming technique. The ultra-high temperature <b>ceramic</b> <b>fibres</b> produced in this work were titanium carbide, zirconium carbide, titanium diboride and zirconium diboride. These were achieved after a series of heat treatment steps from the fibres produced via forcespinning. Upon the production of ultra-high temperature <b>ceramic</b> <b>fibres</b> these were densified via various means such as elevated heat treatments or infiltration. Finally the production of ceramic matrix composites with fibres originating from sol-gel was attempted. Sol-gel was chosen as the means to produced ultra-high temperature <b>ceramic</b> <b>fibres</b> due to its characteristics of nano-scale mixing and it being a liquid based processing technique. The nano-scale mixing allowed the chemicals employed here, namely metal alkoxides (metal oxide source) and furfuryl alcohol (carbon source), to mix homogenously and subsequently produce metal oxide and carbon fibres with good microstructures upon heat treatments. The formation and variation of these sol-gel solutions to produce titanium carbide and zirconium carbide precursor fibres was a strong focus of the work undertaken here, with influence of acids and acetylacetone examined. With acid being shown to accelerate the hydrolysis and condensation reactions in the sol-gel system and acetylacetone being a suitable means to control this acceleration. In conjunction with this the effects of varying sol-gel variables such as furfuryl alcohol were discussed, with furfuryl alcohol content being a suitable means to control the final carbon content in the fibres produced. With the production of a sol-gel solution capable of being formed into fibres, the examination of techniques to do as such was examined. Techniques examined here were electrospinning and forcespinning, with the forcespinning technique being chosen due to its greater production rate. Therefore the variation of forcespinning variables was examined, with it being found that variables that aided {{in the production of}} drier fibres upon collection resulted in superior fibre morphologies. These variables included the choice of spinneret, revolutions per minute of the spinneret and collector distance. Upon forcespinning, the resultant fibres are polymeric in nature, therefore for the production of ultra-high temperature <b>ceramic</b> <b>fibres</b> heat treatments are required. Here the role heat treatments play in the pyrolysis of fibres, carbothermal reduction of the fibres, densification of the fibres and phase changes of the fibres is discussed. This is in conjunction with other variables, such as the carbon content of the fibres undergoing heat treatment and the sintering temperature used. It was discovered that with the correct starting fibres (ones with suitable carbon content) the formation of titanium carbide and zirconium carbide fibres was possible. Furthermore, with elevated sintering temperatures up to 2000 °C, dense titanium carbide fibres are able to be produced. However zirconium carbide fibres still contain some porosity even up to 2300 °C. Here the use of sintering additives (boron nitride) is also discussed, with it being shown that the use of sintering additives allows the production of titanium diboride and zirconium diboride fibres. The formation of these fibres is investigated with the aid of thermodynamics and the investigation of numerous variables such as sintering temperature and time. Through this investigation it was found that to produce fibres that contain predominately titanium diboride or zirconium diboride phase, reduced sintering temperature and hold times were beneficial. With the production of dense ultra-high temperature <b>ceramic</b> <b>fibres,</b> the final topic investigated was the possibility of using these ultra-high temperature <b>ceramic</b> <b>fibres,</b> originating from sol-gel, in ceramic matrix composites. As such ultra-high temperature <b>ceramic</b> <b>fibres</b> were added into matrix materials of either zirconium diboride or silicon carbide. The ability to add a carbon layer onto fibres was also investigate as a means to improve the efficiency of the fibres, by means of coating with furfuryl alcohol. This method proved problematic due to the general loss of fibre morphology upon the coating process. The ceramic matrix composites were sintered via spark plasma sintering and underwent Vickers hardness testing. The cracks introduced via this testing were subsequently examined via scanning electron microscopy, and possible fibre/crack interactions are shown...|$|R
