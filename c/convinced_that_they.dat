5|$|Because the {{faithful}} {{are obliged to}} attend Mass {{unless there is a}} grave impediment, pastors have the corresponding duty to offer everyone the real possibility of fulfilling the precept.... Yet more than a precept, the observance should be seen as a need rising from the depths of Christian life. It is crucially important that all {{the faithful}} should be <b>convinced</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> cannot live their faith or share fully {{in the life of the}} Christian community unless they take part regularly in the Sunday Eucharistic assembly.|$|E

5|$|However, Prime Minister Churchill was not {{satisfied}} with Ironside's progress, {{especially with regard to}} the creation of a mobile reserve. Anthony Eden, the Secretary of State for War, suggested that Ironside should be replaced by General Brooke (later Viscount Alanbrooke). On 17 July 1940 Churchill spent an afternoon with Brooke and was soon <b>convinced</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were in close agreement as to how best to defend the nation. On 19 July Brooke replaced Ironside.|$|E
5|$|Parsons and Cameron {{decided to}} travel to Mexico for a few months, both for a {{vacation}} and for Parsons {{to take up a}} job opportunity establishing an explosives factory for the Mexican government. They hoped that this would facilitate a move to Israel, where they could start a family, and where Parsons could bypass the U.S. government to recommence his rocketry career. He was particularly disturbed by the presence of the FBI, <b>convinced</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were spying on him.|$|E
5|$|On August28, 1869, {{three men}} deserted the expedition, <b>convinced</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> could not {{possibly}} survive the trip through the Grand Canyon. They were killed by Native Americans after {{making it to the}} rim of the canyon; two days later, the expedition ran the last of the Grand Canyon rapids and reached St. Thomas. Powell led a second expedition in 1871, this time with financial backing from the U.S. government. The explorers named many features along the Colorado and Green rivers, including Glen Canyon, the Dirty Devil River, Flaming Gorge, and the Gates of Lodore. In what is perhaps a twist of irony, modern-day Lake Powell, which floods Glen Canyon, is also named for their leader.|$|E

5|$|Following Charan Singh's resignation, Reddy summoned Chandrashekhar and Jagjivan Ram to Rashtrapati Bhavan to {{look into}} the {{possibility}} of forming an alternate government. Reddy, <b>convinced</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> {{would not be able to}} form one, accepted Singh's advice and dissolved Lok Sabha, calling for a mid term election. Singh was asked to continue as the caretaker prime minister till a new government was sworn in after the election. Reddy's decision was met with angry denunciations and protests by members of the Janata Party who even threatened to have him impeached. Although heading a caretaker government, Singh proposed as many as seven ordinances on a broad range of matters from effecting changes in company law, providing state funding of elections and reservation of jobs for the backward classes. Reddy however refused to promulgate the ordinances arguing that such momentous changes could not be made by a caretaker government.|$|E
5|$|In April 1948 he {{once again}} {{travelled}} with England to Hampden Park, helping his country to a 2–0 victory; however after the match {{he was the}} subject of an FA inquiry after he claimed tea and scones on his expenses (at the cost of sixpence). Regardless of this treatment by the FA, the next month he helped England record a 4–0 victory over Italy in Turin. Folklore told that he beat Alberto Eliani only to have the audacity to then pull a comb from his shorts pocket and comb his hair; the reality was that he simply used his hand to wipe his sweating brow in the beating Italian sun. However the legend would follow him around the world in later life, and spectators in the crowd were <b>convinced</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> had witnessed it. Later in the year he played in a goalless draw with Denmark, a 6–2 win over Northern Ireland, a 1–0 win over Wales, and a 6–0 triumph over Switzerland.|$|E
5|$|Madeline Sylvia Royals {{was born}} on 8 January 1910 in Blackpool, Lancashire. Little is known of her early life, which coincided with Britain's {{involvement}} in the First World War, although she appears {{to have had a}} strained relationship with her parents. Her father, Willie Royals, was an insurance agent, while her mother, Marion Neruda Shaw, was a tailor's daughter from Oldham. Willie and Marion had married on 28 June 1909, followed by Madeline's birth seven months later. In early life, Madeline was afflicted with polio, resulting in a lifelong withered leg and limp. Bedridden for the course of the illness, she read literature to entertain herself, enjoying the works of Edward Bulwer-Lytton, H.Rider Haggard and E.T.A. Hoffman. She also read the Bible in her youth, becoming particularly enamored with the texts of the Old Testament, and was <b>convinced</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> contained secret messages, a theme that became a central tenet of her later Luciferian beliefs.|$|E

5|$|Szilárd {{teamed up}} with Fermi {{to build a nuclear}} reactor from natural uranium at Columbia University, where they were {{fortunate}} in having a sympathetic head of the physics department in George B. Pegram. At the time there was disagreement about whether it was uranium-235, which made up less than 1% of natural uranium, or the more abundant uranium-238 isotope, as Fermi maintained, that was primarily responsible for fission. Fermi and Szilárd conducted a series of experiments, and concluded that a chain reaction in natural uranium could be possible if they could find a suitable neutron moderator. They found that the hydrogen atoms in water slowed neutrons, but tended to capture them. Szilárd then suggested using carbon as a moderator. They now needed large quantities of carbon and uranium to create a reactor. Szilárd was <b>convinced</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> would succeed if only they could get the materials.|$|E
5|$|The {{question}} {{who shot}} down Sayn-Wittgenstein is unanswered. Friedrich Ostheimer remained <b>convinced</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> {{were shot down}} by a long range intruder de Havilland Mosquito night fighter. However, no Mosquito pilot claimed an aerial victory that night. A closer analysis reveals that three Mosquitos, two Serrate-equipped aircraft from No. 141 Squadron RAF and one from No. 239 Squadron RAF, participated in the attacks on Magdeburg. Only one Mosquito had enemy contact: No. 141's squadron Mosquito F.II, DZ303, piloted by Pilot Officer Desmon Snape with Flying Officer L. Fowler as his radar operator reported radar contact at 23:15south of Brandenburg. After three to four minutes of pursuit they encountered a Ju 88with its position lights on. They attacked the Ju 88and believed to have damaged it behind its cockpit, {{but they did not}} claim a victory. This encounter exactly matches the time and area in which Sayn-Wittgenstein was killed.|$|E
5|$|Zwingli {{accepted}} Philip's invitation fully {{believing that}} {{he would be able to}} convince Luther. By contrast, Luther did not expect anything to come out of the meeting and had to be urged by Philip to attend. Zwingli, accompanied by Oecolampadius, arrived on 28 September 1529 with Luther and Philipp Melanchthon arriving shortly thereafter. Other theologians also participated including Martin Bucer, Andreas Osiander, Johannes Brenz, and Justus Jonas. The debates were held from 1–3 October and the results were published in the fifteen Marburg Articles. The participants were able to agree on fourteen of the articles, but the fifteenth article established the differences in their views on the presence of Christ in the eucharist. Afterwards, each side was <b>convinced</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were the victors, but in fact the controversy was not resolved and the final result was the formation of two different Protestant confessions.|$|E

5|$|The German crusaders, {{accompanied}} by the papal legate and cardinal Theodwin, intended to meet the French in Constantinople. Ottokar III of Styria joined Conrad at Vienna, and Conrad's enemy Géza II of Hungary allowed them to pass through unharmed. When the German army of 20,000 men arrived in Byzantine territory, Emperor Manuel I Komnenos feared {{they were going to}} attack him, and Byzantine troops were posted to ensure that there was no trouble. There was a brief skirmish with some of the more unruly Germans near Philippopolis and in Adrianople, where the Byzantine general Prosouch fought with Conrad's nephew, the future emperor Frederick. To make matters worse, some of the German soldiers were killed in a flood at the beginning of September. On 10 September, however, they arrived at Constantinople, where relations with Manuel were poor, resulting in a battle, after which the Germans were <b>convinced</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> should cross into Asia Minor as quickly as possible. Manuel wanted Conrad to leave some of his troops behind, to assist in defending against attacks from Roger II, who had taken the opportunity to plunder the cities of Greece, but Conrad did not agree, despite being a fellow enemy of Roger.|$|E

The Dutch convinced Kongo to join them and Queen Njinga in another venture against the Portuguese. In 1647, Kongo troops participated in the Battle of Kombi, where they soundly defeated the Portuguese field army, after forcing them to fight defensively.|$|E

25|$|The {{timing of}} their attack was {{carefully}} planned. After successfully asking a large Herero clan to surrender their weapons, Governor Leutwein was <b>convinced</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> {{and the rest}} of the native population were essentially pacified and so withdrew half of the German troops stationed in his colony. Led by Chief Samuel Maharero, the Herero surrounded Okahandja and cut links to Windhoek, the colonial capital. Maharero then issued a manifesto in which he forbade his troops to kill any Englishmen, Boers, uninvolved peoples, women and children in general, or German missionaries.|$|E
25|$|In {{spite of}} Johnston being {{resident}} {{in a mental}} hospital at the time, there was a bidding war to sign him. He refused to sign a multi-album deal with Elektra Records because Metallica was on the label's roster and he was <b>convinced</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were of Satan and would hurt him. He also dropped his manager after having a psychotic episode at a Butthole Surfers concert. Ultimately he signed with Atlantic Records in February 1994 and that September released Fun, produced by Paul Leary of Butthole Surfers. It was a commercial failure. In June 1996, Atlantic dropped Daniel from the label.|$|E
