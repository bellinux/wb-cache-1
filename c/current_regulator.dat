50|$|Pre-charging is {{commonly}} used in battery electric vehicle applications. The current to the motor is regulated by a controller that employs large capacitors in its input circuit. Such systems typically have contactors (a high-current relay) to disable the system during inactive periods and {{to act as an}} emergency disconnect should the motor <b>current</b> <b>regulator</b> fail in an active state. Without pre-charge the high voltage across the contactors and inrush current can cause a brief arc which will cause pitting of the contacts. Pre-charging the controller input capacitors (typically to 90 to 95 percent of applied battery voltage) eliminates the pitting problem. The current to maintain the charge is so low that some systems apply the pre-charge at all times other than when charging batteries, while more complex systems apply pre-charge as part of the starting sequence and will defer main contactor closure until the pre-charge voltage level is detected as sufficiently high.|$|E

50|$|To {{avoid having}} {{the entire system}} go dark if a single lamp burned out, each street lamp was {{equipped}} with a device that ensured that the circuit would remain intact. Early series street lights were equipped with isolation transformers. that would allow current to pass across the transformer whether the bulb worked or not. Later the film cutout was invented. The film cutout was a small disk of insulating film that separated two contacts connected to the two wires leading to the lamp. If the lamp failed (an open circuit), the current through the string became zero, causing the voltage of the circuit (thousands of volts) to be imposed across the insulating film, penetrating it (see Ohm's law). In this way, the failed lamp was bypassed and power restored {{to the rest of}} the district. The street light circuit contained an automatic <b>current</b> <b>regulator,</b> preventing the current from increasing as lamps burned out, preserving the life of the remaining lamps. When the failed lamp was replaced, a new piece of film was installed, once again separating the contacts in the cutout. This system was recognizable by the large porcelain insulator separating the lamp and reflector from the mounting arm. This was necessary because the two contacts in the lamp's base may have operated at several thousand volts above ground/earth.|$|E
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaf [72]) The {{development and}} analysis of an asynchronous <b>current</b> <b>regulator</b> for a variable-speed induction motor controller is presented in this thesis. An asynchronous <b>current</b> <b>regulator</b> has a sampling time which is not fixed to the PWM waveform of the motor controller. This asynchronous aspect would offer an operator the ability to change the PWM frequency of the motor controller to almost any desired frequency. Typical mid- to high-performance currentregulated motor controllers operate with a synchronous <b>current</b> <b>regulator</b> which allows only a few fixed PWM frequencies for a given sampling time. A synchronous <b>current</b> <b>regulator</b> was first analyzed and simulated to provide a properly tuned system which {{would make a good}} baseline regulator. This synchronous system was modified to operate with the sampling time no longer fixed with the PWM waveform. The effects of this mode of operation were oscillations in both the torque and flux currents as well as a slight increase in overshoot in the step response. An asynchronous <b>current</b> <b>regulator</b> was then developed and simulated allowing the selection of any PWM frequency for a given sampling time. At the heart of this new regulator is a PWM phase-angle compensation algorithm which was developed to minimize the oscillations caused by asynchronous operation. Simulations of this asynchronous implementation show that any choice of PWM frequency can be selected with negligible loss in response and significantly less ripple as opposed to the response of a typical synchronous <b>current</b> <b>regulator.</b> M.

30|$|In this paper, the {{interaction}} of phase-locked loop (PLL) dynamics and the <b>current</b> <b>regulator</b> on system stability has been investigated for active damped LCL-filter-based grid-connected inverters with capacitor voltage feedback under weak grid conditions. To efficiently model the system including the PLL dynamics, an equivalent Norton model was applied to obtain the closed-loop transfer function of the whole system. By investigating the poles of the transfer function, {{it has been found}} that the system tends to be instable as the PLL bandwidth increases with a fixed <b>current</b> <b>regulator</b> gain. Also, when the PLL bandwidth is fixed, the system tends to be instable as the <b>current</b> <b>regulator</b> gain decreases. The ranges of stability of the PLL bandwidth and the <b>current</b> <b>regulator</b> gain have been identified. The effectiveness of the designed active damping control method has been verified by both simulations and experimental results using a three-phase grid-connected inverter system. Future research can include stability analysis with a low sampling frequency under different control and operating modes.|$|E

40|$|One {{traditional}} low-cost way {{of driving}} LED in electrical applications uses a resistor {{in series with}} the LED device. Although this driving scheme is simple and inexpensive, it suffers several disadvantages. The LED current can vary substantially over the battery voltage range even in normal operation of the device, thus affecting the brightness and reducing the service life of the lighting device. Additionally, protection is needed from automotive voltage transients and reverse polarity. These disadvantages are typically resolved by using constant-current linear regulators. Besides driving the LED at a programmed <b>current,</b> these <b>regulators</b> can inherently protect from a reverse-polarity application and block voltage transients up to tens of volts. Linear <b>current</b> <b>regulators</b> do not require input EMI filters and can yield inexpensive LED driver solutions. However, both the resistor ballasts and the linear regulators exhibit low efficiency. They may become impractical for driving high-brightness LED loads due to the excessive heat dissipation.
