5000|$|There are {{two main}} {{techniques}} controllers use to organize flight progress strips in order to best detect conflicts: grouped together by altitude, or grouped together by route intersection points (fix posting area). Altitude grouping is the easiest and most common method when most aircraft in the sector tend to be level at a cruising altitude, such as in trans-oceanic sectors. Each aircraft's strip is placed in a [...] "bay" [...] (labeled section of the strip rack) depending on its altitude. Because aircraft cruising at different altitudes will never conflict regardless of route of flight or estimated times, they don't need to be checked against each other. Only aircraft at the same altitude (i.e. in the same bay) need to be further evaluated. If an aircraft needs to transition to a new altitude (whether changing <b>cruising</b> <b>level,</b> or descending to or climbing from an airport), it only needs to be checked against others in the bays between the current altitude and destination altitude.|$|E

He discussed, in detail, the relative ease with which the U.S. government could build a tube shuttle system using technologies available at that time. Maglev being poorly developed at the time, he proposed steel wheels. The chamber's door to the tube would be opened, and enough air admitted behind to accelerate the train into the tube. Gravity would further accelerate the departing train down to <b>cruise</b> <b>level.</b> Rising from <b>cruise</b> <b>level,</b> the arriving train would decelerate by compressing the rarefied air ahead of it, which would be vented. Pumps at the stations would make up for losses due to friction or air escaping {{around the edges of}} the train, the train itself requiring no motor. This combination of modified (shallow) gravity train and atmospheric railway propulsion would consume little energy but limit the system to subsonic speeds, hence initial routes of tens or hundreds of miles or kilometers rather than transcontinental distances were proposed.|$|R

While the possible climate impact of exhaust contrails has been studied for many years, research on aerodynamic contrails began {{only a few years}} ago and nothing is known about a possible contribution of these ice clouds to climate impact.

40|$|A {{class of}} {{strategies}} {{has been proposed}} to reduce contrail formation in the United States airspace. A 3 D grid based on weather data and the cruising altitude level of aircraft is adjusted to avoid the persistent contrail potential area with the consideration to fuel-efficiency. In this paper, the authors introduce a contrail avoidance strategy on 3 D grid by considering additional operationally feasible constraints from an air traffic controller's aspect. First, shifting too many aircraft to the same <b>cruising</b> <b>level</b> will make the miles-in-trail at this level smaller than the safety separation threshold. Furthermore, the high density of aircraft at one <b>cruising</b> <b>level</b> may exceed the workload for the traffic controller. Therefore, in our new model we restrict the number of total aircraft at each level. Second, the aircraft count variation for successive intervals cannot be too drastic since the workload to manage climbing/descending aircraft is much larger than managing cruising aircraft. The contrail reduction is formulated as an integer-programming problem {{and the problem is}} shown to have the property of total unimodularity. Solving the corresponding relaxed linear programming with the simplex method provides an optimal and integral solution to the problem. Simulation results are provided to illustrate the methodology...|$|E
40|$|During a ferry flight, in a {{standard}} operation condition and at <b>cruising</b> <b>level,</b> a military cargo experienced a double hydraulic system failure due to a structural damage of the dual booster actuator. The booster actuator is the main component in mechanism of aileron’s deflection. The crew was able to arrange an emergency landing thanks to the spare oil onboard: load specialists refilled the hydraulic reservoirs. Due to safety concerns {{and in order to}} prevent the possibility of other similar incidents, a technical investigation took place. The study aimed to carry out the analysis of root causes of the actuator failure. The Booster actuator is composed mainly by the piston rod and its aluminum external case (AA 7049). The assembly has two bronze caps on both ends. These are fixed in position by means of two retainers. At one end of the actuator case is placed a trunnion: a cylindrical protrusion used as a pivoting point on the aircraft. The fracture was located {{at one end of the}} case, on the trunnion side, in correspondence to the cap and over the retainer. One of the two fracture surfaces was found separated to the case and with the cap entangled inside. The fracture surfaces of the external case indicated fatigue crack growth followed by ductile separation. The failure analysis was performed by means of optical, metallographic, digital and electronic microscopy. The collected evidences showed a multiple initiation fracture mechanism. Moreover, 3 D scanner reconstruction and numerical simulation demonstrated that dimensional non conformances and thermal loads caused an abnormal stress concentration. Stress concentration was located along the case assy outer surface where the fatigue crack originated. The progressive rupture mechanism grew under cyclical axial load due to the normal operations. Recommendations were issued in order to improve dimensional controls and assembly procedures during production and overhaul activities...|$|E

In case of the combined fleet, part of the subsonic fleet is replaced by supersonic aircraft. Supersonic aircraft fly at higher <b>cruise</b> <b>levels</b> (18 to 20 km) than subsonic aircraft (10 to 12 km).

Total contrail coverage is only marginally affected by the shift in flight altitude. The model simulations indicate a global annual mean contrail cover of 0. 372 % for the subsonic and 0. 366 % for the combined fleet in 2050, respectively. The simulated contrail radiative forcing is most closely correlated to the total contrail cover, although contrails in the tropical lower stratosphere are found to be optically thinner than contrails in the extratropical upper troposphere.

A reduced supersonic cruise speed (Mach 1. 6 instead of Mach 2. 0) leads to a downward shift in contrail cover, but does not affect global mean total contrail cover and contrail radiative forcing.

40|$|Aerodynamic {{contrails}} {{have been}} recognized {{for a long time}} although they appear sporadically. Usually one observes them under humid conditions near the ground, where they are short-lived phenomena. Aerodynamic contrails appear also at <b>cruise</b> <b>levels</b> where they may persist when the ambient atmosphere is ice supersaturated. The present paper presents a theoretical investigation of aerodynamic contrails in the upper troposphere. The required flow physics are explained and applied to a case study. Results show that the flow over aircraft wings leads to large variations of pressure and temperature. Average pressure differences between the upper and lower sides of a wing are on the order of 50 hPa, which is a quite substantial fraction of cruise-level atmospheric pressures. Adiabatic cooling exceeds 20 K about 2 m above the wing in a case study shown here. Accordingly, extremely high supersaturations (exceeding 1000 %) occur for a fraction of a second. The potential consequences for the ice microphysics are discussed.

Traditionally, aircraft descend from <b>cruise</b> <b>level</b> towards the aerodrome in a stepped manner as directed by Air Traffic Control to ensure safe separation between aircraft, particularly in the terminal area. A descent methodology that is now being preferred is that of optimised profile descents (OPD). In OPDs, the aircraft descends from the top-of-descent (TOD) point towards the aerodrome following a smooth, continuous descent profile that is optimal from an operational perspective of choice, until it intersects the final approach glide path such as that of the Instrument Landing System (ILS). OPDs are advantageous because they consume less fuel and generate fewer emissions than their stepped counterparts. This paper presents a proposal of new approach procedures for use in the approaches to Malta International Airport (MIA) that will facilitate the introduction of OPDs. With around 28, 000 aircraft movements per annum at MIA, this can be achieved by giving Air Traffic Control Officers (ATCOs) a selection of approach procedures on which to direct in-trail inbound and outbound aircraft without imposing altitude constraints.

Satellite cloud-drift winds are numerous, but they have fairly large errors due to inaccurate height assignment. In such a framework, Doppler wind lidar offers a great opportunity to measure the wind field either globally with a polar-orbiting satellite or regionally when mounted on aircraft. During the Atlantic THORPEX Regional Campaign (A-TReC) in autumn 2003, the airborne Doppler lidar of the Deutsches Zentrum für Luft- und Raumfahrt (DLR) was used to observe wind profiles over the Atlantic Ocean. In eight flights, the system measured a total of 1, 600 profiles that were used experimentally in the global assimilation system at ECMWF.

Furthermore, forecast errors of wind, temperature and humidity fields over Europe were reduced. This is a promising result, considering that observations have been gathered from only 28. 5 flight hours in a two-week period. Dropsondes released in the same area where the Doppler lidar was operating showed good agreement in terms ofmeasured winds, but smaller analysis impact and less reduction of the forecast error.
