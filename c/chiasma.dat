25|$|Visual {{information}} is {{then sent to}} the brain from retinal ganglion cells via the optic nerve to the optic chiasma: {{a point where the}} two optic nerves meet and information from the temporal (contralateral) visual field crosses {{to the other side of}} the brain. After the optic <b>chiasma</b> the visual tracts are referred to as the optic tracts, which enter the thalamus to synapse at the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN).|$|E
25|$|A {{bivalent}} is {{the association}} of two replicated homologous chromosomes having exchanged DNA strand {{in at least one}} site called chiasmata. Each bivalent contains a minimum of one <b>chiasma</b> and rarely more than three. This limited number (much lower than the number of initiated DNA breaks) is due to crossover interference, a poorly understood phenomenon that limits the number of resolution of repair events into crossover in the vicinity of another pre-existing crossover outcome, thereby limiting the total number of crossovers per homologs pair.|$|E
25|$|At the meiotic {{metaphase}} I, the cytoskeleton put the bivalents under tension by pulling each homolog in opposite direction (contrary to mitotic division where the forces are exerted on each chromatid). The anchorage of the cytoskeleton to the chromosomes {{takes place at}} the centromere thanks to a protein complex called kinetochore. This tension results in the alignment of the bivalent {{at the center of the}} cell, the chiasmata and the distal cohesion of the sister chromatids being the anchor point sustaining the force exerted on the whole structure. Impressively, human female primary oocytes remains in this tension state for decades (from the establishment of the oocyte in metaphase I during embryonic development, to the ovulation event in adulthood that resume the meiotic division), highlighting the robustness of the <b>chiasma</b> and the cohesion that hold the bivalents together.|$|E
25|$|The nucleus geniculatus lateralis {{is made up}} of {{different}} cellular strata separated by lamellae, parallel to the surface. The stratae 1 and 2, the most ventral, are magnocellular. The other are mediocellular. From the retina, the axons of the optic nerves go directly to the geniculate nuclei. The nasal component of the optic nerves (the axons issued from the nasal field of the retina of both sides) crosses at the chiasma.The axons of the temporal field do not cross. This is very important in clinical neurology. After the <b>chiasma,</b> axons form the visual tracts turning around the peduncles and arriving into the polar anterior part of the geniculate nucleus. Retinal axons from the controlateral retina end in stratae 1,4 and 6. Those from the ipsilateral retina end in 2,3 and 5. The axons from the lateral geniculate nucleus, through the optic radiation, end in the primary visual cortex around the calcarine fissure. See visual system.|$|E
25|$|The orange litter-mates {{of white}} tigers are not prone to strabismus. Siamese cats and albinos of every species {{which have been}} studied all exhibit the same visual pathway {{abnormality}} found in white tigers. Siamese cats are also sometimes cross-eyed, as are some albino ferrets. The visual pathway abnormality was first documented in white tigers in the brain of a white tiger called Moni after he died, although his eyes were of normal alignment. The abnormality {{is that there is}} a disruption in the optic chiasm. The examination of Moni's brain suggested the disruption is less severe in white tigers than it is in Siamese cats. Because of the visual pathway abnormality, by which some optic nerves are routed to the wrong side of the brain, white tigers have a problem with spatial orientation, and bump into things until they learn to compensate. Some tigers compensate by crossing their eyes. When the neurons pass from the retina to the brain and reach the optic <b>chiasma,</b> some cross and some do not, so that visual images are projected to the wrong hemisphere of the brain. White tigers cannot see as well as normal tigers and suffer from photophobia, like albinos.|$|E

50|$|In genetics, a <b>chiasma</b> (pl. chiasmata) is {{the point}} of contact, the {{physical}} link, between two (non-sister) chromatids belonging to homologous chromosomes.

In meiosis, absence of a <b>chiasma</b> usually result in improper chromosomal segregation and aneuploidy.|$|E

50|$|During normal mitosis, sister chromatids {{separate}} {{into two}} identical daughter cells. In meiosis is a diploid cell (2N) duplicates its DNA once and undergoes {{two rounds of}} cell division to produce four haploid (1N), germ cells that promotes the recombination of large expanses of chromosomal DNA, potentially similar in size to those lost or gained in cancer. In meiotic division, homologous chromosomes are held together by cohesions, and after resolution of <b>chiasma</b> (the recombination crossover points with the other chromosome pair), the homologous chromosomes are segregated together. In these cells <b>chiasma</b> occurs and sister chromatids are partly held together by cohesions; when cell division occurs, the sister chromatids are sheared and mis-segregated which results in an aneuploid state.|$|E

5000|$|When the non-sister chromatids intertwine, {{segments}} of chromatids with similar sequence may break apart and be exchanged {{in a process}} known as genetic recombination or [...] "crossing-over". This exchange produces a <b>chiasma,</b> a region that is shaped like an X, where the two chromosomes are physically joined. At least one <b>chiasma</b> per chromosome often appears to be necessary to stabilise bivalents along the metaphase plate during separation. The crossover of genetic material also provides a possible defence against 'chromosome killer' mechanisms, by removing the distinction between 'self' and 'non-self' through which such a mechanism could operate. A further consequence of recombinant synapsis is to increase genetic variability within the offspring. Repeated recombination also has the general effect of allowing genes to move independently of each other through the generations, allowing for the independent concentration of beneficial genes and the purging of the detrimental.|$|E
50|$|In humans, {{there seems}} to be one <b>chiasma</b> per {{chromosome}} arm, and in mammals, the number of chromosome arms is a good predictor of the number of crossovers. Yet, in humans and possibly other species, evidence shows that the number of crossovers is regulated at the level of an entire chromosome and not an arm.|$|E
50|$|<b>Chiasma</b> {{formation}} {{is common in}} meiosis, where two homologous chromosomes break and rejoin, leading to chromosomes that are hybrids of the parental types. It can also occur during mitosis but {{at a much lower}} frequency because the chromosomes do not pair in a regular arrangement. Nevertheless, the result will be the same when it does occur—the recombination of genes.|$|E
