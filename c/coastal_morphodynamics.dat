50|$|Swash, or forewash in geography, is a {{turbulent}} layer {{of water that}} washes {{up on the beach}} after an incoming wave has broken. The swash action can move beach materials up and down the beach, which results in the cross-shore sediment exchange.

Multiscale, behavior-oriented and process-based models, or hybrids of the two, are typically applied with deterministic approaches which require considerable computational effort. In {{order to reduce}} the computational cost of modeling large spatial and temporal scales, input reduction and morphological acceleration techniques have been developed. Here we introduce a general framework for reducing dimensionality of wave-driver inputs to morphodynamic models. The proposed framework seeks to account for dependencies with global atmospheric circulation fields and deals simultaneously with seasonality, interannual variability, long-term trends, and autocorrelation of wave height, wave period, and wave direction. The model is also able to reproduce future wave climate time series accounting for possible changes in the global climate system.

It is demonstrated that inadequately formulated numerical techniques lead to the introduction of diffusion, dispersion and the bed elevation oscillations previously reported in the literature. Four different bed update schemes are then reviewed and tested against benchmark analytical solutions. These include a first order upwind scheme, two Lax-Wendroff schemes and a non-oscillating centred scheme (NOCS) recently applied to morphological modelling by Saint-Cast [Saint-Cast, F., 2002.

It is shown that NOCS limits and controls numerical errors while including all the sediment flux gradients that control morphological change. Further, no post solution filtering is required, which avoids difficulties with selecting filter strength.

It involves risk to different types of possible processes: coastal inundation (storm surge), river, estuarine and flash flood, either at urban or natural areas, and fords. Based on the causes of these processes, several environmental indicators were taken to build-up the risk assessment. Geoindicators include geological-geomorphologic proprieties of Quaternary sedimentary units, water table, drainage basin morphometry, <b>coastal</b> dynamics, beach <b>morphodynamics</b> and microclimatic characteristics. Bioindicators involve coastal plain and low slope native vegetation categories and two alteration states. Anthropogenic indicators encompass land use categories properties such as: type, occupation density, urban structure type and occupation consolidation degree. The selected indicators were stored within an expert Geoenvironmental Information System developed for the State of Sao Paulo Coastal Zone (SIIGAL), which attributes were mathematically classified through deterministic approaches, in order to estimate natural susceptibilities (Sn), human-induced susceptibilities (Sa), return period of rain events (Ri), potential damages (Dp) and the risk classification (R), according to the equation R=(Sn.

Coastal microbial mats {{play an important role in}} <b>coastal</b> protection and <b>morphodynamics</b> through stabilization of the sediments and by initiating the development of salt-marshes. Little is known about the bacterial and especially archaeal diversity and how it contributes to the ecological functioning of coastal microbial mats. Here, we analyzed three different types of coastal microbial mats that are located along a tidal gradient and can be characterized as marine (ST 2), brackish (ST 3) and freshwater (ST 3) systems. The mats were sampled during three different seasons and subjected to massive parallel tag sequencing of the V 6 region of the 16 S rRNA genes of Bacteria and Archaea. Sequence analysis revealed that the mats are among the most diverse marine ecosystems studied so far and consist of several novel taxonomic levels ranging from classes to species. The diversity between the different mat types was far more pronounced than the changes between the different seasons at one location. The archaeal community for these mats have not been studied before and revealed a strong reaction on a short period of draught during summer resulting in a massive increase in halobacterial sequences, whereas the bacterial community was barely affected. We concluded that the community composition and the microbial diversity were intrinsic of the mat type and depend on the location along the tidal gradient indicating a relation with salinity. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Human {{development}} {{along the}} coast of the world has caused important changes to <b>coastal</b> <b>morphodynamics.</b> The barrier-inlet system of Florida, especially the tidal inlets, has been severely impacted by this development. Beginning in the 1920 s and continuing through the 1960 s there was: (1) extensive construction ffill-type causeways connecting the mainland to the barrier islands, (2) widespread dredge-and-fill construction along the backbarrier and mainland, and (3) dredging of the lntracoastal Waterway (ICW) in the back-barrier area. The primary effect of hese various types of construction and development was to cause instability of many inlets by diminishing the tidal flux through them. In some cases there was a combination ofhuman and natural causes that resulted in the inlet degradation orclosure such as at Dunedin Pass and Blind Pass, whereas at others this instability was almost exclu-sively the result of human activity such asat Midnight Pass. Although these detrimental devel-opment practices have been stopped, a large amount of irreparable damage has been done.

Between the priorities of environment, people and economy, it is of increasing importance to fully understand the fundamental force of water {{to be capable of}} handling waterborne events—such as flooding—manage and ensure water quality and availability, and utilize hydraulic energy. The Institute of Hydraulic Engineering and Water Resources Management (IWW) at RWTH Aachen University has a long research tradition in this field. Going back to the founding year of the university in 1870, the chair is {{based on the work of}} civil engineer Otto Intze, who is best known for his pioneering contributions in construction of dams and elevated water tanks. Ever since then, the institute has broadened its research spectrum and is today focusing on flood protection structures, hydraulic engineering design, integrated <b>coastal</b> zone management, <b>morphodynamics</b> and ethohydraulics. In a comprehensive approach, physical model experiments are combined with field measurements and numerical simulations to investigate a wide range of projects. With its annually organized International Symposium on Hydraulic Engineering (IWASA), the institute also offers information to a wide audience on highly topical aspects in the field of water engineering works and water management, while at the same time bridging the gap between science and industry. The institute is part of the “Project House Water”, a research network at RWTH Aachen University that was established within the framework of the German excellence initiative. Here, scientific competencies from the fields of ecotoxicology, process engineering, geography, sociology, economy and hydraulic engineering are focussed to allow for an interdisciplinary, holistic assessment of flooding events and their impacts.|$|R
40|$|Shore nourishments are {{regarded}} as an almost routine coastal protection measure and {{have been carried out}} worldwide for several decades. Recent studies generally conclude that “soft” coastal protection measures are an effective option for a sustainable coastal management. However, more research on economic sustainability, species-specific habitat demands and availability of sand deposits is required. Nowadays, the recent paradigm shifts to concepts like the Integrated Coastal Zone Management (ICZM) and the Ecosystem Approach to Management (EAM). For the German Wadden Sea these management objectives are an important issue of the “Wattenmeerstrategie 2100 ”, a political strategy report that demands an adaption against the global change and the expected sea-level rise up to the year 2100. Hence, also new concepts and tools for the implementation of more sustainable, effective and environment-friendly shore nourishments are needed. The research project STENCIL joins the expertise of coastal engineers, geologists, biologists and toxicologists {{in order to make a}} first step towards the long-term goal of establishing an ICZM and EAM for shore nourishments in the German Wadden Sea. The project focuses on providing improved tools, models and methods for the prediction of <b>coastal</b> hydro- and <b>morphodynamics.</b> Furthermore, the impact of dredging and dumping activities on benthic habitats and their natural regeneration potentials will be evaluated. Since these impacts are still widely uninvestigated, monitoring of dredging areas and the surrounding sites using hydroacoustic devices, aerial photos and sediment samples for grain-size and benthos analysis remains of high importance. In order to develop standardized operative observation methods, analysis and decision-supporting tools, an implementation of field measurements, laboratory experiments as well as conceptual and numerical models is planned. These combined approaches will result in valuable data sets for habitat evaluation, improved prediction methods as well as process and work-flow studies. Finally, a strategy for future planning and monitoring of shore nourishment projects will be established in close cooperation with the coastal authorities. STENCIL has recently started in October 2016 within the research program “Research for sustainable development” (FONA) of the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF).

Mean (wave-averaged) cross-shore flow in the surfzone has a strong vertical variation. Good understanding and prediction of this mean velocity profile is of crucial importance, as it determines the advective transport of constituents, such as sediment, and consequently the coastal morphological evolution. Most modeling systems for <b>coastal</b> hydrodynamics and <b>morphodynamics</b> do no resolve the wave motion, and wave-current coupling is a challenging topic. This paper investigates stresses and forces that control mean surfzone hydrodynamics based on detailed wave flume velocity measurements above a fixed sloping bed including two breaker bars. The data show that the vertical distribution of normal stress below the wave trough level is fairly uniform. At the same time, the data suggest that a significant part is concentrated between the wave trough and crest level. Furthermore, it is concluded that the horizontal radiation stress gradients and the vertical shear stress gradients can be of the same order of magnitude {{in the vicinity of the}} breaker bar. Although usually ignored in 3 D mean flow modeling systems, the wave Reynolds stress makes an important contribution to the mean shear stress. The normal stress below the wave trough level could be reasonably well predicted using the classical [16] expression, accounting for the contribution between wave crest and trough. The model of [39] reproduces the main trends in the wave Reynolds stresses above the bottom boundary layer...|$|R

The activities were performed keeping in mind the necessity: 1) 	to add new symbols because the great progress made in geomorphology, in terms of new knowledge on geomorphological processes and landforms, after the first issue of the legend in 1994; 2) 	to have a legend usable with large scale maps, suitable for applied purposes; 3) 	to create a legend usable with softwares (GIS environment, etc). The WG on <b>Coastal</b> <b>Morphodynamics</b> contributed to this work, as well, promoting, through meetings and workshops, the debate among the Italian coastal geomorphologists on the approach needed to produce a modern geomorphological legend. The classic dichotomy forms-processes used in the geomorphological mapping is often based to static concepts, especially when applied to marine and coastal areas, affected by fast dynamic events, sometimes paroxysmal. We present the new geomorphological legend to represent both coastal and underwater contexts, aimed to the improvement of classic geomorphological legends. The main goal of the work was the production of a legend suitable to clarify the importance and the need of representing landforms in the context ofthe Quaternary evolution, as well as from more recent or modern processes...|$|E

Interest in understanding long-term <b>coastal</b> <b>morphodynamics</b> has recently increased as climate change impacts become perceptible and accelerated. Multiscale, behavior-oriented and process-based models, or hybrids of the two, are typically applied with deterministic approaches which require considerable computational effort. In order to reduce the computational cost of modeling large spatial and temporal scales, input reduction and morphological acceleration techniques have been developed. Here we introduce a general framework for reducing dimensionality of wave-driver inputs to morphodynamic models. The proposed framework seeks to account for dependencies with global atmospheric circulation fields and deals simultaneously with seasonality, interannual variability, long-term trends, and autocorrelation of wave height, wave period, and wave direction. The model is also able to reproduce future wave climate time series accounting for possible changes in the global climate system. An application of long-term shoreline evolution is presented by comparing the performance of the real and the simulated wave climate using a one-line model...|$|E
