5|$|In the {{northern}} part of the constellation to the northwest of the Pleiades lies the <b>Crystal</b> <b>Ball</b> Nebula, known by its catalogue designation of NGC 1514. This planetary nebula is of historical interest following its discovery by German-born English astronomer William Herschel in 1790. Prior to that time, astronomers had assumed that nebulae were simply unresolved groups of stars. However, Herschel could clearly resolve a star at the center of the nebula that was surrounded by a nebulous cloud of some type. In 1864, English astronomer William Huggins used the spectrum of this nebula to deduce that the nebula is a luminous gas, rather than stars.|$|E
5|$|George {{returns to}} Paris and learns from Andre Lobineau, a {{colleague}} of Nicole's, that Montfauçon is a location in Paris. Flap and Guido attempt to steal the tripod from the museum; but they are beaten to the theft by Nicole, who gives the artifact to George. In the sewers of Montfauçon, George spies on a secret meeting of people who {{claim to be the}} Templars, and he learns of their plan to find the Sword of Baphomet. After the group leaves, George uses the tripod and gem in the underground chamber to reveal the name of a village in Syria: Marib. He travels to the village and discovers that Khan has been looking for him. At a nearby rock formation called the Bull's Head, George finds a lens and deduces that it is represented on the manuscript as a <b>crystal</b> <b>ball.</b> He also discovers an idol with three bearded faces, Baphomet; and a Latin inscription that describes Britain. Khan arrives and holds George at gunpoint, but George manages to escape.|$|E
5|$|The next day, {{they learn}} {{that the members of}} the Sanders-Hardiman {{expedition}} are falling into comas, with fragments of a shattered <b>crystal</b> <b>ball</b> found near each victim. Concerned, Tintin, Haddock, and their friend Professor Calculus visit Calculus's old friend Professor Hercules Tarragon, the only expedition member yet to be affected. Professor Tarragon is under police guard, and he shows his visitors the mummified body of Inca king Rascar Capac, which the expedition brought back with them from Peru. A lightning storm strikes the house and sends ball lightning down the chimney and onto the mummy—which evaporates. Worried, Tarragon states that this reflects the culmination of Capac's prophecy, which declares that punishment will descend upon those who desecrate his tomb. Spending the stormy night at Tarragon's house, Tintin, Haddock, and Calculus are each awoken by a dream involving Capac's mummy. They find Tarragon comatose in his bed, with the accompanying crystal shards nearby; the attacker had bypassed the guards by climbing in via the chimney. The next day, Calculus is walking on the grounds of Tarragon's house when he discovers one of the mummy's bracelets, which he places on himself.|$|E

50|$|Tintin and the Temple of the Sun / The Seven <b>Crystal</b> <b>Balls</b> & Prisoners of the Sun (1969, Belvision, a co-production between Belgium, France and Switzerland) {{is a film}} {{made after}} {{the success of the}} Belvision cartoon series. The subject was to be The Seven <b>Crystal</b> <b>Balls</b> and Prisoners of the Sun (merged {{becoming}} Tintin and the Temple of the Sun). There was a lot of publicity for the movie (which was the first of two animated films, the second being Tintin and the Lake of Sharks).|$|R
25|$|One {{class of}} methods of scrying {{involves}} a self-induced trance, {{with or without}} the aid of a medium such as a <b>crystal</b> <b>ball.</b> Some say that the sensation is drug-like, some that various drugs can potentiate the experience; others categorically exclude any connection with drug usage, claiming that it invalidates any images observed.|$|E

25|$|FiveThirtyEight's final polls-plus {{forecast}} predicted 18 states, {{plus the}} second congressional districts of Maine and Nebraska, with an interval of confidence lower than 90%. However, every major forecaster, including FiveThirtyEight, the New York Times Upshot, prediction markets aggregator PredictWise, ElectionBettingOdds from Maxim Lott and John Stossel, the DailyKos, the Princeton Election Consortium, the Huffington Post, the Cook Political Report, Larry Sabato's <b>Crystal</b> <b>Ball,</b> and the Rothenberg and Gonzales Report, called every state {{the same way}} (although Cook and Rothenberg-Gonzales left two and five states as toss-ups, respectively). The sole exception was Maine's 2nd congressional district. Of the forecasters who published results on the district, the Times gave Trump a 64% chance of winning and PredictWise a 52% chance, FiveThirtyEight gave Clinton a 51% chance of winning in polls-only and 54% in polls-plus, Princeton gave her a 60% chance, Cook labelled it a toss-up, and Sabato leaned it towards Trump. The following table displays the final winning probabilities given by each outlet, along with the final electoral result.

500|$|Tintin and the Temple of the Sun (...) (1969), {{the first}} {{traditional}} animation Tintin film, {{was adapted from}} two of Hergé's Adventures of Tintin: The Seven <b>Crystal</b> <b>Balls</b> and Prisoners of the Sun. The first full-length, animated film from Raymond Leblanc's Belvision, which had recently completed its television series based upon the Tintin stories; it was directed by Eddie Lateste and featured a musical score by the critically acclaimed composer François Rauber. The adaptation is mostly faithful, although the Seven <b>Crystal</b> <b>Balls</b> portion of the story was heavily condensed.|$|R

25|$|Mattel created two dolls {{based on}} Erica Kane {{as part of}} the company's Daytime Drama Collection. They {{released}} the first one in 1998. Mattel modeled that doll after the character's appearance during the <b>Crystal</b> <b>Ball,</b> an annual event in All My Childrens storylines. After that doll met with success, they released the second in 1999 called the Champagne Lace Wedding Erica Kane Doll. This one was based on the character as she was during the 1993 wedding to Dimitri Marick.|$|E
25|$|Various {{methods were}} used to {{forecast}} {{the outcome of the}} 2016 election. For the 2016 election, there were many competing election forecast approaches including Nate Silver's FiveThirtyEight, The Upshot at The New York Times, Daily Kos, Princeton Election Consortium, Cook Political Report, Rothenberg and Gonzales, PollyVote, Sabato's <b>Crystal</b> <b>Ball</b> and Electoral-Vote. These models mostly showed a Democratic advantage since the nominees were confirmed, and were supported by pundits and statisticians, including Nate Silver of FiveThirtyEight, Nate Cohn at The New York Times, and Larry Sabato from the <b>Crystal</b> <b>Ball</b> newsletter, who predicted a Democratic victory in competitive presidential races and projected consistent leads in several battleground states around the country. The near-unanimity of forecasters in predicting a Clinton victory may have been the result of groupthink. However, FiveThirtyEight's model pointed to the possibility of an Electoral College-popular vote split widening in the final weeks based on Trump's improvement in swing states like Florida or Pennsylvania. This was due to the demographics targeted by Trump's campaign which lived in big numbers there, in addition to Clinton's poor performance in several of those swing states in comparison with Obama's performance in 2012, as well as having a big number of her potential voters in very populated traditionally 'blue' states, but also in some very populated states traditionally 'red', like Texas, which were projected safe for Trump.|$|E
25|$|Prior to the {{disbanding}} of The Revolution, Prince {{was working}} on two separate projects, The Revolution album Dream Factory and a solo effort, Camille. Unlike the three previous band albums, Dream Factory included input from the band members and featured songs with lead vocals by Wendy & Lisa. The Camille project saw Prince create a new androgynous persona primarily singing in a sped-up, female-sounding voice. With the dismissal of The Revolution, Prince consolidated material from both shelved albums, along with some new songs, into a three-LP album to be titled <b>Crystal</b> <b>Ball.</b> Warner Bros. forced Prince to trim the triple album to a double album, and Sign o' the Times was released on March 31, 1987.|$|E

This leads them to General Rey's psychiatrist Dr. Scott Stevens, who reveals that General Rey is a clone of Serpentor. Dr. Stevens is then revealed to be Cobra hypnotist <b>Crystal</b> <b>Ball,</b> who has brainwashed General Rey, and commands him to kill Duke.

When she is unsuccessful, Neal and Mulan set out for Rumpelstiltskin's castle, hoping to find something to lead them to Emma and Henry. When they arrive there, they meet Robin Hood, who has taken up residence in the castle, but allows them to search for what they seek to repay the life debt he owes Rumpelstiltskin. Finding his father's old staff, Neal manages to uncover a concealed cabinet full of magical objects, including a <b>crystal</b> <b>ball</b> that tells him that Emma is in Neverland.|$|E

He escorts her to the <b>Crystal</b> <b>Ball</b> in 1998 and they look {{to be on their}} way to a reconciliation. By the time Erica realizes she still loves him, he is presumed dead. During his funeral she talks about her and Dimitri as soul mates and acts as though she is his widow. Alexandra Devane Marick reveals that she married Dimitri during his trip to Europe. Erica does not believe Alex is the type of woman Dimitri would ever be with and doubts they were ever married.|$|E

5|$|The Seven <b>Crystal</b> <b>Balls</b> was a {{commercial}} success and {{was published in}} book form by Casterman shortly after its conclusion. Hergé concluded the arc begun in this story with Prisoners of the Sun, while the series itself became a defining part of the Franco-Belgian comics tradition. Critics have ranked The Seven <b>Crystal</b> <b>Balls</b> {{as one of the}} best Adventures of Tintin, describing it as the most frightening instalment in the series. The story was adapted for the 1969 Belvision film, Tintin and the Temple of the Sun and for the 1991 animated series The Adventures of Tintin by Ellipse and Nelvana.|$|R
500|$|Hergé {{continued}} {{at the point}} where he had left The Seven <b>Crystal</b> <b>Balls,</b> prior to embarking on Prisoners of the Sun, although both were published under the title of [...] (The Temple of the Sun). Rather than re-serialising the story from its beginning, he began the new magazine with a summary of the story so far, presented as a press clipping. The magazine was an instant success, soon gaining a weekly circulation of 100,000 in Belgium and the Netherlands. The Seven <b>Crystal</b> <b>Balls</b> serialisation finally concluded on 22 April 1948, {{four and a half years}} after it had begun.|$|R
