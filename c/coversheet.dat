40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the design and}} development of an innovative thermal and humidity control system for future space suits. The system comprises an evaporation cooling and dehumidification garment (ECDG) and a lithium chloride absorber radiator (LCAR). The ECDG absorbs heat and water vapor from inside the suit pressure garment, while the LCAR rejects heat to space without venting water vapor. The ECDG is built from thin, flexible patches with <b>coversheets</b> made of non-porous, water-permeable membranes that -enclose arrays of vapor flow passages. Water vapor from inside the spacesuit diffuses across the water permeable membranes, enters the vapor flow channels, and then flows to the LCAR, thus dehumidifying the internal volume of the space suit pressure garment. Additional water evaporation inside the ECDG provides cooling for sensible heat loads. -The heat released from condensation and absorption in the LCAR is rejected to the environment by thermal radiation. We have assembled lightweight and flexible ECDG pouches from prototypical materials and measured their performance {{in a series of}} separate effects tests under well-controlled, prototypical conditions. Sweating hot plate tests at typical space suit pressures show that ECDG pouches can absorb over 60 W/ft of latent heat and 20 W/ft of sensible heat from the pressure garment environment.

40|$|Time {{dependent}} numerical {{simulations of}} the K ALPHA complex of Fe XXV {{are carried out}} {{as a function of}} temperature/density/radiation field variations in high-temperature astrophysical and laboratory plasmas. In addition to several well known features, the transient and steady state spectra reveal the effects due to (a) time-dependent thermal and non-thermal radiation fields, (b) photo and collisional excitation and ionization, and (c) high densities, on the `quartet' of principal w,x,y,z lines, and dielectronic satellites. The highly detailed models show precisely how, assuming a temporal-temperature correlation, the X-ray intensity varies between 6. 6 - 6. 7 keV and undergoes a `spectral inversion' in the w and z line intensities, characterizing an ionization or a recombination dominated plasma. The dielectronic satellite intensities are the most temperature dependent features, but insensitive to density variations, and significantly contribute to the K ALPHA complex for T < 6. 7 keV leading to asymmetric profiles. The 6. 7 keV K ALPHA complex should be a potential diagnostic of X-ray flares in AGN, afterglows in gamma-ray bursts, and other non-equilibrium sources with the high-resolution measurements possible from the upcoming mission Astro-E 2. It is also shown that high electron densities attenuate the line intensities in simulations relevant to laboratory plasmas, such as in inertial confinement fusion, laser, or magnetic Z-pinch devices.

40|$|The {{tradition}} of the oppressed teaches us that the 'state of emergency' {{in which we live}} is not the exception but the rule. We must attain to a conception of history that is in keeping with this insight¿. The current amazement that the things we are experiencing are 'still' possible in the twentieth century is not philosophical. This amazement is not the beginning of knowledge, unless it is the knowledge that the view of history which gives rise to it is untenable. 			 (Benjamin, 1940 : 248 - 249) The German-Jewish critical theorist Walter Benjamin (1892 - 1940) wrote these lines shortly before his death in exile whilst fleeing from the agents of fascism. They seem particularly relevant to a healthcare policy conference with the title ¿Condition Critical¿ taking place almost 70 years later. In this paper one of the things I hope to do is outline how Benjamin¿s concept of the permanent state of emergency relates to health and social care provision for older people with dementia today. Benjamin believed that the Holocaust came about because of the 'amnestic' view of history as an unbroken, linear process of scientific achievement, including the belief in human perfectibility. He suggested that in order to see history stripped of this ideological myth of progress, we need to wake from a collective 'dream history', from our usual somnolent acceptance of surface appearances (Cohen 1993 : 5). Similarly it can be argued today that the 20 th century 'dream history' of linear progress away from a never-to-be-repeated Holocaust is a myth. My strong claim in this paper is that present day demographic panic related to the economic 'burden of care' for an ageing population is leading to proposed solutions analogous to the ideological killing of psychiatric patients, the physically disabled, Jews and other victims of Nazism in the mid- 20 th century. Such 'solutions' are fuelled by media propaganda, the profit motives of what has been described as the 'medical-industrial complex' (Bond et al 2004) and a reductive, medicalised, biological determinist model of the cognitive changes of ageing.

40|$|See <b>Coversheet</b> for system requirements. The {{aim of the}} {{research}} is to integrate computer technologies and environmentally - sensitive materials and processes into the practice of the ceramic designer-maker, in order {{to assess the impact of}} new technologies on practice. A critical contextual review (including analysis of visual material) revealed a developing interest in environmental issues and computer technologies in designer-maker practice. A shift away from a philosophy which historically has been anti-industrial, towards a wider spectrum of craft production was noted. This diversity was shown in the types of production and the scale of manufacture - from ‘one-offs’ to industrial manufacture. New technologies were acknowledged by critics, commentators and practitioners as facilitating this development, although concerns about the potentially detrimental affect that computer technology could have on craft skills was voiced. A link between a pragmatic philosophy of ‘craft’ practice and new approaches to computer systems design highlighted a perception of the validity of ‘craft’ as a contemporary skill. The lack of established methodologies for practice-based ceramic design research has led to the development of a naturalistic approach within this work which is both holistic and emergent. By necessity this methodology places the design researcher at the centre of the inquiry, and uses practice as the main research vehicle. Selected research outcomes were peer reviewed through two significant international touring exhibitions: ‘Hot Off the Press: Ceramics and Print’ and ‘Objects of Our Time’. Initial investigations concentrated on the development of environmentally-sensitive lustre glazes [lead and cadmium free] incorporating an innovative ‘safe’ reduction firing system. Subsequently, ceramic surface designs and three dimensional forms were developed through the integration of: computer assisted design work (CAD); computer assisted manufacture (CAM); colours and glazes; and environmentally-sensitive screen printing, and existing making methods. The outcome was new aesthetic qualities and an extension of practical capabilities. A critical framework for the analysis of research outcomes was developed in order to make explicit and transferable some of the tacit knowledge embodied in research investigations. The analysis was developed through the use of a computer database system from which an electronic document was developed, allowing the integration of a large amount of visual material into the thesis. The research demonstrated that the integration of new technologies into the holistic and emergent practice of the ceramic designer-maker was appropriate. Many advantages of computer technologies for the ceramic practitioner are identified as transferable to the wider field of designer-maker practice and embody the potential to enhance future developments in this field...|$|E
40|$|Body Image in Dancers Introduction Understanding how a dancer?s self-perception can {{differentiate}} skilled dancers versus dancers {{not living}} up to her/his full potential. Knowing ways to help make an environment better for dancers can help end warped thinking in the way they perceive themselves. Obviously, it could depend on the genre and age of the dancer. Society may look at dancers a certain way, which could lead to eating disorders in response to social pressures. Three measurements were used {{for the purpose of this}} study: The NEO-PI Big Five, Social Physique Anxiety Scale, and Sports Anxiety Scale. The NEO-PI Big Five (Costa & McCrae, 1985) measures openness, conscientiousness, extraversion, neuroticism, and agreeableness; these were used to determine the personality of the subjects. The Social Physique Anxiety Scale (Hart, Leary & Rejesky, 1989) measures social anxiety related to the physique of the dancer. Additionally, the Sports Anxiety Scale (Smith, Smoll & Schutz, 1990) measures somatic trait anxiety and two cognitive trait anxieties (worry and concentration disruption), which were used to determine the anxiety level in the participants. These three measurements were used to determine if there was a correlation between dancers and their body image. Method The subjects of this study were fifty-seven undergraduate female dancers attending a large state university in the southwest who volunteered to participate. The participants responded to a test booklet that contained a brief <b>coversheet</b> where they were asked to indicate their preferred dance genre (ballet, ballroom, hip hop, jazz, modern, or tap). The dancers were also asked to respond to the NEO-PI Big Five Inventory (sixty items), the SPAS (twelve items), and the SAS (twenty-one items). SAS statistical procedures were used to analyze the resulting data. Results The Statistical Systems (SAS) Multiple Regression Analyses procedures were employed in order to determine the relationship between the Social Physique Anxiety Scale (SPAS), the Sport Anxiety Scale (SAS), and the Big Five Scale. The Big Five Neuroticism scale was a significant predictor of the SPAS construct (F(5, 51) = 4. 97, p<. 009, r 2 =. 33), the Somatic Anxiety subscale (F(5, 51) = 3. 90, p<. 004, r 2 =. 28), and the Worry measure (F (5, 51) = 7. 92, p<. 0001, r 2 =. 33). The Welch?s t test (for unequal sample sizes and unequal variances) was used to compare the participants? Big Five scale means to T-score means (M= 50, STD= 10; n= 774). Created from a diverse sample of college students, the dancers scored significantly higher (p<. 01) than the normative sample on the Big Five Openness (M= 54. 0 vs. 50) and Neurotic (M= 56 vs. 50) scales. No significant differences were noted between the participants and the normative sample for the Conscientiousness, Extraversion, and Agreeableness Big Five scales (the dance participants score at or very near the T-score means on these variables) ...|$|E
40|$|Writing has {{a central}} role in UK higher {{education}} as a technology for, and signifier of, the learning, teaching and assessment of students. The nature and quality of student writing has also become an important issue outside the academy, particularly {{in the context of a}} globalised neo-liberal knowledge economy discourse which emphasises the importance of transferable and employability skills. Although there is a considerable body of research relating to student writing, the work that I undertook for earlier professional doctorate assignments suggested that the role of academic staff in regulating student writing was under-researched and under-theorised. The research carried out for this thesis sought to address this gap in knowledge by focussing on two central questions. Firstly, what role do academic staff play in regulating student writing? Secondly, how is this role shaped by the specific departmental, disciplinary and institutional contexts in which they are located? The research was undertaken in a criminology department in a post- 1992 university in the UK. It was positioned in an academic literacies framework which conceptualises writing as a social practice, and drew on linguistic ethnographic methodologies to explore the written feedback that staff give on student writing. The written feedback encounter is where staff and student expectations about academic writing practices intersect, and is therefore a telling site for the study of educational discourses relating to knowledge and how it is represented. Data were collected from three main sources: written feedback and comments given by academic staff on 120 pieces of student work; 18 interviews with staff about academic writing; and institutional policies and procedures relating to marking, assessment and feedback. Employing a range of theoretical perspectives, including those informed by feminist and poststructuralist analysis, these texts were analysed to explore the relationship between institutional discourses, pedagogical practices and identity construction. My research showed that there was a considerable disjuncture between the institutional discourses which governed marking, assessment and feedback and the actual feedback practices of staff. Despite the strong scientific and positivist discourse that pervaded institutional documentation on assessment and feedback, some staff drew on a range of alternative pedagogical discourses and engaged in assessment practices which were more subjective and localised in nature. This gap between the institutional discourse and the situated literacy practices was mediated to some extent by the assessment <b>coversheet</b> and marking procedures which worked to provide an appearance of consistency and agreement to external audiences. This promoted a technical rational approach to feedback which obscured the epistemological and gatekeeping functions of feedback. The thesis concludes that the effective theorisation and teaching of student writing rests on an understanding of how academic staff construct and police the boundaries of appropriate knowledge in their discipline. This approach draws on existing academic literacies theories but argues for a more holistic model which understands academic writing as co-constructed through the practices of both students who produce the written work and the academic staff who mark it.

40|$|Abstract {{copyright}} UK Data Service {{and data}} collection copyright owner. The British Household Panel Survey (BHPS) ran for 18 waves, from 1991 - 2009, and was conducted by the ESRC UK Longitudinal Studies Centre (ULSC), together with the Institute for Social and Economic Research (ISER) at the University of Essex. The ULSC, established in 1999, {{is a continuation of}} the research resource component of the ESRC Research Centre on Micro-Social Change (MISOC), established in 1989. In addition to running panel studies, ISER undertakes a programme of research based on panel data, using Understanding Society (see below), the BHPS and other national panels to monitor and measure social change. The main objective of the BHPS was to further understanding of social and economic change at the individual and household level in Britain, and to identify, model and forecast such changes and their causes and consequences in relation to a range of socio-economic variables. It was designed as an annual survey of each adult member (aged 16 years and over) of a nationally representative sample of more than 5, 000 households, making a total of approximately 10, 000 individual interviews. The same individuals were re-interviewed in successive waves and, if they left their original households, all adult members of their new households were also interviewed. Children were interviewed once they reach the age of 16; there was also a special survey of household members aged 11 - 15 included in the BHPS from Wave 4 onwards (the British Youth Panel, or BYP). From Wave 9, two additional samples were added to the BHPS in Scotland and Wales, and at Wave 11 an additional sample from Northern Ireland (which formed the Northern Ireland Household Panel Study or NIHPS), was added to increase the sample to cover the whole of the United Kingdom. For Waves 7 - 11, the BHPS also provided data for the European Community Household Panel (ECHP). For details of sampling, methodology and changes to the survey over time, see Volume A of the documentation (Introduction, Technical Report and Appendices). BHPS Geographic data and other related studies: BHPS Medium-level Geographical Identifiers are also available, subject to conditional access; BHPS Low-level Geographical Identifiers are also available to registered users, subject to special licence access; British National Grid postcode grid references for each BHPS household surveyed are also available, subject to Secure Access conditions; Several datasets from ISER-based BHPS research, and teaching/sampler data are also available; For details of all related data, see the BHPS series webpage. Understanding Society: From Wave 19, the BHPS was subsumed into a new longitudinal study called Understanding Society, or the United Kingdom Household Longitudinal Study (UKHLS), conducted by ISER. The BHPS Wave 19 is part of Understanding Society Wave 2 (January 2010 -March 2011) (see under SN 6614). The BHPS fieldwork moved accordingly from September-April to January-March. This means that the gap between interviews 18 and 19 for the BHPS sample ranged between 16 and 30 months rather than the standard 12 months. From Wave 2, the BHPS sample is a permanent part of Understanding Society and interviews are conducted annually again. BHPS sample members have an identifier within the Understanding Society datasets, allowing BHPS users to match BHPS Wave 1 - 18 data to Understanding Society Wave 2 (and onwards) data. Further information and links to studies are available on the Understanding Society series webpage.
