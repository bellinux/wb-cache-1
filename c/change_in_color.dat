25|$|Melanoma, {{also known}} as {{malignant}} melanoma, {{is a type of}} cancer that develops from the pigment-containing cells known as melanocytes. Melanomas typically occur in the skin but may rarely occur in the mouth, intestines, or eye. In women they most commonly occur on the legs, while in men they are most common on the back. Sometimes they develop from a mole with concerning changes including an increase in size, irregular edges, <b>change</b> <b>in</b> <b>color,</b> itchiness, or skin breakdown.|$|E
25|$|The oldest breath {{analyzer}} models pass breath {{through a}} solution of potassium dichromate, which oxidizes ethanol into acetic acid, changing color in the process. A monochromatic light beam is passed through this sample, and a detector records the change in intensity and, hence, the <b>change</b> <b>in</b> <b>color,</b> {{which is used to}} calculate the percent alcohol in the breath. However, since potassium dichromate is a strong oxidizer, numerous alcohol groups can be oxidized by it, producing false positives. This source of false positives is unlikely as very few other substances found in exhaled air are oxidizable.|$|E

40|$|At mesopic light levels, an {{incremental}} <b>change</b> <b>in</b> rod activation causes <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> <b>color</b> appearance. <b>In</b> this study, we investigated how rod mediated <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> <b>color</b> perception varied {{as a function}} of the magnitude of the rod contrast. Rod-mediated <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> <b>color</b> appearance were assessed by matching them with cone-mediated color changes. A two-channel four-primary colorimeter allowed independent control of the rods and each of the L-, M- and S-cone photoreceptor types. At all light levels, rod contributions to inferred PC, KC and MC pathway mediated vision were linearly related to the rod incremental contrast. This linear relationship could be described by a model based on primate ganglion cell responses with the assumption that rod signals were conveyed via rod–cone gap junctions at mesopic light levels. ...|$|R

25|$|Place {{cells were}} {{initially}} believed to fire in direct relation to simple sensory inputs, but recent {{studies suggest that}} {{this may not be}} the case. Place fields are usually unaffected by large sensory changes, like removing a landmark from an environment, but respond to subtle changes, like a <b>change</b> <b>in</b> <b>color</b> or shape of an object. This suggests that place cells respond to complex stimuli rather than simple individual sensory cues. According to a model known as the functional differentiation model, sensory information is processed in various cortical structures upstream of the hippocampus before actually reaching the structure, so that the information received by place cells is a compilation of different stimuli. Mechanisms required for memory consolidation affect place cell firing less than direct sensory input does, suggesting that it is primarily recent inputs that are retrieved during place coding.|$|E
25|$|To {{reflect his}} early personality, the Beast is seen shirtless, with ragged, dark gray breeches, and a ragged reddish-colored cape {{with a golden}} colored circular-shaped clasp. Despite the actual color of his cape being a dark reddish color, the Beast's cape is more often {{referenced}} to be purple (and {{in most of the}} Beast's subsequent appearances after the film, such as Beauty and the Beast: The Enchanted Christmas or the Kingdom Hearts games, his cape is colored purple). The reason for this <b>change</b> <b>in</b> <b>color</b> is unknown, although the most likely reason is that the color purple is often associated with royalty. After the Beast saves Belle from a pack of wolves, his dress-style changes to become more formal and disciplined, reflecting a more refined personality as he attempts to win Belle's friendship and love. His most referenced form of dress is his ballroom outfit, which consisted of a golden vest over a white dress shirt with a white kerchief, black dress pants trimmed with gold, and a royal blue ballroom tail coat trimmed with gold, worn during the film's ballroom dance sequence.|$|E
25|$|Spatial cues such as {{geometric}} boundaries or orienting landmarks {{are important}} examples of metric input. Place cells mainly rely on set distal cues rather than cues {{in the immediate}} proximal environment. Movement can also be an important spatial cue. The ability of place cells to incorporate new movement information is called path integration, {{and it is important}} for keeping track of self-location during movement. Path integration is largely aided by grid cells, which are a type of neuron in the entorhinal cortex that relay information to place cells in the hippocampus. Grid cells establish a grid representation of a location, so that during movement place cells can fire according to their new location while orienting according to the reference grid of their external environment. Visual sensory inputs can also supply important contextual information. A <b>change</b> <b>in</b> <b>color</b> of a specific object can affect whether or not a place cell fires in a particular field. Thus, visuospatial sensory information is critical to the formation and recollection of place field.|$|E

500|$|During {{spawning}} season, the fins and {{underside of}} male bowfin often <b>change</b> <b>in</b> <b>color</b> to a bright lime green. The courtship/spawning sequence lasts {{one to three}} hours, and can repeat up to five times. Courtship begins when a female approaches the nest. [...] The ritual consists of intermittent nose bites, nudges, and chasing behavior by the male until the female becomes receptive, at which time the pair lie {{side by side in}} the nest. [...] She deposits her eggs while he shakes his fins in a vibratory movement, and releases his milt for fertilization to occur. A male often has eggs from more than one female in his nest, and a single female often spawns in several nests.|$|E

2500|$|Oakland Cemetery was deeded to [...] "the {{people of}} Iowa City" [...] by the Iowa {{territorial}} legislature on February 13, 1843. The original plot was one block square, with {{the southwest corner}} at Governor and Church. Over the years the cemetery has been expanded and now encompasses 40 acres. Oakland Cemetery is a non-perpetual care city cemetery. This cemetery is supported by city taxes. The staff is strongly committed to the maintenance and preservation of privately owned lots and accessories. Since its establishment, the cemetery has become the final resting place of many men and women important {{in the history of}} Iowa, of Iowa City and the University of Iowa. These include Robert E. Lucas, first governor of the territory (1838–41); Samuel J. Kirkwood, governor during the Civil War (1860–64), again in 1876, a U.S. senator in 1877, and subsequently secretary of the interior and U.S. minister to Spain; well-known presidents of the university, Walter A. Jessup (1915–33) and Virgil M. Hancher (1940–64); Cordelia Swan, daughter of one of the three commissioners who selected the site for Iowa City and the new territorial capitol; and Irving B. Weber (1900-1997), noted Iowa City historian. It is also home to the legendary monument called the [...] "Black Angel", which is an 8.5 foot tall monument for the Feldevert family erected in 1912.

60|$|If we take, {{through the}} earth's {{temperate}} zone, a belt of country whose {{northern and southern}} edges are determined by certain limiting isotherms, not {{more than half the}} width of the zone apart, we shall find that we have included in a relatively small extent of surface almost all the nations of note in the world, past or present. Now if we examine this belt, and compare the different parts of it with one another, we shall be struck by a remarkable fact. The peoples inhabiting it grow steadily more personal as we go west. So unmistakable is this gradation of spirit, that one is tempted to ascribe it to cosmic rather than to human causes. It is as marked as the <b>change</b> <b>in</b> <b>color</b> of the human complexion observable along any meridian, which ranges from black at the equator to blonde toward the pole.

30|$|The plaque index (PI), gingival index (GI), and {{halitosis}} index (HI) {{were measured}} {{before and after}} treatment. The PI and GI were recorded using a periodontal probe (Pancer et al. 2016; Liu et al. 2012). Briefly, the periodontal pockets or gingival crevices of the selected tooth were probed and graded as follows: Score 0 : Gingival margin and gingival papilla (GM&P) are healthy, and no bleeding is observed after a slight probe. Score 1 : GM&P are mildly inflamed; and <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> <b>color,</b> absence of edema, and occurrence of punctate hemorrhages are observed after a slight probe.
