5|$|Until 1880 the Met ran no goods trains, but goods trains {{ran over}} its tracks from 20 February 1866 when the GNR began {{a service to}} the LC via Farringdon Street, {{followed}} by a service from the Midland Railway from July 1868. The GNR, the GWR and the Midland all opened goods depots in the Farringdon area, accessed from the City Widened Lines. Goods traffic was {{to play an important}} part of Met traffic on the extension line out of Baker Street. In 1880, the Met secured the coal traffic of the Harrow District Gas Co., worked from an exchange siding with the Midland at Finchley Road to a <b>coal</b> <b>yard</b> at Harrow. Goods and coal depots were provided at most of the stations on the extension line as they were built. Goods for London were initially handled at Willesden, with delivery by road or by transfer to the Midland. The arrival of the GCR gave connections to the north at Quainton Road and south via Neasden, Acton and Kew.|$|E

25|$|When the <b>coal</b> <b>yard</b> closed, the {{opportunity}} was also taken {{to close the}} signal box. All pointwork was removed and mechanical signals were replaced by colour lights controlled by Ketton signal box. Ketton signal box was retained due {{to the need to}} monitor the level crossing.|$|E

The port was closed to commercial shipping in the 1960s. The 19th-century shipping warehouses were demolished in 2001, a <b>coal</b> <b>yard</b> remains at the Port Bridge. The Polestar monument located on the Port Bridge Roundabout serves as a reminder of the area's past. Created by Locky Morris, Its shape alludes to the outline of a boat, as well as having a locomotive (train track) theme, to commemorate the fact that both forms of transportation played a major part in the town's development in the past.|$|E

25|$|Lealholm {{remained}} a traditional, labour-intensive, mixed farming community until the 1970s. In {{the second half}} of twentieth century increasing mechanization of farming operations led to a rapid decline of employment opportunities in agriculture in the surrounding area. However, the rise in the ownership of cars brought tourism into the North York Moors area and the village is a tourist honeypot in the summer months. Employment in tourism has risen rapidly and the village now has guest houses, holiday cottages, bed and breakfast accommodation and catering establishments providing jobs and income along with services and retailers. Lealholm had a typical NER goods shed and <b>coal</b> <b>yard</b> close to the railway station, which became a factory base when the company Lightspeed panels were set up in 1972. They produced the Magenta kit car, a fiberglass body kit based on a Mini chassis. Today the site is a car repair garage.|$|E
25|$|After {{moving to}} the borough in 1867, William and Thomas Hoopes (distant cousins of Josiah and Abner) {{established}} a spoke works. They purchased a site on Market Street from a <b>coal</b> <b>yard</b> operator and opened for business in September 1867, though they were not immediately successful. They invited their relative Edward S. Darlington to join the firm and began manufacturing complete sets of wheels in 1869. About a hundred men were employed in various capacities by the spoke works by 1872, such as cutting, hauling, and turning wood with circular saws. Exports of their products reached as far as Europe and the Pacific Coast. With the panic of 1873, profits suffered, and the firm accused the West Chester Railroad of price gouging. Despite threatening to move the factory to Chester or Philadelphia, the Hoopes Brothers & Darlington (as the firm was known) stayed put and the business recovered by 1880. The firm merged with 14 other companies to form the American Wheel Company in 1889, but the Hoopes Brothers and Darlington bought out their share in 1892. The company began producing wooden bicycle wheels in 1894.|$|E

It was the major port for Somerset which, around the Quantocks, the Brendon Hills and the Tone valley, was mainly agricultural, producing arable crops and vegetables to supply the new industrial towns. Combwich was the traditional River Parrett pilots' harbour from at least the 14th century. It {{also served as a}} port for the export of local produce and, from the 15th century, the import of timber. Until the late 1930s, when the creek silted up, coastal shipping served Combwich's local brick and <b>coal</b> <b>yard.</b>|$|E

Immediately after the bridge, short lines branched off to the east from a wagon turntable to the <b>coal</b> <b>yard</b> and smithy of Pandy Farm and west to a writing slate factory (later a carpenter's yard). The main branch then split to form a storage loop, with a further wagon turntable and a longer branch serving the houses and school to the north east. The main branch continued north, crossing the main road then passing between the two main terraces in the village before ending in a turntable and a final short line connecting to the Capel Jerusalem chapel. The village incline was lifted {{during the early years of}} preservation, to provide much needed rail to replace the existing track. The winding house was demolished in 1968 to allow realignment of the railway to form the extension to Nant Gwernol.|$|E
2500|$|Goods {{traffic was}} handled from October 1849. [...] The goods yard was {{originally}} {{at the west}} end of the station. The original goods shed was destroyed by fire in 1857 and eventually replaced in 1865 by a stone building alongside the railway on the Newton Abbot side of the station. A <b>coal</b> <b>yard</b> was built {{on the west side of}} the station.|$|E

The marina will provide lockers, {{separate}} berths and other facilities to these sailors, who come in small boats. The sailors can then proceed inland for sightseeing. However, the plan still remains on paper. Although the plan to build a large-scale marina is at the proposal stage, the port cannot have a marina till the <b>coal</b> <b>yard</b> is vacated. After coal handling is moved out, the port will reclaim land by constructing groynesâ€”rigid hydraulic structures built from an ocean shore that interrupt water flow and limit the movement of sediment.|$|E

50|$|In {{the early}} 19th century, {{the area was}} an {{overnight}} coach stop between New York City and Philadelphia. In 1836, a public park was built. In the middle 19th century, the area began to attract immigrants from Ireland and Germany. Among the industries established in the area was the only whale oil processing plant on Staten Island. It was later replaced by a linseed oil processing plant that operated until the 20th century. Other industries included lumber and <b>coal</b> <b>yards,</b> as a dye processing plant. Because oyster harvesting was a booming business along the mudflats in New York Harbor, many successful oyster boat captains built mansions on Richmond Terrace facing the Kill van Kull in the 1840s and 1850s. Industries along the waterfront included lumber and <b>coal</b> <b>yards.</b>|$|R
