40|$|Energy {{efficiency}} {{across a}} range of state of charge (SOC) is an important performance parameter in variable Battery Energy Storage System (BESS). A novel method was proposed to evaluate the effect of heat generation with the parameters of resistance and entropy change on the energy efficiency. The energy efficiency was evaluated through measuring the resistance and entropy change during different DOD (depth of discharge). The internal resistance was determined by constant current discharge, followed by plots of V vs I at constant SOC, and found it exhibit a reduction as SOC increasing. In addition, the entropy change was measured by the temperature change of the open-circuit voltage. Energy efficiency results were obtained at constant <b>charge</b> <b>input</b> levels and different discharge rates under the different DOD. The result show that the energy efficiency has a decreasing trend with the increase of the depth of discharge, and the energy efficiency plateaus at 60 % DOD. The energy efficiency is decreased from 88. 8 % to 87. 3 % under 1 C discharge from 20 % to 80 % DOD. Furthermore, the lower the current rate, the higher the energy efficiency under the constant DOD. We isolate the effects of undercharge and underdischarge, and find the difference of energy efficiency under different current rate increases gradually with the increase of DOD.

Thin film strips of niobium could be tuned into resistor strips by an electrochemical anodisation process, using microfabricated masks and in situ resistance monitoring. These resistors showed a transition from superconducting to insulating behaviour with increasing sheet resistance, occurring at a value approximately equal to the quantum resistance for Cooper pairs, h/(4 e 2). 2. Combining the anodisation technique with lateral size minimisation by shadow evaporation, devices in a single electron transistor-like configuration with two weak links and a small island between these were made. Direct evidence for the Coulomb blockade in the anodisation thinned niobium films was found when the transport characteristics could be modulated periodically by sweeping the voltage applied to a gate electrode placed {{on top of the}} structure. 3.

The effects of the reaction temperature, quartz type, charge composition, pellets, and lumps on the composition of the condensate were studied. The trace elements in the <b>charge</b> <b>input,</b> reacting charge, and condensate were analyzed using inductively coupled plasma (ICP) -mass spectroscopy (MS) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). CO(g) and SiO(g), which are the major components in reduction reactions, formed four types of condensate: white, brown, green, and orange. The condensate constituents were amorphous SiO 2, 3 C:SiC, Si, and α-quartz. Each impurity present in the quartz charge entered the gas phase during quartz reduction and was detected in the condensate. Al and Fe show limited volatility. The volatility of Mn, P, and B depends on the charge mix: a higher PCO enhances the concentration of these elements in the gas phase.

The main stress is put on the exploitation of the features offered by CMOS technology with BCCD option, nevertheless the results are partially applicable also to pure CMOS analog design. Three main experiments were realized. 1. A correlated double sampling analog signal processor attached to a 10 -pixel BCCD linear transfer and imaging register. Its main purpose is to eliminate the noise originated at the charge detection node due to its periodical resetting at a fixed potential as well as to diminish the flicker noise generated in the first charge detection amplifier stage. In order to quantify the improvement of the signal-to-noise ratio an identical BCCD linear register is realized as a reference with standard source-follower termination. 2. One single-bit stage of a successive-approximation A/D converter based on CCD technology. The conversion is carried out almost entirely in a charge domain exploiting the inherent CCD features such as high transfer efficiency, non-destructive charge sensing and straightforward implementation of charge subtraction. Single-bit converter with <b>charge</b> <b>input</b> and residuum charge detection structure is implemented, however, for real applications. N stages would be pipelined to obtain N-bit resolution. A simulation software has been written to estimate the final performance in terms of integral and differential non-linearity. 3.

The proposed DC microgrid is based on photovoltaic array (PVA) generation, electrochemical storage, and grid connection; {{it is assumed that}} PEVs have a direct access to their DC <b>charger</b> <b>input.</b> As opposed to conventional power architecture designs, the PVA is coupled directly on the DC link without a static converter, which implies no DC voltage stabilization, increasing energy efficiency, and reducing control complexity.

The first phase of modeling aims to evaluate the main energy flows within the proposed DC microgrid architecture and to identify the control structure and the power management strategies. For this, an original model is obtained by applying the Energetic Macroscopic Representation formalism, which allows deducing the control design using Maximum Control Structure. The second phase of simulation is based on the numerical characterization of the DC microgrid components and the energy management strategies, which consider the power source requirements, charging times of different PEVs, electrochemical storage ageing, and grid power limitations for injection mode.

The initial testing was conducted at 20 C; however, the batteries were cycled also intermittently at low temperatures. YTP 20 Ah cells consisted of mixed-oxide (Co and Ni) positive, graphitic carbon negative, LIPF 6 salt mixed with organic carbonate solvents. The battery voltage clamp was 32 V. The low temperature cycling tests started after 4575 cycles at 20 C. The cells were not capable of cycling. at low temperature since the charge acceptance at battery level was poor. There was a cell in the battery that showed too high an end-of-charge (EOC) voltage thereby limiting the ability to charge {{the rest of the}} cells in the battery. The battery has completed 6714 cycles. SAFT 12 Ah cells consisted of mixed-oxide (Co and NO positive, graphitic carbon negative, LiPF 6 salt mixed with organic carbonate solvents.

A cell that showed low end of discharge (EOD) and EOC voltages and three other cells that showed higher EOC voltages limited the charge acceptance at the selected voltage limit during charge. The cells were capable of cycling at 10 C and 0 C but the charge voltage limit had to be increased to 34. 3 V (4. 3 V per cell). The low temperature cycling may have induced poor chargeability since the voltage had to be increased to achieve the required <b>charge</b> <b>input.</b> The battery has completed 6226 cycles. MSA 10 Ah cells consisted of Co oxide positive, graphitic carbon negative, LiPF 6 salt mixed with organic carbonate solvents. The battery voltage clamp was 30. 8 V.

40|$|According to {{estimates}} of the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), more than 1. 8 billion people will be living in countries or regions with absolute water scarcity by 2025. The pressure on water resources is increased not only in arid and semiarid regions, but also in fast growing megacities {{around the world as}} a result of, amongst other factors, the changing nutritional and consumer behavior (rising living standards). Over 90 % of the annual water consumption of the newly industrializing and developing countries in the arid and semiarid climate zone is used for agricultural irrigation to ensure the nutrition of the population. Thus, {{since the beginning of the}} 20 th century, the planned/controlled reuse of wastewater has developed into a central task of the sustainable water resources management. Wastewater represents a valuable resource in view of its composition (e. g. nutrients P, N for soil fertilizing) and its reliable, weather-independent availability in every household. The establishment of a closed-loop water management can enhance the efficiency of water usage. Therefore, activities in research and development are currently focused on decentralized and semi-centralized concepts, since their structures offer better conditions for the establishment of closed-loop systems and innovations in wastewater technology can be implemented more easily. In general, the hygienic quality requirements for wastewater reuse are predominantly oriented towards the planned usage. These are, in turn, regulated by thresholds and guidance values, e. g. for faecal indicator bacteria (e. g. faecal coliforms: E. coli), in widely differing norms and legal provisions specific to the respective countries. In Germany since 2005, small wastewater treatment plants can obtain the discharge class +H by the German Institute for Civil Engineering (DIBt: Deutsches Institut für Bautechnik) if secondary effluents contain less than 100 faecal coliforms (E. coli) per 100 mL. This ensures a safe effluent seepage in karst and water protection areas. Due to the infectious risk caused by a multitude of pathogens (bacteria, viruses, worm eggs, protozoa) which are still contained in wastewater after mechanical-biological treatment, specific disinfection methods are indispensable for their satisfactory reduction. Demands on disinfection methods for wastewater reclamation are quite complex. They should be characterized by a high and constant disinfection efficiency at low or moderate formation of disinfection by-products. The reclaimed wastewater should be able to be stored safely. Moreover, the disinfection method should be technically simple, scaleable, space-saving, subjected to low maintenance and realized at moderate investment and operating costs without applying external toxic chemicals. Established methods in decentralized wastewater disinfection are mainly based on membrane and UV technologies. However, these methods are currently working under high operating costs (high maintenance and cleaning efforts). Furthermore, the high investment costs of the membrane filtration are disadvantageous. In addition, both methods do not provide a disinfection residual. Thus, further research is required for the development and testing of alternative disinfection technologies. Against this background, the applicability of the electrolysis and UV/electrolysis hybrid technology for the decentralized wastewater reclamation was investigated and assessed in this dissertation. Results have shown that the electrochemical disinfection of biologically treated wastewater represents an efficient method at temperatures of > 6 °C, pH values of 400 J m- 1, no complete removal of E. coli bacteria can be achieved at TSS concentrations of > 17 mg L- 1. Therefore, it is indispensable to prevent bacterial reactivation caused by photo and dark repair processes. This topic was studied in the current work by electrochemically produced oxidants using an electrolysis cell positioned downstream of the UV unit. Results have shown that photo and dark reactivation were completely prevented by oxidants in a total concentration of 0. 5 [...] . 0. 6 mg L- 1 at a TSS concentration of 8 [...] . 11 mg L- 1, at pH values ranging from 5. 7 to 8. 1 and at temperatures ranging from 10 °C to 30 °C (t = 24 [...] 72 h). Even at a high TSS concentration of 75 mg L- 1, the reactivation of E. coli (ctotal oxidants = 1. 8 mg L- 1) and, up to a TSS concentration of 32 mg L- 1, the reactivation of total coliforms (except E. coli, ctotal oxidants = 1. 0 mg L- 1) can be prevented at a high initial germ concentration of 2 … 3 105 per 100 mL. The lowest energy consumption could be observed when mixed oxide electrodes (MOX electrodes) were applied. This result and the fact that no chlorate and perchlorate were observed at MOX electrodes argue for the application of these electrodes in practice. All in all, the UV/electrolysis hybrid technology represents an energy-efficient method for reclamation of biologically treated wastewater with TSS concentrations ranging from 6 months). The undesired formation of coverings caused by biofouling processes on quartz glass surfaces could be prevented by electrochemically produced oxidants in a total concentration of 1 mg L- 1 within an experimental duration of 5. 5 months. However, the application of the UV/electrolysis hybrid technology is limited by increased particle concentrations and faecal loadings (initial E. coli concentration).

40|$|Abstract- Electric {{vehicles}} (EVs) and plug-in hybrid {{electric vehicles}} (PHEVs) {{are becoming a}} part of the electric grid day by day. Chargers for these vehicles have the ability to make this interaction better for the consumer and for the grid. Vehicle to grid (V 2 G) power transfer has been under research {{for more than a decade}} because of the large energy reserve of an electric vehicle battery and the potential of thousands of these connected to the grid. Rather than discharging the vehicle batteries, reactive power compensation in particular is beneficial for both consumers and for the utility. However, certain adverse effects or requirements of reactive power transfer should be defined before a design stage. To understand the dynamics of this operation, this study investigates the effect of reactive power transfer on the charger system components, especially on the dc-link capacitor and the battery.

40|$|We report here an ultra {{low noise}} charge {{sensitive}} monolithic CMOS amplifier (CSA) suitable for small anode capacitance (200 fF), low leakage current solid state detectors. The CSA is continuously sensitive, the <b>charge</b> from the <b>input</b> node being drained by a feedback transistor Mf biased as a resistor with effective {{values in the}} GW range. This very high value was achieved by a novel scheme which tracks threshold variations, and power supply and temperature fluctuations. A good linearity of the CSA conversion gain is achieved (< 0. 1 % up to 1. 8 fC <b>input</b> <b>charge)</b> by inserting a voltage divider between {{the output of the}} CSA and the source of Mf. The equivalent noise charge (ENC) of the CSA is equal to the theoretical lower limit imposed by the flicker noise. The circuit has been fabricated in two different CMOS technologies. With no detector connected, we measure a room-temperature ENC of 9 e - rms at 12 sec shaping time. When coupled to a cooled detector a FWHM of 111 eV is obtained at 2. 4 [...] ...|$|R
