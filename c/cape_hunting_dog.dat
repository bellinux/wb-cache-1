50|$|Their main predators include lions, leopards, cheetahs, spotted hyenas, <b>Cape</b> <b>hunting</b> <b>dogs,</b> pythons, and crocodiles. They can {{camouflage}} {{themselves in}} the grasslands due to their coats, which are almost the same color. If startled or attacked, they stand still, then either hide or flee with an odd rocking-horse movement, and cautiously look back to ensure the danger is gone, generally. They use vocalizations like a shrill whistle through their nostrils and a clicking noise to alert others about danger.|$|R
2500|$|Dik-diks are {{susceptible}} to a myriad of predators including eagles, cats, jackals, caracals, leopards, hyenas, cheetahs, <b>cape</b> <b>hunting</b> <b>dogs,</b> honey badgers, crocodiles, pythons, lions, and humans. Young dik-diks are particularly preyed upon by baboons, genets, and eagles. Dik-diks have a fine-tuned sense of hearing, sight, and smell. When they feel in danger or hear the alarm calls of other animals they hide, rather than fleeing. It is only when frightened or disturbed that they emit their iconic [...] "zik-zik" [...] alarm.|$|R
50|$|Alert and wary in nature, the nyala use a sharp, high, dog-like bark to warn {{others in}} a group about danger. This feature is mainly used by females. They also react to the alarm calls of impala, baboon and kudu. The impala {{has been found to}} react to the calls of the nyala too. The main predators of nyala are lion, leopard and <b>Cape</b> <b>hunting</b> <b>dog,</b> while baboons and {{raptorial}} birds are the predators of juveniles.|$|E
5000|$|Black {{wildebeest}} {{are mainly}} active {{during the early}} morning and late afternoon preferring to rest during the hottest part of the day. The animals can run at speeds of 80 km/h. When a person approaches a herd to within a few hundred metres, the wildebeest snort and run a short distance before stopping and looking back, repeating this behaviour if further approached. They {{communicate with each other}} using pheromones detected by flehmen and several forms of vocal communication.

50|$|Dibatag {{are well}} adapted to {{semi-arid}} habitats, with {{the capability of}} surviving on very little or no water. They meet most water requirements only from food. Their long neck and limbs enable them to place their forelegs on branches and reach higher branches. The brown pelage helps them hide in bushes. Alert and secretive, the dibatag hides in vegetation and remains motionless while watching for possible threats. When alarmed it flees in a slow and relaxed manner with the neck upright and tail erect. The antelope may even resort to stotting (a behavior particular to the gazelles), a kind of leaping with all four limbs in the air, but this gait is most often used during play. It gallops only when in real danger. Predators include the cheetah, lion, spotted hyaena, black-backed jackal, caracal, <b>Cape</b> <b>hunting</b> <b>dog</b> and large eagles. Eagles usually target juveniles.|$|E
50|$|Primarily a browser, the gerenuk feed on {{foliage of}} bushes {{as well as}} trees, shoots, herbs, flowers and fruits. It can reach higher {{branches}} and twigs better than other gazelles and antelopes by standing erect on its hindlegs and elongating its neck; this helps it reach nearly 2 m above the ground. Acacia species are eaten whenever available, while evergreen vegetation forms the diet during droughts. The pointed mouth assists in extracting leaves from thorny vegetation. The gerenuk does not drink water regularly. Major predators of the antelope include <b>Cape</b> <b>hunting</b> <b>dogs,</b> cheetahs, hyenas, lions and leopards.|$|R
50|$|The scimitar oryx {{was a very}} sociable {{animal and}} {{traveled}} in herds of between two and forty individuals, generally, led by a dominant bull. This species once gathered in groups of several thousand for migration. During the wet season, they migrated north into the Sahara. Scimitar oryx are diurnal. In the cool early mornings and evenings, they rest under trees and shrubs, or if neither are available, they dig depressions in the soil with their hooves and rest there. Males fight often, {{but not for long}} and not violently. Predators, such as lions, leopards, hyenas, cheetahs, golden jackals, vultures and <b>Cape</b> <b>hunting</b> <b>dogs,</b> mostly kill weak and young oryx.|$|R
50|$|Dogs reach sexual {{maturity}} and can reproduce {{during their first}} year {{in contrast to a}} wolf at two years. The female dog can bear another litter within 8 months of the last one. The canid genus is influenced by the photoperiod and generally reproduces in the springtime. Domestic dogs are not reliant on seasonality for reproduction in contrast to the wolf, coyote, Australian dingo and African basenji that may have only one, seasonal, estrus each year. Feral dogs are influenced by the photoperiod with around half of the breeding females mating in the springtime, which is thought to indicate an ancestral reproductive trait not overcome by domestication, as can be inferred from wolves and <b>Cape</b> <b>hunting</b> <b>dogs.</b>|$|R
50|$|The nyala {{is mainly}} {{active in the}} early morning and the late afternoon. It {{generally}} browses during the day if temperatures are 20 - 30 C and during the night in the rainy season. As a herbivore, the nyala feeds upon foliage, fruits and grasses, with sufficient fresh water. A shy animal, it prefers water holes rather than open spaces. The nyala does not show signs of territoriality, and individuals areas can overlap each others. They are very cautious creatures. Old males live alone, but single sex or mixed family groups of up to 10 individuals can be found. These inhabit thickets within dense and dry savanna woodlands. The main predators of the nyala are lion, leopard and <b>Cape</b> <b>hunting</b> <b>dog,</b> while baboons and raptorial birds hunt for the juveniles. Mating peaks during spring and autumn. Males and females are sexually mature at 18 and 11-12 months of age respectively, though they are socially immature until five years old. After a gestational period of seven months, a single calf is born.|$|E
40|$|The predatory {{habits of}} the <b>Cape</b> <b>hunting</b> <b>dog</b> Lycaon pictus have been well documented, and {{have been found to}} include almost {{exclusively}} mammalian herbivores (Childes 1988). The prey species chosen varies from area to area according to availability, with wildebeest Connochaetes taurinus and Thompson's gazelle, Gazella thomsonii being recorded as preferred prey in East Africa (Malcolm & Van Lawick 1975), whereas impala Aepyceros melampus, kudu Tragelaphus strepsiceros and duiker Sylvicapra grimmia are predominantly selected in southern Africa (Fuller & Kat 1990).

50|$|Nile lechwe can {{visually}} {{signal and}} vocalize {{to communicate with}} each other. They rear high in the air in front of their opponents and turn their heads to the side while displaying. Females are quite loud, making a toad-like croaking when moving. When fighting, males duck their heads and use their horns to push against each other. If one male is significantly smaller than the other, he may move next to the larger male in a parallel position and push from there, which prevents the larger male from pushing with all his force. Known predators are humans, lions, Nile crocodiles, <b>Cape</b> <b>hunting</b> <b>dogs</b> and leopards. They flee to water if disturbed, but females defend their offspring from smaller predators by direct attack, mainly kicking. Yearling Nile lechwes are often infected by warble flies, which can make them unhealthy and result in high mortality rates.|$|R
2500|$|Like all pythons, the African rock python is nonvenomous {{and kills}} its prey by constriction. After {{gripping}} the prey, the snake coils around it, tightening its coils {{every time the}} victim breathes out. Death {{is thought to be}} caused by cardiac arrest rather than by asphyxiation or crushing. The African rock python feeds on a variety of large rodents, monkeys, warthogs, antelopes, fruit bats, monitor lizards, and even crocodiles in forest areas, and on rats, poultry, dogs, and goats in suburban areas. Occasionally, it may eat the cubs of big cats such as leopards, lions, and cheetahs, cubs of hyenas, and puppies of wild dogs such as jackals and <b>Cape</b> <b>hunting</b> <b>dogs..</b> However, these encounters are very rare, as the adult cats can easily kill pythons or fend them off. In March 1, 2017, a 3.9-m (15-ft) African rock python was filmed eating an adult male spotted hyena weighing [...] This encounter suggests that the snake might very well be capable of hunting and killing larger and more dangerous animals than previously thought.|$|R
