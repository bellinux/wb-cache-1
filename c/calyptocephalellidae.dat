5000|$|Telmatobufo is a genus {{of frogs}} (false toads) [...] endemic to {{southern}} Chile. Their closest living relative is the monotypic helmeted water toad, Calyptocephalella gayi. These frogs were recently {{removed from the}} Leptodactylidae {{and placed in a}} new family, the <b>Calyptocephalellidae.</b> All three species of Telmatobufo that have been assessed by the IUCN are considered threatened.|$|E
50|$|Telmatobufo australis is {{a species}} of frog in the family <b>Calyptocephalellidae.</b> It is endemic to Chile and occurs in the western and eastern slopes of the Chilean Coast Range in Valdivia and Osorno Provinces. Its natural {{habitats}} are fast-flowing streams in temperate Nothofagus forest. It is a rare species threatened by habitat loss that is caused by siltation of streams caused by clear cutting and afforestation with exotic species.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Calyptocephalellidae</b> are {{a family}} of toads found in Chile {{containing}} two genera, Calyptocephalella and Telmatobufo. The Calyptocephalella genus contains one species, C. gayi, the helmeted water toad, which is a large aquatic toad weighing up to 0.5 kg. The Telmatobufo genus contains four species, T. australis, T. bullocki, T. ignotus, and T. venustus. All species within the family are considered threatened, with T. bullocki and T. venustus being classified as critically endangered.|$|E
50|$|Calyptocephalella gayi (syn. Caudiverba caudiverba), the helmeted water toad, Chilean helmeted {{bull frog}} or wide-mouth toad, {{is the sole}} species of the genus Calyptocephalella in the family <b>Calyptocephalellidae.</b> The only other members of this family are Telmatobufo. The helmeted water toad is found in central Chile, and {{possibly}} adjacent west-central Argentina. This very large toad weighs up to 0.5 kg. It is aquatic and found in deep ponds and small reservoirs. It is threatened by capture for human consumption, habitat loss, pollution, and introduced trout. It is occasionally captured for herpetoculture.|$|E
50|$|Telmatobufo bullocki (Bullock’s {{mountain}} false toad) is {{a species}} of frog in the family <b>Calyptocephalellidae.</b> It is endemic to Chile, and is only known from a few locations in the Cordillera de Nahuelbuta, {{a part of the}} Chilean Coast Range. It is extremely rare; extensive fieldwork in 1992-2002 turned up only a single adult. It occurs in fast-flowing streams in temperate Nothofagus forest. The tadpoles are free-swimming and feed on algae growing on submerged rocks. It is threatened by siltation of streams caused by clear-cutting. It occurs within the Nahuelbuta National Park.|$|E
50|$|Telmatobufo venustus is {{a species}} of frog in the family <b>Calyptocephalellidae.</b> It is endemic to Chile and occurs on the western slopes of the Andes in Maule and Bío Bío Regions. Its natural {{habitats}} are streams in temperate Nothofagus forests where it is found under rocks along the streams. The only stable population is in the Altos de Lircay National Reserve in Maule. The only other localities, both in the Bío Bío Region, are its type locality in Chillan, where it was not found in 2014, and Ralco where it was last observed in 1981. It is threatened by habitat loss caused by fires, conversion of native habitat to pine and eucalyptus plantations, and in Ralco, hydropower dams. Trout in Altos de Lircay are also a threat.|$|E
40|$|Background Understanding {{the causes}} {{underlying}} heterogeneity of molecular evolutionary rates among lineages is a long-standing and central question in evolutionary biology.

To gain new insights on this topic, we sequenced the complete mitochondrial genomes and nine nuclear loci of one pelobatoid (Pelodytes punctatus) and five neobatrachians, Heleophryne regis (Heleophrynidae), Lechriodus melanopyga (Limnodynastidae), Calyptocephalella gayi (<b>Calyptocephalellidae),</b> Telmatobius bolivianus (Ceratophryidae), and Sooglossus thomasseti (Sooglossidae). These represent major clades not included in previous mitogenomic analyses, {{and most of them}} are remarkably species-poor compared to other neobatrachians. Results We reconstructed a fully resolved and robust phylogeny of extant frogs based on the new mitochondrial and nuclear sequence data, and dated major cladogenetic events. The reconstructed tree recovered Heleophryne as sister group to all other neobatrachians, the Australasian Lechriodus and the South American Calyptocephalella formed a clade that was the sister group to Nobleobatrachia, and the Seychellois Sooglossus was recovered as the sister group of Ranoides. We used relative-rate tests and direct comparison of branch lengths from mitochondrial and nuclear-based trees to demonstrate that both mitochondrial and nuclear evolutionary rates are significantly higher in all neobatrachians compared to their non-neobatrachian relatives, and that such rate acceleration started at the origin of Neobatrachia. Conclusions Through the analysis of the selection coefficient (ω) in different branches of the tree, we found compelling evidence of relaxation of purifying selection in neobatrachians, which could (at least in part) explain the observed higher mitochondrial and nuclear substitution rates in this clade. Our analyses allowed us to discard that changes in substitution rates could be correlated with increased mitochondrial genome rearrangement or diversification rates observed in different lineages of neobatrachians. </p...|$|E
40|$|Amphibians are {{currently}} facing several threats and are suffering severe population declines and extinction worldwide. Telmatobufo bullocki (Anura: <b>Calyptocephalellidae)</b> {{is one of}} the rarest and most endangered amphibian species in Chile's temperate forests. It is the fifth most evolutionarily distinct and globally endangered (EDGE) amphibian in the world, and one of the world's top 100 priority species for conservation (Zoological Society of London, 2011). This stream-breeding frog is micro-endemic to the coastal Nahuelbuta mountain range in central-south Chile (37 °C - 38 ° 50 ' S), a hot-spot for conservation. This area has suffered severe loss and fragmentation of native forest, which has been replaced by extensive commercial plantations of exotic pines and eucalyptus. Despite its potential detrimental effects, the impact of native forest loss on this species has not been studied before. Furthermore, few historical observations exist, and the ecology and behaviour of the species is poorly known. In addition, current status and location of extant populations are uncertain, which makes conservation and targeted habitat protection difficult. Through the use of different approaches and modern conservation tools this thesis aims to make a significant contribution to the conservation of T. bullocki and its habitat. Historical and new locations were surveyed to identify extant populations. A distribution modeling approach (i. e. Maxent) was used to infer the species’ distribution within Nahuelbuta, generate a predictive habitat suitability map, identify important environmental associations, and assess the impact of main environmental threats (i. e. native forest loss, climate change). Field-based research (e. g. surveys, radio-tracking) was done to extend the ecological and behavioural knowledge of the species (e. g. movement patterns and habitat use), and identify critical aquatic and terrestrial habitat for protection (i. e. core habitat). Mitochondrial and specifically developed microsatellite genetic markers were used to measure levels of intra-specific genetic variability, define genetic population structure and connectivity, infer evolutionary history (phylogeography), estimate effective population size and detect demographic changes (e. g. bottlenecks). Finally, a landscape genetics approach was used to relate landscape characteristics to contemporary patterns of gene flow, and identify important landscape features facilitating (i. e. corridors) or hindering (i. e. barriers) genetic connectivity between populations. Telmatobufo bullocki was found in nine basins within Nahuelbuta, including historic and new locations. Presence of T. bullocki was positively related to the amount of native forests in the landscape. However, some populations persist in areas dominated by exotic plantations. Some frogs were found living under mature pine plantation adjacent to native forest, but no frogs were found in core plantation areas. T. bullocki makes extensive use of terrestrial habitat adjacent to breeding streams during the post-breeding season, moving up to 500 m away from streams. A core terrestrial habitat of at least 220 m from streams is proposed for the protection of populations. Population genetics and phylogeography revealed significant population structure. The northernmost and disjunct population of Chivilingo is geographically and genetically isolated from all other sampled populations and was identified as a separate evolutionary significant unit (ESU). The population of Los Lleulles was also identified as a separate management unit, while the remaining populations were grouped into two clusters forming a larger and more connected metaC population. Connectivity within groups was high, suggesting individuals are able to disperse between neighbouring basins. Levels of genetic diversity were not homogeneous, and were lowest at Los Lleulles and highest at Caramávida. Results suggest disjunct populations are at highest risk and should be prioritised for restoration and habitat protection, while management of metaCpopulations should aim at maintaining and improving connectivity among basins. Landscape genetic results identified streams and riparian habitat as dispersal pathways, and least-cost-path analysis was used to identify a potential connectivity network...|$|E
