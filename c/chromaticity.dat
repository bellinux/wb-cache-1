25|$|In <b>chromaticity</b> diagrams, a {{line that}} has {{constant}} perceived hue must be curved, so that the Abney effect is accounted for. The <b>chromaticity</b> diagrams that have been corrected for the Abney effect are therefore excellent illustrations of the non-linear nature of the visual system. Also, the Abney effect does not disallow any and all straight lines on <b>chromaticity</b> diagrams. One may mix two monochromatic lights and not see a shift in hue, thereby suggesting a straight-line plot for the different levels of mixture would be appropriate on a <b>chromaticity</b> diagram.|$|E

Note that the <b>chromaticity</b> diagram is a tool to specify how the human eye will experience light with a given spectrum. It cannot specify colors of objects (or printing inks), since the <b>chromaticity</b> observed while looking at an object depends on the light source as well.|$|E

"Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves 20 - 21) This {{study examined}} the potential effects of the spectral power distributions of mercury-free high-intensity discharge (HID) headlamps on discomfort glare for oncoming drivers and on color rendering of retroreflective traffic materials. In both cases, the effects of mercury-free HID light sources were compared to the changes in these properties that occurred when the tungsten-halogen light sources were replaced with traditional (mercury containing) HID light sources. Specifically, the effect on discomfort glare was estimated by comparing the <b>chromaticities</b> of 9 mercury-free headlamps with the <b>chromaticities</b> of 17 traditional HID headlamps. Analogously, the effects on color rendering were estimated by comparing the <b>chromaticities</b> of 46 retroreflective materials when illuminated by the mercury-free headlamps with the <b>chromaticities</b> of the same materials when illuminated by the traditional HID headlamps. The main findings are as follows: (1) The discomfort glare from the mercury-free HIDs is predicted to be comparable to that from the “bluest” of the traditional HIDs.

25|$|Since {{the human}} eye has three types of color sensors that respond to {{different}} ranges of wavelengths, a full plot of all visible colors is a three-dimensional figure. However, the concept of color {{can be divided into}} two parts: brightness and <b>chromaticity.</b> For example, the color white is a bright color, while the color grey {{is considered to be a}} less bright version of that same white. In other words, the <b>chromaticity</b> of white and grey are the same while their brightness differs.|$|E
25|$|The Abney {{effect can}} be {{illustrated}} on <b>chromaticity</b> diagrams as well. If one adds white light to a monochromatic light, one will obtain a straight line on the <b>chromaticity</b> diagram. We might imagine that the colors along such a line are all perceived as having the same hue. In reality, this does not hold true, and a hue shift is perceived. Correspondingly, if we plot colors that are perceived as having the same hue (and only differing in purity) we will obtain a curved line.|$|E

40|$|November 2003. "Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves 18 - 19) Because {{of rapid}} {{improvements in the}} light output of light-emitting diodes (LEDs), serious consideration is being given to using LEDs as light sources for headlamps. This study examined the potential effects of LEDs on discomfort glare for oncoming drivers and on color rendering of retroreflective traffic materials. In both cases, the effects of LED light sources were compared to the changes in these properties that occurred when the traditional tungsten-halogen light sources were replaced with high-intensity discharge (HID) light sources. Specifically, the effect on discomfort glare was estimated by comparing the <b>chromaticities</b> of 7 LED light sources (considered for use in headlamps) with the <b>chromaticities</b> of the light sources from 17 actual HID headlamps. Analogously, the effects on color rendering were estimated by comparing the <b>chromaticities</b> of 46 retroreflective materials when illuminated by the LED light sources with the <b>chromaticities</b> of the same materials when illuminated by the HID light sources. The main findings concerning the range of LEDs that are currently being considered for use in headlamps are as follows: (1) Headlamps using LEDs with the <b>chromaticities</b> examined here are predicted to lead to more discomfort glare than the current HID headlamps, and substantially more discomfort than tungsten-halogen headlamps. Keeping the correlated color temperature as low as practicable is likely to minimize the problem. However, the relationship between spectral power distribution and discomfort glare is not fully understood, and further research on this issue would be valuable. (2) Color rendering with headlamps using the LEDs examined here {{is likely to be}} acceptable. (3) The spectral power distributions of headlamps using the LEDs examined here will not have appreciable effects on the relative brightness of colored retroreflective materials...|$|R
40|$|A {{new method}} of {{correcting}} <b>chromaticities</b> of circular accelerators is introduced. Instead of using two families of sextupoles, {{as the standard}} way to correct <b>chromaticities,</b> two pairs of TM 210 mode RF cavities are used. The betatron phase advances (both horizontal and vertical) between the two cavities are set to be a multiple of n, and a proper momentum compaction is required. With this method, sextupole nonlinear terms are eliminated. There are octupole terms left by this method. However, they are explicit and should be easy to compensate. An example lattice demonstrates the method. The power required for the RF cavities is estimated. ...|$|R
