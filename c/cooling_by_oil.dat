These engines also implement DCVCP (Double Continuous Variable Cam Phasing technology, a variant of VVT), piston <b>cooling</b> <b>by</b> <b>oil</b> jets, and an integrated catalytic converter. Non-turbocharged variants feature the TwinPort (Variable-length intake manifold) technology.The drive belt for the camshafts is wider and stronger than before, and water pump is not driven by it anymore which improves reliability.|$|E

50|$|Due to {{adiabatic}} heating, {{air compressors}} require some method of disposing of waste heat.

50|$|A Lycoming O-235-C2A {{air-cooled}} engine, {{rated at}} 115 hp (85.8 kW), drives a Sensenich Propeller model 72 CK-050, metallic fixed-pitch twin-bladed propeller. The fuel system uses a FACET MA 3PA carburetor, equipped with carburetor heat. Electrical {{power is supplied}} by a Prestolite alternator. The ignition system is driven by dual Bendix Scintilla S5LN magnetos; the starter motor is also by Prestolite. The engine incorporates a wet crankcase, and the lubricant is <b>cooled</b> <b>by</b> an <b>oil</b> radiator {{in the front of}} the engine's air intake, which is triggered by a bi-metallic thermostatic valve.|$|R

50|$|Engines {{are both}} {{lubricated}} and <b>cooled</b> <b>by</b> <b>oil</b> that circulates throughout the engine, feeding various bearings and other moving parts and then draining, via gravity, into the sump {{at the base}} of the engine. In the wet-sump system of most production automobile engines, a pump collects this oil from the sump and directly circulates it back through the engine. In a dry-sump, the oil still falls to the base of the engine, however instead of collecting in a reservoir-style oil sump, it falls into a much shallower sump, where one or more scavenge pumps draw it away and transfer it to a (usually external) reservoir, where it is both cooled and de-aerated before being recirculated through the engine by a pressure pump. Dry-sump designs frequently mount the pressure pump and scavenge pumps on a common crankshaft, so that one pulley at the front of the system can run as many pumps as the engine design requires. It is common practice to have one scavenge pump per crankcase section, however in the case of inverted engines (aircraft engine) it is necessary to employ separate scavenge pumps for each cylinder bank. Therefore, an inverted V engine would have a minimum of two scavenge pumps and a pressure pump in the pump stack.|$|R

The behaviour of the system in different condition has been analysed though extensive CFD simulations performed with the Star-CD commercial code [2]. The target represents one of the main technological problems related not only to the design of the EADF, but to all High Power Spallation Sources (HPSS) currently under study or in construction world-wide [4],[5]. Different configurations of the spallation EADF target are possible. Advantages and disadvantages of the different options are discussed elsewhere [6] and they are studied and analysed separately. The target device studied in this report is a window type target, <b>cooled</b> <b>by</b> diathermic <b>oil</b> in an independent loop.

50|$|The engine's {{displacement}} is 1,598 cc {{and it has}} a bore/stroke {{ratio of}} 79.7/80.1 mm, attaining cylinder pressures of 180 bar and a compression ratio of 16:1. It uses an aluminum engine block, die-cast aluminum bedplate, and am aluminum cylinder head. A chain-driven dual overhead camshaft with dual continuous variable cam phasing, employing weight-saving hollow sections and lobes, operates four valves per cylinder with low-friction, hydraulic roller finger followers. The pistons are made from aluminum for reduced reciprocating mass, feature a concave, shallow-bowl profile to facilitate efficient combustion, and are <b>cooled</b> <b>by</b> under-skirt <b>oil</b> spraying. The crankshaft employs four counterweights to minimize mass, and both it and the con-rods are made of forged steel. The engine features multiple improvements to reduce NVH, such as a cam cover made of GRP and fully decoupled from the engine to reduce noise and vibration, while also saving weight compared to aluminum; a composite intake manifold encapsulated in acoustic padding as well as an external plastic shield that both significantly reduce noise emissions; a mechanical crankshaft isolator which reduces radiated noise and torsional vibrations in the accessory drive system; and scissor gears for the timing drive system, incorporating tooth profiles ground with a Low Noise Shifting (LNS) process for optimal noise reduction. More than 150 patented diesel control functions are deployed by the engine's ECU, which was developed in-house by General Motors and jointly engineered in Italy (by GM Powertrain Torino), Germany, and the United States, and will be used in all future GM four-cylinder diesel engines.|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} {{investigated}} the Ti- 46 Al- 4 Nb- 2 Mo and Ti- 46 Al- 4 Nb- 2 Cr (at. %) alloys, which were prepared by solution treatment at 1, 400 °C for 30 minutes prior to being air-cooled. The alloys were subsequently reheated to 1350 °C for 60 minutes and were cooled to room temperature <b>by</b> <b>oil</b> or water quenching. The evolution of the microstructure in the alloys was investigated by detailed characterization of the massive-&# 947; transformation of the heat-treated samples by optical microscopy and electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD). Lamellar structures consisting of and &# 945; 2 phases with small amounts of &# 946;-phase were distributed along the grain boundary after the solution treatment process in both alloys. A massive-&# 947; transformation from the &# 945;-phase field was observed for the samples that were <b>cooled</b> <b>by</b> water or <b>oil</b> quenching. After cooling in either oil or water, the massive-&# 947; transformed structure of Ti- 46 Al- 4 Nb- 2 Cr without a lamellar phase was distributed on the &# 945; 2 -matrix. In addition, the massive-&# 947; phases confirmed that the nucleation site was at the grain boundary of the &# 945;/&# 945; parent phase. Moreover, the volume fraction of massive-&# 947; decreased as the cooling rate increased. The EBSD results demonstrated that the massive-&# 947; transformation inherited {{the orientation of the}} lamellar-&# 947;, and nucleation occurred around the parent &# 945;-matrix. The detailed observation orientation relationship by Kikuchi patterns and pole figures revealed a massive- transformation, and the &# 945; 2 -matrix had the associated orientation relationship from the &# 947;-lamellar and parent &# 945;-matrix...|$|R

In these applications, the engine is mounted longitudinally. Displacement is 2.0 L——with a square 86 mm bore and stroke. Compression is 9.2:1 and maximum boost is 1.4 bar (20.0 psi), delivering [...] at 5300 rpm and [...] of torque from 2500 to 5250 rpm. Engine redline is at 6300 rpm and premium fuel is recommended.
