5|$|Further {{development}} of the P90 {{led to the creation}} of the P90 TR model, which has a MIL-STD-1913 triple rail interface for mounting accessories. This model was introduced in late 1999 and continues to be offered alongside the standard P90. More recently, the P90 has been offered to civilian shooters as the PS90, a semi-automatic <b>carbine</b> intended for personal protection and sporting use.|$|E
5|$|In {{the midst}} of this drive on Taegu, an {{ammunition}} shortage became critical for the UN forces. Eighth Army on September 10 reduced the ration of 105mm howitzer ammunition from 50 to 25 rounds per howitzer per day, except in cases of emergency. <b>Carbine</b> ammunition was also in critical short supply. The 17th Field Artillery Battalion, with the first 8-inch howitzers to arrive in Korea, could not engage in the battle for lack of ammunition.|$|E
5|$|In these reports, {{there were}} said to be two weapons near bin Laden in his room, {{including}} an AKS-74U <b>carbine</b> and a Russian-made Makarov pistol, but according to his wife Amal, he was shot before he could reach his AKS-74U. According to the Associated Press, the guns were on a shelf next to the door and the SEALs did not see them until they were photographing the body.|$|E
5000|$|... : February 14, 2011 {{an order}} for 34,377 <b>carbines</b> was placed by BSF (Border Security Force) personnel. The guns were {{delivered}} in 2 batches : The first batch of 17,000 was delivered in September, 2011 and the second batch of 17,377 by March 30, 2012. In January 2012 BSF personnel found excess metal deposits, tool mark scratches, corrosion were found in 2,374 <b>carbines</b> and barrels of 4 <b>carbines</b> bulged when tested. On March 27, 2012 the Indian Home Ministry asked Beretta to replace 573 <b>carbines.</b> It blamed the defects {{in some of the}} other rifles due to improper cleaning and use of bad ammunition. Another order of 34,000 <b>carbines</b> were made. The total order of 68,377 Storm <b>carbines</b> amounts to Rs. 2504 crore (417.3 million US$).|$|R
5000|$|The 7th Kentucky Cavalry was {{initially}} armed with Wesson <b>carbines,</b> 500 having been received prior to July 29, 1862. [...] The quarterly official ordnance returns show {{the possession of}} major arms of the Civil War, but not arms such as the Wesson rifle. In December 1863, the records show the 7th armed with 120 [...]54 caliber Burnside's breech-loading <b>carbines</b> and 59 [...]54 caliber Sharps' rifled breech-loading <b>carbines.</b> They also carried Colt's Army revolvers (caliber [...]44) and cavalry and light cavalry sabres. Only two companies reported their stores of ammunition for <b>carbines,</b> and reported having cartridges for Sharps' <b>carbines</b> and Burnsides.|$|R
50|$|In 1869, the War Department {{purchased}} {{far fewer}} weapons {{of all kinds}} than {{it had in the}} Civil War. Only three Frank Wesson <b>carbines</b> were purchased during the year, for $20 each.

5|$|The British Army's basic {{infantry}} {{weapon is}} the L85A2 assault rifle, sometimes {{equipped with an}} L17A2 under-barrel grenade launcher or other attachments with the Picatinny rail. The rifle has several variants, including the L86A2, the Light Support Weapon (LSW) and the L22A2 <b>carbine</b> (issued to tank crews). These weapons are usually equipped with iron sights or an optical SUSAT, although optical sights have been purchased to supplement these.|$|E
5|$|The PS90 is a <b>carbine</b> {{version of}} the P90, {{intended}} for civilian shooters for personal protection and sporting use; it was introduced in 2005, {{and continues to be}} offered in several configurations. The PS90 will accept the standard 50-round P90 magazines, but the gun is supplied with a magazine that is blocked to a capacity of 10 or 30 rounds, allowing it to be sold in jurisdictions where magazine capacities are restricted by law.|$|E
5|$|The mounted {{police were}} {{established}} to be an armed force, primarily due to the perceived threat from the First Nations on the prairies. The police were initially equipped with the Snider-Enfield <b>Carbine</b> Mark III and the Snider-Enfield Short Rifle, but these were single-shot breechloaders, and inferior to the repeating weapons already being used by Indian groups in the United States. These were replaced with the Winchester Model 1876 repeating rifle from 1878 onwards, but the new guns proved quite delicate and did not perform effectively during the 1885 rebellion. In 1895, the force began to replace the ageing Winchesters with the Lee-Metford Magazine <b>Carbine,</b> but these weapons did not perform as well as hoped. The program was halted and instead the Lee-Enfield Magazine Rifle Mark I was introduced in 1902 as the standard police small arm. The very limited supplies of ammunition held by the force meant {{that the police had}} few opportunities to practice with their weapons, and as a result their marksmanship was typically quite poor.|$|E
50|$|The Republic of Korea Armed Forces {{received}} 1,015,568 M1 and M2 <b>carbines</b> from 1963 to 1972. Along with hundred {{thousands of}} <b>Carbines</b> and M1 Garands {{provided by the}} United States Army before, during and shortly after the Korean war, South Korea would become the largest single recipient of American M1 and M2 <b>carbines.</b>|$|R

5|$|Carpenter faced many {{problems}} associated with this, including {{the possibility of the}} Indians being rescued by their followers or being lynched by angry settlers, during their transport to the civilian court. During transport, Satank hid himself under his red blanket in his wagon while he gnawed the base of his thumb to the bone. This allowed him to slip the manacle from his wrist while he sang his death chant. With a small hidden knife that was not found during two separate searches, he stabbed the driver (who survived), both falling out of the wagon, grabbed a soldier's unloaded <b>carbine</b> and was mortally wounded in his escape attempt.|$|E
5|$|Early in {{the morning}} of 18 April 1945, he led his company through the shell-battered, sniper-infested {{wreckage}} of Nuremberg, Germany. When blistering machinegun fire caught his unit in an exposed position, he ordered his men to take cover, dashed forward alone, and, as bullets whined about him, shot the 3-man guncrew with his <b>carbine.</b> Continuing the advance at the head of his company, he located an enemy patrol armed with rocket launchers which threatened friendly armor. He again went forward alone, secured a vantage point and opened fire on the Germans. Immediately he became the target for concentrated machine pistol and rocket fire, which blasted the rubble about him. Calmly, he continued to shoot at the patrol until he had killed all 6 enemy infantrymen. Continuing boldly far in front of his company, he entered a park, where as his men advanced, a German machinegun opened up on them without warning. With his <b>carbine,</b> he killed the gunner; and then, from a completely exposed position, he directed machinegun fire on the remainder of the crew until all were dead. In a final duel, he wiped out a third machinegun emplacement with rifle fire at a range of 10 yards. By fearlessly engaging in 4 single-handed fire fights with a desperate, powerfully armed enemy, Lt. DALY, voluntarily taking all major risks himself and protecting his men at every opportunity, killed 15 Germans, silenced 3 enemy machineguns and wiped out an entire enemy patrol. His heroism during the lone bitter struggle with fanatical enemy forces was an inspiration to the valiant Americans who took Nuremberg.|$|E
5|$|The 5.7×28mm {{cartridge}} {{was designed}} by FN Herstal specifically {{for use in the}} FN P90 personal defense weapon and FN Five-seven pistol. Subsequently, it has been used {{in a number of other}} weapons, such as the FN PS90 <b>carbine</b> and the AR-57, an upper receiver for M16 and AR-15 rifles. The ST Kinetics CPW can be configured for the 5.7×28mm cartridge by changing the barrel and magazine groups. Excel Arms has developed four firearms chambered in 5.7×28mm, and MasterPiece Arms offers three different 5.7×28mm firearms.|$|E

5000|$|The United Arab Emirates (UAE) {{wished to}} {{purchase}} M16A2 <b>carbines</b> with the thicker M16A2 barrel, but {{still be able}} to mount the M203 grenade launcher. The M203 grenade launcher was designed for the thinner M16A1 barrel. A [...] "step-cut" [...] barrel was made, with a portion of the barrel thinned for the M203 mount. M16A2 <b>carbines</b> with A2 upper receivers and the step-cut barrel were designated Model 727. These are often called [...] "Abu Dhabi" [...] <b>carbines,</b> in reference to the UAE's capital.

5|$|Gamble's men mounted {{determined}} {{resistance and}} delaying tactics from behind fence posts with rapid fire from their breech-loading carbines. It {{is a modern}} myth that they were armed with multi-shot repeating carbines. Nevertheless, {{they were able to}} fire two or three times faster than a muzzle-loaded <b>carbine</b> or rifle. Also, the breech-loading design meant that Union troops did not have to stand to reload and could do so safely behind cover. This was a great advantage over the Confederates, who still had to stand to reload, thus providing an easier target. But this was so far a relatively bloodless affair. By 10:20 a.m., the Confederates had reached Herr Ridge and had pushed the Federal cavalrymen east to McPherson Ridge, when the vanguard of the I Corps finally arrived, the division of Maj. Gen. James S. Wadsworth. The troops were led personally by Gen. Reynolds, who conferred briefly with Buford and hurried back to bring more men forward.|$|E
5|$|In 1962, Melbourne {{began the}} year's {{activities}} at the Royal Hobart Regatta, before sailing to her Strategic Reserve deployment, by way of Adelaide and Fremantle. After Strategic Reserve duties were completed, the carrier visited Japan, Guam, and Manus Island before returning to Sydney in late July. In September, Melbourne reprised her role {{as the leader of}} Exercise Tuckerbox II. The 10,000th catapult launch from Melbourne occurred in late 1962. The carrier's annual refit began in Sydney on 1 October. At the beginning of 1963, Melbourne again visited to the Royal Hobart Regatta, which was immediately followed by a deployment to the Strategic Reserve, including involvement in SEATO Exercise Sea Serpent. The 20,000th landing on Melbourne was performed in April by a Gannet, and in September, Melbourne participated in Exercise <b>Carbine</b> near Hervey Bay, Queensland.|$|E
5|$|In {{the midst}} of this drive on Taegu, an {{ammunition}} shortage became critical for the UN forces. The situation was such that United Nations Commander General of the Army Douglas MacArthur on September 9 sent messages urging that two ammunition ships then en route to Yokohama, Japan and Pusan carrying 172,790 rounds of 105-mm. shells, with estimated arrival time September 11, proceed at maximum speed consistent with the safety of the vessels. Eighth Army on September 10 reduced the ration of 105-mm. howitzer ammunition from 50 to 25 rounds per howitzer per day, except in cases of emergency. <b>Carbine</b> ammunition was also in critical short supply. The 17th Field Artillery Battalion, with the first 8-inch howitzers to arrive in Korea, could not engage in the battle for lack of ammunition.|$|E
5000|$|Weapons Officers Carbines: These {{standard}} m/1894 <b>carbines</b> were hand-built by weapons officers as part {{of their}} training. Instead of having serial numbers, the name of the weapons officer is the identifying [...] "serial" [...] mark. Most of the parts are marked with the two letters of the officer's name and in some cases with a + sign. These <b>carbines</b> are among the most valuable of collectible m/1894 <b>carbines.</b>|$|R
50|$|As <b>carbines</b> were reconditioned, parts {{such as the}} {{magazine}} catch, rear sight, barrel band without bayonet lug, and stock were upgraded with current standard-issue parts. Also, both during and after WW2, many semi-automatic M1 <b>carbines</b> were converted to select-fire M2 <b>carbines</b> by using the T17 and T18 conversion kits. The conversion included a modified sear and slide and added a disconnector, disconnector lever, and selector switch that could be set for semi-auto or full-automatic fire.|$|R
50|$|In 1867, the War Department {{authorized}} sale of many weapons, including 19,551 {{weapons at}} the Leavenworth arsenal in Kansas. This sale included Wesson <b>carbines,</b> {{as well as}} many other revolvers, rifles and <b>carbines</b> of the period (29 different types).|$|R
5|$|Lt. Draza is Zoran Lazarevic's {{right-hand}} man and an antagonist of Uncharted 2: Among Thieves. He is voiced by Michael Benyaer in Uncharted 2 and by Fred Tatasciore in Uncharted 3. Lt. Draza is first seen with Lazarevic, {{when they first}} meet Nate face to face. Lazarevic gives him the Phurba from Nate. Later, when Chloe is taken to the train by Flynn, Nate tries to save her, but runs into Draza, {{who is in charge}} of the train. The two fight until Drake knocks Draza and takes back the Phurba. Draza wakes up and tries to strangle Drake, but is shot dead from behind by Chloe. According to some articles, Draza and Lazarevic have known each other for a long time. He uses an M4 <b>carbine</b> (a misnamed Colt Model 723) as his main weapon.|$|E
5|$|The single cavalry {{division}} {{assigned to}} the BEF in 1914 consisted of 15 cavalry regiments in five brigades. They were armed with rifles, unlike their French and German counterparts, who were only armed with the shorter range <b>carbine.</b> The cavalry division also had a high allocation of artillery compared to foreign cavalry divisions, with 24 13-pounder guns organised into two brigades and two machine guns for each regiment. When dismounted, the cavalry division {{was the equivalent of}} two weakened infantry brigades with less artillery than the infantry division. By 1916, there were five cavalry divisions, each of three brigades, serving in France, the 1st, 2nd, 3rd divisions in the Cavalry Corps and the 1st and 2nd Indian Cavalry Divisions in the Indian Cavalry Corps, each brigade in the Indian cavalry corps contained a British cavalry regiment.|$|E
5|$|A {{little after}} two {{o'clock in the}} afternoon, Victorio and his Apaches slowly {{approached}} the springs. Victorio somehow sensed danger and halted his men. With the hostile Apaches in their sights appearing ready to bolt, the soldiers did not wait and opened fire on their own initiative; Victorio's men scattered and withdrew out of <b>carbine</b> range. Victorio's people needed water and believing that {{there were only a few}} soldiers present, regrouped and attacked immediately. As the battle progressed, Victorio sent his warriors to flank the soldiers. Carpenter charged forward with Companies B and H and a few massed volleys from their carbines sent the hostiles scattering back up the canyon. Stunned by the presence of such a strong force but in desperate need of water, Victorio repeatedly charged the cavalrymen in attempts to reach the spring. Grierson's cavalry defenders, now bolstered by Carpenter's two companies, stood firm. The last such attempt to break the soldiers was conducted near nightfall and when it failed, Victorio and his followers withdrew into the westward into the mountains. Carpenter with his two companies remounted in pursuit until darkness halted the effort.|$|E
50|$|The {{regiment}} {{was mounted}} from May 1863 to November 1864. Spencer <b>carbines,</b> invented by Christopher Spencer, were introduced at this time. In combat, the <b>carbines,</b> shorter and {{lighter than the}} rifle version, were first used in the Battle of Hoover's Gap.|$|R
50|$|The smaller {{size and}} {{relative}} lighter weight of <b>carbines</b> makes them easier to handle in close-quarter situations such as urban engagements, when deploying from military vehicles, {{or in any}} situation where space is confined. The disadvantages of <b>carbines</b> relative to rifles include inferior long-range accuracy and a shorter effective range (when referring to <b>carbines</b> of the same power and class as the rifle). Larger than a submachine gun, they are harder to maneuver in tight encounters where superior range and stopping power at distance are not great considerations. Firing the same ammunition as standard-issue rifles or pistols gives <b>carbines</b> the advantage of standardization over those personal defense weapons (PDWs) that require proprietary cartridges.|$|R
5000|$|The Berthier design {{began as}} the [...] "Mousquetons Berthier" [...] - {{a series of}} bolt action cavalry and {{artillery}} <b>carbines</b> with distinctly different actions from the Mle 1886/M93 8mm Lebel rifle. For instance, the Berthier <b>carbine's</b> bolt lugs lock vertically into the receiver instead of horizontally as in the Lebel rifle. Berthier <b>carbines</b> were first issued in 1890 and 1892, and had been designed by Emile Berthier, an engineer at the French Algerian Railways,to be used with standard 8mm Lebel ammunition.|$|R
