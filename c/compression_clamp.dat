30|$|Non-union {{after high}} tibial {{osteotomy}} {{is an unusual}} complication [10, 11, 12] as the proximal tibial metaphysis is a broad surface of well-vascularized cancellous bone with good healing potential. Coventry reported a series of 213 osteotomies with no non-unions [11]. Hsu reported only one non-union {{in a series of}} 118 Maquet dome osteotomies secured with Charnley’s external compression fixators, and Bauer et al. reported one non-union in 66 cases [10, 12]. The metaphyseal location of the non-union after high tibial osteotomy can make stable fixation problematic because the proximal fragment is small and difficult to control with most conventional methods of internal fixation. Resection of the pseudarthrosis, external fixation with Charnley’s <b>compression</b> <b>clamps</b> followed by casting, was proposed by Tjornstand et al. in one of the first series of HTO non-unions [13]. Although this resulted in bony union, resection of the pseudarthrosis in one of their patients resulted in such a thin proximal tibial fragment that compression had to be applied across the knee joint.|$|R
40|$|Arthrodesis {{after the}} removal of a knee {{prosthesis}} is often hampered by the small area of contact of the bony surfaces and by pre-existing infection. Conventional systems of external fixation and compression frequently fail to achieve stability but the addition ofthe Wagnerleg-lengthening apparatus applied anteriorly and adjusted to give compression ensures rigid external fixation. Four knees in four patients were treated using this technique; the treatment followed {{the removal of}} infected prostheses in three knees and painful fibrous ankylosis after {{the removal of the}} prosthesis in the other. All obtained a sound arthrodesis. Arthrodesis following the removal of a total knee prosthesis can be difficult. External fixation with compression (Charnley 1948) is commonly used and is the method of choice in the presence of infection. However, because the area of bony contact is small and because of the shape of the distal femur (Fig. 1) stability in the plane of flexion and extension is difficult to achieve by means of coronal <b>compression</b> <b>clamps</b> alone. The addition of the Wagner leg-lengthening apparatus (Wag-ner 1972, 1978), applied anteriorly and adjusted to give compression, produces rigid fixation. Four cases in which a sound arthrodesis was obtained by the above technique are reported. S Fig. I Lateral drawing of the arthrodesis surfaces following removal of a prosthesis.

40|$|Objective: {{to study}} results of {{arthrodesis}} {{of the first}} metatarsophalangeal joint (I MPT joint) in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and hallux valgus, assess methods of arthrodesis fixation, reveal complications and analyze longterm results. Subjects and methods. Authors observed 86 patients with RA, female : male ratio 3. 2 : 1, mean age was 53. 8 ± 9. 5  years (from 18 to 75 years); 80 from them had seropositive and 6 – seronegative RA. 72 patients had low, and 14 –moderate activity of the disease. II stage of RA was revealed in 31. 4 %, III – in 62. 8 %, IV – in 5. 8 %; 52. 3 % of  patients had I and 47. 7 % – II functional class. All patients  ad hallux valgus {{as a component of}} typical deformation of the forefoot – digitis V rheumaticus (DVR). Standard global reconstructive operation (SGRO) and its modification (MGRO) were used. Both techniques included arthrodesis of the I MTP joint where fusion of bones was fixed with Kirschner wire and <b>compression</b> <b>clamps</b> in groups A and B respectively. Results of surgical treatment were assessed separately for I and II–V toes. The present work provides solely the results of the I MTP joint arthrodesis. Results.

Inefficiency of arthrodesis of the I MTP joint was observed in 3 patients from the group B (2. 15 %). Before operation, 3 from 141 feet had hallux valgus of the II stage (21 – 40 °); III (41 – 60 °) and IV (> 60 °) stages of hallux valgus were recorded in 90 and 48 feet respectively. Following 2. 3 years after arthrodesis normal I MTP joints (10 – 11 °) were observed in 131 feet whereas, that of the II stage of hallux valgus (12 – 20 °) – in 10 feet. Conclusion. High efficacy of arthrodesis of the I MTP joint in patients with RA and hallux valgus and, subsequently, low failure rate (2. 15 %) were achieved as a result of appropriate techniques of arthrodesis fixation. Positive long-term results (according to AOFAS questionnaire) in 2. 3 years after the operation were recorded in 97. 8 % of cases. </p...|$|R
30|$|We have {{simulated}} {{clinical conditions}} {{by use of}} saw bone models; we recruited subjects with experience in mounting frames and instructed them to assemble these constructs {{in a manner similar}} to their clinical practice. In the first part of the experiment, loosening torque values were determined. These are not the same as the tightening torque values as different forces are involved (static vs dynamic). Values obtained demonstrate statistically significant higher loosening torque values when bolts are used to secure half pins. This suggests a higher torque is applied when half pins are secured with bolts. We surmise the difference is due to a wrench (spanner) being used in contrast to the straight hex driver for grub screws. The axial <b>compression</b> force (<b>clamp</b> force) applied through either bolt or grub screw would determine the security of hold at the half pin–Rancho cube interface. This clamp force is affected by many other variables too: the bolt diameter. The type and number of threads on the bolt, the bolt material and the torque applied. The last variable is that under control by the surgeon and may influence the likelihood of these constructs to failure.|$|R

The finite element formulation is based on first order and higher order shear deformation theory, degenerated shell element, von-Karman hypothesis and piezoelectric effect. The equation for static analysis is derived by using the minimum energy principle and solutions for critical buckling load is obtained by solving eigenvalue problem. The material properties of the functionally graded plate are assumed to be graded along the thickness direction according to simple power law function. Two types of boundary conditions are used, such as SSSS (simply supported) and CSCS (simply supported along two opposite side perpendicular to the direction of <b>compression</b> and <b>clamped</b> along the other two sides).

40|$|We {{have adapted}} our {{existing}} compression‐induced fracture technology to cell culture studies by generating linear patterns on a complex cell culture well structure {{rather than on}} simple solid constructs. We present a simple method to create one‐dimensional (1 D), submicron, and linear patterns of extracellular matrix on a multilayer silicone material. We identified critical design parameters necessary to optimize compression‐induced fracture patterning on the wells, and applied stresses using <b>compression</b> Hoffman <b>clamps.</b> Finite‐element analyses show that the incorporation of the well improves stress homogeneity (stress variation = 25 %), and, thus, crack uniformity over the patterned region. Notably, a shallow well with a thick base (vs. deeper wells with thinner bases) reduces out‐of‐plane deflections by greater than a sixth in the cell culture region, improving clarity for optical imaging. The comparison of cellular and nuclear shape indices of a neuroblast line cultured on patterned 1 D lines and unpatterned 2 D surfaces reveals significant differences in cellular morphology, which could impact many cellular functions. Because 1 D cell cultures recapitulate many important phenotypical traits of 3 D cell cultures, our culture system offers a simple means to further study the relationship between 1 D and 3 D cell culture environments, without demanding expensive engineering techniques and expertise. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

40|$|Abstract: Sandwich {{structures}} {{consisting of}} high-modulus thin skins and a low-modulus thick core {{are sensitive to}} local loading, which causes local indentation. Classical approaches deter-mine the deflection of sandwich structures by a superposition method where the local compres-sion of the core for a panel on a rigid foundation is added to global sandwich bending without core compression. In this article, a sandwich plate is analyzed using a higher-order sandwich panel theory (HOSPT) where the faces are modelled by classical laminate theory and the core by a three-dimensional elasticity solution. The results are obtained from 14 partial differential equa-tions for displacements of the faces and core. HOSPT determines core compression with a second-order distribution of displacement through the core thickness. The force versus core compression relations in the fully backed and clamped states are compared and it is shown that the core compression assumed in the classical approach differs from the core <b>compression</b> in a <b>clamped</b> state. Results are verified by ANSYS FEM software and experimental data. A few sandwich panel specimens were made with glass reinforced plastic (GRP) skins and a polyure-thane foam core.

40|$|The thesis gives a {{comprehensive}} study of elastic instability in growing yeast colonies and thin sheets. The differential adhesion between cells {{is believed to be}} the major driving force behind the formation of tissues. The idea is that an aggregate of cells minimizes the overall adhesive energy between cell surfaces. We demonstrate in a model experimental system that there exist conditions where a slowly growing tissue does not minimize this adhesive energy. A mathematical model demonstrates that the instability of a spherical shape is caused by the competition between elastic and surface energies. The mechanism is similar to the Asaro-Tiller instability in prestressed solids. We also study the buckling of a highly constrained thin elastic plate under edge compression. The plate is clamped lengthwise on two edges and constrained by foam pieces along one of the shorter edges. The remaining edge is free. Applying uniform <b>compression</b> along the <b>clamped</b> edges generates a cascade of parabolic singularities. We apply the theories pioneered by Pogorelov, who showed that any zero gaussian curvature surfaces are solutions of the von Karman equations. When two such surfaces intersect, the adjoint surfaces remains a solution everywhere except at the boundary of intersection. However, for small plate thickness and the asymptotic limit, it is possible to construct a solution for the boundary. The total energy of the solution is then given as the sum of the energy of individual surfaces and the boundary energy. We demonstrate that by intersecting a cone and a cylinder the deformation of a parabolic singularity is entirely determined. by Baochi Thai Nguyen. Thesis (Ph. D.)

40|$|ObjectiveThe {{incidence}} of cranial and cervical nerve injury during carotid endarterectomy (CEA) ranges {{from less than}} 7. 6 % to more than 50 %. Lesions are mainly due to surgical maneuvers such as traction, <b>compression,</b> tissue electrocoagulation, <b>clamping,</b> and extensive dissections. The use of dexamethasone (DEX) and its beneficial effects in spinal cord injuries have already been described. We investigated whether DEX could also be beneficial to minimize the {{incidence of}} cranial and cervical nerve injury during CEA. PurposeTo evaluate whether dexamethasone is able to {{reduce the incidence of}} cranial nerve injuries. Materials and MethodsFrom March 1999 through April 2006, 1126 patients undergoing CEA because of high-grade carotid stenosis were enrolled and randomized by predetermined randomization tables into two groups. The first group, “A”, included 586 patients that all received an intravenous administration of dexamethasone following a therapeutic scheme. The second group, “B”, included 540 control subjects that received the standard pre- and postoperative therapy. All patients were submitted to a deep cervical plexus block, eversion carotid endarterectomy, and selective shunting. Three days after the operation, an independent neurologist and otorhinolaryngologist evaluated the presence of cranial nerve deficits. All patients (group A and group B) showing nerve injuries continued the treatment (8 mg of dexamethasone once in the morning) for 7 days and were re-evaluated after 2 weeks, 30 days, and every 3 months for 1 year. Recovery time took from 2 weeks to 12 months, with a mean time of 3. 6 months. The χ 2 test was used to compare the two groups and to check for statistical significance. ResultsThe incidence of cranial nerve dysfunction was higher in group B and the statistical analysis showed a significant effect of dexamethasone in preventing the neurological damage (P =. 0081). The incidence of temporary lesions was lower in group A and the χ 2 test yielded a P value of. 006. No statistically significant differences were found when comparing the effect of dexamethasone in men and women. In addition, dexamethasone had no statistically significant effect on the incidence of permanent cranial nerve injuries. Finally, no adverse effect related to the administration of dexamethasone was observed. ConclusionPerioperative administration of dexamethasone is effective in minimizing the incidence of temporary cranial nerve injuries during CEA...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Urinary {{incontinence}} {{is common}} after radical prostatectomy {{and can also}} occur in some circumstances after transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP). Conservative management includes pelvic floor muscle training with or without biofeedback, electrical stimulation, extra-corporeal magnetic innervation (ExMI), <b>compression</b> devices (penile <b>clamps),</b> lifestyle changes, {{or a combination of}} methods. OBJECTIVES: To determine the effectiveness of conservative management for urinary incontinence up to 12 months after transurethral, suprapubic, laparoscopic, radical retropubic or perineal prostatectomy, including any single conservative therapy or any combination of conservative therapies. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Incontinence Group Specialised Register (5 February 2014), CENTRAL (2014, Issue 1), EMBASE (January 2010 to Week 3 2014), CINAHL (January 1982 to 18 January 2014), ClinicalTrials. gov and World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (both searched 29 January 2014), and the reference lists of relevant articles. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trials evaluating conservative interventions for urinary continence in men after prostatectomy. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two or more review authors assessed the methodological quality of the trials and abstracted data. We tried to contact several authors of included studies to obtain extra information. MAIN RESULTS: Fifty trials met the inclusion criteria, 45 in men after radical prostatectomy, four trials after TURP and one trial after either operation. The trials included 4717 men of whom 2736 had an active conservative intervention. There was considerable variation in the interventions, populations and outcome measures. Data were not available for many of the pre-stated outcomes. Men's symptoms improved over time irrespective of management. There was no evidence from eight trials that pelvic floor muscle training with or without biofeedback was better than control for men who had urinary incontinence up to 12 months after radical prostatectomy; the quality of the evidence was judged to be moderate (for example 57 % with urinary incontinence in the intervention group versus 62 % in the control group, risk ratio (RR) for incontinence after 12 months 0. 85, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 0. 60 to 1. 22). One large multi-centre trial of one-to-one therapy showed no difference in any urinary or quality of life outcome measures and had narrow CIs. It seems unlikely that men benefit from one-to-one PFMT therapy after TURP. Individual small trials provided data to suggest that electrical stimulation, external magnetic innervation, or combinations of treatments might be beneficial but the evidence was limited. Amongst trials of conservative treatment for all men after radical prostatectomy, aimed at both treatment and prevention, there was moderate evidence of an overall benefit from pelvic floor muscle training versus control management in terms of reduction of urinary incontinence (for example 10 % with urinary incontinence after one year in the intervention groups versus 32 % in the control groups, RR for urinary incontinence 0. 32, 95 % CI 0. 20 to 0. 51). However, this finding was not supported by other data from pad tests. The findings should be treated with caution because the risk of bias assessment showed methodological limitations. Men in one trial were more satisfied with one type of external compression device, which had the lowest urine loss, compared to two others or no treatment. The effect of other conservative interventions such as lifestyle changes remained undetermined as no trials involving these interventions were identified. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The value of the various approaches to conservative management of postprostatectomy incontinence after radical prostatectomy remains uncertain. The evidence is conflicting and therefore rigorous, adequately powered randomised controlled trials (RCTs) which abide by the principles and recommendations of the CONSORT statement are still needed to obtain a definitive answer. The trials should be robustly designed to answer specific well constructed research questions and include outcomes which are important from the patient's perspective in decision making and are also relevant to the healthcare professionals. Long-term incontinence may be managed by an external penile clamp, but there are safety problems...|$|R

However, one large multicentre trial of one-to-one therapy showed no difference in any urinary or quality of life outcome measures and had narrower confidence intervals.

Individual small trials provided data to suggest that electrical stimulation, external magnetic innervation or combinations of treatments might be beneficial but the evidence was limited. One large trial demonstrated that there was no benefit for incontinence or erectile dysfunction from a one-to-one pelvic floor muscle training based intervention to men who were incontinent after transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) (e. g. 65 % with urinary incontinence versus 62 % in the control group, RR after 12 months 1. 05, 95 % CI 0. 91 to 1. 23).

40|$|The {{research}} {{presented in}} this thesis aims to deepen {{our understanding of the}} effect of micro-alloying on the microstructure and mechanical property evolution during tempering of martensitic steel for fasteners. The ongoing trend of engine down-sizing has led to the need for stronger and more temperature resistant fasteners than currently available according to international standards. A new martensitic fastener steel called KNDS 4 has been developed, that combines higher strength with improved resistance to hydrogen embrittlement. The higher strength {{is the result of the}} addition of small amounts of alloying elements such as Ti, V and Mo that can form alloy carbides. The improved resistance to hydrogen embrittlement is ascribed to the presence of nano-sized alloy carbides. However, in addition to enhancing strength and resistance to hydrogen embrittlement, alloy carbides are also able to improve the creep resistance of steels via pinning of dislocations at elevated temperature. It might therefore be possible to use the new fastener steel at higher service temperatures than the current high-strength fasteners. In order to optimize the properties of the new fastener steel, a fundamental understanding is needed of the relationship between the evolution of the microstructure and the hardness/strength during heat treatment. The research questions of the research are: (i) To which extent do different hardening mechanisms contribute to the strength of martensitic fastener steels? (ii) How do the different hardening mechanisms evolve as a function of time during annealing? (iii) What are the effects of a strong carbide forming element such as titanium on the microstructure and hardening mechanisms of martensitic fastener steel? (iv) Can the strength and temperature resistance of a martensitic fastener steel be improved by addition of carbide forming elements? The initial part of the research is based on a model alloy without the presence of any carbide forming elements that is compared to a model alloy with only one carbide forming element, Ti, in order to study the influence of a single alloy carbide on the microstructure and properties. Thereafter, industrial fastener steels, with multiple carbide forming elements, are studied, where complex alloy carbides form. Chapter 2 describes the industrial context that lead to the research described in this PhD-thesis. This background chapter consist of three main sections. Section 2. 1 gives an introduction on bolted joints in the automotive industry. The bolted joint is defined as the system consisting of the bolt itself, and the components that are held together by the bolt. The purpose of the bolt, to keep the assembled components together by <b>compression</b> via a <b>clamp</b> force, is discussed and the distribution of external forces into the bolted joint is reviewed for different load cases. The influence of settlement (loss of clamping force due to localized plastic deformation in the joint after assembly) is reviewed and the fatigue properties of the bolt in a bolted joint are briefly discussed, in terms of distribution of an alternating external load into the bolted joint. The chapter ends with a review of the key mechanical properties of engine fasteners and an explanation of how current fastener steels are chosen. Section 2. 2 introduces the concept of strength and hardness and temperature resistance of metals. The theory of dislocations and dislocation movement is briefly explained and the mechanisms behind different types of dislocation movements are presented. The link between dislocation movement and strength of metals is explained and the different microstructure components that contribute to the total strength and hardness of a metal are reviewed. Equations for quantification of the strengthening mechanisms are presented and literature values related to steel are given. The (nearly) instantaneous and time-dependent (creep) effects of an external load at elevated temperature on the strength and deformation of steel are described. Creep is the time-dependent and permanent deformation of a metal under constant external loading. The mechanical behavior during the different stages of creep is discussed and the microstructural mechanisms behind creep are reviewed. Expressions for different mechanisms of creep are given. Section 2. 2 ends with a review of different methods to measure creep, with special focus on the indentation creep method, since this method was used for the research of this Ph. D. study. Section 2. 3 presents martensite formation and precipitation-strengthening of martensite. The Fe-C phase diagram and the theory of martensite formation, according to the Bain theory, is discussed. The crystallography of lath martensite is presented and related to the strength via the hardening mechanisms presented in section 2. 2. The evolution of the microstructure which takes place during tempering of martensite is summarized. Nucleation of precipitates, according to the classical nucleation theory, is presented and the energy terms which influence the nucleation of new phases are reviewed. The mechanisms of diffusion- and interface-controlled growth are presented. The Zener or diffusional growth is reviewed in more detail. Section 2. 3 ends with a summary of the characteristics of TiC precipitates and the kinetic data related to the nucleation and growth of TiC in steel, since this precipitate type is specifically studied in the thesis. Chapter 3 is an experimental study of the evolution of the hardness and microstructure in Fe-C-Mn martensite (that is free of alloy carbides) during isothermal annealing at 300 °C. The hardness near martensite block boundaries is significantly higher than the hardness inside the block matrix, due to a higher dislocation density in the regions adjacent to the block boundaries (called boundary regions). The boundary regions soften with increasing tempering time, whereas the nano-hardness of the tempered matrix remains approximately constant with increasing tempering time. The softening kinetics of Fe-C-Mn martensite can be described by three stages, which are related to the evolution of the microstructure: Stage I (0 - 5 min) is characterized by fast macroscopic softening kinetics that is strongly related to: (a) fast and simultaneous softening and reduction in area fraction of boundaries regions (b) fast reduction in area fraction of non-tempered matrix regions. Stage II (5 - 10 min) is characterized by slow macroscopic softening kinetics that is related to slow softening and reduction in area fraction of the boundaries regions. Stage III (10 - 60 min) is characterized by very slow softening kinetics that is related to very slow softening and reduction in area fraction of boundary regions. Chapter 4 is an experimental study of the influence of the addition of 0. 042 wt% Ti on the evolution of the microstructure and hardness of Fe-C-Mn steel during isothermal annealing at 300 °C and at 550 °C. The macroscopic hardness of Ti-containing and Ti-free Fe-C-Mn steel reduces rapidly during the first 5 minutes of tempering, due to (i) the redistribution of interstitially dissolved carbon into cementite and (ii) rapid recovery. The macroscopic hardness thereafter remains stable during continued annealing for the Ti-free steel, but the Ti-containing steel increases in hardness after 30 minutes of annealing at 550 °C. The hardness increase of Ti-containing Fe-C-Mn-Ti steel is related to the formation of TiC-precipitates at 550 °C. Nucleation of TiC-precipitates starts in the regions close to the martensite block boundaries (between 5 - 10 minutes) and subsequently nucleates in the block matrix (between 10 - 30 minutes) due to the higher dislocation density in the regions close to the block boundaries. The formation of TiC-precipitates slows down the recovery in the regions close to the martensite block boundaries, especially between 5 and 10 minutes of annealing. The growth of TiC-precipitates in martensite is simulated in good agreement with experimental observations with a model that takes capillarity effects, the overlap of the titanium diffusion fields and the effects of pipe diffusion of titanium atoms into account. Chapter 5 is a computational study on the evolution of the hardening mechanisms in Fe-C-Mn-Ti steel during isothermal annealing. The hardness of martensite is simulated as a linear addition of multiple strengthening mechanisms. This hardness model is combined with a microstructural model based on the Kampmann-Wagner-Numerical (KWN) approach for a multi-component and multi-phase system to simulate the nucleation and growth of TiC-precipitates. The model is fitted to experimental results and used to simulate the hardness contribution of different microstructure components as a function of annealing time. The two microstructural components which contribute most to the overall hardness of the investigated Fe-C-Mn-Ti steel are Fe 3 C precipitates (88 HV) and dislocations (54 HV) on a total of 284 HV. Both contributions decrease rapidly during the initial stages of annealing and stabilise after 10 minutes of annealing. The addition of titanium to the steel gives a minor hardness contribution via Ti-atoms in solid solution and TiC precipitates. Ti atoms in solid solution give a hardness contribution which increases slightly during the first few minutes of annealing and then remains stable (at 25 HV). The direct contribution of TiC precipitates to the overall hardness is limited (3. 5 HV). However, TiC-precipitates also contribute to the overall hardness by pinning of dislocations during the recovery that takes place during the tempering. The model predicts that only a small volume fraction of TiC-precipitates forms during isothermal annealing at 550 °C due to the large misfit strain (1. 34 GJ/m 3) and the low density of potential nucleation sites. Chapter 6 presents a comparative study of the evolution of mechanical properties at elevated temperature and the underlying microstructural mechanisms of ultra-high-strength and conventional high-strength steels for fasteners. The mechanical properties of the ultrahigh-strength steel KNDS 4 of fastener grade 14. 9 (strength 1400 MPa, yield-to-strength ration 0. 9) and of conventional, high-strength steels 34 Cr 4 of fastener grade 12. 9 (strength 1200 MPa, yield-to-tensile-strength ration 0. 9) and 33 B 2 of grade 10. 9 (strength 1000 MPa, yield-to-tensile-tensile-strength ration 0. 9) are measured at room temperature and at elevated temperature. The alloy carbides in the steels are examined in order to investigate the underlying microstructural mechanisms that give rise to the different properties of the three fastener steels. KNDS 4 steel has a higher yield strength ratio than both conventional high strength steels at 500 °C, which have similar yield strength ratios at 500 °C. Increasing the soaking time from 5 seconds up to 100 hours at elevated temperatures does not have an impact on the yield strength ratio. The nano-indentation creep rate shows a weak trend in which the tendency for deformation during constant load nano-indentation is lower in KNDS 4 than in the 34 Cr 4 and 33 B 2 steels. This is measured both at similar indent depths and at the same indent time. The improved mechanical properties of the KNDS 4 steel compared to the conventional high-strength steels are related alloy carbides in the microstructure that hinder dislocation movement. The alloy carbides in KNDS 4 are smaller than the alloy carbides in 34 Cr 4 steel, and the properties are therefore better. Changing the standard industrial heat-treatment from an austenitization temperature of 940 to 1350 °C can increase the hardness of KNDS 4 by 8 %. The increase stems from more effective dissolution of mainly Ti during the austenitization treatment. Titanium in solid solution enables nucleation and growth of precipitates, which generates precipitation strengthening during subsequent tempering. However, the standard industrial heat treatment results in a smaller martensite block size, which might be more beneficial for the toughness of the steel. The study of martensitic model alloys showed that the martensite block structure remain stable at temperatures up to 550 °C, whereas the redistribution of alloying elements such as carbon is rapid and cannot be prevented. The study of the model alloys furthermore confirmed that addition of a strong carbide forming element, such as Ti, results in nucleation of a fine dispersion of alloy carbides that prevents recovery and thereby adds both precipitation strengthening and dislocation strengthening to the steel. Our study of the industrial fastener steels thereafter confirmed that alloy carbides in martensite increases the temperature resistance of the steel, by maintaining a high yield strength at elevated temperatures. The study of the industrial steels furthermore showed that the tendency to material creep at room temperatures is reduced in steels with alloy carbide precipitates. Development of more temperature resistant high strength steels for fasteners shall therefore be based on the strengthening mechanisms of grain boundaries and on alloy carbide precipitates. Our research furthermore showed that there is a need for further studies of traditional, axial creep testing, to fully understand and evaluate the beneficial effects of alloy carbides in martensitic steels. For the application of the existing KNDS 4 steel we find that, independent of the heat treatment, the mechanical performance of KNDS 4 fasteners at elevated temperature and the low nano-indentation creep rates are two strong indicators that fasteners made from KNDS 4 steel might be used at higher service temperatures than traditional high strength fasteners, due to the presence of small alloy carbides in the microstructure of KNDS 4. Higher strength of a fastener steel enables development of smaller, but stronger fasteners. These fasteners can be used in critical applications inside the engine, to down-size e. g. connecting rods, which will make it possible to significantly reduce the size and weight of modern combustion engines. Furthermore, the improved temperature resistance of new martensitic fastener steels will allow using the fastener at elevated service temperatures. These fasteners can therefore be used in applications where the temperature exceeds the recommended service temperature of 150 °C (with the maximum upper boundary of 300 °C) as stated in ISO 898 - 1. This make is possible to reduce the use of highly alloyed high temperature fasteners (which are designed for service temperatures of 500 °C or more) that are used in engines today due to the lack of cost efficient, resource-efficient, micro-alloyed fastener steels suitable for service at 300 - 500 °C.
