40|$|Abstract – The factor {{distinguishing}} between normal concrete and mass concrete is the thermal characteristics. Mass concrete {{is defined as}} “any volume of concrete with dimensions large enough to require that measures be taken to cope with generation of heat from hydration of the cement and attendant volume change to minimize cracking. ” Use of mass concrete has been in existence {{over the last two}} centuries, and it has lately been reaching its full potential in the construction industry. The proper design and construction of mass <b>concrete</b> <b>placements</b> is essential to ensure the durability and serviceability of the structure. Mass concrete is required in massive structures containing beams, columns, piers, dams where its volume is of such a magnitude as to require special means for coping with the generation of heat and which is followed by volume change.

It is difficult to cast the whole structure monolithically if the concrete elements are large size; there are some limitations to the availability of formwork, concrete workers or supply of the fresh concrete. In such cases, it becomes necessary to perform structure elements in two or more stages, which leads to formation joints - plane of weakness or discontinuity formed when a batch of concrete hardens before the next batch is placed. Correctly located and properly executed construction joints provide limits for successive <b>concrete</b> <b>placements,</b> without adversely affecting on structure.

The introduction of steel fibres in concrete beam has been proposed as flexural cracks inhibitor. This research of steel fibres as flexural cracks inhibitor in concrete beam under static loading was conducted focusing on simply supported beam to determine the crack propagations in flexure by varying the steel fibre content placement in the beam. The 25 kg/m 3 steel fibre was chosen for this study since the optimum concrete strength (fcu) is achieved with this steel fibre dosage. Seven sets of concrete beams of 150 mm x 250 mm x 1000 mm in size consists of three RC beams with full steel fibrous concrete (SFRC), three RC beams with steel fibre placed within tension zone of the beam, three RC beams with steel fibre placed at the half o f tension zone of the beam, two conventional RC beams (without steel fibre) as control sample, one unreinforced concrete beam with full steel fibre, one unreinforced concrete beam with steel fibre at tension zone only and one unreinforced concrete beam with steel fibre at half of tension zone.

40|$|Large volume {{concrete}} {{continues to}} present increasing {{concern in the}} construction of bridges. Due to the increased heat generation during massive concrete foundation construction, the concern for cracking, resulting from thermal contraction, is increased. To reduce the thermal cracking potential and ensure the safety and durability of the foundation structure, several practices are utilized, such as using low heat generating cement, proper insulation, cooling pipes and so forth. The objectives of this research are to explore the current available early age mass concrete thermal analysis software packages and provide recommendations for mass concrete construction practices. Currently, there are several computer software packages capable of evaluating the early age development of concrete. 4 C Temp 2 ̆ 6 Stress, which is discussed in detail in this study, is a user friendly and flexible software package capable of analyzing mass concrete structures. The sensitivity study results of using 4 C Temp 2 ̆ 6 Stress indicate that a reduced least dimension, extended for removal time, and reduced fresh placement temperature could reduce the maximum temperature and decrease cracking potential. Current insulation and formwork materials and practices are confirmed to be to a practical approach in mass concrete construction. The recommended layout and dimensions of post cooling systems will be discussed to provide the most efficiency cooling system.

In particular, a lack of nighttime illumination required that construction be stopped {{at the end of each}} day, and a poor understanding of the bonding properties of concrete caused weak points between daily pours of concrete, causing layers of concrete to separate under stress of bombardment or explosion. These faults were cured with the reconstruction of other forts, the use of reinforced concrete, and with the construction of four new forts facing the German frontier to the east of Liége. The largest of these was Fort Eben-Emael, which would play a significant role at the beginning of the Second World War.|$|R

The objectives of the present research are: (1) to {{have an understanding of}} how different mix proportions, construction, and environmental conditions affect the thermal development of mass concrete. (2) To identify and compare the similarities and differences of mass concrete specifications for different agencies throughout the United States.

A case study was developed for two typical Midwest boarder bridges, and was utilized to calibrate and verify ConcreteWorks. ConcreteWorks is a concrete thermal analysis software program, capable of predicting the early age thermal behavior of mass concrete. ConcreteWorks was then utilized to validate conditions that are believed to have the largest effect on the thermal development of mass concrete. The research also provides two case studies of typical Midwest boarder bridges that may be used to calibrate other thermal analysis software programs. Through the sensitivity study, the research also verifies conditions that have the largest effect on the thermal development of mass concrete for Midwest boarder bridges.
