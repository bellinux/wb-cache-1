'The chief {{characteristic}} of the warriors of Sparta was great composure and subdued strength; the violence [Greek: lyssa] of Aristodemus and Isadas being considered as deserving rather of blame than praise; and these qualities in general distinguished the Greeks from the northern Barbarians, whose boldness always consisted in noise and tumult. For the same reason the Spartans sacrificed to the Muses before an action; these goddesses being expected to produce regularity and order in battle; as they sacrificed on the same occasion in Crete to the god of love, as the <b>confirmer</b> of mutual esteem and shame. Every man put on a crown, when the band of flute-players gave the signal for attack; all the shields of the line glittered with their high polish, and mingled their splendour with the dark red of the purple mantles, which were meant both to adorn the combatant, and to conceal {{the blood of the}} wounded; to fall well and decorously being an incentive the more to the most heroic valour. The conduct of the Spartans in battle denotes a high and noble disposition, which rejected all the extremes of brutal rage. The pursuit of the enemy ceased when the victory was completed; and after the signal for retreat had been given, all hostilities ceased. The spoiling of arms, at least during the battle, was also interdicted; and the consecration of the spoils of slain enemies to the gods, as, in general, all rejoicings for victory, were considered as ill-omened.|$|E

The ways to share the signing capability and the confirming capability are different due to the distinct stabilities of the signer group and the <b>confirmer</b> group. Based on the techniques of threshold cryptography, a concrete SDCS scheme is proposed and its security is analyzed. Ordinary designated <b>confirmer</b> signatures and threshold designated <b>confirmer</b> signatures can be regarded as special cases of the proposed society-oriented designated <b>confirmer</b> signatures.

40|$|As an {{extension}} of digital signature, designated <b>confirmer</b> signature (DCS) efficiently realizes the privacy protection of the signer. In a DCS scheme, {{the validity of the}} sig-nature must be confirmed by the signer or a semi-trusted third party, called <b>confirmer.</b> Since the DCS signature is generated by encrypting a standard signature with the designated confirmer’s public key, only the <b>confirmer</b> can disavow invalid signatures. Moreover, the <b>confirmer</b> al-ways can further convert a DCS into an ordinary signature by decrypting the DCS such that it is publicly verifiable. This property is necessary in some cases. However, from the view of the signer, the privacy is leaked if the DCS is converted into an ordinary signature by the <b>confirmer.</b> In this work, we propose a new DCS scheme without the random oracles. Both the signer and <b>confirmer</b> in this new construction can confirm a valid DCS and disavow an invalid signature. Furthermore, the authority of the <b>confirmer</b> is limited. He is designated by the signer to verify the validity of a signature only when the signer is unavailable. However, the <b>confirmer</b> cannot convert a valid DCS into a standard signature. This new property of DCS is more favorable to the signer...|$|E
40|$|In {{contrast}} to ordinary digital signatures, the verification of undeniable signatures and of <b>confirmer</b> signatures requires the cooper-ation of the signer or of a designated <b>confirmer,</b> respectively.

To motivate the necessity of new and provably secure constructions for <b>confirmer</b> signatures, we first describe a flaw in a previous realization by Okamoto. We then present two generic constructions for designing provably secure and efficient <b>confirmer</b> vari-ants of many well-known signature schemes, including the schemes by Schnorr, Fiat and Shamir, ElGamal, and the RSA scheme. The con-structions employ a new tool called <b>confirmer</b> commitment schemes. In this concept the ability to open the committed value is delegated to a designated <b>confirmer.</b> We present an efficient realization based on the Decision-Diffie-Hellman assumption...|$|E

40|$|ACM Spec. Interest Group Secur., Audit, Control (SIGSAC) As an {{important}} cryptographic primitive, designated <b>confirmer</b> signatures {{are introduced to}} control the public verifiability of signatures. That is, only the signer or a semi-trusted party, called designated <b>confirmer,</b> can interactively assist a verifier to check the validity of a designated <b>confirmer</b> signature. The central security property of a designated <b>confirmer</b> signature scheme is called invisibility, which requires that even an adaptive adversary cannot determine the validity of an alleged signature without direct cooperation from either the signer or the designated <b>confirmer.</b> However, in the literature researchers have proposed two other related properties, called impersonation and transcript simulatability, though the relations between them are not clear. In this paper, we first explore the relations among these three invisibility related concepts and conclude that invisibility, impersonation and transcript simulatability forms an increasing stronger order. After that, we turn to study the invisibility of two designated <b>confirmer</b> signature schemes recently presented by Zhang et al. and Wei et al. By demonstrating concrete and effective attacks, we show that both of those two scheme fail to meet invisibility, the central security property of designated <b>confirmer</b> signatures.

40|$|Designated <b>confirmer</b> signatures, {{initially}} {{introduced by}} Chaum in 1994, eliminated the undeniable signature shortcoming {{in which the}} signature can only be verified through {{the cooperation of the}} original signer. This paper proposes several practical constructions to multiple designated <b>confirmer</b> signature schemes. We employ the message- dependent proof of equality of the discrete logarithm and trap-door commitments to construct a new type of multiple <b>confirmer</b> scheme, where specified verifiers designated by the signer would have an advantage in verifying a signature where only one (out of n) <b>confirmer</b> is needed for a confirmation. Other verifiers, who the signer did not designate, must ask all n confirmers to collaboratively confirm this signature. This paper also provides an efficient and practical solution in applying the threshold functions on the designated <b>confirmer</b> signatures...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The undeniable signature, {{introduced}} by Chaum et al. in 1989, provides a nice property that the signer has an additional control over who {{will benefit from}} being convinced by the signature. However, a conspicuous drawback of undeniable signature is that the signer may be unavailable or refuse to cooperate. Chaum in 1994 proposed a designated <b>confirmer</b> signature scheme to protect the recipient’s right. There exists a <b>confirmer,</b> who can always help the recipient prove {{the validity of the}} signature to others. Unfortunately, Chaum’s paper did not consider that a malicious <b>confirmer</b> proves the validity of the signature to any persons as his will or even leaks the sensitive information to the signer’s enemies. This paper proposes a new signature scheme called proxy confirmation signature where the proxy <b>confirmer</b> can only acquire a temporary proxy confirmation capability instead of a perpetual one from the signer. That is, the signer not only can delegate the confirmation capability to the proxy <b>confirmer,</b> but also can revoke the proxy confirmer’s capability for avoiding the abuse. Moreover, our scheme also provides a technique to properly restrict the proxy <b>confirmer</b> to convincing only some specified verifiers that the signature is valid. Key words: cryptography, undeniable signatures, designated <b>confirmer</b> signatures, zero-knowledge proof, proxy confirmation signatures...|$|E

40|$|Since {{designated}} <b>confirmer</b> signature schemes {{were introduced}} by Chaum and formalized by Okamoto, {{a number of}} {{attempts have been made}} to design efficient and secure designated <b>confirmer</b> signature schemes. Yet, there has been a consistent gap in security claims and analysis between all generic theoretical proposals and any concrete implementation proposal one can envision using in practice. In this paper we propose a modification of Okamoto’s definition of security which still captures security against chosen message attack, and yet enables us to design and prove security for a multitude of concrete proposals of designated <b>confirmer</b> signatures without resorting to random oracle assumptions as previously done. We present simple and efficient transformations of a large class of digital signature schemes, including the Cramer-Shoup, Goldwasser-Micali-Rivest and Gennaro-Halevi-Rabin signatures into secure designated <b>confirmer</b> signature schemes. We prove security of the schemes obtained under the same security assumption made by the digital signature scheme transformed and an encryption scheme we use as a tool. ...|$|E

40|$|After the {{introduction}} of designated <b>confirmer</b> signatures (DCS) by Chaum in 1994, considerable researches have been done to build generic schemes from standard digital signatures and construct efficient concrete solutions. In DCS schemes, a signature cannot be verified {{without the help of}} either the signer or a semi-trusted third party, called the designated <b>confirmer.</b> If necessary, the <b>confirmer</b> can further convert a DCS into an ordinary signature that is publicly verifiable. However, there is one limit in most existing schemes: the signer is not given the ability to disavow invalid DCS signatures. Motivated by this observation, in this paper we first propose a new variant of DCS model, called designated <b>confirmer</b> signatures with unified verification, in which both the signer and the designated <b>confirmer</b> can run the same protocols to confirm a valid DCS or disavow an invalid signature. Then, we present the first DCS scheme with unified verification and prove its security in the random oracle (RO) model and under a new computational assumption, called Decisional Co-efficient Linear (D-co-L) assumption, whose intractability in pairing settings is shown to be equivalent to the well-known Decisional Bilinear Diffie-Hellman (DBDH) assumption. The proposed scheme is constructed by encrypting Boneh, Lynn and Shacham’s pairing based short signatures with signed ElGamal encryption. The resulting solution is efficient in both aspects of computation and communication. In addition, we point out that the proposed concept can be generalized by allowing the signer to run different protocols for confirming and disavowing signatures...|$|E
