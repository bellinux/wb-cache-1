5000|$|The person {{preparing}} a check positions the {{check in the}} check writer so its print-heads are centered over the field on the check where {{the amount of the}} check would otherwise be written out in words. Using a series of levers or buttons on the <b>checkwriter's</b> control panel, the operator enters the monetary amount of the check. This amount is then printed onto the check by the operator pulling a lever {{on the side of the}} unit (or by pressing a button on electric units). This brings the print-heads down upon a wide inked (usually multicolor) ribbon through which they print the selected amount on the check, with a prefix and suffix to prevent a fraudster from adding extra digits. Entering $6,762.64, for example, will produce text reading [...] "TheSum6762dol's64cts".|$|R
5000|$|A {{money order}} is {{purchased}} {{for the amount}} desired. In this way it {{is similar to a}} certified cheque. The main difference is that money orders are usually limited in maximum face value to some specified figure (for example, the United States Postal Service limits domestic postal money orders to US $1,000.00 [...] ) while certified cheques are not. Money orders typically consist of two portions: the negotiable cheque for remittance to the payee, and a receipt or stub that the customer retains for his/her records. The amount is printed by machine or <b>checkwriter</b> on both portions, and similar documentation, either as a third hard copy or in electronic form and retained at the issuer and agent locations.|$|E
