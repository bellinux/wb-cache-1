40|$|Although it {{has become}} {{increasingly}} clear that cancers display extensive cellular heterogeneity, the spatial growth dynamics of genetically distinct clones within developing solid tumours remain poorly understood. Here we leverage mosaic analysis with double markers (MADM) to trace subclonal populations retaining or lacking p 53 within oncogenic Kras-initiated lung and pancreatic tumours. In both models, p 53 <b>constrains</b> <b>progression</b> to advanced adenocarcinomas. Comparison of lineage-related p 53 knockout and wild-type clones reveals a minor role of p 53 in suppressing cell expansion in lung adenomas. In contrast, p 53 loss promotes both the initiation and expansion of low-grade pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanINs), likely through differential expression of the p 53 regulator p 19 ARF. Strikingly, lineage-related cells are often dispersed in lung adenomas and PanINs, contrasting with more contiguous growth of advanced subclones. Together, these results support cancer type-specific suppressive roles of p 53 in early tumour progression and offer insights into clonal growth patterns during tumour development.

40|$|Effective {{clinical}} {{management of}} prostate cancer (PCA) has been challenged by significant intratumoural heterogeneity on the genomic and pathological levels and limited understanding of the genetic elements governing disease progression(1). Here, we exploited the experimental merits of the mouse {{to test the hypothesis}} that pathways <b>constraining</b> <b>progression</b> might be activated in indolent Pten-null mouse prostate tumours and that inactivation of such progression barriers in mice would engender a metastasis-prone condition. Comparative transcriptomic and canonical pathway analyses, followed by biochemical confirmation, of normal prostate epithelium versus poorly progressive Pten-null prostate cancers revealed robust activation of the TGF beta/BMP-SMAD 4 signalling axis. The functional relevance of SMAD 4 was further supported by emergence of invasive, metastatic and lethal prostate cancers with 100 % penetrance upon genetic deletion of Smad 4 in the Pten-null mouse prostate. Pathological and molecular analysis as well as transcriptomic knowledge-based pathway profiling of emerging tumours identified cell proliferation and invasion as two cardinal tumour biological features in the metastatic Smad 4 /Pten-null PCA model. Follow-on pathological and functional assessment confirmed cyclin D 1 and SPP 1 as key mediators of these biological processes, which together with PTEN and SMAD 4, form a four-gene signature that is prognostic of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) biochemical recurrence and lethal metastasis in human PCA. This model-informed progression analysis, together with genetic, functional and translational studies, establishes SMAD 4 as a key regulator of PCA progression in mice and humans...|$|R
40|$|Numerous {{studies have}} shown that {{transcranial}} electrical stimulation (tES) can modulate a wide-range of behavioral processes (Coffman et al., 2014; Harty et al., 2014; Sarkar et al., 2014; Pasqualotto, 2016), and ameliorate deficits in several neuropsychiatric disorders (for reviews see Kekic et al., 2016; Lefaucheur et al., 2017). These promising outcomes, in conjunction {{with the fact that the}} approach is safe and inexpensive, have generated enthusiasm for its viability as both an investigative and neuroenhancement tool. However, concerns about the variability and reproducibility of tES effects have <b>constrained</b> <b>progression</b> with its application (Jacobson et al., 2012; Berlim et al., 2013; Horvath et al., 2015). Many factors may contribute to the variability and poor reproducibility of findings. Some of these have already been discussed elsewhere such as insufficient statistical power, methodological differences across studies, experimenter error, inadequate sensitivity and test-retest reliability of the outcome measures (Horvath et al., 2015; Open Science Collaboration, 2015). However, one factor that we believe has received insufficient consideration to date concerns the extent to which the assumptions relating to the targeted brain region are supported (Bikson and Rahman, 2013; Miniussi et al., 2013; Plewnia et al., 2015; Harty et al., 2017). In the present article, we highlight the importance of accounting for states and traits of the neurophysiological milieu when assessing the effects of interventions such as tES on behavior. We present hypothetical scenarios relating to the use of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), but the discussed logic equally applies to other electrical and magnetic stimulation techniques. We additionally propose that mediation and moderation analyses constitute valuable and elegant statistical approaches for assessing the dynamic interaction between these interventions, the brain, and behavior...|$|R
40|$|Anaplastic thyroid {{carcinoma}} (ATC) has {{among the}} worst prognoses of any solid malignancy. The low incidence of the disease has in part precluded systematic clinical trials and tissue collection, {{and there has been}} little progress in developing effective therapies. v-raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B (BRAF) and tumor protein p 53 (TP 53) mutations cooccur in a high proportion of ATCs, particularly those associated with a precursor papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC). To develop an adult-onset model of BRAF-mutant ATC, we generated a thyroid-specific CreER transgenic mouse. We used a Cre-regulated Braf[superscript V 600 E] mouse and a conditional Trp 53 allelic series to demonstrate that p 53 <b>constrains</b> <b>progression</b> from PTC to ATC. Gene expression and immunohistochemical analyses of murine tumors identified the cardinal features of human ATC including loss of differentiation, local invasion, distant metastasis, and rapid lethality. We used small-animal ultrasound imaging to monitor autochthonous tumors and showed that treatment with the selective BRAF inhibitor PLX 4720 improved survival but did not lead to tumor regression or suppress signaling through the MAPK pathway. The combination of PLX 4720 and the mapk/Erk kinase (MEK) inhibitor PD 0325901 more completely suppressed MAPK pathway activation in mouse and human ATC cell lines and improved the structural response and survival of ATC-bearing animals. This model expands the limited repertoire of autochthonous models of clinically aggressive thyroid cancer, and these data suggest that small-molecule MAPK pathway inhibitors hold clinical promise in the treatment of advanced thyroid carcinoma.

40|$|International audienceDCC (Deleted in Colorectal Carcinoma) {{has been}} {{demonstrated}} to <b>constrain</b> tumor <b>progression</b> by inducing apoptosis unless engaged by its ligand netrin- 1. This {{has been shown in}} breast and colorectal cancers; however, this tumor suppressive function in other cancers is not established. Using a transgenic mouse model, we report here that inhibition of DCC-induced apoptosis is associated with lymphomagenesis. In human diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), an imbalance of the netrin- 1 /DCC ratio suggests a loss of DCC-induced apoptosis, either via a decrease in DCC expression in germinal center subtype or by up-regulation of netrin- 1 in activated B-cell (ABC) one. Such imbalance is also observed in mantle cell lymphoma (MCL). Using a netrin- 1 interfering antibody, we demonstrate both in vitro and in vivo that netrin- 1 acts as a survival factor for ABC-DLBCL and MCL tumor cells. Together, these data suggest that interference with the netrin- 1 /DCC interaction could represent a promising therapeutic strategy in netrin- 1 -positive DLBCL and MC...|$|R
40|$|SummaryTo {{determine}} {{the role of}} telomere dysfunction and telomerase reactivation in generating pro-oncogenic genomic events and in carcinoma progression, an inducible telomerase reverse transcriptase (mTert) allele was crossed onto a prostate cancer-prone mouse model null for Pten and p 53 tumor suppressors. Constitutive telomerase deficiency and associated telomere dysfunction <b>constrained</b> cancer <b>progression.</b> In contrast, telomerase reactivation {{in the setting of}} telomere dysfunction alleviated intratumoral DNA-damage signaling and generated aggressive cancers with rearranged genomes and new tumor biological properties (bone metastases). Comparative oncogenomic analysis revealed numerous recurrent amplifications and deletions of relevance to human prostate cancer. Murine tumors show enrichment of the TGF-β/SMAD 4 network, and genetic validation studies confirmed the cooperative roles of Pten, p 53, and Smad 4 deficiencies in prostate cancer progression, including skeletal metastases. Thus, telomerase reactivation in tumor cells experiencing telomere dysfunction enables full malignant progression and provides a mechanism for acquisition of cancer-relevant genomic events endowing new tumor biological capabilities...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn human {{studies and}} mouse models, the {{contributions}} of p 53 and p 16 Ink 4 a/p 19 Arf loss are well established in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Although loss of functional p 53 pathway and loss of Ink 4 a/Arf in human pancreatic acinar cell carcinoma (PACC) and pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor (PanNET) are identified, their direct roles in tumorigenesis of PACC and PanNET remain to be determined. Using transgenic mouse models expressing the viral oncogene polyoma middle T antigen (PyMT), we demonstrate that p 53 loss in pancreatic Pdx 1 + progenitor cells results in aggressive PACC, whereas Ink 4 a/Arf loss results in PanNETs. Concurrent loss of p 53 and Ink 4 a/Arf resembles loss of p 53 alone, suggesting that Ink 4 a/Arf loss has no additive effect to PACC progression. Our results show that specific tumor suppressor genotypes provocatively influence the tumor biological phenotypes in pancreatic progenitor cells. Additionally, in a mouse model of β-cell hyperplasia, we demonstrate that p 53 and Ink 4 a/Arf play cooperative roles in <b>constraining</b> the <b>progression</b> of PanNETs...|$|R
40|$|Advanced {{prostate}} cancer (PCa) is a clinical challenge as no curative therapeutic is available. In this context, {{a better understanding}} of metastasis and resistance mechanisms in PCa is an important issue. As phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) loss is the most common genetic lesion in such cancer, we investigate human data sets for mechanisms that can constrain cancer evolution in this setting. Here we report a liver X receptor (LXR) signature, which tightly correlates with PTEN loss, in PCa. Accordingly, the LXR pathway is deregulated in prostate carcinomas in Pten-null mice. Genetic ablation of LXRs in Pten-null mice, exacerbates PCa invasiveness and metastatic dissemination, which involves mesenchymal transition and accumulation of matrix metalloproteinases. Mechanistically, PTEN deletion governed LXR transcriptional activity through deregulation of cholesterol de novo synthesis, resulting in accumulation of endogenous LXR ligands. Our study therefore reveals a functional circuit linking PTEN and LXR, and highlights LXRs as metabolic gatekeepers that are able to <b>constrain</b> PCa <b>progression.</b> Treatment of {{prostate cancer}}, especially in its advanced stage, is still challenging; therefore, strategies to prevent metastatic dissemination are of great interest. Here the authors reveal a crucial role for liver X receptors in suppressing prostate carcinogenesis and metastatic progression in PTEN-null tumor...|$|R
40|$|The Hedgehog {{signaling}} is a determinant pathway for tumor progression. However, while {{inhibition of}} the Hedgehog canonical pathway—Patched–Smoothened–Gli—has proved efficient in human tumors with activating mutations in this pathway, recent clinical data {{have failed to}} show any benefit in other cancers, even though Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) expression is detected in these cancers. Cell-adhesion molecule-related/down-regulated by Oncogenes (CDON), a positive regulator of skeletal muscle development, was recently identified as a receptor for SHH. We show here that CDON behaves as a SHH dependence receptor: it actively triggers apoptosis {{in the absence of}} SHH. The pro-apoptotic activity of unbound CDON requires a proteolytic cleavage in its intracellular domain, allowing the recruitment and activation of caspase- 9. We show that by inducing apoptosis in settings of SHH limitation, CDON expression <b>constrains</b> tumor <b>progression,</b> and as such, decreased CDON expression observed in a large fraction of human colorectal cancer is associated in mice with intestinal tumor progression. Reciprocally, we propose that the SHH expression, detected in human cancers and previously considered as a mechanism for activation of the canonical pathway in an autocrine or paracrine manner, actually provides a selective tumor growth advantage by blocking CDON-induced apoptosis. In support of this notion, we present the preclinical demonstration that interference with the SHH–CDON interaction triggers a CDON-dependent apoptosis in vitr...|$|R

To identify {{the individual and}} social factors {{that are associated with}} positive health-seeking behaviors and regular {{maintenance of}} chronic diseases, we have conducted a follow up study in 2015 on diabetic and hypertensive patients in Hubei Province. We used binary logistic regression models to determine specific factors associated with diabetic and hypertensive patients that sought healthcare services for their conditions in accordance with current Chinese Centers for Disease Prevention and Control (CDC) guidelines. Our findings show that 42. 16 % of 510 people living with chronic conditions (PLCDs) sought health services in line with existing guidelines. Findings also show a higher probability (8. 418 times) for PLCDs seeking healthcare services at higher-tiered hospitals (secondary and tertiary hospitals) than for PLCDs seeking care at primary hospitals (odds ratio (OR) = 8. 418, 95 % confidence interval (CI) = 4. 82, 14. 27, p < 0. 001). These analyses underscore the importance of having patient advocates who can provide support, where necessary, and encourage positive health-seeking behavior. The study also shows a negative impact on regular maintenance for PLCDs in households with high financial constraints. In contrast, the study shows positive impacts for increased household income, age, and residency in rural locations. In sum, this study underscores the importance of primary hospitals as key points of care and critical players in care coordination for PLCDs. The study provides more evidence for Chinese policymakers seeking to contain costs and improve population health. The findings also underscore the need for community-based interventions, specifically interventions that link local primary hospitals, friends/family members, and PLCDs...|$|R
40|$|Rapamycin is an {{effective}} inhibitor of human renal cancer metastasis. BackgroundHuman renal cell cancer (RCC) is common and is 10 to 100 times more frequent in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and candidates for renal transplantation. Treatment of metastatic RCC is largely ineffective and is further undermined by immunosuppressive therapy in transplant recipients. A treatment regimen that prevents transplant rejection while <b>constraining</b> RCC <b>progression</b> would be of high value. MethodsWe developed a human RCC pulmonary metastasis model using human RCC 786 -O as the tumor challenge and the severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) beige mouse as the host. We explored the effect of rapamycin, cyclosporine, or rapamycin plus cyclosporine {{on the development of}} pulmonary metastases and survival. The effects of the drugs on tumor cell growth, apoptosis, and expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF-A) and transforming growth factor β 1 (TGF-β 1) were also investigated. ResultsRapamycin reduced, whereas cyclosporine increased, the number of pulmonary metastases. Rapamycin was effective in cyclosporine-treated mice, and rapamycin or rapamycin plus cyclosporine prolonged survival. Rapamycin growth arrested RCC 786 -O at the G 1 phase and reduced VEGF-A expression. Immunostaining of lung tissues for von Willebrand factor was minimal and circulating levels of VEGF-A and TGF-β 1 were lower in the rapamycin-treated mice compared to untreated or cyclosporine-treated mice. ConclusionOur findings support the idea that rapamycin may be of value for patients with RCC and that its antitumor efficacy is realized by cell cycle arrest and targeted reduction of VEGF-A and TGF-β 1. A regimen of rapamycin and cyclosporine, demonstrated to be effective in reducing acute rejection of renal allografts, may prevent RCC progression as wel, and has the potential to prevent mortality due to RCC in patients with ESRD who have received renal allografts...|$|R

In mouse models, KrasG 12 D initiates formation of premalignant pancreatic ductal lesions, {{and loss of}} either Ink 4 a/Arf (p 16 Ink 4 a/p 19 Arf) or p 53 enables their malignant progression. As recent mouse modeling studies have suggested a less prominent role for p 16 Ink 4 a in <b>constraining</b> malignant <b>progression,</b> we sought to assess the pathological and genomic impact of inactivation of p 16 Ink 4 a, p 19 Arf, and/or p 53 in the KrasG 12 D model. Rapidly progressive PDAC was observed {{in the setting of}} homozygous deletion of either p 53 or p 16 Ink 4 a, the latter with intact germ-line p 53 and p 19 Arf sequences. Additionally, KrasG 12 D in the context of heterozygosity either for p 53 plus p 16 Ink 4 a or for p 16 Ink 4 a/p 19 Arf produced PDAC with longer latency and greater propensity for distant metastases relative to mice with homozygous deletion of p 53 or p 16 Ink 4 a/p 19 Arf. Tumors from the double-heterozygous cohorts showed frequent p 16 Ink 4 a inactivation and loss of either p 53 or p 19 Arf. Different genotypes were associated with specific histopathologic characteristics, most notably a trend toward less differentiated features in the homozygous p 16 Ink 4 a/p 19 Arf mutant model. High-resolution genomic analysis revealed that the tumor suppressor genotype influenced the specific genomic patterns of these tumors and showed overlap in regional chromosomal alterations between murine and human PDAC. Collectively, our results establish that disruptions of p 16 Ink 4 a and the p 19 ARF-p 53 circuit play critical and cooperative roles in PDAC progression, with specific tumor suppressor genotypes provocatively influencing the tumor biological phenotypes and genomic profiles of the resultant tumors...|$|R

The rupture of the April 25, 2015 (Mw 7. 8), earthquake was east-directed, with no part relayed to the MFT. The aftershock distribution, coseismic elevation change of similar to 1 m inferred from the InSAR image, and the spatial correspondence of the subtle surface deformations with PT 2, a previously mapped out-of-sequence thrust, lead us to explore the role of structural heterogeneities in <b>constraining</b> the rupture <b>progression.</b> We used teleseismic moment inversion of P- and SH-waves, and Coulomb static stress changes to map the slip distribution, and growth of aftershock area, to understand their relation to the thrust systems. Most of the aftershocks were sourced outside the stress shadows (slip > 1. 65 m) of the April 25 earthquake. The May 12 (Mw 7. 3) earthquake that sourced on a contiguous patch coincides with regions of increased stress change and therefore is the first known post-instrumentation example of a late, distant, and large triggered aftershock associated with any large earthquake in the Nepal Himalaya. The present study relates the slip, aftershock productivity, and triggering of unbroken stress barriers, to potential out-of-sequence thrusts, and suggests the role of stress transfer in generating large/great earthquakes...|$|R
40|$|Hepatocellular {{carcinoma}} is {{a highly}} deadly malignancy, accounting for approximately 800, 000 deaths worldwide every year. Mutation of the p 53 tumor suppressor gene is a common genetic change in HCC, present in 30 % of cases. p 53 R 175 H (corresponding to p 53 R 172 H in mice) is a hotspot for mutation that demonstrates "prometastatic" gain-of-function in other cancer models. Since the frequency of p 53 mutation increases with tumor grade in HCC, we hypothesized that p 53 R 172 H is a gain-of-function mutation in HCC that contributes to a decrease in tumor-free survival {{and an increase in}} metastasis. In an HCC mouse model, we found that p 53 R 172 H/flox mice do not have decreased survival, increased tumor incidence, or increased metastasis, relative to p 53 flox/flox littermates. Analysis of cell lines derived from both genotypes indicated that there are no differences in anchorage-independent growth and cell migration. However, shRNA-mediated knockdown of mutant p 53 in p 53 R 172 H-expressing HCC cell lines resulted in decreased cell migration and anchorage-independent growth. Thus, although p 53 mutant-expressing cells and tumors do not have enhanced properties relative to their p 53 null counterparts, p 53 R 172 H-expressing HCC cells depend on this mutant for their transformation. p 53 mutants have been previously shown to bind and inhibit the p 53 family proteins p 63 and p 73. Interestingly, we find that the levels of p 63 and p 73 target genes are similar in p 53 mutant and p 53 null HCC cells. These data suggest that pathways regulated by these p 53 family members are similarly impacted by p 53 R 172 H in mutant expressing cells, and by alternate mechanisms in p 53 null cells, resulting in equivalent phenotypes. Consistent with this, we find that p 53 null HCC cell lines display lower levels of the TA isoforms of p 63 and p 73 and higher levels of ΔNp 63. Taken together these data point to the importance of p 63 and p 73 in <b>constraining</b> HCC <b>progression...</b>|$|R

Research purpose: This research sought to test the theory that predicted differences between individuals by designation cohort membership (Mr/Ms, doctoral and professorial designation) {{in order to make}} recommendations for how academic staff could better facilitate their career development. Motivation for the study: This research attempted to identify certain ‘crisis milestones’ that reflect potential role conflicts that may <b>constrain</b> academic career <b>progression.</b> Research design, approach and method: Academic staff of a large South African university (with over 30 000 students) provided the sampling frame for an empirical study. Using logistic regression, three career markers that reflect different career cohorts – Mr/Ms designation, doctoral designation and professorial designation – were each regressed on a range of biographical and contextual factors derived from the literature and a comparative analysis was performed. Main findings: Findings suggest that these cohorts differ significantly according to: satisfaction with teaching; satisfaction with administration; research self-efficacy; and dependent children.  ‘Crisis milestones’, potentially related to role conflicts, might need to be resolved before career progression to doctoral and professorial designations can occur. Practical/Managerial implications: Knowledge of these ‘crisis milestones’ can be used to help academics to manage role conflicts and issues. This might remove unnecessary constraints to academic career progression. Contribution/Value add: This study provides new insights into certain ‘crisis milestones’, or role conflicts or issues, that may need to be resolved or balanced before the career progression of academics can typically occur. </span...|$|R

In analysing the narratives of school leaders it sheds light on the agentic and contextual factors which have limited or facilitated a successful transition to school leadership and which sustain success. The headteachers’ professional lives are explored through the lenses of Critical Race Theory and interpretivism. In doing so, it illuminates the journey towards and the realities of a group whose views are currently unrepresented in research on school leadership or that of the experiences of male BME teachers in England. The findings revealed that participants experience both limiting and facilitating structures as they negotiated their roles into headship and as headteachers. Limiting structures are those which <b>constrain</b> or hinder <b>progression</b> into leadership whilst facilitating structures enabled participants to navigate and negotiate gendered racism, make progress in their careers and achieve success in their respective roles.

40|$|Advanced age is {{the main}} risk factor for most chronic {{diseases}} and functional deficits in humans, but the fundamental mechanisms that drive ageing remain largely unknown, impeding the development of interventions that might delay or prevent age-related disorders and maximize healthy lifespan. Cellular senescence, which halts the proliferation of damaged or dysfunctional cells, is an important mechanism to <b>constrain</b> the malignant <b>progression</b> of tumour cells(1, 2). Senescent cells accumulate in various tissues and organs with ageing(3) and have been hypothesized to disrupt tissue structure and function because of the components they secrete(4, 5). However, whether senescent cells are causally implicated in age-related dysfunction and whether their removal is beneficial has remained unknown. To address these fundamental questions, we made use of a biomarker for senescence, p 16 (Ink 4 a), to design a novel transgene, INK-ATTAC, for inducible elimination of p 16 (Ink 4 a) -positive senescent cells upon administration of a drug. Here we show that in the BubR 1 progeroid mouse background, INK-ATTAC removes p 16 (Ink 4 a) -positive senescent cells upon drug treatment. In tissues-such as adipose tissue, skeletal muscle and eye-in which p 16 (Ink 4 a) contributes to the acquisition of age-related pathologies, life-long removal of p 16 (Ink 4 a) -expressing cells delayed onset of these phenotypes. Furthermore, late-life clearance attenuated progression of already established age-related disorders. These data indicate that cellular senescence is causally implicated in generating age-related phenotypes and that removal of senescent cells can prevent or delay tissue dysfunction and extend healthspan...|$|R
40|$|AbstractObservations of {{the marine}} {{carbonate}} system were made in 2010 in the northeastern Chukchi Sea to <b>constrain</b> the seasonal <b>progression</b> of carbonate mineral saturation states (Ω) throughout the water column and determine the air–sea flux of carbon dioxide (CO 2). As sea ice retreats from the Chukchi Shelf, primary production consumes dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) in the euphotic zone causing pH and carbonate mineral saturation states to increase. Throughout the summer and early autumn months of 2010, saturation states for calcite and aragonite ranged from 2. 5 to 4. 0 and 1. 5 to 2. 5, respectively, well about the saturation horizon of 1. 0. Much of the organic matter produced during the bloom was vertically exported from the relatively small study area leading to an uptake of CO 2 from the atmosphere of at least 340, 000 kg-C. The exported organic matter settled near the bottom and was remineralized back into DIC, causing concentrations to increase sharply, particularly in autumn months, driving down pH to as low as 7. 75 and suppressing the concentrations of important carbonate minerals {{to the point that}} aragonite became undersaturated. The data showed a definitive seasonal progression of this process with aragonite becoming partially undersaturated along the bottom in September, and broadly undersaturated in October. While carbonate saturation states would naturally be suppressed by the high rates of export production and the accumulation of DIC near the bottom, the penetration of anthropogenic CO 2 into the water column (ocean acidification) has caused these observed undersaturations, which will likely expand as CO 2 levels in the atmosphere continue to rise in the coming decades...|$|R
40|$|Sickle cell disease (SCD) {{is caused}} by an {{inherited}} mutation in hemoglobin that leads to sickle hemoglobin (HbS) polymerization and premature HbS denaturation. Previous publications have shown that HbS denaturation is followed by binding of denatured HbS (a. k. a. hemichromes) to band 3, the consequent clustering of band 3 in {{the plane of the}} erythrocyte membrane that in turn promotes binding of autologous antibodies to the clustered band 3, and removal of the antibody-coated erythrocytes from circulation. Although each step of the above process has been individually demonstrated, the fraction of band 3 that is altered by association with denatured HbS has never been determined. For this purpose, we evaluated the lateral diffusion of band 3 in normal cells, reversibly sickled cells (RSC), irreversibly sickled cells (ISC), and hemoglobin SC erythrocytes (HbSC) in order to estimate the fraction of band 3 that was diffusing more slowly due to hemichrome-induced clustering. We labeled fewer than ten band 3 molecules per intact erythrocyte with a quantum dot to avoid perturbing membrane structure and we then monitored band 3 lateral diffusion by single particle tracking. We report here that the size of the slowly diffusing population of band 3 increases in the sequence: normal cells<HbSC<RSC<ISC. We also demonstrate that the size of the compartment in which band 3 is free to diffuse decreases roughly in the same order, with band 3 diffusing in two compartments of sizes 35 and 71 nm in normal cells, but only a single compartment in HbSC cells (58 nm), RSC (45 nm) and ISC (36 nm). These data suggest that the mobility of band 3 is increasingly <b>constrained</b> during SCD <b>progression,</b> suggesting a global impact of the mutated hemoglobin on erythrocyte membrane properties...|$|R
