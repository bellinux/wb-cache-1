40|$|The {{social or}} {{economic}} <b>discount</b> <b>rate</b> is the threshold rate {{used to calculate}} the net present value of an investment project, a program, or a regulatory intervention to see whether the proposed expenditures are economically worthwhile to undertake. The size of the economic <b>rate</b> of <b>discount</b> has been a policy issue in Canada for many years.

40|$|It {{has long}} been known that the {{economic}} assessment of large projects is sensitive to assumptions about discounting future costs and benefits. Projects that require high upfront investments and take years to begin producing economic benefits can be difficult to justify with the <b>discount</b> <b>rates</b> typically used for project appraisal. While most economists argue that social <b>discount</b> <b>rates</b> should be below 4 %, many international development banks and government planning agencies responsible for project appraisal can be found using rates of 7 - 12 % or more. These agencies justify choosing higher <b>discount</b> <b>rates</b> to account for the opportunity cost of capital. Meanwhile, a new and robust debate has begun in economics <b>over</b> whether social <b>discount</b> <b>rates</b> of even 3 - 4 % are too high in the context of climate change. This paper reviews the recent discounting controversy and examines its implications for the appraisal of an illustrative hydropower project in Ethiopia. The analysis uses an integrated hydro-economic model that accounts for how the dam’s transboundary impacts vary with climate change. The real value of the dam is found to be highly sensitive to assumptions about future economic growth. The argument for investment is weakest under conditions of robust global economic growth, particularly if these coincide with unfavourable hydrological or development factors related to the project. If however long-term growth is reduced, the value of the dam tends to increase. There may also be distributional or local arguments favouring investment, if growth in the investment region lags behind that {{of the rest of the}} globe. In such circumstances, a large dam can be seen as a form of insurance that protects future vulnerable generations against the possibility of macroeconomic instability or climate shocks...|$|R

Discounted cash flow model is widely used for asset valuation under the International Financial Reporting Standards (in abbreviation, IFRS). The <b>discount</b> <b>rate</b> applied in valuation models normally is the best rate of return that investors would earn alternative investments. With emergence of ecological economics as a separate branch of economics, the concept of ecological (or in other words, environmental <b>discount</b> <b>rate)</b> has been elaborated. Muller (2013) in his paper ‘The Discounting Confusion: an Ecological Economics Perspective’, argues that traditional discounting can undermine long-term sustainability of the economy. In his work, Frank G. Muller considered adjusting the traditional <b>discount</b> <b>rate</b> in order to arrive at an environmental <b>discount</b> <b>rate,</b> which would help to ensure the sustainability of the economy.

40|$|This report {{highlights}} {{one important}} variable in this determination {{that is often}} left unexamined in current climate change models [...] -uncertainty in future interest rates. Underlying existing climate change models is {{a specific set of}} assumptions regarding emissions levels, economic growth and flexibility, technological innovation, climate change policies, and the magnitude of climate change damages. Though this set of assumptions varies from model to model, each includes a <b>discount</b> <b>rate,</b> which is used to compare costs and benefits <b>over</b> time. The <b>discount</b> <b>rate</b> tells us how high future benefits need to be to justify spending a dollar today. While there is considerable debate regarding the appropriate <b>discount</b> <b>rate</b> to apply to any cost-benefit analysis conducted across generations, most climate models choose one rate (2 - 7 percent is a common range) and hold it constant over the time horizon of the model. This study questions that conventional approach. Rather than assuming that interest rates remain fixed over hundreds of years, authors William Pizer and Richard Newell argue that future rates are uncertain. Using an integrated assessment model of climate change, they demonstrate that acknowledging uncertainty about future rates will lead to a higher valuation of future benefits [...] -regardless of the initial rate one chooses. This is a significant finding, because it reveals that including the effect of interest rate uncertainty could raise valuations by as much as 95 percent relative to conventional discounting at a constant rate. In other words, changing the approach to discounting in this manner results in significantly higher projected benefits of addressing climate change.

40|$|Public {{pension funding}} has {{recently}} become a front-burner policy {{issue in the}} wake of the financial crisis and given the pending retirement of large numbers of baby boomers. This paper examines the current funding of state and local pensions using a sample of 126 plans, estimating an aggregate funded ratio in 2009 of 78 percent. Projections for 2010 - 2013 suggest that some continued deterioration is likely. Funded status can vary significantly among plans, so the paper explores the influence of four types of factors: funding discipline, plan governance, plan characteristics, and the fiscal situation of the state. Judging the adequacy of funding requires more than just a snapshot of assets and liabilities, so the paper examines how well plans are meeting their Annual Required Contribution and what factors influence whether they make them. The paper also addresses the controversy <b>over</b> what <b>discount</b> <b>rate</b> to use for valuing liabilities, concluding that using a riskless rate of return could help improve funding discipline but would need to be implemented in a manageable way. Finally, the paper assesses whether plans face a near-term liquidity crisis and finds that most have assets on hand to cover benefits over the next 15 - 20 years. The bottom line is that, like private investors, public plans have been hit hard by the financial crisis and their full recovery is dependent on the rebound of the economy and the stock market. ...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} {{implement}} water management in a sustainable way, the related decision-making processes {{have to take}} the ecological and socio-economic consequences into account. In The Netherlands, policy makers struggle with the question of how they can deal with flood risks. This paper presents some results of a research project sponsored by the Dutch Ministry of Water management in order to develop a risk assessment approach that assists decision-makers in dealing with flood risks. It shows that dealing with risk in decision-making related to water management manifests itself in different ways. One aspect is the incorporation of risk in the process of valuation of socio-economic effects. Another aspect is the incorporation of the valued socio-economic effects into the decision-making process. The paper shows that different attitudes towards risk determine to a large extent how the valued effects are assessed. This element has been widely discussed in the literature. The results are innovative in that they also show that risk attitudes and the understanding of the risk concept interfere with the outcome of the decision-making process in the field of water management. The paper provides an approach to how the concept of risk can be operationalized in different ways by decision-makers in dealing with flood risks. The approach is applied in two case studies. The results show that different institutional contexts impose different ways of dealing with risks which may significantly change <b>over</b> time (<b>discount</b> <b>rates,</b> risk attitudes, relevance of ecological effects, etc.) ...|$|R

40|$|Purpose – Venture capitalists {{typically}} use <b>discount</b> <b>rates</b> in {{the range}} of 30 - 70 percent. During the startup stage of venture-capital financing, <b>discount</b> <b>rates</b> between 50 and 70 percent are common. The <b>discount</b> <b>rate</b> decreases from the first through fourth stage: from 60 to 30 percent. These rates of return are high compared to historical returns on common stocks or small stocks (12. 1 and 17. 8 percent, respectively). Such high <b>discount</b> <b>rates</b> cannot also be explained in the context of any existing asset pricing theory; that is, any reasonable risk-adjusted <b>discount</b> <b>rates</b> are not consistent with <b>discount</b> <b>rates</b> in the order of 30 - 60 percent. The paper provides a rational economic explanation why venture capitalists (VC) use such high <b>discount</b> <b>rates.</b> The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach – Let the <b>discount</b> <b>rate</b> of a venture project be 15 percent; this <b>discount</b> <b>rate</b> depends on the systematic risk of the cash flows from the project given that the project is successful. Using the procedure, a VC who estimates the probability of eventual success of the project between 60 and 40 percent will impose a <b>discount</b> <b>rate</b> between 42 and 74 percent. These <b>discount</b> <b>rates</b> are quite similar to the <b>discount</b> <b>rates</b> charged by VC in their startup and first stages. Findings – The high rates of return charged by VC reflect the fact that not all their projects succeed in that they have no net cash-inflows.

40|$|Background: In {{cost-effectiveness}} analysis, <b>discount</b> <b>rates</b> {{are used}} in calculating the value of future costs and benefits. However, standard <b>discount</b> <b>rates</b> may not accurately describe the decision-making of patients with ulcerative colitis (UC). These patients often choose the long-term risks of immunosuppressive therapy over the short-term risks of colectomy, demonstrating very high <b>discount</b> <b>rates</b> for future health. In this study we aimed to measure the <b>discount</b> <b>rate</b> in UC patients and identify variables associated with the <b>discount</b> <b>rate.</b> Methods: We surveyed patients with UC and patients who were postcolectomy for UC to measure their valuations of UC and colectomy health states. We used Standard Gamble (SG) and Time-Trade-Off (TTO) methods to assess current and future health state valuations and calculated the <b>discount</b> <b>rate.</b> Results: Participants included 150 subjects with UC and 150 subjects who were postcolectomy for UC. Adjusted <b>discount</b> <b>rates</b> varied widely (0 %– 100 %), with an overall median rate of 55. 0 % (interquartile range [IQR] 20. 6 – 100), which {{was significantly higher than}} the standard rate of 5 %.

Those in very good health, very poor health and those who expressed great certainty or uncertainty about how long they would live, had high <b>discount</b> <b>rates.</b> In other words, health and survival probability had a u-shaped relationship with the subjective <b>discount</b> <b>rate</b> (Chao et al. 2009).|$|R
40|$|We employ {{threshold}} cointegration methodology {{to model}} the policy problem solved by the Federal Reserve System in their manipulation of the <b>discount</b> <b>rate</b> under a reserves target operating procedure utilized since October 1979. The infrequent and discrete adjustments that characterize movements in the <b>discount</b> <b>rate</b> instrument vis-a- vis the Federal Funds rate do not lend themselves to a linear cointegration framework. The inherently nonlinear relationship arising from the Fed's self-imposed constraints on discontinuously changing the <b>discount</b> <b>rate</b> is satisfactorily modelled as an instance of threshold cointegration between the <b>discount</b> <b>rate</b> and the Federal Funds <b>rate.</b> Monetary policy, <b>discount</b> <b>rate,</b> Fed, threshold cointegration...|$|R
