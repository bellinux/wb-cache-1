5|$|Modi's {{first year}} as prime {{minister}} saw significant <b>centralisation</b> of power relative to previous administrations. Modi's efforts at <b>centralisation</b> {{have been linked to}} {{an increase in the number}} of senior administration officials resigning their positions. Although the government has a majority of seats in the Lok Sabha, it does not have one in the Rajya Sabha, which led to its policies frequently being stymied there. Thus, Modi resorted to passing a number of ordinances to enact his policies, leading to further <b>centralisation</b> of power. The government also passed a bill increasing the control that it had over the appointment of judges, and reducing that of the judiciary.|$|E
5|$|The {{issues of}} federalism, {{ethnicity}} {{in politics and}} state <b>centralisation</b> were not resolved by the crisis and partly contributed {{to a decline in}} support for the concept of the state among Congolese people. Mobutu was strongly in favour of <b>centralisation</b> and one of his first acts, in 1965, were to reunify provinces and abolish much of their independent legislative capacity. Subsequent loss of faith in central government {{is one of the reasons}} that the Congo has been labeled as a failed state, and has contributed violence by factions advocating ethnic and localised federalism.|$|E
5|$|The late Republic saw an {{increase}} in the <b>centralisation</b> of power into the hands of provincial governors, the use of military power to enforce political changes (e.g. the Sullan dictatorship), and the use of violence, combined with exploitation of the suitably bribed or intimidated 'sovereign' assemblies, to grant supreme authority to victorious commanders. The increasing legitimisation of violence and <b>centralisation</b> of authority into fewer and fewer men would, with the collapse of trust in the Republic's institutions, put it on a path to civil war and its transformation into the autocratic Roman Empire.|$|E
5|$|Because {{there are}} no other large cities in the Republic of Macedonia, and because of {{political}} and economical <b>centralisation,</b> a large number of Macedonians living outside of Skopje work in the capital city. The dynamism of the city also encourages rural exodus, not only from Macedonia, but also from Kosovo, Albania and Southern Serbia.|$|E

Mobutu was strongly in favour of <b>centralisation</b> and one of his first acts, in 1965, were to reunify provinces and abolish much of their independent legislative capacity. Subsequent loss of faith in central government {{is one of the reasons}} that the Congo has been labeled as a failed state, and has contributed violence by factions advocating ethnic and localised federalism. Local insurgencies continued in the eastern Congo into the 1980s left a legacy of instability along the Congo's eastern borders.|$|E
5|$|The country's current {{political}} structure {{dates to the}} adoption of a democratic constitution in 1991. Bulgaria is a unitary parliamentary republic {{with a high degree of}} political, administrative, and economic <b>centralisation.</b> It is a member of the European Union, NATO, and the Council of Europe; a founding state of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE); and has taken a seat at the UN Security Council three times.|$|E
5|$|After a {{brief period}} of <b>centralisation</b> and {{collapse}} of the Qin dynasty, the area of Hong Kong was consolidated under the Kingdom of Nanyue, founded by general Zhao Tuo in 204 BC. When Nanyue lost the Han-Nanyue War in 111 BC, Hong Kong came under the Jiaozhi commandery of the Han dynasty. Archaeological evidence indicates an increase of population and flourish of salt production. The Lei Cheng Uk Han Tomb on the Kowloon Peninsula {{is believed to have been}} built as a burial site during the Han dynasty.|$|E
5|$|As {{part of a}} {{drive to}} reduce media <b>centralisation</b> in London, the BBC and ITV have moved much of their program {{production}} to MediaCityUK in Salford. Of the four national evening soap operas, three are set and filmed in Northern England (Coronation Street in Manchester, Emmerdale in the Yorkshire Dales and Hollyoaks in Chester) and these {{are important to the}} local TV industry – the commitment to Emmerdale saved ITV Yorkshire's Leeds Studios from closure. The region also has a reputation for drama serials and has produced some the most successful and acclaimed series of recent decades, including Boys from the Blackstuff, Our Friends in the North, Clocking Off, Shameless and Last Tango in Halifax.|$|E
5|$|Within {{twenty years}} of the Norman conquest, the former Anglo-Saxon elite were {{replaced}} by {{a new class of}} Norman nobility, with around 8,000 Normans and French settling in England. The new earls (successors to the ealdermen), sheriffs and church seniors were all drawn from their ranks. In many areas of society there was continuity, as the Normans adopted many of the Anglo-Saxon governmental institutions, including the tax system, mints and the <b>centralisation</b> of law-making and some judicial matters; initially sheriffs and the hundred courts continued to function as before. The existing tax liabilities were captured in Domesday Book, produced in 1086.|$|E
5|$|English, Māori and New Zealand Sign Language are the {{official}} languages, with English predominant. New Zealand English is mostly non-rhotic and sounds similar to Australian English, {{with a common}} exception being the <b>centralisation</b> of the short i. The Māori language has undergone a process of revitalisation and is spoken by 3.7percent of the population. New Zealand has an adult literacy rate of 99percent and {{over half of the}} population aged 15 to 29 hold a tertiary qualification. In the adult population 14.2 percent have a bachelor's degree or higher, 30.4 percent have some form of secondary qualification as their highest qualification and 22.4 percent have no formal qualification. As of the 2013 census, just under half the population identify as Christians, with Hinduism and Buddhism being the most significant minority religions. New Zealand has no state religion and just over 40percent of the population does not have a religion.|$|E
5|$|From {{the reign}} of King James I, the {{beginnings}} of a legal profession began to develop and the administration of criminal and civil justice was centralised. The growing activity of the parliament and the <b>centralisation</b> of administration in Scotland called for the better dissemination of Acts of the parliament to the courts and other enforcers of the law. Throughout the late fifteenth century, unsuccessful attempts were made to form commissions of experts to codify, update or define Scots law. The legal uncertainty that this situation created prompted increased reliance on the common law found in Canon law, {{and there are a number}} of examples of statutes from this period that clearly drew from Roman law. The general practice during this period, as evidenced from records of cases, seems to have been to defer to specific Scottish laws on a matter when available and to fill in any gaps with provisions from the common law embodied in Civil and Canon law, which had the advantage of being written.|$|E
5|$|The Berlin Conference of 1884 {{assigned}} the territory to Germany, with imprecise boundaries. When Gustav Adolf von Götzen explored the country ten years later, {{he discovered that}} the Kingdom of Rwanda included a fertile region east of Lake Kivu. Germany wanted this region, which was also claimed by Leopold II {{as part of his}} own Congo Free State (annexed by Belgium to form the Belgian Congo in 1908). To justify its claim, Germany began a policy of ruling through the Rwandan monarchy and supporting Tutsi chiefs; this system allowed colonisation with few European troops. Yuhi V Musinga, who emerged as king after a succession crisis following {{the death of his father}} Rwabugiri and a struggle with Belgian troops, welcomed the Germans and used them to consolidate his power. The territory became the western border of German East Africa. German rule allowed Rwabugiri's <b>centralisation</b> policy to continue, and the rift between Tutsi and Hutu deepened.|$|E
5|$|When the {{national}} service scheme was ended following {{the election of}} the Whitlam Government in late 1972, the 3rd Division lost a large number of personnel. At this time, the division's artillery assets included two artillery field regiments, a medium regiment, and a divisional locating battery, and although on paper the division was a large, combined arms formation, in reality many of its units were hollow and inadequately equipped, and in the decades following this the division, and indeed the CMF in general, underwent a period of uncertainty as the government attempted to solve the issues that the organisation faced, the most pressing of which was the question of its role and strategic relevance, as well as those concerning conditions of service, <b>centralisation</b> of training and access to equipment.|$|E
5|$|Combined {{with the}} Domesday Survey, the Pipe rolls {{contributed to the}} <b>centralisation</b> of {{financial}} records by the Norman kings (reigned 1066–1154) of England that was ahead of contemporary Western European monarchies; the French, for instance, {{did not have an}} equivalent system of accounting until the 1190s. The exact form of the records, kept in a roll instead of a book, was also unique to England, although why England kept some of its administrative records in this form is unclear. A set of Norman rolls, drafted differently, are extant in a few years for the reigns of Kings Henry II (reigned 1154–1189) and Richard I (reigned 1189–1199), who also ruled the Duchy of Normandy in France. It is believed that the Norman rolls were started {{about the same time as}} the English, but due to lack of survival of the earlier Norman rolls, it is unclear exactly when they did start. An Irish Exchequer produced Irish Pipe rolls, and much like the English Pipe rolls, the earliest surviving Irish Pipe roll, that of 1212, does not appear to be the first produced.|$|E
5|$|Nevertheless, due {{to further}} cuts in defence {{spending}} and an eagerness {{of the government}} to implement those recommendations that could assist in achieving this goal, units that were unable to meet attendance requirements were disbanded or amalgamated with others, thus further diffusing the community links units had established in their local areas and thus further impacting upon recruitment and retention. Further, {{the decision was made to}} abolish the old CMF divisions, as the role of the Army Reserve would no longer be to act as a skeleton force that would be filled out upon mobilisation, but rather a force that could provide individual sub-units of capability should the need arise to augment the Regular Army. <b>Centralisation</b> of training was also a result of the Millar Report; beforehand, recruit training had been an ad hoc process managed mainly by the units themselves. Other issues such as pay and conditions of service, protection of civilian employment and recruitment and retention were touched upon but remained largely unaddressed until more recently.|$|E
5|$|On 23 March 1958, Wells was {{appointed}} the first Chairman, Chiefs of Staff Committee (COSC); the professional {{head of the}} Australian Military. The position had previously existed as an extension to {{the responsibilities of the}} senior service chief—either the Chief of Naval Staff, Chief of the General Staff or Chief of the Air Staff—but Wells was the first to occupy the position as a separate post. The chairmanship of COSC was created as part of the Australian government's response to a review of the Defence group of departments conducted by Lieutenant General Sir Leslie Morshead in 1957, which recommended greater <b>centralisation</b> of the armed forces. Although the Chairman was the Government's principal military advisor and reported directly to the Minister for Defence, Wells was not promoted and remained at the same rank as the heads of the Navy, Army and Air Force. He was also hampered by being given only a small staff. The role of the Chairman, COSC was not strengthened until 1965, when Air Marshal Sir Frederick Scherger—who had been appointed to the position in 1961—was promoted to air chief marshal so that he out-ranked the service heads. Wells served in this capacity until his retirement from the Australian military on 22 March 1959.|$|E
5|$|The {{operation}} of local prisons in locations such as castles had been criticised, since John Howard's {{work in the}} 1770s, and pressure for reform continued {{to grow in the}} 1850s and 1860s. Reform of the legislation surrounding bankruptcy and debt in 1869 largely removed the threat of imprisonment for unpaid debts, and in the process eliminated the purpose of the debtor's prisons in castles such as St Briavels. Efforts were made to regularise conditions in local prisons but without much success, and these failures led to prison reform in 1877 which nationalised British prisons, including prisons at castles like York. Compensation was paid to the former owners, although in cases such as York where the facilities were considered so poor as to require complete reconstruction, this payment was denied. In the short term this led to a 39% {{reduction in the number of}} prisons in England, including some famous castle prisons such as Norwich; over the coming years, <b>centralisation</b> and changes in prison design led to the closure of most remaining castle prisons.|$|E
5|$|Transport in the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR) was an {{important}} part of the nation's economy. The economic <b>centralisation</b> of the late 1920s and 1930s led to the development of infrastructure at a massive scale and rapid pace. Before the Soviet Union's collapse in 1991, there were a wide variety of modes of transport by land, water and air. However, because of government policies before, during and after the Era of Stagnation, investments in transport were low. By the late 1970s and early 1980s Soviet economists were calling for the construction of more roads to alleviate some of the strain from the railways and to improve the state budget. The Civil aviation industry, represented by Aeroflot, was the largest in the world, but inefficiencies plagued it until the USSR's collapse. The road network remained underdeveloped, and dirt roads were common outside major cities. At the same time, the attendance of the few roads they had were ill-equipped to handle this growing problem. By the late-1980s, after the death of Leonid Brezhnev, his successors tried, without success, to solve these problems. At the same time, the automobile industry was growing at a faster rate than the construction of new roads. By the mid-1970s, only 0.8 percent of the Soviet population owned a car.|$|E
5|$|The 2/1st Machine Gun Battalion {{was formed}} on 14 December 1939, {{as part of}} the Second Australian Imperial Force (2nd AIF). It was raised {{following}} a reorganisation of the 6th Division's infantry battalions, which saw the removal of the machine gun platoons that had previously existed within each battalion and their <b>centralisation</b> in a single unit. Three other machine gun battalions were subsequently raised {{as part of the}} 2nd AIF during the war to support its four infantry divisions. Developed by the British Army, the concept within the Australian Army had its genesis during the Gallipoli Campaign in 1915, when the machine guns assigned to the infantry battalions– initially two and then, later, four– had been grouped together and co-ordinated at brigade level to help compensate for the lack of artillery support. Over {{the course of the war}} on the Western Front, the concept had evolved through the establishment of machine gun companies in 1916 to the establishment of machine gun battalions in 1918. Similar formations had also been established amongst the Australian Light Horse units serving in the Sinai and Palestine Campaign. During the inter-war years, the machine gun battalions had been deemed unnecessary. When the Army was reorganised in 1921, they were not re-raised, but in 1937, when the Army looked to expand as fears of war in Europe loomed, four such units were raised within the part-time Militia by converting light horse units and motorising them. When the Second World War broke out, the decision was made to raise several machine gun battalions within the 2nd AIF, one allocated to each division.|$|E
25|$|Fraser {{declared}} {{his opposition to}} the <b>centralisation</b> of Scottish police forces, on 25 October, saying 'Such a <b>centralisation</b> of power is incompatible with a belief in localism that is common across western European centre-right parties'.|$|E
25|$|Two {{significant}} revolts {{occurred in}} the 17th and 18th centuries: the Revolt of the papier timbré (1675) and the Pontcallec Conspiracy (1719). Both arose from attempts to resist <b>centralisation</b> and assert Breton constitutional exceptions to tax.|$|E
25|$|The Roman Empire's {{constitution}} {{emerged as}} a transformation of the late Roman Republic's constitution, utilising various late Republican precedents, to legitimise the granting of incredible legal powers to one man and the <b>centralisation</b> of legal powers into bodies which that man controlled.|$|E
25|$|Deuteronomy {{stresses}} {{the uniqueness of}} God, the need for drastic <b>centralisation</b> of worship, and {{a concern for the}} position of the poor and disadvantaged. Its many themes can be organised around the three poles of Israel, Israel's God, and the covenant which binds them together.|$|E
25|$|The {{reforms of}} Shang Yang in Qin, and of Wu Qi in Chu, both centred on {{increased}} <b>centralisation,</b> {{the suppression of}} the nobility, and a vastly increased scope of government based on Legalist ideals, which were necessary to mobilise the large armies of the period.|$|E
25|$|Leo was a {{significant}} contributor to the <b>centralisation</b> of spiritual authority within the Church and in reaffirming papal authority. The bishop of Rome had gradually become viewed as the chief patriarch in the Western church. Leo would push that authority into a new realm.|$|E
25|$|The general {{tendency}} of administrative <b>centralisation</b> under the Tudor dynasty began to undermine Cornwall's distinctive status. For example, under the Tudors, {{the practice of}} distinguishing between some laws, such as those related to the tin industry, that applied simply in Anglia or in Anglia et Cornubia (in England and Cornwall) ceased.|$|E
25|$|Josiah's {{changes are}} {{described}} in two accounts in the Bible, 2 Kings 22-23, and 2 Chronicles 34-35. They began with the ending of ancient Israelite religious practices, and the astral cults that had become popular in the 8th Century, and led to <b>centralisation</b> of worship in Jerusalem, {{and the destruction of}} the temple at Bethel.|$|E
25|$|There {{was strong}} support for the report from all sides of Parliament. The report's ideas were quickly passed into law. The Whigs {{controlled}} the House of Commons and supported the utilitarian arguments of thinkers such as Jeremy Bentham. Those that did not support the bill were more concerned with the levels of <b>centralisation</b> the act would bring rather than the recommendations of the report such as the building of workhouses.|$|E
25|$|During Gandhi's {{new term}} as prime minister, her {{youngest}} son Sanjay {{died in an}} aeroplane crash in June 1980. This led her to encourage her elder son Rajiv, who {{was working as a}} pilot, to enter politics. Gradually, Indira Gandhi's politics and outlook grew more authoritarian and autocratic, and she became the central figure of the Congress. As prime minister, she became known for her political ruthlessness and unprecedented <b>centralisation</b> of power.|$|E
25|$|Together with an {{increasing}} <b>centralisation</b> {{of government in}} the Scandinavian countries, the old system of leidang—a fleet mobilisation system, where every skipen (ship community) had to deliver one ship and crew—was discontinued. Changes in shipbuilding {{in the rest of}} Europe led to the demise of the longship for military purposes. By the 11th and 12th centuries, European fighting ships were built with raised platforms fore and aft, from which archers could shoot down into the relatively low longships.|$|E
25|$|Modi's {{first year}} as prime {{minister}} saw significant centralization of power relative to previous administrations. Modi personally selected the civil servants who served under his ministers, frequently giving them instructions without involving the ministers themselves. Modi's efforts at <b>centralisation</b> {{have been linked to}} {{an increase in the number}} of senior administration officials resigning their positions. Although the government has a majority of seats in the Lok Sabha, it does not have one in the Rajya Sabha, which led to its policied frequently being stymied there. Thus, Modi resorted to passing a number of ordinances, or executive orders, to enact his policies, leading to further <b>centralisation</b> of power. In 2014, the Prime Minister's Office prevented Gopal Subramaniam from being appointed to the Supreme Court. The stated reason was that his conduct in the 2G spectrum allocation scandal had been suspect: commentators stated it was because he had been the amicus curiae in the Sohrabuddin Sheikh case, which had implicated BJP leaders including Modi's aide Amit Shah. The government also passed a bill increasing the control that it had over the appointment of judges, and reducing that of the judiciary.|$|E

25|$|Welsh {{as a first}} {{language}} is largely concentrated in the less urban north and west of Wales, principally Gwynedd, inland Denbighshire, northern and south-western Powys, the Isle of Anglesey, Carmarthenshire, North Pembrokeshire, Ceredigion, and parts of western Glamorgan, although first-language and other fluent speakers can be found throughout Wales. However, Cardiff is now home to an urban Welsh-speaking population (both {{from other parts of}} Wales and from the growing Welsh-medium schools of Cardiff itself) due to the <b>centralisation</b> and concentration of national resources and organisations in the capital.|$|E
25|$|Consequently, Australia {{has one of}} {{the most}} {{pronounced}} vertical fiscal imbalances in the world: the states and territories collect just 18% of all governmental revenues but are responsible for almost 50% of the spending areas. Furthermore, the <b>centralisation</b> of revenue collection has allowed Canberra to force state policy in areas well beyond the scope of its constitutional powers, by using the grants power (s.96) to mandate the terms on which the states spend money in areas over which the it has no power (such as spending on education, health and policing).|$|E
25|$|The current Chief Scout of The Scout Association of Australia is Sir Peter Cosgrove, {{who is the}} Governor-General of Australia. The Chief Scout of {{each state}} branch had usually been the Governor of the state. In 2015, the actor Shane Jacobson was {{appointed}} as the Chief Scout of the Victorian branch. In 1942, Sir Leslie Orme Wilson, the Governor of Queensland, resigned as The Boy Scouts Association's Chief Scout of Queensland due {{to the failure of}} the Queensland Branch to respond to his call for reforms to its <b>centralisation</b> effort that led to the severance of the Mount Morgan Blue Boy Scouts.|$|E
25|$|The war in Bosnia and Herzegovina {{came about}} {{as a result of}} the breakup of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. A crisis emerged in Yugoslavia {{as a result of the}} {{weakening}} of the confederational system at the end of the Cold War. In Yugoslavia, the national communist party, the League of Communists of Yugoslavia, was losing its ideological potency. Meanwhile, ethnic nationalism experienced a renaissance in the 1980s, after violence broke out in Kosovo. While the goal of Serbian nationalists was the <b>centralisation</b> of Yugoslavia, other nationalities in Yugoslavia aspired to the federalisation and the decentralisation of the state.|$|E
