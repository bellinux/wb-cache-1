25|$|Although ñ is used {{by other}} {{languages}} whose spellings were influenced by Spanish, it has recently been chosen to represent {{the identity of the}} Spanish language, especially {{as a result of the}} battle against its obliteration from <b>computer</b> <b>keyboards</b> by an English-led industry.|$|E
40|$|Although {{computer}} {{use is a}} risk factor for musculoskeletal disorders, there is currently no valid and reliable method to measure <b>computer</b> <b>keyboarding</b> style in the workplace. This paper provides the frequencies and distribution of items of the <b>Keyboard</b> Personal <b>Computer</b> Style instrument (K-PeCS), a 20 item criterion-based observational instrument {{that can be used in}} the workplace to document <b>computer</b> <b>keyboard</b> workstyle. The K-PeCS was used to rate the <b>computer</b> <b>keyboarding</b> style of 21 {{computer use}}rs in their workplace. The resulting frequency and distribution suggest that the K-PeCS documents a variety of postures and behaviors that occur during <b>computer</b> <b>keyboarding</b> tasks, and that the criterion selected are reasonably well-distributed amongst this sample of <b>computer</b> <b>keyboard</b> users. The K-PeCS, therefore, is adequately capturing the varied aspects of <b>computer</b> <b>keyboarding</b> style...|$|R

25|$|The QZERTY layout {{was used}} mostly, if not exclusively, in Italy, {{where it was}} the {{traditional}} typewriter layout. In recent years, however, a modified QWERTY layout with stressed keys such as à, è, ò, has gained widespread usage throughout Italy. <b>Computer</b> <b>keyboards</b> usually have QWERTY, although non-alphanumeric characters vary.|$|E
25|$|<b>Computer</b> <b>keyboards</b> include control {{circuitry}} to convert key presses into key codes (usually scancodes) that the computer's electronics can understand. The key switches are connected via the {{printed circuit board}} in an electrical X-Y matrix where a voltage is provided sequentially to the Y lines and, when a key is depressed, detected sequentially by scanning the X lines.|$|E
25|$|In modern {{typography}} {{there was}} insufficient space on typewriters and later <b>computer</b> <b>keyboards</b> {{to allow for}} both an O-with-dots (also representing Ö) and an O-with-bars. Since they looked nearly identical, the two glyphs were combined, which was also done in computer character encodings such as ISO 8859-1. As a result {{there was no way}} to differentiate between the different characters.|$|E

25|$|The {{typewriter}} apostrophe (') was inherited by <b>computer</b> <b>keyboards,</b> and is {{the only}} apostrophe character available in the (7-bit) ASCII character encoding, at code value 0x27 (39). As such, it is a highly overloaded character. In ASCII, it represents a left single quotation mark, right single quotation mark, apostrophe, vertical line or prime (punctuation marks), or an acute accent (modifier letters).|$|E
25|$|Written Yoruba {{includes}} diacritical marks {{not available}} on conventional <b>computer</b> <b>keyboards,</b> requiring some adaptations. In particular, {{the use of}} the subdots and tone marks are not represented, so many Yoruba documents simply omit them. Asubiaro Toluwase, in his 2014 paper, points out that {{the use of the}}se diacritics can affect the retrieval of Yoruba documents by popular search engines. Therefore, their omission can {{have a significant impact on}} online research.|$|E
25|$|Standard {{alphanumeric}} keyboards have keys {{that are}} on three-quarter inch centers (0.750inches, 19.05mm), and have a key travel of at least 0.150inches (3.81mm). Desktop <b>computer</b> <b>keyboards,</b> such as the 101-key US traditional keyboards or the 104-key Windows keyboards, include alphabetic characters, punctuation symbols, numbers {{and a variety of}} function keys. The internationally common 102/104 key keyboards have a smaller left shift key and an additional key with some more symbols between that and the letter to its right (usually Z or Y). Also the enter key is usually shaped differently. <b>Computer</b> <b>keyboards</b> are similar to electric-typewriter keyboards but contain additional keys, such as the command or Windows keys. There is no standard computer keyboard, although many manufacture imitate the keyboard of PCs. There are actually three different PC keyboard: the original PC keyboard with 84 keys, the AT keyboard also with 84 keys and the enhanced keyboard with 101 keys. The three differ somewhat in the placement of function keys, the control keys, the return key, and the shift key.|$|E

25|$|A list of {{approved}} {{manufacturers and}} retailers offering antimicrobial copper {{products to the}} regulated U.S. market is also available. These firms have completed all legal requirements to sell antimicrobial copper products {{in accordance with the}} U.S. E.P.A registrations. Products offered by the approved companies include sinks, <b>computer</b> <b>keyboards,</b> faucets, IV poles, tables, stretcher rails, railings, hampers, decorative and architectural hardware (levers, grips, knobs, pulls, towel bars, grab bars, kick plates, bath accessories, outlet covers, light switch covers), laboratory incubators, cabinet hardware, decorative tile, and free weights.|$|E
25|$|On {{almost all}} devices with a numeric keypad such as telephones, computers, etc., the 5 key has a raised dot or raised bar to make dialing easier. Persons {{who are blind}} or have low vision find it useful to be able to feel the keys of a telephone. All other numbers can be found with their {{relative}} position around the 5 button (on <b>computer</b> <b>keyboards,</b> the 5 key of the numpad has the raised dot or bar, but the 5 key that shifts with % does not).|$|E
25|$|Touchpads are {{primarily}} used in self-contained portable laptop computers {{and do not}} require a flat surface near the machine. The touchpad {{is close to the}} keyboard, and only very short finger movements are required to move the cursor across the display screen; while advantageous, this also makes it possible for a user's palm or wrist to move the mouse cursor accidentally while typing. Touchpads also exist for desktop computers as an external peripheral, albeit rarely seen. Touchpads are sometimes integrated in some desktop <b>computer</b> <b>keyboards,</b> particularly keyboards oriented for HTPC use.|$|E

25|$|The first <b>computer</b> <b>keyboards</b> {{were for}} {{mainframe}} computer data terminals and used discrete electronic parts. The first keyboard microprocessor {{was introduced in}} 1972 by General Instruments, but keyboards have been using the single-chip 8048 microcontroller variant since it became available in 1978. The keyboard switch matrix is wired to its inputs, it converts the keystrokes to key codes, and, for a detached keyboard, sends the codes down a serial cable (the keyboard cord) to the main processor on the computer motherboard. This serial keyboard cable communication is only bi-directional {{to the extent that}} the computer's electronics controls the illumination of the caps lock, num lock and scroll lock lights.|$|E
25|$|Many, but not all, <b>computer</b> <b>keyboards</b> have a numeric keypad to {{the right}} of the {{alphabetic}} keyboard, often separated from the other groups of keys such as the function keys and system command keys, which contains numbers, basic mathematical symbols (e.g., addition, subtraction, etc.), and a few function keys. On Japanese/Korean keyboards, there may be Language input keys for changing the language to use. Some keyboards have power management keys(e.g., power key, sleep key and wake key); Internet keys to access a web browser or E-mail; and/or multimedia keys, such as volume controls; or keys that can be programmed by the user to launch a specified application or a command like minimizing all windows.|$|E
25|$|The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), {{which oversees}} the {{regulation}} of antimicrobial agents and materials in that country, found that copper alloys kill more than 99.9% of disease-causing bacteria within just two hours when cleaned regularly. Copper and copper alloys are unique classes of solid materials as no other solid touch surfaces have permission in the U.S. to make human health claims (EPA public health registrations were previously restricted only to liquid and gaseous products). The EPA has granted antimicrobial registration status to 355 different copper alloy compositions. In healthcare applications, EPA-approved antimicrobial copper products include bedrails, handrails, over-bed tables, sinks, faucets, door knobs, toilet hardware, intravenous poles, <b>computer</b> <b>keyboards,</b> etc. In public facility applications, EPA-approved antimicrobial copper products include health club equipment, elevator equipment, shopping cart handles, etc. In residential building applications, EPA-approved antimicrobial copper products include kitchen surfaces, bedrails, footboards, door push plates, towel bars, toilet hardware, wall tiles, etc. In mass transit facilities, EPA-approved antimicrobial copper products include handrails, stair rails grab bars, chairs, benches, etc. A comprehensive list of copper alloy surface products that have been granted antimicrobial registration status with public health claims by the EPA can be found here: Antimicrobial copper-alloy touch surfaces#Approved products.|$|E

500|$|Copper-alloy touch {{surfaces}} have natural {{properties that}} destroy {{a wide range}} of microorganisms (e.g., E. coli O157:H7, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Staphylococcus, Clostridium difficile, influenza A virus, adenovirus, and fungi). Some 355 copper alloys were proven to kill more than 99.9% of disease-causing bacteria within just two hours when cleaned regularly. The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has approved the registrations of these copper alloys as [...] "antimicrobial materials with public health benefits"; that approval allows manufacturers to make legal claims to the public health benefits of products made of registered alloys. In addition, the EPA has approved a long list of antimicrobial copper products made from these alloys, such as bedrails, handrails, over-bed tables, sinks, faucets, door knobs, toilet hardware, <b>computer</b> <b>keyboards,</b> health club equipment, and shopping cart handles (for a comprehensive list, see: Antimicrobial copper-alloy touch surfaces#Approved products). Copper doorknobs are used by hospitals to reduce the transfer of disease, and Legionnaires' disease is suppressed by copper tubing in plumbing systems. Antimicrobial copper alloy products are now being installed in healthcare facilities in the U.K., Ireland, Japan, Korea, France, Denmark, and Brazil and in the subway transit system in Santiago, Chile, where copper-zinc alloy handrails will be installed in some 30 stations between 2011 and 2014.|$|E
