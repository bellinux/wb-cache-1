50|$|Many {{communication}} satellites share a given frequency band. As a signal is transmitted {{to a particular}} satellite there is some amount of side lobe or spillover energy that is transmitted to adjacent satellites. At a receive station that has two antennas, one pointed at the primary satellite (the satellite the signal is intended for) and a secondary satellite (a satellite that is receiving side lobe energy), both paths of the signal are received and measured. From a comparison of those paths, two measurements can be made: Differential Time Offset (DTO) and Differential Frequency Offset (DFO). These measurements are often implemented through correlation processing. DTO represents the difference in time that it takes the signal to travel through the two satellites, while DFO represents the difference in frequency the received signals present through the two satellites. The frequency differences observed are due to different Doppler shift resulting from relative satellite motion and differences in the translation frequencies of the two satellite channels. <b>Channel</b> <b>translation</b> frequencies and downlink Doppler shift and delay can be calibrated out of the measurements by observing transmitters of known location simultaneously on the channels. This leaves the uplink DTO and DFO as the observables. See 'Reference Signals' below.|$|E

40|$|Bed {{material}} {{waves are}} temporary zones of sediment accumulation created by large sediment inputs. Recent theoretical, experimental and field studies examine factors influencing dispersion and translation of bed material waves in quasiuniform, gravel-bed channels. Exchanges of sediment between a channel and its floodplain are neglected. Within these constraints, two factors influence relative rates of dispersion and translation: (1) interactions between wave topography, flow and bed load transport; and (2) particle-size differences between wave material and original bed material. Our {{results indicate that}} dispersion dominates the evolution of bed material waves in gravel-bed <b>channels.</b> Significant <b>translation</b> requires a low Froude number, which is uncharacteristic of gravel-bed channels, and low wave amplitude which, for a large wave, can be achieved only after substantial dispersion. Wave material of small particle size can promote translation, but it primarily increases bed load transport rate and thereby accelerates wave evolution. Copyright © 2001 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

50|$|Fox Kids, then Jetix, and now Disney Channel {{have been}} {{available}} in all cable operators in Bulgaria since around 1999 and were mostly broadcast with either the Russian or English language audio track. In October 2007, a Bulgarian audio track was added to {{for some of the}} shows on Jetix. Jetix was previously shown in Bulgaria on bTV, which continued to air a Jetix block even after Fox Kids was sold to Disney. Translation and distribution for the channel's Bulgarian version was handled by Media Link. It was expected that the channel would reach 100% translation of its shows in 2008. However, this was achieved only in early 2009, with many shows being withheld from broadcast after February 2009 until translation of their episodes was completed. In May and June many such programs were returned to the <b>channel,</b> since <b>translation</b> had advanced a lot. Hannah Montana was the only untranslated show, but it was available in Bulgarian on BNT 1 since March 28, 2009. Promos aired in English and not in Bulgarian.|$|R

40|$|Recently, Tchamkerten and {{coworkers}} proposed a novel {{variation of the}} problem of joint synchronization and error correction. This paper considers a strengthened formulation that requires the decoder to estimate both the message and the location of the codeword exactly. Such a scheme allows for transmitting data bits in the synchronization phase of the communication, thereby improving bandwidth and energy efficiencies. It is shown that the capacity region remains unchanged under the exact synchronization requirement. Furthermore, asynchronous capacity can be achieved by universal (channel independent) codes. Comparisons with earlier results on another (delay compensated) definition of rate are made. The finite blocklength regime is investigated and it is demonstrated that even for moderate blocklengths, it is possible to construct capacity-achieving codes that tolerate exponential level of asynchronism and experience only a rather small loss in rate compared to the perfectly synchronized setting; in particular, the channel dispersion does not suffer any degradation due to asynchronism. For the binary symmetric <b>channel,</b> a <b>translation</b> (coset) of a good linear code is shown to achieve the capacity-synchronization tradeoff. National Science Foundation (U. S.)

40|$|AbstractThe mouse {{potassium}} channel Kir 2. 3 possesses conserved extracellular cysteine residues at positions 113 and 145. We {{have investigated the}} role of these cysteines in structure/function and membrane trafficking. Cysteine to serine mutations resulted {{in the absence of}} potassium currents in oocytes and co-expression of these mutants with wild-type channel showed a dominant negative inhibition of wild-type currents. FLAG-tagged channels expressed in oocytes were detected in the cell membrane by anti-FLAG antibody for wild-type and mutant <b>channels.</b> In vitro <b>translation</b> using the reticulocyte lysate system showed that mutation of these residues did not affect processing nor insertion into membranes. Cysteine residues at 113 and 145 are therefore required for function of the Kir 2. 3 channel but not for processing into the cell membrane; disulfide bonds between subunits are unlikely...|$|R
40|$|A {{model for}} attentional {{scanning}} is {{constructed in the}} form of a gating network which consists of gating lattices. A gating lattice is a sparsely-connected neural network. The process of covert attention is interpreted as a biological solution to the problem of translation-invariant pattern processing. We arrive at the final result by a sequence of pattern <b>translations</b> <b>channelled</b> through the gating network. Simulation studies and theoretical considerations reveal that the gating lattice gives rise to a trade off between gating quality and gating flexibility. The gating network is shown to be capable of translation-invariant processing of object patterns that are part of a natural image. 1 BACKGROUND Visual systems succeed remarkably well in extracting invariant properties of incoming patterns. An example of such a property is object identity. Visual priming (i. e., the facilitated speed and enhanced accuracy of identification due to prior object exposure) has been shown to be indepen [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Decoding {{algorithm}} {{is a crucial}} part in statistical machine translation. We describe a stack decoding algorithm in this paper. We present the hypothesis scoring method and the heuristics used in our algorithm. We report several techniques deployed to improve {{the performance of the}} decoder. We also introduce a simplified model to moderate the sparse data problem and to speed up the decoding process. We evaluate and compare these techniques/models in our statistical machine translation system. 1 Introduction 1. 1 Statistical Machine Translation Statistical machine translation is based on a channel model. Given a sentence T in one language (German) to be translated into another language (English), it considers T as the target of a communication <b>channel,</b> and its <b>translation</b> S as the source of the channel. Hence the machine translation task becomes to recover the source from the target. Basically every English sentence is a possible source for a German target sentence. If we assign a pr [...] ...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, an {{improved}} precoding strategy for broadcast channels, i. e., the transmission from one central transmitter (e. g., base station) {{to a number}} of distributed receivers (e. g., mobile terminals), is presented. The new scheme is a generalization of Tomlinson-Harashima precoding applied to multiple-input/multiple-output (MIMO) <b>channels</b> and a <b>translation</b> of concepts from lattice-reduction-aided detection in MIMO communication systems to the broadcast scenario. The main idea is not to suppress the multi-user interference completely, but to shape them to values which solely contribute to the anyway present periodic extension of the signal set. Although the method is generally applicable, we concentrate on situations with 2 users and binary signaling per real dimension. Here, the interferences are allowed to be taken from the even integers, hence we call the new scheme “even-integer interference precoding”. Simulation results show that using the proposed technique, a considerable degree of diversity can be gained over linear preequalization, as well as conventional precoding. ...|$|R
40|$|Large {{conductance}} voltage- and Ca 2 +-dependent K+ (MaxiK) channels show sequence {{similarities to}} voltage-gated ion channels. They have a homologous S 1 -S 6 region, but are unique at the N and C termini. At the C terminus, MaxiK channels have four additional hydrophobic regions (S 7 -S 10) of unknown topology. At the N terminus, we have recently proposed {{a new model}} where MaxiK channels have an additional transmembrane region (S 0) that confers β subunit regulation. Using transient expression of epitope tagged MaxiK <b>channels,</b> in vitro <b>translation,</b> functional, and “in vivo” reconstitution assays, we now show that MaxiK channels have seven transmembrane segments (S 0 -S 6) at the N terminus and a S 1 -S 6 region that folds {{in a similar way}} as in voltage-gated ion channels. Further, our results indicate that hydrophobic segments S 9 -S 10 in the C terminus are cytoplasmic and unequivocally demonstrate that S 0 forms an additional transmembrane segment leading to an exoplasmic N terminus...|$|R
40|$|Multispanning {{membrane}} proteins - i. e., proteins {{with multiple}} transmembrane domains that thread back-and-forth across the cell membrane - {{are essential for}} cellular functions that include signal transduction, material transport, and energy conversion. Performing these functions requires the proteins to integrate within the membrane in the correct topology, or the overall orientation of the protein relative to the membrane. The integration of most proteins proceeds via the Sec translocon, a conserved protein-conducting channel that allows a nascent protein chain to access the membrane while being fed into the <b>channel</b> during <b>translation.</b> Previous studies have established that the Sec-facilitated integration of single-spanning proteins depends on factors including nascent chain hydrophobicity and charge; however, {{the extent to which}} these properties influence the integration and topology of multispanning proteins is less clear. Here, we use coarse-grained simulations to investigate the Sec-facilitated membrane integration of multispanning proteins on realistic biological timescales. We employ a simulation model that enables access to a timescale of minutes while retaining sufficient chemical accuracy to capture the forces that drive membrane integration. This study focuses on understanding two experimental observations: first, the finding that the protein EmrE exhibits two possible topologies in a 1 : 1 stoichiometry; and second, the finding that some marginally hydrophobic domains efficiently integrate into the membrane as part of a multispanning protein, despite inefficiently integrating as a single-spanning protein. This work provides mechanistic explanations for these observations, leading to insight into the sequence-level determinants of multispanning membrane protein integration and topology (1) ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} an evaluation {{and analysis of}} resistance parameters: friction slope, friction velocity and Manning coefficient in unsteady flow. The methodology to enhance the evaluation of resistance by relations derived from flow equations is proposed. The main points of the methodology are (1) to choose a resistance relation with regard to a shape of a channel and (2) type of wave, (3) to choose an appropriate method to evaluate slope of water depth, and (4) to assess the uncertainty of result. In addition to a critical analysis of existing methods, new approaches are presented: formulae for resistance parameters for a trapezoidal <b>channel,</b> and a <b>translation</b> method instead of Jones' formula to evaluate the gradient of flow depth. Measurements obtained from artificial dam-break flood waves in a small lowland watercourse {{have made it possible}} to apply the method and to analyse to what extent resistance parameters vary in unsteady flow. The study demonstrates that results of friction slope and friction velocity are more sensitive to applying simplified formulae than the Manning coefficient (n). n is adequate as a flood routing parameter but may be misleading when information on trend of resistance with flow rate is crucial. Then friction slope or friction velocity seems to be better choice...|$|R
40|$|Total charge {{exchange}} and excitation cross-sections are presented for collisions between He(^ 2 +) ions and helium atoms, the laboratory frame collision energy {{being in the}} range 16 - 800 keV. Cross-sections from the helium ground state and the He(ls 2 s(^ 1) S) and He(ls 2 s(^ 3) S) metastable states are calculated. The calculations were performed using the semiclassical impact parameter model where wave-functions are expressed as an expansion of two-electron atomic basis states. Transfer <b>channels</b> included plane-wave <b>translation</b> factors. The transition He(^+) (n = 4) → He(^+) (n = 3) results in the emission of visible light (468. 5 nm) which is observed in the JET fusion device. Helium beam injection into the JET device introduces some of the atoms in initially excited states. Even {{a small fraction of}} metastable helium effects the observed 468. 5 nm spectrum significantly because of the very large {{charge exchange}} cross-sections. Accurate charge exchange cross-sections to the He(^+) (n = 4) states are required to analyse the spectroscopic data used in the diagnosis of the plasma. The cross-sections produced are therefore also presented in a form suitable for direct inclusion into the plasma analysis database. Where possible the current results are compared to previous calculations. Total charge exchange cross-sections from the He(ls 2 s(^ 1) S) state are in good agreement with the previous one-electron calculation. Charge exchange cross-sections from the triplet state are found to differ with those from the singlet. The results are discussed {{in the context of their}} usefulness in the diagnosis of fusion plasmas. Suggestions for further work are made...|$|R
40|$|Communities {{employ a}} wide variety of methods to reduce {{critical}} encounters and dog population numbers. However, systematic studies evaluating the success of approaches and techniques are currently lacking. Nor has significant consideration of community decision-making processes and policy development, or of the long-term sustainability of these programs been completed. Therefore, to assess the perception of dog-related issues, methods of policy creation and implementation, and true within-community dog demographic characteristics and rate of aggressive encounters a community-based research project was developed. A multiphase, convergent mixed methods study design in four separate northern Saskatchewan communities was implemented to evaluate these concerns. Methods of community-driven policy creation and implementation were recorded, management plans and strategies were monitored, and options were evaluated for successful reduction in dog bites and violent encounters. Community-based participatory methods created exchange and discussion with all levels of society, providing in-depth two-way <b>channels</b> for knowledge <b>translation</b> for researchers and community members. Policy creation and implementation was found to vary significantly between communities. Policies surrounding dog ownership and bite prevention are often dependent upon perceived risks for imminent human-canine aggressive encounters. Regrettably, sustainable interventions require sustained key community partner support and resource access. Community engagement and knowledge translation creates long-term, trusting relationships permitting more in-depth understanding of group choices. In addition, involving community members in research and data collection provides public appreciation of the scope and breadth of community issues and opinions. Enabling and empowering communities entails constant communication and education of all parties. No single model can be effective in all situations. Although enforceable legislation and widespread canine sterilisation are key aspects for community dog issues, comprehensive all-inclusive community education is indispensable. Wide-spread education and communication have the potential to dramatically decrease the number of aggressive dog:human encounters and fulfil goals for dog-human relationships that occur in indigenous communities in Canada...|$|R
40|$|Most planar imaging {{techniques}} require {{some sort of}} calibration to associate image coordinates with physical coordinates. A viewing arrangement in which the object plane (e. g. laser light-sheet) {{is parallel to the}} image plane involves a simple linear transformation consisting of translation, scaling and possibly rotation. This is no longer the case for oblique viewing arrangements or if lens distortion is present. In effect the normal viewing arrangement should be considered a special case of the oblique viewing arrangement. The calibration procedure for the more generalized oblique viewing arrangement typically requires high order mapping functions to transform image pixels to physical space coordinates. Additional calibration is necessary for multi-component measurements such as Doppler global velocimetry (DGV) or stereoscopic PIV. In these cases the positions of the cameras with respect to the image plane are required to reconstruct the three velocity components. A rather pragmatic approach is the direct measurement of the camera positions with respect to the object plane (Willert, 1997) which is not necessarily trivial in complex geometries involving windows or change of media (i. e. air-glass-water interface). The investigation was motivated by the need for reliable methods of camera calibration in various industrial wind tunnel and turbo-machinery applications of PIV and DGV. The use of translated (or multi-level) calibration targets is not always possible due to time constraints or setup complexity (i. e. measurements in curved <b>channels).</b> Even if <b>translation</b> targets were used, it was found that a larger number of calibration images or more complex camera models did not necessarily improve the final calibration result. Three implementations of pinhole-based camera models for use in common light-sheet imaging arrangements are described in the context of application to particle image velocimetry (PIV) and Doppler global velocimetry (DGV). Calibration data obtained from translated calibration targets was found to yield camera attitude within 0. 1 degrees on a variety of different test cases with object distance varying as little as 2...|$|R
40|$|Direct current slice {{velocity}} map ion {{images of}} the HCl(v‘ = 0, J‘) products from the photoinitiated reactions of ground state Cl atoms with ethane, oxirane (c-C 2 H 4 O), and oxetane (c-C 3 H 6 O), at respective mean collision energies of 5. 5, 6. 5, and 7. 3 kcal mol- 1, were analyzed using a Legendre moment fitting procedure. The experimental method and the fitting technique were tested by comparing the derived center-of-mass (CM) frame angular scattering distribution for the HCl(v‘ = 0, J‘ = 1) products from the reaction of Cl + C 2 H 6 with those determined by Suits and co-workers from a crossed molecular beam experiment. For the Cl + c-C 2 H 4 O reaction, a broad, forward, and backward peaking CM frame angular distribution of HCl(v‘ = 0, J‘ = 2) products was determined, with an average fraction of the available energy released as product translational energy of ft, equal to 0. 52 ± 0. 18. The HCl consumes only 1 % of the available energy, and conservation arguments dictate that the radical coproduct is significantly internally excited, corresponding to an average fraction of the available energy of fint(c-C 2 H 3 O), equal to 0. 47 ± 0. 18. For the reaction of oxetane with Cl atoms, abstraction of H atoms is possible from carbon atoms from positions either α or β to the O atom. The contributions to the reaction from these two H-atom abstraction channels were estimated to be 63 and 37 %, consistent with an unbiased propensity for removal of α- and β-H atoms that are present in 2 : 1 abundance. The angular scatter of products in the CM frame is also broad and forward−backward peaking and {{is reminiscent of the}} products of the Cl + CH 3 OH and CH 3 OCH 3 reactions. The derived mean fraction of the available energy <b>channelled</b> into product <b>translation</b> is ft = 0. 54 ± 0. 12 for each of the two abstraction pathways. With only a small amount of energy in the rotation of the HCl(v‘ = 0), the remainder is accounted for by excitation of the radical coproduct internal modes, with fint(c-C 3 H 5 O) = 0. 42 ± 0. 12 for both α- and β-H abstraction. The broad product scattering in the CM frame observed for both reactions of Cl atoms with the cyclic ethers is consistent with reactive collisions over a wide range of impact parameters, as might be expected for barrierless reactions with loose transition states...|$|R
