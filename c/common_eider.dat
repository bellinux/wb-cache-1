The rivers are an important habitat for the Atlantic salmon, which return from Greenland and the Faroe Islands to spawn in fresh water. As a result of this, a recreational fishery has been developed, {{with a number of}} remote lodges and camps available to host sport-fishermen. The Kandalaksha Nature Reserve, established in 1932 to protect the population of <b>common</b> <b>eider,</b> is organized in thirteen clusters located in the Kandalaksha Gulf of the Kola Peninsula and along the coasts of the Barents Sea.|$|E
5|$|The {{area around}} Wijdefjorden {{was first used}} by Russian, and later Norwegian, trappers. The cabin at Krosspynten was erected in 1910, {{and two years later}} the cabin at Purpurdalen was built. Trappers {{considered}} the area to have few polar bears but much fox; they could also supplement the catch with <b>common</b> <b>eider.</b> In 1928, a season of trapping gave about 50 Arctic foxes. In 1932, the area's special vegetation was protected, which was assimilated into the national park when it was created. Since the 1980s, trapping has again been taken up, and the Governor of Svalbard has one cabin at Austfjordnes that can be rented for a season of trapping. Of the larger fjords on Svalbard, Wijdefjorden is the least affected by humans.|$|E
5|$|The tundra is a sub-Arctic zone with long, cold winters and short, warm summers. Precipitation is low. Soil a meter {{below ground}} and deeper is {{permanently}} frozen (permafrost), {{which does not}} allow water to drain easily through the soil, so it collects in shallow pools. Trees and shrubs are stunted since their roots cannot grow into the permafrost. Low shrubs, lichens, mosses, and small herbaceous plants are found instead. The most common mammals on the tundra are the barren-ground caribou, Arctic wolf, Arctic fox, Arctic hare, lemmings, and voles. Occasional sightings of muskoxen have been made near Cape Chidley, Labrador's most northerly point. The polar bear is the dominant carnivore of the tundra, but is an occasional visitor to coastal Newfoundland, especially in the spring. Many birds migrate to Labrador in spring to lay their eggs and raise their young before returning south for the winter, including the <b>common</b> <b>eider,</b> harlequin duck, Common redpoll and American pipit. The Labrador tundra is also permanent home to ptarmigan.|$|E

40|$|In {{the present}} thesis, {{environmental}} exposure to 18 {{persistent organic pollutants}} (POPs) and 8 elements, as well as potential antioxidant responses and genotoxic effects in incubating female <b>common</b> <b>eiders</b> (Somateria mollissima) were investigated. <b>Common</b> <b>eiders</b> are long-lived, benthic feeding seaducks. Because only the females incubate the eggs, they fast for approximately 26 days during the incubation period. Consequently, female <b>common</b> <b>eiders</b> endure high natural nutritional stress, and when their fat reserves are mobilized during the nesting period, lipophilic POPs are redistributed from fat storage to the circulation. In this thesis, blood of female <b>common</b> <b>eiders,</b> nesting in Svalbard, was sampled at day 5 and at day 20 of incubation during two years. Whole blood was analysed for POP concentrations and DNA double-strand breaks (DNA DSBs) in the same individuals at both incubation times. During two years, blood concentrations of POPs were analysed {{at the end of}} the fasting incubation period in the Baltic Sea and in the Svalbard population of <b>common</b> <b>eiders.</b> Furthermore, element levels in blood and feather, as well as total antioxidant capacity (TAC), total glutathione (tGSH), carotenoids and DNA DSBs were analysed in both Baltic and Svalbard females after ~ 26 days of fasting. In the Baltic Sea, which has been considered one of the most polluted seas in the world, the population of <b>common</b> <b>eiders</b> is declining and considered endangered, while in Svalbard, the <b>common</b> <b>eiders</b> population is stable. To assess the impact of POP and element exposure on female <b>common</b> <b>eiders</b> during the fasting incubation, pollutant levels, antioxidant levels and DNA DSB frequencies were compared between these eider populations, potentially exposed to differing pollutant levels. The present thesis documented blood concentrations of most POPs, with the exception of four chlordane compounds and HCB, to be up to 26 times higher in the Baltic breeding <b>common</b> <b>eiders</b> compared to Svalbard eiders. Furthermore, blood concentrations of mercury (Hg) were higher in the blood of the Baltic females. The comparison of blood and feather concentrations of elements, however, indicated differing exposure levels for several elements at the breeding- and winter- location of the females. The frequency of DNA DSBs increased significantly during the fasting incubation period in Svalbard females. The decreased DNA integrity of Svalbard <b>common</b> <b>eiders</b> was positively related to body mass loss during the same period, but not to the increase in blood concentrations of POPs. Both TAC and tGSH concentrations were significantly up-regulated in the more polluted Baltic Sea population compared to the Svalbard population. The TAC was positively related to 14 POPs, but there was no relationship between any of the pollutants and tGSH concentrations. Furthermore, carotenoid levels did not differ between the two populations. Although the frequencies of DNA DSBs did not differ between the high-polluted Baltic Sea population and the less-polluted Svalbard population, Hg and POPs were positively related to DNA DSB frequencies in Baltic eiders, but not in Svalbard eiders. Hence, the present thesis documents an up-regulation in antioxidant defence and a potential genotoxic response to pollutant exposure in the higher-exposed Baltic Sea population of <b>common</b> <b>eiders,</b> while in the less-exposed Svalbard population pollutants did not appear to cause effects. The positive relationship between body mass loss and DNA DSB frequency in Svalbard eiders may, however, indicate that natural stressors are more important for reducing the DNA integrity than pollutant exposure in Svalbard eiders. The present thesis suggests that seabirds feeding at low trophic levels may accumulate relatively high concentrations of POPs in polluted areas, and that assessing the pollutant impact on these species may be of importance, in particular for those species of conservation concern...|$|R

Despite access to large seabird breeding colonies, almost all large bird species hunted in Norway, including large forest grouse in more inland areas, were apparently fully-grown adults and most water birds were caught while resting on open coastal waters. Eagle-owls in northwestern Poland, an area heavily dotted with lakes, relied on birds for about 64% of the diet, more than half of which were water birds. The main prey species there was the Eurasian coot, at nearly 15% of the prey numbers. [...] In Primorsky Krai in Russia, 53.2% of the food for the eagle-owls were made up of birds, predominantly water birds with the primary prey species being the [...] crested auklet (Aethia cristatella [...] ) (26.9%).

In this study, the grey red-backed vole and reed vole (Microtus fortis) were the most numerous identified individual species but in some years the extremely large Japanese cormorant (Phalacrocorax capillatus), at , were more numerous as prey than either vole. Water birds were found to be even more important in the diet in Korea, as in wetland habitat, with birds in general comprising 68.9% by number and 85.3% by biomass there, but in adjacent upland areas birds were slightly secondary to mammals, which made up 38.7% by number and 64.7% by biomass, led by the brown rat.

Spatial patterns of winter site use, close-range distribution patterns relative to ferry passages and escape distances were examined using aerial surveys and ferry-based observations. For <b>Common</b> <b>Eiders,</b> there was a suggestion of major disturbance impacts, i. e. birds displacing {{in response to the}} passage of ferries, within 500 – 1, 000 m of the ferry route: a considerable proportion of flocks (> 10 %) located within 400 m took flight in response to a passing ferry, and distributional impacts, including birds responding by swimming, were occasionally suggested within a distance of 500 – 1, 000 m. Although distributional impacts could not be demonstrated with statistical significance within the Hjelm area (partly because of an apparently limited food supply in the area around the ferry route), it is concluded that high-speed ferry disturbance, had the potential to reduce significantly habitat use within 500 m of the ferry route.

Consequently, most Arctic-breeding seabirds migrate south to reach more benign environmental conditions. Knowledge of migration routes and wintering areas is integral for successful conservation of these globally important breeding populations. In this study, we deployed light-level geolocators on female <b>common</b> <b>eiders</b> Somateria mollissima breeding in Kongsfjorden, Svalbard, to track movements during the non-breeding season. We retrieved functioning loggers from 47 individual birds in 2009 – 2013 and mapped their migration routes and wintering areas. Thirty-six birds (77 %) wintered around the Icelandic coast and 11 (23 %) off the coasts of North Norway. Autumn migration took place between late August and late December, and spring migration from late March to late May. The migration (ca 1700 km to Iceland and 1300 km to North Norway) lasted for about 4 days in autumn and 3 days in spring. Later arrival resulted in later nest initiation, implying a carry-over effect of winter conditions on subsequent breeding.
