Proteic materials, such as collagen or fibrin, and polysaccharidic materials, like chitosan or glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), have all proved suitable in terms of cell compatibility, but some issues with potential immunogenicity still remains. Among GAGs hyaluronic acid, possibly in combination with cross linking agents (e.g. glutaraldehyde, water-soluble <b>carbodiimide,</b> etc.), {{is one of the}} possible choices as scaffold material. Functionalized groups of scaffolds may be useful in the delivery of small molecules (drugs) to specific tissues. Another form of scaffold under investigation is decellularised tissue extracts whereby the remaining cellular remnants/extracellular matrices act as the scaffold. Recently a range of nanocomposites biomaterials are fabricated by incorporating nanomaterials within polymeric matrix to engineer bioactive scaffolds.|$|E

5000|$|Haptens can be {{coupled to}} KLH using several methods. A simple {{one-step}} coupling {{can be performed}} using the <b>carbodiimide</b> crosslinker EDC to covalently attach carboxyls to primary amines. This method is the simplest to perform and the [...] "random" [...] orientation allows for antibody generation against all possible epitopes, but it generally results in some degree of polymerization, which decreases solubility making the conjugate more difficult to handle.|$|E
50|$|Examples of {{some common}} {{crosslinker}}s are the imidoester crosslinker dimethyl suberimidate, the N-Hydroxysuccinimide-ester crosslinker BS3 and formaldehyde. Each of these crosslinkers induces nucleophilic {{attack of the}} amino group of lysine and subsequent covalent bonding via the crosslinker. The zero-length <b>carbodiimide</b> crosslinker EDC functions by converting carboxyls into amine-reactive isourea intermediates that bind to lysine residues or other available primary amines.

50|$|Nanodiamonds can be {{synthesized}} {{by employing}} nanoscale carbonaceous seeds that are fabricated {{by a single}} step using a mask-free electron beam induced position technique to add amine groups to self-assemble nanodiamonds into arrays.

The surfaces of these nanodiamonds are terminated with carboxylic acid groups, enabling their attachment to amine-terminated surfaces through <b>carbodiimide</b> coupling chemistry. This process gives a high yield do that this method relies on covalent bonding between the amine and carboxyl functional groups on amorphous carbon and nanodiamond surfaces in the presence of EDC.

Other methods to determine whether NP are present {{on the surface of the}} cell are confocal microscopy, Prussian blue histochemistry, and SPMR.

50|$|A common way to {{synthesize}} an NHS-activated acid is to mix NHS with the desired carboxylic acid {{and a small}} amount of an organic base in an anhydrous solvent.
