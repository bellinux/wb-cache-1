5|$|Libyan {{involvement}} with Chad <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> have started in 1968, during the Chadian Civil War, when the insurgent Muslim National Liberation Front of Chad (FROLINAT) extended its guerrilla {{war against the}} Christian President François Tombalbaye to the northerly Borkou-Ennedi-Tibesti Prefecture (BET). Libya's king Idris I felt compelled to support the FROLINAT because of long-standing strong links {{between the two sides}} of the Chadian-Libyan border. To preserve relations with Chad's former colonial master and current protector, France, Idris limited himself to granting the rebels sanctuary in Libyan territory and to providing only non-lethal supplies.|$|E

Earlier-established civilizations to the west and north of the Maya homelands that also had scripts recorded in surviving inscriptions include the Zapotec, Olmec, and the Zoque-speaking peoples of the southern Veracruz and western Chiapas area—but their scripts are as yet largely undeciphered. It is generally agreed that the Maya writing system was adapted from {{one or more of these}} earlier systems. A number of references identify the undeciphered Olmec script as its most likely precursor.|$|E
5|$|The {{volume of}} space within which an object <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> orbit Jupiter {{is defined by}} Jupiter's Hill sphere (also called the Roche sphere). When the comet passed Jupiter in the late 1960s or early 1970s, it {{happened}} to be near its aphelion, and found itself slightly within Jupiter's Hill sphere. Jupiter's gravity nudged the comet towards it. Because the comet's motion with respect to Jupiter was very small, it fell almost straight toward Jupiter, which is why it ended up on a Jupiter-centric orbit of very high eccentricitythat is to say, the ellipse was nearly flattened out.|$|E
5|$|Reformed Christians believe baptism to {{be a sign}} of regeneration, or {{the making}} of one into a new creature, based on the {{connection}} found in the New Testament between regeneration and washing with water. Baptism also represents forgiveness or remission of sin by the sprinkling of the blood of Christ, similarly to the sprinkling of blood of sacrificial animals. Baptism is held by almost the entire Reformed tradition to effect regeneration, even in infants who are incapable of faith, by effecting faith which would come to fruition later. However, Reformed theologians do not teach that baptism is necessarily bound to the forgiveness of sins. Not everyone who participates in the outward rite of baptism <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> has had their sins forgiven. Rather, it is necessary that the baptized person participate spiritually by faith in order to receive this benefit.|$|E

5|$|The Judd School sixth form <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> {{have been}} {{established}} as early as 1903in {{the wake of the}} Education Act of 1902when the Pupil Teachers Scheme was born and The Judd School was used a training centre for young teachers. However, normal pupils above the age of 16 were not permitted until 1919; previously special permission from the governors was required to stay on beyond this age. A 1952 government inspection stated that 42 students were in the sixth form. Judd's sixth form has significantly grown over the last decade, consisting of 308 students at the last Ofsted inspection in 2007. A minimum of 40 offers per year will be made to external applicants; girls are admitted in Year Twelve (aged 16) and make up about 16 percent of the sixth form. The sixth form has its own Common Room in the main school building, including a dedicated cafeteria and study area.|$|E
5|$|The Reformed {{tradition}} {{holds that}} baptism is primarily God's promise or offer of grace to the baptized. Baptism {{is said to}} signify union with Christ in his death, burial, and resurrection. The baptized is made one with Christ's person, meaning God the Father treats them the same as he treats Christ. Baptism also unites the baptized with Christ's history, meaning that the person <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> have died, been buried, and raised again just as Christ was. The baptized person's identity in Christ is based on Christ's action in baptism rather than the person's action. This union also unites Christians to one another. Through the words of institution used in baptism, Christians are also united {{to each of the}} members of the trinity.|$|E
5|$|When two proteins' {{distance}} matrices {{share the}} same or similar features in approximately the same positions, they <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> have similar folds with similar-length loops connecting their secondary structure elements. DALI's actual alignment process requires a similarity search after the two proteins' distance matrices are built; this is normally conducted via a series of overlapping submatrices of size 6x6. Submatrix matches are then reassembled into a final alignment via a standard score-maximization algorithm— the original version of DALI used a Monte Carlo simulation to maximize a structural similarity score that {{is a function of}} the distances between putative corresponding atoms. In particular, more distant atoms within corresponding features are exponentially downweighted to reduce the effects of noise introduced by loop mobility, helix torsions, and other minor structural variations. Because DALI relies on an all-to-all distance matrix, it can account for the possibility that structurally aligned features might appear in different orders within the two sequences being compared.|$|E

5|$|Müllerian mimicry, {{named for}} the German naturalist Fritz Müller, {{describes}} a situation where two or more species have similar warning or aposematic signals and both share genuine anti-predation attributes (e.g. being unpalatable). At first, Bates could not explain why this should be so—if both were harmful why did one need to mimic another? Müller put forward the first explanation for this phenomenon: if a common predator confuses two species, individuals in both those species {{are more likely to}} survive. This type of mimicry is unique in several respects. Firstly, both the mimic and the model benefit from the interaction, which could thus be classified as mutualism in this respect. The signal receiver is also advantaged by this system, despite being deceived about species identity, as it avoids potentially harmful encounters. The usually clear distinction between mimic and model is also blurred. Where one species is scarce and another abundant, the rare species <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> be the mimic. When both are present in similar numbers, however, it is more realistic to speak of each as a co-mimic than of distinct 'mimic' and 'model' species, as their warning signals tend to converge. Also, the two species may exist on a continuum from harmless to highly noxious, so Batesian mimicry grades smoothly into Müllerian convergence.|$|E
