5|$|After Malky MacDonald {{took charge}} of two games on a {{caretaker}} basis, Bobby Brown was appointed manager. Brown was the first Scotland manager to be given full control of the team, as until then the SFA selection committee had continued to choose the players. Scotland achieved {{one of their most}} famous victories in his first game in <b>charge,</b> <b>a</b> 3–2 win against 1966 World Cup winners England at Wembley. The team generally performed well under Brown, but were drawn with West Germany in 1970 FIFA World Cup qualification. Scotland needed to avoid defeat in Hamburg to keep their qualification hopes alive, but lost 3–2.|$|E

All were acquitted, as the court ruled their actions had been justified to disperse an illegal gathering.|$|E

5|$|Videoball plays as a {{two-dimensional}} hybrid of air hockey and soccer {{on a single}} screen. Players form two teams of one to three players. Each player uses an analog stick to control a triangle-shaped avatar and presses a single button to shoot triangle-shaped projectiles. The object {{of the game is}} to knock one or more circular balls into the opposing team's goal. Players hold the button to <b>charge</b> <b>a</b> shot, which fires upon release. The projectile can propel the ball, block other projectiles, and incapacitate opponents. Since the shot is triangle-shaped, it can only drive the ball for some distance before the ball veers off-course.|$|E

5|$|During {{the second}} half of the decade, major changes were made to the conductorship of the orchestra. In 2006 Daniel Harding joined Michael Tilson Thomas as {{principal}} guest, and the following year Davis retired as chief conductor and was appointed president of the orchestra, its first since the death of Bernstein in 1990. Davis was succeeded as chief conductor by Valery Gergiev. In Gergiev's first season in <b>charge,</b> <b>a</b> complete cycle of Mahler Symphonies was given, with the Barbican Hall sold out for every concert. In 2009 Davis and the LSO celebrated 50 years of working together. In the same year the LSO took over from the Berlin Philharmonic as the resident orchestra at the Aix-en-Provence Festival, adding to a roster of international residences at venues including the Lincoln Center in New York, the Salle Pleyel in Paris and the Daytona Beach International Festival in Florida. In 2010 the LSO visited Poland and Abu Dhabi for the first time and made its first return to India since the 1964 world tour. The orchestra played at the 2012 Summer Olympics opening ceremony, conducted by Sir Simon Rattle.|$|E
5|$|Franklin's machine used a {{belt and}} pulley system that could be {{operated}} by one person turning a crank. A large pulley {{was attached to the}} crank-handle, and a much smaller pulley was attached to a large glass globe. An iron axle passed through the globe. This allowed the globe to be rotated at high speed. When the crank was turned, the glass globe rubbed against a leather pad, which generated a large static charge, similar to the electrical charge that could be created by rubbing a glass tube with wool cloth by hand. The machine was unique improvement over others made in Europe at the time, as the glass globe could be spun faster with much less labor. A few revolutions of the handle was all that was needed to <b>charge</b> <b>a</b> Leyden jar.|$|E
5|$|Parishes {{arose from}} Church of England divisions, and were {{originally}} purely ecclesiastical divisions. Over time they acquired civil administration powers. The Highways Act 1555 made parishes {{responsible for the}} upkeep of roads. Every adult inhabitant of the parish was obliged to work four days {{a year on the}} roads, providing their own tools, carts and horses; the work was overseen by an unpaid local appointee, the Surveyor of Highways. The poor were looked after by the monasteries, until their dissolution. In 1572, magistrates were given power to 'survey the poor' and impose taxes for their relief. This system was made more formal by the Poor Law Act 1601, which made parishes responsible for administering the Poor Law; overseers were appointed to <b>charge</b> <b>a</b> rate to support the poor of the parish. The 19th century saw an increase in the responsibility of parishes, although the Poor Law powers were transferred to Poor Law Unions. The Public Health Act 1872 grouped parishes into Rural Sanitary Districts, based on the Poor Law Unions; these subsequently formed the basis for Rural Districts. Parishes were run by vestries, meeting annually to appoint officials, and were generally identical to ecclesiastical parishes, although some townships in large parishes administered the Poor Law themselves; under the Parishes Act 1882, all extra-parochial areas and townships that levied a separate rate became independent civil parishes.|$|E

5|$|The guns used three {{different}} charges, {{depending on the}} situation: a full <b>charge,</b> <b>a</b> full flashless charge, and a reduced charge. The standard full charge weighed 15.2–15.5lb (6.9–7.0kg), the flashless charge was slightly heavier at 16lb (7.3kg), and the reduced charge was significantly smaller, at 3.6lb (1.6kg). Both full charges provided a muzzle velocity of 2,600ft/s (790m/s) in new guns, but as continued fire wore down the barrels, muzzle velocity degraded slightly, to 2,500ft/s (760m/s). The reduced charge's muzzle velocity was correspondingly lower, at 1,200ft/s (370m/s). Each gun was supplied with 450 rounds, and was expected to fire 4,600 shells before it was worn enough to warrant replacement. At the maximum effective elevation to engage surface targets, 45degrees, the guns could hit targets up to 17,392yards (15,903m) away. The maximum height at which aircraft could be engaged was 37,200feet (11,900m).|$|E
5|$|Strong {{support from}} fans {{continued}} into the playoffs, as the Penguins sold out their first two home games in 11minutes. The team erected a 12 by 16foot LED screen on the lawn directly outside Mellon Arena, allowing fans to watch all playoff games outside of the stadium, free of <b>charge.</b> <b>A</b> rally scheduled by Allegheny County executive Dan Onorato and Mayor Luke Ravenstahl took place {{in front of the}} Allegheny County Courthouse prior to Game 2 of the team's first-round series on April 11. The Penguins' third game of the playoffs attracted the third-highest regional viewing audience all-time for a Penguins game. The 4,200 tickets offered for the team's first two home games of Round Two sold out within 10minutes. As the playoffs advanced into the later rounds, the team had growing support from players and coaches of other teams in Pittsburgh, including the Steelers and Pirates, and many of the players attended games. Steelers head coach Mike Tomlin watched Game 6 of the Finals outside Mellon Arena, along with 3,000 other fans. Prior to the Stanley Cup Final, Mayor Ravenstahl led a rally in the city's Market Square, which featured chanting by the several hundred people in attendance; cooked octopus was also served by 's Fish Market, in reference to the Detroit tradition of throwing octopi onto the ice. The team also opened up Mellon Arena for fans to watch away games on the JumboTron during the Stanley Cup Final; over 13,500 people attended Game 1. Fans who watched the three games played in Detroit raised over $85,000 for the Mario Lemieux Foundation for cancer research. The Penguins also ranked first in the league in merchandise sales.|$|E

The Christian protestors also clashed with police at St. Sebastian Church in the Permannur area of Ullal {{on the outskirts of}} Mangalore, shouting slogans and throwing stones at the police for their failure to arrest the perpetrators of the attacks. The police arrested several Christians after firing into the air and being involved in a lathi <b>charge.</b> <b>A</b> witness in Permannur claimed that Christians attacked the houses of Hindus in retaliation, shouting slogans against the BJP government. Four people of pro-Hindu organisations were reportedly injured at Kalladka and Attavar {{on the outskirts of the}} Mangalore when their vehicles were attacked and were pelted with stones. Ten people, including one of the Sri Ram Sena activists, were reportedly stabbed during the protests and according to the police, the situation was used by some to settle personal scores and not all stabbing incidents were related to attack on churches and the subsequent violence in the city. The Sri Ram Sena protested against the stabbing of one of their activists by organising a shutdown of educational institutions and shops. The district administration responded by declaring a holiday for all educational institutions in Mangalore taluk, and extended prohibitory orders under the Section 144 Criminal Procedure Code for two more days in the wake of the attacks and protests as a precaution.|$|E
