25|$|Microscopic parasites (like viruses, protozoans {{that cause}} malaria, and others) cannot {{replicate}} on their own. They replicate by invading the hosts' cells, and usurping the <b>cellular</b> <b>machinery</b> to replicate themselves. Eventually, unchecked replication causes the cells to burst, releasing the infectious organisms into the bloodstream. There they spread and infect other cells. As cells die and toxic products of invasive organism replication accumulate, disease symptoms appear.|$|E
25|$|In {{the broad}} sense, most {{chemotherapeutic}} drugs work by impairing mitosis (cell division), effectively targeting fast-dividing cells. As these drugs cause damage to cells, they are termed cytotoxic. They prevent mitosis by various mechanisms including damaging DNA and inhibition of the <b>cellular</b> <b>machinery</b> involved in cell division. One theory {{as to why}} these drugs kill cancer cells is that they induce a programmed form of cell death known as apoptosis.|$|E

40|$|Three <b>cellular</b> <b>machineries</b> — translation, folding or as-sembly, and {{clearance}} — act coordinately {{to maintain}} {{the stability of the}} proteome and to ensure its continuous re-newal under normal conditions (1 – 4). When protein dam-age occurs, these <b>cellular</b> <b>machineries</b> triage to repair damage by either refolding — if possible — or degrading the damaged proteins to prevent the accumulation of these toxic products inside the cell. Consequently, protein homeostasis results from the coordinated action of the quality control systems and the systems that govern each of the different processes that proteins undergo inside cells, including syn-thesis, assembly or disassembly, traffi cking, and transloca-tion to different intracellular compartments.

25|$|In 2013, {{methods for}} {{harnessing}} this system {{for use in}} editing mutations or insertions of specific E. coli sequences were published. This method includes constructing a plasmid consisting of the cas9 gene and CRISPR loci containing the matching target DNA, called single guide RNA (sgRNA). After expression is induced, Cas9 is {{able to identify the}} target DNA sequence of the cellular genome by finding the sgRNA complement and initiate strand breaks in the E. coli genome. This allows a transfected, linear DNA sequence to be incorporated into the genome, relying on the <b>cellular</b> <b>machinery</b> to use the linear DNA flanked by homologous regions specific to the cleaved location as a template to rebuild using homology directed repair.|$|E
25|$|The {{process of}} invading the host cell, {{hijacking}} the <b>cellular</b> <b>machinery,</b> replication and final release {{is a complicated}} set of steps. Very specific proteins coded by the DNA of the infectious organism {{as well as the}} host cells allow those steps to happen. Even a very small change in a critical protein might make infection difficult or impossible. Such changes might arise by a process of mutation in the gene that codes for the protein. If the change is in the gamete, that is, the sperm or egg that join to form a zygote that grows into a human being, the protective mutation will be inherited. Since lethal diseases kill many persons who lack protective mutations, in time, many persons in regions where lethal diseases are endemic come to inherit protective mutations.|$|E
25|$|Viruses often mimic human SLiMs {{to hijack}} and disrupt a host's <b>cellular</b> <b>machinery,</b> thereby adding {{functionality}} to their compact genomes without necessitating new virally encoded proteins. In fact, many motifs were originally discovered in viruses, {{such as the}} Retinoblastoma binding LxCxE motif and the UEV domain binding PTAP late domain. The short generation times and high mutation rates of viruses, in association with natural selection, has led to multiple examples of mimicry of host SLiMs in {{every step of the}} viral life cycle (Src binding motif PxxP in Nef modulates replication, WW domain binding PPxY mediates budding in Ebola virus, A Dynein Light Chain binding motif in Rabies virus is vital for host infection). The extent of human SLiM mimicry is surprising with many viral proteins containing several functional SLiMs, for example, the Adenovirus protein E1A.|$|E

40|$|Eukaryotic {{ribosome}} biogenesis {{requires the}} nuclear import of ∼ 80 nascent ribosomal proteins and {{the elimination of}} excess amounts by the <b>cellular</b> degradation <b>machinery.</b> Assembly chaperones recognize nascent unassembled ribosomal proteins and transport them together with karyopherins to their nuclear destination. We report the crystal structure of ribosomal protein L 4 (RpL 4) bound to its dedicated assembly chaperone of L 4 (Acl 4), revealing extensive interactions sequestering 70 exposed residues of the extended RpL 4 loop. The observed molecular recognition fundamentally differs from canonical promiscuous chaperone–substrate interactions. We demonstrate that the eukaryote-specific RpL 4 extension harbours overlapping binding sites for Acl 4 and the nuclear transport factor Kap 104, facilitating its continuous protection from the <b>cellular</b> degradation <b>machinery.</b> Thus, Acl 4 serves a dual function to facilitate nuclear import and simultaneously protect unassembled RpL 4 from the <b>cellular</b> degradation <b>machinery...</b>|$|R

25|$|Hepatocellular carcinoma, {{like any}} other cancer, {{develops}} {{when there is a}} mutation to the <b>cellular</b> <b>machinery</b> that causes the cell to replicate at a higher rate and/or results in the cell avoiding apoptosis. In particular, chronic infections of hepatitis B and/or C can aid the development of hepatocellular carcinoma by repeatedly causing the body's own immune system to attack the liver cells, some of which are infected by the virus, others merely bystanders. While this constant cycle of damage followed by repair can lead to mistakes during repair which in turn lead to carcinogenesis, this hypothesis is more applicable, at present, to hepatitis C. Chronic hepatitis C causes HCC through the stage of cirrhosis. In chronic hepatitis B, however, the integration of the viral genome into infected cells can directly induce a non-cirrhotic liver to develop HCC. Alternatively, repeated consumption of large amounts of ethanol can have a similar effect. The toxin aflatoxin from certain Aspergillus species of fungus is a carcinogen and aids carcinogenesis of hepatocellular cancer by building up in the liver. The combined high prevalence of rates of aflatoxin and hepatitis B in settings like China and West Africa has led to relatively high rates of hepatocellular carcinoma in these regions. Other viral hepatitides such as hepatitis A have no potential to become a chronic infection and thus are not related to hepatocellular carcinoma.|$|E

Adaptation to use normal <b>cellular</b> <b>machinery</b> to enable transmission and productive infection has also aided the establishment of HIV-2 replication in humans. A survival strategy for any infectious agent is not to kill its host but ultimately become a commensal organism. Having achieved a low pathogenicity, over time, variants more successful at transmission will be selected.|$|E

In this short review, I will discuss recent progress in understanding the pathways followed by animal viruses into cells, and how these studies are also providing novel insights into our understanding of some molecular mechanisms that control endocytic membrane transport...|$|R

500|$|MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are genomically encoded non-coding RNAs {{that help}} {{regulate}} gene expression, particularly during development. The phenomenon of RNA interference, broadly defined, includes the endogenously induced gene silencing effects of miRNAs {{as well as}} silencing triggered by foreign dsRNA. Mature miRNAs are structurally similar to siRNAs produced from exogenous dsRNA, but before reaching maturity, miRNAs must first undergo extensive post-transcriptional modification. A miRNA is expressed from a much longer RNA-coding gene as a primary transcript known as a pri-miRNA which is processed, in the cell nucleus, to a 70-nucleotide stem-loop structure called a pre-miRNA by the microprocessor complex. This complex consists of an RNase III enzyme called Drosha and a dsRNA-binding protein DGCR8. The dsRNA portion of this pre-miRNA is bound and cleaved by Dicer to produce the mature miRNA molecule that can {{be integrated into the}} RISC complex; thus, miRNA and siRNA share the same downstream <b>cellular</b> <b>machinery.</b> First, viral encoded miRNA was described in EBV. Thereafter, an increasing number of microRNAs have been described in viruses.

2500|$|Retrotransposons are DNA {{sequences}} that, once replicated by the <b>cellular</b> <b>machinery,</b> insert {{themselves in}} the genome more or less randomly.

[...] Meiotic-drive alleles have also been shown strongly to reduce individual fitness, clearly exemplifying the potential conflict between selection at different levels.|$|E
2500|$|In {{order to}} replicate, viruses {{introduce}} their genetic material into the host cell, tricking the host's <b>cellular</b> <b>machinery</b> into {{using it as}} blueprints for viral proteins. Retroviruses go a stage further by having their genetic material copied into the genome of the host cell. [...] Scientists exploit this by substituting a virus's genetic material with therapeutic DNA. (The term 'DNA' may be an oversimplification, as some viruses contain RNA, and gene therapy could take this form as well.) A number of viruses {{have been used for}} human gene therapy, including retroviruses, adenoviruses, herpes simplex, vaccinia, and adeno-associated virus. Like the genetic material (DNA or RNA) in viruses, therapeutic DNA can be designed to simply serve as a temporary blueprint that is degraded naturally or (at least theoretically) to enter the host's genome, becoming a permanent part of the host's DNA in infected cells.|$|E

30|$|It {{has been}} {{reported}} that, Aβ peptides are derived from the proteolytic cleavage of APP. Our results from neurosphere lysates (Figure[*] 7) show the expression of full-length humanized APPswe transgene protein and its processed peptides in Tg+ve but not in Tg-ve NS cultures. Presence of C 99 peptides suggests the expression of β-secretase in mouse CNS stem cells and its proteolytic activity on transgene-encoded APPswe protein as reported earlier (Vassar et al. 1999). Presence of Aβ peptides also suggests the proteolysis of APP by γ-secretase of which PSEN 1 {{is one of the}} components.

40|$|As newly {{synthesized}} proteins {{emerge from}} the ribosome, they interact {{with a variety of}} cotranslational <b>cellular</b> <b>machineries</b> that facilitate their proper folding, maturation, and localization. These interactions are essential for proper function of the cell, and the ability to study these events is crucial to understanding cellular protein biogenesis. To this end, we have developed a highly efficient method to generate ribosomenascent chain complexes (RNCs) site-specifically labeled with a fluorescent dye on the nascent polypeptide. The fluorescent RNC provides real-time, quantitative information on its cotranslational interaction with the signal recognition particle and will be a valuable tool in elucidating the role of the translating ribosome in numerous biochemical pathways...|$|R
2500|$|Mixing {{also plays}} an {{important}} role in the limitation of primary production by nutrients. [...] Inorganic nutrients, such as nitrate, phosphate and silicic acid are necessary for phytoplankton to synthesise their cells and <b>cellular</b> <b>machinery.</b> [...] Because of gravitational sinking of particulate material (such as plankton, dead or fecal material), nutrients are constantly lost from the photic zone, and are only replenished by mixing or upwelling of deeper water. [...] This is exacerbated where summertime solar heating and reduced winds increases vertical stratification and leads to a strong thermocline, since this makes it more difficult for wind mixing to entrain deeper water. [...] Consequently, between mixing events, primary production (and the resulting processes that leads to sinking particulate material) constantly acts to consume nutrients in the mixed layer, and in many regions this leads to nutrient exhaustion and decreased mixed layer production in the summer (even in the presence of abundant light). [...] However, as long as the photic zone is deep enough, primary production may continue below the mixed layer where light-limited growth rates mean that nutrients are often more abundant.|$|E
2500|$|An {{alternative}} theory, {{proposed by}} Thomas Cavalier-Smith, was labeled the Neomuran revolution. The designation [...] "Neomuran revolution" [...] {{refers to the}} appearances of the common ancestors of eukaryotes and archaea. Cavalier-Smith proposes that the first neomurans emerged 850 million years ago. Other molecular biologists assume that this group appeared much earlier, but Cavalier-Smith dismisses these claims because {{they are based on}} the [...] "theoretically and empirically" [...] unsound model of molecular clocks. Cavalier-Smith's theory of the Neomuran revolution has implications for the evolutionary history of the <b>cellular</b> <b>machinery</b> for recombination and sex. It suggests that this machinery evolved in two distinct bouts separated by a long period of stasis; first the appearance of recombination machinery in a bacterial ancestor which was maintained for 3 Gy, until the neomuran revolution when the mechanics were adapted to the presence of nucleosomes. The archaeal products of the revolution maintained recombination machinery that was essentially bacterial, whereas the eukaryotic products broke with this bacterial continuity. They introduced cell fusion and ploidy cycles into cell life histories. Cavalier-Smith argues that both bouts of mechanical evolution were motivated by similar selective forces: the need for accurate DNA replication without loss of viability.|$|E
