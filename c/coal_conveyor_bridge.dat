5000|$|F60 is {{the series}} {{designation}} of five overburden <b>conveyor</b> <b>bridges</b> used in brown coal (lignite) opencast mining in the Lusatian coalfields in Germany. They were {{built by the}} former Volkseigener Betrieb TAKRAF in Lauchhammer and are the largest movable technical industrial machines in the world. As overburden <b>conveyor</b> <b>bridges,</b> they transport the overburden which lies over the coal seam. The cutting height is 60 m, hence the name F60. With a length of 502 m, it is described as the lying Eiffel tower. In total, the F60 is up to 80 m high and 240 m wide. In operating condition, it weighs 13,600 metric tons. The first <b>conveyor</b> <b>bridge</b> was built from 1969 to 1972, being equipped with a feeder bridge in 1977. The second was built from 1972 to 1974, having been equipped with a feeder bridge during construction. The third <b>conveyor</b> <b>bridge</b> was built from 1976 to 1978, being provided with a feeder bridge in 1985. The fourth and fifth <b>conveyor</b> <b>bridges</b> were built 1986-1988 and 1988-1991 respectively.|$|R

50|$|While some coal is {{delivered}} {{directly to the}} hopper feeding the <b>coal</b> <b>conveyor</b> which brings fuel into the plant, Simon also has extensive outdoor storage, both covered and uncovered. Front-end loaders are used {{in this part of}} the operation.|$|R
5000|$|A <b>conveyor</b> <b>bridge</b> is a {{piece of}} mining {{equipment}} used in strip mining for the removal of overburden and for dumping it on the inner spoil bank of the open-cut mine. It is used together with multibucket excavators, frequently bucket chain excavators, that remove the overburden which is moved to the <b>bridge</b> by connecting <b>conveyors.</b> <b>Conveyor</b> <b>bridges</b> are used in working horizontally layered deposits with soft overburden rock in areas where mean annual temperatures are above freezing. They are frequently used in lignite mining.|$|R

50|$|On November 21, 1976 41-year-old Chicago {{firefighter}} Walter Watroba {{lost his}} life after being pinned for seven hours by a fallen coal chute. Watroba died {{shortly after his}} leg was amputated in order to extricate him. Three hundred firefighters had responded to a fire that started at Throop Street where a <b>coal</b> chute <b>conveyor</b> emerged from an underground passage. The fire spread along the <b>coal</b> <b>conveyor</b> to a control room, switch house, boiler and turbine buildings and caused $8 million in damages.|$|R
50|$|Another {{occupation}} {{inspired by}} Pakaitore began on 26 April 1995 in Huntly, a coal mining town south of Auckland. The block of land sits atop a hill overlooking the town, {{in full view}} of the mine entrance with its <b>coal</b> <b>conveyor</b> leading to a power station.|$|R
5000|$|January 2007: The Department of Conservation {{hearing on}} 30-31 January 2007, to hear {{submissions}} on Mighty River's plans {{to put a}} <b>coal</b> <b>conveyor</b> belt across conservation land. Greenpeace, community groups and individuals made submissions at the hearing. Over 1,400 written submissions were received by DOC and almost all opposed the plan.|$|R
5000|$|The first <b>conveyor</b> <b>bridge</b> {{was built}} in Plessa lignite mine Agnes {{according}} to plans of mine director Friedrich von Delius. It was scrapped in 1959 after exposure of clay beds made mining in the pit unsafe.|$|R
5000|$|A <b>conveyor</b> <b>bridge</b> {{consists}} of girders resting on {{two or three}} supports mounted on rails, or sometimes on crawler tracks. The bridge is set across the pit and moves along the mining face at a few metres per minute. If it runs on rails, the tracks are shifted {{in accordance with the}} progress of the mining. The rock is moved from the excavator to the <b>bridge</b> by connecting <b>conveyors.</b> The dumping support of a <b>conveyor</b> <b>bridge</b> may rest on the soil of the seam or on a dumping mound specially poured and packed by the bridge itself, depending on the stability of the rock.|$|R

5000|$|A large <b>conveyor</b> <b>bridge</b> with 200 m span and 50 m height, fed by a bucket-wheel excavator, was {{completed}} in 1930 in the Böhlen lignite mine. After it was toppled by a storm in 1937, a replacement went into service in 1939.|$|R
50|$|Tours are self-guided. Here, modern glass {{escalators}} {{replaced the}} former <b>coal</b> <b>conveyors</b> between the floors. In {{order to have}} a good overview of the machinery in the huge hall, a podium is hanged at 12 m height, which leads the visitors to the control room. After the control room, the tour route returns to the entrance by way of the turbine hall floor.|$|R
50|$|The {{site was}} {{converted}} into a parcels depot which opened on 6 July 1970. Royal Mail constructed a sorting office {{on the opposite side}} of the main line and connected it to Mayfield with an overhead <b>conveyor</b> <b>bridge</b> which crossed the throat of Piccadilly Station. The depot closed in 1986 following the decision by Parcelforce, Royal Mail's parcels division, to abandon rail transport in favour of road haulage. The building has remained disused ever since, with the tracks into Mayfield removed in 1989 as part of the remodelling of the Piccadilly Station layout. The sorting office was briefly reused as an indoor karting track, but has now been rebuilt as the Square One development, prestige offices used by Network Rail; the parcel <b>conveyor</b> <b>bridge</b> was removed in 2003.|$|R
50|$|The only {{surviving}} structure {{from the}} Tooele smelter site is an ore <b>conveyor</b> <b>bridge,</b> which was dismantled and rebuilt into a sky bridge at the Trolley Square mall in Salt Lake City. The bridge passes over 600 South, {{with a small}} informational placard near it in the mall detailing its history.|$|R
50|$|The {{overburden}} <b>conveyor</b> <b>bridge</b> of Lichterfeld-Schacksdorf, now shut down, {{was used}} from 1991 until 1992 {{in the brown}} coal mine Klettwitz-Nord near Klettwitz. It is open for visitors today as a project of the Internationale Bauausstellung Fürst-Pückler-Land (International Mining Exhibition Fürst-Pückler-Land) and is an anchor of the European Route of Industrial Heritage (ERIH).|$|R
50|$|Only {{from the}} 1920s {{on the village}} {{developed}} into an industrial location, mainly due to the lignite found in the area. In 1924 {{one of the largest}} lignite mines in the world of its time was opened west of Böhlen. It was equipped with a <b>conveyor</b> <b>bridge</b> of 200 m length and 50 m height.|$|R

50|$|Between 2000 and 2010, the Internationale Bauausstellung Fürst-Pückler-Land is {{pursuing}} {{the goal of}} giving new momentum to {{the region and the}} former opencast mine of Klettwitz-Nord has also been integrated into that concept. The mine has been converted into a 'visitors' mine' and the <b>conveyor</b> <b>bridge</b> has been accessible since 1998. Various sound and light installations help make the facility an attraction for visitors.|$|R
50|$|Another {{prominent}} {{feature of}} Trolley Square is the sky bridge {{that connects the}} main building to a small parking lot located across the street. The bridge was made from a salvaged ore <b>conveyor</b> <b>bridge</b> formerly in use at the International Smelting and Refining Company facility in Tooele, Utah. The bridge goes over 600 South, and it features neon lights shaped {{in the form of}} a trolley.|$|R
50|$|Between 1969 and 1991, TAKRAF built five {{very large}} <b>conveyor</b> <b>bridges</b> {{of the type}} F60 of which four are still in {{operation}} in lignite mines in Lower Lusatia, and one has been preserved as a visitor attraction. These were constructed for removing overburden up to 60 m thick, are 502 m long and span 204 m. They could move originally up to 23000 m3/h, with additional excavators up to 34600 m3/h.|$|R
50|$|Bold A and B Power Stations were coal fired, with {{a direct}} <b>coal</b> <b>conveyor</b> belt link from a washery at the colliery. This fed either {{directly}} to coal bunkers in both stations or to a stocking area. The extensive rail sidings were utilised for coal delivery, either from Bold Colliery or from other collieries via the main Liverpool to Manchester Lines. The coal from Bold Colliery was deep mined and therefore costly to recover. In later years, due to commercial reasons, the main coal supply became mostly by road from either Yorkshire or Scotland.|$|R
50|$|For {{cogeneration}} Units 1-5, {{in typical}} operation a <b>coal</b> <b>conveyor</b> delivers <b>coal</b> to a scale, {{where it is}} separated into 200-pound batches before being sent to a pulverizer. The coal powder is delivered pneumatically to boilers and burned to heat water in a steam generator. Superheated steam at 900 psi is initially used to drive a turbine/generator, emerging at 90 psi for distribution to campus buildings through a system of tunnels. Steam condensate is returned from campus to the plant via the same tunnels to be cleaned and reused.|$|R
50|$|In 1954, a {{major fire}} at South Fremantle in the <b>coal</b> <b>conveyor</b> from the crusher house caused {{structural}} damage {{and resulted in}} a switch to oil fuel for the boilers. In the mid 1970s the plant was converted back to coal, which fuelled the station until its closure in 1985. By the 1980s production of electricity at South Fremantle had become uneconomical. The interconnected grid then was supplying electricity from power stations with more up-to-date machinery {{and closer to the}} coal source at Collie, Bunbury, Kwinana and Muja.|$|R
