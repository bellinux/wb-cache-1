5|$|Conceptual {{design of}} a {{permanent}} repository was determined by 1983, calling for placement of <b>copper-clad</b> iron canisters in granite bedrock about 500 metres underground, below the water table in {{what is known as}} the KBS-3 method. Space around the canisters will be filled with bentonite clay. After examining six possible locations for a permanent repository, three were nominated for further investigation, at Osthammar, Oskarshamn, and Tierp. On 3 June 2009, Swedish Nuclear Fuel and Waste Co. chose a location for a deep-level waste site at Östhammar, near Forsmark Nuclear Power plant. The application to build the repository was handed in by SKB 2011.|$|E
5|$|The {{building}} was substantially altered in 1835 by architect Sydney Smirke. In {{order to provide}} more space, he added blocks {{at either end of}} the frontage, and galleried wings on either side of the central portion. He also added a small single-storey lodge, still in existence, at the Lambeth Road gate. Later, between 1844–46, the central cupola was replaced with a <b>copper-clad</b> dome in order to expand the chapel beneath. The building also featured a theatre in a building to the rear of the site.|$|E
25|$|In 1836, the old lead-covered roof, {{with its}} complex {{structure}} of timber supports (known as 'the forest') {{was destroyed by}} fire. It was replaced with a <b>copper-clad</b> roof supported by a network of cast iron ribs, known as the Charpente de fer. At the time, the framework over the crossing had the largest span of any iron framed construction in Europe.|$|E
50|$|The 2.3 acre site, {{where the}} Islamic Foundation {{currently}} stands, was purchased in 1984. At the time, {{an elementary school}} was also conceived {{as an integral part}} of the Foundation. The majestic three-storied building in its current form, made from white stone, was completed in 1992 at a cost of about six million dollars, almost all of which was raised by the local Muslim community. A 125 ft tall minaret captures the skyline, complemented by a <b>copper-cladded</b> dome, symbolizing the Muslim presence in Canada. The building is 53000 sq ft. in area, with prayer halls for men and women, 12 well-equipped classrooms, a cafeteria and kitchen, a gymnasium, a library, a mortuary, wide and bright corridors, an elevator and over 200 parking spaces.|$|R

This is an {{open access}} article {{distributed}} under the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited. A CPW-fed ultra-wideband antenna was designed. The antenna was etched on a single-layer <b>copper-cladding</b> substrate, of which the material was FR 4 with relative permittivity of 4. 4, and the magnitude was 40. 0 mm × 50. 0 mm × 1. 6 mm. The parameters of the antenna are simulated and optimized with HFSS. This paper proposes a new trapezoidal CPW-fed UWB antenna that the bandwidth (return loss ≤ − 10 dB) covers 2. 7 - 9. 3 GHz range, which means a relative bandwidth of 110 % with good radiation patterns and gain. Simulated and measured results for return loss, radiation pattern and gain were presented. A good agreement has been obtained between the simulation and experiment and the proposed antenna meets {{the requirements of the}} ultra-wideband antenna...|$|R
40|$|It is {{well known}} that {{magnetite}} builds on the outside of boiler and steam generator tubes. Low-frequency (10 kiloHertz) eddy-current testing (ECT) has been used in attempts to quantify magnetite deposits on alloy 600 steam generator tubes. At this frequency, ECT has some sensitivity to the presence of magnetite {{on the outside of the}} tube with measurements made inside the tube. However, it has been historically impossible to resolve differences in deposit thickness, a quantity of some interest to power plant operators. ECT can be further inhibited by layers of copper which may be deposited on the outer surface of Inconel tubing. AC magnetics (ACM) may be conveniently operated at a few hundred Hertz where the small thicknesses of Inconel and the copper deposits are essentially transparent to the electromagnetic fields. The problem then becomes detection of magnetite at large lift off. Here again, ACM is a good technique to use. Preparatory to the design of an ACM probe to fit within steam generator tubing, a feasibility study was conducted which is described here. Flat <b>copper-cladded</b> Inconel plates were used to simulate the tubing, and magnetite of various thicknesses were placed on the side opposite a magnetic-circuit gap. The results indicate that the depth of magnetite through Inconel and copper can be quantified through the use of ACM to about 10 mm...|$|R
25|$|The D-17B weighed {{approximately}} , contained 1,521 transistors, 6,282 diodes, 1,116 capacitors, and 504 resistors. These {{components were}} mounted on double <b>copper-clad,</b> engraved, gold-plated, glass fiber laminate circuit boards. There were 75 of these circuit boards {{and each one}} was coated with a flexible polyurethane compound for moisture and vibration protection. The high degree of reliability and ruggedness of the computer were driven by the strict requirements of the weapons system.|$|E
25|$|The large main waiting room, {{with its}} floral and Greek Revival motifs in tiled stained glass by Louis Comfort Tiffany set atop bands of pale cement, is {{generally}} {{considered one of the}} finest in the U.S. aesthetically. The terminal exterior extends to over four stories and has a distinguished <b>copper-clad</b> façade with ornate detailing. Its single-story base is constructed of rusticated Indiana limestone. A grand double stair with decorative cast-iron railings within the main waiting room provides an entrance to the upper-level ferry concourse.|$|E
25|$|Multi-layer {{printed circuit}} boards have trace layers inside the board. This is {{achieved}} by laminating a stack of materials in a press by applying pressure and heat {{for a period of}} time. This results in an inseparable one piece product. For example, a four-layer PCB can be fabricated by starting from a two-sided <b>copper-clad</b> laminate, etch the circuitry on both sides, then laminate to the top and bottom pre-preg and copper foil. It is then drilled, plated, and etched again to get traces on top and bottom layers.|$|E
25|$|Initially PCBs were {{designed}} manually {{by creating a}} photomask on a clear mylar sheet, usually at two or four times the true size. Starting from the schematic diagram the component pin pads were {{laid out on the}} mylar and then traces were routed to connect the pads. Rub-on dry transfers of common component footprints increased efficiency. Traces were made with self-adhesive tape. Pre-printed non-reproducing grids on the mylar assisted in layout. To fabricate the board, the finished photomask was photolithographically reproduced onto a photoresist coating on the blank <b>copper-clad</b> boards.|$|E
25|$|Electrical wiring {{distributes}} {{electric power}} inside residential, commercial, or industrial buildings, mobile homes, recreational vehicles, boats, and substations at voltages up to 600 V. The {{thickness of the}} wire is based on amperage requirements in conjunction with safe operating temperatures. Solid wire is used for smaller diameters; thicker diameters are stranded to provide flexibility. Conductor types include non-metallic/non-metallic corrosion-resistant cable (two or more insulated conductors with a nonmetallic outer sheath), armored or BX cable (cables are surrounded by a flexible metal enclosure), metal clad cable, service entrance cable, underground feeder cable, TC cable, fire resistant cable, and mineral insulated cable, including mineral-insulated <b>copper-clad</b> cable. Copper is commonly used for building wire because of its conductivity, strength, and reliability. Over {{the life of a}} building wire system, copper can also be the most economical conductor.|$|E
500|$|Vice Admiral of the White Mariot Arbuthnot, the British fleet {{commander}} in North America, {{was aware that}} Destouches was planning something, but did not learn of Destouches' sailing until 10 March, and immediately led his fleet out of Gardiner Bay in pursuit. [...] He had the speed advantage of <b>copper-clad</b> vessels and a favourable wind, and reached Cape Henry on 16 March, slightly ahead of Destouches.|$|E
500|$|De Tilley's expedition, and {{the strong}} {{encouragement}} of General Washington, who traveled to Newport to press the case, convinced Destouches to make a larger commitment. [...] On March 8 he sailed with his entire fleet (7 ships {{of the line and}} several frigates, including the recently captured Romulus), carrying French troops to join with Lafayette's in Virginia. [...] Admiral Arbuthnot, alerted to his departure, sailed on March 10 after sending Arnold a dispatch warning of the French movement. [...] Arbuthnot, whose <b>copper-clad</b> ships could sail faster than those of Destouches, reached Cape Henry on March 16, just ahead of the French fleet. [...] The ensuing battle was largely indecisive, but left Arbuthnot free to enter Lynnhaven Bay and control access to Chesapeake Bay; Destouches returned to Newport. [...] Lafayette saw the British fleet, and pursuant to orders, made preparations to return his troops to the New York area. [...] By early April he had returned to Head of Elk, where he received orders from Washington to stay in Virginia.|$|E
500|$|On 8 January 1780 {{ships from}} Rodney's fleet spotted {{a group of}} sails. [...] Giving chase with their faster <b>copper-clad</b> ships, the British {{determined}} these to be a Spanish supply convoy that was protected by a single ship {{of the line and}} several frigates. [...] The entire convoy was captured, with the lone ship of the line, Guipuzcoana, striking her colours after a perfunctory exchange of fire. Guipuzcoana was staffed with a small prize crew and renamed , in honour of Prince William, the third son of the King, who was serving as midshipman in the fleet. [...] Rodney then detached [...] and the frigate [...] to escort most of the captured ships back to England; Prince William was added to his fleet, as were some of the supply ships that carried items likely to be of use to the Gibraltar garrison.

On the top floor was the Oregon Supreme Court with a courtroom measuring 54 by 45 feet (16 by 14 m) and the Oregon State Law Library, 75 by 70 feet (23 by 21 m). Also {{on the top floor}} was a viewing gallery for the House. [...] On the exterior were ornamental pilasters and two-story porticos on the east and west ends. The building included a lunch counter. Additionally, the building had mullion-windowed wings. The large <b>copper-clad</b> dome was constructed with an iron and steel framework. This dome rose [...] above the rest of the building and was [...] tall. The building was of Renaissance style with Corinthian columns on the front entrance and was patterned after the United States Capitol. At that time, the capitol faced west toward the Willamette River. The government began using the building in August 1876, before the dome was built. Originally, plans called for towers {{on both sides of the}} dome (a tower on both ends of the building with the dome in the middle), but they were left out to save money. Oregon's second capitol building stood from 1876 to 1935.|$|E

2500|$|As {{automobile}} traffic through the square increased during the 1920s, motorists called the building a hazard to navigation. In February 1928, the Boston Elevated Railway demolished the 1912-built headhouse {{and replaced it}} with a lower rectangular brick structure with a <b>copper-clad</b> roof. There is debate about the relative contributions to the design by [...] Boston architect Clarence H. Blackall and MIT civil engineering professor, Charles B. Breed; there also was input from Boston Elevated Railway officials, mayor Edward W. Quinn, the Harvard Square Business Men's Association, and the Public Utilities Commission. The new headhouse, featuring three walls of brick, limestone, and mullion-framed glass windows on three sides, cost around $20,000, of which the city paid $15,000.|$|E
2500|$|The actual wire {{employed}} in voice coil winding {{is almost always}} copper, with an electrical insulation coating, and in some cases, an adhesive overcoat. Copper wire provides an easily manufactured, general purpose voice coil, at a reasonable cost. Where maximum sensitivity or extended high frequency response is required from a loudspeaker, aluminium wire may be substituted, to reduce the moving mass of the coil. While rather delicate in a manufacturing environment, aluminium wire has about {{one third of the}} mass of the equivalent gauge of copper wire, and has about two-thirds of the electrical conductivity. <b>Copper-clad</b> aluminium wire is occasionally used, allowing easier winding, along with a useful reduction in coil mass compared to copper.|$|E

About [...] (scale miles, actually [...] ) of mainline track are on this massive layout, as well as over 500 hand-made turnouts. Many models of local San Diego structures can be identified on the layout, including an intricate scale model of San Diego's Santa Fe Depot, the Western Metal Supply Building, the Carrizo Gorge's Goat Canyon Trestle, Palomar Observatory, the American Agar building, and the Carlsbad, California flower fields and power plant. The model of the Santa Fe depot was constructed using the actual building's blueprints and has been featured on the cover of Model Railroader magazine. The Spanish revival architecture is reproduced using epoxy castings of scale model adobe roof tiles. The Western Metal Supply Building (now part of the left field foul line in the San Diego Padres' Petco Park) was constructed using historic photographs and contains brick castings, brass-etched fire escapes, and computer-generated window panes. The detail on the Goat Canyon Trestle includes the prototype's railings, catwalks, and fire suppression system. The power plant contains fibre-optic strobe lights in its chimney. Many buildings have detailed interiors, right down to the napkin dispenser and placemats on the tables at the corner cafe. Some surfers appear in the water off the coast. The layout can be operated by manual or computer control. Trains can run completely unattended or a single operator can control the layout with the click of a mouse.|$|E
60|$|Early dawn {{began to}} break. The sky {{was clear and}} cloudless. The Tatars were on their walls, the Russians in their trenches; the Imperial eagle standard, which Ivan had lately assumed, floated in the morning wind. The two armies were {{perfectly}} silent, save here and there the bray of a single trumpet, or beat of a naker drum in one or the other, and the continuous hum of the hymns and chants from the three Russian chapel- tents. The archers held their arrows on the string, the gunners stood with lighted matches. The <b>copper-clad</b> domes of the minarets began to glow with the rising sunbeams; the muezzins were on the roofs about to call the Moslemin to prayer; the deacon in the Tzar's chapel-tent was reading the Gospel. 'There shall be one fold and one Shepherd.' At that moment the sun's disk appeared above the eastern hills, and ere yet the red orb had fully mounted above the horizon, there was a burst as it were of tremendous thunderings, and the ground shook beneath the church. The Tzar went to the entrance, and found the whole city hill so 'rolled in sable smoke', that he could distinguish nothing, and, going back to his place, desired that the service should continue. The deacon {{was in the midst}} of the prayer for the establishment of the power of the Tzar and the discomfiture of his enemies, when the crushing burst of another explosion rushed upon their ears, and as it died away another voice broke forth, the shout raised by every man in the Russian lines, 'God is with us!' On then they marched towards the openings that the mines had made, but there the dauntless garrison, in spite of the terror and destruction caused by the two explosions, met them with unabated fury, rolling beams or pouring boiling water upon them as they strove to climb the breach, and fighting hand to hand with them if they mounted it. However, by the time the Tzar had completed his devotions and mounted his horse, his eagle could be seen above the smoke upon the citadel.|$|E
