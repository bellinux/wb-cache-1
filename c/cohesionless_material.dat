40|$|Graduation date: 1969 Combinations of {{cohesive}} and cohesionless {{soils are}} often encountered when evaluating the engineering properties of soils. The stress-volume {{characteristics of the}} mixed soil are found to {{vary according to the}} proportion of each component. If the cohesive soil composes more than a certain fraction of the material, the magnitude of volume change for a stress increment will be a function of the compressibility of the cohesive soil. When the amount of cohesive material is less than this fraction, volume change is controlled by the behavior of the <b>cohesionless</b> <b>material.</b> Two methods have gained wide acceptance for predicting the behavior of soil mixtures. If more than 50 percent of the material is fine grained, the Unified Classification System defines the behavior of the system by the characteristics of the fine grained material. The American Association for State Highway Officials requires 35 percent or more fine grained material to define fine grained behavior. The purpose of this investigation was to establish a method for predicting the compressional characteristics of a mixture controlled by cohesive materials and to determine the percentage at which the cohesionless soil began to control the behavior. The two sized system was first investigated theoretically. Relationships were established for predicting the behavior of the mixture in one dimensional consolidation and for determining the point of control by the cohesionless component. The validity of the theoretical approach was established by performing a laboratory investigation. The program included nine consolidation tests on specimens with varying proportions of sand and clay. The results of the laboratory investigation indicated that the theoretical relationship for calculating the compressional characteristics was valid if the percentage of sand was less than 65 percent of the total weight of solids. Above 65 percent sand the <b>cohesionless</b> <b>material</b> dominated the behavior of the system making the theoretical relationship invalid...|$|E

Despite the importance of gravity flow, there is debate within the literature about the influence that the height of draw, particle size and particle size distribution has on the geometry of extraction and movement zones. This paper {{presents the results of}} an experimental programme conducted in the largest three-dimensional (3 D) physical model to investigate the mechanisms of flow of <b>cohesionless</b> <b>materials</b> when drawing from a single drawpoint. Experimental results showed that isolated draw zones are mainly influenced by mass drawn and height of draw. Particle size was found to have a slight effect on extraction zones and no significant effect on movement zone width. Particle size composition (wide or narrow distributions) and drawpoint width were found not to have a major role on drawzone geometry. Those conclusions were based on statistical analysis of experimental data to define the controlling parameters in isolated draw. Model theory principles were used to investigate within the physical modelling framework the possibility of directly scaling the geometry of the extraction zones, which indicated that flow zones could be scaled in <b>cohesionless</b> <b>materials</b> under a set of assumptions.

Surface and underground observations are confirmed through detailed study of borehole cores sampled from granitic and gneissic bodies and drilled perpendicular to the fault structure. Subsequent geophysical logging in these boreholes show that increases in tectonic deformation, as seen in the fault sequence, results in a decrease in g-radiation and P-wave velocity. These decreases can be associated with increasing porosities and fracture densities in the host rock masses.

The purpose of this work was to assess the applicability to tailings dams of two CPT-based liquefaction assessment methodologies, namely, the Robertsonbased and the Olson and Stark methodologies.

When considering triggering of liquefaction, the Robertson-based and Olson and Stark methodologies correctly predicted the behaviour of four out of five and seven out of ten case histories, respectively. When considering the onset of flow failure, the Olson and Stark methodology correctly predicted the behaviour in four of seven case histories for which a post-triggering analysis was made.

40|$|Experimental results {{obtained}} {{in a series}} of displacement controlled oedometric tests on soft rocks are presented. Four different materials characterised by a high void ratio have been examined; three natural soft rocks and an artificial one. The materials under investigation were conchyliates stone, calcarenite, pumice stone and Gasbeton. In order to monitor the stress path as well, a soft oedometer ring was designed and constructed for the measurement of the radial stresses. The observed behaviour can be divided in three phases. After an initial phase in which the mechanical response is essentially elastic, a second phase starts, in which bonds are progressively broken, so that in the axial stress-strain curve a stress decrease is recorded and in some cases, a sort of 'curl'appears in the stress path. This is associated to the occurrence of strain non-homogeneities in the form of compaction bands. In the final part of the experiment the axial stress increases exponentially and the stress path returns to be linear, as the one expected for a <b>cohesionless</b> <b>material.</b> The experimental behaviour is reproduced by means of an elastoplastic strain-hardening/softening constitutive model and the occurrence of compaction bands is theoretically predicted. © 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd...|$|E

40|$|Morphologic {{analysis}} of scarp degradation {{can be used}} quantitatively to determine relative ages of different scarps formed in <b>cohesionless</b> <b>materials,</b> under the same climatic conditions. Scarps of tectonic origin as well as wavecut or rivercut terraces can be treated as topographic impulses that are attenuated by surface erosional processes. This morphological evolution can be modelled as the convolution of the initial shape with erosion (or degradation) function whose width increases with time. Such modeling applies well to scarps less than 10 m high, formed in unconsolidated fanglomerates. To a good approximation, the degradation function is Gaussian with a variance measuring the degree of rounding of the initial shape. This geometric parameter can be called the degradation coefficient. A synthetic experiment shows that the degradation coefficient {{can be obtained by}} least squares fitting of profiles levelled perpendicular to the scarp. Gravitational collapse of the free face is accounted for by assuming initial scarp slopes at the angle of repose of the <b>cohesionless</b> <b>materials</b> (30 °– 35 °). Uncertainties in the measured profiles result in an uncertainty in degradation coefficient that can be evaluated graphically. Because the degradation coefficient is sensitive to the regional slope and to three-dimensional processes (gullying, loess accumulation, stream incision, etc.), a reliable and accurate determination of degradation coefficient requires several long profiles across the same scarp. The linear diffusion model of scarp degradation is a Gaussian model in which the degradation coefficient is proportional to numerical age. In that case, absolute dating requires only determination of the propotionality constant, called the mass diffusivity constant. For Holocene scarps a few meters high, in loose alluvium under arid climatic conditions, mass diffusivity constants generally range between 1 and 6 m^ 2 /kyr. Morphologic analysis is a reliable method to compare ages of different scarps in a given area, and it can provide approximate absolute ages of Holocene scarplike landforms...|$|R
40|$|This work {{shows that}} {{toughness}} (resistance) to fracture propagation is an inherent characteristic of <b>cohesionless</b> particulate <b>materials,</b> which is significant for understanding hydraulic fracturing in geotechnical, geological, and petroleum applications. We have developed experimental techniques {{to quantify the}} initiation and propagation of fluid-driven fractures in saturated particulate materials. The fracturing liquid is injected into particulate materials, where the fluid flow is localized in thin crack-like conduits. By analogy, we call them 'cracks' or 'hydraulic fractures'. Based on the laboratory observations and scale analysis, this work offers physical concepts to explain the observed phenomena. When a fracture propagates in a solid, new surfaces are created by breaking material bonds. Consequently, the material is in tension at the fracture tip. In contrast, {{all parts of the}} <b>cohesionless</b> particulate <b>material</b> (including the tip zone of hydraulic fracture) are likely to be in compression. In solid materials, the fluid front lags behind the front of the propagating fracture, while the lag zone is absent for fluid-driven fractures in <b>cohesionless</b> <b>materials.</b> The compressive stress state and the absence of the fluid lag are important characteristics of hydraulic fracturing in particulate materials with low, or no, cohesion. Our experimental results show that the primary factor affecting peak (initiation) pressure is the magnitude of the remote stresses. The morphology of fracture and fluid leak-off zone, however, changes significantly not only with stresses, but also with other parameters such as flow rate, fluid rheology, and permeability. Typical features of the observed fractures are multiple off-shots and the bluntness of the fracture tip. This suggests the importance of inelastic deformation in the process of fracture propagation in <b>cohesionless</b> <b>materials.</b> Similar to solid materials, fractures propagated perpendicular to the least compressive stress. However, peak injection pressures are significantly greater than the maximum principle stresses in the experiments. Further, by incorporating the dominate experimental parameters into dimensionless form; a reasonable power-law fit is achieved between a dimensionless peak injection pressure and dimensionless stress. Scaling indicates that there is a high pressure gradient in the leak-off zone in the direction normal to the fracture. Fluid pressure does not decrease considerably along the fracture, however, due to the relatively wide fracture aperture. This suggests that hydraulic fractures in unconsolidated materials propagate within the toughness-dominated regime. Furthermore, the theoretical model of toughness-dominated hydraulic fracturing can be matched to the experimental pressure-time dependences with only one fitting parameter. Scale analysis shows that large apertures at the fracture tip correspond to relatively large 'effective' fracture (surface) energy, which can be orders of magnitude greater than typical for hard rocks.

40|$|The Discrete Element Method (DEM) {{is applied}} to predict draft forces of a simple {{implement}} in cohesionless granular material. Results are compared with small-scale laboratory tests in which the horizontal force is measured at a straight blade. This study {{is focused on the}} case of <b>cohesionless</b> <b>material</b> under quasi-static conditions. The DEM requires the calibration of the local contact parameters between particles to adjust the bulk material properties. The most important bulk property is the angle of internal friction. In the DEM, the shear resistance is limited in the case of spherical particles due to excessive particle rotations. This is cured by retaining rotations of the particles. Although this is known to prevent the material from developing shear bands, the model still turns out to be capable of predicting the reaction force on the blade. In contrast to empirical formulas for this kind of application, the DEM model can easily be extended to more complex tool ge ometries and trajectories. This study helps to find a simple and numerically efficient setup for the numerical model, capable of predicting draft forces correctly and so allowing for large-scale industrial simulations...|$|E
40|$|Soil can roughly be {{classified}} into cohesionless, cohesive, and cemented soil. In this contribution, a discrete element {{model for the}} simulation of cohesive soil is presented. It {{is based on a}} model for <b>cohesionless</b> <b>material</b> with spherical particles, normal repulsive and frictional contacts, as well as rolling resistance with an elastic limit to compensate the excessive particle rolling. The cohesive behavior is modeled by an additional attractive normal force between particles. The model is not derived from one of the microscopic origins of cohesion, such as liquid bridges or electrostatic forces. Instead, it is set up in analogy to the macroscopic shear failure characteristics of cohesive soil. The model is stress history dependent. By that, the amount of cohesion is limited by the pressure that contacting particles have experienced {{during the course of the}} simulation. The discrete element model is shown to be scale invariant in the quasi-static regime, i. e. if all lengths of the model are scaled, the results remain unaffected by the scaling. The model is applied to a small-scale laboratory test and an excavator digging in natural cohesive soil. The contact parameters are calibrated by simulated triaxial compression tests.

With this assumption, the direction of plastic how is uniquely related to eta, irrespective of the material internal state. This obviously contradicts the facts. Consider two specimens of the same sand, one is in a loose state and the other in a dense state. Subjected to a loading from the same eta, the loose specimen contracts and the dense one dilates. These two distinctly different responses are associated with a single eta but two different values of dilatancy, one positive and the other negative.

The present investigation also examines the fundamental interface mechanism and attempts to define the associated rupture zones in <b>cohesionless</b> <b>material</b> with the aid of thin vertical bands of coloured sand cast in a large distinctly fabricated pullout box. The philosophy behind the design and development of the new screw nail is briefly described first followed by presentation of the laboratory testing procedure and its instrumentation. The results of the testings indicate that the slip mechanism, which controls the pullout behaviour, is rather different to the conventional soil nails and the resultant pullout capacity is higher when compared to this type soil nails. This effect is attributed to the geometry of the screw nail and the installation processes that result in the development of different soil stresses around the soil nail. In addition, the experimental pullout results demonstrate, contrary to the conventional soil nail, that the screw nail pullout capacity is dependent on the overburden pressure and that the failure planes extends out a certain radial distance from the soil-nail interface. From the test results, it is shown that the failure of the screw nail satisfies the Mohr-Coulomb failure condition, which is similar behaviour seen in the conventional soil nail tests...|$|E

Its devastating effects attracted the worldwide attention of the geotechnical engineering community in 1964, when the large Alaskan earthquake was followed by Niigata earthquake in Japan, both over 7. 5 degree of Richter magnitude. The behavior of soils when and earthquake occurs, has been studied many years, because the damage produced by the magnitude of earthquake can be directly influence by the features of the soils. The inadequate behavior of the loose soils under earthquake conditions, especially the phenomena of liquefaction in <b>cohesionless</b> <b>material,</b> has produced economic and human effects around the world. For this reason, a lot of investigation work has been undertaken to develop liquefaction assessment methods and the design of mitigation methods.

For the case of a slurry supported face in <b>cohesionless</b> <b>material</b> Müller-Kirchenbauer [2] presented a solution for the minimal stagna-tion gradient of the slurry, required to ensure the stability {{of a small group of}} grains at the face. Combined with an estimate of the equivalent radius of the average flow channel between the grains, this solution can be used to estimate the minimal required yield strength of the slurry. In cohesive soils one often disregards the local stability of the soil, as it is deemed secondary to the stability of the entire face. A problem could occur, however, in cases where a pressure gradient towards the face is present. This is easily conceivable in an earth-pressure balance shield with support pressures below the local hydrostatic pressure [1]. Unfortunately the general approach followed by Müller-Kirchenbauer does not lead to a straightforward solution in cohesive materials and a different approach is needed.

Test results showed that the ef- fect of compaction water content is more significant in the dry side than in the wet side. The compaction water content has less effect on the GRB and the Basalt than on the Bandia limestone. GRB and Basalt are <b>cohesionless</b> <b>materials</b> and allow water to drain even during the compaction procedure. Change in water content increases as the compaction water content increases because of the drainage of the excess water during the compaction and loading procedures. For GRB and Basalt, at Wopt + 1. 5 %, most of the excess water is drained during the compaction of the sample and continue to be drained during the Resilient Modulus test. For the Bandia limestone, this drainage is less significant due to cohesion, absorption and hydratation...|$|R

Experiments with an overload and without it were made with latex tubes filled with water or spherical glass beads {{and the results were}} compared with the theoretical profile derived from the Janssen model. The results suggest that the soft elastic tubes could provide a simple and convenient means to investigate the forces that arise in different materials...|$|R
