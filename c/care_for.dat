5|$|Male <b>care</b> <b>for</b> infants {{has been}} {{documented}} in ruffed lemur societies.

5|$|Mated females then seek a {{suitable}} place to begin a colony. There, they break off their wings and begin to lay and <b>care</b> <b>for</b> eggs. The females can selectively fertilise future eggs with the sperm stored to produce diploid workers or lay unfertilized haploid eggs to produce drones. The first workers to hatch are known as nanitics, and are weaker and smaller than later workers, but they begin to serve the colony immediately. They enlarge the nest, forage for food, and <b>care</b> <b>for</b> the other eggs. Species that have multiple queens may have a queen leaving the nest along with some workers to found a colony at a new site, a process akin to swarming in honeybees.|$|E
