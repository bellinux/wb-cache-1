The results of open pit testing indicated <b>circular</b> <b>errors</b> <b>probable</b> (CEPs) which ranged from 3. 62 to 28. 16 centimeters/hour and spherical <b>errors</b> <b>probable</b> (SEP) which ranged from 10. 18 to 49. 07 centimeters/hour over all of the tests. The mean CEP was 13. 1 centimeters/hour and the mean SEP was 22. 44 centimeters/hour. Confirmation of these findings by additional testing will help support the viability of the Honeywell Ore Recovery and Tunneling Aid as a candidate for accurate continuous miner navigation.

25|$|The first development, called Al-Hussein or Project 1728, with a {{range of}} 400 miles, allowed the Iraqi army to attack deep inside the Iranian boundaries.

Specific test objectives were developed to investigate signals both {{on the bench and}} in the air. Signal to noise ratio and lane counting characteristics were investigated in a single frequency, uncorrected mode and in a pseudo-differential mode. It was learned that the received signal to noise ratio is highly correlated with lane counting characteristics and receiver navigability. The relationship between system accuracy and reliability was also examined. The Omega navigation system's bias and position accuracy were investigated with the aid of the Discrete Address Beacon System (DABS).
