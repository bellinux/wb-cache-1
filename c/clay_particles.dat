5|$|The flat {{appearance}} of mature abyssal plains {{results from the}} blanketing of this originally uneven surface of oceanic crust by fine-grained sediments, mainly clay and silt. Much of this sediment is deposited from turbidity currents that have been channeled from the continental margins along submarine canyons down into deeper water. The remainder of the sediment comprises chiefly dust (<b>clay</b> <b>particles)</b> blown out to sea from land, {{and the remains of}} small marine plants and animals which sink from the upper layer of the ocean, known as pelagic sediments. The total sediment deposition rate in remote areas is estimated at two to three centimeters per thousand years. Sediment-covered abyssal plains are less common in the Pacific Ocean than in other major ocean basins because sediments from turbidity currents are trapped in oceanic trenches that border the Pacific Ocean.|$|E

For undisturbed deflocculated slip settling in a transparent container, these layers are usually visible within 24 hours. Siphoning off the topmost layers of slip, which contain the smallest and lightest <b>clay</b> <b>particles,</b> produces terra sigillata. The remaining heavier settled layers of deflocculated clay slip are discarded.|$|E

25|$|The {{classification}} of fine-grained soils, i.e., soils that are finer than sand, is determined primarily by their Atterberg limits, not by their grain size. If {{it is important}} to determine the grain size distribution of fine-grained soils, the hydrometer test may be performed. In the hydrometer tests, the soil particles are mixed with water and shaken to produce a dilute suspension in a glass cylinder, and then the cylinder is left to sit. A hydrometer is used to measure the density of the suspension as a function of time. <b>Clay</b> <b>particles</b> may take several hours to settle past the depth of measurement of the hydrometer. Sand particles may take less than a second. Stoke's law provides the theoretical basis to calculate the relationship between sedimentation velocity and particle size. ASTM provides the detailed procedures for performing the Hydrometer test.|$|E

40|$|It is {{generally}} {{believed that the}} formation of recalcitrant (slowly desorbing) fractions of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in soils is due to diffusion of compounds to sorption sites inaccessible to bulk fluid. The exact nature of these sites, however, is not well understood. In clay minerals, researchers favor two probable areas for the storage of persistent contamination; sites between the clay lamella, or sites with <b>clay</b> <b>particle</b> aggregates. To test the hypothesis that recalcitrant fractions are formed in interlamellar spaces, a Na/Ca Montmorillonite (Smectite) was ion exchanged with five different cations (K+, Na+, Ca+, Mg 2 +, Fe 3 +) to form mineralogically similar clays with varying interlamellar environments. These soils were inoculated with an organic compound (toluene), incubated for 24 hours, and the recalcitant fraction quantified for varying desorption times. The results did not show a clear correlation between persistent contamination and the interlamellar environment. Instead, evidence appears to support the conclusion that persistent contamination may be stored in <b>clay</b> <b>particle</b> microaggregates...|$|R
25|$|The depth, {{texture and}} {{composition}} of soils can influence its water retaining and draining ability. Soils containing large amounts of organic material tend to have the highest water retention abilities. These types of soils include deep loams, silty soils like what is typically found on the fertile valley floors {{such as in the}} California's Napa Valley. <b>Clay</b> <b>particles</b> have the potential to remain in colloidal suspension {{for long periods of time}} when it is dissolved in water. This gives clay-based soils the potential to retain significant amount of water such as the clay soils of the Right bank Bordeaux region of Pomerol. Many regions with these types of water retaining soils have little need for irrigation, or if they do it is usually supplemental during periods of drought. Soils with poor water retention include sand and alluvial gravel based soils such as those found in the Barolo and Barbaresco zones of Italy or in many areas of South Australia. Depending on the climate and amount of natural rainfall, areas with poor water retention may need irrigation.|$|E
25|$|The x-ray {{diffraction}} {{of a sample}} from an unfired lump of pottery clay excavated at the Zebree (3MS20) site confirmed that the shell was burned before being added to the raw clay. Burning the shells eliminates the organic binder and the cooled, burnt shells are easily crushed into a shell temper of fine plate-like particles, some nearly powder. The hinges of the shells are discarded. Using burned shells is logical as unburned mussel shells are hard and very durable. In terms of soil technology, the addition of shell (calcium carbonate) {{has the effect of}} neutralizing the ionic charge of the <b>clay</b> <b>particles.</b> During the course of replicative pottery experiments, as the shell was added to the clay in the presence of water, distinct and immediate changes took place in the feel of the clay. With the valence neutral, the clay-temper combination produces a very satisfactory pottery clay.

500|$|A {{large part}} of the surface area of the world's deserts {{consists}} of flat, stone-covered plains dominated by wind erosion. In [...] "eolian deflation", the wind continually removes fine-grained material, which becomes wind-blown sand. This exposes coarser-grained material, mainly pebbles with some larger stones or cobbles, leaving a desert pavement, an area of land overlaid by closely packed smooth stones forming a tessellated mosaic. Different theories exist as to how exactly the pavement is formed. It may be that after the sand and dust is blown away by the wind the stones jiggle themselves into place; alternatively, stones previously below ground may in some way work themselves to the surface. Very little further erosion takes place after the formation of a pavement, and the ground becomes stable. Evaporation brings moisture to the surface by capillary action and calcium salts may be precipitated, binding particles together to form a desert conglomerate. In time, bacteria that live {{on the surface of the}} stones accumulate a film of minerals and <b>clay</b> <b>particles,</b> forming a shiny brown coating known as desert varnish.|$|E

The team conducted {{research at the}} AAS Station Lab at Arkansas State University involving macroscopic, microscopic, petrographic thin-sections, atomic absorption and x-ray diffraction analyses. A member of the team, Michael G. Million, also conducted replicative experiments, perhaps the first to do so with the exact clays, tempers and tools used by prehistoric Mississippian potters. Pastes were created {{using a variety of}} temper-to-clay percentages so that vessels as well as test-tiles could be produced for examination. Test tiles gave information about the shrinkage rates of various clay/temper combinations to the 'green' state and then further information upon firing. Simple, round bottom cooking jars were built using coil construction and the Mississippian pottery tool set including a potteryanvil, wooden paddle, mussel shell scrapers and polishing stones. The research discovered that there were very good reasons for using shell tempering for Mississippi Valley clays. The nature of clays formed by such a large meandering river system are distinctive. The huge annually flooded backswamp areas create a clay which is composed of very minute <b>clay</b> <b>particles</b> (primarily silica) and a high proportion of organic content.

2500|$|Although many {{naturally}} occurring deposits include both silts and clay, clays are distinguished from other fine-grained soils by differences {{in size and}} mineralogy. Silts, which are fine-grained soils that do not include clay minerals, tend to have larger particle sizes than clays. There is, however, some overlap in particle size and other physical properties. [...] The distinction between silt and clay varies by discipline. Geologists and soil scientists usually consider the separation to occur at a particle size of 2 µm (clays being finer than silts), sedimentologists often use 4–5 μm, and colloid chemists use 1 μm.
