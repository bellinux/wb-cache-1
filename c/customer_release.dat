30|$|We {{started off}} the {{refinement}} {{by providing a}} definition for the processes. This helped us to identify different processes that, in fact, refer to the same process; too large processes that could be decomposed into smaller ones more suitable for SPC; and processes that are subprocesses of others. In (Brito and Barcellos) the following processes were identified: Coding, <b>Customer</b> <b>Release,</b> Design, Fixing, Inspection, Maintenance, Project Management, Quality Assurance, Recruitment, Requirements Development, Requirements Management, Review, Risk Management, Software Development and Testing.|$|E
40|$|Software bugs {{discovered}} by end-users are inevitable {{consequences of a}} vendor’s lack of testing. While they frequently result in costly system failures, one way to detect and prevent them is to engage the customer in acceptance testing during the release process. Yet, there is a considerable lack of empirical studies examining release management from end-users’ perspective. To address this gap, we propose and empirically test a release framework that positions the <b>customer</b> <b>release</b> manager {{in the center of}} the release process. Using a participatory action research strategy, a twenty-seven-month study was conducted to evaluate and improve the effectiveness of the framework through seven major and 39 minor releases...|$|E

40|$|The {{number of}} {{functional}} errors escaping design verification and being released into final silicon is growing, {{due to the}} increasing complexity and shrinking production schedules of modern processor designs. Recent trends towards chip multiprocessors (CMPs) are exacerbating the problem because of their complex and sometimes nondeterministic memory subsystems, prone to subtle but devastating bugs. This deteriorating situation calls for highefficiency, high-coverage results in functional validation, results that are be achieved by leveraging the performance of post-silicon validation, that is, those verification tasks that are executed directly on prototype hardware. The orders-of-magnitude faster testing in post-silicon enables designers to achieve much higher coverage before <b>customer</b> <b>release,</b> {{but only if the}} limitations of this technology in diagnosis and internal node observability could be overcome. In this work, we unlock the full performance of postsilicon validation through Dacota, a new high-coverage solution for validating memory operation ordering in CMPs. When activated, Dacota reconfigures a portion of the cache storage to log memory accesses using a compact datacoloring scheme. Logs are periodically aggregated and checked by a distributed algorithm running in-situ on the CMP to verify correct memory operation ordering. When the design is ready for customer shipment, Dacota can be deactivated, releasing all cache storage, and only leaving a small silicon area footprint, less than 0. 01 % (three orders of magnitude smaller than previous solutions). We found experimentally that Dacota is effective in exposing memory subsystem bugs, and it delivers its high coverage capabilities at a 26 % performance slowdown (only during validation) for real-world applications. 1...|$|E

40|$|We {{present an}} {{economic}} model of fixing or patching a software problem after the product {{has been released}} in the market. Specifically, we model a software firm’s trade-off in releasing a buggy product early and investments in fixing it later. We first show that patching investments and time to enter the market are strategic complements such that higher investments in patching capability allow the firm to enter the market earlier. Just as the marginal cost of producing software can be effectively zero, so can be the marginal cost of repairing multiple copies of defective software by issuing patches. We show that due to the fixed cost nature of investments in patching, a vendor has incentives to release a buggier product early and patch it later in a larger market. We contrast this result with other physical good markets. Thus, we show that a monopolist releases a product with fewer bugs but later than what is socially optimal. We extend our model to incorporate duopoly competition and show that in competition, the high value firm always enters earlier than the monopolist. Ironically the firm offering greater value to <b>customers</b> <b>releases</b> a product that initially is of lower quality (more bugs), but provides the greater value by <b>releasing</b> early (so <b>customers</b> can use the product sooner) and by investing more in patching so it can provide better after-sale support to its customers...|$|R

40|$|This work is {{concerned}} with solving the vehicle routing problem (VRP) which {{takes into account the}} <b>customer’s</b> <b>release</b> and due date. The problem studied can also be categorized as a non-classical VRP as the departure times of vehicles depend on the dates of orders released from the production line and become available for the distribution process. The problem is investigated through two stages. In the first stage, vehicle routing problem with release and due date (VRPRDD) is treated. At the beginning of the planning, it is assumed that the dates where the customer orders become available are known. A mathematical formulation is developed to represent the problem which solved by several heuristics, i. e. Variable Neighborhood Search (VNS), Large Neighborhood Search (LNS) and Tabu Search (TS). The algorithms are written in C++ and run on a PC computer with an Intel PentiumCore by using 56 ’s Solomon instances with some modification. Different kinds of vehicle routing problem have been tackled in order to see the performance of proposed heuristics. The results are then compared in order to find the best method which yields the least routing cost solution. From the outcome obtained, VNS is proved to be the best algorithm which generates the least cost solution to our problem. Further investigation has been carried out in stage two which considers the extension of VRPRDD. The coordination of production sequence and vehicle routing (PS-VRPRDD) is the main subject to our problem studied in which the best production sequence will leads to the least routing. Classical decomposition approach, namely Alternateis used which decompose the problems into two sub-problems, i. e. production sequence and vehicle routing. The results proved that effective coordination shows the large potential savings that attract the interest of industrial distributors in optimizing their distribution process in practice...|$|R
