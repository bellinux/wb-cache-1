5|$|On August 3, 1915, the Mill Creek (Lake Erie) flooded {{downtown}} Erie. A <b>culvert,</b> or a tunnel, {{was blocked}} by debris, and collapsed. A four-block reservoir, caused by torrential downpours, had formed behind it. The resulting deluge destroyed 225houses and killed 36people. After the flood, Mayor Miles Brown Kitts had the Mill Creek directed into another larger <b>culvert,</b> constructed under more than 2 miles of city, before emptying into Presque Isle Bay on the city's lower east side.|$|E
5|$|At Port Tennant, {{the course}} of the canal has been covered over by railways, roads and other {{facilities}} of the port, but continues to supply water to the Prince of Wales dock through a large <b>culvert,</b> which helps to maintain water levels in the docks. The Tennant canal is still owned by the Coombe-Tennant family.|$|E
5|$|It then flows past a small {{mountain}} on the north, {{known as}} Kite Hill, and is diverted {{into a large}} <b>culvert</b> underneath Alicia Parkway that drains it to a small canyon. The creek then flows into Aliso Creek, just outside the boundary of Aliso and Wood Canyons Regional Park.|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1997 Twenty eight {{countersunk}} <b>culverts</b> in Oregon {{were evaluated}} to assess current conditions and hydraulic performance. The <b>culverts</b> were also assessed {{with respect to}} their stability, particularly when subjected to high flows. In general, the <b>culverts</b> were found to be resistant to erosion and effective at conveying large discharges. Based on study results and reviewed literature, recommendations are given for design of countersunk <b>culverts.</b> Recommendations include countersinking <b>culverts</b> at least 20...|$|R
40|$|Bibliography: leaves 69 - 72. Modern {{fast track}} {{construction}} methods increasingly favour {{the use of}} precast concrete elements. Precast box <b>culverts</b> are structurally significant units, subject to an important combination of bridge loadings. <b>Culverts</b> occasionally in contact with water pose a high durability risk. Despite this, the current specifications allow a reduction in cover to reinforcing steel for precast <b>culverts</b> to only 20 mm from at least 40 mm for cast-in-place <b>culverts...</b>|$|R
40|$|Testimony {{issued by}} the General Accounting Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "GAO discussed the condition of <b>culverts</b> on fish-bearing streams in Oregon and Washington and the federal efforts to identify and restore <b>culverts</b> that are impeding fish passage on Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and Forest Service lands. This testimony {{is based on a}} November 2001 report (GAO- 02 - 136), which described (1) the number of <b>culverts</b> that may impede fish passage on BLM and Forest Service lands in Oregon and Washington, (2) the factors affecting the agencies' ability to restore passage through <b>culverts</b> acting as barrier <b>culverts,</b> and (3) the results of the agencies' efforts to restore fish passage. ...|$|R
5|$|On May 19, 2015, the {{pipeline}} operators in Midland, Texas remotely detected pressure anomalies {{and shut down}} Line 901 at 11:30am. The Santa Barbara County Fire Department initially responded around 11:40am to a report of a strong smell coming from the area. Fire crews found the crude oil flowing from a drainage <b>culvert</b> that passed under U.S. 101, and into the Pacific Ocean and reported the leak to authorities. Local pipeline workers {{did not know about}} the leak until they were notified by the state parks staff around noon that there was oil in the water. After struggling to find the leaking pipeline, workers located Line 901 where it had leaked and flowed into the storm <b>culvert</b> around 1:30pm. Clean-up efforts didn't begin for 16 to 18 hours.|$|E
5|$|The creek turns sharply {{west and}} then back south, then shortly after, is forced into a concrete-lined box <b>culvert</b> that carries it through {{downtown}} Laguna Beach (This stretch {{is also known as}} Broadway Creek.) It then is diverted completely underground and its channel winds to an outfall at Main Beach, {{one of the most popular}} beaches in Laguna Beach.|$|E
5|$|The {{drainage}} <b>culvert</b> at {{the southeast}} corner of the drydock was rebuilt in December 2013, and the drydock itself completely excavated in April 2014. The entrance to the drydock, at the western end, was surmounted by a bridge, partially demolished in 2002 but rebuilt during 2014.|$|E
40|$|This report {{presents}} {{the findings from}} a fish passage survey conducted on various types of highway <b>culverts.</b> This survey includes 39 <b>culverts</b> located throughout the state of Oregon. To simplify the findings, the report places the 39 Oregon <b>culverts</b> into four categories: (1) pipes and pipe-arches with no special provisions for fish passage, (2) pipes and pipe-arches with special provisions for fish passage, (3) pipes and pipe-arches with natural stream beds, and (4) arches. Based upon the survey, the report concludes that <b>culverts</b> with natural stream bed surfaces provide the best facilities for passing fish. The report also presents procedures and criteria for designing and installing highway <b>culverts</b> that must pass fish. From the presented survey findings and recommended design and installation methods contained in the report, the reader should, therefore, be able to resolve most problems associated with designing and installing highway <b>culverts</b> to pass fish...|$|R
50|$|A simple {{low-water}} crossing can {{be constructed}} with <b>culverts.</b> <b>Culverts</b> (often concrete pipes) are used to carry {{the water in a}} stream keeping the crossing surface dry for most of the year. High flows, e.g. spring runoff or flash floods, flow {{over the top of the}} crossing, as the <b>culverts</b> are not large enough to carry these flood-type runoff events.|$|R
40|$|Minimizing {{obstructed}} fish {{passage through}} <b>culverts</b> {{is an important}} step that an engineer must take when designing and installing <b>culverts.</b> This process will often require consultation with a fish biologist to ensure that all fish passage considerations are recognized. The existing research is reviewed and synthesized. A good set of recognized guidelines to be used to design <b>culverts</b> for roads in rural areas is provided...|$|R
5|$|Where {{it passes}} through Bristol the river was prone to flooding, but the Northern Stormwater Interceptor, running from Eastville Sluices to the River Avon {{downstream}} of Clifton Suspension Bridge, has since been constructed to control this. At Wade Street, St Judes, the river enters an underground <b>culvert,</b> emerging at what Bristolians call The Centre (formerly the 'Tramways Centre'), but only {{when there is a}} risk of flooding. The river is otherwise channelled through Mylne's <b>Culvert</b> into the River Avon at a point between Bathurst Basin and Gaol Ferry Bridge. Three further flood relief tunnels- Castle Ditch, Fosseway and Castle Green Tunnel - run under Castle Park in central Bristol to carry excess flows into the Floating Harbour.|$|E
5|$|Crowley {{started the}} process of {{designing}} the Tumbler for the film by model bashing. Crowley used the nose cone of a P-38 Lightning model {{to serve as the}} chassis for the Tumbler's turbine engine. Six models of the Tumbler were built to 1:12 scale in the course of four months. Following the scale model creation, a crew of over 30 people, including Crowley and engineers Chris <b>Culvert</b> and Annie Smith, carved a full-size replica of the Tumbler out of a large block of Styrofoam in two months.|$|E
5|$|Keyser Creek is {{one source}} of {{flooding}} in the borough of Taylor. It is also the only recent flooding source in the borough. In 1971, the creek overflowed after a rainstorm, damaging several yards and lots near Oak Street and First Street. The flooding {{was caused by a}} faulty <b>culvert,</b> which was later replaced by the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation.|$|E
50|$|In {{the early}} 20th century, {{a portion of}} the creek flowed through a channel in the center of Marin Avenue in Albany, which has since been <b>culverted.</b> In fact the creek has been <b>culverted</b> nearly in its {{entirety}} under Marin Avenue. <b>Culverting</b> of this creek has led to flooding and drainage problems in Albany, as this practice is not a sound nor permanent method of containing drainwater.|$|R
40|$|Following a {{previous}} study (Baral et al., 2012), a detailed investigation incorporating field observations and more fish species {{has been carried out}} in Northeast Ohio to determine the percentage of <b>culverts</b> that act as barriers for fish passage and to identify the design parameters that can be associated with passage success. After a desk study and field visits, 55 <b>culverts</b> were chosen from an inventory of 5, 837 <b>culverts</b> provided by the Ohio Department of Transportation for further analysis of passage success in FishXing and HEC-RAS. The results from FishXing analysis suggest that out of the 54 <b>culverts</b> analyzed, 11...|$|R
50|$|<b>Culverts</b> are {{classified}} by standards for their load capacities, water flow capacities, life spans, and installation requirements for bedding and backfill. Most agencies adhere to these standards when designing, engineering, and specifying <b>culverts.</b>|$|R
5|$|Major {{repair work}} was done in 2003 and 2006, when the Victorian {{drainage}} <b>culvert</b> was replaced and the track lowered to allow access for larger passenger and freight stock {{at a cost of}} £10million. The 16 closed airshafts were deteriorating and had to be re-capped. In 2003 the excavated material from the works was recycled to shore up the railway embankment near Castley.|$|E
5|$|At the {{opposite}} end, at Ysgwrfa, the final five locks before Glynneath have been severed by a realignment {{of the road}} and the construction of a <b>culvert,</b> but the road has carried a lot less traffic since the A465 bypass was opened, and could possibly be rerouted along its original course, where the bridge over the canal still exists. The Neath Canal Act has not been repealed, and so there is still a right of navigation along this section, which should ease the process of reinstating it. The terminus would then be near the Lamb and Flag public house, south of the final two locks, which are unlikely to be restored.|$|E
5|$|Construction of the Green Line past Anacostia Station was {{complicated}} by {{the discovery of a}} potential toxic waste site {{in the path of the}} subway. In June 1991, WMATA discovered that the District of Columbia had dumped 426,000 tons of possibly hazardous incinerator bottom ash in an unused exposed <b>culvert</b> along the subway's potential path near St. Elizabeth's Hospital between 1977 and 1989. The city continued to dump the ash at the site for four years after it learned that WMATA planned to use the site for the Green Line. Experts were concerned that the ash dump contained pockets of methane gas and soluble acid, which would make the site unusable by Metrorail.|$|E
50|$|As on 2012, the Corporation {{maintains}} 262 bridges, road-overbridges and road-underbridges, including 65 high-level bridges, 31 box <b>culverts,</b> 81 slab <b>culverts,</b> 11 rail-overbridges, 14 rail-underbridges, 6 pedestrian subways, 6 causeways, 35 footbridges and 13 grade separators.|$|R
5000|$|The {{original}} trail features three {{random rubble}} limestone <b>culverts</b> that cross gullies. They measure from 8 ft to 15.5 ft {{in length and}} 3 ft in width. [...] The trails and <b>culverts</b> form a historic district.|$|R
40|$|Precast box <b>culverts</b> {{can be used}} {{to quickly}} solve many {{challenging}} drainage problems. This presentation will review how box <b>culverts</b> are specified and designed. Various examples will be used to demonstrate the proper installation techniques and multiple applications for a successful project. Topics will include standard specifications; considerations for live, dead and construction loadings; installation (site preparation, bedding, placement, joint treatment and backfill); and applications (<b>culverts,</b> detention, storm drainage, end treatments, and special fittings) ...|$|R
5|$|If {{a person}} spots a nearby tornado while driving, the {{official}} National Weather Service directive {{has been for}} the individual to abandon the car and seek shelter in a ditch or <b>culvert,</b> or substantial shelter if nearby. Far-away, highly visible tornadoes, however, can be successfully fled from at right angles (90-degrees) from its direction of apparent movement. Despite dangers inherent with operating a vehicle during a tornado, given sufficient advance warning, mobile home residents have been instructed by the National Weather Service to drive to the nearest secure shelter during a warning.|$|E
5|$|Laguna Canyon and {{its side}} tributaries have {{received}} some flood control modifications. These include debris basins {{at the mouth}} of nearly every major tributary, stretches of lined or unlined flood control channels, and other structures. The debris basins, sometimes called retention basins, are circular depressions constructed by the Orange County Flood Control Division to slow down flash floods. The upper Laguna Canyon area has a few flood control channels and the lower creek is encased entirely in one; this begins as a riprap channel with an unlined bottom, which transitions to a concrete <b>culvert.</b> These improvements help to protect infrastructure in the canyon from storm and landslide damage.|$|E
5|$|The {{second phase}} of the {{restoration}} project will be the section from Stonehouse to the Gloucester and Sharpness Canal at Saul, which has been blocked by both the M5 motorway and the A38 road. A bid was submitted to the Living Landmarks Fund in August 2006. This is part of the Big Lottery Fund, and £16 million was requested. An interim award of £250,000 was made, to allow the bid to be developed, but the application was rejected in November 2007. Despite this setback, money for purchasing the land around the M5 and the A38 was part of the phase 1 grant by the HLF. Current proposals for the A38 involve tunnelling under the Whitminster roundabout. The original Bristol Road Lock was buried by the construction of the roundabout, and will be reconstructed to the east of it. There are two proposals for passing under the M5 motorway. One is for a new channel alongside the River Frome through an existing <b>culvert,</b> and the other is for a new wider <b>culvert,</b> nearer to the original line of the canal. Below this, the canal used to cross the River Frome at Lockham Aqueduct, but this was demolished in the 1970s, when the canal and river channel were combined as part of a flood defence scheme.|$|E
50|$|To {{accommodate}} the lengthening of and increased separation between runways 5L/23R and 5R/23L, Cleveland Hopkins International Airport routed {{a section of}} the creek through a set of four ten-foot diameter concrete <b>culverts.</b> The 3,800-foot-long <b>culverts</b> were built spanning {{the entire length of the}} creek's path through the airport property. The contract to perform the <b>culverting</b> was awarded to Independence Excavating in 2001, with construction starting in January 2002 and finishing in 2004.|$|R
50|$|Fulton Creek {{has been}} <b>culverted</b> {{most of its}} way, {{in order for the}} City of Edmonton to build neighbourhoods in the {{surrounding}} areas. Due to being <b>culverted,</b> the creek's discharge into the river is very minimal and tends to dry up in the summer. Spring melt can cause the creek to overflow, allowing melt water to access the river. Over time, the City of Edmonton Drainage Department has added <b>culverts</b> and Gabion Check dams to address erosion and high flow incidents.|$|R
50|$|The Act {{eventually}} {{limited the}} amount of traffic on <b>culverted</b> paths as they often fell within land {{that was to be}} enclosed. This often meant that traffic eventually stopped going along certain routes such as the <b>culverted</b> path next to Shit Brook in Much Wenlock.|$|R
5|$|There is {{evidence}} of Roman settlement around what is now Bond Street. In 1894, a <b>culvert</b> made from brick and stone was discovered in the area. The street was named after Sir Thomas Bond, {{the head of a}} syndicate of developers who purchased a Piccadilly mansion called Clarendon House from Christopher Monck, 2nd Duke of Albemarle in 1686, and proceeded to demolish the house and develop the area. At that time, the house backed onto open fields, known as Albemarle Ground, and the development of estates in Mayfair had just begun.|$|E
5|$|When the {{standing}} committee visited the two projects in 1996, they {{were met by}} demonstrators {{in favor of the}} bridge in Hardanger, and demonstrators in opposition to the fixed link in Sunnhordland. In May, SBT proposed building a <b>culvert</b> on Digernes as a compromise for a proposal from the Labour Party and the Christian Democratic Party to consider other solution, which could have postponed the project several years. Parliament decided on 11 June 1996, with 144 against 20 votes, to build the Triangle Link. The Folgefonna Tunnel was also passed, while the Hardanger Bridge was put aside.|$|E
5|$|A second bid to the Heritage Lottery Fund for the {{connection}} from Stonehouse to the Gloucester and Sharpness Canal at Saul was rejected in 2007. This section presents some engineering challenges, {{as it was}} severed by {{the construction of the}} M5 motorway and the A38 road. The roundabout where the A38 joins the A419 road was built over Bristol Road Lock, and part of the route was destroyed by flood relief work for the River Frome. At Stonehouse, the bridge carrying the Bristol and Gloucester Railway {{has been replaced by a}} <b>culvert,</b> but a bid has been made to the newly formed Gloucestershire Local Transport Board for its reinstatement, and to create a long-distance footpath along the route. Outside of the main restoration, the Cotswold Canals Trust are gradually restoring many of the other structures, with the ultimate goal of re-opening a link between the River Thames and the River Severn.|$|E
30|$|The former {{structure}} {{supported a}} paved road and allowed water {{to pass through}} eight <b>culverts,</b> each 76.2  cm in diameter and 21  m long, with two <b>culverts</b> submerged during normal flow. The combined flow capacity of these <b>culverts</b> was insufficient during fullbank discharge—the average channel width at this location is approximately 12  m, with a bankfull width of 75  m—and frequently caused water to back up behind the embankment. This resulted in repeated flooding of the adjacent parking lots, and a solution was urgently needed.|$|R
50|$|<b>Culverts</b> and drains occur {{frequently}} {{along the}} Main Range Railway. At varying depths beneath the rail, they direct {{water from the}} north side of the track, passing under the length of the railway and parallel access road and drain to the south east. The <b>culverts</b> and drains vary greatly in size shape and composition. Materials for <b>culverts</b> and drains include cut stone, mortared rocks, brick, concrete and corrugated iron piping. The following descriptions are of entrances situated on {{the north side of}} the track.|$|R
5|$|In 2001, twenty-one {{northwest}} Washington tribes, {{joined by}} the United States filed a Request for Determination in U.S. District Court, asking the court {{to find that the}} State of Washington has a treaty-based duty to preserve fish runs and habitat sufficiently for the tribes to earn a “moderate living,” and sought to compel the state to repair or replace <b>culverts</b> that impede salmon migration. On August 22, 2007, the district court issued a summary judgment order, holding that while <b>culverts</b> impeding andromadous fish migration are not the only factor diminishing their upstream habitat, in building and maintaining <b>culverts</b> that impede salmon migration, Washington State had diminished the size of salmon runs within the case area and thereby violated its obligation under the Stevens Treaties. On March 29, 2013, the court issued an injunction ordering the state to significantly increase the effort for removing state-owned <b>culverts</b> that block habitat for salmon and steelhead, and to replace the state-owned <b>culverts</b> that have the greatest adverse impact on the habitat of andromadous fish by 2030.|$|R
