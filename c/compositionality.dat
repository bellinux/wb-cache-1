He maintains that if language is the expression of thoughts and language is systematic, then thoughts must also be systematic. Fodor draws on the work of Noam Chomsky to both model his theory of the mind and to refute alternative architectures such as connectionism. Systematicity in natural languages was explained by Chomsky in terms of two more basic concepts: productivity and <b>compositionality.</b>|$|E

5000|$|A {{fundamental}} scientific {{issue to}} be understood and resolved, which applied equally to human development, is how <b>compositionality,</b> functional hierarchies, primitives, and modularity, {{at all levels of}} sensorimotor and social structures, can be formed and leveraged during development.

This principle states that the meaning of a whole should be constructed from the meanings of the parts that make up the whole. In other words, one should {{be in a position to}} understand the whole if one understands the meanings of each of the parts that make up the whole.

5000|$|Many {{aspects of}} the problem of the {{composition}} of sentences are addressed in the field of linguistics of syntax. Philosophical semantics tends to focus on the principle of <b>compositionality</b> to explain the relationship between meaningful parts and whole sentences. The principle of <b>compositionality</b> asserts that a sentence can be understood {{on the basis of the}} meaning of the parts of the sentence (i.e., words, morphemes) along with an understanding of its structure (i.e., syntax, logic). [...] Further, syntactic propositions are arranged into 'discourse' or 'narrative' structures, which also encode meanings through pragmatics like temporal relations and pronominals.|$|E

5000|$|Another {{trait of}} {{cognitive}} semantics is {{the recognition that}} meaning is not fixed but a matter of construal and conventionalization. The processes of linguistic construal, it is argued, are the same psychological processes involved in the processing of encyclopaedic knowledge and in perception. This view has implications for the problem of <b>compositionality.</b> An account in cognitive semantics called the dynamic construal theory makes the claim that words themselves are without meaning: they have, at best, [...] "default construals," [...] which are really just ways of using words. Along these lines, cognitive semantics argues that <b>compositionality</b> can only be intelligible if pragmatic elements like context and intention are taken into consideration.|$|E

50|$|Peter Pagin (born 1953) is Professor of Philosophy at Stockholm University. He is a {{specialist}} {{in the philosophy of}} language and has worked extensively on foundational issues in semantics and on technical and philosophical problems about the <b>compositionality</b> of meaning.|$|E
5000|$|The {{principle}} of <b>compositionality</b> {{has been the}} subject of intense debate. Indeed, there is no general agreement as to how the principle is to be interpreted, although there have been several attempts to provide formal definitions of it. (Szabó, 2012) ...|$|E
50|$|Sphoṭa theory {{remained}} widely {{influential in}} Indian philosophy {{of language and}} {{was the focus of}} much debate over several centuries. It was adopted by most scholars of Vyākaraṇa (grammar), but both the Mīmāṃsā and Nyāya schools rejected it, primarily on the grounds of <b>compositionality.</b> Adherents of the 'sphota' doctrine were holistic or non-compositional (a-khanḍa-pakṣa), suggesting that many larger units of language are understood as a whole, whereas the Mīmāṃsakas in particular proposed <b>compositionality</b> (khanḍa-pakṣa). According to the former, word meanings, if any, are arrived at after analyzing the sentences in which they occur. Interestingly, this debate had many of the features animating present day debates in language over semantic holism, for example.|$|E
5000|$|The {{relationship}} between <b>compositionality</b> and semantic holism {{has also been}} of interest to many philosophers of language. On the surface {{it would seem that}} these two ideas are in complete and irremediable contradiction. <b>Compositionality</b> is the principle that states that the meaning of a complex expression depends on the meaning of its parts and on its mode of composition. As stated before, holism, on the other hand, is the thesis that the meanings of expressions of a language are determined by their relations with the other expressions of the language as a whole. Peter Pagin, in an essay called Are <b>Compositionality</b> and Holism Compatible identifies three points of incompatibility between these two hypotheses. The first consists in the simple observation that while, for holism, the meaning of the whole would seem to precede that of its parts in terms of priority, for <b>compositionality,</b> the reverse is true, the meaning of the parts precedes that of the whole. The second incoherence consists in the fact that a necessity to attribute [...] "strange" [...] meanings to the components of larger expressions would apparently result from any attempt to reconcile <b>compositionality</b> and holism. Pagin takes a specific holistic theory of meaning - inferential role semantics, the theory according to which the meaning of an expression is determined by the inferences that it involves - as his paradigm of holism. If we interpret this theory holistically, the result will be that every accepted inference that involves some expression will enter into the meaning of that expression. Suppose, for example, that Fred believes that [...] "Brown cows are dangerous". That is, he accepts the inference from [...] "brown cows" [...] to [...] "dangerous." [...] This entails that this inference is now part of the meaning of [...] "brown cow." [...] According to <b>compositionality</b> then, [...] "cow implies dangerous" [...] and [...] "brown implies dangerous" [...] are both true because they are the constituents of the expression [...] "brown cow." [...] But is this really an inevitable consequence of the acceptance of the holism of inferential role semantics? To see why it's not assume the existence of a relation of inference I between two expressions x and y and that the relation applies just in case F accepts the inference from x to y. Suppose that in the extension of I, there are the following pairs of expressions ("The sky is blue and leaves are green", [...] "the sky is blue") and ("brown cow", [...] "dangerous").|$|E
