25|$|<b>Candesartan</b> {{cilexetil}} (TCV 116) is a benzimidazole {{which was}} developed at Takeda {{and is an}} ester carbonate prodrug. In vivo, it is rapidly converted to the much more potent corresponding 7-carboxylic acid, <b>candesartan.</b> In the interaction of <b>candesartan</b> with AT1 receptor the carboxyl group of the benzimidazole ring plays an important role. <b>Candesartan</b> and its prodrug have stronger blood pressure lowering effects than EXP 3174 and losartan.|$|E
25|$|Valsartan, <b>candesartan</b> and {{irbesartan}} {{were all}} developed in 1990.|$|E
25|$|Losartan, valsartan, <b>candesartan,</b> irbesartan, {{telmisartan}} and olmesartan all {{contain a}} biphenyl-methyl group.|$|E
25|$|<b>Candesartan</b> and {{olmesartan}} {{have the}} highest affinity for the AT1 receptors, followed by irbesartan and eprosartan. Valsartan, telmisartan and EXP 3174 have similar affinities that are about ten-fold {{less than that of}} <b>candesartan.</b> Losartan has the least affinity. ARBs' affinity for the AT2 receptor is generally much lower (or around 10,000 times less) than for the AT1 subtype. Therefore they allow unhindered stimulation of the AT2 receptor.|$|E
25|$|In current medical practice, the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system's overactivity (and {{resultant}} hypertension) is {{more commonly}} reduced using either ACE inhibitors (such as ramipril and perindopril) or angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs, such as losartan, irbesartan or <b>candesartan)</b> {{rather than a}} direct oral renin inhibitor. ACE inhibitors or ARBs {{are also part of}} the standard treatment after a heart attack.|$|E
25|$|Olmesartan medoxomil was {{developed}} by Sankyo in 1995 and is the newest ARB on the market, marketed in 2002. It is an ester prodrug like <b>candesartan</b> cilexetil. In vivo, the prodrug is completely and rapidly hydrolyzed to the active acid form, olmesartan (RNH-6270). It has a hydroxyisopropyl group connected to the imidazole ring {{in addition to the}} carboxyl group.|$|E
25|$|Around 14% of orally {{ingested}} losartan is metabolized to its 5-carboxylic acid metabolite EXP 3174. As mentioned before, <b>candesartan</b> cilexetil and {{olmesartan medoxomil}} are inactive ester prodrugs that are completely hydrolyzed to their active forms by esterases during absorption from the gastrointestinal tract. These three metabolites are more potent AT1 receptor antagonists than their prodrugs. The other ARBs {{do not have}} active metabolites.|$|E
25|$|All of the ARBs {{have the}} same {{mechanism}} of action and differences in their potency {{can be related to}} their different pharmacokinetic profiles. A few clinical head-to-head comparisons have been made and <b>candesartan,</b> irbesartan and telmisartan appear to be slightly more effective than losartan in lowering blood pressure. This difference may be related to different strengths of activity at the receptor level, such as duration and strength of receptor binding.|$|E
25|$|All of the ARBs, {{except for}} {{valsartan}} and olmesartan, are metabolized {{in some way}} by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzyme 2C9, that {{is found in the}} human liver. CYP2C9 is for example responsible for the metabolizing of losartan to EXP 3174 and the slow metabolizing of valsartan and <b>candesartan</b> to their inactive metabolites. Telmisartan is, on the other hand, in part metabolized by glucuronidation and olmesartan is excreted as the unchanged drug.|$|E
25|$|Unless {{contraindicated}} or not tolerated, ACE inhibitor (ACE) {{therapy is}} recommended for all patients with systolic heart failure, irrespective of symptomatic severity or blood pressure. ACE inhibitors improve symptoms, decrease mortality and reduce ventricular hypertrophy. Angiotensin II receptor antagonist therapy (also referred to as AT1-antagonists or angiotensin receptor blockers), particularly using <b>candesartan,</b> is an acceptable alternative if the patient is unable to tolerate ACEI therapy. ACEIs and ARBs decrease afterload by antagonizing the vasopressor effect of angiotensin, thereby decreasing {{the amount of work}} the heart must perform. It is also believed that angiotensin directly affects cardiac remodeling, and blocking its activity can thereby slow the deterioration of cardiac function.|$|E
2500|$|The short-form {{names of}} {{clinical}} trials and other scientific studies constitute a large class of acronyms that includes many contrived examples, {{as well as}} many with a partial rather than complete correspondence of letters to expansion components. These trials tend to have full names that are accurately descriptive of what the trial is about but are thus also too long to serve practically as names within the syntax of a sentence, so a short name is also developed, which can serve as a syntactically useful handle and also provide at least a degree of mnemonic reminder as to the full name. Examples widely known in medicine include the ALLHAT trial (Antihypertensive and Lipid-Lowering Treatment to Prevent Heart Attack Trial) and the CHARM trial (<b>Candesartan</b> in Heart Failure: Assessment of Reduction in Mortality and Morbidity). The fact that RAS syndrome is often involved, as well as that the letters often don't entirely match, have sometimes been pointed out by annoyed researchers preoccupied by the idea that because the achetypal form of acronyms originated with one-to-one letter matching, there must be some moral impropriety in their ever deviating from that form. However, the [...] of clinical trial acronyms, as with gene and protein symbols, is simply to have a syntactically usable and recallable short name to complement the long name that is often syntactically unusable and not memorized. It is useful for the short name to give a reminder of the long name, which supports the reasonable censure of [...] "cutesy" [...] examples that provide little to no hint of it. But beyond that reasonably close correspondence, the short name's chief utility is in functioning cognitively as a name, rather than being a [...] and forgettable string, albeit faithful to the matching of letters. However, other reasonable critiques have been (1) that it is irresponsible to mention trial acronyms without explaining them at least once by providing the long names somewhere in the document, [...] and (2) that the proliferation of trial acronyms has resulted in ambiguity, such as 3 different trials all called ASPECT, which is another reason why failing to explain them somewhere in the document is irresponsible in scientific communication. At least one study has evaluated the citation impact and other traits of acronym-named trials compared with others, finding both good aspects (mnemonic help, name recall) and potential flaws (connotatively driven bias).|$|E
50|$|<b>Candesartan</b> is {{marketed as}} the cyclohexyl 1-hydroxyethyl {{carbonate}} (cilexetil) ester, known as <b>candesartan</b> cilexetil. <b>Candesartan</b> cilexetil is metabolised completely by esterases in the intestinal wall during absorption to the active <b>candesartan</b> moieity.|$|E
50|$|The {{use of a}} prodrug form {{increases}} the bioavailability of <b>candesartan.</b> Despite this, absolute bioavailability is relatively poor at 15% (<b>candesartan</b> cilexetil tablets) to 40% (<b>candesartan</b> cilexetil solution). Its IC50 is 15 µg/kg.|$|E

50|$|In a {{four-year}} randomized controlled trial, <b>candesartan</b> {{was compared to}} placebo to see whether it could prevent or postpone the development of full-blown hypertension in people with so-called prehypertension. During {{the first two years}} of the trial, half of participants were given <b>candesartan,</b> and the others received placebo; <b>candesartan</b> reduced the risk of developing hypertension by nearly two-thirds during this period. In the last two years of the study, all participants were switched to placebo. By the end of the study, <b>candesartan</b> had significantly reduced the risk of hypertension, by more than 15%. Serious side effects were actually more common among participants receiving placebo than in those given <b>candesartan.</b>|$|E
50|$|Losartan, irbesartan, olmesartan, <b>candesartan,</b> valsartan, fimasartan and azilsartan {{include the}} {{tetrazole}} group (a ring with four nitrogen and one carbon). Losartan, irbesartan, olmesartan, <b>candesartan,</b> and telmisartan include {{one or two}} imidazole groups.|$|E
50|$|As {{with other}} {{angiotensin}} II receptor antagonists, <b>candesartan</b> is indicated {{for the treatment}} of hypertension. Results from the CHARM study (early 2000s) demonstrated the morbidity and mortality reduction benefits of <b>candesartan</b> therapy in congestive heart failure. Thus, while ACE inhibitors are still considered first-line therapy in heart failure, <b>candesartan</b> can be used in combination with an ACE to achieve improved mortality and morbidity vs. an ACE alone and additionally is an alternative in patients intolerant of ACE inhibitor therapy.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Candesartan</b> (rINN) [...] is an {{angiotensin}} II receptor antagonist used {{mainly for}} the treatment of hypertension. The prodrug <b>candesartan</b> cilexetil is marketed by AstraZeneca and Takeda Pharmaceuticals, commonly under the trade names Diceran,Blopress, Atacand, Amias, and Ratacand. It is available in generic form.|$|E
50|$|Valsartan, <b>candesartan</b> and {{irbesartan}} {{were all}} developed in 1990.|$|E
50|$|The {{combination}} of felodipine and <b>candesartan</b> was marketed as Atacand.|$|E
50|$|Losartan, valsartan, <b>candesartan,</b> irbesartan, {{telmisartan}} and olmesartan all {{contain a}} biphenyl-methyl group.|$|E

50|$|The Curtius {{rearrangement}} {{is used in}} the syntheses of {{the drugs}} tranylcypromine, <b>candesartan,</b> bromadol, terguride, benzydamine, gabapentin, igmesine and tecadenoson.|$|E
5000|$|Angiotensin II {{receptor}} blockers {{are used}} {{primarily for the}} treatment of hypertension where the patient is intolerant of ACE inhibitor therapy. They do not inhibit the breakdown of bradykinin or other kinins, and are thus only rarely associated with the persistent dry cough and/or angioedema that limit ACE inhibitor therapy. More recently, they have been used {{for the treatment of}} heart failure in patients intolerant of ACE inhibitor therapy, in particular <b>candesartan.</b> Irbesartan and losartan have trial data showing benefit in hypertensive patients with type II diabetes, and may delay the progression of diabetic nephropathy. A 1998 double-blind study found [...] "that lisinopril improved insulin sensitivity whereas losartan did not affect it." [...] <b>Candesartan</b> is used experimentally in preventive treatment of migraine. Lisinopril has been found less often effective than <b>candesartan</b> at preventing migraine.|$|E
50|$|The CHARM-alternative trial {{showed a}} {{significant}} +52% (p=0.025) increase in myocardial infarction with <b>candesartan</b> (versus placebo) despite a reduction in blood pressure.|$|E
50|$|In a small {{study with}} 44 {{patients}} with chronic kidney disease without a history of diabetes, olmesartan was more effective in reducing daily urinary protein (proteinuria) than losartan, valsartan, and <b>candesartan.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Angiotensin {{receptor}} blockers — e.g. Hyzaar (with losartan), Co-Diovan or Diovan HCT (with valsartan), Teveten Plus (with eprosartan), Avalide or CoAprovel (with irbesartan), Atacand HCT or Atacand Plus (with <b>candesartan),</b> etc.|$|E
50|$|In a {{study of}} 108 {{patients}} with early morning blood pressure more than 135/85 mmHg, <b>Candesartan</b> showed significantly early morning Blood Pressure decreased over amlodipine, and also to ARBs, valsartan, losartan, telmisartan, but not olmesartan.|$|E
50|$|According to a {{study with}} 18 patients, {{telmisartan}} can replace valsartan and <b>candesartan</b> for hypertensive patients which have also diabetes type II because telmisartan has additional advantages of insulin sensitivity and antiatherosclerosis through probably its effects on PPAR-y.|$|E
50|$|The {{compound}} {{known as}} TCV-116 (<b>candesartan)</b> was studied by Japanese scientists using standard laboratory rats. Animal studies were published showing {{the effectiveness of}} the compound in 1992-1993, with a pilot study on humans published in the summer of 1993.|$|E
50|$|<b>Candesartan</b> is also {{available}} in a combination formulation with a low dose of the thiazide diuretic hydrochlorothiazide, to achieve an additive antihypertensive effect. Candesartan/hydrochlorothiazide combination preparations are marketed under various trade names including Atacand HCT, Hytacand, Blopress Plus, Advantec and Ratacand Plus.|$|E
50|$|An {{investigation}} {{found that the}} intern perceived that the instruction was to resume the patient's usual medication {{in addition to those}} already prescribed on the record. She mistakenly transcribed five medications (including <b>Candesartan,</b> Gliclazide, Metformin, Betaloc and Isordil) intended for another patient onto the record.|$|E
50|$|As {{aromatic}} compounds {{have been}} exhausted {{to a large}} extent as building blocks for life science products, N-heterocyclic structures prevail nowadays. They are found in many natural products, such as chlorophyll; hemoglobin; and the vitamins biotin, folic acid, niacin (PP), pyridoxine (vitamin B6), riboflavin (vitamin B2), and thiamine (vitamin B1). In synthetic life science products, N-heterocyclic moieties are widely diffuses both pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals. Thus, β-lactams are structural elements of penicillin and cephalosporin antibiotics, imidazoles are found both in modern herbicides, e.g. Arsenal (imazapyr) and pharmaceuticals, e.g. the antiulcerants Tagamet (cimetidine. see above) and Nexium (omeprazole), the antimycotics Daktarin (miconazole), Fungarest (ketoconazole) and Travogen (isoconazole). Tetrazoles and tetrazolidines are pivotal parts of the “sartan” class of hypertensives, e.g. <b>Candesartan</b> cilexetil (<b>candesartan),</b> Avapro (irbesartan), Cozaar (losartan) and Diovan (valsartan).|$|E
