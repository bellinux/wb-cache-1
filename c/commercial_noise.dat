40|$|Detecting and localising noise {{transmitters}} in the UHF band implicate difficulties {{because a}} great amount of reflectionsand diffractions occur. As one can see inthe theory part, predicting a precise propagation path to an arbitrary signal is a next to impossible undertaking. Therefore it is chosen to focus on being able to predict a probable path of the signal, and then be able to present amost likely placement of the noise transmitter. This paper will suggest a possible solution to the problem described above. The solution uses the fact that reflectedsignals is the same signal with slightly different delays and amplitudes due to the difference in propagation path. Thisis measured by using two antennas, the main antenna is pointing in the direction where the signal is strongest while thesecondary antenna beam is used to scan in the horizontal plane to identify signals as reflections. When the system has identified the different directions as either reflections or the shortest path to the receiver, theresult is presented on a screen using an aerial photo or a detailed map. The system then identifies strong reflectorsthatthe signal bounce off from, from this the signal is traced back to a possible location, in combination with the shortestmeasured path. Areas most probable to hold the noise transmitter is then presented on the map. The way the system measures the delays is to correlate the two signals from the antennas. This implies that the noisesignal need to have relatively good autocorrelation properties. It will be discussed whether this is the case, but theone <b>commercial</b> <b>noise</b> transmitter available on the Internet that could be found that actually indicate how the noisesignal is created, claims to be using pseudo random noise. This type of signals have very good autocorrelationproperties, hence the suggested system will be ideal to track this. Due to the fact that prediction of the path of a signal in the UHF band presents many difficulties regardingreflections,the first part of the paper focuses on collecting information regarding propagation in the UHF frequency band. Most ofthe information is collected from literature concerning mobile communications, as this is a big topic when planningmobile networks as the GSM. A lot of the literature discuss the layout and placement of transmitters for the bestpossible coverage. When trying to detect noise transmitters this has to be turned upside down, because one is measuringa signal and trying to answer where its origin is. To prove the concept a simulation is presented that generates a number of reflections, then uses an antenna to measurethem, before it correlates the different directions to find the shortest path. The simulation is then run a number oftimes to generate probabilities of detecting the correct direction $pm 5 ^circ$ of the real shortest signal direction. Results from this test show that when receiving a signal where the power is divided between all the reflections in theway $E_ 0 /N$ where $N$ is the number of reflections and $E_ 0 $ is 20 dB above the noise floor, and using an antenna withHPBW of 11. 18 $^circ$ gives correct measurements in 95 % of the cases. In the 5 % of cases where the system fails todetect the shortest path the combination of the shortest delayed signal with the strongest signal direction do notproduce a sufficiently high enough correlation peak for the detector to regard as a correlation point. In addition to these results there are done many measurements regarding the effect of antenna main lobe width, antennaside lobes, number of reflections, Gaussian and uniform background noise, and signal strength...|$|E

Recent research {{studies have shown that}} CMUTs have broad frequency bandwidth and high-transduction efficiency. One- and two-dimensional CMUT arrays of various sizes already have been fabricated, and their viability for medical imaging applications has been demonstrated. We fabricated 64 -element, forward-viewing annular arrays using the standard CMUT fabrication process and carried out experiments to measure the operating frequency, bandwidth, and transmit/receive efficiency of the array elements. The annular array elements, designed for imaging applications in the 20 MHz range, had a resonance frequency of 13. 5 MHz in air. The immersion pulse-echo data collected from a plane reflector showed that the devices operate in the 5 - 26 MHz range with a fractional bandwidth of 135 %. The output pressure at the surface of the transducer was measured to be 24 kPa/V. These values translate into a dynamic range of 131. 5 dB for I-V excitation in 1 -Hz bandwidth with a <b>commercial</b> low <b>noise</b> receiving circuitry.

40|$|This study {{estimates}} {{the impacts of}} <b>commercial</b> aviation <b>noise</b> at 181 airports around the world. These airports are located in 38 countries plus Taiwan, with 95 of the airports located in the United States. They {{are part of the}} 190 Shell 1 airports in the FAA's Model for Assessing Global Exposure to the Noise of Transport Aircraft (MAGENTA), which comprise an estimated 91 % of total global aviation noise exposure [FAA 2008]. The model calculates both physical and monetary impacts of aviation noise. The physical metrics are the number of people exposed to 55 dB or more noise, and the number of people highly annoyed. The model uses a noise depreciation index developed from hedonic pricing studies of housing transactions to monetize the effects on property owners in terms of housing value loss and rent changes. Due to data collection difficulties the impacts are only approximately consistent chronologically. Population data are from the years 2000 and 2001 depending on the country, while house prices and rents are 2006 estimates, and noise levels are for the year 2005. Based on there data, we calculated that around the 181 airports more than 14 million people are exposed to at least 55 dB of <b>commercial</b> aviation <b>noise.</b> Of these individuals, approximately 2. 3 million are highly annoyed. We found that the noise resulted in a total of $ 21 billion of housing value depreciation, which is equivalent to about $ 1. 1 billion per year using a 30 -year life of the house and a 3 % discount rate, and an additional $ 800 million of lost rent each year. The impacts are spread over all parts of the world. Although most of the airports included in this study are located in the US and Europe, each continent with an airport in the study had airports with greater than $ 100 million in housing value loss and greater than 200, 000 exposed people. (cont.) Furthermore, North America, Europe, and Asia each had examples of airports with an estimated $ 80 million in annualized housing value loss ($ 1 billion total), 400, 000 people exposed to 55 dB, and $ 25 million in yearly lost rent. We also examined potential changes to these impacts in the future for a scenario with no technological or operational advances to reduce noise (with the exception of retirement of older aircraft in the fleet). Based on an assumption of 2 - 3 % annual growth rates in operations at these airports between 2005 and 2035 with no noise-technology improvements, we found that the undiscounted housing value and rent loss could approximately double by 2035 while the population exposed to 55 dB and highly annoyed could increase by about 70 %.

The two-stage low noise amplifier is designed by <b>commercial</b> low <b>noise</b> HEMT devices, NE 321000. Two Lange couplers are located at output and input port of each amplifier stage to improve the return loss and to make LNA easily match to optimal low noise impendence. The cryogenic amplifier shows 30 dB gain and 0. 4 dB NF at 77 K in X-band. A very high rejection is necessary for the elimination of un-wanted spurious signals. The acceptable specification is 110 dB down at 500 MHz away from the band-edge of the filter. In general, the skirt rejection of a hairpin HTS filter is pretty good near the pass-band edge, but may become worse far from the pass-band edge. To meet the requirement of this commercial radar application, a high rejection suspended stripline filter is put after the low noise amplifier. The whole module shows an maximal NF of 1. 5 dB, a gain of 25 dB around pass-band frequencies, and a rejection of better than 110 dB at 500 MHz away from the band edge of the filter. It totally solves the interference problem in this dual mode radar. Index Terms—Cross-coupled hairpin filter, cryogenic low noise amplifier, HTS filter, RF front end, searching and tracting radar.
