It is {{demonstrated}} that, for the recently introduced classical magnetized Kepler problems in dimension 2 k + 1, the non-colliding orbits in the “external configuration space ” R 2 k+ 1 0 are all conics, moreover, a <b>conic</b> <b>orbit</b> is an ellipse, a parabola, and {{a branch of}} a hyperbola according as the total energy is negative, zero, and positive. It is also demonstrated that the Lie group SO + (1, 2 k + 1) × R+ acts transitively on both the set of oriented elliptic orbits and the set of oriented parabolic orbits...|$|E

40|$|In polar {{coordinate}} system, we consider fifteen classes of forces resulting in unlimited undisco-vered orbitals. The classic <b>conic</b> <b>orbits</b> {{are one of}} the special subclasses of the fifteen classes. Among the rest of the forces, we show a few instances displaying typical fresh orbitals. Aside from the common theoretical foundation, the specifics of the orbitals are given by the solution of cor-responding equations of motion. These are coupled nonlinear differential equations. Solving these equations numerically, utilizing a Computer Algebra System such as Mathematica is conducive to the orbits. Simulation of the orbitals provides a visual understanding about the motion {{under the influence of the}} generalized noncentral forces...|$|R
40|$|A Comet Penetrator-Lander is {{included}} in the payload of the Comet Rendezvous Asteroid Flyby spacecraft; it will be deployed from an orbit about the comet nucleus and will implant itself in the nucleus at a pre-selected site. Throughout the following 9 days, the orbiting spacecraft must be in position to receive transmissions from the Penetrator-Lander at specified intervals. Using <b>conic</b> <b>orbits</b> and a simplified model of the nucleus, several types of trajectories have been identified which will allow the data relay requirements to be met. These are sensitive to the mass and rotational properties of the comet nucleus and to the latitude of the Penetrator-Lander impact site; no single orbital strategy can cover the entire range of possibilities. Frequent spacecraft maneuvers would provide more flexibility, but would result in a much more complicated mission scenario. More accurate modeling of the comet nucleus and the orbiter trajectories will refine the relay orbit options presented here...|$|R

Three starting values based on recent refinements of previously obtained bounds on the solution are derived and tested numerically. Of these, a simple starting value based on a cubic approximation to Kepler's equation provides the most rapid convergence using both first and second order Newton algorithms. The performance of the starting values are compared with similar studies which used the restricted case of elliptical orbits with the initial epoch at periapse...|$|E

40|$|The {{method of}} {{variation}} of parameters {{still has a}} great interest and wide applications in mathematics, physics and astrodynamics. In this paper, universal functions (the Y's functions) based on Goodyear's time transformation formula were used to establish a variation of parameters method which is useful in slightly perturbed two-body initial value problem. Moreover due to its universality, the method avoids the switching among different <b>conic</b> <b>orbits</b> which are commonly occurring in space missions. The position and velocity vectors are written in terms of f and g series. The method is developed analytically and computationally. For the analytical developments, exact literal formulations for the differential system of variation of the epoch state vector are established. Symbolical series solution of the universal Kepler's equation was also established, and the literal analytical expressions of the coefficients of the series are listed in Horner form for efficient and stable evaluation. For computational developments of the method, an efficient algorithm was given using continued fraction theory. Finally, a short note on the method of solution was given just for the reader guidance...|$|R

A theoretical analysis of the problem becomes first once reduced to a Kepler problem and using the constants of motion: energy and angular momentum. It is obtained, in each case, the form of like <b>Conic</b> <b>orbits</b> with a focus on the center of mass. It continues with the implementation of an application of interactive simulation that allows the visualization of the conics given initial conditions, the calculation of the orbits in the gravitational case and its extension to other forces and graphical interactive visualization of the orbits calculated using different controls to the parameters of the problem and the initial conditions. The work is complemented providing teaching materials that help to the comprenhension of the analysis and the geometry of orbits in the gravitational case, and to investigate the behaviour of the orbits for different types of forces of interaction by means of the analysis of their effective potentials. The whole work has been thought to be useful in a education workshop led to high school students...|$|R

40|$|Celestial {{mechanics}} {{has traditionally}} been concerned with orbital motion under the action of a conservative gravitational potential. In particular, the inverse square gravitational force due to the potential of a uniform, spherical mass leads to a family of <b>conic</b> section <b>orbits,</b> as determined by Isaac Newton, who showed that Kepler‟s laws were derivable from his theory of gravitation. While orbital motion under the action of a conservative gravitational potential leads to an array of problems with often complex and interesting solutions, the addition of non-conservative forces offers new avenues of investigation. In particular, non-conservative forces lead to a rich diversity of {{problems associated with the}} existence, stability and control of families of highly non-Keplerian orbits generated by a gravitational potential and a non-conservative force. Highly non-Keplerian orbits can potentially have a broad range of practical applications across a number of different disciplines. This review aims to summarize the combined wealth of literature concerned with the dynamics, stability and control of highly non-Keplerian orbits for various low thrust propulsion devices, and to demonstrate some of these potential applications...|$|R
25|$|When {{only two}} {{gravitational}} bodies interact, their <b>orbits</b> follow a <b>conic</b> section. The <b>orbit</b> can be open (implying the object never returns) or closed (returning). Which it is {{depends on the}} total energy (kinetic + potential energy) of the system. In {{the case of an}} open orbit, the speed at any position of the orbit is at least the escape velocity for that position, {{in the case of a}} closed orbit, the speed is always less than the escape velocity. Since the kinetic energy is never negative, if the common convention is adopted of taking the potential energy as zero at infinite separation, the bound orbits will have negative total energy, the parabolic trajectories zero total energy, and hyperbolic orbits positive total energy.|$|R
40|$|QUICK {{provides}} the computer user with the facilities of a sophisticated desk calculator which can perform scalar, vector and matrix arithmetic, propagate <b>conic</b> <b>orbits,</b> determine planetary and satellite coordinates and perform other related astrodynamic calculations within a Fortran-like environment. QUICK is an interpreter, therefore {{eliminating the need}} to use a compiler or a linker to run QUICK code. QUICK capabilities include options for automated printing of results, the ability to submit operating system commands on some systems, and access to a plotting package (MASL) and a text editor without leaving QUICK. Mathematical and programming features of QUICK include the ability to handle arbitrary algebraic expressions, the capability to define user functions in terms of other functions, built-in constants such as pi, direct access to useful COMMON areas, matrix capabilities, extensive use of double precision calculations, and the ability to automatically load user functions from a standard library. The MASL (The Multi-mission Analysis Software Library) plotting package, included in the QUICK package, is a set of FORTRAN 77 compatible subroutines designed to facilitate the plotting of engineering data by allowing programmers to write plotting device independent applications. Its universality lies in the number of plotting devices it puts at the user's disposal. The MASL package of routines has proved very useful and easy to work with, yielding good plots for most new users on the first or second try. The functions provided include routines for creating histograms, "wire mesh" surface plots and contour plots as well as normal graphs with a large variety of axis types. The library has routines for plotting on cartesian, polar, log, mercator, cyclic, calendar, and stereographic axes, and for performing automatic or explicit scaling. The lengths of the axes of a plot are completely {{under the control of the}} program using the library. Programs written to use the MASL subroutines can be made to output to the Calcomp 1055 plotter, the Hewlett-Packard 2648 graphics terminal, the HP 7221, 7475 and 7550 pen plotters, the Tektronix 40 xx and 41 xx series graphics terminals, the DEC VT 125 /VT 240 graphics terminals, the QMS 800 laser printer, the Sun Microsystems monochrome display, the Ridge Computers monochrome display, the IBM/PC color display, or a "dumb" terminal or printer. Programs using this library can be written so that they always use the same type of plotter or they can allow the choice of plotter type to be deferred until after program execution. QUICK is written in RATFOR for use on Sun 4 series computers running SunOS. No source code is provided. The standard distribution medium for this program is a. 25 inch streaming magnetic tape cartridge in UNIX tar format. An electronic copy of the documentation in ASCII format is included on the distribution medium. QUICK was developed in 1991 and is a copyrighted work with all copyright vested in NASA...|$|R
