5|$|A 1905 {{review of}} the Falmouth defences {{concluded}} that the naval artillery at St Mawes had become superfluous, as the necessary guns could be mounted at combination of Pendennis and the recently re-established battery at St Anthony's instead. Disarmed, St Mawes was then used as a barracks in the First World War. In 1920 the castle {{was transferred to the}} control of the government's Office of Works, and was opened to visitors, being promoted as a tourist destination by the Great Western Railway <b>company</b> <b>who</b> hoped to profit by increased numbers of visitors to Falmouth.|$|E

5|$|From the mid-18th century, a {{succession}} of public buildings were erected in the town. St Paul's Church, now demolished, was among the first, while the old Town Hall and the present Cutlers' Hall were among the major works of the 19th century. The town's water supply was improved by the Sheffield Waterworks <b>Company,</b> <b>who</b> built reservoirs around the town. Parts of Sheffield were devastated when, following a five-year construction project, the Dale Dyke dam collapsed on Friday 11 March 1864, resulting in the Great Sheffield Flood.|$|E

Claiborne optimistically called his new colony Rich Island, but Spanish power in the area was too strong and the colony was destroyed in 1642.|$|E

5|$|Initially Boutonnat and Dahan {{found it}} {{difficult}} to find a record <b>company</b> <b>who</b> would release the track, either because labels were worried about the song being censored due to the sexual nature of its lyrics or because they did not see any commercial potential in the track.

Only after a third appointment with RCA did the label's Francis Dacla give them a contract.|$|E
