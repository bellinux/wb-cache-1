40|$|Graders {{are used}} for ground grading or levelling. The desired profile is {{achieved}} by passing the machine over the ground surface with appropriately positioned grader blade. Grading errors are caused mainly by vertical displacements of grader front wheels. These displacements, despite a considerable wheel base of the grader, are transferred through the frame onto the grade blade. Moreover the quality of surface levelling is also influenced by the <b>compliancies</b> of the ground, the chassis and the blade suspension system. In the paper a blade stabilization system is proposed. The blade adjustment system with hydraulically driven mechanism is controlled using position signals from the selected points of the machine. ...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{role that}} plastic-frictional energy {{dissipation}} in the {{fracture process zone}} plays in the work-of-fracture method for measuring the fracture energy of concrete or other quasibrittle materials is analyzed, and a possible improvement of this method is proposed. It is shown that by measuring the unloading compliance at {{a sufficient number of}} states on the post-peak descending load-deflection curve, it is possible to calculate the pure fracture energy, representing the energy dissipated by the fracture process alone. However, this value of fracture energy is pertinent only if the material model (constitutive law and fracture law) used in structural analysis takes into account separately the fracture-damage deformations and the plastic-frictional deformations. Otherwise, one must use the conventional fracture energy, which includes plastic-frictional energy dissipation. Either type of fracture energy should properly be determined by extrapolation to infinite specimen size. Further, it is shown that the unloading <b>compliancies</b> {{to be used in the}} calculation of the pure fracture energy can be corrected to approximately eliminate the time-dependent effects (material viscoelasticity) and reverse plasticity. Finally, it is proposed to improve the work-of-fracture method by averaging the work done by fracture over only a central portion of the ligament. However, experiments are needed to check whether the specimen size required for this improved method would not be impracticably large...|$|R

50|$|On 7 March 1942, Horthy forced Bárdossy's {{resignation}} {{in favour}} of the more moderate Miklós Kállay. Exactly why Horthy decided to remove Bárdossy is unclear, but some possible reasons include Bárdossy’s unwillingness {{to stand up to}} Germany, his <b>compliancy</b> to Hungary’s far-right and growing increasing Hungarian troop levels and casualties in the Soviet Union. Perhaps the primary reason that Horthy dismissed Bárdossy, however, was that Bárdossy successfully opposed a plan by Horthy that would have elevated his son, Miklós Jr, to the regency after Miklós Horthy’s death. After resigning as prime minister, Bárdossy became chairman of the Fascist United Christian National League in 1943. After the German occupation of Hungary in 1944, Bárdossy and his followers collaborated with Prime Minister Döme Sztójay. Later on, they collaborated with Ferenc Szálasi’s Arrow Cross Party. He fled from Szombathely due to Soviet advance in Hungary and moved initially to Bavaria, then to Innsbruck. He obtained entry visa to Switzerland in 24 April 1945 and lived briefly a refugee camp. However, Swiss government deported back to Germany him due to he demanded freedom of movement as diplomat in 4 May 1945. He was immediately arrested by Americans.|$|E
50|$|A {{fax server}} is a {{collection}} of software modules which allow users to send and receive fax messages directly from their desktop from email and/or document workflow applications. A fax server is equipped with either a hardware-based fax card or a software emulator, based on the T.38 protocol to send faxes over Internet Protocol (IP). Users are able to communicate with the fax server either on a Local Area Network (LAN) or over the Internet. Organizations tend to use a fax server to benefit from both an operational cost perspective (i.e., phone lines, supplies, maintenance) and a human resource perspective (i.e., travel to and from the fax machine, as well as prolonged waiting periods at the physical device). A fax server permits organizations to maintain an audit trail of all of the fax transactions, hence enables <b>compliancy</b> with legislations and mandates, such as Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and Sarbanes-Oxley (SOX). An argument can also be made that because faxing via fax servers is a paperless solution, it innately allows organizations in their goal to be environment-friendly, by reducing their overall carbon footprint.|$|E

50|$|Born in Budapest to a Catholic family, Imrédy studied {{law as a}} {{young man}} before he started working for the Hungarian Ministry of Finance. Eventually {{becoming}} a skilled economist and financier, Imrédy was made Director of the Hungarian National Bank in 1928. In 1932, he was appointed Minister of Finance under the fascist Prime Minister Gyula Gömbös. After resigning in 1935, Imrédy became President of the Hungarian National Bank. Extremely ambitious, Imrédy was known to hold right wing views on matters of domestic and social policy. On matters of foreign policy, Imrédy was pro-British, a sentiment which was to help him gain the position of Minister of Economic Coordination under Prime Minister Kálmán Darányi. When Darányi resigned in May 1938, Imrédy was appointed prime minister by Regent Miklós Horthy. Imrédy’s attempts to improve Hungary’s diplomatic relations with Britain initially made him very unpopular with Germany and Italy. Imrédy realized that he could not afford to alienate the two fascist powers on a long term basis, however, and from the autumn of 1938 onward his foreign policy became increasingly pro-German and pro-Italian. Imrédy also worked to gain a base of power in Hungarian right wing politics, founding the Movement of Hungarian Life. He was quick to suppress any rivals in his quest for power, and influential fascists such as Ferenc Szálasi were harassed by Imrédy’s administration. As Imrédy drifted further to the right, he proposed that the government be reorganized along totalitarian lines and enacted legislation that restricted the freedom of the press and caused many Jews to suffer economically.In February 1939, Imrédy’s moderate political opponents, angered at his growing <b>compliancy</b> to Germany and Hungary’s right wing, presented evidence to Regent Horthy that suggested Imrédy's great-grandfather was Jewish. When Horthy confronted Imrédy with the evidence, Imrédy could not deny the claims about his heritage and resigned the premiership on 13 February 1939. Imrédy served in the Hungarian Army for a time in 1940, and in October of that year he founded the pro-fascist, Anti-Semitic Party of Hungarian Renewal. When German troops occupied Hungary in 1944, Imrédy was German Plenipotentiary Edmund Veesenmayer’s top choice to replace Miklós Kállay as prime minister. Horthy could not be swayed to accept the idea, however, and Döme Sztójay was made prime minister instead. Imrédy became Sztójay’s Minister of Economic Coordination in May 1944, but he was forced to resign in August. After German forces were driven out of Hungary, Imrédy was arrested and tried by a People’s Tribunal in November 1945. Found guilty of war crimes and collaboration with the Nazis, he was sentenced to death and executed by a firing squad in the courtyard of the Marko jail in Budapest in 1946.|$|E
