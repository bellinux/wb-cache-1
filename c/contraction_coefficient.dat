40|$|The data-processing inequality, that is, I(U;Y) < I(U;X) for a Markov chain U → X → Y, {{has been}} the method of choice for proving impossibility (converse) results in {{information}} theory and many other disciplines. Various channel-dependent improvements (called strong data-processing inequalities, or SDPIs) of this inequality have been proposed both classically and more recently. In this note we first survey known results relating various notions of contraction for a single channel. Then we consider the basic extension: given SDPI for each constituent channel in a Bayesian network, how to produce an end-to-end SDPI? Our approach {{is based on the}} (extract of the) Evans-Schulman method, which is demonstrated for three different kinds of SDPIs, namely, the usual Ahslwede-Gács type <b>contraction</b> <b>coefficients</b> (mutual information), Dobrushin's <b>contraction</b> <b>coefficients</b> (total variation), and finally the F_I-curve (the best possible non-linear SDPI for a given channel). Resulting bounds on the <b>contraction</b> <b>coefficients</b> are interpreted as probability of site percolation. As an example, we demonstrate how to obtain SDPI for an n-letter memoryless channel with feedback given an SDPI for n= 1. Finally, we discuss a simple observation on the equivalence of a linear SDPI and comparison to an erasure channel (in the sense of "less noisy" order). This leads to a simple proof of a curious inequality of Samorodnitsky (2015), and sheds light on how information spreads in the subsets of inputs of a memoryless channel...|$|R

The coefficients of inclined gates with a vertical lip are investigated theoretically by using the method of conformal mapping.

40|$|The {{description}} of substituent groups, attached to an organic skeleton, {{by means of}} basis sets of lower quality {{with respect to the}} rest of the molecule, has been investigated and tested. Starting from a double‐zeta Gaussian basis, two successive reductions of the basis set dimensions have been envisaged: the first is simply a contraction to single zeta, the second consists in constructing ‘‘supercontracted’’ basis functions as linear combinations of AOs centered on different atoms of the same substituent group. An optimization of <b>contraction</b> and ‘‘supercontraction’’ <b>coefficients</b> at the molecular level leads to much better results for the energy and other molecular properties, in comparison with the common practice of using the contraction based on atomic calculations. An unbalanced description, potentially implied in using basis sets of different quality in the same calculation, is thus avoided.

40|$|Data {{processing}} inequalities for f-divergences can be sharpened using contraction coefficients {{to produce}} strong data processing inequalities. These contraction coefficients {{turn out to}} provide useful optimization problems for learning likelihood models. Moreover, the <b>contraction</b> <b>coefficient</b> for χ^ 2 -divergence admits a particularly simple linear algebraic solution due to its relation to maximal correlation. Propelled by this context, we analyze the relationship between various contraction coefficients for f-divergences and the <b>contraction</b> <b>coefficient</b> for χ^ 2 -divergence. In particular, we prove that the latter coefficient {{can be obtained from}} the former coefficients by driving the input f-divergences to zero.

The influence of cavitation on the characteristic phenomenon of hydraulic flip is observed for both circular and noncircular shaped orifices. For certain intermediate orifice lengths, some noncircular shapes are shown to produce more fully developed flows (shorter recovery lengths) and therefore a more cohesive jet, which in turn yields slightly higher cold flow mixing uniformities than circular shaped orifices of equal absolute length. The particular noncircular shaped elements evaluated are shown to be more sensitive to liquid stream misimpingement than the corresponding circular orifices...|$|R
