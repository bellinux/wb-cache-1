50|$|However, unlike today's {{electrically}} powered fuel injection systems, the 300 SL's mechanical fuel pump {{would continue to}} inject gasoline into the engine during the interval between shutting off the ignition and the engine's coming to a stop; this unburned gasoline washed lubricating oil from the cylinder walls, which not only left them unprotected in affected areas during start-up but would dilute the engine's entire oil supply if the car was not driven hard or long enough to reach a sufficient temperature to evaporate the gas out of the oil. To reduce this dilution by gasoline when stopping the engine, the owner's manual advised Turn the ignition key to the left while idling. Do not on any account {{try to stop the}} engine at a higher speed. Exacerbating the problem was the engine's large racing-oriented oil cooler and enormous 10 L oil capacity, which virtually guaranteed the oil would not get hot enough. In practice, many owners would block off airflow through the oil cooler and stick rigidly to the appropriately low 1000 mi recommended oil change interval. An auxiliary fuel pump provided additional fuel for extended high speed operation or cold starts; overuse would also lead to dilution of the oil., Clutch operation was initially very heavy, remedied by an improved <b>clutch</b> <b>arm</b> helper spring which reduced pedal force. From March 1963 to the end of production later that year, a light alloy crankcase was used on a total of 209 vehicles.|$|E
