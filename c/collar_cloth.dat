50|$|Serbian Volunteer Corps troops {{received}} Yugoslav or Italian uniforms {{on which}} they wore black <b>cloth</b> <b>collar</b> patches, rank badges on the shoulder straps, and a metal corps badge on the right breast. Their helmets were Italian.|$|R

50|$|The most known form of {{distinctive}} {{clothing for}} the priest is the easily identifiable clerical collar (or Roman collar), which takes form {{in either the}} traditional cassock, or modern day clerical shirt. The typical modern version consists of a white plastic tab, inserted into a specially made collar of a black shirt, although traditional <b>cloth</b> <b>collars</b> are still worn.|$|R
25|$|Within {{a mile of}} Calais, she was {{received}} by the earl of Southampton, Lord Admiral, with the lord William Howard, Sir Francis Brian, the lord Grey of Wilton, the lord Hastings, lord Clifford, lord Herbert, lord Tailbush, Sir Thomas Seymour, Sir Henry Knyvett, Mr. Gregory Cromwell, with “xxiiij” gentlemen in coats of satin damask and velvet, besides the said lords, who wore three <b>collars</b> of <b>cloth</b> of gold and purple velvet and chains of gold, and 200 yeomen, , in the King's colours, red and blue cloth. “Then the King's ships off Newland as she came by them let 200 shots of guns,” after which the town of Calais shot 300 pieces of ordnance.|$|R
5|$|The Regency period saw a {{shift in}} fashion that was largely {{determined}} by George. After political opponents put a tax on wig powder, he abandoned wearing a powdered wig in favour of natural hair. He wore darker colours than had been previously fashionable as they helped to disguise his size, favoured pantaloons and trousers over knee breeches because they were looser, and popularised a high <b>collar</b> with neck <b>cloth</b> because it hid his double chin. His visit to Scotland in 1822 led to the revival, if not the creation, of Scottish tartan dress {{as it is known}} today.|$|R
5000|$|In 1891 Sick Berth {{personnel}} {{received a}} new style of uniform. Instead of the blue serge jumper, blue <b>cloth</b> <b>collar</b> and bell bottom trousers, known as ‘Square Rig, they received a single or double breasted jacket and trousers with black buttons, red badges and a peaked cap. This was known as ‘fore and aft’ rig, and issued to ‘all ratings not dressed as seamen. This uniform was also issued to tradesmen known as [...] "Artificers", who were collectively known as [...] "Tiffies". So it was natural that sick berth attendants were also known as [...] "Sick Berth Tiffies".|$|R

"It {{was then}} also, {{as he told}} me, that he lost contact for good and all {{with one of those}} three men who the summer before had been going about through all the little towns in the foothills of his country. They would arrive on market days driving in a peasant's cart, and would set up an office in an inn or some other Jew's house. There were three of them, of whom one with a long beard looked venerable; and they had red <b>cloth</b> <b>collars</b> round their necks and gold lace on their sleeves like Government officials. They sat proudly behind a long table; and in the next room, so that the common people shouldn't hear, they kept a cunning {{telegraph}} machine, through which they could talk to the Emperor of America. The fathers hung about the door, but the young men of the mountains would crowd up to the table asking many questions, for there was work to be got all the year round at three dollars a day in America, and no military service to do.|$|R
6000|$|All hail to the Emperor! {{we would}} give his costume, {{were it not}} rather {{too much in the}} style of the von Chronicles. Reader! you have seen a {{portrait}} of Charles by Holbein: very well; what need is there of a description? No lack was there in this gay scene of massy chains and curious <b>collars,</b> nor of <b>cloth</b> of gold, nor of cloth of silver! No lack was there of trembling plumes and costly hose! No lack was there of crimson velvet, and russet velvet, and tawny velvet, and purple velvet, and plunket velvet, and of scarlet cloth, and green taffeta, and cloth of silk embroidered! No lack was there of garments of estate, and of quaint chemews, nor of short crimson cloaks, covered with pearls and precious stones! No lack was there of party-coloured splendour, of purple velvet embroidered with white, and white satin dresses embroidered with black! No lack was there of splendid koyfes of damask, or kerchiefs of fine Cyprus; nor of points of Venice silver of ducat fineness, nor of garlands of friars' knots, nor of coloured satins, nor of bleeding hearts embroidered on the bravery of dolorous lovers, nor of quaint sentences of wailing gallantry! But for the details, are they not to be found in those much-neglected and much-plundered persons, the old chroniclers? and will they not sufficiently appear in the most inventive portion of the next great historical novel? ...|$|R
5000|$|At Leeds Ionescu designed, {{created and}} {{implanted}} in the mitral position in humans, {{for the first time}} ever, porcine aortic valves attached to a Teflon <b>cloth</b> <b>collar,</b> starting in February 1967. This was followed by the creation of the Dacron covered titanium frame for mounting the porcine aortic valves to be able to implant them in all three cardiac locations (mitral, aortic, tricuspid). With various modifications and improvements, these stent mounted valves had been implanted in 87 patients between February 1967 and March 1969. All these valves were treated with formaldehyde and this was the main reason for their limited durability.In a continuous search to create a tissue heart valve which could be used without anticoagulant treatment, Ionescu created a novel artificial valve. Using autologous fascia lata tissue (the fibrous membrane which covers the outside aspect of the thigh muscles) taken from the patient and used to construct the valve during the operation by mounting the living fascia on a Dacron-covered titanium frame {{in the shape of a}} three cusp valve. He began the clinical implantation of these valves in April 1969. This procedure of valve construction and implantation had been used in many centres in the world for about three years until it was realised that fascia lata did not perform well over longer periods of time in the high pressure environment of the left heart.These valves became incompetent after various durations post implantation - from 3 to 12 years. However, two important facts were established by the use of such valves. The haemodynamic performance in both mitral and aortic positions was superior to all known artificial heart valves and that the risk of thrombosis and embolisation was minimal when compared with mechanical valves. Freehand insertion of stentless fascia lata aortic valves was also used in a small number of cases with similar results.|$|R
25|$|On 1 March 1901 the Australian Army {{was formed}} {{following}} {{the transfer of}} colonial forces. Universal service dress was introduced in 1902 and was worn at all times, including in the field, except for formal occasions requiring full dress. This uniform included a peaked cap, tunic, and trousers, with officers wearing a Sam Browne belt. Officers of the mounted arm wore breeches and boots, while the rest worn puttees. The different arms and corps were distinguished by the colour of the braid trimming on the shoulder straps. A wide-brimmed slouch hat was worn with one side turned up by troops overseas. The rising sun badge was first worn at this time by battalions of the Australian Commonwealth Horse on active service in South Africa, while some Queensland units wore emu plumes in their hats. During this period it remained common to follow the British system, with the uniform subsequently adopted by the Commonwealth consisting of a General Service Dress which, {{in order to achieve}} financial savings, could be converted into Full Dress for ceremonial occasions simply by the addition of a number of lace accoutrements, including aiguillettes, as well as breast-lines and girdles. The uniform consisted of a khaki serge jacket, with slouch hat and breeches. <b>Cloth</b> <b>collar</b> patches were worn, as well as coloured piping on the jacket, with rosettes or plumes on the hat, and regimental badges. The introduction of universal service in 1912 resulted in the adoption of a number of changes due to the need to economise following the rapid expansion of the Army. The uniform provide for at this time was relatively simple, consisting of a hat, heavy woollen khaki shirt, cord breeches and boots. To distinguish between units and corps a coloured cloth hat band with a metal numeral was worn. Officers kept their jackets, and later approval was given to wear open collars with shirt and tie.|$|R
