5000|$|Lactiferous duct {{development}} {{occurs in}} females {{in response to}} circulating hormones. First development is frequently seen during pre- and postnatal stages, and later during puberty. Estrogen promotes branching differentiation, whereas in males testosterone inhibits it. A mature duct tree reaching the limit of the fat pad of the mammary gland comes into being by bifurcation of duct terminal end buds (TEB), secondary branches sprouting from primary ducts and proper duct lumen formation. These processes are tightly modulated by components of mammary epithelial ECM interacting with systemic hormones and local secreting factors. However, for each mechanism the epithelial cells' [...] "niche" [...] can be delicately unique with different membrane receptor profiles and basement membrane thickness from specific branching area to area, so as to regulate cell growth or differentiation sub-locally. Important players include beta-1 integrin, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), laminin-1/5, collagen-IV, matrix metalloproteinase(MMPs), heparan sulfate proteoglycans, and others. Elevated circulating level of growth hormone and estrogen get to multipotent cap cells on TEB tips through a thin, leaky layer of basement membrane. These hormones promote specific gene expression. Hence cap cells can differentiate into myoepithelial and luminal (duct) epithelial cells, and the increased amount of activated MMPs can degrade surrounding ECM helping duct buds to reach further in the fat pads. On the other hand, basement membrane along the mature mammary ducts is thicker, with strong adhesion to epithelial cells via binding to integrin and non-integrin receptors. When side branches develop, it {{is a much more}} “pushing-forward” working process including extending through myoepithelial cells, degrading basement membrane and then invading into a periductal layer of fibrous stromal tissue. Degraded basement membrane fragments (laminin-5) roles to lead the way of mammary epithelial cells migration. Whereas, laminin-1 interacts with non-integrin receptor dystroglycan negatively regulates this side branching process in case of cancer. These complex [...] "Yin-yang" [...] balancing <b>crosstalks</b> <b>between</b> mammary ECM and epithelial cells [...] "instruct" [...] healthy mammary gland development until adult.|$|E

These examples demonstrate the critical roles that crosstalk plays in regulating cell signaling pathways. Recently, however, non-histone crosstalk has been observed between serine/threonine phosphorylation and the modification of arginine and lysine residues within kinase consensus sequences. Interestingly, many kinase consensus sequences contain critical arginine/lysine residues surrounding the substrate serine/threonine residue. Therefore, we hypothesize that non-histone <b>crosstalk</b> <b>between</b> serine/threonine phosphorylation and arginine/lysine modifications is a global mechanism for the modulation of cellular signaling. In this review, we discuss several recent examples of non-histone kinase consensus sequence crosstalk, {{as well as provide}} the biophysical basis for these observations.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{potential}} of mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) to differentiate into functional bone forming cells provides {{an important tool}} for bone regeneration. The identification of factors that trigger osteoblast differentiation in MSCs is therefore critical to promote the osteogenic {{potential of}} human MSCs. In this study, we used microarray analysis to identify signalling molecules that promote osteogenic differentiation in human bone marrow stroma derived MSCs. Results Microarray analysis and validation experiments showed that the expression of IGF 2 and IGFBP 2 was increased together with integrin alpha 5 (ITGA 5) during dexamethasone-induced osteoblast differentiation in human MSCs. This effect was functional since we found that IGF 2 and IGFBP 2 enhanced the expression of osteoblast phenotypic markers and in vitro osteogenic capacity of hMSCs. Interestingly, we showed that downregulation of endogenous ITGA 5 using specific shRNA decreased IGF 2 and IGFBP 2 expression in hMSCs. Conversely, ITGA 5 overexpression upregulated IGF 2 and IGFBP 2 expression in hMSCs, which indicates tight <b>crosstalks</b> <b>between</b> these molecules. Consistent with this concept, activation of endogenous ITGA 5 using a specific antibody that primes the integrin, or a peptide that specifically activates ITGA 5 increased IGF 2 and IGFBP 2 expression in hMSCs. Finally, we showed that pharmacological inhibition of FAK/ERK 1 / 2 -MAPKs or PI 3 K signalling pathways that are enhanced by ITGA 5 activation, blunted IGF 2 and IGFBP 2 expression in hMSCs. Conclusion The results show that ITGA 5 is a key mediator of IGF 2 and IGFBP 2 expression that promotes osteoblast differentiation in human MSCs, and reveal that <b>crosstalks</b> <b>between</b> ITGA 5 and IGF 2 /IGFBP 2 signalling are important mechanisms that trigger osteogenic differentiation in human bone marrow derived mesenchymal stromal cells. </p...|$|E
40|$|Autophagy is {{a highly}} conserved {{cellular}} process occurring during periods of stress to ensure a cell's survival by recycling cytosolic constituents and making products {{that can be used}} in energy generation and other essential processes. Three major forms of autophagy exist according to the specific mechanism through which cytoplasmic material is transported to a lysosome.

Microautophagy is a less selective form of autophagy that occurs through lysosomal membrane invaginations, forming tubes and directly engulfing cytoplasm.
