5000|$|One of {{the main}} {{characteristics}} of a battlestar, as seen on many episodes, {{is its ability to}} absorb tremendous damage while withstanding a prolonged attack and survive. To accomplish this all the ships essential and systems needed to keep the ship combat effective such as magazines, engineering spaces, steering, plotting rooms, command & control, weapons, etc. are protected by heavy armour. In the original 1978 TV series it is said Galactica's hull in 3-4 meters (9.8-13.1 feet) thick. For comparison the armor bulkhead of an Iowa class battleship is 30.7-40 centimeters (12.1-17.3 inches/1-1.5 feet) in thickness. The armour box, referred to as the citadel, is situated inside the ship and encases all the ships vital and essential functions. Critical systems located outside the citadel are encased in a ‘mini’ citadel as armoured extensions {{of the main}} citadel. The Citadel its self is highly subcompartmentalized by armour bulkheads, most notable, besides the hull armour and the actual armour bulkheads that makeup the citadel itself, are the eternal armour bulkheads. This ensures that if it is breached the breach can be contained {{and the rest of the}} citadel not compromised. Of these the most crucial are centerline bulkhead which divide the citadel into starboard and port sections, and the transverse <b>centreline</b> <b>bulkhead</b> which divides the citadel into bow and stern sections. These provide the stability that ensures the citadel does not collapse in on its self that that projectiles, should they penetrate the main armour bulkhead and the armoured walls of citadel itself, do not continue any further and comprise the rest of the citadel. In theory only half of the citadel needs to remain intact for the ship to remain operational. As both starboard and port sides are contain essentially identical equipment for the sake of redundancy.|$|E
