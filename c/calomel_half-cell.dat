40|$|Although not {{strictly}} correct we shall use 'concentration' instead of 'activity'. ISE respond to activity, {{but we do}} not use standards with known activity, so we cannot express our results on the activity scale. The term 'concentration ' is incorrect, too, as the calcula-tion of sample concentration from standard concentration is allowed only when the matrix of the ion in both solutions is the same, and this is not the case. An increasing number of clinical laboratories use direct potentiometry for the measurement of sodium and potassium in whole blood, plasma, or serum. Apart from being superior to flame-photometry with respect to the measurement ofthe ionic activities in the plasma-water phase instead of the measure-ment of these ions in 'whole plasma', 1 - 3 the analysis with ion-selective electrodes (ISE) in an undiluted sample can be performed with heparinised whole blood, and this feature makes direct potentiometry suitable for stat-analysis. A condition for the analysis in whole blood is that the sodium and potassium concentrations- in plasma and whole blood from the same patient are identical and thatthe influence ofthe haematocrit is negligible. Several authors considered the possible difference between the sodium and potassium concentrations in whole blood or plasma, respectively. Moore et aU measured the sodium concentration in fresh blood and in plasma from nine subjects with a sodium-selective glass electrode and a fibre-type <b>calomel</b> <b>half-cell</b> as reference electrode. They found no significant difference. Miyada et al. 5 found an 'excellent correlation ' between sodium and potassium measurements of whole blood with corresponding plasma from nine individuals. Their measurement...|$|E
40|$|Isolated {{and cleaned}} squid giant axons were {{internally}} perfused by {{a modification of}} the method of Adelman and Gilbert (1964) and Adelman and Fok (1964). A chemically driven syringe (Sage Instruments) was directly connected to the axon interior through a small cut in one end {{by means of a}} 200, / diameter glass cannula. The internal axoplasm was eroded away upon continuous internal fluid flow of about 10 l/min. A carefully platinized axial platinum wire, 100 u in diameter, was inserted through a large outflow hole {{at the other end of}} the axon. Both the outflow and inflow holes were electrically insulated from the external physiological salt solutions bathing the central 15 mm length of the axon by external flowing dextrose guards. The axial wire was used to pass current to external guard and current measuring electrodes either to excite the axon electrically to produce membrane responses or to control the membrane voltage in the voltage clamp. A glass micropipette electrode (3 M KC 1 bridge to a <b>calomel</b> <b>half-cell)</b> was inserted just through the membrane for potential recording with respect to an external Ag, AgCl reference electrode. The point-control voltage clamp system was used (Cole and Moore, 1960), and membrane currents were measured over a 2 mm central length of axon. The microelectrode was located at the midpoint of the 2 mm long region. Potential differences between the external reference electrode and the tip electrode were balanced to zero for each of the external solutions. Osmolarities of all perfusion solutions were adjusted to that of artificial sea water by making measurements of osmolarity with a vapor pressure osmometer. All solutions were adjusted to a pH of 7. 4...|$|E
