Rheological properties of the <b>cement</b> slurries and <b>cement</b> particles shape and surface texture were tested. The dilatancy of the <b>cement</b> slurries was evaluated by the form of the flow curves and by the calculated dilatancy factor.

The yield stress of GGBS <b>cement</b> slurry is about 1. 8 times and 1. 6 times respectively greater than Portland <b>cement</b> slurry. The yield stress and viscosity of GGBS <b>cement</b> slurry increases about 2 times more than this of the slurry of Portland <b>cement</b> with increasing the <b>cement</b> volume concentration.

In this study, the effects of superfine <b>cement</b> on the packing density of <b>cement</b> (directly measured by a wet packing test), the water film thickness of <b>cement</b> paste (taken as the excess water to solid surface area ratio), and the flowability, rheology and strength of <b>cement</b> paste were investigated. The results showed that the addition of 10 % to 20 % superfine <b>cement</b> can significantly increase the packing density of the <b>cement</b> and the water film thickness of the <b>cement</b> paste. Such increases in packing density and water film thickness would then improve the flowability, rheology and strength of the <b>cement</b> paste.
