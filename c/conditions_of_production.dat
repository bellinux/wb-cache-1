25|$|The {{theory of}} law as {{normative}} patterns in a normative field {{was developed by}} Anna Christensen {{in a number of}} published articles following the book Residential Right in the Tenement House (1994). The theory is based on the thesis that different basic normative patterns can be distinguished in the multitude of legal norms. As social life is quite complex, these normative patterns do not make up the ‘hierarchical legal system’ we frequently imagine. Instead, these patterns are being set into play in a normative field as determined by the different basic patterns, which also act as normative poles. Another component of the theoretical framework is the functional relationship between the legal system and the structure of society and conditions of economic production, elaborated in the work of Professor Ann Numhauser-Henning. The basic normative patterns are held to reflect normative practices functional to society and human relationships. They thus reflect – and codify – social normative conceptions and practices aimed at making long-lasting human relationships and sustainable societies possible, and they are closely related to societal conditions. Changes in the underlying <b>conditions</b> <b>of</b> <b>production</b> provide explanations for many of the movements in the normative field and the new legal institutions, which have arisen to satisfy fundamental normative demands. However, the basic normative patterns all represent enduring legitimate normative conceptions in society, and it is the task of legislators and courts to balance these conceptions within the framework of law.|$|E

In these countries there would never be any deficiency of capital, if its increase were never checked or brought to a stand by too great a diminution of its returns. It is the tendency of the returns to a progressive diminution which causes the increase of production to be often attended with a deterioration in the condition of the producers; and this tendency, which would in time put an end to increase of production altogether, {{is a result of the}} necessary and inherent <b>conditions</b> <b>of</b> <b>production</b> from the land.|$|E

60|$|The {{ultimate}} fact in economics is that Nature only yields commodities {{as the result}} of labor. The necessity of SOME labor for the satisfaction of our wants is not imposed by political systems or by the exploitation of the working classes; it is due to physical laws, which the reformer, like everyone else, must admit and study. Before any optimistic economic project can be accepted as feasible, we must examine whether the physical <b>conditions</b> <b>of</b> <b>production</b> impose an unalterable veto, or whether they are capable of being sufficiently modified by science and organization. Two connected doctrines must be considered in examining this question: First, Malthus' doctrine of population; and second, the vaguer, but very prevalent, view that any surplus above the bare necessaries of life can only be produced if most men work long hours at monotonous or painful tasks, leaving little leisure for a civilized existence or rational enjoyment. I do not believe that either of these obstacles to optimism will survive a close scrutiny. The possibility of technical improvement in the methods of production is, I believe, so great that, at any rate for centuries to come, there will be no inevitable barrier to progress in the general well-being by the simultaneous increase of commodities and diminution of hours of labor.|$|E

My hostess {{was not only a}} clever woman, but presumably a generous one. I determined to let my judgment wait upon events. Possibly she was right; but if she was wrong, she was cruelly wrong! Her version of my friend's eccentricities made me impatient to see him again and examine him in the light of public opinion. On our next meeting I immediately asked him if he knew Mrs. Coventry. He laid his hand on my arm and gave me a sad smile. [...] "Has she taxed your gallantry at last?" [...] he asked. [...] "She's a foolish woman. She's frivolous and heartless, and she pretends to be serious and kind.

60|$|Profits, however, {{may enter}} more largely into the <b>conditions</b> <b>of</b> <b>production</b> of one {{commodity}} than of another, {{even though there}} be {{no difference in the}} rate of profit between the two employments. The one commodity may be called upon to yield a profit during {{a longer period of time}} than the other. The example by which this case is usually illustrated is that of wine. Suppose a quantity of wine and a quantity of cloth, made by equal amounts of labor, and that labor paid at the same rate. The cloth does not improve by keeping; the wine does. Suppose that, to attain the desired quality, the wine requires to be kept five years. The producer or dealer will not keep it, unless at the end of five years he can sell it for as much more than the cloth as amounts to five years’ profit, accumulated at compound interest. The wine and the cloth were made by the same original outlay. Here, then, is a case in which the natural values, relatively to one another, of two commodities, do not conform to their cost of production alone, but to their cost of production plus something else—unless, indeed, for the sake of generality in the expression, we include the profit which the wine-merchant foregoes during the five years, in the cost of production of the wine, looking upon it as a kind of additional outlay, over and above his other advances, for which outlay he must be indemnified at last.|$|E

60|$|In {{this manner}} {{it is that}} the value of money is made to conform to the cost of {{production}} of the metal of which it is made. It may be well, however, to repeat (what has been said before) that the adjustment {{takes a long time to}} effect, in the case of a commodity so generally desired and at the same time so durable as the precious metals. Being so largely used, not only as money but for plate and ornament, there is at all times a very large quantity of these metals in existence: while they are so slowly worn out that a comparatively small annual production is sufficient to keep up the supply, and to make any addition to it which may be required by the increase of goods to be circulated, or by the increased demand for gold and silver articles by wealthy consumers. Even if this small annual supply were stopped entirely, it would require many years to reduce the quantity so much as to make any very material difference in prices. The quantity may be increased much more rapidly than it can be diminished; but the increase must be very great before it can make itself much felt over such a mass of the precious metals as exists in the whole commercial world. And hence the effects of all changes in the <b>conditions</b> <b>of</b> <b>production</b> of the precious metals are at first, and continue to be for many years, questions of quantity only, with little reference to cost of production. More especially is this the case when, as at the present time, many new sources of supply have been simultaneously opened, most of them practicable by labor alone, without any capital in advance beyond a pickaxe and a week’s food, and when the operations are as yet wholly experimental, the comparative permanent productiveness of the different sources being entirely unascertained.|$|E
60|$|Now let us {{change the}} example a little further. Suppose that the {{monopolist}} has for sale {{not simply a}} fixed and definite quantity of a certain article, but something which he can produce in larger quantities as desired. At what price will he now sell? If he offers the article {{at a very high}} price only a few people will take it: if he lowers the price there will be more and more purchasers. His interest seems divided. He will want to put the price as high as possible so that the profit on each single article (over what it costs him to produce it) will be as great as possible. But he will also want to make as many sales as he possibly can, which will induce him to set the price low enough to bring in new buyers. But, of course, if he puts the price so low that it only covers the cost of making the goods his profit is all gone and the mere multiplicity of sales is no good to him. He must try therefore to find a point of maximum profit where, having in view both the number of sales and the profit over cost on each sale the net profit is at its greatest. This gives us the fundamental law of monopoly price. It is to be noted that under modern <b>conditions</b> <b>of</b> <b>production</b> the cost of manufacture per article decreases to a great extent in proportion as a larger and larger number is produced and thus the widening of the sale lowers the proportionate cost. In any particular case, therefore, it may turn out that the price that suits the monopolist's own interest is quite a low price, one such as to allow for an enormous quantity of sales and a very low cost of manufacture. This, we say, may be the case. But it is not so of necessity. In and of itself the monopoly price corresponds to the monopolist's profit and not to cheapness of sale. The price may be set far above the cost.|$|E
6000|$|... “Perhaps I shall here be asked, How, if {{the case}} be so—if the high [...] rate of {{industrial}} remuneration in America be only evidence of a [...] low cost of production—the fact is to be explained, since fact it [...] undoubtedly is, {{that the people of}} the United States are unable to [...] compete in neutral markets, in the sale of certain important [...] wares, with England and other European countries?(367) No one will [...] say that the people of New England, New York, and Pennsylvania, [...] are deficient in any industrial qualities possessed by the workmen [...] of any country in the world. How happens it, then, that, enjoying [...] industrial advantages superior to other countries, they are yet [...] unable to hold their own against them in the general markets of [...] commerce? I shall endeavor to meet this objection fairly, and, in [...] the first place, let me state what my contention is with regard to [...] the cost of production in America. I do not contend that it is low [...] in the case of all commodities capable of being produced in the [...] country, but only in that of a large, very important, but still [...] limited group. With regard to commodities lying outside this [...] group, I hold that the rate of wages is simply no evidence as to [...] the cost of their production, one way or the other. But, secondly, [...] I beg the reader to consider what is meant by the alleged [...] ‘inability’ of New England and Pennsylvania to compete, let us [...] say, with Manchester and Sheffield, in the manufacture of calico [...] and cutlery. What it means, and what it only can mean, is that [...] they are unable to do so consistently with obtaining that rate of [...] remuneration on their industry which is current in the United [...] States. If only American laborers and capitalists would be [...] content with the wages and profits current in Great Britain, there [...] is nothing that I know of to prevent them from holding their own [...] in any markets to which Manchester and Sheffield can send their [...] wares. And this brings us {{to the heart of the}} question. Over a [...] large portion of the great field of industry the people of the [...] United States enjoy, as compared with those of Europe, (1) [...] advantages of a very exceptional kind; over the rest (2) the [...] advantage is less decided, or (3) they stand on a par with [...] Europeans, or (4) possibly they are, in some instances, at a [...] disadvantage. Engaging in the branches of industry in which their [...] advantage over Europe is great, they reap industrial returns [...] proportionally great; and, so long as they confine themselves to [...] these occupations, they can compete in neutral markets against all [...] the world, and still secure the high rewards accruing from their [...] exceptionally rich resources. But the people of the Union decline [...] to confine themselves within these liberal bounds. They would [...] cover the whole domain of industrial activity, and think it hard [...] that they should not reap the same rich harvests from every part [...] of the field. They must descend into the arena with Sheffield and [...] Manchester, and yet secure the rewards of Chicago and St. Louis. [...] They must employ European <b>conditions</b> <b>of</b> <b>production,</b> and obtain [...] American results. What is this but to quarrel with the laws of [...] nature? These laws have assigned to an extensive range of [...] industries carried on in the United States a high scale of return, [...] far in excess of what Europe can command, to a few others a return [...] on a scale not exceeding the European proportion. American [...] enterprise would engage in all departments alike, and obtain upon [...] all the high rewards which nature has assigned only to some. Here [...] we find the real meaning of the ‘inability’ of Americans to [...] compete with the ‘pauper labor’ of Europe. They can not do so, and [...] at the same time secure the American rate of return on their work. [...] The inability no doubt exists, but it is one created, not by the [...] drawbacks, but by the exceptional advantages of their position. It [...] is as if a skilled artisan should complain that he could not [...] compete with the hedger and ditcher. Let him only be content with [...] the hedger and ditcher’s rate of pay, and there will be nothing to [...] prevent him from entering the lists even against this rival.”(368) ...|$|E
