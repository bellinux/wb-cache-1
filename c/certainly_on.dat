25|$|However Heydon chiefly owed his {{prominence}} in East Anglia to his service with William de la Pole, 1st Duke of Suffolk (d.1450), {{with whom he}} had become associated by 1435. Through his influence with Henry VI, Suffolk is said to have ousted John Mowbray, 3rd Duke of Norfolk, from his rightful position as the dominant magnate in East Anglia. Two of his agents in particular, Heydon and Sir Thomas Tuddenham, from 1443 jointly held the 'powerful and lucrative' stewardship of the Duchy of Lancaster, and are said to have terrorised the East Anglian gentry, including the Paston family. The conflict between the Pastons and Heydon over the years is recorded in the Paston Letters. In 1448 it centred on the manor of Gresham, which William Paston had purchased from Thomas Chaucer. In February of that year, 'almost <b>certainly</b> <b>on</b> Heydon's initiative', Robert Hungerford, 3rd Baron Hungerford, asserted his wife's claim to Gresham, then in the hands of William Paston's son, John. Paston attempted to recover the manor through negotiation and legal action; both proved fruitless, and in October 1448 Paston asserted possession by sending his wife, Margaret, to reside in a house in Gresham. In the following January Hungerford's servants assaulted and damaged the house, forcing Margaret Paston to leave; Hungerford remained in possession of Gresham for the next three years. In a letter in 1448 Margaret referred to Heydon as a 'false shrew'.|$|E

2500|$|Peter Warr {{actually}} wanted to replace Nigel Mansell with Senna at Lotus, but their British-based title sponsor, Imperial Tobacco (John Player & Sons), wanted a British driver. Senna, however, {{was determined to}} drive that season and <b>certainly</b> <b>on</b> his own terms. Senna's test for Brabham occurred at Paul Ricard in November 1983, and he set lap times two seconds slower than the team's lead driver, Nelson Piquet, who allegedly gave Senna the nickname [...] "the São Paulo taxi driver". Senna impressed the Brabham team and was linked to their second seat. However, the team's main sponsor, Italian dairy company Parmalat, wanted an Italian driver. Brabham's second car was eventually shared by brothers Teo and Corrado Fabi, while Piquet convinced Ecclestone to sign his friend Roberto Moreno as the test driver. Consequently, he joined Toleman, a relatively new team, using less competitive Pirelli tyres. Venezuelan Johnny Cecotto, a former Grand Prix motorcycle racing world champion, was his teammate. During 1984, Senna hired Nuno Cobra to assess his physical condition. Senna had been worried about his condition due to low weight.|$|E
2500|$|A {{month in}} advance of the 2011 World Cup in March, Sangakkara decided that he would resign the {{captaincy}} after the tournament. Sri Lanka reached the final of the tournament. Throughout the tournament Sangakkara was in prolific form with the bat scoring 465 runs from 9 matches and was the third highest run-scorer behind team-mate Tillakaratne Dilshan and India's Sachin Tendulkar. Days after guiding Sri Lanka to the finals of the World Cup, Sangakkara announced to the public he was stepping down as captain of the T20 and ODI teams. He offered to continue as Test captain if deemed necessary for transition to new skipper, but Dilshan was appointed captain across all formats. Reflecting on the decision afterwards, he said that [...] "captaining Sri Lanka is a job that ages you very quickly... It's rarely a job you will last long in...

2500|$|In {{the early}} days of Christian worship the Sacred Scriptures {{furnished}} all that was thought necessary, containing as it did the books from which the lessons were read and the psalms that were recited. The first step {{in the evolution of the}} Breviary was the separation of the Psalter into a choir-book. At first the president of the local church (bishop) or the leader of the choir chose a particular psalm as he thought appropriate. From about the 4th century certain psalms began to be grouped together, a process that was furthered by the monastic practice of daily reciting the 150 psalms. This took so much time that the monks began to spread it over a week, dividing each day into hours, and allotting to each hour its portion of the Psalter. St Benedict in the 6th century drew up such an arrangement, probably, though not <b>certainly,</b> <b>on</b> the basis of an older Roman division which, though not so skilful, is the one in general use. Gradually there were added to these psalter choir-books additions in the form of antiphons, responses, collects or short prayers, for the use of those not skilful at improvisation and metrical compositions. Jean Beleth, a 12th-century liturgical author, gives the following list of books necessary for the right conduct of the canonical office: the Antiphonarium, the Old and New Testaments, the Passionarius (liber) and the Legendarius (dealing respectively with martyrs and saints), the Homiliarius (homilies on the Gospels), the Sermologus (collection of sermons) and the works of the Fathers, besides, of course, the Psalterium and the Collectarium. To overcome the inconvenience of using such a library the Breviary came into existence and use. Already in the 8th century Prudentius, bishop of Troyes, had in a Breviarium Psalterii made an abridgment of the Psalter for the laity, giving a few psalms for each day, and Alcuin had rendered a similar service by including a prayer for each day and some other prayers, but no lessons or homilies. The Breviary rightly so called, however, only dates from the 11th century; the earliest MS. containing the whole canonical office is of the year 1099 and is in the Mazarin library. Gregory VII (pope 1073–1085), too, simplified the liturgy as performed at the Roman court, and gave his abridgment the name of Breviary, which thus came to denote a work which from another point of view might be called a Plenary, involving as it did the collection of several works into one. There are several extant specimens of 12th-century Breviaries, all Benedictine, but under Innocent III (pope 1198–1216) their use was extended, especially by the newly founded and active Franciscan order. These preaching friars, with the authorization of Gregory IX, adopted (with some modifications, e.g. the substitution of the [...] "Gallican" [...] for the [...] "Roman" [...] version of the Psalter) the Breviary hitherto used exclusively by the Roman court, and with it gradually swept out of Europe all the earlier partial books (Legendaries, Responsories), , and to some extent the local Breviaries, like that of Sarum. Finally, Nicholas III (pope 1277–1280) adopted this version both for the curia and for the basilicas of Rome, and thus made its position secure.|$|E
