5|$|The Harrier has two <b>control</b> <b>elements</b> {{not found}} in {{conventional}} fixed-wing aircraft: the thrust vector and the reaction control system. The thrust vector refers to the slant of the four engine nozzles and can be set between 0° (horizontal, pointing directly backwards) and 98° (pointing down and slightly forwards). The 90° vector is normally deployed for VTOL manoeuvring. The reaction control is achieved by manipulating the control stick and is similar in action to the cyclic control of a helicopter. While irrelevant during forward flight mode, these controls are essential during VTOL and STOL manoeuvres.|$|E

25|$|Eukaryotic genes {{also contain}} {{regulatory}} sequences beyond the core promoter. These cis-acting <b>control</b> <b>elements</b> bind transcriptional activators or repressors to {{increase or decrease}} transcription from the core promoter. Well-characterized regulatory elements include enhancers, silencers, and insulators. These regulatory sequences can be spread over a large genomic distance, sometimes located hundreds of kilobases from the core promoters.|$|E

40|$|The genetic {{basis for}} a {{striking}} aleurone color variegation of a maize population from Colombia is described. The variegation {{is the result of}} the interaction of a particular r allele, designated r-cu, and a specific factor, Fcu (Factor Cuna), that collectively compose a <b>controlling</b> <b>element</b> system. In the absence of Fcu, a variable dilute (nonvariegated) pigmentation is expressed in the aleurone. The degree of variegation is determined by differences in the dosage of the Fcu element; differences in variegation between kernels with one r-cu vs. two r-cu's cannot be detected. Because of the specificity of the interaction, Fcu is different from the three other well-known <b>controlling</b> <b>elements,</b> Dt, Ac and En(=Spm), and therefore represents a fourth <b>controlling</b> <b>element</b> system in maize. In addition to Fcu, the Cuna tribal maize contains two other <b>controlling</b> <b>elements,</b> Dt and a very weak En. The prevalence of <b>controlling</b> <b>elements</b> in natural maize populations is discussed...|$|R

25|$|The Katana {{has several}} {{distinctive}} features, including its all-composite construction, low-mounted wing, T-tail arrangement, and a castering nosewheel. All models {{make use of}} a composite airframe which is constructed of glass- and carbon-fiber reinforced plastic. The one-piece fuselage has removable wings, which assists with transportation and servicing activities. The wings themselves have transparent plexiglas panels present so that key <b>control</b> <b>elements</b> can be readily inspected without disassembly. The airframe is complete with a sleek finish across the entirety of its exterior, which serves to eliminate corrosion and rivets in order to lower maintenance requirements. The maintenance costs of the Katana have been considered to be relatively low.|$|E
25|$|Feedback loops provide generic {{mechanisms}} for controlling the running, maintenance, {{and evolution of}} software and computing systems. Feedback-loops are important models in the engineering of adaptive software, as they define the behaviour of the interactions among the <b>control</b> <b>elements</b> over the adaptation process, to guarantee system properties at run-time. Feedback loops and foundations of control theory have been successfully applied to computing systems. In particular, they have been applied {{to the development of}} products such as IBM's Universal Database server and IBM Tivoli. From a software perspective, the autonomic (MAPE, monitor analyze plan execute) loop proposed by researchers of IBM is another valuable contribution to the application of feedback loops to the control of dynamic properties and the design and evolution of autonomic software systems.|$|E
25|$|In late March 1971, {{when the}} 5th Special Force Group was redeployed to the U.S., the Command and <b>Control</b> <b>elements</b> were renamed Task Force Advisory Elements (TF1AE, TF2AE and TF3AE). They {{originally}} consisted of 244 U.S. and 780 indigenous personnel each, {{but they were}} quickly drawn down by {{the elimination of the}} exploitation forces. For SOG, Vietnamization was finally nigh. On 1 May 1972, the unit was reduced in strength and renamed the Strategic Technical Directorate Assistance Team 158 (STDAT-158). The Ground Studies Group was disestablished and replaced by the Liaison Service Advisory Detachments. SOG's air elements stood down for redeployment, the JPRC was turned over to MACV and redesignated the Joint Casualty Resolution Center, while the psychological operations personnel and installations were turned over to either the STD or JUSPAO.. The final casualty of SOG ground operations occurred on October 11, 1971 when Sergeant First Class Audley D. Mills was killed when a booby-trap he was trying to disarm detonated.|$|E
40|$|The Spotted-dilute <b>controlling</b> <b>element</b> {{system in}} maize {{involves}} an autonomous Spotting factor (Spf), and a receptor at the r 1 locus haplotype R 1 -r (spotted dilute 2). Its relationship with other maize transposable element systems is poorly characterized. Through {{development of a}} genetic tester that carries receptors for both the Spotted-dilute and the En/Spm <b>controlling</b> <b>element</b> systems, we determined that both receptors respond equally to Spf and En/Spm and that Spf is therefore {{a member of the}} En/Spm family of <b>controlling</b> <b>elements...</b>|$|R

25|$|During this stage, he is a {{said to have}} practised some {{technique}} of meditation that would seemingly help him <b>control</b> <b>elements</b> (called tattva) like fire and {{water out of the}} total 36 such elements enumerated in Kashmir Shaivism. He started the practice of blowing air at live charcoals in his fire pot (called kanger in local language) sometimes for hours together. He was found talking to and directing invisible people at times. Various parts of his body like his shoulders and knees were seen shuddering at times. He spiritually initiated a Sikh disciple who had come to see him from some other state and lived at his home for 3 months. He also initiated Pandit Maheshwar Nath Zutshi of Mallapore locality of Srinagar by offering him his pipe. He also started the practice of transfixing his gaze on water filled in a tumbler kept inside a brass basin filled with water. This brass basin was placed over an earthenware pot which too was filled with water. It was also during this time that majority of his miracles were recorded and people started flocking him, seeking solutions to their worldly problems. It was sometime during the period between 1946–56 that he came to be called as Bhagwan by his devotees. He regularly visited the shrines of the deities of Mata Sharika Bhagwati and Mata Ragnya Bhawani during this period. Sometime after 1957, on every Sunday afternoon, musical concerts were held at his place by known local musicians who would play local and Indian classical music for him. Some of the other shrines visited by him during the initial and final stages of his spiritual practice were Jwala Ji at Khrew, Bhadrakali at Handwara, Jyestha Bhagwati at Srinagar, Gupt Ganga near Nishat Bagh, Tushkaraja Bhairav at Srinagar and Amarnath.|$|E

Characterization of the <b>control</b> <b>element</b> variants reveals that, with respect to late third instar larval tissue distribution of XDH activity and cross-reacting material, i 409 H is associated with a large, tissue-specific increase in fat body which is not observed in malpighian tubules.
