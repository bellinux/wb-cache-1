The specimen was collected by Reed in gray sandstone and brown/green <b>claystone</b> that were deposited during the Kimmeridgian stage of the Jurassic period, approximately 157 to 152 million years ago.

5|$|The station's geology is {{dominated}} by the Tomkinson Group, a formation comprising sedimentary rocks of the Paleoproterozoic era that is over 1.6 billion years old. The Tomkinson Group includes layers of coarse sandstones and conglomerates, with some <b>claystone</b> and siltstone, deposited in a fluvial to shallow marine environment. There are also Cambrian basaltic rocks, particularly near the homestead. The eastern parts of the station form a stony plateau within the Ashburton Range. The central parts are flat and include claypans, while to the west are stony ridges. The region is drained by an ephemeral waterway, Tomkinson Creek, and is considered a good candidate to contain manganese deposits, the mineral having been extracted in the 1950s and 1960s at the Mucketty mine just east of Muckaty Station.|$|E

40|$|International audienceIdentifying {{independent}} parameters to bracket the {{oil window}} in sedimentary basins is of first importance for petroleum exploration. We investigate the magnetic assemblage of Cretaceous <b>claystones</b> {{collected from the}} western volcanic margin of Greenland. These <b>claystones</b> experienced low-grade burial (300 K) properties of isothermal remanent magnetization. The magnetic assemblage of immature <b>claystones</b> (lower Ro) resides in goethite, greigite, and some magnetite. The magnetic assemblage of immature to early mature <b>claystones</b> (higher Ro) resides in stoichiometric magnetite and fine-grained pyrrhotite. By comparing these results with those from <b>claystones</b> from the Paris Basin (France) and the Jura Mountains (Switzerland), we suggest the existence of similar mechanisms {{for the formation of}} magnetic minerals during burial. If confirmed by further studies, the magnetic assemblage of <b>claystones</b> may be diagnostic of oil windows...|$|R
40|$|International audienceWe {{investigate}} {{the effects of}} burial and moderate experimental heating on <b>claystones</b> from three regions with different degrees of maturation: immature (burial temperature ~ 40 °C) of Bure Callovo-Oxfordian <b>claystones</b> in the Basin of Paris (France); early mature (burial temperature ~ 85 °C) of Opalinus Lower Dogger <b>claystones</b> from the Mont Terri anticline {{in front of the}} Jura fold belt (Switzerland); and mature to overmature (burial temperature < 170 °C) of Chartreuse Callovian-Oxfordian <b>claystones</b> from Chartreuse Sub-Alpine chains. To have information {{about the nature of the}} magnetic assemblage, we perform low-temperature (10 K- 300 K) investigation of an isothermal remanent magnetization. In a first set of laboratory heating experiments, we aim to impart a chemical remanent magnetization (CRM) at 95 °C for several weeks in Bure and Opalinus <b>claystones.</b> Thermal demagnetization of the CRM reveals that magnetite is formed by heating the Opalinus <b>claystones</b> while an assemblage of magnetite and iron sulphide is formed in Bure <b>claystones.</b> Further, we document the appearance of a magnetic transition at ~ 35 K in Bure <b>claystones</b> after heating. We name this transition the P-transition and we propose that it is related to the formation of fine-grained pyrrhotite (Fe 7 S 8). The P-transition is also detected in early mature to mature Opalinus and Chartreuse <b>claystones.</b> We conduct additional experimental heating of natural Opalinus <b>claystones.</b> One set of experiments is referred to as short-term heating (1 h) from 100 °C to 200 °C. It is dedicated to an investigation of the effect of short-lived heating processes in geology. A second set of heating experiments is designed to approach burial conditions using a gold capsule. In burial-like experiments, we heated Opalinus <b>claystones</b> from 150 °C to 250 °C for several weeks under a pressure of 100 MPa. In both experiments, we observe a correlative diminution of the pyrrhotite signature at 35 K with increasing temperature. We interpret this trend as the appearance of magnetite. We derive a parameter PM from the warming curve of a saturated isothermal remanent magnetization acquired at 10 K (ZFC). We report on a consistent evolution of PM with temperature in the range of 40 °C to 250 °C, including natural samples, heated samples at 95 °C, and burial-like heated samples. PM first increases between ~ 40 °C up to ~ 85 °C, implying that pyrrhotite gradually dominates the magnetic assemblage at low temperature. For temperatures above 85 °C, PM decreases up to 250 °C, implying that the formation of magnetite gradually overshadows the magnetic input of pyrrhotite. PM values obtained from mature to overmature <b>claystones</b> from the Chartreuse are lower than the PM values obtained from the burial-like heated Opalinus <b>claystones,</b> suggesting that the formation of magnetite is driven by kinetics. The continuous trend of the PM parameter suggests that the magnetic properties of pyrrhotite-magnetite <b>claystones</b> can be used to infer paleo-temperatures and we propose to name this geothermometer MagEval...|$|R

25|$|A <b>claystone</b> is lithified, and non-fissile mudrock. In {{order for}} a rock to be {{considered}} a <b>claystone,</b> it must consist of up to fifty percent clay, which measures less than 1/256 of a millimeter in particle size. Clay minerals are integral to mudrocks, and represent the first or second most abundant constituent by volume. There are 35 recognized clay mineral species on Earth. They make muds cohesive and plastic, or able to flow. Clay is by far the smallest particles recognized in mudrocks. Most materials in nature are clay minerals, but quartz, feldspar, iron oxides, and carbonates can weather to sizes of a typical clay mineral.|$|E
25|$|Subsequent {{erosion of}} the Targhee Uplift was driven by steepened stream gradients. Gravel, {{quartzite}} cobbles, and sand from this erosion eventually became the 5,000 foot (1,500 m) thick Harebell Formation seen today as various conglomerates and sandstones in the northern and northeastern parts of the park. In the Paleocene epoch large amounts of clastic sediment derived from uplifted areas covered the Harebell Formation to become the Pinyon Conglomerate. The lower members of this formation consist of coal beds and <b>claystone</b> with conglomerate made of quartzite from the Targhee uplift above.|$|E
25|$|Clay, mud, silt, cross-bedded {{sand and}} pebbles were later {{deposited}} by meandering streams and in flood plains, forming the locally 100 to 500foot (30 to 150m) thick Salt Wash Member. <b>Claystone</b> and mudstone beds of this member erode into gray slopes that can exhibit brown, red, yellow, and green colors. Salt Wash sandstone is moderately sorted and fine to medium grained while pebble conglomerate beds {{are made of}} chert with small amounts of silica-rich limestone. Both bed types erode into ledges and small cliffs. The Salt Wash was locally mined in the 1950s to extract uranium ore.|$|E
40|$|The Pavlov Hills are {{situated}} in the NW margin of the outer units of the Carpathian Flysh belt. The structure of Pavlov Hills (Klippen Belt) {{is a result of}} thrusting of Carpathian acretionary wedge. The hills are formed by Jurassic to Cretaceous preflysh sediments incorporated into nape slices of Carpathian Flysh Belt. In the Jurassic the preflysch sediments are represented by (Malmian), dark grey deep marine <b>claystones</b> (Klentnice Fm.) which are laterally replaced by nodular limestones and light shallow marine limestones (Ernstbrunn Limestones) {{in the top of the}} Jurassic carbonate facies of the Ždánice Unit.

As this occurred, bentonite-rich clay (formed {{in part from}} volcanic ash erupted from nearby volcanoes) and clayey cross-bedded sand with some interbeds and lenses of lime ooze were laid down. This eventually became the light purplish-gray <b>claystone,</b> sandstone, and carbonate rock of the Chinle's Monitor Butte Member. Burrows that measure 5inches (13cm) in diameter and 5feet (1.5m) long were excavated by lungfish into the Monitor Butte. This member easily stands out in the lower to middle slopes of the Waterpocket Fold's west face in such places as The Castle and along the cliff's just north of State Route 24 as it enters the park.|$|E
25|$|The first fossils {{classified}} as Sauroposeidon were four neck vertebrae discovered in rural Oklahoma, {{not far from}} the Texas border, in a <b>claystone</b> outcrop that dates the fossils to about 110million years ago (mya). This falls within the Early Cretaceous Period, specifically between the Aptian and Albian epochs. These vertebrae were discovered in May 1994 at the Antlers Formation in Atoka County, Oklahoma by dog trainer Bobby Cross and secured by Dr. Richard Cifelli and a team from the Oklahoma Museum of Natural History in May 1994 and August 1994. Initially the fossils were believed to be simply too large to be the remains of an animal, and due to the state of preservation, believed to be tree trunks. In fact, they are the longest such bones known in dinosaurs. Thus, the vertebrae were stored until 1999, when Dr. Cifelli gave them to a graduate student, Matt Wedel, to analyze as part of a project. Upon their realization of the find's significance, they issued a press release in October 1999, followed by official publication of their findings in the Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology in March 2000. The new species was named S. proteles, and the holotype is OMNH 53062.|$|E

25|$|The {{distribution}} of sediment packages throughout the Northern Carnarvon Basin and Exmouth Plateau varies with location during the Jurassic. By the Pliensbachian, the general beginning {{structure of the}} Northern Carnarvon Basin was formed, creating the Exmouth, Barrow, and Dampier sub-basins along the proximal end of the northwestern Australian margin. Rapid subsidence of the Northern Carnarvon sub-basins ensued the deposition of the Dingo <b>Claystones.</b> These <b>Claystones</b> are thick marine shale deposits separated into two sequence, the Upper and Lower Dingo <b>Claystones.</b> The Lower Dingo sequence cannot {{be found in the}} Exmouth Plateau, because deposition During the Early to Middle Jurassic was restricted to sediments filling in the empty troughs of the Northern Carnarvon sub-basins. As deposition continued through the Middle and Late Jurassic, the troughs of sub-basins filled allowing more of the Dingo sediment overflow into the distal margins of the region. This depositional sequence characterizes the Upper Dingo <b>Claystones,</b> which are found as thick proximal sequences in the Northern Carnarvon sub-basins and thinner distal sequences in the Exmouth Plateau.|$|R
30|$|The {{regressive}} phase commenced {{after the}} Late Permian section, marking {{the end of}} the Palaeozoic tectonic activity (Mory 1991). This phase produced thick, siliciclastic–carbonate Triassic section facies that cover the Vulcan sub-basin, Londonderry High and Ashmore Platform (Cadman and Temple 2003). Beginning in the Scythian, the Mount Goodwin interval was deposited with interbedded <b>claystones</b> and minor siltstone–limestones. Following the Mount Goodwin intervals, shallow Anisian Pollard marine carbonate and shoreline mixed with siliciclastic–carbonates of the Carnian–Ladinian Challis interval exhibit complex shallow marine facies, and both intervals have the potential to serve as good reservoirs (Cadman and Temple 2003). Based on log reports, the Pollard interval consists of mudstones with some <b>claystones,</b> while the Challis interval is more sand-prone with interbedded <b>claystones</b> and limestone intercalations.|$|R

500|$|By {{the close}} of the Precambrian, the region was {{intermittently}} submerged under shallow seas, and for 500million years various types of sedimentary rocks were formed. During the Paleozoic (542 to 251million years ago) sandstone, shale, limestone and dolomite were deposited. Though most of these sedimentary rocks have since eroded away from the central Teton Range, they are still evident on the northern, southern and western flanks of the range. One notable exception is the sandstone Flathead Formation which continues to cap Mount Moran. Sedimentary layering of rocks in Alaska Basin, which is on the western border of Grand Teton National Park, chronicles a 120-million-year period of sedimentary deposition. Fossils found in the sedimentary rocks in the park include algae, brachiopods and trilobites. Sedimentary deposition continued during the Mesozoic (250–66million years ago) and the coal seams found in the sedimentary rock strata indicate the region was densely forested during that era. Numerous coal seams of [...] in thickness are interspersed with siltstone, <b>claystone</b> and other sedimentary rocks.

40|$|The Cenomanian/Turonian (C/T) {{intervals}} at DSDP Sites 105 and 603 B {{from the}} northern part of the proto-North Atlantic show high amplitude, short-term cyclic variations in total organic carbon (TOC) content. The more pronounced changes in TOC are also reflected by changes in lithology from green <b>claystones</b> (TOC 1 %). Although their depositional history was different, the individual TOC cycles at Sites 105 and 603 B can be correlated using stable carbon isotope stratigraphy. Sedimentation rates obtained from the isotope stratigraphy and spectral analyses indicate that these cycles were predominately precession controlled. The coinciding variations in HI, OI, delta 13 Corg and the abundance of marine relative to terrestrial biomarkers, as well as the low abundance of lignin pyrolysis products generated from the kerogen of the black <b>claystones,</b> indicate that these cyclic variations reflect changes in the contribution of marine organic matter (OM). The cooccurrence of lamination, enrichment of redox-sensitive trace metals and presence of molecular fossils of pigments from green sulfur bacteria indicate that the northern proto-North Atlantic Ocean water column was periodically euxinic from the bottom to at least the base of the photic zone (< 150 m) during the deposition of the black <b>claystones.</b> In contrast, the green <b>claystones</b> are bioturbated, are enriched in Mn, do not show enrichments in redox-sensitive trace metals and show biomarker distributions indicative of long oxygen exposure times, indicating more oxic water conditions. At the same time, there is evidence (e. g., abundance of biogenic silica and significant 13 C-enrichment for OC of phytoplanktic origin) for enhanced primary productivity during the deposition of the black <b>claystones.</b> We propose that increased primary productivity periodically overwhelmed the oxic OM remineralisation potential of the bottom waters resulting in the deposition of OM-rich black <b>claystones.</b> Because the amount of oxygen used for OM remineralisation exceeded the amount supplied by diffusion and deep-water circulation, the northern proto-North Atlantic became euxinic during these periods. Both Sites 105 and 603 B show trends of continually increasing TOC contents and HI values of the black <b>claystones</b> up section, which most likely resulted from both enhanced preservation due to increased anoxia and increased production of marine OM during oceanic anoxic event 2 (OAE 2) ...|$|R
