50|$|Call-through telecom {{providers}} use Voice over IP (VoIP) <b>call</b> <b>termination</b> {{to connect}} the caller to the recipient. Most of the call is carried over IP network, where cost of carrying of the audio signal is cheaper than traditional phone carriers. The calls that are initiated on the Internet (e.g. Skype) use VoIP. These calls can terminate at other point on Internet or even at the point, which {{is not on the}} Internet, e.g. traditional telephone line - this is known as <b>call</b> <b>termination.</b> The calls do not have to originate on Internet in order to use VoIP. A caller can dial a physical phone number, which is then routed over VoIP to the point when it is terminated at the recipient's physical phone line (fixed landline or wireless mobile or cell line), even in another country. This is what call-through telecom operators do - they provide <b>call</b> <b>termination</b> {{at both ends of the}} call.|$|E

50|$|In {{the first}} step called {{initiation}} (2,3) a free radical is created by homolysis. Homolysis can be brought about by heat or ultraviolet light but also by radical initiators such as organic peroxides or azo compounds. UV Light is used to create two free radicals from one diatomic species. The final step is <b>called</b> <b>termination</b> (6,7) in which the radical recombines with another radical species. If the reaction is not terminated, but instead the radical group(s) go on to react further, the steps where new radicals are formed and then react is collectively known as propagation (4,5) because a new radical is created available for secondary reactions.|$|R

50|$|The {{protocol}} {{consisted of}} two distinct parts: control protocols and a data transport protocol. Control protocols included relatively rudimentary telephony features such as indicating who {{wants to talk to}} whom; ring tones; negotiation of voice encoding; and <b>call</b> <b>termination.</b> Data messages contained encoded speech. For each encoding scheme (vocoder) a frame was defined as a packet containing the negotiated transmission interval of a number of digitized voice samples.|$|E
50|$|An Internet Telephony Service Provider (ITSP) {{involved}} in the origination of telephone calls usually offers either or both of “PC to Phone calls” and “Phone to Phone calls”. The two major business models for VoIP Originator are “Prepaid” and “Postpaid”. Hardware requirements for VoIP origination are simple. The only hardware needed is a gateway that takes calls off the Internet and delivers them onto PSTN lines. All VoIP originators require a <b>call</b> <b>termination</b> arrangement with a terminator called VoIP terminator.|$|E

50|$|In many {{developing}} countries, mobile communications networks tend {{to experience a}} large network externality, which regulators and operators seek to correct by subsidising subscriptions through increased prices for <b>call</b> <b>termination.</b> That then allows the less-well off in that country {{to gain access to}} communications services, often for free (on a prepay tariff). The additional cost is then levied on subscribers who make calls to these new subscribers; the call originators tend to be better-off. Therefore, despite there being no direct transfer of money, there is a strong Robin Hood effect, with the better-off subsidising the less well-off.|$|E
