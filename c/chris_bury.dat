In September, after failing secure Paul Hall's signature, New Zealand international striker Chris Killen was signed on loan from Manchester City.

Arriving in Burslem was Sean McClare, who joined on a one-month loan from Barnsley, before signing permanently when the loan deal finished. Frenchman Johan Gallon also had a trial at the club, but was not offered a contract. On 21 October, Vale played rivals Stoke City, and McPhee scored for Vale, before <b>Chris</b> Iwelumo <b>buried</b> a late equaliser for the [...] "Potters".

In January, Mvondo Atangana became the first Cameroonian to play for the Vale, when he joined on loan from Dundee United - he would only play two games before picking up a serious injury. Meanwhile, Richard Burgess was allowed to join Nuneaton Borough permanently. Vale then went on a sequence of seven wins in eight games to shoot up the table, including a 1-0 win over Stoke at the Britannia Stadium thanks to a Micky Cummins header, as Horton was named Manager of the Month. This run raised hopes of a play-off bid. It also encouraged chairman Bill Bell to offer new contracts to the management team (Horton, Grew, Foyle and Glover), as well as seven players. Horton was also awarded the Manager of the Month award for February. Vale finished in poor form however, winning just one of their final eleven games.|$|R
