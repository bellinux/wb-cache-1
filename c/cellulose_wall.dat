5000|$|When {{starved for}} their {{bacterial}} food supply and exposed to dark, moist conditions, heterothallic or homothallic strains can undergo sexual development {{that results in}} the formation of a diploid zygote. [...] Heterothallic mating has been best studied in Dictyostelium discoideum and homothallic mating has been best studied in Dictyostelium mucoroides (strain DM7). In the heterothallic sexual cycle, amoebae aggregate in response to cAMP and sex pheromones, and two cells of opposite mating types fuse, and then begin consuming the other attracted cells. Before they are consumed, some of the prey cells form a <b>cellulose</b> <b>wall</b> around the entire group. When cannibalism is complete, the giant diploid cell is a hardy macrocyst which eventually undergoes recombination and meiosis, and hatches hundreds of recombinants.

40|$|The {{composition}} of the cell wall of the cotton fiber (Gossypium hirsutum L. Acala SJ- 1) has been studied from {{the early stages of}} elongation (5 days postanthesis) through the period of secondary wall formation, using cell walls derived both from fibers developing on the plant and from fibers obtained from excised, cultured ovules. The cell wall of the elongating cotton fiber was shown to be a dynamic structure. Expressed as a weight per cent of the total cell <b>wall,</b> <b>cellulose,</b> neutral sugars (rhamnose, fucose, arabinose, mannose, galactose, and noncellulosic glucose), uronic acids, and total protein undergo marked changes in content during the elongation period. As a way of analyzing absolute changes in the walls with time, data have also been expressed as grams component per millimeter of fiber length. Expressed in this way for plant-grown fibers, the data show that the thickness of the cell wall is relatively constant until about 12 days postanthesis; after this time it markedly increases until secondary <b>wall</b> <b>cellulose</b> deposition is completed. Between 12 and 16 days postanthesis increases in all components contribute to total wall increase per millimeter fiber length. The deposition of secondary <b>wall</b> <b>cellulose</b> begins at about 16 days postanthesis (at least 5 days prior to the cessation of elongation) and continues until about 32 days postanthesis. At the time of the onset of secondary <b>wall</b> <b>cellulose</b> deposition, a sharp decline in protein and uronic acid content occurs. The content of some of the individual neutral sugars changes during development, the most prominent change being a large increase in noncellulosic glucose which occurs just prior to the onset of secondary <b>wall</b> <b>cellulose</b> deposition. Methylation analyses indicate that this glucose, at least in part, is 3 -linked. In contrast to the neutral sugars, no significant changes in cell wall amino acid composition are observed during fiber development...|$|R

40|$|When Valonia {{cells are}} impaled on capillaries, {{it is in}} some ways {{equivalent}} to removing the comparatively inelastic <b>cellulose</b> <b>wall.</b> Under these conditions sap can migrate into a free space and it is found that on the average the rate of increase of volume of the sap is 15 times what it is in intact cells kept under comparable conditions. The rate of increase of volume is a little faster during the first few hours of the experiment, but it soon becomes approximately linear and remains so as long as the experiment is continued. The slightly faster rate at first may mean that the osmotic pressure of the sap is approaching that of the sea water (in the intact cell the sap osmotic pressure is always slightly above that of the sea water). This might result from a more rapid entrance of water than of electrolyte, as would be expected when the restriction of the <b>cellulose</b> <b>wall</b> was removed. During the linear part of the curve the osmotic concentration and the composition of the sap suffer no change, so that entrance of electrolyte must be 15 times as fast in the impaled cells {{as it is in the}} intact cells. The explanation which best accords with the facts is that in the intact cell the entrance of electrolyte tends to increase the osmotic pressure. As a consequence the protoplasm is partially dehydrated temporarily and it cannot take up more water until the <b>cellulose</b> <b>wall</b> grows so that it can enclose more volume. The dehydration of the protoplasm may have the effect of making the non-aqueous protoplasm less permeable to electrolytes by reducing the diffusion and partition coefficients on which the rate of entrance depends. In this way the cell is protected against great fluctuations in the osmotic concentration of the sap...|$|E
40|$|Plant cells {{react to}} {{localized}} stress by forming wall appositions outside their protoplasts {{on the inner}} surface of their <b>cellulose</b> <b>walls.</b> For many years it has been inferred that appositions elicited by encroaching fungi, termed “papillae,” may subsequently also deter them and thus represent a disease-resistance mechanism. Recently, {{it has been shown}} that preformed, oversized papillae, experimentally produced in coleoptile cells of compatible barley, Hordeum vulgare, can completely prevent direct entry of Erysiphe graminis f. sp. hordei that ordinarily penetrates and causes disease. To discover how these papillae may function, acoustic microscopy was used to contrast their in vivo elastic properties with those of ineffective normal papillae and contiguous cell wall. Raster and line scans showed intense acoustic activity at sites of preformed papillae; scans in selected focal planes identified this activity with the papillae, not with subtending cell wall. Minimal acoustic activity was found in normal papillae. It is suggested that some wall appositions could serve in disease resistance as viscoelastic barriers to mechanical forces exerted by the special penetration structures of advancing pathogenic fungi...|$|R

40|$|Some {{interesting}} {{properties of}} protoplasm are revealed when slightly hypertonic solutions of sugars or of electrolytes {{are applied to}} Nitella. The chloroplasts contract and the space between them increases and forms a characteristic pattern consisting of clear areas extending lengthwise along the cell and tapering off at both ends. The development of these areas is irreversible from the start. If the cell is returned to water after plasmolysis begins these areas continue to enlarge {{in much the same}} fashion as when no change is made in the external solution. The cell soon dies whether returned to water or left in the plasmolyzing solution. Similar results are obtained with other sugars, with NaCl, CaCl 2, and sea water. Similar reactions are also brought about by strong ingoing or outgoing currents of water. This suggests that mechanical action may be chiefly responsible for the result and this idea is in harmony with other facts. It seems possible that the retraction of the protoplasm from the <b>cellulose</b> <b>wall</b> may disturb the delicate non-aqueous film which covers the outer surface of the protoplasm and thus produce injury. Such an effect might take place even without visible retraction if the injury occurred in protoplasmic projections extending into the <b>cellulose</b> <b>wall.</b> A study of this behavior may throw light {{on the nature of the}} protoplasmic surface and on the properties of protoplasmic gels as well as on the process of death.

40|$|Several {{forms of}} the action curve are {{described}} which might be accounted for {{on the ground that}} the outer protoplasmic surface shows no rapid electrical change.

40|$|Programmed {{cell death}} (PCD) plays an {{important}} role during developmental and defense processes in plants. One specific developmental process is the formation of xylem vessels which mainly consist of fused dead, hollow cells called vessel or tracheary elements (TE). These elements are composed of lignified <b>cellulose</b> <b>walls.</b> Anatomical dimensions of these xylem vessels, especially the length and diameter, greatly influence water status of the plant. Manipulation of TE dimensions by e. g. environmental conditions affects the plant's water status and may affect agronomical characteristics (Twumasi et al., Acta Hort 669 : 303 - 311, 2005). PCD {{is an integral part of}} the TE differentiation process and we investigated if manipulation of PCD affects the kinetics of TE differentiation and their final dimensions during TE differentiation of Zinnia elegans cv Envy mesophyll cells. Application of E 64 (a general protease inhibitor) and Ac-Z-asp-DCB (a broad-range human caspase inhibitor), both well established inhibitors of PCD in plants, resulted in a significant delay in the timing of cell death, the formation of secondary wall thickenings and significantly affected the final TE dimensions (length and area).
