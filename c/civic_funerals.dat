Offley became godfather to Mary's half-brother Thomas White at his baptism in February 1560/61. Thomas and his sister Katherine White later married two {{of the children of}} Sir Nicholas Woodroffe.

2500|$|A {{number of}} bands {{featuring}} wind instruments play during Carnival and other festivals, but {{the oldest and}} best known of Tlayacapan’s wind ensembles is the Banda Tlayacapan. This organization was begun in 1870 by Vidal Santamaría, with only a chirimia (a traditional wind instrument) and some drums. It was originally called “Los Alarcones.” Soon after, other instruments such as tubas and saxophones were added. The band survived a number of historic events, such as the Mexican Revolution, {{as well as more}} mundane problems such as monetary disputes. Direction of the band has stayed with the Santamaría family, with Brigido Santamaria, who headed it for much of the 20th century, writing music for the band, such as “Danza de los Chinelos” and sons and preserving older traditional pieces that might have otherwise been lost. When he died in 1975, the band came under the direction of Carlos Santamaría who heads it today. The band received the 1998 Premio Nacional de Ciencias y Artes from President Ernesto Zedillo. 2010 marks the band’s 140th anniversary. [...] Many of the modern band’s members represent generations of participation and the band is split into several sections for playing at different kinds of events such as traditional dances, <b>civic</b> events, and <b>funerals.</b> This band is culturally the most important in the state, and has travelled all over Mexico and the world.|$|R
