40|$|Aging is {{believed}} to be a primary risk factor for cancer. Interestingly, the sirtuin family of class III histone deacetylases (HDACs) has been implicated in the regulation of longevity and may be a lost link between aging and cancer. SIRT 1, a nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) -dependent sirtuin, has been shown to promote cell survival by inhibiting apoptosis or cellular senescence in mammalian cells. Recent studies have provided a link between the cellular metabolic function of SIRT 1 and the circadian rhythm (controlled by a clock machinery), which, if deregulated, may lead to an increased risk for some cancers. Interestingly, the loss of the pineal hormone melatonin, a known regulator of circadian rhythm, has been shown to cause deregulation in the circadian rhythm machinery and an increase in susceptibility to cancer. On the basis of scientific evidence, we propose a hypothesis that SIRT 1 inhibition will impart an antiproliferative response in age-related cancers via resynchronization of deregulated core <b>clock</b> <b>circuitry</b> at the cellular level.

They are transcriptionally controlled by the circadian molecular oscillator and are suspected to accomplish output functions of the clock. In turn, PARbZip proteins control expression of genes coding for enzymes involved in metabolism, but also expression of transcription factors which control the expression of these enzymes. For example, these transcription factors control vitamin B 6 metabolism, which influences neurotransmitter homeostasis in the brain, and loss of PARbZip function leads to spontaneous and sound-induced epilepsy that are frequently lethal.

High-speed operation, together with the higher switching activity typically induced during test, {{can result in a}} die-thermal distribution significantly different from that achieved during normal operation. Differences in thermal map distribution between normal- and test-mode operations give rise to a nonuniform impact on the relative path delay within logic blocks. The impact of test-induced hot spots may artificially slow down non-critical paths or speed-up critical ones with respect to the clock making the whole die to fail (pass) delay testing for a good (bad) part. The non-uniform thermal-induced delay is especially important for <b>clock</b> <b>circuitry,</b> the most critical block, which is impacted even if exact zero-skew clock routing algorithms are adopted.

Unfortunately, deteriorating clock skew and jitter make it very difficult to reduce power dissipation. We propose a new global clocking scheme, injection-locked clocking (ILC), to combat clock skew and jitter. This new scheme uses injection-locked oscillators as the clock receivers. It can achieve better power efficiency and jitter performance than conventional buffered trees with the additional benefit of built-in deskewing. Unlike other proposed clocking schemes, ILC is fully compatible with conventional clock distribution. In this paper, a quantitative study based on circuit- and microarchitectural-level simulations is conducted to verify the performance and power consumption improvements using ILC compared to conventional clocking. Alpha 21264 is used as the baseline processor, and is scaled to 0. 13 µm technology and 3 GHz.
