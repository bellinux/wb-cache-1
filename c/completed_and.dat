5|$|By 1890, an {{alternate}} route through Glenwood Springs had been <b>completed</b> <b>and</b> the route through the Black Canyon, being {{more difficult to}} operate, lost importance for through trains. The route was finally abandoned in 1955.|$|E

5|$|After {{considerable}} construction {{effort in}} the face of wet weather, the airbase was <b>completed</b> <b>and</b> proved useful. Whereas the base at Nadzab was surrounded by mountains and was therefore unsuited for missions that had to take off after dark, there was no such problem at Saidor. During March 1944, B-24 Liberator bombers staged through Saidor for night attacks on Hollandia.|$|E
5|$|After the {{calendar}} stories, Hebel wrote Biblische Geschichten (Bible stories), {{a new school}} book for evangelical religious education. His criteria were {{that it should be}} clearly written and tell biblical stories in an exciting narrative style aimed at children from ten to fourteen. It took five years to write and was <b>completed</b> <b>and</b> released in 1824. It was used as a textbook until 1855.|$|E
5|$|After the work-in had finished, the {{boarding}} {{of the stone}} floor was <b>completed</b> <b>and</b> the mill thoroughly cleaned in preparation for an open day which was held in late autumn. The work done in 1981 cost £3,250. Donations received were £2,000 from Rank Xerox, £1,704 from the Historic Buildings Council and £130 from St Edmundsbury Borough Council.

50|$|An anti-unification {{algorithm}} should compute for given expressions a <b>complete,</b> <b>and</b> minimal generalization set, that is, a set {{covering all}} generalizations, and containing no redundant members, respectively. Depending on the framework, a <b>complete</b> <b>and</b> minimal generalization set may have one, finitely many, or possibly infinitely many members, {{or may not}} exist at all; it cannot be empty, since a trivial generalization exists in any case. For first-order syntactical anti-unification, Gordon Plotkin gave an algorithm that computes a <b>complete</b> <b>and</b> minimal singleton generalization set containing the so-called least general generalization (lgg).|$|R

5|$|Almost {{immediately}} after the Lowestoft raid, Admiral Reinhard Scheer began planning another foray into the North Sea. He had initially intended to launch the operation in mid-May, but the mine damage to Seydlitz had proved difficult to repair, and Scheer was unwilling {{to embark on a}} major raid without his battlecruiser forces at full strength. At noon on 28 May, the repairs to Seydlitz were finally <b>completed,</b> <b>and</b> the ship returned to the I Scouting Group.|$|E
5|$|Although CNT {{had secured}} fully {{complete}} plans from Weser, the Austro-Hungarian design modifications delayed {{the start of}} construction. Additional changes after construction had begun slowed the boats' progress. Compounding this were shortages of both material and skilled shipyard workers, further slowing construction. As a result, neither {{of the first two}} boats was ever launched, much less <b>completed,</b> <b>and</b> the second pair was cancelled before either was laid down. U-48 was 70% complete at the war's end, while U-49 was only 55% complete. Both boats were scrapped in place in 1920.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in 1958, I-75 in Michigan was {{constructed}} in several discontinuous segments. M-76 was {{to become one of}} the portions incorporated into the route of I-75. Although other portions of I-75 were <b>completed</b> <b>and</b> designated in noncontiguous segments, the portion from Standish to Roscommon was first signed as M-76 and the entire stretch rebuilt as freeway before it was redesignated as I-75. This was done while a temporary connecting ToI-75 designation between Bay City and Grayling followed a different path along US10 and US127.|$|E
