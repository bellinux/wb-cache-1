5|$|In week nine, the Triangles {{played against}} the Akron Pros. The Pros <b>came</b> <b>into</b> <b>this</b> game {{as one of}} the few teams left in the APFA who were undefeated. The game started out with three {{scoreless}} quarters until Rip King threw a 15-yard passing touchdown in the fourth quarter to Frank McCormick. Fritz Pollard, a future Hall-of-Famer, rushed for a 17-yard touchdown, and Charlie Copley made one extra point and missed another one to beat the Triangles 13–0 and give the Triangles their first loss of the season.|$|E

5|$|Both teams <b>came</b> <b>into</b> <b>this</b> {{game after}} losses the {{previous}} week. Iowa State dropped to 3–3 (0–2 Big12) with a 28–14 loss to Nebraska in Ames. There were three Cyclone touchdowns negated by the officials {{in that game}} (one called caught out of bounds, two on offensive penalties). Oklahoma lost to Texas {{for the second straight}} year in the Red River Rivalry in Dallas and was unable to mount a successful offensive drive for the entire second half. The Sooners also committed 11penalties (a full third of their season total at the time) and five turnovers in that game. After equally disappointing weeks, both teams were looking to rebound.|$|E

25|$|Montana <b>came</b> <b>into</b> <b>this</b> {{game with}} a 7–0 record as a {{starting}} quarterback at the Superdome due to the 49ers' dominance of their then-NFC West rival New Orleans Saints. The 49ers' only loss in the Superdome in the 1980s came in 1986, when Mike Moroski started for an injured Montana.|$|E
25|$|The 2007 Navy vs. Notre Dame {{football}} game ended the longest all-time college football consecutive wins streak by one team over another. On November 3, 2007, the Navy Midshipmen defeated the Notre Dame Fighting Irish 46–44 in triple-overtime at Notre Dame's home field, Notre Dame Stadium in South Bend, Indiana. Notre Dame <b>came</b> <b>into</b> <b>this</b> annual game with 43 straight wins against Navy {{since the last}} loss against Heisman Trophy winner Roger Staubach in 1963. With the win, Navy improved to 5–4 and Notre Dame fell to 1–8 on the season.|$|E
25|$|The Bengals <b>came</b> <b>into</b> <b>this</b> game {{crippled}} by injuries. Starting running back James Brooks, {{still recovering from}} a dislocated thumb he received in the previous week, was held to just 26 rushing yards on 11 carries, while starting offensive linemen Anthony Muñoz and Bruce Reimers both had to miss the game. The injury to Munoz, a future Hall of Famer, was particularly devastating, as the team was forced to assign Kirk Scrafford, a rookie in his first NFL start, to block Townsend, who had led the Raiders with 12.5 sacks during the season.|$|E

25|$|In 1847, after {{lobbying}} by Dorothea L.

Dix <b>came</b> <b>into</b> <b>this</b> effort after having met J.O. King, a Jacksonville, Illinois businessman, who invited her to Illinois where he had been working to build an asylum for the insane. With the lobbying expertise of Dix, plans for the Jacksonville State Hospital (now known as the Jacksonville Developmental Center) were signed into law on March 1, 1847.|$|E
25|$|Both teams <b>came</b> <b>into</b> <b>this</b> game missing key starters. The 49ers {{were without}} injured {{starting}} receiver Dwight Clark, while the Lions {{had to start}} quarterback Gary Danielson in place of injured starter Eric Hipple. Detroit scored first on Murray's 37-yard field goal {{less than five minutes}} into the game. They were poised to score again on their next drive, but 49ers defensive back Ronnie Lott intercepted a pass from Danielson on the San Francisco 15-yard line. The 49ers offense then drove 85 yards in 10 plays and took a 7–3 lead on a 1-yard touchdown run from Roger Craig. On the first play of Detroit's next drive, rookie linebacker Riki Ellison intercepted Danielson and returned the ball four yards to the Lions 24-yard line. Four plays later, Wendell Tyler's 2-yard touchdown run increased their lead to 14–3 early in the second quarter.|$|E
25|$|The Cucuteni-Trypillia {{people were}} {{exporting}} Miorcani type flint {{to the west}} even from their first appearance. The import of flint from Dobruja indicates an interaction with the Gumelniţa-Karanovo culture and Aldeni-Stoicani cultures to the south. Toward {{the end of the}} Cucuteni-Trypillia culture's existence (from roughly 3000 B.C. to 2750 B.C.), copper traded from other societies (mostly from the Gumelniţa-Karanovo culture copper mines of the northeastern Balkan) began to appear throughout the region, and members of the Cucuteni-Trypillia culture began to acquire skills necessary to use it to create various items. Along with the raw copper ore, finished copper tools, hunting weapons and other artifacts were also brought in from other cultures. In exchange for the imported copper, the Cucuteni-Trypillia traders would export their finely crafted pottery and the high-quality flint that was to be found in their territory, which have been found in archaeological sites in distant lands. However, the Lunca salt, which was ubiquitous throughout the region, was not traded away. The introduction of copper marked the transition from the Neolithic to the Eneolithic, also known as the Chalcolithic or Copper Age. This was a transitional period, as it was of a relatively short duration lasting less than 300 years before being replaced by the Bronze Age that was probably introduced by Proto-Indo-European tribes that <b>came</b> <b>into</b> <b>this</b> region from the east. The end of the Cucuteni-Trypillia culture coincided {{with the arrival of the}} Bronze Age. There is much controversy surrounding how the Cucuteni-Trypillia culture ended, which is discussed in greater detail in the article Decline and end of the Cucuteni–Trypillia culture.|$|E

500|$|Brownlee was {{the only}} lawyer in a {{government}} composed primarily of farmers, {{and the rest of}} the cabinet drew heavily on his expertise. Its reliance on him extended beyond legal issues to such matters as how to write a business letter. Greenfield was among the most dependent, and forwarded most controversial issues to his attorney-general for a draft response; Greenfield often signed the draft and sent it out unchanged. [...] The premier eventually relied on Brownlee so heavily that Brownlee set the agenda for cabinet meetings. [...] The government also relied on Brownlee in the legislature, where it found itself under relentless attack from the John R. Boyle-led Liberals. [...] Brownlee had the widest debating experience of the UFA members, and he was increasingly called upon to counter these attacks. [...] His maiden speech was typical of him: [...] "I <b>came</b> <b>into</b> <b>this</b> House with considerable trepidation, because I knew that sitting opposite would be the former giants of this House, men with ability, experience, and skill.

2500|$|All {{the prophets}} prior to Muhammad were important, however the three Prophets {{mentioned}} here made a vast difference in Isra’iliyyat traditions.

Islamic beliefs and Christian beliefs both accept the virgin birth, Jesus’ miracles that are remembered by the Muslim people are the revival of the dead {{and the creation of a}} bird from clay. They believe however, that all these miracles have only come to be through the permission of Allah. They believe that because he <b>came</b> <b>into</b> <b>this</b> world through divine inspiration and a human mother, that the miracles he performed were also human actions with divine permission." [...] “With respect to form, the references in the Qur’an can be divided into four groups: birth and infancy stories, miracles, conversations between Jesus and God or between Jesus and the Israelites, and divine pronouncements on his humanity, servanthood, and place in the prophetic line which stipulate that fanatical opinions about him must be abandoned. [...] "His sinless birth- which in the Qur’an takes place under a palm tree- and the words he speaks as an infant in the cradle are all signs, manifestations of divine favor shown to him and his mother."
