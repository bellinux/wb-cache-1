5|$|The {{expression}} of genes {{is influenced by}} how the DNA is packaged in chromosomes, in a structure called chromatin. Base modifications can be involved in packaging, with regions that have low or no gene expression usually containing high levels of methylation of cytosine bases. DNA packaging and its influence on gene expression can also occur by covalent modifications of the histone protein core around which DNA is wrapped in the chromatin structure or else by remodeling carried out by chromatin remodeling complexes (see Chromatin remodeling). There is, further, <b>crosstalk</b> <b>between</b> DNA methylation and histone modification, so they can coordinately affect chromatin and gene expression.|$|E

25|$|Autophagy and {{apoptosis}} are {{two different}} cell death mechanisms brought on by high levels of ROS in the cells, however; autophagy and apoptosis rarely act through strictly independent pathways. There is a clear connection between ROS and autophagy and a correlation seen between excessive amounts of ROS leading to apoptosis. The depolarization of the mitochondrial membrane is also characteristic of the initiation of autophagy. When mitochondria are damaged and begin to release ROS, autophagy is initiated {{to dispose of the}} damaging organelle. If a drug targets mitochondria and creates ROS, autophagy may dispose of so many mitochondria and other damaged organelles that the cell is no longer viable. The extensive amount of ROS and mitochondrial damage may also signal for apoptosis. The balance of autophagy within the cell and the <b>crosstalk</b> <b>between</b> autophagy and apoptosis mediated by ROS is crucial for a cell’s survival. This crosstalk and connection between autophagy and apoptosis could be a mechanism targeted by cancer therapies or used in combination therapies for highly resistant cancers.|$|E
25|$|MsbA is a multi-drug {{resistant}} (MDR) ABC transporter {{and possibly}} a lipid flippase. It is an ATPase that transports lipid A, the hydrophobic moiety of lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a glucosamine-based saccharolipid that makes up the outer monolayer of the outer membranes of most gram-negative bacteria. Lipid A is an endotoxin and so loss of MsbA from the cell membrane or mutations that disrupt transport results in the accumulation of lipid A in the inner cell membrane resulting to cell death. It is a close bacterial homolog of P-glycoprotein (Pgp) by protein sequence homology and has overlapping substrate specificities with the MDR-ABC transporter LmrA from Lactococcus lactis. MsbA from E. coli is 36% identical to the NH2-terminal half of human MDR1, suggesting a common mechanism for transport of amphiphatic and hydrophobic substrates. The MsbA gene encodes a half transporter that contains a transmembrane domain (TMD) fused with a nucleotide-binding domain (NBD). It is assembled as a homodimer with a total molecular mass of 129.2 kD. MsbA contains 6 TMDs on the periplasmic side, an NBD located on the cytoplasmic side of the cell membrane, and an intracellular domain (ICD), bridging the TMD and NBD. This conserved helix extending from the TMD segments into or near the active site of the NBD is largely responsible for <b>crosstalk</b> <b>between</b> TMD and NBD. In particular, ICD1 serves as a conserved pivot about which the NBD can rotate, therefore allowing the NBD to disassociate and dimerize during ATP binding and hydrolysis.|$|E

STN LCDs have been optimized for passive-matrix addressing. They exhibit a sharper threshold of the contrast-vs-voltage characteristic than the original TN LCDs. This is important, because pixels are subjected to partial voltages even while not selected. <b>Crosstalk</b> <b>between</b> activated and non-activated pixels has to be handled properly by keeping the RMS voltage of non-activated pixels below the threshold voltage, while activated pixels are subjected to voltages above threshold (the voltages according to the [...] "Alt & Pleshko" [...] drive scheme) Driving such STN displays according to the Alt & Pleshko drive scheme require very high line addressing voltages.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{potential}} of mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) to differentiate into functional bone forming cells provides {{an important tool}} for bone regeneration. The identification of factors that trigger osteoblast differentiation in MSCs is therefore critical to promote the osteogenic {{potential of}} human MSCs. In this study, we used microarray analysis to identify signalling molecules that promote osteogenic differentiation in human bone marrow stroma derived MSCs. Results Microarray analysis and validation experiments showed that the expression of IGF 2 and IGFBP 2 was increased together with integrin alpha 5 (ITGA 5) during dexamethasone-induced osteoblast differentiation in human MSCs. This effect was functional since we found that IGF 2 and IGFBP 2 enhanced the expression of osteoblast phenotypic markers and in vitro osteogenic capacity of hMSCs. Interestingly, we showed that downregulation of endogenous ITGA 5 using specific shRNA decreased IGF 2 and IGFBP 2 expression in hMSCs. Conversely, ITGA 5 overexpression upregulated IGF 2 and IGFBP 2 expression in hMSCs, which indicates tight <b>crosstalks</b> <b>between</b> these molecules. Consistent with this concept, activation of endogenous ITGA 5 using a specific antibody that primes the integrin, or a peptide that specifically activates ITGA 5 increased IGF 2 and IGFBP 2 expression in hMSCs. Finally, we showed that pharmacological inhibition of FAK/ERK 1 / 2 -MAPKs or PI 3 K signalling pathways that are enhanced by ITGA 5 activation, blunted IGF 2 and IGFBP 2 expression in hMSCs. Conclusion The results show that ITGA 5 is a key mediator of IGF 2 and IGFBP 2 expression that promotes osteoblast differentiation in human MSCs, and reveal that <b>crosstalks</b> <b>between</b> ITGA 5 and IGF 2 /IGFBP 2 signalling are important mechanisms that trigger osteogenic differentiation in human bone marrow derived mesenchymal stromal cells. </p...|$|R
