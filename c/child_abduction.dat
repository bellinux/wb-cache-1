In attempt to get Billy to speak, Doggett keeps his backpack from him. This infuriates Lisa and leads Scully to question Doggett’s expertise in <b>child</b> <b>abduction</b> cases.

Doggett questions Purnell, who expresses confusion when the agent suggests that he should meet Billy. As Doggett sits in his car, he pulls out a photo of his deceased son, Luke.|$|E
5|$|The {{chair of}} European Parliament Mediator for International Parental <b>Child</b> <b>Abduction</b> was {{established}} in 1987 by initiative of British politician and MEP Charles Henry Plumb, {{with the goal of}} helping minor children of international couples victim of parental abduction. The Mediator finds negotiated solutions in the higher interest of the minor when said minor is abducted by a parent following separation of the couple, regardless whether married or unmarried. Since its institution, the chair has been held by Mairead McGuinnes (since 2014), Roberta Angelilli (2009-2014), Evelyne Gebhardt (2004-2009), Mary Banotti (1995-2004), and Marie-Claude Vayssade (1987-1994). The Mediator's main task is to assist parents in finding a solution in the minor's best interest through mediation, i.e. a form of controversy resolution alternative to lawsuit. The Mediator is activated by request of a citizen and, after evaluating the request, starts a mediation process aimed at reaching an agreement. Once subscribed by both parties and the Mediator, the agreement is official. The nature of the agreement is that of a private contract between parties. In defining the agreement, the European Parliament offers the parties the juridical support necessary to reach a sound, lawful agreement based on legality and equity. The agreement can be ratified by the competent national courts and can also lay the foundation for consensual separation or divorce.|$|E

40|$|International child abductors often escape {{domestic}} {{law enforcement and}} disappear without consequence or resolution. International <b>child</b> <b>abductions</b> occur too frequently; in the United States alone, {{the number of children}} abducted abroad every year has risen to over 1, 000. Currently, 11, 000 American children live abroad with their abductors. These abductions occur despite international treaties and the Congressional resolutions that have significantly stiffened the penalties for those caught. Effectively combating international <b>child</b> <b>abductions</b> requires drafting resolutions that are acceptable across the diverse societies and cultures of the international community. Without such resolutions to fill the gaps of current treaties this problem will continue and the suffering endured by children being uprooted and hidden from one of their parents will continue. The rise in both international marriages and divorce rates along with increased ease of travel has correlated with the rise in <b>child</b> <b>abductions.</b> Statistics from the Missing Children’s Registry show that abductions by parents are five times greater than by strangers. The Justice Department reported that of the 358, 700 children abducted in the U. S. each year 354, 100 were abducted by one of their parents. Law enforcement agencies’ reluctance to get involved in international <b>child</b> <b>abductions,</b> though understandable, is regrettable as it leaves the vast resources of these agencies off limits to left-behind parents. The cost of locating an international child abductor is very high, especially for a third world nation with strapped resources struggling to adequately combat “local murders, inner city crime and ‘real’ kidnappings. ” Finding ways to offset resource utilization and for participation of these crucial nations is necessary for more effectively combating international <b>child</b> <b>abductions...</b>|$|R

25|$|International <b>child</b> <b>abduction</b> in Japan {{refers to}} the illegal {{international}} abduction or removal of children from their country of habitual residence by an acquaintance or family member to Japan or their retention in Japan in contravention {{to the law of}} another country.

The issue is a growing problem as the number of international marriages increases. Barring exceptional circumstances, the effects of <b>child</b> <b>abduction</b> are generally detrimental to the welfare of children.
