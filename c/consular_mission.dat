5000|$|On September 15, 1789, Jean-François de La Pérouse drops {{anchor in}} Monterey Bay and then, marking the first {{official}} French presence in California. The explorer collected precious geographic and scientific goods from the region, boasting its [...] " [...] enormous resources [...] " [...] and strategic position. The French naturalist and botanist, Eugène Duflos de Mofras, {{was sent to the}} Pacific coast during the 1840s and published his book in which he depicts a vast region with a population of merely 4,000 people. [...] The American West coast particularly interested the king, Louis-Philippe I, who had hoped to rebuild the great French empire before 1763. The summon of Louis Gasquet as Consul General of Monterey in November 1843, illustrates a type of political offensive by the government of the time. This unexpected presence worried American and Mexican authorities who struggled for the monopoly of the region. France was the first country to have official representation in California and Gasquet, aware of the predominant position of France, pushed the government to send naval forces as soon as possible. Refusing to recognize the sovereignty of Sloate and Stockton, established during the American independence from England, Gasquet was imprisoned for 51 days (in reality, a sentinel was placed in front of his home, preventing him from completing his <b>consular</b> <b>mission).</b> After an exchange of diplomatic letters, Louis Gasquet was finally released and replaced by Jacob Moerenhout in October 1846. Preserving the interests of his citizens and observing the turbulent behavior of his neighbors, Moernhout created a region favorable to French immigrants. He settled in the Consulate of Monterey, situated by the sea: [...] " [...] a spacious house with a beautiful rose garden and orchards".|$|E
