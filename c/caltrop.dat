25|$|In September 1974, having {{returned}} to Enoggera from Singapore the previous year, 6 RAR briefly raised an airborne capability {{but this was}} only short-lived. That same year, the battalion also provided assistance to the civil community in response to Cyclone Tracy, undertaking clean up tasks in Darwin. 'D' Company was reorganised as a parachute company group in early 1980 and continued in this role until November 1983. As a result of shortcomings in the capability of the Australian Defence Force were highlighted {{in the wake of}} the 1987 Fijian coups d'état, the battalion was trained in the amphibious role. In April 1989, under the command of Lieutenant Colonel David Mead, the battalion took part in the combined arms Exercise <b>Caltrop</b> Force in California, during which it undertook amphibious operations in US Marine AAVP7s. Later, in February 1992, 6 RAR began conversion to a motorised organisation and added a Ready Reserve company later the same year. It reverted to an integrated-regular/reserve battalion in February 1997 and trialed the experimental Army 21 organisation.|$|E
