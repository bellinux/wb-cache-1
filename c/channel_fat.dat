40|$|The aim {{of study}} was to {{investigate}} the carcass quality of Turkish Merino, Ramlic, Kivircik, Chios and Imroz breeds in north-western Turkey under an intensive production system. After weaning at approximately 85 days of age, 46 lambs from Turkish Merino, Ramlic, Kivircik, Chios and Imroz breeds were fattened for 56 days. Slaughter weights were 47. 39, 45. 68, 47. 27, 31. 08 and 29. 82 kg and chilled carcass weights were 23. 35, 22. 33, 23. 51, 14. 33 and 13. 75 kg, respectively (P< 0. 001). Improved Turkish Merino and Ramlic and indigenous Kivircik lambs had higher carcass measurements than indigenous Chios and Imroz lambs. Chios lamb carcasses had the highest tail root fat yellowness and tail percentage while having the lowest fatness score, omental and mesenteric fat percentage and kidney knob and <b>channel</b> <b>fat</b> percentage. Turkish Merino lambs had higher shoulder percentage, lean percentage and lean/total fat ratio in the hind leg and produced less total fat in the hind leg than Ramlic and Kivircik lambs.

One hundred and twenty five lambs of Churra Galega Braganc ̧ana breed were slaugh- tered. During carcasses quartering, a caliper was used to perform subcutaneous fat measurements, over the max- imum depth of longissimus muscle (LM), between the 12 th and 13 th ribs (C 12), and between the 1 st and 2 nd lumbar vertebrae (C 1). The Muscle (MP), Bone (BP), Subcutaneous Fat (SFP), Inter-Muscular Fat (IFP), and Kidney Knob and <b>Channel</b> <b>Fat</b> (KKCF) proportions of lamb carcasses were computed. We used the rminer R library and compared three regression techniques: Mul- tiple Regression (MR), Neural Networks (NN) and Sup- port Vector Machines (SVM).

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to develop and {{evaluate}} models for predicting the carcass composition of lambs. Forty male lambs of two different breeds were included in our analysis. The lambs were slaughtered and their hot carcass weight was obtained. After cooling for 24 hours, the subcutaneous fat thickness was measured between the 12 th and 13 th rib and the total breast bone tissue thickness was taken in the middle of the second sternebrae. The left side of all carcasses was dissected into five components and the proportions of lean meat, subcutaneous fat, intermuscular fat, kidney and knob <b>channel</b> <b>fat,</b> and bone plus remainder were otained. Our models for carcass composition were fitted using the SUR estimator which is novel in this area. The results were compared to OLS estimates and evaluated by several statistical measures. As the models are intended to predict carcass composition, we particularly focussed on the PRESS statistic, because it assesses the precision of the model in predicting carcass composition. Our results showed that the SUR estimator performed better in predicting LMP and IFP than the OLS estimator.

40|$|Growth, {{defined as}} change in weight, may be {{considered}} the most important single characteristic of slaughter cattle. Fast-growing cattle may have better food conversion and reach slaughter early. The end-products in a beef production business, namely, carcass and meat, have properties which determine consumer acceptability. This study focussed attention on growth, carcass and meat characteristics in cattle. Literature was reviewed on factors that influence variability in these traits and relationships {{reported in the literature}} between some of the traits were summarised. Records on 117 Angus steers born in 1975 and 1976 (years 1 and 2) were analysed by the least squares method of fitting constants. Data included birth weight, calf milk consumption pre-weaning average daily gain (ADG), weaning weight, post-weaning ADG, yearling weight, 2 -year weight, finish (30 -month) weight, carcass weight, kidney and <b>channel</b> <b>fat</b> weight, eye muscle width, depth, and area, fat depth, fat trim percentage, intra-muscular fat percentage, sarcomere length, meat tenderness, muscle pH, and colour, lean percentage and bone percentage. Fixed-effects constants fitted to growth data were: herd, age of dam and peri-natal treatment (calving on pasture or sawdust pad). Covariance analysis was adopted with 3 covariates: dam autumn liveweight, calf birth weight, and milk consumption. Factors fitted to post-slaughter data were: maturity, slaughter lot and pre-slaughter fasting, with 3 covariates, carcass weight, pre-weaning ADG, and post-weaning ADG. Results were inconsistent between years. Therefore, few factors were conclusively judged to be important sources of variation in the traits studied. Herd influenced milk consumption (P< 0. 05) and pre-weaning ADG in year 1, and weaning and yearling weight (P< 0. 01) in year 2. Age of dam did not affect growth traits (P< 0. 10). Treatment was unimportant to pre-weaning growth in both years, but year 1 analyses suggested that it affected post-weaning ADG (P< 0. 01) and finish weight (P< 0. 05). This result may be attributed to chance. Regression on dam weight was non-significant for all growth traits. Calf birth weight was found to be an important factor as far as various growth traits in year 2 were concerned, namely, weaning weight (P< 0. 01), and milk consumption, pre-weaning ADG and yearling weight (P< 0. 05). Regression of weaning weight on birth weight approached significance (P< 0. 10), but birth weight was otherwise unimportant in year 1. Milk consumption influenced weaning weight (P< 0. 05) in year 1; approached significance for its effect on pre-weaning ADG and yearling weight in year 1, and weaning and 2 -year weight in year 2 (P< 0. 10). Maturity did not affect post-slaughter characteristics other than eye muscle depth (P< 0. 05) in year 2. Slaughter lot was responsible for variation in eye muscle width (P< 0. 001) and dressing-out percentage (P< 0. 01) in year 1; dressing-out percentage and bone percentage (P< 0. 001) in year 2. Four-day pre-slaughter fasting affected few carcass or meat traits adjusted for carcass weight by covariance analysis. The results were inconsistent between years. In year 1, fasting affected dressing-out percentage (P< 0. 001) only, while in year 2 such effect was not apparent (P< 0. 10), but it was appreciable on other traits: eye muscle width and meat tenderness (P< 0. 05) and sarcomere length (P< 0. 001). Regression of various traits on carcass weight was significant: dressing out percentage, kidney and <b>channel</b> <b>fat,</b> fat depth, intramuscular fat percentage, fat trim percentage, eye muscle depth, eye muscle area, sarcomere length, and bone percentage in year 2; it was significant for dressing-out percentage and kidney and <b>channel</b> <b>fat</b> in year 1. Pre- and post-weaning ADG were less important covariates: the former was significant to eye muscle depth, dressing-out percentage, intra-muscular fat percentage and bone percentage in year 2, but non-significant in year 1. The latter approached significance in eye muscle area, dressing-out percentage, fat trim percentage and bone percentage in year 2 (P< 0. 10). Residual sums of squares were used to estimate phenotypic correlations between traits studied. Correlation coefficients between growth traits were positive and medium to high except those between early growth (pre-weaning ADG, and birth, and weaning weights) and post-weaning ADG, which were negligible. Pre-weaning ADG and weaning weight had a perfect correlation coefficient (r = 1. 0) in both years. Estimates between growth and carcass traits varied widely; notable were those for post-weaning ADG, 2 -year weight, and finish weight with carcass weight, which were high in both years (r = 0. 86, 0. 80; r = 0. 80, 0. 85; and r = 0. 92, 0. 92, respectively). Carcass traits were mostly positively correlated, with low to medium coefficients between them. Lean percentage had a strong negative correlation with fat trim percentage (r = - 0. 71), but bore little relationship with other traits. Correlation coefficients between carcass and meat traits were mostly positive, but low and inconsistent between years. Carcass weight was related to most fatness attributes of the carcass and meat. Most meat traits were positively correlated with each other with low and medium correlation coefficients...|$|E
40|$|This work aims {{to study}} sex and carcass weight effect on carcass and meat quality {{characteristics}} of a {{protected designation of origin}} (PDO) product, cabrito Transmontano. A total of 60 animals with carcass weight ranging between 4 and 8 kg were used. Carcass conformation, commercial joints, tissues measurements and proportions, carcass pH, meat colour and meat texture were evaluated. Sex had a significant effect on carcass composition and males had higher bone and less intermuscular fat and kidney knob and <b>channel</b> <b>fat</b> proportion than females. Males showed better carcass compactness {{as a result of a}} higher hot carcass weight (HCW) /carcass length (K) ratio. Carcass weight significantly affected carcass joint proportion. As the carcass weight increased there was an increase in carcass linear measurements, carcass compactness, chump and breast proportions, fat depots and tissues measurements and a decrease in leg, shoulder, fore ribs and bone proportion. Increasing carcass weight meat became less luminous with more vivid red colour as a result of a progressive brightness reduction and a redness increment. Consequently hue and chroma parameters went through a significant increase and decrease, respectively. A significant effect of carcass weight was found in longissimus dorsi muscle measurements, and muscle area increased as well the subcutaneous fat thickness. Carcass weight also had a significant effect on meat texture measured by Warner-Bratzler shear force, which reduced its value as carcass weight increased. The meat quality parameters studied could be a tool to identify and characterize a product with PDO as cabrito Transmonstano.

40|$|The {{amount and}} {{distribution}} of adipose tissue is important to cattle production. Fat influences the animal’s reproductive efficiency and determines its carcass value. As a cow’s reproductive efficiency {{is associated with a}} level of overall fatness, not just a particular fat depot, being able to re-partition fat to a more valuable depot while reducing fat in less valuable depots would be advantageous. Most previous research involving fat deposition in cattle focussed on subcutaneous and intramuscular fat, and usually evaluated these in relation to total fat or carcass weight rather than the relationship between individual fat depots. The hypothesis that there is a genetic basis for variation in fat distribution in cattle and a weak relationship between fat depots independent of anatomical site was tested. The principal aim of this research was {{to gain a better understanding}} of the mechanisms controlling fat deposition in cattle, including any relationship between fat depots. Marbling features (e. g. shape and orientation) and seam (intermuscular) fat area were quantified using image analysis. The seam fat area and other carcass fat measurements were used to examine the relationship between fat depots. Candidate genes for fat deposition traits were identified and sequenced in Jersey – Limousin mapping sires to find single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). In all, 33 SNPs from 11 candidate genes for fat deposition were selected for association studies in the sire progeny. There was large variation in all of the measures but the variation was largely independent of other marbling factors. The seam fat area data were used to identify a quantitative trait locus on chromosome 19, and subsequently identify candidate genes for seam fat area. In general, there were low correlations between fat traits suggesting the relationship between the depots was not strong. The fixed effects of cohort, breed and myostatin variant affected general fat deposition. However, sire affected fat distribution, as no sire had progeny consistently higher or lower for all fat traits. These results suggest there is only a weak genetic link between the fat depots. The size of effect was small for most of the SNPs associated with fat deposition, although there were some candidate genes with sizeable effects, for example, tyrosine kinase, endothelial (TEK 1) (<b>channel</b> <b>fat,</b> 28 %) and ß, ß-carotene 15, 15 '-monooxygenase (BCMO 1) (subcutaneous fat, 20 %). Moreover, the combined effect of all SNPs affecting a single trait explained 38 % (<b>channel</b> <b>fat),</b> 26 % (seam fat and subcutaneous fat) and 23 % (omental fat) of the phenotypic variation. Interestingly, although some genes were associated with variation in more than one fat trait, no one gene was associated with all fat traits or overall fatness. The major conclusion from the research described herein is that there is genetic influence on fat deposition in addition to the effects of age, breed and management, the deposition of fat into the various adipose sites is controlled in an independent manner genetically and there appears to be no one gene that affects deposition in all sites. There were four principal results that support this conclusion; 1) there were low correlations between fat traits, 2) there were no sires with progeny consistently high or low for all fat traits, 3) the QTL for the various fat depots did not overlap with each other, and 4) no SNP was associated with all fat traits. These results indicate that there is large scope for selecting for and against individual fat traits without altering other fat depots. Thesis (Ph. D.)

40|$|Obesity is {{associated}} with impaired functional hyperemic response. We have shown that ATP-sensitive potassium (KATP) channels are important in mediating functional vasodilation. Adipocyte-derived factors (ADFs) can alter vascular tone via opening KATP channels. We hypothesize that, in an animal model of obesity, ADFs will decrease basal arteriolar tone by opening KATP channels, resulting in an attenuated functional vasodilation. We used wild-type (WT) mice and ob−/ob− mice (ob) to test this hypothesis. The spinotrapezius muscle was prepared for the microcirculatory observation of arcade arterioles, and we measured the vasodilatory responses to muscle stimulation. The basal arteriolar diameter was larger in ob mice compared with WT mice. The KATP channel inhibitor glibenclamide (10 μM) decreased arteriolar diameter in ob mice with no effect in WT mice. The increase in arteriolar diameter induced by muscle stimulation was attenuated in ob mice compared with WT mice. To determine the mechanisms {{for the opening of}} KATP <b>channels,</b> <b>fat</b> was collected from the ob mice, subcutaneous fat from around the spinotrapezius muscle (OBSF) or visceral fat (OBVF) and was incubated in physiological saline solution (PSS). The vasodilatory responses to the fat-conditioned PSS were determined in WT mice. Treatment with OBSF- or OBVF -conditioned PSS increased the arteriolar diameters in WT mice, a dilation that was inhibited by glibenclamide. The absolute diameters induced by muscle stimulation were not altered by the fat-conditioned PSS. These results suggest that, in ob mice, local ADFs reduce the functional vasodilatory capability via opening KATP channels...|$|R

In Experiment 1, animals were given a silage/concentrate diet during a finishing period of either 95 or 152 days. In Experiment 2, steers were offered either a daily diet of silage plus 6 kg of concentrates or concentrates to appetite plus 5 kg of silage (fresh weight) during the final 140 -day finishing period.

To construet nine selection indexes aiming at improving fat partition, estimates of phenotypic and genetic parameters for weight and linear dimensions of the live body were also obtained. The aggregate genotype included the percentage total body fat depositing subcutaneously and intermuscularly at the marketing age of 12 weeks. The füll index included the weaning body weight, marketing body weight, body length, loin width and heart girth. The full index had the highest correlation with the true breeding value (r T| = 0. 597). Comparable accuracy (r Ti = 0. 561) would be expected from the best-reduced index (I 7 = 0. 009 BW – 0. 988 HG) combining marketing body weight and heart girth. At each round of selection with intensity = 1, such a reduced index is expected to result in developing rabbits with advantageous fat partition in terms of higher percentage total body fat depositing subcutaneously (+ 0. 35 unit %), intermuscularly (+ 1. 91 unit %) and intramuscularly (as reflected by 0. 15 unit % increase in carcass muscle yield.

40|$|To {{evaluate}} {{different methods}} of estimating bovine carcass composition, seventy yearling bulls of the "Asturiana de los Valles" beef breed were slaughtered and their carcass composition estimated by a commercial dissection {{of the right}} half-carcass and by tissular dissection of the 6 th and 10 th rib of the left half-carcass. Correlation and regression analyses were used to identify the most accurate predictors of carcass composition. In simple regression, the percentage of lean in the 10 th rib was the most accurate predictor (r= 0. 88; P< 0. 001) of the lean proportion in the carcass {{and the percentage of}} fat in the 6 th rib was the best predictor (r= 0. 90; P< 0. 001) of the carcass fat content. The correlation coefficients for estimating the bone percentage in the carcass from the bone proportion in the ribs (6 th and 10 th) were low (r= 0. 63 and 0. 51 respectively), although significant (P< 0. 001) and the coefficient improved when the proportion of lean in the ribs was used as predictor (r= 0. 78 and 0. 70 for the 6 th and the 10 th rib respectively). In multiple regression, the addition of more regressors of the rib composition and carcass traits, such as carcass hot weight, the carcass fatness score and the weight of the kidney knob and <b>channel</b> <b>fat,</b> led to an improvement (P< 0. 05) in accuracy for some predictions. The results in general show that the accuracy of the predictions for the carcass composition obtained from dissection of both the 6 th and 10 th ribs was similar, although the dissection of the 10 th rib tended to overestimate the proportion of fat in the carcass. Therefore, considering the carcass quartering method for the extraction of the ribs, it is proposed that dissection of the 6 th rib is more appropriate than dissection of the 10 th rib so as not to reduce the carcass value and obtain a good estimate of the carcass composition...|$|E

The evaluated variables were: dialy weight gain (DWG) y and live weight and the canal, marbling, muscular development, dorsal <b>fat,</b> <b>channel</b> performance, spinal <b>fat</b> thickness (SFT), perirenal fat weight, thickness of the loin eye (TLE) and nally the cutting force (CT) as a parameter of the meat quality. No signi cance differences were found in daily weight gain, canal weight, marbling, muscular development and dorsal fat due to the effect of the ration (P> 0, 05). A breed component effect was found in the quality of the meat (P< 0, 05), where European animals presented softer meat in a ripening period of fourteen days (5, 32 vs 8, 53 kg) ...|$|R

The results obtained allow the following considerations about the local cattle breeds studied: (i) The Alentejana breed, with an adult body weight probably lower than that of the Friesian breed, has an higher growth rate. The heaviest Alentejana animals have less fat than Friesian animals of similar weight. The diets utilised do not significant alter the growth rate of the breed. (ii) The Barrosa breed, with an adult body weight probably higher than that of the Mertolenga breed, has a similar growth rate, and a fast fattening pattern in intensive systems. It has an important deposition of intramuscular fat. If this characteristic is not valorized, considering its consequences to meat quality, the Barrosa breed should be used in less intensive production system. (iii) Among the local breeds studies, Mertolenga seems to have the lower adult body weight. The younger animals do not adapt well to diets based in maize silage. It has a moderate growth rate and a fattening pattern characterised by a slow and/or less fat deposition. It has an important deposition of kidney knob and <b>channel</b> <b>fat,</b> that associated to the reproductive characteristics and maternal capacities pointed out to Mertolenga, may explain its main aptitude to be used as mother in beef production systems. This breed has also favourable characteristics to be used as purebred in meat production, namely high values for dressing percentage and muscle/bone ration.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{was to examine the}} effect of sire expected progeny difference (EPD) for carcass conformation score on the live animal and carcass traits of their progeny. In each of 4 years a Charolais sire of high and one of average EPD for carcass conformation score were mated to spring-calving suckler cows and the bull and heifer progeny were taken to slaughter at 455 (s. d. 25. 2) and 607 (s. d. 29. 5) days of age in 4 and 3 years, respectively. The difference in EPD between the sire EPD groups for carcass conformation and fat scores (scale 1 to 15), and carcass weight were, 0. 45 units, − 0. 53 units and 9. 7 kg, respectively. Muscularity scores were recorded at weaning (7 to 9 months of age) and pre-slaughter, and ultrasound measurements were recorded pre-slaughter. Carcass weight, and conformation and fat scores were recorded at slaughter and an 8 -rib pistola from the right side of each carcass was dissected into lean, fat and bone. There was no significant effect of sire EPD group on live weight or carcass weight, but kill-out proportion, ultrasound muscle depth and the Irish Cattle Breeding Federation muscularity scores were greater (P < 0. 001) for progeny of the high than the average EPD group. Bull progeny of high EPD sires had better (P < 0. 001) Signet muscularity scores and carcass conformation scores than bull progeny from average EPD sires, whereas there was no effect of sire EPD group on heifer progeny. Compared to progeny of the average EPD sire group, those from the high EPD group had a lower weight of kidney and <b>channel</b> <b>fat</b> (P  0. 06) and carcass fat score (P < 0. 05), lower proportions of fat (P < 0. 001) and bone (P < 0. 01) in the pistola, and higher weight of pistola, both absolutely (P < 0. 01) and relative to carcass weight (P < 0. 05), higher proportions of lean and high-value cuts in the pistola and higher carcass value (P < 0. 001). Linear regression analysis showed that a 1 unit increase in sire EPD for carcass conformation score increased (P < 0. 01) carcass lean proportion by 19. 4 g/kg. In conclusion, although sire EPD for carcass conformation score was reflected in the conformation score of intensively-reared bull progeny and not in extensively-reared heifer progeny, carcass lean proportion and carcass value were higher for both genders. peer-reviewe...|$|E
40|$|This study {{investigated}} {{the effects of a}} SNP in the myostatin gene (MSTN or growth differentiation factor 8, GDF 8) on birth, growth, carcass, and beef quality traits in Australia (Aust.) and New Zealand (NZ). The SNP is a cytosine to adenine transversion in exon 1, causing an amino acid substitution of leucine for phenylalanine 94 (F 94 L). The experiment used crosses between the Jersey and Limousin breeds, with the design being a backcross using first-cross bulls of Jersey x Limousin or Limousin x Jersey breeding, mated to Jersey and Limousin cows. Progeny were genotyped for the myostatin SNP and phenotyped in Aust., with finishing on feedlot (366 calves, over 3 birth years) and in NZ with finishing on pasture (416 calves, over 2 birth years). The effect of the F 94 L allele (A allele) on birth and growth traits was not significant. The F 94 L allele in Limousin backcross calves was associated with an increase in meat weight (7. 3 and 5. 9 % of the trait mean in Aust. and NZ, respectively, P < 0. 001), and a reduction in fat depth (– 13. 9 and – 18. 7 % of the trait means on live calves (600 d) and carcasses, respectively, Aust. only, P < 0. 001), intramuscular fat content (– 8. 2 % of the trait mean in Aust., P < 0. 05; – 7. 1 % in NZ, not significant), total carcass fat weight (– 16. 5 and – 8. 1 % of the trait mean, Aust. and NZ; P < 0. 001 and P < 0. 05, respectively). Meat tenderness, pH, and cooking loss of the M. longissimus dorsi were not affected by the F 94 L variant. In the Jersey backcross calves, additive and dominance effects were confounded because the F 94 L allele was not segregating in the Jersey dams. The combined effects, however, were significant on LM area (4. 4 % in both Aust., P < 0. 05, and NZ, P < 0. 01), <b>channel</b> <b>fat</b> (– 11. 7 %, NZ only, P < 0. 01), rib fat depth (– 11. 2 %, NZ only, P < 0. 05), and carcass fat weight (– 7. 1 %, NZ only, P < 0. 05). The results provide strong evidence that this myostatin F 94 L variant provides an intermediate and more useful phenotype than the more severe double-muscling phenotype caused by knockout mutations in the myostatin gene.

Cryo-SEM revealed that comminuting the lean meat with different chloride salts resulted in the formation of different types of gel structures. Differences were mainly in gel strand thickness, the degree of interlinking between strands and the size of pores within the gels. KCl and 1. 5 % NaCl formed multi-component, mixed gels in the lean meat system, but formed more uniform gels when fat was added. The other chloride salts produced similar types of gels in both the lean meat mixes and meat batters. Monovalent salts resulted in a good distribution of fat globules in coherent matrices. The divalent salts were shown to promote protein aggregation in raw batters. The CaC 12 batter showed some fat instability but the <b>fat</b> <b>channels</b> were not well interconnected. MgC 12 caused widespread <b>fat</b> <b>channelling</b> and matrix disruption which was also visible by LM. The results indicate that some gel formation occurs in meat batters prior to cooking and suggest that the type of gel formed may depend on the relative amounts and type of protein in the aqueous phase. It appears that MgC 12 destabilizes batters by causing extensive pre-cooking protein aggregation while CaC 12 destabilizes batters by increasing protein-protein interaction during cooking...|$|R

40|$|The {{growth rate}} and carcass {{characteristics}} of rangy and short conformation types of steers in Angus, Hereford and Beef Shorthorn breeds were compared in two trials (Trials X and XI) at Massey University. Rangy and short type weaner steers were chosen {{on the basis}} of visual assessment of conformation by experienced stockmen. The Angus steers in Trial X came from the one herd as did the Hereford steers in Trial XI. The two types of Angus (Trial XI) and Beef Shorthorn (Trial X) steers were bred in four different herds. Types within a breed were chosen by the same people, but different persons selected the representative steers in each breed. The steers were grazed together at pasture (except for a short period on a wintering yard in their second year of life) and weighed "full" at various intervals. They were slaughtered at an age of about 30 months. They were processed according to normal commercial practice and various aspects of carcass yield, composition and data on carcass weight, grade, fat colour, and chiller shrinkage were collected, various carcass measurements were taken and the weights of fat and bone were recorded for the right side quarters of each carcass. Fifteen steers were purchased of each type. Trial X concluded in March 1976 (after a period of 625 days) with 13 rangy and 14 short Angus steers, and 14 rangy and 15 short Beef Shorthorn steers. There were no animal losses in Trial XI (633 days) which finished in April 1977 (with 15 steers in each type group) in which the two types in the Angus and Hereford breeds were compared. The results were analysed within trials by the fitting constants procedure using fixed-effects linear models. Type effects were compared within each breed group. One model included {{the right side of the}} cold carcass as a covariate for some aspects of the carcass data analysed within a breed. Rangy type steers in each breed had heavier initial and final liveweights and carcass weights than short type steers. Rangy steers grew more rapidly than short steers in three of the four comparisons. There was no significant difference in growth rate between types of Angus steers in either trial. Rangy Angus steers gained 0. 02 kg/day (n. s.) more than short Angus steers in Trial X, but the short steers grew faster in Trial XIf 0. 03 kg/day (n. s.) and they may have exhibited compensatory growth in the first half of the trial. Rangy Beef Shorthorn and Hereford steers showed a greater superiority in growth rate (Beef Shorthorn 0. 07 kg/day, P< 0. 001; Hereford 0. 06 kg/day, P< 0. 001), compared with short type steers of these two breeds. These differences are important advantages in beef production, however the large difference in growth rate meant that because all steers were slaughtered at the same time (to meet the experimental design) the faster-growing Beef Shorthorn and Hereford steers were carried to much heavier weights than would be normal in most farming situations and this adversely affected their carcass composition, because of higher proportions of fat resulting from their heavier carcass weights. An analysis of the order in which steers were slaughtered showed that they moved into the stunning box independent of their type, breed group or liveweight. This finding indicated that data collection subsequent to the processing of the carcasses or in the boning-out of the quarters would be spread across types and breeds randomly. There were very small, non-significant differences between types in dressing-out percentage, carcass shrinkage in the chiller overnight (by weight, or as a percentage of hot carcass weight), and between the weight of the right and left sides of the carcass. This meant that the types tended to rank in the same order if their mean carcass composition was expressed on either a right side, cold or hot carcass basis, or liveweight basis. Preliminary statistical analysis showed there was little difference between types in the distribution of trimmed, boneless lean, bone and trimmed-off fat between the forequarters and hindquarters of the right sides. Therefore the data for each quarter were pooled and the composition of the right side of each carcass was compared between types. Rangy steers yielded a greater weight of trimmed, boneless lean and bone in each breed group. They yielded a lower weight of excess fat in Angus steers, but not in Beef Shorthorn or Hereford steers. There were small, inconsistent differences between types in the percentage of commercially trimmed boneless lean and bone, but larger differences in the percentage of excess fat trimmed from the right side of the carcass. The size of the type differences was influenced by right side weight. The ratio of trimmed meat to bone did not differ significantly between types, therefore it was concluded that the main determinant of the differences in the percentage yields was the amount of excess trimmed fat. Rangy steers tended to have a lower percentage of excess fat and were leaner than short steers except in the case of the Beef Shorthorns and Herefords. Angus types had similar amounts of kidney and <b>channel</b> <b>fat</b> (no significant difference between types in Trials X and XI, respectively). Rangy steers had more kidney and <b>channel</b> <b>fat</b> than short steers in Beef Shorthorns (1. 73 kg, P< 0. 05) and Herefords (2. 22 kg, P< 0. 01). When adjusted for right side weight there was less kidney and <b>channel</b> <b>fat</b> in rangy than short Angus (0. 72 kg, n. s. Trial X, 1. 72 kg, P< 0. 05 Trial XI) and Beef Shorthorns (0. 53 kg, n. s.), but slightly more in rangy Herefords (0. 53 kg, n. s.). Rangy Angus (Trial X) and Beef Shorthorn steers had less fat over the 12 th ribeye than short steers (2. 0 and 1. 5 mm, n. s., respectively). There was little difference in fat depth between Angus (Trial XI) and Hereford types (0. 6 and 0. 8 mm, n. s., respectively). When the depth of fat over the ribeye of the 12 th rib was adjusted for right side weight short steers had a slightly greater depth of fat than rangy steers in Angus (2. 5 mm, n. s.) and Beef Shorthorns (5. 1 mm, n. s.) in Trial X. However in Trial XI rangy Angus steers had a slightly greater depth of fat than short steers (0. 4 mm, n. s.), but there was no difference between types in Herefords. Rangy steers had larger ribeyes than short steers except in Herefords. The difference in ribeye areas between types was 2. 51 cm 2 (n. s.) in Angus Trial X, 6. 77 cm 2 (P< 0. 01) in Beef Shorthorns and 5. 81 cm 2 (P< 0. 05) in Angus Trial XI. Short Hereford steers had larger ribeye areas than rangy steers by 3. 77 cm 2 (n. s.). These differences were reduced and became non-significant when adjusted for right side weight except in Herefords where short steers had significantly largerribeyes (6. 76 cm 2, P< 0. 01). Rangy steers had longer carcasses than short steers and longer bone measurements. They had a deeper carcass than short steers in Beef Shorthorn and Hereford steers, but not in Angus steers. The measurement of the depth of the carcass was influenced by fatness which appeared visually to increase the depth of short carcasses in relation to their skeletal size. The types did nof differ in the ratio of carcass length to carcass depth. When carcass dimensions were adjusted for right side weight the differences between types generally became non-significant except in Beef Shorthorn cattle. Rangy steers had slightly greater measures of carcass length, length of the leg and forearm, but had shorter measures of carcass depth than short-type steers except in Beef Shorthorns although the differences were not large. It was concluded that selection of rangy- compared to short-type weaner steers by visual assessment of conformation resulted in more beef being produced by the Angus, Hereford and Beef Shorthorn cattle. The reasons for increased production were various. In each comparison between types the superior initial weight of rangy weaner steers contributed about half of the increase in final yield of lean (assuming a similar composition at weaning). Rapid growth rate of rangy steers in Beef Shorthorn and Herefords contributed to their increased yield of lean although they were over-finished as a consequence of their greater growth rate and the experimental design requiring all cattle to be slaughtered at one time. Growth rate was not found to be an important factor in Angus steers where it appeared that a small superiority in carcass composition resulted in a greater yield of lean meat from rangy steers. Analysis of carcass composition and dimensions at slaughter showed considerable variation within each type. Ratios of body length to depth did not differ and in this respect rangy steers were "bigger" and heavier than short steers though not disproportionately so in relation to weight. The variation within each type suggested that some steers would have been classified into the other group had this been done at the conclusion of the trial. The ratio of body length to chest depth is not a true measure of skeletal size because of the influence of carcass fat in measuring chost depth. It would thus be unwise to draw conclusions about proportionality in size from this study. The experiment has indirectly shown the importance of a heavy weaning weight, of rapid growth rate, and of lean content in beef production. The relative importance of other factors such as age, pre-weaning growth rate, sire and dam and the pre-trial environment could not be assessed with the cattle purchased for this investigation. Visual assessment was not consistent in terms of selection for the same trait. This may have been due to the effect of different persons (between breeds) and their interpretation of "types" and to the amount of phenotypic variation for type in the population from which the steers were selected. The trends observed in this study are in the right direction to improve beef production of traditional beef breeds. The concept will be of use to farmers and others who choose cattle with or without records. The carcasses were graded either P 1 or G in both trials. The number of carcasses in each grade were: Trial X G= 33, P 1 = 23; Trial XI G= 16, P 1 = 44, An analysis tested the hypothesis that there were no differences between grades in carcass characteristics. Carcasses graded G were heavier (15. 4 kg, P< 0. 05) in Trial X, but not significantly so in Trial XI (7. 9 kg, n. s.). They had no more kidney and <b>channel</b> <b>fat</b> (1. 10 kg, n. s., Trial X and 0. 56 kg, n. s. Trial XI) than carcasses graded P 1. Results for other carcass characteristics were inconsistent between trials. Carcasses graded G in Trial X had a greater depth of fat over the 12 th ribeye (2. 4 mm, P< 0. 05), and a greater proportion of excess fat and less trimmed lean of the right side of the carcass (2. 26 % fat, P< 0. 001, and 1. 58 % lean, P< 0. 05). These results agree with grade expectations. In Trial XI however, carcasses graded G had the same fat depth over the 12 th ribeye (0. 0 mm, n. s.), less excess fat trim and more lean as a percentage of right side weight (1. 74 % fat, P< 0. 01, 1. 72 % lean, P< 0. 05) in direct contradiction to the results of Trial X and of grade expectations. Subjective visual assessment of fat depth from the uncut surface of the carcass resulted in 60 and 88 percent of carcasses being wrongly classified in relation to G grade standards (Trials X and XI, respectively). Graders had more success in classifying "leaner" carcasses 30 and 25 percent of carcasses graded P 1 had fat depths outside the grade specification (Trials X and XI, respectively) and then by only a few millimetres. Carcasses graded G in Trial X were of a similar "size" to those graded P 1, but were heavier, whereas in Trial XI carcasses graded G were "larger", but of a similar weight...|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine how an initial fatigue bout (FAT 1 at 37 °C) affects free myoplasmic Ca 2 + concentration and force ([Ca 2 +]i/force) during a subsequent fatigue bout (FAT 2) in mouse flexor digitorum brevis (FDB). During FAT 1, both tetanic [Ca 2 +]i/force decreased; however, they decreased to significantly lower levels when FAT 1 was carried out in the presence of glibenclamide, a sarcolemmal KATP (sKATP) channel blocker. Glibenclamide also elicited greater increases in unstimulated [Ca 2 +]i/force, which occurred when fibres failed to fully relax between contractions during FAT 1. Finally, glibenclamide impaired force recovery after FAT 1. The decreases in tetanic [Ca 2 +]i/force and increases in unstimulated [Ca 2 +]i/force were slower during FAT 2 elicited 60 min after FAT 1. Under control conditions, the effects were small with very few significant differences. In the presence of glibenclamide, on the other hand, the differences between FAT 1 and FAT 2 were very large. Unexpectedly, the differences in unstimulated and tetanic [Ca 2 +]i/force between control and glibenclamide conditions observed during FAT 1 were no longer observed during FAT 2. The lack of differences was not related to a failure of glibenclamide to block KATP <b>channels</b> during <b>FAT</b> 2 because the effects of FAT 1 on FAT 2 were also observed using Kir 6. 2 −/− mouse FDB, which lack sKATP channel activity. The differences in [Ca 2 +]i/force between FAT 1 and FAT 2 could be observed with FAT 1 duration of just 30 s and a FAT 1 –FAT 2 interval of at least 30 min. A modulation of factors involved in ischaemic pre-conditioning, i. e. A 1 -adenosine receptors, sKATP and mitochondrial KATP (mKATP) channels, PKC and reactive oxygen species, during FAT 1 had no effect on FAT 2 fatigue kinetics. It is concluded that a preceding fatigue bout triggers an acute physiological process that prevents the contractile dysfunction induced by non-functioning KATP channels...|$|R

The SPM nanocrystals are assembled in clusters (diameter, 1 – 2 m). About 10 to 15 of these clusters occur inside one nerve terminal, arranged along the cell membrane. Each SPM cluster is embedded in a solid fibrous cup, open towards the cell surface, to which the cluster adheres by delicate fiber strands. In addition to the SPM clusters, a second inorganic iron compound has been identified: noncrystalline platelets of iron phosphate (about 500 nm wide and long and maximally 100 nm thick) that occur along a fibrous core of the terminal. The anatomic features suggested that these nerve endings could detect small intensity changes of the geomagnetic field. Such stimuli can induce deformations of the SPM clusters, which could be transduced into primary receptor potentials by mechanosensitive membrane receptor <b>channels.</b> The subepidermal <b>fat</b> cells surrounding the nerve endings prevent the inside from external mechanical stimuli.

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{considers}} the non-cooperative maximization of mutual {{information in the}} vector Gaussian interference channel in a fully distributed fashion via game theory. This problem has been widely studied {{in a number of}} works during the past decade for frequency-selective channels, and recently for the more general MIMO case, for which the state-of-the art results are valid only for nonsingular square channel matrices. Surprisingly, these results do not hold true when the channel matrices are rectangular and/or rank deficient matrices. The goal {{of this paper is to}} provide a complete characterization of the MIMO game for arbitrary channel matrices, in terms of conditions guaranteeing both the uniqueness of the Nash equilibrium and the convergence of asynchronous distributed iterative waterfilling algorithms. Our analysis hinges on new technical intermediate results, such as a new expression for the MIMO waterfilling projection valid (also) for singular matrices, a mean-value theorem for complex matrix-valued functions, and a general contraction theorem for the multiuser MIMO watefilling mapping valid for arbitrary channel matrices. The quite surprising result is that uniqueness/convergence conditions in the case of tall (possibly singular) channel matrices are more restrictive than those required in the case of (full rank) <b>fat</b> <b>channel</b> matrices. We also propose a modified game and algorithm with milder conditions for the uniqueness of the equilibrium and convergence, and virtually the same performance (in terms of Nash equilibria) of the original game.
