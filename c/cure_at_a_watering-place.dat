5000|$|In {{the summer}} of 1842 Spiess {{returned}} to Germany, drawn by the signs of approaching gymnastic revival in Prussia {{and the desire to}} discuss his own views with other men of like interests. A Prussian cabinet order of June 6, 1842, had stated physical training was [...] "formally recognized as a necessary and indispensable part of male education." [...] Spiess found Hans Ferdinand Massmann, at Munich, too firmly wedded to Turnen of his student days to receive with any sympathy the proposed innovations, but Jahn, whose guest he was for two days in Freyburg, and Eiselen, whom he saw <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>watering-place</b> near Berlin, were more cordial in their attitude.|$|R

No formal engagement of the young pair had been announced as yet, but it was clear that their mutual understanding could not end in anything but marriage without grievous disappointment to one of the parties at least. Not that Frances was sentimental. She was rather of the imperious sort, indeed; and, to say all, the young girl had not fulfilled her father's expectations of her. But he hoped and worked for her welfare as sincerely as any father could do.|$|R
60|$|Now this {{indifference}} puzzled Lady Penelope's game extremely, and irritated {{her desire}} {{to get at the}} bottom of Tyrrel's mystery, if there was one, and secure him to her own party. If you were ever <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>watering-place,</b> reader, you know that while the guests do not always pay the most polite attention to unmarked individuals, the appearance of a stray lion makes an interest as strong as it is reasonable, and the Amazonian chiefs of each coterie, like the hunters of Buenos-Ayres, prepare their lasso, and manoeuvre to the best advantage they can, each hoping to noose the unsuspicious monster, and lead him captive to her own menagerie. A few words concerning Lady Penelope Penfeather will explain why she practised this sport with even more than common zeal.|$|R
60|$|The {{society of}} such places is regulated, {{by their very}} nature, upon a scheme much more indulgent than that which rules the world of fashion, and the narrow circles of rank in the metropolis. The titles of rank, birth, and fortune, are {{received}} <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>watering-place</b> without any very strict investigation, as adequate to the purpose {{for which they are}} preferred; and as the situation infers a certain degree of intimacy and sociability for the time, so to whatever heights it may have been carried, it is not understood to imply any duration beyond the length of the season. No intimacy can be supposed more close for the time, and more transitory in its endurance, than that which is attached to <b>a</b> <b>watering-place</b> acquaintance. The novelist, therefore, who fixes upon such a scene for his tale, endeavours to display a species of society, where the strongest contrast of humorous characters and manners may be brought to bear on and illustrate each other with less violation of probability, than could be supposed to attend the same miscellaneous assemblage in any other situation.|$|R
60|$|It is true that, in some few instances, the pleroma of aristocratic dignity {{undergoes}} {{a sort of}} acetic fermentation, and comes out in ungenial qualities.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the effects of}} curing conditions {{on the performance of}} steel/CFRP double strap joints subjected to combined loading, cyclic temperature and humidity. A series of joints, <b>cured</b> respectively <b>at</b> <b>an</b> elevated temperature (120 degrees C) and room temperature (about 23 degrees C) were exposed to different combined environmental and loading conditions. It was found that <b>curing</b> <b>at</b> <b>an</b> elevated temperature had no effects on the joint ultimate strength tested at room temperature. However, at 50 degrees C, the joints <b>cured</b> <b>at</b> 120 degrees C showed almost no strength reduction, in comparison to those <b>cured</b> <b>at</b> room temperature with a 50 % strength reduction. <b>Curing</b> <b>at</b> elevated temperature also helped to improve the time-to-failure of joints: joints <b>cured</b> <b>at</b> room temperature failed within less than 2 h when exposed to the environmental conditions, while joints <b>cured</b> <b>at</b> 120 degrees C could survive up to 270 h, dependent on the applied load levels. Partial safety factors proposed in design guidelines for FRP composites under environmental effects were used to evaluate the experimental results obtained, suggesting a very critical degradation of joint mechanical properties due to the environmental effects investigated in this study...|$|R

In fibre reinforced polymer composite materials, this is more difficult in comparison to isotropic materials as they are made up of two constituents: the fibre and the matrix.

This curing regime is known to introduce residual stresses to the composite material as it cools from the high cure temperature.
