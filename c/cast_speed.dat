40|$|Abstract: A direct-chill (DC) cast {{process of}} an {{aluminum}} ingot of size 3200 × 1292 × 320 mm 3 is analyzed numerically by {{the analysis of}} a fixed controlled system. The study investigates the DC processes in which liquid aluminum is cooling continuously in mold and then with water spray at the exit of mold. An inverse method is applied to measure heat transfer coefficient on water cooling surface experimentally. A correlation of heat transfer coefficient with surface temperature is used in numerical simulation. It has been approved that the defected curl and tears are caused by the higher rates of initial cooling and solidifying in mold and the sweat and liquation are caused by the isolation of heat transfer by air gap formed between cast solid surface and the mold wall by volume shrinkage with solidification. The present research analyzes the variations of temperature profiles in the cast ingot by the changes of <b>cast</b> <b>speed</b> and cast temperature and assesses the improvements of mold and cast process for the better cast quality...|$|E
40|$|The {{need for}} lighter weight {{vehicles}} to improve fuel efficiency {{is becoming increasingly}} imperative. Sheet magnesium alloys offer the potential as a light weight material {{for use in the}} transportation industry due to their high specific strength and stiffness. In fact, magnesium alloys have the highest strength-to-weight ratio of all the common structural metals. Though the demand for light weight materials is present and sheet magnesium is available, the use of these materials in automotive applications has been rather limited due to high production costs and poor corrosion performance and formability. A promising process to produce wrought magnesium sheet in a more cost effective manner is Twin Roll Casting (TRC). In addition, enhanced corrosion resistance and ductility may be realized in these sheet alloys with the possible introduction of a clad layer during the TRC process thereby producing a laminate sheet where the surface properties are different from the core. The focus of this research was to investigate the potential of cladding magnesium alloy AZ 31 material during the TRC process. As part of this research, a thermal fluid mathematical model of the TRC process was developed, which was then further refined to include the addition of a clad layer during the process. The TRC model was validated through experimental work conducted at the Pohang Institute of Science and Technology (POSTECH University), where TRC experiments of AZ 31 were conducted under various casting conditions. The as-cast microstructure of the AZ 31 sheets were characterized and measurements of the secondary dendrite arm spacing (SDAS) made at the mid-region were compared to predicted microstructures from the TRC model based on solidification history. The predicted SDAS matched with the measured values, thus, validating the model. Using the validated TRC model the feasibility of adding a clad layer was assessed and various simulations were conducted to observe the effects of <b>cast</b> <b>speed,</b> cast thickness, and clad material on the thermal history and temperature profile in both the clad and core domains. The material properties and clad thickness did not seem to impact the temperature profiles significantly, while the <b>cast</b> <b>speed</b> and initial temperature dictated whether or not the cast would be successful. Using these operational parameters a process window was created (based on the CANMET facility) to illustrate the feasibility of casting and cladding during TRC. This window is beneficial for future experimentation and understanding the effects of these casting parameters...|$|E

These billets are commonly being produced by continuous casting involving agitation of the solidifying melt.

The machine has been used to study the influence of various process parameters such as electromagnetic stirring strength and <b>casting</b> <b>speed</b> in the production of Al billet with a diameter of 76 mm.

40|$|An {{overview}} of {{two categories of}} numerical approaches to phase change problems, front tracking and fixed domain methods, is given. A further comparison of several fixed domain methods is made with some benchmark test problems. The approximation of the latent heat for isothermal phase change is a key point for these numerical approaches. Generally the space-average approach {{is better than the}} others. The Euler backward, Crank-Nicolson, and Dupont schemes are the best for thermal analysis involving phase changes. The new effective and apparent capacity methods can eliminate the need of an artificially assumed temperature range for isothermal transformation and obtain accurate results. They are also computationally efficient compared with other methods. The new apparent capacity technique is invoked to model the isothermal part of phase change for several solidification models. The same approach is applied to the thermal analyses of the casting processes and the results are in good agreement with experiment data. A convective type interface element formulation is derived for the heat transfer at the interface of the cast and the mold, which can simplify the element matrix calculation. A thermal elasto-plastic stress model is derived and the public domain software NIKE 2 D is used for the stress analyses of the casting processes. The initial stage of ingot cooling in the mold and the continuous casting process are simulated. The latent heat released during solidification can affect the temperature field and the phase transformation in the solid state has an essential effect on the stress generation. The cast size, material hardening effect, and <b>cast</b> <b>speed</b> are all important factors for the temperature and stress distributions...|$|E
40|$|Approximately 68 % of the {{aluminum}} {{produced in the}} United States is first cast into ingots prior to further processing into sheet, plate, extrusions, or foil. The direct chill (DC) semi-continuous casting process has been the mainstay of {{the aluminum}} industry {{for the production of}} ingots due largely to its robust nature and relative simplicity. Though the basic process of DC casting is in principle straightforward, the interaction of process parameters with heat extraction, microstructural evolution, and development of solidification stresses is too complex to analyze by intuition or practical experience. One issue in DC casting is the formation of stress cracks [1 - 15]. In particular, the move toward larger ingot cross-sections, the use of higher casting speeds, and an ever-increasing array of mold technologies have increased industry efficiencies but have made it more difficult to predict the occurrence of stress crack defects. The Aluminum Industry Technology Roadmap [16] has recognized the challenges inherent in the DC casting process and the control of stress cracks and selected the development of 'fundamental information on solidification of alloys to predict microstructure, surface properties, and stresses and strains' as a high-priority research need, and the 'lack of understanding of mechanisms of cracking as a function of alloy' and 'insufficient understanding of the aluminum solidification process', which is 'difficult to model', as technology barriers in aluminum casting processes. The goal of this Aluminum Industry of the Future (IOF) project was to assist the aluminum industry in reducing the incidence of stress cracks from the current level of 5 % to 2 %. Decreasing stress crack incidence is important for improving product quality and consistency as well as for saving resources and energy, since considerable amounts of cast metal could be saved by eliminating ingot cracking, by reducing the scalping thickness of the ingot before rolling, and by eliminating butt sawing. Full-scale industrial implementation {{of the results of the}} proposed research would lead to energy savings in excess of 6 trillion Btu by the year 2020. The research undertaken in this project aimed to achieve this objective by a collaboration of industry, university, and national laboratory personnel through Secat, Inc., a consortium of aluminum companies. During the four-year project, the industrial partners and the research team met in 16 quarterly meetings to discuss research results and research direction. The industrial partners provided guidance, facilities, and experience to the research team. The research team went to two industrial plants to measure temperature distributions in commercial 60, 000 -lb DC casting ingot production. The project focused on the development of a fundamental understanding of ingot cracking and detailed models of thermal conditions, solidification, microstructural evolution, and stress development during the initial transient in DC castings of the aluminum alloys 3004 and 5182. The microstructure of the DC casting ingots was systematically characterized. Carefully designed experiments were carried out at the national laboratory and university facilities as well as at the industrial locations using the industrial production facilities. The advanced computational capabilities of the national laboratories were used for thermodynamic and kinetic simulations of phase transformation, heat transfer and fluid flow, solidification, and stress-strain evolution during DC casting. The achievements of the project are the following: (1) Identified the nature of crack formation during DC casting; (2) Developed a novel method for determining the mechanical properties of an alloy at the nonequilibrium mushy zone of the alloy; (3) Measured heat transfer coefficients (HTCs) between the solidifying ingot and the cooling water jet; (4) Determined the material constitutive model at high temperatures; and (5) Developed computational capabilities for the simulation of cracking formation in DC casting ingot. The models and the database developed in this project have been used to predict crack formation and to determine the optimal conditions for DC casting. The results demonstrated that cracking formation is strongly affected by casting conditions and the composition of the alloy. Scrap rate due to crack formation can be significantly reduced by controlling the <b>cast</b> <b>speed</b> and the concentrations of the alloy...|$|E

Under a given caster length of 47 m, the basic requirement under this value is to achieve 2. 7 m/min <b>casting</b> <b>speed</b> for 250 mm x 1600 mm in slab section. In order to ensure stable operation for this high <b>casting</b> <b>speed,</b> many technologies were newly developed and implemented during the revamping process.

40|$|Heat {{transfer}} in the mold {{is the heart}} of the continuous casting process and its quantitative analysis was pioneered by Keith Brimacombe. With many different processes currently competing, it is appropriate to apply modeling to investigate the theoretical limits of continuous <b>casting</b> <b>speed</b> and productivity. The heat transfer rate during solidification processes drops with time so the shell thickness at mold exit drops with increasing <b>casting</b> <b>speed.</b> A computational heat flow model similar to those of Brimacombe is applied to investigate the consequences of very high <b>casting</b> <b>speed</b> on shell thickness at mold exit. Next, a finite-element stress model is applied to predict the minimum shell thickness at mold exit that should have sufficient strength to avoid rupture due to longitudinal tearing of the weak shell under the forces of ferrostatic pressure. The critical shell thickness is predicted to be on the order of 3 mm for most grades and casting conditions. The models are then applied to predict maximum <b>casting</b> <b>speeds</b> for different steel grades, section sizes, and mold lengths. The theoretical limits to <b>casting</b> <b>speed</b> are predicted to be extremely high, exceeding 21 m/min for a conventional 800 -mm long, 200 -mm square bloom mold, which corresponds to 3. 5 million tonnes per year.

The asymmetric membranes with the molecular-oriented skin layer were prepared by a simple dry/wet phase inversion technique with forced convection using a newly developed pneumatically-controlled casting system. Experimental investigation was conducted focusing on different <b>casting</b> <b>speed,</b> thus representing different rheological conditions. <b>Casting</b> <b>speed</b> was varied from 5 s to 60 s, as known that varying <b>casting</b> <b>speed</b> would vary shear rate. Rheologically induced molecular orientation on the skin layer of membrane was measured using fourier transform attenuated total reflection spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR) to examine whether higher shear rate may induce anisotropy at the molecular level of the membrane. These rheological results were then correlated to the gas separation performance in four different pure gases. The results indicated that the highly sheared asymmetric membranes tend to exhibit greater molecular orientation in the skin layer. As the <b>casting</b> <b>speed</b> increased, the level of shear experienced on the membrane surface layer also increased, thus this was leading to greater molecular orientation in the skin layer.

The results are validated with measurements on operating steel continuous slab-casting machines, and presented for practical conditions {{with the aid}} of an inverse model. Initial clogging is predicted to enhance the flow due to a potential streamlining effect before it becomes great enough to restrict the flow channel. The clogging condition can be detected by comparing the measured steel flow rate to the theoretical value predicted under the same conditions by the inverse model presented here. Increasing argon injection may help to reduce air aspiration by increasing the minimum pressure below the slide gate.

40|$|Asymmetrical {{and lower}} heat {{transport}} {{caused by the}} cladding strip during twin-roll casting (TRC) of clad sheet makes the process window narrow compared with traditional TRC. The effect of pouring temperature on process stability is more remarkable when it is relatively high under high <b>casting</b> <b>speed</b> and <b>casting</b> <b>speed</b> becomes a leading factor when its value is low. The inter-diffusion zone width at the Al/Fe interface depends on the solid/semi-solid contacting time. The longer the time is, the wider the inter-diffusion zone. A widest zone of 3. 8 μm is attained under condition of <b>casting</b> <b>speed</b> of 1. 25 m/min and pouring temperature of 720 °C. Bonding strength of clad sheet by TRC depends on inter-diffusion zone width and rolling reduction. Proper combinations of inter-diffusion zone width and rolling reduction can result in same high bonding strength. The highest bonding strength of 16 N/mm is attained under a combination of rolling reduction of 29 % and inter-diffusion zone of 3. 7 μm. The wetting of aluminum melt on steel surface is uneven and insufficient {{as a result of}} short contacting time in TRC. As a result, same rolling reduction in TRC induces lower bonding strength than in roll bonding process. Bonding strength of clad sheet by TRC decreases when the surface of the steel strip is brushed, as a result of decrement of actual contacting area...|$|R
40|$|DHP Copper {{tubes are}} {{frequently}} used in industrial applications with their unique {{characteristics such as}} high corrosion or excellent erosion resistance. Due to the requirement of good quality production, an excellent global factor is needed {{for the purpose of}} obtaining high mechanical properties. A mechanical properties has correlation with grain size and a high mechanical properties is achieved by small grain structure. There are three ways in which grain size can be altered: by thermal means, chemical means and by mechanical means. This paper looks at the first case, thermal means, which has very substantial cost benefits over the other two types of grain refinement in that it does not require large pieces of equipment that vibrate or mix and does not use any exotic metals as feed stock. Instead what thermal methods require is a change in parameters like: <b>casting</b> <b>speed,</b> liquid metal temperature or cooling water temperature. In this work, characterization of the influence of <b>casting</b> <b>speed</b> on the structure and mechanical properties of continuous cast DHP copper tube has been carried out by drift expanding test and grain size reading. A significant different based on grain structure has been investigated and it was also found that the <b>casting</b> <b>speed</b> could improve the elongation of samples from 29 % expanding to 36 % expanding...|$|R
