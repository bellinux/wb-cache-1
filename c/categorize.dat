5|$|Angelou was {{challenged}} by her friend, author James Baldwin, and her editor, Robert Loomis, {{to write an}} autobiography that was also a piece of literature. Reviewers often <b>categorize</b> Caged Bird as autobiographical fiction because Angelou uses thematic development and other techniques common to fiction, but the prevailing critical view characterizes it as an autobiography, a genre she attempts to critique, change, and expand. The book covers topics common to autobiographies written by Black American women {{in the years following}} the Civil Rights Movement: a celebration of Black motherhood; a critique of racism; the importance of family; and the quest for independence, personal dignity, and self-definition.|$|E

Friedländer's initial work introduced the Gram stain, a fundamental laboratory test still used today to identify and <b>categorize</b> bacteria. Christian Gram's paper describing the procedure in 1884 helped to differentiate the two bacteria, and showed that pneumonia could be caused by more than one microorganism.|$|E

40|$|Background and Purpose : Stroke {{severity}} and dependency {{are often}} <b>categorized</b> to allow stratification for randomization or analysis. However, there is uncertainty whether the categorizations used for different stroke scales are equivalent. We investigated {{the amount of}} information retained by <b>categorizing</b> severity and dependency, and whether the currently used cut-offs are equivalent across different stroke scales. Methods : Stroke severity and dependency have been <b>categorized</b> as mild, moderate, or severe. We studied 2 acute stroke unit cohorts, measuring Scandinavian Stroke Scale (SSS), modified Rankin Scale (mRS), Barthel Index (BI), and modified National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (mNIHSS). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were examined to determine the ability of full and <b>categorized</b> scales to predict death and dependency. A weighted kappa analysis assessed agreement between the <b>categorized</b> scales. Results : When scales are <b>categorized,</b> the area under the ROC curve is significantly reduced; however, the differences are small and may not be practically important. BI, mRS, and SSS all have excellent agreement with each other when <b>categorized,</b> whereas mNIHSS has substantial agreement with mRS and BI. Conclusions : Little predictive information is lost when stroke scales are <b>categorized.</b> There is substantial to almost perfect agreement among <b>categorized</b> scales. Therefore the use and categorization of a variety of stroke severity or dependency scales is acceptable in analyses. </p...|$|R

For the Maguindanao, three to five typical genres can be distinguished: Duyug, Sinulog, Tidtu, Binalig and Tagonggo. The Maranao on the other hand have only three typical genres—Kapromayas/Romayas, Kapagonor/Onor, and Katitik Pandai/Kapaginandang.|$|E

5|$|All {{seven of}} Angelou's {{installments}} {{of her life}} story are {{in the tradition of}} African-American autobiography. Starting with I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings, Angelou challenges the usual structure of the autobiography by critiquing, changing, and expanding the genre. Angelou said in 1989 that she is the only serious writer to choose autobiography to express herself, but she reports not one person's story, but the collective's. Scholar Selwyn R. Cudjoe writes that Angelou is representative of the convention in African-American autobiography as a public gesture that speaks for an entire group of people. Her use of devices common in fictional writing, such as dialog, characterization and thematic development, has led some reviewers to <b>categorize</b> her books as autobiographical fiction.|$|E

He began writing classical music in high school, {{while at the same}} time playing drums in rhythm and blues bands; later switching to electric guitar. His 1966 debut album with the Mothers of Invention, Freak Out!, combined songs in conventional rock and roll format with collective improvisations and studio-generated sound collages. He continued this eclectic and experimental approach, irrespective of whether the fundamental format was rock, jazz or classical.|$|E

5|$|Heins {{examines}} {{the question of}} whether children and adolescents are negatively impacted by exposure to violence and pornography, contending that youth are not endangered by sexually explicit material.

Heins explores whether the government or parents should restrict children's access to potentially inappropriate material, believing that the decision should rest primarily with parents. She writes that there is no simple tactic by which government can censor material from children without violating First-Amendment rights guaranteed to adults. Heins warns that attempting to <b>categorize</b> forms of creative expression in order to prohibit particular works of art results in censorship choices which reflect an ideological point-of-view.|$|E
