Celia had been a good student in her youth, graduating from high school at age fifteen, yet could not further her own education because her family chose to send her brother to college instead. Celia wanted her daughter to get more education, which she thought would allow Ruth to become a high school history teacher. Ruth attended James Madison High School, whose law program later dedicated a <b>courtroom</b> <b>in</b> her honor. Celia struggled with cancer throughout Ruth's high school years and died the day before Ruth's high school graduation.|$|E
5|$|Oscar Finley and Wally Figg are the bickering {{partners}} {{of a small}} law firm in the South Side of Chicago; in fact, {{for much of the}} time they are just a pair of ambulance chasers. Oscar's character holds the firm together despite the childish and unethical behavior of Wally, his junior partner. Their bickering is often mediated by Rochelle, the highly competent African American secretary, who had learned a lot of law in her eight years in the office. Meanwhile, David Zinc, a graduate of the Harvard Law School, is completely fed up with the grinding and dehumanizing – though well-paid – life of an associate in the law firm of Rogan Rothberg, where in five years of work he had never seen the inside of a <b>courtroom,</b> <b>in</b> fact, David's expertise was in long-term bonds a job he hated. David suddenly breaks away, goes on a drinking binge and by chance finds himself at the Finley & Figg office. Feeling an elevating sense of freedom and vowing never to go back, Zinc willingly relegates himself to working for the two disreputable street lawyers and ambulance chasers.|$|E

The sentence was greeted with gasps from around the <b>courtroom.</b> <b>In</b> Indonesia an execution is generally carried out by firing squad, often at night in an isolated location.

25|$|According to Pușcariu's own research, {{the family}} {{originated}} in Maramureș, {{spending time in}} Moldavia before ending up in southern Transylvania. Named Iuga in Maramureș, their surname was then Pușcașu before the final form was selected {{at the suggestion of}} Bishop Ioan Lemeni. In {{the latter part of the}} 18th century, one Iuga Pușcașu left Țara Făgărașului and arrived at Sohodol village near Bran; it was from two of his sons that the prominent family was descended. Sextil's grandfather Ioan Pușcașu, a priest from Sohodol, had five sons and five daughters, providing all of them a rigorous education. One son was Ioan Pușcariu, who became a noted jurist and historian, while another, Ilarion, left his mark as a theologian. Sextil's father Iosif (1835-1923) studied at the Transylvanian Saxon high school in Brașov before being sent to learn Theology in Sibiu. Metropolitan Andrei Șaguna observed that Iosif lacked a priestly vocation and gave him permission to leave the seminary in order to study Law. After graduating from the Saxon Law Academy, where he published a humor newsletter, the elder Pușcariu served as a judge in Zărnești from 1848 to 1867, running his <b>courtroom</b> <b>in</b> Romanian. After marrying Eufrosina Ciurcu, who came from a merchant family, he moved to Brașov to work as a lawyer. Applying his literary talent, he founded Cocoșul Roșu, a humor magazine, editing it between 1874 and 1878 and in 1881.|$|E
