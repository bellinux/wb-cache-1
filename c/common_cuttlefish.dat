5|$|Deimatic {{behaviour}} {{is found}} in cephalopods including the <b>common</b> <b>cuttlefish</b> Sepia officinalis, squid such as the Caribbean reef squid (Sepioteuthis sepioidea) and bigfin reef squid (Sepioteuthis lessoniana), octopuses including the common octopus Octopus vulgaris and the Atlantic white-spotted octopus (Octopus macropus), and the paper nautilus (Argonauta argo). Deimatic cephalopod displays involve suddenly creating bold stripes, often reinforced by stretching out the animal's arms, fins or web {{to make it look}} as big and threatening as possible.|$|E
5|$|For example, in the <b>common</b> <b>cuttlefish</b> {{the display}} {{consists}} of flattening the body, making the skin pale, showing {{a pair of}} eyespots on the mantle, dark eye rings, and a dark line on the fins, and dilating the pupils of the eyes. The common octopus similarly displays pale skin and dark eye rings with dilated pupils, but also curls its arms and stretches out the web between the arms as far as possible, and squirts out jets of water. Other octopuses such as Atlantic white-spotted octopus turn bright brownish red with oval white spots all over in a high contrast display. The paper nautilus can rapidly change its appearance: it suddenly withdraws the shining iridescent web formed by its first pair of arms from its shell.|$|E

40|$|The <b>common</b> Chinese <b>cuttlefish</b> (Sepiella japonica) {{has been}} {{considered}} one of the most economically important marine Cephalopod species in East Asia and seed breeding technology has been established for massive aquaculture and stock enhancement. In the present study, we used Illumina HiSeq 2000 to sequence, assemble and annotate the transcriptome of the ovary tissues of S. japonica for the first time. A total of 53, 116, 650 and 53, 446, 640 reads were obtained from the immature and matured ovaries, respectively (NCBI SRA database SRX 1409472 and SRX 1409473), and 70, 039 contigs (N 50  =  1443  bp) were obtained after de novo assembling with Trinity software. Digital gene expression analysis reveals 47, 288 contigs show differential expression profile and 793 contigs are highly expressed in the immature ovary, while 38 contigs are highly expressed in the mature ovary with FPKM > 100. We hope that the ovarian transcriptome and those stage-enriched transcripts of S. japonica can provide some insight into the understanding of genome-wide transcriptome profile of cuttlefish gonad tissue and give useful information in cuttlefish gonad development...|$|R

The <b>common</b> <b>cuttleﬁsh</b> can display 34 chromatic, six textural, eight postural and six locomotor elements, whereas flamboyant cuttlefish use between 42 and 75 chromatic, seven textural, 14 postural, and seven locomotor elements.

40|$|Taking into {{consideration}} {{the changes in the}} rules for the price support for agricultural and sea products, it seems appropriate to find out what other means could be used to cover the price risk {{in order to protect the}} commercial margin of these sectors of activity. The use of derivatives tools helps achieve this objective. We first emphasize the interest of such a study for fresh seafood markets and make a brief presentation of the various tools available to facilitate the understanding of future choices. Then we conduct a statistical analysis concerning the <b>common</b> sole and <b>cuttlefish</b> French markets which shows a good correlation level between sizes, presentations, qualities and the possibility to launch indices by species and OTC optional transactions on them.

40|$|The huge {{development}} of bioengineering {{during the last}} years has boosted the search for new bioinspired materials, with tunable chemical, mechanical, and optoelectronic properties {{for the design of}} semiconductors, batteries, biosensors, imaging and therapy probes, adhesive hydrogels, tissue restoration, photoprotectors, etc. These new materials should complement or replace metallic or organic polymers that cause cytotoxicity and some adverse health effects. One of the most interesting biomaterials is melanin and synthetic melanin-related molecules. Melanin has a controversial molecular structure, dependent on the conditions of polymerization, and therefore tunable. It is found in animal hair and skin, although one of the <b>common</b> sources is <b>cuttlefish</b> (Sepia officinalis) ink. On the other hand, mussels synthesize adhesive proteins to anchor these marine animals to wet surfaces. Both melanin and mussel foot proteins contain a high number of catecholic residues, and their properties are related to these groups. Dopamine (DA) can easily polymerize to get polydopamine melanin (PDAM), that somehow shares properties with melanin and mussel proteins. Furthermore, PDAM can easily be conjugated with other components. This review accounts for the main aspects of melanin, as well as DA-based melanin-like materials, related to their biomedical and biotechnological applications...|$|R
40|$|The marine {{recreational}} fishing (MRF) {{represents one of}} the most popular activities along the coasts of numerous countries around the world, in particular in the Mediterranean Sea. Despite the evidences of potential effects on the marine biodiversity and commercially exploited stocks, a sound information base and adequate management plans are still lacking, both at the national and basin level. An analysis of the MRF on the West coasts of the Adriatic Sea was carried out, in 2014, by using a standardized questionnaires approach, aiming to describe the state of the art and to preliminarily assess catches, in comparison with the commercial ones, at the regional scale. Gilt-headed seabream, European seabass, cuttlefish, squid and Atlantic bluefin tuna resulted the anglers' preferred species, even if the top five in term of caught biomass were bluefin tuna, seabream, <b>cuttlefish,</b> <b>common</b> dolphinfish and little tunny, in the order (accounting up to 60 % of total catches). The exploitation level resulted to be significant, as confirmed by the comparison with commercial fisheries, being the MRF captures 30 % or 45 % of the artisanal fishery in the same area, with some species, such as bluefish, bonito, pandora and picarel, showing larger values. The preliminary assessment of ecological effects, highlighted that the exploitation use about 10 %- 16 % of energy fixed by the primary production (Primary Production Required to sustain fishery), but the ecosystem effects are still sustainable (Lindex and probability to be sustainable fished). However, combining catches by MRF with those by small scale fishery completely changes the situation, showing an unsustainable condition, suggesting the need for taking into the account also MRF in the future management planning for the Adriatic coastal area...|$|R
2500|$|The <b>common</b> <b>cuttlefish</b> (Sepia officinalis), {{is found}} in the Mediterranean, and North and Baltic Seas, {{although}} it has been suggested populations occur as far south as South Africa.

40|$|International audienceLittle {{is known}} about the immune system of cephalopods, in spite of their many highly derived {{characters}} within the molluscan clade, including a vertebrate-like high-pressure closed circulatory system.

In this study, we present a comprehensive characterization of hemocytes in the <b>common</b> <b>cuttlefish</b> Sepia officinalis. Cytological stainings, electron microscopy- and flow cytometry-observations highlight a single granulocyte population with various densities of eosinophilic granules and unstained vesicles. These hemocytes contain acid phosphatase-, lysozyme- and proPO system enzymes, and have high activity in bead phagocytosis assays. Interestingly, bead pre-incubation in plasma results in time-dependent aggregation perhaps resulting from hemocyanin-coating, and decrease in phagocytosis.
