50|$|The mature cytokines {{themselves}} {{do not contain}} the necessary sorting sequences to enter the ER-Golgi secretory pathway, and thus are not excreted from the cell by conventional methods. However, it is theorized that the release of these proinflammatory cytokines is not reliant on <b>cellular</b> <b>rupture</b> via pyroptosis, and is in fact, an active process. There exists evidence both for and against this hypothesis. The fact that for many cell types, the cytokines are secreted despite them showing absolutely no signs of pyroptosis, supports this hypothesis. However, some experiments show that Gasdermin D nonfunctional mutants still had normal cleavage of the cytokines but lacked the ability to secrete them, indicating pyroptosis {{may in fact be}} necessary for secretion in some way.|$|E
40|$|Leakage of electrolytes, {{substances}} absorbing UV light, and enzymic {{activities from}} imbibing soybean (Glycine max [L. ] Merr.) seeds {{were compared to}} determine the extent that passive diffusion and <b>cellular</b> <b>rupture</b> contribute to each. Imbibing seeds with testae removed had average Arrhenius energies of activation (5 to 25 °C) of 3. 0 and 15. 8 kilocalories per mole, respectively, for the leakage of electrolytes and embryo malate dehydrogenase activity. Leakage of embryo enzymes from imbibing seeds was dependent on loss of testa integrity and subsequent loss of cellular membrane integrity or inability to seal preexisting membrane discontinuities. These data suggest that electrolyte leakage from imbibing seeds is primarily by passive diffusion, whereas the diffusion of intracellular macromolecules is primarily dependent on physiological phenomena affecting membrane integrity. Kinetic data and examination of the composition of seed leachates indicated that the leakage of substances absorbing UV light during imbibition is due to both passive diffusion of low molecular weight solutes and macromolecules released from ruptured cells...|$|E
5000|$|Sonoporation, or {{cellular}} sonication, {{is the use}} {{of sound}} (typically ultrasonic frequencies) for modifying the permeability of the cell plasma membrane. This technique is usually used in molecular biology and non-viral gene therapy in order to allow uptake of large molecules such as DNA into the cell, in a cell disruption process called transfection or transformation. Sonoporation employs the acoustic cavitation of microbubbles to enhance delivery of these large molecules. [...] The bioactivity of this technique is similar to, and in some cases found superior to, electroporation. Extended exposure to low-frequency (<MHz) ultrasound has been demonstrated to result in complete <b>cellular</b> death (<b>rupturing),</b> thus <b>cellular</b> [...] must also be accounted for when employing this technique.|$|R

30|$|Cryoablation is an {{ablative}} {{technique that}} causes tumour necrosis by freezing. For most types of tissues, cellular necrosis {{occurs when the}} temperature reaches - 20  °C, due to ice formation and osmosis causing protein denaturation, cell membrane rupture and cell death. Temperature[*]below[*]- 10  °C is delivered to the tissues within seconds due to rapid, high-pressure (300 bars) argon gas expansion by the Joule-Thomson effect [16]. This is achieved {{with the use of}} percutaneously inserted argon-gas cryoprobes causing controlled tissue freezing; the effect may be monitored under CT or MRI as a so-called “ice-ball”. Cryoablation sessions usually involve two cycles of 10  min freezing and 10  min thawing (achieved by the circulation of helium gas). During the last freezing phase, intracellular ice is formed leading to <b>cellular</b> membrane <b>rupture</b> and cell death [23]. In addition, there is an indirect ischaemic insult, because of microvascular occlusion occurring during the thawing phase of the cycle [24].|$|R
40|$|We {{compared}} field emergence and {{yield of}} a white- and a coloured-flowered variety of faba bean (Vicia faba) {{in relation to}} Bruchus rufimanus seed damage in a factorial, hand sown mini-plot field experiment. Further manipulating factors at sowing were, foot root rot inoculation with a 4 -species Fusarium-mixture, a seed dressing with powdered testa material of the coloured-flower variety and sowing depth. In both varieties Fusarium-inoculation was the most detrimental and significant factor to field emergence and yield, interacting with a concordant B. rufimanus effect. Expectedly, the white-flowered variety was most affected. Tannin-containing testa meal did not reduce or compensate the impact of fungal inoculation and/or B. rufimanus. We hypothesize that B. rufimanus testa damage affects seedling vigour via reported faster water imbibition, causing <b>cellular</b> <b>rupture</b> and higher solute leakage which may enhance soilborne foot root rot incidence and finally yield. The results {{are discussed in the}} context of future research objectives...|$|E
30|$|Ozone, O 3 is an {{unstable}} form of oxygen and protective layer of UV-radiation. But in drinking water, it makes an effective disinfectant (VonGunten 2003 a, b). It readily gives up oxygen {{and thus a}} powerful oxidizing agent. Ozone is made by passing oxygen through UV-light or a ‘cold’ electrical discharge. The very high oxidation potential of ozone is easy enough to insert oxygen into the bonds of organic compounds to form aldehydes and ketones. It is effective for killing the biological contaminants (viz. pathogens) than that of chemical disinfection method like chlorination. Actually, the ozone oxidizes the organics in bacterial membrane, which weakens the cell wall and leads to <b>cellular</b> <b>rupture.</b> This exposes the organism to the external environment, which causes almost immediate death of the cell. Ozone also improves the clarity (clarifying iron, sulfur and manganese). The soluble Fe(II) and Mn(II) which are not filtered in the normal condition transformed to insoluble Fe(III) and Mn(VII) with ozone treatment and, thus, filtration is possible. It also reduces odor problems and concentrations of sulfur and other dissolved chemicals. The main advantage of ozone is that it leaves no disinfectant residual in the water. To use ozone as disinfectant, it is generated and immediately applied on site. The limitations of using ozone as disinfectant are a significant air pollutant, explosive, and an irritant to skin, eyes, respiratory tract and mucous membrane. It can produce carcinogens if little bromine is there in the water.|$|E

The corneal endothelium of these eyes was studied by transmission and scanning electron microscopy. A correlation between exposure time to elevated IOP, clinical signs observed by slit-lamp examination, {{and extent of}} morphological damage is clearly shown. In eyes exposed to high pressure for 15 and 30 minutes corneas remained transparent and only minimal changes could be detected by SEM, which consisted of small areas of cell with unevenness of their surface, occasional cellular ruptures, and diminution of cilia and microvilli. After 1 [...] 2 hours of exposure small, solitary corneal opacifications appeared. In these eyes more severe morphological changes affecting larger areas were observed, with additional cellular blebbing, excariocytosis, <b>cellular</b> <b>rupture,</b> disintegration, and disappearance seen in SEM. Thin sections revealed swelling of mitochondria, disorganisation of endoplasmic reticulum, {{and the existence of}} myelin bodies. In eyes exposed for 3 and 4 hours to high IOP corneal haziness, implying stromal oedema, appeared. In these eyes the areas affected were larger, the extent of damage being more severe. Many areas were bare of endothelium, surrounded by scattered cellular debris, and showed cells with ballooning surfaces and multiple ruptures. Even in severe cellular damage cellular junctions appeared intact. It is assumed that endothelial cells are more sensitive to IOP elevation than the cellular junctions and that injury to the active pump system due to morphological damage is responsible for the resultant corneal oedema...|$|E

S. heros venom also contains toxins targeted to its prey: one toxin numbs the nervous system of insects, rendering them unable to sense or escape, while another toxin interferes with the automatic nervous system of vertebrates to make small vertebrates easier to subdue and devour. The exact effects and makeup of the venom have not been thoroughly evaluated, in part because it is difficult to extract in significant quantities and quickly deteriorates when processed.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Cocaine is a {{worldwide}} used drug and its abuse {{is associated with}} physical, psychiatric and social problems. The mechanism by which cocaine causes neurological damage is very complex and involves several neurotransmitter systems. For example, cocaine increases extracellular levels of dopamine and free radicals, and modulates several transcription factors. NF-κB is a transcription factor that regulates gene expression involved in cellular death. Our aim {{was to investigate the}} toxicity and modulation of NF-κB activity by cocaine in PC 12 cells. Treatment with cocaine (1 mM) for 24 hours induced DNA fragmentation, <b>cellular</b> membrane <b>rupture</b> and reduction of mitochondrial activity. A decrease in Bcl- 2 protein and mRNA levels, and an increase in caspase 3 activity and cleavage were also observed. In addition, cocaine (after 6 hours treatment) activated the p 50 /p 65 subunit of NF-κB complex and the pretreatment of the cells with SCH 23390, a D 1 receptor antagonist, attenuated the NF-κB activation. Inhibition of NF-κB activity by using PDTC and Sodium Salicilate increased cell death caused by cocaine. These results suggest that cocaine induces cell death (apoptosis and necrosis) and activates NF-κB in PC 12 cells. This activation occurs, at least partially, due to activation of D 1 receptors and seems to have an anti-apoptotic effect on these cells. </p...|$|R
40|$|Damage to {{the mutual}} and {{delicate}} articular relationships {{of the foot}} may lead to functional failure. A painful foot can be the heralding sign of inflammatory, metabolic or degenerative rheumatic disease that may cause severe disability if left untreated. Healthy tendons are brilliant white in colour, are fibroelastic in texture and can withstand huge mechanical loads. Pathological tendons are characterised by changes in <b>cellular</b> function, <b>rupture</b> of collagen bundles, increased production of the proteoglycan-water matrix and neurovascular proliferation. According to the underlying disease, tendinopathies may present with pain of variable duration and intensity and with functional impairment, {{or they may be}} an asymptomatic finding on imaging techniques. Pain is the most common presenting symptom in the inflammatory rheumatic diseases of the ankle and the foot and usually precedes ultrasound or radiographic changes; pain results from inflammatory changes of the synovia and soft tissue structures including bursae, tendons, fascias and peripheral nerves. The management of tendinopathies in inflammatory and non-inflammatory rheumatic patients includes "articular economy," pharmacological treatment, foot orthotics, cryotherapy, instrumental physiotherapy, rehabilitation and physical. This review highlights the differences between tendinopathies occurring in non-inflammatory rheumatic disorders compared to those appearing in the course of inflammatory rheumatic disorders and defines a conservative management framework that non-rheumatologists (orthopaedic surgeons) and rheumatologists could adhere for the management of foot tendinopathies...|$|R
40|$|Cotyledonal- or transverse-cracking (TVC) {{in certain}} cultivars of snapbeans, Phaseolus vulgaris ~. seeds, clearly evident during germination, seriously places {{affected}} seedlings {{at a competitive}} disadvantage. TVC is an inherited trait and occurs across cell walls of cotyledons rather than along cell walls. Thus, it might be hypothesized that internal pressure resulting from swelling of storage proteins during imbibition might account for <b>cellular</b> <b>rupture.</b> To further elucidate this possibility, experiments were designed to compare electrophoretic patterns of storage proteins from seeds of snapbeans resistant and susceptible to TVC, and to correlate the different patterns of polyacrylamide gel el ectrophoretograrns of these proteins to TVC. One hundred seeds were selected randomly from a bulk sample of 225 g from each of 17 seed lots representing 15 cultivars, seed coats removed and cotyledons finely ground (60 mesh). Seed flours were defatted twi ce with hexane (50 ml / g) at 4 °C and defatted flours reground with a mortar and pestle. Seed proteins were extracted in 0. 5 M NaCl (solvent to four ratio of 10 : 1) at pH 7. 5 for 1 h at 4 oc with centrifugation at 10, 000 g for 30 min. Separated proteins were subjected to electrophoresis under denaturing and non-denaturing conditions and molecular weight of different protein brands determined. Different protein banding patterns were identified and correlated to the TVC phenomenon. The data showed visual differences between banding patterns of resistant and susceptible cultivars. While the electrophoretic technique shows observable differences in cultivars expressing differential TVC, {{it is not clear}} which protein bands are associated with the TVC phenomenon.

40|$|Studies {{with the}} seeds of soybean, navy bean, pea, and peanut were made to {{determine}} the extent of leakage of intracellular enzymes during imbition. Embryos with intact testae from all four species were found to leak detectable activities of either intracellular enzymes of the cytosol (glucose- 6 -phosphate dehydrogenase) or enzymes found in both the cytosol and organelles (malate dehydrogenase, glutamate dehydrogenase, glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase, and NADP-isocitrate dehydrogenase) after 6 hours imbition at 25 C. Pea and peanut embryos with testae leaked considerably lower levels of activity for these enzymes than did those of soybean and bean. Leakage of mitochondrial marker enzymes (fumarase, cytochrome c oxidase, and adenylate kinase) was not detected from embryos with testae, suggesting that a differential diffusion of intracellular components out of cells occurred. Soybean and bean embryos without testae leaked high, and proportionally (per cent dry seed basis) similar, levels of all cytosol, cytosol-organelle, and mitochondrial marker enzymes and protein during imbibition, indicating that cell membranes were not differential to leakage and that they had ruptured. Pea and peanut embryos without testae leaked detectable activities of all cytosol and cytosol-organelle enzymes, although fumarase was the only detectable mitochondrial marker enzyme leaked, suggesting that some degree of differential leakage may have occurred in these species. The outermost layers of embryo cells of seeds without testae of all four species absorbed and sequestered the nonpermeating pigment Evan's blue after 5 to 15 minutes imbibition, indicating that membranes had ruptured. This occurred to a much lesser extent in seeds with intact testae. Both soybean and bean embryos without testae were observed to disintegrate during imbibition, whereas those of pea and peanut did not. These data indicate that seeds of certain legumes are susceptible to <b>cellular</b> <b>rupture</b> during imbibition when seed coats are damaged or missing...|$|E

40|$|SummaryThe biogenesis and {{dynamics}} of cellular membranes {{are governed by}} fusion and fission processes that ensure the maintenance of closed compartments. These principles also apply to viruses during acquisition of their envelope. Based on conventional electron microscopy (EM), however, it has been proposed that poxviruses assemble from membranes made de novo with “free” ends in the cytoplasm. Here, we analyze the origin and structure of poxvirus membranes in a close-to-native state and in three dimensions by using cryopreservation and electron tomography (ET). By cryo-EM, the precursor membrane of poxviruses appears as an open membrane sheet stabilized by a protein scaffold. ET shows that this membrane is derived from pre-existing <b>cellular</b> membranes that <b>rupture</b> to generate an open compartment, rather than being made de novo. Thus, poxvirus infection represents an excellent system to study how cytoplasmic membranes can form open sheets by a process distinct from well-defined mechanisms of membrane biogenesis...|$|R
40|$|It is {{estimated}} that 5. 9 % of all human deaths are attributable to alcohol consumption and that the harmful use of ethanol ranks {{among the top five}} risk factors for causing disease, disability, and death worldwide. Ethanol is known to disrupt phospholipid packing and promote membrane hemifusion at lipid bilayers. With the exception of mitochondria involved in hormone synthesis, the sterol content of mitochondrial membranes is low. As membranes that are low in cholesterol have increased membrane fluidity and are the most easily disordered by ethanol, we hypothesize that mitochondria are sensitive targets for ethanol damage. HeLa cells were exposed to 50 mM ethanol and the direct effects of ethanol on cellular ultrastructure were examined utilizing transmission electron microscopy. Our ultramicroscopic analysis revealed that cells exposed to ethanol harbor fewer incidence of apoptotic morphology; however, significant alterations to mitochondria and to nuclei occurred. We observed statistical increases in the amount of irregular cells and cells with multiple nuclei, nuclei harboring indentations, and nuclei with multiple nucleolus-like bodies. Indeed, our analysis revealed that mitochondrial damage is the most extensive type of <b>cellular</b> damage. <b>Rupturing</b> of cristae was the most prominent damage followed by mitochondrial swelling. Ethanol exposure also resulted in increased amounts of mitochondrial rupturing, organelles with linked membranes, and mitochondria localizing to indentations of nuclear membranes. We theorize that these alterations could contribute to cellular defects in oxidative phosphorylation and, by extension, the inability to generate regular levels of cellular adenosine triphosphate...|$|R
30|$|Nobuchi and Harada [19] {{reported}} finding large vacuoles in {{the inner}} intermediate wood (white zone) of C. japonica by transmission electron microscopy. They suggested that these large vacuoles might be involved in autophagy [19]. In the present study, we identified the timing of rupture of these large vacuoles. In the inner part of the intermediate wood, some non-PSVs had clearly enlarged and others were ruptured (Figs.  5 d, e, 6 d). In the same region, all the ray parenchyma cells contained elliptical nuclei (Figs.  5 d, 6 d). In the middle region of the outermost part of the heartwood, all the vacuoles had been ruptured and ray parenchyma cells contained condensed nuclei (Figs.  5 f, 6 e). In the inner region of the outermost heartwood, only osmiophilic aggregates and some lipid-like oily droplets were observed (Figs.  5 g, 6 f). These observations suggest that dramatic changes associated with autolysis might start after the rupture of enlarged vacuoles. In tracheary elements, the autolysis of <b>cellular</b> contents follows <b>rupture</b> of a central vacuole [14 – 16]. Similarly, enlarged non-PSVs might {{play a critical role}} in the completion of autolysis of the contents of ray parenchyma cells {{in the inner}} part of the intermediate wood.|$|R

The mechanisms of spread and cell death are unknown, however, evidence from previous studies suggests that neurons may undergo apoptosis due to the uptake of exogenous α-syn aggregate through the endocytic pathway and subsequent lysosomal rupture. This study aimed to corroborate previous evidence of α-syn induced lysosomal rupture and investigate the <b>cellular</b> repercussions of <b>rupture</b> with respect to cell death and α-syn transfer. We hypothesized that α-syn aggregates can compromise the function of lysosomes, leading to the release of lysosomal contents. To test this, we immunofluorescently labeled an abundant lysosomal protease, cathepsin B, and analyzed the level of dispersion upon treatment with α-syn aggregates. Further, we hypothesized that ruptured lysosomes cannot reseal after α-syn induced rupture. We tested this hypothesis using a triple colocalization analysis between lysosomal markers, labeled α-syn aggregates, and labeled rupture events. Last, we hypothesized that calcium-dependent lysosomal exocytosis may explain the release of α-syn. This mechanism of α-syn release was studied by inducing calcium influx while imaging labeled lysosomes and their contents through TIRF-M...|$|R

Non-ciliated ED epithelium cells presented several atypically large lysosomes. Plicae loss and basal vacuoles were observed in the epithelium of dilated regions. Cellular cilia loss and apical cytoplasmic membrane rupture resulted in leakage of the cytoplasmic contents to the ED lumen, and ED epithelium desquamation occurred with or without lesion to the basal membrane. Basal membrane alterations were associated with profound sub-epithelial connective tissue damage. Aggregations of desquamated epithelium and spermatozoa were seen in the lumen of ED and compact aggregates were considered the basis for calculi formation.

Ribonuclease, in a high concentration, decreased the immunogenic activity slightly. Addition of yeast ribonucleic acid to particulate fraction incubated at 37 C prevented the decrease in immunogenic activity which normally occurs at this temperature, suggesting that endogenous ribonuclease may be involved in the reduction of activity. Differential centrifugation by the use of Brodie's (1962) method showed that the particles which sedimented at 56, 550 × g were immunogenically active. Experiments were done to determine whether the integrity {{of the structure of the}} particle was necessary for immunogenic activity. It was found that sonic oscillation, freezing and thawing several times, the addition of surface-active agents (sodium lauryl sulfate or deoxycholate), and preparation of the particulate fraction in hypotonic solutions either decreased or destroyed immunogenic activity. This strengthens the evidence that a structural unit is necessary for activity. In addition, both a waxy sediment and the smallest particles which sedimented only at 144, 000 × g were highly immunogenic if incorporated into Freund's incomplete adjuvant.

40|$|Many foods, {{particularly}} fish, {{change in}} texture and become tough on frozen storage. In addition to ice crystal formation that causes protein denaturation, lipid oxidation products including aldehydes may induce protein cross-linking. In this study, Atlantic Mackerel was stored {{for up to}} 26 weeks at - 80 and - 10 °C. The formation of aldehydes was investigated by thiobarbituric (TEARS) test, HPLC and LC-MS. As expected, {{there was an increase}} in the production of aldehydes during storage at - 10 °C compared with the control fillets at - 80 °C. However, in addition to malonaldehyde (MDA) and hexanal (HEX), we report the formation of gluteraldehyde (GLA) and hydroxynonenal (4 -HNE) in frozen fish for the first time. Frozen storage also decreased protein solubility, induced changes in protein conformation and increased formaldehyde and DMA formation. Changes in texture during storage, assessed by small deformation rheology showed increased elastic modulus (G') values. Aldehyde formation in fish and consequently the G' values were reduced in samples that were treated with antioxidant (green tea). A model study using BSA with various aldehydes showed a decrease in lysine availability, increased G' values and conformational changes including increased beta-sheet and tyrosine doublet ratio and decreased tryptophan and disulphide groups. Increased MW of BSA-aldehyde adducts as well as fragmentations were observed by LC-MS. Methyl linoleate (ML) and extracted mackerel oil were oxidised under ultraviolet (UV) radiation for 24, 48 and 72 hours and lipid peroxidation was assessed by measuring peroxide value (PV) and TEARS. To assess the cytotoxicity, oxidized lipids (0, 20, 40, 80 and 100 mug/ml) (ML or fish oil) were added to human colon cancer (Caco- 2) cells (density 2 x 104 cells/well) and incubated for 24 h.

40|$|Miyazaki {{discovered}} a new species of Paragonimus ohirai Miyazaki in 1939. He {{made it clear that}} P. westermanii (Kerbert, 1879) was not only lung-fluke to be found iti Japan, contaray to the then accepted theory. In 1945 he found a morphologically different metacercaria from that of P. ohirai. He succeeded in obtaining an adult worm of that metacercaria following an artificial infection in a test animal. Since he could not morphologically differentiate the adult worm thus obtained from that of P. ohirai he tentatively named it as "Small type of P. ohirai". He made a comparative study on the worm with those specimens sent by Chen. Their opinions wereexchanged, resulting in a conclusion that the worm in question was nothing but P. iloktsuenensis Chen, 1940. Miyazaki's studies have proved that there are 3 species, i. e. P. westermanii, P. ohirai, and P. iloktsuenensis, in Japan. Thus in Japan the identification of lung-fluke in men, domestic animals, and in wild animals has become a matter of great consideration. Recently at Osaka-City Slaughter House the authors had an occasion to examine an immature adult of lung-fluke in hog lung as well as liver, in an effort to give a careful identification of the species. Formerly the researchers found it very difficult to differentiate species of lung-fluke by their adult worms. From various metacercariae Miyazaki has experimentally obtained respective adult worms, and made a comparative study which has enabled him to give an easy differentiation among some species. Bifurcation of the ovary, growth of cuticular spines, the rate in size of ovary and testis, and the characteristics of egg have been minutely scrutinized. Especially the former two characters have been greatly stressed upon. After Miyazaki's classification the authors' study has revealed that the present specimens are identified as P. westermanii. So far many histopathological reports have been made on worm cysts of lung-flukes in men, dogs, and cats (in most cases done with experimental animals) in Japan with some detailed findings. But swine cases do not seem to have been histologically reported in detail except for macroscopical study of Kawamura (1917), Tokishige (1918), and Oishi and Saito (1952). The authors studied the present challenging case with a careful histological survey of the infected viscera. The results obtained are as follows: (1) After Miyazaki's classification, the lung-fluke found in about one year old hog (Osaka-City Slaughter House raised in the Kyushu district) has revealed to be P. westermanii. (2) A single worm is found in the cavity of worm cyst in lung and liver. (3) The worms obtained from lung and liver have grown to Ando's "immature adult or third stage". No formation of vitellarium is observed. (4) So far as the present case indicates, P. westermami has a hepatotropic characteristic. (5) The worm cyst in the lung locates in the parenchyma subpleurally. It is nodulously elevated and is round shaped with its cut surface almost round. The worm cyst in the liver locates subcapsularly. It is elevated button-like on the surface, and is in shape of ellipse with its cut section elliptic. (6) The worm cyst in the lung forms a cavity of softening cyst. It shows no signs of bronchiectasis (fig. 4). (7) The wall of worm cyst is composed of granulation tissues where marked cell infiltration is demonstrated by predominant eosinophils. This finding corresponds to Kobori's "granulation period". But the tissues on the wall do not necessarilly show a common finding {{with the rest of the}} tissues. A finding of "infiltration period" or "organization period" is observed in some areas (fig. 7, 8, 9). (8) The worm cysts of lung and liver show an appearance of epitheloid cells on their innermost layers. (9) Main changes found in the pulmonary tissues around the cyst worm are catarrhal pneumonia, hemorrhagic pneumonia, fibrinous pneumonia, productive pneumonia, bronchitis, peribronchitis, bronchiectasis, rupture of bronchial wall, hemangiectasis, aneurysm, varix, perivascular <b>cellular</b> infiltration, <b>rupture</b> of blood vessel, hamorrhagic remains, scarred nodule, localized induration, and villous pleurisy. (10) In the stroma adjacent to the pleural lesion and worm cyst, a scarred nodule is odserved which supports to consider that the worm invaded pleura, stroma, and then parenchyma in order. (11) No mast-cells are detected in the present inflammatory lesions. (12) On the scarred nodule there appear "large mononuclear orange-granulocytes" (tentatively named) bearing orange color granules (fig. 12). A small group of "large mononuclear eosinophils" (presumably eosinophilic myelocytes) is found in the cirrhotic lesion around the nodule and in the proliferated interstitial connective tissues of the liver, with marked round cell infiltration (fig. 13). (13) The pulmonary lesion demonstrates a small focal infiltration of mononuclear eosinophils as well as of typical eosinophils. (14) Proliferation or regeneration of fine smooth muscle fibers is observed in groups in the wall and surrounding tissues of the worm cyst as well as in the surrounding tissues of the scarred nodule (fig. 10). (15) Fine Charcot-Leyden crystals are demonstrated in the worm cavity of lung where fine eosinophils are collected. They are especially found in a group of degenerated or necrotic eosinophils (fig. 6). (16) Hilar lymphnode findings are focal infiltration of neutrophils in cell-poor substance (small abscess formation), diffuse eosinophils infiltration, and localized atrophy of lymphoid tissues where the cell-poor substance is found proliferated. These findings are closely related with pulmonary changes (fig. 5) ...|$|R
