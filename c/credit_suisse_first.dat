5|$|The {{arrival of}} former Drexel Burnham Lambert {{investment}} banker Ken Moelis marked a major coup for Costas. Moelis joined UBS from Donaldson Lufkin & Jenrette in 2001 shortly after its acquisition by <b>Credit</b> <b>Suisse</b> <b>First</b> Boston (although Huw Jenkins {{claimed he had}} hired Moelis to the UK Parliamentary Banking commission while under oath, which is patently false). In his six years at UBS, Moelis ultimately {{assumed the role of}} president of UBS Investment Bank and was credited, along with Costas, with the build-out of UBS's investment banking operation in the United States. Within weeks of joining, Moelis brought over a team of 70 bankers from Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette. Costas and Moelis hired more than 30 senior U.S. bankers from 2001 through 2004.|$|E

Costas, {{a former}} bond trader and co-head of Fixed income at <b>Credit</b> <b>Suisse</b> <b>First</b> Boston {{and head of}} Fixed Income Trading at Union Bank of Switzerland in 1998, was {{appointed}} CEO of UBS's investment banking division, which originated in SBC's Warburg Dillon Read division and was renamed UBS Warburg in December 2001. In an attempt {{to break into the}} elite bulge bracket of investment banks, in which UBS then had little success while rival Credit Suisse was establishing itself as a major player on Wall Street with the acquisition of Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette in 2000, Costas shifted the growth strategy from acquiring entire firms to hiring individual investment bankers or teams of bankers from rival firms. Costas had followed a similar approach in building out the UBS fixed income business, hiring over 500 sales and trading personnel and increasing revenues from US$300million in 1998 to over US$3billion by 2001.|$|E

[...] However, its strategy is consistent with that of other large, international financial conglomerates.

Gibbons had also borrowed $475 million in junk bonds. When the junk bonds market crashed the following year, Gibbons couldn't repay First Boston. Credit Suisse injected $725 million to keep First Boston in business, which ultimately led to the company being taken over by Credit Suisse.
