40|$|This study {{identifies}} {{the determinants of}} coupon values at the brand level {{within the context of}} a complex marketing program. A two-equation, fixed-effects, panel-data model accounts for the bidirectional causality between brand prices and discount levels. The empirical model is fitted with data on household purchases of ready-to-eat (RTE) breakfast cereals and captures the industry's 1996 price cuts and discount reductions. Higher brand prices cause coupon values to rise, supporting the price discrimination hypothesis. Coupon values fall with in-store displays and more intense advertising but rise when <b>couponed</b> products are featured in store flyers. Discount levels are positively related to brand market share and the size of discounts redeemed for rival cereals. Coupon values fall with increasing brand loyalty among RTE cereal purchasers. Cereal prices are positively affected by coupon values, advertising expenditures, input costs, and the prices of competing brands. Inventory levels are negatively correlated with brand price.

40|$|In Raju, Dhar, and Morrison (1994), a {{paper that}} {{appeared}} {{earlier in this}} journal, we developed an analytical model and conducted empirical analyses to {{examine the effect of}} package coupons on market share. In this epilogue, we extend the analytical framework in our earlier paper to study the relative impact of package coupons on profits. We also report findings from five quasi-experiments (including two new quasi-experiments) that provide empirical validity to our model-based predictions. Our results have significance for brand managers in packaged goods firms. Our analysis suggest that while selecting among package coupons, brand managers should carefully define which performance criterion to use: market share impact, redemption rate, or profit impact. Package coupons that lead to the highest market share impact (or redemptions) may not lead to the highest profit impact. We compare the relative profit impact of the following package coupons: peel-off, on-pack, and in-pack. coupons must be redeemed on the same purchase occasion on which they are obtained. coupons are obtained at one purchase occasion but can only be redeemed for a discount on the <b>couponed</b> brand at a future purchase occasion. coupons are similar to on-pack coupons except that the consumer is aware of the presence of these coupons when the product is purchased (in-pack coupons are printed or placed inside the package). Consumers with an in-pack or on-pack coupon from a previous purchase occasion will have a higher probability of purchasing the <b>couponed</b> brand even if the brand was not currently offering coupons. Consequently, to understand choice behavior, {{it is not enough to}} take into consideration the current choice environment; our model therefore must also keep track of whether or not a consumer has a package coupon that was obtained on an earlier purchase occasion. In other words, since choice is dependent on the purchase environment as well as the state of the consumer, we use a Markov model to represent the choice process. Analytical results are derived based on the long run probabilities of the Markov transition matrix. Our analytical and empirical results suggest that by and large, of the various package coupons examined in our research, on-pack coupons lead to the highest impact on profits. Furthermore, while peel-offs lead to a higher market share than in-packs, because in-packs stimulate repurchase among previous buyers, they lead to higher profits than peel-offs; though only for stronger brands. sales promotions, coupons, stochastic models, brand choice...|$|R

50|$|Coupons are a {{relatively}} new concept in India.

50|$|The second {{limitation}} of marketing mix models {{comes into play}} when advertisers attempt to use these models {{to determine the best}} media allocation across different media types. The traditional use of MMM's to compare money spent on TV versus money spent on <b>couponing</b> was relatively valid in that both TV commercials and the appearance of coupons (for example, in a FSI run in a newspaper) were both quite time specific.

Though many retail media channels are found inside the retailer's store/environment, the media channels themselves are not always 'owned' or operated by retailers.

5000|$|LeBow's {{actions were}} pivotal to the {{government}} in their signing of the Master Settlement Agreement. In addition to this, LeBow was honored with a proclamation by Florida Governor Lawton Chiles for his [...] "invaluable assistance" [...] in helping Florida achieve its historic $11.3 billion settlement with the tobacco industry. Following this presentation, Lebow and Mr. Chiles addressed a group of students, who [...] "saved their toughest questions for Liggett Group chief Bennett Lebow of Miami". One student asked, [...] "If {{you want to be}} a watchdog of the industry, why not get out altogether and stop making cigarettes?" [...] to which he responded that if he did, others would continue. LeBow also developed, through Vector Tobacco Inc., the nicotine-free cigarette Quest (cigarette) which is a cigarette designed to help people quit smoking. Also that year LeBow teamed up with corporate raider Carl Icahn to make a bid for RJR Nabisco. In response to this proposed spin-off of Nabisco from RJR Reynolds, tobacco industry analyst Ellen Barabas stated that [...] "I think there are people who would support a spin-off of Nabisco, but not by Lebow. One of the prime factors was Lebows dubious reputation as a manager. In 1994 his shareholders sued him, claiming he had taken millions of dollars in improper loans; Lebow settled out of court." [...] According to court documents, Liggett, while under LeBow's leadership, [...] "engage(d) in marketing tactics that appeal to youths, such as <b>couponing,</b> sampling, and “buy one get one free” offers for its cigarettes, and advertise(d) in magazines with substantial youth readership." ...|$|E
50|$|QR codes {{have become}} common in {{consumer}} advertising. Typically, a smartphone {{is used as}} a QR code scanner, displaying the code and converting it to some useful form (such as a standard URL for a website, thereby obviating the need for a user to type it into a web browser).QR code has become a focus of advertising strategy, since it provides a way to access a brand's website more quickly than by manually entering a URL. Beyond mere convenience to the consumer, the importance of this capability is that it increases the conversion rate (the chance that contact with the advertisement will convert to a sale), by coaxing interested prospects further down the conversion funnel with little delay or effort, bringing the viewer to the advertiser's website immediately, where a longer and more targeted sales pitch may lose the viewer's interest.Although initially used to track parts in vehicle manufacturing, QR codes are used over a much wider range of applications, including commercial tracking, entertainment and transport ticketing, product and loyalty marketing (examples: mobile <b>couponing</b> where a company's discounted and percent discount can be captured using a QR code decoder which is a mobile app, or storing a company's information such as address and related information alongside its alpha-numeric text data {{as can be seen in}} Yellow Pages directory), and in-store product labeling. It can also be used in storing personal information for use by organizations. An example of this is Philippines National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) where NBI clearances now come with a QR code. Many of these applications target mobile-phone users (via mobile tagging). Users may receive text, add a vCard contact to their device, open a URI, or compose an e-mail or text message after scanning QR codes. They can generate and print their own QR codes for others to scan and use by visiting one of several pay or free QR code-generating sites or apps. Google had an API, now deprecated, to generate QR codes, and apps for scanning QR codes can be found on nearly all smartphone devices.QR codes storing addresses and URLs may appear in magazines, on signs, on buses, on business cards, or on almost any object about which users might want information. Users with a camera phone equipped with the correct reader application can scan the image of the QR code to display text, contact information, connect to a wireless network, or open a web page in the telephone's browser. This act of linking from physical world objects is termed hardlinking or object hyperlinking. QR codes also may be linked to a location to track where a code has been scanned. Either the application that scans the QR code retrieves the geo information by using GPS and cell tower triangulation (aGPS) or the URL encoded in the QR code itself is associated with a location.|$|E
