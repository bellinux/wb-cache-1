25|$|<b>Cooling</b> <b>air</b> is airflow that is {{injected}} through small {{holes in the}} liner to generate a layer (film) of <b>cool</b> <b>air</b> to protect the liner from the combustion temperatures. The implementation of <b>cooling</b> <b>air</b> has to be carefully designed so it does not directly interact with the combustion air and process. In some cases, as much as 50% of the inlet air is used as <b>cooling</b> <b>air.</b> There are several different methods of injecting this <b>cooling</b> <b>air,</b> and the method can influence the temperature profile that the liner is exposed to (see Liner, above).|$|R

40|$|High {{pressure}} {{turbine nozzle}} guide vane of a gas turbine engine, which operates at gas temperatures in excess of 1700 K, employs various cooling techniques to keep the vane within safe operating limits. Even though {{nozzle guide vane}}s are designed using heat transfer co-relations available in published papers and fundamental data, it is required to test the nozzle guide vane to ascertain the surface metal temperature and verify the adequacy of cooling. Adequacy of cooling is quantified by the term cooling effectiveness expressed and as percentage. Cooling effectiveness {{is a function of}} gas temperature, <b>cooling</b> <b>air</b> temperature and surface metal temperature. The objective of the current work was to study the effect of <b>cooling</b> <b>air</b> temperature on <b>cooling</b> effectiveness. Tests were conducted on a high pressure turbine nozzle guide vane. Gas pressure, gas temperature, <b>cooling</b> <b>air</b> pressure was kept constant and the <b>cooling</b> <b>air</b> temperature was varied as a ratio of gas temperature to <b>cooling</b> <b>air</b> temperature and its effect on metal temperature studied. It was seen that, over the range of <b>cooling</b> <b>air</b> temperature tested, <b>cooling</b> effectiveness remained sensibly constant.

25|$|The liner {{contains}} the combustion process and introduces the various airflows (intermediate, dilution, and <b>cooling,</b> see <b>Air</b> flow paths below) into the combustion zone. The liner must be {{designed and built}} to withstand extended high temperature cycles. For that reason liners tend to be made from superalloys like Hastelloy X. Furthermore, even though high performance alloys are used, the liners must be <b>cooled</b> with <b>air</b> flow. Some combustors also make use of thermal barrier coatings. However, <b>air</b> <b>cooling</b> is still required. In general, {{there are two main}} types of liner cooling; film cooling and transpiration cooling. Film cooling works by injecting (by one of several methods) <b>cool</b> <b>air</b> from outside of the liner to just inside of the liner. This creates a thin film of <b>cool</b> <b>air</b> that protects the liner, reducing the temperature at the liner from around 1800 kelvins (K) to around 830 K, for example. The other type of liner cooling, transpiration cooling, is a more modern approach that uses a porous material for the liner. The porous liner allows a small amount of <b>cooling</b> <b>air</b> to pass through it, providing cooling benefits similar to film cooling. The two primary differences are in the resulting temperature profile of the liner and the amount of <b>cooling</b> <b>air</b> required. Transpiration <b>cooling</b> results in a much more even temperature profile, as the <b>cooling</b> <b>air</b> is uniformly introduced through pores. Film <b>cooling</b> <b>air</b> is generally introduced through slats or louvers, resulting in an uneven profile where it is cooler at the slat and warmer between the slats. More importantly, transpiration cooling uses much less <b>cooling</b> <b>air</b> (on the order of 10% of total airflow, rather than 20-50% for film <b>cooling).</b> Using less <b>air</b> for <b>cooling</b> allows more to be used for combustion, which is more and more important for high performance, high thrust engines.|$|R

A first port injects a supply of <b>cool</b> <b>air</b> into the channels. A second port allows the supply of <b>cool</b> <b>air</b> to exit the channels and flow to a combustor. A third port injects a supply of hot gas from the combustor into the channels. A fourth port allows the supply of hot gas to exit the channels and flow to a turbine.

The diverting port diverts a portion of the <b>cool</b> <b>air</b> exiting through the second port as reinjection air. The diverting port is fluidly connected to the reinjection port which reinjects the reinjection air back into the channels. The reinjection air evacuates the channels of the hot gas resident therein and cools the channel walls, a pair of end walls of the rotor, ducts communicating with the rotor and subsequent downstream components. In a second embodiment, the second port receives all of the <b>cool</b> <b>air</b> exiting the channels and the diverting port diverts a portion of the <b>cool</b> <b>air</b> just prior to the <b>cool</b> <b>air</b> flowing to the combustor...|$|R

40|$|To reduce {{carbon dioxide}} (CO 2) {{emissions}} of road going vehicles, the aerodynamic drag {{is an important}} area to focus on. Reducing aerodynamic drag will lead to reduced fuel consumption and hence decreased CO 2 emissions. A significant element of the aerodynamic drag of a modern passenger car is the cooling drag, which can constitute up to 15 %. Possible solutions to reduce the cooling drag include closing off parts of the <b>cooling</b> <b>air</b> inlets when {{only a small amount}} of <b>cooling</b> <b>air</b> flow is needed. The focus of this study is on the aerodynamic effects closing off the <b>cooling</b> <b>air</b> inlets have on a modern passenger car.

50|$|An {{evaporative}} cooler (also swamp cooler, desert <b>cooler</b> and wet <b>air</b> <b>cooler)</b> is {{a device that}} <b>cools</b> <b>air</b> through the evaporation of water. Evaporative cooling differs from typical air conditioning systems, which use vapor-compression or absorption refrigeration cycles. Evaporative cooling works by exploiting water's large enthalpy of vaporization. The temperature of dry air can be dropped significantly through the phase transition of liquid water to water vapor (evaporation). This can <b>cool</b> <b>air</b> using much less energy than refrigeration. In extremely dry climates, evaporative <b>cooling</b> of <b>air</b> has {{the added benefit of}} conditioning the air with more moisture for the comfort of building occupants.|$|R

Product and <b>cooling</b> <b>air</b> pass through the cooler in counterflow. The product to be cooled falls directly into the product feed housing.

50|$|The term is {{also used}} to refer to “Cool Power” air intake systems for {{turbocharged}} engines.

Lastly, cool power systems will supports larger turbochargers by creating additional air flow to the engine.|$|R

40|$|Passenger cars {{represent}} the largest {{part of all}} means of personal transportation today. Thus, {{it is important to}} work towards reduced energy consumption of cars if a sustainable mobility is to be achieved. This involves many aspects of vehicle engineering; one of them being aerodynamics. This study focuses on aerodynamic drag and the contributions from the wheels at different <b>cooling</b> <b>air</b> flow configurations. Wheels and wheel housings are important for the overall aerodynamic drag on passenger cars. It has been shown that as much as 25 % of the aerodynamic drag originates from these components. Therefore, it is desirable to understand the flow structures related to the wheels and wheel housings, and how they interact with other important flow regions. This paper presents an investigation of the effects of wheel designs on aerodynamic drag at different <b>cooling</b> <b>air</b> flow configurations on a sedan type passenger car. Comparisons between numerical simulations and wind tunnel measurements are made for some of the configurations as well. Several additional wheel configurations were investigated numerically to further investigate the flow structures at the front and rear wheels. The numerical results show that the effects of radial wheel covering varied noticeably with <b>cooling</b> <b>air</b> flow configuration. In two of the configurations this resulted in a net drag increase with closed <b>cooling</b> <b>air</b> inlets. The best configuration with closed <b>cooling</b> <b>air</b> inlets generated an overall drag reduction of 29 drag counts compared with the numerical baseline with open <b>cooling</b> <b>air</b> inlets. In addition to the obvious drag reduction of closing the <b>cooling</b> <b>air</b> inlets, the main reasons for the additional decrease was limiting the drag increase at the front stagnation region and positive interference effects along the underbody and vehicle base...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{presents}} the numerical {{study of the}} turbulent swirling flow in a combustor {{and the effect of}} <b>cooling</b> <b>air,</b> which has practical applications in industrial furnaces and jet engines. <b>Cooling</b> <b>air</b> is used to protect the combustor wall from burnout, while allowing the combustion to occur at higher temperature. The governing differential equations using k – ε turbulence model closure are solved by a control-volume based iterative finite difference technique. Computations are done for constant vane angle type swirl generation at inlet. Different swirl numbers up to 1. 5 are considered. To study the effect of <b>cooling</b> <b>air</b> on the combustor performance, calculations are repeated for two different velocities of the <b>cooling</b> <b>air</b> jet. The predicted distribution of the mean axial and tangential velocities, turbulence kinetic energy and streamline plots are discussed in the article. With the increase of swirl strength, secondary on-axis recirculation due to swirl is observed. The swirl produces larger turbulence kinetic energy and enhances mixing rate, thus require shorter combustor length. The interaction between the non-swirling <b>cooling</b> <b>air</b> and swirling core flow also increases the generation of turbulence kinetic energy and mixing rate. The capability of the computational model for predicting recirculating flows is tested by comparing the results with available experimental data and found to have reasonable matching...|$|R
