5000|$|Transportation {{has shaped}} Millbrae's growth. From {{the start of}} the 20th century, the #40 [...] "interurban" [...] {{streetcar}} traveled through Millbrae, linking the city with San Francisco and San Mateo. Millbrae's high school children rode the streetcar to attend Burlingame High School until Capuchino High School opened on September 11, 1950. The streetcar line was dismantled just after Millbrae's incorporation, leaving the Southern Pacific Railroad as the only railway linking Millbrae with surrounding areas. The Sixteen Mile House marked Millbrae along the railroad route, located where Millbrae's first <b>Corner</b> <b>Frame</b> Shop stands today. In the 1940s, as long-time residents vividly recall, a hilltop literally was shaved away to produce landfill for expanding San Francisco Airport, which received an [...] "international" [...] designation in 1954 with the completion of the Central Terminal.|$|E

40|$|The {{subject of}} this paper was a {{research}} of physical and mechanical properties of LVL composed of peeled poplar veneers in core layers and only outer layers of beech peeled veneers, so as the examination of window frame glue joint strength produced of this material. LVL boards have been hot pressed in industrial conditions, using appropriate phenol formaldehyde (PP) adhesive. Samples for <b>corner</b> window <b>frame</b> glue joint strength testing were glued with PVAc D 4 class adhesive. Statistical analysis showed that there were significant differences both in moisture content and density of LVL boards regarding their thickness, while in the case of hardness this difference did not exist. Examinations of LVL glue line shear strength showed that both phenol formaldehyde (PP) and PVAc D 4 class adhesives fulfilled standard requirements. The results of <b>corner</b> window <b>frame</b> double tenon glue joint strength produced from combined poplar-beech veneer LVL indicated that such material could be used to produce window <b>frame</b> <b>corner</b> joint, strong enough to withstand the additional load, without an increase of the cross section...|$|R

50|$|The barrel-vaulted nave {{is broken}} by a cupola, and totally covered in azulejo tile, except for the <b>corners,</b> <b>frames</b> and frames of the windows. These azulejos show scenes {{from the life of}} São Lawrence and in each arch, {{accompanied}} by his legend in Latin. Lawrence of Rome was martyred in Rome in 258, for challenging Emperor Decius who expected tribute from the church, to which he was deacon. Lawrence distributed the gold to the poor instead, and little reached the Emperor's coffers. Furious, the Emperor ordered the cleric be whipped with rods, then his back seared with burning hot iron, before being extended over a mound of embers (to die). The tiles depict: the saint healing two blind men; the saint giving money to the poor; the saint talking with Pope Sixtus II; the saint arguing for his Christian belief with Roman Emperor Valerian; and the saint's martyrdom.|$|R

40|$|Reinforced {{concrete}} <b>frame</b> <b>corners</b> {{were analyzed}} using the nonlinear finite-element method and fracture mechanics. The objective {{of the study was}} to determine whether the reinforcement detailing in frame bridges could be simplified, with preserved structural safety, by splicing the reinforcement within the <b>frame</b> <b>corner.</b> A constitutive model for concrete, based on nonlinear fracture mechanics and plasticity, was used. An interface model was used to account for slip between the reinforcement and surrounding concrete. Analysis of previously tested frame specimens, with both spliced and unspliced corner reinforcement, was used to study the overall behavior of the frames; more detailed analysis of only the <b>frame</b> <b>corner</b> regions was used to study the influence of the reinforcement splices. The analyses were found to reflect the mechanical behavior of the specimens, and are in good agreement with the test results. The analysis results support, together with the test results, the idea that it would be feasible to splice all reinforcement in a portal frame bridge within the corner regions...|$|R

30|$|This paper {{presents}} {{research on}} plywood <b>frame</b> <b>corners</b> jointed to glulam beams and columns {{by means of}} glued-in hardwood dowels. The <b>frame</b> <b>corner</b> was made of a solid block of ordinary plywood of the same width as the glulam beams and with plies parallel to {{the plane of the}} frame to avoid splitting due to stress perpendicular to the grain. Hardwood dowels with a diameter of 12 mm and a maximum glued-in length of 120 mm were glued into drilled holes in the plywood corner and glulam beam ends parallel to the grain direction of the beams to form a momentresisting joint. Static bending tests were conducted of <b>frame</b> <b>corners</b> with 100 X 200 mm 2 and 120 X 420 mm 2 beam cross sections. Bending capacities of the joints corresponding to a modulus of rupture of the jointed glulam beams of about 30 MPa were obtained for both closing and opening moments for the small cross sections, and about 22 MPa was obtained for the large cross sections. Simple design models for calculation of joint strength and rotational stiffness are also presented.|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we present the 2 D {{version of the}} Symmetries and Perturbation model (SPmodel), a {{probabilistic}} representation model and an EKF integration mechanism for uncertain geometric information that is suitable for sensor fusion and integration in multisensor systems. We apply the SPmodel {{to the problem of}} location estimation in mobile robotics, experimenting with the mobile robot MACROBE. We have chosen two types of sensorial information whose complementary nature allows a mobile robot to localize itself precisely in a known environment: range images and intensity images obtained from a laser sensor. By measuring distance to objects, range basically provides position information. On the other hand, the intensity image provided by the laser sensor (equivalent to a monocular vision system) can be used to detect vertical edges, corresponding to <b>corners,</b> <b>frames,</b> etc., which mainly provide angular information. Results of these experiments show that fusing simple and computationally inexpensive sensorial information can allow a mobile robot to precisely locate itself. They also demonstrate the generality ofthe proposed fusion and integration mechanism. ...|$|R

40|$|At ancient times, {{in order}} to protect earth {{buildings}} from the action of rain and water absorption, different construction techniques were used. For instance, the meticulous construction detail with special design for foundations, plinths, roofs and eaves, <b>corners,</b> <b>frames</b> of doors and windows, connections between different materials and above all a special care in rooms subject to moisture, related to bathrooms or kitchens. In order to enhance durability performance various wall building systems were used, such as the employ of plasters or paints periodically renovated, acting as sacrifice layers, the coating with other building materials to protect the earth wall and the use of tiles, wood or stone. Soil stabilization was also a way of increasing the durability of earth buildings by increasing their mechanical strength and resistance against water action. Being so, since ancient times, different stabilizers and additives have been mixed with earth materials to perform earth walls and earth plasters. In this context, we will present lime stabilization techniques and also the use of additives (biopolymers and minerals) concerning durability improvement of compressed soil, using lime, mineral additives, various biopolymers and the addition of used cooking oil...|$|R
50|$|The {{building}} {{was classified as}} a Property of Public Interest by the IPPAR, under resolution 98/80, 16 September 1980. Beginning in the 20th century, the spaces were remodelled {{with the arrival of}} French who occupied part of the former-convent. In the late 20th century the Museum of Flores was installed in the building, in the former convent and cloister, while the ancillary structures were used by the French forces, until the local health center was established. Under resolution 18/2011/A, by act of the Regional Legislative Assembly of the Azores, several projects were established, that included: a future intervention and general renovation of the convent's paints, to be consulted by the property-owners, local parish administration and municipality of Santa Cruz; and the protection of the building owing to salt.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a multi-scale corner tracking algorithm {{based on a}} multi-scale corner detector. To extract <b>corners</b> from each <b>frame</b> of video sequences, the enhanced CSS corner detector using different scales of smoothing is applied. In the matching stage two-frame correspondence combined with three-frame based monitoring is considered. We monitor tracked corners from the third frame of input sequence in matching stage. Proposed three-frame monitoring helps {{to ensure that the}} number of tracked corners and their tracked positions among frames become more robust. Since the proposed corner tracker has enough robust corners based on multi-scale corner detector, it is practical and efficient. In matching stage, among similarity functions, standard cross-correlation, zero-mean cross-correlation, sum of squared differences, and x 2 -test measurements are tested. Well-known real video databases depicting translation, scaling, rotation and affine transformation with different lighting and different camera motions are used as experiments. All experiments confirm that the performance of the proposed tracker is high and reliable due to monitoring matched <b>corners</b> among <b>frames...</b>|$|R
