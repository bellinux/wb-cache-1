5|$|A {{diagnosis}} of rhabdomyolysis may be suspected in {{anyone who has}} suffered trauma, crush injury or prolonged immobilization, {{but it may also}} be identified at a later stage due to deteriorating kidney function (abnormally raised or increasing <b>creatinine</b> and urea levels, falling urine output) or reddish-brown discoloration of the urine.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the above, blood samples are usually taken to measure urea and <b>creatinine</b> (measures of kidney function, which may be impaired in DKA {{as a result of}} dehydration) and electrolytes. Furthermore, markers of infection (complete blood count, C-reactive protein) and acute pancreatitis (amylase and lipase) may be measured. Given the need to exclude infection, chest radiography and urinalysis are usually performed.|$|E
5|$|Metformin is {{contraindicated}} {{in people}} with any condition that could {{increase the risk of}} lactic acidosis, including kidney disorders (arbitrarily defined as <b>creatinine</b> levels over 150 μmol/l (1.7mg/dl),), lung disease and liver disease. According to the prescribing information, heart failure (in particular, unstable or acute congestive heart failure) increases the risk of lactic acidosis with metformin. A 2007 systematic review of controlled trials, however, suggested metformin is the only antidiabetic drug not associated with any measurable harm {{in people with}} heart failure, and it may reduce mortality in comparison with other antidiabetic agents.|$|E
5|$|The {{diagnosis}} {{is based on}} the combination of the symptoms, as very few other diseases cause the same symptoms together. Blood tests may show elevated <b>creatinine</b> and urea levels (in kidney involvement), raised IgA levels (in about 50%), and raised C-reactive protein (CRP) or erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) results; none are specific for Henoch–Schönlein purpura. The platelet count may be raised, and distinguishes it from diseases where low platelets are the cause of the purpura, such as idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura.|$|E
5|$|In {{people who}} develop acute liver failure {{or who are}} {{otherwise}} expected to die from liver failure, the mainstay of management is liver transplantation. Liver transplants are performed in specialist centers. The most commonly used criteria for liver transplant were developed by physicians at King's College Hospital in London. Patients are recommended for transplant if they have an arterial blood pH less than 7.3 after fluid resuscitation or if a patient has Grade III or IV encephalopathy, a prothrombin time greater than 100 seconds, and a serum <b>creatinine</b> greater than 300mmol/L In a 24-hour period. Other forms of liver support have been used including partial liver transplants. These techniques {{have the advantage of}} supporting the patient while their own liver regenerates. Once liver function returns immunosuppressive drugs are commenced and they have to take immunosuppressive medication {{for the rest of their}} lives.|$|E
5|$|Like other reptiles, dinosaurs are {{primarily}} uricotelic, that is, their kidneys extract nitrogenous wastes from their bloodstream and excrete it as uric acid instead of urea or ammonia via the ureters into the intestine. In most living species, uric acid is excreted along with feces as a semisolid waste. However, {{at least some}} modern birds (such as hummingbirds) can be facultatively ammonotelic, excreting most of the nitrogenous wastes as ammonia. They also excrete creatine, rather than <b>creatinine</b> like mammals. This material, {{as well as the}} output of the intestines, emerges from the cloaca. In addition, many species regurgitate pellets, and fossil pellets that may have come from dinosaurs are known from as long ago as the Cretaceous period.|$|E
5|$|Linezolid is metabolized in the liver, by {{oxidation}} of the morpholine ring, without {{involvement of}} the cytochrome P450 system. This metabolic pathway leads to two major inactive metabolites (which each account for around 45% and 10% of an excreted dose at steady state), one minor metabolite, and several trace metabolites, none of which {{accounts for more than}} 1% of an excreted dose. Clearance of linezolid varies with age and gender; it is fastest in children (which accounts for the shorter half-life), and appears to be 20% lower in women than in men. There is a strong correlation between linezolid clearance and <b>creatinine</b> clearance (CLCR).|$|E
25|$|Cimetidine is {{a potent}} {{inhibitor}} of tubular <b>creatinine</b> secretion. <b>Creatinine</b> is a metabolic byproduct of creatine breakdown. Accumulation of <b>creatinine</b> is associated with uremia, but the symptoms of <b>creatinine</b> accumulation are unknown, as they are hard to separate from other nitrogenous waste buildups.|$|E
25|$|It {{should be}} noted that Folin's {{research}} did not focus on <b>creatinine</b> as a renal function indicator. Since the precursors of <b>creatinine</b> are synthesized in the liver, at this point in history, <b>creatinine</b> was considered indicative of liver function. It was not until 1926 that Poul Kristian Brandt Rehberg suggested <b>creatinine</b> was a significant marker for renal function.|$|E
25|$|The Jaffe {{reaction}} is a colorimetric method used in clinical chemistry to determine <b>creatinine</b> levels {{in blood and}} urine. In 1886, Max Jaffe (1841–1911) wrote about its basic principles in the paper Über den Niederschlag, welchen Pikrinsäure in normalem Harn erzeugt und über eine neue Reaction des Kreatinins in which he described the properties of <b>creatinine</b> and picric acid in an alkaline solution. The color change that occurred was directly proportional to the concentration of <b>creatinine,</b> however {{he also noted that}} several other organic compounds induced similar reactions. In the early 20th century, Otto Folin adapted Jaffe's research into a clinical procedure. The Jaffe reaction, despite its nonspecificity for <b>creatinine,</b> is still widely employed as the method of choice for <b>creatinine</b> testing due to its speed, adaptability in automated analysis, and cost-effectiveness, and is the oldest methodology continued {{to be used in the}} medical laboratory. It is this nonspecificity that has motivated the development of new reference methods for <b>creatinine</b> analysis into the 21st century.|$|E
25|$|The {{deterioration}} of kidney function may be signaled by a measurable decrease in urine output. Often, it is diagnosed {{on the basis}} of blood tests for substances normally eliminated by the kidney: urea and <b>creatinine.</b> Additionally, the ratio of BUN to <b>creatinine</b> is used to evaluate kidney injury. Both tests have their disadvantages. For instance, it takes about 24 hours for the <b>creatinine</b> level to rise, even if both kidneys have ceased to function. A number of alternative markers has been proposed (such as NGAL, KIM-1, IL18 and cystatin C), but none of them is currently established enough to replace <b>creatinine</b> as a marker of kidney function.|$|E
25|$|The hepatorenal {{syndrome}} {{is defined as}} a urine sodium less than 10mmol/L and a serum <b>creatinine</b> > 1.5mg/dl (or 24 hour <b>creatinine</b> clearance less than 40 ml/min) after a trial of volume expansion without diuretics.|$|E
25|$|Methotrexate can {{be given}} by mouth or by {{injection}} (intramuscular, intravenous, subcutaneous, or intrathecal). Doses by mouth are usually taken weekly, not daily, to limit toxicity. Routine monitoring of the complete blood count, liver function tests, and <b>creatinine</b> are recommended. Measurements of <b>creatinine</b> are recommended at least every 2 months.|$|E
25|$|<b>Creatinine</b> — {{the most}} {{commonly}} ordered clinical test to determine renal function.|$|E
25|$|Basic {{blood tests}} {{can be used}} to check the {{concentration}} of hemoglobin, platelets, sodium, potassium, chloride, bicarbonate, urea, <b>creatinine,</b> calcium, magnesium or phosphate in the blood. All of these may be affected by kidney problems. The serum <b>creatinine</b> concentration {{can be used to}} estimate the function of the kidney, called the <b>creatinine</b> clearance or estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR). More specialized tests can be ordered to discover or link certain systemic diseases to kidney failure such as infections (hepatitis B, hepatitis C), autoimmune conditions (systemic lupus erythematosus, ANCA vasculitis), paraproteinemias (amyloidosis, multiple myeloma) and metabolic diseases (diabetes, cystinosis).|$|E
25|$|Chronic {{kidney disease}} is {{identified}} by {{a blood test}} for <b>creatinine,</b> which is a breakdown product of muscle metabolism. Higher levels of <b>creatinine</b> indicate a lower glomerular filtration rate {{and as a result}} a decreased capability of the kidneys to excrete waste products. <b>Creatinine</b> levels may be normal {{in the early stages of}} CKD, and the condition is discovered if urinalysis (testing of a urine sample) shows the kidney is allowing the loss of protein or red blood cells into the urine. To fully investigate the underlying cause of kidney damage, various forms of medical imaging, blood tests, and sometimes a kidney biopsy (removing a small sample of kidney tissue) are employed to find out if a reversible cause for the kidney malfunction is present.|$|E
25|$|Although Jaffe's name {{is synonymous}} with {{clinical}} <b>creatinine</b> testing, his paper only described the principle behind what would later become the enduring method. It was Otto Folin (1867–1934), a Harvard biochemist, who adapted Jaffe's research—abandoning the standard Neubauer reaction of the time—and published several papers using the Jaffe reaction to analyze <b>creatinine</b> levels in both blood and urine. Folin began using the picric acid procedure in 1901 and included it in his 1916 Lab Manual of Biological Chemistry. During his career, Folin modified and improved several quantitative colorimetric procedures, {{the first of which}} was for <b>creatinine.</b> He took advantage of technology available at the time, using a Duboscq colorimeter for measurement precision, and is credited for introducing colorimetry into modern biochemical analysis.|$|E
25|$|<b>Creatinine</b> {{was first}} {{synthesized}} in vitro by Ivan Horbaczewski in 1885. One year later, Jaffe's research {{was published in}} the paper Über den Niederschlag, welchen Pikrinsäre in normalem Harn erzeugt und über eine neue Reaction des Kreatinins. Jaffe had noticed that, when mixed in a sodium hydroxide (NaOH) solution, picric acid and <b>creatinine</b> formed a reddish-orange color and needle-like crystal precipitate. By using zinc chloride in a process known as the Neubauer reaction, and then performing the Weyl's test, a colorimetric reaction using sodium nitroprusside (SNP), he determined that the precipitated compound was a double salt of the solution. Although he found the amount of precipitate directly proportional to the <b>creatinine</b> concentration, he also noted that the reaction was highly nonspecific and could be observed with many other organic compounds.|$|E
25|$|Diagnosis of CKD {{is largely}} based on the {{clinical}} picture combined with the measurement of the serum <b>creatinine</b> level (see above).|$|E
25|$|Calvert's {{formula is}} used to {{calculate}} the dose of carboplatin. It takes under consideration the <b>creatinine</b> clearance and the desired area under curve.|$|E
25|$|The {{nonspecificity}} of Jaffe's reaction causes falsely elevated <b>creatinine</b> {{results in}} the presence of protein, glucose, acetoacetate, ascorbic acid, guanidine, acetone, cephalosporins, aminoglycosides (mainly streptomycin), ketone bodies, α-keto acids, and other organic compounds. Ammonium is also an interferent; if the sample is plasma, care needs to be taken that ammonium heparin has not been used as an anticoagulant. Nonspecificity is markedly decreased in urine samples since urine <b>creatinine</b> levels are much higher than blood and it generally does not contain significant levels of interfering chromogens.|$|E
25|$|Renal function: Increased BUN and serum <b>creatinine</b> {{have been}} noted. Crystalluria (formation of {{crystals}} and excretion in the urine) and {{acute renal failure}} have also been seen.|$|E
25|$|Risk: 1.5-fold {{increase}} in the serum <b>creatinine,</b> or glomerular filtration rate (GFR) decrease by 25 percent, or urine output <0.5 mL/kg per hour for six hours.|$|E
25|$|A 2009 {{study found}} that {{drinking}} from polycarbonate bottles increased urinary bisphenolA levels by two thirds, from 1.2 μg/g <b>creatinine</b> to 2 μg/g <b>creatinine.</b> Consumer groups recommend that people wishing to lower their exposure to bisphenolA avoid canned food and polycarbonate plastic containers (which shares resin identification code 7 with many other plastics) unless the packaging indicates the plastic is bisphenolA-free. To avoid the possibility of BPA leaching into food or drink, the National Toxicology Panel recommends avoiding microwaving food in plastic containers, putting plastics in the dishwasher, or using harsh detergents.|$|E
25|$|Screening {{those who}} have neither {{symptoms}} nor risk factors for CKD is not recommended. Those who should be screened include: those with hypertension or history of cardiovascular disease, those with diabetes or marked obesity, those aged > 60 years, subjects with indigenous racial origin, those {{with a history of}} kidney disease in the past and subjects who have relatives who had kidney disease requiring dialysis. Screening should include calculation of estimated GFR from the serum <b>creatinine</b> level, and measurement of urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR) in a first-morning urine specimen (this reflects the amount of a protein called albumin in the urine), as well as a urine dipstick screen for hematuria. The GFR (glomerular filtration rate) is derived from the serum <b>creatinine</b> and is proportional to 1/creatinine, i.e. it is a reciprocal relationship (the higher the <b>creatinine,</b> the lower the GFR). It reflects one aspect of kidney function: how efficiently the glomeruli (filtering units) work. But as they make up <5% of the mass of the kidney, the GFR does not indicate all aspects of kidney health and function. This can be done by combining the GFR level with the clinical assessment of the patient (especially fluid state) and measuring the levels of hemoglobin, potassium, phosphate and parathyroid hormone (PTH). Normal GFR is 90-120 mLs/min. The units of <b>creatinine</b> vary from country to country.|$|E
25|$|Use of serum <b>creatinine</b> and cystatin C {{was found}} very {{effective}} in accurately reflecting the GFR in a study reported in the July 5, 2012 issue of the New England Journal of Medicine.|$|E
25|$|Elevations of serum <b>creatinine</b> {{and more}} serious renal damage such as acute renal failure, chronic nephritis and {{nephrotic}} syndrome, are also possible. These conditions also often begin with edema and hyperkalemia.|$|E
25|$|During {{treatment}} with ketorolac, clinicians monitor for {{the manifestation of}} adverse effects and side effects. Lab tests, such as liver function tests, bleeding time, BUN, serum <b>creatinine</b> and electrolyte levels are often used and help to identify potential complications.|$|E
25|$|Recommended {{laboratory}} blood testing includes: cross-matching blood, hemoglobin, hematocrit, platelets, coagulation time, and electrolytes. If {{the ratio}} of blood urea nitrogen to <b>creatinine</b> is greater than 30 the source is more likely from the upper GI tract.|$|E
25|$|The normal values {{decrease}} {{until the}} first year of life, remaining relatively stable before they increase again, especially beyond age 50. <b>Creatinine</b> levels increase until puberty and differ according to gender from then on, making their interpretation problematic for pediatric patients.|$|E
25|$|Monitoring {{of kidney}} function, by serial serum <b>creatinine</b> {{measurements}} and monitoring of urine output, is routinely performed. In the hospital, insertion of a urinary catheter helps monitor urine output and relieves possible bladder outlet obstruction, such as with an enlarged prostate.|$|E
25|$|Clinical {{cases have}} been {{associated}} with acute fever, myalgias, bronchospasm, pruritic rashes, lymphadenopathy, subcutaneous nodules associated with eosinophilia, elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate and elevated <b>creatinine</b> kinase levels. Symptoms may last as long as five years. Segmental necrotizing enteritis has been reported on one occasion.|$|E
25|$|Contrast-induced {{nephropathy}} (CIN) {{is a form}} {{of kidney}} damage in which there has been recent exposure to medical imaging contrast material without another clear cause for the acute kidney injury. CIN is classically defined as a serum <b>creatinine</b> increase of at least 25% and/or an absolute increase in serum <b>creatinine</b> of 0.5mg/dL after using iodine contrast agent without another clear cause for acute kidney injury, but other definitions have also been used. Despite extensive speculation, the actual occurrence of contrast-induced nephropathy has not been demonstrated in the literature. The mechanism of contrast-induced nephropathy is not entirely understood, but is thought to include direct damage from reactive oxygen species, contrast-induced increase in urine output, increased oxygen consumption, changes in dilation and narrowing of the blood vessels to the kidneys, and changes in urine viscosity.|$|E
25|$|BUN-to-creatinine ratio: A BUN to <b>creatinine</b> {{ratio is}} used to predict various conditions. A high BUN/creatinine ratio can occur in severe hydration, acute kidney failure, {{congestive}} heart failure, and intestinal bleeding. A low BUN/creatinine ratio can indicate a low protein diet, celiac disease, rhabdomyolysis, or cirrhosis of the liver.|$|E
25|$|It is {{important}} to differentiate CKD from acute kidney injury (AKI) because AKI can be reversible. Abdominal ultrasound, in which {{the size of the}} kidneys is measured, is commonly performed. Kidneys with CKD are usually smaller (≤ 9nbsp&cm) than normal kidneys, with notable exceptions such as in early diabetic nephropathy and polycystic kidney disease. Another diagnostic clue that helps differentiate CKD from AKI is a gradual rise in serum <b>creatinine</b> (over several months or years) as opposed to a sudden increase in the serum <b>creatinine</b> (several days to weeks). If these levels are unavailable (because the patient has been well and has had no blood tests), it is occasionally necessary to treat a patient briefly as having AKI until the kidney impairment has been established to be irreversible.|$|E
25|$|Proteinuria ≥ 0.3 grams (300mg) or more {{of protein}} in a 24-hour urine sample or a SPOT urinary protein to <b>creatinine</b> ratio ≥ 0.3 or a urine {{dipstick}} reading of 1+ or greater (dipstick reading should only be used if other quantitative methods are not available).|$|E
