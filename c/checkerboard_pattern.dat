5|$|In a video {{posted on}} July 21, 2009, YouTube {{software}} engineer Peter Bradshaw announced that YouTube users can now upload 3D videos. The videos {{can be viewed}} in several different ways, including the common anaglyph (cyan/red lens) method which utilizes glasses worn by the viewer to achieve the 3D effect. The YouTube Flash player can display stereoscopic content interleaved in rows, columns or a <b>checkerboard</b> <b>pattern,</b> side-by-side or anaglyph using a red/cyan, green/magenta or blue/yellow combination. In May 2011, an HTML5 version of the YouTube player began supporting side-by-side 3D footage that is compatible with Nvidia 3D Vision.|$|E
5|$|James Fenhagen and Byron Taylor {{created the}} {{original}} stage design for Double Dare. The {{design for the}} original series' set {{was inspired by a}} 1980s Italian postmodern design and architecture group known as the Memphis Group. Glass brick walls and yellow and pink, often in a <b>checkerboard</b> <b>pattern,</b> were prominent aspects of the set design. Highlighted by blue and yellow tile-style floors, Geoffrey Darby gave the direction for the set to look like a natatorium (swimming pool), while Robert Mittenthal feels its inspiration is derived from a bathroom. All the original Double Dare music was composed by Edd Kalehoff.|$|E
5|$|Although Chang'an was {{the capital}} of the earlier Han and Jin dynasties, after {{subsequent}} destruction in warfare, it was the Sui dynasty model that comprised the Tang era capital. The roughly square dimensions of the city had six miles (10km) of outer walls running east to west, and more than five miles (8km) of outer walls running north to south. The royal palace, the Taiji Palace, stood north of the city's central axis. From the large Mingde Gates located mid-center of the main southern wall, a wide city avenue stretched from there all the way north to the central administrative city, behind which was the Chentian Gate of the royal palace, or Imperial City. Intersecting this were fourteen main streets running east to west, while eleven main streets ran north to south. These main intersecting roads formed 108 rectangular wards with walls and four gates each, and each ward filled with multiple city blocks. The city was made famous for this <b>checkerboard</b> <b>pattern</b> of main roads with walled and gated districts, its layout even mentioned in one of Du Fu's poems. During the Heian period, the city of Heian kyō (present-day Kyoto) of Japan like many cities was arranged in the checkerboard street grid pattern of the Tang capital and in accordance with traditional geomancy following the model of Chang'an. Of these 108 wards in Chang'an, two of them (each the size of two regular city wards) were designated as government-supervised markets, and other space reserved for temples, gardens, ponds, etc. Throughout the entire city, there were 111 Buddhist monasteries, 41 Daoist abbeys, 38 family shrines, 2 official temples, 7 churches of foreign religions, 10 city wards with provincial transmission offices, 12 major inns, and 6 graveyards. Some city wards were literally filled with open public playing fields or the backyards of lavish mansions for playing horse polo and cuju football. In 662, Emperor Gaozong moved the imperial court to the Daming Palace, which became the political center of the empire and served as the royal residence of the Tang emperors for more than 220 years.|$|E

40|$|<b>Checkerboard</b> <b>patterns</b> {{have been}} {{proposed}} to explain the real space structure observed in scanning tunneling microscopy experiments on BSCCO and Na-CCOC. However, simple <b>checkerboard</b> <b>patterns</b> have low energy incommsensurate (IC) spin peaks rotated 45 degrees {{from the direction of}} the charge IC peaks, contrary to what is seen in neutron scattering. Here, we study modulated <b>checkerboard</b> <b>patterns</b> which can resolve the low frequency inconsistency. Using spin-wave theory, we explore the spin response of these superstructures and find that the high energy response is inconsistent with neutron scattering results. In particular, the modulated checkerboard structures are incapable of supporting the experimentally well-established resonance peak at (pi,pi) ...|$|R

25|$|Public safety officers, such {{as those}} from the police, fire department, {{ambulance}} service, and customs, often wear peaked caps, especially on formal occasions. In the US, police forces use caps that have softer tops and are not round and rigid in form (notable are those worn in New York and San Francisco). British and Australian policemen have a <b>checkerboard</b> <b>pattern</b> on the cap band, and traffic wardens often have a reflective yellow strip.|$|E

25|$|The Checkerboard Inn, {{also known}} as the Forshee-Jenkins House, is a late 18th-century frame {{building}} located on Mansion Ridge Golf Club in Monroe, New York, United States. Originally built as a house, within a decade it went into service as an inn when the Orange Turnpike, an early toll road through the area, opened in 1802. It takes its name from an early owner's reputed decision to paint it in a <b>checkerboard</b> <b>pattern</b> to attract business, although this has not been conclusively established.|$|E
25|$|The {{road was}} built with {{mortgages}} from New York, Boston and London, backed by land grants. There were no federal cash subsidies, But {{there was a}} loan to the Central Pacific that was eventually repaid at six percent interest. The federal government offered land-grants in a <b>checkerboard</b> <b>pattern.</b> The railroad sold every-other square, with the government opening its half to homesteaders. The government also loaned money—later repaid—at $16,000 per mile on level stretches, and $32,000 to $48,000 in mountainous terrain. Local and state governments also aided the financing.|$|E
25|$|Hognose snakes are {{extremely}} variable {{in color and}} pattern. Heterodon nasicus and H. kennerlyi tend to be sandy colored with black and white markings, while H. platirhinos varies from reds, greens, oranges, browns, to melanistic (i.e. black) depending on locality. They are sometimes blotched and sometimes solid-colored. Leiohetereodon geayi is a brown or tan colored snake with dark speckling on it. Leioheterodon madagascariensis is typically green and yellow with a black <b>checkerboard</b> <b>pattern</b> along its back. Leioheterodon modestus is normally a gold-brown color. Some species in the genus Lystrophis {{are referred to as}} tri-color hognose snakes and sometimes as false coral snakes because they display alternating bands of red, white, and black.|$|E
40|$|A {{series of}} {{surfaces}} with microscale <b>checkerboard</b> <b>patterns</b> consisting of continuous central lines and discontinuous lateral lines were fabricated.

The central continuous lines were found to have a strong influence on the dynamic wetting properties and moving trajectories of the water droplets. The droplets move more easily in the direction parallel to the central continuous lines and less easily in the direction perpendicular to the central continuous lines. Meanwhile, the droplets' moving path tends to incline toward the central continuous lines from a tilting direction. When the microsurface was modified with a layer of nanowire, the surface wettability was found to be isotropic and superhydrophobic...|$|R

25|$|The {{heating plant}} room {{underneath}} the steeple was used until 1. July 1946 as church. During {{the time of}} the reconstruction starting from 26 September 1948 the parish hall which is under the church was used as a church beneath the church. In 1950 Holy Cross became its own parish with its own church executive committee. 1951 the order for the re-establishment of the church could be given. 1952 the inside of the church were restored. The church windows were glazed new by the glass painter Lorenz Matheis with stained glass window in white and golden yellow colours. The walls and the ceiling were painted in a single-coloured finish. 1957 the kindergarten in the west of the church was built. In 1965 a stage for events was built in the parish hall under the church ship during a renovation. In 1968 the altar area was transformed, a consequence of the liturgy reformation by the Second Vatican Council. The altar was shifted, so that the priest could celebrate the service turned to the fold. A stone lectern replaced the torn off pulpit. The old altar under the great wall-cross in the chancel was replaced by the baptismal font. The ceiling got an orange and the walls a light-beige paint. In 1969 the first election of the parish council took place. In 1975 the board of directors elected by the parish council replaced the church executive committee. In 1990 a further transformation of the altar was executed. The baptismal font now was located in the entrance hall of the church. It was replaced by a sacramential altar at the place of the old high altar was built and the tabernacle was placed on it. Starting from 1991 the minister of the fold was also simultaneous ministers of the parish Maria-Rosenkranz (=Mary Rosary) in Frankfurt-Seckbach. 1992 the church interior was restored to the original condition with the walls in a <b>checkerboard</b> <b>pattern</b> in light and dark red colours.|$|E
500|$|As {{part of the}} U.S. government's {{desire to}} foster {{settlement}} and economic development in the western states, in July 1866, Congress passed the Oregon and California Railroad Act. This act made [...] of land available for any company that built a railroad from Portland, Oregon to San Francisco. The land was to be distributed {{by the state of}} Oregon in [...] land grants for each mile of track completed. Two companies, both of which named themselves the Oregon Central Railroad, began a competition to build the railroad, one {{on the west side of}} the Willamette River and one on the east side. The two lines would eventually merge and reorganize as the Oregon and California Railroad. In 1869, Congress changed how the grants were to be distributed, requiring the railroads to sell land along the line to settlers in [...] parcels at $2.50 per acre. The land was distributed in a <b>checkerboard</b> <b>pattern,</b> with sections laid out for [...] on either side of the rail corridor with the government retaining the alternate sections for future growth.|$|E
