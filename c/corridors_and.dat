5|$|Both the {{external}} walls and those around the keep were fitted with merlons and parapets, with the parapets of the keep positioned 6.5 meters higher {{than their counterparts}} along {{the external}} wall. This was done to establish a secondary defensive line that enabled the building's defenders to shoot arrows at attackers who breached the external walls. The core building {{was linked to the}} external fortifications by <b>corridors</b> <b>and</b> chambers.|$|E
5|$|During the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971, Kursura {{operated}} in the Arabian Sea. She {{was given the}} patrol duties at two designated areas before the war started, but was ordered to operate under two restrictions: she was not to cross demarcated shipping <b>corridors</b> <b>and</b> she could attack a target only after positive identification. The aims of her patrol were to sink any Pakistani naval warships, to sink merchant shipping when specifically ordered, and to conduct general patrol and surveillance.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in the mid-6th century, as Buddhism {{was brought}} to Japan from Baekje, new styles of shrine {{architecture}} were introduced; today's Shinto shrine blueprint is of Buddhist origin. The concept of temples {{as a place of}} assembly was applied to shrines. Spaces for worship were added in the form of extended roofs or worship halls (haiden) in addition to the main hall (honden). The following stylistic elements of Buddhist temple architecture were assimilated and applied to Japanese shrines: column-base stones, brackets, curved roofs, painted surfaces, metal ornaments, <b>corridors</b> <b>and</b> pagodas.|$|E

5|$|In 2005, the {{building}} underwent an extensive $20million renovation directed by Chicago architect Gunny Harboe, whose restoration work included Loop landmarks the Rookery Building and Reliance Building. The project included {{restoration of the}} main lobby to emphasize the design features of the art deco era, elevator modernization, façade renovation and cleaning, and the continued renovation of upper floor <b>corridors</b> <b>and</b> hallways. Though impractically small for modern use, mailboxes in the lobby were restored to their original condition to follow the theme of vertical lines found throughout the complex. An improved electrical infrastructure, with ten main feeds from seven different Commonwealth Edison electrical substations, was added in addition to redundant cooling systems and upgraded telecommunications capabilities.|$|E
5|$|Meyer {{had never}} been happy with the brightly lit <b>corridors</b> <b>and</b> feel of the Enterprise, a dissatisfaction that {{extended}} to his work on The Wrath of Khan. For The Undiscovered Country, Meyer wanted the Enterprise interiors to feel grittier and more realistic; the metal was worn around the edges to look used without looking beat up. Narita's plans to transform {{the look of the}} Enterprise on a scale not seen since The Wrath of Khan were complicated by the necessary use of existing sets.|$|E
5|$|Seven {{kinds of}} amphibians, which drink no water but absorb it through their {{permeable}} skins, {{have been identified}} in Petrified Forest National Park. Tiger salamanders, found in grassland and near major drainages, are the only salamander species known in Arizona. Woodhouse’s toads, which are seldom seen, are the largest toads in the park. They like grasslands, riparian <b>corridors,</b> <b>and</b> developed areas. Red-spotted toads, most active in the rainy season, July through September, are found in rocky areas near streams and in canyons. The Great Plains toad, the most common toad in the park, prefers grasslands. Resident spadefoot toads include the New Mexico, plains, and Couch's varieties.|$|E

5|$|The scenes {{on board}} the Queen Anne were filmed aboard the famous {{passenger}} liner RMS Queen Mary, which has long {{been used as a}} hotel. The X-Files crew spent a total of eleven days filming on the Queen Mary, and erected wrap-around scaffolding on the bridge in order to block out the lights of nearby Long Beach, California. To make it look like it was raining during the scenes on the bridge, the crew installed large sprinkler systems to provide a constant supply of water. Unhappy with the remodeled style of the ship's <b>corridors</b> <b>and</b> ballroom, Carter had portions of the ship recarpeted and redecorated to give the finished episode a late-1930s style.|$|E
5|$|Virginia has Amtrak {{passenger}} rail service along several <b>corridors,</b> <b>and</b> Virginia Railway Express (VRE) maintains two commuter lines into Washington, D.C. from Fredericksburg and Manassas. VRE {{is one of}} the nation's fastest growing commuter rail services, handling nearly 20,000 passengers a day. The Washington Metro rapid transit system serves Northern Virginia as far west as communities along I-66 in Fairfax County, with expansion plans to reach Loudoun County by 2017. Major freight railroads in Virginia include Norfolk Southern and CSX Transportation. Commuter buses include the Fairfax Connector and the Shenandoah Valley Commuter Bus. The Virginia Department of Transportation operates several free ferries throughout Virginia, the most notable being the Jamestown-Scotland ferry which crosses the James River in Surry County.|$|E
5|$|Weisman uses New York City as a {{model to}} outline how an unmaintained urban area would deconstruct. He {{explains}} that sewers would clog, underground streams would flood subway <b>corridors,</b> <b>and</b> soils under roads would erode and cave in. From interviews {{with members of the}} Wildlife Conservation Society and the New York Botanical Gardens Weisman predicts that native vegetation would return, spreading from parks and out-surviving invasive species. Without humans to provide food and warmth, rats and cockroaches would die off.|$|E

5|$|Aboard the Doctor's TARDIS, House {{threatens to}} kill Amy and Rory. He plays with their senses {{as they try}} to flee through the <b>corridors,</b> <b>and</b> then sends Nephew after them. Idris makes a psychic {{connection}} with Rory to give him directions to a secondary control room (identical to the 9th and 10th Doctor's TARDIS), where he and Amy are able to lower the TARDIS's shields without House's interference. This allows the Doctor to land the makeshift TARDIS in the secondary control room, which atomises Nephew. House deletes the secondary control room as he prepares to break through the rift, which the Doctor anticipates. The TARDIS's safety protocols transfer them to the main control room, where the dying Idris releases the TARDIS's matrix back to the TARDIS, destroying House. A remnant of the TARDIS's matrix, in Idris' body, sadly states that she {{will not be able to}} speak to the Doctor again but will be there for him. Idris's body then disappears as the TARDIS matrix is fully restored.|$|E
5|$|Flight 706 had {{departed}} Los Angeles just after 6pm, on route to Seattle, with scheduled stopovers in Salt Lake City, Utah; Boise, Idaho; Lewiston, Idaho; Pasco, Washington and Yakima, Washington. The F-4 Phantom was arriving at Marine Corps Air Station El Toro near Irvine from Naval Air Station Fallon in Nevada. The F-4 pilot and all 49 {{passengers and crew}} aboard the civilian airliner died in the collision over the San Gabriel Mountains, near Duarte. Only the Radar Intercept Officer of the F-4 survived. The crash of RW 706 prompted the US Armed Forces to agree to both {{reduce the number of}} military aircraft operating under visual flight rules in civilian air <b>corridors,</b> <b>and</b> to require military aircraft to contact civilian air traffic controllers.|$|E
5|$|Further {{investigations}} {{were then}} performed in 1900 by Alessandro Barsanti, who uncovered the {{vertical access shaft}} leading to the burial chamber. Barsanti, seeing that several <b>corridors</b> <b>and</b> chambers were seemingly unfinished and that all were completely devoid of artefacts, deemed that the pyramid had never been used. Shortly after, in 19101911, George Reisner and Clarence S. Fisher worked on the site, excavating {{the north and east}} exteriors of the pyramid as well as the cemeteries surrounding it. The dimensions of the pyramid as estimated by Barsanti, Reisner and Fisher differ greatly and even the numbers of subterranean galleries they report are in disagreement. Unfortunately, the pyramid lies within a restricted military area since 1970 and consequently no excavation has been undertaken there since Reisner and Fisher's superficial work, leaving the structures beneath the pyramid in doubt. Furthermore, the pyramid is now sanded up, hampering modern estimations of its dimensions.|$|E

5|$|In most temples, {{the focus}} was the cult image: a statue of the temple god which that god's ba was {{believed}} to inhabit while interacting with humans. The sanctuary in these temples contained either a naos, a cabinet-like shrine that housed the divine image, or a model barque containing the image within its cabin, which was used to carry the image during festival processions. In some cases the sanctuary may have housed several cult statues. To emphasize the sanctuary's sacred nature, it was kept in total darkness. Whereas in earlier times the sanctuary lay {{at the very back}} of the building, in the Late and Ptolemaic periods it became a freestanding building inside the temple, further insulated from the outside world by the surrounding <b>corridors</b> <b>and</b> rooms.|$|E
5|$|Major General Ariel Sharon's 143rd Armored Division {{was given}} the {{critical}} tasks of opening the <b>corridors</b> <b>and</b> laying the bridges. His division included Tuvia Raviv's 600th Armored Brigade, Colonel Amnon Reshef's 14th Armored Brigade, and the 'Haim' Brigade commanded by Colonel Haim Erez. Major General Abraham Adan's 162nd Armored Division was tasked with crossing the canal and achieving an encirclement with its 300 tanks. The division included Colonel Natke Nir's 217th Armored Brigade, Colonel Gabi Amir's 460th Armored Brigade and Aryeh Keren's 500th Armored Brigade. A paratrooper brigade would be transferred to Adan's division {{during the course of}} the battle. Kalman Magen's 252nd Armored Division would initially launch diversionary attacks elsewhere to draw attention from Sharon's operations at Deversoir. Thereafter the division would hold and secure the corridor and bridgehead.|$|E
5|$|Spindizzy is {{an action}} and puzzle game played from an {{isometric}} perspective. Players can view {{the playing field}} from four angles, and rotate between them. The game {{takes place in a}} fictional landscape of interconnected stages suspended in a dimensional space. The player controls a probe called a Gyroscopic Environmental Reconnaissance And Land-Mapping Device (GERALD), via keyboard commands or a joystick. The craft is able to transform—and modify its mobility as a result—between three configurations: a ball, an inverted square pyramid, and a gyroscope. Players navigate the probe through the stages to explore the world within a time limit. The time limit can be extended by collecting power jewels scattered through the world and is decreased by falling off a stage. Stages feature ramps, <b>corridors,</b> <b>and</b> other obstacles that hinder the player from quickly traversing them. The game ends when time expires or the world is completely explored.|$|E

5|$|The {{interior}} of the Prometheus was built across a two-level structure, fronted by a large, faceted, wrap around windscreen. Theron's quarters were designed to represent her high status in the crew, and were furnished with modern and futuristic items, including Swarovski chandeliers and a Fazioli piano. The ship's garage {{was built on the}} backlot of Pinewood Studios in England. The vehicles inside were built in 11 weeks and were designed to operate on difficult terrain while having a futuristic aesthetic. Max created a large pyramid structure for the alien world, which had its main interior areas connected by a series of chambers, <b>corridors,</b> <b>and</b> tunnels; it was so large that some members of the film crew became lost inside it. The pyramid was enhanced in post-production to further increase its size. One of the key sets, the chamber where the crew find the humanoid-head statue, was designed to resemble the {{interior of}} a cathedral and convey a quasi-religious impression. Giger designed the murals that appear within the chamber.|$|E
5|$|The House of Venus, {{towards the}} eastern side of the city under a {{prominent}} cypress tree, was one of the most luxurious residences in the city. It had a set of private baths and a richly decorated interior, with fine mosaics dating from the 2nd century AD showing animal and mythological scenes. There were mosaics in seven <b>corridors</b> <b>and</b> eight rooms. The central courtyard has a fanciful mosaic depicting racing chariots in a hippodrome, drawn by teams of peacocks, geese and ducks. The mosaic of Venus for which the house is named has been removed to Tangier, but in the next-door room is a still-extant mosaic showing Diana and a companion nymph being surprised by Actaeon while bathing. Actaeon is depicted with horns beginning to sprout from his head as he is transformed by the angry goddess into a stag, before being chased down and killed by his own hunting dogs. The house appears to have been destroyed some time after the city's fall around 280; a mosaic depicting Cupids feeding birds with grain has been charred by what appears to have been a fire burning directly on top of it, perhaps resulting from the building being taken over by squatters who used the mosaic as the site of a hearth.|$|E
