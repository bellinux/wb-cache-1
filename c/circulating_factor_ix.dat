40|$|To {{understand}} the molecular basis for hemophilia B {{in patients with}} little or no <b>circulating</b> <b>Factor</b> <b>IX</b> antigen, a patient who had less than 0. 2 % <b>circulating</b> <b>Factor</b> <b>IX</b> antigen (Factor IXSeattle 2) was selected for analysis of his Factor IX gene. Genomic DNA fragments from the abnormal gene were cloned into bacteriophage lambda vectors and recombinant phage were identified using radiolabeled genomic probes obtained from the normal Factor IX gene. The exons and flanking regions of the abnormal gene were sequenced by the dideoxy chain-termination method and this sequence was compared with that of the normal gene. Only one significant difference was observed, the deletion of a single adenine nucleotide in exon V. This resulted in a frameshift that converted an aspartic acid at position 85 in the protein to a valine and the formation of a stop signal at position 86. These data indicate that the gene for Factor IXSeattle 2 codes for an 85 residue polypeptide that terminates after the first epidermal growth factor domain. Thus, the putative Factor IXSeattle 2 polypeptide lacks the second epidermal growth factor domain, the activation peptide, and the catalytic domain present in the normal protein. This provides an explanation for the coagulation disorder in this patient and represents the first report of a single nucleotide deletion and frameshift resulting in hemophilia B...|$|E
40|$|In earlier work, {{we showed}} that adeno-associated virus–mediated {{delivery}} of a Factor IX gene to skeletal muscle by direct intramuscular injection resulted in therapeutic levels of <b>circulating</b> <b>Factor</b> <b>IX</b> in mice.

We used a novel intravascular delivery technique to achieve successful transduction of extensive areas of skeletal muscle in a large animal with hemophilia. We provide here the first report of long-term (> 3 years, with observation ongoing), robust Factor IX expression (circulating levels of 4 %- 14 %) by muscle-directed gene transfer in a large animal, resulting in essentially complete correction of the bleeding disorder in hemophilic dogs. The results of this translational study establish an experimental basis for clinical studies of this delivery method in humans with hemophilia B.

40|$|Direct {{sequencing}} of amplified genomic DNA {{has been used}} to investigate the molecular basis of haemophilia B and thus identify specific amino acids that are essential for maintenance of structure or function of factor IX. Substitution of Cys 336, Asn 120 results in loss of <b>circulating</b> <b>factor</b> <b>IX</b> antigen and deletion of Arg 37 in gross reduction of circulating protein and loss of activity, while substitution of Arg - 4, Arg 333, Asp 64 and Pro 55 cause loss of function without marked reduction in protein serum levels. Frameshift or point mutations resulting in marked loss of coding information are found in patients who develop antibodies to administered factor IX. An enhanced rate of mutation is evident at two CpG dinucleotides in the factor IX gene, which accounts for approximately 25 % of all point mutations causing haemophilia B known to date. Direct {{sequencing of}} mutations also permits, for the first time, rapid and unequivocal prenatal and carrier diagnoses, in all cases, by eliminating the need for informative segregation of markers...|$|E

This {{article is}} {{published}} with open access at Springerlink. com Background and Objectives Recombinant <b>factor</b> <b>IX</b> Fc fusion protein (rFIXFc) is a clotting factor developed using monomeric Fc fusion technology {{to prolong the}} <b>circulating</b> half-life of <b>factor</b> <b>IX.</b> The objective of this analysis was to elucidate the pharmacokinetic characteristics of rFIXFc in patients with haemophilia B and identify covariates that affect rFIXFc disposition. Methods Population pharmacokinetic analysis using NONMEM was performed with clinical data from two completed trials in previously treated patients with severe to moderate haemophilia B. Twelve patients from a phase 1 / 2 a study and 123 patients from a registrational phase 3 study were included in this population analysis. Results A three-compartment model was found to best describe the pharmacokinetics of rFIXFc. For a typical 73 kg patient, the clearance (CL), volume of the central compartment (V 1) and volume of distribution at steady state (Vss) were 2. 39 dL/h, 71. 4 dL and 198 dL, respec-tively. Because of repeat pharmacokinetic profiles at week 26 for patients in a subgroup, inclusion of inter-occasion variability (IOV) on CL and V 1 were evaluated and significantly improved the model.

40|$|A {{study was}} carried out on mechanisms, {{independent}} of activated Factor XI, capable of activating <b>Factor</b> <b>IX.</b> The reaction product of tissue factor and Factor VII functioned as a potent <b>Factor</b> <b>IX</b> activator in the assay system used.

40|$|Multiple {{independent}} {{adeno-associated virus}} (AAV) gene therapy clinical trials for hemophilia B, utilizing different AAV serotypes, have reported a vector dose-dependent loss of <b>circulating</b> <b>factor</b> <b>IX</b> (FIX) protein associated with capsid-specific CD 8 + T cell (Cap-CD 8) elimination of transduced hepatocytes. Hemophilia B patients who develop transient transaminitis {{and loss of}} FIX protein may be stabilized with the immune-suppressive (IS) drug prednisolone, but do not all recover lost FIX expression, whereas some patients fail to respond to IS. We developed the first animal model demonstrating Cap-CD 8 infiltration and elimination of AAV-transduced hepatocytes of immune-deficient mice. Here, we extend this model to an immune-competent host where Cap-CD 8 transfer to AAV 2 -F 9 -treated mice significantly reduced circulating and hepatocyte FIX expression. Further, we studied two high-expressing liver tropic AAV 2 variants, AAV 2 -LiA and AAV 2 -LiC, obtained from a rationally designed capsid library. Unlike AAV 2, Cap-CD 8 did not initially reduce circulating FIX levels for either variant. However, FIX levels were significantly reduced in AAV 2 -LiC-F 9 -treated, but not AAV 2 -LiA-F 9 -treated, mice at the study endpoint. Going forward, the immune-competent model may {{provide an opportunity to}} induce immunological memory directed against a surrogate AAV capsid antigen and study recall responses following AAV gene transfer...|$|E
40|$|We {{have used}} the {{polymerase}} chain reaction to amplify the entire coding region of canine factor IX from a hemophilia B animal. When the sequence was compared to that which codes for normal canine factor IX, a single missense mutation was identified. This mutation (G [...] A at nucleotide 1477) results in the substitution of glutamic acid for glycine- 379 in the catalytic domain of the molecule. The mutation creates a new restriction site that allowed confirmation of the abnormal sequence in both hemophilic and carrier animals. Amino acid 379 in canine factor IX corresponds to position 381 in human factor IX, a location at which no human mutations have been described. Moreover, it occurs {{at one of the}} few amino acids that have been rigorously conserved among the trypsin-like serine proteases throughout evolution. The mutation responsible for canine hemophilia B results in a complete lack of <b>circulating</b> <b>factor</b> <b>IX</b> in the affected animals. As it is unusual for a missense mutation to result in a complete absence of protein product, structural modeling of the mutant and normal proteins was pursued. These studies suggest that the observed mutation would have major adverse effects on the tertiary structure of the aberrant factor IX molecule. The elucidation of this mutation sheds light on structure-function relationships in factor IX and should facilitate future experiments directed toward gene therapy of this disease...|$|E
40|$|Hemophilia B Chapel Hill is a mild {{hereditary}} hemorrhagic {{disorder in}} which the <b>factor</b> <b>IX</b> antigen is present in normal amounts but <b>factor</b> <b>IX</b> biological activity is markedly reduced. Previous {{studies have demonstrated that}} purified <b>factor</b> <b>IX</b> Chapel Hill has 8 % of the activity of normal human <b>factor</b> <b>IX</b> and that the activation of <b>factor</b> <b>IX</b> Chapel Hill is defective in that only one of the two peptide bonds hydrolyzed during activation of normal <b>factor</b> <b>IX</b> is cleaved. The tryptic peptides from normal human <b>factor</b> <b>IX</b> and <b>factor</b> <b>IX</b> Chapel Hill were subjected to analysis by high-performance liquid chromatography. Comparison of the elution profile of the peptides obtained from <b>factor</b> <b>IX</b> Chapel Hill and normal <b>factor</b> <b>IX</b> demonstrated that the tripeptide Leu-Thr-Arg, which is derived from the normal molecule (positions 143 - 145) immediately amino-terminal from the Arg-Ala peptide bond at 145 - 146 that is cleaved during the activation of <b>factor</b> <b>IX</b> with <b>factor</b> XIa, was absent in the digest obtained from <b>factor</b> <b>factor</b> <b>IX</b> Chapel Hill.

40|$|We {{previously}} {{demonstrated that}} the primary region of <b>factor</b> <b>IX</b> and IXa responsible for saturable specific binding to bovine aortic endothelial cells resides in residues 3 - 11 at the amino terminus of <b>factor</b> <b>IX.</b> We also demonstrated that mutations of lysine to alanine at residue 5, <b>factor</b> <b>IX</b> K 5 A, or valine to lysine at residue 10, <b>factor</b> <b>IX</b> V 10 K, resulted in a molecule unable to bind to endothelial cells. Moreover, a mutation with lysine to arginine at residue 5, <b>factor</b> <b>IX</b> K 5 R, resulted in a <b>factor</b> <b>IX</b> molecule with increased affinity for the endothelial cell binding site. In this paper we report that collagen IV is a strong candidate for the <b>factor</b> <b>IX</b> binding site on endothelial cells. <b>Factor</b> <b>IX</b> and <b>factor</b> <b>IX</b> K 5 R compete with 125 I-labeled <b>factor</b> <b>IX</b> for binding to tetrameric collagen IV immobilized on microtiter plates, while factor X, factor VII, and <b>factor</b> <b>IX</b> K 5 A or V 10 K fail to compete.

40|$|The {{gamma-carboxyglutamic acid}} (Gla) domains of the vitamin K-dependent blood {{coagulation}} proteins contain 10 highly conserved Gla residues {{within the first}} 33 residues, but <b>factor</b> <b>IX</b> is unique in possessing 2 additional Gla residues at positions 36 and 40. To determine their importance, <b>factor</b> <b>IX</b> species lacking these Gla residues were isolated from heterologously expressed human <b>factor</b> <b>IX.</b> Using ion-exchange chromatography, peptide mapping, mass spectrometry, and N-terminal sequencing, we have purified and identified two partially carboxylated recombinant <b>factor</b> <b>IX</b> species; <b>factor</b> IX/gamma 40 E is uncarboxylated at residue 40 and factor IX/gamma 36, 40 E is uncarboxylated at both residues 36 and 40. These species were compared with the fully gamma-carboxylated recombinant <b>factor</b> <b>IX,</b> unfractionated recombinant <b>factor</b> <b>IX,</b> and plasma-derived <b>factor</b> <b>IX.</b> As monitored by anti-factor IX:Ca (II) -specific antibodies and by the quenching of intrinsic fluorescence, all these <b>factor</b> <b>IX</b> species underwent the Ca(II) -induced conformational transition required for phospholipid membrane binding and bound equivalently to phospholipid vesicles composed of phosphatidylserine, phosphatidylcholine, and phosphatidylethanolamine. Endothelial cell binding was also similar in all species, with half-maximal inhibition of the binding of 125 I-labeled plasma-derived <b>factor</b> <b>IX</b> at concentrations of 2 - 6 nM. Functionally, factor IX/gamma 36, 40 E and factor IX/gamma 40 E were similar to fully gamma-carboxylated recombinant <b>factor</b> <b>IX</b> and plasma-derived <b>factor</b> <b>IX</b> in their coagulant activity and {{in their ability to}} participate in the activation of factor X in the tenase complex both with synthetic phospholipid vesicles and activated platelets.

40|$|Abstract. We {{report a}} study on the {{importance}} of <b>factor</b> <b>IX</b> activation in thromboplastin-dependent coagulation in plasma. Diluted, CaCl 2 -containing thromboplastin solutions at constant phospholipid concentration were used to trigger the coagulation in plasma from patients with congenital <b>factor</b> <b>IX</b> and <b>factor</b> VIII deficiency in the presence and absence of added <b>factors</b> <b>IX</b> and VIII, and the generation of thrombin activity was monitored. When coagulation is triggered with the high thromboplastin concentrations normally used in clin-ical routine tests, the generation of thrombin activity in plasma of patients with congenital <b>factor</b> <b>IX</b> deficiency before and after reconstitution with purified <b>factor</b> <b>IX</b> appears identical. When, however, coagulation is triggered with low thromboplastin concentrations, a clear dependency of the generation of thrombin activity on the concentration of <b>factor</b> <b>IX</b> becomes evident at <b>factor</b> <b>IX</b> concentrations lower than 30 nM (about 400 /o clotting factor activity). Factor VIII is a compulsory cofactor for this <b>factor</b> <b>IX</b> activity because the prothrombinase activity at optimal <b>factor</b> <b>IX</b> concentration is still critically dependent upon the amount of factor VIII present. The lower the amount of thromboplastin, the higher the importance of <b>factor</b> <b>IX</b> and <b>factor</b> VIII activation in thromboplastin-dependent coagulation.

In the present study we have prepared activated <b>Factor</b> <b>IX</b> by incubating human <b>Factor</b> <b>IX</b> with calcium and Russell's viper venom covalently bound to agarose. Fractionation of the activated <b>Factor</b> <b>IX</b> by high-performance liquid chromatography demonstrated the presence of both Factors IXa alpha and IXa beta.

40|$|<b>Factor</b> <b>IX</b> is a serine {{protease}} {{involved in the}} mammalian blood clotting cascade. An absence of functional <b>factor</b> <b>IX</b> protease in the bloodstream results in Haemophilia B. Mutations in the regulatory region of the <b>factor</b> <b>IX</b> gene can produce a rare form of the disease called Haemophilia B Leyden. Single nucleotide substitutions at positions - 5 and - 6 of the human <b>factor</b> <b>IX</b> promoter, which result in Haemophilia B Leyden, disrupt the binding of an unidentified transcription factor which interacts in the region - 13 to + 3. A group of transcription factors which may interact with the <b>factor</b> <b>IX</b> promoter in this region is called the hepatocyte nuclear factor 1 (HNF 1) family. The aim {{of this research was}} to investigate the potential role of the HNF 1 proteins in the regulation of <b>factor</b> <b>IX</b> promoter gene expression. This study was bipartite, involving research into the ability of the HNF 1 transcription factors to bind the <b>factor</b> <b>IX</b> promoter in vitro, and to regulate the initiation of its transcription. The HNF 1 cDNAs were firstly subcloned into an expression vector suitable for use in mammalian tissue culture. Gel mobility shift assays were employed to examine the binding of the HNF 1 proteins to the wildtype <b>factor</b> <b>IX</b> promoter. The ability of these proteins to bind the <b>factor</b> <b>IX</b> promoter region carrying the - 5 or - 6 mutations was also investigated. Luciferase reporter gene assays using a human hepatoma cell line were used to study the regulatory effects of the HNF 1 transcription factors on transcription from the normal and mutant <b>factor</b> <b>IX</b> promoters. A variant form of the HNF 1 transcription factor was shown to bind to the - 14 to + 6 region of the normal sequence of the <b>factor</b> <b>IX</b> promoter as well as that containing some of the - 5 and - 6 mutations. A protein from rat liver nuclear extracts which displayed an HNFI-like binding activity was delected using gel mobility shift assays with the <b>factor</b> <b>IX</b> promoter region. All forms of the HNF 1 transcription factors could regulate the transcription of a reporter gene driven by the wildtype <b>factor</b> <b>IX</b> promoter. Two forms of the HNF 1 transcription factor down-regulated the wildtype <b>factor</b> <b>IX</b> promoter-reporter gene construct by at least 50 %, while the same construct was up-regulated by a third form of the transcription factor. Unfortunately time constraints resulted in the premature conclusion of planned experimentation. The results generated during this research have been unable to confirm a role for the HNF 1 family in the regulation of the <b>factor</b> <b>IX</b> promoter, but have provided a basis for further research...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe Gladomain {{of human}} <b>factor</b> <b>IX</b> {{contains}} a specific element {{required for the}} binding of <b>factor</b> <b>IX</b> to an endothelial cell surface protein. We have investigated the dependence of this interaction on the structural integrity of the adjacent hydrophobic stack and epidermal growth factor-like domains. The ability of purified natural variants of human <b>factor</b> <b>IX</b> to compete with wild-type <b>factor</b> <b>IX</b> binding to the endothelial cell surface was used to obtain apparent Ki values of the variants. Our {{data suggest that the}} functional integrity of the Gla domain, enabling <b>factor</b> <b>IX</b> to specifically interact with an endothelial cell surface protein, depends on the structural and functional integrity of both the hydrophobic stack domain and the first epidermal growth factor-like domain...|$|R

The patients had detectable (30 % of normal) <b>factor</b> <b>IX</b> antigen. DNA hybridization analysis demonstrated that these patients had a partial intragenic deletion in their <b>factor</b> <b>IX</b> gene. This 2. 8 -kb deletion included exon d and the surrounding sequences. This exon codes for the amino acid sequence from No. 47 through 84 of the <b>factor</b> <b>IX</b> protein and contains its first potential EGF domain; the de novo occurrence of the mutation in the grandfather's germ cells was established by linkage analysis.

40|$|A novel <b>factor</b> <b>IX</b> gene {{mutation}} (<b>factor</b> <b>IX</b> London 2) has been characterized. This causes severe crm+ haemophilia B as the patient's plasma shows normal <b>factor</b> <b>IX</b> antigen level {{and less than}} 1 % clotting activity. Sequence analysis of the entire cloned coding and promoter regions revealed a single point mutation: a G [...] A transition at position 31, 119. This region of the patient's DNA was amplified in vitro by the polymerase chain reaction and the nucleotide change was confirmed by direct sequencing of the amplified products. The mutation results in the substitution of the arginine at position 333 by glutamine. This arginine residue is absolutely conserved in the catalytic domain of normal human and bovine <b>factor</b> <b>IX,</b> X and prothrombin. The substitution by glutamine causes {{the loss of a}} positive charge {{from the surface of the}} <b>factor</b> <b>IX</b> London 2 protein.
