5|$|Although a large {{horse is}} not {{required}} to <b>carry</b> <b>an</b> armoured knight, it is held by some historians that a large horse was desirable to increase the power of a lance strike. However, practical experiments by re-enactors have suggested that the rider's weight and strength is of more relevance than the size of the mount, and that little of the horse's weight is translated to the lance.|$|E
5|$|Commercial {{sex workers}} (including those in pornography) have an {{increased}} rate of HIV. Rough sex can be a factor {{associated with an increased}} risk of transmission. Sexual assault is also believed to <b>carry</b> <b>an</b> increased risk of HIV transmission as condoms are rarely worn, physical trauma to the vagina or rectum is likely, and there may be a greater risk of concurrent sexually transmitted infections.|$|E
5|$|Diving bells are {{required}} to <b>carry</b> <b>an</b> onboard supply of breathing gas for use in emergencies. The cylinders are mounted externally as there is insufficient space inside. They are fully immersed in the water during bell operations, and may be considered diving cylinders.|$|E

5|$|The 2B {{stage of}} the upgrade {{to be carried out}} along the A9 {{includes}} construction of parallel structures at the Mirna Bridge and the Limska Draga Viaduct intended for each to <b>carry</b> <b>an</b> additional carriageway of the motorway.|$|E
5|$|The {{condition}} is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern. In order to inherit it, {{both of the}} parents of an individual must <b>carry</b> <b>an</b> affected gene. Most have no family history of the condition. People with only one abnormal gene are called carriers (heterozygotes) and may have mild, but medically insignificant, abnormalities of copper metabolism.|$|E
5|$|Aquatic beetles use several {{techniques}} for retaining air beneath the water's surface. Diving beetles (Dytiscidae) hold air between the abdomen and the elytra when diving. Hydrophilidae have hairs on their under surface that retain {{a layer of}} air against their bodies. Adult crawling water beetles use both their elytra and their hind coxae (the basal segment of the back legs) in air retention, while whirligig beetles simply <b>carry</b> <b>an</b> air bubble down with them whenever they dive.|$|E

5|$|As well as food, camping equipment, and dog-care gear, mushers must <b>carry</b> <b>an</b> axe, a cold-weather {{sleeping}} bag, {{a pair of}} snowshoes, veterinary records, Quest promotional material, a cooker, {{and eight}} booties per dog. Included in the required promotional material are numerous event covers intended to reflect the Quest's ancestry as a mail route. One unusual rule requires mushers to immediately butcher any game animal killed during the race. This rule was applied in 1993, when a musher was attacked by a moose and killed it to protect himself.|$|E
5|$|Five Vulcans were {{selected}} {{to participate in the}} operation. In order to do so, each aircraft had to receive various last-minute adaptations; including modifications to the bomb bay, the reinstatement of the long out-of-use in-flight refuelling system, the installation of a new navigational system derived from the Vickers VC10, and the updating of several onboard electronics. Underneath the wings, new pylons were fitted to <b>carry</b> <b>an</b> ECM pod and Shrike anti-radar missiles at wing hardpoint locations; these hardpoints had originally been installed for the purpose of carrying the cancelled Skybolt nuclear missile. Engineering work to retrofit these Vulcans had begun on 9 April.|$|E
5|$|For safety, divers {{sometimes}} <b>carry</b> <b>an</b> additional independent scuba cylinder {{with its}} own regulator to mitigate out-of-air emergencies should the primary breathing gas supply fail. For much common recreational diving where a controlled emergency swimming ascent is acceptably safe, this extra equipment is not needed or used. This extra cylinder {{is known as a}} bail-out cylinder, and may be carried in several ways, and can be any size that can hold enough gas to get the diver safely back to the surface.|$|E
50|$|The Nordlander {{normally}} <b>carries</b> <b>a</b> large single {{square sail}} {{with the largest}} boats <b>carrying</b> <b>a</b> topsail. It's {{one of the few}} types of boats that still <b>carries</b> such <b>a</b> sail to the present day.|$|R
25|$|Auxiliary Police {{officers}} in New York City {{are not permitted}} to <b>carry</b> <b>a</b> side arm at any time on duty, even if independently licensed to <b>carry</b> <b>a</b> firearm. In other jurisdictions within New York State, some police departments do allow their Auxiliary Police officers to <b>carry</b> <b>a</b> firearm.|$|R
50|$|In parades {{officers}} and the sergeant major <b>carried</b> <b>a</b> saber, first sergeants <b>carried</b> <b>a</b> carbine, {{two members of the}} color guard carried the American flag and the school flag, the band had their instruments, the troop their horses, and the infantry companies and older day students <b>carried</b> <b>a</b> rifle.|$|R
5|$|Frahm {{anti-roll}} {{tanks were}} fitted during construction, but these {{proved to be}} ineffective; the tanks only reduced rolling by 33%. Bilge keels were later added to improve stability, and the space previously used for the anti-roll tanks was instead used as extra fuel storage. The ship was able to <b>carry</b> <b>an</b> additional 180 t(200 short tons) of coal in the anti-roll tanks. Von der Tanns hull consisted of 15 watertight compartments, and a double bottom extended for 75% of the ship's length. The ship was known to have good maneuvering characteristics, with a speed loss of 60% and a heel of 8degrees at full rudder.|$|E
5|$|Many of the Quest's {{rules are}} {{intended}} to ensure the health of dogs in hazardous conditions. This process begins before the race, when all dogs must be examined by race veterinarians, who certify that the animals are suited and healthy enough to participate. Before the race, dog equipment also must be checked by race officials. Padded harnesses are required, each musher must <b>carry</b> <b>an</b> appropriate amount of food, and additional food supplies must be in position at checkpoints.|$|E
5|$|Originally, the {{standard}} complement of each submarine was six officers and thirty-six sailors, with facilities to <b>carry</b> <b>an</b> additional twelve personnel (usually trainees). This number was minimised by the RAN during design, which insisted that functions be automated where possible; the RAN also requiring that each sailor {{have his own}} rack and {{did not need to}} 'hot bunk'. It was originally intended that multiple ship's companies be established per submarine, and that these be rotated to maximise the submarines' time at sea without adversely affecting personnel, but difficulties in maintaining submariner numbers made this plan unworkable. Enlisted submariners are accommodated in six-bunk cabins.|$|E
5000|$|As Police Chief Stone, Tom Selleck <b>carries</b> <b>a</b> Smith & Wesson Model SW1911SC [...]45 pistol. Selleck is {{a veteran}} soldier (Army National Guard from 1967 to 1973) and a skilled shooter; he {{collects}} firearms. Most of the characters that Selleck has portrayed in television who <b>carry</b> <b>a</b> sidearm have <b>carried</b> <b>a</b> type of Model 1911A1 [...]45 pistol. In the early novels, Stone usually <b>carries</b> <b>a</b> [...]38 Special Smith & Wesson Model 36 snub-nosed revolver; the same firearm which he had used as a homicide detective with the LAPD. (Parker's private detective character Spenser also <b>carried</b> <b>a</b> snub-nosed Smith & Wesson Model 36 [...]38 Special revolver in the first thirteen [...] "Spenser" [...] novels.) In Parker's Killing the Blues, Stone has started <b>carrying</b> <b>a</b> 1911A1 Colt Commander [...]45 pistol.|$|R

5|$|Other funded {{improvements}} to the A-10 fleet include a new data link, the ability to employ smart weapons such as the Joint Direct Attack Munition (JDAM) and Wind Corrected Munitions Dispenser, {{and the ability to}} <b>carry</b> <b>an</b> integrated targeting pod such as the Northrop Grumman LITENING or the Lockheed Martin Sniper Advanced Targeting Pod (ATP). Also included is the Remotely Operated Video Enhanced Receiver (ROVER) to provide sensor data to personnel on the ground.|$|E
5|$|Steam was {{provided}} by 12 Schulz-Thornycroft boilers, each of which had 2 fireboxes, {{for a total of}} 24. The machinery was divided into three engine and six boiler rooms. The wing turrets and their magazines further divided the machinery into three separated groups, thereby increasing survivability. The ships carried 2,700tons of coal, and were later modified to <b>carry</b> <b>an</b> additional 160tons of oil that was to be sprayed on the coal, to increase its burn rate. Electrical power {{was provided}} by eight turbo-generators, producing 1,280kW at 225V.|$|E
5|$|The World of Continent {{is a large}} {{land mass}} ruled by three kings in {{constant}} war for control of their world. They each <b>carry</b> <b>an</b> object needed to open the tower's entrance. The World of Ocean consists of various small islands surrounded by water, each connected by small caves. Pirates roam the sea of this world, forbidding travel by ship. The World of Sky contains large land masses suspended in clouds, and is ruled by a powerful dictator from his flying castle. The World of Ruins is a technologically advanced cityscape, reduced to a post-apocalyptic wasteland by constant monster attacks.|$|E

5|$|The central {{concept of}} natural {{selection}} is the evolutionary fitness of an organism. Fitness is measured by an organism's ability to survive and reproduce, which determines {{the size of its}} genetic contribution to the next generation. However, fitness {{is not the same as}} the total number of offspring: instead fitness is indicated by the proportion of subsequent generations that <b>carry</b> <b>an</b> organism's genes. For example, if an organism could survive well and reproduce rapidly, but its offspring were all too small and weak to survive, this organism would make little genetic contribution to future generations and would thus have low fitness.|$|E
5|$|Thyroid cancers {{are treated}} by {{removing}} the whole or part of thyroid gland. Radioactive Iodine 131 may be given to radioablate the thyroid. Thyroxine is given to replace the hormones lost and to suppress TSH production, as TSH may stimulate recurrence. With {{the exception of the}} rare anaplastic thyroid cancer, which carries a very poor prognosis, most thyroid cancers <b>carry</b> <b>an</b> excellent prognosis and can even be considered curable.|$|E
5|$|Traffic {{conditions}} on the parkway often exceed its intended capacity of 60,000 vehicles per day. Today, some sections <b>carry</b> <b>an</b> average of 100,000 vehicles a day and have bumper-to-bumper traffic conditions during commuting hours. The parkway was planned {{to be one of}} two north-south expressways into downtown Toronto. The other was cancelled due to public opposition, leaving the DVP as the sole north-south expressway into downtown. The parkway is also used by regional transit buses which can access designated lanes to pass slow-moving traffic.|$|E
