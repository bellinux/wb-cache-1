40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the design of}} a novel multipath mitigating ground plane for Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) antennae. Firstly, the concept of a compact low multipath <b>cross</b> <b>plate</b> reflector ground plane (CPRGP) is presented. In comparison to the choke ring and Electromagnetic Band Gap (EBG) ground planes, the proposed CPRGP has compact size, low mass, wide operational bandwidth and simple configuration. The proposed CPRGP is then integrated with a circularly polarized dual-band GNSS antenna in order to assess the multipath mitigating performance over two frequency bands. Measurement results of the proposed CPRGP with GNSS antenna achieves a front to back ratio (FBR) over 25 dB at L 1 (1. 575 GHz) and L 2 (1. 227 GHz) bands and maximum backward cross polarization levels below - 23 dB at both bands. Antenna phase centre variation remains less than 2 mm across both L 1 and L 2 bands. Furthermore, the performance comparison of the proposed CPRGP with the commercially available pinwheel antenna and the shallow corrugated ground plane is presented, showing the advantages of CPRGP for high precision GNSS applications...|$|E
40|$|Multipath {{mitigating}} ground planes for {{dual band}} (L 1 /L 2) global navigation satellite system (GNSS) antennas are proposed. Two novel ground planes; dual band electromagnetic band gap (EBG) ground plane and <b>cross</b> <b>plate</b> reflector ground plane (CPRGP) are presented. The ground planes {{are designed to}} improve the antenna backlobe and cross polarization performance at both L 1 (1. 575 GHz) and L 2 (1. 227 GHz) bands by suppressing the surface wave propagation. In contrast to the conventional corrugated type choke ring ground plane, the proposed ground planes have smaller thickness. The dual band EBG consumes larger space but still {{have the advantage of}} maintaining a low profile and low mass. The CPRGP however has the combined advantage of compact size and performance. The CPRGP ground plane also has low mass, low manufacturing cost and does not require any periodicity. Multipath mitigation performance of both ground planes is compared against the conventional choke ring type corrugated ground plane. Simulation results and multipath rejection ratio (MPR) of the proposed ground planes show that the CPRGP, EBG and choke ring ground planes give similar multipath mitigating performance with CPRGP having an added advantage of compact size...|$|E
40|$|Several beam-combining {{schemes for}} on-axis and {{off-axis}} optical system layout are presented. The on-axis approaches include two <b>crossed</b> <b>plates</b> with dichroic coatings placed at 90 deg, {{with respect to}} each other, and a pentaprism arrangement. The off-axis layout of the cathode ray tubes requires that the images be combined at the display screen. These image-combining approaches are compared for the standard television rates of 525 lines and the high-resolution television at 1200 / 2000 lines under development in Japan. It is concluded that, for the high-performance, high-color fidelity, and high-resolution projection systems, which are expected {{to fit into a}} small volume of space such as a Space Station display or a cockpit panoramic display, a folded configuration with either <b>crossed</b> <b>plates</b> or pentaprism plates will result in an optimum color display...|$|R

40|$|Adler, Howard I. (Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Oak Ridge, Tenn.), and Alice A. Hardigree. Analysis of {{a genetic}} locus {{controlling}} cell division {{and sensitivity to}} radiation in Escherichia coli. J. Bacteriol. 87 : 720 – 726. 1964. —Radiation sensitivity in Escherichia coli is under control of genes that are transferred during conjugation between donor and recipient strains. Conjugation experiments establish {{that one of these}} genes occupies a locus on the E. coli K- 12 linkage map between the genes controlling ability to utilize lactose and galactose. It affects sensitivity to both ionizing and ultraviolet (2, 537 A) radiation. A strain possessing a mutation at this locus fails to show increases in resistance to ionizing radiation during late lag and early log phases, and increases in resistance when grown to stationary phase in a glucose-containing complete medium. The primary effect of the mutation at this locus may be an interference with the mechanism by which cells form cross plates. Cells of the mutant form long, nonseptate filaments when grown after exposure to ionizing radiation. The filaments do not give rise to macrocolonies. Pantoyl lactone, an agent that initiates <b>cross</b> <b>plate</b> formation, allows the filaments to divide normally and produce macrocolonies. When plated after irradiation on complete medium containing pantoyl lactone, the survival of the mutant is greatly increased...|$|E
40|$|There {{is little}} {{agreement}} {{as to the}} manner of division of the cytoplasm of the bacterial cell. This {{may be due to}} the use of different stains, techniques, and organisms. Also, most of the workers did not have the advantages provided by the presence of a stained nucleus to correlate with septum formation. At least one exception was DeLamater (1952) who not only reported a nucleus in a Micrococcus but also published a photograph showing a "cell plate". He failed, however, to indicate its origin. Knaysi (1951) states that "the cytoplasm is divided by inward (centripetal) growth of the cytoplasmic membrane forming a septum or plate across the cytoplasm. " Subsequently, each sister cell deposits its own cross wall in the middle of the <b>cross</b> <b>plate.</b> Bisset (1950) reports that there is a difference in the mechanism of cellular division as regards the rough and smooth types of cells. For the smooth type, he states that "when the cell is about to divide, a transverse septum, derived from the membrane, develops across the middle of the cell. The cell wall is then secreted at the edges of the new septum and grows inwards dividing the cell. " In the division of the rough type of cell, it is stated also that the septum originates from the cell membrane. These are the more recent views on cytokinesis in the bacteria, and a review of the older literature will be omitted.

50|$|That {{season in}} the Association saw Curry make a {{controversial}} call, yet {{it led to the}} institution of an official rule which still lasts to this day. The play in question happened in a game that pitted the Louisville Colonels against the Brooklyn Grays, when during the game, Louisville's Reddy Mack <b>crossed</b> home <b>plate</b> after a teammate had hit safely. After Mack had <b>crossed</b> the <b>plate,</b> he deliberately interfered with Brooklyn's catcher long enough so that two other Colonels had also <b>crossed</b> the <b>plate.</b> Since Mack had prevented the catcher from making any further plays, Curry ruled that the first baserunner after Mack to score was out, and then disallowed the other run that followed. The rules stated, at the time, that a baserunner could not interfere with a fielder, but Mack argued that since he had scored, he was no longer a baserunner, therefore he was not in violation of any rules. Curry's decision, although not in the rules, demonstrated that the evolution of the game's rules sometimes has to be made at the moment to protect the game's integrity. The rule that came from this decision is now Rule 7.09(e).|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{real-time}} seed-metering device performance detection {{is one of}} key {{techniques to}} ensure operation quality of a planter. A <b>crossed</b> E-shape <b>plate</b> capacitance sensor, a parallel-plate capacitance sensor and a differential tri-plate capacitance sensor, are proposed to test corn-seed flow. The detection concept and sensor structure parameters are presented. An adjustable stand is designed to investigate the impact of sensor structure and seed velocity on the outputs of capacitance sensors. The sensitivity and the feasibility of 3 sensors are studied by detecting capacitance variations at different corn-seed speeds. Experimental results show that, with average capacitance variation 0. 1245 pF and 0. 1115 pF, respectively, the <b>crossed</b> E-shape <b>plate</b> sensor and the differential tri-plate sensor are suitable to measure corn-seed metering device performance...|$|R

However, the etiology of ASD is not well known. This study employed mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitor rapamycin to explore its effect on ASD and provided new therapeutic strategies for ASD. ASD rat model was constructed and valproic acid (VPA) was injected intraperitoneally into rats on pregnancy day 12. 5. Offspring from VPA group were divided into ASD group and ASD + rapamycin (ASD + RAPA) group. Compared with normal group, the frequency and duration of social behavior and straight times of ASD group were shortened, but the grooming times were extended. Meanwhile, in ASD group, the average escape latency {{and the frequency of}} <b>crossing</b> <b>plates</b> were decreased, the apoptotic index (AI) detected by TUNEL assay was increased, and the expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl- 2) analyzed was decreased with great difference compared with normal group (P< 0. 01). However, rapamycin treatment in ASD rats mitigated the ASD-like social behavior, such as the frequencies of straight and grooming. Furthermore, rapamycin shortened the average escape latency, but increased the frequency of <b>crossing</b> <b>plates</b> of ASD rats. In hippocampus, rapamycin decreased the AI, but increased the levels of BDNF and Bcl- 2 (P< 0. 01) of ASD rats. These findings revealed that rapamycin significantly mitigated the social behavior by enhancing the expression of BDNF and Bcl- 2 to suppress the hippocampus apoptosis in VPA-induced ASD rats.
