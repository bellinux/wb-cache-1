40|$|Metallic {{multilayered}} structures comprising alternating ferromagnetic and non-ferromagnetic lay-ers exhibit enhanced magnetoresistance values {{compared with}} the magnetoresistance of the in-dividual magnetic layers. The largest <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> <b>resistance</b> are found <b>in</b> sputter-deposited 110 oriented crystalline Co/Cu multilayers in which the Co layers are doped with small amounts of Fe. Values of giant magnetoresistance (GMR) of ∼ 110 % at room temperature and ∼ 220 % at 4. 2 K are found. The origin of the magnetoresistance relates to spin-dependent scattering at the interfaces between the Co and Cu layers. These very large MR values make GMR materi-als attractive {{for a variety of}} applications for which magnetic field sensors are required. Simple exchange-biased sandwich structures (spin-valve sandwiches) are described which exhibit large <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> <b>resistance</b> <b>in</b> very small fields. ...|$|R

25|$|If {{the average}} power {{dissipated}} by a resistor {{is more than}} its power rating, damage to the resistor may occur, permanently altering its resistance; this is distinct from the reversible <b>change</b> <b>in</b> <b>resistance</b> due to its temperature coefficient when it warms. Excessive power dissipation may raise {{the temperature of the}} resistor to a point where it can burn the circuit board or adjacent components, or even cause a fire. There are flameproof resistors that fail (open circuit) before they overheat dangerously.|$|E
2500|$|The {{resistive}} element {{is made from}} a mixture of finely powdered carbon and an insulating material, usually ceramic. [...] A resin holds the mixture together. [...] The resistance {{is determined by the}} ratio of the fill material (the powdered ceramic) to the carbon. [...] Higher concentrations of carbon, which is a good conductor, result in lower resistance. Carbon composition resistors were commonly used in the 1960s and earlier, but are not popular for general use now as other types have better specifications, such as tolerance, voltage dependence, and stress. Carbon composition resistors change value when stressed with over-voltages. Moreover, if internal moisture content, from exposure for some length of time to a humid environment, is significant, soldering heat creates a non-reversible <b>change</b> <b>in</b> <b>resistance</b> value. [...] Carbon composition resistors have poor stability with time and were consequently factory sorted to, at best, only 5% tolerance.|$|E

Eliminates some uncertainties in Wheatstone-bridge resistance-change measurements in flight research.

50|$|Colossal {{magnetoresistance}} (CMR) is {{a property}} of some materials, mostly manganese-based perovskite oxides, that {{enables them to}} dramatically <b>change</b> their electrical <b>resistance</b> <b>in</b> the presence of a magnetic field.

50|$|An {{alternative}} to the Pirani gauge is the thermocouple gauge, which works on the same principle of detecting thermal conductivity of the gas by a change in temperature.

50|$|The {{material}} used in {{the detector}} must demonstrate large <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> <b>resistance</b> {{as a result of}} minute <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> temperature. As the material is heated, due to the incoming infrared radiation, the resistance of the material decreases. This is related to the material's temperature coefficient of resistance (TCR) specifically its negative temperature coefficient. Industry currently manufactures microbolometers that contain materials with TCRs near −2%.|$|R

50|$|In bioelectrical {{impedance}} {{analysis in}} humans, {{an estimate of}} the phase angle can be obtained and is based on <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> <b>resistance</b> and reactance as alternating current passes through tissues, which causes a phase shift.

50|$|A very {{sensitive}} calorimetric sensor {{known as a}} transition edge sensor (TES) takes advantage of superconductivity. Most pure superconductors have a very sharp transition from normal resistivity to superconductivity at some low temperature.

50|$|Linear Heat Detection (LHD) {{cable is}} {{essentially}} a two-core cable terminated by an end-of-line resistor (resistance varies with application). The two cores are separated by a polymer plastic, {{that is designed to}} melt at a specific temperature (commonly 68 °C for building applications), and without which causes the two cores to short.

An unprogrammed polyfuse would be registered as a logical one. These early devices had severe drawbacks like a high programming voltage and unreliability of the programmed devices.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Monitoring Fatigue Damage Behavior of Glass/Epoxy Composites Using Carbon Nanotubes as Sensors Hasna Hena Zamal Carbon {{nanotubes}} {{have been}} used as sensors in glass fiber/epoxy laminates for monitoring damage under fatigue loading. Carbon nanotubes are embedded in epoxy resin. The modified resin is infused between glass fibers to make composites. Silver paste electrodes are deposited {{on the surface of the}} laminate. <b>Changes</b> <b>in</b> electrical <b>resistance</b> are measured along several in-plane and through-thickness positions of the laminate. The <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> <b>resistance</b> are compared with the strain changes measured by strain gages. It is found that the <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> electrical <b>resistance</b> are sensitive to the degradation in the composite laminate. The electrical resistance method is proved to be more reliable in detecting damage in CNT incorporated GFRP composites than strain measurements as it senses the initiation of damage earlier than strain measurement. Among the in-plane and through- thickness resistance response, the through-thickness response can represent the initiation of damages more sensitively and quickly. This technique may be used to provide effective in-situ monitoring of damages in composites. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Major {{depression}} and cardiovascular diseases are 2 {{of the most}} prevalent health problems in Western society, and an association between them is generally accepted. Although the specific mechanism behind this comorbidity remains to be elucidated, {{it is clear that}} it has a complex multifactorial character including a number of neuronal, humoral, immune, and circulatory pathways.
