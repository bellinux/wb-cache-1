50|$|The <b>corkwing</b> wrasse, Symphodus melops, is {{a species}} of wrasse native to the eastern Atlantic Ocean from Norway to Morocco {{and out to the}} Azores, as well as being found in the Mediterranean Sea and the Adriatic Sea. This species can be found in areas of rock or {{eelgrass}} at depths from 1 to 30 m.|$|E
50|$|It {{is highly}} {{variable}} in colour, {{depending on the}} environment and age of the fish. The <b>corkwing</b> wrasse has a black spot {{in the middle of the}} tail stalk, and a comma-shaped spot behind the eye. Females and juveniles tend to be brown or greenish-brown, while the males are typically more brightly coloured. Both sexes have lines on their heads and gill covers which are brown and pale blue in the female, and bright green or blue in the male.|$|E
50|$|Some ichthyofauna species, such as anchovy, garfish, Black Sea whiting and pickerel, {{visit the}} Sea of Azov from the Black Sea for spawning.

Unlike the Black Sea plankton which does not adapt well to the low salinity of the Sea of Azov and concentrates near the Kerch Strait, fishes and invertebrates of the Black Sea adjust well.

40|$|The use of wrasse (Labridae) as cleanerfish in salmonid {{aquaculture}} is {{the only}} method for removal of salmon lice {{that does not have}} any negative impact on the environment. The use of wild-caught wrasse has increased {{during the past few years}} due to increasing problems with salmon lice developing resistance to chemotherapeutica. The use of wrasse is not ethically acceptable, due to a continuous loss of wrasse in the salmon farms, resulting in an unacceptably high use of wrasse. One of the species used is the <b>corkwing</b> wrasse (Symphodus melops). Previous studies indicate that this species is susceptible to disease caused by Vibrio bacteria. Detection of Vibrio tapetis (LP 2) in Norwegian <b>corkwing</b> wrasse was the first detection of this bacterium in fish and the first detection in Norway. In this Master thesis, V. tapetis LP 2 was used in a series of challenge experiments with wild-caught <b>corkwing</b> wrasse. In addition to LP 2, two other V. tapetis strains from clams were used; the reference strain CECT 4600 from Manila clams (Ruditapes philippinarum) in France and NRP 45, from Manila clams introduced in Norway. Three experiments were performed: <b>Corkwing</b> wrasse were challenged with three doses of LP 2 by bath challenge and intraperitonal injections in order to choose the better challenge method. The results were not consistent, but bath challenge with > 106 CFU x ml- 1 was considered a reliable method, and applied in the following experiments. The next experiment was performed in order to study the effect of increasing temperature on LP 2 challenge. Fish were challenged with 107 CFU x ml- 1 at 6, 9, 12 and 15 °C respectively. The results revealed a trend of increased mortality at increasing temperatures, and a significantly higher mortality was measured at 15 °C than at 6 °C. In the third experiment, fish was challenged with LP 2, CECT 4600 and NRP 45. LP 2 was re-isolated from dead fish, whereas the other two strains were not. V. tapetis was also isolated from fish that were challenged with CECT 4600 and NRP 45. The results show that V. tapetis may be pathogenic to <b>corkwing</b> wrasse, but mortality was however not higher in the LP 2 challenged groups than in the other groups. Other fish that died during the experiment died due to infections with other Vibrio spp, and revealed the same pathology as LP 2 infected fish. The results indicate that <b>corkwing</b> wrasse carry Vibrios, and that in particular V. tapetis and V. splendidus strains may cause disease when <b>corkwing</b> wrasse are kept in captivity. Experiments were carried out from June until September. Comparing the results from the different experiments, we found a high mortality of females caught during the spawning season, and the catch of <b>corkwing</b> wrasse should thus be avoided in this period. The results presented in this thesis may be used as a background for further studies of bacterial diseases of wild caught wrasse, improve wrasse welfare and move us a step further on the way to obtain a sustainable use of wrasse as cleaner fish in the growing salmonid aquaculture...|$|E
40|$|Selective harvesting, {{where some}} {{individuals}} are actively targeted or possess phenotypes rendering them {{more vulnerable to}} capture, is inevitably happening in all commercial and recreational fisheries. Selective harvesting may affect reproduction and recruitment and cause fisheries induced evolution, potentially reducing fisheries yield and resilience to environmental change. Several species of wrasse (Labridae) are now being harvested as cleaner fish to reduce salmon lice-infestations in Norwegian aquaculture. The fisheries are regulated by minimum size limits are presuably sizeselective, but {{they may also be}} sex-selective since these wrasses exhibits sexual size dimorphism. In this thesis, I focus on life history traits of <b>corkwing</b> and goldsinny wrasse {{in the context of a}} growing, selective fishery in southern Norway. Specifically, my goals were to: 1) Study spatial and sexual variation in life history traits in <b>corkwing</b> (Symphodus melops) and goldsinny wrasse (Ctenolabrus rupestris) and elucidate the underlying processes producing such variation. 2) Estimate size and sex selectivity in the <b>corkwing</b> wrasse fishery and assess the effects of fishing on population parameters of <b>corkwing</b> and goldsinny and 3), evaluate the current management and fishing practice in a selective harvesting perspective. In Paper I, we show that sexual dimorphism of <b>corkwing</b> wrasse is more male biased in populations further north on the western coast of Norway. The size limit is therefore selective against males who builds nests and provide parental care. In Paper II; we further explore the male selective fishery in a tagging experiment, finding that the nesting males have higher vulnerability for being captured in the fishery, independent of body size. It is also shown that a small marine protected area reduces fishing mortality, but have similar sex selectivity as the fished site. In Paper III, we assessed the effect of four MPAs on <b>corkwing</b> and goldsinny populations in Skagerrak, finding that MPAs, relative to control areas, have higher abundance of both species and older and larger <b>corkwing,</b> but no consistent differences for goldsinny. Paper IV further explores goldsinny individual growth rate variability in the same four MPA-control pairs. No MPA effect was detected, but there were indications of growth rates being negatively affected by local population density and abundance of Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua), a wrasse predator. I have shown that the fishery and the current regulations promote selective harvesting of wrasse at different levels which has implications for management. Some specific advices are proposed: For <b>corkwing,</b> introducing a slot size limit (protecting both small and large fish) can protect nesting males and females in more equal proportions. A slot size limit should also be beneficial for goldsinny, which as a considerably longer life span and is therefore more prone for truncated natural age distribution as a consequence of size-selective fishing. Moreover, slot limits are likely to reduce selection for slow growth and ensure a more balanced exploitation of populations with different growth rates. Further, I suggest increasing the number of marine protected areas. The results of paper II and III show that MPAs can be effective as a management tool for wrasse, especially considering that these species exhibit high site fidelity and fine-scaled variability in life history traits...|$|E
40|$|Two vibrio {{bacteria}} pathogenic to the <b>corkwing</b> wrasse Symphodus melops were isolated. Vibriosis-inducing strain LP 1 {{was isolated}} as the dominanting bacterium in kidney samples of dead and moribund wrasse from a population suffering vibriosis and high daily mortality in 1998 on the Norwegian west coast. The other vibriosis-inducing strain, LP 2, was isolated from wrasse captured the following year. Re-infection experiments {{have confirmed that}} these strains cause vibriosis in <b>corkwing</b> wrasse. Both strains were typical vibrios sharing the traits of fermentative Gram-negative curved rods with motility and a positive oxidase reaction. Detailed biochemical and genetic characterisation revealed a close affiliation to known species of the marine environment. The first isolate, LP 1, {{is a form of}} the ubiquitous seawater organism Vibrio splendidus, while the second isolate, LP 2, is closely related to V. tapetis (previously only known as the brown ring disease agent in clams).

40|$|One {{mechanism}} by which marine organisms may respond to climate shifts is range shifts. The <b>corkwing</b> wrasse (Symphodus melops) is a temperate fish species, inhabiting the coasts of Europe, that show strong indications of current as well as historical (ice-age) range shifts towards the north. Nine neutral microsatellite DNA markers were screened to study genetic signatures and spatial population structure over the entire geographic and thermal gradient of the species from Portugal to Norway. A major genetic break (F ST  =  0. 159 average among pairs) was identified between Scandinavian and more southern populations, with a marked reduction (30 % or more) in levels of genetic variability in Scandinavia. The break is probably related to bottleneck(s) associated with post-glacial colonization of the Scandinavian coasts, and indicates a lack of present gene flow across the North Sea. The lack of gene flow can most likely {{be attributed to the}} species' need for rocky substrate for nesting and a relatively short pelagic larval phase, limiting dispersal by ocean currents.

40|$|Many toxic {{xenobiotics}} {{entering into}} the aquatic environment exert their effects through redox cycling. Oxidative stress, incorporating both antioxidant defences {{as well as}} oxidative damage, is a common effect in organisms exposed to xenobiotics in their environment. The studies included in this dissertation evaluate the effects {{of different types of}} environmental pollution on oxidative stress biomarkers in teleost fishes. Effects of aging, alone or in combination with oxidative stress, on protein carbonylation were also addressed. Antioxidant enzyme activities were measured in rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) caged in a river polluted by sewage treatment plant (STP) effluent as well as highly contaminated sediment, and in <b>corkwing</b> wrasse (Symphodus melops) collected at heavy metal contaminated and PAH contaminated sites. Antioxidant enzymes showed very few changes in these fish. Glutathione levels were affected by STP effluent exposure in rainbow trout and by PAH exposure in <b>corkwing</b> wrasse. Protein carbonylation was elevated in plasma of the <b>corkwing</b> wrasse captured at the heavy metal site and in plasma of rainbow trout caged near the STP effluent. Lipid peroxidation was elevated in the livers of these rainbow trout. Oxidative damage biomarkers were also measured in eelpout (Zoarces viviparus) captured in a polluted harbor, before, during and after a dredging campaign, as well as following an oil spill. Protein carbonyl levels in livers of eelpout were affected by exposure to pollution in the harbor, though this was measured both as increases and as decreases, indicating a complicated relationship between prooxidant exposure and protein carbonyl accumulation. Lipid peroxidation in eelpout was unaffected by pollutant exposure. Western blot analyses of protein carbonylation in <b>corkwing</b> wrasse exposed to heavy metals and in rainbow trout exposed to paraquat (PQ) suggest that albumin may be the plasma protein most likely to undergo carbonylation in these fish. Brown trout (Salmo trutta) were used in a laboratory study to investigate the effects of aging on oxidative stress parameters, i. e. protein carbonylation, 20 S proteosome activity and glutathione levels. All parameters were affected by aging, as was the response to PQ exposure, where 1 year old fish were more sensitive than 0 + fish. To conclude, the results presented here indicate that antioxidant enzymes may not provide a good biomarker of exposure to xenobiotics in the field. However, oxidative damage products, i. e. protein carbonyls and lipid peroxidation, seem to be useful as biomarkers. Care should be taken to consider age of the exposed individuals. Oxidative stress is a complex phenomenon to measure in the field. Antioxidant enzyme activities may be altered after an acute exposure and then return to normal levels but damage products can persist even after the initial stress has stabilized...|$|E

40|$|Several {{species of}} wrasse (Labridae) {{are used as}} cleaner fish to remove salmon lice from farmed Atlantic salmon. We {{estimated}} the fishery and use of wrasse in Hardangerfjord. The estimated numbers of labrids used on salmon and rainbow trout farms varied between 86, 000 and 251, 000 from 2002 – 2006, but increased {{to as much as}} 1. 1 million in 2009 and 2010. A total of 93, 500 kg (around 1. 54 million) labrids were reported landed during 2000 – 2010. <b>Corkwing</b> wrasse (Symphodus melops) was by far the most important wrasse species: 52 % by weight and 56 % by number. Ballan wrasse (Labrus bergylta) made up 34 % by weight but only 14 % by number (due to its larger size). The relative proportion of species between the different sampling locations in the fjord was significantly different, as was the condition factor of some species. Goldsinny wrasse (Ctenolabrus rupestris) had the slowest growth of the labrids in this study, and did not reach the minimum commercial catch size (11 cm) before they were 4 – 5 years old. Very few goldsinny caught were over that size. <b>Corkwing</b> reach commercial size in 1 – 2 years. The results {{of this study indicate that}} wrasse should be protected during the spawning season. Species such as goldsinny grow so slowly that they will most likely be collected several times in heavily fished areas but discarded because they are smaller than the minimum allowable size. This could be avoided through the use of modified traps with escape routes for undersized fish. This study represents a first step towards establishing a knowledge-based management plan for the wrasse fishery...|$|E
40|$|Over {{the past}} few years there has been a rapid {{increase}} in the use of wrasses as cleanerfish for sealice on salmon farms. During 2010, the landed catch of wrasse was 440 tons, more than twice the 2009 catch and nearly ten times the 2008 catch. This rapid and exrteme increase in the fishing pressure on these species has occurred despite very limited knowledge of their biology, ecology and population dynamics. This has led to justifiable concern about the sustainibility of this resource. Wrasse demonstrate specialized life history traits. Many species change sex during their lifetime and exhibit species-specific mating behaviour, including nest building and parental care of eggs. This mating strategy lends to limited dispersal of offspring, ond only goldsinny wrasse have pelagic eggs. Many adult individuals are stationary, thereby creating a population struction dominated by Iocal populations. This population structure is also documented through genetic sludies in <b>corkwing</b> and goldsinny wrasse. Small local populations are more vulnerable to overfishing and possible extinction of local genetic adaptations. Studies of growth of wild wrasse demonstrate that goldsinsy and rock cook grow slower than <b>corkwing.</b> This suggests that the first two will take longer to recover from heavy fishing pressure. Results presented here suggest that both the composition of species and the size distribution; vary between habitats, particularly between exposed and sheltered areas.

Here, we investigate sex- and size-selectivity of the fishery for <b>corkwing</b> wrasse (Symphodus melops) in Western Norway. The males that build and guard nests (nesting males) grow faster than females and sneaker males. <b>Corkwing</b> wrasse were tagged (n[*]=[*] 1057) during (May–June) and after (July) the spawning period in 2014 within a no-take site and in a nearby site open for fishing. We monitored the fishery within and nearby the tagging sites from June to October and sampled recaptures on all commercial fishing trips. Fishing mortality was higher for nesting males than for females (open site; tagged during spawning: 36 % vs. 29 %; after spawning: 49 % vs. 36 %) and {{was found to be}} caused by nesting males having higher capture probabilities than females, independently of body size. The fishing mortality of sneaker males did not differ from nesting males, but the sample of sneaker males in the study was small. The probability of being retained by fishers once captured depended on size, but not on sex. The small no-take site reduced fishing mortality, and the sex- and size-selectivity was similar to the open site. By demonstrating the capture process to be male-selective in a commercial fishery, our study highlights the importance of assessing sex-selectivity in similar fisheries. If detected, management measures protecting the sexes more equally should be implemented, such as slot-size limits and marine-protected areas large enough to account for sexual differences in spatial behaviour.

40|$|The salmonid {{industry}} in Norway has grown exponentially. The greatest cost and {{danger to the}} salmonid industry are ectoparasitic sea lice (Lepeophtheirus salmonis). Sea lice attach to salmon causing damage and increasing health risks. Wrasse (Family: Labridae) provide a possible solution. Wrasse, specifically ballan, <b>corkwing,</b> goldsinny, and rock cook, are cleaner fish. They can be released into sea pens and will eat the sea lice off the salmon. This has been highly effective against sea lice. As a result wrasse have gone from a worthless fish (bony and not particularly tasty) to a highly desired multi-million kroner fishery. The growth of the fishery raises serious concerns. As a result of wrasse being unimportant until recently little information is known about them, including their reproductive habits. To provide further information regarding spawning and the stock of wrasse this project was developed to study the four economically important wrasse: ballan, <b>corkwing,</b> goldsinny, and rock cook. Over the space of two months in the spring/summer of 2014 I regularly participated in fishing expeditions with wrasse fisherman and research staff. The goal was {{to get a picture}} of the wrasse stock in Sunnhordaland and multiple sites were targeted. Data were collected in Austevoll (21 dates), Os (2 dates) and Sveio (3 dates). These 26 separate trips produced 4985 wrasse that were catalogued at sea. Of these, a sub-sample of 818 were euthanized and taken to the lab for analysis. Data on place, date, length, sex (when possible), and spawning behavior were collected on all fish observed in the field. There were a number of analyses done with the primary interest being first to accurately map the spawning patterns across the summer and to see how spawning behavior differed by species, size (length), across time and place, and by sex. The second dependent variable considered was sexual maturity. Most of these analyses required using the laboratory facilities for the sub-sample brought to the Institute for Marine Research in Austevoll. In the laboratory these 818 fish were dissected to extract the gonads to determine both sex and whether the individual was sexually mature. Furthermore otolith dating was used to determine the age of each individual fish. The spring of 2014 was warmer than average so spawning had already started for most species by the time I started collecting data in early May. Broadly speaking the data show spawning rising throughout May and into June, but then tapering off near the end of June and into July. As such the opening of the 2015 wrasse season for test fishing on July 1 st seems appropriate. In looking at the individual fish the patterns are largely consistent with the literature. There were some findings, however, that indicate there may be some stress on the stock. Chief among these were findings that both <b>corkwing</b> wrasse and goldsinny were noticeably smaller in size at maturity than what was predicted by the literature...|$|E
40|$|Wild-caught wrasse {{is used as}} {{cleaner fish}} to reduce sea lice infestations in salmonid {{aquaculture}} in Norway.

Fourteen fishermen participated in an experimental fishery in June 2016. Pots with 25 mm gaps achieved an average catch consisting of 81 % ballan wrasse of the total catch of target wrasse species.

40|$|<b>Corkwing</b> wrasse (Symphodus melops) is a {{temperate}} wrasse displaying both sex {{and male}} dimorphism and is targeted in a size selective commercial fishery which {{has increased dramatically}} since 2008. Wrasses are supplied alive to salmon farms as cleaner fish to combat infestations of Salmon lice. In previous studies, growth and maturation {{has been found to}} differ among male morphs and sexes and these groups might therefore be targeted unevenly by the size selective fishery. In the present study, we address this by comparing size regulations and fishing practice with data on sex specific growth and maturation from Western and Southern Norway, two regions varying in density and life histories. Two years of field data on density and length measures was used together with a subsample of otoliths to determine sex specific growth patterns. In the region with high density, nesting males were found to grow faster and mature later than sneaker males and females. Here, most nesting males will reach the minimum size as juveniles, one and two years before females and sneakers respectively. In contrast, sexual dimorphism was much less pronounced in the low density region, and relaxed male-male competition over nesting sites seems a likely explanation for this pattern. Intensive harvesting with selective removal of the larger nesting males could potentially lead to short term effect such as sperm limitation and reduced offspring survival and thus affect the productivity of juveniles.

Two sites were on the Island of Tysnes, south of Bergen. Surviving adult Manila clams were recovered in 1995 and 1996. In the present study, Manila clams from the original seeding that displayed morphological signs of brown ring disease (BRD) were recovered in June 2003 (n = 7) and in June 2004 (n = 17). Samples from extrapallial fluid, tissues and haemolymph were inoculated on marine agar. Replicate subcultures on selective media were used to select potential Vibrio tapetis strains, and in total, 190 bacterial strains were isolated. One of these strains clustered within the V tapetis clade and was named NRP 45. DNA:DNA hybridisation with the type strain CECT 4600 showed 52. 7 and 57. 3 % DNA:DNA similarity. Hybridisation of NRP 45 and the V tapetis LP 2 strain, isolated from <b>corkwing</b> wrasse Symphodus melops, produced 46. 6 and 44. 4 % re-association. Partial gene segments encoding 16 S rRNA, gyrase B protein (GyrB) and chaperonin 60 protein (Cpn 60) were characterised and compared to CECT 4600. NRP 45 showed 5 differences in the 1416 nucleotides (nt) of the 16 S rRNA encoding gene (99. 6 % similarity), while the GyrB encoding gene had 62 substitutions of 1181 nt compared (94. 8 % similarity) and the Cpn 60 encoding gene had 22 substitutions out of 548 nt compared (96 % similarity). This is the first finding of BRD and the first isolation of a V. tapetis-like bacterial strain from a bivalve in Norway...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{studies have}} shown that {{harvesting}} wild population may exert direct selection on growth rate independently of size, as fast growth and correlated behaviour traits may increase the probability of being captured in fisheries. Harvesting on species with sexual dimorphism in growth can therefore be selective against the faster growing sex. This hypothesis was tested in a commercial fishery of a species with males growing faster than females, the <b>corkwing</b> wrasse (Symphodus melops). We conducted a mark recapture experiment during the spawning period and throughout the commercial fishing season to study mortality and fine scaled movement patterns in Austevoll, Western Norway. In total, 1368 individuals were marked with passive integrated transponder tags in a protected and heavily fished area in close proximity. 293 fish were recorded captured in the commercial fishery, and fate (retained/discarded) and capture coordinates registered by onboard scientific personnel. Together with an additional 795 recaptures registered in scientific sampling, we used this dataset to estimate sex specific natural and fishing mortality and movement. We found that fishing affected nesting males more than females and female mimicking males combined; direct observed commercial capture of tagged fish was 42 % and 31 % of the respective sex classes. Both capture probability in the fishery and growth rates decreased significantly with body size for both sexes. Survival was also influenced by discard of smaller fish and selection on body size was significantly disruptive in nesting males and negatively linear in females. Our results align with expectations from the growth rate selection hypothesis and demonstrate size independent sexual differences in harvest selection in a wild populatio...|$|E
40|$|The use of wrasse (Pisces: Labridae) as {{cleaner fish}} to combat infections with the {{parasitic}} copepods Lepeophtheirus salmonis (Kroyer) and Caligus elongatus (Nordmann) (sea-lice) {{in the culture}} of Salmo salar L. (Atlantic salmon) is now common. Infections with these parasites has caused considerable losses in the industry since its formative years. The use of the wrasse species Ctenolabrus rupestris (L.) (goldsinny), Centrolabrus exoletus (L.) (rockcook), Symphodus melops (= Crenilabrus melops) (L.) (<b>corkwing)</b> and Labrus mixtus L. (cuckoo) as cleaner fish was first suggested in 1988. The use of these species in the industry is now widespread in Scotland, Ireland and Norway. The fish used are normally caught from the wild before being stocked with S. salar smolts during their first year at sea. The fish are routinely collected from waters close to the farm sites to be stocked. As most of the S. salar sea production sites in Scotland are located on the west coast of the country, the wrasse to be used in these sites are normally collected from these waters. The movement of wild fish into farm pens presents a risk of disease transfer from wrasse to S. salar and vice versa. Prior to their use as cleaner fish, these four species of wrasse had received little attention as subjects of scientific study. As a result, there was very little information available in the literature regarding their diseases. The present study was undertaken to investigate the potential pathogens present in wild populations in Scottish coastal waters, and, in particular, which of these pathogens, if any, could be transmitted to the S. salar. The study also investigated the susceptibility of wrasse to the two major viral diseases of S. salar to which they would be exposed in pens. In order to fully assess the pathogenicity of the potential disease agents under farm conditions, it was first necessary to establish the normal morphology of the wrasse species. Hence, a study of the morphological features of wrasse, with particular emphasis on those features important in the health of the fish was undertaken. Wrasse were shown to differ in many aspects from salmonids but shared many morphological features with other perciforme fish. Major differences from salmonids were evident in the skin, fins, pancreas, intestine, gonads and heart. There were also aspects of their morphology which differed from other perciforme fish, notably the structure of the heart. These features were regarded to be adaptations to the specific demands of their feeding strategies and habitats. This study was {{the first of its kind}} undertaken for wrasse and showed some early contraindications for the use of wrasse in culture; most notable was the marked lipid accumulation in, and resultant degeneration of, the liver resulting from the consumption of high energy S. salar feeds. Once the normal morphological features were established, it was possible to examine the disease status of wrasse. Wild fish were sampled from three different locations on the west coast of Scotland. These sites were all geographically distinct and were all used as sources of wrasse for the S. salar farming industry. Samples of wrasse were also obtained from farm sites supplied with wrasse from these wild sites, and an additional number of other geographically distinct farm locations. As a comparison wrasse were also obtained from a wrasse captive breeding facility and another captive location unrelated to the S. salar industry, a public aquarium. The fish from all of these sampling sites were examined fully for the presence of parasites, bacteria and, in some cases, viruses. Histological examination was also carried out on all of the fish studied. A total of 24 new parasite host records, and two tentative ones, were recorded from the four wrasse species studied. These new parasite records included protozoa, digeneans, nematodes and crustacea. Parasite infections were found to vary in prevalence, abundance and intensity in respect to the geographical characteristics of sampling sites and also the length of time spent in S. salar pens. It was concluded that the separation of wrasse from their natural diet and habitat influenced the degree of parasitism. None of the parasites found to infect wrasse were observed to cause any significant pathology in their hosts other than localised tissue responses. The possibility of transfer of wrasse parasites to S. salar was also investigated experimentally in a series of infections in which parasites dissected from wrasse were introduced to S. salar smolts by means of a novel gavage method. None of the parasites used established in the S. salar, indicating that there is little risk of transfaunation of parasites between wrasse and S. salar. However, this aspect requires further work due to the low number of parasites available and the subsequent low numbers of S. salar infected. Bacterial isolates were obtained from wrasse held in S. salar pens but were not found in any of the fish collected from the wild. Most of the bacterial strains isolated would normally be considered as opportunistic pathogens of fish. It was concluded that the relatively high levels of stress, both environmental and physical, that wrasse are subjected to under farm conditions were instrumental in the number of bacterial infections seen in wrasse. Only one pathogenic bacterial infection was seen in any of the fish sampled. This was an isolate of Aeromonas salmonicida, the agent known to cause the disease furunculosis, isolated from a wrasse obtained from one of the farm samples. Other authors have reported that this bacterium has already caused substantial losses of wrasse under farm conditions. It was concluded that Aeromonas salmonicida will prove to be a major pathogen of wrasse held in S. salar pens. No viruses wereI isolated from any of the wrasse studied. The susceptibility of wrasse to the most significant pathogens of S. salar under farm conditions was also subjected to investigation. In addition to sea-lice infection, the industry lists Infectious Pancreatic Necrosis (IPN) and Pancreas Disease (PD) as of primary importance for further research. Both of these diseases cause substantial losses in the industry. The susceptibility of wrasse to both of these disease conditions was investigated by means of experimental infections. In the case of IPN wrasse were infected by bathing with two different infective doses, a low dose which would be expected to induce the disease in S. salar parr and a second dose substantially higher than the first. The C. rupestris used were found to be susceptible to IPN. The wrasse developed some of the pathological characteristics typical of the disease in S. salar, however, other pathological signs were peculiar to wrasse. The recovery rate from the disease seen in wrasse was far more rapid than that recorded from S. salar. Shedding of the virus in the faeces of infected C. rupestris was also demonstrated. This study has illustrated for the first time the susceptibility of wrasse to IPN and that they can shed the virus in their faeces. This suggests that infected wrasse could be a source of continual reinfection in an affected sea site. Experimental infections of C. rupestris with PD followed a standard protocol for the reproduction of the disease in S. salar. Infection was by means of intraperitoneal injection with putatively infective material obtained from S. salar affected with PD. Two infection doses were used, the lowest dose used had been proven to be effective in inducing the disease in S. salar parr while the second dose, ten times higher than the first, had been shown to be effective in reproducing PD in S. salar smolts. The C. rupestris infected did not develop any of the typical signs of the disease seen in S. salar. It was, therefore, concluded that wrasse were not susceptible to PD. The implications of the findings of the study on the continual use of wrasse in the production of S. salar is discussed and suggestions for further research are made...|$|E
