5|$|There {{is little}} {{scientific}} {{evidence of the}} effectiveness or safety of Aloe vera extracts for either cosmetic or medicinal purposes. A research study finding positive evidence is frequently <b>contradicted</b> <b>by</b> other studies.|$|E
5|$|Earlier ornithologists {{felt that}} the kakapo {{might be related to}} the ground parrots and night parrot of Australia due to their similar colouration, but this is <b>contradicted</b> <b>by</b> recent studies; rather, the cryptic colour seems to be {{adaptation}} to terrestrial habits that evolved twice convergently.|$|E
5|$|Critics {{included}} Kitty Kelley, who falsely {{alleged that}} during the Second World War Elizabeth did not abide by the rationing regulations. This, however, was <b>contradicted</b> <b>by</b> the official records, and Eleanor Roosevelt during her wartime stay at Buckingham Palace reported expressly on the rationed food served in the Palace and the limited bathwater that was permitted.|$|E

50|$|In August and September, 1987, Doris Schöttler-Boll had a noted solo {{exhibition}} at the Landesmuseum Bonn (the main {{museum of modern art}} in Bonn, then the capital of West Germany). The exhibition, entitled Dekonstruktionen oder vom Widersprechen in Bildern (Dekonstructions or <b>Contradicting</b> <b>by</b> way of images), was curated by Professor Klaus Honnef, an art historian focused on photo art / art photography.|$|R

5|$|Fictional {{accounts}} sometimes {{portray the}} rebelling slaves as ancient Roman freedom fighters, struggling {{to change a}} corrupt Roman society and to end the Roman institution of slavery. Although this is not <b>contradicted</b> <b>by</b> classical historians, no historical account mentions {{that the goal of}} the rebel slaves was to end slavery in the Republic, nor do any of the actions of rebel leaders, who themselves committed numerous atrocities, seem specifically aimed at ending slavery.|$|E
5|$|The abortion–breast cancer {{hypothesis}} {{posits that}} having an induced abortion {{can increase the}} risk of getting breast cancer. This hypothesis is at odds with mainstream scientific opinion and is <b>contradicted</b> <b>by</b> major medical professional organizations. In early pregnancy, hormone levels increase, leading to breast growth. The hypothesis proposes that if this process is interrupted by an abortion then more immature cells could be left behind, resulting in a greater potential risk of breast cancer over time.|$|E
5|$|This {{indicates}} {{the existence of}} two groups: Lucius Gellius Publicola eventually attacked Crixus {{and a group of}} some 30,000 followers who are described as being separate from the main group under Spartacus. Plutarch describes the desire of some of the escaped slaves to plunder Italy, rather than escape over the Alps. While this factional split is not <b>contradicted</b> <b>by</b> classical sources, there {{does not seem to be}} any direct evidence to support it.|$|E
50|$|Multiple-factor models <b>contradict</b> CAPM <b>by</b> {{claiming}} {{that some other}} factors can influence return, therefore one may find two stocks (or funds) with equal beta, but one {{may be a better}} investment.|$|R

40|$|This {{is the law}} {{of nature}} {{that people have to}} live and play with hazards and to some extent {{insurance}} policy can free people from those frustrations. Even if this is true, people of Bangladesh still don't prefer to insure themselves. One may think that the people of Bangladesh are risk lover; on the other hand other may <b>contradict</b> <b>by</b> saying that their low purchasing power doesn't permit them to avail insurance policy. This paper will highlight those issues relating to non popularity of insurance companies in Bangladesh. To find marketing side problems, Gap-model of service marketing will be fitted to the insurance industry of Bangladesh...|$|R
5|$|While Jenner was alive, {{very few}} people knew of him, {{and the effects of}} his evangelism were largely unrecognised. After his death, however, stories about his evangelism {{circulated}} widely. Stories of his evangelistic activities generated a largely oral tradition, and elements of some stories contradicted others. Many storytellers said that Jenner was small in stature and that he had white hair; this description is <b>contradicted</b> <b>by</b> interviews with family members.|$|E
5|$|Amargasaurus was quadrupedal (moved on four legs), and {{probably}} {{was unable to}} rear on its hind legs. Salgado and Bonaparte (1991) suggested that Amargasaurus was a slow walker, as both the forearms and lower legs were proportionally short, as a feature common to slow-moving animals. This was <b>contradicted</b> <b>by</b> Gerardo Mazzetta and Richard Fariña (1999), who argued that Amargasaurus was capable of rapid locomotion. During locomotion, leg bones are strongly affected by bending moments, representing a limiting factor for the maximum speed of an animal. The leg bones of Amargasaurus were even more sturdy than those of today's white rhinoceros, which is adapted to galloping.|$|E
5|$|Ammianus {{is silent}} about archers on the Alamanni side. The Germans almost {{certainly}} did not have mounted archers, as this was an arm that evolved in the East and in any case, their longbows are unsuitable for use on horseback. As for the infantry, the archery capability of the Rhine Germans has traditionally been seen as negligible, due to the 6th-century writer Agathias's comment that the Franks {{did not know how}} to use bows. But this is <b>contradicted</b> <b>by</b> the archaeological record and by Ammianus himself in other parts of his account. It is virtually certain that there were a significant number of Alamanni foot archers at Strasbourg.|$|E

50|$|Mani the parakeet of Singapore {{became famous}} for {{correctly}} predicting {{the results of}} all four quarter-final matches. Mani <b>contradicted</b> Paul <b>by</b> picking the Netherlands to win the final, resulting in some media outlets describing the game as an octopus-versus-parakeet showdown.|$|R
60|$|Hence, {{throughout}} the picture, {{the expression of}} space and size is dependent upon obscurity, united with, or rather resultant from, exceeding fulness. We destroy both space and size, either by the vacancy, which affords us no measure of space, or by the distinctness, which gives us a false one. The distance of Poussin, having no indication of trees, nor of meadows, nor of character of any kind, may be fifty miles off, or may be five; we cannot tell--we have no measure, and in consequence, no vivid impression. But a middle distance of Hobbima's involves a contradiction in terms; it states a distance by perspective, which it <b>contradicts</b> <b>by</b> distinctness of detail.|$|R
5|$|De re militari, a {{treatise}} on Roman military affairs by Vegetius, a late 4th or early 5th-century writer, contains considerable {{information on the}} late army, although its {{focus is on the}} army of the Republic and Principate. However, Vegetius (who wholly lacked military experience) is often unreliable. For example, he stated that the army abandoned armour and helmets in the later 4th century (offering the absurd explanation that this equipment was too heavy), which is <b>contradicted</b> <b>by</b> sculptural and artistic evidence. In general, it is not safe to accept a statement from Vegetius unless it is corroborated by other evidence.|$|E
5|$|In {{a seminar}} at the Woodrow Wilson Institute on May 20, 2009, {{and based on}} an {{extensive}} analysis of the Vassiliev notebooks taken from the KGB archives, John Earl Haynes, Harvey Klehr, and Alexander Vassiliev concluded that Oppenheimer never was involved in espionage for the Soviets. The KGB tried repeatedly to recruit him, but were never successful. Allegations that he had spied for the Soviets are unsupported, and in some instances, <b>contradicted</b> <b>by</b> voluminous KGB and Venona documentation released {{after the fall of}} the Soviet Union. In addition, he had several persons removed from the Manhattan project who had sympathies to the Soviet Union.|$|E
5|$|In the 1990s, the National Board of Antiquities {{claimed the}} relic {{as its own}} {{on the basis of}} the Finnish law on ancient objects, though it was <b>contradicted</b> <b>by</b> the Lutheran Cathedral Parish of Turku. However, the Board {{ultimately}} had the relic relocated to the Cathedral of Saint Henry in Helsinki, the oldest church in the modern Catholic Diocese of Finland, because Catholics still actively venerate the relic as sacred. Since then, it has been located inside the altar of the Catholic cathedral.|$|E
5000|$|Early {{linguists}} {{and observers}} of the language considered it to be either a separate language or a dialect of Sinhalese.

40|$|The {{title of}} my {{bachelor}} diploma thesis is Explanation and reasurance of children before operations". In the introduction I {{dealt with a}} theory of how important a role of a reasurance nurse and other hospital staff is during hospitalization of a child, what {{the role of the}} parents is and how necessary it is to prepare the child psychologically for hospitalization and curing process, which the child has to go through during the stay in hospital. Based on this theory I set goals and hypotheses which I tried to confirm or <b>contradict</b> <b>by</b> a research in a form of questionnaires or dialogues. The results of the research are stated in graphs in practical part. In the conclusion and discussion the results are interpreted...|$|R
50|$|This result, if correct, {{meant that}} the earth was not a sphere, but a prolate {{spheroid}} (taller than wide). However, this <b>contradicted</b> computations <b>by</b> Isaac Newton and Christiaan Huygens. Newton's theory of gravitation predicted the Earth to be an oblate spheroid (wider than tall), with a flattening of 1:230.|$|R
5|$|Kiarostami's films often {{reflect upon}} {{immaterial}} {{concepts such as}} the soul and afterlife. At times, however, {{the very concept of}} the spiritual seems to be <b>contradicted</b> <b>by</b> the medium itself, given that it has no inherent means to confer the metaphysical. Some film theorists have argued that The Wind Will Carry Us provides a template by which a filmmaker can communicate metaphysical reality. The limits of the frame and the representation through dialogue with another that is not represented, physically become metaphors for the relationship between this world and those that may exist apart from it. By limiting the space of the mise en scène, Kiarostami expands the space of the art.|$|E
5|$|Mahavira {{has been}} mistakenly called {{the founder of}} Jainism. Jains believe that there were 23 {{teachers}} before the Mahavira, and they believe that Jainism was founded in far more ancient times {{than that of the}} Mahavira, whom they revere as the 24th Tirthankara. The first 22 Tirthankaras are placed in mythical times. For example, the 22nd Tirthankara Arishtanemi is believed in the Jain tradition to have been born 84,000 years before the 23rd Tirthankara named Parshvanatha. Mahavira is sometimes placed within Parshvanatha lineage, but this is <b>contradicted</b> <b>by</b> all Jain texts, which state that Mahavira renounced the world alone.|$|E
5|$|Remains {{assignable}} to Paraceratherium {{have been}} found in early to late Oligocene (34–23 million years ago) formations across Eurasia, in modern-day China, Mongolia, India, Pakistan, Kazakhstan, Georgia, Turkey, Romania, Bulgaria, and the Balkans. Their distribution may be correlated with the palaeogeographic development of the Alpine-Himalayan mountain belt. The range of Paraceratherium finds implies that they inhabited a continuous landmass with a similar environment across it, but this is <b>contradicted</b> <b>by</b> palaeogeographic maps that show this area had various marine barriers, so the genus was successful in being widely distributed despite this. The fauna which coexisted with Paraceratherium included other rhinoceroses, artiodactyls, rodents, beardogs, weasels, hyaenodonts, nimravids and cats.|$|E
50|$|The Technical Standards and Safety Authority, {{the agency}} that regulates fuel safety in Ontario, {{originally}} said that it had only inspected Sunrise once since it opened in 2005. They later <b>contradicted</b> this <b>by</b> stating that they had issued stop work orders in 2006 and 2007 over safety violations.|$|R
50|$|Another use of {{impeachment}} by contradiction {{can be explained}} negatively. An attorney cannot contradict an opponent's witness on a trivial ("collateral") fact like {{the color of the}} hat worn on the day she witnessed the accident, but on more important matters normally excluded by the rules of relevance, contradiction may be allowed. Thus, a witness might not normally be permitted to testify being a safe driver and the opponent cannot normally prove that the driver is unsafe, but if the witness nonetheless happens to testify being a safe driver (no objection was made to the question), the opponent can now <b>contradict</b> <b>by</b> eliciting on cross-examination that the driver was involved in several accidents. Had contradiction impeachment not been permitted, the unsafe character of the witness would have been barred by the rules of evidence.|$|R

5|$|Rupert Murdoch {{announced}} in early February 2007 that Baron Cohen had {{signed on to}} do another Borat film with Fox. However, this was <b>contradicted</b> <b>by</b> an interview with Baron Cohen himself in which Baron Cohen stated that Borat was to be discontinued, as he was now too well known to avoid detection {{as he did in}} the film and on Da Ali G Show. A spokesman for Fox later stated that it was too early to begin planning such a film, although they were open to the idea.|$|E
5|$|Samuel Adams {{later became}} a {{controversial}} figure in American history. Accounts written in the 19th century praised him as someone who had been steering his fellow colonists towards independence long before {{the outbreak of the}} Revolutionary War. This view gave way to negative assessments of Adams {{in the first half of}} the 20th century, in which he was portrayed as a master of propaganda who provoked mob violence to achieve his goals. Both of these interpretations have been challenged by some modern scholars, who argue that these traditional depictions of Adams are myths <b>contradicted</b> <b>by</b> the historical record.|$|E
5|$|Bär's 204th and 205th victories, {{against two}} Hawker Typhoons, were {{achieved}} on 1 January 1945 during Unternehmen Bodenplatte, a Luftwaffe mass attack against Allied airfields in the Benelux area. The operation resulted {{in hundreds of}} aircraft losses on both sides. Bär's JG3 contributed by raiding Eindhoven in the Netherlands, shooting down about six RAF fighters and destroying many aircraft on the ground. One of Bär's 'aerial kills' {{may not have been}} airborne. Historian Norman Franks states both aircraft, from No. 438 Squadron RAF, were taxiing when hit. Flight Lieutenant Pete Wilson was wounded and later died from his injuries after Bär's strafing attack. The second Typhoon did get airborne. Its pilot, Flight Officer Ross Keller was killed. This version of events is <b>contradicted</b> <b>by</b> a witness, Pilot Officer 'Bill' Harle, who thought both aircraft were airborne.|$|E
