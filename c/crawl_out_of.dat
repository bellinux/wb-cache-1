5|$|As an {{adaptation}} for navigating its complex reef environment, the epaulette shark moves by seemingly walking, bending its body from side-to-side and pushing {{off of the}} substrate with its paddle-shaped pectoral and pelvic fins. Its gait {{is similar to that}} of salamanders, an example of convergent evolution. The shark is capable of swimming, but often prefers to walk along the sandy or coral bottom even when the water is deep enough to allow it to swim freely. The cartilaginous supports of the epaulette shark's paired fins are reduced and separated when compared to other sharks, allowing them to be rotated for use as limbs. This mode of locomotion even enables the shark to <b>crawl</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the water to access isolated tidal pools. The gait of the epaulette shark is convergently similar to those of tetrapods such as salamanders, suggesting that the movements needed for walking on land may predate, and facilitated the evolution of, the first terrestrial vertebrates. Epaulette sharks are largely nocturnal and are most active in low water. They often hide inside or below coral heads, though it is enough for the head to be covered even if the rest of the body is exposed. Sometimes they perch in the open on sandy flats or atop reefs facing into the current, a form of orientation known as rheotaxis that may improve respiration or predator awareness.|$|E
5|$|Bubbles is {{an action}} game with puzzle {{elements}} where the player controls the protagonist, a soap bubble, from a top-down perspective. The {{object is to}} clean a kitchen sink by maneuvering over ants, crumbs, and grease spots to absorb them before they slide into the drain. As the bubble absorbs more objects, it grows in size, eventually acquiring first eyes and then a smiling mouth. At the same time, sponges and scrub brushes slowly move around the sink, cleaning {{it on their own}} in competition with the player. Touching either of these enemies costs a player one life unless the bubble is large enough to have a complete face. In this case, the enemy will be knocked away and the bubble will shrink. Sponges and brushes can be knocked into the drain for bonus points, eliminating them from play. Two other enemies in the sink are stationary razor blades and roaches that <b>crawl</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the drain. Contact with a blade is always fatal, while the bubble can safely touch the roach only while carrying a broom, which will kill the roach with one hit. The broom can be acquired by running over a cleaning lady who appears in the sink from time to time.|$|E
25|$|During {{this time}} the jawless agnathan fishes began to decline in {{diversity}} in freshwater and marine environments partly due to drastic environmental changes and {{partly due to the}} increasing competition, predation and diversity of jawed fishes. The shallow, warm, oxygen-depleted waters of Devonian inland lakes, surrounded by primitive plants, provided the environment necessary for certain early fish to develop such essential characteristics as well developed lungs, and the ability to <b>crawl</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the water and onto the land for short periods of time.|$|E

25|$|In some species, larvae are {{attended}} {{and protected}} by ants while feeding on the host plant, and the ants receive sugar-rich honeydew from them, throughout the larval life, {{and in some}} species during the pupal stage. In other species, only the first few instars are spent on the plant, and {{the remainder of the}} larval lifespan is spent as a predator within the ant nest. It becomes a parasite, feeding on ant regurgitations, or a predator on the ant larvae. The caterpillars pupate inside the ant's nest and the ants continue to look after the pupa. Just before the adult emerges the wings of the butterfly inside the pupal case detach from it, and the pupa becomes silvery. The adult butterfly emerges from the pupa after three to four weeks, still inside the ant nest. The butterfly must <b>crawl</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the ant nest before it can expand its wings.|$|E
500|$|... "Travelers" [...] {{was written}} {{as a tribute}} to Howard Dimsdale, a screenwriter who was victimized by Hollywood {{blacklist}} in the 1950s and explored the idea that [...] "the witch-hunt [...] was actually a smoke screen to conceal something else". Noted actor Darren McGavin appears as Arthur Dales. McGavin was requested for the part especially by Chris Carter and had been approached to play various characters on the series before. In order to create a [...] "convincing period movie", various special effects were used, including a special facial appliance that allowed the [...] "alien spider" [...] to <b>crawl</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> Skur's mouth and into his victim, and a bleaching job for the final film to give it an aged feel.|$|E
500|$|In 2005, Adopus aculeatus and veined octopus (Amphioctopus marginatus) {{were found}} to walk on two arms, {{while at the same}} time {{mimicking}} plant matter. This form of locomotion allows these octopuses to move quickly away from a potential predator without being recognised. A study of this behaviour led to the suggestion that the two rearmost appendages may be more accurately termed [...] "legs" [...] rather than [...] "arms". Some species of octopus can <b>crawl</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the water briefly, which they may do between tide pools while hunting crustaceans or gastropods or to escape predators. [...] "Stilt walking" [...] is used by the veined octopus when carrying stacked coconut shells. The octopus carries the shells underneath it with two arms, and progresses with an ungainly gait supported by its remaining arms held rigid.|$|E

500|$|Anning {{was born}} in Lyme Regis in Dorset, England. [...] Her father, Richard Anning, was a cabinetmaker who {{supplemented}} his income by mining the coastal cliff-side fossil beds near the town, and selling his finds to tourists. [...] He married Mary Moore, known as Molly, on 8 August 1793 in Blandford Forum. The couple moved to Lyme and {{lived in a house}} built on the town's bridge. [...] They attended the Dissenter chapel on Coombe Street, whose worshippers initially called themselves independents and later became known as Congregationalists. Shelley Emling writes that the family lived so close to the sea that the same storms that swept along the cliffs to reveal the fossils sometimes flooded the Annings' home, on one occasion forcing them to <b>crawl</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> an upstairs bedroom window to avoid being drowned.|$|E
500|$|There were {{allegations}} that the film was plagiarized from a 1967 script, The Alien, by Indian Bengali director Satyajit Ray. He stated, [...] "E.T. {{would not have been}} possible without my script of The Alien being available throughout the United States in mimeographed copies." [...] Spielberg denied this claim, stating, [...] "I was a kid in high school when his script was circulating in Hollywood." [...] Star Weekend Magazine disputes Spielberg's claim, pointing out that he had graduated from high school in 1965 and began his career as a director in Hollywood in 1969. Director and Spielberg’s friend, Martin Scorsese, has also alleged the film was influenced by Ray's script. When Ray attempted to sue Spielberg in 1983, Spielberg was quoted as saying, [...] "It's the people you've never heard of who <b>crawl</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the woodwork like cockroaches to sue you".|$|E
500|$|Special effects {{supervisor}} Toby Lindala {{created the}} [...] "alien spider" [...] {{as well as}} a special facial appliance that allowed the creature to <b>crawl</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> Skur's mouth and into his victim. The final film was slightly bleached in post-production to give it a [...] "vintage appearance". The production staff was pleased with the final product, noting that it does justice to both [...] "the painful controversies of the 1950s" [...] and The X-Files as a [...] "contemporary TV series". The episode also contained several in-jokes. The song playing in the German doctor's house is a specially recorded cover of the popular song [...] "Lili Marleen"; the song's record cover reads [...] "Paula Rabwini", a reference to one of the series' producers, Paul Rabwin. Agent Hayes Michel was named after the fiancé of Mary Astadourian, one of series creator Chris Carter's executive assistants.|$|E

And I decided I needed to go back and do what I loved before I couldn't do it anymore." [...] At first she could barely stay on a horse without getting tired, but gradually the muscle control required for riding proved directly beneficial, and psychologically, [...] "Riding exhilarated me; it gave me a joy and a purpose.

500|$|The {{main idea}} behind the video is that of Gaga getting kidnapped {{by a group of}} supermodels who drug her and then sell her off to the Russian mafia for a million rubles. It takes place in a {{fluorescent}} white bathhouse. The video begins with Gaga sitting on a white throne in a brightly-lit white room. The scene shows her wearing the razor-blade glasses and surrounded by people and a harlequin Great Dane. She has her finger on the mute button of an iPod speaker, and as she releases it, [...] "Bad Romance" [...] begins to play and a dimly-lit bathhouse is shown. A bright light pans across the walls, activating fluorescent lighting, which shines through a sign reading [...] "Bath Haus of GaGa". As the first hook of the song begins, a group of female dancers wearing white long-sleeved leotards with knee-high boots and matching crowns <b>crawl</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> white, coffin-like pods. The center pod has [...] "Mons†er" [...] written on it, and Gaga emerges wearing an outfit similar to those worn by the others, who begin to dance behind her. A pastiche of ensuing scenes alternates between Gaga singing to herself {{in front of a mirror}} and lying in a bathtub.|$|E
500|$|Six months later, she {{is working}} as a trainer for 9-1-1 operators. Simultaneously, {{teenager}} Casey Welson (Abigail Breslin) is kidnapped from a mall parking garage after parting with her friend, Autumn, and forced {{into the trunk of}} a car. Casey had taken Autumn's disposable phone, and uses it to call 9-1-1. A rookie operator (Jenna Lamia) receives the call but is unable to handle it, prompting Jordan to take over, though Casey's use of a disposable phone means that her exact GPS location cannot be found. While the kidnapper drives, Jordan guides Casey through knocking out a tail light and signaling people in nearby cars. One woman who sees Casey waving her arm out of the trunk of the car calls 9-1-1, allowing the police to narrow their search. When Casey tells Jordan that there are cans of paint in the trunk, Jordan has Casey pour the paint out of the taillight hole, attracting the attention of another motorist, Alan Denado (Michael Imperioli) but the kidnapper knocks him out with a shovel, assuming him to be dead and stuffs Alan in the trunk with Casey. He reawakens in the trunk and begins screaming uncontrollably, which causes the kidnapper to stab him. He stops at a gas station where Casey gets an idea to <b>crawl</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the trunk and scream at an active worker for help. The worker attempts to bust the door open, but the kidnapper sprays him with gasoline and throws a lighter at him.|$|E

2500|$|An early {{version of}} strip-tease became popular in England {{at the time of}} the Restoration. A strip tease was {{incorporated}} into the Restoration comedy The Rover, written by Aphra Behn in 1677. The stripper is a man; an English country gentleman who sensually undresses and goes to bed in a love scene. (However, the scene is played for laughs; the prostitute he thinks is going to bed with him robs him, and he ends up having to <b>crawl</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the sewer.) The concept of strip-tease was also widely known, as can be seen in the reference to it in Thomas Otway's comedy The Soldier's Fortune (1681), where a character says: [...] "Be sure they be lewd, drunken, stripping whores".|$|E

IGN praised the game's graphics, calling them some of the best ever, but criticized the game's story and forgettable characters.
