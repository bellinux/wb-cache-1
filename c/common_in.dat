5|$|In Europe, Boletus pinophilus {{is found}} in Britain, where it is more <b>common</b> <b>in</b> Scotland, and in France, where it is more <b>common</b> <b>in</b> the south. The bolete is {{considered}} vulnerable in the Czech Republic. It is sold commercially in Finland.|$|E
5|$|LDLR {{mutations}} {{are more}} <b>common</b> <b>in</b> certain populations, presumably {{because of a}} genetic phenomenon known as the founder effect—they were founded by {{a small group of}} individuals, one or several of whom was a carrier of the mutation. The Afrikaner, French Canadians, Lebanese Christians, and Finns have high rates of specific mutations that make FH particularly <b>common</b> <b>in</b> these groups. APOB mutations are more <b>common</b> <b>in</b> Central Europe.|$|E
5|$|MS usually {{appears in}} adults {{in their late}} twenties or early thirties but it can rarely start in {{childhood}} and after 50 years of age. The primary progressive subtype is more <b>common</b> <b>in</b> people in their fifties. Similar to many autoimmune disorders, the disease is more <b>common</b> <b>in</b> women, and the trend may be increasing. As of 2008, globally it is about two times more <b>common</b> <b>in</b> women than in men. In children, {{it is even more}} <b>common</b> <b>in</b> females than males, while in people over fifty, it affects males and females almost equally.|$|E

5|$|Panellus stipticus is <b>common</b> <b>in</b> {{northern}} temperate {{regions of}} Europe, {{and has also}} been collected in Australia, New Zealand, Anatolia, Japan, and China.

5|$|The fungus is {{widespread}} and <b>common</b> <b>in</b> its preferred habitats in North America, Europe, and northern Asia. Although far less <b>common</b> <b>in</b> southerly locations, isolated collections {{have been reported}} from Africa (Congo, Nigeria, Sierra Leone, and Tanzania) and South Asia (India). In North America M.rotula is most <b>common</b> <b>in</b> {{the eastern part of}} the continent.|$|E
5|$|The {{species is}} <b>common</b> <b>in</b> spruce-fir and spruce-moorland forests and in spruce forests and plantations. Together with spruces, the fungus is also <b>common</b> <b>in</b> {{different}} European beech and oak-European hornbeam forests, {{but also on}} the forest edges, on clearings and in clearcut meadows and even on juniper heathers and in parkland. There are scarcely any habitats where the spruce is common, while the fungus is not found there. The fungus is very <b>common</b> <b>in</b> young spruce forests that are 10 to 20 years old, where it occurs on forest path edges occasionally in masses.|$|E

5|$|A {{variety of}} parasites {{can affect the}} lungs, {{including}} Toxoplasma gondii, Strongyloides stercoralis, Ascaris lumbricoides, and Plasmodium malariae. These organisms typically enter the body through {{direct contact with the}} skin, ingestion, or via an insect vector. Except for Paragonimus westermani, most parasites do not affect specifically the lungs but involve the lungs secondarily to other sites. Some parasites, in particular those belonging to the Ascaris and Strongyloides genera, stimulate a strong eosinophilic reaction, which may result in eosinophilic pneumonia. In other infections, such as malaria, lung involvement is due primarily to cytokine-induced systemic inflammation. In the developed world these infections are most <b>common</b> <b>in</b> people returning from travel or in immigrants. Around the world, these infections are most <b>common</b> <b>in</b> the immunodeficient.|$|E

5|$|Actual or {{impending}} airway obstruction is {{a common}} indication for intubation of the trachea. Life-threatening airway obstruction may occur when a foreign body becomes lodged in the airway; this is especially <b>common</b> <b>in</b> infants and toddlers. Severe blunt or penetrating injury to the face or neck may be accompanied by swelling and an expanding hematoma, or injury to the larynx, trachea or bronchi. Airway obstruction is also <b>common</b> <b>in</b> people who have suffered smoke inhalation or burns within or near the airway or epiglottitis. Sustained generalized seizure activity and angioedema are other common causes of life-threatening airway obstruction which may require tracheal intubation to secure the airway.|$|E
