The ICAIC {{is the first}} cultural act of the revolutionary government. The aims are to educate people and improve the quality level of Cuban films. Also, the ICAIC hopes to transform Cuba from a <b>country</b> <b>of</b> <b>consumption</b> to production. ICAIC made two clarifications: first, “cinema is an art”, and second, cinema constitutes “an instrument of opinion and formation of individual and collective consciousness”. Due to these clarifications, it led numerous underground filmmakers joining together.|$|E
30|$|China {{is a major}} {{consumer}} of spices in Southeast Asia. As early as the Han dynasty, cloves and nutmeg originating in Indonesia’s Maluku Islands were transported to China by different ethnic groups. Even today, {{more than half of}} all cloves and nutmeg in the Chinese market still come from Indonesia, despite global commodity diversification. Mountainous island residents, overseas Chinese in Indonesia and Chinese businessmen are involved in this transnational trading network from the country of origin to the <b>country</b> <b>of</b> <b>consumption,</b> which covers all economic operations, including production, sales, transportation and consumption. Thus, the cross-cultural production mechanism plays a crucial role for the orderly and healthy development of regional spice trade network (Tong, 2016).|$|E
40|$|In {{response}} to growing concerns over climate change, consumers and firms {{in developed countries}} are considering their carbon footprint. Carbon labelling is being explored as a mechanism for greenhouse gas emission reduction primarily by private actors. This paper discusses the carbon accounting activities and carbon labelling schemes that are being developed to address these concerns {{with a view to}} their impact on small stakeholders, especially low income countries. This discussion centres on transportation, and the common presumption that products produced locally in the <b>country</b> <b>of</b> <b>consumption</b> will have an advantage in terms of carbon emissions, and on size. Exports from low income countries typically depend on long distance transportation and are produced by relatively small firms and tiny farms who will find it difficult to participate in complex carbon labelling schemes. However, the popular belief that trade by definition is problematic since it necessitates transportation, which is a major source of emissions, is generally not true. The scientific evidence shows that carbon efficiencies elsewhere in the supply chain may more than offset the emissions associated with transportation. Indeed, the effectiv...|$|E

40|$|Purpose – Unlike other plant‐based drugs, {{cannabis}} {{is increasingly}} grown within the <b>country</b> <b>of</b> <b>consumption,</b> requires minimal processing before consumption, {{and can be}} easily grown almost anywhere using indoor or outdoor cultivation techniques. Developments in agronomic technologies have led to global growth in domestic cultivation, both by cannabis users for self‐ and social‐supply, and by more commercially‐oriented growers. Cross‐national {{research is needed to}} better understand who is involved in domestic cultivation, the diversity in cultivation practices and motivations, and cultivators' interaction with the criminal justice system and cannabis control policies. Design/methodology/approach – The article introduces the Global Cannabis Cultivation Research Consortium (GCCRC), describes its evolution and aims, and outlines the methodology of its ongoing cross‐national online survey of cannabis cultivation. Findings – Despite differing national contexts, the GCCRC successfully developed a core questionnaire to be used in different countries. It accommodates varying research interests through the addition of optional survey sections. The benefits to forming an international consortium to conduct web‐based survey research include the sharing of expertise, recruitment efforts and problem‐solving. Research limitations/implications – The article discusses the limitations of using non‐representative online sampling and the strategies used to increase validity. Originality/value – The GCCRC is conducting the largest cross‐national study of domestic cannabis cultivation to date. The aim is not only to better understand patterns of cannabis cultivation and how they differ between countries but also to build upon online engagement methodology with hidden populations...|$|E
40|$|In the {{international}} trade network, links express the (temporary) presence of a commercial exchange of goods between any two countries. Given the dynamical behaviour of the trade network, where links are created and dismissed every year, predicting the link activation/deactivation is an open research question. Through {{the international}} trade network of agricultural goods, water resources are ‘virtually' transferred from the country of production to the <b>country</b> <b>of</b> <b>consumption.</b> We propose a novel methodology for link prediction applied to the network of virtual water trade. Starting from the assumption of having links between any two countries, we estimate the associated virtual water flows {{by means of a}} gravity-law model using country and link characteristics as drivers. We consider the links with estimated flows higher than 1000 m 3 /year as active links, while the others as non-active links. Flows traded along estimated active links are then re-estimated using a similar but differently-calibrated gravity-law model. We were able to correctly model 84 % of the existing links and 93 % of the non-existing links in year 2011. It is worth to note that the predicted active links carry 99 % of the global virtual water flow; hence, missed links are mainly those where a minimum volume of virtual water is exchanged. Results indicate that, over the period from 1986 to 2011, population, geographical distances between countries, and agricultural efficiency (through fertilizers use) are the major factors driving the link activation and deactivation. As opposed to other (network-based) models for link prediction, the proposed method is able to reconstruct the network architecture without any prior knowledge of the network topology, using only the nodes and links attributes; it thus represents a general method that can be applied to other networks such as food or value trade networks...|$|E
40|$|In {{the context}} of Value Added Tax (VAT) on consumption, the {{importance}} of VAT deduction is increasing particularly by cross-border trade with goods and services. That is to say, the mechanism of deduction may prevent the foreign trade from VAT caused trade barriers. In this work, the conventional concept of trade barriers is initially clarified as governmental discrimination of economic sales from abroad. For VAT purposes, this concept takes a supplementation. The discrimination in terms of VAT can be proven {{on the basis of}} the so-called destination principle. According to this principle, it is solely admitted taxes to be imposed in that country in which supplied goods or services are consumed. Therefore, this principle is also called <b>country</b> <b>of</b> <b>consumption</b> principle. If goods or service have arrived at the country of destination and are burdened by the country of origin with VAT, this country should provide for deduction or refund of the levied VAT. Thus, the concept of trade barriers is to be supplemented by discrimination of economic sales to foreign countries. Hence, the country of origin has to award the unlimited right to deduct input VAT and the performance of this right in order to prevent trade barriers. Additionally, it is generally not allowed to levy higher taxes on the “imported” sale in the country of destination for the reason that the sale is originated from abroad. Subsequently, it is discovered certain restrictions of the VAT deduction concerning cross-border transactions of goods and services between EU member states and Turkey from the viewpoint of VAT law in the EU. Residents in Turkey as supplier or receiver of taxable sales can claim VAT deduction only in accordance to Directive 86 / 560 /EEC. This Directive concedes essential (political) scope for limitations of VAT deduction (refund), e. g. “of reciprocity” or the appointment of a tax representative, to the member states. Furthermore, the VAT refund is unavoidable excluded by the Directive, if the taxable person from Turkey supplies particular sales of insurances and financial products or incur some expenditures determined by the respective EU member state. Pursuant to Turkish VAT law, it can be stated that there are shortcomings of VAT deduction detrimental to EU residents with regard to the cross-border trade. If EU taxable persons receive goods or services from Turkey, which are subject to VAT, a VAT deduction, on a regular basis, is not permitted. Moreover, taxable persons from EU, who imports goods to Turkey, are basically obliged to pay import VAT. The deduction of this tax requires that the taxable person owes VAT due to other taxable sales in Turkey. The import VAT could be deducted from this VAT debt. But it is rarely the case that there is that kind of VAT debt. Finally, EU taxable persons supplying taxable cross-border sales in Turkey are not eligible to VAT deduction, to the extent that the input VAT on purchases exceeds the VAT debt on the cross-border sales...|$|E

40|$|Global <b>consumption</b> <b>of</b> farming {{commodities}} is {{an important}} driver of water demand in regions of production. This {{is the case in}} Brazil, which has {{emerged as one of the}} main producers of globally traded farming commodities. Traditional methods to assess environmental implications of this demand rely on international trade material flows at country resolution; we argue for the need of finer scales that capture spatial heterogeneity in environmental variables in the regions of production, and that account for differential sourcing within the borders <b>of</b> a <b>country</b> <b>of</b> production. To illustrate this, we obtain virtual water flows from Brazilian municipalities to <b>countries</b> <b>of</b> <b>consumption,</b> by allocating high-resolution water footprints of sugarcane and soy production to spatially-explicit material trade flows. We found that this approach results in differences of virtual water use estimations of over 20 % when compared to approaches that disregard spatial heterogeneity in sourcing patterns, for three of the main consumers of the analysed crops. This discrepancy against methods using national resolution in trade flows is determined by national heterogeneity in water resources, and differential sourcing. To illustrate the practical implications of this approach, we relate virtual water flows to water stress, identifying where global demand for water coincides with high levels of water stress. For instance, the virtual water flows for Brazilian sugarcane sourced by China were disproportionally less associated to areas with higher water stress when compared to those of the EU, due to EU's much higher reliance on sugarcane from water scarce areas in Northeast Brazil. Our findings indicate that the policy relevance of current assessments of virtual water flows that rely on trade data aggregated at the national level may be hampered, as they do not capture the spatial heterogeneity in water resources, water use and water management options. © 2016 IOP Publishing Ltd...|$|R
