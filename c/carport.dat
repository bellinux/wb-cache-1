5|$|Beginning on December29 and {{continuing}} for three days, the storm system {{associated with the}} tornado outbreak caused strong winds across the Texas Panhandle and eastern New Mexico. The winds were further enhanced by isolated showers, and gusts peaked at 79mph (127km/h) in Tatum, New Mexico. Approximately 7mi (11km) west of Levelland, Texas, the winds downed four power poles, sparking a fire that burned nearly 2,000acres (800hectares) of grassland before it was finally contained; the fire caused US$20,000in damage. In Allen, Oklahoma, strong winds associated with one supercell caused an estimated US$20,000 in damage after damaging the <b>carport,</b> chimney, and roof of a house. Hail and strong winds were also reported elsewhere in eastern Oklahoma and southeastern Kansas. Widespread and damaging wind gusts and hail later crossed into northwestern Arkansas, causing US$175,000in damage. Several buildings and homes were destroyed by the strong winds; similar impacts were seen in Missouri and Illinois.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Humberto left 10homes {{completely}} destroyed in Galveston County, {{with an additional}} 19 severely damaged in the county; several homes received minor shingle damage, and road closures left about 5,000houses isolated in the county. The combination of saturated grounds and strong winds uprooted many trees and downed power lines across {{the path of the}} hurricane, with at least 50high voltage transmission poles blown down or seriously damaged; over 120,000power customers in Orange and Jefferson counties lost power, with 118,000Entergy customers in the state without electricity. Widespread flooding occurred in Jefferson and Orange counties, and at least 20homes in Beaumont were flooded. Additionally, several roadways were flooded. The passage of the hurricane caused one fatality in the state; a Bridge City man was killed when his <b>carport</b> crashed on him outside his house. Initially, press reports indicated that the storm wrought up to $500million in damage; however, final damage estimates were about $50million.|$|E
5|$|The falling trees downed {{power lines}} and poles, causing power outages and some {{property}} damage due to the trees and poles hitting houses. One indirect fatality occurred when a motorist drove into a downed tree. Two other vehicles in Franklin County and a fire truck in York were hit and greatly damaged by trees. Downed wires set a Family Dollar on fire in Paradise Township and was believed to have started a fire in a church in Ringtown. Falling trees hit at least eleven houses, with one tree severely damaging a mobile home in Bellwood. Damage directly from the wind was generally minor, and included a house losing a chimney in Camp Hill, a <b>carport</b> being blown over in New Oxford, and at least four houses reporting roof or siding damage. The hurricane also damaged corn fields near Lancaster. Downed trees closed or disrupted traffic on at least 56roads in the region, including U.S. Routes 6 and 322, as well as Interstate 83 in York County.|$|E

5|$|In Coffee County, local {{officials}} reported wind gusts had blown a <b>carport</b> {{into a wall}} of a house. Marengo County received moderate damage, mostly limited to power outages and minor roof and structural damage caused by fallen trees and powerlines. Many customers were without electric power {{for at least a}} day, and numerous county roads were covered with debris. A person was injured in Dallas County when a tree landed on their car. Five homes and one business were damaged due to high winds, and thousands of people county-wide experienced power outages. Greene County reported hundreds of downed trees and powerlines causing County Roads 148 and 20 and State Highways 11, 43 and 14 to be temporarily closed. In Forkland, a mobile home caught fire when a powerline fell on the home. A motorist ran into a fallen tree in Boligee although did not sustain injuries. In Perry County, 2,200homes were without electric power for several hours, and several vehicles and homes were damaged. A structural fire occurred in Russell County and was believed to be ignited by downed powerlines.|$|E
5|$|The fourth tornado of the {{outbreak}} touched down around 2:45a.m. EST near Peacocks Crossroads in Johnston County, knocking down several trees, {{some of which}} were mature. Significant roof damage occurred after the tornado struck a double-wide mobile home and destroyed the porch of another home. Another mobile home had some of its siding torn off before the tornado dissipated. No injuries were reported {{as a result of the}} tornado and damages amounted to $30,000. The tornado was rated as an EF1 by the National Weather Service. The fifth tornado of {{the outbreak}} touched down around 3:03a.m. EST near U.S. Route 70, damaging several pine trees and causing minor roof damage. Tracking towards the northeast, the tornado destroyed a <b>carport</b> and the car inside. A trailer was rolled on its side and a nearby home sustained siding and shingle damage. Afterwords, the tornado struck a horse farm where it destroyed a small barn and damaged a stable. Before dissipating, the tornado blew out the windows in the garage of one home. No injuries were reported as a result of the tornado and damages amounted to $75,000. The tornado was rated as a high-end EF0 by the National Weather Service.|$|E

25|$|Morgan {{later told}} biographer Myra Friedman that, as a non-musician, {{he had felt}} {{excluded}} whenever he had visited Sunset Sound Recorders. Instead, he stayed at Joplin's Larkspur home while she stayed alone at the Landmark, although several times she visited Larkspur {{to be with him}} and to check the progress of renovations she was having done on the house. She told her construction crew to design a <b>carport</b> to be shaped like a flying saucer, according to biographer Ellis Amburn, the concrete foundation for which was poured the day before she died.|$|E
25|$|The L-shaped {{layout of}} the massive building, {{together}} with adjacent constructions, and the surrounding brick and masonry fence, hides to the local transient the open and greenish interior patio of the residence. The patio can be access through the zaguan, the <b>carport,</b> or directly from the upper level eastern end, using a brick and masonry half-turn with landing staircase. As of 2013 the house was vacant, and thus the small urban courtyard-backyard reflects abandonment. However, there are certain built elements within the area that still warrant further description. Most important {{of these is the}} marble flared stair, identical to the zaguan staircase (but with one less riser) and the iron grilled gate, which replicates also the zaguans iron gate. Many early twentieth century Vives' family photos at the patio, using the staircase as stage, suggest the social importance of the location. A water fountain sits {{at the center of the}} patio, another favorite spot for early 20th century family photos. There are two separate brick and masonry constructions in a precarious state, currently used as construction material storage area. During the 19th century, the buildings were use as residence for the service personnel.|$|E
25|$|Early in {{the morning}} on January21, a large tornado touched down {{northwest}} of Purvis in Lamar County, Mississippi, at 3:35a.m. EST (08:35UTC). The tornado initially caused EF1 damage, snapping and uprooting many trees and destroying small sheds. A house sustained minor roof damage and collapse of its <b>carport,</b> and a power pole was snapped as well. Further to the northeast, the tornado reached EF2 intensity as it ripped the roof off of a well-built brick home and destroyed outbuildings. As the tornado approached the Forrest County line, EF2 damage continued as another home had its roof torn off, a mobile home was completely destroyed, and a billboard pole was snapped. Other homes in this area sustained minor roof damage, and trees and power poles were downed. The tornado intensified to EF3 strength shortly after it crossed the Forrest County line and entered residential areas of southwestern Hattiesburg, where multiple well-constructed brick homes had roofs torn off and exterior walls collapsed, and an elderly woman was killed. The tornado continued producing EF3 damage as it crossed Veterans Memorial Drive, snapping metal power pylons and severely damaging two buildings at Living Word Church. Maintaining its strength, the tornado moved across U.S. Route 49 and through a residential area, damaging several homes and destroying the top floor of a church. The tornado then tore directly through the William Carey University campus, resulting in severe structural damage and tossing and damaging numerous vehicles in the parking lots. Multiple large, multi-story brick buildings had windows blown out, roofs ripped off, and top floor exterior walls collapsed. Light poles were downed at the ball field as well.|$|E

50|$|In Texas, winds {{as high as}} 95 mph caused {{extensive}} damage to homes and businesses, resulting in roughly $100 million in damage. Numerous trees were felled across the region and a few structures were destroyed. In Dallas County, a few <b>carports</b> collapsed. Near Venus, 82 mph winds damaged five homes.|$|R

25|$|The building's {{lower level}} has been {{historically}} used for commercial purposes. As a corner lot, {{the first floor}} L-elevation has one square-shaped volume facing west towards Paseo Atocha, while the other two commercial spaces occupy the longitudinal axis that runs east-to-west along Castillo Street. The commercial spaces are of different sizes. In all three sections, the original floors were replaced with native tiles, product of an early 20th century intervention. The 12-foot high ceiling in the square-shaped section is covered with pressed tin panels, a decorative addition very frequently used during the 1920s among the upper class' residences and social/civic buildings in different cities in Puerto Rico. Meanwhile, the 17-foot high ceiling {{in the other two}} commercial areas have kept the original exposed ausubo (manilkara bidentata tree) beams, sustaining the pichipen rafters, which support three layers of thin bricks that make-up the foundation for the upper level floor. Throughout the entire first floor's interior, the stucco has been removed, leaving the brick walls completely exposed. Each commercial section has its own service room. The 110 feet 5 inches long longitudinal elevation that faces Castillo Street has a very public exposure with four large clear glass windows and an equal number of clear-glass-metal-framed doors. The axis that faces Paseo Atocha has an additional glass door and two large glass windows. All three spaces at the first floor have access to a narrow backyard limited by a seven-foot high brick and masonry wall, which runs east-to-west, and separates the commercial space, physically and visually, from a large open garden-like interior patio only accessible to the upper-level residents. The Castillo Street axis has, on its eastern end, an arched wooden gate, that provide access to the cochera (<b>carport),</b> which by the time Casa Vives was built in the 1860s, served to properly house the family's horse stagecoach, and later, during the early twentieth century, housed the Ford's model T's and Model A's.|$|E
500|$|Tropical Storm Bill dropped light {{rainfall}} {{of around}} [...] in northeastern Arkansas and southeastern Missouri, and over [...] in isolated parts of eastern Tennessee. The storm also produced moderate rainfall in northwestern Georgia, which peaked at [...] in Monroe. Areas in southeastern Georgia received generally around some coastal areas {{did not receive}} any precipitation from the storm. Rainfall resulted in flooding in numerous locations around the Atlanta metropolitan area, leaving some roads impassable or closed. The combination of moist air from the south, cool temperatures from a cold front to the north, and low pressures {{led to the development}} of supercells throughout Georgia and South Carolina, several of which produced tornadoes. An F1 tornado touched down [...] north-northeast of Pennington; first it passed through a farm, causing severe damage to two dairy sheds, a John Deere tractor, and three metal storage buildings. The tornado destroyed a hay barn, a <b>carport,</b> and a car inside the <b>carport</b> as well, while also causing a tree to fall and kill one cow. The tornado passed through a forested area, where it toppled or sheared off hundreds of trees. As it entered a more urban area, it downed 30isolated trees, some of which fell on a portion of Interstate 20, temporarily closing the roadway. The tornado damaged seven houses, primarily to roof damage, although one experienced damage to several windows, while another had a utility trailer and a car damaged by fallen trees; a commercial building was damaged as well. An F2 tornado was reported in Clito, which knocked down trees and damaged mobile homes. Severe thunderstorms from the remnants of Bill caused considerable damage to a house near Louisville and knocked down several trees. Moreover, a tornado was briefly associated with the storms. Bill also caused thunderstorms in Kite which uprooted several trees onto a car and a house. One man in Atlanta died due to a falling tree. Damage in Georgia totaled to $244,500 (2003USD, $ USD).|$|E
500|$|Around 1:35a.m. EST, a weak tornado {{touched down}} near several mobile homes about [...] east-southeast of St. Pauls, North Carolina in Robeson County, {{one of which}} {{sustained}} severe damage. Afterwords, the tornado traveled towards the north-northeast and crossed North Carolina Highway 20. An auto repair shop located along the highway sustained significant damage {{with all of the}} bay windows being blown out and 17 nearby storage sheds were destroyed. Several trees were knocked down onto railroad tracks before the tornado damaged another mobile home and dissipated. No injuries were reported {{as a result of the}} tornado and damages amounted to $50,000. The tornado was rated as an EF0 with winds up to [...] The third tornado touched down around 2:15a.m. EST near the town of Autryville in Sampson County. Several trees were damaged along the tornado's path and one home sustained notable damage. A <b>carport</b> near the home was blown down and twisted into nearby trees.

500|$|On June 30, Tarrants {{returned}} to Meridian {{to bomb the}} home of Meyer Davidson, an outspoken leader of the Jewish community, on 29th Avenue. The FBI and police chief Roy Gunn convinced Raymond and Alton Wayne Roberts, local Klan members, to gather information about the Klan's operations. Alton was free on bond after being convicted {{in connection with the}} murders of Chaney, Goodman, and Schwerner in 1964. Leaders of the Jewish communities in Jackson and in Meridian had raised money to pay the two informants, who tipped off the FBI about the attack before it happened. Fifteen police officers were hidden around Davidson's house shortly after midnight when a car stopped about [...] away from the house. Tarrants exited the vehicle with a box, later found to include 29 sticks of dynamite, and approached Davidson's <b>carport.</b> When police ordered him to stop, he dropped the box and fled to his vehicle. Officers then chased him for about 15 blocks before ramming the back of his vehicle, ending the chase. Tarrants opened fire on the policemen with a German-made 9mm submachine gun, striking officer J.M. Hatcher four times in the chest (though critically injured, the officer survived). Tarrants fled through the neighborhood continuing to fire at the policemen. Robert Burton, a resident of the neighborhood, opened his door {{to see what was going}} on and was struck by stray bullets. Police eventually found Tarrants in a pool of his own blood in a local resident's backyard. Kathy Ainsworth, a 26-year-old fifth grade school teacher from Jackson who had helped with the bombing of Jackson's synagogue a few months earlier, was found dead in the car with a loaded pistol in her purse. The car's owner was identified to be Danny Joe Hawkins, who had helped bomb Beth Israel; he was arrested on robbery charges a few weeks later. Tarrants survived his wounds and was sentenced to a thirty-year term in Parchman prison. He was paroled eight years into his term to enter the University of Mississippi after a religious conversion, and in 1992 he was training missionaries in North Carolina.|$|E
