Alan Percy, 8th Duke of Northumberland, gave custody of the castle to the Office of Works in 1922.

5|$|The Israeli Defense Minister Israel Navon (Doron Tavory) {{moves to}} {{a house on the}} border between Israel and the West Bank, with the {{building}} sitting on the Israeli side just next to the dividing line. The Israeli Secret Service views the neighboring lemon grove of Salma Zidane (Hiam Abbass), a Palestinian widow whose family has <b>cared</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> area for generations, {{as a threat to the}} minister and his wife. The security forces soon set up a guard post and a fence around the grove. They then obtain an order to uproot the lemon trees.|$|E
5|$|The work's moralising tone is {{apparent}} {{from some of}} its more overtly dark iconography, its choice of saints, and how the scales tilt far lower beneath {{the weight of the}} damned than the saved. The damned to Christ's left are more numerous and less detailed than the saved to his right. In these ways it can be compared to Matthias Grünewald's Isenheim Altarpiece, which served much the same purpose, having been commissioned for the Monastery of St. Anthony in Isenheim, which <b>cared</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> dying.|$|E

5|$|A weary emperor who {{no longer}} <b>cared</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> throne, an heir who {{had no desire to}} assume the crown, discontent among ruling circles who were dismissive of the Imperial role in {{national}} affairs: all seemed to presage the monarchy's impending doom. Nevertheless, Pedro II was unconcerned that times and conditions were changing. After more than five decades on the throne, he had become complacent in a belief that the devotion and support of his subjects was immutable. Because of these factors, and the lack of an energetic response on the part of Pedro II, {{it has been argued that}} prime responsibility for the monarchy's overthrow rested with the Emperor himself.|$|E
5|$|According to the Court of Inquiry, 'the prime {{cause of}} this lamentable episode' was the {{responsibility}} of Colonel Martin. Described as a ‘’loner’’ for whom officers had little respect, Martin’s primary fault {{was that he was}} too trusting, to the point of naivety. While he <b>cared</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> welfare of his men and saw that their living conditions were improved, he was described as being too much of a ‘’solder’s friend’’, to the point that other British officers found that this attitude and work ethic of Martin’s severely undermined their authority over the sepoys. Over time, that served to erode the respect that the British officers and even the sepoys had for him.|$|E
5|$|In 1844, Isabella fell ill. She recovered, but {{the illness}} recurred the {{following}} year, {{and she became}} an invalid. John Macdonald took his wife to Savannah, Georgia, in the United States in 1845, hoping that the sea air and warmth would cure her ailments. Although John Macdonald was {{able to return to}} Canada after six months, Isabella remained in the United States for three years. He visited her again in New York at the end of 1846, and returned several months later when she informed him she was pregnant. In August 1847 their son John Alexander Macdonald Jr. was born in New York, but as Isabella remained ill, relatives <b>cared</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> infant.|$|E

Colleagues were surprised when she had the baby, as she had not mentioned being pregnant and she hid the physical evidence of her pregnancy with her long laboratory jacket. Morgan remembered the reaction of one male colleague when she told him the news; he said if she had five children like he did, she would have hardly noticed the new baby.

5|$|The New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade {{arrived at}} 05:30 on 30 September {{to take over}} the {{position}} and the care of the 534 sick, as well as collecting the 14 guns, 35 machine guns, two automatic rifles, three railway engines, 25 railway trucks, lorries and large amounts of ammunition and stores. After assurances by Brigadier General Ryrie commanding the 2nd Light Horse Brigade, that the sick and wounded Ottoman soldiers would be <b>cared</b> <b>for,</b> <b>the</b> Ottoman force concentrated at dawn near Ziza railway station while the light horsemen took the bolts from the Ottoman rifles. Two Anatolian battalions remained armed in case the Beni Sakhr attacked during the march. The 5th Light Horse Regiment marched between 4,068 and 4,082 prisoners, including walking wounded, north to Amman. They were followed by 502 sick.|$|E
5|$|A weary Emperor who {{no longer}} <b>cared</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> throne, an heir who {{had no desire to}} assume the crown, an {{increasingly}} discontented ruling class who were dismissive of the Imperial role in national affairs: all these factors presaged the monarchy's impending doom. The means to achieve the overthrow of the Imperial system would soon appear within the Army ranks. Republicanism had never flourished in Brazil outside of certain elitist circles, and had little support in the provinces. A growing combination of republican and Positivist ideals among the army's junior and mid-level officer ranks, however, began to form a serious threat to the monarchy. These officers favored a republican dictatorship, which they believed would be superior to the liberal democratic monarchy. Beginning with small acts of insubordination {{at the beginning of the}} 1880s, discontent in the army grew in scope and audacity during the decade, as the Emperor was uninterested and the politicians proved incapable of re-establishing the government's authority over the military.|$|E

40|$|The study {{reported}} in this thesis describes and analyses the lived experience of <b>caring</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> dying amongst nine (9) nurses in a hospice setting. The research was established {{within the context of}} published literature on <b>the</b> subject of <b>caring</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> dying from nursing. A qualitative, phenomenological approach was chosen as <b>the</b> most appropriate <b>for</b> this study, in order to describe and interpret the understanding and shared meanings nurses have in the care of the dying. The major mode of data collection in this study was by in depth interview of nine (9) nurses, which was supplemented by the researcher 2 ̆ 7 s field notes. Data collection, data analysis and validation took place concurrently. Five key themes were identified from the information by the nurse participants which explain the structure of the lived experience of nurses <b>caring</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> dying. These themes are; being transformed by the experience, the influence of context on caring, the embodiment of <b>caring,</b> <b>caring</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> family, and coping. The findings of this study support, in part, related findings in published literature. However, this study extends prior research by capturing the essence of the experience of nurses <b>caring</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> dying, in the context of hospice <b>care.</b> <b>The</b> major implications <b>for</b> nursing practice are that nurses who <b>care</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> dying need an awareness of the processes involved in <b>caring</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> dying to better understand their own, and their patients 2 ̆ 7 experiences. Several recommendations were made for further research which would substantiate and extend this work...|$|R

5|$|The {{origins of}} the Knights Hospitaller are unclear, but the order {{probably}} emerged around the 1070s in Jerusalem. It started as a religious order which <b>cared</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> sick, and later looked after pilgrims to the Holy Land. After {{the success of the}} First Crusade in capturing Jerusalem in 1099, many crusaders donated their new property in the Levant to the Hospital of St John. Early donations were in the newly formed Kingdom of Jerusalem, but over time the order extended its holdings to the Crusader states of the County of Tripoli and the Principality of Antioch. Evidence suggests that in the 1130s the order became militarized when Fulk, King of Jerusalem, granted the newly built castle at Beth Gibelin to the order in 1136. A papal bull from between 1139 and 1143 may indicate the order hiring people to defend pilgrims. There were also other military orders, such as the Knights Templar, which offered protection to pilgrims.|$|E
5|$|On 5 May 2016, James Reilly, then Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, {{announced}} that the Irish Government had approved {{the publication of the}} Adoption (Amendment) Bill 2016. The bill would amend the Adoption Act 2010 and the Children and Family Relationships Act 2015 and give legislative effect to the Thirty-first Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland (the children referendum). The purposes of the bill are to allow children to be adopted by their foster carers, where they have <b>cared</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> child for at least 18 months, and to allow two people regardless of marital status to adopt children, thus granting married same-sex couples the right to adopt. The bill also allows for the adoption of a child by civil partners and cohabiting couples and gives children a greater say in the adoption process, among many other reforms to the adoption system. The bill passed the Dáil on 30 November 2016, and received approval by the Seanad on 13 June 2017. The bill was signed into law by President Michael D. Higgins on 19 July 2017, becoming the Adoption (Amendment) Act 2017. The commencement order was signed by the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Katherine Zappone, on 18 October and the law went into effect the following day.|$|E
