5|$|The bright primary {{star has}} the {{multiple}} star designation WDS19508+0852A and has three faint visual companion stars, WDS19508+0852B, C, and D. Component B is not physically close to A but merely appears <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>it</b> in the sky.|$|E
5|$|Ecliptic {{coordinates}} are {{convenient for}} specifying positions of Solar System objects, {{as most of}} the planets' orbits have small inclinations to the ecliptic, and therefore always appear relatively <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>it</b> on the sky. Because Earth's orbit, and hence the ecliptic, moves very little, it is a relatively fixed reference with respect to the stars.|$|E
5|$|For {{the next}} several miles, NY33 runs {{parallel}} to the Thruway and very <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>it,</b> with both roads visible from the other. Much of this section of Lancaster has remained rural in character; however, that began {{to change in the}} mid-1990s when Tops Friendly Markets, the regional supermarket chain headquartered in nearby Williamsville, chose a site near the Gunnville Road intersection for a major distribution center. It necessitated the widening of the highway and construction of a traffic light and turn lanes at its entrance.|$|E

5|$|Some of {{the most}} visited gardens in the city include Law Garden, Victoria Garden and Bal Vatika. Law Garden was named after the College of Law {{situated}} <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>it.</b> Victoria Garden {{is located at the}} southern edge of the Bhadra Fort and contains a statue of Queen Victoria. Bal Vatika is a children's park situated on the grounds of Kankaria Lake and also houses an amusement park. Other gardens in the city include Parimal Garden, Usmanpura Garden, Prahlad Nagar Garden and Lal Darwaja Garden.|$|E
5|$|Use of an {{automated}} external defibrillator on a patient in a metal underwire bra can cause burns, and the bra should be removed by the first responder before the AED is applied. In their 2007 season, the television program MythBusters tested the possibility of burns resulting from using a defibrillator on a patient who is using an underwire bra, and concluded that while it is possible, {{it is not likely}} unless the metal underwire is exposed and paddles of the defibrillator are very <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E
5|$|A later report {{covering}} the use the Tallboy bomb {{was able to}} directly compare {{the performance of the}} Mk. XIV and SABS in similar mission profiles. Eliminating bombs that fell far from the target as gross errors, those that fell near the target were twice as <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>it</b> when using SABS. Additionally, the number of gross errors with the Mk. XIV was double that of the SABS. The report noted that this additional accuracy did not confer any sort of superiority because the Mk. XIV's tactical freedom in terms of manoeuvring offset any advantage when a long bomb run was not possible. They also noted that a mission using SABS to drop bombs on a target marker would not be any more accurate than the Mk. XIV.|$|E

5|$|The {{discovery}} image {{gave the}} first hint that comet Shoemaker–Levy 9 was an unusual comet, as it appeared to show multiple nuclei in an elongated region about 50arcseconds long and 10arcseconds wide. Brian G. Marsden of the Central Bureau for Astronomical Telegrams noted that the comet lay only about 4degrees from Jupiter as seen from Earth, and that although this could of course be a line of sight effect, its apparent motion in the sky suggested that it was physically <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>it.</b> Because of this, he suggested that the Shoemakers and David Levy had discovered the fragments of a comet that had been disrupted by Jupiter's gravity.|$|E
5|$|While {{anchored}} off the Galápagos, Beebe and {{his crew}} noticed volcanic activity on Albemarle Island, {{and set out to}} investigate it. Anchoring in a small cove, Beebe and his assistant John Tee-Van searched for an active crater where they could observe the eruption, and were nearing exhaustion by the time they found one. As he observed the crater, Beebe realized that the air surrounding it was filled with noxious gases, and narrowly avoided suffocation before staggering away from it. Observing the eruption from his ship for another two days, as well as again at a later point in the expedition, Beebe recorded how numerous birds and marine animals were killed after either failing to escape the lava, or drawing too <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>it</b> in an attempt to scavenge other animals that had died.|$|E
5|$|Mount Adams is the second-most isolated, {{in terms}} of access, {{stratovolcano}} in Washington; Glacier Peak is the most isolated. Only two major highways pass <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>it.</b> Highway 12 passes about 25 {{miles to the north}} of Adams through the Cascades. Highway 141 comes within 13 miles of Adams as it follows the White Salmon River valley up from the Columbia River to the small town of Trout Lake. From either highway, travelers have to use Forest Service roads to get closer to the mountain. The main access roads, FR 23, FR 82, FR 80, and FR 21, are paved for part of their length. Most all other roads are gravel or dirt, with varying degrees of maintenance. Access to the Mount Adams Recreation Area is by way of FR 82, which becomes BIA 285 at the Yakama reservation boundary. BIA 285 is known to be extremely rough and often suitable only for trucks or high-clearance vehicles. Two small towns, Glenwood and Trout Lake, are located in valleys less than 15 miles from the summit, Glenwood on the southeast quarter and Trout Lake on the southwest quarter.|$|E

50|$|The Stern-Brocot tree {{forms an}} {{infinite}} {{binary search tree}} {{with respect to the}} usual ordering of the rational numbers. The set of rational numbers descending from a node q is defined by the open interval (Lq,Hq) where Lq is the ancestor of q that is smaller than q and <b>closest</b> <b>to</b> <b>it</b> in the tree (or Lq = 0 if q has no smaller ancestor) while Hq is the ancestor of q that is larger than q and <b>closest</b> <b>to</b> <b>it</b> in the tree (or Hq = +∞ if q has no larger ancestor).|$|R

5|$|The {{concept was}} for the {{satellite}} to be launched ahead of its target, so that the target would come <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>it.</b> After this the Agena would be used as fuel to put the SAINT in a co-orbit with its target, and then the SAINT would locate the target using its long range radar, and jettison its Agena once it had acquired the target. Then within the next 8 to 12 minutes the SAINT's radar and orientation systems would guide it to within 39ft (12m) of the target. If a SAINT was launched from Cape Canaveral, it {{would be able to}} provide initial video of the target and data dumps to the NORAD station in Rhodesia. A full inspection of the target would take two hours, and be recorded, then sent to a ground station as soon as it came within the range of the station. It would then stay within 200ft (60m) of the target for up to two days, taking pictures and measurements at different angles. After this it would be depleted of battery power and propellant.|$|E

25|$|The ground setting (GKX in {{the above}} example) should have been chosen at random, but Herivel {{reasoned}} that if operators were lazy, in a hurry or otherwise under pressure, they might simply use whatever rotor setting was currently showing on the machine. If {{that was the first}} message of the day and the operator had set the ring settings with the rotors already inside the machine, the rotor position currently showing on the machine could well be the ring setting itself or be very <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>it.</b> (If that situation occurred {{in the above}} example, GKX would be the ring setting or <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>it).</b>|$|E
