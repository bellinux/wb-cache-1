40|$|This study {{examined}} the variability of physiological, perceptual, stroke and <b>coordination</b> <b>parameters</b> in both genders during sev-eral swim trials at the 400 -m pace speed. Twelve national level competitors (6 men, 6 women) swam 400 -m at maximal speed. They then swam three additional trials (100, 200 and 300 -m) at the pace (speed) of the previous 400 -m. Three cameras {{were used to determine}} stroke cycle [speed (V), stroke length (SL), stroke rate (SR) ] and coordination [index of coordination (IdC), stroke phases] parameters. Physiological [heart rate (HR) and lactate [La-] and perceptual [subjective workload (TWL) ] pa-rameters were assessed after each swim trial. Inter-trial data indicated that HR, [La-] and TWL increased significantly with the distance swum (p 0. 05). Thus, despite changes in both physiological and percep-tual responses consecutive to increasing fatigue, <b>coordination</b> <b>parameters</b> remained stable during an all-out 400 -m freestyle swim. The examination of these parameters based on short-distance trials appears then to be valid, which offers interesting perspectives for swim testing...|$|E
