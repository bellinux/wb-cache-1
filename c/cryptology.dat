5|$|Before the war, Palluth, a {{lecturer}} in the 1929 secret Poznań University <b>cryptology</b> course, had been co-owner of AVA, which produced equipment for the Cipher Bureau, and knew many details of the decryption technology. In Warsaw, under German occupation, other Cipher Bureau workers were interrogated by German intelligence commissions, and some AVA workers were approached by German agents, but all kept silent about compromises to Enigma.|$|E
5|$|In 1929, while {{studying}} mathematics at Poznań University, Rejewski attended a secret <b>cryptology</b> course {{conducted by the}} Polish General Staff's Cipher Bureau (Biuro Szyfrów), which he joined in September 1932. The Bureau had had no success in reading Enigma-enciphered messages and set Rejewski {{to work on the}} problem in late 1932; he deduced the machine's secret internal wiring after only a few weeks. Rejewski and his two colleagues then developed successive techniques for the regular decryption of Enigma messages. His contributions included the cryptologic card catalog, derived using the cyclometer that he had invented, and the cryptologic bomb.|$|E
5|$|It {{was in the}} Kabaty Woods, at Pyry, on 25 and 26 July 1939 {{with war}} looming that, on {{instructions}} from the Polish General Staff, the Cipher Bureau's chiefs, Lt. Col. Gwido Langer and Major Maksymilian Ciężki, the three civilian mathematician-cryptologists, and Col. Stefan Mayer, chief of intelligence, revealed Poland's achievements to cryptanalytical representatives of France and Britain, explaining how they had broken Enigma. They undertook to give each country a Polish-reconstructed Enigma, along with details of their equipment, including Zygalski sheets and Rejewski's cryptologic bomb. In return, the British pledged to prepare two full sets of Zygalski sheets for all 60 possible wheel orders. The French contingent consisted of Major Gustave Bertrand, the French radio-intelligence and <b>cryptology</b> chief, and Capt. Henri Braquenié of the French Air Force staff. The British sent Commander Alastair Denniston, head of Britain's Government Code and Cypher School, Dilly Knox, chief British cryptanalyst and Commander Humphrey Sandwith, head of the Royal Navy's intercept and direction-finding stations.|$|E

On 3 June 1939 Section II sent, to army commanders, regulations for covert operations; among other things, it was set down that only those members of a covert unit should know each other who were to carry out practically defined assignments.|$|E
25|$|Cryptography {{prior to}} the modern age was {{effectively}} synonymous with encryption, the conversion of information from a readable state to apparent nonsense. The originator of an encrypted message shared the decoding technique needed to recover the original information only with intended recipients, thereby precluding unwanted persons from doing the same. The cryptography literature often uses the name Alice ("A") for the sender, Bob ("B") for the intended recipient, and Eve ("eavesdropper") for the adversary. Since the development of rotor cipher machines in World WarI {{and the advent of}} computers in World WarII, the methods used to carry out <b>cryptology</b> have become increasingly complex and its application more widespread.|$|E
25|$|Defeating ISIS: Who They Are, How They Fight, What They Believe is a non-fiction {{book about}} counterterrorism against ISIS. It {{was written by}} Malcolm Nance, a former <b>cryptology</b> analyst, with a {{foreword}} by Richard Engel. Nance's thesis in the work is that ISIS {{is not part of}} Islam, and instead functions as destructive extremist group. He emphasizes a majority of those harmed by ISIS are themselves Muslim. The book traces the history of the movement from Al-Qaeda in Iraq, and discusses their combat and recruiting tactics. Nance offers a four-point plan to defeat ISIS, including airpower and special forces, Internet tactics, strengthening the Syrian military, and engaging Arab world states.|$|E

Nance cites the 2003 Iraq war by the Bush Administration for causing regional instability. He criticizes Coalition Provisional Authority leader Paul Bremer. The book emphasizes lessons the U.S. neglected to learn from the Vietnam War, the Iraqi revolt against the British, and the South Lebanon conflict. Nance writes in favor of the Iran nuclear deal framework by the Obama Administration, saying it is in the interests of all parties involved.|$|E
25|$|Terrorist Recognition Handbook: A Practitioner's Manual for Predicting and Identifying Terrorist Activities is a non-fiction {{book about}} counterterrorism strategies, written by U.S. Navy retired <b>cryptology</b> analyst Malcolm Nance. The book is {{intended}} to help law enforcement and intelligence officials with the professional practice of behavior analysis and criminal psychology of anticipating potential terrorists before they commit criminal acts. Nance draws {{from the field of}} traditional criminal analysis to posit that detecting domestic criminals is similar to determining which individuals are likely to commit acts of terrorism. The book provides resources for the law enforcement official including descriptions of devices used for possible bombs, a database of terrorist networks, and a list of references used. Nance gives the reader background on Al-Qaeda tactics, clandestine cell systems and sleeper agents, and terrorist communication methods.|$|E

25|$|Final Report of the Task Force on Combating Terrorist and Foreign Fighter Travel is a non-fiction {{book about}} counterterrorism and foreign fighters in the Syrian and Iraqi Civil Wars by a {{bipartisan}} {{task force of}} the United States House Committee on Homeland Security, with a foreword by <b>cryptology</b> analyst and author Malcolm Nance. The work was released in paperback format in 2016 by Skyhorse Publishing. The report discusses United States citizens leaving their country to gain fighting experience in Iraq and Syria on the battlefield. It notes some linked up with the Syrian Civil War in order to attempt to remove Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad from power, later joining ISIS. According to the work, approximately 4,500 from the Western world left their countries to join ISIS, including over 250 American citizens. The report gives thirty-two recommendations to address the problem, including tactics to stop travels of battlefield soldiers to and from their countries of origin, ways to change executive branch policies, and methods to determine which individuals are planning terrorist activities.|$|E
500|$|In mid-1931, at the Polish General Staff, a Cipher Bureau {{was formed}} by merging the Radio-Intelligence Office (Referat Radiowywiadu) and the Polish-Cryptography Office (Referat Szyfrów Własnych). The Bureau was charged with both {{cryptography}} — the generation, and supervision of the use, of ciphers and codes — and <b>cryptology,</b> the study of ciphers and codes, particularly {{for the purpose of}} [...] "breaking" [...] them.|$|E
500|$|In 1929, {{while the}} Cipher Bureau's {{predecessor}} agency was still headed by Major Franciszek Pokorny (a {{relative of the}} outstanding World War I Austro-Hungarian Army cryptologist, Captain Herman Pokorny), Ciężki, Franciszek Pokorny, and a civilian Bureau associate, Antoni Palluth, taught a secret <b>cryptology</b> course at Poznań University for selected mathematics students. [...] Over ten years later, during World War II while in France, one of the students, Marian Rejewski, would discover that the entire course had been taught from French General Marcel Givièrge's book, Cours de cryptographie (Course of Cryptography), published in 1925.|$|E
500|$|In 1929, {{shortly before}} graduating from university, Rejewski began {{attending}} a secret <b>cryptology</b> course which opened on 15 January, organized for select German-speaking mathematics students by the Polish General Staff's Cipher Bureau {{with the help}} of the Mathematics Institute's Professor Zdzisław Krygowski. [...] The course was conducted off-campus at a military facility and, as Rejewski would discover in France in 1939, [...] "was entirely and literally based" [...] on French General Marcel Givièrge's 1925 book, Cours de cryptographie (Cryptography Course). [...] Rejewski and fellow students Henryk Zygalski and Jerzy Różycki were among the few who could keep up with the course while balancing the demands of their normal studies.|$|E
500|$|On 1 March 1929 Rejewski {{graduated}} with a Master of Philosophy degree in mathematics. A few weeks after graduating, and without having completed the Cipher Bureau's <b>cryptology</b> course, he began {{the first year of}} a two-year actuarial statistics course at Göttingen, Germany. He did not complete the statistics course, because while home for the summer of 1930, he accepted an offer, from Professor Krygowski, of a mathematics teaching assistantship at Poznań University. He also began working part-time for the Cipher Bureau, which by then had set up an outpost at Poznań to decrypt intercepted German radio messages. Rejewski worked some twelve hours a week near the Mathematics Institute in an underground vault referred to puckishly as the [...] "Black Chamber".|$|E
500|$|Rejewski and Zygalski were {{inducted}} as privates {{into the}} Polish Armed Forces on 16 August 1943 and were posted to a Polish Army facility in Boxmoor, cracking German SS and SD hand ciphers. The ciphers were usually {{based on the}} Doppelkassettenverfahren ("double Playfair") system, which the two cryptologists had already worked on in France. British cryptologist Alan Stripp suggests that [...] "Setting them {{to work on the}} Doppelkassetten system was like using racehorses to pull wagons." [...] On 10 October 1943, Rejewski and Zygalski were commissioned second lieutenants; on 1 January 1945 Rejewski, and presumably also Zygalski, were promoted to lieutenant. When Gustave Bertrand fled to England in June 1944, {{he and his wife were}} provided with a house in Boxmoor, a short walk from the Polish radio station and <b>cryptology</b> office, where it seems likely that his collaboration with Rejewski and Zygalski continued.|$|E

2500|$|Cryptography or <b>cryptology</b> (from Greek [...] kryptós, [...] "hidden, secret"; and [...] graphein, [...] "writing", or [...] -logia, [...] "study", respectively) is the {{practice}} and study of techniques for secure communication {{in the presence of}} third parties called adversaries. More generally, cryptography is about constructing and analyzing protocols that prevent third parties or the public from reading private messages; various aspects in information security such as data confidentiality, data integrity, authentication, and non-repudiation are central to modern cryptography. Modern cryptography exists at the intersection of the disciplines of mathematics, computer science, electrical engineering, communication science, and physics. Applications of cryptography include electronic commerce, chip-based payment cards, digital currencies, computer passwords, and military communications.|$|E

This 'trilogie' of tales, of which the later two were [...] "The Purloined Letter" [...] and [...] "The Mystery of Marie Roget," [...] was avowedly written to prove the capability of solving the puzzling riddles of life by identifying another person's mind by our own.

Whilst the public was still pondering over the startling proposition, and enjoying perusal of its apparent proofs, Poe still further increased his popularity and drew attention to his works by putting forward the attractive but less dangerous theorem that [...] "human ingenuity could not construct a cipher which human ingenuity could not solve." ...|$|E
