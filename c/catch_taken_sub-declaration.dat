25|$|After halting its {{commercial}} whaling, Japan began scientific research hunts {{to provide a}} basis for the resumption of sustainable whaling.

500|$|A wicketkeeper {{can assist}} in the {{dismissal}} of a batsman by taking a catch or stumping. A <b>catch</b> <b>taken</b> by the wicketkeeper means the batsman will be ruled out caught, {{although it may be}} referred to as [...] "caught behind".

40|$|We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} estimating a population size from successive <b>catches</b> <b>taken</b> during a removal experiment and propose two estimating functions approaches, the traditional quasi-likelihood (TQL) approach for dependent observations and the conditional quasi-likelihood (CQL) approach using the conditional mean and conditional variance of the catch given previous catches.

25|$|If the <b>catch</b> <b>taken</b> is {{pronounced}} or obvious, the players need not {{appeal to the}} umpire; the batsman normally chooses to acknowledge the dismissal himself. However, {{in the event that}} the ball brushes the edge of the bat, or the <b>catch</b> is <b>taken</b> very close to the ground, or the ball appears to have bounced off the batsman's foot (so it has not touched the ground), or the ball appearing to come off the bat very close to the pitch surface (bump ball), or if the batsman is reluctant to accept that he has been dismissed, the fielding team has to appeal to the umpire for this decision. In international competition, if neither field umpire can clearly decide if a catch has been made or not, they may refer to the third (television) umpire for a review. The third umpire may also be used if the Umpire Decision Review System is available and a team wishes to dispute a call concerning a possible catch.|$|R

50|$|In {{the first}} stage, {{performances}} by Indians in Tests and one-day internationals in the Castrol Cricket Year are rated {{in the following}} categories:Aggregate - Tests / ODIs; Wickets - Tests / ODIs; Batting average - Tests / ODIs; Bowling average - Tests / ODIs; <b>Catches</b> <b>taken</b> - Tests / ODIs.Points are then allotted to each player {{in each of the}} categories in descending order. Thus, the highest scorer in tests gets 10 points, the second-highest gets 9 points, the third-highest gets 8 and so on. Similarly, the highest scorer in one-day internationals gets 10 points, the second highest gets 9 and so on. The same holds for the other categories.|$|R

Our findings, supported by data obtained from plankton/young fish surveys in 1988 and 1989, suggest that in northern waters Todaropsis eblanae generally mates and spawns during late summer and early autumn (June-November). Successful hatching events appear to occur during October-March, producing juvenile (stage I) squid {{in the early part}} of the year (January-June).
