5000|$|Variable Montage was a 3-screen {{computational}} and algorithmic cinema installation {{created with}} Didi Fire and {{exhibited in the}} Distributive film category at Future Cinema - The Cinematic Imaginary After Film, a group exhibition curated by Jeffrey Shaw and Peter Weibel. Variable Montage in the Future Cinema exhibition was on display during 2002-2003 at Zentrum für Kunst und Medientechnologie (ZKM), Karlsruhe, Germany, then at NTT InterCommunication Center (ICC), Tokyo during 2003-2004. [...] In Variable Montage, Lafia and Fire explored the migration of montage as a precise narrative grammatical device practiced by traditional cineastes to its infinitely variable form, when generated by computation, which becomes a montage that is more about construction than narration. The computationally directed image could travel a trajectory of continuous iteration, from which an excess of possibilities could emerge from such continual play, possibilities for ‘surprise, coincidence, deformation, collision, and ambiguity.’ Variable Montage marks the first prominence of Lafia’s conception of the ‘software as projector’ whereby the software functions ‘simultaneously as a playback and authoring machine’ {{in contrast to the}} reel-to-reel film projector that performs a single projection at a fixed frame rate. Lafia writes in the text about Variable Montage that accompanied its exhibition in Future Cinema: “Variable Montage is as much an engine or structure for possible films as it is a film per se ... In <b>computational</b> <b>imaging,</b> time and sequence take on an entirely new sense, perhaps it is the difference of becoming rather than unfolding, where each time through the engine of computation a film becomes, revealing something essential about computation as an engine of possibility and something about cinema as a fixed machine of the particular.” ...|$|E
