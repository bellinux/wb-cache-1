In 2006 - 2007 in Tehran province 3007427 livestock were slaughtered consist of sheep, goat, cow and camel which 2. 93 percent of them were total condemned due to parasitic effects and also we found about 9 percent of total <b>condemned</b> <b>carcass</b> in slaughterhouses were rejected because of parasitic diseases. Most of totally condemned carcasses were sheep and the main parasitic agent in rejected sheep recognized sarcocyst.

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to {{determine}} the phylogenetic groups of E. coli strains isolated from seemingly healthy broiler and broiler condemned suspected of colibacillosis in a Brazilian slaughterhouse. Samples from respiratory tract and edible giblets (liver and heart) of broilers with and without macroscopic lesions of colibacillosis were collected at slaughter. There were 84 strains isolated from broilers condemned of which 11 were obtained from swabs of the heart, 7 from the liver, and 66 from the respiratory tract. Of the 53 E. coli strains isolated from broilers not condemned, 5 were isolated from the heart, 4 from the liver, and 44 from the respiratory tract. E coli strains were tested via PCR for phylogenetic groups A, B 1, B 2, C, D, E, and F. Phylogroups A and B 1 were the most common phylogroups of E. coli obtained from healthy and sick-appearing broiler carcasses. The results of the study showed that phylogroups B 2 and E were associated with the heart samples and phylogroup A was associated with respiratory tract samples, phylogroup B 1 with not <b>condemned</b> <b>carcass,</b> and phylogroup D with liver samples...|$|E
40|$|An {{epidemiological}} {{study was conducted}} to assess the rates of condemnation and the diagnoses made on <b>condemned</b> broiler chicken <b>carcasses</b> in a federally-inspected abattoir. The first objective was to determine the predictive value of a positive test: the proportion of birds that were truly unfit for human consumption among <b>condemned</b> <b>carcasses.</b> The second objective was to assess the degree of agreement between diagnoses made in the abattoir and diagnoses determined by a detailed gross postmortem examination on the same <b>condemned</b> <b>carcasses.</b> A two-stage convenience sampling technique was used to obtain the birds needed. Fifteen lots of birds were selected and within each of these, approximately 45 <b>condemned</b> <b>carcasses</b> were selected for a total of 680. All the diagnoses made on these birds at the abattoir were recorded and the carcasses individually identified. The sampled carcasses were transported to the Ontario Veterinary College where a panel of three federal veterinarians independently judged whether the birds were fit for human consumption. In addition, a detailed gross postmortem examination was conducted on each carcass. An overall predictive value of a positive test of approximately 70 % was found. The degree of agreement among members of the panel of examiners was also tested. The overall agreement was good (Kappa = 0. 62 between examiners 1 and 2 and 0. 51 between examiners 1 and 3). However, <b>carcasses</b> <b>condemned</b> for specific conditions at the abattoir, namely valgus varus deformity, mutilation, cellulitis and hepatitis showed no agreement beyond chance, while other <b>carcasses</b> <b>condemned</b> for conditions such as cyanosis and bruising showed poor agreement concerning their disposition for at least one pair of examiners.

40|$|Mycobacteriosis in swine is {{a common}} {{zoonosis}} found in abattoirs during meat inspections, and the veterinary authority is expected to inform the producer for corrective actions when an outbreak is detected. The expected value {{of the number of}} <b>condemned</b> <b>carcasses</b> due to mycobacteriosis therefore would be a useful threshold to detect an outbreak, and the present study aims to develop such an expected value through time series modeling. The model was developed using eight years of inspection data (2003 to 2010) obtained at 2 abattoirs of the Higashi-Mokoto Meat Inspection Center, Japan. The resulting model was validated by comparing the predicted time-dependent values for the subsequent 2 years with the actual data for 2 years between 2011 and 2012. For the modeling, at first, periodicities were checked using Fast Fourier Transformation, and the ensemble average profiles for weekly periodicities were calculated. An Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model was fitted to the residual of the ensemble average on the basis of minimum Akaikeâ€™s information criterion (AIC). The sum of the ARIMA model and the weekly ensemble average was regarded as the time-dependent expected value. During 2011 and 2012, the number of whole or partial <b>condemned</b> <b>carcasses</b> exceeded the 95 % confidence interval of the predicted values 20 times. All of these events were associated with the slaughtering of pigs from three producers with the highest rate of condemnation due to mycobacteriosis. Peer Revie...|$|R

40|$|Skeletal muscle, diaphragm, tongue, {{esophagus}} {{and heart}} of beef <b>carcasses</b> that were <b>condemned</b> for eosinophilic myositis {{and those that}} were unaffected were collected at an abattoir in Colorado and studied to determine the involvement of Sarcocystis spp. All affected carcasses contained similar granulomatous lesions with adjacent infiltrations of leukocytes. Intact or fragments of sarcocysts were found within 32 of 363 granulomas, and whole sarcocysts were present in nearby unaffected muscle cells. Light and electron microscopic examinations revealed that sarcocysts, affected or unaffected by cellular response in <b>condemned</b> <b>carcasses,</b> {{as well as those}} found in unaffected carcasses, were consistent with those of S. cruzi. Transmission experiments confirmed that S. cruzi were present in all carcasses, and that dogs, but not cats, were the definitive hosts.

No treatment differences in body weight (P>. 05) were observed, and all chicks averaged 166, 421, and 788 g at 1, 2, and 3 wk of age, respectively. Weight gain and feed consumption were not affected by the experimental diets (P>. 05). Birds fed the control diet had better overall feed conversion (1. 24) than birds fed the diet containing 20 % extruded barley and PBP (1. 37) (P <. 05). Feeding PBP extruded with cassava (10 and 20 %) or barley (10 %) resulted in equal broiler performance at less cost than birds fed the control diet. In a second experiment, 10 % sucrose was mixed with PBP by weight and ensiled for 7 d at ambient temperatures in an anaerobic vessel.

40|$|A {{cross-sectional}} study on Lumpy Skin Disease (LSD) {{was conducted at}} Ismailia Abattoir, Egypt for determining the prevalence of LSD in cattle. The results showed that summer represented the highest season for slaughtering of the cattle (5468 animal) followed by autumn (4367) then spring (3421), and winter (2988). Out of 10055 slaughtered cattle, 101 male (1. 0 %) and 14 female (0. 1 %) that presented lesions diagnosed as specific LSD lesions. There was statistically difference (P> 0. 05) in prevalence of LSD in cattle between seasons. LSD could not be reported in buffaloes or calves. The highest prevalence of LSD in male cattle was observed in autumn 53 (2. 01 %) followed by winter 30 (1. 7 %), summer 18 (0. 5 %). Similarly, the highest prevalence of LSD in female cattle was observed in autumn 7 (0. 3 %) followed by winter 5 (0. 2 %), summer 2 (0. 1 %). Histopathological examination of the suspected samples revealed presence of ballooning degeneration and intracytoplasmic inclusion bodies characteristic of LSD. The estimated annual loss from <b>condemn</b> <b>carcasses</b> was 13770 Egyptian Pound.

40|$|ABSTRACT Tuberculosis {{remains as}} the worldâ€™s biggest threat. In 2014, human {{tuberculosis}} ranked {{as a major}} infectious disease by the first time, overcoming HIV death rates. Bovine tuberculosis is a chronic disease of global distribution that affects animals and can be transmitted to humans by the consumption of raw milk, representing a serious public health concern. Despite the efforts of different countries to control and eradicate bovine tuberculosis, the high negative economic impact on meat and milk production chains remains, given the decreased production efficiency (approximately 25 %), {{the high number of}} <b>condemned</b> <b>carcasses,</b> and increased animal culling rates. This scenario has motivated the establishment of official programs based on regulations and diagnostic procedures. Although Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Mycobacterium bovis are the major pathogenic species to humans and bovines, respectively, nontuberculous mycobacteria within the Mycobacterium genus have become increasingly important in recent decades due to human infections, including the ones that occur in immunocompetent people. Diagnosis of mycobacteria can be performed by microbiological culture from tissue samples (lymph nodes, lungs) and secretions (sputum, milk). In general, these pathogens demand special nutrient requirements for isolation/growth, and the use of selective and rich culture media. Indeed, within these genera, mycobacteria are classified as either fast- or slow-growth microorganisms. Regarding the latter ones, incubation times can vary from 45 to 90 days. Although microbiological culture is still considered the gold standard method for diagnosis, molecular approaches have been increasingly used. We describe here an overview of the diagnosis of Mycobacterium species in bovine milk...|$|R

Interviews and observations were used to collect data. The study found that manpower, handling the medical waste, were not trained to do the job. Storage before collection for disposal was done in a haphazard manner. An open truck was being used to carry wastes for disposal. The disposal site was not appropriate for medical wastes, as its initial purpose was to handle <b>condemned</b> cattle <b>carcasses</b> from the abattoir. The incinerators at the disposal site were not functional and low heat sources were being used to burn wastes.

40|$|Calves {{slaughtered}} {{for bobby}} veal in New Zealand {{are considered a}} public health risk if "acute inflammation of the umbilicus" is present at slaughter, because {{it is believed that}} the consumption of veal derived from these calves may subsequently "cause food-poisoning" as a result of bacterial dissemination throughout the carcass. This belief, however, has not been fully validated. During the 1989 season, 54 calves were condemned for "navel ill" (0. 465 % of the total slaughtered) at Waitaki International's Feilding export slaughterhouse. Carcasses from these calves, along with 31 normal carcasses, were examined for the presence of septicaemia (Part I). The study involved the detailed gross examination of the carcass and viscera, together with microbiological examination of umbilical vein, liver and muscle, and histopathological examination of the umbilical vein, liver, and kidney. The working definition of septicaemia {{for the purposes of this}} study was the presence of large numbers of bacteria in the general circulation, involving slight or absent clinical signs and with or without gross evidence of early systemic infection in the carcass. Bacteraemia was defined as the presence of smaller numbers of bacteria in the general circulation, with or without gross evidence of localisation in the carcass. Although differing from the several definitions, particularly of septicaemia, in the literature, these were proposed as appropriate definitions in the context of the slaughterhouse. The presence or absence of septicaemia was determined on the basis of the combined gross lesions in the carcass, histopathological lesions in the liver and kidney, and microbial isolates from the liver and carcass musculature. The presence of infection extending from the umbilicus was determined by histopathological and microbiological examination of the umbilical vein near the liver. "Navel ill" could be sub-classified into three categories: (1) Umbilical vessel infection and carcass lesions indicative of systemic spread, with or without umbilical infection. (2) Umbilical vessel infection, with or without umbilical infection. (3) Umbilical infection alone. Three <b>carcasses</b> <b>condemned</b> for "navel ill" had no abnormalities of the umbilicus or umbilical vessels. Of the remaining 51 carcasses, one (2 %) had gross, histological and microbiological evidence of septicaemia, and seventeen (33 %) had lesions indicative of bacteraemia or septicaemia. The proportion of <b>condemned</b> <b>carcasses</b> which were bacteraemic decreased as the condemnation criteria expanded to include all three categories of "navel ill". There was a significant risk of bacteraemia in carcasses from ail sub-categories of "navel ill", except category (3), when compared with normal carcasses. Insufficient data were generated to allow assessment of the risk of septicaemia being present in carcasses from calves with "navel ill". A second study was undertaken later in the 1989 season, and involved the detailed gross examination and description of 371 calves condemned for any reason at six export slaughterhouses; five in the North Island and one in the South Island. The major disease entities found in calves of this age and resulting in carcass condemnations were "navel ill" (197 (0. 50 %) carcasses), pneumonia (75 (0. 19 %) carcasses), arthritis (31 (0. 08 %) carcasses, and "white spotted kidneys" (30 (0. 08 %) carcasses). Peritonitis, jaundice, hepatic abscesses and "fever" occurred at very low rates (< 0. 03 %), while other lesions occurred sporadically. The current inspection system in New Zealand requires calves with "acute inflammatory lesions" to be condemned. In this study, this requirement resulted in the condemnation of virtually all diseased calves, whether the disease was acute, chronic, generalised, localised or non-infectious in nature. There was, however, considerable variation found in the severity, age and likely pathogenesis of the lesions in each disease category. Because this "blanket" approach to disease in the bobby calf leads to unnecessary condemnation and wastage, it is suggested that more appropriate judgement criteria such as the trimming of localised infectious and traumatic lesions should be considered...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{slaughterhouse}} is {{a central}} processing point for food animals and thus a source of both demographic data (age, breed, sex) and health-related data (reason for condemnation and condemned portions) that are not available through other sources. Using these data for syndromic surveillance is therefore tempting. However many possible reasons for condemnation and condemned portions exist, making the definition of relevant syndromes challenging. The objective {{of this study was}} to determine a typology of cattle with at least one portion of the <b>carcass</b> <b>condemned</b> in order to define syndromes. Multiple factor analysis (MFA) in combination with clustering methods was performed using both health-related data and demographic data. RESULTS: Analyses were performed on 381, 186 cattle with at least one portion of the <b>carcass</b> <b>condemned</b> among the 1, 937, 917 cattle slaughtered in ten French abattoirs. Results of the MFA and clustering methods led to 12 clusters considered as stable according to year of slaughter and slaughterhouse. One cluster was specific to a disease of public health importance (cysticercosis). Two clusters were linked to the slaughtering process (fecal contamination of heart or lungs and deterioration lesions). Two clusters respectively characterized by chronic liver lesions and chronic peritonitis could be linked to diseases of economic importance to farmers. Three clusters could be linked respectively to reticulo-pericarditis, fatty liver syndrome and farmer's lung syndrome, which are related to both diseases of economic importance to farmers and herd management issues. Three clusters respectively characterized by arthritis, myopathy and Dark Firm Dry (DFD) meat could notably be linked to animal welfare issues. Finally, one cluster, characterized by bronchopneumonia, could be linked to both animal health and herd management issues. CONCLUSION: The statistical approach of combining multiple factor analysis with cluster analysis showed its relevance for the detection of syndromes using available large and complex slaughterhouse data. The advantages of this statistical approach are to i) define groups of reasons for condemnation based on meat inspection data, ii) help grouping reasons for condemnation among a list of various possible reasons for condemnation for which a consensus among experts could be difficult to reach, iii) assign each animal to a single syndrome which allows the detection of changes in trends of syndromes to detect unusual patterns in known diseases and emergence of new diseases...|$|R
40|$|The {{use of an}} {{electronic}} identification (EID) system in slaughter facilities holds great potential {{as a tool for}} animal and carcass traceability, if used as part of a comprehensive carcass tracking system. However, the correct association of each carcass with its individual EID tag number may be hindered at several points during the slaughter process. For 2, 994 cattle slaughtered in 14 lots and bearing buttontype, full duplex EID ear tags, 113 (3. 92 %) had non-functional tags, 16 (0. 53 %) had no tag, and 37 extra head were introduced accidentally into one of our lots.

40|$|The {{study was}} {{conducted}} from December to April 2007 / 2008 in Hashimâ€™s Ethiopian Livestock and Meat Export (HELIMEX) abattoir at Debre Zeit, Luna and Modjo modern export abattoirs at modjo. The {{aim of this study}} was to identify and determine the major diseases of organ and carcass condemnation and to estimate the magnitude of the direct losses attributed to the <b>condemned</b> organs and <b>carcasses</b> from sheep and goats slaughtered in the abattoirs. Standard antemortem and postmortem inspection procedures were followed through out the study. Antemortem inspection was carried out in the lairage and abnormalities encountered were recorded, followed by postmortem examination through their identification number to detect gross abnormalities and aesthetic reasons that rendered each organ to be rejected from local and international market. During the study a total of 229 sheep and goats and 229 organs and carcasses were examined. The study revealed that 176 (76. 8 %) livers, 141 (61. 5 %) lungs, 47 (20. 5 %) hearts, 32 (27. 5 %) kidneys 27 (11. 8 %) brain and 28 (12. 2 %) carcasses were rejected due to various causes.

40|$|The second beef {{quality audit}} was {{conducted}} in Canada in 1998 - 99 to determine the prevalence of quality defects in slaughtered cattle and to monitor changes since the first audit in 1995. Approximately 0. 6 % {{of the number of}} cattle processed annually in Canada were evaluated. Brands were observed on 49 % and tag was observed on 43 % of the hides. Both brands and tag had increased from 1995. Seventy percent of the cattle were polled and 5 % had full horns; thus, the number of horned cattle had decreased from 1995. Bruises were found on 54 % of the carcasses, which was a decrease from 78 % in 1995. Sixty-eight percent of the bruises were minor, 28 % major, and 4 % critical in severity. The distribution of bruises on the carcass was 17 % on the chuck, 36 % on the rib, 30 % on the loin, and 16 % on the round. Grubs were observed on 0. 008 % of the carcasses, and surface injection site lesions were observed on 0. 2 % of the whole carcasses, a decrease from the 1. 3 % seen in 1995. Seventy-two percent of the livers were passed for human food and 14 % for pet food; 14 % were condemned. Approximately 64 % of the liver losses were due to abscesses. Five percent of the heads and tongues and 0. 3 % of the whole <b>carcasses</b> were <b>condemned.</b> The hot <b>carcass</b> weight was highly variable in all cattle, averaging 353 kg (s = 43). The average ribeye area was 90 cm 2 (s = 13). Both hot carcass weight and ribeye area had increased from 1995. The average grade fat was 9 mm (s = 5), ranging from 0 mm to 48 mm. Lean meat yield averaged 58. 8 % (s = 4. 6). One percent of the carcasses were devoid of marbling, 17 % were Canada A, 49 % were Canada AA, 32 % were Canada AAA, and 1 % were Canada Prime, which was an increase in marbling from 1995. Dark cutters were found in 1 % of all carcasses; 1 % of steers, 0. 5 % of heifers, 3 % of cows, and 14 % of bulls. Three percent of the carcasses were underfinished and 13 % were overfinished. The number of overfinished carcasses had increased from 1995. Stages, steers with bullish traits, were infrequently observed in 0. 5 % of the steers, and 0. 2 % of the steers and 0. 3 % of the heifers had poor conformation. Yellow fat was not observed in any steers or heifers, but it was found on 65 % of the cow carcasses. Only 0. 6 % of the heifers had an aged carcass, based on skeletal maturity. Based on August 1998 to July 1999 prices, it was estimated that the Canadian beef industry lost $ 82. 62 per head processed, or $ 274 million annually, from quality nonconformities, which was an increase from 1995.

The analysis of official meat inspection statistics from one slaughterhouse covering the years from 1994 to 2000 showed that 4. 45 % of all <b>condemned</b> pig slaughter <b>carcasses</b> were classified as not suitable for human consumption due to the diagnosis of jaundice. In the visual inspection directly after slaughtering 11. 57 % were judged as false positive results. After confiscation for 24 hours this judgement was corrected in a repeated inspection of the carcasses. The analysis showed, that jaundice presents an important proportion of the condemnations, these justifying the development and testing of an objective method for jaundice diagnosis. Spectrophotometry and colorimetry by tristumulus measurement are the present objective methods for colorimetry. Both methods were tested for use in the diagnosis of jaundice. The spectrophotometrical investigations were carried out using the Shimadzu Spectrophotometer CM 100. The colorimetrical measurements were made with the Minolta Chromameter CR 300. In pre-tests for spectrophotometry the samples of pigments to be investigated were prepared following the General Administrative Order for Meat Hygiene (AVVFlH) using the alcohol-ether-test-kit. Spectrophotometry allows to differentiate the two-peak-spectra of carotins from the one-peak-spectra of bile-pigments. As the preparation of samples involves costs and time the spectrophotometry is not suitable {{for the development of a}} fast test. However it is possible to objectify the official method by exact measurement of solutions in alcohol-ether-tests. In pre-tests with the Minolta Chromameter CR 300 was found that it is possible to differentiate the pigments by colorimetry very fast and without laboratory peparation. In fat tissues of 54 fattened sows, 54 fattened castrated males and 54 breeding sows, wich were suitable for human consumption, different color-parameters (L*a*b* and L*C*HÂ°) in these diffent groups could be demonstated. From parameters of fattened sows and castrated males a color standard of pig fat tissue (mean Â± standarddeviation) was calculated: L* = 67, 81 Â± 2, 55; a* = 2, 43 Â± 0, 66; b* = 2, 93 Â± 0, 69; C* = 3, 85 Â± 0, 76; H* = 50, 18 Â± 8, 78 In subsequent investigations the fat tissues of 54 uncastrated males, including cryptorchids and hermaphrodites were measured. These fat tissues with a brightness parameter of L* = 78, 85 were brighter than suitable fat tissue. There a differentiation is possible. The colorimetrical investigation of 54 slaughter carcasses with jaundice showed, that icteric pig fat is different from suitable pig fat in all color-parameters (mean Â± standarddeviation) : L* = 77, 24 Â± 3, 05; a* = 0, 92 Â± 1, 14; b* = 8, 48 Â± 3, 00; C* = 8, 64 Â± 3, 00; HÂ° = 82, 83 Â± 9, 36 Only the fat of uncastrated males is similar in brightness L*. By using the colorimetry as fast test for the diagnosis of jaundice limits for brightness L* = 72, 3 and yellowness b 1 * = 4. 6 (with identification of uncastrated males) or b 2 * = 5 (without identification of males) were calculated. It showed that jaundice is present when the color parameters are higher than both limits. The colorimetry using the Minolta Chromameter CR 300 in combination with the calculated limits is useful as fast test in pig fat for the diagnosis of jaundice in fresh slaughtered carcasses. Further investigations showed the influences of technological factors such as time, cooling and residues of slaugtering on fat color. <br /...|$|R
