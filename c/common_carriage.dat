50|$|The tank {{suspension}} {{was composed}} of 17 twin small diameter rollers, an idler at the front, and rear driving sprocket. The 1st and 17th road wheels had individual suspension, the three middle rollers connected to the <b>common</b> <b>carriage,</b> and the remaining pairs were in 6 bogies. To facilitate {{the management of the}} tank, {{as in the case of}} TG, Grotte decided to apply an electric transmission and servo control that, although increasing the ergonomics of the tank, further complicated the suspension and raised its cost.|$|E
50|$|During {{the reign}} of Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor carried out a major {{refurbishment}} of the public or royal gates of the Walls to integrate them into the widening promoted by the monarch in the cities and towns, {{in order to facilitate}} the transit of such <b>common</b> <b>carriages</b> in the period. These renovations affected the Puerta de Carmona, that the Puerta de la Carne, the Puerta Real, the Puerta del Arenal, the Postigo del Aceite, where Benvenuto Tortello made works in 1572, and Postigo del Carbón, which was moved from the beginning from the calle Santander until the end of it, as happened with the Puerta de Triana, originally on calle Zaragoza, which was transferred in 1585 farther north, at the confluence of that calle with de San Pablo.|$|R
5000|$|Horseless {{carriage}} is a {{term for}} early automobiles; {{at the time it}} was <b>common</b> that <b>carriages</b> were pulled by animals, typically horses, but the automobiles were not. In 2010, the term was compared to other transitional terms, like cordless phone and wireless phone. These are cases in which a new technology is described by what it does not have, compared to an older technology.|$|R
50|$|A vis-à-vis is a {{carriage}} {{in which the}} passengers sit {{face to face with}} the front passengers facing rearward and the rear passengers facing forward. The term comes from the French vis-à-vis, meaning face to face. These carriages are still commonly made by Amish carriage makers in the midwestern United States. Also in the Western world, the vis-a-vis is the most <b>common</b> type of <b>carriage</b> style used to cart tourists and leisure seekers in downtown urban settings.|$|R

50|$|The U.S. Shipping Act, {{was signed}} into law by President Ronald Reagan on March 20, 1984. The purpose of the Act was to: (1) {{establish}} a nondiscriminatory regulatory process for the <b>common</b> <b>carriage</b> of goods by water in the foreign commerce of the United States with a minimum of government intervention and regulatory costs; (2) provide an efficient and economic transportation system in the ocean commerce of the United States that is, insofar as possible, in harmony with, and responsive to, international shipping practices; (3) encourage the development of an economically sound and efficient liner fleet of vessels of the United States capable of meeting national security needs; and (4) promote the growth and development of United States exports through competitive and efficient ocean transportation and by placing a greater reliance on the marketplace.|$|E
5000|$|An {{alternate}} position was proposed in 2010 by then-FCC Commissioner Julius Genachowski, which would narrowly reclassify Internet access as a telecommunication service under Title Two of the Communications Act of 1934. It would apply only six common carrier rules under the legal principle of [...] that would sufficiently prevent unreasonable discrimination and mandate reasonable net neutrality policies under {{the concept of}} <b>common</b> <b>carriage.</b> Incumbent ISP AT&T opposed the idea saying that common carrier regulations would [...] "cram today's broadband Internet access providers into an ill-fitting 20th century regulatory silo" [...] while Google supported the FCC proposal [...] "In particular, the Third Way will promote legal certainty and regulatory predictability to spur investment, ensure that the Commission can fulfill the tremendous promise of the National Broadband Plan, and {{make it possible for}} the Commission to protect and serve all broadband users, including through meaningful enforcement".|$|E
5000|$|In <b>common</b> with <b>carriages</b> and railway locomotives, most early motor {{vehicles}} used leaf springs. One {{of the features}} of these springs was that the friction between the leaves offered a degree of damping, and in a 1912 review of vehicle suspension the lack of this characteristic in helical springs was the reason it was [...] "impossible" [...] to use them as main springs. However the amount of damping provided by leaf spring friction was limited and variable according to the conditions of the springs, and whether wet or dry. It also operated in both directions. Motorcycle front suspension adopted coil sprung Druid forks from about 1906, and similar designs later added rotary friction dampers, which damped both ways - but they were adjustable (e.g. 1924 Webb forks). These friction disk shock absorbers were also fitted to many cars.|$|R
40|$|Objectives Recent {{development}} of serogroup B meningococcal (MenB) vaccines {{highlights the importance}} of pharyngeal carriage data, particularly in adolescents and young adults, to inform implementation strategies. We describe current UK carriage prevalence in this high risk population and compare methods of carriage detection. Methods In this multisite study, pharyngeal swabs were collected on 3 – 4 occasions over 6 – 12 months, from 1040 school and university students, aged 10 – 25 years. Meningococcal carriage was detected by standard culture combined with seroagglutination or PCR of cultured isolates, or by direct PCR from swab. The factor H binding protein (fHBP) variants present in meningococcal isolates were determined. Results Meningococcal serogroups B and Y were most <b>common,</b> with <b>carriage</b> up to 6. 5 % and 5. 5 % respectively, increasing throughout adolescence. Identification by seroagglutination was often unreliable, and the sensitivity of direct PCR detection was 66 % compared to culture combined with PCR. Of MenB isolates, 89. 1 % had subfamily A variants of fHBP. The acquisition rate of MenB carriage was estimated at 2. 8 per 1000 person-months. Conclusions If vaccination is to precede the adolescent rise in MenB carriage, these data suggest it should take place in early adolescence. Studies assessing vaccine impact should use molecular methods to detect carriage...|$|R
40|$|The {{polysaccharide}} capsule of Streptococcus pneumoniae inhibits phagocytic killing by innate immune mech-anisms. Certain serotypes {{are associated with}} invasive disease while others with a nasopharyngeal carriage. The invasiveness of serotypes may partly be explained by ability to resist deposition of complement (C 3) on the bacterial surface and consequent opsonophagocytic killing. In our previous studies, we observed that clinical isolates of serotypes 1 and 5, which are rarely detected in asymptomatic carriage, were resistant to complement deposition and opsonophagocytosis, whereas serotypes 6 B and 23 F, both <b>common</b> in <b>carriage,</b> were more sensitive to deposition of C 3 and opsonophagocytic killing. However, presence of significant variation in C 3 deposition between isolates of the same serotype indicated that factors other than the capsule also affect complement resistance. To distinguish the relative effect of the capsular serotype and other virulence factors on C 3 deposition, we compared capsule-switched mutants prepared in genetic backgrounds of pneumococcal strains TIGR 4, 603, and 618. Clinical isolates which had the same multilocus sequence type but expressed different serotypes were also compared. We found that the serotype {{had a significant impact}} on complement resistance and that the more resistant the strain was to complement, the higher was the concentration of polysaccharide-specific antibodies required for opsonophagocytic killing. Comparison of strains expressing the same capsular polysaccharides in the different genetic backgrounds and various capsular mutants of the sam...|$|R
50|$|The 7-inch and 8-inch {{guns and}} 12-inch mortars used a <b>common</b> <b>carriage,</b> with a {{depressed}} center and two 4-wheel or 6-wheel bogies. The bogies were interchangeable for standard-gauge or (with 12-wheel bogies) 60-cm (23.6-inch) gauge track. Outriggers and a rotating mount allowed all-around fire. This allowed the weapons {{to be used}} in coast defense against moving targets. The 8-inch guns and 12-inch mortars were retained on railway mountings after the war, while almost all of the 7-inch, 10-inch, and 12-inch guns were returned to the coastal forts. With 47 available, plus an additional 24 ex-Navy Mark VI guns on railway mounts by 1942, the 8-inch guns were the most commonly deployed US railway gun through World War II. Approximately a dozen of these were used for the defense of Oahu, Hawaii. Others were stationed for the coastal defense of Manila (eventually dismounted from the railway carriage at Corregidor), Bermuda, Puget Sound, Chesapeake Bay, Delaware Bay, and Fort Hancock, New Jersey (near New York City).|$|E
50|$|To shorten a long story, none {{of these}} weapons were shipped to France except three 8-inch guns, as few of any type were {{completed}} before the Armistice. Forty-seven 8-inch railway guns were ordered, with 18 completed by the Armistice and the remainder completed later. Eight 10-inch railway mounts of 54 ordered were completed by this time, and twelve 12-inch railway mounts were completed by 1 April 1919. Three railway mountings for the Chilean 12-inch guns were ready for shipment by the Armistice; the remaining three barrels were retained as spares. Ninety-one 12-inch railway mortars were ordered, with 45 complete by 7 April 1919 and all major components of the remainder also complete. It is unclear how many additional railway guns and mortars were completed, but all 47 8-inch weapons and probably the 91 12-inch mortars were. The 7-inch and 8-inch guns and 12-inch mortars used a <b>common</b> <b>carriage,</b> with outriggers and a rotating mount allowing all-around fire. This allowed the weapons {{to be used in}} coast defense against moving targets.|$|E
50|$|After the American {{entry into}} World War I, the United States needed a medium-range heavy {{artillery}} piece {{that could be}} transported easily. The quick solution {{was to take the}} existing 8-inch coast artillery guns from the fixed mountings or from storage and mount them on a drop bed rail car. This was also done with a number of other weapons, including 10 in guns, 12 in guns, and 12-inch mortars. The 7 in guns, 8-inch guns, and 12-inch mortars used a <b>common</b> <b>carriage,</b> with a depressed center and two 4-wheel or 6-wheel bogies. The bogies were interchangeable for standard gauge or (with 12-wheel bogies) 60 cm gauge track. Outriggers and a rotating mount allowed all-around fire. This allowed the weapons to be used in coast defense against moving targets. A detailed description of the railway mounting is given in Railway Artillery, Vol. I by Lt. Col. H. W. Miller, USA. A total of 96 8-inch guns (reportedly including spare Navy Marks 1 through 4 as well as M1888 guns) were considered available for railway mounting, and 47 were ordered to be mounted on railcars. Twenty-four were produced before the Armistice, and three of these had been shipped to France by that time. These three were the only US Army railway guns shipped to France in World War I, although five US Navy 14"/50 caliber railway guns (356 mm) saw action.|$|E
40|$|Background The pneumococcus is {{a diverse}} {{pathogen}} whose primary niche is the nasopharynx. Over 90 different serotypes exist, and nasopharyngeal carriage of multiple serotypes is <b>common.</b> Understanding pneumococcal <b>carriage</b> {{is essential for}} evaluating the impact of pneumococ-cal vaccines. Traditional serotyping methods are cumbersome and insufficient for detecting multiple serotype carriage, and there are few data comparing the new methods {{that have been developed}} over the past decade. We established the PneuCarriage project, a large, international multi-centre study dedicated to the identification of the best pneumococcal ser-otyping methods for carriage studies. Methods and Findings Reference sample sets were distributed to 15 research groups for blinded testing. Twenty pneumococcal serotyping methods were used to test 81 laboratory-prepared (spiked) sam-ples. The five top-performing methods were used to test 260 nasopharyngeal (field) sam-ples collected from children in six high-burden countries. Sensitivity and positive predictiv...|$|R

5000|$|Private hire {{is a term}} {{applied to}} a taxi that must be pre-booked, usually by {{telephone}} but also in some cases by fax, email or via in-car radio. Although not available on a hail, properly licensed private hire vehicles can offer a safe alternative to a 'Hackney Carriage'. The advantage of a private hire booking is that the journey is offered at a fixed price based only on mileage and not the variable time element of a taximeter found in a 'Hackney Carriage' unless the private hire vehicle is fitted with a taximeter in which case this meter must be {{used to calculate the}} fare. In many areas private hire and hackney vehicles have different coloured taxi licence plates; and also it is <b>common</b> that hackney <b>carriages</b> must be a certain colour (usually black, hence the term [...] "black cab"), while private hire taxis may be any colour but that prescribed for hackneys.|$|R
50|$|The U.S. {{state and}} federal governments have been {{involved}} in electronic messaging and the development of email in several different ways. Starting in 1977, the U.S. Postal Service (USPS) recognized that electronic messaging and electronic transactions posed a significant threat to First Class mail volumes and revenue. The USPS explored an electronic messaging initiative in 1977 and later disbanded it. Twenty years later, in 1997, when email volume overtook postal mail volume, the USPS was again urged to embrace email, and the USPS declined to provide email as a service. The USPS initiated an experimental email service known as E-COM. E-COM provided a method for the simple exchange of text messages. In 2011, shortly after the USPS reported its state of financial bankruptcy, the USPS Office of Inspector General (OIG) began exploring the possibilities of generating revenue through email servicing. Electronic messages were transmitted to a post office, printed out, and delivered as hard copy. To take advantage of the service, an individual had to transmit at least 200 messages. The delivery time of the messages was the same as First Class mail and cost 26 cents. Both the Postal Regulatory Commission and the Federal Communications Commission opposed E-COM. The FCC concluded that E-COM constituted <b>common</b> <b>carriage</b> under its jurisdiction and the USPS would have to file a tariff. Three years after initiating the service, USPS canceled E-COM and attempted to sell it off.|$|E
5000|$|It was {{not until}} the Internet began its rapid {{evolution}} that tiered services became a controversial issue. And it {{was not until}} the early 2000s that Internet carriers considered the option of abandoning net neutrality policies. In 2005, the FCC changed the way Broadband service providers are regulated. This made Broadband service providers [...] "information services" [...] instead of [...] "telecommunications services". This means Broadband service providers are no longer subject to Common carrier Regulations. [...] Since the beginning of the twentieth century, <b>common</b> <b>carriage</b> guidelines required the quality of service must be the same for all, preventing one customer from being favored over another. During the first decades of the 1900s, this policy related directly to the telephone industry, and AT&T specifically. However, in recent decades, the policy has grown to encompass a broader range of communication services. Preventing preferential treatment of customers in the realm of the internet is referred to as the policy of Net Neutrality. Former chairman of the FCC Michael Powell considered net neutrality to be fundamental to the success of the Internet and even one of the basic rules to maintaining freedom on the Internet. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) continued its skepticism of tiered pricing for quite some time, and it was not until concerns about the availability of the spectrum began to surface that things began to change. FCC Chairman Julius Genachowski announced in 2010 that the benefits of tiered pricing include helping to prevent data backups on networks. Genachowski expressed his fear of a coming [...] "spectrum crisis" [...] as a result of the increase in smartphone usage ultimately clogging carrier networks. The FCC suggested a number of solutions to the problem including greater use of the unlicensed Wi-Fi spectrum, more femtocells, and more efficient arrangement of cell towers, but even these measures were not believed to be enough to keep spectrum bands open. Attempts have been made to put price controls on tiered service. United States Congress put a bill forth to prevent a [...] "two-tiered pricing scheme with priority service." [...] The bill did not pass congress, but allowed the FCC to stop ISPs from blocking websites.|$|E

40|$|Streptococcus pneumoniaebacteria can be {{characterized}} into over 90 serotypes according to the composition of their polysaccharide capsules. Some serotypes are <b>common</b> in nasopharyngeal <b>carriage</b> whereas others are associated with invasive disease, but when carriage serotypes do invade disease is often particularly severe. It is unknown whether disease severity is due directly to the capsule type or to other virulence factors. Here, we used a clinical pneumococcal isolate and its capsule-switch mutants {{to determine the effect}} of capsule, in isolation from the genetic background, on severity of meningitis in an infant rat model. We found that possession of a capsule was essential for causing meningitis. Serotype 6 B caused significantly more mortality than 7 F and this correlated with increased capsule thickness in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), a stronger inflammatory cytokine response in the CSF and ultimately more cortical brain damage. We conclude that capsule type has a direct effect on meningitis severity. This is an important consideration in the current era of vaccination targeting a subset of capsule types that causes serotype replacement...|$|R

40|$|During {{the course}} of the network {{neutrality}} debate, advocates have proposed extending <b>common</b> <b>carriage</b> regulation to broadband Internet access services. Others have endorsed extending <b>common</b> <b>carriage</b> {{to a wide range of}} other Internet-based services, including search engines, cloud computing, Apple devices, online maps, and social networks. All too often, however, those who focus exclusively on the Internet era pay too little attention to the lessons of the legacy of regulated industries, which has long struggled to develop a coherent rationale for determining which industries should be subject to <b>common</b> <b>carriage.</b> Of the four rationales for determining the scope of common carriage—whether industry players (1) hold themselves out as serving all comers, (2) are “affected with a public interest,” (3) are natural monopolies, or (4) offer transparent transmission capability between points of the customers choosing without change—each has been discredited or is inapplicable to Internet-based technologies. Moreover, <b>common</b> <b>carriage</b> has long proven difficult to implement. Nondiscrimination is difficult to enforce when products vary in terms of quality or cost and forecloses demand-side price discrimination schemes (such as Ramsey pricing) that can increase economic welfare. In addition, the academic literature has long noted that the obligation to keep rates reasonable is difficult to apply, has trouble accommodating differences in quality, provides weak incentives to economize, creates systematic biases toward inefficient solutions, raises difficult questions about how to allocate common costs, deters innovation, and requires collusion by creating entry barriers, standardizing products, pooling information, providing advance notice of any pricing changes, and allowing the government to serve as the cartel enforcer. Three historical examples—early local telephone companies known as competitive access providers, the detariffing of business services, and Voice over Internet Protocol—provide concrete illustrations of how refraining from imposing <b>common</b> <b>carriage</b> regulation can benefit consumers...|$|E

40|$|Little {{is known}} about the {{population}} biology of Streptococcus pneumoniae in developing countries, although the majority of pneumococcal infections occur in this setting. The aim {{of the study was to}} apply MLST to investigate the population biology of S. pneumoniae in West Africa. Seventy three invasive and carriage S. pneumoniae isolates from three West African countries including The Gambia, Nigeria and Ghana were investigated. The isolates covered seven serotypes (1, 3, 5, 6 A, 11, 14, 23 F) and were subjected to multilocus sequence typing and antibiotic susceptibility testing. Overall, 50 different sequence types (STs) were identified, of which 38 % (29) were novel. The most common ST was a novel clone-ST 4012 (6. 5 %), and some clones including STs 913, 925, 1737, 2160 and 3310 appeared to be specific to the study region. Two STs including ST 63 and ST 4012 were associated with multiple serotypes indicating a history of serotype switching. ST 63 was associated with serotypes 3 and 23 F, while ST 4012 was associated with serotypes 6 A and 23. eBURST analyses using the stringent 6 / 7 identical loci definition grouped the 50 STs into 5 clonal complexes and 65 singletons, expressing a high level of genetic diversity among the isolates. Compared to the other serotypes, serotypes 1 and 5 isolates appeared to be more clonal. Internationally recognized antibiotic resistant clones of S. pneumoniae were generally absent in the population investigated and the only multidrug resistant isolate identified (1 / 66) belong to the Pneumocococcal Epidemiology Network clone ST 63. The pneumococcal population in West Africa is quite divergent, and serotypes that are common in invasive disease (such as serotypes 1 and 5) are more likely to be clonal than serotypes that are <b>common</b> in <b>carriage...</b>|$|R

A total of 136 of 399 isolates (34 %) had intermediate susceptibility to penicillin (MIC, 0. 1 to 1 mg/liter), and 76 of 399 isolates (19 %) showed resistance (MIC, > 1. 0 mg/liter). A total of 54 of 399 isolates (13 %) had intermediate susceptibility to ceftriaxone, and 3 of 399 isolates (1 %) were resistant. Penicillin resistance was 21. 7 (95 % confidence interval, 7. 0 to 67. 6) times more common in urban than in rural children (35 versus 2 %; P, < 0. 001). More than 40 % of isolates from urban children were also resistant to erythromycin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, chloramphenicol, and tetracycline. Penicillin resistance was independently associated with an urban location when {{the age of the}} child was controlled for. Multidrug resistance (resistance to three or more antimicrobial agent groups) was present in 32 % of isolates overall but in 39 % of isolates with intermediate susceptibility to penicillin and 86 % of isolates with penicillin resistance.

40|$|Introduction The current {{refugee crisis}} {{emphasizes}} the need for information on infectious diseases and resistant microorganisms in asylum seekers with possible consequences for public health and infection control. Methods We collected data from asylum seekers admitted to our university hospital or who presented at the Emergency Department (n = 273). We collected general and demographic characteristics including country of origin, the reason of presentation, and the screening results of multi-drug resistant organisms. Results 67 % of the patients were male with a median age of the study group of 24 years (IQR 15 - 33); 48 % of the patients had an infectious disease-predominantly malaria with P. vivax or tuberculosis. Patients also reported with diseases which are less common-e. g. leishmaniasis, or even conditions rarely diagnosed in Europe-e. g. louse borne relapsing fever. A carriage rate of 31 % for multi-drug resistant microorganisms (MDRO) was observed, with ESBL-expressing E. coli (n = 20) being the most <b>common</b> MDRO.

A single set of production assets exhausts any economies of scale or scope while owners compete with each other due to incentives from open ownership rules that promote efficient investment choices primarily by breaking down barriers to entry and competitive rules that promote an efficient secondary market. We argue that regulating a natural monopoly with these rules in a market structure we call a competitive joint venture significantly increases the efficiency of pricing output and capacity choices and may dramatically reduce regulatory costs when compared to regulating with <b>common</b> <b>carriage...</b>|$|E
40|$|Klebsiella pneumoniae is now {{recognized}} as an urgent threat to human health because {{of the emergence of}} multidrug-resistant strains associated with hospital outbreaks and hypervirulent strains associated with severe community-acquired infections. K. pneumoniae is ubiquitous in the environment and can colonize and infect both plants and animals. However, {{little is known about the}} population structure of K. pneumoniae, so it is difficult to recognize or understand the emergence of clinically important clones within this highly genetically diverse species. Here we present a detailed genomic framework for K. pneumoniae based on whole-genome sequencing of more than 300 human and animal isolates spanning four continents. Our data provide genome-wide support for the splitting of K. pneumoniae into three distinct species, KpI (K. pneumoniae), KpII (K. quasipneumoniae), and KpIII (K. variicola). Further, for K. pneumoniae (KpI), the entity most frequently associated with human infection, we show the existence of > 150 deeply branching lineages including numerous multidrug-resistant or hypervirulent clones. We show K. pneumoniae has a large accessory genome approaching 30, 000 protein-coding genes, including a number of virulence functions that are significantly associated with invasive community-acquired disease in humans. In our dataset, antimicrobial resistance genes were <b>common</b> among human <b>carriage</b> isolates and hospital-acquired infections, which generally lacked the genes associated with invasive disease. The convergence of virulence and resistance genes potentially could lead to the emergence of untreatable invasive K. pneumoniae infections; our data provide the whole-genome framework against which to track the emergence of such threat...|$|R
5000|$|The station {{often had}} busy periods, {{and was the}} hub of the railway network, {{although}} workshop and maintenance facilities were at Douglas Station. Services from Douglas to Ramsey and Peel often arrived as a single train, which was divided at the eastern end of the station prior to entering the station for passengers to board and alight. Two locomotives would often double head this far, the first (or [...] "pilot" [...] locomotive) drawing forward into the platform whilst the second drew its portion forward onto the relevant platform, and the pilot then ran back to collect its coaches. Douglas services from Peel and Ramsey were often scheduled to join at the station. Thus all three platform faces could be occupied at the same time. Prior to 1940 trains also served Foxdale, but a separate station served this line. The busiest day was Tynwald Day, when it was common to see the majority of the railway's rolling stock in service bringing passengers to the outdoor parliament ceremony, which took place a short walk from the station. For this occasion the railway operated a special unique timetable: trains often ran from dawn until well after midnight to cope with demand, and train movements were frequent throughout the day. It was <b>common</b> for all <b>carriages</b> to be in use and not unheard of for passengers to travel in open cattle vans and wagons and withdrawn carriages. Since closure the station site has been used for car parking for the ceremony.|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Staphylococcus aureus is {{a common}} human {{pathogen}} that can colonise the respiratory tract and cause infection. Here we investigate the risk factors associated with nasopharyngeal carriage of S. aureus (including methicillin-resistant S. aureus [MRSA]) in Vietnam. METHODS: Between February and June 2012, nasal and pharyngeal swabs for S. aureus culture, and demographic and socioeconomic data were taken from 1016 participants in urban and rural northern Vietnam, who {{were randomly selected from}} pre-specified age strata. RESULTS: Overall S. aureus prevalence was 303 / 1016 (29. 8 %; adjusted for age: 33. 8 %). Carriage in the main cohort was found to be associated with younger age (≤ 5 years [OR 3. 13, CI 1. 62 - 6. 03]; 6 - 12 [OR 6. 87, CI 3. 95 - 11. 94]; 13 - 19 [OR 6. 47, CI 3. 56 - 11. 74]; 20 - 29 [OR 4. 73, CI 2. 40 - 9. 31]; 30 - 59 [OR 1. 74, CI 1. 04 - 2. 92); with ≥ 60 as reference), living in an urban area (OR 1. 36, CI 1. 01 - 1. 83) and antibiotics use (OR 0. 69, CI 0. 49 - 0. 96). MRSA was detected in 80 / 1016 (7. 9 %). Being aged ≤ 5 years (OR 4. 84, CI 1. 47 - 15. 97); 6 - 12 (OR 10. 21, CI 3. 54 - 29. 50); 20 - 29 (OR 4. 01, CI 1. 09 - 14. 77) and wealth (> 3 / 5 wealth index, OR 1. 63 CI 1. 01 - 2. 62) were significant risk factors for MRSA carriage. CONCLUSIONS: Nasopharyngeal carriage of S. aureus is present in one-third of the Vietnamese population, and is more prevalent among children. Pharyngeal <b>carriage</b> is more <b>common</b> than nasal <b>carriage.</b> Risk factors for S. aureus (including MRSA) carriage are identified in the community...|$|R
