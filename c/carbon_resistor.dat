The sinter used in this experiment was made out of copper and was enclosed within a heat exchanger cell. The heat exchanger cell also includes a heater and a <b>carbon</b> <b>resistor,</b> which will be used as a thermometer. This cell should help to lower the Kapitza resistance, or the low temperature thermal resistance between materials under study. 2 Introduction: In low temperature research, thermal contact between two or more materials under study proves to be quite difficult. This is due to {{what is known as the}} Kapitza resistance. The Kapitza resistance, or low temperature thermal resistance, tends to increase as temperature decreases. Because of this devices known as sinters are used because of the large surface area to volume ratio that they posses. In this experiment the sinter was housed within a brass heat exchanger cell which consists of the sinter, a <b>carbon</b> <b>resistor</b> thermometer, and a heater. Experimental...|$|E

40|$|The {{two-dimensional}} Steven {{impact test}} {{has been developed}} to be reproducible and amenable to computer modeling. This test has a hemispherical projectile traveling at tens of m/s impacting a metal cased explosive target. To assist {{in the understanding of}} this safety test, two-dimensional shock wave gauge techniques were used to measure the pressures of a few kilobars and times of reactions less than a millisecond. This work is in accord with a long-term goal to develop two-dimensional shock diagnostic techniques that are more than just time of arrival indicators. Experiments were performed where explosives were impacted at levels below shock initiation levels but caused low level reactions. Carbon foil and <b>carbon</b> <b>resistor</b> pressure gauges were used to measure pressures and time of events. The <b>carbon</b> <b>resistor</b> gauges indicate a late time low level reaction at 350 {micro}s after impact of the hemispherical projectile creating 0. 5 - 6 kb peak shocks at the center of PBX 9501 (HMX/Estane/BDNPA-F; 95 / 2. 5 / 2. 5 wt %) explosive discs. The Steven test calculations are based on an ignition and growth criteria and found that the low level reaction occurs at 335 {micro}s, which is in good agreement with the experimental data. Some additional experiments simulating the Steven impact test were done on a gas gun with carbon foil and constantan strain gauges in a PMMA target.

40|$|Since we {{encounter}} many phenomena with irregular motion, e. g. the weather, turbulence, <b>carbon</b> <b>resistor</b> noise, chemical reactions and biological signals (human motion), we {{are tempted to}} investigate whether we could model the dynamics with nonlinear differential equations. Our aim is to find order within the chaos; to find evidence that the irregular behavior is governed by a small set of deterministic equations, using experimental time series. We might be successful in particular when the state variables of the system are strongly coupled. In this report, we will restrict ourselves to the determination of several properties that describe a chaotic system, including the dimension and entropy spectra. Loosely speaking, the dimension is a measure {{for the number of}} differential equations needed to describe the system, while the entropy is a measure for the loss of information {{about the state of the}} system in the course of time. Positive but finite entropy is a hall-mark of chaos.

Studies of aged and previously damaged HMX-based high explosives included the use of embedded carbon foil and <b>carbon</b> <b>resistor</b> gauges, high-speed cameras, and blast wave gauges to determine the pressure histories, time required for an explosive reaction, and the relative violence of those reactions, respectively. Various ignition processes were modeled as the initial reaction rate expression in the Ignition and Growth reaction rate equations.

Among these upgrades is the need for more transfer lines containing both liquid nitrogen and helium gas. These two fluids are used to provide the necessary operating cryogenic temperatures for the various detectors, such as the Visible Light Photon Counter (VLPC) and the solenoid inside the detector's calorimeter. With additional piping, it is important to monitor the temperatures to assure that the detectors can operate correctly. This can be done two ways. The first method is to use a Resistance Temperature Device, called a RTD, which is made using either a <b>carbon</b> <b>resistor</b> or a platinum resistor and measures the temperature based on resistance.
