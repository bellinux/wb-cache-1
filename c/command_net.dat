500|$|Communications between 3 RAR and Brigade Headquarters {{had failed}} early, while {{those with the}} forward {{companies}} were also poor. This was mostly due to {{the large number of}} South Koreans retreating through their position tearing out the line from the Command Post, as well the effect of heavy vehicle traffic and gunfire on the exposed line. Likewise, direct radio communication with the forward companies on the battalion <b>command</b> <b>net</b> with the new Type 31 VHF radios was obstructed by the rugged terrain due to the sitting of Battalion Headquarters in low ground relative to the forward companies and the requirement for line-of-sight. The forward companies were able to maintain communications with each other, but not with Battalion Headquarters, while the company level nets also functioned well. Ultimately contact was maintained between Ferguson and Burke through a radio set in the Middlesex Battalion Headquarters, while messages to the forward companies relied on line and a slow relay through C Company. These issues had only further complicated the conduct of the defence on the first night, with the co-ordination of the forward battle falling to O'Dowd. The next morning, O'Dowd finally managed to get through on a radio phone to a general in the US 1st Marine Division. The officer was incredulous, thinking it was a Chinese agent speaking.

Yet, with 1 ATF lacking sufficient forces to maintain a dedicated reserve at Nui Dat, no suitable quick reaction force was prepared to deploy at short notice. Consequently, it would take several hours to organise a relief force. Although essentially a sub-unit battle fought by a rifle company supported by artillery and co-ordinated by Townsend from the 6 RAR command post at Nui Dat, Jackson was concerned. Not only was D Company in trouble, but the entire force might be under threat, while the additional resources available to the task force might be required. As a result, he remained in constant contact with Townsend, although ultimate control remained with the latter. Viet Cong radio jamming on the Battalion <b>Command</b> <b>net</b> forced them to switch frequencies to communicate with D Company, while with such a capability rarely found below divisional-level, they were likely more outnumbered than first thought. At 16:30 Townsend ordered A Company to prepare to reinforce them, despite themselves only having returned from a three-day patrol an hour prior. Intending to lead the company out himself and take command of the battle, 3 Troop, 1st APC Squadron under Lieutenant Adrian Roberts was also warned to be ready to lift the relief force.

The battalion directed effective artillery fire against the paratroopers, who were also receiving heavy machine-gun and small-arms fire from entrenched Egyptian infantry. The paratroopers attempted to assault the machine-gun positions, in places advancing to within a few meters of Egyptian lines. The paratrooper companies spread out, but repeatedly failed to reach the defenses. Israeli artillery fire was ineffective. Egyptian infantry were able to suppress the paratroopers' movement and thwart flanking attempts. Most company and platoon commanders were killed or wounded.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} {{we present a}} {{data-driven}} neuromuscular model of human walking and its application to prosthesis control. The model is novel in that it leverages tendon elasticity to more accurately predict the metabolic consumption of walking than conventional models. Paired with a reflex-based neural drive the model has been applied in the control of a robotic ankle-foot prosthesis, producing speed adaptive behavior. Current neuromuscular models significantly overestimate the metabolic demands of walking. We believe this is {{because they do not}} adequately consider the role of elasticity; specifically the parameters that govern the force-length relations of tendons in these models are typically taken from published values determined from cadaver studies. To investigate this issue we first collected kinematic, kinetic, electromyographic (EMG), and metabolic data from five subjects walking at six different speeds. The kinematic and kinetic data were used to estimate muscle lengths, muscle moment arms, and joint moments while the EMG data were used to estimate muscle activations. For each subject we performed a kinematically clamped optimization, varying the parameters that govern the force-length curve of each tendon while simultaneously seeking to minimize metabolic cost and maximize agreement with the observed joint moments. We found a family of parameter sets that excel at both objectives, providing agreement with both the collected kinetic and metabolic data. This identification allows us to accurately predict the metabolic cost of walking as well as the force and state of individual muscles, lending insight into the roles and control objectives of different muscles throughout the gait cycle. This optimized muscle-tendon morphology was then applied with an optimized linear reflex architecture in the control of a powered ankle-foot prosthesis. Specifically, the model was fed the robot's angle and state and used to command output torque. Clinical trials were conducted that demonstrated speed adaptive behavior; <b>commanded</b> <b>net</b> work was seen to increase with walking speed. This result supports both the efficacy of the modeling approach and its potential utility in controlling life-like prosthetic limbs. by Jared Markowitz. Thesis (Ph. D.)

5000|$|The {{different}} operating techniques {{made it easy}} {{to distinguish}} rapidly between French, British and Belgian units.Generally speaking, the Allies transmitted too many messages and thus enabled Germany to intercept them without any trouble. However, except for serious violations of radio security, such as the sending of messages in the clear, i.e Plaintext, the General der Nachrichtenaufklärung and other German intelligence agencies were confronted with considerable difficulties, because the majority of the cryptographic systems used by the Allies proved unbreakable. In view of the rapid conduct of operations, particularly those of motorized and armoured units, the information obtained by German radio intelligence was of secondary importance in comparison with that gathered by ground and air combat reconnaissance. [...] On the evening of {{the first day of the}} attack German radio intelligence picked up messages from the area west of Namur facing Army Group A. The characteristics of these messages left no doubt about the presence of at least two French armoured divisions. The fact that this was reported in time, together with reliable information about the disposition of French forces on the western bank of the River Meuse, made it possible to warn the German armoured units which had been moved forward to the Meuse and which after crossing the river on 15th May, were actually engaged in heavy fighting.Remarkable radio discipline was observed by the French Ninth Army, which was soon attacked by (Panzergruppe) Panzer Group Kleist and by the inner flanks of Army Groups A and Army Groups B between Maubeuge (where 90% of the town centre was destroyed by bombardments in May 1940) Montmédy. The information obtained from the 56th Intercept Company, which was committed along the axis of advance of Panzer Group Kleist, was therefore initially unimportant. Since the 56th could not, in the long run, keep pace with Panzer Group Kleist, while carrying on its direction-finding operations, it was ordered to halt on 20th May near Le Cateau-Cambrésis, where it took bearings from two base lines: from the first, directed westward towards Maubeuge - Péronne-en-Mélantois, searching the area bounded by the Franco-Belgian border on the right and by the Somme as far as the Channel coast on the left, while from the base line directed southward through Arras and Rethel it covered the Somme and Aisne sectors. The 3rd Intercept Company was assigned to the Laon - Arlon base line after it has crossed the Franco-Belgian border on 14th May. While France moved up division after division in order to cover the open flank, which had developed along the Aisne and Somme as a result of the advance by Panzer Group Kleist, these two intercept companies gradually succeeded in identifying the enemy groupings to the south. As early as the 14th May, a new army net with three secondary stations was detected. An army HQ was plotted as being west of Verdun, but on the basis of the first observations it could not be identified as that of the French Second Army. Once corps was found east of Reims, close to Grandpré. There was some doubt concerning the significance of the staff detected east of Reims; instead of corps traffic it might also have been the inter-net traffic of the army. In the final evaluation the results were treated cautiously, and it was merely concluded that the French second Army sector has been widened, leaving open the possibility that a new front was being built up between Rethel and Stenay. [...] Two days later, on 16th May, a new HQ near Épernay appeared on the air with links to the corps in the Challerange - Grandpré area in the centre of the above-mentioned net. On the basis of a plaintext message this HQ was identified as the new French Sixth Army, commanded by General Robert Touchon, who was mentioned by name. This information, at first doubted by the German command, was confirmed by other sources on 20th May. On the 22nd May, the western flank of the new Sixth Army was plotted south of Amiens. On the same day near Montdidier, a mobile division was identified which had been brought up from the area north of Verdun and had established contact with Sixth Army. On the 23th May, it was possible to determine the boundary between the French Sixth and French Second Armies at the Canal latéral à l'Aisne north of Vouziers. In the meantime, it was possible, solely by intercepting division HQ stations, to count every French division in the newly established Aisne sector and to report all changes, daily. However, only in one instance did Germany succeed in establishing a divisional designation, namely the French 6th Colonial Division, in Machault southwest of Vouziers on 19th May. Reinforced by the 26th Incercept Company, which Army Group B was able to release in the north, radio intelligence now began the systematic coverage of the Somme section between the coast and Péronne. Here on the 23rd May, a new staff was recognized in the radio picture near Elbeuf, and another near Clermont. It was not initially possible to identify clearly these twos sfaff HQs. It was not until ten divisions between the coast and the Oise were identified as belonging to Staff Clermont that the commitment of another army was reported.In the following days the French Sixth Army at Épernay, the Staff Elbeuf and Army HQ Clermont were in contact with a station near Meux, which, because of its high efficiency and characteristics transmitting technique, was believed to be the station of an army group HQ. It maintained no contact with the Second Army at Verdun, but a fourth <b>command</b> <b>net</b> did not appear whose called station could not be located. As reported by the commander of intercept troops attached to Army Group C, the French Fourth Army at Nancy was not heard after 23rd May from the fortified areas. Its station was not associated with new traffic which appeared regularly in the Châlons-en-Champagne area but which could not be assigned any definite part in the command radio picture. Nevertheless, the picture of the order of battle was well rounded: Army Group Meaux in command of the Sixth Army at Épernay, Armée Clermont, and Armée Elbeuf, had the mission of defending the Somme and Aisne. This mission was confirmed by the radio address given by Paul Reynaud on 28th May. [...] Between the 1st and 4th June, the information concerning the unit disposition between the English Channel coast and the fortified areas, which had been obtained by radio intelligence, was confirmed from a source and was supplanted by the information that the Armée Elbeuf (which had recently been plotted in La Feuillée) was the French Tenth Army commanded by General Robert Altmayer, which had been brought up from the Italian border; that Armée Clermont (now fixed as being in Creil) was the newly formed French Seventh Army commanded by General Aubert Frère; and the Army Group Meaux was presumably the staff of General Antoine-Marie-Benoît Besson who commanded the French Tenth Army and French Eighth Army on the southern flank. Chart 4 contains the radio intercept results which had been obtained up to the time when German Army Groups B and A moved into position for their attack across the Somme and Aisne on 4th and 7th June.|$|E
40|$|This {{paper is}} focused on the {{development}} of a proper macroeconomic strategy in the process of Poland's accession to the European Monetary Union. It is argued that due to legal and political considerations Poland may not opt out from EMU participation. The country will however <b>command</b> <b>net</b> gains from participation in the eurozone, mainly due to reduced macroeconomic and microeconomic uncertainty. In order to achieve even higher gains it is necessary to reduce price and wage rigidities, eliminate constraints on free movement of labor, further promote trade links with EU and its diversification. Loss of monetary and exchange rate instruments will require responsive but generally conservative fiscal policy. Particularly, as Poland might experience major economic upturn at the outset in the EU membership, the country should achieve positive budget balance by this time. It will allow for fiscal expansion in case of future negative asymmetric shock or recessions. Fiscal policy should be therefore assigned to improve saving-investment balance and consequently current account, so that direct inflation targeting is well placed to achieve fulfillment of Maastricht price stability criterion. Real exchange rate is not an independent instrument to target current account, as real appreciation of domestic currency is unavoidable due to rapid productivity gains in Poland. Finally, the accession to EMU should follow promptly the accession to EU. Unilateral introduction of Euro is too risky for banking and real sectors. Slower process of joining EMU would hamper credibility of macroeconomic adjustment commitment. Poland, EMU...|$|E

40|$|A novel voltage-clamp {{protocol}} {{was developed to}} test whether slow inactivation of Ca 2 + current occurs during bursting in insulin-secreting cells. Single insulin-secreting HIT cells were patch-clamped and their Ca 2 + currents were isolated pharmacologically. A computed beta-cell burst {{was used as a}} voltage-clamp <b>command</b> and the <b>net</b> Ca 2 + current elicited was determined as a cadmium difference current. Ca 2 + current rapidly activated during the computed plateau and spike depolarizations and then slowly decayed. Integration of this Ca 2 + current yielded an estimate of total Ca influx. To further analyze Ca 2 + current inactivation during a burst, repetitive test pulses to + 10 mV were added to the voltage command. Current elicited by these pulses was constant during the interburst, but then slowly and reversibly decreased during the depolarizing plateau. This inactivation was reduced by replacing external Ca 2 + with Ba 2 + as a charge carrier, and in some cells inactivation was slower in Ba 2 +. Experimental results were compared with the predictions of the Keizer-Smolen mathematical model of bursting, after subjecting model equations to identical voltage commands. In this model, bursting is driven by the slow, voltage-dependent inactivation of Ca current during the plateau active phase. The K-S model could account for the slope of the slow decay of spike-elicited Ca current, the waveform of individual Ca current spikes, and the suppression of test pulse-elicited Ca current during a burst command. However, the extent and rate of fast inactivation were underestimated by the model. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS...|$|R

NET? GRGEN. NET is an application domain neutral graph rewrite system, the feature highlights regarding practical relevance are: Fully Featured Meta Model: GRGEN. NET uses attributed and typed multigraphs with multiple inher-itance on node/edge types. Attributes may be typed with one of several basic types, user defined enums, or generic set, map, and array types. Expressive Rules, Fast Execution: The expressive and easy to learn rule specification language allows for a straightforward formulation of even complex problems, with an optimized implementation yielding high execution speed at modest memory consumption; outstanding features are iterated and recursive pattern matching and rewriting. Programmed Rule Application: GRGEN. NET supports a high-level rule application control language, Graph Rewrite Sequences (GRS), offering sequential, logical, iterative and recursive control plus variables and storages for the communication of processing locations between rules. Graphical Debugging: GRSHELL, GRGEN. <b>NET’s</b> <b>command</b> line shell, offers interactive execution of rules, visualising together with yComp the current graph and the rewrite process. This way you can see what the graph looks like at a given step of a complex transformation and develop the next step accordingly. Or you can debug your rules and sequences. 2 Hello World! The first task is to create a Greeting node with appropriate text. To solve the task we use the GRGEN rule from HelloWorld. grg shown below that creates the required graph when being executed: rule createHelloWorld { replace { greeting:helloworld_Greeting; eval { greeting. _text = "Hello World"...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT A novel voltage-clamp {{protocol}} {{was developed to}} test whether slow inactivation of Ca 2 + current occurs during bursting in insulin-secreting cells. Single insulin-secreting HIT cells were patch-clamped and their Ca 2 + currents were isolated pharmacologically. A computed, 3 -cell burst {{was used as a}} voltage-clamp <b>command</b> and the <b>net</b> Ca 2 + current elicited was determined as a cadmium difference current. Ca 2 + current rapidly activated during the computed plateau and spike depolarizations and then slowly decayed. Integration of this Ca 2 + current yielded an estimate of total Ca influx. To further analyze Ca 2 + current inactivation during a burst, repetitive test pulses to + 10 mV were added to the voltage command. Current elicited by these pulses was constant during the interburst, but then slowly and reversibly decreased during the depolarizing plateau. This inactivation was reduced by replacing external Ca 2 + with Ba 2 + as a charge carrier, and in some cells inactivation was slower in Ba 2 +. Experimental results were compared with the predictions of the Keizer-Smolen mathematical model of bursting, after subjecting model equations to identical voltage commands. In this model, bursting is driven by the slow, voltage-dependent inactivation of Ca current during the plateau active phase. The K-S model could account for the slope of the slow decay of spike-elicited Ca current, the waveform of individual Ca current spikes, and the suppression of test pulseelicited Ca current during a burst command. However, the extent and rate of fast inactivation were underestimated by the model. Although there are significant differences between the data obtained and the predictions of the K-S model, the overall results show that as predicted by the model, Ca current slowly inactivates during a burst of imposed spikes, and inactivation is dependent on both Ca 2 + influx and membrane depolarization. We thus show that clamping cells to their physiological voltage waveform can be readily accomplished and is a powerful approach for understanding the contribution of individual ion currents to bursting...|$|R
