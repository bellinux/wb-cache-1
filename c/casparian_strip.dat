40|$|The {{structure}} {{and development of}} endodermal Caspar-ian strips in Pinus bungeana needles and roots were stud-ied by scanning electron microscopy and fluorescence microscopy. Primary pit fields (PFs) frequently occurred in radial walls of <b>Casparian</b> <b>strips</b> isolated from needles, whereas PFs were never detected in <b>Casparian</b> <b>strips</b> from roots. Formation of <b>Casparian</b> <b>strips</b> in needles as well as roots started at the outer parts of the radial walls and they finally occupied the entire radial walls of the endodermis. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy of Caspar-ian strips isolated from roots revealed significant absorp-tion bands characteristic for suberin. However, in <b>Casparian</b> <b>strips</b> of needles, evidence for suberin was rarely detected by FTIR spectroscopy. The apoplastic permeability of <b>Casparian</b> <b>strips</b> in needles and roots was probed by the apoplastic tracers calcofluor and berberine. <b>Casparian</b> <b>strips</b> in roots efficiently blocked the apoplastic transport (AT) of calcofluor and berberine. <b>Casparian</b> <b>strips</b> in nee-dles blocked the AT of calcofluor, but diffusion of berber-ine was not inhibited and berberine thiocyanate crystals were detectable in the vascular tissue of the needles. From the data presented, it must be concluded that <b>Casparian</b> <b>strips</b> in needles, which are characterized {{by the absence of}} suberin, are more solute permeable compared with Caspar-ian strips in roots...|$|R

At this level of the root development, the primary xylem of its vascular cylinder is only partly advanced. In gymnosperms and angiosperms displaying secondary growth, the roots commonly develop only endodermis with <b>Casparian</b> <b>strips.</b> In many of those, the endodermis is later discarded, together with the cortex, when the periderm develops from the pericycle. If the pericycle is superficial and the cortex is retained, either the endodermis is stretched or crushed or it keeps pace with {{the expansion of the}} vascular cylinder by radial [...] divisions, and the new walls develop <b>Casparian</b> <b>strips</b> in continuity with the old ones.|$|R
40|$|It {{is shown}} {{on the basis of}} cytological studies that during the {{development}} of the pea root endodermis, the following structures were formed (in order of appearance) : proendodermis, <b>Casparian</b> <b>strips,</b> suberin lamellae and secondary cell walls. The proendodermis cells had, in addition to the commonly occurring cell components, small vacuoles filled with phenols. The <b>Casparian</b> <b>strips</b> developed in the radial walls and accounted for no more than 1 / 3 of their length.

50|$|In {{the absence}} of {{secondary}} growth (most monocotyledons and a few eudicots), the endodermis commonly undergoes wall modifications. There are two developmental stages beyond {{the development of the}} <b>Casparian</b> <b>strip.</b> In the second stage suberin (or endoderm) coats the entire wall {{on the inside of the}} cell. As a result, the <b>Casparian</b> <b>strip</b> is separated from the cytoplasm and the connection between the two ceases to be evident. In the third stage, a thick cellulose layer is deposited over the suberin, sometimes mainly on the inner tangential walls. The thickened wall, as well as the original wall in which the <b>Casparian</b> <b>strip</b> is located, may become lignified, creating a secondary cell wall. The <b>Casparian</b> <b>strip</b> may be identifiable after the thickening of the endodermal wall has occurred. The thickened endodermal wall may have pits. The successive development of endodermal walls is clearly expressed in monocotyledons. In dicotyledons, the distinction between the second and third stages of endodermal development may not be sharp (Guttenberg, 1943), and in the seedless vascular plants the differentiation is terminated with the deposition of the suberin.

50|$|The endodermis is developmentally the {{innermost}} {{portion of the}} cortex. It may consist of a single layer of barrel-shaped cells without any intercellular spaces or sometimes several cell layers. The cells of the endodermis typically have their primary cell walls thickened on four sides radial and transverse with suberin, a water-impermeable waxy substance which in young endodermal cells is deposited in distinctive bands called <b>Casparian</b> <b>strips.</b> These strips vary in width but are typically smaller than the cell wall on which they are deposited. If the endodermis is likened to a brick cylinder (e.g. a smokestack), with the bricks representing individual cells, the <b>Casparian</b> <b>strips</b> are analogous to the mortar between the bricks. In older endodermal cells, suberin may be more extensively deposited on all cell wall surfaces and the cells can become lignified, forming a complete waterproof layer.|$|R
50|$|The endodermis in {{the root}} is {{important}} in the development of root pressure. The endodermis is a single layer of cells between the cortex and the pericycle. These cells allow water movement until it reaches the <b>Casparian</b> <b>strip,</b> made of suberin, a waterproof substance. The <b>Casparian</b> <b>strip</b> prevents mineral nutrient ions from moving passively through the endodermal cell walls. Water and ions move in these cell walls via the apoplast pathway. Ions outside the endodermis must be actively transported across an endodermal cell membrane to enter or exit the endodermis. Once inside the endodermis, the ions are in the symplast pathway. They cannot diffuse back out again but can move from cell to cell via plasmodesmata or be actively transported into the xylem. Once in the xylem vessels or tracheids, ions are again in the apoplast pathway. Xylem vessels and tracheids transport water up the plant but lack cell membranes. The <b>Casparian</b> <b>strip</b> substitutes for their lack of cell membranes and prevents accumulated ions from diffusing passively in apoplast pathway out of the endodermis. The ions accumulating interior to the endodermis in the xylem create a water potential gradient and by osmosis, water diffuses from the moist soil, across the cortex, through the endodermis and into the xylem.|$|E
50|$|The endodermis is the central, {{innermost}} {{layer of}} cortex in some land plants.

5000|$|Passage {{cells are}} endodermal cells of older roots which have {{retained}} thin walls and <b>Casparian</b> <b>strips</b> rather than becoming suberized and waterproof {{like the other}} cells around them, to continue to allow some symplastic flow to the inside. Experimental evidence suggests that passage cells function to allow transfer of solutes such as calcium and magnesium into the stele, in order to eventually reach the transpiration system. [...] For the most part, however, old roots seal themselves off at the endodermis, and only serve as a passageway for water and minerals taken up by younger roots [...] "downstream".|$|R
50|$|This allows direct cytoplasm-to-cytoplasm flow {{of water}} and other {{nutrients}} along concentration gradients. In particular, symplastic flow {{is used in the}} root systems to bring in nutrients from soil. It moves these solutes from epidermis cells through the cortex into the endodermis. Once solutes reach the endodermal cells thorough apoplastic flow, they are forced into the symplastic pathway due to the presence of the <b>Casparian</b> <b>strip.</b> Once the solutes are passively filtered, they eventually reach the pericycle, where it can be moved into the xylem for long distance transport.It is contrasted with the apoplastic flow, which uses cell wall transport.|$|E
50|$|Suberin {{is highly}} {{hydrophobic}} and a somewhat 'rubbery' material. In roots suberin is {{deposited in the}} radial and transverse cell walls of the endodermal cells.

Instead, water must bypass the endodermis via the symplast. This allows the plant to select the solutes that pass further into the plant. It thus forms an important barrier to harmful solutes. For example, mangroves use suberin to minimize salt intake from their littoral habitat.|$|E

The endodermis is the innermost cortical cell layer that features rings of hydrophobic cell wall material called the <b>Casparian</b> <b>strips,</b> which functionally resemble tight junctions in animal epithelia. Nutrient uptake from the soil can occur through three different routes that can be interconnected in various ways: the apoplastic route (through the cell wall), the symplastic route (through cellular connections), and a coupled trans-cellular route (involving polarized influx and efflux carriers).

In Ianthopappus corymbosus, the underground system consists of rhizophore from which adventitious roots branch off.

However, the factors that control both expression of the genes encoding this biosynthetic machinery and its localization to the <b>Casparian</b> <b>strip</b> formation site remain unknown.

The barrier function of Casparian strips in these plants is also disrupted. Significantly, ectopic expression of MYB 36 in the cortex is sufficient to reprogram these cells to start expressing CASP 1 -GFP, correctly localize the CASP 1 -GFP protein to form a <b>Casparian</b> <b>strip</b> domain, and deposit a Casparian strip-like structure in the cell wall at this location.

To enable such control, Casparian strips span the cell wall of adjacent endodermal cells to form a tight junction that blocks extracellular diffusion across the endodermis.

There was no accumulation of starch or tannins in the pneumatophores, except for the presence of statoliths in the root cap. No lenticels were observed in pneumatophores of M. vinifera. The main function of the pneumatophores of M. vinifera is to allow gas exchange, facilitating the supply of oxygen to the submerged root portions...|$|R
40|$|Root endodermis and exodermis form apoplastic {{barriers}} for {{the movement}} of water and solutes {{into and out of}} the plant root system. Both layers have modified cell walls with <b>Casparian</b> <b>strips.</b> They often develope suberin lamela as a secondary development stage and thickened cellulose, sometimes lignified, wall as a tertiary development stage. Endodermis, as the innermost layer of cortex, is generally present in all vascular plant roots except Lycopodium. It is very phylogenetically and developmentally stable and in most cases single-layered. Exodermis can be often multi-layered or dimorphic and is formed on the periphery of the root. This layer can be found in a large number of angiosperms but according to the data gathered so far it seems that most of the seedless plants and gymnosperms lack it. Its presence correlates with the environmental conditions in which plants grow and its high structural and developmental plasticity helps roots to resist stress conditions such as drought, salinity, anoxic conditions and the presence of toxic substances. This paper aims to summarize the current knowledge of interspecies variability and developmental plasticity of endodermis and exodermis in roots of vascular plants...|$|R
