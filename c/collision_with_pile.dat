50|$|While {{barriers}} are normally designed to minimize injury to vehicle occupants, injuries do occur in <b>collisions</b> <b>with</b> traffic barriers. They {{should only be}} installed where a <b>collision</b> <b>with</b> the barrier {{is likely to be}} less severe than a <b>collision</b> <b>with</b> the hazard behind it. Where possible, it is preferable to remove, relocate or modify a hazard, rather than shield it with a barrier.|$|R

40|$|The {{stability}} of HOC(+) ions under conditions in interstellar molecular clouds is considered. In particular, {{the possibility that}} <b>collisions</b> <b>with</b> helium or hydrogen will induce isomerization to the stable HCO(+) form is examined theoretically. Portions of the electronic potential energy surfaces for interaction with He and H atoms are obtained from standard quantum mechanical calculations. <b>Collisions</b> <b>with</b> He atoms {{are found to be}} totally ineffective for inducing isomerization. <b>Collisions</b> <b>with</b> H atoms are found to be ineffective at low interstellar temperatures owing to a small (about 500 K) barrier in the entrance channel; at higher temperatures where this barrier can be overcome, however, <b>collisions</b> <b>with</b> hydrogen atoms do result in conversion to the stable HCO(+) form. Although detailed calculations are not presented, it is argued that low-energy <b>collisions</b> <b>with</b> H 2 molecules are also ineffective in destroying the metastable ion...|$|R
