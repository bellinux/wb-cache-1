25|$|A {{continuous}} area {{of approximately}} 400 hectares (988 acres) {{is covered with}} woodland or plantation. The forest is managed for timber by United Utilities, using a continuous cover policy (rather than clear felling and restocking). Macclesfield Borough Council plans to increase {{the area of the}} former royal forest that is covered by woodland. The predominant species are Sitka spruce and Japanese Larch, with some Scots Pine, Lodgepole Pine, Corsican pine and Norway Spruce. There are also areas of semi-natural mixed and broadleaved woodland, mainly oak, sycamore and beech; in 2004, broadleaved species made up 23% of the total, although current forestry management aims to increase the proportion. The woodland supports mosses and thirty species of fungi, including fly agaric, stinkhorns, honey fungus and the sickener. The area also includes areas of acidic unimproved upland grassland, including approximately a hectare within the Trentabank nature reserve; this supports species including bluebell, tormentil, pignut, birdsfoot trefoil, foxglove and lesser knapweed, while the reservoir margins support aquatic plants including amphibious bistort, water mint, Water Horsetail and <b>common</b> <b>spikerush.</b>|$|E

40|$|Four {{hydropower}} operational scenarios at Flaming Gorge Dam {{were evaluated}} {{to determine their}} potential effects on riparian vegetation along the Green River in Utah and Colorado. Data collected in June 1992 indicated that elevation above the river had the largest influence on plant distribution. A lower riparian zone occupied the area between the approximate elevations of 800 and 4, 200 -cfs flows [...] the area {{within the range of}} hydropower operational releases. The lower zone was dominated by wetland plants such as cattail, <b>common</b> <b>spikerush,</b> coyote willow, juncus, and carex. An upper riparian zone was above the elevation of historical maximum power plant releases from the dam (4, 200 cfs), and it generally supported plants adapted to mesic, nonwetland conditions. Common species in the upper zone included box elder, rabbitbrush, grasses, golden aster, and scouring rush. Multispectral aerial videography of the Green River was collected in May and June 1992 to determine the relationship between flow and the areas of water and the riparian zone. From these relationships, it was estimated that the upper zone would decrease in extent by about 5 % with year-round high fluctuation, seasonally adjusted high fluctuation, and seasonally adjusted moderate fluctuation, but it would increase by about 8 % under seasonally adjusted steady flow. The lower zone would increase by about 13 % for both year-round and seasonally adjusted high fluctuation scenarios but would decrease by about 40 % and 74 % for seasonally adjusted moderate fluctuation and steady flows, respectively. These changes are considered to be relatively minor and would leave pre-dam riparian vegetation unaffected. Occasional high releases above power plant capacity would be needed for long-term maintenance of this relict vegetation...|$|E
50|$|Eleocharis acicularis is {{a species}} of spikesedge known by the <b>common</b> names needle <b>spikerush</b> and least spikerush. It is {{widespread}} across Europe, central and southeastern Asia, North America and northeastern South America {{as far south as}} Ecuador. It is also found in Australia, where it is probably an introduced species.|$|R
50|$|Eleocharis atropurpurea is {{a species}} of spikesedge known by the <b>common</b> name purple <b>spikerush.</b> This is an aquatic plant native to much of (Africa, eastern and {{southern}} Asia, Australia, Latin America). It also has a wide distribution in temperate regions of North and South America and Asia. It is present in Europe, where {{it may be an}} introduced species for the most part.|$|R

50|$|Eleocharis radicans is {{a species}} of spikesedge known by the <b>common</b> name rooted <b>spikerush.</b> This aquatic or {{semi-aquatic}} plant is native to the Americas {{as far north as}} Virginia and northern California. It grows in wet places such as streams, lakes, bogs, and moist meadows, where it roots on soaked ground or floats in the water. This is a rhizomatous, mat-forming perennial with thread-thin, spongy stems. It may have several thin leaves. The stems are topped with papery spikelets about half a centimeter long at maximum size and containing 4 to 12 flowers, each covered with a light-colored bract. The fruit is a minute white or yellow achene less than a millimeter long.|$|R
5000|$|Eleocharis obtusa is {{a species}} of spikesedge known by the <b>common</b> name blunt <b>spikerush.</b> This plant is widely {{distributed}} across Canada and the United States, where it grows in wet areas such as riverbanks and moist forest floors. It is also a weed of rice paddies, especially when the rice plants are young sprouts. This is an annual spikesedge approaching half a meter in maximum height. It has many green cylindrical stems which are erect but weak and spongy. There may be thin, grasslike leaves toward {{the base of the}} plant, which are generally straw-colored.
