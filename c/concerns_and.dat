40|$|Environmental {{management}} {{has become an}} important managerial tool for creating conditions for greater competitiveness of organizations. A {{significant portion of the}} population considers environmental issues while consuming. However, despite the proposed relationship between environmental <b>concern</b> <b>and</b> consumption, some studies have identified a gap between declared environmental <b>concern</b> <b>and</b> consumer behavior. One possible explanation for this gap is the lack of trust in the ethics of retailers and the perception that environmental appealing offers would be only artifices of marketing. Thus, this paper aims to analyze the moderating effect of trust in the relationship between Environmental <b>concern</b> <b>and</b> environmental purchase intention. To operationalize the study, an online survey was conducted among 696 Brazilian consumers. The sample was characterized as non-probabilistic. Validated scales were used to measure the variables and data were analyzed using structural equation modeling. The results show that there is a significant relationship between environmental <b>concern</b> <b>and</b> environmental purchase intention, however, the low explanatory power of the model points to the gap between discourse and practice. By analyzing the trust of consumers as moderating variable, it is clear that, by increasing consumersâ€™ trust, the gap between environmental <b>concern</b> <b>and</b> consumption is diminished...|$|R
