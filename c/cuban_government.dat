5|$|All {{but one of}} {{the major}} iguana {{concentrations}} are either partially or fully protected by the <b>Cuban</b> <b>government.</b> Although no captive-breeding program exists within Cuba, the Centro Nacional de Areas Protegidas (the National Center for Protected Areas) has suggested it will explore this route in the future. In 1985 the <b>Cuban</b> <b>government</b> issued a commemorative peso depicting a Cuban iguana on the head side of the coin in an attempt to raise awareness for this animal.|$|E
5|$|The {{concert was}} planned {{for several months}} prior to its public {{announcement}} while the band was on their 2016 tour of South America, titled América Latina Olé Tour 2016. The bands' manager, Joyce Smyth, and Concerts Westworked extensively with the <b>Cuban</b> <b>government</b> {{in order for the}} show to be approved, due to the <b>Cuban</b> <b>government</b> still having control over what its citizens listen to. The embargo on Cuba proved to be a technical challenge for the band and stage crews since they had to ship all of their equipment from Belgium and could not rely on local infrastructure to assist to the degree that they are used to in more developed areas.|$|E

5|$|Continuing to seek ways to oust Castro {{following}} the Bay of Pigs Invasion, Kennedy {{and his administration}} experimented with various ways of covertly facilitating {{the overthrow of the}} <b>Cuban</b> <b>government.</b> Significant hopes were pinned on a covert program named the Cuban Project, devised under the Kennedy administration in 1961.|$|E
5|$|During Castro's illness, which {{culminated in}} his 2008 resignation, Payá {{continued}} {{to criticize the}} <b>Cuban</b> <b>government</b> as it transferred power to Castro's brother Raúl. He called on Raul Castro to allow multiparty elections and free all political prisoners, and delivered a petition asking that the Cuban people be granted freedom of travel.|$|E

5|$|Strong wind gusts downed nearly 1,500power {{lines and}} knocked over 28 large high tension wire towers at {{a power plant}} in Mariel. As a result, {{more than half of}} the {{electricity}} customers in Havana Province were left without power for 12days after the storm, and all of Pinar del Río Province was without power for over 11days. Blackouts continued in areas where power returned. The power outages resulted in lack of drinking water for numerous people, including no potable water in the city of Havana for four days. As a result, the <b>Cuban</b> <b>government</b> sent water tanks to satisfy the short term need. Similarly, there was a lack of gas for cooking for over a week. However, one <b>Cuban</b> <b>government</b> official stated that it could take up to two months for basic utilities to be returned to many isolated villages.|$|E
5|$|At a {{press conference}} {{arranged}} by Cuban authorities on 30 July, Modig and Carromero stated that the crash was an accident and no other car was involved.

On September29, {{the government}} of Japan sent water equipment, soap, towels, and emergency health kits worth $119,200 to the affected areas in Cuba. By February 1999, the Japanese Government had provided Cuba with nearly $1million in disaster funds. An emergency cash grant of $50,000 was also given to Cuba by the United Nations. The Cuban Red Cross mobilized about 8,700 volunteers to assist victims of the storm in the 900 shelters set up throughout the island. Plastic sheeting was to be distributed {{for about a week}} for residents to patch holes in the roof of their homes. The National Council of Churches sent relief goods valued at $70,000 to the <b>Cuban</b> <b>Government</b> on October9. By February 1999, the Cuban Red Cross distributed over 30,000 sheets of roofing to nearly 5,500 people in three provinces. Several months after the storm, the <b>Cuban</b> <b>Government</b> reported that they had allocated about $38million in funds for Hurricane Georges.|$|E

5|$|<b>Cuban</b> <b>government</b> {{officials}} {{issued a}} hurricane {{watch for the}} southern coastline on August 11, {{two days before the}} hurricane struck the island. This was upgraded to a hurricane warning on the 12th, 13 ½ hours before Charley made landfall. Because of the threat, the government issued a mandatory evacuation for 235,000citizens and 159,000animals {{in the area of the}} expected impact. An additional 3,800residents were evacuated from offshore islands, while 47,000 in Havana were transported from old, unsafe buildings to safer areas.

In recognition of his work, he received the European Parliament's Sakharov Prize and People in Need's Homo Homini Award.|$|E
5|$|In Cuba, {{slightly}} over 228,000 residents were evacuated from low-lying areas before the storm. Around 10% stayed in temporary shelters, {{while the rest}} stayed with family or friends. Included in the evacuation total were 6,000 tourists and over 1,000 residents in rickety houses. Workers protected tobacco leaves by moving them to sealed warehouses, and transported cattle and livestock to higher ground. The hurricane forced the closure of schools and the cancellation of some flights. The <b>Cuban</b> <b>government</b> issued a Hurricane Watch for Pinar del Río Province, Havana, Havana Province, and Isla de la Juventud 21hours before Irene hit. These areas, along with Matanzas Province, were upgraded to a Hurricane Warning 15hours before Irene hit the area.|$|E

5000|$|Drug {{trafficking}} grew {{dramatically in}} the mid-1980s and 1990s. In the 1990s over 200 foreigners and many more Cubans were caught smuggling drugs, and some 31 tons of drugs, mostly United States-bound, were seized by the authorities.

Both the American and <b>Cuban</b> <b>governments</b> targeted issues such as migration, drug trafficking, and terrorism.|$|R
5|$|Like {{many other}} Latin American intellectuals, Vargas Llosa was {{initially}} {{a supporter of}} the Cuban revolutionary government of Fidel Castro. He studied Marxism in depth as a university student and was later persuaded by communist ideals after the success of the Cuban Revolution. Gradually, Vargas Llosa came to believe that socialism was incompatible with what he considered to be general liberties and freedoms. The official rupture between the writer and the policies of the <b>Cuban</b> <b>government</b> occurred with the so-called 'Padilla Affair', when the Castro regime imprisoned the poet Heberto Padilla for a month in 1971. Vargas Llosa, along with other intellectuals of the time, wrote to Castro protesting the Cuban political system and its imprisonment of the artist. Vargas Llosa has identified himself with liberalism rather than extreme left-wing political ideologies ever since. Since he relinquished his earlier leftism, he has opposed both left- and right-wing authoritarian regimes.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Cuban</b> <b>government</b> joined {{negotiations}} on 28 January 1988, {{and all three}} parties held a round of {{negotiations on}} 9 March.

Representatives from the governments of Angola, Cuba, and South Africa signed the New York Accords, granting independence to Namibia and ending the direct involvement of foreign troops in the civil war, in New York City on 22 December 1988. The United Nations Security Council passed Resolution 626 later that day, creating the United Nations Angola Verification Mission (UNAVEM), a peacekeeping force. UNAVEM troops began arriving in Angola in January 1989.|$|E
5|$|Already {{suffering}} from food shortages {{due to a}} five-month drought, President Fidel Castro announced {{that the government would}} supply people under the age of 14 and those over 60, which accounts for roughly 36% of Cuba's population, with extra food aid. An estimated 156,000 tonnes of food was set aside for this action and the food was worth several million dollars. People who qualified for the aid would receive 4.4lbs (2kg) of rice and peas if they lived in western Cuba and 6.6lbs (3kg) if they lived in eastern Cuba per month until July 1999. The United Nations World Food Program provided $20.5million in aid for both the effects of the drought and Georges. By December, the <b>Cuban</b> <b>Government</b> requested $90million to help recover from the hurricane and drought. By this time, about $40million had already been set aside for the same reason. The Cuban Red Cross supplied shelter for more than 92,000 residents and supplied them with hygiene kits, food, water, and other relief materials.|$|E
