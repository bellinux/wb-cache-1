25|$|Light-skinned {{people living}} in high {{sunlight}} environments {{are more susceptible to}} the harmful UV rays of sunlight {{because of the lack of}} melanin produced in the skin.

40|$|This chapter {{addresses}} {{the role of}} students’ <b>cultural</b> <b>practices</b> in mathematical tasks {{as a means to}} enhance discourse and communication in multicultural classes. It starts by presenting the features of mathematical discourse and highlighting their relationship with students’ native language and culture. Next, the concept of <b>cultural</b> <b>practices</b> is discussed and framed in the context of mathematics education. Its potential to launch the construction of mathematical meanings is explored. The integration of students’ <b>cultural</b> <b>practices</b> in the teaching and learning of mathematics is illustrated and discussed through the presentation of examples taken from classroom activities. These examples were collected from a research project that used a qualitative methodological approach to study the integration of students’ <b>cultural</b> <b>practices</b> in the teaching and learning of mathematics. Participants were students in a seventh-grade class in a coastal area in the south of Portugal. Students’ <b>cultural</b> <b>practices</b> such as surfing were adapted and presented through activities that supported the learning of mathematical concepts. The chapter concludes by arguing for the contributions of students’ <b>cultural</b> <b>practices</b> to the development of their ability to communicate mathematically in the context of classroom, to use appropriate forms of language, and to connect mathematics to their daily experiences...|$|R

The Varemba ethnic group is a distinct group in Zvishavane, this is due to their unique way of life, their <b>cultural</b> <b>practices</b> includes Komba initiation rite, Murundu, virginity testing, testing for fertility, Female genital Mutilation (FGM), Child marriages, and inheritance. Komba is an initiation school for girls and Murundu is a school for boys and the Varemba people always attends these initiations and they serve to pass their tradition {{from one generation to the}} other, thus the survival of the Varemba <b>cultural</b> <b>practices</b> in Zvishavane district. Varemba culture survives due to the fact that it had been hidden in secrecy; therefore it has not been pervaded. There are various reasons for the survival of Varemba <b>cultural</b> <b>practices</b> and these include formation of alliances with emergent powers, acquiring higher post in their communities for instance becoming the Members of Parliament in the Varemba ethnic group and creation of their dynasties such as the Mposi dynasty. Many tribesâ€™ <b>cultural</b> <b>practices</b> were washed away by colonialism but for the Varemba this was not the case due to various factors such as geographical location, the observance of strict endogamous way of life and the nature of the Varemba <b>cultural</b> <b>practices.</b> The Varemba ethnic groups make use of their medical knowledge to earn respect from other tribes and they managed to influence other groups to adopt their own religious practices and this preserved the Varemba <b>cultural</b> <b>practices.</b> There is lot of criticisms which were put forward by many local and international organizations concerning the Varemba <b>cultural</b> <b>practices</b> but it did not whip away their <b>cultural</b> <b>practices.</b> Thus, the survival of the Varemba cultural activities due to the fact that all the police which were introduced was not efficient...|$|R

40|$|International audienceCultural {{practices}} {{indicators are}} widely used but their definitions are mainly specific to each analysis. The main purpose of this presentation is to provide some insights regarding the possibility of common <b>cultural</b> <b>practices</b> indicators for quantitative analysis at the individual level. This could be useful to allow easier comparisons among European societies and between individuals within countries. Moreover, this could be an appealing way for culture to become much more considered in interaction with other fields of research. <b>Cultural</b> <b>practices</b> are considered here through a broad definition: all free times activities are included. The presentation is structured as follow. First, {{a survey of the}} already existing <b>cultural</b> <b>practices</b> indicators is considered. This underlines the heterogeneity of these indicators. Second, the presentation focuses on the various potential uses of <b>cultural</b> <b>practices</b> indicators in order to identify – thus in a positive way – the broad shape of a desirable indicator. This underlines both conflicts regarding the manner <b>cultural</b> <b>practices</b> are represented and key points where these different uses could need a common approach. Third, a way to obtain common <b>cultural</b> <b>practices</b> indicators is offered and discussed.

25|$|In {{his most}} recent {{contributions}} to game studies, The Formation of Gaming Culture, Kirkpatrick {{has focused on the}} history of gameplay, looking at when the idea became the central term of game criticism in the 1980s. He argues that this corresponds to the period when games played on computers and arcade machines became ‘video (or computer) games’ in the sense we give that phrase today. As a social group formed in connection with the activity of playing the games, 'gamers' produced their own lexicon of game evaluation and appraisal, and their expectations and preferences shaped the subsequent development of gaming as a <b>cultural</b> <b>practice.</b>|$|E
25|$|Additionally, the <b>cultural</b> <b>practice</b> {{of female}} genital {{mutilation}} (FGM) {{is known to}} impact women's health, though {{is difficult to know}} the worldwide extent of this practice. While generally thought of as a Sub-Saharan African practice, it may have roots in the Middle East as well. The estimated 3 million girls who are subjected to FGM each year potentially suffer both immediate and lifelong negative effects. Immediately following FGM, girls commonly experience excessive bleeding and urine retention. Long-term consequences include urinary tract infections, bacterial vaginosis, pain during intercourse, and difficulties in childbirth that include prolonged labor, vaginal tears, and excessive bleeding. Women who have undergone FGM also have higher rates of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and herpes simplex virus 2 (HSV2) than women who have not.|$|E
25|$|Symbolism is {{an ancient}} <b>cultural</b> <b>practice</b> in Assam and {{is still a very}} {{important}} part of Assamese way of life. Various elements are being used to represent beliefs, feelings, pride, identity, etc. Tamulpan, Xorai and Gamosa are three important symbolic elements in Assamese culture. Tamulpan (the areca nut and betel leaves) or guapan (gua from kwa) are considered along with the Gamosa (a typical woven cotton or silk cloth with embroidery) as the offers of devotion, respect and friendship. The Tamulpan-tradition {{is an ancient}} one and is being followed since time-immemorial with roots in the aboriginal Austro-Asiatic culture. Xorai is a traditionally manufactured bell-metal article of great respect and is used as a container-medium while performing respectful offers. Moreover, symbolically many ethno-cultural groups use specific clothes to portray respect and pride.|$|E
40|$|A {{number of}} studies have shown that HIV {{awareness}} is very high among Malawians and yet infection rates are rising. Local <b>cultural</b> <b>practices</b> have been identified as contributing to this contradictory situation. Using data from 12 focus-group discussions collected in Balaka, Zomba, Machinga and Mangochi, the paper explores the reformulation of nine <b>cultural</b> <b>practices</b> as a preventive measure against HIV. The study reveals that <b>cultural</b> <b>practices</b> that involve sexual acts for completion are mediated through condoms and HIV tests. The study also shows that traditional herbs known for healing ailments are repurposed to symbolise sexual acts. We conclude that the idea of repurposing offers an avenue in which initiation and cleansing rites that involve sexual acts are replaced by other semiotics such as a traditional medicine called mtela. We also conclude that the modifications to <b>cultural</b> <b>practices</b> do not indicate complete abandonment of associated traditions, rather, they constitute the renegotiation of <b>cultural</b> <b>practices</b> and meanings associated with particular rites of passage. Lastly, we propose that a comprehensive prevention programme needs {{to be part of a}} wider national HIV-prevention effort combining a women and child rights and empowerment agenda and, critically, lifestyle lessons in a process of cultural renegotiation.

25|$|People of all {{languages}} rely to {{some extent}} on visual information in speech perception, but {{the intensity of the}} McGurk effect can change between languages. Dutch, English, Spanish, German and Italian language listeners experience a robust McGurk effect, while it is weaker for Japanese and Chinese listeners. Most research on the McGurk effect between languages has been conducted between English and Japanese. There is a smaller McGurk effect in Japanese listeners than in English listeners. The <b>cultural</b> <b>practice</b> of face avoidance in Japanese people may {{have an effect on the}} McGurk effect, as well as tone and syllabic structures of the language. This could also be why Chinese listeners are less susceptible to visual cues, and similar to Japanese, produce a smaller effect than English listeners. Studies have also shown that Japanese listeners do not show a developmental increase in visual influence after the age of six, as English children do. Japanese listeners are more able to identify an incompatibility between the visual and auditory stimulus than English listeners are. This result could be in relation to the fact that in Japanese, consonant clusters do not exist. In noisy environments where speech is unintelligible, however, people of all languages resort to using visual stimuli and are then equally subject to the McGurk effect. The McGurk effect works with speech perceivers of every language for which it has been tested.|$|E

In October 1971 Rúhíyyih Khanum returned from western Africa. She stopped for a time in Mamfe and spoke to the Bahá'ís there and emphasized {{the role of women in}} the growth of the religion. From Mamfe she traveled more widely seeing villages and regional chiefs, attending weddings and giving talks at schools. In many places she took note of women in prominent positions in the community and sometimes spoke to about the Bahá'í law of monogamy to contrast with the traditional <b>cultural</b> <b>practice</b> of polygamy and other traditional forms. A prominent meeting was of the regional conference calling for the progress of the religion in the region. She took part in the program of observances of United Nations Day sharing the stage with members of the staff of the Secretary-General of the UN as well as the staff of the Prime Minister of Cameroon. Reaching Buea she met with the Prime Minister and mentioned her wide travels in relative safety with kind assistance of villagers and truck drivers.

40|$|Abstract. In this paper, {{we argue}} that mating games, a concept that denotes <b>cultural</b> <b>practices</b> {{characterized}} by a competitive element and an ornamental character, are essential drivers behind the emergence and maintenance of human <b>cultural</b> <b>practices.</b> In order to substantiate this claim, we sketch out the essential role of the game’s players and audience, {{as well as the}} ways in which games can mature and turn into relatively stable <b>cultural</b> <b>practices.</b> After outlining the life phase of mating games – their emergence, rise, maturation, and possible eventual decline – we go on to argue that participation in these games (in each phase) does make sense from an adaptationist point of view. The strong version of our theory which proposes that all <b>cultural</b> <b>practices</b> are, or once were, mating games, allows us to derive a set of testable predictions for the fields of archaeology, economics, and psychology...|$|R
