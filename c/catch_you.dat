[...] from the third verse, are explained by William Buckholz in his 2011 book, Understand Rap: Explanations of Confusing Rap Lyrics You and Your Grandma Can Understand.

Buckholz {{goes on to say that}} there are times where everyone longs for the company of someone—be a friend or significant other—so they can share feelings and troubles with.|$|E

His account in De Profundis was less triumphant: [...] "It was when, in my library at Tite Street, waving his small hands in the air in epileptic fury, your father... stood uttering every foul word his foul mind could think of, and screaming the loathsome threats he afterwards with such cunning carried out". Queensberry only described the scene once, saying Wilde had [...] "shown him the white feather", meaning he had acted in a cowardly way. Though trying to remain calm, Wilde saw that he was becoming ensnared in a brutal family quarrel. He did not wish to bear Queensberry's insults, but he knew to confront him could lead to disaster were his liaisons disclosed publicly.|$|E
500|$|Since Valene, I’ve {{tried to}} do {{anything}} and everything but play a goody-two-shoes. I love Val, I adore her. But I spent a total of 15 years—if you count the first year I played her on Dallas. That was quite an investment for me as an actress. If you were playing a goody-two-shoes today, the tabloid media would be dying to <b>catch</b> <b>you</b> on a bad day. [...] Look at what they’ve done to Tiger Woods. Look at what they’ve done to that man. My feeling is his father—or the absence of his father in his life—is (the root of) what’s going on with Tiger and that marriage. But the media won’t leave him alone. No matter who you are, (the celebrity coverage) is obsessive and constant. It’s hurtful. For me, if they show my face in a bad photo, they latch into me hook, line and sinker. Even Entertainment Tonight now has blood on their hands. It's brutal. I wonder what they’ll do with Alec Baldwin now. He was my brother on Knots. They really threw him under a bus (when endlessly publicizing his infamous voice-mail rant against daughter Ireland, then 11, in 2007). He loves that child so much." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2004, Anggun {{returned}} to Paris and landed {{a new record}} deal with Heben Music, a French independent label. She began working on her next album with several producers, including Jean-Pierre Taieb and Frederic Jaffre. Anggun, who composed mainly in English, {{enlisted the help of}} several well-known French songwriters, such as Jean Fauque, Lionel Florence, Tété and Evelyn Kral to adapt her English songs into French. In late 2004, Anggun released her first solo French single in nearly four years, [...] "Être une femme". The single was available in two versions: one solo version for commercial release and a duet with Diam's for radio release. It became Anggun's second top 20 hit in France, peaking at number 16 on the French Singles Chart. It also became Anggun's first French single to chart on the Swiss Singles Chart, peaking at number 58. Released in February 2005, Anggun's third French album, Luminescence, entered the French Albums Chart at number 30 and was later certified gold for selling 100,000 copies. The second single, [...] "Cesse la pluie" [...] also became a hit, peaking at number 10 in Belgium, 22 in France and 65 in Switzerland. According to Francophonie Diffusion, [...] "Être une femme" [...] and [...] "Cesse la pluie" [...] were the second and the fifth most-played French single of 2005 worldwide, respectively. In 2005, Anggun also took part in the compilation album Ma quando dici amore, released by the Italian singer Ron.

500|$|Tracy was {{particularly}} respected for his naturalism on screen. Hume Cronyn, {{who worked with}} Tracy on The Seventh Cross, admired his co-star's screen presence: [...] "His method appeared to {{be as simple as}} it is difficult to achieve. He appeared to do nothing. He listened, he felt, he said the words without forcing anything." [...] Joan Crawford likewise expressed her admiration for Tracy's seemingly effortless performances. His four-time co-star Joan Bennett said, [...] "One never had the feeling he was 'acting' in a scene, {{but the truth of the}} situation was actually happening, spontaneously, at the moment he spoke his lines." [...] James Cagney noted that Tracy was rarely the target of impressionists, because [...] "You can't mimic reserve and control very well" [...] and [...] "there's nothing to imitate except his genius and that can't be mimicked." [...] Specifically, Tracy was praised for his listening and reacting skills. Barry Nelson said that Tracy [...] "brought the art of reacting to a new height"; Stanley Kramer declared that Tracy [...] "thought and listened better than anyone in the history of motion pictures". Millard Kaufman noted that [...] " [...] listened with every fiber of his entire body". Burt Reynolds, in But Enough About Me, similarly noted Tracy's emphasis on naturalism when, as a rookie actor, he observed Tracy on the sets of Inherit the Wind. When Reynolds later introduced himself to Tracy as an actor, Tracy replied, [...] "An actor, huh? Just remember not to ever let anyone <b>catch</b> <b>you</b> at it." ...|$|E
500|$|The album {{opens with}} a {{rendition}} of Clyde Otis' [...] "This Bitter Earth", a song popularized by Dinah Washington and later added to Aretha Franklin's repertoire, followed by [...] "He's Funny That Way" [...] (Neil Moret, Richard A. Whiting). Both tracks include improvisations by Walton on piano. According to Dorothy Hill, blues editor for Jazz Now, listeners can hear James [...] "murmuring admiration" [...] for Walton's piano work {{in the background of}} [...] "He's Funny That Way". [...] "In My Solitude", originally by Duke Ellington, features a [...] "passionate" [...] interlude by Red Holloway on tenor saxophone. Other standards appearing on the album include [...] "There Is No Greater Love" [...] (Isham Jones, Marty Symes), Joe Greene's [...] "Don't Let the Sun <b>Catch</b> <b>You</b> Crying", and [...] "Love Letters", originally written by Edward Heyman and Victor Young. Sklair arranged the latter song and performed on guitar; also featured is Rick Baptist on flugelhorn. [...] "These Foolish Things", originally written by Harry Link, Holt Marvell and Jack Strachey, previously appeared on James' 1995 album of the same name. Harold Arlen and Johnny Mercer's [...] "Come Rain or Come Shine" [...] is followed by [...] "Don't Worry 'bout Me" [...] (Rube Bloom, Ted Koehler). Leading up to the album's close are Arthur Hamilton's [...] "Cry Me a River", [...] "Don't Blame Me" [...] (Dorothy Fields, Jimmy McHugh), and [...] "My Man" [...] which features a trombone solo by George Bohannon.

In the speech given in Tallinding, Jammeh gave a [...] "final ultimatum" [...] to any gays or lesbians in the Gambia to leave the country. In a speech to the United Nations on 27 September 2013, Jammeh said that [...] "omosexuality in all its forms and manifestations which, though very evil, antihuman as well as anti-Allah, is being promoted as a human right by some powers", and that those who do so [...] "want {{to put an end to}} human existence". In 2014, Jammeh called homosexuals [...] "vermins" [...] by saying that [...] "We will fight these vermins called homosexuals or gays the same way we are fighting malaria-causing mosquitoes, if not more aggressively". He also went on to disparage the LGBT by saying that [...] "As far as I am concerned, LGBT can only stand for Leprosy, Gonorrhoea, Bacteria and Tuberculosis; all of which are detrimental to human existence".
