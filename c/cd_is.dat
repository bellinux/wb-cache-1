5|$|In the PlayStation version, a mini-game of Galaxian can {{be played}} as the game loads. If won, eight {{additional}} cars become available. Once the game has loaded, the <b>CD</b> <b>is</b> needed only to play six music tracks. The disc can be replaced {{at any time during}} gameplay, although the game does not update; regardless of what disc is inserted, there will always be six tracks, corresponding to the starting points of the tracks on the game disc.|$|E
5|$|Proposed definition: The candela, symbol <b>cd,</b> <b>is</b> the SI unit of {{luminous}} intensity {{in a given}} direction. It is defined by taking the fixed numerical value of the luminous efficacy of monochromatic radiation of frequency , Kcd, to be 683 when expressed in the unit lm⋅W−1, which is equal to cd⋅sr⋅W−1, or cd⋅sr⋅kg−1⋅m−2⋅s3, where the kilogram, metre and second are {{defined in terms of}} h, c and ΔνCs.|$|E

5|$|The Sega CD {{can only}} be used in {{conjunction}} with a Genesis system, attaching through an expansion slot {{on the side of the}} main console. Though the Sega <b>CD</b> <b>is</b> an add-on, it does require its own separate power supply. In addition to playing its own library of games in CD-ROM format, the Sega CD can also play compact discs, karaoke CD+G discs, and can also be {{used in conjunction with}} the 32X to play 32-bit games that utilize both add-ons. The second model, also known as the Sega CD 2, also includes a steel joining plate to be screwed into the bottom of the Genesis, as well as an extension spacer to work with the original model of the Genesis.|$|E
5|$|The {{concert in}} Cologne was {{recorded}} and released as an album titled Symphonic Odysseys by Dog Ear Records, Nobuo Uematsu's recording label. It was announced {{to be in}} production on October 26, 2011, and released on December 28, 2011. The artwork for the album features {{a cross between a}} sword and a violin on a white background, in the vein of the Symphonic Fantasies album, which had a cross between a violin and a game controller. The cover art was produced by German design house Schech, who earlier provided the artwork for the European release of Symphonic Fantasies. Accompanying the <b>CD</b> <b>is</b> a booklet which contains photos of the concert and discusses the arrangers and compositions included in each song. The album contains everything played at the concert, with the Final Fantasy suite split into three tracks, and the album is split at the intermission into two CDs. Its fourteen tracks have a duration of 1:34:56. While Dog Ear Records published the album in Japan, the album was released in Europe through the online music retailer MAZ-Sound.|$|E

5|$|The main CPU of the Sega <b>CD</b> <b>is</b> a 12.5MHz 16-bit Motorola 68000 processor, {{which runs}} 5MHz {{faster than the}} Genesis processor. It {{contains}} 1 Mbit of boot ROM, allocated for the CD game BIOS, CD player software, and compatibility with CD+G discs. 6 Mbit of RAM are allocated to data for programs, pictures, and sounds; 512 Kbit to PCM waveform memory; 128 Kbit to CD-ROM data cache memory; and an additional 64 Kbit are allocated as the backup memory. Additional backup memory {{in the form of}} a 1 Mbit Backup RAM Cartridge was also available as a separate purchase, released near the end of the system's life. Audio is able to be supplied through the Ricoh RF5C164, and two RCA pin jacks allow the Sega CD to output stereophonic sound separate from the Genesis. Combining stereo sound from a Genesis to either version of the Sega CD requires a cable between the Genesis's headphone jack and an input jack on the back of the CD unit. This is not required for the second model of the Genesis.|$|E
5|$|There are two {{separate}} sets of drama CDs {{based on the}} Clannad series. The first set, produced by Frontier Works, contains five CDs each focusing on a different heroine in Clannad story ranging from Nagisa, to Kotomi, Fuko, Kyou, and Tomoyo. The first volume was released in Japan on April 25, 2007 as a limited edition with an extra track added. The second through fifth volumes followed in one month increments between May 25, 2007 and August 24, 2007. The second set, produced by Prototype, contains four CDs; the first was released on July 25, 2007. Volumes two through four were released in one month intervals after that, with the last being released on October 24, 2007. Each <b>CD</b> <b>is</b> based on the stories from the Official Another Story Clannad: Hikari Mimamoru Sakamichi de collection. The artist GotoP, who provided the illustrations for the short stories, also illustrates the drama CD covers. The drama CDs, with text and visuals, are available as downloadable content via Xbox Live and the PlayStation Store when playing the Xbox 360 and PS3 versions of Clannad, respectively.|$|E

25|$|The {{recordable}} audio <b>CD</b> <b>is</b> {{designed to}} be used in a consumer audio CD recorder. These consumer audio CD recorders use SCMS (Serial Copy Management System), an early form of digital rights management (DRM), to conform to the AHRA (Audio Home Recording Act). The Recordable Audio <b>CD</b> <b>is</b> typically somewhat more expensive than CD-R due to lower production volume and a 3% AHRA royalty used to compensate the music industry for the making of a copy.|$|E
