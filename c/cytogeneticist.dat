5|$|Barbara McClintock (June 16, 1902 – September 2, 1992) was an American {{scientist}} and <b>cytogeneticist</b> who {{was awarded the}} 1983 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. McClintock received her PhD in botany from Cornell University in 1927. There she started her career as the leader {{in the development of}} maize cytogenetics, the focus of her research {{for the rest of her}} life. From the late 1920s, McClintock studied chromosomes and how they change during reproduction in maize. She developed the technique for visualizing maize chromosomes and used microscopic analysis to demonstrate many fundamental genetic ideas. One of those ideas was the notion of genetic recombination by crossing-over during meiosis—a mechanism by which chromosomes exchange information. She produced the first genetic map for maize, linking regions of the chromosome to physical traits. She demonstrated the role of the telomere and centromere, regions of the chromosome that are important in the conservation of genetic information. She was recognized among the best in the field, awarded prestigious fellowships, and elected a member of the National Academy of Sciences in 1944.|$|E

40|$|In situ {{hybridization}} methods {{allow the}} detection of specific DNA sequences on whole chromosomes. The technique has been widely used as a diagnostic and research tool by animal <b>cytogeneticists,</b> for whom detection of unique sequences on mammalian chromosomes is routinely achieved. However, detection of unique sequences on plant chromosomes is less reliable. The recently developed primer-induced in situ hybridization (PRINS) technique allows rapid and reliable in situ detection by the hybridization of primers to denatured target DNA, followed by extension with DNA polymerase {{in the presence of}} a labeled nucleotide. The use of short oligonucleotide primers could allow improved penetration of debris and highly condensed chromatin common in preparations of plant chromosomes, thus increasing the sensitivity of in situ detection. The feasibility of this approach is demonstrated by the oligonucleotide primer-mediated detection of the B-hordein gene cluster on a barley chromosome. Applications of the PRINS technique for plant <b>cytogeneticists</b> are discussed...|$|R

2500|$|Barbara McClintock {{began her}} career as a maize <b>cytogeneticist.</b> In 1931, McClintock and Harriet Creighton {{demonstrated}} that cytological recombination of marked chromosomes correlated with recombination of genetic traits (genes). McClintock, while at the Carnegie Institution, continued previous studies on the mechanisms of chromosome breakage and fusion flare in maize. She identified a particular chromosome breakage event that always occurred at the same locus on maize chromosome 9, which she named the [...] "Ds" [...] or [...] "dissociation" [...] locus. McClintock continued her career in cytogenetics studying the mechanics and inheritance of broken and ring (circular) chromosomes of maize. During her cytogenetic work, McClintock discovered transposons, a find which eventually led to her Nobel Prize in 1983.|$|E

40|$|During {{recent years}} a {{considerable}} improvement in diagnostic techniques has enabled <b>cytogeneticists</b> {{to find more}} and smaller chromosomal aberrations. However, accurate clinical knowledge about rare chromosome disorders is frequently lacking, mostly due to a significant decline in publishable cases. On the other hand, there is an increasing demand from parents and physicians for reliable information. In order {{to improve the quality}} and the quantity of data available, we designed a new database named the European <b>Cytogeneticists</b> Association Register of Unbalanced Chromosome Aberrations (ECARUCA) at [URL] This Internet-database contains cytogenetic and clinical data of patients with rare chromosome abnormalities, including microscopically visible aberrations, as well as microdeletions and -duplications. Cases with certain breakpoints collected in the Zurich Cytogenetic Database were transferred to ECARUCA. The advantages of ECARUCA compared to existing sources are that ECARUCA is interactive, dynamic and has long-term possibilities to store cytogenetic, molecular and clinical data. Professionals can login to submit new cases and perform searches in the database through the Internet. Currently the database contains 1500 unique chromosomal aberrations from almost 4000 patients. A frequent submission of new data ensures the up-to-date quality of the collection. Individual parent accounts allow parents to inform the ECARUCA team about the follow-up of their child. The ECARUCA database provides health care workers with accurate information on clinical aspects of rare chromosome disorders. Additionally, detailed correlations between chromosome aberrations and their phenotypes are of invaluable help in localising genes for mental retardation and congenital anomalies...|$|R
