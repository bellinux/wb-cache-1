5|$|In fluid dynamics, <b>Couette</b> flow is {{the flow}} of a viscous fluid {{in the space between}} two surfaces, one of which is moving {{tangentially}} relative to the other. The configuration often takes the form of two parallel plates or the gap between two concentric cylinders. The flow is driven by virtue of viscous drag force acting on the fluid, but may additionally be motivated by an applied pressure gradient in the flow direction. The <b>Couette</b> configuration models certain practical problems, like flow in lightly loaded journal bearings, and is often employed in viscometry and to demonstrate approximations of reversibility. This type of flow is named in honor of Maurice <b>Couette,</b> a Professor of Physics at the French University of Angers in the late 19th century.|$|E

25|$|An example {{where the}} mere Reynolds number is not {{sufficient}} for similarity of flows (or even the flow regime – laminar or turbulent) are bounded flows, i.e. flows that are restricted by walls or other boundaries.

Principles of these restrictions were developed by Maurice Marie Alfred <b>Couette</b> and Geoffrey Ingram Taylor and developed further by Floris Takens and David Ruelle.|$|E

2500|$|Derivation of the {{kinetic model}} for shear {{viscosity}} usually starts by considering a <b>Couette</b> flow where two parallell plates {{are separated by}} a gas layer of thickness (or height) [...] The upper plate is moving at a constant velocity to the right due to a force [...] The lower plate is stationary, and an equal and opposite force must therefore be acting on it to keep it at rest.

50|$|In fluid dynamics, the Taylor-Couette flow {{consists}} of a viscous fluid confined in the gap between two rotating cylinders. For low angular velocities, measured by the Reynolds number Re, the flow is steady and purely azimuthal. This basic state is known as circular <b>Couette</b> flow, after Maurice Marie Alfred <b>Couette</b> who used this experimental device {{as a means to}} measure viscosity. Sir Geoffrey Ingram Taylor investigated the stability of <b>Couette</b> flow in a ground-breaking paper. Taylor's paper became a cornerstone in the development of hydrodynamic stability theory and demonstrated that the no-slip condition, which was in dispute by the scientific community at the time, was the correct boundary condition for viscous flows at a solid boundary.|$|E

5000|$|On {{the other}} hand, the {{spectrum}} of eigenvalues for <b>Couette</b> flow indicates stability, at all Reynolds numbers. [...] However, in experiments, <b>Couette</b> flow {{is found to be}} unstable to small, but finite, perturbations for which the linear theory, and the Orr-Sommerfeld equation do not apply. It has been argued that the non-normality of the eigenvalue problem associated with <b>Couette</b> (and indeed, Poiseuille) flow might explain that observed instability. [...] That is, the eigenfunctions of the Orr-Sommerfeld operator are complete but non-orthogonal. Then, the energy of the disturbance contains contributions from all eigenfunctions of the Orr-Sommerfeld equation. Even if the energy associated with each eigenvalue considered separately is decaying exponentially in time (as predicted by the Orr-Sommerfeld analysis for the <b>Couette</b> flow), the cross terms arising from the non-orthogonality of the eigenvalues can increase transiently. Thus, the total energy increases transiently (before tending asymptotically to zero). The argument is that if the magnitude of this transient growth is sufficiently large, it destabilizes the laminar flow, however this argument has not been universally accepted.|$|E

In {{the case of a}} system which is not rotating uniformly, such as the case of cylindrical <b>Couette</b> flow, where the outer cylinder is stationary and the inner cylinder is rotating, inertial forces will often tend to destabilize a system, whereas viscous forces tend to stabilize a system and damp out perturbations and turbulence.|$|E
