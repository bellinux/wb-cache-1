40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{investigation}} was to study the role of dilation in delaying shrinkage cracking of concrete and the possibility of producing shrinkage crack-free concrete. The experimental programme consisted of two parts. In the first part, end-restrained concrete beams were water-cured for one and three days before drying under controlled temperature (35 °C) and relative humidity (25 %) conditions. In the second part, concrete beams were water-cured for one and three days before drying in outdoor summer conditions in Baghdad, Iraq. For all specimens, various parameters were measured, including free-shrinkage strain, tensile strain capacity, elastic tensile strain <b>capacity,</b> <b>creep</b> in tension and cracking time. The experimental results show that none of the concrete specimens dried under natural outdoor conditions cracked in spite of high temperatures (up to 60 °C) and low relative humidity (less than 15 %). This is due to dilation in the form of increased creep in tension with variations in temperature and relative humidity. Increasing water-curing duration usually delays shrinkage and always delays or prevents cracking; it increases tensile strain capacity, which reduces the probability of cracking for all specimens dried in natural or controlled conditions...|$|E

Unfortunately, most current digital forensics tools fall short in several ways. First, they are unable to cope with the ever-increasing storage capacity of target devices. As these storage <b>capacities</b> <b>creep</b> into hundreds of gigabytes or terabytes, the traditional approach of utilizing a single workstation to perform a digital forensics investigation against a single evidence source (e. g., a hard drive) will become completely intractable. Further, huge targets will require more sophisticated analysis techniques, such as automated categorization of images. We believe that the next generation of digital forensics tools will employ high-performance computing, more sophisticated evidence discovery and analysis techniques, and better collaborative functions to allow digital forensics investigators to perform investigations much more efficiently than they do today. This chapter examines the next generation of digital forensics tools...|$|R
40|$|Creep {{and damage}} in {{concrete}} govern the long-term deformability of concrete. Thus, {{it is important}} to understand the interaction between creep and damage in order to design reliable civil engineering structures subjected to high level loading during a long time. Many investigations have been performed on the influence of concrete mixture, the effect of the bond between the matrix and the aggregates, temperature, aging and the size effect on the cracking mechanism and fracture parameters of concrete. But there is a lack of results on the influence of the creep loading history. In the present paper, an experimental investigation on the fracture properties of concrete beams submitted to three point bending tests with high levels of sustained load that deals with creep is reported. The results aim first to investigate the ranges of variation of the time response due to creep damage coupled effects under constant load and secondly to evaluate the residual <b>capacity</b> after <b>creep...</b>|$|R
40|$|The solar {{radiation}} received at the Earth’s surface helps power the photochemical processes in photosynthesis. However, under sunlight, photosynthetic organisms are unavoidably exposed to potentially harmful levels of ultraviolet and visible light radiation. Consequently, plants have developed many mechanisms for the avoidance and dissipation of excess light energy. The growth of crops under increased solar irradiance during sub- and supra-optimal temperature conditions is an obstacle for increasing seasonal crop {{production in the}} transition zone. New methods for reducing the photoinhibitory effects of solar irradiation have been observed {{in the field of}} turfgrass. Through the application of pigment compounds to the surface of plant leaves, {{it may be possible to}} reduce levels of solar incident light exposure to the plant, during temperatures where the fixation of CO 2 is a limiting factor in Photosystem II repair.

40|$|Graduation date: 2005 Chewings fescue [Festuca rubra L. subsp. fallax (Thuill.) Nyman] is {{a desired}} turfgrass with dense sod forming {{capabilities}} and superior shade tolerance. Thermal residue management (open-field burning) {{has traditionally been}} used to remove post-harvest residue and maintain seed yield {{over the life of}} the stand. However, alternative non-thermal residue management practices have been observed to produce adequate seed yields dependent upon cultivar. Strong creeping red fescue (F. rubra L. subsp. rubra) is desired for its prolific tillering <b>capacity</b> and <b>creeping</b> rhizomatous growth habit. In contrast to Chewings fescue, maintenance of seed yield in strong creeping red fescue has only been profitably produced under thermal residue management. Slender creeping red fescue [F. rubra L. var. littoralis (Vasey) ] is a desired turfgrass with a compact, less rhizomatous growth habit, similar to Chewings fescue in desirable turf attributes. However, little is known about the effects of post-harvest residue management in slender creeping red fescue. The objectives of this study were: 1) to evaluate seed yield and yield components among different cultivars to thermal (open-burning), and non-thermal (flail low and flail high) post-harvest residue management; 2) to evaluate harvest index and percent cleanout to thermal and non-thermal residue management in different cultivars; and 3) and to provide an economic analysis of thermal and non-thermal residue management in all cultivars based on partial budgeting. Three post-harvest residue management treatments (burn, flail low and flail high) were applied over the course of two years. Seed yield components measured included: total dry weight, fertile tiller number, spikelets per panicle, florets per spikelet, and panicle length. Final seed yield in each cultivar and residue management treatment method was determined after seed harvest and conditioning. Seed yield component analysis was conducted over three production seasons. Chewings fescue, strong creeping red fescue, and slender creeping red fescue cultivars responded differently to residue management as indicated by a residue management by cultivar interaction. In 2003 and 2004, residue management by cultivar interactions were evident in seed number, seed weight, fertile tiller number, percent cleanout, harvest index, and seed yield. Residue management by cultivar interactions occurred in spikelets per panicle in 2003, whereas in 2004 a residue management by cultivar interaction occurred in panicle length and florets per spikelet. In 2004, non-thermal flail low, and thermal residue management resulted in significantly greater spikelets per panicle in all cultivars. Thermal residue management resulted in the greatest number of spikelets per panicle. Results indicate that thermal residue management best maintained seed yield in most subspecies and cultivars across both years. However, in 2003, non-thermal flail low residue management produced profitable seed yield in only Marker slender creeping red fescue. In contrast, thermal residue management resulted in poor seed yields in Marker slender creeping red fescue and enhanced yields in Seabreeze slender creeping red fescue in 2003. However, following the second year of thermal treatment in 2004, Marker and Seabreeze both had lower seed yields, thus exhibiting the only negative impact of thermal management among the cultivars tested in this study. Moreover, upon review of an economic analysis, Marker slender red fescue was the only cultivar that produced a positive net return of 78 and 4 ha⁻¹ under non-thermal residue management in 2003 and 2004, respectively. Furthermore, in 2003, thermal residue management net return increases ranged from 104 ha⁻¹ to - 996 ha⁻¹ in Barnica and Shademark, respectively. In 2004, thermal residue management net return increases ranged from 115 ha⁻¹ and 1, 332 ha⁻¹ in Seabreeze and Shademark, respectively. Poor seed yields were observed in all strong creeping red fescue cultivars under non-thermal residue management across both years of the study. This may be attributed to an observed reduction in fertile tiller number and seed yield. In addition, percent seed cleanout was increased with non-thermal residue management. In 2004, as stand age increased, thermal residue management resulted in greater seed yields in all cultivars and species, except both cultivars of slender creeping red fescue. Thus, this study provided substantial evidence that thermal residue management has the potential to maintain or increase fine fescue seed yield as stands age as well as to maintain stand profitability...|$|R
40|$|STRUCTURAL PERFORMANCE OF BAMBOO: CAPACITY UNDER SUSTAINED LOADS AND MONOTONIC BENDING Jennifer M. Gottron, M. S. University of Pittsburgh, 2014 The {{exploration}} of the structural material properties of bamboo is motivated by its potential {{to serve as an}} alternative sustainable building material. Although bamboo {{has been used as a}} building material for thousands of years, the majority of applications do not conform to any standard design criteria and are therefore considered to be non-, or at best marginally-engineered construction. Nonetheless, as a result of the composite-like structure of bamboo, its mechanical properties are generally superior to those of other natural materials such as timber. The current research addresses the capacity of bamboo under sustained loads and monotonic bending. The sustained loads intend to develop an understanding of the material creep behavior. The effects of creep on radially-cut clear bamboo specimens will be evaluated based on a series of parameters, mainly the ratio of the ultimate load applied to specimen and the orientation of the specimen with respect to the fiber gradation. Specimens were subject to sustained loads for a period of 90 days. Following 10 days of recovery, the residual <b>capacity</b> of the <b>creep</b> specimens was determined. Significant creep-induced plastic deformations and strains were observed in the present work. The orientation of the specimen was found to have a significant effect on both the creep behavior and residual strength of creep-conditioned specimens. The results showed that bamboo loaded with the outer culm-wall in tension (OT) generally exhibited a greater modulus of rupture but reduced apparent modulus of elasticity and residual strength when compared to specimens with outer culm-wall in compression (OC). Additionally the effects of creep conditioning appear to have a strengthening effect on the residual capacity of OC specimens and a detrimental effects on OT specimens. The results of the creep experiments met or exceeded the ASTM 6815 acceptance criteria for wood suggesting that for the structural design of bamboo, a load duration factor similar to that used for wood may be employed. While the creep tests explored only one species of bamboo, the culm bending tests investigated the longitudinal shear capacity of two species. Longitudinal splitting often dominates failure in bamboo components; longitudinal splitting in bamboo is thought to be the result of a mixed-mode shear failure which is influenced by both Mode I tension and Mode II shear failures. The research aimed to understand the mixed-mode shear capacity of full-culm bamboo under four point bending by testing standard span culms with longitudinal notches at midspan and unnotched short span culms. Each of the culm bending tests is designed to provoke a mixed-mode shear failure. The data demonstrated a reduction in the pure Mode II capacity of culms in the presence of Mode I component of distortion. Each of the experiments reported maintains the ultimate goal of standardization; the data collected and results provided intend to aid in the development of a standardized design criteria for bamboo structures. ...|$|R
40|$|Creep {{and damage}} in {{concrete}} govern the long-term deformability of concrete. Thus, {{it is important}} to understand the interaction between creep and damage in order to design reliable civil engineering structures subjected to high level loading during a long time. Many investigations have been performed on the influence of concrete mixture, the effect of the bond between the matrix and the aggregates, temperature, aging and the size effect on the cracking mechanism and fracture parameters of concrete. But there is a lack of results on the influence of the creep loading history. In the present paper, an experimental investigation on the fracture properties of concrete beams submitted to three point bending tests with high levels of sustained load that deals with creep is reported. The results aim first to investigate the ranges of variation of the time response due to creep damage coupled effects under constant load and secondly to evaluate the residual <b>capacity</b> after <b>creep.</b> For this purpose a series of tests were carried out on geometrically similar specimens of size 100 x 200 x 800 mm with notch to depth ratio of 0. 2 in all the test specimens. The exchange of moisture was prevented and beams were subjected to a constant load of 70 % and 90 % of the maximum capacity. Three point bending test were realized on specimen at the age of 28 days to determine the characteristics of concrete and the maximum load so we could load the specimens in creep. Threepoint bend creep tests were performed on frames placed in a climate controlled chamber [1]. Then after four months of loading, the beams subjected to creep were removed from the creep frames and then immediately subjected to three-point bending test loading up to failure with a constant loading rate as per RILEM-FMC 50 recommendations. The residual capacity on the notched beams and the evolution of the characteristics of concrete due to the basic creep was considered. The results show that sustained loading had a strengthening effect on concrete, probably because of the consolidation of the hardened cement paste. The influence of creep on fracture energy, fracture toughness, and characteristic length of concrete is also studied. The fracture energy and the characteristic length of concrete increases slightly when creep occurs prior to failure and the size of the fracture process zone increases too. The load-CMOD relationship is linear in the ascending portion and gradually drops off after the peak value in the descending portion. The length of the tail end portion of the softening curve increases with beams subjected to creep. Relatively more ductile fracture behavior was observed with beams subjected to creep. The contribution of non-destructive and instrumental investigation methods is currently exploited to check and measure the evolution of some negative structural phenomena, such as micro-and macro-cracking, finally resulting in a creep-like behaviour. Among these methods, the non-destructive technique based on acoustic Emission proves to be very effective, especially to check and measure micro-cracking that takes place inside a structure under mechanical loading. Thus as a part of the investigation quantitative acoustic emission techniques were applied to investigate microcracking and damage localization in concrete beams. The AE signals were captured with the AE WIN software and further analyzed with Noesis software analysis of acoustic emission data. AE waveforms were generated as elastic waves in concrete due to crack nucleation. And a multichannel data acquisition system was used to record the AE waveforms. During the three point bending tests, quantitative acoustic emission (AE) techniques were used to monitor crack growth and to deduce micro fracture mechanics in concrete beams before and after creep. Several specimens are experimented in order to match each cluster with corresponding damage mechanism of the material under loading. At the same time acoustic emission was used to investigate characteristic of the fracture process zone (length width and macro crack propagation) [4] and to measure energy associated with fracture of concrete test specimens [5]. It is further suggested that AE energy release can be related to actual crack formation energy and the study of the nature of waves release may explain different mechanism as friction and other internal energy dissipation or toughening mechanisms. In addition more experiments were conducted using acoustic emission with the three point bending test and AE with specimen under creep so that the analysis could be capable of detecting events during creep. Then acoustic emission is analyzed and illustrated the correlation between basic displacement and total number of acoustic events or in other terms the damage occurring inside the material under creep [2, 3]...|$|R
40|$|Inspection and {{maintenance}} of industrial gas turbines (IGTs) cost millions of dollars. Growing demand of obtaining higher IGT efficiency leads to higher temperature and pressure operating conditions. Long exposure of turbine components at elevated temperature and pressure makes creep damage critically important to consider during planning, designing and operating conditions. Effective and economic maintenance requires accurate creep deformation, damage evolution and rupture life prediction information. Creep prediction models are {{used to determine the}} state of the turbine components and to schedule the inspection, maintenance and replacement time periods. The more accurate the prediction model, the less is the overall cost by the reduction of over maintenance, lay off time and premature replacement of components. There are many popular models available for each of these creep phenomena. Different models are developed on different assumptions. Use of different models to predict these phenomena may lead to inconsistent creep prediction. It is very important to have one set of constitutive equations that can predict all these creep phenomena. At the same time, the set of equations has to be accurate and easy for application. In the present work an improved Sin-hyperbolic (Sinh) model is introduced. Analytical derivation, numerical analysis and FEM simulations are performed to characterize the <b>capacity</b> to predict <b>creep</b> deformation, damage evolution and creep rupture life. Comparison with other popular models, scope of applicability, advantages over other models and limitations are discussed in detail. Experimental data collected from literature for 304 Stainless Steel (SS) of creep deformation and creep rupture are used to compare the Sinh model with other models at different level of temperature and stress. A process to determine the material constants of both models is clearly elucidated. The results and experimental data fitting curves produced by these model shows that the sinh model produces a continuous damage (from zero to unity) by normalizing the experimental data. It is found that overall the new Sinh model offers more flexibility and prediction accuracy. FEM simulations on notched specimen are conducted. Notches enable the ability to study the effect of stress concentration evolution of creep damage and rupture in components during life prediction modeling. Numerical analysis on notched specimen can provide prediction of creep damage or crack propagation of materials containing defects or initial cracks. In this work, the Sin-hyperbolic (Sinh) model is demonstrated to significantly mitigate mesh dependency and exhibits a nonlocal damage distribution around the crack when compared to the other classical model. Prediction model equations are implemented into FORTRAN using ANSYS Mechanical APLD (ANSYS Parametric Design Language) code to perform the analysis. USERMAT (user material routine) of ANSYS UPF (user-programmable feature) is used to define the mechanical constitutive behavior and stress-strain relations. Finite element analysis of circular notched specimen of 304 Stainless-Steel (SS) show that the Sinh model overcomes the mesh dependency problem, converges to a unique result upon mesh element refinement. Constant load is applied and the modulus of elasticity is degraded as crack propagates with each time steps. Elastic modulus decreases with damage increment and accelerates deformation. A series of simulation at different mesh size are used to check the mesh dependency. Results of single element FEM analysis are matched with experimental data collected from literature to validate the model constants and iteration accuracy. Contour plots of damage evolution, and mesh dependency of crack growth rate are discussed in detail. It is demonstrated that the Sinh model offers better creep damage, and crack growth analysis and significantly improves the stress sensitivity, damage localization, and mesh-dependency of numerical results. ...|$|R
