40|$|This paper, {{prepared}} for the annual meetings of the American Economic Association, discusses how the increases in the U. <b>S.</b> <b>budget</b> deficits since 1980 have affected the economies of Western Europe. The analysis emphasizes that U.

This induced shift in domestic policies is the primary reason why European governments have pressed for {{a reduction in the}} U. <b>S.</b> <b>budget</b> deficits despite the favorable impact of those deficits on European trade surpluses. ...|$|R

40|$|This article {{addresses}} the audience reception of sensationalist newspapers in interwar Australia through {{a case study}} of Sydney weekly Beckett 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Budget.</b> During a libel trial brought against Beckett 2 ̆ 7 s in 1928, readers came to its defence and their testimony reveals overlaps between reading and political allegiances: reading Beckett 2 ̆ 7 s equated with voting Labor. While histories of sensationalist media in Australia have rightly emphasised illicit sexuality and public outcry, connections between sensationalism and working-class political movements remain on the margins of academic interest. Responding to the question 2 ̆ 7 Do you read Beckett 2 ̆ 7 s? 2 ̆ 7 readers 2 ̆ 7 evidence at the trial constitutes an audience response and invites debate over the ways gender and class could inform political engagement in the 1920 s.

In the earlier episode, there were significant tax rate cuts that were not matched by spending cuts, and between 1981 and 1986, the U. <b>S.</b> <b>budget</b> deficit went from 2. 5 % of GDP to about 5 % of GDP and the current account went from being roughly in balance to a deficit of 3. 3 % of GDP.

40|$|The President 9 ̆ 2 <b>s</b> <b>Budget</b> for 2004 is the {{administration}} 9 ̆ 2 s last prior to the forthcoming presidential elections in May 2004. Thus, it is but timely to assess not only the proposed 2004 budget itself but also the present administration 9 ̆ 2 s fiscal performance {{in the last three}} years. The evaluation of the President 9 ̆ 2 <b>s</b> <b>Budget</b> for 2001 - 2004 that is presented in this paper is composed of three parts: (i) an evaluation of the overall fiscal outlook as projected in the President 9 ̆ 2 <b>s</b> <b>Budget</b> in terms of its sustainability; (ii) an examination of its revenue program; and (iii) the congruence of the expenditure program with policy pronouncements and budgetary intent as articulated in the Medium-Term Development Plan (MTPDP). This paper also highlights why it is critical to always have a comprehensive picture of the public sector. It documents how the positive fiscal outlook for the national government in 2003 - 2004 masks the rapid deterioration in the fiscal position of the nonfinancial public sector mainly because of the huge losses registered by a number of GOCCs. While the nonfinancial public sector in the aggregate is projected to have a small primary surplus in 2004 after posting primary deficits in 2002 - 2003, its consolidated fiscal position is deemed to be unsustainable in 2003 - 2004. The solutions to this problem are not easy: increasing tariffs, privatization and regulatory reform...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{provides}} a thorough economic {{evaluation of the}} anti-drug policies implemented in Colombia between 2000 and 2006 under the so-called Plan Colombia.

We calibrate the model using available data for the war on cocaine production and trafficking as well as outcomes from the cocaine markets. Using the results from the calibration we estimate important measures of the costs, effectiveness, and efficiency of the war on drugs in Colombia. Finally we assess the impact of changes in the U. <b>S.</b> <b>budget</b> allocated to Plan Colombia, finding that a three-fold increase in the U. <b>S.</b> <b>budget</b> allocated to the war on drugs in Colombia would decrease the amount of cocaine reaching consumer countries by about 19. 5 %...|$|R
