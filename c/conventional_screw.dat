40|$|Background: A {{change in}} screw {{orientation}} in fixing the chevron proximal first metatarsal osteotomy was noted anecdotally to improve fixation strength. The authors hypothesized that plantar-to-dorsal screw orientation {{would be more}} stable than the <b>conventional</b> dorsal-to-plantar <b>screw</b> orientation for fixation of the chevron osteotomy.

Methods: One foot from each of eight matched cadaver pairs was randomly assigned to one of two groups: 1) fixation with a dorsal-to-plantar lag screw or 2) fixation with a plantar-to-dorsal lag screw. A prox-imal chevron osteotomy was then created using standard technique and the metatarsal was fixed according to previously established method. The bone was potted in polyester resin, and the construct was fitted into a mate-rials testing system machine in which load was applied to the plantar aspect of the metatarsal until failure.

The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the influence of tightening technique and the screw coating on the loosening torque of screws used for Universal Abutment fixation after cyclic loading. MATERIALS AND METHODS. Forty implants (Titamax Ti Cortical, HE, Neodent) (n= 10) were submerged in acrylic resin and four tightening techniques for Universal Abutment fixation were evaluated: A – torque with 32 Ncm (control); B – torque with 32 Ncm holding the torque meter for 20 seconds; C – torque with 32 Ncm and retorque after 10 minutes; D – torque (32 Ncm) holding the torque meter for 20 seconds and retorque after 10 minutes as initially. Samples were divided into subgroups according to the <b>screw</b> used: <b>conventional</b> titanium <b>screw</b> or diamond like carbon-coated (DLC) screw. Metallic crowns were fabricated for each abutment. Samples were submitted to cyclic loading at 106 cycles and 130 N of force. Data were analyzed by two-way ANOVA and Tukey’s test (5 %). RESULTS.

40|$|Background: Locking plates {{transmit}} load through fixed-angle locking screws instead {{of relying on}} plate-to-bone compression. Therefore, locking screws may induce higher stress at the screw-bone interface than that seen with con-ventional nonlocked plating. This study investigated whether locked plating in osteoporotic diaphyseal bone causes a greater periprosthetic fracture risk than conventional plating because of stress concentrations at the plate end. It further investigated the effect of replacing the locked end screwwith a <b>conventional</b> <b>screw</b> {{on the strength of}} the fixation construct. Methods: Three different bridge-plate constructs were applied to a validated surrogate of the osteoporotic femoral diaphysis. Constructs were tested dynamically to failure in bending, torsion, and axial loading to determine failure loads and failuremodes. A locked plating construct was compared with a nonlocked conventional plating construct. Subsequently, the outermost locking screw in locked plating constructs was replaced with a <b>conventional</b> <b>screw</b> to reduce stress concentrations at the plate end. Results: Compared with the conventional plating construct, the locked plating construct was 22 % weaker in bending (p = 0. 013), comparably strong in torsion (p = 0. 05), and 15 % stronger in axial compression (p = 0. 017). Substituting the locked end screw with a <b>conventional</b> <b>screw</b> increased the construct strength by 40 % in bending (p = 0. 001) but had no significant effect on construct strength under torsion (p = 0. 22) and compressive loading (p = 0. 53) compared with the locked plating construct. Under bending, all constructs failed by periprosthetic fracture...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: Mechanical {{evaluation}} of a novel screw position used for repair in a type III distal phalanx fracture model and assessment of solar canal penetration (SCP). STUDY DESIGN: Experimental study. SAMPLE POPULATION: Disarticulated equine hooves (n[*]=[*] 24) and 24 isolated distal phalanges.

In group 1 (<b>conventional</b> <b>screw</b> placement), the screw was inserted halfway between the proximal border of the solar canal (SC) and the subchondral bone surface on a line parallel to the dorsal cortex, whereas in group 2, the screw was inserted more palmar/plantar, where a perpendicular line drawn from the group 1 position reached the palmar/plantar cortex.

40|$|STUDY DESIGN:: Cadaveric and biomechanical study. OBJECTIVE:: Assess {{the safety}} and pullout {{strength}} of medial, partial non-threaded thoracic pedicle <b>screws</b> compared to <b>conventional</b> <b>screws.</b> SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA:: The perforation rate of pedicle screws has been reported as high as 41. Nerve injury and irritation can result from compression of malpositioned screw on neural structures. METHODS:: Ten fresh cadavers were studied. 5. 0 mm and 6. 0 mm screws were inserted from T 1 -T 6 and T 7 -T 12 respectively. Pedicle perforations and fractures were recorded upon screw insertion and final positioning (non-threaded portion facing medially) following a wide laminectomy. Pullout strength of novel and <b>conventional</b> <b>screws</b> were then tested using an Instron machine in an artificial bone substitute. RESULTS:: 240 thoracic pedicle screws were inserted. 88. 8 (213 screws) were fully contained during screw insertion. There were 5. 0 (12 screws) Grade 1 medial perforations and 6. 2 (15 screws) Grade 1 lateral perforations during screw insertion. Upon final positioning, 93. 8 (225 screws) were fully contained. All Grade 1 medial perforations, which occurred during insertion, were converted to Grade 0. No dural or nerve root injuries occurred. Pedicle split fractures were noted in 6. 7 (16 screws). The use of medial, partial non-threaded screws reduced the overall perforation rate from 11. 2 to 6. 2. The mean pullout load for the 5 mm fully threaded screw vs. medial, partial non-threaded was 1419. 3 NÂ± 106. 1 (1275. 8 - 1538. 8 N) and 1336. 6 NÂ± 44. 2 (1293. 0 - 1405. 1 N) respectively, whereas 6 mm pullout load averaged 2126. 0 NÂ± 134. 8 (1986. 3 - 2338. 3 N) and 2036. 5 NÂ± 210. 0 (1818. 4 - 2355. 9 N). The difference was not statistically significant. CONCLUSION:: The use of medial, partial non-threaded pedicle screws reduced the medial perforation rate from 5. 0 to 0; however, pullout strength was not significantly reduced. The use of this novel screw can potentially {{reduce the incidence of}} nerve injury or irritation following medial pedicle perforations...|$|R

40|$|It is {{possible}} to design cylindrical helical gearing profiles such that an externally lobed inner gear rotates inside an internally lobed outer gear while maintaining continuous lines of contact between the gears. The continuous contact between {{the inner and outer}} rotors (analogous to the main and gate rotors in a <b>conventional</b> <b>screw</b> machine) creates a series of separate working chambers. In this type of machine the rotors have parallel axes of rotation, and if both rotors are free to rotate about their own axes, these axes can be fixed in space. The use of ported end plates is proposed to control the period during which fluid is allowed to enter or leave the working chambers of the internally geared screw machine. As with <b>conventional</b> <b>screw</b> machines, these internally geared rotors can then be used to achieve compression or expansion of a trapped mass of fluid, and the machine geometry can be designed in order to optimise performance for particular applications.

Methods. the screws were inserted into the anterosuperior portion of the anterior spine, and assessment was performed after application of loads. the expander screw is composed of two parts: 1) a cover with an external portion comprising tight thin threads; and 2) a compact internal screw inserted through the cover that allows expansion. in the comparative study between the screws in Groups 1 and 2 maximum load was assessed, and the intergroup difference was significant (p = 0. 00001 [t-test]); regarding load at the elasticity threshold, a significant difference was also observed (p = 0. 0063). With regard to rigidity (stiffness), there was a tendency in both groups toward significance (p = 0. 069). With regard to absorbed energy in the elastic phase, statistical analysis showed a significant intergroup difference (p = 0. 00439). the expander screw showed a greater load-bearing capacity than the <b>conventional</b> <b>screw.</b> Adhesion to bone {{in relation to the}} applied load and displacement was greater (significant tendency) in the expander screw group than in the <b>conventional</b> <b>screw</b> group.

The threaded shaft of the screw has 10 degrees mobility in all directions, but its structure is to prevent abnormal translation and tilting.
