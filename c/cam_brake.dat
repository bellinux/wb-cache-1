2500|$|... "U-brakes" [...] (also {{known by}} the trademarked term [...] "990-style") are {{essentially}} the same design as the centre-pull caliper brake. [...] The {{difference is that the}} two arm pivots attach directly to the frame or fork while those of the centre-pull caliper brake attach to an integral bridge frame that mounts to the frame or fork by a single bolt. [...] Like roller <b>cam</b> <b>brakes,</b> this is a caliper design with pivots located above the rim. [...] Thus U-brakes are often interchangeable with, and have the same maintenance issues as, roller <b>cam</b> <b>brakes.</b>|$|R

5000|$|... "Roller cam brakes" [...] are centre-pull {{cantilever}} brakes actuated by {{the cable}} pulling a single two-sided sliding cam. (First and second-class lever designs exist; first-class is {{most common and}} is described here.) Each arm has a cam follower. As the cam presses against the follower it forces the arms apart. As {{the top of each}} arm moves outward, the brake shoe below the pivot is forced inward against the rim.There is much in favor of the roller <b>cam</b> <b>brake</b> design.

40|$|The SAE Recommended Practice 51802, Brake Block Effectiveness Rating [I], has {{the purpose}} of {{establishing}} a uniform procedure for determination and classification of brake effectiveness for commercial vehicle brakes. The practice provides a means to characterize the friction properties of truck brake lining materials in a representative S-cam brake. However, the test {{has been found to}} exhibit an unacceptably large range of variability in the implied friction coefficient for the lining. It has been postulated that some of the: variability arises from factors within the brakes that are used for the test-specifically, dimensional tolerances, and possibly friction in the moving parts. A computer model of an S-. <b>cam</b> <b>brake</b> was developed under this work to help examine various brake parameter sensitivi~ties. The model calculates brake torque for a specified set of geometry, friction properties, arid constant input air chamber force. It assumes that the brake {{is in a state of}} equilibrium defined by equalized wear rates on the leading and trailing shoe linings. The parameter!sensitivity findings indicate that a potentially significant source of torque variability is related to possible offsets between the drum turning axis and the spiderlshoe assembly centerline.

40|$|The {{automotive}} {{brake system}} plays {{a significant role}} not only in the deceleration and stopping process, but also in many stability control strategies. To overcome the limitations of conventional brake systems and to improve vehicle control strategies such as traction control, and differential braking, a new generation of brake systems called the brake-by-wire system has been introduced to the vehicle industry. This generation of brake systems combines electrical, mechanical and, in some cases, hydraulic components. Although different types of brake-by-wire mechanisms have been developed in the past two decades, there still exist demands for further improvement and developing new brake mechanisms in the automotive industry due to the ever increasing demand for better safety and performance. This research proposes a novel brake-by-wire system based on cam actuation. This system is a combination of electrical, mechanical and hydraulic components. The unique feature of the <b>cam</b> actuation <b>brake</b> system proposed in this research is that the characteristics of the motor torque amplification can be optimized by careful design of the cam shape. The compactness and self-contained characteristic of the design allow the brake system to be installed on each wheel enabling fully independent control of each wheel for better stability control. Moreover, the <b>cam</b> actuated <b>brake</b> has a fail-safe advantage by keeping the direct connection between the driver and the brake calipers in case of any system failure. In this work, different subsystems of the brake system and their components are explained, the dynamic model of the system is found and the design parameters are optimized. Specifically, the optimal design problem has been formulated by taking the geometry of the cam as the optimization variable and the open-loop response time of the brake system as the objective function to be minimized. The solution to this problem is then obtained by the multi-layer design optimization process using the genetic algorithm (GA). Various control algorithms are applied to the developed <b>cam</b> actuated <b>brake</b> system to investigate their performance in terms of tracking a desired braking pressure...|$|R

2500|$|The Isle of Man Examiner {{newspaper}} described Stanley Woods as an [...] "enthusiastic amateur" [...] {{and started}} the 1922 Junior TT with the number 40 entered by Cotton. After being delayed at the start to stop to recover dropped spark-plugs which had fallen-out of his pocket, Stanley Woods still managed to make good-time and lapped in 40minutes and 50 seconds despite clipping the kerb at Governor's Bridge on lap 1. At Sulby on lap 2, Stanley Woods slipped off the motor-cycle and continued but hit the same kerb again at Governor's Bridge which removed part of the exhaust. A fire in the pits at the TT Grandstand followed which was extinguished by pit-attendants and Stanley Woods using an overcoat. Further problems occurred at Braddan Bridge when Stanley Woods had to stop to re-place an exhaust valve after the inlet push-rod had broken. At Greeba Castle when he discovered the brakes had failed after the rear <b>brake</b> <b>cam</b> lever had split {{a result of the}} pit-fire.

40|$|DESIGN PROBLEM Existing {{elevator}} safety {{mechanisms are}} susceptible to variable friction conditions, which cause an inconsistent deceleration during emergency stops. The braking mechanism provides a constant normal force, which means the braking force and subsequent deceleration are proportional to the varying coefficient of friction (μ) between the brakes and the rail. Our goal is to design and manufacture a proof-of-concept prototype for a mechanically self-adjusting safety that produces a constant deceleration (0. 6 ± 0. 05 g) in spite of variable friction conditions (0. 15 < μ < 0. 25) during emergency stops. FINAL DESIGN The selected final design uses a rotating cam {{that acts as a}} friction sensor and as a brake. A vertical spring is attached to the cam and it provides a moment to help maintain constant contact with the rail and to oppose the upward and horizontal forces from the rail. The cam is contained in a wedge-shaped frame similar to the wedge on the existing design and a U-spring produces a compressive normal force on the frame. As a result, when μ increases the cam rotates upward and its radius (pivot-to-rail) decreases, which decreases the normal force. The inverse relationship between μ and the normal force results in a constant braking force and constant deceleration. Rather than contacting the rail directly, the <b>cam</b> contacts a <b>brake</b> shoe via a set of teeth (à la a rack-and-pinion mechanism). The brake shoe allows for a larger braking surface to help dissipate heat and contact forces...|$|R
