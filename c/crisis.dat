5|$|Another {{important}} {{concept in}} Hippocratic medicine {{was that of}} a <b>crisis,</b> a point in the progression of disease at which either the illness would begin to triumph and the patient would succumb to death, or the opposite would occur and natural processes would make the patient recover. After a <b>crisis,</b> a relapse might follow, and then another deciding <b>crisis.</b> According to this doctrine, crises tend to occur on critical days, which were supposed to be a fixed time after the contraction of a disease. If a <b>crisis</b> occurred on a day far from a critical day, a relapse might be expected. Galen believed that this idea originated with Hippocrates, though it is possible that it predated him.|$|E

We find that each type of <b>crises</b> has a unique set of macroeconomic causes. We also identify internal contagion and selection bias effects, which may lead to biased empirical estimates if twin <b>crises</b> are not treated as a specific type of <b>crises.</b> Such a separation allows to significantly improve the efficiency of early warning systems especially for debt and twin <b>crises.</b> currency <b>crises,</b> debt <b>crises,</b> twin <b>crises,</b> emerging markets...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} the empirics of twin <b>crises.</b> We treat banking and currency <b>crises</b> equally {{in terms of}} methodology. We construct an index of money market pressure and an index of speculative pressure to identify banking and currency <b>crises,</b> respectively. We include 49 countries spanning 1980 - 2004 in our sample, and have identified 85 currency <b>crises,</b> 63 banking <b>crises,</b> and 27 twin <b>crises.</b> Our {{results indicate that the}} findings of existing research should be regarded as temporary and require further examination. First, it is common accepted that banking <b>crises</b> and twin <b>crises</b> have increased over time. However, we find that banking <b>crises</b> and twin <b>crises</b> were more frequent in the early 1980 s. Twin <b>crises</b> are not new phenomena because they already appeared in the early 1980 s. Twin <b>crises</b> are perceived to be new phenomena possibly because their number and frequency declined in mid- 1980 s and had returned toward the previous level in the early 1990 s. Second, existing research had found banking <b>crises</b> to be good leading indicators of currency <b>crises.</b> We find that banking <b>crises</b> are equally likely to lead or to follow currency <b>crises,</b> and vice versa. Third, existing research had found an asymmetric result between banking and currency <b>crises.</b> It means that past banking <b>crises</b> helped to predict currency <b>crises,</b> but the vice versa was not true. In contrast, we find the opposite causality as reported in most empirical studies. In addition, we find a symmetric result not reported in the literature, in the sense that past banking <b>crises</b> helped to predict currency <b>crises,</b> and the converse is also true...|$|R

5|$|The global {{financial}} <b>crisis</b> precipitated in 2007 and 2008 shared {{some of the}} key features exhibited by the wave of international financial crises in the 1990s, including accelerated capital influxes, weak regulatory frameworks, relaxed monetary policies, herd behavior during investment bubbles, collapsing asset prices, and massive deleveraging. The systemic problems originated in the United States and other advanced nations. Similarly to the 1997 Asian <b>crisis,</b> the global <b>crisis</b> entailed broad lending by banks undertaking unproductive real estate investments as well as poor standards of corporate governance within financial intermediaries. Particularly in the United States, the <b>crisis</b> was characterized by growing securitization of non-performing assets, large fiscal deficits, and excessive financing in the housing sector. While the real estate bubble in the U.S. triggered the financial <b>crisis,</b> the bubble was financed by foreign capital flowing from many different countries. As its contagious effects began infecting other nations, the <b>crisis</b> became a precursor for the global economic downturn now referred to as the Great Recession. In the wake of the <b>crisis,</b> total volume of world trade in goods and services fell 10% from 2008 to 2009 and did not recover until 2011, with an increased concentration in emerging market countries. The {{global financial}} <b>crisis</b> demonstrated the negative effects of worldwide financial integration, sparking discourse on how and whether some countries should decouple themselves from the system altogether.|$|E
