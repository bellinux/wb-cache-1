50|$|Lithospermum arvense, {{the field}} gromwell, <b>corn</b> <b>gromwell,</b> or bastard alkanet, is a {{flowering}} plant {{of the family}} Boraginaceae. It {{is also known as}} Buglossoides arvensis.|$|E
50|$|Stearidonic acid (SDA) is an ω-3 fatty acid, {{sometimes}} called moroctic acid. It is biosynthesized from alpha-linolenic acid by the enzyme delta-6-desaturase. Natural sources of this fatty acid are the seed oils of hemp, blackcurrant, <b>corn</b> <b>gromwell</b> and echium (although {{the plant is}} a source of stearidonic acid, it is toxic for human consumption), and the cyanobacterium Spirulina.|$|E
30|$|Seeds of <b>corn</b> <b>gromwell</b> (B. arvensis (L.) I. M. Johnston; plant {{accession}} No. TC/ 07 / 1 R) {{were obtained}} from Technology Crops International (Winston-Salem, NC) and germinated by exposing them to a cold stratification regimen (12 -h light: 12 -h dark photoperiod, 15 [*]±[*] 1 °C, 80 % humidity). Plantlets, which emerged 4 – 6 weeks post-initiation, were transferred into four inch diameter pots, filled with soil and grown for an additional 8 – 10 weeks with regular fertilization, under optimal growth conditions (12 -h light : 12 -h dark photoperiod, 20 [*]±[*] 1 °C, 80 % humidity) in a growth chamber (Conviron, Winnipeg, Canada). The soil for the experiment was sourced from experimental plots located at the Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada S. H. J. Michaud Research Farm (Bouctouche, NB, Canada) and stored at 4 °C till use. This soil was characterized as a gleyed podzolic gray luvisol, a subgroup of the Canadian system of soil classification (Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada 1998), with a pH of 5.2, 62 % sand, 25 % silt, 13 % clay, and 2.6 % organic matter.|$|E
30|$|In many {{model organisms}} like Arabidopsis thaliana (Schmidt et al. 2005), Medicago truncatula (Benedito et al. 2008), rice (Oryza sativa) (Jiao et al. 2009; Wang et al. 2010), soybean (Glycine max) (Libault et al. 2010) or maize (Zea mays) (Sekhon et al. 2011), {{exhaustive}} gene expression maps {{have been developed}} (Kumar et al. 2011; Jin et al. 2013), which are publicly accessible. This has {{made it easy for}} anyone to access the candidate RG sequences not only for these plants but also for genomes to which these model plant share sequence homology. However, for non-model systems, an empirical analysis of potential candidates has to be undertaken prior to commencing any expression analysis. One example of such a non-model system is Buglossoides arvensis (L.) I. M. Johnston, a member of the plant family Boraginaceae. Commonly referred to as <b>corn</b> <b>gromwell,</b> or more recently as Ahiflower™ ([URL] this weed plant has evoked high interest amongst researchers for its nutraceutical value, more specifically for its propensity to naturally accumulate in its seeds a non-traditional plant lipid, stearidonic acid (SDA, C 18 : 4 n- 3). This omega- 3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) is a key precursor in the biosynthesis of long chain n- 3 PUFAs such as eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA, C 20 : 5 n- 3) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, 22 : 6 n- 3). Consumption of these two n- 3 PUFAs by humans is known to have significant health benefits, which include improvement in brain, eye, and cardiovascular health (Lenihan-Geels et al. 2013). As the main sources of EPA (C 20 : 5 n- 3) and DHA (22 : 6 n- 3) are marine-based and are declining (Pauly et al. 2005), new sources of n- 3 PUFAs are now being increasingly sought in order to satisfy the ever increasing demand for omega- 3. Consumption of SDA, a natural precursor of EPA and DHA, has shown to impart the same health benefits as consuming EPA and DHA (Surette et al. 2004). The discovery of B. arvensis, a natural accumulator of SDA, has opened up exciting possibilities of developing an alternative yet sustainable source of n- 3 PUFA’s for human consumption (Surette 2013). Commercial production of this crop plant has recently started under the trade name Ahiflower™ by Technology Crops International (Winston-Salem, NC).|$|E
