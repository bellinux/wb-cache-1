40|$|Objectives: This study {{evaluated}} {{the efficacy of}} a computer-based version of cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) for substance dependence. Method: This was a randomized clinical trial in which 77 individuals seeking treatment for substance dependence at an outpatient community setting {{were randomly assigned to}} standard treatment or standard treatment with biweekly access to <b>computer-based</b> <b>training</b> in <b>CBT</b> (CBT 4 CBT) skills. Results: Treatment retention and data availability were comparable across the treatment conditions. Participants assigned to the CBT 4 CBT condition submitted significantly more urine specimens that were negative for any type of drugs and tended to have longer continuous periods of abstinence during treatment. The CBT 4 CBT program was positively evaluated by participants. In the CBT 4 CBT condition, outcome was more strongly associated with treatment engagement than in treatment as usual; furthermore, completion of homework assignments in CBT 4 CBT was significantly correlated with outcome and a significant predictor of treatment involvement. Conclusions: These data suggest that CBT 4 CBT is an effective adjunct to standard outpatient treatment for substance dependence and may provide an important means of making CBT, a...|$|R

40|$|This study {{attempts}} to reconcile viewpoints {{on the role}} of errors in the design of <b>computer-based</b> <b>training</b> (<b>CBT)</b> systems. From one perspective, errors are detrimental to learning; from another, they can be beneficial. The results of an experiment are presented and discussed. When a CBT system is designed to allow learners to correct their own errors, they learn significantly more than when errors are prevented. When learners are allowed only to correct errors that others have made, they do not learn significantly more than when errors are prevented. Implications for the design of CBT systems and possibilities for future research are considered.
