5|$|Sometimes trace fossils {{have been}} {{referred}} to Megalosaurus or to the ichnogenus Megalosauripus. In 1997, a famous group of fossilised footprints (ichnites) {{was found in a}} limestone quarry at Ardley, twenty kilometres northeast of Oxford. They were thought to have been made by Megalosaurus and possibly also some left by Cetiosaurus. There are replicas of some of these footprints, set across the lawn of the Oxford University Museum of Natural History. One track was of a theropod accelerating from walking to running. According to Benson, such referrals are unprovable, as the tracks show no traits unique to Megalosaurus. <b>Certainly</b> <b>they</b> should be limited to finds that are of the same age as Megalosaurus bucklandii.|$|E
25|$|Some of {{the pottery}} evidences grain impressions, which some {{interpret}} {{as the use}} of food imported from the south. <b>Certainly,</b> <b>they</b> did not need to import food and were probably better nourished than the southerners. Analysis of charred remains in one pot indicates that it at least was used for fermenting a mixture of blood and nuts. Some have therefore guessed that fermentation of grain was used to produce beer.|$|E
25|$|An urban myth is that Blackheath was {{associated}} with the 1665 Plague or the Black Death of the mid-14th century. The idea that Blackheath got its name from its use as a burial pit goes {{all the way back to}} the medieval period, when it was almost certainly used for the disposal of the dead during the ‘Black Death‘. Virtually every part of London has a local tradition about plague pits under, say, a local school or shop. <b>Certainly</b> <b>they</b> were very common. The sheer number of bodies meant that the traditional churchyards became, as one contemporary put it, ‘overstuft’ very quickly.|$|E
60|$|The warden agreed. He <b>certainly</b> thought <b>they</b> had {{understood}} {{to the full}} what had been said to them.|$|R
6000|$|<b>They</b> <b>certainly</b> were not. <b>They</b> {{were of a}} pearly grey colour, small, round, {{and almost}} {{transparent}} against the light. [...] "From their lightness and transparency, I should imagine that they are soluble in water," [...] I remarked.|$|R

25|$|Environmentalists such as American John Muir {{were the}} chief agents of {{bringing}} environmental concerns {{to the attention}} of the public, whereupon they became political concerns; such leaders were not given a voice in the USSR, they did not step forward, or they did not exist. Most <b>certainly</b> <b>they</b> did not exist in 1867, when Muir first began distributing his writing in the US. His efforts to promote environmentalism began 50 years before the start of the Bolshevik Revolution in late 1917 and the ensuing Russian Civil War (1918–21), known collectively as the Russian Revolution. The Soviet Union had not begun to exist until then.|$|E
500|$|On October 1, 1937, Hugo Black made a {{statement}} over the radio. Black said in part, [...] "I number among my friends {{many members of the}} colored race. <b>Certainly,</b> <b>they</b> are entitled to the full measure of protection accorded by our Constitution and our laws..." [...] Black also said, [...] "I did join the Klan. I later resigned. I never rejoined.... Before becoming a Senator I dropped the Klan. I have {{had nothing to do with}} it since that time. I abandoned it. I completely discontinued any association with the organization. I have never resumed it and never expect to do so." [...] The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette reported that “fifty million listeners heard the unprecedented speech.” ...|$|E
500|$|Blur {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} music {{critics in the}} United States, but reviews were mixed in the UK press. The Guardian praised it, whereas The Times was more ambivalent and The Independent was negative. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic said the album highlights [...] "the band's rich eclecticism and sense of songcraft. <b>Certainly,</b> <b>they</b> are trying for new sonic territory, bringing in shards of white noise, gurgling electronics, raw guitars, and druggy psychedelia, but these are just extensions of previously hidden elements of Blur's music." [...] Margaret Moser of The Austin Chronicle praised the album for [...] "unveiling a punchy brand of muscular Brit-pop that dances around raucous, Kinks-like garage-pop ("Movin' On," [...] "M.O.R."), tender, Beatles-like harmonies ("Beetlebum," [...] "Look Inside America"), punky quirk ("Chinese Bombs"), soulful balladry ("Country Sad Ballad Man"), obligatory space-rock trip-hop ("Theme from Retro," [...] "I'm Just a Killer for Your Love"), and a raise-yer-mug singalong ("On Your Own")." [...] Jonathan Bernstein of Spin also felt that, [...] "despite their traitorous pronouncements, Blur's highlights are consistently British-bred." [...] James Hunter, writing for Rolling Stone, claimed that [...] "what still makes [...] great is their deep grasp of style and genre. What they haven't done on Blur is roll out of bed, strum a few chords and loudly free-associate about {{the first thing that}} pops into their heads. This is a record that inhabits current American rock biases as cogently and intelligently as Parklife corralled the last few decades of British rock." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Wichita {{had a large}} {{population}} {{in the time of}} Coronado and Oñate. [...] One scholar estimates their numbers at 200,000. [...] <b>Certainly</b> <b>they</b> numbered in the tens of thousands. [...] They appeared to be much reduced {{by the time of the}} first French contacts with them in 1719, probably due in large part to epidemics of infectious disease to which they had no immunity. In 1790, it was estimated there were about 3,200 total Wichita. [...] By 1868, the population was recorded as being 572 total Wichita. By the time of the census of 1937, there were only 100 Wichita officially left.|$|E
2500|$|The {{use of an}} {{intermediary}} auxiliary language (also called a [...] "working language", [...] "bridge language", [...] "vehicular language" [...] or [...] "unifying language") to make communication possible between people not sharing a first language, in particular when it is a third language, distinct from both mother tongues, may be almost as old as language itself. <b>Certainly</b> <b>they</b> have existed since antiquity. Latin and Greek (or Koiné Greek) were the intermediary language of {{all areas of the}} Mediterraneum; Akkadian, and then Aramaic, remained the common languages of a large part of Western Asia through several earlier empires. Such natural languages used for communication between people not sharing the same mother tongue are called lingua francas.|$|E
2500|$|Richard Freeman wrote: [...] "Hooker was Charles Darwin's {{greatest}} {{friend and}} confidant". <b>Certainly</b> <b>they</b> had extensive correspondence, {{and they also}} met face-to-face (Hooker visiting Darwin). Hooker and Lyell were the two people Darwin consulted (by letter) when Wallace's famous letter arrived at Down House, enclosing his paper on natural selection. Hooker was instrumental in creating the device whereby the Wallace paper was accompanied by Darwin's notes and his letter to Asa Gray (showing his prior realisation of natural selection) in a presentation to the Linnean Society. Hooker {{was the one who}} formally presented this material to the Linnean Society meeting in 1858. In 1859 the author of The Origin of Species recorded his indebtedness to Hooker's wide knowledge and balanced judgment.|$|E
25|$|Apparently Real Unión Irún were {{announced}} as Spanish champions 1929, {{which is most}} <b>certainly</b> wrong (<b>they</b> were 9th in the league 1928/29 and eliminated in the 1/16 finals of the domestic cup).|$|R
5000|$|Thomas {{said in an}} {{interview}} with The List: [...] "People innately have lots of solutions. It sounds like an obvious thing, but everyone thinks that they can be Prime Minister; everyone thinks that they can do a better job. <b>They</b> <b>certainly</b> think <b>they</b> can do a better job than their MP. Everyone has opinions, and that was how the manifesto show was born. Instead of politicians telling us what we should do, it should be the other way round." ...|$|R
60|$|But brutes as <b>they</b> <b>certainly</b> were, <b>they</b> yet {{had enough}} of human nature in them to be shocked at their own hideousness; and still {{intending}} to groan, they uttered a viler grunt and squeal than before. So harsh and ear-piercing it was, {{that you would have}} fancied a butcher was sticking his knife into each of their throats, or, at the very least, that somebody was pulling every hog by his funny little twist of a tail.|$|R
2500|$|Pritzker {{reminded}} the Court {{of the circumstances}} under which the ordinance had been originally enforced. [...] "They walked into the Flipside store and said, this ordinance is coming into effect, and you are covered, so <b>certainly</b> <b>they</b> don't mean intent, because they just determined intent." [...] At trial, he noted, some of the items the village claimed had been purchased at the Flipside turned out to have been, in fact, acquired at other shops. A village police officer testified that a bong he had once seized turned out to have tobacco residue in it. [...] "I think the only issue is, if a brass water pipe is lawful, like Pier 1 sells and like many tourists who come back from the east , why is a blue one unlawful" ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{contacts}} {{prior to}} 1940 had expressed an intent by the IRA {{to assist in}} the German campaign against Britain. [...] From the IRA's point of view, this was a means to an end- they had no love for the policies of Éamon de Valera, Winston Churchill, Adolf Hitler, or Joseph Stalin. [...] The 1938 takeover by Russell and a reaffirmation of the [...] "Second Dáil mentality" [...] with his succession placed the organisation on a path where it viewed its only recourse as [...] "violent struggle against the forces of foreign occupation". [...] <b>Certainly</b> <b>they</b> wished for the defeat of Britain which they viewed as the perennial oppressor and persecutor of their nation. [...] The Abwehr, as it did in other nations, made much of encouraging this state of mind within the IRA. [...] This included attempts, via German agents, to keep the tenuous links formed mostly by O'Donovan alive.|$|E
2500|$|The American Revolution proved highly {{disruptive}} {{to the old}} {{networks of}} conservative elites in the colonies. The departure of so many royal officials, rich merchants, and landed gentry destroyed the hierarchical networks that previously dominated politics and power {{in many of the}} colonies. In New York, for example, the departure of key members of the DeLancy, DePester Walton, and Cruger families undercut the interlocking families that largely owned and controlled the Hudson Valley. Likewise in Pennsylvania, the departure of the powerful Penn, Allen, Chew, and Shippen families destroyed the cohesion of the old upper class. New men became rich merchants, but they retained a spirit of republican equality that replaced the old elitism; the revolution prevented the rise of a truly powerful upper class in American society. One rich patriot in Boston noted in 1779 that [...] "fellows who would have cleaned my shoes five years ago, have amassed fortunes and are riding in chariots." [...] Four out of five Loyalists remained in America and were loyal to the new republic. For the most part, they avoided politics; <b>certainly</b> <b>they</b> never tried to form a revanchist movement seeking a return to the Empire. Loyalist Samuel Seabury, for example, abandoned politics but became the first Episcopalian bishop in the United States, rebuilding a church that appealed to families that still admired hierarchy, tradition, and historic liturgy, but had given up their allegiance to the king.|$|E

And their clothes were {{certainly}} beautifully made--even my poor old unworldly eye could tell that. And she thought two milliners would be so useful with a large family like hers. <b>They</b> <b>certainly</b> said <b>they</b> were milliners. But it seems--I don't know what we shall do about them.... My dear Mr. Britling, those young women are anything but milliners--anything but milliners...." ...|$|R
