5|$|Each {{heavy chain}} has two regions, the <b>constant</b> <b>region</b> and the {{variable}} region. The <b>constant</b> <b>region</b> is identical in all antibodies {{of the same}} isotype, but differs in antibodies of different isotypes. Heavy chains γ, α and δ have a <b>constant</b> <b>region</b> composed of three tandem (in a line) Ig domains, and a hinge region for added flexibility; heavy chains μ and ε have a <b>constant</b> <b>region</b> composed of four immunoglobulin domains. The variable region of the heavy chain differs in antibodies produced by different B cells, but {{is the same for}} all antibodies produced by a single B cell or B cell clone. The variable region of each heavy chain is approximately 110 amino acids long and is composed of a single Ig domain.|$|E
5|$|Class {{switching}} {{occurs in}} the heavy chain gene locus by a mechanism called class switch recombination (CSR). This mechanism relies on conserved nucleotide motifs, called switch (S) regions, found in DNA upstream of each <b>constant</b> <b>region</b> gene (except in the δ-chain). The DNA strand is broken by the activity {{of a series of}} enzymes at two selected S-regions. The variable domain exon is rejoined through a process called non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) to the desired <b>constant</b> <b>region</b> (γ, α or ε). This process results in an immunoglobulin gene that encodes an antibody of a different isotype.|$|E
5|$|These {{non-human}} antibodies {{are recognized}} as foreign by the human immune system and may be rapidly cleared from the body, provoke an allergic reaction, or both. To avoid this, parts of the antibody can be replaced with human amino acid sequences, or pure human antibodies can be engineered. If the <b>constant</b> <b>region</b> is replaced with the human form, the antibody is termed chimeric and the substem used was -xi-. Part of the variable regions may also be substituted, in which case it is called humanized and -zu- was used; typically, everything is replaced except the complementarity determining regions (CDRs), the three loops of amino acid sequences at the outside of each variable region that bind to the target structure, although some other residues may have to remain non-human {{in order to achieve}} good binding. Partly chimeric and partly humanized antibodies used -xizu-. These three substems did not indicate the foreign species used for production. Thus, the human/mouse chimeric antibody basiliximab ends in -ximab just as does the human/macaque antibody gomiliximab. Purely human antibodies used -u-.|$|E
40|$|Antibodies and T-cell receptors are {{important}} proteins {{of the immune}} system that share similar structures. Both contain variable and <b>constant</b> <b>regions.</b> Insight into the dynamics of their binding can be provided by computational simulations. For these simulations the <b>constant</b> <b>regions</b> are often removed to save runtime as binding occurs in the variable regions. Here we present the first study to investigate the effect of removing the <b>constant</b> <b>regions</b> from antibodies and T-cell receptors on such simulations. We performed simulations of an antibody/antigen and T-cell receptor/MHC system with and without <b>constant</b> <b>regions</b> using 10 replicas of 100 ns of each of the four setups. We found that simulations without <b>constant</b> <b>regions</b> show significantly different behavior compared to simulations with <b>constant</b> <b>regions.</b> If the <b>constant</b> <b>regions</b> are not included in the simulations alterations in the binding interface hydrogen bonds and even partial unbinding can occur. These results indicate that <b>constant</b> <b>regions</b> should be included in antibody and T-cell receptor simulations for reliable conclusions to be drawn...|$|R

5|$|Heterodimeric antibodies, {{which are}} also {{asymmetrical}} and antibodies, allow for greater flexibility and new formats for attaching a variety of drugs to the antibody arms. One of the general formats for a heterodimeric antibody is the “knobs-into-holes” format. This format is specific to the heavy chain part of the <b>constant</b> <b>region</b> in antibodies. The “knobs” part is engineered by replacing a small amino acid with a larger one. It fits into the “hole”, which is engineered by replacing a large amino acid with a smaller one. What connects the “knobs” to the “holes” are the disulfide bonds between each chain. The “knobs-into-holes” shape facilitates antibody dependent cell mediated cytotoxicity. Single chain variable fragments (scFv) {{are connected to the}} variable domain of the heavy and light chain via a short linker peptide. The linker is rich in glycine, which gives it more flexibility, and serine/threonine, which gives it specificity. Two different scFv fragments can be connected together, via a hinge region, to the constant domain of the heavy chain or the constant domain of the light chain. This gives the antibody bispecificity, allowing for the binding specificities of two different antigens. The “knobs-into-holes” format enhances heterodimer formation but doesn’t suppress homodimer formation.|$|E
5|$|Isotype {{or class}} {{switching}} is a biological process occurring after {{activation of the}} B cell, which allows the cell to produce different classes of antibody (IgA, IgE, or IgG). The different classes of antibody, and thus effector functions, are defined by the constant (C) regions of the immunoglobulin heavy chain. Initially, naive B cells express only cell-surface IgM and IgD with identical antigen binding regions. Each isotype is adapted for a distinct function; therefore, after activation, an antibody with an IgG, IgA, or IgE effector function might be required to effectively eliminate an antigen. Class switching allows different daughter cells from the same activated B cell to produce antibodies of different isotypes. Only the <b>constant</b> <b>region</b> of the antibody heavy chain changes during class switching; the variable regions, and therefore antigen specificity, remain unchanged. Thus the progeny of a single B cell can produce antibodies, all specific for the same antigen, but {{with the ability to}} produce the effector function appropriate for each antigenic challenge. Class switching is triggered by cytokines; the isotype generated depends on which cytokines are present in the B cell environment.|$|E

2500|$|Antibodies {{are also}} {{referred}} to as murine, chimeric, humanized and human. Murine antibodies are from a different species [...] and carry a risk of immune reaction. Chimeric antibodies attempt to reduce murine antibodies' immunogenicity by replacing part of the antibody with the corresponding human counterpart, known as the <b>constant</b> <b>region.</b> Humanized antibodies are almost completely human; only the complementarity determining regions of the variable regions are derived from murine sources.

40|$|Abstract We have {{analyzed}} purine (R) and pyrimidine (Y) codon {{patterns in}} variable and <b>constant</b> <b>regions</b> of HIV- 1 gp 120 in seven patients infected with different HIV- 1 subtypes and naive to antiretroviral therapy. We have calculated the relative frequency of each in-frame codon RNY, YNR, RNR, and YNY (N=any nucleotide) in variable and <b>constant</b> <b>regions</b> of gp 120, {{in the sequence}} within indels and at indels' flanking sites. Our data show that hypervariable regions V 1, V 2, V 4, and V 5 are characterized {{by the presence of}} long stretches of RNY codons constituting the majority of the sequence portion within insertions/deletions. In full-length gp 120 and within inserted/deleted fragments the number of AVT (V=A, C, G) codons did not exceed 50 % of the total RNY codons. RNY strings in variable regions spanned up to 21 codons and were always in frame. In contrast, RNY strings in <b>constant</b> <b>regions</b> were mostly out of frame and their length was limited to five codons. The frequency of the codon RNY was found to be significantly higher in variable regions (p< 0. 0001; t-test), within indels, and at indels' flanking sites (p< 0. 0001; χ(2) test). Analysis of the distribution of RNY strings equal to or longer than five codons in the full genome of HXB 2 also shows that these sequences are mostly out of frame, unless they contain a potential N-glycosylation site or an asparagine. These data suggest that cryptic repeats of RNY {{may play a role in}} the genesis of multiple base insertions and deletions in hypervariable regions of gp 120...|$|R
40|$|Layers {{are one of}} {{the most}} well studied ways of {{representing}} a 3 D scene. Although manmade scenes often contain <b>constant</b> intensity planar <b>regions</b> (textureless layers), it is almost always assumed that there is enough texture in each layer to compute the motion of the layer using image alignment and to base layer assignment on pixel-wise differencing. Since (the interior of) any textureless region is consistent with the motion of any layer, most existing algorithms assign <b>constant</b> intensity <b>regions</b> to the dominant layer, or to a random nearby layer. The one source of information that could be used to resolve the inherent ambiguity, namely the lines separating the <b>constant</b> intensity <b>regions,</b> is instead often treated as an outlier. In this paper we study the question of what can and cannot be computed in a 3 D world consisting of a set of <b>constant</b> intensity planar <b>regions</b> (textureless layers). We derive an algorithm to determine when the shape of the scene is unique, when it is inherently ambiguous, and if so, what the set of possible scene shapes is.

40|$|Immunoglobulin kappa chains {{from various}} inbred strains of rats have two serologically {{detectable}} forms that segregate in a Mendelian fashion (allotypes a and b of the RI- 1 locus). Partial amino-acid sequences from the <b>constant</b> <b>regions</b> {{of these two}} forms have been compared. Of the 81 residues of the <b>constant</b> <b>regions</b> studied, 10 amino-acid substitutions {{as well as one}} size difference (sequence gap) were found. This large number of sequence differences among alternative forms of the kappa allotype raises provocative questions as to the genetic and evolutionary implications of these light chain allotypes. We designate allotypes whose alternative forms differ at multiple residue positions as complex allotypes. There are basically two genetic models that might explain complex allotypes. First, these allotypes are alleles of a single structural gene with an unusual evolutionary history. Second, all rats have genes that code for each of the light chain allotypes and a control mechanism that permits them to be expressed so that they mimic a Mendelian pattern of segregation. We discuss evidence from other immunoglobulin systems that is compatible with this second model...|$|R
