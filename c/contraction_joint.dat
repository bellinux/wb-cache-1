5000|$|Its {{unit weight}} {{is lower than}} those of {{comparable}} building materials. Its shrinkage and expansion rates are low, and are comparable to those of concrete. As such, it can be poured continuously without necessitating a <b>contraction</b> <b>joint.</b> It is characterized by resistance to water and moisture. The ratio of lime in the mixture can be modified in order to completely eliminate water-related erosion. Experiments on capillary water absorption have shown that increased amounts of lime in the mixture results in an increase in quantity and in reduced width of capillary canals, proving the material’s erosion resistance. Compressive and shear strength and modules of elasticity and rigidity present advantages in terms of earthquake resistance. Once the mixture is poured into a mould, the production process is completed, and a significant degree of rigidity is reached. It does not require curing and drying, providing economy of time, labor, and energy. Resistance to pressure is 3,5 - 4 MPa. The lime in the mixture reduces resistance to pressure to a minimal degree, while increasing elasticity and resistance to impact. During pressure tests cube-shaped blocks fracture in pyramidal forms, comparable to concrete blocks, and do not disintegrate in the way unstabilized earthen blocks do.|$|E

The flexible-arch configurations are mainly comprised of artificial short joints at the middle downstream surface and a middle <b>contraction</b> <b>joint</b> with hinged well and enlarged arch ends with bending joints. Fundamental design considerations of these components are provided, and their contributions to the performance of Shimenzi arch dam are discussed in detail using the monitoring data from joint meters, strain gauges, and thermometers.

The need for a review of expansion and <b>contraction</b> <b>joint</b> spacing and location design practices is apparent based on the confusion which surrounds this topic for most practicing engineers.

40|$|Concrete expands and {{contracts}} with variations in temperature. Concrete shrinks as it cures. Concrete slabs curl and warp from temperature and moisture gradients {{from the top}} {{to the bottom of}} the slab. These natural responses cause concrete pavement to crack at fairly regular intervals. A fundamental of jointed concrete pavement design is to introduce a jointing system to control the location of this expected cracking. Of the three joint types, contraction, construction and isolation, contraction joints are specifically for crack control. Statistically, <b>contraction</b> <b>joint</b> systems provide assurance of crack control in new concrete pavement. However, certain design or construction factors may influence the success of a <b>contraction</b> <b>joint</b> system. Substantial changes in the weather during and after construction can induce uncontrolled cracking despite proper jointing techniques. Because of the complexity of the interrelating factors, uncontrolled cracks will occur in some new concrete pavements. These cracks generally develop within the first sixty days. When uncontrolled cracks do occur, agencies and contractors must address them to ensure long-term performance equivalent to normal pavement. There appears to be little consistency in this practice and this paper provides a summary of the causes and recommendations for minimizing the potential for cracking. The paper provides a single source review of the factors that contribute to uncontrolled cracking, including proper concrete mixture design and jointing techniques that can minimize risk of early uncontrolled cracking.

The performance of those seals was to be compared mainly with the hot poured rubberized asphalt sealants and cold applied silicone sealants or other sealants commonly used at the time this research began. Joint designs and methods of sawing were also investigated. All evaluations were done in new portland cement concrete (PCC) pavements. Three projects were initially selected and each included a research section of joint sealing. Some additional sites were later added for evaluation. Several joint sealants were evaluated at each research site. The various sites included high, medium and low levels of traffic. Evaluations were done over a five-year period.

Such methods often cover specifically small areas and may not expose hidden failures. Some tests are also labor-intensive and destructive, especially that of coring. An innovative, nondestructive, broad coverage joint seal tester that yields quick results has been designed and developed for evaluation of pavement joint seal performance. The Iowa vacuum joint seal tester (IA-VAC) applies a low vacuum above a joint seal that has been spray-covered with a foaming water solution. Any unsealed area or leak that exists along the joint will become quickly and clearly visible by the development of bubbles at the leak point.

Considering the uncertainty characteristics of earthquake and the self-adjustment of inner force of arch dams, it’s necessary to investigate the seismic performance index of arch dam for holistically evaluating the seismic safety of arch dam-foundation system subjected to high intensity seismic excitations. By considering the <b>contraction</b> <b>joints</b> movement and concrete material nonlinearity, a series of dynamic response-history analyses of arch dam were carried out under increasing levels of earthquakes.

40|$|A {{nonlinear}} {{finite element}} procedure for arch dams {{is described in}} which the gradual opening and closing of vertical contraction joints and predetermined horizontal cracking planes are considered. A special joint element approximately represents the deformations due to plane sections not remaining plane at each open joint and allows a single shell element discretization in the thickness direction {{to be used for}} the dam. Compressive and sliding nonlinearities are not included. Finite element treatments are also used for the water, assumed incompressible, and for the foundation rock, assumed massless, with all degrees of freedom (dof) off the dam condensed out. For efficiency in the computations, the condensed water and foundation matrices are localized in a way which maintains good accuracy. The response of Pacoima Dam to the 1971 San Fernando ground motion recorded on a ridge over one abutment and scaled by two-thirds is computed first for water at the intermediate level that existed during the 1971 earthquake and then for full reservoir. In the first analysis, the dam exhibits pronounced opening and separation of the contraction joints, allowing violation of the no-slip assumption. The presence of a full reservoir greatly increases the dam response, enough to bring some of the assumptions of the analysis into question. Reducing the ground motion scale to 0. 44 with full reservoir drops the response back to a reasonable level, but the <b>contraction</b> <b>joint</b> separations remain...|$|E

Survey results show that good practices have not been adopted in low volume road construction in Sri Lanka. The authors have introduced best practices which can be easily adopted by the local road construction industry. Incorrect joints construction was observed in concrete roads during the site visit and the Authors have introduced a new device for <b>contraction</b> <b>joint</b> construction.

40|$|AbstractThe study {{revealed}} that whether it is early distresses in asphalt pavement or not depends largely on working performance of base. In the field of asphalt pavement, it is widely accepted that lean concrete base, compared with the general semi-rigid base, has better working performance, such as high strength and good eroding resistance. Problem of early distresses in asphalt pavement, which caused by more traffic loadings, can be settled effectively when lean concrete is used in asphalt pavement. Traffic loading is important parameter used {{in the analysis of}} the new pavement design. However, few studies have done extensive and intensive research on the load stress for asphalt pavement of lean concrete base. Because of that, it is necessary to study the load stress for the asphalt pavement. In the paper, first of all, three–dimension finite element model of the asphalt pavement is created for the aim of doing mechanical analysis for the asphalt pavement. And then, the two main objectives of this study are investigated. One is analysis for load stress of lean concrete base, and the other is analysis for load stress of asphalt surface. The results show that load stress of lean concrete base decreases, decrease and increase with increase of base's thickness, surface's thickness and ratio of base's modulus to foundation's modulus respectively. So far as the asphalt surface is concerned, maximum shearing stress, which is caused by load, is evident in asphalt surface which is located in transverse <b>contraction</b> <b>joint</b> of lean concrete base of asphalt pavement. Maximum shearing stress decrease, decrease, decrease and increase respectively with increase of the surface's modulus, the surface's thickness, base's thickness and ratio of base's modulus to foundation's modulus...|$|E

50|$|Three main {{types of}} {{concrete}} pavements commonly used are Jointed plain concrete pavement (JPCP), jointed reinforced concrete pavement (JRCP), and {{continuously reinforced concrete}} pavements (CRCP). JPCP’s are constructed with <b>contraction</b> <b>joints</b> which direct the natural cracking of the pavement. These pavements do not use any reinforcing steel. JRCP’s are constructed with both <b>contraction</b> <b>joints</b> and reinforcing steel to control the cracking of the pavement. High temperatures and moisture stresses within the pavement creates cracking, which the reinforcing steel holds tightly together. At transverse joints, dowel bars are typically placed to assist with transferring the load of the vehicle across the cracking. CRCP’s solely rely on continuous reinforcing steel to hold the pavement’s natural transverse cracks together.

40|$|Experiments {{with early}} entry light sawing of Portland cement {{concrete}} (PCC) <b>contraction</b> <b>joints</b> began in Iowa in 1989. Since that time, changes in early sawing equipment have occurred {{as well as}} changes in specifications for sawing. The option to use early sawing for transverse <b>contraction</b> <b>joints</b> was specified in 1992. A problem happening occasionally with early sawing was the break out {{of some of the}} concrete around the end of the joint as the saw blade approached the edge of the slab. To prevent this, it was proposed that the sawing would terminate approximately 1 / 2 " to 3 / 4 " before the edge of the slab, creating a "short joint". This procedure would also leave a concrete "dam" to prevent the run-out and waste of the hot liquid joint sealant onto the shoulder. It would also eliminate the need for the labor and material for applying a duct tape dam at the open ends of each sawed joint to stop hot liquid sealant run-out Agreements were made with the contractor to apply the "short joint" technique for 1 day of paving. The evaluation and results are compared with an adjoining control section. The research found no negative aspects from sawing the "short joint". Three specific findings were noted. They are the following: 1) No joint end "blow-out" spalls of concrete occurred. 2) The need for the duct tape dam to stop liquid sealant overflow was eliminated. 3) Joint end corner spalls appear to be caused mainly by construction shouldering operations equipment.

The most notable incidents were two vertical cracks that ran down through the dam from the top. One was approximately fifty-eight feet west of the outlet gates and another about the same distance to the east.

5000|$|The {{design of}} the dam was unusual for TVA at the time. It was feared that the 2,818,000 yd³ (2,155,000 m³) of {{concrete}} required for the dam would create a structure so massive, that heat released during its setting would be trapped for years, and would eventually cause cracks to form. To aid the release of this heat, engineers divided the dam into <b>contraction</b> <b>joints</b> and outfitted them with grout pipes and cooling coils. The dam's spillway presented another problem, as engineers were worried that the water's 400 ft drop would eventually cause erosion issues at the dam's foundation.
