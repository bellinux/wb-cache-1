5|$|The {{spoil heap}} of Writhlington {{colliery}} {{is now the}} Writhlington Site of Special Scientific Interest, which includes 3,000tons of Upper Carboniferous spoil from which more than 1,400insect fossil specimens have been recovered. The complex geology and narrow seams made <b>coal</b> <b>extraction</b> difficult. Tonnage increased throughout the 19th century, reaching a peak around 1901, when there were 79separate collieries and annual production was 1,250,000tons per annum. However, due to local geological difficulties and manpower shortages output declined {{and the number of}} pits reduced from 30 {{at the beginning of the}} 20th century to 14 by the mid-thirties; the last two pits, Kilmersdon and Writhlington, closed in September 1973. The Great Western Railway and the Somerset and Dorset Railway both established stations and marshalling yards in the town. The last passenger train services to Radstock closed in 1966. Manufacturing industries such as printing, binding and packaging provide some local employment. In recent years, Radstock has increasingly become a commuter town for the nearby cities of Bath and Bristol.|$|E
5|$|By {{the turn}} of the 18th century, Felling {{consisted}} of little more than the large Brandling estate and a small scattering of tiny farming villages. However, Ralph Brandling, the incumbent of the Brandling estate at that time, had come to realise the value of the rich coal deposits on his estate and began drift mining around 1670. He initially found the large coal seams under his estate difficult to extract due to their depth, and indeed it was imported coal from Newcastle-upon-Tyne which saw the development of more extensive industries in salt, glass and chemicals which began to attract workers to the area. At around 1750, a large copper-works was opened at the banks of the River Tyne; the first such works to be developed on the river. Encouraged by these developments, Ralph Brandling's son, Charles Brandling, firstly commissioned more extensive mining of near-surface coal on his estate and then, encouraged by the discovery of several strata below his estate, began boring operations in 1758 to allow ultimately for deeper <b>coal</b> <b>extraction.</b> The result was the opening of Felling Colliery in 1779, working on the High Main stratum at a depth of 125 fathoms. A brown paper mill was also opened in 1798.|$|E

5|$|Women {{were not}} {{explicitly}} banned from voting in Great Britain until the 1832 Reform Act and the 1835 Municipal Corporations Act. In England the suffrage movement existed {{before and after}} the 1832 act, but did not form a national organisation until the creation of the National Society for Women's Suffrage in 1872. Although there were notable exceptions such as the working-class areas of Lancashire, the women's suffrage movement in England was predominantly a middle-class movement. In Wales there were only two narrow bands of wealthy society in the Anglicised north and south coastal areas. Much of the female population of an emerging 19th century Wales was based in the low-waged, densely-populated, industrialised valleys of the south. At first women found work in metalworking and <b>coal</b> <b>extraction,</b> but then faced mass unemployment after the 1842 Mines and Collieries Act had prohibited them from working underground. The coal mining industry, with its absence of pithead baths, led to unpaid women's employment as the need to keep both their homes and the family's menfolk clean became a never ending task. This led to the image of the stoic Welsh Mam, a matriarch of the home, but little {{could be further from the}} truth in a society controlled by men.|$|E

40|$|<b>Coal</b> seam gas <b>extraction</b> is a {{relatively}} young and rapidly developing industry. Many members of Government {{and the general public}} have expressed concern about the potential negative environmental impacts of <b>coal</b> seam gas <b>extraction</b> and its associated processes. Gaps in knowledge, such as the role of fractures in facilitating fluid flow, and their potential to impact groundwater, need to be further investigated in order to properly assess the risks associated with <b>coal</b> seam gas <b>extraction.</b> With this in mind, this study was conducted to determine the ability of fractures within the Narrabeen Group in the Southern Coalfields of New South Wales, to facilitate fluid flow following <b>coal</b> seam gas <b>extraction.</b> The upper limit of fracture hydraulic conductivity in the modelled conditions was determined, and limitations of this potential were identified. The ability of Narrabeen Group fractures to contribute to environmental degradation following <b>coal</b> seam gas <b>extraction</b> was also assessed. Outcrops of Narrabeen Group units were studied in order to constrain the density and extent of systematic fracturing.

25|$|The dock {{accommodation}} at Methil {{was very}} limited, being only {{capable of handling}} ships up to 150 tons. As the rate of <b>coal</b> <b>extraction</b> increased, the lack of useful local harbour facilities became of increasing significance, and in 1879 Wemyss and his tenant coalmasters agreed {{on the construction of}} a proper dock at Methil. To avoid opposition from the Leven Harbour Company, Wemyys approached them to purchase their business. They were receptive, as all their initial capital had been expended and further construction was needed, which they were unable to fund. Struggling with heavy indebtedness, the Company sold out to the Wemyss Estate (Randolph Wemyss, his tenant colliers and certain other business interests) in 1883 for £12,000. By this purchase the Wemyss Estate acquired the branch railway to Leven Harbour.|$|E

25|$|The most {{economical}} {{method of}} <b>coal</b> <b>extraction</b> from coal seams {{depends on the}} depth {{and quality of the}} seams, and the geology and environmental factors. Coal mining processes are differentiated by whether they operate on the surface or underground.

Technical and economic feasibility are evaluated based on the following: regional geological conditions; overburden characteristics; coal seam continuity, thickness, structure, quality, and depth; strength of materials above and below the seam for roof and floor conditions; topography (especially altitude and slope); climate; land ownership as it affects the availability of land for mining and access; surface drainage patterns; ground water conditions; availability of labor and materials; coal purchaser requirements in terms of tonnage, quality, and destination; and capital investment requirements.|$|E

2500|$|The Ogallala Aquifer of {{the central}} United States {{is one of the}} world's great aquifers, but in places it is being rapidly {{depleted}} by growing municipal use, and continuing agricultural use.

2500|$|Coal Pollution Mitigation is {{a process}} whereby coal is {{chemically}} washed of minerals and impurities, sometimes gasified, burned and the resulting flue gases treated with steam, {{with the purpose of}} removing sulfur dioxide, and reburned so as to make the carbon dioxide in the flue gas economically recoverable, and storable underground (the latter of which is called [...] "carbon capture and storage"). The coal industry uses the term [...] "clean coal" [...] to describe technologies designed to enhance both the efficiency and the environmental acceptability of <b>coal</b> <b>extraction,</b> preparation and use, but has provided no specific quantitative limits on any emissions, particularly carbon dioxide. Whereas contaminants like sulfur or mercury can be removed from coal, carbon cannot be effectively removed while still leaving a usable fuel, and clean coal plants without carbon sequestration and storage do not significantly reduce carbon dioxide emissions.

2500|$|Étienne Mantoux, a French economist, was {{the harshest}} {{contemporaneous}} critic of Keynes. In his posthumously published book, The Carthaginian Peace, or the Economic Consequences of Mr. Keynes, Mantoux said that Keynes [...] "had been wrong on various counts, especially {{with respect to}} his predictions about Germany's coal, iron and steel production...and its level of national saving". Keynes said Europe's overall output of iron would decrease; Mantoux said the opposite occurred. By 1929, European iron output had increased by ten per cent from that of 1913. Keynes believed that this European trend would also affect German iron and steel production. Mantoux says this prediction was also incorrect. By 1927, German steel output had increased by 30 per cent and iron output increased by 38 per cent from 1913. Keynes predicted that German <b>coal</b> <b>extraction</b> would also decrease and that Germany {{would not be able}} to export coal immediately after the war. Mantoux also counters these arguments. By 1920, German was exporting 15 million tons of coal a year and reached 35 million tons by 1926. By 1929, German coal mining had risen by 30 per cent on the 1913 figures because of her increased labor efficiency methods. In regard to national savings, Keynes stated that 2 billion marks would only be possible after the adoption of the treaty. Mantoux says that the 1925 German national savings figure was estimated at 6.4 billion marks, rising to 7.6 billion marks by 1927. Mantoux calculated that Germany borrowed between 8 billion and 35 billion marks in the period 1920–1931, while only paying 21 billion in reparations. This, he says, allowed Germany to re-equip, expand, and modernize her industry. Highlighting the rearmament under Hitler, Mantoux said Germany [...] "had been in a stronger position to pay reparations than Keynes had made out". He also says that Germany could have paid all of the reparations if she had wanted to, and that the problem was not that Germany was unable to pay, but that she was unwilling to pay.|$|E

30|$|Underground gas {{extraction}} {{has been a}} conventional method to guarantee safe production in high-gas coal beds in China (Lin 2010). Since the 1980 s, <b>coalbed</b> methane <b>extraction</b> through surface wells has been popular in China, achieving the simultaneous <b>extraction</b> of <b>coal</b> and gas (Li et al. 2014). At present, the exploitation of coalbed methane in China is concentrated in medium- and high-rank coalfields. Research in low-rank <b>coalbed</b> methane <b>extraction</b> is immature (Qiao 2009). Owing to advances in low-rank methane exploitation in the Powder River Basin, Raton Basin and Alberta Basin, the economic value of low-rank coalbed methane increased (Fu et al. 2006; Sun et al. 2009; Ye et al. 2009). In China, coalbed methane resources in low-rank coalfields account for 47  % of the gross amount (Liu and Gao 2014). A typical low-rank coal bed is characterized by multiple layers, large thicknesses, high permeability and low gas content. The huge reserve of coal can be offset by its poor gas content, and thus coalbed methane from low-rank coal has good prospects for future development (Han 1980).|$|R
