2500|$|Another {{challenge}} with designing sound systems for live music clubs {{is that the}} sound system {{may need to be}} used for both prerecorded music played by DJs and live music. If the sound system is optimized for prerecorded DJ music, then it will not provide the appropriate sound qualities (or mixing equipment and monitoring equipment) needed for live music, and vice versa. A club system designed for DJs needs a DJ mixer and space for record players. Clubs tend to focus on either live music or DJ shows. However, clubs which feature both types of shows may face challenges providing the desired equipment and set-up for both uses. In contrast, a live music club needs a mixing board designed for live sound, an onstage monitor system, and a multicore [...] "snake" [...] cable running from the stage to the mixer. Lastly, live music clubs can be a hostile environment for sound gear, in that the air may be hot, humid, and smoky; in some clubs, keeping racks of power amplifiers cool may be a challenge. Often an air <b>conditioned</b> <b>room</b> just for the amplifiers is utilised.|$|E

50|$|In {{the private}} hospitals, babies are {{delivered}} solely by obstetricians, and the expectant mothers are attended by nurses, midwives (who essentially act as labour and delivery nurses) and doulas, if specifically {{hired by the}} mothers. The total cost to have a vaginal delivery {{in the private sector}} is approximately $17,000-20,000 TTD (about $3000 USD) and double that price for a Cesarean section. Certain employers do provide private insurance, but it does not cover a significant portion of this cost to make it an affordable option for most. The private hospitals have similar technology use, as in hospitals in the U.S., for fetal monitoring and pain management. Unlike the public hospitals, epidurals are guaranteed if wanted. Cesarean sections are performed in cases of medical indication and can also be performed on request, though that is rare. The Cesarean section rate in most private facilities is about 30%. Labouring women in private facilities often have more flexibility in what they can do: whether it is eating during labour, moving around, or having numerous support persons with them. In general, labour takes place in a private air <b>conditioned</b> <b>room</b> with family members and a doula if previously arranged by the family.|$|E
50|$|The {{control signal}} is not {{transmitted}} by wire from the Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB) in Braunschweig to the transmitting {{radio station in}} Mainflingen but is generated at the place of emission using a control unit developed by the PTB. This control unit, which is housed in an air <b>conditioned</b> <b>room</b> of the transmitting station, is shielded against high-frequency interferences and controlled from Braunschweig. For reasons of operational reliability, the control signal is generated by three independent control channels all equipped with their own caesium atomic clock. In addition a rubidium atomic clock is available on site. To avoid incorrect emissions the output of these three channels are compared in two electronic switch circuits on site. Output for transmission is only generated when {{at least two of}} the three channels are in agreement. Via the public telephone network operational data of the control unit can be called up with the aid of a telecontrol system. Furthermore, the carrier phase time and the states of the second markers are compared in Braunschweig with the setpoints specified by the PTB's atomic master clocks. Of these atomic clocks the CS2 atomic clock in Braunschweig provides the German national legal time standard, and can be used as a highly accurate frequency standard.If there are deviations, the necessary corrections will be made via the telecontrol system.|$|E

5000|$|A typical {{corporate}} {{or university}} computer installation {{would have a}} suite of rooms, with a large, access-restricted, air <b>conditioned</b> <b>room</b> for the computer (similar to a modern server room) and a smaller adjacent room for submitting jobs. Nearby would be {{a room full of}} keypunch machines for programmer use. An IBM 407 Accounting Machine might be set up to allow newly created or edited programs to be listed (printed out on fan-fold paper) for proof reading. An IBM 519 might be provided to reproduce program decks for backup or to punch sequential numbers in columns 73-80. In such mainframe installations, known as closed shops, programmers submitted the program decks, often followed by data cards to be read by the program, to a person working behind a counter in the computer room. Many computer installations used cards with the opposite corner cut (sometimes no corner cut) as [...] "job separators", so that an operator could stack several job decks in the card reader {{at the same time and}} be able to quickly separate the decks manually when he removed them from the stacker. These cards (e.g., a JCL [...] "JOB" [...] card to start a new job) were often prepunched in large quantities in advance. This was especially useful when the main computer did not read the cards directly, but instead read their images from magnetic tape that was prepared offline by smaller computers such as the IBM 1401. After running a program, the computer operator would return the card deck and any hardcopy printed or punched output, typically to one of a set of alphabetically labelled cubby holes, based on the programmer's last initial. This was all batch-mode processing, as opposed to interactive processing.|$|E
5000|$|The {{number of}} {{subwoofer}} speaker cabinets and power amplifiers dedicated to low-frequency sounds {{used in a}} club depends {{on the type of}} club, the genres of music played there (live or via a DJ), {{and the size of the}} venue.

On the other hand, a club where hard rock or heavy metal music bands play or a nightclub where house music DJs play dance music may have multiple large 18" [...] subwoofers in big cabinets and powerful amplifiers dedicated for subwoofers, as these genres and music styles typically use powerful, deep bass sound.Another challenge with designing sound systems for live music clubs is that the sound system may need to be used for both prerecorded music played by DJs and live music.
