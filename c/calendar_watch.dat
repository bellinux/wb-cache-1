50|$|With {{the rise}} of Japaneses watches and the Quartz Crisis in the 1970s, the company became an {{affiliate}} of the General Watch Company, a sub-holding company of ASUAG. As part of the move, Technos and Certina {{was transferred to the}} Biel/Bienne Edox location. At the end of the downturn in the Swiss watch industry in 1983, Edox re-gained independence when the company was sold to Victor Strambini Montres Vista SA and moved to Les Genevez, Jura Mountains. It has since remained a family-owned company. The Edox Les Bémonts Ultra Slim was released in 1998.

50|$|Son Bill {{followed}} in his father's footsteps by joining the CIA after {{serving in the}} U.S. Army in Germany. He was then hired by the CIA in 1958 as an interpreter and translator, as he knew five tribal languages. Bill Young's knowledge of the Golden Triangle region, command of indigenous languages, and recent military experience made him an ideal candidate for service in the CIA's paramilitary wing - then known as the Special Operations Division. The Agency's rueful joke concerning Bill Young stated {{that he had an}} American exterior to disguise his Lahu interior. The very cultural background that made Young so valuable to the CIA would also become the font of their problems with him. He was stubbornly independent, and tended to take orders only from Bill Lair. In Lahu fashion, he was not strict in observing a punctual duty schedule. He did not always observe the niceties of <b>calendar</b> or <b>watch,</b> which led to complaints from other CIA case officers. Young was known to have a legion of female admirers, and a penchant for the occasional French leave, thus irritating his superiors. Additionally, his personality clashed with that of coworker Pat Landry as they worked together at the Royal Thai Air Force Base at Udorn. All of these scotched his chance for which he seemed ideally suited, that of CIA adviser to Hmong General Vang Pao.|$|R
25|$|In {{a famous}} murder case, the Rolex on Ronald Platt's wrist {{eventually}} led to the arrest of his murderer, Albert Johnson Walker—a financial planner who had fled from Canada when he was charged with 18 counts of fraud, theft, and money laundering. When the body was found in the English Channel in 1996 by a fisherman named John Coprik, a Rolex wristwatch was the only identifiable object on the body. Since the Rolex movement had a serial number and was engraved with special markings every time it was serviced, British police traced the service records from Rolex and identified the owner of the watch as Ronald Platt. In addition, British police were able to determine the date of death by examining the date on the <b>watch</b> <b>calendar.</b> Since the Rolex movement was fully waterproof and had a reserve of two to three days of operation when inactive, they were able to determine the time of death within a small margin of error.|$|R

Walker took Platt out on a fishing trip 20 July 1996 where he murdered him, weighed him down with an anchor, and dumped his body in the sea. Two weeks later the body was discovered in the English Channel by fisherman John Copik with a Rolex wristwatch the only identifiable object on the body. Since the Rolex movement had a serial number and was engraved with special markings every time it was serviced, British police traced the service records from Rolex. Ronald Joseph Platt was identified {{as the owner of}} the watch and the victim of the murder. In addition British police were able to determine the date of death by examining the date on the <b>watch</b> <b>calendar</b> and since the Rolex movement had a reserve of two to three days of operation when inactive and it was fully waterproof, they were able to determine the time of death within a small margin of error. Walker was apprehended shortly thereafter.|$|R
5000|$|Awareness {{has grown}} that {{different}} cultures have different concepts of time (and space). In his study [...] "The American Indian Mind in a Linear World", Donald Fixico describes an alternate concept of time. [...] "Indian thinking" [...] involves [...] "‘seeing’ things from a perspective emphasizing that circles and cycles {{are central to}} world and that all things are related within the Universe." [...] He then suggests that [...] "the concept of time for Indian people {{has been such a}} continuum that time becomes less relevant and the rotation of life or seasons of the year are stressed as important." [...] In a more specific example, the folklorist Toelken describes the Navajo as living in circular times, which is echoed and re-enforced in their sense of space, the traditional circular or multi-sided hogan. Lacking the European mechanistic devices of marking time (clocks, <b>watches,</b> <b>calendars),</b> they depended on the cycles of nature: sunrise to sunset, winter to summer. Their stories and histories are not marked by decades and centuries, but remain close in, as they circle around the constant rhythms of the natural world.|$|R
40|$|In the {{university}} forest of Tokyo in Chichibu, two video recording robot cameras for forests (hereinafter “robot camera”) with stereophonic microphones are recording forest images and acoustic {{data on a}} daily basis. We believe that these video data, which include movies and sound recordings, {{can be used for}} making a new learning environment for children that will help them to feel the forest phenology intuitively. In this study, which targeted an audience at or older than the third grade in primary schools, we aimed to make a prototype multimedia resource for environmental education. We used video data from 6 th January 2003 to 5 th January 2004 from our video data archives and digitalized them. The media we produced were; i) printed cards, where one card expresses one climatic season, and its associated PDF file, ii) the DVD, which consists of the climatic seasonal chapter and temperature graphs with natural sounds, and iii) the website from which the audience can download the PDF and DVD files and which includes further information about the robot cameras. We introduced the Japanese traditional seasonal expression as a calendar, which contains 24 seasonal periods and 72 climatic seasons. The 24 seasonal periods and 72 climatic seasons are effective when organizing forest transition images; therefore we produced the printed calendar and the DVD following these traditional seasonal units. In the printed calendar, one card represents one climatic season. One chapter on the DVD corresponded to one climatic season and each chapter has daily video images and sounds with temperature graphs associated with this period. Additionally, we built the website as a complement to the calendar and the DVD. Here children can also easily learn about robot cameras as well as downloading all the contents of the calendar in PDF format and the DVD. Consequently, we examined the effective design of these multimedia resources through the process of making a prototype. For example, there are useful techniques such as watching the DVD while using the printed calendar cards as an index of contents or for checking more details about the <b>calendar</b> contents while <b>watching</b> and listening to the DVD. It is necessary for each set of contents to be designed in a complementary way. In the future, it is expected to use this prototype with collaboration of schools so that we can evaluate with school teachers if it is a useful resource for environmental education. 東京大学秩父演習林では， 1995 年より 2 台の森林映像記録ロボットカメラによる森林景観のビデオ記録が続けられている。定点定時の記録動画と音声は，森林の日々の様子を直感的に感ずることのできる環境学習コンテンツになると考えた。本研究では，小学校の総合学習において，環境教育の映像教材を利用する可能性のある 3 年生以上の小学生を視聴者と想定し， 2003 年 1 月 6 日から 2004 年 1 月 5 日の 1 年間の森林映像データと気象データをデジタル化し， 24 節季 72 候の暦に従って，候単位で映像記録をとりまとめたデジタルコンテンツを試作した。メディアは， 1 候を 1 枚のカードにレイアウトデザインした印刷物とPDFファイル，１候を１チャプターとして日々の映像と音声，及び気温の時間変化グラフを視聴できるビデオ再生画面レイアウトをデザインしたDVDを作成した。またPDFファイルとDVDファイルをダウンロードできるWeb サイトには，森林映像記録ロボットカメラについて視聴者に理解できるように平易な文章で解説を掲載し，デジタルコンテンツを配信できるようにした。試作を通じて，印刷物とDVDを一緒に視聴することで，印刷物を見ながらDVDで映像を選択して視聴する方法や，逆にDVD映像を見ながらその前後をカードで一覧するなどの使い方があることが分かった。森林の日々の様子を擬似的にでも感じる際に，印刷物とDVDとが相互に補完するメディアとしてデザインすることが必要だと思われる。本研究での試作を通じて明らかになったデザインを踏まえ，さらに洗練したデジタルコンテンツを新たに制作し，森林環境の変化を子供達が感じ取れるデジタルコンテンツの評価実験を小学校の教員との共同で進めたい...|$|R
