5000|$|Other {{decorative}} surface stitches such as fly stitch, running stitch, <b>cable</b> <b>stitch</b> and French knots.|$|E
50|$|Many {{elaborate}} {{designs were}} developed, {{such as the}} <b>cable</b> <b>stitch</b> used on Aran sweaters, which {{was developed in the}} early 20th century in Ireland.|$|E
50|$|F. Honeycomb stitch: {{a medium}} density variant on the <b>cable</b> <b>stitch</b> that double {{stitches}} {{each set of}} gathers and provides more spacing between them, with an intervening diagonal stitch concealed on the reverse side of the fabric.|$|E
5000|$|Knotted <b>cable</b> chain <b>stitch,</b> a knotted {{variant of}} <b>cable</b> chain <b>stitch</b> ...|$|R
50|$|Traditional hand smocking {{begins with}} marking smocking dots in a grid {{pattern on the}} wrong side of the fabric and {{gathering}} it with temporary running stitches. These stitches are anchored on each end in a manner that facilitates later removal and are analogous to basting stitches. Then a row of <b>cable</b> <b>stitching</b> stabilizes the top and bottom of the working area.|$|R
50|$|The {{stitches}} crossing behind {{are transferred}} to a small cable needle for storage while the stitches passing in front (or behind) are knitted. The former stitches are then transferred {{back to the original}} needle or knitted from the cable needle itself. Rather than use a cable needle, some knitters prefer to use a large safety pin or, for a single stitch, simply hold it in their fingers while knitting the other <b>stitch(es).</b> <b>Cabling</b> is typically done only when working {{on the right side of}} the fabric, i.e., every other row. This creates a spacer row, which helps the fabric to relax.|$|R
50|$|The <b>cable</b> <b>stitch,</b> {{which is}} {{the most common type of}} stitch seen on Aran sweaters, is said to {{represent}} a fishermanâ€™s ropes. There are many different type of cable stitches. The technique for cabling, which involves crossing one stitch over another is one of the easier stitches.|$|E
5000|$|Cable {{knitting}} usually {{produces a}} fabric {{that is less}} flexible and more dense than typical knitting, having a much narrower gauge. This narrow gauge should be considered when changing from the <b>cable</b> <b>stitch</b> to another type of knitted fabric. If the number of stitches is not reduced, the second knitted fabric may flare out or pucker, due to its larger gauge. Thus, ribbed cuffs on an aran sweater may not contract around the wrist or waist, as would normally be expected. Conversely, stitches {{may need to be}} added to maintain the gauge when changing from another knitted fabric such as stocking to a cable pattern.|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} create {{realistic}} loop primitives suitable for the faster CAD of the flat-knitted fabric, we have performed research {{on the model of}} the loop as well as the variation of the loop surface. This paper proposes an interlacing point-based model for the loop center curve, and uses the cubic Bezier curve to fit the central curve of the regular loop, elongated loop, transfer loop, and irregular deformed loop. In this way, a general model for the central curve of the deformed loop is obtained. The obtained model is then utilized to perform texture mapping, texture interpolation, and brightness processing, simulating a clearly structured and lifelike deformed loop. The computer program LOOP is developed by using the algorithm. The deformed loop is simulated with different yarns, and the deformed loop is applied to design of a <b>cable</b> <b>stitch,</b> demonstrating feasibility of the proposed algorithm. This paper provides a loop primitive simulation method characterized by lifelikeness, yarn material variability, and deformation flexibility, and facilitates the loop-based fast computer-aided design (CAD) of the knitted fabric...|$|E
2500|$|Some more {{advanced}} knitting techniques create a surprising variety of complex textures. Combining certain increases, which can create small eyelet {{holes in the}} resulting fabric, with assorted decreases [...] is key to creating knitted lace, a very open fabric resembling lace. Open vertical stripes can be created using the drop-stitch knitting technique. Changing the order of stitches from one row to the next, usually {{with the help of}} a <b>cable</b> needle or <b>stitch</b> holder, is key to cable knitting, producing an endless variety of cables, honeycombs, ropes, and Aran sweater patterning. Entrelac forms a rich checkerboard texture by knitting small squares, picking up their side edges, and knitting more squares to continue the piece.|$|R
