We highlight the significant effect that the inclusion of supplier/customer interests has on these <b>corporate</b> <b>policies...</b>|$|R

The model structure is unique, incorporating features of product mix, sequencing and blending models. The model's structure is described as well as typical results it produced. The recommendations for corporate actions arising from the model are also explained. Recommendations were made to alter the existing <b>corporate</b> <b>policies</b> on brand proliferation and limited inventory levels. The product line has been reduced {{as a result of the}} study, and a policy decision to expand the inventory has been made.

Using Japanese firms' {{data from}} 1987 - 2000, {{we have shown}} that the {{strength}} of corporate culture significantly affects <b>corporate</b> <b>policies</b> such as employment policy, management structure, and financial structure.

Firms run by CEOs who experienced distress issue less debt, save more cash, and invest less than other firms. Past experience affects both managerial appointments and <b>corporate</b> <b>policies,</b> with stronger effects in poorly governed firms. We find similar effects on debt and cash, but not investment, for CFOs. The results suggest that policies vary with managers’ experiences and throughout their careers...|$|R

The announcement caused a dramatic decrease in value although prospective tax shields partially offset the losses, adding 4. 6 % to firm value. In response to changing tax incentives, firms subsequently adjusted their <b>corporate</b> <b>policies.</b> They increased leverage to gain interest tax shields and reversed changes in other policies made to capitalize on tax benefits. The evidence supports the view that taxes are important for corporate decision-making...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{develops}} and empirically tests a model {{designed to}} distinguish the role of real and …nancing frictions on …rms’investment, debt …nancing and equity …nancing policies. Real frictions include …xed costs of investment and adjustment costs. Financing frictions include taxes, collateral constraints, ‡otation costs of equity and dividend constraints. Because of …nancing frictions, all <b>corporate</b> <b>policies</b> are interrelated and depend on average Q. Due to …xed costs of investment and binding …nancing constraints, the sensitivity of <b>corporate</b> <b>policies</b> to Q is non-linear. The empirical tests demonstrate that both the endogeneity and non-linearities created by real and …nancing frictions are economically signi…cant. The model then relates the e¤ects of real and …-nancing frictions on <b>corporate</b> <b>policies</b> to stock returns. The paper provides a rationale for the documented poor performance of Q-theory in explaining investment, and for the di¤erential performance of the neoclassical investment model in explaining investment and stock returns. The paper extends Q-theory to explain debt and equity issues, and shows that market to book sorts control for non-linearities in investment policies.

30|$|Despite {{the range}} of {{interactions}} available due to mobile device sensors, passwords and PINs remain commonplace authentication methods due to their familiarity, ease of use {{and the existence of}} code libraries, widgets and development toolkits that support them as authenticators. The availability of development tools that support password use is bolstered by <b>corporate</b> <b>policies</b> that mandate password use on mobile devices that store or access corporate information, despite studies that have shown that these policies can produce passwords that are less secure than expected [15]. Such policies often dictate the length and required characters in a password, but do not allow for alternative authentication methods. Interestingly, <b>corporate</b> password <b>policies</b> have been shown to negatively impact employee productivity due to their strict, inflexible nature [16]. Identifying the issues and limitations of passwords with respect to mobile devices may provide information for corporations, enabling updates to their <b>corporate</b> <b>policies</b> to include authentication alternatives.|$|R

40|$|The {{literature}} on managerial style posits a linear relation between a CEO's past experiences and firm risk. We {{show that there}} is a nonmonotonic relation between the intensity of CEOs’ early-life exposure to fatal disasters and corporate risk-taking. CEOs who experience fatal disasters without extremely negative consequences lead firms that behave more aggressively, whereas CEOs who witness the extreme downside of disasters behave more conservatively. These patterns manifest across various <b>corporate</b> <b>policies</b> including leverage, cash holdings, and acquisition activity. Ultimately, the link between CEOs’ disaster experience and <b>corporate</b> <b>policies</b> has real economic consequences on firm riskiness and cost of capital.
