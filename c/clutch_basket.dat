25|$|With the 11th {{overall pick}} in the 2006 NBA draft, the Magic took the former Duke star J. J. Redick. Even with the fan support to get him playing time he {{averaged}} just over 11 minutes a game. After beginning the season strong with a 13–4 record, the Orlando Magic began to suffer in the standings {{as the result of}} multiple losses, {{due in large part to}} the injuries of Tony Battie, Keyon Dooling, and Grant Hill. The Magic were also hampered with the sporadic play of many of their young stars, who on multiple occasions showed their propensity for streaky shooting and the team's lack of a solid scoring two-guard. Despite the team's poor play, Dwight Howard continued to develop and blossom in his third year in the league, culminating in his first selection to the Eastern Conference All-Star team. The final few weeks of the season saw the Magic build momentum and confidence with an impressive late push towards the Playoffs. On April 15, 2007, with an 88–86 victory over the Boston Celtics, the Magic secured its first berth in the NBA Playoffs since 2003 by locking up the 8th seed in the Eastern Conference. This marked the first time that the team had made the playoffs while posting a losing record. Nevertheless, their Playoff run ended on April 28, 2007 after they were swept in the first round by first seeded Detroit Pistons whose experience, veteran leadership and ability to consistently make the <b>clutch</b> <b>basket</b> proved far too much for the undermanned and overwhelmed Magic to overcome. It was announced on May 23, 2007, that Brian Hill had been fired as head coach of the Magic.|$|E

5000|$|He {{was given}} the moniker [...] "Mr. Clutch" [...] for his {{propensity}} to hit <b>clutch</b> <b>baskets</b> during crucial moments of a game. He is known for looping layups against imports and local behemoths that were impossible to block, and booming outside shots.|$|R
500|$|The Lakers won 54 {{regular season}} games and secured a first-round bye in the 1962 NBA Playoffs. They beat the Pistons four games to two {{to advance to}} the 1962 NBA Finals against the Boston Celtics. The teams split the first two games, {{and at the end of}} Game 3 in Los Angeles, West tied the game at 115. The Celtics' Sam Jones inbounded the ball at half-court with three seconds left. West stole the ball, raced upcourt, and {{converted}} a running layup as the buzzer sounded. The Celtics tied the series in Game 6 at three games apiece, and the teams headed to Boston for Game 7. For most of the game, the Lakers trailed, but West and Frank Selvy hit several <b>clutch</b> <b>baskets</b> and tied the game at 100. Selvy then missed an open 8-foot shot which would have won the Lakers their first title. Baylor's tip-in attempt was thwarted by Sam Jones. In overtime, Jones scored several <b>clutch</b> <b>baskets</b> to ensure a 110–107 win for the Celtics. The 1962 NBA finals would serve as the beginning of the greatest rivalry in NBA history ...|$|R

50|$|Prior to the series, Celtics player-coach Bill Russell {{decided not}} to double-team Lakers star guard Jerry West. West was {{initially}} complaining of exhaustion, but in the game, all was forgotten. He used this freedom to score 53 points on opposing guards Sam Jones and Larry Siegfried. In an action-packed match, the lead changed 21 times, and it was Lakers center Wilt Chamberlain who sealed {{the game with a}} <b>clutch</b> <b>basket</b> 23 seconds before the end.|$|E
5000|$|In 2001 the WR400F's {{engine was}} uprated {{and it became}} the WR426F {{increasing}} the displacement to [...] for greater power and throttle response. A beefier YZ style <b>clutch</b> <b>basket</b> and plates than those on the WR400 improved clutch performance. Frame geometry was identical to the 2002 YZ250 and YZ426F with a 58.7 inch wheelbase and 14.7 inches of ground clearance.

He also helped the Milwaukee Bucks and Minnesota Timberwolves reach the Conference Finals of the playoffs in 2001 and 2004 respectively, the latter's first-ever in {{franchise}} history, and helped the Los Angeles Clippers to their first-ever playoff series victory in 2006.

Castillo retired while Evangelista joined the Giants' coaching staff. Evangelista played his entire career with the Purefoods franchise that drafted him second overall in 1994. He won four championships with Purefoods and was known as a solid defender and rebounder. Castillo, on the other hand, was dreaded for his <b>clutch</b> <b>baskets</b> and was a consistent marksman throughout his career. He won a championship with the team in 2006 PBA Philippine Cup.|$|R
5000|$|In 2008, he {{returned}} to Panathinaikos. It was his second return to the club, {{and he was in}} the starting lineup for the team, as they won the coveted Triple Crown during the 2008-09 season.

50|$|Initially, {{items that}} were subject to the most abuse from racing {{were the first to}} be remade. Originally made of die cast aluminum, the <b>clutch</b> <b>basket</b> was found to be weak when power was {{increased}} or subjected to race conditions. The first aftermarket <b>clutch</b> <b>basket</b> was a machined steel piece campaigned by Gary Denton in 1989.3 Wayne Hinson, who would later found worldwide clutch component manufacturer Hinson Racing, designed the <b>clutch</b> <b>basket</b> and later changed it to billet aluminum in 1991.3 A regular trend that started on the Fourtrax that would not carry over to the four strokes was the use of aftermarket frames. Stock frames on most mass-produced quads are made of mild steel and, though suitable for recreational use, will quickly develop cracks when raced. Without new quads available after the 1989 model year, stronger replacement frames for racing were soon needed. The first aftermarket frame for the 250R was made by dirt track motorcycle chassis builder, C&J in 1991 for CT Racing.3 This frame was a direct replacement for the original, maintaining stock suspension geometry. The first altered geometry frame was introduced by JP Racing a short while later. 3 This design brought the front suspension mounts in one inch on each side, allowing the use of longer suspension arms in competition, which increased wheel travel and improved the ride qualities. By 2003, a myriad of aftermarket frames could be had from numerous manufacturers in both stock and altered geometry, made of steel and aluminum. Lone Star Racing produced a titanium frame, but AMA rules prevented its use in competition. Though Honda was initially concerned with reliability and detuned the original 250cc motor, with the release of the Pro-X (pro-cross) cylinder and head in 1994, the 250R’s displacement could be increased well into the 300cc range by changing the cylinder alone. Additionally, this and other aftermarket cylinders offered advanced port layout for more tuning options. With modifications to the transmission cases, later aftermarket cylinders and crankshafts permitted engine displacements to reach 500cc’s. The last version of the Pro-X cylinder, as well as others, also added an exhaust operated powervalve, a feature that was left off the 250R but used almost universally by the competition, as well as in Two-Stroke motocross bikes since the mid-eighties.|$|E
50|$|The 1985-86 {{season is}} arguably the most memorable in Vikings history, as they {{achieved}} the improbable in becoming the first ever 14th seeded team {{to make it to the}} Sweet Sixteen of the 1986 NCAA Tournament. Coach Kevin Mackey's squad, led by Ken 'Mouse' McFadden and Eric Mudd, upset Bobby Knight's 3rd seeded Indiana Hoosiers, by a final of 83-79. Following a 75-69 second round win against 6th seeded St.Joseph's, the Vikings would ultimately lose to Navy 71-70 on a <b>clutch</b> <b>basket</b> in the waning seconds by future Hall of Famer, David Robinson.

50|$|UE subdued FEU, 78-74 in {{the second}} round of the UAAP {{basketball}} series at the Rizal Memorial Coliseum. But the jam-packed crowd of 9,000 (over maximum capacity of the coliseum) got an unexpected show after the final buzzer when cagers from both teams engaged in an impromptu brawl on the floor. The fight was triggered off by a last-second scuffle for the ball between Tamaraw Romy Diaz and Warrior Carlos Quitzon. Quitzon had the ball and was being harassed by Diaz when the buzzer sounded and hell broke loose. Searing blast by lanky Jimmy Mariano and <b>clutch</b> <b>baskets</b> by Jose Sison and Wenceslao Olaguera at the homestretch saved the Warriors after they were behind by six points.

50|$|One of {{the common}} early {{problems}} was with the <b>clutch</b> <b>basket</b> which was eventually replaced under warranty. The intermediate gear was strengthened and concentricity improved. However, the problem then moved to the next weakest part, the alternator drive shaft/Z25 gear, which, in extreme cases could break at a lubrication hole. It commonly manifested itself in the 1130 variant of the engine, as a difficulty {{to crank the engine}} when hot. The root cause of the clutch / alternator drive problem was thermal expansion, which reduced the Z25 / intermediate gear clearances to negative. The solution was to improve the concentricity of both the clutch intermediate and alternator drive shaft gears, and increase their clearance. At the same time, the alternator drive hub fastening method was changed from a lock washer to a belleville washer to stop the bolt from working loose due to heat cycling.|$|E

25|$|In {{the bronze}} medal series, Rytas faced BC Neptūnas, {{who was now}} {{considered}} the favorite due to problems internally in Rytas.

As a result of his endurance, he was a devastating fastbreak finisher, one who could suddenly score in bunches when his Celtics team would shut out the other team and grab defensive rebounds. Although {{he did not have a}} high field goal percentage, he was a clutch outside shooter with great range. He was also the type of player who would do what it took to help his team score a victory, such as grab a crucial rebound, draw a charge, come up with a steal in a key defensive moment, or settle the team with a <b>clutch</b> <b>basket</b> or assist.

(Dora, that is, not my granddaughter.) At least Dora is educational, I rationalize, or if not exactly educational, at least not harmful. Besides, my granddaughter loves her. There are three Dora episodes on this particular DVD. When the egg hunt finally ends, I persuade my granddaughter to consider a different episode. I am not good with the remote control at the best of times. This is not the best of times, and we somehow end up at a menu selection I have not seen before. That is how we discover “Linny the Guinea Pig Under the Ocean, ” a two-and-a-half-minute episode that interrupts 1 Dora the way a tree interrupts a billboard; the way art interrupts advertising. This paper is a reflection on my encounter with Linny and the questions and exploration that followed. It is about wondering how Linny the Guinea Pig artfully interrupts the ideology of Dora the Explorer. It is about Dora too, of course, and the giant corporation that spawned her. But mostly it is about the way a creative little film challenges the core assumptions of consumer-based education; it is about the way imagination interrupts mass-market educational television...|$|R
5000|$|The signings of the {{new season}} began by {{contract}} extensions with Artūras Jomantas and Artūras Gudaitis, who decided {{to stay in the}} club. Following it, Rytas signed David Logan, who had been an Euroleague star under the command of Tomas Pačėsas. On July 23, the front line was strengthened by athletic Kenny Kadji. On July 27, Adam Łapeta signed a new two-year contract. During the summer, team captain Kavaliauskas reportedly had disputes with the team management concerning pay. Soon it was announced that Kavaliauskas would probably not return for the next season, leading to Kavaliauskas deleting the infamous [...] "Loyalty.." [...] message he wrote about Lietuvos Rytas last summer. In August, in a move that shocked fans from both teams alike, Kavaliauskas left the team and signed with Žalgiris Kaunas. On August 30, Drew Gordon was signed. On October 1, Rashaun Broadus signed a trial deal. On October 2, Kadji was released after failing to adapt to the team and playing just three games. On November 22, one of the Nigerian Olympic national team leaders Josh Akognon was signed as primary point guard. On December 9, Broadus was fired. On December 28, Clevin Hannah joined the team, along with Laimonas Kisielius. On January 21, Akognon left the team.Lietuvos rytas qualified to the Eurocup Top16 phase with a 3-5 record, in large part due to incredible efforts from Drew Gordon, David Logan and the rising Artūras Gudaitis. Many troubles started {{before the start of the}} Top16, as Gudaitis and Gailius suffered injuries. Rytas lost a very close game to Hapoel Jerusalem at the start in Vilnius, losing 76:80 in a game Rytas led by as much as 20 points, with the fans and coaching staff blaming the referees after the game. In the second round, Rytas lost to BC Zenit Saint Petersburg 79:88 in an away game, though fought hard and erased a bigger deficit before the end. In the next two weeks, Rytas faced BC Nizhny Novgorod, blowing out their opponents both times - 97:63 away, and 99:73 at home, with chances to reach the playoffs returning. After a tough game, and a loss, to Hapoel in Jerusalem 77:84, Rytas faced Zenit at home - David Logan scored 28 points in the deciding game, with Rytas winning 86:84, but just narrowly missing the playoffs, as Zenit won the first game by 9 points. After the failure to progress into the EuroCup Playoffs club announced addition of guard Jimmy Baron from local rivals Neptūnas. On February 10, Tomas Pačėsas decided to leave the club and was replaced by Rimas Kurtinaitis, who coached Rytas to most of its titles previously. The coaching change, however, did not save Rytas from one of the most shocking losses in the season - in the first round of the King Mindaugas Cup, Rytas, the defending champion, lost to BC Juventus 84:87. The loss also became the last game of David Logan, who after weeks of rumors left to sign with Sidigas Avellino. On 25 February, club signed a contract with forward Taylor Brown from the Polish Basketball League. In the LKL, with coach Pačėsas, the team fell to third place for much of the season, only getting second place by the last weeks in the regular season under coach Kurtinaitis. Rytas split the season series with new rivals BC Neptūnas, and with the rising BC Lietkabelis team. Against Žalgiris, however, this was not the case - Žalgiris swept the season series in a decisive manner. In the LKL playoffs, Rytas faced, and swept BC Pieno žvaigždės in the quaterfinals 3:0. In the semifinal, Rytas faced Lietkabelis - in the regular season, both teams won at home, and fought for the second place and home court advantage, which Rytas won at the last game in Vilnius 92:60. Considered a fovorite, Rytas won the first game 96:85 in Vilnius, a game with many conflicts between both teams, in particular Drew Gordon and Lietkabelis forward Žygimantas Skučas. In the second game, Rytas lost in Panevėžys 73:90. With the series tied at 1:1, Rytas was the favorite heading in the third game in Vilnius - Lietkabelis had never won in Vilnius before. However, a shock happened - Rytas lost 73:81, and was down 1:2 in the series. Heading to Panevėžys, internal teams arose with the team in regards with discipline violations by Taylor Brown, Corey Fisher and Clevin Hannah, though no actions were taken by the team until after the series - the three players, along with Drew Gordon, were suspended for the rest of the season. All of them were denying the fact but the incontestable pictures were published, which shattered all the doubts. In Panevėžys, Rytas lost 77:86 and lost the series 1:3. This fiasco also meant that Rytas didn't qualify for the LKL finals for the second time in a row - first time in history this has happened. In the bronze medal series, Rytas faced BC Neptūnas, who was now considered the favorite due to problems internally in Rytas. Rytas started the series with a 79:60 win in Vilnius, to shut up all critics. After losing in Klaipėda 70:83, Rytas won the third game in Vilnius 71:54, again taking a series lead. The last two games were thrillers - lead by Chris Lofton, Neptūnas tied the series in Klaipėda at 2:2 apiece with a 70:65 win, leading to a decisive Game 5 in the next few days.
