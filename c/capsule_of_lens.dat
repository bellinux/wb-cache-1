40|$|AIM: To {{investigate}} the infection factors, {{diagnosis and treatment}} of endophthalmitis after intraocular foreign body injury. METHODS: Totally 256 cases with intraocular foreign bodies including the occurrence of endophthalmitis in 42 cases were analyzed retrospectively. RESULTS: The incidence of endophthalmitis after intraocular foreign body injury was 16. 4 %. Posterior segment foreign bodies and combined with traumatic cataract were the risk factors of endophthalmitis after intraocular foreign body injury(all P P P > 0. 05). Vitrectomy was the main treatment of endophthalmitis. CONCLUSION: Posterior segment foreign bodies and combined with traumatic cataract were the risk factors of endophthalmitis after intraocular foreign body injury. It should be kept the integrity of the posterior <b>capsule</b> <b>of</b> <b>lens</b> in traumatic cataract surgery. Intravitreal injection of vancomycin and ceftazidime is recommended in emergency surgery. Vitrectomy should be performed as soon as possible when confirmed endophthalmitis...|$|E

40|$|Purpose: To {{investigate}} {{the influence of}} carbohydrate metabolism on the structure and mechanical properties <b>of</b> the <b>lens</b> capsule and nucleus. Methods: Human lens pathology was studied in different forms of cataract. 220 patients with a cataract (220 eyes) were included in this study. Morphological, immunohystological and immunocytochemical investigations <b>of</b> <b>lens</b> substance (antibodies to a- (a-А and a-В), b-, g- crystallines), spectroscopic analyses of smears and morphometric analyses of slices, investigation <b>of</b> <b>lens</b> morphology and mechanical caracteristics <b>of</b> <b>lens</b> <b>capsule</b> and lens nucleus were performed. Results: The <b>capsule</b> <b>of</b> the <b>lens</b> in patients with senile cataract contains more Na+, Cl-. The <b>capsule</b> <b>of</b> the <b>lens</b> in patients with senile cataract contains more Ca 2 +, O. Mechanical strength <b>of</b> the <b>capsule</b> {{in the case of}} diabetes mellitus was lower comparatively with senile cataract in the same age groups. More significant expression of a-В and b-crystallines was found in patients with diabetes mellitus comparatively with patients with age-related cataract. Morphological features were founded in patients with cortical and nuclear forms of senile cataract and the diabetic cataract. Conclusion: During surgery (ultrasonic microcoaxial phacoemulsification) the equivalent of ultrasound was recorded. Lower density of the <b>lens</b> nucleus <b>of</b> patients with diabetes mellitus made it possible to use lower energy parameters. Using the torsion ultrasound in those cases allowed us to decrease the influence of ultrasound on eye tissues and reduce the time of achieving the maximum BCVA in the postsurgical period. </p...|$|R

40|$|Objective. Lens osmotic expansion, {{provoked}} by overactivated aldose reductase (AR), {{is the most}} essential event of sugar cataract. Chloride channel 3 (Clcn 3) is a volume-sensitive channel, mainly participating in the regulation of cell fundamental volume, and P-glycoprotein (P-gp) acts as its modulator. We aim to study whether P-gp and Clcn 3 are involved in <b>lens</b> osmotic expansion <b>of</b> galactosemic cataract. Methods and Results. In vitro, lens epithelial cells (LECs) were primarily cultured in gradient galactose medium (10 – 60 [*]mM), more and more vacuoles appeared in LEC cytoplasm, and mRNA and protein levels of AR, P-gp, and Clcn 3 were synchronously upregulated along {{with the increase of}} galactose concentration. In vivo, we focused on the early stage of rat galactosemic cataract, amount of vacuoles arose from equatorial area and scattered to the whole anterior <b>capsule</b> <b>of</b> <b>lenses</b> from the 3 rd day to the 9 th day, and mRNA and protein levels of P-gp and Clcn 3 reached the peak around the 9 th or 12 th day.

50|$|In {{order to}} remove a {{cataract}} with modern techniques, the <b>capsule</b> <b>of</b> the <b>lens</b> must be opened. In older style surgery (intracapsular cataract extraction), the whole lens and capsule was removed. This was done to prevent the inflammatory response to leftover lens material. Since it was all removed en-bloc, there was no residual. With modern techniques, however, the removal of practically all the material can be achieved while leaving the intact capsule. This is important since it provides a barrier between {{the front and back}} of the eye, and prevents the vitreous from moving forwards. In addition, this allows the artificial intraocular lens an ideal place to be located in the eye, away from contact with other structures yet solidly held in place.|$|R
40|$|Background: This is a theoretical and {{experimental}} study of the thermomechanical effects of laser radiation with a wavelength of 1. 06 microns on the eye tissues during a laser surgery on the secondary cataract (pupillary membrane). Its relevance {{is related to the}} rates of complications after laser surgery of the eye associated with the choice of energy and time parameters of the laser irradiation. These parameters are related to the occurrence of such factors as unstable fields of thermal stress and pressure that are difficult to take into account and indirectly lead to adverse events when removing the secondary cataract. Aim: To minimize side effects and to optimize the existing technology of laser removal of the secondary cataract. Materials and methods: Samples <b>of</b> a  normal <b>lens</b> <b>capsule</b> and <b>of</b> <b>lens</b> <b>capsules</b> with various types of opacities taken during a  cataract surgery, with various optic characteristics and thickness, were treated with an infrared laser (Nd:YAG laser, 1064 nm). We performed morphometric measurements and built up a  theoretical model of the processes in a continuous medium under the effects of impulse laser irradiation. Results: The results of numerical modelling with this newly developed theoretical model are in satisfactory agreement with the experimental data on development of deformities obtained with the autopsy materials (posterior <b>capsule</b> <b>of</b> the human <b>lens</b> with various optical characteristics and thickness, from thin transparent membranes to more thick opaque samples).

40|$|Abstract Background One {{approach}} to resolving {{some of the}} in vivo functions of alpha-crystallin is to generate animal models where {{one or both of}} the alpha-crystallin gene products have been eliminated. In the single alpha-crystallin knockout mice, the remaining alpha-crystallin may fully or partially compensate for some of the functions of the missing protein, especially in the lens, where both alphaA and alphaB are normally expressed at high levels. The purpose of this study was to characterize gross lenticular morphology in normal mice and mice with the targeted disruption of alphaA- and alphaB-crystallin genes (alphaA/BKO). Methods Lenses from 129 SvEvTac mice and alphaA/BKO mice were examined by standard scanning electron microscopy and confocal microscopy methodologies. Results Equatorial and axial (sagittal) dimensions <b>of</b> <b>lenses</b> for alphaA/BKO mice were significantly smaller than age-matched wild type lenses. No posterior sutures or fiber cells extending to the posterior <b>capsule</b> <b>of</b> the <b>lens</b> were found in alphaA/BKO lenses. Ectopical nucleic acid staining was observed in the posterior subcapsular region of 5 wk and anterior subcapsular cortex of 54 wk alphaA/BKO lenses. Gross morphological differences were also observed in the equatorial/bow, posterior and anterior regions <b>of</b> <b>lenses</b> from alphaA/BKO mice as compared to wild mice. Conclusion These results indicated that both alphaA- and alphaB-crystallin are necessary for proper fiber cell formation, and that the absence of alpha-crystallin can lead to cataract formation. </p...|$|R

50|$|Cataract is an opacity in the <b>lens</b> <b>of</b> the eye. The {{normal lens}} allows light {{to reach the}} retina. When it becomes opaque and does not allow light to reach the retina, {{we are unable to}} see clearly. To {{understand}} cataract better, imagine photographing through a camera with grease smeared onto its lens. In such a case, the image formed is very hazy and blurred. Similar to grease smearing onto the <b>lens</b> <b>of</b> a camera, if the <b>lens</b> <b>of</b> the eye gets opaque, the image formed on the retina will be blurred and one will not see clearly. There is no medical treatment for cataract. The only treatment is surgery. When a person has a cataract and the decision is made to operate, then the diseased lens is removed and replaced by an artificial lens called an Intraocular lens or IOL. Once the cataract lens is removed, there is no focusing ability of the eye as there is no lens in the eye. So one has to use the IOL to get the object focused onto the retina. For an intraocular lens to be placed in the eye one needs some support which is given by the <b>capsule</b> <b>of</b> the <b>lens</b> which is left behind. But in some cases there is no capsule and in such cases the alternative is to fix a glued IOL (Fig 2). The other alternative is to suture the IOL to the eye or fix it in some other place like an anterior chamber IOL.|$|R

In {{anterior}} polar cataracts and the fibrosis {{that can}} occur after cataract surgery, lens epithelial cells synthesize abundant extracellular matrix molecules and transdifferentiate into myofibroblast-like cells. Transforming growth factor (TGF) - � has been implicated as {{a key player in}} these cataractous changes. The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine whether the TGF-�– inducible gene h 3 (�ig-h 3) is expressed in lens epithelial cells from patients with anterior polar cataracts and to test whether �ig-h 3 is induced by TGF- � in cultured lens epithelial cells. METHODS. Lens epithelial cells attached to the anterior <b>capsules</b> <b>of</b> human cataractous <b>lenses</b> and noncataractous lenses were examined for the expression of �ig-h 3 mRNA and protein using reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemical analyses. The effect of TGF-� on �ig-h 3 gene expression was also tested in human lens epithelial B- 3 cells using Northern and Western blot analyses. RESULTS. �ig-h 3 mRNA was not detected in lens epithelial cells from patients with clear lenses or patients with nuclear cataracts. Significant expression of mRNA for �ig-h 3 was observed in lens epithelial cells from patients with anterior polar cataracts. Immunohistochemical analysis using anti–�ig-h 3 antiserum indicated that �ig-h 3 protein was present within the subcapsular plaques o...|$|R
