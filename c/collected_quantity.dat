The construction of partitions is partially based on the sweep algorithm, where the relative geographic position of nodes is determined by their polar coordinate angles. A penalty function is used to quantify if a solution is well balanced. Furthermore a cluster penalty promotes the connectivity of the arcs within their vehicle cone. The algorithm is applied to the municipality of Glabbeek in order to produce street clusters for waste collection that are balanced with regard to service time and <b>collected</b> <b>quantity.</b> status: publishe...|$|E

To assess their applicability to the control of atmospheric contamination, polytetraethylene (teflon) electrets are exposed to vapors coming from volatile mixtures over periods up to 90 min. Use is made of mass spectrometry for the analysis of teflon electret characteristics. It is found that even small quantities of the liquids in the mixture gives its characteristic mass spectra and that the peak height represents a measure for the quantity of the material collected over the electret surface, with the <b>collected</b> <b>quantity</b> being proportional to the duration of exposure...|$|E
40|$|International audienceWe {{examine a}} reverse supply chain {{consisting}} of a collection site, where consumers return used products, and a remanufacturing facility. Some of the returned products are transported to the remanufacturing facility {{in order to be}} remanufactured and used to satisfy the stochastic demand for remanufactured products. The quality of returns is characterized by uncertainty, and therefore, before the procurement quantity determination, the remanufacturer has the alternative to inspect a sample drawn from the <b>collected</b> <b>quantity</b> in order to evaluate more accurately returns' quality. Using general assumptions for returns quality and remanufactured products demand distributions, we formulate the expected profit function for both sampling and no-sampling cases and we examine numerically the economic effectiveness of sampling. A key characteristic of the current paper is that returns' yield is expressed as the probability of a unit to be remanufacturable...|$|E

40|$|We study a {{closed-loop}} {{supply chain}} involving a manufacturing facility and a remanufacturing facility. The manufacturer satisfies stochastic market demand by remanufacturing the used product into “as-new” one and producing new products from raw {{material in the}} remanufacturing facility and the manufacturing facility, respectively. The remanufacturing cost depends {{on the quality of}} used product. The problem is maximizing the manufacturer’s expected profit by jointly determining the <b>collected</b> <b>quantity</b> of used product and the ordered quantity of raw material. Following that we analyze the model with a fill rate constraint and a budget constraint separately and then with both the constraints. Next, to handle the imprecise nature of some parameters of the model, we develop the model with both constraints in bifuzzy environment. Finally numerical examples are presented to illustrate the models. The sensitivity analysis is also conducted to generate managerial insight...|$|E
40|$|In this study, we {{investigate}} a complex situation in designing a raw material collection system, which involves collectionstation location, supplier selection, supplier–collection allocation, and transporation decisions. In a raw material collectionsystem, a collector has to collect more raw material quantity {{in order to}} get higher income as the price of raw material isquantity dependent. The more suppliers visit, the more income receives; however, when a collector decides to visit moresuppliers, traveling distance will be longer, which will result in higher transportation costs. We formulate a Mixed IntegerProgramming for a location routing with setp–price policy model to find the optimal solution. The basic trade–off of theproposed model is between revenue received from totally <b>collected</b> <b>quantity</b> and total costs both fixed costs and variablecosts from expanding the collection area. Instances which are created according to real–life data are applied to test theproposed model. The computational results indicate that the complex raw material collcetion system can be obtained by theproposed mathethical model. The mathematical model gives the benefit for the use of determining the optimum raw materialcollection system with profit maximization. The results can be used for setting up a real raw material collection system...|$|E
40|$|The {{collection}} {{of hazardous waste}} from the household around Swedish municipalities varies. 1 % of the households waste is hazardous waste. It has hazardous features that can give bad consequences for the nature and human health if we don’t collect it and treat it. Therefore the law controls it, the municipalities have responsibility for the household waste. The municipalities are supposed to raising it and treating it, even if the producers have responsibility {{for some kind of}} hazardous waste.   Common systems that municipalities use are:   Recycling centre Hazardous waste collection point Collection at the gate Clean vehicle Collection at house by a caretaker Collection at shopping centre   Kalmarsundsregionens renhållare wants to increase the quantity by increasing the collection. The systems that Swedish municipalities use for hazardous waste from households have therefore been evaluated. The systems have been investigated in regard to the security, how useable they are for clients and above all what quantity of waste it gives. There seams not to be an ultimate system that can fill all the criterions.

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the influence of}} some climate elements on the collected quantities of two commercially most significant types of mushrooms in Serbia (porcini and chanterelle). The main objective of the research {{is to determine the}} extent of the <b>collected</b> <b>quantity</b> of porcini and chanterelle, which can be expected in different scenarios of climate change (А 1 Bmin, А 1 Bmax, A 2 min и A 2 max), based on forecasts of temperature and rainfall changes. The general (dialectical) and specific (modelling methods) are used in the research, as well as the classical scientific methods of reasoning. The calculation of the average annual exponential growth rate (IS) was carried out by forming exponential regression models of the trend of porcini and chanterelle collected quantities. In the research it was found that, according to the data related to the period up to 2014, one can expect a decrease in the movement of both porcini and chanterelle IS, and thus a decrease in the collected quantities. On the other hand, according to the data related to the period up to 2040, in both cases one can expect some fluctuation (increase and decrease) in the movement of IS. According to the data related to periods after 2041 (especially for the period until 2100), in both cases, one can expect a decrease in the collected quantities, as a result of changes in T and P, caused by the assumed climate change...|$|E
40|$|This Master's degree work {{discusses}} {{possibilities of}} implementing new waste treatment billing system known as PAYT (Pay As You Throw), that enables charging based on actually <b>collected</b> <b>quantity</b> of waste. Thus {{the system of}} covering waste treatment costs is adapted to the principle »POLUTERS PAY« as close as possible. We have analyzed the working process of Municipal Public Company, responsible for waste management {{in the area of}} 5 Communities in central part of Slovenia. The emphasis of analytic procedure has been put on Waste Treatment Cost Structure. We have determined the costs that are inevitable for working process, but not influenced by the quantity of collected waste. The values of fixed and variable costs are a basis for Basic Charge and Service Charges (price depending on number of waste bin collections per month) for waste treatment. Procedure for identification of collected bins is enabled by using RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) data collection system. Identification is basic requirement for introducing collection measurement or weighing of collected waste in waste collection process. RFID transponder is installed in waste collection bin. RFID reader installed on Refuse Collection Vehicle reads and transmits the transponder serial numbers. The tag data, combined with the time and GPS data (+ weight in weighing option) is recorded to the process unit in RCV. RFID data logs can be automatically downloaded from the process unit to designated servers in Municipal company. There the transponder ID is connected with user data and this is basis for PAYT billing...|$|E

Everyone thought ones dishonesty would be lost before the huge face of honesty but that did not materialize. When everyone thinks he is doing the best and others are doing nothing, that collective intention is bound to doom and where everyone thinks, I am worst and I must excel and out perform the best in class, that collective intention is bound to be positive and help the present and future.
