25|$|Räikkönen and Pérez, running 4th and 5th having {{started on}} the soft tyres both had a long first stint {{as they tried to}} make the race on a single stop. With Webber being held up behind the duo, this allowed both Grosjean and Nico Rosberg to close up on him. Rosberg made his second stop on lap 40, one lap before Räikkönen made his only stop. Räikkönen rejoined in front of Rosberg, but Rosberg was able to pass him in the DRS zone on the same lap, just as Hamilton did on Alonso earlier. Pérez made his stop on lap 42 and rejoined in between the duo, in 8th place. Michael Schumacher's run of bad luck {{continued}} when he left the pits on lap 43 with his DRS flap open was running 9th. He returned to the pits but the team were unable to <b>close</b> <b>the</b> <b>flap,</b> forcing his retirement.|$|E
50|$|The Smock, Windproof, DPM (or, DPM Windproof Smock) {{was issued}} {{alongside}} the standard DPM Combat Jackets by the British Army. The Special Air Service Regiment {{was the first}} unit to adopt its own design of DPM Windproof Smock which it wore in preference to the 68 Pattern and later combat jackets. Aside from being made from a windproof material, it differed from the standard combat jackets in being cut to fit more loosely, allowing it to fit over other layers of clothing more easily, and in having an integral hood. Where the standard jackets were closed by a full-length zipper, covered by a buttoned flap, and buttoned cuffs, the windproof smock used velcro to <b>close</b> <b>the</b> <b>flap</b> over the zipper and to fasten the cuffs. The buttons fitted to the Windproof Smock (on the four, expanding front pockets, and the small arm pocket for the First Field Dressing) were all of an overlarge type, to ease use by cold or gloved fingers.|$|E
40|$|Cheek {{rotation}} flaps 1 - 3 {{are used}} to reconstruct lower eyelids. After rotating the flap, the suture line on the cheek is not aligned with a relaxed skin tension line, and postoperative scars that intersect {{the margin of the}} lower eyelid at angles close to 90 ˚ may cause downward contractures of the lower eyelid. We describe herein 2 cases in which we avoided this problem by using w-plasty when suturing the cheek rotation flaps to the remaining eyelid and cheek skin in reconstructions, following Meibomian adenocarcinoma resections. Case 1 : The Mustardé method was used to reconstruct the left upper eyelid of a 74 year-old woman after a Meibomian adenocarcinoma was resected. Two weeks after the first operation, the switch flap was detached and w-plasty was performed to <b>close</b> <b>the</b> <b>flap</b> donor site. Two years postoperatively, there was no pronounced scarring and the lower lid had not evinced any contractures due to the suture line (Fig 1). Figure 1.

50|$|The {{lower part}} of the bow of the vessel, instead of being made solid as usual, is {{composed}} of two iron flaps, each hinged at the top, as shown in Figs. 1 and 2. When <b>closed,</b> <b>the</b> outer surfaces of these <b>flaps</b> correspond to <b>the</b> general shape of the bow, and, when the torpedo machinery is not being worked, they are kept down in their places by means of chains attached to them near their lower edges, and passing in through a pair of hawsepipes situated between <b>the</b> <b>flaps.</b> Each chain, after entering its hawsepipe, is attached to an iron rod, these rods passing into the vessel through stuffing-boxes at the inner ends of the hawsepipes. From the inner ends of these rods chains are led, over guide pulleys, to the ends of a winch, situated as shown in Figs. 2 and 3, and by means of this winch, which is worked by hand, <b>the</b> <b>flaps</b> can be <b>closed</b> when required. <b>The</b> opening of <b>the</b> <b>flaps</b> is effected by the arrangements shown in Figs. 1 and 4, from which it will be seen that each flap has a chain attached to its outside, and that these chains, after being led up over guide pulleys supported by brackets placed {{at the level of the}} gunwale, are crossed and then led down through hawseholes in the deck to the winch below.

40|$|The {{significance}} of {{three types of}} design modifications in view of defining passive means to extend the stability bounds of modern wind turbines is assessed in this paper. The first concerns the use of optimized airfoil shapes on a fixed blade planform while the other two concern the increase of structural flexibility by either bringing <b>closer</b> <b>the</b> <b>flap</b> and lead-lag mode frequencies or introducing a soft yaw connection. Such {{an exploration of the}} stability envelope aims at providing the necessary understanding of the mechanisms that control aeroelastic damping and therefore at identifying means for improving the stability behaviour of the lowest damped system modes. Stability calculations are performed in the context of linear eigenvalue analysis using a state-of-the-art stability tool. The model accounts for the full wind turbine configuration and the eigenvalue problem is formulated with reference to the non-rotating (ground-fixed) frame of reference through the multi-blade transformation of all the rotating degrees of freedom. Results are presented in reference to a commercial multi-MW, pitch-regulated, variable-speed wind turbine. They indicate that the soft yaw concept offers more significant margins of improvement compared with the flap-lag coincidence, while aerodynamic optimization could be a basis for improvement.

50|$|The {{most common}} serious {{complication}} {{of a free}} flap is loss of the venous outflow (e.g. a clot forms in the vein that drains the blood from <b>the</b> <b>flap).</b> Loss of arterial supply is serious too and both will cause necrosis (death) of <b>the</b> <b>flap.</b> <b>Close</b> monitoring of <b>the</b> <b>flap</b> both by nurses and by the surgeon is mandatory following {{the completion of the}} operation.

The {{purpose of this study}} is to introduce reconstruction using a combination of a buccinator myomucosal flap and a buccal fat pad flap after cancer excision and to discuss the associated anatomy, surgical procedure, and clinical applications. MethodsIn our study, a combination of a buccinator myomucosal flap with a buccal fat pad flap was utilized for reconstruction after resection of oropharyngeal cancer, performed between 2013 and 2015. After oropharyngectomy, the defect with exposed vital structures was noted. A buccinator myomucosal flap was designed and elevated after an assessment of <b>the</b> <b>flap</b> pedicle. Without requiring an additional procedure, a buccal fat pad flap was easily harvested in the same field and gently pulled to obtain sufficient volume. <b>The</b> <b>flaps</b> were rotated and covered the defect. In addition, using cadaver dissections, we investigated the feasibility of transposing <b>the</b> <b>flaps</b> into <b>the</b> lateral oropharyngeal defect. ResultsThe reconstruction was performed in patients with squamous cell carcinoma. The largest tumor size was 5 cm× 2 cm (length×width). All donor sites were <b>closed</b> primarily. <b>The</b> <b>flaps</b> were completely epithelialized after four weeks, and the patients were followed up for at least six months. There were no flap failures or postoperative wound complications. All patients were without dietary restrictions, and no patient had problems related to mouth opening, swallowing, or speech.
