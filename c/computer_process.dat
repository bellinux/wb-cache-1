50|$|The {{observer}} effect {{could either}} {{have a positive}} or {{negative impact on the}} <b>computer</b> <b>process</b> behaviour. A positive impact can be software bugs, also known as Heisenbugs, which diminish or change their negative behavior when observation mechanisms, such as debugging, are enabled.

50|$|In {{information}} technology, {{the observer}} effect {{is the impact}} on the behaviour of a <b>computer</b> <b>process</b> caused by the act of observing the process while it is running.

50|$|Grid-tie {{inverters}} include conventional low-frequency types {{with transformer}} coupling, newer high-frequency types, also with transformer coupling, and transformerless types.

50|$|On many {{computer}} operating systems, a <b>computer</b> <b>process</b> terminates its execution {{by making}} an exit system call.

50|$|A {{key part}} of this {{analysis}} is the contention that one dimension of the social domain-tracking the illocutionary status of the transaction (whether individual participants claim that their interests have been met, or not) is very readily conferred to a <b>computer</b> <b>process,</b> {{regardless of whether the}} computer has the means to adequately represent the real world issues underlying that claim. Thus a computer instantiating the 'conversation for action' has the useful ability to model the status of the current social reality independent of any external reality on which social claims may be based.|$|E

The results are returned electronically to the remote locations and form the basis for patient treatment there.

5000|$|Machine-generated data is {{information}} automatically {{generated by a}} <b>computer</b> <b>process,</b> application, or other mechanism without the active intervention of a human. While the term dates back over fifty years, there is some current indecision as to {{the scope of the}} term. Monash Research's Curt Monash defines it as [...] "data that was produced entirely by machines OR data that is more about observing humans than recording their choices." [...] Meanwhile, Daniel Abadi, CS Professor at Yale, proposes a narrower definition, [...] "Machine-generated data is data that is generated {{as a result of a}} decision of an independent computational agent or a measurement of an event that is not caused by a human action." [...] Regardless of definition differences, both exclude data manually entered by a person. Machine-generated data crosses all industry sectors. Often and increasingly, humans are unaware their actions are generating the data.|$|E
5000|$|The Storm botnet's systems {{also take}} steps to defend itself locally, on victims' {{computer}} systems. The botnet, on some compromised systems, creates a <b>computer</b> <b>process</b> on the Windows machine that notifies the Storm systems whenever a new program or other processes begin. Previously, the Storm worms locally would tell the other programs — such as anti-virus, or anti-malware software, to simply not run. However, according to IBM security research, versions of Storm also now simply [...] "fool" [...] the local computer system to run the hostile program successfully, but in fact, they are not doing anything. [...] "Programs, including not just AV exes, dlls and sys files, but also software such as the P2P applications BearShare and eDonkey, will appear to run successfully, even though they didn't actually do anything, which is far less suspicious than a process that gets terminated suddenly from the outside," [...] said Richard Cohen of Sophos. Compromised users, and related security systems, will assume that security software is running successfully when it in fact is not.|$|E
