40|$|Since the {{rediscovery of}} the role of mites in {{provoking}} house-dust allergies (VOORHORST et al. 1964) more {{attention has been paid to}} the mite fauna of house dusts of different geographical areas. Blomia has been found in house dust in Taipei (Taiwan) and Paramaribo (Surinam), some times in large numbers (OSHIMA 1970, BRONSWIJK 1972). Allergological investigations (MIYAMOTO et al. r 969) showed a <b>cross</b> <b>antigenicity</b> with Dermatophagoides farinae Hughes 1961 indicating that Blomia could be important in the house-dust allergy problem in Japan. Taxonomical investigations revealed that a not yet described species Blomia tropicalis sp. n. is involved...|$|E
40|$|Serial assay of fibrin {{degradation}} products (FDPs) {{was used to}} monitor fibrinolytic activity in blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) after subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH) in 64 patients, 43 of whom had aneurysms. CSF levels fell rapidly from high initial values over a few days, thereafter more slowly to reach normal levels after one to six weeks. Probably only the later slow decline {{is a measure of}} fibrinolysis, which is obscured in the first few days by the <b>cross</b> <b>antigenicity</b> with FDP's of fibrinogen released by the bleed. After this phase of fibrinogen clearance, early attainment of normal FDP levels appears to be associated with a lower risk of rebleeding in cases of aneurysm. This phenomenon could be useful in deciding whether marginal cases should be treated surgically or conservatively...|$|E
40|$|In vivo {{skin testing}} and in vitro {{lymphocyte}} blastogenesis were evaluated {{in a young}} adult population as methods for detecting cellular immunity to Sporotrichum schenckii. Similar procedures for Candida albicans and Coccidioides immitis were also investigated. 5 of 143 subjects had positive skin tests and 14 had positive blastogenic responses to S. schenckii. These 14 subjects also exhibited unusually high responses to C. albicans in vitro and 11 of the 14 were female. Data demonstrated a correlation coefficient of 0. 89 when comparing the blastogenic assays for S. schenckii and C. albicans, suggesting <b>cross</b> <b>antigenicity.</b> Intact cellular immune mechanisms in combination with exposure to C. albicans may protect the host from systemic infection with S. schenckii. Although {{a limited number of}} subjects were studied, as a group, females had more vigorous cellular immune responses to C. albicans than males. The rare occurence of sporothrix infection in females as compared to males {{may be the result of}} antigenic stimulation from commonly observed vaginal colonization with C. albicans. The present data indirectly support this hypothesis...|$|E
40|$|To know a {{difference}} in the immune responses between the lung and the kindly allo-transplantation, the humoral and cell bound antibody levels were compared by means of cytotoxic assay (CA) and Immune hemoagglutination (IA) test in dogs. 1) The humoral antibody levels were increased five to 10 days prior to appearance of rejection following lung transplantation in spite of maintaining relatively low levels in the course although it was different from kidney one. 2) On the other hand, the cell bound antibody levels were not increased in accordance with the rejection response at lung transplantation. Meanwhile, renal transplantation made the cell antibody levels higher with time in the humoral antibody levels, although cell-bound antibody levels were increased on day five to seven with a seven day maximum, thereafter gradually decreased to some extent. It is of considerable interest that a high humornal antibody levels had a close relation to death. 3) The administration of the antilymphocyte serum (ALS) was effective in suppressing the immune response showing the low humoral antibody levels and improved survival period. 4) Skin transplantation prior to lung or kidney transplantation kept high antibody titers on and after day four lung transplantation and on day seven to 10 at kidney. Conclusion was drawn from this study that skin and lung or kidney have the common <b>cross</b> reacting <b>antigenicity</b> to organ transplantation, in particular, the lung has a strong <b>cross</b> reacting <b>antigenicity</b> to the skin rather than the kidney...|$|R
30|$|These {{essential}} demonstrations indicate <b>cross</b> reactivity, strong <b>antigenicity</b> by conserved domains especially V 3, antibody response {{against them}} and generation of anti-HIV- 2 [*]V 3 mouse MAbs i.e. 3 C 4 and 7 C 8. Also the difference in signal transduction in HIVs, gag specific T-cell responses and dimerisation defective HIV- 2 (deficient in maturity and infectivity) give minute details about HIV- 2 which can prove stepping stones while aiming it and AIDS. But these essentials alone can’t be sufficient, as some novel strategic effort which can use the above facts in a quicker way for rapid prediction of vaccine, is the need of the hour.|$|R
40|$|Four {{kinds of}} Dirofilaria immitis antigens, {{prepared}} from intrauterine micro-filariae (I-Mf), circulating microfilariae (C-Mf), migrating larvae and adult worms (A-Di), were assessed by indirect hemagglutination (IHA) test {{in terms of}} immunological specificity and sensitivity. The highest specificity and sensitivity were observed in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) extract of I-Mf among these antigens. In contrast, PBS extract of C-Mf {{was found to have}} extremely low IHA <b>antigenicity.</b> <b>Cross</b> reactions between D. immitis and some intestinal parasites, such as Toxocara canis, Ancylostoma caninum and Trichuris vulpis, were evaluated by agglutinin absorption assay. It was revealed that no substantial cross reaction was present between I-Mf or A-Di and the above three intestinal parasites. Agglutinin absorption assay also suggested that the antigenicity of A-Di antigen differed from that of I-Mf antigen, although some common antigens were present between them. The present results indicate that I-Mf antigen is useful for IHA test in D. immitis infection in dogs...|$|R
40|$|Indirect {{immunofluorescence}} {{of certain}} human sera demonstrated an antigen(s) in the cytoplasm of 1 [...] 5 % {{of the cells}} of a T-cell line, MT- 1, from a patient with adult T-cell leukemia (ATL), which is endemic in southwestern Japan. The antigen was not detected in other human lymphoid cell lines, including six T-cell lines, seven B-cell lines, and four non-T non-B cell lines. The antigen did not show <b>cross</b> <b>antigenicity</b> with that of herpesviruses, including Epstein [...] Barr virus, herpes simplex virus, cytomegalovirus, varicella-zoster virus, herpesvirus saimiri, and Marek disease virus. The proportion of antigen-bearing cells was increased {{by a factor of}} approximately 5 on culture in the presence of 5 -iodo- 2 '-deoxyuridine. Antibodies against the antigen in MT- 1 cells were found in all 44 patients with ATL examined and in 32 of 40 patients with malignant T-cell lymphomas (most of them had diseases similar to ATL except that leukemic cells were not found in the peripheral blood). The antibodies were also detected in 26 % of the healthy adults examined from ATL-endemic areas but in only a few of those examined from ATL-non-endemic areas. On electron microscopy, extracellular type C virus particles were detected in pelleted MT- 1 cells cultured in the presence of 5 -iodo- 2 '-deoxyuridine...|$|E
40|$|Background: <b>Cross</b> <b>antigenicity</b> is {{the major}} problem in {{developing}} a reliable tool for immunodiagnosis and immunoprophylaxis of parasitic diseases. Mixed infection due to different types of gastrointestinal parasites is more common than single species infection under field condition. Methods: The present study was undertaken to detect antigenic cross-reactivity among Haemonchus contortus, Oesophagostomum columbianum and Trichuris ovis of goats by SDS-PAGE and western blot analysis using hyperimmune sera (HIS) rose in rabbit separately against the antigens of the three nematode species. Results: Thirteen, 16 and 14 polypeptides in crude somatic antigen (CSAg) of H. contortus (CSAg-Hc), O. columbianum (CSAg-Oc) and T. ovis (CSAg-To), respectively, were resolved in SDS PAGE analyses. It was revealed that 54 kDa peptide was shared by H. contortus and O. columbianum, whereas 47 kDa peptide was shared by O. columbianum and T. ovis. Western blot analyses revealed that three immunogenic polypeptides (MW 54, 49 and 42 kDa) in CSAg-Hc, five in CSAg-Oc (54, 47, 44, 38 and 35. 5 kDa) and CSAg-To and five polypeptides (90, 51, 47, 39. 5 and 31 kDa) in CSAg-To cross-reacted with the heterologous HIS. Four species-specific immunoreactive polypeptides (92, 85, 65 and 39 kDa) of H. contortus and two (72 & 26 kDa) in O. columbianum were also identified in the study.   Conclusion: The shared polypeptides and species-specific polypeptides might be evaluated as protective antigen and subsequently exploitation for developing immunodiagnostic and for immunoprophylactic tools of for these common nematode species.  </p...|$|E
40|$|A turkey {{coronavirus}} (TCV) isolate {{associated with}} turkey poults with acute enteritis was identified and characterized by morphological, serological, and, molecular properties. Sephacryl S- 1000 size-exclusion chromatography {{was found to}} be a useful method for purification of TCV from turkey embryo intestines. However, results of antibody-capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) coated with TCV antigens prepared from infected intestines were inconsistent. Alternatively, chicken infectious bronchitis coronavirus (IBV) was used as coating antigen for the antibody-capture ELISA based on the observed <b>cross</b> <b>antigenicity</b> between TCV and IBV. The established ELISA system was useful for diagnosis of turkeys infected with TCV as well as for evaluation of specific antibody responses of turkeys following experimental infection. Parameters for turkey lymphocyte proliferation responses to concanavalin A (Con A) were established for evaluation of T cell functional status of turkeys following experimental infection. Both humoral and cellular immunities were activated in turkeys infected with TCV. The humoral immunity was stimulated as indicated by the observations of TCV-specific antibody isotype responses and enhanced antibody response to sheep red blood cells. The cellular immunity was stimulated as indicated by the detection of TCV-specific lymphocyte proliferation response, increased lymphocyte proliferation responses to Con A, and enhanced proportions of CD 4 + cells. Negative correlations between the activations of immune responses and the presence of TCV in the intestine were observed. Experimental suppression of B cell activity by cyclophosphamide enhanced severity of TCV infection. These results indicate that both humoral and cellular immunities of turkeys are activated following infection of turkey poults with TCV and humoral immunity may provide immunological protection for turkey poults against infection with TCV. ...|$|E
40|$|Aim: Oesophagostomum columbianum {{in small}} {{ruminants}} in India is found as mixed infection commonly in sheep and goat. Haemonchus contortus, an abomasal nematode is found as concurrent infection with it. Eggs of Haemonchus and O. columbianum cannot be easily distinguished. Diagnosis of O. columbianum {{may only be}} possible if a non-cross antigenic polypeptide was available for immunodiagnosis. Materials and Methods: Somatic antigen (SoAg) of O. columbianum was fractionated by sodium dodecyl sulfatepolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunodominant polypeptides were identified by western blotting with homologous hyperimmune serum (HIS) and experimental sera of sheep or goat infected with other helminths. Results: SoAg of O. columbianum was immunoaffinity purified. Sharp polypeptide bands of 130, 72 and 68 KDa were observed along with several faint bands of lower molecular weight. Western blot of purified SoAg of O. columbianum with homologous HIS showed reaction with all the protein bands of 17, 28, 30, 32, 35, 38, 50, 68, 100, 130, 150, and 170 kDa. For identification of non-cross antigenic polypeptide, immunoaffinity purified SoAg of O. columbianum was reacted to heterologous HIS against H. contortus, Paramphistomum epiclitum, and Fasciola gigantica in western blotting utilizing completely dry method (i-blot). Among high molecular weight polypeptides 100 and 150 kDa were non-cross antigenic and among low molecular weight except 50 kDa polypeptide, 17, 30, 32, 35, and 38 kDa of O. columbianum were not cross antigenic with other helminths. Conclusions: Hence, polypeptides of 17, 30, 32, 35 and 38 kDa as well as 100 and 150 kDa polypeptides of O. columbianum may be exploited for immunodiagnosis of the infection in sheep and goat with extensive studies on <b>cross</b> <b>antigenicity.</b> ...|$|E
