40|$|Passive scalar {{transport}} in turbulent {{channel flow}} subject to spanwise system rotation is studied by direct numerical simulations. The Reynolds number Re = U_b h/ν is fixed at 20 000 and the rotation number Ro = 2 Ω h/U_b is varied from 0 to 1. 2, where U_b is the bulk mean velocity, h the half channel gap width and Ω the rotation rate. The scalar value is constant but different {{at the two}} walls, leading to steady scalar transport across the channel. The rotation causes an unstable <b>channel</b> <b>side</b> with relatively strong turbulence and turbulent scalar transport, and a stable <b>channel</b> <b>side</b> with relatively weak turbulence or laminar-like flow, weak turbulent scalar transport but large scalar fluctuations and steep mean scalar gradients. The distinct turbulent-laminar patterns observed at certain Ro on the stable <b>channel</b> <b>side</b> induce similar patterns in the scalar gradient field. The main conclusions of the study are that rotation reduces the similarity between the scalar and velocity field and that the Reynolds analogy for scalar-momentum transport does not hold for rotating turbulent channel flow. This is shown by a reduced correlation between velocity and scalar fluctuations, and a strongly reduced turbulent Prandtl number of less than 0. 2 on the unstable <b>channel</b> <b>side</b> {{away from the wall}} at higher Ro. On the unstable <b>channel</b> <b>side,</b> scalar scales become larger than turbulence scales according to spectra and the turbulent scalar flux vector becomes more aligned with the mean scalar gradient owing to rotation.

40|$|Abstract—One of {{the main}} issues {{in the design of}} sensor {{networks}} is energy efficient communication of time-critical data. Energy wastage can be caused by failed packet transmission attempts at each node due to channel dynamics and interference. Therefore transmission control techniques that are unaware of the channel dynamics can lead to suboptimal channel use patterns. In this paper we propose a transmission controller that utilizes different “grades ” of <b>channel</b> <b>side</b> information to schedule packet transmissions in an optimal way, while meeting a deadline constraint for all packets waiting in the transmission queue. The wireless channel is modeled as a finite-state Markov channel. We are specifically interested in the case where the transmitter has low-grade <b>channel</b> <b>side</b> information that can be obtained based solely on the ACK/NAK sequence for the previous transmissions. Our scheduler is readily implementable and {{it is based on the}} dynamic programming solution to the finite-horizon transmission control problem.

Average density and biomass of coho salmon parr were significantly higher in stream-type <b>side</b> <b>channels</b> (3. 4 parr/m 2 and 8. 01 g/m 2, respectively) than in pond-type <b>side</b> <b>channels</b> (0. 8 parr/m 2 and 2. 37 g/m 2). Although total parr biomass was three times higher in stream-type <b>side</b> <b>channels,</b> average parr weight was 47 % lower, suggesting greater density-dependent limitation of growth from higher recruitment of juveniles to stream-type habitats.
