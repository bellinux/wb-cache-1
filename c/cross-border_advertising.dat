The Parliament and Member States are involved in trilogue discussions to reach a common conclusion. In February 2014, the European Parliament approved new regulations for tobacco products, including e-cigarettes. The new regulations forbid advertising of e-cigarettes, set limits on maximum concentrations of nicotine in liquids, limit maximum volumes of liquid that can be sold, require child-proof and tamper-proof packaging of liquid, set requirements on purity of ingredients, require that the devices deliver consistent doses of vapor, require disclosure of ingredients and nicotine content, and empower regulators to act if the regulations are violated. In October 2014 e-cigarette manufacturer Totally Wicked {{won the right to}} challenge the directive at the Court of Justice of the EU. The hearing took place on 1 October 2015 and the results will not be announced until early 2016.|$|E

The difficulties arise because, until now, legal systems have depended {{on the concept of}} sovereignty within defined geographical borders. The Internet has changed all that - truly global markets require a different approach. Is there enough international goodwill for modern society to be able to solve these problems...|$|E

The ban having an effect on <b>cross-border</b> supply of <b>advertising</b> space breached TFEU art 56 on free movement of services, but this could again be justified on grounds of public health.|$|R
40|$|Created in 1933 as {{the first}} {{off-shore}} radio station broadcasting {{in the direction of}} the French territory, then launching its first TV programs in 1955, RTL illustrates, in the area of culture, the importance of the <b>cross-border</b> dimension. Its <b>advertising</b> programs are managed by Information et Publicit√©, a subsidiary of the Havas Agency that settled in Brussels in 1867 and has since become the undisputed leader of the industry. As RTL is listened over a wide area of space that covers a large part of North-Western Europe, Great-Britain included, the people in charge of designing the commercials are prompted, already in the inter-war period, to reflect on the problems raised by the segmentation of the market and the diversity of languages, tastes and consuming habits of their listeners first, then of their viewers. In this area, the reference to America, inescapable though it was, did not bar them from developing original solutions, on a transnational scale. SCOPUS: re. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
