40|$|Aims. To {{investigate}} patients' {{attitudes toward}} <b>complementary</b> and <b>alternative</b> <b>medicine,</b> the education nurses provided about <b>complementary</b> and <b>alternative</b> <b>medicine</b> for treating depression and {{to test whether}} such education mediates the effect of <b>complementary</b> and <b>alternative</b> <b>medicine</b> use and attitudes toward <b>complementary</b> and <b>alternative</b> <b>medicine.</b> Background. Although we know that attitudes influence behaviour, very few studies simultaneously explore the relationship between attitudes, education and <b>complementary</b> and <b>alternative</b> <b>medicine</b> use. Design. Survey. Methods. This study was conducted {{as part of a}} larger survey, using face-to-face survey interviews with 206 adult patients aged 50 years or over and hospitalised in conventional hospitals in Taiwan for treatment of depression. The attitudes toward <b>complementary</b> and <b>alternative</b> <b>medicine</b> and patient education about <b>complementary</b> and <b>alternative</b> <b>medicine</b> instruments were specially developed for the study. Results. Participants expressed slightly favourable attitudes toward <b>complementary</b> and <b>alternative</b> <b>medicine.</b> Many participants (50 %) expressed that they were willing to try any potential treatment for depression. They believed that <b>complementary</b> and <b>alternative</b> <b>medicine</b> helped them to feel better and to live a happier life. However, 66 絥 of participants reported that they had inadequate knowledge of <b>complementary</b> and <b>alternative</b> <b>medicine.</b> Participants with a higher monthly income, longer depression duration and religious beliefs hold more positive attitudes toward <b>complementary</b> and <b>alternative</b> <b>medicine.</b> Most participants were not satisfied with the education they received about <b>complementary</b> and <b>alternative</b> <b>medicine.</b> Patient education about <b>complementary</b> and <b>alternative</b> <b>medicine</b> was found to be a mediator for the use of <b>complementary</b> and <b>alternative</b> <b>medicine.</b> Conclusion. Patient education from nurses may predict patients' attitudes toward <b>complementary</b> and <b>alternative</b> <b>medicine.</b> Continuing nursing education is needed to enable nurses to respond knowledgeably to concerns patients may have about <b>complementary</b> and <b>alternative</b> <b>medicine</b> and treatment options. Relevance to clinical practice. This study highlights the potential role of patient education about <b>complementary</b> and <b>alternative</b> <b>medicine</b> as an effective way of adjusting patients' attitudes toward <b>complementary</b> and <b>alternative</b> <b>medicine</b> and to link both patients' preferences for <b>complementary</b> and <b>alternative</b> <b>medicine</b> and health professionals' concerns about the proper use of <b>complementary</b> and <b>alternative</b> <b>medicine</b> for depression management and adverse drug interactions.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: Many {{pediatric}} patients use <b>complementary</b> and <b>alternative</b> <b>medicine,</b> {{especially when}} facing a chronic illness for which treatment options are limited. So far, {{research on the}} use of <b>complementary</b> and <b>alternative</b> <b>medicine</b> in patients with functional gastrointestinal disease has been scarce. This study was designed to assess <b>complementary</b> and <b>alternative</b> <b>medicine</b> use in children with different gastrointestinal diseases, including functional disorders, to determine which factors predicted <b>complementary</b> and <b>alternative</b> <b>medicine</b> use and to assess the willingness of parents to participate in future studies on <b>complementary</b> and <b>alternative</b> <b>medicine</b> efficacy and safety. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The prevalence of <b>complementary</b> and <b>alternative</b> <b>medicine</b> use was assessed by using a questionnaire for 749 children visiting pediatric gastroenterology clinics of 9 hospitals in the Netherlands. The questionnaire consisted of 35 questions on the child's gastrointestinal disease, medication use, health status, past and future <b>complementary</b> and <b>alternative</b> <b>medicine</b> use, reasons for its use, and the necessity of <b>complementary</b> and <b>alternative</b> <b>medicine</b> research. RESULTS: In this study population, the frequency of <b>complementary</b> and <b>alternative</b> <b>medicine</b> use was 37. 6 %. A total of 60. 3 % of this group had used complementary and altern?tive medicine specifically for their gastrointestinal disease. This specific <b>complementary</b> and <b>alternative</b> <b>medicine</b> use was higher in patients with functional disorders than organic disorders (25. 3 % vs 17. 2 %). Adverse effects of allopathic medication, school absenteeism, age <or= 11 years, and a low effect of conventional treatment were predictors of specific <b>complementary</b> and <b>alternative</b> <b>medicine</b> use. Almost all (93 %) of the parents considered it important that pediatricians initiate <b>complementary</b> and <b>alternative</b> <b>medicine</b> research, and 51 % of parents were willing to participate in future <b>complementary</b> and <b>alternative</b> <b>medicine</b> trials. CONCLUSIONS: Almost 40 % of parents of pediatric gastroenterology patients are turning to <b>complementary</b> and <b>alternative</b> <b>medicine</b> for their child. Lack of effectiveness of conventional therapy, school absenteeism, and adverse effects of allopathic medication are more important predictors of <b>complementary</b> and <b>alternative</b> <b>medicine</b> use than the type of gastrointestinal disease. Because evidence on most <b>complementary</b> and <b>alternative</b> <b>medicine</b> modalities in children with gastrointestinal disorders is lacking, there is an urgent need for research in this fiel...|$|R

Therefore, based on the high prevalence of chronic disorders, the present study aimed to determine <b>complementary</b> and <b>alternative</b> <b>medicine</b> usage frequency and its determinant factors. This was a cross-sectional study. Five hundred clients {{participated in the study}} by using convenience sampling. A 2 -part questionnaire (including demographic form and researcher-created questionnaire) was used for studying the prevalence of using <b>complementary</b> and <b>alternative</b> <b>medicine</b> methods, and users' satisfaction. Findings showed that 75. 4 % of people used at least one <b>complementary</b> and <b>alternative</b> <b>medicine</b> method. Most of users consumed medicinal plants (69. 4 %). The most common reason of using a <b>complementary</b> and <b>alternative</b> <b>medicine</b> method was common cold (32. 9 %). The highest satisfaction belonged to massage (2. 94 ± 0. 74).

40|$|AbstractObjective: <b>Complementary</b> and <b>alternative</b> <b>medicine</b> may {{influence}} cardiac surgical care by inducing coagulopathies and interacting with perioperative medications. We evaluated {{the significance of}} <b>complementary</b> and <b>alternative</b> <b>medicine</b> use in an acutely ill cardiac surgical population and assessed the willingness of patients to reveal these activities to their physicians and surgeons. Methods: A total of 376 consecutive patients undergoing preoperative or postoperative cardiothoracic surgical evaluations at an urban academic medical center were approached to complete a survey regarding use and attitudes toward <b>complementary</b> and <b>alternative</b> <b>medicine.</b> All surveys were administered and collected between March and May 1998. Results: Completion rate was 70 % (n = 263). Respondents were predominantly male (72 %), white (76 %), and well educated (59 %). The overall rate of <b>complementary</b> and <b>alternative</b> <b>medicine</b> use was 75 %, but excluding prayer and vitamins, which are often not considered <b>complementary</b> and <b>alternative</b> <b>medicine</b> therapies, the rate was 44 %. There was no correlation {{between the use of}} <b>complementary</b> and <b>alternative</b> <b>medicine</b> and the parameters of gender, age, race, or education level. Only 17 % responded that they had discussed <b>complementary</b> and <b>alternative</b> <b>medicine</b> with their physicians, and 48 % responded that {{they did not want to}} discuss the topic at all. Conclusions: <b>Complementary</b> and <b>alternative</b> <b>medicine</b> is used as frequently in patients undergoing cardiac surgery, as in the general population. Physicians and surgeons should be aware that patients have no inherent predisposition toward or against using <b>complementary</b> and <b>alternative</b> <b>medicine,</b> but that they are unlikely to volunteer their experience with it. The unwillingness of patients to discuss <b>complementary</b> and <b>alternative</b> <b>medicine</b> with physicians has serious implications for their safety, especially in acute care situations.

40|$|Background: The {{increasing}} {{and widespread}} use of <b>complementary</b> and <b>alternative</b> <b>medicine</b> {{in the general population}} requires health-care professionals to have a knowledge and appreciation of their use to ensure that decisions about care are appropriate, safe and meet patients' needs. This is also the case for critical care nurses. Presently, healthcare professionals including nurses have limited formal education on <b>complementary</b> and <b>alternative</b> <b>medicine.</b> Critical care nurses' role in relation to <b>complementary</b> and <b>alternative</b> <b>medicine</b> is important for two patient care reasons: some can adversely interact with conventional medicines and others can potentially improve patient's well-being. Australian critical care nurses' knowledge of <b>complementary</b> and <b>alternative</b> <b>medicine</b> is unknown.

40|$|The {{definition}} of <b>complementary</b> and <b>alternative</b> <b>medicine</b> is broad and evolving. We question {{whether it should}} encompass 'prayer' when prayer can be directed at improving health, the mechanism is unexplained and the practice based on personal beliefs. A review of studies on prayer for the alleviation of ill-health by the Cochrane collaboration suggested results remain equivocal. A local randomised blinded study of intercessory prayer in patients with cancer showed a significant improvement in assessments of spiritual and emotional wellbeing, despite small effects. Most studies of prayer use as a <b>complementary</b> and <b>alternative</b> <b>medicine</b> are from the United States where religious affiliation is reportedly high. Classifying prayer within <b>complementary</b> and <b>alternative</b> <b>medicine</b> domains varies by culture but is usually combined with mind/body therapies (ie. meditation), distorting patterns of use. Importantly, <b>complementary</b> and <b>alternative</b> <b>medicine</b> use is not commonly raised with patients' physicians despite such discussions having been shown to enhance communication. Physicians who describe themselves as 'spiritual', as opposed to 'religious', appear more likely to accept <b>complementary</b> and <b>alternative</b> <b>medicine.</b> Including prayer as a <b>complementary</b> and <b>alternative</b> <b>medicine</b> raises difficulties in definition and measurement, but its widespread societal use suggests it should be acknowledged.

This paper is a report of a literature review to explore the prevalence of <b>complementary</b> and <b>alternative</b> <b>medicine</b> use amongst people with diabetes to inform nursing practice, education and research. Background. Diabetes mellitus affects the entirety of a person's being and increasingly people use <b>complementary</b> and <b>alternative</b> <b>medicine</b> {{in conjunction with other}} medical treatments and lifestyle modifications to manage their condition and improve well-being. Methods. The CINAHL, Medline, ProQuest nursing journals and Psych INFO databases were searched for the period 1990 - 2006 using identified keywords. Results. A total of 18 studies from nine countries were found. The results suggest that the prevalence of <b>complementary</b> and <b>alternative</b> <b>medicine</b> use among people with diabetes ranges from 17 % to 72 · 8 %. The most widely used therapies among diabetic populations are nutritional supplements, herbal medicines, nutritional advice, spiritual healing and relaxation techniques. The characteristics which influence <b>complementary</b> and <b>alternative</b> <b>medicine</b> use are age, duration of diabetes, degree of complications and self-monitoring of blood glucose. Conclusion. Although inconsistency in the definition of <b>complementary</b> and <b>alternative</b> <b>medicine</b> and varying research designs make estimation of usage prevalence difficult, evidence suggests that a high proportion of people with diabetes use these therapies concurrently with conventional healthcare services.
