The <b>curve</b> <b>chart</b> in Fig.  7 is the restoration result got by this paper’s model without considering max depth. Comparing Figs.  6 and 7, the numerical value of top boundary in Fig.  7 is smaller than in Fig.  6. Referring to formula (3) and formula (4), when the max depth is larger than depth in current stratum status, compaction on stratum is greater and volume of porosity minishes better. Considering the assumption (3), so the volume of porosity for current strata should be the same as in the moment stratum got max depth and stratum thickness should be also consistent. Summarily, skeleton thickness based on max depth is rather larger than it with current depth of stratum. So that result of back-stripping is larger than applying current depth.|$|E

The analysis {{was carried out in}} Idrissi where major landuse types based on supervised classification were identified. Supervised classification was preferred as the study relies on quantitative analysis. Since the area is well known, geometric correction and validation were further carried out. The mean of the physicochemical and biological parameters were determined. Analysis of variance (one-way ANOVA) was used to determine whether there is variation in characteristics of surface water across different landuse types. The choice of ANOVA was based largely on the structure of the data. The mean value of the physiochemical parameters were compared with the standard set by World Health Organization (WHO 2003) using t test. Water quality index was used to provide a single number that expresses overall water quality within the study area. The descriptive statistics, analysis of variance and t test were done using SPSS 15.0 (statistical product and service solutions). Water quality index was calculated using online National Sanitation Calculator System software also known as NSF information software (Eq.  1).

40|$|Rehabilitation {{training}} {{is a kind}} of therapies for limb dysfunction patients caused by stroke. Traditional rehabilitation training relies on Physician’s subjective judgment, lacking in accurate evaluation means for training process and effects. Therefore, physiological signals are applied to rehabilitation evaluation so as to assist rehabilitation training. In addition, it is of low efficiency and large limitation that physicians usually need to guide patients one to one and face to face. In order to help physician remotely guide patients do rehabilitation training, the thesis will design a remote physiological signal monitoring system for rehabilitation training. Main works are as follows (1) Sensor node hardware device will be designed. According to the features that physiological signals are susceptible to interference and have small amplitude, high precision chip ADS 1198 is adopted as the core of the analog front end. Taking miniaturization into consideration, RTX 4140 Wi-Fi module integrated MCU is chosen to accomplish on-device functional programming and achieve wireless data transmission. Due to its high efficiency, no connection, and unidirectional transmission, UDP is selected as the system data transmission protocol. (2) Back-end cloud server and front-end web application will be designed and built. Considering the capability of holding high data streaming, multi-clients and real-time communication, high-performance Node. js is used to implement back-end server, and WebSocket is chosen for real-time communication with browsers. UDP data interface is built with data validation, to prevent the impact of network packet loss.

40|$|The {{importance}} of thermal comfort of a helmet related to heavy activities {{is considered to}} be the next to impact protection. Extensive research has been undertaken on the latter by introducing new materials/structures and computer simulations, including development of test standards. However, the helmet thermal comfort research is relatively limited. Therefore, {{there is a need to}} develop comprehensive testing methodology and numerical modelling to study the thermal comfort quantitatively. In this research programme, a novel test rig was developed by using microsensor technology to measure multi-point temperature and relative humidity (rH) inside a cricket helmet. The experimental tests were carried out on the limited ventilated and well ventilated cricket helmets at moderate and high ambient conditions in order to obtain the in-helmet micro climate thermal and moisture mappings. Results were presented in <b>curve</b> <b>chart</b> and contour plot formats, in which variations of the in-helmet temperature/rH and hot/wet spots could be clearly observed. Human subjective warmth and moisture sensations and comfort perception were also recorded and linked to the digital measurements of the in-helmet temperature and rH. Through such linkage, the equivalent sensation and perception indexes were established as tools to evaluate the predicted temperatures and rHs from the finite element (FE) parametric studies. Digital laser scanner was used to help the creation of 3 D models of the head, helmet structure and air pocket and air channels' between the head and the helmet. The heat transfer and mass diffusion FE analyses showed reasonably good correlations of the in-helmet temperatures and rHs with the experimental results. Using validated computer models, parametric studies were carried out to cover various ventilation opening sizes, shapes and locations. The predicted in-helmet temperatures and rHs related to various ventilation opening configurations were processed to draw out the equivalent warmth/moisture sensation and comfort perception index scales. Such predicted scales were compared with the scales obtained from experimental measurements to judge whether the opening configuration is favourable to thermal comfort. The helmets with favourable opening configuration were subsequently subjected to impact modelling to evaluate their impact resistance. Finally, a helmet with optimised thermal comfort and necessary impact protection was recommended. This approach would assist the designing process of new types of helmet prior to prototype making or production. It is believed that the above approach will save a lot of man power and time and thus shorten the new product development cycle. The experimental methodology, finite element modelling and parametric study approach developed in this research programme can be used to study other types of helmet.

40|$|As {{the nature}} of a {{workforce}} changes over time, one broadly-defined group of workers diminishes in numbers while another group increases in numbers. For example, during the period 1890 - 1910, the major proportion of the workforce in the United States shifted from agriculture to industrial production (U. S. Bureau of the Census, 1975). Figure 1 presents the concept. Relentless technological developments gave rise to new job classifications and to increased employment opportunities in industrial production. At the same time, technological developments diminished employment opportunities in another field, in this case, agriculture. Over the long term, then, one might expect that demand for groups of occupations will increase over time, but will be expected to decline when that employment sector is eclipsed by yet another employment sector, driven by a new technological wave. The intersection of the two <b>curves</b> <b>charting</b> the demand for agricultural occupations and industrial occupations occurred during a time of rapid societal change, which was, in turn, a significant impetus for major educational change. Moreover, because these times of change have historical precedents, they may have a relatively high degree of predictability.

[and] identifiable forces” that once understood allow us to “cope strategically, rather than haphazardly... ” (p. xvii). To explore the hypothesis that educational ferment is a naturally occurring phenomena at the juncture of technological ages, selected economic transition points will be juxtaposed with developments in the evolving field of technology education. From this perspective, the recently-recognized shift in employment patterns from manufacturing-based employment to informationbased employment has influenced the shift from an industrial materials content base to a technology systems base in contemporary technology education programs...|$|R
