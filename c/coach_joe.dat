5|$|In week 9, {{and after}} a bye week, Michigan {{traveled}} to State College, Pennsylvania {{to take on the}} Penn State Nittany Lions. This game was seen as an important game in Michigan's season, as it was a nationally broadcast primetime game and allowed Michigan a chance for redemption after two consecutive losses. Michigan entered the game needing just one win to become bowl eligible, while Penn State's head <b>coach</b> <b>Joe</b> Paterno entered the game in search of his 399th career win. During the week leading up to the game, Penn State was unsure of starting quarterback Robert Bolden's status for the game due to a head injury suffered during the previous week's game against Minnesota. It was later announced that former walk-on Matt McGloin would start the game for Penn State. Michigan lost to Penn State the previous year by a score of 35–10, which was Penn State's first win at Michigan Stadium since 1996.|$|E
5|$|Alabama {{head coach}} Nick Saban entered his fifth {{year as the}} Crimson Tide's head coach for the 2011 season.

5|$|Peter Forsberg's number 21 {{became the}} fourth jersey number retired by the Avs on opening night, a contest Colorado would lose to Detroit 3–0. Colorado {{redeemed}} themselves in game {{two of the}} season on October 10, 2011, against the 2011 Stanley Cup champion Boston Bruins. Varlamov negated all 30 shots registered by Boston and posted the fifth shutout of his career and first win as an Avalanche in the regular season. Milan Hejduk scored the game-winning goal and first goal of the season for the club in a 1–0 victory over the defending champions. In April 2012, The Avs were eliminated from playoff contention and finished 11th place in the Western Conference. Despite a 20-point improvement from last season's efforts, the team failed to reach {{the playoffs for the}} second straight year, the first time the Colorado club would do so in their 17 years playing in Denver. Head <b>coach</b> <b>Joe</b> Sacco signed a two-year contract extension shortly {{after the end of the}} season. Stand out rookie Gabriel Landeskog overtook Matt Duchene as the youngest in franchise history to lead the team in goals, scoring 22 in 82 games.|$|E

5|$|Zolak {{was again}} the backup behind O'Donnell in 1989. He played in eight games, {{completing}} 33 of 69 passes for 407yards and two touchdowns. In 1990, after O'Donnell graduated and began his NFL career, Zolak became the starter for Maryland, and head <b>coach</b> <b>Joe</b> Krivak had {{high hopes for}} him heading into the season. In his first start as a senior, Zolak completed a school record 28 passes in 46 attempts for 303yards and two touchdowns, including a 51-yard pass to Gene Thomas with 61 seconds left that gave Maryland the win against Virginia Tech, 2013. The following week, he once more featured in a dramatic conclusion, throwing a 59-yard touchdown pass to Gene Thomas with 2:27 left to beat 25th ranked West Virginia, 1410. However, he was struggling in other aspects of his game. In an October game against Georgia Tech, Zolak was sacked 10 times. In four games, he had been sacked 23 times and had a pass intercepted 12 times. By {{the end of the}} season, as Maryland was preparing to face Louisiana Tech in the , he had thrown 225 completed passes in 418 attempts for 2,589yards and 10 touchdowns. The teams tied, 3434, in Zolak's final collegiate appearance. At the time of his graduation, he ranked fifth in school history with 270 pass completions, seventh with 3,124 career passing yards, and second with 2,589 passing yards in a season. He was also named Atlantic Coast Conference Offensive Player of the Week four times.|$|E
5|$|In {{his second}} year with the Lakers under new <b>coach</b> <b>Joe</b> Mullaney, Chamberlain seriously injured his knee. He was injured in the ninth game of the schedule, {{suffering}} a total rupture of the patellar tendon {{at the base of}} his right kneecap, and missed the next several months before appearing in the final three games of the 82-game regular season. Owing to a great start, he managed to average 27.3 points, 18.4 rebounds and 4.1 assists per game. Again, the Lakers charged through the playoffs, and in the 1970 NBA Finals, the Lakers were pitted against the New York Knicks, loaded with future Hall-of-Famers Willis Reed, Dave DeBusschere, Bill Bradley, and Walt Frazier. Cherry observed that Reed, a prolific midrange shooter, was a bad matchup for Chamberlain: having lost lateral quickness due to his injury, the Lakers center was often too slow to block Reed's preferred high post jump shots. In Game 1, New York masterminded a 124–112 win in which Reed scored 37 points. In Game 2, Chamberlain scored 19 points, grabbed 24 rebounds, and blocked Reed's shot in the final seconds, leading the Lakers to a 105–103 win. Game 3 saw Jerry West famously hit a 60-foot shot at the buzzer to tie the game at 102; however, the Knicks took the game 111–108. In Game 4, Chamberlain scored 18 points and grabbed 25 rebounds and helped tie the series at 2. In Game 5, with the Knicks trailing by double digits, Reed pulled his thigh muscle and seemed to be done for the series. By conventional wisdom, Chamberlain now should have dominated against little-used Knicks backup centers Nate Bowman and Bill Hosket or forwards Bradley and DeBusschere, who gave up more than half a foot against the Lakers center. Instead, the Lakers gave away their 13-point halftime lead and succumbed to the aggressive Knicks defense: L.A. committed 19 second half turnovers, and the two main scorers Chamberlain and West shot the ball only three and two times, respectively, in the entire second half. The Lakers lost 107–100 in what was called one of the greatest comebacks in NBA Finals history. In Game 6, Chamberlain scored 45 points, grabbed 27 rebounds and almost single-handedly equalized the series in a 135–113 Lakers win, and with Reed out, the Knicks seemed doomed prior to Game 7 in New York.|$|E
