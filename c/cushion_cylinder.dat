40|$|Â Â Â For typical vapor {{compression}} processes, {{lubricant oil}} is very essential for lubricating and sealing the sliding parts and the lubricant also takes part in <b>cushioning</b> <b>cylinder</b> valves. However lubricants may {{migrate to the}} evaporator to alter the heat transfer characteristics. This is can be made clear from the viscosity and surface tension of lubricant since the viscosity of lubricant oil is about two to three orders {{higher than that of}} refrigerant whereas the corresponding surface tension of lubricant is approximately one order higher. Typically, the presence of lubricant may deteriorate heat transfer performance, yet this phenomenon becomes more severe when the lubricant mass fraction is higher. However, some previous literatures had clearly showed that the presence of lubricant oil may favor the heat transfer performance at a low lubricant fraction and the heat transfer performance may peak at a specific oil concentration. In this study, the authors aim at clarifying this phenomenon subject to pool boiling condition. Various parameters affecting the heat transfer coefficient, such as viscosity, surface tension, critical solution temperature and other thermodynamic and transport properties will be examined. Â Â Â During pool boiling process, the lubricant accumulates on the surface since the refrigerant is preferential to evaporate. Hence, excess lubricant enrichment on the surface results in a thin lubricant excess layer and a thermal boundary layer, which influence the heat transfer performance, either enhancement or degradation. The excess layer may bring about a liquid-solid surface energy reduction which increases site density and reduces the bubble departure diameter, causing enhancement and degradation in heat transfer performance, respectively. However, the effect of the bubble departure diameter normally surpasses the influence of site density. This may be the crucial reason that gives rise to an occurrence of the plateau of heat transfer coefficient and followed by an apparent decline of heat transfer coefficient with a further increase of lubricant concentration. Â Â Â Moreover, with the preferential evaporation of the refrigerant, a surface tension gradient is formed, which induces the Marangoni effect through which refrigerant/lubricant mixtures is supplied toward the contact line. From the phase equilibrium diagram, the maximum of the Marangoni number may occur at the low lubricant concentration with a maximum temperature difference. Hence, the presence of Marangoni effect may also be the favor the heat transfer accordingly. Also, a small fraction of lubricant will increase a larger viscosity that provide a thicker thermal boundary layer which may activate more site density, and enhances the heat transfer performance. Furthermore, miscibility may also play a crucial factor that affects the pool boiling heat transfer performance. The fluid with a smaller difference between the bulk fluid temperature and critical solution temperature may yield a better heat transfer performance by drawing superheated liquid onto the bubble sides. ...|$|R
40|$|Displacement {{controlled}} hydraulic actuation {{has proven}} to be an efficient alternative to valve controlled hydraulic actuation. Previous work has concentrated on the development of these circuits for proof of concept prototype machines in order to demonstrate improved fuel efficiency. In this work, the displacement controlled technology has been developed further and applied to a prototype miniature excavator. Electronic sensing and control, including CAN capable electronic control units and joysticks was implemented on the prototype machine. Electronic control concepts such as electronic <b>cylinder</b> <b>cushioning,</b> anti-stall control, relief flow reduction, blade float, and inactive circuit pressure reduction were developed in order to improve operator feel, machine efficiency, and to demonstrate the advantages of electronic control.

40|$|AbstractThis work {{is devoted}} to {{computer}} simulation of electro-pneumatic drives for vertical motion mobile robots. These robots are equipped with suction pads to move on walls and ceiling. An output highlights a conflict between the main requirements to such robot drives: simultaneous ensuring of high speed and smoothness of movement of robots with a considerable mass of moved objects. The low efficiency of traditional <b>cushion</b> systems of <b>cylinders</b> is shown in development of such kind of robots. New structure of electro-pneumatic drive for applications with considerable inertia load is developed. This structure represents mechatronic system and consists from the set of on-off valves and computer control device that operates the valves and reaches the optimum motion control of the object with required smoothness. This could be achieved due to the multistep braking {{in the end of}} stroke. The paper also represents the mathematical model of developed drive with description of throttle elements, friction forces and details of computer control systems. Mathematical model realized in computer program allows to simulate processes of movement of electro-pneumatic drives. The results of computer modeling show that developed structure and multistep computer control allows to develop effective electro-pneumatic drives for high-quality and high-speed control of massive objects in the part of vertical motion mobile robots.

40|$|As {{automation}} technology {{continues to}} be integrated into industrial and mobile machinery, more precise control of hydraulic cylinders will assist in the achievement of desired response characteristics. Thus, in designing the cushioning mechanism for a hydraulic cylinder, there is value in predicting the deceleration response due to pressure generated when fluid passes through the cushion orifice. The cushion orifice can be designed to change {{as a function of}} piston position to meet a desired velocity response. In practice, determination of the orifice area requires a lengthy iterative process of trial and error. Therefore, to overcome these design process challenges, dynamic models of <b>cylinder</b> <b>cushioning</b> systems were developed that, when solved numerically, predicted the pressure and velocity responses of the cylinder with time. Utilizing these dynamic models, a cushion design optimization procedure was also developed to obtain the dimensions of the cushioning spear that most closely obtains the desired velocity response profile. Simulations of the dynamic cushion model were performed using a cushion spear with a shape designed through a static analysis to produce constant deceleration during the cushioning phase. Spear shapes were fit to the analytically developed common spear profile and their performance was assessed with simulation. The developed optimization procedure was run to compare the performance the spear shapes common to industry. Lastly, to identify the range of results produced by the optimizer, the procedure was run ten times for each spear type with the variation between runs. The performance of each run was quantified by measuring the root-mean square error (RMSE) between the desired velocity profile and the simulated velocity profile. When surrounding system conditions were held constant, the analytical analysis produced a profile leading to nearly constant deceleration with an RMSE of 1. 4 x 10 - 3 m/s (0. 29 feet per minute; fpm) when simulated by the dynamic model. However, attempts to replicate the results of the analytical model with common spear shapes resulted in deviation from the constant deceleration goal with the parabolic and linear regression curves producing RMSE values of 14. 9 x 10 - 3 and 21. 7 x 10 - 3 m/s (2. 94 and 4. 28 fpm) respectively. The optimizer produced a consistent family of results for each spear with an average standard deviation of 2. 6 x 10 - 3 m/s (0. 51 fpm). This dynamic modeling approach has potential to assist designers in the development of cushioning spears that meet customer cushion response specifications...|$|R
