Almost all plants {{are more or less}} covered with hairs, and it needs but a slight thickening at the base, a slight woody deposit at the point, to turn them forthwith into the stout prickles of the rose or the bramble. Most leaves are more or less pointed at the end or at the summits of the lobes; and it needs but a slight intensification of this pointed tendency to produce forthwith the sharp defensive foliage of gorse, thistles, and holly. Often one can see all the intermediate stages still surviving under one's very eyes. The thistles, themselves, for example, vary from soft and unarmed species which haunt out-of-the-way spots beyond the reach of browsing herbivores, to such trebly-mailed types as that enemy of the agricultural interest, the <b>creeping</b> <b>thistle,</b> in which the leaves continue themselves as prickly wings down every side of the stem, so that the whole plant is amply clad from head to foot in a defensive coat of fierce and bristling spearheads. There is a common little English meadow weed, the rest-harrow, which in rich and uncropped fields produces no defensive armour of any sort; but on the much-browsed-over suburban commons and in similar exposed spots, where only gorse and blackthorn stand a chance for their lives against the cows and donkeys, it has developed a protected variety in which some of the branches grow abortive, and end abruptly in stout spines like a hawthorn's. Only those rest-harrows have there survived in the sharp struggle for existence which happened most to baffle their relentless pursuers.|$|E

40|$|This is {{the final}} report of Defra project OF 0145. If organic farming is to expand in the arable east of England, where the knowledge, {{infrastructure}} and capital for livestock are not available, viable stockless systems will be needed. The aim is to maximise economic performance and in turn encourage conversion. Project OF 0112 showed that a stockless arable rotation was consistently more profitable that a comparable conventional rotation on the fertile silty clay loam at ADAS Terrington. Project OF 0145 researched challenges to sustaining that level of performance into the second crop rotation. The project {{was a combination of}} systems comparison, replicated experiments and monitoring of commercial farms. The core of the project was an unreplicated systems comparison with field-scale plots to allow meaningful study of patchy problems such as perennial weeds and give confidence to farmers that the system could work on a farm scale. Conversion was completed in 1995 and the rotation has since been clover, potatoes, winter wheat, spring beans, undersown spring barley. The greatest agronomic challenges continued to be with the establishment of fertility-building legumes. Despite these problems, crop yields have been maintained with good rolling average yields of 25 t/ha for potatoes, 7. 5 t/ha for winter wheat, 3. 5 t/ha for spring beans and 4. 1 t/ha for spring cereals. Disease levels in cereals have remained low and posed minimum threat to yields. Slugs and blight have affected potatoes in wet years; control of these is particularly difficult in an organic system leading to greater yield variability than would be expected in a non-organic rotation. Calabrese has grown and yielded well with few problems but weed control in onions proved both difficult and expensive and they have been dropped in the successor project OF 0301. Weighted rolling-average gross margins show a consistent and large advantage to organic (£ 912 /ha conventional, £ 1757 /ha stockless with potatoes and £ 1148 /ha stockless with vegetables). The advantage to organic has increased with time as yields and prices have been maintained whilst conventional crop prices have fallen. Soil fertility as measured by carbon and nitrogen contents has shown little change since the start of conversion in 1990. Soil available P and K have remained at ADAS Index 1 to 2 despite continued crop offtakes. However both are showing a slow progressive decline, less so with P, perhaps partly due to the rotational applications of Aluminium Calcium Phosphate. Annual weeds are proving relatively easy to control, being worst where crop growth is poor for reasons such as compaction on headlands. However, the perennial weeds couch grass, <b>creeping</b> <b>thistles</b> and docks are an increasing problem. Hand pulling of thistles and docks is containing the problem but the cost of this has risen dramatically in the last two years. The distribution of potato cyst nematodes (PCN) was mapped within all five plots in January 1998, 1999 and 2000. Sampling was in 25 m x 25 m sub-plots.
