In addition, there are considerable discrepancies in the names of tribes given by the sources. Some locations of the tribes recorded are uncertain, although most have been established securely by placename and personal-name evidence.|$|E

25|$|Rather, Frankfurter said, the {{constitutional}} and the interpretative issues were ripe for review. Frankfurter {{pointed out that}} during oral argument before the Supreme Court, the federal government claimed that the district court had misread and misinterpreted its claims. The district court, Frankfurter said, had three times argued {{that the government had}} admitted that Section 304 abridged rights guaranteed by the First Amendment. However, that was not the admission of the government, federal attorneys said. If the court had misinterpreted the government's position, Frankfurter concluded, the case should be remanded for further proceedings rather than adjudicated. However, since a majority has seen fit to grant certiorari, Frankfurter reluctantly agreed to <b>concur</b> <b>in</b> the majority opinion.|$|E

5000|$|In {{an opinion}} written by Justice Harry Blackmun, the Court held that civil {{forfeiture}} proceedings are [...] "subject to {{the limitations of}} the Eight Amendment's Excessive Fines Clause." [...] Justice Antonin Scalia filed an opinion <b>concurring</b> <b>in</b> part and <b>concurring</b> <b>in</b> the judgment, writing that the majority should not have decided whether in rem forfeitures always amount to a punishment of the owner.

5000|$|Justice Alito <b>concurred</b> <b>in</b> {{part and}} <b>concurred</b> <b>in</b> judgment.

Alito argued that [...] "the act of voting is not drained of its expressive content when the vote has a legal effect". Despite disagreement on whether legislators' voting constitutes speech, Alito <b>concurred</b> <b>in</b> judgement based on the Court's arguments that legislative recusal laws have historically been long standing and not overturned.|$|R
500|$|Justice Stevens, {{joined by}} Burger, Stewart and Rehnquist, concurring in part and dissenting in {{part in the}} judgment, found it {{unnecessary}} {{to determine whether a}} racial preference was ever allowed under the Constitution. [...] A narrow finding that the university had discriminated against Bakke, violating Title VI, was sufficient, and the court was correct to admit him. [...] "It is therefore perfectly clear that the question whether race can ever be used as a factor in an admissions decision is not an issue in this case, and that discussion of that issue is inappropriate." [...] According to Stevens, [...] "he meaning of the Title VI ban on exclusion is crystal clear: Race cannot be the basis of excluding anyone from a federally funded program". He concluded, [...] "I <b>concur</b> <b>in</b> the Court's judgment insofar as it affirms the judgment of the Supreme Court of California. To the extent that it purports to do anything else, I respectfully dissent." ...|$|E
500|$|The bill, as amended, {{passed the}} Senate without {{recorded}} vote on March 27, 1936. [...] The House of Representatives received the bill on April 1, and referred {{it to the}} Committee on Coinage, Weights, and Measures. It was reported back to the House on April 16, having been amended to require the Cleveland committee to purchase not less than 25,000 coins at one time, eliminating {{the possibility that the}} committee could order an initial 5,000 and then fail to purchase any more. The full House considered the bill on April 23, 1936, with the bill reported by John Joseph Cochran of Missouri as an emergency measure. When he asked for unanimous consent to pass the amended bill, Pennsylvania's Robert F. Rich asked how many coinage bills were going to be considered and if it would not be possible to consolidate a dozen of them into one bill. [...] Cochran replied that he had consulted with Ohio's Robert Crosser and been informed that [...] "if we do not get the authority to print the coins now it will be useless". The following day, Bulkley moved that the Senate <b>concur</b> <b>in</b> the House amendments, which it did, and the bill was signed into law by President Franklin D. Roosevelt on May 5, 1936.|$|E
500|$|At {{the end of}} World War II, the [...] Viet Minh had proclaimed {{independence}} {{under the}} Democratic Republic of Vietnam (DRV) in September 1945. This occurred after the withdrawal of Imperial Japan, which had seized control of the French colony during World War II. The military struggle started in November 1946 when France attempted to reassert control over Indochina with {{an attack on the}} northern port city of Haiphong. The DRV was recognised by the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China (PRC). On the other hand, the western powers recognised the French-backed State of Vietnam, nominally led by Emperor Bảo Đại, but with a French-trained Vietnamese National Army (VNA) which was loyal to the French Union forces. In May 1954, after eight years of fighting, the French were surrounded and defeated in a mountainous northern fortress at the Battle of Dien Bien Phu. France's withdrawal from Indochina was finalised in the Geneva Accords of July 1954, after two months of negotiations between Ho's DRV, France, the PRC and the Soviet Union. Under the terms of the agreement, Vietnam was temporarily divided at the 17th parallel north pending elections in 1956 to choose a national government that would administer a reunified country. The communist Viet Minh were left in control of North Vietnam, while the State of Vietnam controlled the south. French Union forces would gradually withdraw from Vietnam as the situation stabilised. Both Vietnamese sides were unsatisfied with the outcome at Geneva; Ngo Dinh Diem, Prime Minister of the State of Vietnam, denounced France's agreement and ordered his delegation not to sign. He stated [...] "We cannot recognise the seizure by Soviet China [...] [...] [...] of over half of our national territory" [...] and that [...] "We can neither <b>concur</b> <b>in</b> the brutal enslavement of millions of compatriots". North Vietnamese Prime Minister Phạm Văn Đồng expressed bitterness after his Soviet and Chinese backers threatened to cut support if he did not agree to the peace terms; Dong had wanted to press home the Viet Minh's military advantage so they could lay claim to more territory at the negotiating table.|$|E
