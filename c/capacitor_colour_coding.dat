Unfortunately, <b>colour</b> <b>coding</b> has only been introduced for gas cylinders [4], intravenous cannulas and needles [5].

40|$|Subjects {{sought a}} unique target shape {{in a display}} of abstractor shapes under three <b>colour</b> <b>coding</b> {{condition}}s. In the no <b>colour</b> <b>coding</b> condition (NCC) all shapes shared the same colour. In the two colour-coded conditions, the target was uniquely and redundantly <b>colour</b> <b>coded</b> with a <b>colour</b> whose CIE xy chromaticity coordinates were linearly separable (LS) or were not linearly separable (NLS) from the set of distractor chromaticity coordinates. Performance was optimal under LS coding, was reduced under NLS coding and was least efficient in the NCC condition. We discuss {{the implications of these}} results for refining colour selection algorithms and for <b>colour</b> <b>coding</b> in situations where the gamut of available colours is limited. In a secondary set of analyses, we note large performance differences as a function of target shape. -l-Executive Summary The goal of this paper was to apply a recent finding from colour psychophysics to the issue of <b>colour</b> selection for <b>coding</b> in a complex visual display. D'Zmura (1991) and Bauer, Jolicoeur, and Cowan, (1996) have shown that if a target's chromaticit...|$|R
