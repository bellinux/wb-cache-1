40|$|Problem statement: The {{consumption}} of black <b>cumin</b> (Nigella sativa) <b>seed</b> has immunomodulatory and anti-bacterial activity, but in rabbits this {{had not yet}} been tested. Approach: In the present studies, rabbits were fed diets without or with black <b>cumin</b> <b>seed</b> and antibody production, phagocytotic activity, hypersensitivity and resistance against Pasteurellosis were assessed. Results: Feeding black <b>cumin</b> <b>seed</b> significantly increased serum concentrations of antibodies in response to intramusculary injected serum bovine albumin. Blood derived from rabbits fed the diets containing either 15 or 20 % black <b>cumin</b> <b>seed</b> significantly reduced the growth of Staphylococcus aureus on sheep-blood agar plates. Skin thickness as index of hypersensitivity towards tuberculin was significantly reduced at 48 h after intradermal injection of the agent. Ingestion of black <b>cumin</b> <b>seed</b> significantly extended survival time after intraperitoneal administration of Pasteurella multocida. Conclusion: The feeding of black <b>cumin</b> <b>seed</b> to rabbits stimulated their immune system, but did not enhance inflammation. </font...|$|R
40|$|The {{research}} {{was performed on}} 40 chicken broilers of Cobb provenience to investigate the effect of dietary black <b>cumin</b> <b>seed</b> oil on some blood biochemical parameters in chicken broilers. 40 chicken broilers who {{were included in the}} 42 days lasting experiment were divided into two groups, each one of 20 individuals. Group K was the control – with no added oil in feed mixture and the second group P was the experimental one – chickens were fed with 0, 025 g of p. o. administered black <b>cumin</b> <b>seed</b> oil. Feed and water supplies were ad libitum. Microclimate conditions (light, temperature and airflow) were maintained according to the technological procedure. Blood samples were taken from the wing vein of all animals from both groups at age of 25, 32 and 39 days. The following blood serum biochemical parameters were determined: total lipids, triglycerides, total cholesterol, albumen and calcium. Dietary black <b>cumin</b> <b>seed</b> oil significantly (P< 0. 05) affected serum lipid components, particularly total lipids, but not albumen and calcium in chicken broilers.

In this study, eighty 27 -wk-old laying hens (Hyline- 5 White) were randomly assigned into 4 groups with 4 replicates of 5 birds each (20 laying hens per group) and fed diets supplemented with 1, 2, or 3 % black cumin. Eggs were collected and weighed daily. Laying performance, egg quality, and feed conversion ratio were evaluated. Lay-ing hens fed the diet supplemented with 3 % black cum-in had greater egg production than the control. Diets supplemented with 2 or 3 % black cumin increased egg weight compared with other groups. Yolk weights of the eggs from hens fed diets containing 1, 2, and 3 % black cumin were significantly greater than those from the control group. Shell thickness of the eggs from chickens fed 2 or 3 % black <b>cumin</b> <b>seed</b> was significantly greater than those from chickens fed diets supplemented with 0 or 1 % black <b>cumin</b> <b>seed.</b> Also, shell strength of the eggs from hens fed diets supplemented with 3 % black <b>cumin</b> <b>seed</b> was significantly greater than the control.

No level of black <b>cumin</b> <b>seed</b> supplementa-tion had any effect on live weight, feed consumption, feed conversion ratio, organ weights, and abdominal adipose tissue.

Penelitian ini bertujuan menganalisis defensin dari ekstrak protein biji N. sativa dan mencit (Mus musculus) yang diberi ekstrak protein biji N. sativa. M. musculus dibagi menjadi kelompok K (kontrol) yang tidak diberi ekstrak protein biji N. sativa. Kelompok D 1, D 2 dan D 3 diberi ekstrak protein biji N. sativa dalam dosis rendah (0, 35 mg/bb), dosis sedang (0, 7 mg/bb) dan dosis tinggi (1, 4 mg/bb) selama 7 hari dan pada hari ke- 8 dilakukan pengambilan darah. Analisis protein defensin dilakukan melalui teknik SDS-PAGE pada gel poliakrilamid 17 % terhadap sampel darah K, D 1, D 2, D 3 dan sampel ekstrak protein biji N. sativa (T).
