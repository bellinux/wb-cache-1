5000|$|By the mid-1920s the {{steelworks}} increased {{production to}} 1860 tonnes of castings, distributed both in Poland and in Romania, Lithuania and Latvia. In 1926 the company owned also three large shops in Warsaw, Krakow and Łódź offering {{a wide range}} of agricultural machines: horse mills, threshing machines, reapers, winnowers and <b>chaff</b> <b>cutters.</b> In addition, the company also produced a wide variety of pipes, pots, kettles, stoves, ovens, horse cart parts and many more products. The same year the company received its first army order for drums of telephone wire.Initially the company was very successful and the new Kielce-based works have soon outgrown the original works at Suchedniów. However, the Great Depression stroke the company hard. In 1927 the owners had to split the company and 96% of shares of the Huta Ludwików were taken over by the Huta Pokój in Bytom, the largest steel company of Poland at that time. The new management, since 1931 led by Otmar Kwieciński, quickly restructured the factory and started expanding the product range to include more complex products. It also started to compete for renewed contracts with the Polish Army. In 1934 the first large success came: the newly renamed [...] "Huta Ludwików Corporation" [...] (Huta Ludwików - Spółka Akcyjna) became the sole producer of the new Hełm wz. 31 military helmet. Until 1939 over 300,000 were delivered. Another success came in 1936, when Huta Ludwików won another government contract, this time for the sabres for the cavalry.

50|$|The scythe and pitchfork, farming tools, have {{frequently}} {{been used as}} a weapon by those who couldn't afford or didn't have access to more expensive weapons such as pikes, swords, or later, guns. Scythes and pitchforks were stereotypically carried by angry mobs or gangs of enraged peasants. The process usually involved reforging the blade of a scythe at a 90 degree angle, strengthening the joint between the blade and the shaft with an additional metal pipe or bolts and reinforcing the shaft to better protect it against cuts from enemy blades. At times, instead of a scythe blade, a blade from a hand-operated <b>chaff</b> <b>cutter</b> was used.|$|E
50|$|The small six-column engine may be {{considered}} as an early form of semi-portable engine. Its pre-fabricated nature and avoidance of foundations made it quicker, thus cheaper, to first install. It also encouraged the re-use of engines on other sites.

The Cobb's Brewery engine (1825) at Margate was one of a batch built for a sugar plantation in the West Indies, but owing to their bankruptcy before shipping it was sent instead to South America. Its ship then foundered on the North Foreland and it was purchased from the wreck for use locally. The versatility of this design meant that they could be used easily by a variety of industries.|$|E
5000|$|Early {{steam engines}} were too large and {{expensive}} {{for use on}} the average farm; however, the first positive evidence of steam power being used to drive a threshing machine was in 1799 in north Yorkshire. The next recorded application was in 1812, when Richard Trevithick designed the first 'semi-portable' stationary steam engine for agricultural use, known as a [...] "barn engine". This was a high-pressure, rotative engine with a Cornish boiler, for Sir Christopher Hawkins of Probus, Cornwall. It was used to drive a corn threshing machine and was much cheaper to run than the horses it replaced. Indeed, it was so successful that it remained in use for nearly 70 years, and has been preserved by the Science Museum in London. Although termed 'semi-portable', {{as they could be}} transported and installed without being dismantled, these engines were essentially stationary. They were used to drive such barn machinery as pumps and hammer mills, bone-crushers, <b>chaff</b> and turnip <b>cutters,</b> and fixed and mobile threshing drums.|$|R

40|$|The paper {{presents}} to formulate an experimental data based ANN {{model for a}} Human Powered Fodder Chopper. The authors in their research paper published earlier have suggested {{the design of the}} experimentation for the formulation of such model. The experimentation has been carried out on a Fodder Chopper energized by human power. Mathematical models have been formulated, validated and optimized as per the suggested procedure. In this paper the ANN model is formulated to generate the correct values of the output parameters corresponding to the various values of the input parameters. The regression coefficient between the observed values and the values of the response variables computed by the ANN justifies this as best fit model. The developed ANN can now be used to select the best values of the various independent features for the designed <b>chaff</b> <b>cutter</b> to match the features of the machine operator performing the chaff cutting task so as to maximize the productivity and minimize torque, cutting time. Thus the entrepreneur selecting the best possible combinations of the input parameters by using this ANN can now improve the productivity of an experimental setup...|$|E

The study specifies factors influencing the garlic peeling process and recommends a design options for garlic peeling machine. These {{are based on a}} systematic study of the garlic peeling process. For which we consider literatures reviews & some of them are explained. In the present investigation, in the recent past human powered flywheel motor concept has been used for <b>chaff</b> <b>cutter,</b> bricks making, wood turning, cloth washing and turmeric polishing. The machine uses bicycle technology, with speed increasing gearing and a flywheel, which drive the process unit through a spiral jaw clutch and torque increasing gearing. Pedal power is used transmit this power to run the machine by the operator. Power can be transmitted through crank chain to free wheel to the working unit. This human powered flywheel motor concept (HPFM) provide new era in the human powered agriculture processing, harvesting, post harvested operations equipments. Considering social, cultural and environmental factor as well as in many rural operations utilizing unskilled worker and in Vidharbha region there is more problem of electricity so this kind of HPFM concept is helpful in driving various rural machines. The machine is economically viable, can be adopted for human powered process units which could have intermitted operation without affecting the end product.

40|$|Abstract: The Indian farming employs 225 million {{workforce}} {{to cover}} 140 million hectares of total cultivated land. In spite of rapid farm mechanization (e. g., 149 million farm machinery), the vast resource-poor family farming has primary dependence on traditional methods (e. g., 520 million hand tools and 37 million animal-drawn implements are in operation). The work drudgery, the traumatic accidents and injuries {{are the major}} concerns to examine options for ergonomics intervention and betterment of work in crop production activities. This review summarizes human energy expenditure in crop production activities, to assess the job severity, tools and machinery, and formulate the basis to reorganize work and work methods. While the farm mechanization is more in the northern India, the accidents were more in the villages in southern India. On average of the four regions, the tractor incidents (overturning, falling from the tractor, etc.) were highest (27. 7 %), followed by thresher (14. 6 %), sprayer/duster (12. 2 %), sugarcane crusher (8. 1 %) and <b>chaff</b> <b>cutter</b> (7. 8 %) accidents. Most of the fatal accidents resulted from the powered machinery, with the annual fatality rate estimated as 22 per 100, 000 farmers. The hand tools related injuries (8 % of the total accidents) were non-fatal in nature. In spite of the enactment of legislation, the shortcomings in production and monitoring of the machinery in field use {{may be responsible for}} the high rate o...|$|E
40|$|Experiment 1, with rams (17. 0 kg {{initial weight}} (M), and {{experiment}} 2, with steers (203 kg M), involved 2 x 2 arrangements of treatments {{to compare the}} effect of doubling the amount of stover offered (25 or 50 g/kg M daily) and chopping (unchopped or chopped), upon intake, selection and live-weight change. The stover used was a non-bird-resistant, local variety (Dinkamash). The particle length distribution of the chopped stover (produced by a tractor-driven <b>chaff</b> <b>cutter)</b> was: 90 mm, 0. 034. The stover was supplemented with minerals and cottonseed cake (sheep, 0. 1 kg dry matter (DM) per day; cattle, 0. 76 kg DM per day). Experiment 1, over 56 days involved 48 Menz Highland, 18 -month-old, rams, with four replicate pens containing three rams. Experiment 2, over 49 days, used 32, individually penned, Friesian X Zebu yealing steers. With rams, doubling the amount offered and chopping increased intake, and the effects were additive (unchopped: 0. 98 1. 24; chopped: 1. 08 1. 60 (s. e. 0. 71) kg DM per pen per day). With steers, there was an amount X chopping interaction (P< 0. 05) (unchopped: 3. 7 4. 7 chopped: 3. 6 3. 9 (s. e. 0. 16) kg DM per day), with chopping reducing intake of stover offered at 50 g/kg M per day. Increased intakes were associated with increased growth rate. In both experiments refused stover contained less leaf-plus-sheath than offered stover but the difference was more pronounced in rams compared with steers indicating the superior selective ability of the rams. In rams offered unchopped stover, the increase in stover intake with increasing amount offered was accounted for by a proportional 1. 03 unit increase in consumption of leaf-plus-sheath and a 0. 06 unit reduction in intake of stem. Doubling the amount of unchopped stover offered increased intake of both rams and steers by 0. 27 unit. Chopping stover was clearly beneficial for rams but not for steers. Doubling the amount of stover offered is a simple excess-feeding strategy to apply. Excess feeding also increases the proportion of stover refused from about 0. 2 to 0. 5, thus generating an uneaten residue available for other purposes, e. g. mulch or compost...|$|E
