40|$|Modern {{hospital}} sterile service departments (SSDs) routinely inspect instruments visually {{to assess}} the degree of contamination present after the washer/disinfector cycle. We aimed to test the effectiveness and reliability of this method. Surgical instrument sets were obtained from nine anonymous National Health Service (NHS) Primary Care Trust SSDs to investigate the efficacy of ‘in-place’ cleaning procedures. The instruments were first inspected visually, followed by a novel technique called episcopic differential interference contrast microscopy. This was combined with a sensitive fluorescent reagent, SYPRORuby, to rapidly visualise and assess contamination levels on the medical devices. The application of a Contamination Index (0 e 4) for both proteinaceous and non-proteinaceous deposits on the surface allowed quantitative assessment. Close correlation was seen for simple instruments between visual assessment and microscopic analysis. For more complex instruments,however, there was a marked {{difference between the two}} assessment techniques and the microscopy procedure showed areas of proteinaceous and non-proteinaceous <b>crystalline</b> <b>soiling</b> that was difficult or impossible to see by eye. Visual assessment of cleaning is fraught with possible error. This survey shows how large amounts of contamination could pass undetected using such antiquated methods. The new methodology applied in the assessment of surface contamination is rapid and generally applicable and could be used more widely for routine monitoring of instrument cleanliness. <br/...|$|R
50|$|Geologically {{the north}} part of Seoni {{consists}} of trap hills {{and the south}} of <b>crystalline</b> rock. The <b>soil</b> of the plateaus is the rich black cotton soil formed by disintegrated trap, of which {{about two-thirds of the}} district are said to consist; but towards the south, where cliffs of gneiss and other primitive formations occur, the soil is siliceous and contains a large proportion of clay.|$|R
40|$|Soil {{crystallinity}} {{is largely}} determined by leaching rates, as high leaching rates favor the rapid precipitation of short order or poorly-crystalline phases like the aluminosilicate allophane. High leaching rates can occur {{due to high}} precipitation rates, seasonal monsoons, or weathering of glass, but are also caused by the rapid onset of seasonal melting of snow and ice in cold environments. Thus, cold climate soils are commonly dominated by poorly crystalline phases, which mature into kaolin minerals over time. Thus, we hypothesize that, in some contexts, soils with high abundances of poorly crystalline phases could indicate formation under cold climatic conditions. This model could be helpful in interpreting the poorly-constrained paleoclimate of ancient Mars, as the crystallinity of ancient soils and soil-derived sediments appears to be highly variable in time and space. While strong signatures of crystalline phyllosilicates {{have been identified in}} possible ancient paleosols on Mars, Mars Science Laboratory rover investigations of diverse ancient sediments at Gale Crater has shown that they can contain very high abundances (40 - 50 wt%) of poorly crystalline phases. We hypothesize that these poorly crystalline phases could be the result of weathering by ice/snow melt, perhaps providing support for sustained cold climates on early Mars punctuated by more limited warm climates. Furthermore, such poorly <b>crystalline</b> <b>soils</b> could be highly fertile growth media for future human exploration and colonization on Mars. To test this hypothesis, we are currently using rover-like instrumentation to investigate the mineralogy and chemistry of weathering products generated by snow and ice melt in a Mars analog alpine environment: the glaciated Three Sisters volcanic complex in central Oregon. Alteration in this glacial environment generates high abundances of poorly crystalline phases, many of which have compositions distinct from those identified in previous terrestrial investigations, and perhaps more similar to poorly crystalline phases identified on Mars...|$|R
40|$|Petrographic modal {{analyses}} of polished grain mounts of fractions in the 20 to 250 micron size range from Luna 24 soil samples are presented {{and used to}} infer the nature and relative contributions of source rocks.

Electron probe analysis of glass particles reveals principle clusters conforming to anorthosite, anorthositic gabbro and mare basalts. More than half of the soil is composed of monomineralic particles, with pyroxene as the most abundant mineral. It is concluded that 85 % of the regolith is derived from local mare basalts and gabbros and about 10 % is derived from early cumulates of local mare basalt magma.

On the other hand, the ash from bagasse cleaned and processed in laboratory has potassium chloride and potassium sulfate as principal the crystalline phases, and SiO 2 as a minor phase. Analysis from scanning electron microscopy of the surface of ash samples from mill bagasse heat treated at 1350 °C for 20  minutes showed that the fine fraction of the ashes melt at this temperature and act as flux for coarse quartz sintering. This can cause aggregation of SiO 2 on the bottom wall of the gasifier that can compromise the process when using sugarcane bagasse as biomass for gasification.

30|$|Soil acidity and low {{availability}} of phosphorous (P) {{are among the}} major problems limiting crop production in the highlands of Ethiopia where high rainfall, nutrient leaching, and soil erosion are more prevalent (Asmare et al. 2015). When soil pH drops below 5, active form of Al becomes soluble and results in reduced nutrient uptake (Achalu 2014). Reports from numerous experiments in P-deficient soils in the highlands of east Africa indicate that the inorganic form of P assessed by the Olsen method is less than 5  mg P kg− 1 soil (Ikerra 2004).

40|$|In {{the present}} work, {{the use of}} ball milling for {{remediation}} of heavy metals contaminated soils of sandy, bentonitic and kaolinitic type is investigated. Immobilization of heavy metals (Cd(II), Pb(II), Zn(II)) is achieved by mechanically treating the contaminated soil without additives, thus taking advantage of weak transformations induced on the soil by mechanical loads occurring during collisions among the milling spheres. The degree of heavy metal immobilization is evaluated by analyzing the corresponding leachable fraction from the treated soil as obtained through the “synthetic precipitation leaching procedure” SPLP. The reduction of leachable fraction of heavy metals from the synthetic soils investigated, was obtained under specific milling regimes. XRD, SEM/EDS and granulometric analyses do not reveal alterations of the intrinsic character of sandy and bentonitic soils after milling. The increase of immobilization efficiency when soils are mechanically treated {{may be due to}} specific phenomena induced during ball milling such as the formation of new fresh surfaces (through particle breakage) onto which heavy metals may be irreversibly adsorbed as well as entrapment of heavy metals into aggregates.

40|$|Spectral and {{angle of}} {{incidence}} (AOI) losses on naturally <b>soiled</b> <b>crystalline</b> silicon photovoltaic (PV) modules have been investigated in this study. The test modules designated as "moderately soiled (3 g/m(2)) " and " heavily soiled (74. 6 g/m(2)) " showed short-circuit current (I-sc) losses of about 10 % and 41 %, respectively. The spectral reflectance and quantum efficiency (QE) losses were also quantitatively determined. In the wavelength range of 350 - 1100 nm, the average reflectance of moderately and heavily soiled modules increased (as compared with the clean surface) by 58. 4 % and 87. 2 %, respectively. In the moderately soiled module, the 26. 3 % (average) reduction in QE is mainly because of 23 % of absorption and 5. 5 % of reflection in the dust. In the highly soiled module, the 75. 3 % (average) reduction in QE is mainly because of 62 % of absorption and 31 % of reflection in the dust particles. It is also seen that the typical critical AOI of 57 degrees for cleaned PV modules decreased to 38 degrees for the moderately soiled module and 20 degrees for the heavily soiled module. This influence is crucial for fixed tilt modules as they experience {{a wide range of}} AOI during daily operation, and a significant fraction of energy is generated at higher AOIs...|$|R
40|$|A large {{source of}} {{uncertainty}} in present {{understanding of the}} global carbon cycle is the distribution and dynamics of the soil organic carbon reservoir, Most of the organic carbon in soils is; degraded to inorganic forms slowly, on timescales from centuries to millennia(1). Soil minerals are known to play a stabilizing role, but how spatial and temporal variation in soil mineralogy controls the quantity and turnover of long-residence-time organic carbon is not well known(2). Here we use radiocarbon analyses to explore interactions between soil mineralogy and soil organic carbon along two natural gradients-of soil-age and of climate-in volcanic soil environments, During the first similar to 150, 000 years of soil development, the volcanic parent material weathered to metastable, non-crystalline minerals, Thereafter, the amount of non-crystalline minerals declined, and more stable <b>crystalline</b> minerals accumulated. <b>Soil</b> organic carbon content followed a similar trend, accumulating to a maximum after 150, 000 years, and then decreasing by 50 % {{over the next four}} million years. A positive relationship between non-crystalline minerals and organic carbon was also observed in soils through the climate gradient, indicating that the accumulation and subsequent loss of organic matter were largely driven by changes in the millennial scale cycling of mineral-stabilized carbon, rather than by changes in the amount of fast-cycling organic matter or in net primary productivity. Soil mineralogy is therefore important in determining the quantity of organic carbon stored in soil, its turnover time, and atmosphere-ecosystem carbon fluxes during long-term soil development; this conclusion should be generalizable at least to other humid environments...|$|R
40|$|Soils of the 62 -cm deep Apollo 16 {{double drive}} tube 60013 / 14 are mature {{at the top}} and submature at the bottom. Modal {{analyses}} of 5529 grains from the 90 - 150 micrometers and the 500 - 1000 micrometers fractions from 12 levels of the core show that, in general, agglutinate abundance increases somewhat monotonically to the top and mimics the Is/FeO profile. There is a general decrease in the modal abundance of monomineralic fragments towards the top, suggesting that agglutinates were formed in part at the expense of monomineralic grains, especially feldspars, which are by far the most abundant mineral in these soils. In detail, the top 27 cm of the core differs from the bottom 21 cm, and the middle 14 cm is intermediate in its properties. In the upper segment, variations in the abundances of feldspars correspond with those of feldspathic fragmental breccias and cataclastic anorthosites; in the bottom segment, a similar but weak correspondence between feldspars and crystalline matrix breccias is observed. Mixing of the comminuted products of these three rock types likely produced the bulk of the core material. Many single feldspars in all size fractions are remarkably fresh, show no damage from shock, and are similar in appearance to the large feldspars in anorthosites and feldspathic fragmental breccias, which we consider to be the primary sources of single feldspars in this core. Major (Na, Al, Si, K, Ca) and minor (Fe, Ba) element analyses of 198 single feldspar grains indicate the presence of only one population of feldspars, which is consistent with our interpretation of feldspar provenance. Classification of 890 monomineralic feldspar, olivine, pyroxene, and glass spherules {{on the basis of the}} presence or absence of thin brownish coating [...] related to reworking at the surface [...] shows that coated grains are much more abundant in the top segment than in the bottom segment. A comparison with the mixing and maturation model (McKay et al., 1977) of soils in the core 60009 / 10, some 60 m away from 60013 / 14, shows that mixtures of an immature, nearly pure plagioclase soil (dominant in 60009 / 10) and another immature, <b>crystalline</b> breccia-rich <b>soil</b> (dominant in 60013 / 14) may have matured through in situ reworking to produce the soils under investigation. We conclude that the soils in this core are products of mixing along soil evolution Path 2 of McKay et al. (1974). Superimposed on that soil column is the reworking of the upper part, which has evolved more recently along Path 1. This core thus represents a consanguineous column of the lunar regolith with an upper reworked segment...|$|R

Immobilization of heavy metals (Cd(II), Pb(II), Zn(II)) is achieved by mechanically treating the contaminated soil with or without additives, {{by taking advantage of}} weak transformations induced on the soil through mechanical loads occurring during collisions in the milling process. When hydroxylapatite (HA) is added to the heavy metal contaminated soil, the corresponding immobilization efficiency of the mechanochemical treatment increases. The degree of metal immobilization is evaluated by analyzing the leachable fraction of heavy metal from the treated soil as obtained through the “synthetic precipitation leaching procedure”. In particular, for soils contaminated by heavy metals displaying concentration levels similar to field contaminated soils, specific ball-milling treatments without the use of hydroxylapatite were able to reduce the leachable fraction of heavy metals to levels lower than the USEPA regulatory thresholds. XRD, SEM/EDS and granulometric analyses reveal no significant alterations of the intrinsic character of sandy and bentonitic soils after milling except for a partial amorphization of the treated soil. On the other hand, the mechanical treatment causes the total amorphization of kaolinitic soil. The increase of immobilization efficiency when soils are mechanically treated is hypothesised to be due to the specific phenomena induced during ball milling such as entrapment of heavy metals into aggregates, solid diffusion into the <b>crystalline</b> reticulum of <b>soil</b> particles as well as the formation of new fresh surfaces (through particle breakage) onto which heavy metals may be irreversibly adsorbed.

40|$|In {{the present}} work, {{the use of}} ball milling {{reactors}} for the remediation of lead contaminated soils was investigated. Lead immobilization was achieved {{without the use of}} additional reactants but only through the exploitation of weak transformations induced on the treated soil by mechanical loads taking place during collisions among milling media. The degree of metal immobilization was evaluated by. analyzing the leachable fraction of Pb(II) obtained through the "synthetic precipitation leaching procedure". The reduction of leachable Pb(II) from certain synthetic soils, i. e., bentonitic, sandy and kaolinitc ones, was obtained under specific milling regimes. For example, for the case of bentonitic soils characterized by a Pb(II) concentration in the solid phase equal to 954. 4 mg kg(- 1), leachable Pb(II) was reduced, after 7 h of mechanical treatment, from 1. 3 mg l(- 1) to a concentration lower than the USEPA regulatory threshold (i. e., 0. 015 mg l(- 1) for drinkable water). Similar results were obtained for sandy and kaolinitic soils. X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, electron dispersive spectroscopy and granulometric analyses revealed no significant,alterations of the intrinsic character of sandy and bentonitic soils after milling except for a relatively small increase of particles size and a partial amorphization of the treated soil. On the other hand, the mechanical treatment caused the total amorphization of kaolinitic soil. The increase of immobilization efficiency can be probably ascribed to specific phenomena induced by mechanical treatment such as entrapment of Pb(II) into aggregates due to aggregation, solid diffusion of Pb(II) into <b>crystalline</b> reticulum of <b>soil</b> particles as well as the formation of new fresh surfaces (through particle breakage) onto which Pb(II) may be irreversibly adsorbed.
