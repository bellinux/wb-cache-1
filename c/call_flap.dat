That year a De Havilland D.H.9 was fitted with slats and flown. Later, a D.H.4 was modified as a monoplane with a large wing fitted with full span leading edge and back ailerons (i.e. what would later be <b>called</b> <b>flaps)</b> that could be deployed in conjunction with the leading-edge slats to test improved low speed performance.

The cruciform-shaped convergent-divergent nozzle turned the flow for thrust vectoring by deflecting the divergent surfaces of the nozzle, <b>called</b> <b>flaps.</b> Methods for eliminating physical interference between pitch and yaw flaps at the larger multiaxis deflection angles was studied. These methods included restricting the pitch flaps from {{the path of the}} yaw flaps and shifting the flow path at the throat off the nozzle centerline to permit larger pitch-flap deflections without interfering with the operation of the yaw flaps. Two flap widths were tested at both dry and afterburning settings. Vertical and reverse thrust configurations at dry power were also tested.

50|$|In {{contrast}} to the pharyngeal flap surgical procedure that optimally serves patients with ample lateral pharyngeal wall adduction, the pharyngoplasty represents a surgical technique more suitable for patients with soft palatal elevation that is unaccompanied by enough lateral pharyngeal wall adduction to affect palatopharyngeal closure. During a pharyngoplasty, incisions are made into the lateral and posterior pharyngeal walls {{in an effort to}} elevate strips of native tissue away from its normal position. These elevated tissues are <b>called</b> <b>flaps</b> and remain pedicled to their native pharyngeal structures as a means of maintaining their blood flow. The flaps are strategically sutured into recipient sites where they provide postoperative tissue volume in areas of the lateral oropharynx and nasopharynx believed not to preoperatively adduct enough to realize palatopharyngeal closure. Pharyngoplasty contraindications and complications are not unlike those considered when preparing for pharyngeal flap surgical procedures. Vascular anatomy must be preoperatively assessed and the provision of lateral pharyngeal wall bulkiness carries the risk of inducing obstructive sleep apnea.|$|R
50|$|Grafting is a {{surgical}} procedure to move tissue from one site to {{another on the}} body, or from another person, without bringing its own blood supply with it.

Cocrystal structures suggest that the orthologous part of eukaryotic RNAPII, <b>called</b> the <b>flap</b> loop, contacts transcription factor IIB (TFIIB), but the function of the flap loop has not been assessed. We constructed and tested a deletion of the flap loop in human RNAPII (subunit RPB 2 Î” 873 - 884) that removes the flap loop interaction interface with TFIIB. Genome-wide analysis of the distribution of the RNAPII with the flap loop deletion expressed in a human embryonic kidney cell line (HEK 293) revealed no effect of the flap loop on global transcription initiation, RNAPII occupancy within genes, or the efficiency of promoter escape and productive elongation. In vitro, the flap loop deletion had no effect on promoter binding, abortive initiation or promoter escape, TFIIS-stimulated transcript cleavage, or inhibition of transcript elongation by the complex of negative elongation factor (NELF) and 5, 6 -dichloro- 1 -Î²-d-ribofuranosylbenzimidazole (DRB) sensitivity-inducing factor (DSIF). A modest effect on transcript elongation and pausing was suppressed by TFIIF. Although similar to the flap tip of bacterial RNAP, the RNAPII flap loop is not equivalently essential...|$|R

5000|$|Asterixis (also <b>called</b> the <b>flapping</b> tremor, or liver flap) is {{a tremor}} {{of the hand}} when the wrist is extended, {{sometimes}} said to resemble a bird flapping its wings. This motor disorder is characterized by an inability to maintain a position, which is demonstrated by jerking movements of the outstretched hands when bent upward at the wrist. The tremor is caused by abnormal function of the diencephalic motor centers in the brain, which regulate the muscles involved in maintaining position. Asterixis is associated with various encephalopathies due especially to faulty metabolism. The term derives from the Greek a, [...] "not" [...] and stÄ“rixis, [...] "fixed position".|$|R
5000|$|Juan de la Cierva {{developed}} the fully articulating rotor for the autogyro. The {{basis of his}} design permitted successful helicopter development. In a fully articulated rotor system, each rotor blade {{is attached to the}} rotor hub through a series of hinges that let the blade move independently of the others. These rotor systems usually have three or more blades. The blades are allowed to flap, feather, and lead or lag independently of each other. The horizontal hinge, <b>called</b> the <b>flapping</b> hinge, allows the blade to move up and down. This movement is <b>called</b> <b>flapping</b> and is designed to compensate for dissymmetry of lift. The flapping hinge may be located at varying distances from the rotor hub, and there may be more than one hinge. The vertical hinge, called the lead-lag hinge or drag hinge, allows the blade to move back and forth. This movement is called lead-lag, dragging, or hunting. Dampers are usually used to prevent excess back and forth movement around the drag hinge. The purpose of the drag hinge and dampers is to compensate for acceleration and deceleration caused by the Coriolis effect. Later models have switched from using traditional bearings to elastomeric bearings. Elastomeric bearings are naturally fail-safe and their wear is gradual and visible. The metal-to-metal contact of older bearings and the need for lubrication is eliminated in this design. The third hinge in the fully articulated system is called the feathering hinge about the feathering axis. This hinge is responsible for the change in pitch of rotor blades excited via pilot input to the Collective or Cyclic.A variation of the fully articulated system is the [...] "soft-in-plane" [...] rotor system. This type of rotor can be found on several aircraft produced by Bell Helicopter, such as the OH-58D Kiowa Warrior. This system is similar to the fully articulated type in that each blade has the ability to lead/lag and hunt independent of the other blades. The difference between a fully articulated system and soft-in-plane system is that the soft-in-plane system utilizes a composite yoke. This yoke is attached to the mast and runs through the blade grips between the blades and the shear bearing inside the grip. This yoke does transfer some movement of one blade to another, usually opposing blades. While this is not fully articulated, the flight characteristics are very similar and maintenance time and cost are reduced.|$|R
40|$|Objectives: Severe hepatic {{encephalopathy}} {{gives rise to}} asterixis, a striking motor symptom also <b>called</b> <b>flapping</b> tremor, which {{is characterized by a}} sudden ceasing of muscle tone in all muscles of a limb. In this study, we aimed at scrutinizing the cortical activation associated with asterixis and unraveling the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms. Material and methods: We recorded simultaneously neural activity with magnetoencephalography (MEG) and muscle activity with surface EMG in nine patients with manifest {{hepatic encephalopathy}} showing asterixis. Asterixis events were detected semiautomatically and served as triggers for averaging MEG signals. Evoked responses averaged time-locked to asterixis events were subjected to equivalent current dipole (ECD) modeling. Additionally, we localized the strongest cortico-muscular coherence in the frequency of the co-occurring tremulousness. Results: Evoked fields averaged time-locked to asterixis events were best explained by a single dipolar source in the contralateral primary motor cortex (M 1, Talairach coordinates of mean localization: âˆ’ 40, âˆ’ 20, and 64; Brodmann area 4). This dipole showed a twofold field reversal, that is biphasic wave, with frontal dipole orientation at 49 Â ms before flap onset and 99 Â ms after flap onset. Conversely, two maxima with occipital dipole orientation were observed 2 Â ms and 160 Â ms after flap onset. Cortico-muscular coherence for the tremulousness was likewise localized in the contralateral M 1 confirming earlier findings in the present patient cohort. Conclusions: Our results reveal an involvement of M 1 in the generation of asterixis. As also tremulousness, also called mini-asterixis, was shown to originate in M 1, asterixis and mini-asterixis may share common pathophysiological mechanisms...|$|R
