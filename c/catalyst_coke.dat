The combustion of the coke is exothermic and it produces {{a large amount of}} heat that is partially absorbed by the regenerated catalyst and provides the heat required for the vaporization of the feedstock and the endothermic cracking reactions that take place in the catalyst riser.

40|$|The optimal {{performance}} of a reforming process is a direct function of the coking deactivation of its catalyst; hence the need to establish a fundamental relationship between the macroscopic (measurable) catalyst activity and the coke content.

The characterizations of catalysts reveal the presence of very well dispersed PtOx in the ceria that, during the calcination step, is stabilized in the highest oxidation state, in contrast with Al 2 O 3.

40|$|The final {{publication}} {{is available}} at www. springerlink. com. Fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) of heavy ends to high value liquid fuels is a common unit operation in oil refineries. In this process the heavy feedstock which contains sulphur is cracked to light products. Sulphur content is hence redistributed in the liquid and gaseous products and coke of the catalyst used in this process. The coke is later burnt in the regenerator releasing sulphur into the discharged flue gas as SO 2. In the present work, comprehensive emission inventories for a FCC unit in a typical oil refinery are prepared.

The present work reports how tailored coke deposition on the catalyst surface can suppress undesired reactions such as cracking to benzene and coke during ethylbenzene dehydrogenation. Additionally, this approach also provides insights into the precursor molecules involved {{in the formation of}} carbonaceous deposits, hence providing further understanding of coke formation. Pre-coked catalysts were prepared by adsorbing the products of the ethylbenzene reaction (i. e., benzene, toluene, styrene, ethylene) as single components, in a flowing system at 600 [degree]C over the fresh catalyst. The resulting pre-coked catalysts were then evaluated in the ethylbenzene dehydrogenation reaction and their performance compared with that of the catalyst without exposure to pre-treatment. Characterisation of pre-coked catalysts by elemental analysis, temperature-programmed oxidation (TPO), temperature-programmed desorption (TPD), Raman spectroscopy and diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) indicated that ethylene is the main coke precursor during ethylbenzene dehydrogenation and that ethylene-derived coke is associated with a reduction in selectivity to styrene as compared to the fresh <b>catalyst.</b> <b>Coke</b> deposited after pre-coking with aromatic molecules, and in particular with benzene, was beneficial for dehydrogenation activity, as shown by the increase in styrene selectivity relative to the fresh catalyst.

D.), Washington State UniversityBiomass {{is one of}} the {{important}} renewable energy sources which are used to produce carbon-based liquid fuels through biochemical and thermochemical methods. The bio–oil from the biomass pyrolysis is an intermediate and requires upgrading. Catalyst coking is the most difficult challenge during the upgrading process, and results in low hydrocarbon yield and short catalyst life time. Compared with other methods for reducing catalyst coking such as high temperature baking and co-feeding hydrogen, a new route by liquid–liquid extraction to separate chemical compounds in mixture has been established in this study. First of all, the liquid-liquid extraction process using chloroform solvent on raw pyrolysis oil successfully separated chemical compounds by their properties and polarities with high extracting yield and admirable effect on chemical distribution. The acid, aldehyde and unpyrolyzed sugar can be completely removed from the bio–oil mixture. Secondly, an esterification process over the acid-rich water phase of pyrolysis oil achieved acid conversion over 89 % of by completely randomized design with temperature and catalyst loading factors. The esterification process followed the Langmuir–Hinshelwood mechanism and reaction constants were calculated to build a practical esterification model for acid compounds. Additionally, dimethyl acetal was also produced by acetalization on the water phase via acetalization. Products determined by HPLC and GC−MS represented similar Langmuir–Hinshelwood mechanism kinetics to esterification, while moisture and acid content in the feedstock are the main inhibitors for the process. Finally, raw bio–oil and liquid–liquid extracted bio–oil on ZSM– 5 catalytic cracking was compared to illustrate our new pathway to solve catalyst coking. Temperature played an important role on increasing gaseous product and hydrocarbon yield as shown by GC−MS and Micro−GC analysis. Less <b>catalyst</b> <b>coke</b> and longer catalyst lives were achieved on liquid–liquid extracted bio–oil than raw bio–oil, indicating significant positive results on reducing catalyst coking.

In this thesis, {{the results of}} investigations into the structure and distribution of <b>coke,</b> on hydrocracking <b>catalysts,</b> are reported. The material consists of zeolite Y, alumina binder as well as tungsten and nickel sulfide. An extensive investigation regarding {{the preparation of the}} catalysts for electron microscopy was carried out. It was established that microtoming produced specimen damage and hence regions of porosity, zeolite and alumina binder were difficult to identify. Single beam and dual beam focused ion beam (FIB) milling produced intact specimens and the spatial distribution of the catalysts was maintained, although thinner specimens were obtained using the latter technique. Energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) mapping identified gallium and platinum as artefacts in specimens that had been prepared by a single beam FIB system. In addition, argon ion beam milling was used and this technique produced large regions of thin material. Energy-filtered transmission electron microscopy (EFTEM) was employed to reveal the distribution of carbon in the catalyst. Carbon was identified on alumina binder, zeolite grains and meso-/macro-pores, although the distribution of carbon was generally not uniform as it is determined by the density and strength of acid sites, geometry of pores and the proximity of metal sulfide crystallites. All of these factors, especially pores size and shape, vary in the <b>catalysts.</b> <b>Coke</b> is thought to consist of polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). Electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS), of selected PAH standards, was performed to obtain the electron energy-loss near edge structure (ELNES) of carbon. In addition, the ELNES of four PAHs was modelled using multiple scatter calculations. EELS of the catalysts revealed that PAHs are present on zeolitic components but ELNES was not identified on the alumina binder. This is possibly because alumina contains larger pores than zeolite Y; therefore larger molecules can diffuse into the alumina structure, which increases the chemical variety of the coke species as the molecules are not sterically impeded.

3000|$|In Fig.  2, it {{was assumed}} that {{chemical}} reactions are the rate-determining steps, and that catalytic cracking of vacuum residue and other reactions are irreversible first-order. All reactions take place in the gas phase. Moreover, mass transfer resistance between the reacting fluid and the catalyst are incorporated in the kinetic model, as against previous works in the literature. The specific reaction rate constant, k_r ([...] = k_i,j [...]), of the reaction from lump i to lump j as depicted in Fig.  2 was modified by multiplying each of them by the effectiveness factor, η, and the parallel additive of rate constants and mass transfer coefficient, k_g was used to determine the overall rate constant for the reaction of lump i to lump j, as given in Eqs. (9) or (10). Equally, heat transfer resistance between the reacting fluid and the solid (<b>catalyst</b> and <b>coke)</b> was considered in the energy balance for the riser reactor, as expressed in Eqs. (63), (64), and (69).|$|R
40|$|Biomass {{gasification}} is {{an effective}} way to produce syngas that must be conditioned to remove the main pollutants (tars) for its use in energy production systems. Catalytic steam reforming of tar and CH 4 is thus necessary; Nickel catalysts are excellent candidates but still have deactivation problems related to carbon deposition and sulphur poisoning. Various studies demonstrated that Mayenite as binder for Nickel has free oxygen ions that protect the <b>catalyst</b> from <b>coke</b> formation and H 2 S poisoning. Similar studies are carried out only with tar representative compounds (e. g. toluene); here the catalyst was tested with real syngas from biomass gasification containing CH 4, benzene and tars. Ni/Mayenite was synthesized with citrate sol-gel method, characterized (XRD, BET, SEM, XRF), tested for 50 h and again characterized in order to study its degradation. Heavier tars were 100 % converted; lower tars were converted with high rate; CH 4 showed a decrease in conversion after 2 h...|$|R
40|$|Carbon dioxide {{reforming}} {{of methane}} to synthesis gas over Ni supported alumina catalysts was investigated at atmospheric pressure. Two supports: high surface area γ-Al 2 O 3 (SA- 6175) and low surface α-Al 2 O 3 (SA- 5239) {{were used for}} the preparation of catalysts by the wet impregnation method. The reforming reactions were carried out using (CO 2 :CH 4) feed ratio of 1 : 1, and reaction temperatures 500, 600, 700 and 800 °C. Influences of Ni loading, <b>catalyst</b> stability, <b>coke</b> deposition and synthesis gas ratio (H 2 /CO) were studied. Spent and fresh catalysts calcined at 900 °C were characterized by XRD, SEM and TGA techniques. It was observed that increasing Ni loading increases the formation of carbon. For high surface area catalyst, at low Ni loading, no coke formation on the catalyst was obtained. Similarly, no carbon formation was observed for low surface catalyst at 800 °C reaction temperature with feed ratio of 1. 3 / 1. 0...|$|R
40|$|Catalytic {{deactivation}} {{caused by}} coking was studied in ZSM 5 and zeolite Y catalysts during the isomerisation of 1 -hexene under sub and supercritical conditions. The effects of varying temperature and pressure, from 220 – 250 °C and 10 - 70 bar respectively, on conversion and coke deposition were studied in both zeolites. TGA, DRIFTS, nitrogen sorption isotherms for fresh and <b>coked</b> <b>catalysts</b> and catalyst acidity measurements were compared. In ZSM 5 the catalyst was stable for 96 hours. TGA and DRIFTS results show coke deposits were mainly polyolefinic {{and the amount}} decreases considerably from 18. 8 wt% in the subcritical region to 10 wt% in the supercritical region. In zeolite Y, decay in conversion was observed with the rate of deactivation being slower at supercritical conditions at 235 °C and 40 bar. Naphthalene hydrogenation on NiMo/γ-Al 2 O 3 catalyst was also studied. The effect of temperature, pressure, varying naphthalene feed concentration and operating in sub and supercritical conditions were studied. Coke deposit decreased by 38 wt% in the supercritical region. SC CO 2 (Tc 31. 04 °C, Pc 73. 8 bar) was also used to re-activate the <b>coked</b> <b>catalysts.</b> This resulted in recovering 93 % of the catalytic activity and 37 % of the coke was effectively extracted by SC CO 2.
