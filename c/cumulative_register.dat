This single VLSI device, known as the Parallel Integrated Frame Synchronizer (PIFS) chip, integrates most of the functionality contained in high density 9 U VME card frame synchronizer subsystems currently in use. In 1987, a first generation 20 Mbps VMEBus frame synchronizer based on 2. 0 micron CMOS VLSI technology was developed by Data Systems Technology Division. In 1990, this subsystem architecture was recast using 0. 8 micron ECL & GaAs VLSI to achieve 300 Mbps performance. The PIFS chip, based on 0. 7 micron CMOS technology, will provide a superset of the current VMEBus subsystem functions at rates up to 500 Mbps at approximately one-tenth current replication costs. Functions performed by this third generation device include true and inverted 64 bit marker correlation with programmable error tolerances, programmable frame length and marker patterns, programmable search-check-lock-flywheel acquisition strategy, slip detection, and CRC error detection. Acquired frames can optionally be annotated with quality trailer and time stamp. A comprehensive set of <b>cumulative</b> accounting <b>registers</b> are provided on-chip for data quality monitoring. Prototypes of the PIFS chip are expected in October 1995. This paper will describe the architecture and implementation of this new low-cost high functionality device...|$|R

40|$|Peptide-MHC (pMHC) ligand {{engagement}} by T-cell receptors (TCRs) elicits {{a variety}} of cellular responses, some of which require substantially more TCR-mediated stimulation than others. This threshold hierarchy could reside at the receptor level, where different response pathways branch off {{at different stages of}} the TCR/CD 3 triggering cascade, or at the cellular level, where the <b>cumulative</b> TCR signal <b>registered</b> by the T-cell is compared to different threshold values. Alternatively, dual-level thresholds could exist. In this study, we show that the cellular hypothesis provides the most parsimonious explanation consistent with data obtained from an in-depth analysis of distinct functional responses elicited in a clonal T-cell system by a spectrum of biophysically defined altered peptide ligands across a range of concentrations. Further, we derive a mathematical model that describes how ligand density, affinity, and off-rate all affect signaling in distinct ways. However, under the kinetic regime prevailing in the experiments reported here, the TCR/pMHC class I (pMHCI) dissociation rate was found to be the main governing factor. The CD 8 coreceptor modulated the TCR/pMHCI interaction and altered peptide ligand potency. Collectively, these findings elucidate the relationship between TCR/pMHCI kinetics and cellular function, thereby providing an integrated mechanistic understanding of T-cell response profiles...|$|R
40|$|Background. Commonly used inhalational hypnotics, such as sevoflurane, are pro-inflammatory, {{whereas the}} {{intravenously}} administered hypnotic agent propofol is anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative. A few clinical {{studies have indicated}} similar effects in patients. We examined the possible association between patient survival after radical cancer surgery {{and the use of}} sevoflurane or propofol anaesthesia. Patients and methods. Demographic, anaesthetic, and surgical data from 2, 838 patients registered for surgery for breast, colon, or rectal cancers were included in a database. This was record-linked to regional clinical quality <b>registers.</b> <b>Cumulative</b> 1 - and 5 -year overall survival rates were assessed using the Kaplan–Meier method, and estimates were compared between patients given propofol (n = 903) or sevoflurane (n = 1, 935). In a second step, Cox proportional hazard models were calculated to assess the risk of death adjusted for potential effect modifiers and confounders. Results. Differences in overall 1 - and 5 -year survival rates for all three sites combined were 4. 7 % (p = 0. 004) and 5. 6 % (p < 0. 001), respectively, in favour of propofol. The 1 -year survival for patients operated for colon cancer was almost 10 % higher after propofol anaesthesia. However, after adjustment for several confounders, the observed differences were not statistically significant. Conclusion. Propofol anaesthesia might be better in surgery for some cancer types, but the retrospective design of this study, with uneven distributions of several confounders, distorted the picture. These uncertainties emphasize the need for a randomized controlled trial...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Experimental {{animal studies}} and one {{population-based}} study have suggested {{an increased risk}} for adverse neurodevelopmental outcome after prenatal exposure to SSRIs. We describe the methods and design of a population-based study examining the association between prenatal SSRI exposure and neurodevelopment until age 14. Methods and design This is a cohort study of national registers in Finland: the Medical Birth Register, the Register of Congenital Malformations, the Hospital Discharge Register including inpatient and outpatient data, the Drug Reimbursement Register, and the Population Register. The total study population includes 845, 345 women and their live-born, singleton offspring aged 14 or younger and born during Jan 1 st 1996 -Dec 31 st 2010. We will compare the prevalence of psychiatric and neurodevelopmental outcomes in offspring exposed prenatally to SSRIs to offspring exposed to prenatal depression and unexposed to SSRIs. Associations between exposure and outcome are assessed by statistical methods including specific modeling to account for correlated outcomes within families and differences in duration of follow-up between the exposure groups. Descriptive results. Of all pregnant women with pregnancy ending in delivery (n[*]=[*] 859, 359), 1. 9 % used SSRIs. The prevalence of diagnosed depression and depression-related psychiatric disorders within one year before or during pregnancy was 1. 7 %.

40|$|Introduction In Denmark, the {{magnitude}} and impact of work disability on the individual worker and society has prompted {{the development of a}} new "coordinated and tailored work rehabilitation" (CTWR) approach. The aim of this study was to compare the effects of CTWR with conventional case management (CCM) on return-to-work of workers on sick leave due to musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs). Methods The study was a randomized controlled trial with economic evaluation undertaken with workers on sick leave for 4 - 12 weeks due to MSDs. CTWR consists of a work disability screening by an interdisciplinary team followed by the collaborative development of a RTW plan. The primary outcome variable was <b>registered</b> <b>cumulative</b> sickness absence hours during 12 months follow-up. Secondary outcomes were work status as well as pain intensity and functional disability, measured at baseline, 3 and 12 months follow-up. The economic evaluation (intervention costs, productivity loss, and health care utilization costs) was based on administrative data derived from national registries. Results For the time intervals 0 - 6 months, 6 - 12 months, and the entire follow-up period, the number of sickness absence hours was significantly lower in the CTWR group as compared to the control group. The total costs saved in CTWR participants compared to controls were estimated at US $ 1, 366 per person at 6 months follow-up and US $ 10, 666 per person at 12 months follow-up. Conclusions Workers on sick leave for 4 - 12 weeks due to MSD who underwent "CTWR" by an interdisciplinary team had fewer sickness absence hours than controls. The economic evaluation showed that-in terms of productivity loss-CTWR seems to be cost saving for the society...|$|R

The cohort comprised all individuals diagnosed with a first-time subdural hematoma in Denmark 1996 - 2011. Information on potential predictors was retrieved from the Danish health <b>registers.</b> <b>Cumulative</b> recurrence risks were estimated using the Aalen-Johansen estimator.

The cumulative risk of recurrent subdural hematoma was 9 % at 4 weeks after the primary bleeding, increasing to and stabilising at 14 % after one year. Predictors associated with recurrence were: Male sex (RR 1. 60, 95 % CI: 1. 43 - 1. 80), older age (> 70 years compared to 20 - 49 years; RR 1. 41, 95 % CI: 1. 21 - 1. 65), alcohol addiction (RR 1. 20, 95 % CI: 1. 04 - 1. 37), surgical treatment (RR 1. 76, 95 % CI: 1. 58 - 1. 96), trauma diagnoses (RR 1. 14, 95 % CI: 1. 03 - 1. 27), and diabetes mellitus (RR 1. 40, 95 % CI: 1. 11 - 1. 74). Out of a selected combination of risk factors, the highest cumulative 1 -year recurrence risks for subdural hematoma of 25 % (compared to 14 % for all patients) was found in surgically treated males with diabetes mellitus.

40|$|We {{present a}} population-based, {{longitudinal}} study of all incident cases (N = 538) of schizophrenia in the London Borough of Camberwell between 1964 and 1984. Cases were selected from the Camberwell <b>Cumulative</b> Psychiatric Case <b>Register.</b> Case-notes were obtained, and further classified using a computerized operational check list for rating psychotic illness. Cases are not restricted to hospital discharges, as in previous studies, and account is taken of time at liberty to offend. In order {{to test the hypothesis}} that schizophrenia makes an independent contribution to criminality over other mental disorders, controls were chosen to be representative of nonschizophrenic mental disorders matched for age, sex and period. The rate of conviction is increased in women with schizophrenia compared to other mental disorders for most offence categories (rate ratio = 3. 3). In men overall rates do not differ (rate ratio = 1. 03), although there is an interaction between gender, schizophrenia and ethnicity, with young black men with schizophrenia being most at risk. The rate ratio for violent offences in men with schizophrenia is 3. 8, confirming recent studies from Sweden. Subjects with schizophrenia were more likely to acquire any criminal record than those with other mental disorders. The rate of lifetime conviction was greater in those with schizophrenia than either a sample of working-class boys from the same area followed by Farrington & West, or National data. The risk of first conviction is increased by schizophrenia, unemployment, ethnic group, substance abuse and low social class, and decreased by being employed, married, female and older age of onset. Adjustment using survival analysis showed that schizophrenia made a small independent contribution to the risk of acquiring a criminal record (hazard ratio = 1. 4) but gender, substance abuse, ethnicity and age of onset were more substantial. Previous criminality was the strongest independent association of post-illness conviction, with schizophrenia only a trend. Although subjects with schizophrenia were more likely to acquire a criminal record, criminal careers began later and were shorter than those of the controls. The risk of criminality increased throughout the study period, but suggestions of a specific increase in those with schizophrenia as a result of changes in community care were not confirmed. These results confirm that women with schizophrenia are at increased risk of acquiring a criminal record, but the effect in men is for violent convictions only. The strongest associations of criminal conviction remain those recognized in non-schizophrenic subjects...|$|R
