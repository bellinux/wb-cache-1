This study presents an experimental investigation on pure micro porous materials from two types of fibres: Date Palm <b>Fibre</b> (DPF) and <b>Coconut</b> <b>Coir</b> <b>Fibre</b> (CCF). This study was conducted to examine the potential for using these two types of fibres as sound absorbers. To account for the effects of the characteristics of these materials, such as thickness and density, on the acoustic absorption coefficient of a sound absorber, the measurements were conducted in an impedance tube on normal incidence acoustic absorption. The experimental data indicate that two peak values of Acoustic Absorption Coefficient (AAC) are 0. 98 at 1381. 25 Hz- 1506. 25 Hz for the 40 mm thick sample and the AAC at high frequency for the same thickness is 0. 99 at 4521. 88 - 4906. 25 Hz; for 20 mm thickness, the peak value is 0. 84 at 2606. 25 - 3025 Hz. The AAC of the CCF sample is 0. 77 at 2434. 38 - 2543. 75 Hz for a 40 mm thickness, but for 20 mm thickness, the value is 0. 71 at 4184. 38 - 4575 Hz. The Acoustic Absorption Coefficients (AAC) of the two types of materials were increased at all frequencies when the thickness of the sample was increased.

During the processing stage, each fibre is reinforced with 60 : 40 ratio of pure latex separately. The fibres are then compressed after the pure latex treatment into circular samples, of 28 mm and 100 mm diameters respectively. The thickness of each sample is fixed at 50 mm. The acoustical performances were evaluated by using an impedance tube instrument. This study also investigates the effect of air gap of 10 mm and 50 mm in the sound absorption performance.

There were two main objective of the research; first is to develop absorption panels from <b>coconut</b> <b>coir</b> powder that available locally with a combination of shredded paper at different percentage of mixture. Second objective is to identify the absorption rate of the panels. The study encompasses the fabrication of the particle board using the coconut husk powder mix with shredded waste paper and using the gypsum powder as the binder for the two materials. Four acoustic panels of size 0. 5 m x 0. 5 m and 0. 012 m thick were fabricated with different mix ratio; 25 % of <b>coconut</b> <b>coir</b> powder mixed with 75 % of shredded waste papers for sample 1, 50 % both of the material for sample 2, 75 % of <b>coconut</b> <b>coir</b> powder mixed with 25 % of shredded waste paper for sample 3, and lastly 100 % of <b>coconut</b> <b>coir</b> powder for sample 4.

Compression moulding was used to produce the composites which consists of seven sample of composites with different fibre loading along with different fibre conditions which are treated coir and untreated <b>coir</b> for <b>fibre</b> loading of 10 %, 20 % and 30 %. Water absorption test such as water uptake and thickness swelling were carried out by immersing the specimens in the water for 24 hours at room condition and the specimens also been put into oven for 24 hours at 1050 C to determine their moisture content. The density of composites was also calculated by using density of <b>coir</b> <b>fibre</b> and polyester resins which are 1. 20 gcm- 3 and 1. 09 gcm- 3.

40|$|In the {{development}} process reinforced concrete {{played an important role}} as a very satisfactory construction material because of durability. An application of reinforced concrete has reached a very advanced stage both in design and construction techniques. Reinforced concrete has been successfully used in horizontal and vertical structures in construction of buildings, bridges, roads, vehicle parks, pavements, dams, bunkers, silos, water retaining structures and many other structures. Cover-crete of concrete has been defined as the concrete outside of the reinforcing bars. The cover-crete is mainly used for resistance to damage by fire and to protect the reinforcements from buckling and twisting at higher temperature. It also offers very good resistance to adverse atmospheric conditions and prevents reinforcements from corrosion. Past researchers have conducted experiments to improve the cover-crete properties with an aim to improve the previously discussed points. Due to applied loads, cover regions some times have been subjected to tensile and bending stress. Due to poor tensile strength of concrete in general, cover-crete may have a cracked region thereby exposing the embedded reinforcing steels. However, except in most severe situations, cover-crete always provide a satisfactory service. The research was conducted to formulate a economical and repeatable method for treatment of cover-crete in general usage and rehabilitation of decayed covercrete too. Experiment Study was carried out to observe the improvement of cover-crete by introducing fibres to concrete mix. Variable parameters are concrete grade, fibre length, fibre percentage and fibre type. In this experiment grade 20 concrete was used in order to model the practical situation as close as possible. Fibre length was limited to 25 mm and fibre percentage was limited to 5 % by volume. Fibre types were natural (coconut fibre), synthetic (nylon), steel (wire mesh). In the first trial of the experiment, eight numbers of specimens of 300 mm x 250 mm x 250 mm dimensions and ten numbers of test cubes of 150 mm x 150 mm x 150 mm dimensions were casted having 100 mm fibre concrete layer {{on the top of the}} eight specimens under the category of normal concrete, wire mesh concrete, <b>coconut</b> <b>coir</b> <b>fibre</b> concrete and nylone fibre concrete.

40|$|In this study, <b>coir</b> <b>fibres</b> {{were studied}} {{for use as}} {{reinforcement}} materials for polymer and cementitious composites. The effect of fibre treatment (i. e. 5 wt. % NaOH solution at 20 Â°C for 30 min) on microstructure and mechanical properties of <b>coir</b> <b>fibre,</b> <b>coir</b> <b>fibre</b> reinforced epoxy (CFRE) and <b>coir</b> <b>fibre</b> reinforced cementitious (CFRC) composites were investigated. Scanning electronic microscope (SEM) {{studies were carried out}} to examine the microstructures of untreated and treated <b>coir</b> <b>fibres,</b> fibre/epoxy and fibre/cement interfaces. Mechanical properties of CFRE were determined by vibration, tensile and flexure tests and mechanical properties of CFRC were determined by compression and four-point bending tests, respectively. The test results show that <b>coir</b> <b>fibre</b> had a much cleaner and rougher fibre surface after the alkali treatment. Compared with the untreated CFRE, treatment improved the tensile and flexural properties of composites, i. e. 17. 8 % and 16. 7 % growth in tensile and flexural strength, respectively. However, the treatment also reduced the damping ratio of the CFRE. The increase in tensile and flexural properties and reduction in damping ratio are attributed to the improvement of fibre and epoxy matrix interfacial adhesion due to the treatment, as displayed by SEM micrographs. Compared with the plain concrete, <b>coir</b> <b>fibre</b> improved the compressive strength, flexural strength and toughness effectively. The treatment can further improve these properties of CFRC. SEM studies clearly confirmed that the failure modes of <b>coir</b> <b>fibres</b> in cement matrix are fibre breakage, fibre pull-out and fibre debonding from the cement matrix. The microstructure of <b>coir</b> <b>fibre,</b> CFRE and CFRC were correlated with their mechanical properties...|$|R

40|$|A {{research}} {{to determine the}} effectiveness of <b>coconut</b> <b>coir</b> blanket in controlling slope erosion was conducted. There were two major division of testing made. One was the material analysis on the soil sample taken and the <b>coconut</b> <b>coir</b> blanket used and another was the simulation of rainfall pouring on sloped surface soil to analyze the erosion rate. Apparently, the division of material testing involved Soil Mechanics Engineering and Light Structure Engineering. Soil Mechanics Engineering assisted this research in soil analyzing {{in terms of the}} Soil Classification, Atterberg Limit, Specific Gravity, Shear Strength, Standard Proctor and Direct Shear testing. On the other hand, Light Structure Engineering focused on Tensile Strength of the <b>coconut</b> <b>coir</b> blanket. Generally, the major testing was the simulation of rainfall on the sloped surface soil. The soil sample which was taken from construction site in Bukit Gambang,. Pahang was distributed into four cases. The parameters manipulated were the degree of slope, type of vegetation and the condition of the slope surface. The selected degree of slope were 0 Â°, 400 and 500. The vegetations planted were based on the norm slopes grasses used which were the Signal Grass and Japanese Millet. The conditions of the slope surface were divided into two. They were bare controlled case and protected slope case using <b>coconut</b> <b>coir</b> blanket. The main parameter which was the application of <b>coconut</b> <b>coir</b> blanket as the protection to the slope was proven effective. By comparing the bare controlled slope and the protected slope, the result showed that protected slope using the <b>coconut</b> <b>coir</b> blanket decreases the erosion rate by the Total Suspended Solids (TSS) test conducted. The bare controlled slope collected 0. 014345 g/L amount of TSS while protected slope using <b>coconut</b> <b>coir</b> blanket collected only 0. 001368 g/L. The difference of 0. 0 12977 g/L TSS amount proved that <b>coconut</b> <b>coir</b> blanket was effective in controlling slope erosion assisted by the vegetation of Signal Grass which has longer leaves and gripping fibre roots in increasing the mode of slope strength. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{aims for}} this study are to examine the {{emulsion}} stability and {{to evaluate the effectiveness}} of using <b>coconut</b> <b>coir</b> in the separation of oil and water (emulsion). Crude oil and distilled water were used as the raw materials. To complete the objective,there are three main (3) parts of experiment need to be done. The first part was the pretreatment of the <b>coconut</b> <b>coir.</b> In this part,the required particle sizes of the coir which varied between 630 Âµm to 2 mm were determined and also had been modified,weighing and packaging. While in the second part the formation and stabilization of the oil-inwater (O/W) emulsion was examined. The O/W ratios were varied from 50 - 75 : 50 - 25 and during the stability part the emulsion was verified by visually observes on separation layer for each of the samples of emulsion. As for the emulsifier, Tween 20 at different concentration 1 %, 3 % and 5 % of total volume was used in formation of O/W emulsion. Last but not least,the last part studied the separation of oil and water by using <b>coconut</b> <b>coir.</b> The optimum condition of O/W emulsion is discovered by the correlation between the emulsifier concentrations,and oil-water ratio. Here,the effectiveness of prepared <b>coconut</b> <b>coir</b> is analyzed in order to adsorbed the raw crude oil,and water by considering the effect of size particles and the modification of the <b>coconut</b> <b>coir.</b> Then,the amount of oil and water being adsorbed and recover from the <b>coconut</b> <b>coir</b> are weighed to see the efficiency of the <b>coconut</b> <b>coir.</b> The most stable of O/W emulsion was found at 5 % of emulsifier concentration at 75 - 25 % of oil-water ratio. The adsorption of oil was better at 630 Âµm particle size of unmodified coir. Therefore,the effectiveness of the <b>coconut</b> <b>coir</b> in order to separate the most stable emulsion into oil and water would be required...|$|R

Bioethanol production from such materials consists {{of more than one}} step. Pretreatment and enzymatic hydrolysis is crucial steps to produce sugar which can then be fermented into bioethanol. In this research, ground <b>coconut</b> <b>coir</b> was pretreated using dilute sulfuric acid at 121 oC. This pretreatment had increased the cellulose content and decreased the lignin content of <b>coconut</b> <b>coir.</b> The pretreated <b>coconut</b> <b>coir</b> was hydrolyzed using a mix of two commercial cellulase enzymes at pH of 4. 8 and temperature of 50 oC. The enzymatic hydrolysis was conducted at several initial <b>coconut</b> <b>coir</b> slurry concentrations (0. 1 - 2 g/ 100 mL) and reaction times (2 - 72 hours). The reducing sugar concentration profiles had been produced and can be used to obtain reaction rates. The highest reducing sugar concentration obtained was 1, 152. 567 mg/L, which was produced at initial slurry concentration of 2 g/ 100 mL and 72 hours reaction time. In this paper, the reducing sugar concentrations were empirically modeled as a function of reaction time using power equations. Michaelis-Menten kinetic model for enzymatic hydrolysis reaction is adopted. The kinetic parameters of that model for sulfuric acid-pretreated <b>coconut</b> <b>coir</b> enzymatic hydrolysis had been obtained which are Vm of 3. 587 x 104 mg/L. h, and KM of 130. 6 mg/L...|$|R
