5|$|The {{raising of}} the British flags on Alexander and Canada was a <b>clear</b> <b>indicator</b> to Nielly that the British {{were aware of}} his identity, and he instead ordered his {{squadron}} to hoist the French tricolour, finally abandoning the ruse that his ships were British. During the preceding three hours, {{the division of the}} French squadron in pursuit of Alexander had steadily closed the gap between the ships, Alexander responding by firing stern-chasers at the pursuers. The French ships responded by firing their bow-chasers at the British vessel. At 09:00 Canada too came in range, Nielly ordering his flagship Marat to fire on the Hamilton's ship, the shot flying over the vessel and harmlessly into the sea. Hamilton responded with fire from his own stern-chasers and Bligh issued signals for Alexander and Canada to form a line, Canada in the lead, so that the British vessels might mutually support one another.|$|E

25|$|The first {{generation}} V70 was an improved {{development on the}} basis of the Volvo 850 estate. Overall design became more rounded doing away with the 850's square edges. Among the many changes were a completely revised front end, fully painted bumpers and side trim and <b>clear</b> <b>indicator</b> lenses all around. Most of the interior was redesigned, with new seats, door panels and dashboard. According to Volvo a total of 1800 changes were made.|$|E
25|$|Serfdom in Suvalkija was {{abolished}} in 1807 by Napoleon Bonaparte: peasants acquired personal freedoms, {{although they}} could not own land. That changed only in 1861 when serfdom was abolished in the entire Russian Empire. By the 1820s, farmers in Suvalkija had begun to divide their villages into individual farmsteads (Lithuanian: singluar – vienkemis, plural – vienkemiai). This development is a <b>clear</b> <b>indicator</b> of economic prosperity among the peasants. The old three-field system was becoming obsolete; under that system the land was managed by the community and individuals could not introduce any technological advances without their approval. By contrast, {{in other parts of}} Lithuania this process did not begin until serfdom was abolished throughout the Empire in 1861, intensifying after the Stolypin reform in 1906.|$|E
25|$|A {{biological}} {{survey was}} carried out in 1993, near Rother Valley Country Park, and only seven types of invertebrates were found, all of which were highly tolerant to pollution. It was recognised that the straight engineered channel where the river had been re-instated after coal mining was not well suited to the support of life, and so a stone weir was constructed, to help with natural aeration of the water, and to increase the flow velocity so that the gravel below the weir was scoured clean. A bay was constructed above the weir, where fish could escape when the river was affected by flooding or pollution incidents. A trial release of fish, funded by contributions from Rhone Poulenc, Coalite Chemicals and Yorkshire Water, was made in April 1994. Half of the total of 2,500 chub and 2,500 roach were released near the new weir, and the other half at Hall Road in Staveley. It soon became clear from anglers that the fish were spreading along the river, and a further 40,000 fish were released that winter. Another survey in September 1995 revealed good growth rates in the fish, and barbel were thriving. Brown trout, thought to have come from the River Hipper or the Barlow Brook, were also found in the Rother, and since these are much less tolerant to organic pollution and low oxygen levels, were a <b>clear</b> <b>indicator</b> that conditions were improving. The following year, chub and dace were released at Old Whittington, and clear evidence that the fish were breeding in the river was found. The river had become a self-sustaining fishery again, and organised angling began {{for the first time in}} over 100 years.|$|E

Some details did seem to match, like the police theory that Suzanne Degnan was dismembered by a hunting knife and Heirens confessed to throwing a hunting knife onto a section of the Chicago Subway [...] "El" [...] trestle near the Degnan residence. However, it was never determined scientifically that it was at least the dismemberment tool and Heirens had an alternate explanation for it.

2500|$|For the Slavic or Bosniak use, it {{is common}} to see the name Beg added to the Slavic suffix of 'ovic', 'ovich', which roughly means 'descendant of'. While the title [...] "Beg" [...] is not in use in Bosnia anymore, track of {{families}} of [...] "Beg" [...] descent is kept. But a surname containing [...] "-begović" [...] suffix in itself is not a <b>clear</b> <b>indicator</b> of descent. For example, there is a number of [...] "Begović" [...] families, some are of noble descent, some not. [...] "Idrizbegović" [...] would be another example of non-noble family with the suffix. Some examples of [...] "beg" [...] families are: Šahbegović, Rizvanbegović, Šačirbegović. On the other hand, [...] "Kukavica" [...] {{is an example of a}} famous [...] "beg" [...] family, not containing the title in itself.

In order to protect youth from prolonged abuse and violence and get them help, exploitation must be recognized as early as possible.

2500|$|It {{was noted}} that the Constitution of the Latvian SSR did not call for a {{referendum}} {{as it had been}} stated in the decree, but recommended two alternatives - either a referendum or a public debate which had de facto taken place as it had been discussed in the press and several public opinion polls had taken place showing {{that a majority of the}} public supported independence. Similarly in the All-Latvian congress of people deputies of 21 April 1990, 8003 had voted for restoration of independence and the declaration had been adopted by a vote of two thirds of members of the Supreme Soviet which was required for constitutional amendments. Furthermore, the Supreme Council referred to the result of elections of Supreme Soviet as a <b>clear</b> <b>indicator</b> of public opinion that supporters of independence had won the election. [...] The Supreme Council stated that by 28 May 1990, it had received letters and telegrams from 646,726 residents of the Republic supporting the declaration and only 8,993 people had expressed opposition. Given these provisions, the Supreme Council stated that the Declaration was legitimate and in force.|$|E
