40|$|Many {{researches}} {{have been}} conducted on the production planning problems. Recently, genetic algorithms have been applied to solve this problem. No studies have been discussed to solve the production planning problem in the operations of fabric spreading and cutting in garment manufacturing. A non-optimized spreading-table planning will directly causes poor work balance with idle time on the computerized fabric-cutting system. As a result, delay for delivery of cut pieces to the sewing operations happens. One of the factors greatly influencing the final spreading and <b>cutting</b> <b>planning</b> is the quantities of spreading tables installed. This paper presents a genetic algorithm (GA) approach to investigate an optimized spreading-table planning for the computerized fabric-cutting system {{and the effects of}} different quantities of spreading table on the spreading-table planning. The results show that GA is an effective approach to find out the optimized <b>planning</b> for the <b>cutting</b> system and predict the effects of different number of spreading tables on the production planning.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a two-stage approach for pattern generation and <b>cutting</b> <b>plan</b> {{determination of the}} one-dimensional cutting stock problem. Calculation {{of the total number}} of patterns that will be cut and generation of the cutting patterns are performed in the first stage. On the other hand, the second stage determines the <b>cutting</b> <b>plan.</b> The proposed approach makes use of two separate integer linear programming models. One of these models is employed by the first stage to generate the cutting patterns through a heuristic procedure with the objective of minimizing trim loss. The cutting patterns obtained from Stage 1 are then fed into the second stage. In this stage, another integer linear programming model is solved to form a <b>cutting</b> <b>plan.</b> The objective of this model is to minimize a generalized total cost function consisting of material inputs, number of setups, labor hours and overdue time; subject to demand requirements, material availability, regular and overtime availability, and due date constraints. The study also demonstrates an implementation of the proposed approach in a coronary stent manufacturer. The case study focuses on the cutting phase of the manufacturing process followed by manual cleaning and quality control activities.

40|$|Abstract—In this paper, {{we address}} the {{combined}} as-sortment and trim loss minimization problem. In real settings, when different stock lengths are available, {{a common problem}} is to select a subset of stock lengths from which to cut the ordered items. In the cutting and packing literature, this problem {{is known as the}} assortment problem. Solving the assortment and trim loss minimization problem in a single stage yields better <b>cutting</b> <b>plans</b> since one takes into account the whole set of stock lengths while computing the best set of cutting patterns. Here, we present an exact branch-and-price-and-cut algorithm to solve both the assortment and the trim loss minimization problem in a single stage. We use an integrated Integer Linear Programming model to compute lower bounds at the nodes of the branch-and-bound tree, and we derive a robust branching scheme to find the integer optimal solution. We report on an extensive set of computational experiments for random instances...|$|R

Simulation models for entire plantations have been found invaluable for the preparation of 1 - to 5 -year <b>cutting</b> <b>plans</b> and for regulating the yield over 20 - to 60 -year periods. Many models have been constructed and found to be simple and highly costeffective. Optimization models, using linear programming, have been constructed for yield regulation and found to give powerful insights into the interactions between the various alternatives available for all stands. However, these models are expensive and require considerable data and expertise. They are difficult to maintain, especially when staff change...|$|R

Research results indicate that genetic algorithms are demanding to calculate though not dependant on the selected objective function. Heuristic algorithm is fast but dependant upon anticipated properties of the optimal solution. Hence, at change of the objective function it has to be changed. When the scheduling by genetic algorithms is solvable in a sufficiently short period of time, it is more appropriate from the practical point than the heuristic algorithm.

As no previous research has focused on cutting force in ultra-precision raster milling (UPRM), this paper presents a theoretical and experimental study on cutting force modeling in UPRM of V-groove. An analytic cutting force model is established to predict the cutting force components both in the feed direction and thrust direction, and a dynamic model is developed to simulate the free vibration signal induced by the cutting force pulse. The effects of cutting parameters in UPRM are studied, including the depth of cut and feed rate, and a group of experiments conducted to verify the simulation results. The simulation and experimental results show that cutting force in UPRM is figured as a force pulse followed by a free vibration signal induced by the force pulse and that the amplitudes of cutting force in both feed direction and thrust direction increase with the growing depth of cut and feed rate.
