2500|$|Case 1. A {{girl had}} 2 {{seizures}} in sleep at 6 years of age. In the first fit {{she was found}} vomiting vigorously, eyes turned to one side, pale, and unresponsive. Her condition remained unchanged for 3 hours before she developed generalized tonic-clonic convulsions. She gradually improved, and {{by the next morning}} was normal. The second seizure occurred 4 months later. She awoke and told her mother that she wanted to vomit, and then vomited. Within minutes her eyes turned to the right. Her mother, who was on her left, asked, [...] "Where am I?" [...] "There, there," [...] the child replied, indicating to the right. Ten minutes later she <b>closed</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>and</b> became unresponsive. Generalized convulsions occurred 1 hour from onset. Thereafter she recovered quickly. Her EEGs showed occipital paroxysms, but this normalized by the age of 10 years. [...] The patient had in childhood infrequent vasovagal syncopes and/or syncope-like epileptic seizures. [...] At last communication with her, she was 29 years of age and following a successful professional career.|$|E

60|$|Rabda {{concealed}} {{the note}} in her garment, and then motioned to Isobel {{that she should}} <b>close</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>and</b> pretend to be asleep. Then she gently drew back the curtains and seated herself {{at a distance from}} the couch.|$|R
60|$|At last Yvonne {{contrived}} {{to stand}} on her feet; {{but she had to}} <b>close</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>and</b> to remain quite still for awhile after that, for her ears were buzzing and her head swimming: she thought that she must fall if she moved and mayhap lose consciousness.|$|R

60|$|Then she <b>closed</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>and</b> {{waited for}} the end. No slender shafts pierced her tender side. She raised her lids to see what stayed the hand of her executioners.|$|E
