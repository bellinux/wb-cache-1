25|$|As {{a result}} of the scaling down of {{hostilities}} as peace returned to China after the Manchu conquest, and also as {{a result of}} the ensuing rapid increase of population, land cultivation and therefore tax revenues based on agriculture, the Kangxi Emperor was able first to make <b>tax</b> <b>remissions,</b> then in 1712 to freeze the land tax and corvée altogether, without embarrassing the state treasury (although the dynasty eventually suffered from this fiscal policy).|$|R
50|$|In the Thatcher {{years the}} top 10% of earners {{received}} almost 50% of the <b>tax</b> <b>remissions,</b> but there {{proved to be}} no simple trade-off between equality and efficiency. The receipts ratio did not fall below the 1979 level until 1992. The expenditure ratio rose again after Thatcher's resignation in 1990, even climbing for a time above the 1979 figure. The cause was the heavy budget charge of the recessions of 1979-81 and 1990-92 and the extra funding required to meet the higher level of unemployment.|$|R

50|$|His three years' stay in Constantinople was wearisome and {{otherwise}} disagreeable; the leisure it forced upon him he devoted {{in part to}} literary composition. Aurelianus succeeded in granting him the <b>tax</b> <b>remission</b> for Cyrene and the Pentapolis and the exemption from curial obligations for him, but then he fell in disgrace and Synesius lost everything. Later Aurelian returned in power, restoring his own grants to Synesius. The poet, then, composed Aegyptus sive de providentia, an allegory in which the good Osiris and the evil Typhon, who represent Aurelian and the Goth Gainas (ministers under Arcadius), strive for mastery, {{and the question of}} the divine permission of evil is handled.|$|R

He went to the capital in occasion of the delivery of the aurum coronarium and his task was to obtain <b>tax</b> <b>remissions</b> for his country. In Constantinople he obtained the patronage of the powerful praetorian prefect Aurelianus. Synesius composed and addressed to Emperor Arcadius a speech entitled De regno, full of topical advice as to the studies of a wise ruler, but also containing a bold statement that the emperor's first priority must be a war on corruption and a war on the interpenetration of barbarians into the Byzantine army.|$|R

25|$|Adult {{education}} is popular, since it gives middle age adults {{a chance to}} obtain a tertiary degree. The concept was not common several decades ago.

30|$|With such intense {{emphasis}} on education, {{it is not}} surprising that almost all Hong Kong children between the ages of 3 and 6 attend preschool programmes, even though ECE is not compulsory in Hong Kong (Audit Commission 2013). Hong Kong parents generally perceive ECE as preparatory programmes for primary schools (Rao et al. 2009). Other reasons for the high coverage rates include the Kindergarten and Child Care Centre Fee <b>Remission</b> <b>Scheme</b> (KCFRS) (which ensures that no child is deprived of preschool education because of financial reasons), the large number of dual-earning families, Hong Kong’s small size, and the extensive and efficient public transport system (Rao 2010).|$|R

50|$|Like Guy Burgess, Blunt {{was known}} to be homosexual, which was a {{criminal}} activity at that time in Britain. Both were members of the Cambridge Apostles (also known as the Conversazione Society), a clandestine Cambridge discussion group of 12 undergraduates, mostly from Trinity and King's Colleges who considered themselves to be the brightest minds in the university. Many were homosexual and Marxist at that time. Amongst other members, also later accused of being part of the Cambridge spy ring, were the American Michael Whitney Straight and Victor Rothschild who later worked for MI5. Rothschild gave Blunt £100 to purchase Eliezar and Rebecca by Nicolas Poussin.

Despite the fact that the Gallo-Roman aristocracy had sided with Avitus, Majorian wanted a reconciliation, not a punishment. With the intercession of Majorian, magister epistolarum Petrus, Sidonius Apollinaris, the son-in-law of Avitus, was allowed to deliver a panegyric in honour of the Emperor (early January 459), receiving in reward the appointment to the rank of comes spectabilis.

50|$|To {{mitigate}} {{the damage caused}} by a series of natural disasters, Empress Dowager Deng's government attempted various relief measures of <b>tax</b> <b>remissions,</b> donations to the poor, and immediate shipping of government grain to the most hard-hit areas. Although some water control works were repaired in 115 CE and 116 CE, many government projects became underfunded due to these relief efforts and the armed response to the large-scale Qiang people's rebellion of 107-118 CE. Aware of her financial constraints, the Empress Dowager limited the expenses at banquets, the fodder for imperial horses who weren't pulling carriages, and the amount of luxury goods manufactured by the imperial workshops. She approved the sale of some civil offices and even secondary marquess ranks to collect more revenue; the sale of offices was continued by Emperor Huan and became extremely prevalent during Emperor Ling's reign.|$|R

5|$|Because small landowning {{families}} {{represented the}} mainstay of the Han tax base, the Han government attempted to aid and protect small landowners and to limit the power of wealthy landlords and merchants. The government reduced taxes in times of poor harvest and provided relief after disasters. <b>Tax</b> <b>remissions</b> and crop seed loans encouraged displaced peasants {{to return to their}} land. An edict in 94 AD excused displaced peasants from paying land and labor service taxes for a year upon returning to their own farms. The land tax on agricultural production was reduced in 168 BC from a rate of one-fifteenth of crop yield to one-thirtieth, and abolished in 167 BC. However, the tax was reinstated in 156 BC at a rate of one-thirtieth. At the beginning of the Eastern Han, the land tax rate was one-tenth of the crop yield, but following the stabilization following Wang Mang's death, the rate was reduced to the original one-thirtieth in 30 AD.|$|R
30|$|Attending pre-primary {{institutions}} is not compulsory for children below {{the age of}} six as the government provides nine years of free and universal basic education from {{the age of six}} to 15, i.e. from primary one to secondary three levels. Hence, the operation of pre-primary services is largely market driven. Government assistance to pre-primary institutions includes rent and rates reimbursement to non-profit-making kindergartens, allocating purpose-built kindergarten premises in public housing estates, the Kindergarten and Child Care Centre Subsidy <b>Scheme,</b> and the <b>remission</b> of fees to needy parents through the Kindergarten and Child Care Centre Fee <b>Remission</b> <b>Scheme</b> (Information Service Department, 2007).

40|$|The Sub-Committee on Penal Reform was {{established}} specifically to examine ‘back-door strategies which involve {{some form of}} early release‘. Executive summary - recommendations 1. Reduce prison numbers. The Sub-Committee {{is concerned about the}} significant increase over recent years in the numbers of prisoners in Ireland. It strongly recommends the adoption of a ‘decarceration strategy‘; a declared intention by the Government to reduce the prison population by one-third over a ten-year period. 2. Commute prison sentences of less than six months. The Sub-Committee recommends that all sentences for under 6 months imprisonment imposed in respect of non-violent offences should be commuted and replaced with community service orders. 3. Increase standard remission from one-quarter to one-third and introduce an incentivised <b>remission</b> <b>scheme</b> of up to one half. The Sub-Committee recommends that standard remission should be increased from one-quarter to one-third of all sentences over one month in length. An enhanced <b>remission</b> <b>scheme</b> of up to one-half should be made available on an incentivised basis for certain categories of prisoner, particularly those serving a prison sentence for the first time. 4. Introduce legislation providing for structured release, temporary release, parole and community return. The Sub-Committee endorses the Irish Penal Reform Trust recommendation for a single piece of legislation which would set out the basis for a structured release system; to include proposed changes to remission set out above, and to temporary release and parole. The Sub-Committee recommends that this legislation could also provide a statutory framework for an expanded community return programme. Legislation could also underpin the strategies currently used by groups working with offenders post-release, and with potential offenders. 5. Address prison conditions and overcrowding; and increase the use of open prisons. The Sub-Committee was informed that structured release and incentivised remission programmes could not operate effectively within prisons unless prison conditions are improved and overcrowding tackled. The recommendations listed above would help to alleviate the overcrowding problem. In addition, actions should be taken to improve conditions within prisons generally. The proportion of open prisons should also be increased...|$|R

This distribution accorded with the order established in the Manchu homeland before the conquest and under which [...] "each of the banners was given a fixed geographical location according to the points of the compass." [...] Despite <b>tax</b> <b>remissions</b> and large-scale building programs designed to facilitate the transition, in 1648 many Chinese civilians still lived among the newly arrived Banner population and there was still animosity between the two groups.

In addition, a law for the creation of property for workers was passed, under which a married worker would normally keep up to 95% of his pay, and graded <b>tax</b> <b>remission</b> for married wage-earners applied up to a wage of 48,000 marks, which indicated the economic prosperity of West Germany at that time. The Town Planning Act (1971) encouraged the preservation of historical heritage and helped open up the way to the future of many German cities, while the Urban Renewal Act (1971) helped the states to restore their inner cities and to develop new neighbourhoods. In addition, gGuidelines of December 1972 on the usage of federal funds in assisting social housing construction laid down that a certain standard needed to be observed when building homes for severely handicapped persons.|$|R
