25|$|Whatever {{their origin}} and station in life may have been, {{both of his}} parents were chosen {{to be part of}} the seven-person staff to take care of the royal baby Tabinshwehti in April 1516. <b>Ye</b> <b>Htut's</b> mother was chosen to be the wet nurse of the prince and heir apparent. The family moved into the Toungoo Palace precincts where the couple had three more sons, the last of whom died young. <b>Ye</b> <b>Htut</b> had an elder sister Khin Hpone Soe, and three younger brothers: Minye Sithu, Thado Dhamma Yaza II, and the {{youngest}} who died young. He also had two half-brothers, Minkhaung II and Thado Minsaw who were born to his aunt (his mother's younger sister) and his father.|$|R
5000|$|His {{close ties}} to the crown prince {{eventually}} brought him into the ranks of Toungoo royalty. When Tabinshwehti came to power in 1530, the 14-year-old king took Swe's eldest daughter Khin Hpone Soe as one of his two queens; awarded his father-in-law a royal title of Minye Theinkhathu (...) and made him a key adviser. His royal ties became stronger in 1534 when his eldest son <b>Ye</b> <b>Htut</b> was married to Princess Thakin Gyi, younger half-sister of the king. In the next six years, whenever Tabinshwehti and <b>Ye</b> <b>Htut</b> (later styled as Bayinnaung Kyawhtin Nawrahta) went on military campaigns against the Hanthawaddy Kingdom, Swe was left to govern the capital, first Toungoo and later Pegu (Bago), with a sizable garrison.|$|R
50|$|<b>Ye</b> <b>Htut</b> {{applied to}} Defence Services Academy but {{initially}} rejected, so enrolled at Rangoon University. He applied again and accepted for the academy’s 22nd intake in 1977.

25|$|Tabinshwehti's {{decision}} would pay enormous dividends {{in the following}} years.

2500|$|On 24 November 1530, Mingyi Nyo {{died and}} Tabinshwehti ascended to the throne.

In the north, the Confederation of Shan States had conquered the Ava Kingdom just {{three and a half years}} earlier. To the west was the Confederation's ally Prome Kingdom. To the south lay the Hanthawaddy Kingdom, the wealthiest and most powerful of all post-Pagan kingdoms. The impending threat became more urgent after the Confederation defeated its former ally Prome in 1532–1533.

2500|$|The future {{king was}} born <b>Ye</b> <b>Htut</b> ( [...] , [...] ) on 16 January 1516 to Mingyi Swe and Shin Myo Myat. His exact ancestry is unclear. No extant {{contemporary}} records, including Hanthawaddy Hsinbyushin Ayedawbon, the extensive chronicle of the king's reign written {{two years before}} his death, mention his ancestry. It was only in 1724, some 143 years after the king's death that Maha Yazawin, the official chronicle of Toungoo Dynasty, first proclaimed his genealogy. According to Maha Yazawin, he was born to a gentry family in Toungoo (Taungoo), then a former vassal state of Ava Kingdom. He was descended from viceroys of Toungoo Tarabya (r. 1440–1446) and Minkhaung I (r. 1446–1451) from his father's side; and from King Thihathu of Pinya (r. 1310–1325) and his chief queen Mi Saw U of Pagan Dynasty from his mother's side. Furthermore, <b>Ye</b> <b>Htut</b> was distantly related to then presiding ruler of Toungoo Mingyi Nyo and his son Tabinshwehti through their common ancestor, Tarabya of Pakhan. Later chronicles simply repeat Maha Yazawin's account. In all, the chronicles (perhaps too) neatly tie his ancestry to all the previous main dynasties that existed in Upper Burma: Ava, Sagaing, Myinsaing–Pinya and Pagan dynasties.|$|R

2500|$|Kyaw Zaw {{was then}} {{only one of}} two {{surviving}} Thirty Comrades. The Thirty Comrades were a group of Burmese men who secretly left Burma in 1941, and were trained by the Japanese on Hainan Island and returned to Burma with the invading Japanese Army in early to mid-1942. In a house in Bangkok on December 26, 1941, most of the Thirty Comrades had their blood drawn (in syringes) and poured into a silver bowl from which each of them drank (thway thauk in time-honoured tradition) and pledged [...] "eternal loyalty" [...] {{to each other and}} to the cause of Burmese independence. Among the Thirty Comrades were Thakin Aung San who took the nom de guerre Bo Tayza, Thakin Shu Maung who became Bo Ne Win and Thakin Shwe who became Bo Kyaw Zaw.

Her husband, who remarried after her death to her younger sister, became viceroy of Toungoo between 1540 and 1549. During Bayinnaung's reign, her other two sons became viceroys of Martaban (Mottama) and Prome (Pyay) with the respective styles of Minye Sithu and Thado Dhamma Yaza II in 1552, and her brother Sithu was appointed governor of Pagan (Bagan) in 1551.|$|R
2500|$|Tabinshwehti and <b>Ye</b> <b>Htut</b> (now styled as Kyawhtin Nawrahta) were to {{cut their}} teeth in failure however. Their maiden annual dry-season campaigns (1534–1537) all failed against Pegu's well armed, heavily {{fortified}} defenses. But their performance got better with each successive campaign, penetrating {{deeper and deeper into}} Hanthawaddy territory. They finally broke through in their 1538–1539 campaign, and captured Pegu. Kyawhtin Nawrahta made his name in the Battle of Naungyo in which his light forces decisively defeated numerically superior Hanthawaddy forces in the Irrawaddy delta. The battle, {{one of the most famous}} in Burmese military history, has been called [...] "the first characteristic touch" [...] of the great Bayinnaung. After the battle, a grateful Tabinshwehti bestowed his brother-in-law the title of Bayinnaung ("King's Elder Brother"), the name by which he would be remembered.|$|R

The first insurgent group to arrive in Rangoon was the Red Flag delegation in June later joined by Thakin Soe himself from Arakan in August.

They raised Tabinshwehti like a son of their own, and the prince in turn treated them like his own parents. The prince is said to have deeply respected Swe.|$|R
50|$|Within {{eight months}} of {{independence}} Burma plunged into an all out civil war. Soe's Red Flag Communists had already started a rebellion, so had the Rakhine nationalists led by the veteran monk U Seinda {{as well as the}} Mujahid Rakhine Muslims. The PVO had split into White-band and Yellow-band factions; the majority White-band PVO led by Bo La Yaung, a member of the Thirty Comrades, and Bo Po Kun, joined the insurrection in July. Nu's government deployed the Karen and Kachin Rifles to suppress the communist uprising, and took Pyay, Thayetmyo and Pyinmana during the latter half of 1948. The Karen National Union (KNU) rebelled at the end of January 1949 when the Army Chief of Staff Gen. Smith Dun, an ethnic Karen was replaced by Gen. Ne Win, a socialist commander and senior member of the Thirty Comrades after Aung San and Bo Let Ya. The Mon joined the Karen. The Pa-O in the Shan State also rose up. Three regiments of the Burma Rifles also went underground led by communist commanders Bo Zeya, Bo Yan Aung and Bo <b>Yè</b> <b>Htut,</b> all members of the Thirty Comrades, forming the Revolutionary Burma Army (RBA).|$|R
25|$|The young {{crown prince}} grew {{up having to}} live up to a prophecy at his birth, which claimed that he would {{grow up to be a}} great warrior just like Minye Kyawswa. (According to the prophecy, Tabinshwehti was the reincarnation of a prince named Minye Kyawswa who was put to death by his father King Dhammazedi of Hanthawaddy. The prince {{supposedly}} prayed the same prayer as Prince Bawlawkyantaw of Hanthawaddy before the latter was put to death by his father King Razadarit in 1390. As Minye Kyawswa of Ava, who was believed to be the reincarnate of Bawlawkyantaw, grew up to be the nemesis of Hanthawaddy, Tabinshwehti, believed to be the reincarnate of Minye Kyawswa of Hanthawaddy, the prophecy claimed, would be the nemesis of Hanthawaddy.) The prophecy of a Minye Kyawswa reincarnate may have been popular in the superstitious world of Burmese politics since Upper Burma was going through immense political turmoil and decades-long internecine warfare. Since the 1480s, the once dominant power of Upper Burma, Ava, had been unable to prevent its key vassal states from breaking away. His father, who himself had broken away from Ava since 1510, required his son to receive an education in military arts. Tabinshwehiti along with <b>Ye</b> <b>Htut</b> and other young men at the palace received training in martial arts, horseback riding, elephant riding, and military strategy.|$|R
