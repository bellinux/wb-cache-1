5|$|Baxter had {{now been}} {{governor}} {{for a year}} and was following an independent course. He began dismantling the systems put in place by the Minstrels. He appointed honest Democrats and Republicans to the Election Commission, reorganized the militia by placing it under the <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>State,</b> rather than the governor, and pushed for an amendment to the state constitution to re-enfranchise ex-Confederates.|$|E
5|$|Ownership of the Brierfield {{plantation}} was {{embroiled in}} court cases, with {{the politics of}} the state judges playing a key role. Only after the Democrats took <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>state</b> supreme court in 1881 did Davis, {{for the first time in}} his life, gain legal title.|$|E
5|$|After Southern Democrats {{walked out}} of the 1860 Democratic National Convention, the party's {{northern}} and southern factions held rival conventions in Baltimore that nominated Douglas and Breckinridge, respectively, for president. A third party, the Constitutional Union Party, nominated John Bell. These three men split the Southern vote, while more anti-slavery Republican candidate Abraham Lincoln won all but three electoral votes in the North, allowing him to win the election. Breckinridge carried most of the Southern states. Taking his seat in the Senate, Breckinridge urged compromise to preserve the Union. Unionists were in <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>state</b> legislature, and gained more support when Confederate forces moved into Kentucky.|$|E

5|$|Booker's mayoralty and {{personal}} celebrity drew much media attention to Newark. While he enjoyed high ratings from city residents, his legacy has received mixed reviews. During his tenure, {{millions of dollars}} were invested in downtown development, but underemployment and high murder rates continue to characterize many of the city's neighborhoods. Despite legal challenges initiated during his term, Newark Public Schools has remained under <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>state</b> for nearly twenty years. Newark received $32 million in emergency state aid in 2011 and 2012, requiring a memorandum of understanding between Newark and the state that obligates the city to request and the state to approve appointments to city hall administrative positions.|$|E
5|$|By the 3rd century, Romanised Illyrians and Thracians, mostly primipilares {{and their}} descendants, came to {{dominate}} the army's senior officer echelons. Finally, the Danubian officer-class seized <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>state</b> itself. In 268, the emperor Gallienus (ruled 260–68) was overthrown by a coup d'état organised by a clique of Danubian senior officers, including his successors Claudius II Gothicus and Aurelian (270–75). They and their successors Probus (276–82) and Diocletian (ruled 284–305) and {{his colleagues in the}} Tetrarchy formed a sort of self-perpetuating military junta of Danubian officers who were born in the same provinces (several in the same city, Sirmium, a major legionary base in Moesia Superior) and/or had served in the same regiments.|$|E
5|$|Hess was {{discharged}} from the armed forces in December 1918. The family fortunes had taken a serious downturn, as their business interests in Egypt had been expropriated by the British. Hess joined the Thule Society, an antisemitic right-wing Völkisch group, and a Freikorps, one of many such volunteer paramilitary organisations active in Germany at the time. Bavaria witnessed frequent and often bloody conflicts between right-wing {{groups such as the}} Freikorps and left-wing forces as they fought for <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>state</b> during this period. Hess was a participant in street battles in early 1919 and led a group which distributed thousands of antisemitic pamphlets in Munich.|$|E

50|$|Baroda was an Indian princely <b>state,</b> {{ruled by}} <b>the</b> Gaekwad dynasty from its {{formation}} in 1721. Following the Second Anglo-Maratha War <b>of</b> 1803-1805, <b>the</b> Gaekwads <b>of</b> Baroda {{made peace with}} the British, entering into a subsidiary alliance which acknowledged British suzerainty and <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>state's</b> external affairs in return for retaining internal autonomy.|$|R
5|$|In 1221 the castle's owner, William de Forz, the Count of Aumale, {{rebelled against}} Henry III; the {{fortification}} {{was captured by}} royalist forces and the King ordered it to be destroyed. The remains of the castle had little value {{by the end of}} the 14th century and Skipsea Brough failed to attract many inhabitants. The castle passed into the <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>state</b> in the early 20th century and various archaeological investigations were carried out between 1987 and 2001. In the 21st century, Skipsea Castle is managed by English Heritage and open to visitors.|$|E
5|$|In 1991 {{the state}} Apportionment Board, {{controlled}} by a 32 Republican majority despite the party's 6138 minority in the state House of Representatives, redrew state legislative districts following {{the results of the}} 1990 Census, in the hope of retaking <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>state</b> House. The new boundaries created nine districts each with two resident incumbent Democrats, pairing Cordray with the twenty-two-year incumbent Mike Stinziano. Unable to be elected in another district due to a one-year residency requirement, Cordray opted not to run for re-election.|$|E
5|$|In the November 1980 general elections, Governor Romero Barceló was re-elected by {{a margin}} of 3,503 votes (one of the closest in Puerto Rico history), though his party lost <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>state</b> {{legislature}} to the main opposition party, the PPD. This loss was attributed by The New York Times to the surrounding controversy regarding the investigations at the time. Other news organizations, such as Time, attributed the loss to Gov. Romero Barcelo's stance on the island's political status. The Legislature quickly started new inquiries and hearings into the Cerro Maravilla incident. The Senate, then presided by Miguel Hernández Agosto, spearheaded the investigations by naming former Assistant District Attorney Hector Rivera Cruz to investigate.|$|E

5|$|In the {{election}} of 2010, Republicans took control of both chambers of the Minnesota legislature {{for the first time}} in 38 years and, with Mark Dayton's election, the DFL party took the governor's office {{for the first time in}} 20 years. Two years later, the DFL regained control of both houses, and with Governor Dayton in office, the party had same-party control of both the legislative and executive branches for the first time since 1990. Two years later, the Republicans regained control of the Minnesota House in the 2014 election, and in 2016, the GOP also regained <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>State</b> Senate.|$|E
5|$|The {{permissive}} attitude toward business {{did not always}} extend toward large corporations. A lack of venture capital in the state became a significant problem with the early industry. Civic and business leaders, and even ordinary citizens, worried that the influx of capital from outside the state {{would lead to a}} loss of political power, revenue, and business opportunities. This sentiment led to a series of antitrust lawsuits by the state Attorney General starting in 1906. The lawsuits easily succeeded and limited the ability of outside investors, most notably Standard Oil, to gain <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>state</b> oil companies.|$|E
5|$|Although Morton {{was able}} to keep the state united during {{the first phase of the}} war, once {{emancipation}} became an issue in 1862, the Republicans suffered a major defeat in the mid-term elections, and Morton lost the support of the strong Democratic majority in the legislature. Before the new legislature convened in 1863, Morton began circulating reports that the Democrats intended to seize <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>state</b> government, secede from the Union, and instigate riots. The Democrats responded with harsh criticisms of Morton and Lincoln, the conduct of the war, and the issues of emancipation and the loss of constitutional rights, among others. Accusations on both sides created a tense atmosphere that only worsened relation between the two parties and guaranteed further confrontations.|$|E

5|$|Although {{setting the}} state budget is a {{legislative}} function in many states, Kentucky governors are required by statute to present a proposed biennial budget to the General Assembly for approval shortly after the beginning of its even-year sessions. The governor's budget has often been approved with few changes, but since the Republicans took <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>state</b> senate {{for the first time}} in 1999, approval has become a much more contentious process. The General Assembly failed to pass a budget before the end of its session in both 2002 and 2004. In both cases, the state operated under an executive spending plan drafted by the governor until the legislature could re-convene and pass a budget. In 2005 the Kentucky Supreme Court ruled that the governor had no authority to expend funds without legislative approval, and that if legislators failed to pass a budget in the future, only expenditures explicitly authorized in the state constitution could be made.|$|E
5|$|As Democrats {{took control}} of the House in 1875, Randall was {{considered}} among the candidates for Speaker of the House. Many in the caucus hesitated, however, believing Randall to be too close to railroad interests and uncertain on the money question. His leadership in the Salary Grab may have harmed him, as well. Randall was also occupied by an intra-party battle with William A. Wallace for control of the Pennsylvania Democratic Party. Wallace, who had been elected to the United States Senate in 1874, was weakened by rumors that he had taken bribes from the railroads while a member of the State Senate. Randall wanted control of the Democratic machine statewide, and the Wallace faction's vulnerability on the bribery rumors provided the opportunity. In January 1875, he had friends in the state legislature begin an investigation into Wallace's clique, which ultimately turned state Democratic leaders against the senator. At the state Democratic convention in September 1875, Randall (with the help of his old ally, Squire McMullen) triumphed, putting his men in <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>state</b> party.|$|E
5|$|During Congressional Reconstruction, U.S. General John Schofield {{administered}} Virginia as Military District One. After 1866, {{according to}} the Radical Reconstruction Acts, a rebelling state which had vacated its delegation in the U.S. Congress was required to incorporate the 14th Amendment into its state constitution before it was allowed to participate again. By the time Schofield called a new state constitutional convention for 1868, three distinct parties had coalesced in Virginia. Radical Republicans, including most ex-slave freedmen, organized to advocate full political and social equality for blacks, but they wanted to exclude ex-Confederates from political participation either in government or at the ballot box. Moderate Unionists including many pre-war Whigs, sought political equality for blacks, but believed that ex-Confederates had {{to be included in}} the political community because of their majority in the white population. Conservatives wanted to ensure white <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>state</b> without Radical influence on issues such as public education.|$|E

5|$|For some Germans, the {{definition}} of nation did not include pluralism, and Catholics in particular came under scrutiny; some Germans, and especially Bismarck, feared that the Catholics' connection to the papacy might make them less loyal to the nation. As chancellor, Bismarck tried without much success to limit {{the influence of the}} Roman Catholic Church and of its party-political arm, the Catholic Center Party, in schools and education and language-related policies. The Catholic Center Party remained particularly well entrenched in the Catholic strongholds of Bavaria and southern Baden, and in urban areas that held high populations of displaced rural workers seeking jobs in the heavy industry, and sought to protect the rights not only of Catholics, but other minorities, including the Poles, and the French minorities in the Alsatian lands. The May Laws of 1873 brought the appointment of priests, and their education, under the <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>state,</b> resulting in the closure of many seminaries, and a shortage of priests. The Congregations Law of 1875 abolished religious orders, ended state subsidies to the Catholic Church, and removed religious protections from the Prussian constitution.|$|E
5|$|In the 1880s, Tillman, {{a wealthy}} landowner, became {{dissatisfied}} with the Democratic leadership and led a movement of white farmers calling for reform. He was initially unsuccessful, though he {{was instrumental in the}} founding of Clemson University as an agricultural school. In 1890, Tillman took <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>state</b> Democratic Party, and was elected governor. During his four years in office, 18 African Americans were lynched in South Carolina—the 1890s saw the most lynchings of any decade in South Carolina. Tillman tried to prevent lynchings, but spoke in support of the lynch mobs, stating his own willingness to lead one. In 1894, {{at the end of his}} second two-year term, he was elected to the U.S. Senate by vote of the state legislature.|$|E
5|$|In {{the state}} {{elections}} of 2012, during which {{all members of}} the legislature (but not the governor) were up for election, the shutdown was a major campaign issue. The Republicans lost their majorities in both houses of the legislature, giving the DFL full <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>state</b> government. Kurt Zellers and other Republican legislators said the shutdown probably was one reason for their electoral defeat. However, other national and state issues may have had more of an influence on the result. The presidential race was also on the ballot, as were the proposed Minnesota Marriage Amendment and Voter ID Amendment, which had been put on the ballot by the legislature in 2011. All of these ballot items increased the turnout of DFL-leaning voters.|$|E
