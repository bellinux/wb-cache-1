5000|$|The <b>Chlamydiae</b> are {{bacterial}} phylum {{and class}} {{whose members are}} a group of obligate intracellular bacteria, whose members are remarkably diverse, ranging from pathogens of humans and animals to symbionts of ubiquitous protozoa. They are ovoid in shape and stain Gram-negative. Historically {{it was believed that}} all <b>Chlamydiae</b> species had a peptidoglycan-free cell wall, but recent work demonstrates a detectable presence of peptidoglycan, as well as other important proteins. Many species belonging to this order are susceptible to antimicrobial agents.All known <b>Chlamydiae</b> only grow by infecting eukaryotic host cells. They are as small as or smaller than many viruses. They are dependent on replication inside the host cells, thus some species are termed obligate intracellular pathogens and others are symbionts of ubiquitous protozoa. Most intracellular <b>Chlamydiae</b> are located in an inclusion body or vacuole. Outside of cells, they survive only as an extracellular infectious form. <b>Chlamydiae</b> can grow only where their host cells grow, and develop according to a characteristic biphasic developmental cycle. Therefore, <b>Chlamydiae</b> cannot be propagated in bacterial culture media in the clinical laboratory. <b>Chlamydiae</b> are most successfully isolated while still inside their host cells. <b>Chlamydiae</b> is the most common bacterial STD in the United States and 2.86 million <b>chlamydiae</b> infections are reported annually.|$|R

40|$|Summary: In recent years, {{there has}} been a renewed effort to study swine <b>chlamydiae,</b> both because there is an {{increased}} awareness of chlamydial diseases and because we now have improved methods of isolation. Six different strains of <b>chlamydiae</b> have been isolated from cases of enteritis, pneumonia, and conjunctivitis in nursing, nursery, and finishing pigs. These isolates are all of the C. trachomatis type and are similar to the hu-man C. trachomatis strains. However, molecular characterization has de-termined that they are distinctly different from the human strains. This re-port discusses only the enteritis, pneumonia, and conjunctivitis caused by these strains, although <b>chlamydiae</b> have been associated with arthritis and reproductive diseases in swine, as well. he isolation of <b>chlamydiae</b> from cases of arthritis and peri-carditis was first reported in the United States in the 1950 s. 1 Since then, <b>chlamydiae</b> have occasionally been isolated from swine, but the isolates have not been characterized or inoculated bac...|$|R
5000|$|The <b>Chlamydiae</b> form {{a unique}} {{bacterial}} evolutionary group that separated from other bacteria about {{a billion years}} ago, and can be distinguished {{by the presence of}} several CSIs and CSPs. The species from this group can be distinguished from all other bacteria by the presence of conserved indels in a number of proteins and by large numbers of signature proteins that are uniquely present in different <b>Chlamydiae</b> species. [...] Reports have varied as to whether the <b>Chlamydiae</b> are related to the Planctomycetales or Spirochaetes. Genome sequencing, however, indicates that 11% of the genes in Candidatus Protochlamydia amoebophila UWE25 and 4% in the Chlamydiaceae are most similar to chloroplast, plant, and cyanobacterial genes. Cavalier-Smith has postulated that the <b>Chlamydiae</b> fall into the clade Planctobacteria in the larger clade Gracilicutes. However, phylogeny and shared presence of CSIs in proteins that are lineage-specific indicate that the Verrucomicrobia are the closest free-living relatives of these parasitic organisms. Comparison of ribosomal RNA genes has provided a phylogeny of known strains within <b>Chlamydiae.</b>|$|R

5|$|In {{women with}} {{cervicitis}} (inflammation of the cervix) or vaginitis (inflammation of the vagina) and in {{young men with}} UTI symptoms, a <b>Chlamydia</b> trachomatis or Neisseria gonorrheae infection may be the cause.

Abi admits to Whitney she had a one-night stand and gave Lee <b>chlamydia.</b> Whitney initially ends their relationship and considers leaving Walford, but later decides to give him another chance. Whitney is pleased when Ryan is released from prison and he tells her he is moving to Wakefield. He offers Whitney and Lee to move in with him and she accepts, but later declines when Linda strongly disapproves of them moving so far away. Whitney and Ryan share an emotional farewell. Whitney suffers spotting and is taken to hospital with Lee, Linda and Mick, where the bleeeding gets heavier. A scan shows Whitney has miscarried her baby, devastating her and Lee. Lauren encourages Whitney to find out whether she lost their baby due to him giving her <b>chlamydia</b> and she confides in Johnny (now Ted Reilly) that <b>chlamydia</b> might have caused it but tells Lee that the doctors said it could not have. Whitney decides to go Milton Keynes to stay with Bianca but returns the next day with Bianca's wedding dress and intends to get married.

Whitney is disappointed to learn that Lee was behind the robbery at The Vic but is unaware how close to suicide he was. She argues with Lee over money and Danny Mitchell (Liam Bergin) who tries to kiss her. Whitney then turns to Mick for support, and sleeps at The Vic.

Following another argument with Lee, Whitney confides in Mick, telling him she is going to buy Ryan an engagement present. Later, a bus crashes into the market and Whitney is trapped underneath it. Whitney is rescued and in hospital, she talks to Mick about her marriage. He comforts her and she kisses him, which is seen by Denise Fox (Diane Parish). Whitney decides to organise a night out and pawns her wedding ring for cash. Lee discovers what she has done and they start arguing. When Whitney says he doesn't deserve her, Lee slaps her in the face. Shortly after the incident Whitney lays on the bed in silence, with Lee begging for forgiveness.

Abi plans to get pregnant by Ben, but when he admits he may have caught an STI from a stranger, she is unable to have sex with him, so Babe tells her to get pregnant by another man. Babe forces her into getting drunk, and after a drunk Lee Carter (Danny-Boy Hatchard) compliments her, they have unprotected sex. However, Abi does not get pregnant. She decides to tell Ben the truth, but as she is about to do so, he tells her he has caught <b>chlamydia.</b> Abi later tests positive for <b>chlamydia</b> and realises that Lee may have caught it too. Abi panics to Babe that Ben will discover she is not pregnant, so during an argument between Ben and Phil, Babe pushes Abi into Ben as he is pushed by Phil, knocking her to the ground.
