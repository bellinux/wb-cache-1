Usually, a single offspring is born (twins are less frequent), {{and it is}} able to stand and run by itself within an hour of birth. In monogamous species, males assist in defending their young, {{but that is not the}} case in polygynous species. Most newborn calves remain hidden for a week to two months, regularly nursed by their mothers. In some bovid species the neonates start following about their mothers immediately or within a few days, as in the impala. Different bovids have different strategies for defence of juveniles. For instance, while wildebeest mothers solely defend their young, buffaloes exhibit <b>collective</b> <b>defence.</b> Weaning might occur as early as two months (as in royal antelope) or as late as a year (as in muskox).|$|E

Secondly, the document states that <b>collective</b> <b>defence</b> remains the core purpose of NATO, but at the same time emphasizes potential NATO contributions to conflict prevention and crisis management, and the potential planning and management of missions like that in Afghanistan. The Riga Declaration even described the capability for such missions as NATO's [...] "top priority".

These ‘social immune systems’ {{result from the}} {{cooperation}} of the individual group members to combat the increased risk of disease transmission that arises from sociality and group living. In this review we illustrate the pathways that parasites can take to infect a social insect colony and use these pathways as a framework to predict colony defence mechanisms and present the existing evidence. We find that the <b>collective</b> <b>defences</b> can be both prophylactic and activated on demand and consist of behavioural, physiological and organisational adaptations of the colony that prevent parasite entrance, establishment and spread. We discuss the regulation of collective immunity, which requires complex integration of information about both the parasites and the internal status of the insect colony.

40|$|Pathogens exert {{a strong}} {{selection}} pressure on organisms to evolve effective immune defences. In addition to individual immunity, social organisms can act cooperatively to produce <b>collective</b> <b>defences.</b> In many ant species, queens {{have the option}} to found a colony alone or in groups with other, often unrelated, conspecifics. These associations are transient, usually lasting only as long as each queen benefits from the presence of others. In fact, once the first workers emerge, queens fight to the death for dominance. One potential advantage of co-founding may be that queens benefit from <b>collective</b> disease <b>defences,</b> such as mutual grooming, that act against common soil pathogens. We test this hypothesis by exposing single and co-founding queens to a fungal parasite, in order to assess whether queens in co-founding associations have improved survival. Surprisingly, co-foundresses exposed to the entomopathogenic fungus Metarhizium did not engage in cooperative disease defences, and consequently, we find no direct benefit of multiple queens on survival. However, an indirect benefit was observed, with parasite-exposed queens producing more brood when they co-founded, than when they were alone. We suggest this is due to a trade-off between reproduction and immunity. Additionally, we report an extraordinary ability of the queens to tolerate an infection for long periods after parasite exposure. Our study suggests that there are no social immunity benefits for co-founding ant queens, but that in parasite-rich environments, the presence of additional queens may nevertheless improve the chances of colony founding success...|$|R

40|$|Parasites {{can cause}} {{extensive}} damage to animal societies {{in which many}} related individuals frequently interact. In response, social animals have evolved diverse individual and <b>collective</b> <b>defences.</b> Here, we measured the expression and efficiency of self-grooming and allo-grooming when workers of the ant Formica selysi were contaminated with spores of the fungal entomopathogen Metarhizium anisopliae. The amount of self-grooming increased {{in the presence of}} fungal spores, which shows that the ants are able to detect the risk of infection. In contrast, the amount of allo-grooming did not depend on fungal contamination. Workers groomed all nestmate workers that were re-introduced into their groups. The amount of allo-grooming towards noncontaminated individuals was higher when the group had been previously exposed to the pathogen. Allo-grooming decreased the number of fungal spores on the surface of contaminated workers, but did not prevent infection in the conditions tested (high dose of spores and late allo-grooming). The rate of disease transmission to groomers and other nestmates was extremely low. The systematic allo-grooming of all individuals returning to the colony, be they contaminated or not, is probably a simple but robust prophylactic defence preventing the spread of fungal diseases in insect societies...|$|R
40|$|Social insects use {{multiple}} {{lines of}} <b>collective</b> <b>defences</b> to combat pathogens. One {{example of a}} behav- ioural group defence {{is the use of}} antimicrobial plant compounds to disinfect the nest. Indeed, wood ants collect coniferous tree resin, and the presence of resin in their nest protects them against fungal and bacterial pathogens. Many questions remain on the mechanisms of resin use, including which factors elicit resin collection and placement within nests. Here, we investigated whether the presence of brood induces Formica paralugubris workers to collect more resin, and whether the workers preferentially place resin near the brood. We also tested whether the collection and placement of resin depends on the presence of the fungal entomopathogen Beauveria bassiana. Workers brought more resin to their nest when brood was present, and preferentially placed the resin near the brood. In contrast, workers did not increase resin collection in response to exposure to B. bassiana, nor did they place resin closer to contaminated brood or contaminated areas of the nest. This lack of response may be explained by a limited effect of resin against the germination and growth of B. bassiana in vitro. Overall, our main result is that woods ants actively position resin near the brood, which probably confers prophylactic protection against other detrimental microorganisms...|$|R

40|$|Social organisms face a {{high risk}} of epidemics, and respond to this threat by {{combining}} efficient individual and <b>collective</b> <b>defences</b> against pathogens. An intriguing and little studied feature of social animals is that individual pathogen resistance may depend not only on genetic or maternal factors, but also on the social environment during development. Here, we used a cross-fostering experiment to investigate whether the pathogen resistance of individual ant workers was shaped by their own colony of origin or by the colony of origin of their carers. The origin of care-giving workers significantly influenced the ability of newly eclosed cross-fostered Formica selysi workers to resist the fungal entomopathogen Beauveria bassiana. In particular, carers that were more resistant to the fungal entomopathogen reared more resistant workers. This effect occurred in the absence of post-infection social interactions, such as trophallaxis and allogrooming. The colony of origin of eggs significantly influenced the survival of the resulting individuals in both control and pathogen treatments. There was no significant effect of the social organization (i. e. whether colonies contain a single or multiple queens) of the colony of origin of either carers or eggs. Our experiment reveals that social interactions during development {{play a central role in}} moulding the resistance of emerging workers...|$|R

It was also intended to assist with identifying the needs that staff may have in order to cope with the demands of their work. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with nine nurses working in the female admission ward of a Western Cape psychiatric hospital. The interview material was analysed to identify common themes which occurred across the interviews concerning participants' experiences, their difficulties and their feelings regarding their work with HIV/AIDS patients. A number of theoretical perspectives were used in analysing and discussing the material, including theories of HIV/AIDS related occupational stress; psychodynamic theory and literature from the field of medical anthropology. The study found that overall, nursing psychiatric patients with HIV/AIDS was experienced as difficult and stressful by participants, and evoked strong emotions of fear and anxiety. The experience of stress in psychiatric HIV/AIDS care was strongly associated with the nature of the work and the anxieties evoked by nursing patients with a terminal, contagious disease. However, the difficulties experienced by participants also appeared to be related to the context of their working environment, and to extend beyond this to the broader social influences of family and community life. The absence of effective support and acknowledgement of these difficulties has resulted in physical symptoms of bum out and the adoption of individual and <b>collective</b> <b>defences</b> in an attempt to cope with the enormous personal and professional challenges of their work...|$|R
50|$|Social {{immunity}} is {{a recently}} developed concept {{used to describe}} the evolution of an additional level of immunity in the colonies of eusocial insects (some bees and wasps, all ants and termites). It is equally used to describe <b>collective</b> disease <b>defences</b> in other stable societies, including those of primates, and, has also been broadened to include other social interactions, such as parental care.Social immunity provides an integrated approach for the study of disease dynamics in societies, combining both the behaviour and physiology (including molecular-level processes) of all group members and their social interactions. It thereby links the fields of social evolution and ecological immunology. Social immunity also affects epidemiology, as it can impact both the course of an infection at the individual level, as well as the spread of disease within the group.|$|R

40|$|Social life is {{generally}} {{associated with an}} increased exposure to pathogens and parasites, due to factors such as high population density, frequent physical contact and the use of perennial nest sites. However, sociality also permits the evolution of new <b>collective</b> behavioural <b>defences.</b> Wood ants, Formica paralugubris, commonly bring back pieces of solidified coniferous resin to their nest. Many birds and a few mammals also incorporate green plant material into their nests. Collecting plant material rich in volatile compounds might be an efficient way to fight bacteria and fungi. However, no study has demonstrated that this behaviour has a positive effect on survival. Here, we provide the first experimental evidence that animals using plant compounds with antibacterial and antifungal properties survive better when exposed to detrimental micro-organisms. The presence of resin strongly improves the survival of F. paralugubris adults and larvae exposed to the bacteria Pseudomonas fluorescens, and the survival of larvae exposed to the entomopathogenic fungus Metarhizium anisopliae. These results show that wood ants capitalize on the chemical defences which have evolved in plants to collectively protect themselves against pathogens...|$|R

We compared the antiseptic behaviours (grooming and hygienic behaviour) of workers from genetically homogeneous and diverse colonies after exposure of their brood to the entomopathogenic fungus Metarhizium anisopliae. While workers from diverse colonies performed intensive allogrooming and quickly removed larvae covered with live fungal spores from the nest, workers from homogeneous colonies only removed sick larvae late after infection. This difference was not caused by a reduced repertoire of antiseptic behaviours or a generally decreased brood care activity in ants from homogeneous colonies. Our data instead suggest that reduced genetic diversity compromises the ability of Cardiocondyla colonies to quickly detect or react {{to the presence of}} pathogenic fungal spores before an infection is established, thereby affecting the dynamics of social immunity in the colony...|$|R
