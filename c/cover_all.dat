5|$|Of these precepts, Mahavira is most {{remembered in}} the Indian traditions for his teachings of ahimsa (non-injury) {{as the supreme}} ethical and moral virtue. Mahavira taught that the {{doctrine}} of non-injury must <b>cover</b> <b>all</b> living beings, and causing injury to any being in any form creates bad karma which affects one's rebirth and future well-being and suffering. According to Mahatma Gandhi, Mahāvīra was the greatest authority on Ahimsa.|$|E

5|$|There {{are ongoing}} {{programs}} {{working on a}} dengue vaccine to <b>cover</b> <b>all</b> four serotypes. Now {{that there is a}} fifth serotype this will need to be factored in.

The ideal vaccine is safe, effective after one or two injections, covers all serotypes, does not contribute to ADE, is easily transported and stored, and is both affordable and cost-effective.|$|E

5|$|Characters of Shakespear's Plays is an 1817 book of {{criticism}} of Shakespeare's plays, written by early nineteenth century English essayist and literary critic William Hazlitt. Composed {{in reaction to the}} neoclassical approach to Shakespeare's plays typified by Samuel Johnson, it was among the first English-language studies of Shakespeare's plays to follow the manner of German critic August Wilhelm Schlegel, and, with the work of Samuel Taylor Coleridge, {{paved the way for the}} increased appreciation of Shakespeare's genius that was characteristic of later nineteenth-century criticism. It was also the first book to <b>cover</b> <b>all</b> of Shakespeare's plays, intended as a guide for the general reader.|$|E
5|$|During this time, Johnson's {{future was}} {{uncertain}} {{because his father}} was deeply in debt. To earn money, Johnson began to stitch books for his father, {{and it is likely}} that Johnson spent much time in his father's bookshop reading and building his literary knowledge. The family remained in poverty until Sarah Johnson's cousin, Elizabeth Harriotts, died in February 1728 and left enough money to send Johnson to university. On 31 October 1728, a few weeks after he turned 19, Johnson entered Pembroke College, Oxford. The inheritance did not <b>cover</b> <b>all</b> of his expenses at Pembroke, but Andrew Corbet, a friend and fellow student at Pembroke, offered to make up the deficit.|$|E

5|$|For many years, the United States {{produced}} more than 90% of commercially usable helium in the world, while extraction plants in Canada, Poland, Russia, and other nations produced the remainder. In the mid-1990s, a new plant in Arzew, Algeria, producing 17million cubic meters (600million cubic feet) began operation, with enough production to <b>cover</b> <b>all</b> of Europe's demand. Meanwhile, by 2000, the consumption of helium within the U.S. had risen to more than 15 million kg per year. In 2004–2006, additional plants in Ras Laffan, Qatar, and Skikda, Algeria were built. Algeria quickly became the second leading producer of helium. Through this time, both helium consumption {{and the costs of}} producing helium increased. From 2002 to 2007 helium prices doubled.|$|E
