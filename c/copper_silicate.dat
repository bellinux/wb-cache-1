25|$|At the Driggith Mine, Caldbeck Fells, Cumbria, on dumps {{from the}} 30 fathom level, {{radiating}} aggregates of lath-like crystals of ianbruceite {{have been found}} in fractures in quartz-dolomite matrix with sphalerite, chalcopyrite and cobalt-bearing köttigite as rounded pink aggregates, or more rarely pale pink to colorless monoclinic blades, as well as irregular black patches of a cobalt-bearing manganese oxide, adamite and an unidentified <b>copper</b> <b>silicate.</b>|$|E

Han blue could {{have been brought to}} a melt, but Han purple does not form a homogeneous melt, so it would have had to use a sintering process.|$|R

40|$|Abstract—This {{study was}} carried out to develop a {{flotation}} procedure for an oxide copper ore from a Region in Central Africa for producing an 18 % copper concentrate for downstream processing at maximum recovery from a 4 % copper feed grade. The copper recoveries achieved from the test work were less than 50 % despite changes in reagent conditions (multistage sulphidisation, use of RCA emulsion and mixture, use of AM 2, etc). The poor recoveries were attributed to the mineralogy of the ore from which <b>copper</b> <b>silicates</b> accounted for approximately 70 % (mass) of the copper minerals in the ore. These can be complex and difficult to float using conventional flotation methods. Best results were obtained using basic sulphidisation procedures, a high flotation temperature and extended flotation residence time...|$|R

6000|$|Lieutenant Yusuf was {{presently}} despatched {{with three}} soldiers, three quarrymen, Jází, the Arab guide {{of a former}} visit, and eight camels, to bring back specimens of the <b>copper</b> <b>silicate</b> {{to the south of}} Aynánah, and to make a regular survey of the northern solfatara. He set out early on February 18th, and after twenty-one hours of caravan-marching reached the Jebel el-Fara'. Here the outcrop is bounded north by the Wady el-Fara', and south by the Wadys el-Maríkhah and Umm Nírán, the latter forming the general recipient of these Nullahs. The Jebel is about 120 feet high, of oval form, stretching 1750 metres from north-north-west to south-south-east. The rich silicate (not carbonate) of copper, which disdains a streak and affects the file, is found, as usual with this ore, only {{in one part of the}} valley to the south-west, some thirty-five feet above the sole: it is a pocket, a [...] "circumscribed deposit," [...] as opposed to a [...] "true vein" [...] or a [...] "vein-fissure." [...] The adjoining rocks contain carbonates of iron and copper, and the ore-mass is apparently carbonate of lime. This second visit generally confirmed the report of Ahmed Kaptán, except that there were no signs of working, as he had supposed. The travellers passed the whole of February 20th at the diggings, made a plan, and sent back two camel-loads (four sacks) of the gangue, in charge of a soldier, to the Fort of El-Muwaylah.|$|E

40|$|Until the 19 th century, most {{pigments}} {{were based}} on naturally occurring colored minerals and dyes, with three significant exceptions: Egyptian Blue, Chinese Blue/ Purple and Maya Blue. The former two are alkaline-earth <b>copper</b> <b>silicates,</b> {{and because of this}} similarity it has been proposed that the Chinese pigments were derived from Egyptian Blue. Herein, we analyzed clumps of pigment from the Qin warriors and discovered that in spite of the structural similarity to Egyptian Blue, the microstructural morphology of Chinese Purple is very different. Therefore, we believe that the synthesis technology for the Chinese pigments was a by-product of high-refractive index glasses (artificial jades) produced by Taoist monks. Further, the disappearance of these pigments from Chinese art and monuments concurrently with the decline of Taoism not only substantiates the link between the two, but also gives a striking example of how cultural changes in the society affected the scientific developments in ancient China...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of scientific examinations and analyses carried out on the archaeological coins discovered in Najran, Saudi Arabia. Optical microscopy (OM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) coupled with energy dispersive spectrometry (EDS) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) were used to investigate morphological corrosion features, to clear the nature of the patina and to analyze the elementary composition. Morphologically, it was revealed that there are reniform, coral reef and dendritic shapes of corrosion products and heterogeneous multicolor patina on the studied coin surfaces. It was proven that those coins were made of a silver-copper alloy and were covered by three superficial corrosion layers. The main composition of the coin corrosion compounds was identified as copper carbonate, <b>copper</b> chloride, <b>copper</b> <b>silicates,</b> silver chlorides and silver sulphide. The proposed corrosion mechanism revealed that those coins were characterized by heavy degradation phenomena, induced by corrosive species and soil contaminants. The corrosion processes led to the depletion of the copper and silver enrichment near the surface, as compared to the core composition. This study provides useful information for the conservation and preservation of the Najran hoard coins...|$|R

The Raman band at 670 cm- 1 is assigned to the ν 4 bending modes of the -SiO 3 units and the band at around 785 cm- 1 is due to Si-O-Si chain stretching mode.

40|$|The {{objective}} of the research is the sol-gel preparation of the crystalline or amorphous orthosilicates of some bivalent metals, namely, copper orthosilicate (Cu 2 SiO 4), {{which seems to be}} a quite efficient catalyst, although it has not been synthesized yet. The main obstacles that prevent the sol-gel synthesis of orthosilicates include high metal/silica molar ratios in precursor mixtures. They cause (i) formation of the crystalline of metal oxides at intermediate stages of synthesis and (ii) a substantial difference between intermediate and final anion structures because of the polycondensation of silicate anions at the stages of gelation and drying. This can result in a double-stage character of synthesis, involving formation of metal polysilicates and a metal oxide as intermediates. The synthesis pattern employed by the authors was based on a combination of "anti-polycondensation" actions that had three components involved: a) 3 -aminopropylsilanetriol, a water-soluble silica precursor that demonstrates low polymerizability and high stability in any ambience; b) triethanolamine, a high-boiling chemically active agent that prevents metal hydroxide precipitation and inhibits polycondensation at initial stages of heat treatment; c) methyl triethylammonium hydroxide, a strong component that inhibits polycondensation processes at the stage of the solution drying. Metal nitrates M(NO 3) 2 (M=Cu, Mg, Zn, Cd) were employed as metal oxide precursors, while water was the solvent. Coating solutions were applied to glass, silica glass or silicon substrates and heated to 300, 500, 700 and 900 °C. The resulting silicate fi lms were studied using UV-VIS spectroscopy, FTIR, XPS and XRD methods. Molecular mass distribution of silicate anions in the films was measured using the molybdate method. As a result, the synthesis pattern proved efficient in the synthesis of orthosilicates of bivalent metals. Amorphous <b>copper</b> <b>silicates</b> with the anion structures close to the orthosilicate (basicities up to 1. 96), were prepared in the form of thin films after heating up to 500 °C. At 700 … 900 °C, they decomposed with the formation of CuO. Only in the case of CuZnSiO 4 the polymerization grade of silicate anions was suffi ciently low, if the ternary samples are taken into consideration (the anion basicity was about 1. 7) ...|$|R
