40|$|The {{traditional}} researches for <b>cartographic</b> <b>lettering</b> {{and display}} focus on conflict among labels and overlap between labels and features. But these two {{issues are not}} significant in web maps. It is worthwhile to concern about how to improve labels' readability considering user locating habits for enhancing user experience. This paper has established a new method for place name display called "the gravitational field". This method is appropriate for the display of dotted place names from the national level (approximately 1 : 20 million) to city level (approximately 1 : 250 thousand) in web maps. We have conducted a usability test which used all nationwide provincial capitals, autonomous regions, municipalities, prefecture-level cities, municipal districts, countries {{and part of the}} townships dotted names. The results show that this rule improves web mapâ€™s legibility, and can significantly enhance the user experience...|$|E
40|$|One of {{the most}} {{challenging}} tasks of <b>cartographic</b> map <b>lettering</b> is the optimal placement of region information on a map. We propose as an approach to this task the elastic labeling problem, in which we are given a set of elastic rectangles as labels, each associated with a point in the plane. An elastic rectangle has a specified area but its width and height may vary. The problem then is to choose the height and width of each label, and the corner of the label to place at the associated point, so that no two labels overlap. This problem is known to be NP-hard even when there is no elasticity (just because of the choice of the corners). We show that the problem remains NP-hard when we have elasticity but no choice about which corner of the label to use [...] -we call this the one-corner elastic labeling problem. We give a polynomial time algorithm for the special case of the one-corner elastic labeling problem in which the points lie on the positive x and y axes and the labels lie in the [...] ...|$|R
40|$|There {{are many}} {{different}} types of datasets represented by maps in thematic cartography. It is possible to represent features and phenomenon referencing to area as well as to point. Furthermore, it is possible to represent qualitative data as well as quantitative data. There {{are many different}} ways to represent them. One of the most important and most used <b>cartographic</b> symbols of <b>lettering</b> is colour, resp. colour scales, which are chosen according to shown data. This article is focused on the perception of colour scales in relation to character of data. For experiment, a new questionnaire was created on the basis of colour scales classification. This questionnaire was posed to the students of years 1 and 2 of high school in order to find out how they perceive the colour scales. The study analyzes three main questions; whether students differentiate qualitative and quantitative datasets and corresponding colour scales, whether they prefer representing of features by context colours or by the colour they like more and whether they are familiar with principles of diverging colour scales. When processing it, the correlation between certain agents and the answers was established...|$|R
