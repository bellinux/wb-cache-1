25|$|The European Convention on Human Rights (1954) places Turkey {{under the}} {{jurisdiction}} of the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR). In 1987, Turkey accepted the right to apply individually to the ECtHR (Article 25 of the European Convention on Human Rights = ECHR) and 1990 recognised the <b>compulsory</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> of the European Court of Human Rights under Article 46 of the ECHR.|$|E
25|$|Relations between Tanzania and Malawi {{have been}} tense {{because of a}} dispute over the countries' Lake Nyasa (Lake Malawi) border. An {{unsuccessful}} mediation regarding this issue took place in March 2014. The two countries agreed in 2013 to ask the International Court of Justice (ICJ) to resolve the dispute should mediation be unsuccessful. Malawi, but not Tanzania, has accepted the <b>compulsory</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> of the ICJ.|$|E
25|$|Protocols 2, 3, 5, 8, 9 and 10 {{have now}} been {{superseded}} by Protocol 11 which entered into force on 1 November 1998. It established {{a fundamental change in}} the machinery of the convention. It abolished the Commission, allowing individuals to apply directly to the Court, which was given <b>compulsory</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> and altered the latter's structure. Previously states could ratify the Convention without accepting the jurisdiction of the Court of Human Rights. The protocol also abolished the judicial functions of the Committee of Ministers.|$|E
50|$|The Norwegian {{legal system}} {{is a mixture of}} {{customary}} law, civil law system, and common law traditions; the Supreme Court renders advisory opinions to legislature when asked; accepts <b>compulsory</b> ICJ <b>jurisdiction,</b> with reservations.|$|R
50|$|Peru's {{legal system}} {{is based on}} civil law system. Peru has not {{accepted}} <b>compulsory</b> ICJ <b>jurisdiction.</b> In 1996 a human rights ombudsman's office (defensor del pueblo) was created to address human rights issues.|$|R
50|$|Chile's {{legal system}} is civil law based. It is {{primarily}} {{based on the}} Civil code of 1855, derived from Spanish law and subsequent codes influenced by European law of {{the last half of}} the 19th Century. It does not accept <b>compulsory</b> ICJ <b>jurisdiction.</b>|$|R
25|$|During his 15 {{terms in}} Congress, Leach's voting record was {{generally}} conservative on fiscal issues, moderate on social matters, and progressive in foreign policy. As {{chair of the}} Arms Control and Foreign Policy Caucus, he pressed for a Comprehensive Test Ban and led the first House debate on a nuclear freeze. He objected to military unilateralism {{as reflected in the}} Iran-Contra policy of the 1980s. He pushed for full funding of U.S. obligations to the United Nations, supported U.S. re-entry into UNESCO, and opposed U.S. withdrawal from the <b>compulsory</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> of the International Court of Justice.|$|E
25|$|The {{resolution}} of the San Remo Conference contained a safeguarding clause for the existing rights of the non-Jewish communities. The conference accepted {{the terms of the}} Mandate with reference to Palestine, on the understanding that there was inserted in the memorandum a legal undertaking by the Mandatory Power that it would not involve the surrender of the rights hitherto enjoyed by the non-Jewish communities in Palestine. The draft mandates for Mesopotamia and Palestine, and all of the post-war peace treaties contained clauses for the protection of religious groups and minorities. The mandates invoked the <b>compulsory</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> of the Permanent Court of International Justice in the event of any disputes.|$|E
25|$|The Conservative {{government}} {{elected in}} 1951 ratified the First Protocol to the ECHR in 1953 {{relating to the}} rights to property, education and free elections, but resisted the right of petition {{on the grounds that}} the common law would come under scrutiny by an international court. Labour's election in 1964 led to reconsideration of the issue and this time the only senior dissenting voice was that of the Home Secretary, Frank Soskice. Although willing to accept the right of petition, he objected to the <b>compulsory</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> of the Court on the basis that it would deprive the United Kingdom of a degree of flexibility in dealing with petitions and could lead to political embarrassment. Nonetheless, by 1965 a majority of government ministers believed that the Court would not pose a significantly greater threat to national sovereignty or to political survival than the Commission of Human Rights to which the United Kingdom was subject. Further pressure for acceptance came from the British judge and President of the Court, Arnold McNair, 1st Baron McNair, the Secretary General of the Council of Europe Peter Smithers, Terence Higgins MP and various non-governmental organisations.|$|E
50|$|A voter may {{deliberately}} spoil a vote, {{for example}} as a protest vote, especially in <b>compulsory</b> voting <b>jurisdictions,</b> to show disapproval {{of the candidates}} standing whilst still {{taking part in the}} electoral process. Intentionally spoiling someone else's ballot before or during tabulation is an electoral fraud.|$|R
50|$|The South Korean {{judiciary}} {{is independent}} {{of the other two}} branches. The highest judiciary body is the Supreme Court, whose justices are appointed by the president with the consent of the National Assembly. In addition, the Constitutional Court oversees questions of constitutionality. South Korea has not accepted <b>compulsory</b> ICJ <b>jurisdiction.</b>|$|R
5000|$|In its {{original}} jurisdiction, the CCJ interprets and applies the Revised Treaty of Chaguaramas (which established the Caribbean Community), {{and is an}} international court with <b>compulsory</b> and exclusive <b>jurisdiction</b> in respect of {{the interpretation of the}} treaty.|$|R
2500|$|The Court {{concluded}} that the United States, despite its objections, was subject to the Court's jurisdiction. The Court had ruled on November 26 by 11 votes to one that it had jurisdiction in the case {{on the basis of}} either Article 36 of the Statute of the International Court of Justice (i.e. <b>compulsory</b> <b>jurisdiction)</b> or the 1956 Treaty of Friendship, Commerce and Navigation between the United States and Nicaragua. The Charter provides that, in case of doubt, it is for the Court itself to decide whether it has jurisdiction, and that each member of the United Nations undertakes to comply with the decision of the Court. The Court also ruled by unanimity that the present case was admissible. The United States then announced that it had [...] "decided not to participate in further proceedings in this case." [...] About a year after the Court's jurisdictional decision, the United States took the further, radical step of withdrawing its consent to the Court's <b>compulsory</b> <b>jurisdiction,</b> ending its previous 40 year legal commitment to binding international adjudication. The Declaration of acceptance of the general <b>compulsory</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> of the International Court of Justice terminated after a 6-month notice of termination delivered by the Secretary of State to the United Nations on October 7, 1985.|$|E
2500|$|In 1969, the United States {{ratified}} the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations of April 24, 1963, and the Optional Protocol Concerning the Compulsory Settlement of Disputes to the Vienna Convention of April 24, 1963. Article 36 of the Vienna Convention requires that foreign nationals who are arrested or detained be given notice [...] "without delay" [...] {{of their right}} to have their embassy or consulate notified of that arrest. The Optional Protocol provides that disputes arising out of the interpretation or application of the Vienna Convention [...] "shall lie within the <b>compulsory</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> of the International Court of Justice".|$|E
50|$|Italy has, in November 2014, {{accepted}} <b>compulsory</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> of the International Court of Justice.|$|E
50|$|The {{judicial}} system {{is based on}} civil law and originates from the Napoleonic code. It has a judicial review of legislative acts. It accepts <b>compulsory</b> ICJ <b>jurisdiction,</b> with reservations. The Court of Appeals is one level below the Court of Cassation, an institution based on the French Court of Cassation. The Court of Cassation (Dutch: Hof van Cassatie, French: Cour de Cassation) {{is the most important}} court in Belgium. Judges are appointed for life by the Belgian monarch.|$|R
5000|$|The third {{branch of}} the {{national}} government is an independent judiciary. The judicial branch interprets the laws, using as a basis the laws as enacted and explanatory statements made in the Legislature during the enactment. The legal system is based on Roman-Dutch law and English common law and accepts <b>compulsory</b> ICJ <b>jurisdiction,</b> with reservations. The constitution's bill of rights provides for due process including the right to a fair, public trial within a reasonable time of being charged and the right to appeal to a higher court. To achieve this, there are four major tiers of courts: ...|$|R
50|$|The term Mortgage {{insurance}} may in some contexts {{refer to}} Private mortgage insurance (PMI), {{also known as}} Lenders mortgage insurance. Private mortgage insurance protects the lender instead of the borrower, although its premiums are payable by the borrower. This type of insurance is <b>compulsory</b> in certain <b>jurisdictions</b> for mortgages started with low down payments.|$|R
5000|$|Thirdly, Article 36(2) allows {{states to}} make {{declarations}} accepting the Court's jurisdiction as compulsory ("optional clause declarations"). Not all countries accept the <b>compulsory</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> of the International Court of Justice, ICJ. For example, Australia accepts compulsory ICJ jurisdiction [...] "with reservations" [...] whereas Brazil has not accepted compulsory ICJ jurisdiction, directly. However, Brazil has accepted the <b>compulsory</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> {{by becoming a}} Party to the Pact of Bogota.|$|E
50|$|The {{legal system}} {{is based on}} the Roman civil law system. Haiti accepts <b>compulsory</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> of the International Court of Justice. There is a Supreme Court (Cour de Cassation), {{assisted}} by local and civil courts at a communal level.|$|E
50|$|Research {{finds that}} the more that states depend on oil exports, the less {{cooperative}} they become: they grow less likely to join intergovernmental organizations, to accept the <b>compulsory</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> of international judicial bodies, and to agree to binding arbitration for investment disputes.|$|E
50|$|Loose {{wheel nut}} {{indicators}} or Lug nut indicators are used both by auto mechanics and drivers to identify lug nuts which require tightening, {{as well as}} by accident investigators to detect faults after accidents. Although not <b>compulsory</b> in most <b>jurisdictions,</b> road safety bodies recommend their use, especially on large or heavy vehicles such as buses, coaches, large vans, and trucks.|$|R
50|$|The CCJ is {{intended}} to be a hybrid institution: a municipal court of last resort and an international court vested with original, <b>compulsory</b> and exclusive <b>jurisdiction</b> in respect of the interpretation and application of the Revised Treaty of Chaguaramas. In the exercise of this original jurisdiction, the CCJ discharges the functions of an international tribunal, applying rules of international law in respect of the interpretation and application of the treaty. The CCJ thus performs similarly to the European Court of Justice, EFTA Court, East African Court of Justice, the ECOWAS Community Court of Justice, the Andean Court of Justice and the International Court of Justice. In contrast to many general international tribunals or courts, the original jurisdiction of the CCJ is compulsory, requiring no pre-existing agreement.|$|R

Malawi, but not Tanzania, has accepted the <b>compulsory</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> of the ICJ.|$|E
50|$|Another {{issue the}} Court {{addressed}} {{was the difference}} between the rules governing the institution of proceedings and jurisdiction. Albania's objection assumed that proceedings could only be instituted where <b>compulsory</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> existed or where a special agreement had been reached. In essence, to institute proceedings the party applying to the Court needed only to plead as far as possible the basis of jurisdiction, and not to establish it absolutely.|$|E
50|$|The key {{principle}} {{is that the}} Court only has jurisdiction {{on the basis of}} consent. The court has no true <b>compulsory</b> <b>jurisdiction.</b> Jurisdiction is often a key question for the Court, because it is challenged by the respondent. At the Preliminary Objections phase, a respondent may challenge (i) jurisdiction and/or (ii) admissibility of the case. Article 36 outlines four bases on which the Court's jurisdiction may be founded.|$|E
5000|$|First, 36(1) {{provides}} that parties may refer cases to the Court (jurisdiction founded on [...] "special agreement" [...] or [...] "compromis"). This method {{is based on}} explicit consent rather than true <b>compulsory</b> <b>jurisdiction.</b> It is, perhaps, the most effective basis for the Court's jurisdiction because the parties concerned have a desire for the dispute to be resolved by the Court and are thus more likely {{to comply with the}} Court's judgment.|$|E
50|$|Federalists in {{this period}} focused on {{amendments}} to the United Nations Charter as a way forward. Most involved reforms to institutions such as a more representative Security Council, a World Court with <b>compulsory</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> and judicial review authority and a democratically elected General Assembly (or a world parliament). Federalists proposed {{a number of new}} institutions such as a commission on sustainable development, an international development authority, a standing peacekeeping corps and an international criminal court.|$|E
50|$|Protocols 2, 3, 5, 8, 9 and 10 {{have now}} been {{superseded}} by Protocol 11 which entered into force on 1 November 1998.

5000|$|Most {{prominent}} {{in the area of}} dispute settlement in international trade law is the WTO dispute settlement system. The WTO dispute settlement body is operational since 1995 and has been very active since then with 369 cases in the time between 1 January 1995 and 1 December 2007. [...] Nearly a quarter of disputes reached an amicable solution, in other cases the parties to the dispute resorted to adjudication. The WTO dispute settlement body has exclusive and <b>compulsory</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> over disputes on WTO law (Article 23.1 Dispute Settlement Understanding).|$|E
50|$|The Court's {{workload}} {{covers a}} wide range of judicial activity. After the court ruled that the United States's covert war against Nicaragua was in violation of international law (Nicaragua v. United States), the United States withdrew from <b>compulsory</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> in 1986 to accept the court's jurisdiction only on a case-by-case basis. Chapter XIV of the United Nations Charter authorizes the UN Security Council to enforce Court rulings. However, such enforcement is subject to the veto power of the five permanent members of the Council, which the United States used in the Nicaragua case.|$|E
