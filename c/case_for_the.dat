40|$|At {{this season}} of the year an {{increase}} in the prevalence of smallpox is usual, but this year the reports indicate somewhat more cases of this disease in November than were reported in 1925 or 1926. The health officers of 41 States reported 452 <b>cases</b> of smallpox <b>for</b> <b>the</b> week ended November 1. 9, 1927; 593 <b>cases</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> following week, and 559 <b>cases</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> week ended December 3, 1927.

PREVALENCE OF POLIOMYELITIS IN THE UNITED STATES Poliomyelitis is more prevalent this month than it usually is in December.

City councillors approved the outline business <b>case</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> stadium in June 2009, meaning officials could start searching for sites. Four sites were put forward to the council in June 2010, and York City favoured the option of building a 6,000 all-seater stadium at Monks Cross in Huntington, to the north of York, on the site of Huntington Stadium, which would be ready by 2014 at the earliest. Mark Stead of The Press noted the advantages of this site, including the potential for land value to include, the opportunity to build health and fitness facilities and commercial interest, and the disadvantages, including a scheduled ancient monument being located on adjacent land and traffic concerns. In July 2010, this location was chosen by the council executive as their preferred option.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the usual}} natural numbers satisfy the axioms of PA, {{there are other}} models as well (called {{non-standard}} models); the compactness theorem implies {{that the existence of}} nonstandard elements cannot be excluded in first-order logic. The upward Löwenheim–Skolem theorem shows that there are nonstandard models of PA of all infinite cardinalities. This is not the <b>case</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> original (second-order) Peano axioms, which have only one model, up to isomorphism. This illustrates one way the first-order system PA is weaker than the second-order Peano axioms.|$|E
5|$|Because {{feathers}} {{are often}} associated with birds, feathered dinosaurs are often touted as the missing link between birds and dinosaurs. However, the multiple skeletal features also shared by the two groups represent another important line of evidence for paleontologists. Areas of the skeleton with important similarities include the neck, pubis, wrist (semi-lunate carpal), arm and pectoral girdle, furcula (wishbone), and breast bone. Comparison of bird and dinosaur skeletons through cladistic analysis strengthens the <b>case</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> link.|$|E

5|$|Earlier restorations had {{all left}} their {{marks on the}} frescoes. To {{counteract}} the whitening caused by salination, animal fat and vegetable oil had been applied, which effectively made the salt crystals transparent, but left a sticky layer that accumulated dirt. An additional problem, most obvious in the small putti which hold the nameplates on the pendentives, was saltpetre seeping through small cracks and appearing as dark rings on the surface. Unlike the white crystalline salt deposits, this could not be removed and the staining was irreversible. Layers of varnish and glue had been applied to many areas. This had darkened and become opaque. Restorers had repainted details over the darkened areas in order to define the features of figures. This was particularly the <b>case</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> lunettes, spandrels and lower parts of the pendentives.|$|E
5|$|However, Swelim's {{theory is}} not widely accepted.

This is also the <b>case</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> stone bowls of king Khaba. This decor style was practiced still under Sneferu, {{the founder of the}} 4th dynasty. Thus, Khaba is thought to have reigned close {{to the end of the}} Third Dynasty.|$|E
5|$|Immediately {{after his}} inauguration, Jefferson {{instructed}} his Secretary of State, James Madison, to stop delivery on all outstanding commissions. Further, {{an act of}} March 8, 1802 the abolished the circuit court judgeships created by the Midnight Judges Act (15 of which had already been filled), restoring the system created under the 1789 and 1793 acts. Federalists viewed this as unconstitutional and looked to the then-pending case of Marbury v. Madisonconcerning a confirmed D.C. {{justice of the peace}} who had not received his commissionas a test <b>case</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> constitutionality of the repeal. The next session of the Supreme Court was in June, one month before the repeal would take effect. But, the Judiciary Act of 1802 delayed the Court's next session until February 1803, and made other changes to the structure of the judicial system.|$|E
