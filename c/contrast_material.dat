25|$|Myelogram: An x-ray of {{the spinal}} canal {{following}} injection of a <b>contrast</b> <b>material</b> {{into the surrounding}} cerebrospinal fluid spaces. By revealing displacement of the <b>contrast</b> <b>material,</b> it can show the presence of structures that can cause pressure on the spinal cord or nerves, such as herniated discs, tumors, or bone spurs. Because it involves the injection of foreign substances, MRI scans are now preferred for most patients. Myelograms still provide excellent outlines of space-occupying lesions, especially when combined with CT scanning (CT myelography).|$|E
25|$|An aortogram {{involves}} {{placement of}} a catheter in the aorta and injection of <b>contrast</b> <b>material</b> while taking X-rays of the aorta. The procedure {{is known as}} aortography. Previously {{thought to be the}} diagnostic gold standard, it has been supplanted by other, less-invasive imaging modalities.|$|E
25|$|Computed {{tomography}} angiography is a fast, {{noninvasive test}} that gives an accurate three-dimensional {{view of the}} aorta. These images are produced by taking rapid, thin-cut slices of the chest and abdomen, and combining them in the computer to create cross-sectional slices. To delineate the aorta to the accuracy necessary to make the proper diagnosis, an iodinated <b>contrast</b> <b>material</b> is injected into a peripheral vein. Contrast is injected and the scan performed using a bolus tracking method. This type of scan is timed to an injection to capture the contrast as it enters the aorta. The scan then follows the contrast as it flows though the vessel. It has a sensitivity of 96 to 100% and a specificity of 96 to 100%. Disadvantages include the need for iodinated <b>contrast</b> <b>material</b> and the inability to diagnose {{the site of the}} intimal tear.|$|E

25|$|Magnetic {{resonance}} imaging (MRI) {{is also used}} for the detection and assessment of aortic dissection, with a sensitivity of 98% and a specificity of 98%. An MRI examination of the aorta produces a three-dimensional reconstruction of the aorta, allowing the physician to determine {{the location of the}} intimal tear and the involvement of branch vessels, and to locate any secondary tears. It is a noninvasive test, does not require the use of iodinated <b>contrast</b> <b>material,</b> and can detect and quantitate the degree of aortic insufficiency.|$|E
25|$|Fluoroscopy is an imaging {{technique}} commonly used by physicians or radiation therapists to obtain real-time moving {{images of the}} internal structures of a patient {{through the use of}} a fluoroscope. In its simplest form, a fluoroscope consists of an X-ray source and a fluorescent screen, between which a patient is placed. However, modern fluoroscopes couple the screen to an X-ray image intensifier and CCD video camera allowing the images to be recorded and played on a monitor. This method may use a <b>contrast</b> <b>material.</b> Examples include cardiac catheterization (to examine for coronary artery blockages) and barium swallow (to examine for esophageal disorders).|$|E
25|$|Contrast-induced {{nephropathy}} (CIN) {{is a form}} {{of kidney}} damage in which there has been recent exposure to medical imaging <b>contrast</b> <b>material</b> without another clear cause for the acute kidney injury. CIN is classically defined as a serum creatinine increase of at least 25% and/or an absolute increase in serum creatinine of 0.5mg/dL after using iodine contrast agent without another clear cause for acute kidney injury, but other definitions have also been used. Despite extensive speculation, the actual occurrence of contrast-induced nephropathy has not been demonstrated in the literature. The mechanism of contrast-induced nephropathy is not entirely understood, but is thought to include direct damage from reactive oxygen species, contrast-induced increase in urine output, increased oxygen consumption, changes in dilation and narrowing of the blood vessels to the kidneys, and changes in urine viscosity.|$|E

2500|$|In the United States, an MRI of {{the brain}} with and without {{contrast}} billed to Medicare Part B entails, on average, a technical payment of /€300 and a separate payment to the radiologist of /€70. [...] In France, {{the cost of an}} MRI exam is approximately €150/. This covers three basic scans including one with an intravenous contrast agent as well as a consultation with the technician and a written report to the patient's physician. In Japan, the cost of an MRI examination (excluding the cost of <b>contrast</b> <b>material</b> and films) ranges from /€115 to /€133, with an additional radiologist professional fee of /€12.50. In India, the cost of an MRI examination including the fee for the radiologist's opinion comes to around Rs 3000–4000 (€37–49/), excluding the cost of <b>contrast</b> <b>material.</b> In the UK the retail price for an MRI scan privately ranges between £350 and £700 (€405–810).|$|E

[...] Additional utility of MRI includes its indication for imaging of patients with an allergy to CT's <b>contrast</b> <b>material,</b> and an overall greater sensitivity to hemorrhage, vascular complications, pseudoaneurysms, and venous thrombosis.|$|E
2500|$|Recently, doubts {{regarding}} {{the significance of}} the phenomenon appeared in the scientific literature. Several studies have shown that Intravenous <b>contrast</b> <b>material</b> administration was not associated with excess risk of acute kidney injury (AKI), dialysis, or death, even among patients with comorbidities reported to predispose them to nephrotoxicity. Moreover, hydration, the most established prevention measure to prevent contrast induced nephropathy was shown to be ineffective in the POSEIDON trial, raising further doubts {{regarding the}} significance of this disease state. [...] A meta-analysis of 28 studies of AKI after CT with radiocontrast showed no causal relationship between the use of radiocontrast and AKI.|$|E

On the one hand, we should rethink individual dosages. One possibility is to consider the lean mass instead of the bodyweight for dose tailoring [15 – 17]. On the other hand, {{the development of new}} <b>contrast</b> <b>materials</b> and tracers will make the perspective for personalized and precision medicine more feasible. In this regard, theranostics, i.e. disease imaging and therapy together (targeted molecular imaging to follow the drug delivery pathway), is the most fascinating direction to follow [18].|$|R

2500|$|While {{taking a}} good {{history from the}} {{individual}} may be strongly suggestive of an aortic dissection, the diagnosis cannot always be made by history and physical signs alone. [...] Often, the diagnosis is made by visualization of the intimal flap on a diagnostic imaging test. Common tests used to diagnose an aortic dissection include a CT scan of the chest with iodinated <b>contrast</b> <b>material</b> and a transesophageal echocardiogram. The proximity of the aorta to the esophagus allows the use of higher-frequency ultrasound for better anatomical images. Other tests {{that may be used}} include an aortogram or magnetic resonance angiogram of the aorta. [...] Each of these tests has pros and cons, and they do not have equal sensitivities and specificities in the diagnosis of aortic dissection.|$|E
2500|$|Magnetic {{resonance}} imaging (MRI) and ultrasound are comparable in efficacy and helpful in diagnosis although {{both have a}} false positive rate of 15 - 20%. [...] MRI can reliably detect most full-thickness tears although very small pinpoint tears may be missed. In such situations, an MRI combined with an injection of <b>contrast</b> <b>material,</b> an MR-arthrogram, may help to confirm the diagnosis. [...] It should be realized that a normal MRI cannot fully rule out a small tear (a false negative) while partial-thickness tears are not as reliably detected. While MRI is sensitive in identifying tendon degeneration (tendinopathy), it may not reliably distinguish between a degenerative tendon and a partially torn tendon. Again, magnetic resonance arthrography can improve the differentiation. An overall sensitivity of 91% (9% false negative rate) has been reported indicating that magnetic resonance arthrography is reliable in the detection of partial-thickness rotator cuff tears. However, its routine use is not advised, since it involves entering the joint with a needle with potential risk of infection. Consequently, the test is reserved for {{cases in which the}} diagnosis remains unclear.|$|E

2500|$|Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scans {{provide an}} image of the soft tissues in the body using radio waves and strong magnets. MRI can be used instead of CT if the patient {{exhibits}} an allergy to the contrast media administered for the test. Sometimes prior to the MRI scan, an intravenous injection of a <b>contrasting</b> <b>material</b> called gadolinium is given to allow for a more detailed image. Patients on dialysis or those who have renal insufficiency should avoid this <b>contrasting</b> <b>material</b> as it may induce a rare, yet severe, side effect known as nephrogenic systemic fibrosis. [...] A bone scan or brain imaging is not routinely performed unless signs or symptoms suggest potential metastatic involvement of these areas.|$|R
40|$|Researchers {{have argued}} {{for many years}} {{that one of the}} {{conditions}} for omnidirectional reflection in a one-dimensional photonic crystal is a strong refractive index contrast between the two constituent dielectric materials. Using numerical simulations and the theory of Anderson localization of light, in this work we demonstrate that an omnidirectional band gap can indeed be created utilizing low refractive index <b>contrast</b> <b>materials</b> when they are arranged in a disordered manner. Moreover, the size of the omnidirectional band gap becomes a controllable parameter, which now depends on the number of layers and not only on the refractive index contrast of the system, as it is widely accepted. This achievement constitutes a major breakthrough in the field since it allows for the development of cheaper and more efficient technologies. Of particular interest is the case of high index contrast one-dimensional photonic crystal fibers, where the propagation losses are mainly due to increased optical scattering from sidewall roughness at the interfaces of high index <b>contrast</b> <b>materials.</b> By using low index <b>contrast</b> <b>materials</b> these losses can be reduced dramatically, while maintaining the confinement capability of the waveguide. This {{is just one of many}} applications that could be proven useful for this discovery...|$|R
50|$|There {{is a risk}} of an {{allergic}} reaction, which may be serious, whenever <b>contrast</b> <b>material</b> containing iodine is injected. A patient {{with a history of}} allergy to x-ray dye may be advised to take special medication for 24 hours before CTA to lessen the risk of allergic reaction or to undergo a different exam that does not call for <b>contrast</b> <b>material</b> injection. CTA should be avoided in patients with kidney disease or severe diabetes, because x-ray <b>contrast</b> <b>material</b> can further harm kidney function. If a large amount of x-ray <b>contrast</b> <b>material</b> leaks out under the skin where the IV is placed, skin damage can result. Compared with other imaging modalities, CTA is associated with a significant dose of ionizing radiation. Depending on patient age and exam protocol, CTA may cause a considerable increase in lifetime cancer risk. However, there are many clinical situations for which the benefits of performing the procedure outweigh this risk.|$|E
