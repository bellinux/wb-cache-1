50|$|It is {{uncertain}} whether the Hamilton B-Line LRT {{would use the}} Flexity Freedom. The province expects to issue a request for qualifications to build the line in 2017, but as of October 2016, Metrolinx has not announced whether the supply of light-rail vehicles {{would be part of}} the request, which would open the project to <b>competing</b> <b>vehicle</b> suppliers.|$|E
50|$|In {{contrast}} with most forms of racing, minor car-to-car contact is generally accepted in stock car racing. This may {{happen in the}} form of forcing another vehicle out of the way, or pushing a <b>competing</b> <b>vehicle</b> forward for mutual benefit. Stock cars are generally built to be tolerant of superficial damage to bodywork, whereas open wheel designs can experience severe issues with even slight spoiler damage.|$|E

5000|$|Stella and its successors Stella Lux and Stella Vie are {{a series}} of solar racing family cars, built for the World Solar Challenge in Australia, sofar winning its Cruiser Class twice, in 2013 and in 2015. Stella is {{considered}} the world’s first solar-powered family car and was given the 'Best Technology Development' Award at the 8th annual Crunchies in San Francisco in 2015. Being the only <b>competing</b> <b>vehicle</b> with a license plate, the road registration of Stella contributed to the winning score in the races. The vehicles are designed and built by [...] "Solar Team Eindhoven" [...] (STE) — some 21 students of different faculties of the Eindhoven University of Technology (TU/e) in the Netherlands. The group have set up a non-profit foundation to promote their concepts for practical solar vehicles for adoption on a broader scale.|$|E
50|$|The race {{is held in}} June, leading {{at times}} to very hot {{conditions}} for drivers, particularly in closed vehicles with poor ventilation; rain is commonly seen. The race begins in mid-afternoon and finishes the following day at the same hour the race started the previous day. Over the 24 hours, modern competitors often cover distances well over 5000 km. The record is 2010's 5410 km, six times {{the length of the}} Indianapolis 500, or approximately 18 times longer than a Formula One Grand Prix. Drivers and racing teams strive for speed and avoiding mechanical damage, as well as managing the cars' consumables, primarily fuel, tires, and braking materials. It also tests endurance, with drivers frequently racing for over two hours before a relief driver can take over during a pit stop while they eat and rest. Current regulations mandate that three drivers share each <b>competing</b> <b>vehicle.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{series was}} first held in 2000 as the 2000 Konica V8 Lites Series and this inaugural contest was won by Dean Canto. Towards {{the end of}} the season Stone Brothers Racing entered a car for David Besnard as {{preparation}} for the long distance races, in the main V8 Supercar series, the Queensland 500 and the Bathurst 1000, which unlike the other races require two drivers for each <b>competing</b> <b>vehicle.</b> Since then main series teams have used the series to help get their endurance co-drivers up-to-speed, or have employed drivers competing for other Fujitsu Series teams. While originally Fujitsu Series teams were allowed to enter main series events, this has since been discontinued as all main series events are limited to those teams carrying valid franchise slots for the main series, although in limited circumstances Fujitsu series teams have been able to lease entries from main series teams.|$|E
2500|$|The team {{continued}} {{to win in}} 2009 and 2010, winning both the ASME East and ASME West Human-Powered Vehicle Challenge in each year.

5000|$|Pricing of the Aztek {{was also}} an issue at launch: the vehicle was too {{expensive}} for its intended [...] "Generation X" [...] audience and was priced significantly higher than <b>competing</b> <b>vehicles.</b> After the 2001 model year, the GT model was dropped and pricing was slashed, in addition to extremely generous rebates and cut-rate financing instituted by GM {{in the wake of}} the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001.|$|R
5000|$|On 14 April 2008, Tesla Motors filed {{a lawsuit}} against Fisker Coachbuild, Fisker and Koehler, contending that they had fraudulently agreed to a design {{contract}} in 2007 only to gain access to confidential information, before announcing a <b>competing</b> <b>vehicle,</b> the Fisker Karma. Both the Tesla and Fisker vehicles in question were designed as serial hybrid cars, with a gas engine powering a generator that charges a battery to power the electric motor, and both were initially planned for delivery in 2010. The lawsuit sought to prevent Fisker from using Tesla design documents, along with a return of the money from the Tesla contract, plus punitive damages. Fisker filed for arbitration in May 2008. An arbitrator ruled in their favor in November 2008, finding [...] "overwhelming" [...] evidence showing that Fisker did not do anything wrong. Subsequently, Tesla was ordered to pay $1.14 million in legal fees and costs to Fisker.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a biologically inspired approach to vision-only simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) on ground-based platforms. The core SLAM system, dubbed RatSLAM, {{is based on}} computational models of the rodent hippocampus, and is coupled with a lightweight vision system that provides odometry and appearance information. RatSLAM builds a map in an online manner, driving loop closure and relocalization through sequences of familiar visual scenes. Visual ambiguity is managed by maintaining multiple <b>competing</b> <b>vehicle</b> pose estimates, while cumulative errors in odometry are corrected after loop closure by a map correction algorithm. We demonstrate the mapping performance of the system on a 66 km car journey through a complex suburban road network. Using only a web camera operating at 10 Hz, RatSLAM generates a coherent map of the entire environment at real-time speed, correctly closing more than 51 loops of up to 5 km in length. ...|$|E

40|$|Emerging {{technologies}} will have important impacts on sustainability objectives. Yet {{little is known}} about the explicit feedbacks between consumer behaviour and technological change, and the potential impact on mass market penetration. We use the UK as a case-study to explore the dynamic interactions between technology supply, performance, cost, and heterogeneous consumer behaviour and the resulting influence on long term market diffusion. Simulations of <b>competing</b> <b>vehicle</b> technologies indicate that petrol hybrids (HEVs) dominate the market over the long-term because they benefit from improved performance and are able to reach the steep part of the diffusion curve by 2025 while competing technologies remain in the early stages of growth and are easier to displace in the market. This is due to the cumulative build-up of stock and slow fleet turnover creating inertia in the technological system. Consequently, it will be difficult to displace incumbent technologies because of system inertia, cumulative growth in stock, long operational life, and consumer risk aversion to new unproven technologies. However, when accounting for both technological and behavioural change, simulations indicate that if investment can reach 30 - 40 % per annum growth in supply, combined with steady technology improvements, and more sophisticated agent decision making such as accounting for full technology lifecycle cost and performance, full battery electric vehicles could displace the incumbent system by 2050...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an analysis of}} the potential system-wide energy and air emissions implications of hydrogen fuel cell vehicle (H 2 -FCV) penetration into the U. S. light duty vehicle (LDV) fleet. The analysis uses the U. S. EPA MARKet ALlocation (MARKAL) technology database and model to simultaneously consider competition among alternative technologies and fuels, with a focus on the transportation and the electric sectors. Our modeled reference case suggests that economics alone would not yield H 2 -FCV penetration by 2030. A parametric sensitivity analysis shows that H 2 -FCV can become economically viable through eductions in H 2 -FCV costs, increases in the costs of <b>competing</b> <b>vehicle</b> technologies, and increases in oil prices. Alternative scenarios leading to H 2 -FCV penetration are shown to result in very different patterns of total system energy usage depending on the conditions driving H 2 -FCV penetration. verall, the model suggests that total CO 2 emissions changes are complex, but that CO 2 emission levels tend to decrease slightly with H 2 -FCV penetration. While carbon capture and sequestration technologies with H 2 production and enewable technologies for H 2 production have the potential to achieve greater CO 2 reductions, these technologies are not economically competitive within our modeling time frame without additional drivers.
