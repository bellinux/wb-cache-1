Our algorithm allows analyzing the waveguides made of materials having very high losses. The dispersion characteristics of p-Ge with a waveguide of two <b>component</b> <b>hole</b> charge carriers are calculated when the ratio of heavy hole concentration in the material is equal to 5 %, 50 % and 95 % of the total free carrier concentration. The effective mass of p-Ge heavy and light holes are 0. 279 me and 0. 043 me respectively. The dispersion characteristics of the main and eight higher modes are presented in the paper. The transformation of higher hybrid modes at some heavy hole concentrations can be noticed. Waveguide broad bandwidth can be considerably extended {{due to the fact}} that the losses of higher modes are larger in comparison to those of the main mode at certain heavy hole concentration.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{presents a}} study of high density plasma dynamics in semiconductors. Chapter 1 serves as an introduction and presents the basics of how we will use optical nonlinearities {{in the study of}} a high density plasma. Chapter 2 develops the necessary femtosecond laser system and techniques utilized in this investigation. The basics of our colliding pulse modelocked femtosecond laser system are presented. A variety of data acquisition systems are also outlined and discussed. A detailed description of our method of chirp measurement and correction rounds out the chapter. Chapter 3 presents {{a study of}} plasma dynamics in type I and type II GaAs multiple quantum well samples. First, the samples are compared in the quasi-equilibrium regime. The transfer of carriers from the wells to the barriers in the type II sample is found to profoundly affect the optical nonlinearities. A many-body theory calculation of these nonlinearities is then presented. We also utilize the unique properties of the type II structure to study the picosecond dynamics of a one <b>component</b> (<b>hole)</b> plasma. Finally, the possibility of transient gain in the type II structure is explored and discussed. Chapter 4 describes an investigation into the gain dynamics in an optically inverted semiconductor. Spectral hole burning is observed throughout the gain region, and the dynamics of the hole burning are shown. Since this system is highly inhomogeneously broadened, these results are first modeled by a group of noninteracting, inhomogeneously broadened, two level transitions. This model permits simple insight into the dynamics, but does not do a complete job of modeling the results. So, a full many-body treatment is included to more completely describe the experiment. Chapter 5 presents a study of the dephasing time through the gain region and into the absorption region of an optically excited GaAs multiple quantum well sample. Both spectral and temporal methods for measuring the dephasing time are utilized. A distinct maximum of the dephasing time is observed at the transparency point. A many-body theory calculating the carrier-carrier scattering rate is presented to explain this maximum...|$|E

We specifically interest in solving hole counting of 2 D objects and genus of closed surface in 3 D. We first prove a new formula for hole counting in 2 D. The number of of holes is h= 1 + (|C_ 4 |-|C_ 2 |) / 4 where C_ 4 and C_ 2 are sets of inward and outward corner points, respectively. This paper mainly deals with algorithm design and implementation of practical computation of topological invariants in digital space.

40|$|Abstract—Homology {{computations}} form {{an important}} step in topological data analysis that helps to identify connected <b>components,</b> <b>holes,</b> and voids in multi-dimensional data. Our work focuses on algorithms for homology computations of large simplicial complexes on multicore machines and on GPUs. This paper presents two parallel algorithms to compute homology. A core component of both algorithms is the algebraic reduction of a cell with respect to one of its faces while preserving the homology of the original simplicial complex. The first algorithm is a parallel version of an existing sequential implementation using OpenMP. The algorithm processes and reduces cells within each partition of the complex in parallel while minimizing sequential reductions on the partition boundaries. Cache misses are reduced by ensuring data locality for data in the same partition. We observe a linear speedup on algebraic reductions and an overall speedup of up to 4. 9 × with 16 cores over sequential reductions. The second algorithm is based on a novel approach for homology computations on manycore/GPU architectures. This GPU algorithm is memory efficient and capable of extremely fast computation of homology for simplicial complexes with millions of simplices. We observe up to 40 × speedup in runtime over sequential reductions and up to 4. 5 × speedup over REDHOM library, which includes the sequential algebraic reductions together with other advanced homology engines supported in the software.

30|$|Despite Mapper’s {{facility}} {{of interpretation}} and computational advantages, {{it does not}} explicitly yield quantitative insights that allow for direct comparison within and across datasets. Persistent homology {{is able to do}} that. Unlike Mapper, it does not compress the data. Rather, it encodes data in a simplicial filtration, a series of progressively finer simplicial complexes. This filtration is then analysed to build a multi-scale low-dimensional summary that tracks the lifespan and evolution of connected <b>components,</b> <b>holes</b> and high dimensional voids along the sequence of simplicial complexes. That is, it identifies and quantifies the different kinds of ‘empty space’ embedded in the data, which implicitly make up the dataset’s shape. This grants the possibility to obtain insights into unique mesoscale structures otherwise invisible to standard analytical tools, which in turn motivates an ever growing application of persistent homology across fields, such as biology [38, 39], social science [22, 31] and neuroscience [20]. For example, in biology, Chan et al. [40] showed that viral genetic recombination is captured better by homological invariant than standard phylogenetic trees across a number of diseases. In the social sciences, Bajardi et al. [41] used homological features to characterise the correlations between socio-economic indicators and spatial structure of migrant communities in Milan. Persistent homology has found its widest application so far in the study of structural and functional brain connectivity where the range of scales and the complexity of the systems seem to benefit the most from a persistent homology description (e.g. [42 – 44]).|$|R
40|$|Laminated {{composite}} {{plates are}} made up of plates consisting of layers bonded together and made up of materials chemically different from each other but combined macroscopically. These have an application in aircrafts, railway coaches, bridges et cetera because they are easy to handle, have got improved properties and the cost of their fabrication is low. But their failure can lead to catastrophic disasters. And generally the failure of these structures is due to the combined effect of excessive stresses on it and buckling. Hence the buckling behavior of these kinds of plates should be analyzed properly. Buckling behavior of laminated composite plates subjected to in-plane loads is an important aspect in the preliminary design of aircraft and launch vehicle <b>components.</b> <b>Holes</b> are provided either in the center or elsewhere in the laminar plates for the purpose of pipes for electric cables or other purposes. Due to the presence of holes in the plates, the stress concentration is near to the holes and the stiffness of the plates is reduced.

In this study, the effect of cut-out, its shape, different boundary conditions, length/thickness ratio, stacking sequence, and ply orientation has been studied.

30|$|By using homology, a tool in {{algebraic}} topology, one {{can measure}} several {{features of the}} spaces S_ϵ — including the numbers of <b>components,</b> <b>holes,</b> and voids (higher-dimensional versions of holes). One can then represent the lifetime of such features using a finite collection of intervals known as a ‘barcode.’ Roughly, the left endpoint of an interval represents {{the birth of a}} feature, and its right endpoint represents the death of the same feature. In Figure  1 (b), we reproduce such intervals for the number of components (blue solid lines) and the number of holes (violet dashed lines). In Figure  1 (b), we observe a dashed line that is significantly longer than the other dashed lines. This indicates that the data set has a long-lived hole. By contrast, in this example one can potentially construe the shorter dashed lines as noise. (However, note that while widespread, such an intepretation is not correct in general; for applications in which one considers some short and medium-sized intervals as features rather than noise, see [52, 53].) When a feature is still ‘alive’ at the largest value of ϵ that we consider, the lifetime interval is an infinite interval, which we indicate by putting an arrowhead at the right endpoint of the interval. In Figure  1 (b), we see that there is exactly one solid line that lives up to ϵ= 2.1. One can use information about shorter solid lines to extract information about how data is clustered in a similar way as with linkage-clustering methods [3].|$|R

40|$|A {{magnetic}} atomic impurity {{inside a}} superconductor locally distorts superconductivity. They scatter Cooper pairs {{as a potential}} with broken time-reversal symmetry, what leads to localized bound states with subgap excitation energies, named hereon Shiba states. Most conventional approaches to study Shiba states treat magnetic impurities as point scatterers with an isotropic exchange interaction, while the complex internal structure of magnetic impurities is usually neglected. Here, we show that the number and the shape of Shiba states are correlated to the spin-polarized atomic orbitals of the impurity, hybridized with the superconducting host, as supported by Density Functional Theory simulations. Using high-resolution scanning tunneling spectroscopy, we spatially map the five Shiba excitations found on sub-surface chromium atoms in Pb(111), resolving both their particle and <b>hole</b> <b>components.</b> While the maps of particle components resemble the d orbitals of embedded Cr atoms, the <b>hole</b> <b>components</b> differ strongly from them.
