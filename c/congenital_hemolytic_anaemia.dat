40|$|Background: Sickle cell <b>anaemia</b> is a <b>congenital</b> <b>hemolytic</b> {{disorder}} {{caused by}} mutation in the β-globin gene at position 6 with replacement of glutamic acid by valine, {{which results in}} structural change in β-chain of haemoglobin. Homozygous patients suffer from <b>hemolytic</b> <b>anaemia</b> and other serious complications. The underline pathology of much of these complications is the recurrent occurrence of vasoocclusion due to microthrombi formation resulting in organs ischemia. In this study we investigated the role of vWF as a determinant of sickle cell disease severity through its contribution {{to the formation of}} such microthrombi. Patients and methods: Seventy Sudanese patients, homozygous for sickle haemoglobin were investigated in this study, they are 35 females and 35 males, the mean of their ages is 6. 8 years. 34 patients presented during vasoocclusive crisis and 36 presented in steady state. The clinical disease severity was determined using two different scoring system, and vWF antigen level in the plasma was estimated by using ELISA technique. Results: Statistical analysis for the correlation between severity score and vWF level in the plasma (in steady state) revealed strong positive association in the couple of scoring systems (P = 0. 008) and (P = 0. 009) (Paerson correlation). Conclusion: Severity of sickle cell anaemia increases with elevation of vWF level in the plasma in the steady state. This is due to contribution of vWF to the formation of microthombi through platelet activation. Platelet count in turn affects vWF level, which is elevated with a high platelet count. Elevation of vWF and platelet count are associated with a hypercoagulable state in sickle cell anaemia...|$|R

40|$|Introduction/Background: Severe acute {{malnutrition}} (SAM) {{in children}} is a significant public health problem in India with associated increased morbidity and mortality. The current WHO recommendations on management of SAM are based on facility based treatment. Given {{the large number of}} children with SAM in India and the involved costs to the care-provider as well as the care-seeker, incorporation of alternative strategies like home based management of uncomplicated SAM is important. Aim & Objectives: To evaluate the effectiveness of a locally made ready-to-use therapeutic food (RUTF) Mushpro Health Drink Powder in decreasing malnutrition in Tribal area. Methods/Study Design: Open-labeled Randomized Controlled trial Eligibility criteria for participants: Children aged 6 — 72 months but not requiring hospitalization for severe malnutrition (SAM) and Moderate acute malnutrition (MAM) were considered eligible for study. Children less than 6 months were excluded as several of them were receiving breast milk. Also children having other diseases incriminated as a cause of severe malnutrition, including cerebral palsy, chromosomal malformation, known metabolic diseases, malignancies, <b>congenital</b> heart disorders, <b>hemolytic</b> <b>anaemia,</b> known malabsorption syndrome, or hepatic disorder were excluded. Study Setting: Anganwadi centers’ run by ICDS program in tribal areas of Amravati District of Maharashtra. Interventions: Children with Severe acute malnutrition (SAM) and moderate acute malnutrition (MAM) in 26 Intervention Anganwadi centre received RUTF (MHDP) 3 gm/kg/per day (SAM) & 2 gm/kg/day MAM two times a day from October to December 2011. Children in the 27 Noninterventional Anganwadi centers’ did not receive Mushpro supplementation. For both the groups the supplementations as per ICDS protocol were given & both arms included continuation of family diets. Main outcome measures: Mean Weight gain and Mean Height gain. Results / Findings: The Mean weight gain at 2 months was higher in the Intervention group (n= 121) : 1. 7 gm/kg/day as compared to control group (n= 123) : 0. 19 gm/kg/day kg (p < 0. 000). The weight gain per kg body weight was directly proportional to severity of the malnutrition. Mean weight gain in gram per gay in experimental group and Mean Height gain in cms/ month in experimental group was more than National and International Standard. Mean weight gain in SAM was 755 gm and in MAM was 656 gm amongst Experimental group while in control group in SAM 106 gm & MAM 79. 6 gm. Discussion/Conclusion: Community based treatment by locally made nutritious food MHDP showed significant weight gain and height gain in Experimental group than control group and proved to be more effective in management of SAM and MAM...|$|R

The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the predictive values of hemolytic anemias registered in the Danish National Patient Register. Patients and methods: All patients with a first-ever diagnosis of hemolytic anemia from either specialist outpatient clinic contact or inpatient admission at Odense University Hospital from January 1994 through December 2011 were considered for inclusion. Patients with mechanical reason for hemolysis such as an artificial heart valve, and patients with vitamin-B 12 or folic acid deficiency were excluded. Results: We identified 412 eligible patients: 249 with a <b>congenital</b> <b>hemolytic</b> anemia diagnosis and 163 with acquired hemolytic anemia diagnosis. In all, hemolysis was confirmed in 359 patients, yielding an overall PPV of 87. 1 % (95 % confidence interval [CI]: 83. 5 %– 90. 2 %). A diagnosis could be established in 392 patients of whom 355 patients had a hemolytic diagnosis. Diagnosis was confirmed in 197 of the 249 patients with <b>congenital</b> <b>hemolytic</b> anemia, yielding a PPV of 79. 1 % (95 % CI: 73. 5 %– 84. 0 %). Diagnosis of acquired hemolytic anemia could be confirmed in 136 of the 163 patients, resulting in a PPV of 83. 4 % (95 % CI: 76. 8 %– 88. 8 %). For hemoglobinopathy PPV was 84. 1 % (95 % CI: 77. 4 %– 89. 4 %), for hereditary spherocytosis PPV was 80. 6 % (95 % CI: 69. 5 %– 88. 9 %), and for autoimmune hemolytic anemia PPV was 78. 4 % (95 % CI: 70. 4 %– 85. 0 %).

5|$|Peroxiredoxins are peroxidases that {{catalyze}} {{the reduction}} of hydrogen peroxide, organic hydroperoxides, as well as peroxynitrite. They are divided into three classes: typical 2-cysteine peroxiredoxins; atypical 2-cysteine peroxiredoxins; and 1-cysteine peroxiredoxins. These enzymes share the same basic catalytic mechanism, in which a redox-active cysteine (the peroxidatic cysteine) in the active site is oxidized to a sulfenic acid by the peroxide substrate.

40|$|Introduction. The {{mechanism}} by which blood transfusion increases blood pressure in a substantial proportion of patients with <b>congenital</b> <b>hemolytic</b> anemia is unknown. Vascular endothelium dysfunction and increased endogenous vasoactive substances have been postulated in the pathogenesis of hypertension following multiple blood transfusions. The present study was undertaken {{to test the hypothesis}} whether increased circulating vasoconstrictors following blood transfusions, if documented, is a potent modulator of hypertension in patients with congenital anemia. Materials and Methods. Four children with <b>congenital</b> <b>hemolytic</b> anemia developed severe hypertension and convulsions 2 to 4 days after they received multiple blood transfusions. None had a history of prior hypertension, kidney disease or seizures before the blood transfusion. Baseline blood and urine samples were obtained for routine renal function studies. Blood samples were also drawn during and 2 weeks after the clinical events for determination of epinephrine, norepinephrine, dopamine, and plasma renin activity. Results. Kidney function was normal in all the 4 patients. All had elevated plasma renin activity and increased blood epinephrine, norepinephrine, and dopamine concentrations during hypertensive crises. Hypertension responded to antihypertensive drugs with the patients remaining normotensive 3 to 6 days after commencing therapy. All recovered without further seizures. The elevated plasma renin activity, epinephrine, norepinephrine, and dopamine levels returned to reference levels 2 weeks after completion of the last blood transfusion. Conclusions. These data suggest that increased activity of vasoconstrictors in the recipient plasma may be responsible for the development of hypertension after multiple blood transfusions. </p...|$|R

"Blood-induced icterus" [...] {{produced}} by the release of massive amounts of a coloring material from blood cells followed by the formation of bile was recognized and described by Vanlair and Voltaire Masius' in 1871.
