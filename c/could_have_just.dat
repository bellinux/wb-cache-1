5|$|Quagmire {{returns home}} from a holiday in Florida and comes to the Griffins' house to tell Peter that he has smuggled some {{fireworks}} into Quahog by hiding them in his anus. Peter tells him that fireworks aren't illegal in Quahog, so he didn't need to hide them and <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>just</b> brought them in normally, but Quagmire doesn't see any fun in doing that. Later on, the Griffins and Quagmire start {{to play with the}} fireworks. Peter attaches ten M-80s together and shows Quagmire, but they explode, detaching all the fingers from his right hand. With Joe's help, Peter is able to find his fingers and later gets them reattached to his hand. The next day, Peter celebrates getting his fingers reattached by going to The Drunken Clam with Cleveland, Joe and Quagmire, and they decide to continue their celebrations at Pawtucket Brewery after the bar closes. Peter is behind on his work at the brewery, as he is unable to type due to his hand injury, and Angela threatens him with the prospect of being fired if he fails to catch up, so he asks Lois to help him. When Lois agrees to help Peter catch up with his work, Peter attempts to seduce her numerous times. Later at the brewery, after a final attempt to seduce Lois in his office, she gives in and they have sex in front of their co-worker Opie, who runs away screaming. In the end, Peter is caught up with his work and enjoys having Lois help out and have sex with him.|$|E

500|$|In 2012, Kunis co-starred with Mark Wahlberg in Ted, {{her most}} commercially {{successful}} film to date. The film was directed and co-written by Family Guy creator Seth MacFarlane. Kunis played the girlfriend of Wahlberg's character. When MacFarlane first conceived the project, he considered Kunis {{too young for}} the role. However, the film remained in development {{for several years and}} when it was finally ready to begin production, he ended up casting her. Ted has received generally positive reviews from critics and was a commercial success, grossing $549million worldwide.

500|$|Olivia Wilde as Quorra, an [...] "isomorphic algorithm", adept warrior, and confidante of Kevin Flynn in the Grid. Flynn {{refers to}} her as his [...] "apprentice" [...] and has {{imparted}} volumes of information to her regarding the world outside of the Grid, which she longs to experience. She is shown to have a love of human literature, particularly the writings of Jules Verne, and plays Go with Flynn. She comments that her 'aggressive style' is usually foiled by Flynn's patience. Wilde describes Quorra as akin to Joan of Arc. Her hairstyle was influenced by singer Karen O. Wilde added that although [...] " [...] <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>just</b> been another slinky, vampy temptress", {{it was important for}} her to appeal to both men and women, and that character tried to avoid the typical female lead by having a naiveté and childlike innocence adequate for such an [...] "evolving and learning organism". Quorra's action scenes led Wilde to work out and train in martial arts.|$|E
500|$|In 2007, Scherzinger was {{planning}} to launch her debut album under the title Her Name is Nicole, however, the release of four singles, including [...] "Whatever U Like" [...] (featuring T.I.) and [...] "Baby Love" [...] (featuring will.i.am) all failed to significantly impact on US charts. [...] "Baby Love" [...] was moderately successful reaching top-twenty in Europe. After a number of pushbacks, the entire project was scrapped {{at the request of}} Scherzinger. In May 2010, Rap-Up reported that Scherzinger was relaunching her solo career with an [...] "empowering" [...] ballad called [...] "Nobody Can Change Me". The song was recorded in a nighttime studio session while she was competing on season 10 of the U.S. reality competition, Dancing with the Stars, and was mastered on May 23, 2010, ready for its premiere on Ryan Seacrest's KIIS FM radio show the following day. Idolator was unimpressed with the [...] "treacly pop tune" [...] saying that the lack of sexiness, [...] "uninspiring message" [...] and [...] "squeaky vocals" [...] did Scherzinger no favors. However, Amos Barshad of New York magazine actually liked the song, stating that [...] "there’s none of the Pussycat Doll’s forced sexiness here; instead, it sounds like something that <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>just</b> missed the final cut on a Kelly Clarkson album (that is sort of supposed to be a compliment, yeah)." ...|$|E
500|$|This {{question}} (regarding {{the script}} development) {{was put to}} Ridley Scott by Total Film magazine: [...] "There were lots of rewrites on Hannibal—what was the main problem with the original material?" [...] Scott replied: [...] "That's inaccurate, because {{there were very few}} rewrites once I brought in Steve Zaillian. If you were to ask who were the best three screenwriters in the business, Steve Zaillian would be one of them. We discussed Hannibal endlessly." [...] Asked if he had read Mamet's draft, he said: [...] "Yes. He is very fast, very efficient, but he was off doing a film. 'Hannibal' was green lit and his first draft only took about a month. But I was scared {{that he would not be}} able to give me enough attention, because that draft needed a lot of work. So I moved on basically." [...] Scott has said there were writing and [...] "structural problems" [...] as to what they would do with parts of the film. One of Zaillian's key objectives was to revise the script by David Mamet until it pleased all parties, meaning the [...] "love" [...] story would need to be done by suggestion instead of by [...] "assault". Scott worked through the script with Zaillian for 28 days making him [...] "sweat through it with him and discuss every inch of the way with him." [...] After 25 days Scott suddenly realized that Zaillian was [...] "exorcising the 600 pages of the book.

2500|$|Flight logs {{released}} in September 2004 {{in response to}} a lawsuit (see below) showed that Bush, who had been flying in the F-102A Delta Dagger, a single-seater interceptor, for most of his career, flew nine times in T-33 trainers in February and March 1972 – nearly twice as many times as he had flown in T-33s in the prior 18 months. The logs also show that on March 12 and April 10 of 1972, Bush took two passes to land his F-102 fighter. [...] Although White House officials could not explain the changes in the flight logs in these final flights, Air Force experts said there could be any of a number of reasons for the change in Bush's flight pattern.

2500|$|Robert D. Biggs {{translated}} {{an exceptionally}} archaic {{version of the}} hymn from Tell Abu Salabikh. He dated this version to around 2600 BCE based upon similarities to tablets found in Shuruppak and dated to a similar age by Anton Deimer in the 1920s. Subsequent radiocarbon dating of samples taken from Tell Abu Salabikh date the site to 2550-2520 BCE however, a timeframe slightly more recent than the one Biggs proposed. Biggs recognized various differences in the archaic cuneiform and that [...] "the literary texts of this period were unrecognized for so long {{is due to the}} fact that they present formidable obstacles to comprehension". He suggests that Abu Salabikh could have been the location of Kesh, however points out that it is not near Adab as described and that Kesh <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>just</b> been a variation in the spelling of Kish. He discusses how the hymn is preserved for so long in later Nippur texts, saying [...] "Although the Abu Saläbikh copies are approximately eight centuries earlier than copies known before, there is a surprisingly small amount of deviation (except in orthography) between them. The Old Babylonian version is thus not a creation of Old Babylonian scribes using older material, but is a faithful reflection of a text that had already been fixed in the Sumerian literary tradition for centuries." [...] Biggs suggested [...] "that other traditional works of literature may also go back in essentially their present form to the last third of the third millennium BC at least." ...|$|E
