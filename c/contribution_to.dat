40|$|It {{is argued}} that trust and {{positive}} social preferences promote public goods production. However, public goods produced by any in-group may have favourable or unfavourable consequences for out-groups (called benign' and malignant' public goods, respectively). I develop a theoretical model of heterogeneous reciprocity preferences and report two experiments relating trust, social preferences and in-group bias <b>to</b> <b>contributions</b> <b>to</b> benign and malignant public goods. The results allow four general conclusions: (i) <b>contributions</b> <b>to</b> benign public goods are (weakly) higher than <b>contributions</b> <b>to</b> malignant ones; (ii) general trust is at best weakly related <b>to</b> <b>contributions</b> <b>to</b> both types of public goods; (iii) the expectation that others contribute is positively related <b>to</b> <b>contributions</b> <b>to</b> both types of public goods; and (iv) social preferences are positively related <b>to</b> <b>contributions</b> <b>to</b> benign public goods and unrelated <b>to</b> <b>contributions</b> <b>to</b> malignant public goods, while in-group bias is negatively related <b>to</b> <b>contributions</b> <b>to</b> both public goods. ...|$|R

5|$|Scotland {{made a major}} <b>contribution</b> <b>to</b> the {{intellectual}} life of Europe, particularly in the Enlightenment, producing major figures including the economist Adam Smith, philosophers Francis Hutcheson and David Hume, and scientists William Cullen, Joseph Black and James Hutton. In the 19th century major figures included James Watt, James Clerk Maxwell, Lord Kelvin and Sir Walter Scott. Scotland's economic <b>contribution</b> <b>to</b> the Empire and the industrial revolution included its banking system {{and the development of}} cotton, coal mining, shipbuilding and an extensive railway network. Industrialisation and changes to agriculture and society led to depopulation and clearances of the largely rural highlands, migration to the towns and mass immigration, where Scots made a major <b>contribution</b> <b>to</b> the development of countries including the US, Canada, Australia and New Zealand.|$|E

5|$|Finally in 1859, Marx {{published}} A <b>Contribution</b> <b>to</b> the Critique of Political Economy, {{his first}} serious economic work. This work was intended {{merely as a}} preview of his three-volume Das Kapital (English title: Capital: Critique of Political Economy), which he intended to publish at a later date. In A <b>Contribution</b> <b>to</b> the Critique of Political Economy, Marx accepts the labour theory of value as advocated by David Ricardo, but whereas Ricardo drew a distinction between use value and value in commodities, Ricardo always {{had been unable to}} define the real relationship between use value and value. The reasoning Marx laid out in his book clearly delineated the true relationship between use value and value. He also produced a truly scientific theory of money and money circulation in the capitalist economy, thus A <b>Contribution</b> <b>to</b> the Critique of Political Economy created a storm of enthusiasm when it appeared in public and the entire edition of the book was sold out quickly.|$|E
