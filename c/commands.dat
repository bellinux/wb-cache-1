5|$|Area <b>commands</b> {{were the}} major {{operational}} and administrative formations of the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) between 1940 and 1954. Established {{in response to}} the outbreak of World WarII, they underpinned the Air Force's geographically based command-and-control system {{for the duration of the}} conflict and into the early years of the Cold War, until being superseded by a functional control system made up of Home, Training, and Maintenance <b>Commands.</b>|$|E
5|$|As {{soon as he}} took office, Meyszner {{embarked}} on a thorough re-organisation of all police operations in the occupied territory. He created four police area <b>commands,</b> aligned to the four military area <b>commands,</b> and ten police districts, corresponding to the military district <b>commands.</b> He took under his command {{the forces of the}} Serbian puppet government, known as the Serbian State Guard, and also established a number of auxiliary and volunteer police units across the whole territory. One of the units controlled by Meyszner was the Auxiliary Police Troop, recruited from Russian Volksdeutsche from the occupied territory but also from Croatia, Bulgaria, Greece and Romania and trained by the Orpo. It was planned to reach a strength of 400 men but little is known about its activities.|$|E

5|$|Divine command theory (also {{known as}} {{theological}} voluntarism) is a meta-ethical theory which proposes that an action's status as morally good {{is equivalent to}} whether it is commanded by God. The theory asserts that what is moral is determined by what God <b>commands,</b> and that {{for a person to}} be moral is to follow his <b>commands.</b> Followers of both monotheistic and polytheistic religions in ancient and modern times have often accepted the importance of God's <b>commands</b> in establishing morality.|$|E

5|$|The {{control pad}} {{may be used}} to move the hero in any {{direction}} and to move the flashing cursor in menu displays. Additional buttons confirm and cancel <b>commands.</b> In the English version, players use menu <b>commands</b> to talk to people, check their status, search beneath their feet, use items, take treasure chests, open doors, and go up or down stairs. However, in some of the game's later remakes, certain <b>commands</b> were assigned to buttons, navigating stairs became automatic, and the hero's speed was increased. In the Japanese version, characters always face forward, so players must choose a command and then a direction in which to perform that action. In the North American version, the hero turns to face the direction he is moving, making direction selection unnecessary.|$|E

The system allowed the developers to input text <b>commands</b> on a separate monitor, and the engine could be ported to other platforms. Other features of the engine included translating actions performed by the mouse into text <b>commands</b> (a sentence parser carries them out), the loading of data as-needed, and functions could be implemented by the simple addition of <b>commands.</b> The game was built as a database, which contained tables for rooms and objects.
