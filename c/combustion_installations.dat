30|$|Instead of {{fractional}} distillation employing temperature differences, one can separate by flash evaporation or pressure distillation. The advantage is simplicity and short residence time, i.e. small equipment and limited investment costs. A technological challenge is, however, {{posed by the}} feature that rapid cooling of binary or multi component mixtures of gases to temperatures where one, {{or some of the}} components preferentially condense, leads to a mist of very small droplets with diameters of 1 – 10 μm (Schaber et al. 2002). The phenomenon is known to occur by aerosol formation in flue gases of biomass <b>combustion</b> <b>installations</b> (de Best et al. 2008), condensate droplets resulting from cooling of wet natural gas (Austrheim 2006) and has also been measured in experiments with CH_ 4 / CO_ 2 mixtures (Willems et al. 2010 a). As the micron-sized droplets are difficult to separate from the gas stream (Hinds 1999), the size advantage of pressure distillation is often lost in the required separator. For a process which relies on fast phase change as a means of separation to be economical and practical, it is necessary to have a device capable of capturing micron-sized droplets with high collection efficiency at low pressure drop and a small footprint.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The flame {{stability}} limit, which was involving the critical flow condition, lift off and blow out, {{could be affected}} by the burner geometry in the <b>combustion</b> system <b>installation.</b> Consequently a flame holder should be put in, to hold the flame as big as possible on a stable condition. The flame holder itself, is a device to hold the flame, whereas the flame holder could disturb the air and fuel flow. The fluid flow will be disturbed if the forces work on the fluid flow will be interrupting their stability. The fluid flow blockage by the flame holder will generate vortex and this vortex will end up with a turbulence condition. This turbulence condition will shift the critical stability limit and will produce a perfect combustion. In this research a concentric jet flow burner was implemented and the fluid flow speed and air speed was variated. To achive a perfect result, it is necessary to visualize the flow pattern using a schlieren photograph system. A thermocouple was introduce to measure the flame temperature and to know the temperature distribution. It is recocnized that a flame holder could be able to increase the {{flame stability}} zone.

40|$|Reducing the {{environmental}} impact of offshore operations {{is one of the most}} pressing challenges facing the oil and gas industry in Europe today. A study was conducted to review the issues by literature search, and consultation with stakeholders and experts.

40|$|Air quality {{management}} in South Africa has undergone significant legislative reform in recent years, {{aimed at improving}} air quality within South Africa. The National Environmental Management: Air Quality Act 39 was promulgated in 2005 and makes provision for various instruments to improve ambient air quality. One such instrument is minimum emission standards, limiting the emissions from industrial point sources. The standards were first set in 2010, but were subsequently amended in 2013. These standards have been set for various industry sectors and require facilities to comply with one set of emission standards by 2015 and a stricter set of standards by 2020, dependent on the commissioning date of the facility. In setting the standards, the costs of compliance and expected ambient benefit of compliance were only indirectly assessed. Subsequent to the promulgation of the standards, various industries have indicated {{that not all of}} the standards were feasible through various applications for the postponement of these standards. The effect of such a postponement will be to delay compliance with the emission standards, resulting in the intended ambient air quality benefits not being realised. The purpose of the investigation was to assess the desirability of implementation of the standards from an environmental as well as economic point of view. Due to the scope of such a study and the variety of industries involved, the investigation was limited to a single set of standards. The research assessed compliance with the Category 1. 1 standards (solid fuel <b>combustion</b> <b>installations</b> used primarily for steam raising or electricity generation with a design capacity greater than 50 MW) for sulphur dioxide (SO 2) emissions as the majority of installations falling into this category have indicated that compliance with the SO 2 emission standard will not be achieved within the required timeframe. A review of environmental evaluation techniques was done {{in order to determine the}} most appropriate method to assess the economic desirability of the legislation, taking into consideration the expected benefit of implementation as well as the costs and impacts of implementing the required abatement technology to reach the standards. The study used a bottoms-up or impact pathway approach to analyse the impact of emission reduction. The costs and benefits associated with the implementation of an SO 2 point source standard of 500 mg/Nm 3 for solid fuel <b>combustion</b> <b>installations</b> (Category 1. 1 sources) was evaluated to determine the net present value of SO 2 regulation on the Mpumalanga Highveld of South Africa. All category 1. 1 sources within the study area expected to have a significant impact on ambient SO 2 concentrations were included in the study. An evaluation of the likely technology to be implemented to reach the new plant (2020) SO 2 emission standard of 500 mg/Nm 3 was conducted and the installation of wet flue gas desulfurisation (FGD) was determined to be the technology of choice. In order to conduct the economic valuation, the costs and benefits associated with the installation of FGD was identified and ranked into four categories, based on the expected impact and the availability of information. All costs and benefits that could be quantified and monetized (Category 1 impacts) were included in the evaluation.

40|$|Fine {{particulate}} matter (PM 2. 5) {{in the atmosphere}} {{have been associated with}} severe human health effects. This report explores future emissions of primary PM 2. 5, their reduction potential and related reduction costs in Finland. One activity pathway of 2020 of the Finnish Climate Strategy was studied with two different PM emission control utilization scenarios: (1) "Baseline" which involves PM control technology utilization complying with current legislation, and (2) "Reduction" which assumes the use of maximum technically and economically feasible emission reduction measures. The studied sectors included stationary combustion and industrial activities. The work was performed using the Finnish Regional Emission Scenario (FRES) model of Finnish environment institute (SYKE). Total emission reduction potential below "Baseline" was estimated at 6. 7 Gg(PM 2. 5) a- 1, or 22 % of the total emissions. The biggest relatively cost-efficient reductions (marginal cost below 5000 € Mg- 1) can be achieved by the use of small electrostatic precipitators (ESPs) in domestic wood log boilers, 2. 0 Gg a- 1. In large-scale <b>combustion</b> <b>installations</b> in power plants and industry the reduction of 1. 2 Gg a- 1 is possible by fabric filter installations instead of ESPs. A comparable reduction with slightly higher costs can be achieved in small (below 5 MWth) industrial boilers by the introduction of ESPs. For industrial processes potential occurs in few individual plants. The uncertainties in emission reduction and cost estimates are biggest for domestic combustion and industrial processes. This report presents cost-efficiency estimates of future emission reductions per mass of PM 2. 5 reduced. However, the magnitude of health benefits gained from emission reductions are different for different emission sources, depending on e. g. the altitude of emission release, the emission location in relation to the location of population etc. The results of this study are used in the integrated assessment modeling framework developed in the KOPRA project in order to link the information of emission reductions and costs, atmospheric dispersion and induced health impacts...|$|E
40|$|Fire in farm {{buildings}} often starts in rooms {{with a high}} fire load density, for example barns, haylofts or food preparation rooms. It takes about l 0 minutes between ignition and flash over. That is all the time the farmer has got to save the animals. To protect the animals against fire, the stable is made like a fire compartment. The separating elements ought to be sealed against fire and smoke, for at least 60 minutes. Movements of people, feed, animals, air etc. require openings and various penetrations. They have to fulfil the same demands of tightness, about 60 minutes. The Agricultural Fire Protection Committee (Lantbrukets Brandskyddskommitté) and The Swedish Insurance company Länsförsäkringar initiated a project to find practical solutions of penetrations through separating elements in agricultural environments. The project concentrates on the three penetrations: feed pipes, hay openings and rail passages. A literature study deals with the understanding of fire and its development together with laws, rules and regulations. No previous studies {{have been made to}} verify the assumption that rail passages contributes to a huge spread of combustion gas. The airflow around an I-beam was studied through experiments. Discussions with fire experts and field studies show the lack of awareness about the contribution of the combustion gas to the spread of fire. The economical climate and motivation today for improving fire protection are poor. • Flow measurements showed that the air flow through a longitudinal opening in a partly open door is lower than that past an I-beam in a recess when the opening widths are the same. However the beam guides the air flow through the recess resulting in an airflow twice as high as that through a longitudinal opening of the same length as the circumference of the I-beam. • Openings such as doors, main entrances, shutters should be closed when they are not used. If required magnet contacts and fire alarms are available to facilitate the closing of passages. The tightness of fire doors has to be carefully examined. • Well-constructed feed pipes, without any fractures, reduce the contribution to spread of <b>combustion</b> gas. The <b>installation</b> of casing around the feed pipes is good security if the pipe should break. • Folding rails are preferable in new and existing buildings.

There should be greater co-operation between fire experts, authorities, fire consulting companies and building advisers. Continued research about the spread of combustion gas is needed...|$|R
40|$|In {{this study}} {{emission}} factors for <b>combustion</b> <b>installations</b> {{subject to authorisation}} in Germany were determined for the years 1995, 2000 and 2010. If focuses on boilers and gas turbine systems used for the public and industrial power supply. The report is divided into the following three sections: Large combustion plants, firing installations subject to the Technical Instructions on Air as well as gas turbines. As an introduction to each section the applied firing and emission reduction techniques are described. Subsequently, the different sectors to be considered are characterized briefly. For the derivation of the emission factors a methodology was selected classifying the installed combustion techniques according to their emission behaviour. Main characteristics for this classification were the type of boiler and the thermal capacity. For these classes emission factors for the pollutants SO_ 2, NO_x, CO, dust, N_ 2 O and VOC were determined. The data basis used consists of information from the relevant technical literature but also from plant operators, associations' statistics, producers and emission declarations from selected German Federal States. In a further step the technology specific factors were aggregated according to the installations' structure within the sector of concern. The emission factors were derived for the year of reference 1995. The projections for the years 2000 and 2010 were calculated for the individual sectors, considering a modification of the installations' structure leading to an increase of low emission techniques. The projections {{take into account the}} future changes in the legislative framework. For the new Federal States the end of the transition period for the implementation of the 13 BImSchV plays an important role.

40|$|A {{steadily}} increasing amount of newly located natural gas fields is severely contaminated with CO 2 and/or H 2 S. Percentages of 30 % CO 2 /H 2 S or even larger are not uncommon. Fields with such high degrees of contaminant {{can not be}} economically exploited by conventional techniques based on amine treatment, as implementation {{would lead to a}} huge energy consumption. Moreover, capital costs involved with the erection of the installations would be very large [1]. Thus, {{there is a need for}} alternatives which do not suffer from these shortcomings. Condensed rotational separation, abbreviated as CRS [2] forms such an alternative. In addition to upstream applications, for purifying natural gas [3], the technique also has potential for removing CO 2 from combustion effluent, CO 2 from syngas and condensates from natural gas. CRS is a simple and straightforward method to upgrade heavily contaminated gases to light degrees of contamination of only a few percent. The size of the installation is small; the energy required to do the job is only a small fraction of the heating value of the produced methane. CRS is a cheap process which makes heavily contaminated gas fields almost as economic as lightly contaminated fields. The working principle of the patented CRS process is as follows. The sour gas is rapidly lowered in temperature (- 50 /- 80 oC) and/or reduced in pressure (20 / 40 bar) by applying compact coolers and expanders. A mixture forms which consists of predominantly gaseous methane with in it a mist of small micron-sized droplets consisting of predominantly liquid CO 2 /H 2 S. The liquid droplets are separated by applying the patented apparatus of the rotational particle separator, abbreviated as RPS (Figure 1). The process is further enhanced by introducing a second step of regeneration. The collected liquid is reduced in pressure (~ 10 / 20 bar). In this way most of the methane which was dissolved in the liquid evaporates. The gas has a composition roughly equal to the incoming feed gas. It is re-fed into the gas stream in the first part of the process. Essential in the process is the availability of the rotational particle separator (RPS). Although not widely known, rapid cooling of binary or multi component mixtures of gases to temperatures where one, or some of the components preferentially condense, leads to a mist of very small droplets with diameters of 1 to 10 micron. The phenomenon is known to occur by aerosol formation in flue gases of biomass <b>combustion</b> <b>installations</b> [4], condensate droplets resulting from cooling of wet natural gas [5] and fog created downstream of windmills, Figure 2. It has also been measured in experiments with Ch 4 /CO 2 mixtures and CO 2 /N 2 mixtures [6, 7]. For a process which relies on fast phase change as a means of separation to be economical and practical, it is necessary to have a device capable of capturing micron-sized droplets with high collection efficiency, low pressure drop and small building space. The RPS is such a device In this paper we shall address the important aspects of CRS. In section 2 a description is given of the thermodynamics of the process. Section 3 deals with the rotational particle separator, while in section 4 a presentation is given of the sizing of an installation capable of handling a field of 100 MMscf/day with composition 59 %mole CH 4, 27 %mole H 2 S and 14 %mole CO 2 (this corresponds to the Huwaila field in Abu Dhabi).

40|$|The study {{examines}} different alternatives for reducing NOx and SOx emissions at sea and evaluates {{them in a}} future NOx and SOx European emissions market, where ships can voluntarily participate by providing credits, as proposed by the Swedish Shipowners Association. The two abbreviations NOx and SOx stand for nitrogen and sulphur oxides, two chemical components deriving during combustion and which are harmful to the environment. Transportation is responsible for {{about half of the}} NOx and SOx emissions in Europe. More grams per kWh are emitted from mobile sources than from stationary sources due to available technologies and space on board. It is imperative to reduce NOx and SOx to sustainable levels. This will allow water reserves and soils to start recovering throughout Europe. Coordination and regulation is needed on a local, national and European level as pollution is transboundary. Among the different approaches, are environmentally differentiated charges (taxes, discounts and dues), consortium benchmarking, environmental subsidies to support investments on clean technologies and the credit-based approach (emissions trading). According to the credit-based approach, the large <b>combustion</b> <b>installations</b> in a geographical area are capped in terms of their maximum annual emissions. Emissions are quantified in tons and counted in credits. If an installation emits less than its allocated credits, it can trade the difference in the emissions market. The result is that the same reductions in tons are achieved overall but through a market mechanism, which balances costs between sectors. All different approaches have their pros and cons but the brilliance of the credit-based system is that it initiates a company’s involvement as profits await those installations which can achieve over-reductions. This {{study examines}} the costs and benefits for ships participating voluntarily in NOx and SOx cap-and-trade program in EU. •	The study samples 37 ships with different operational and technical characteristics in terms of their annual NOx and SOx emissions •	A worksheet is fed with information such as, the revolutions per minute, the total main engine output when steaming, the engine type, the fuel type, the annual steaming time and the average utility of engine power in order to calculate annual fuel consumption and annual NOx and Sox emissions with and without the various alternatives •	Virtually installs different cleaning technologies or switches fuel and costs each alternative per ship •	Counts tradable reductions per ship •	Counts revenues from trade per ship according to an average price estimate from the emissions market •	Evaluates all alternatives in a 5 year time frame •	Examines the environmental performance of every alternative 	 The expenditure for installing cleaning technologies are relatively small, compared to annual fuel costs, thus all cleaning technologies are understood as an accessory. Among the sampled technologies, the Selective Catalyst Reduction system (SCR) is slightly in advance concerning the rate of returns. By average one installation can support a second within five years. Humid Air Motor (HAM) technology has a slightly slower rate with pay back at three years, although is comes at an advantage beyond the time frame of the study, since it bears no operational costs. Sea-water scrubber comes with higher costs per ton than the emissions market estimate but nevertheless, it can provide with a solution for reducing sulphur in sulphur emission control areas (SECAs) with much lesser overall fuel costs than in switching into distillates. Low sulphur residuals (maximum 1, 5 % sulphur content) do not provide any trading volumes but are treated as the baseline for comparing purposes. Distillates increase costs disproportionably to emission reductions to an extent that cannot be overlooked. Natural gas achieves the largest gains from emission markets and lesser annual fuel costs but an increase in new ship builds (for other vessels than gas carriers) shows that shifting to natural gas needs some kind of support. The author believes that the emissions market could take the place of a subsidy. Gas infrastructure on land (refilling stations appropriate for shipping) will determine the sea traffic, which can potentially utilise natural gas but further study is needed on this. A credit-based approach gives incentives to sectors with low abatement costs to invest on cleaning technology and provide inexpensive credits in the emissions market. The largest recipients of cost savings will be land installations with high abatement costs, such as energy related sectors, which shall be able to inexpensively comply with European regulation and sustain flexible production levels. Furthermore, any participation of non-capped sectors is expected to supply the pool with inexpensive credits. For shipping, it is strategically beneficial not so much for the margin of profit but because it motivates shipping companies to invest on cleaning technologies, during a period of pressure for further environmental regulations...|$|E
40|$|Divers modèles, ayant pour but de prédire le taux d'imbrûlés solides lors de la {{combustion}} du fuel lourd, ont été mis au point dans le passé. Les paramètres entrant en ligne de compte sont le plus souvent les teneurs en résidus lourds hydrocarbonés (asphaltènes précipités au pentane ou à l'heptane et carbone Conradson) et en métaux : c'est le cas des modèles Exxon et Shell développés respectivement en 1979 et 1981. D'autres modèles tiennent compte, {{en plus de}} la composition du fuel, de son mode d'atomisation, de son mode de diffusion dans le foyer et de la cinétique de combustion : on peut citer les travaux du Laboratoire Energie du MIT publiés en 1986. Néanmoins, ces facteurs ne sont pas les seuls à intervenir : l'expérience a montré que l'état de dispersion des asphaltènes peut jouer également un grand rôle, notamment dans le cas d'installations de combustion à injection mécanique, pour lesquelles la dispersion des gouttelettes n'est pas aussi fine que pour des installations munies d'une injection assistée par la vapeur. Cette influence de la dispersion des asphaltènes sur la combustion a été mise en évidence dans le passé par l'utilisation d'additifs dispersants et également par la combustion de fuels lourds constitués par dilution d'asphaltes précipités au pentane avec un gas-oil de cracking catalytique de raffinerie (LCO). Ce sont ces fuels que l'on a considérés dans la présente étude. L'effet de ce facteur dispersion n'a pas été quantifié jusqu'alors, la difficulté étant de définir une grandeur mesurable représentant la répartition des agglomérats d'asphaltènes. Dans cette étude, on a essayé en un premier temps de faire une approche fractale de la répartition des asphaltènes à partir de clichés (préparés par la société Total), cette méthode ayant déjà été utilisée avec succès pour décrire des structures d'aspects comparables. Malheureusement, on s'est heurté à des difficultés relevant du mode d'exploration et de la non adéquation entre les structures asphalténiques et fractales. On a finalement opté pour une détermination visuelle s'appuyant sur les clichés sur lesquels les agglomérats d'asphaltènes sont clairement visualisés tels qu'ils sont dans le fuel. Ce mode d'exploration laborieux a cependant permis de déterminer un modèle construit sur une série de 25 fuels dont 10 ont été brûlés sur une chaudière de 2 MW, et 15 sur un four de 100 kW. Ce modèle fait intervenir les teneurs en carbone Conradson et en métaux, ainsi que le taux de dispersion des asphaltènes. Le perfectionnement des moyens d'exploration aidant, on peut s'attendre à ce que soient disponibles des techniques d'évaluation de la dispersion sur les clichés. Ce paramètre pourra alors être pris en considération pour une meilleure prédiction de résultats de combustion insuffisamment expliqués avec les paramètres classiques. Various models {{aiming to}} predict the amount of unburned particles (solids) during heavy fuel-oil combustion have been developed. The parameters taken into consideration are generally asphaltenes precipitated by normal heptane or pentane and Conradson carbon {{as well as the}} metals content having a known catalytic effect on cenosphere combustion in the combustion chamber. The Exxon and Shell models can be mentioned, which were developed respectively in 1979 and 1981 (Chapter II). Other models also give consideration to the fuel-oil composition, the way it is atomized and diffused in the chamber and the combustion kinetics (research done by the MIT Energy Laboratory published in 1986). However, the above parameters {{are not the only ones}} involved. For some fuel oils, experience has shown that the state of dispersion of asphaltenes may also play an important role particularly for <b>combustion</b> <b>installations</b> with mechanical injection for which the dispersion of fuel-oil droplets is not very great and does not affect the structures built up by asphaltene aggregates. This influence of asphaltene dispersion on combustion was revealed in the past by the use of dispersant additives, and more recently in the combustion of heavy fuel oils made up by the dilution of pentane-precipited asphalts with a light cycle oil (LCO). These fuel oils are considered in this article because a divergence has been found between prediction and the measurement of solid unburned hydrocarbons as the result of a more or less dispersed state of asphaltenes, depending on the conditions of diluted-asphalt preparation with a fixed fuel oil/LCO ratio. The goal has thus been to add on a term representative of this state of dispersion to the terms normally considered (asphaltenes, Conradson carbon, metals). To assess the state of dispersion of asphaltenes in fuel oils, pictures implying a special preparation of sample (taken by Total) were examined. These photos give a fairly representative picture of aggregate distribution in the fuel oil. To assess this dispersion, a fractal approach, which had already been applied successfully to describe structures with comparable aspects, was tried, but we came up against difficulties stemming from the exploration method and from the unmatching of asphaltenic and fractal structures. We finally chose a visual determination based on the photos in which the asphaltene agglomerates are clearly represented as they occur in the fuel oil (set of photos in the article). This laborious exploration method (liable to be replaced by image-scanning software) nevertheless enabled a more complete model to be designed for this type of production. This model was based on a serie of 25 fuel oils, ten of which were burned in a 2 MW boiler and 15 in a 100 IkW furnace. The characteristics of these fuel oils are given in Table I. The designations tau s and tau v represent the rates of surface and volume dispersion of the fuel oils expressed respectively in agg/µm² and agg/µm 3 (agg = agglomerates). Table II has to do with the nature of the fuel oils used (origin of the crude and method of preparation). The prospection methodology in creating the overall model is diagramed in a flowchart. The two series of fuel oils were burned respectively in a 2 MW boiler and a 100 kW furnace. The aim was to reduce them to a single serie of 25 measurement so that the model would have greater significance. The particles emission between the two installations were appreciably different, and so they had to be made comparable by a passage equationbetween the actual values obtained for the 2 MW boiler and the fictive values predicted by the intermediate model used (model of the 100 kW furnace). With the help of the passage equation, we were thus able to build a model on all the data. The model concerning the 100 kW furnace was taken as the intermediate model, and thus the values predicted by the overall model are directly applicable to the 100 kW furnace. However, the reverse passage equationhad to be applied to the fictive predicted values for the 2 MW boiler to obtain the particle emission corresponding to this latter installation...|$|E
