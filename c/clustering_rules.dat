40|$|In this dissertation, I explore two {{questions}} related to revisionist views of environmental regulations and trade. First, I explore the implications of more stringent standards when these standards both benefit and cost producers and consumers. Second, I empirically explore the impact of one major US environmental policy change in the {{pulp and paper industry}} on productivity and trade. ^ In Part One, I discuss how a stricter labeling standard affects consumer welfare when the labeled goods markets in two countries are integrated, and how a bilateral tariff rate reduction affects consumer welfare. I discuss each issue under two different international trade models: a national product differentiation model and a monopolistic competition model. Different trade models do yield different results. ^ The second question is related to the promulgation of the 2 ̆ 2 <b>cluster</b> <b>rule</b> 2 ̆ 2 for the US pulp and paper industry, implemented by the US Environmental Protection Agency in 1998. This stricter environmental regulation required US pulp and paper producers to invest large amounts of capital to bring themselves into compliance. ^ I use data from five major categories of the US pulp and paper industry [...] -newsprint, paperboard, printing and writing paper, sulfate pulp, and Kraft paper [...] -to investigate if the change induced by the <b>cluster</b> <b>rule</b> improved the productivity of producers and impacted trade flows between the US and Canada. ^ The empirical results show that the impact of the <b>cluster</b> <b>rule</b> on the US domestic sales price and the export price to Canada is negative and significant for the paperboard, printing and writing paper, and Kraft paper industries. ^ The US <b>cluster</b> <b>rule</b> increased Canadian imports of US paperboard, printing and writing paper, and Kraft paper products. However, the value of Canadian imports from the US increased only for paperboard and Kraft paper products, while the value decreased for printing and writing paper products because the own-price elasticity of import demand from the US to Canada is less than one for that industry. For US imports from Canada, the <b>cluster</b> <b>rule</b> decreased the value of trade flows in printing and writing paper and Kraft paper products. ...|$|R

NOCEA evolves individuals that consist of a variable number of non-overlapping <b>clustering</b> <b>rules,</b> where each rule includes d intervals, one for each feature. The encoding scheme is non-binary as the values for {{the boundaries of the}} intervals are drawn from discrete domains, which reflect the automatic quantization of the feature space. NOCEA uses a simple fitness function, which is radically different from any distancebased criterion function suggested so far. A density-based merging operator combines adjacent rules forming the genuine clusters in data. NO-CEA has been evaluated on challenging datasets and we present results showing that it meets many of the requirements for DM clustering, such as ability to discover clusters of different shapes, sizes, and densities. Moreover, NOCEA is independent of the order of input data and insensitive to the presence of outliers, and to initialization phase. Finally, the discovered knowledge is presented as a set of non-overlapping <b>clustering</b> <b>rules,</b> contributing to the interpretability of the results. ...|$|E

40|$|Conditional {{logistic}} regression (CLR) {{is widely used}} to analyze habitat selection and movement of animals when resource availability changes over space and time. Observations used for these analyses are typically autocorrelated, which biases model-based variance estimation of CLR parameters. This bias can be corrected using generalized estimating equations (GEE), an approach that requires partitioning the data into independent clusters. Here we establish the link between <b>clustering</b> <b>rules</b> in GEE and their effectiveness to remove statistical biases in variance estimation of CLR parameters. The current lack of guidelines is such that broad variation in <b>clustering</b> <b>rules</b> can be found among studies (e. g., 14 - 450 clusters) with unknown consequences on the robustness of statistical inference. We simulated datasets reflecting conditions typical of field studies. Longitudinal data were generated based on several parameters of habitat selection with varying strength of autocorrelation and some individuals having more observations than others. We then evaluated how changing the number of clusters impacted the effectiveness of variance estimators. Simulations revealed that 30 clusters were sufficient to get unbiased and relatively precise estimates of variance of parameter estimates. The use of destructive sampling {{to increase the number}} of independent clusters was successful at removing statistical bias, but only when observations were temporally autocorrelated and the strength of inter-individual heterogeneity was weak. GEE also provided robust estimates of variance for different magnitudes of unbalanced datasets. Our simulations demonstrate that GEE should be estimated by assigning each individual to a cluster when at least 30 animals are followed, or by using destructive sampling for studies with fewer individuals having intermediate level of behavioural plasticity in selection and temporally autocorrelated observations. The simulations provide valuable information to build reliable habitat selection and movement models that allow for robustness of statistical inference without removing excessive amounts of ecological information...|$|E
