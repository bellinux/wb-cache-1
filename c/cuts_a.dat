5|$|After about 10 days (1–3 weeks {{depending}} on temperatures), larvae hatch and bore directly throughout the pod walls and develop within the seed. Larvae are thus protected from {{biological and chemical}} control. Larval development lasts two to three months. Before entering its pupal stage, the larva <b>cuts</b> <b>a</b> circular cap. After around ten days of pupal stage, the adult emerges from the seeds. Because mating and oviposition are spread over a few weeks, adults can emerge before or after harvest.|$|E

There, he points the tank's cannon into the sky and shoots down a Major League Baseball satellite; inside are detailed documents on everybody's behaviors. Mark McGwire appears, distracts the citizens with a long home run, and hides the evidence under his cap. Marge takes Bart off Focusyn for good and puts him back on Ritalin. Major League Baseball, however, still spies on the Simpson family due to an autographed bat McGwire gave Bart that has a hidden camera.|$|E

5000|$|At least a {{score of}} decipherments have been claimed since then, none {{of which have been}} {{accepted}} by other rongorongo epigraphers. For instance, ethnographer Irina Fedorova published purported translations of the two St Petersburg tablets and portions of four others. More rigorous than most attempts, she restricts each glyph to a single logographic reading. However, the results make little sense as texts. For example, tablet P begins (with each rongorongo ligature marked by a comma in the translation): he <b>cut</b> <b>a</b> rangi sugarcane, a tara yam, he cut lots of taro, of stalks (?), he <b>cut</b> <b>a</b> yam, he harvested, he <b>cut</b> <b>a</b> yam, he <b>cut,</b> he pulled up, he <b>cut</b> <b>a</b> honui, he <b>cut</b> <b>a</b> sugarcane, he <b>cut,</b> he harvested, he took, a kihi, he chose a kihi, he took a kihi … Text P, recto, line 1 and continues in this vein to the end: he harvested a yam, a poporo, a calabash, he pulled up <b>a</b> yam, he <b>cut,</b> he cut one plant, he <b>cut</b> one plant, <b>a</b> yam, he <b>cut</b> <b>a</b> banana, he harvested <b>a</b> sugarcane, he <b>cut</b> <b>a</b> taro, he <b>cut</b> <b>a</b> kahu yam, a yam, a yam … Text P, verso, line 11 The other texts are similar.

It takes between five and ten minutes for a bed bug to become completely engorged with blood.

25|$|Eugene Field Park {{is located}} on 16 acres of land along the North Branch of the Chicago River in the Northwest Side {{neighborhood}} of Albany Park.

The Albany Park District made the first land purchases for what was then known as Central Park in 1923, but park improvements were not undertaken until 1925. The Albany Park District officially changed the park's name from Central Park to Eugene Field Park in November 1926. The park is named for Eugene Field, an important American writer; Field's name may have been selected through a contest held by the park district.
