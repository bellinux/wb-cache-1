In this form, EVM is closely related to Modulation error ratio, the ratio of mean signal power to mean error power.|$|R
50|$|Both {{the above}} MDCL methods (DDC and AMC) {{can be used}} {{simultaneously}} if desired. Some stations choose a mixture of DCC and AMC which uses a complex <b>carrier</b> vs. <b>modulation</b> curve, typically running less <b>carrier</b> for <b>modulation</b> in the 25% to 75% range, and with more carrier during peaks and pauses.|$|R

Towards this objective, three features are employed that include PSD and DFT of k th power of received signal. A new constellation-based feature for the classification of QAM and APSK signals is also proposed.|$|R
5000|$|Clock {{recovery}} is very {{closely related to}} the problem of carrier recovery, which is the process of re-creating a phase-locked version of the carrier when a suppressed <b>carrier</b> <b>modulation</b> scheme is used.

5000|$|Unproven {{technical}} {{claims of}} a single <b>carrier</b> <b>modulation</b> photon detector (SMPD) caused significant damages in the financial world, negatively affecting numerous people, as they caused the stock price of a start-up company (Planet82 [...] ) to soar (by 28 times [...] ) and plummet {{in a short period}} of time. During the short 'soaring' period, it is suspected that a small group of people, including the inventor, made significant financial gains.|$|E
50|$|Angle {{modulation}} is a {{class of}} <b>carrier</b> <b>modulation</b> that is used in telecommunications transmission systems. The class comprises frequency modulation (FM) and phase modulation (PM), and is respectively based on altering the frequency or the phase of a carrier signal to encode the message signal. This contrasts with varying the amplitude of the carrier, practiced in amplitude modulation (AM) transmission, the earliest of the major modulation methods used widely in early radio broadcasting.|$|E
30|$|The {{objective}} {{in this article}} is to develop a new decision tree-based AMC algorithm well-suited for the classification of most popular single <b>carrier</b> <b>modulations</b> used in HF communication systems, i.e., 2 FSK, 4 FSK, 8 FSK, 2 PSK, 4 PSK, 8 PSK, 16 QAM, 32 QAM, 64 QAM, 16 amplitude-phase shift keying (APSK), and 32 APSK ‎[1]. APSK is a digital modulation scheme that can be considered as a class of QAM in which symbols are always placed on equidistant concentric circles in the constellation diagram. This modulation scheme is known to have fewer problems with nonlinear amplifiers due to its constellation shape[29].|$|R

5000|$|Multiplexed {{binary offset}} <b>carrier</b> (MBOC) <b>{{modulation}}</b> [...] is a modulation proposed for Galileo and modernized GPS signals, which combines a sine binary offset carrier SinBOC(1,1) signal with a SinBOC(6,1) signal, either via weighted sum/difference (the CBOC implementation) or via time-multiplexing (the TMBOC implementation).|$|R

The TV program reported that the demonstration of the device performance was intentionally fabricated. It initiated the subsequent investigation by the Korean Government that confirmed the falsely claimed performance through its official report as shown {{in one of the}} TV program.|$|E
5000|$|Binary Offset <b>Carrier</b> <b>modulation</b> (BOC modulation) was {{developed}} by John Betz, PhD, {{in order to allow}} interoperability of satellite navigation systems. It is currently used in the US GPS system, Indian IRNSS system and in Galileo and is a square sub-carrier modulation, where a signal is multiplied by a rectangular sub-carrier of frequency [...] equal or higher to the chip rate. Following this sub-carrier multiplication, the spectrum of the signal is divided into two parts, therefore BOC modulation is also known as a split-spectrum modulation.|$|E
30|$|In this paper, {{we first}} examine {{the effect of}} Gaussian and bi-kappa noise models on wavelet, HOC, and TTD {{features}}, when these features are considered for the classification of single <b>carrier</b> <b>modulations</b> commonly used in HF band: 2 PSK, 4 PSK, 8 PSK, 16 QAM, 32 QAM, and 64 QAM [20]. Second, we propose new features based on maximum dissimilarity measures (MDM) in constellation diagram and evaluate their robustness against the change in noise model. Note that the contribution of this article is pertaining to the features extraction stage; hence the results obtained are independent of the classifier being used. However, these results will greatly serve the classifier design stage, as this stage can be based on features that are robust with respect to noise models.|$|R
40|$|New {{concepts}} in wireless communications, particularly cognitive radio, require high resolution spectrum analysis. Additional requirements for future broadband systems are high data rates in large transmission bandwidths and flexible spectrum allocation. It is {{shown that a}} multicarrier modulation technique based on filter banks {{has the potential to}} meet all these requirements, contrary to the existing OFDM schemes. A key element in the approach is the protype filter and a simple and efficient design is presented. Applications in wireless networks are briefly described, emphasizing the impact of the user spectrum separation provided by the filter bank. The mixing of multicarrier and single <b>carrier</b> <b>modulations,</b> which can be easily implemented, should be an important parameter for the optimization of future wireless and mobile networks...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThis article {{addresses}} a theoretical {{analysis of the}} Peak to Average Power Ratio (PAPR) of filtered single <b>carrier</b> <b>modulations</b> when Root-Raised Cosine (RRC) filters are considered. It is shown that two different behaviors occur for RRC filters when PAPR is derived, depending on the roll off factor, greater or not than a value around 0. 4. This analysis leads to an upper bound of the PAPR. Then, the influence of some parameters on the PAPR is analyzed, as the roll off, the filter length, the oversampling {{or the number of}} symbols. This study shows that PAPR distribution of single carrier signals weighted by a RRC filter is mainly influenced by the roll off factor, what has to be considered for efficient high power amplification...|$|R
50|$|As {{a general}} description, the {{following}} processes shall {{be applied to}} the transport stream: error-correction coding, time-interleaving and <b>carrier</b> <b>modulation.</b> The channel coding is conducted in units of OFDM segments as in ISDB-T. A set of segments defines a hierarchical layer, where the above-mentioned parameters can be specified independently. Up to three hierarchical layers can be provided, which include the partial reception layer defined by the central segment. In addition to the framing information, Brazilian specification includes the spectral composition for the hierarchical transmission, the means of sending multiple signals, and multiple tables in different layers.|$|E
5000|$|When Direct-To-Home {{satellite}} broadcasting {{first came to}} the UK, there was competition between Sky Television and BSB, each which used competing technologies. Sky used the already common PAL picture format, and shared space on the Astra 19.2°E Pan-European cluster of satellites, whereas BSB used D-MAC <b>carrier</b> <b>modulation,</b> a bespoke system designed by the Independent Broadcasting Authority (IBA). Alongside this, {{at the heart of the}} BSB advertising campaign was the 'Squarial', a diamond-shaped flat Satellite antenna, much smaller and (supposedly) aesthetically pleasing to the eye, unlike the 80CM dishes that were supplied by Sky. By developing such a bespoke system, BSB was significantly more expensive than Sky Television's satellite offering, and sign-up rates to BSB were low. Only 6 months after launch, the two companies merged to form British Sky Broadcasting, moving all customers to the cheaper, but inferior Astra and PAL system.|$|E
50|$|Sainton's 317C series {{consisted}} of a class C carrier tube in parallel connection with a class C peak tube. The tubes' source (driver) and load (antenna) were split and combined through + and − 90-degree phase-shifting networks as in a Doherty amplifier. The unmodulated radio frequency carrier {{was applied to the}} control grids of both tubes. <b>Carrier</b> <b>modulation</b> was applied to the screen grids of both tubes but the screen grid bias points of the carrier and peak tubes were different and were established such that the peak tube was cut off when modulation was absent and the amplifier was producing rated unmodulated carrier power and both tubes were conducting and each tube was contributing twice the rated carrier power during 100% modulation as four times the rated carrier power is required to achieve 100% modulation. As both tubes were operated in class C, a significant improvement in efficiency was thereby achieved in the final stage. In addition, as the tetrode carrier and peak tubes required very little drive power, a significant improvement in efficiency within the driver was achieved as well. The commercial version of the Sainton amplifier employed a cathode-follower modulator, not the push-pull modulator disclosed in the patent, and the entire 50,000-watt transmitter was implemented using only nine total tubes of four tube types, all of these being general-purpose, a remarkable achievement, given that the 317C's most significant competitor, RCA's BTA-50H, was implemented using thirty-two total tubes of nine tube types, nearly one-half of these being special-purpose, employed only in the BTA-50H. Over 200 CE 317C transmitters were installed in North America alone, easily outdistancing all competitors combined.|$|E
50|$|As a form {{of phase}} shift keying is used to {{transmit}} data during each burst, it would seem reasonable to expect the transmit power to be constant. However it is not. This is because the sidebands, which are essentially a repetition of the data in the main <b>carrier's</b> <b>modulation,</b> are filtered off with a sharp filter so that unnecessary spectrum is not used up. This results in an amplitude modulation and is why TETRA requires linear amplifiers. The resulting ratio of peak to mean (RMS) power is 3.65 dB. If non-linear (or not-linear enough) amplifiers are used, the sidebands re-appear and cause interference on adjacent channels. Commonly used techniques for achieving the necessary linearity include Cartesian loops, and adaptive predistortion.|$|R

40|$|In this paper, a {{frequency}} domain (FD) receiver architecture implemented using estimated channel parameters is derived for broadband single <b>carrier</b> <b>modulations.</b> Co-channel and inter-symbol interferences are compensated by a minimum {{mean squared error}} based integrated space-frequency-equalizer (SFE) using the estimated parameters. The integrated SFE in the FD consists of coupled FIR structures, that are jointly optimized by maximizing the desired signal to interference plus noise ratio. We develop analytical expressions and present simulation results for the integrated SFE. Simulation results demonstrate that excellent receiver performance is achieved even for channels with large ISI spans. The proposed SC-SFE outperforms previous layered space frequency (LSF) receivers with imperfect channel knowledge. Further, the parallel receiver architecture yields equal diversity gains to all data streams without the error propagation that is common to most LSF schemes...|$|R
