40|$|This {{study is}} about the agrarian reforms and {{policies}} of the military regime in Ethiopia {{in the period of}} its rule between 1974 and 1991. It is a descriptive and qualitative study of a set of agrarian policies which seeks to establish both the unrealized potential of the early and baisc reforms such as the 1975 Land Reform and Peasant Associations and the limitations of subsquent policies of <b>collectivization,</b> <b>compulsory</b> villagization, resettlement and centralized command procurement. An empirical case study of the effects of one of the policies, namely the villagization program is undertaken. The study seeks to place the description and analysis of the agrarian policies into a number of relevant contexts. First, an attempt was made to relate the discussion to questions of forms of peasant cooperation and state policy disincentive ont {{the one hand and the}} exigencies of prolonged war and rural conflict on agrarian policies on the other. Secondly, agarain policies are placed in theoretical framework through discussions of various perspectives and debates on subjects such as agarian transformation (socialist and capitalist), peasantry, state agrarian intervention and state-peasant relations. Thirdly, the study attempts to situate the analysis of the agaraian policies in relevant historical and politico-ideological contexts through a more or less detailed presentation of agrarian relations in Ethiopia before 1974 and the 1974 Ethiopian popular movement and analyze how these backgraound conditions influenced the nature and outcomes of the agarian policies of the military regime. The potentials and limitations of the agrarian policies of the regime are assessed in relation to the myth and reality of agrarian transition/transformation in Ethiopia in the period under consideration, the problems of rural institutions and state-peasant relations and the scholarly quest for comprehensive explanations of the Ethiopian experience in agarian policies. Finally, based on the Ethiopian experience the study raises issues such as forms of peasaqnt organization, organization of agricultural production and above all problems of state-peasant relations as major problem areas for future research both for equitable and broad-based agricultural growth as well as for peasant emancipation and participation which had been the promises of the 1974 popular movement but whose potentials failed to be realized to the fullest extent possible...|$|R

[...] Together with fellow secretaries Ölziin Badrakh and Bat-Ochiryn Eldev-Ochir (and later Zolbingiin Shijee) Genden pushed for rapid and forced implementation of socialist economic policies such as <b>compulsory</b> <b>collectivization,</b> the abolition of private enterprises and the closure of monasteries and the confiscation of church property. The policy proved disastrous as traditional herders were forced off the steppe and into badly managed collective farms, destroying one third of Mongolian livestock. Over 800 properties belonging to the nobility and the Buddhist church were confiscated and over 700 head of mostly noble households were executed. As a result, open revolt broke out in several provinces between 1930 and 1932. [...] In response, Moscow ordered the suspension of what it termed the “Leftist Deviation” policies of the Mongolian government and in May 1932 several party leaders (including Badrah, Shijee, and Prime Minister Tsengeltiin Jigjidjav) were purged for trying to implement socialist measures “prematurely”.|$|E

The Soviet authorities also suppressed the anti-Polish Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists, which had actively resisted the Polish regime since the 1920s; aiming for an independent, undivided Ukrainian state.

50|$|The Georgian {{population}} of Adjara had been generally known as Muslim Georgians until the 1926 Soviet census listed them as Adjarians, {{separate from the}} rest of Georgians, counting 71,426 of them. In subsequent censuses (1939-1989) they were listed with other Georgians, as no official Soviet census asked about religion. In the 1920s, the suppression of religion and <b>compulsory</b> <b>collectivization</b> led to armed resistance against Communist authorities by Adjarians. Following suppression of the disturbances, many Adjarians were deported to Central Asia.|$|E
5000|$|Farmers {{suffered}} through the 1950s: <b>compulsory</b> <b>collectivization</b> took their property, and the 1953 currency reform eradicated their savings. By the early 1960s, farm laborers worked longer than their nonagricultural counterparts and earned {{an average of}} 15% less. During the late 1960s and 1970s, agricultural earnings rose rapidly. Since the mid-1970s, the incomes of cooperative farm members and industrial workers have been comparable. So dramatic was the improvement that in a 1968 poll {{more than two-thirds of}} cooperative farm members preferred collectivized agricultural production to private farming.|$|E
5000|$|After World War II, Poland {{became a}} {{communist}} country, a satellite of the Soviet Union. Since collective farming {{is a key}} component of communist notion of agriculture, in June 1948, the Polish United Workers' Party decided to begin the process. From the very beginning, <b>compulsory</b> <b>collectivization</b> faced strong resistance of Polish farmers, {{who did not want to}} give up their land. Despite using different methods of persuasion, the progress was slow. By 1951, only 1% of arable land was collectivized, with some 23 000 farmers working there. Altogether, in that year there were some 2200 collective farms. Most of them were located in western and northern Poland, in the Recovered Territories, where population consisted of people resettled from former eastern borderlands of Poland.|$|E

5000|$|After the Second World War Petrevene was {{included}} in the Lovech District of P. R. Bulgaria. In 1946 it had 1254 inhabitants. In 1948, during the communist rule in Bulgaria, a <b>compulsory</b> <b>collectivization</b> of the farmlands was imposed and a Collective Farm, TKZS (Bulg.: [...] "ТКЗС") was established with Ivan Lakov as its first chairman. Petrevene's farmlands became collectively farmed and managed, and its agricultural capacity increased and became modernized. Twenty percent of the fields were allotted to the villagers for their own personal cultivation, but they were still required to work in the TKZS on the main fields. A system was set up where every farmer was entitled to four tons of wheat for personal consumption per year. Four tons being too much to consume or use, the farmers were then encouraged to return two tons to the newly built TKZS bakery in exchange for coupons entitling them to two loafs of black and one loaf of white bread a day. A manufacturing plant (called the [...] "Promkombinat") was founded by the Cooperative Bank [...] "Zhetvarka". In 1950 the Bank was renamed as All-purpose Cooperative [...] "Zhetvarka". The [...] "Promkombinat" [...] has employed 100 people. In 1955 it produced 2572 ovens of [...] "Pernik" [...] style. In 1956 by the order of the local authorities and despite the disagreement and the resistance of the local population, the [...] "Promkombinat" [...] has been closed. Its equipment and machinery were moved to the town of Lukovit. The reason for this action has been {{to increase the number of}} the people working in the TKZS. In fact, most of the employees in the [...] "Promkombinat", together with their families, moved away from the village to other localities in the region, instead of enrolling in the TKZS.

40|$|Using an institutionalist {{approach}} {{as the main}} framework, this research examines the evolution of Vietnamese agricultural cooperatives {{over the last six}} decades through four distinct phases - the voluntary collectivization period of 1954 - 1975, the <b>compulsory</b> <b>collectivization</b> period of 1975 - 1981, the de-collectivization period of 1981 - 1997 and the neo-collectivization period since 1997. Based on two case studies, this research examines the role of the Vietnamese government in the development of Vietnamese agricultural cooperatives. It argues that a stable legal environment and appropriate government support are extremely important for the successful development of cooperatives. In terms of theoretical contribution, the study calls for an integration of the notion of institutional dynamics into the current 2 ̆ 7 static 2 ̆ 7 institutionalism and emphasizes the need to analyse institutions 2 ̆ 7 influences at central, local and organizational levels to understand the formation and development of organizations. It also offers some policy implications that are relevant to the development of cooperatives in other economies...|$|E
