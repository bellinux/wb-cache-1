5|$|The high scoring game set several {{school and}} conference records: the 132-point {{combined}} score was the highest-scoring {{game of the}} year in major college football (so far), and the highest in both the 131-year history of Michigan football and {{in the history of the}} Big Ten. The Illini's 65 points were the most ever allowed by Michigan. They also established Michigan records for <b>combined</b> <b>points</b> in a half (62) and <b>combined</b> <b>points</b> in a quarter (49). Michigan's previous records in those categories were: 130 points (vs. West Virginia, 1904), 55 points (vs. Chicago, 1939) and 39 points (vs. Penn State, 2005), respectively. This game was the highest scoring FBS game since Navy and North Texas met on November 10, 2007, which Navy won 74–62. Robinson threw a career-high 305 yards, as well as a school record 262 yards in the first half. Michigan's 419 passing yards broke the previous single game record of 396 yards, which was set against Michigan State in 1999. Roy Roundtree had a school-record 246 yards receiving, breaking the previous mark of 197 yards by Jack Clancy. The two teams combined for a total of 1,237 yards of offense, breaking the record of 1,189 set against Northwestern in 2000. With the win, Michigan became bowl eligible for the first time since Rich Rodriguez began his tenure as head coach.|$|E

5|$|With a {{combined}} 136total points scored between both teams, the game set an NCAA Division I FBS {{record for most}} points scored in a regulation-length game (breaking the previous record of 133points set when the San Jose State Spartans defeated the Rice Owls 70–63 in 2004). The 63 <b>combined</b> <b>points</b> {{in the second quarter}} and 94 points scored in the first half set NCAA records. The game capped off a monthlong period during which four of the five highest-scoring college football games were played. Giovanni Vizza's eight touchdown passes – equaling the total from his previous four games – set an NCAA record for most touchdown passes by a freshman in a single game. The Midshipmen set a school record by running for 572 yards (with 8 rushing touchdowns) in the game, and tied another school record by scoring at least 30points for an eighth consecutive game. A freshman Midshipman (plebe) doing the correct number of push-ups for scoring would have done 486 push-ups (3+10+17+24+31+38+45+51+58+65+67+74) during the game.|$|E
5|$|Returning to Soldier Field for week four, the Bears {{hosted the}} Oakland Raiders, who held a 7–6 all-time lead {{entering}} the game. This {{was the first}} game between the two at Soldier Field since 2003, where the Bears won 24–21, and the first since 2011, when the Raiders won 25–20 in Oakland. The Bears offense faced a defense led by defensive end Khalil Mack, while the secondary is guided by 39-year old Charles Woodson, who possessed 61 career interceptions, and had sealed the Raiders' win the previous week against the Browns. However, the Raiders had struggled against tight ends, allowing five catches of at least 25 yards, {{with a total of}} 20 catches for 298 yards and five touchdowns across the first three games. On defense, Chicago was against quarterback Derek Carr, who led the Raiders offense to 74 <b>combined</b> <b>points</b> in the last two games, along with rookie receiver Amari Cooper, who had 20 receptions entering the game, while also recording a 68-yard touchdown in week two. Jeff Joniak wrote that the Bears had to prevent the Raiders from gaining yardage after touching the ball; the Raiders were seventh in yards after the catch, while Latavius Murray – who had recorded 139 rushing yards in week three, was ranked fourth in the league in rushing yards and was leading the AFC in yards per carry with 4.8 – ranked fifth in yards after contact. Cooper had 177 yards after the catch, the second-most in the league among wide receivers, while 53.7 percent of Carr's passing yards occurred due to these plays. In comparison, the Bears allowed the fewest yards after contact. David Fales, punter Patrick O’Donnell, Alshon Jeffery, Ka’Deem Carey, Hroniss Grasu, tackle Jermon Bushrod and nose tackle Jeremiah Ratliff were inactive.|$|E

40|$|In {{the current}} practice, changes that {{occurred}} in the construction or renovation phase are not frequently captured and updated to as-built documentations. As a semantically rich digital representation, a building information model (BIM) can be used as an information repository to store and deliver as-built information. Since a building might not be constructed exactly as its design specifies, discrepancies might exist between BIMs created based on design information and actual building conditions. It is important to keep information stored in a BIM accurate and complete so that it servers as a reliable data source throughout the service life of a facility. Point cloud data captured by laser scans is capable of providing accurate 3 D depiction of building conditions. Hence, point cloud data can be used as the reference to update the information contained in an as-designed BIM. There are two main challenges associated with the update process. First, in order to recognize the differences between a point cloud and an as-designed BIM, segments captured by the point cloud need to be matched to building components modeled in the BIM. However, a building component might have different shapes, dimensions, and locations in a point cloud as compared to how it is modeled in an as-designed BIM. The discrepancies between a point cloud and an as-designed BIM increase the complexity of matching the two data sets together. Second, occlusions and construction progress prevent a laser scan performed at a single point in time from capturing a complete set of geometric information associated with a building. While it is possible to retrieve more geometric information by <b>combining</b> <b>point</b> clouds captured at different points in time, the large file size of a <b>combined</b> <b>point</b> cloud make it difficult to process and store. Hence, {{there is a need for}} an approach to achieve the balance between the richness of the information provided by a <b>combined</b> <b>point</b> cloud and the file size of it. In order to address the above two challenges, this research aims to develop a framework that supports the update process by matching information from a point cloud to a BIM and leveraging point clouds captured at different times to provide a more complete and accurate reference. To develop such a framework, this research developed the following research objectives: (1) Identifying a general set of features that can be applied to recognize correspondences between a point cloud and a BIM. (2) Developing matching approaches that match point cloud segments to BIM components based on different types of features. (3) Conducting an experimental analysis to evaluate the performances of the developed matching approaches and effectiveness of the features used by these approaches. (4) Developing an approach that selects and <b>combines</b> <b>point</b> clouds captured at different times in order to reduce the file size of <b>combined</b> <b>point</b> cloud while maintaining the completeness of geometric information...|$|R
