40|$|Analytical {{time-dependent}} functions {{describing the}} change of the concentration of the solvent S(t) and the homeopathic active substance A(t) during the decimal and <b>centesimal</b> <b>dilution</b> are derived. The function S(t) is a special case of the West-Brown-Enquist curve describing the ontogenic growth, hence the increase in concentration of the solvent during potentization resembles the growth of biological systems. It is proven that the macroscopic S(t) function is the ground state solution of the microscopic non-local Horodecki-Feinberg equation for the time-dependent Hulthen potential at the critical screening. In consequence the potentization belongs to the class of quasi-quantum phenomena playing an important role both in the biological systems and homeopathy. A comparison of the model proposed with recently performed experiment on delayed luminescence of the homeopathic remedy will be also made. Comment: 11 pages, 1 table, 1 figur...|$|E
40|$|Solutions of LiCl and of NaCl in {{ultrapure water}} were studied through Rayleigh/Brillouin {{scattering}} {{as a function}} of the concentration (molarity, M) of dissolved salt from 0. 2 M to extremely low concentration (2. 10 ^- 17 M). The Landau-Placzek ratio, R/B, of the Rayleigh scattering intensity over the total Brillouin, was measured thanks to the dynamically controlled stability of the used Fabry-Perot interferometer. It was observed that the R/B ratio follows two stages {{as a function of}} increasing dilution rate: after a strong decrease between 0. 2 M and 2. 10 ^- 5 M, it increases to reach a maximum between 10 ^- 9 M and 10 ^- 16 M. The first stage corresponds to the decrease of the Rayleigh scattering by the ion concentration fluctuations with the decrease of salt concentration. The second stage, at lower concentrations, is consistent with the increase of the Rayleigh scattering by long-lived sub-microscopic bubbles with the decrease of ion concentration. The origin of these sub-microscopic bubbles is the shaking of the solutions which was carried out after each <b>centesimal</b> <b>dilution.</b> The very long lifetime of the sub-microscopic bubbles and the effects of aging originate in the electric charge of bubbles. The increase of R/B with the decrease of the low salt concentration corresponds to the increase of the sub-microscopic bubble size with the decrease of concentration, that is imposed by the bubble stability due to the covering of the surface bubble by negative ions.

Several physical methods have already been applied to investigate homeopathic preparations but it is yet unclear which methods are best suited to identify characteristic physicochemical properties of homeopathic preparations. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate homeopathic preparations with UV-spectroscopy. In a blinded, randomized, controlled experiment homeopathic preparations of copper sulfate (CuSO 4; 11 c– 30 c), quartz (SiO 2; 10 c– 30 c, i. e., <b>centesimal</b> <b>dilution</b> steps) and sulfur (S; 11 ×– 30 ×, i. e., decimal dilution steps) and controls (one-time succussed diluent) were investigated using UV-spectroscopy and tested for contamination by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). The UV transmission for homeopathic preparations of CuSO 4 preparations was significantly lower than in controls. The transmission seemed to be also lower for both SiO 2 and S, but not significant. The mean effect size (95 % confidence interval) was similar for the homeopathic preparations: CuSO 4 (pooled data) 0. 0544 % (0. 0260 – 0. 0827 %), SiO 2 0. 0323 % (– 0. 0064 % to 0. 0710 %) and S 0. 0281 % (– 0. 0520 % to 0. 1082 %). UV transmission values of homeopathic preparations had a significantly higher variability compared to controls.

To clarify the point, we performed a comparative analysis of the effects of dilutions 5, 9 and 15 [*]cH of G. sempervirens or gelsemine (the major active principle of G. sempervirens) on allopregnanolone (3 α, 5 α-THP) production in the rat limbic system (hippocampus and amygdala or H-A) and spinal cord (SC). Indeed, H-A and SC are two pivotal structures controlling, respectively, anxiety and pain that are also modulated by the neurosteroid 3 α, 5 α-THP. At the dilution 5 [*]cH, both G. sempervirens and gelsemine stimulated [3 H]progesterone conversion into [3 H] 3 α, 5 α-THP by H-A and SC slices, and the stimulatory effect was fully (100 %) reproducible in all assays. The dilution 9 [*]cH of G. sempervirens or gelsemine also stimulated 3 α, 5 α-THP formation in H-A and SC but the reproducibility rate decreased to 75 %.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to obtain {{information}} about the influence of successive dilutions and successions on the water structure. “Extremely diluted solutions” (EDS) are solutions obtained through the iteration of two processes: dilution in stages of 1 : 100 and succussion typically used in homeopathic medicine. The iteration is carried out until extreme dilutions are reached, so that the chemical composition of the solution is identical to that of the solvent. Nine different preparations, were studied from the 3 cH up to 30 cH (Hanhemannian <b>Centesimal</b> <b>Dilution).</b> Four of those were without the active principle (potentized water). Two different active principles were used: Arsenicum Sulphuratum Rubrum (ASR), As 4 S 4, 2, 4 -dichlorophenoxicacethic acid (2, 4 D). The solvents were: a solution of sodium bicarbonate and of silicic acid at 5. 10 - 5 M (mol/L) each, and solutions of sodium bicarbonate 5. 10 - 5, 7. 5. 10 - 5 and 10. 10 - 5 M (mol/L) in double distilled water. The containers were in Pyrex glass to avoid the release of alkaline oxide and silica from the walls. Conductivity measurements of the solutions were carried out as a function of the age of the potencies. We found increases of electrical conductivity compared to untreated solvent. Successive dilutions and succussions can permanently alter the physico-chemical properties of the aqueous solvent. But we also detected changes in phtsico-chemical parameters with time. This has not previouslybeen reported. The modification of the solvent could provide an important support to the validity of homeopathic medicine, that employs “remedies without molecules”.

40|$|Background: Inhibition {{of human}} {{basophil}} activation by highly diluted histamine {{was reported to}} be a reliable experimental model to examine biological effects of high dilutions. However, independent replications did not always yield concordant results. &# 13; Aims: We aimed at performing an independent replication of a former study [1] using rigorously controlled experimental conditions to minimise confounding factors. &# 13; Materials and Methods: In 20 independent experiments, human basophils were treated with highly diluted histamine (15 cH, 16 cH, corresponding to 10 - 30 - 10 - 32 M) prior to activation by fMLP (formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine peptide). Controls were treated with analogously diluted water (15 cH, 16 cH). The dilutions were prepared freshly for each experiment in deionised water by successive steps of <b>centesimal</b> <b>dilution</b> and agitation (10 s vortex at high speed). Highly diluted samples were blinded and randomised. All samples were set in triplicates. Activated basophils were determined by flow cytometry using anti-CD 203 c. 20 independent systematic negative control (SNC) experiments were carried out to investigate possible systematic errors. &# 13; Results: No difference in basophil activation was observed between the highly diluted histamine samples and the highly diluted water controls. There was no evidence for a blood donor specificity of the results. The SNC experiments demonstrated the stability of the test system. Experimental variability within and between experiments was slightly reduced for the highly diluted histamine samples. &# 13; Discussion: This study was designed as an independent reproduction of a former study [1]. Though we strictly adopted the experimental procedure described in [1], our results do not confirm the large inhibitory effects observed for histamine 15 cH and 16 cH. This lack of reproducibility might be due to minor differences in the experimental design, such as blinding and randomising of the samples, which we chose to perform {{in order to reduce the}} possibility of artifacts but was omitted in the former study. &# 13; Conclusions: Laboratory independent replication of homeopathic basic research experiments is still a challenge. Assuming that the results formerly obtained with this model were not due to systematic errors, the quest identifying the crucial factors for successful reproducibility is open for future research. &# 13; Keywords: Human basophils; histamine; high dilutions; flow cytometry&# 13; Reference:&# 13; [1] Sainte-Laudy J, Belon P.

The knowledge acquired in homeopathic science is experimental research on healthy living organisms that are undergoing experimentation using homeopathic medicines [2]. The experimental research on homeopathic plants has been performed in Europe, Mexico, India and Brazil, proving that the principle of homeopathy, as set out in the animal kingdom has been found in plants [3]. This experiment aimed to evaluate the effect of the homeopathic Arsenicum album in decimal (x) and centesimal (cH) scale on the physiological variables of the germination and growth of sorghum (Sorghum bicolor L.) subjected to {{accelerated aging}}. &# 13; &# 13; Materials and methods: The experiment was conducted at the Laboratory of Plant Physiology and Homeopathy, Universidade Estadual de MaringÃƒÂ¡ - UEM. Arsenicum album 6 x and 2 CH matrices were acquired in homeopathic pharmacy. From matrices were prepared further dynamizations in decimal (x) and centesimal (C) scale, according to the Brazilian Homeopathic Pharmacopoeia [4]. In the accelerated aging test were used samples of 200 seeds per treatment distributed evenly forming a single layer on the surfaces of metal wire suspended inside the plastic box containing inside 40 ml of Arsenicum album (9, 12, 18, or 30 x 24 and 9, 12, 18, 24 or 30 C). The control consisted of distilled water. The boxes were placed in BOD-chamber adjusted to 42 Ã‚Â°C and relative humidity 100 % for 96 hours. After this period, led to the germination test, using four replicates of 50 seeds, totalizing 52 experimental units which were placed on germination paper previously soaked with distilled water in an amount equivalent to 2. 5 times the paper weight[5]. The rolls were arranged randomly in the BOD-chamber at 25 Ã‚Â°CÃ‚Â± 2. The interpretation of the test was performed after seven days [6]. Germination percentage (% PG) was determined according to the Rules for Seed Analysis [5]. The length of primary roots (PRL) and hypocotyl (LH) were only performed in normal seedlings. The total length of the radicle (TLR) was calculated as the sum of the lengths of hypocotyl and primary root. The experimental design was completely randomized. We adopted the double-blind procedure, avoiding possible interference from the researcher. Data were subjected to analysis of variance and means compared by Scott-Knott test (P Ã¢â€°Â¤ 0. 05). &# 13; &# 13; Results: Arsenicum album 9 x, 9 CH and 12 CH reduced the percentage of germination (%PG) (Figure 1 A). The highest values in the length of hypocotyl (LH) Ã¢â‚¬â€¹Ã¢â‚¬â€¹were observed in 12 and 24 x dilutions, followed by a reduction in intermediate and higher inhibition at 30 x and 9 x. The 18 x does not differ from control. All <b>centesimal</b> <b>dilution</b> presented effect on the variable analyzed. There was an increase in hypocotyl length in the 12, 18 and 24 dilutions, and reduction in 9 and 30 cH dilutions (Figure 1 B). The primary root length (PRL) of sorghum was increased in dilutions 18 and 30 x. However, the centesimal dilutions were not different from control (Figure 1 C). There was an increase in the total length of the seedlings (TLS) in the dilutions 18, 24 and 30 x and reduction in 9 x when compared to control. As for centesimal dilutions, there was an effect only in 18 cH. The other centesimal dilutions were not different from control (Figure 1 D). &# 13; &# 13; Conclusions: In general, homeopathic preparations did not affect the germination percentage except for 9 x, and 9 cH 12 cH dilution. Furthermore, the dilutions reduced the effects on premature aging verified by high values Ã¢â‚¬â€¹Ã¢â‚¬â€¹of growth variables. These results suggest that high dilution Arsenicum album can be an alternative to minimize the deleterious effect to high temperature...|$|E

Several independent series of samples were measured according to a blind protocol (total of 140 code-labelled samples). A slight frequency dispersion (about 4 %) was found within the 0. 02 - 4 MHz range, centered around 0. 55 MHz, and ascribed to combined effects of silica and trace paramagnetic contaminants, both concentrated and in a reduced motion at the borosilicate wall tube interface. The iterative dilution-agitation process in pure water and saline induced no significant effect on relaxivity. Slightly increased relaxivity compared to solvent {{was found in the}} initial silica-lactose dilution (especially in saline, about 4 %), which vanished unexpectedly slowly upon dilution, as adjusted to an arbitrary log-linear model. Statistical analysis was applied to succeed in discriminating solutions from their solvents beyond the 10 - 12 level of dilution. No clear explanation emerged, but post-experiment chemical analysis revealed high amounts (6 ppm) of released silica from the glass material used, with excess in silica-lactose samples, and lower amounts of trace paramagnetic contaminants in highly diluted silica-lactose samples, which could provide a clue.

Subsequent dilutions of low molecular phenolic metabolites, appropriate for studied enzymatic systems, prepared in 75 % ethanol in the proportion of 1 : 100 (centesimal) and dynamized by shaking in accordance with homeopathic procedures were prepared in our laboratory. During experiments with bacterial and fungal materials and a pure plant peroxidase, which were incubated together with subsequent dilutions of proper phenolic effector, different analytic methods were used including a gel (PAGE) [4] and capillary (MEKCE) electrophoresis [5], spectral and colorimetric methods [1, 2, 3] as well as the electron microscopy [5]. &# 13; Results: In the light of presented data [1 - 5], the incubation of biological material with diluted phenolic effectors induces various effects on tested enzyme activity. It changed in sinusoidal manner with an gradual growth of dilution rate of tested effectors, which was distinctly visible on the diagram when the number of dilutions was localized on abscissa and biological activity on the ordinate. &# 13; Exemplary results of the chosen experiments will be presented. For tested enzymes: laccase, peroxidase and O-demethylase, the distance between maximal points of enzymatic activity, shown on a sine curve, repeats more often every 10 subsequent <b>centesimal</b> <b>dilutions.</b> Along with the extension of incubation period the displacement of maximal and minimal points on curve were noticed, which revealed a dynamic aspect of studied phenomenon. &# 13; Conclusions: Fungal and bacterial cells seem to be a very convenient material for studying the action of diluted metabolites on enzymatic systems because their popular presence in environment.

40|$|Background: Groundwater arsenic affects {{millions}} of people in about 20 countries. In West Bengal (India) and Bangladesh alone over 100 million people are exposed. The arsenic concentration in contaminated groundwater in Bangladesh was above the maximum permissible level of 0. 05 mg/l as recommended by WHO for developing countries [1]. Drinking water is not the only source of poisoning. In arsenic contaminated areas, crops, vegetables, cereals, poultry, cattle, etc, also contain traces of arsenic. Chronic arsenic intoxication has been associated with several diseases such as melanosis, leuco-melanosis, hyperkeratosis, oedema, skin cancerÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ &# 13; Cazin et al [2], have demonstrated the effect of high dilutions of arsenic compounds. They noted increased arsenic elimination from blood through urine and faeces in intoxicated rats. According to these research, the aim of Khuda Buksh studies [3 - 4 - 5] was to investigate whether high dilution Arsenicum album have any effect on arsenic accumulation in different tissues and to understand also how this high dilution could produce a protective effect on all the different organs. &# 13; Methodology: Firstly, the effect of Arsenicum album 30 cH on the amount of arsenic accumulation was determined by spectrophotometric analysis in four tissues namely liver, kidney and testis in mice intoxicated by arsenic. The protective effect in chronic and acute arsenic intoxicated mice of Arsenicum Album 6 cH, 30 cH and 200 cH has been evaluated using not only the activities of enzymatic and biomarker toxicity (aspartate amino transferase (AST), alanine amino transferase (ALT), acid phosphatase (AcP), alkaline phosphatase (AlkP), lipid peroxidation (LPO) and reduced glutathione (GSH)) but also the cytogenetical parameters (chromosome aberrations (CA), mitotic index (MI), sperm head anomaly (SHA) etc.,). Because, it is well demonstrated that these enzymes biomarkers reflect the degree of hepatotoxicity and oxidative stress caused by arsenic intoxication. &# 13; Results: Compared to controls, Arsenicum album 30 cH induced a significant decrease in accumulation of arsenic in 4 tissues namely liver, spleen, kidney and testis in intoxicated mice. In addition, both Arsenicum album 6 cH, 30 cH and 200 cH reduced chromosome aberrations, sperm head abnormality frequencies and activities of acid and alkaline phosphatases, aspartate and alanine aminotransferases and lipid peroxidation, while mitotic index and activities of glutathione, catalase and succinate dehydrogenase were increased compared to controls. &# 13; Conclusion: Altogether, theses results provide evidence of protective potentials of the Arsenicum album dilution against acute and chronic arsenic intoxication in mice. They also offer a new hypothesis that the mechanism of the homeopathic dilution could act through regulation of expression of certain genes. This explanation seems to be plausible because all biomarker tests are regulated by specific genetic regulatory mechanisms [6]. &# 13; keywords: Arsenicum album, arsenic intoxication, enzymatic and biomarker toxicity. &# 13; References:&# 13; [1] WHO.
