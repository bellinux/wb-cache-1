40|$|Microencapsulation is a {{technology}} {{used to cover}} an active core with one or few capsulating materials. This technology is used in different industries such as pharmacology, chemistry, cosmetics, food and dye. Microencapsulation thecnique in food industry, generally, is utilised to improve the functional properties and to increase the shelf life of foods by capsulating the liquid droplets, solid particles and gas components with food grade coating materials. Mostly microencapsulated foods or food contstituents are solid and liquid fats, aroma components, vitamins, minerals, coloring compounds and enzymes. Capsulating materials mostly used are starch, maltodextrin, pullulan, sucrose, maltose in carbohydrate structure; gelatin, whey proteins, <b>casein</b> <b>and</b> <b>caseinates</b> in protein structure and some gams like gam arabic.

40|$|The climates of {{many areas}} in Asia, Central America, the Middle East and Africa make it {{difficult}} to support a dairy industry based on fresh milk. In these areas the shelf life of fresh, undried milk products is short. Concentrated and dry milk products have increased storage stability because of a lower water activity and are therefore desirable in regions with such climatic conditions. Concentrated milk products are obtained from milk by the application of one or a combination of water removal techniques. Drying of these products can reduce the water content to below 3 %. The reduction in water content of milk will increase shelf life and reduce transportation costs. This is particularly important for manufacturers that export products to distant markets. These products may be recombined (water and a combination of ingredients added) or reconstituted (just water added) and then packed and sold by a food retailer, or sold directly to the consumer as a dry or concentrated product, e. g. whole milk powder (WMP) or canned evaporated milk. The range of concentrated and spray-dried dairy powders commercially produced today is wide and includes ultra-high-temperature (UHT) treated concentrated milks, in-can sterilised milks, skim milk powder, WMP, formulated infant food powders, high protein powders and high fat powders, whey powders, buttermilk powders, cream powders, <b>casein</b> <b>and</b> <b>caseinates.</b> Lately, membrane technology, e. g. ultrafiltration, has improved and applications have been developed for many processes leading to the production of a new range of concentrated and dried products, e. g. milk protein and whey protein concentrates...|$|E
40|$|A {{comparative}} fining {{trial was}} conducted in a laboratory scale to study the influence of protein fining agents on proanthocyanidins, colour and browning potential of white wine. The monomeric flavanols were significantly depleted by <b>casein,</b> <b>and</b> gelatine with low molecular weight (MW) distribution, and isinglass obtained from fish swim bladder (MW > 94. 0, containing some bands in the range 94. 0 – 43. 0 and at 20. 1 kDa). However, the other gelatines and isinglass with a MW polydispersion below 20. 1 kDa did not interact significantly (P < 0. 05) with these compounds. In contrast, the oligomeric compounds were not decreased by swim bladder isinglass. It was also observed that neither of the isinglasses decreased the polymeric flavanols significantly (P < 0. 05). Although <b>casein</b> <b>and</b> potassium <b>caseinate</b> had similar MW distributions and isoelectric points, potassium caseinate decreased the polymeric flavanols, whereas casein did decrease monomeric, oligomeric and polymeric flavanols significantly (P < 0. 05).

40|$|International audienceYogurts are {{important}} dairy products that have known a rapid market {{growth over the}} past few decades. Industrial yogurt manufacture involves different processing steps. Among them, protein fortification of the milk base is elemental. It greatly enhances yogurt nutritional and functional properties and prevents syneresis, an undesirable yogurt textural defect. Protein enrichment can be achieved by either concentration process (evaporation under vacuum and membrane processing: reverse osmosis and/or ultrafiltration) or by addition of dairy ingredients. Traditionally, skim milk powder (SMP) is used to enrich the milk base before fermentation. However, increased quality and availability of other dairy ingredients such as milk protein isolates (MPI), milk protein concentrates (MPC) whey protein isolates (WPI) and concentrates (WPC), micellar <b>casein</b> (MC) <b>and</b> <b>caseinates</b> have promoted their use as alternatives to SMP. Substituting different dry ingredients for skim milk powder in yogurt making affects the yogurt mix protein composition and subsequent textural and sensorial properties. This review focuses on various type of milk protein used for fortification purposes and their influence on these properties...|$|R
40|$|Preliminary {{experiments}} {{indicated that}} an acid casein co-precipitate could {{be produced by}} extrusion from skim milk powder (SMP). In assessing the problems encountered, experiments were designed to model and optimize the coagulation/washing process using response surface methodology (RSM), to minimize residual whey components and losses of fines. This study yielded useful information relative to improving {{our understanding of the}} coagulation mechanism and the most important variables affecting the process. In addition, RSM allowed multiresponse optimization of acid casein production using unique and newly developed optimization techniques. In order to simplify the process, an extruder die was designed to assist with the dewheying process, however, plugging problems occurred due to screw design limitations. Studies were implemented to determine the rheological behaviour of sodium <b>caseinate</b> <b>and</b> to evaluate the extruder performance in terms of energy consumption, and in terms of mixing and conveying through mathematical description of residence time distributions in the extruder. The knowledge gained from these studies was integrated to produce acid <b>casein</b> <b>and</b> sodium <b>caseinate</b> at pilot plant level and to conceive a plant layout of the process for the dairy industry.

MÉTODOS: Estudo transversal, descritivo, baseado em entrevista com familiares de pacientes. Inicialmente, aplicou-se um questionário sobre o hábito de leitura de rótulos e identificação de termos relacionados ao leite e, posteriormente, apresentaram-se rótulos de 12 produtos industrializados para que os familiares decidissem sobre a sua exclusão da dieta do paciente. RESULTADOS: Dos 52 entrevistados, 80, 8 % eram mães e 79, 0 % apresentavam nível médio ou {{superior}} de escolaridade. A mediana do tempo em seguimento já com orientação para dieta de exclusão era de dois anos e sete meses (três meses a 17 anos e seis meses). A leitura habitual de rótulos de alimentos, medicamentos e cosméticos foi relatada por 57, 7 %, 59, 6 % e 46, 2 % dos familiares, respectivamente. Entre as reações alérgicas ocorridas no seguimento, 39, 5 % foram relacionadas a erros na leitura de rótulos. Lactose, caseína e caseinato foram os termos identificados por 92, 3 %, 38, 5 % e 23, 1 % dos familiares, respectivamente. Lactato foi interpretado como presença de leite de vaca por 51, 9 % dos entrevistados. Na segunda etapa, os familiares identificaram a lactose (55, 8 %), a caseína (26, 9 %) e o caseinato (5, 8 %) como substâncias relacionadas ao leite. CONCLUSÕES: Constatou-se deficiente compreensão e identificação, por parte dos pais, dos termos relacionados ao leite apesar das orientações recebidas. É fundamental a adequação da rotulagem e a adoção de novas estratégias para orientação da leitura de rótulos, possibilitando a busca e a identificação de produtos que contenham leite de vaca. OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate the}} ability of relatives of patients with cow's milk allergy to identify terms related to cow's milk on labels of manufactured products. METHODS: Cross-sectional descriptive study {{based on interviews with}} relatives of patients with cow's milk allergy. Initially, a questionnaire about the habit of reading labels and the identification of terms related to cow's milk was applied. Next, 12 original labels of manufactured products were shown to the interviewees so that they could decide whether to exclude or not those products from the patient's diet. RESULTS: Of the 52 interviewees, 80. 8 % were mothers and 79. 0 % had at least 8 years of schooling. The median time of follow-up after receiving information about exclusion diet was 2 years and 7 months (from 3 months to 17 years and 6 months). The habit of reading labels of foods, drugs and cosmetics was reported by 57. 7, 59. 6, and 46. 2 % of the relatives, respectively. Among the allergic reactions during follow-up, 39. 5 % were related to mistakes when reading labels. Lactose, <b>casein,</b> <b>and</b> <b>caseinate</b> were the terms identified by 92. 3, 38. 5, and 23. 1 % of the family members, respectively.

40|$|In the Iberian Peninsula, the proteinases {{present in}} the flowers {{of members of the}} Cynara genus, C. cardunculus, C. humilis and C. scolymus, have for many years been {{successfully}} used in the manufacture of traditional cheeses from ovine and/or caprine milk on individual farms (Vieira de Sá & Barbosa, 1972; Trujillo et al. 1994). In Portugal, C. cardunculus is the species most frequently employed. Although commercial thistle was tentatively assumed to be pure in taxonomic terms, accurate analyses have shown that the flowers of C. cardunculus are often mixed with flowers of C. humilis (Pires et al. 1994). The clotting activity of C. humilis is due to an aspartic proteinase, currently designated cardosin A and similar to another enzyme obtained from C. cardunculus. This enzyme is similar in specificity and activity to chymosin (Pires et al. 1994). The action of cardosin A from C. cardunculus upon ovine <b>and</b> caprine <b>caseins</b> has been reported recently (Ramalho-Santos et al. 1996; Simo 4 es, 1998; Sousa & Malcata, 1998), but as yet there is no information on the proteolytic activity of the proteinase from C. humilis upon caseins from milks other than bovine. Caseins from small ruminants' milks are the usual substrates of cardosin during milk coagulation and cheese ripening, <b>and</b> sodium <b>caseinate</b> represents an intermediate system between isolated <b>caseins</b> <b>and</b> the cheese matrix that is free from interference by fat.

Scope and approach This review summarizes the unique properties of <b>caseins</b> <b>and</b> the <b>casein</b> micelle <b>and</b> how these properties enhance the successful delivery of sensitive food ingredients and bioactives.

Also the cationbinding capacity of <b>casein</b> was studied <b>and</b> found to depend on several factors. By simultaneous titration at constant pH of calcium hydroxide and phosphoric acid, a complex phosphate was precipitated (relation Ca/P about 1. 4), which is neither an orthophosphate, nor a hydroxy-apatite.
