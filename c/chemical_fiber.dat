5000|$|Even while Pagenstecher was {{starting}} up the Hudson River mill, in 1869 Illustrious Remington {{and his three}} sons, Hiram, Alfred D. and Charles R., were making a ton of newsprint daily in Watertown, New York, using four rag machines and an 84" [...] fourdrinier machine. By 1870, the Remingtons, seeing a future for wood pulp, built three mills on Sewall's Island in Watertown. These mills used the Voelter process allowing a low-cost, high-quality Remington newsprint {{to be made of}} 75% rags and 25% wood pulp instead of all-rag content paper costing five times more. A third invention caught the imagination of the Remingtons. In 1867, Benjamin Tilghman, an American chemist, discovered that sulphurous acid (H2SO3) dissolved the lignin in wood, leaving a residue of cellulose fibers. Nought came of this discovery. However, Alfred D. Remington learned that a Swede, Carl Daniel Ekman, was teaching papermakers in Sweden to make paper entirely out of wood pulp by using a sulphite process (SO3). Remington went to Sweden to see [...] "This Miracle" [...] for himself. He was so impressed that he imported Swedish <b>chemical</b> <b>fiber</b> for several years and later developed the [...] "sulphite process" [...] in his own plant on Sewall's Island. The Remingtons were selling newsprint to the New York Times. They received an order for ten tons stipulating that the newsprint contain no wood pulp! A. D. Remington, proud of his new product, sent it to the Times along with a note, asking them to try it. The reply was, [...] "come and get your paper", which he did. It wasn't long before the Times was eager and willing to buy this new and cheaper newsprint. The revolution in paper-making in the Black River region was complete: fourdrinier machines became bigger and bigger and faster and faster; the demand for spruce was insatiable and the lumbermen practically denuded the virgin forests; the unpleasant odor of the sulphite mills replaced the equally unpleasant odor of the tanneries. Other paper-makers, emulating the success of the Remingtons embarked on a costly program of mass-production of wood pulp newsprint.|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} convert the textile fibers in yarns, these must be {{subjected}} to twisting operation which confers them a certain tensile strength. Twisting also results in certain effects, such as crepe effect. The importance of knowing the twisting behavior consists in the possibility to avoid fiber degradation {{as the result of}} an excessive twisting. The present work took for study three types of <b>chemical</b> <b>fibers</b> (wool-type rayon, wool-type polyester, wool-type polyacrylonitrile) and two types of wool fibers S 11 and S 12. The main characteristics of wool type <b>chemical</b> <b>fibers</b> (fiber count, nominal length, breaking length, relative elongation, brightness) and of wool fibers (diameter, almeter length, uster irregularit) have been measured. Then the fibers were subjected to thermal treatments in certain conditions. From the researches performed for the both wool blends, S 11 and S 21, one can notice that the torsional rigidity/stiffness increases after the thermal treatment and the wool fibers changes their handle accordingly. The rayon fibers present the biggest torsional rigidity, as compared to the other types of analyzed fibers, both untreated and heat treated. After heat treatment, the rayon fibers considerable improves their handle. The variation coefficient of breaking torsion increases in the case of heat treated polyester and poly-acrylonitrile fibers while for rayon and wool fibers this coefficient decreases. ...|$|R

40|$|China is {{currently}} experiencing {{rapid economic growth}} {{as a result of}} industrialization and urbanization. In the next 20 years, China's energy demand will increase substantially, and energy conservation will become imperative for the country's low carbon economic transformation. Since 1998, China's <b>chemical</b> <b>fiber</b> production has ranked first in the world. In 2011, China's <b>chemical</b> <b>fiber</b> production accounted for about 70 % of the world's total output. Therefore, energy saving is important for China's <b>chemical</b> <b>fiber</b> industry, and can provide immense benefits, and hence the need for thorough and intense research. In this paper, the co-integration method is used to test the relationship between energy consumption and its influencing factors such as GDP, energy prices, population and R&D expenditures. The results show that there is a long-term relationship between the variables. Based on this, we estimate energy demand and predict the energy-saving potential for the industry under different scenarios. We apply the Monte Carlo simulation method to verify the reliability of the prediction. Scenario analysis is adopted to predict energy demand and energy saving in the industry under different scenarios. Finally, we propose some policy suggestions on energy saving based on the research. ? 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E
