5|$|In 1935, Stebbins {{was offered}} a {{genetics}} research position at the University of California, Berkeley working with geneticist E. B. Babcock. Babcock needed assistance with a large Rockefeller-funded project characterizing the genetics and evolutionary processes of plants from the genus <b>Crepis</b> and was interested in developing <b>Crepis</b> into a model plant, to enable genetic investigations similar to those possible in the model insect Drosophila melanogaster. Like the genera that Stebbins had previously studied, <b>Crepis</b> commonly hybridized, displayed polyploidy (chromosome doubling), and could make seed without fertilization (a process known as apomixis). The collaboration between Babcock and Stebbins produced numerous papers and two monographs. The first monograph, published in 1937, resulted in splitting off the Asiatic <b>Crepis</b> species into the genus Youngia. The second, published in 1938, was titled The American Species of Crepis: their interrelationships and distribution as affected by polyploidy and apomixis.|$|E
5|$|In The American Species of <b>Crepis,</b> Babcock and Stebbins {{described}} {{the concept of}} the polyploid complex, and its role in plant evolution. Some genera, such as <b>Crepis,</b> have a complex of reproductive forms that center on sexually diploid populations that have also given rise to polyploid ones. Babcock and Stebbins also observed that allopolyploid types formed from the hybridization of two different species always have a wider distribution than diploid or autotetraploid species, and proposed that polyploids formed through hybridization have a greater potential to exploit varied environments, because they inherit all traits from both parents. They also showed that hybridization in the polyploid complex could provide a mechanism for genetic exchange between diploid species that were otherwise unable to breed. Their observations offered insight into species formation and knowledge of how all these complex processes could provide information on the history of a genus. This monograph was described by Swedish botanist Åke Gustafsson as the most important work on the formation of species during that period.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Crepis,</b> {{commonly}} known {{in some parts}} of the world as hawksbeard or hawk's-beard (but not to be confused with the related genus Hieracium with a similar common name), is a genus of annual and perennial flowering plants of the family Asteraceae superficially resembling the dandelion, the most conspicuous difference being that <b>Crepis</b> usually has branching scapes with multiple heads (though solitary heads can occur). The genus name <b>Crepis</b> derives from the Greek krepis, meaning [...] "slipper" [...] or [...] "sandal", possibly in reference to the shape of the fruit.|$|E
