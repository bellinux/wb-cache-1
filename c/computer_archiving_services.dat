40|$|Cyberinfrastructure is {{proposed}} by the US/NSF as the new century’s infrastructure for scientific research and discovery, aiming to provide cyberenvironments to enable scientific applications onto cyberresources, e. g. high performance <b>computers,</b> data <b>archives,</b> software <b>service,</b> distributed communities, telescopes and observatories. This work is focused on cyberinfrastructure applications with data streaming requirements. Since volumes of data streams are usually extremely high but available bandwidth and storage are often very limit, a data streaming environment to support cyberinfrastructure applications is implemented in this work with supports of on-demand data transfers and just-in-time data cleanups. The implementation includes performance sensors, predictors and a scheduler, with real-time measurements, prediction and scheduling capabilities. The GridFTP is utilized and data transfer schedules are performed using the on-the-fly adjustable GridFTP parallelism. Experimental {{results show that the}} data streaming environment can scale well regarding storage usage and adapt to dynamically changing application data processing requirements especially with constraints of limit storage and bandwidth. 1...|$|R

The {{purpose of this}} paper is to review how the role of the local authority <b>archive</b> <b>service</b> in the UK has developed, and the implications of the requirement for public sector bodies to demonstrate value in relation to concepts such as social capital, for the way in which services are promoted, evaluated and delivered. Design/methodology/approach ? A range of literature (1919 - 2006) is synthesized to provide a perspective on <b>archive</b> <b>service</b> development, theories of social capital and public value, and {{government policy}}, as a means of identifying the implications of current government agendas for <b>archive</b> <b>service</b> delivery. The findings are presented in sections addressing: the context of <b>archive</b> <b>service</b> provision; social capital and government policy; the role of the <b>archive</b> <b>service</b> in meeting government agendas; and the need for services to demonstrate public value. Findings ? Provides information about the context of <b>archive</b> <b>service</b> provision, and how services have responded to government agendas within an operational environment which has seen a renewed emphasis on the archive domain within government policy and in terms of structural development since 1997. Considers the applicability of thinking on social capital and public value to service provision. Recognises the implications of the low profile of the archive domain to the capacity of services to demonstrate public value in these terms. Research limitations/implications ? Commentary focuses on the local authority context of <b>archive</b> <b>service</b> provision, within England and Wales. Originality/value ? Brings together information from different sources in making explicit the need for <b>archive</b> <b>services,</b> as with libraries and museums, to respond to government priorities.
