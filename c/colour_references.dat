50|$|Skin-contact wine, amber wine, {{or orange}} wine {{is a type}} of wine made from white wine grapes where the grape skins are not removed, and stay in contact with the juice for days or even months. This {{contrasts}} with conventional white wine production, which involves crushing the grapes and quickly moving the juice off the skins into the fermentation vessel. The skins contain color pigment, phenols and tannins that would normally be considered undesirable for white wines, while for red wines skin contact and maceration is {{a vital part of the}} winemaking process that gives red wine its color, flavor, and texture. This style of wines can also be known by their <b>colour</b> <b>references</b> of having an amber or orange tinge that the base white wine receives due to its contact with the coloring pigments of the grape skins.|$|E
40|$|The Cast Courts {{were created}} between 1870 - 73 and {{designed}} by Major General Scott. An {{account of the}} time records briefly the colours used and other details. There had been no previous research of these significant and unique historic spaces. Crick Smith undertook the investigation during 2010 - 2011. The processes involved uncovering of physical evidence on site, the microscopic examination of removed paint cross-sections and the appraisal of archival evidence and historic photographs. The research was necessary to endorse {{the accuracy of the}} contemporary account and to define the exact locations, applications and treatments of colour. Following microscopic analysis areas of original stencil work and plain wall face colours were revealed and colour correction undertaken. Numerical <b>colour</b> <b>references</b> by calibrated spectrophotometer were provided with colour matched samples of the original finishes. The research identified the nature, detail and condition of the overpainted original ornate schemes within the Cast Court Galleries. This information was crucial in providing the client team with firm evidence needed to make decisions on suitable decorative schemes for the refurbished gallery spaces. This included assessments on whether elements of the original decoration could be exposed, conserved or replicated in part to complement necessary new work. As Crick Smith reports are written for a range of clients, information is deliberately presented in a style that is easily accessible, technical terms are fully explained to enable understanding by a non-specialist reader, as it is understood that not all members of the client team may be experienced in understanding this type of investigation...|$|E
40|$|Vector is a {{group of}} four un-identical vessels, with common {{features}} placed on a shared platform. Similarities in shape, size, method of construction and decorative detail serve to identify the vessels as a set. Three are made in silver and a fourth (a rogue, opposite or negative object) is made in darkened non-precious metal. The visual appearance of the vessels relates to the processes used to develop the design. The starting point, a digital, technical drawing of a conical form of pre-determined size and shape was developed to produce a paper pattern, which was subsequently used to generate sketch models in card. Many models were made, considered, adjusted and re-made until a suitable group emerged. The final set exploits the qualities of the initial line drawings as decorative detail, which is echoed in the linear detail seen {{on the surface of the}} platform on which the objects sit. The platform <b>colour</b> <b>references</b> paper and the technical drawing roots of the piece. Lines engraved on the surface of the platform are filled with pencil lead filings, a further allusion to drawing as well as indication as to where the objects should be placed. Vector seeks to capture the connection between the maker's mind’s eye image, the design process and methods of sheet metalwork construction.   Vector was exhibited as part of Silver Speaks: ‘Form’, an exhibition of work by members of Contemporary British Silversmiths, which ran from 1 st June – 23 rd September 2016 at the Goldsmiths’ Centre. The exhibition provided an insight into the processes behind the making of objects and what is used to create them. It showcased 33 works alongside the makers’ tools, original samples and drawings. The silversmiths selected were those whose designs successfully interpreted one of the exhibition’s themes, as well as exhibiting excellence in design and craftsmanship...|$|E

40|$|Hitherto, {{methods for}} visual {{assessment}} of colour appearance {{have not been}} developed {{for use in the}} study of rooms. We seek a practical method that allows one or two observers to characterize a room by identifying the perceived colours. Verbal descriptions are necessary, but lack precision. A magnitude estimation method may enable a more precise location in colour space. However, the need of a group of well-trained observers makes it impractical for room studies. A method involving matches between <b>reference</b> <b>colour</b> samples and the perceived room colours would be ideal. But, <b>reference</b> <b>colour</b> samples require a standard illumination; otherwise, the sample changes colour due to different room light. Hence, a method involving a <b>colour</b> <b>reference</b> box was developed. The <b>colour</b> <b>reference</b> box with its standard source of illumination provides a <b>reference</b> situation, where <b>colour</b> samples can be visually compared with the colours of the room. The study presented is an evaluation of this <b>colour</b> <b>reference</b> box. The crucial problem is that the same color sample in the box is perceived differently, as the observer adapts to various lighting conditions. The aim {{of the study was to}} investigate if these different perceptions of the samples could be described and controlled. In the study, 18 observers were asked to visually assess the hue of 15 – 66 samples, and mark its place in the NCS hue circle. The assessment of the samples was made in two different room lights: incandescent light and simulated daylight. The result of the study showed a clear tendency for the samples, perceived in the box, to shift colour in simulated daylight compared to incandescent light. It was concluded that the problem with the observer's adaptation to the room light can be described and controlled, although complementary studies are needed to quantify the adaptation effect with more accuracy, and to investigate differences in nuance. Thus, it seems that the <b>colour</b> <b>reference</b> box can be used to visually evaluate and describe the differences in colour appearance in different rooms. © 2000 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

40|$|Abstract- We {{present a}} fast and {{efficient}} method to derive and apply natural colours to nighttime imagery from multiband sensors. The colour mapping {{is derived from}} the combination of a multiband image and a corresponding daytime <b>colour</b> <b>reference.</b> The mapping optimizes the match between the multiband image and the reference, and yields a nightvision image with colours similar to the daytime image. The mapping procedure is simple and fast. Once it has been derived the colour mapping can be deployed in realtime. Different colour schemes can be used tailored to the environment and the application. The expectation is that by displaying nighttime imagery in natural colours human observers will be able to interpret the imagery better and faster, thereby improving situational awareness and reducing detection times...|$|R

50|$|In {{practice}} {{however, the}} recovery of this colour information from telerecordings is highly complex for several reasons. Firstly, the <b>colour</b> <b>reference</b> timing signal, known as the colour burst, is absent from telerecordings, as it is nominally {{off the edge of}} the visible screen area being recorded. This timing has to effectively be recovered since the phase of the chroma dots, which is represented by their horizontal position on the screen, determines the hue of the reconstructed colours. Distortions in the geometry of the telerecordings due to the nature of physically recording from a non-flat CRT screen onto film means that a transformation has to be applied in order to infer the original positions of the chroma dots within the broadcast.|$|R

25|$|Apart {{from the}} common and {{scientific}} names of many species, {{it is for the}} quality of his illustrations that he is best remembered. His friend William Elford Leach, head of zoology at the British Museum, encouraged him to experiment with lithography for his book Zoological Illustrations (1820–23). Swainson became the first illustrator and naturalist to use lithography, which was a relatively cheap means of reproduction and did not require an engraver. He began publishing many illustrated works, mostly serially. Subscribers received and paid for fascicles, small sections of the books, as they came out, so that the cash flow was constant and could be reinvested in the preparation of subsequent parts. As book orders arrived, the monochrome lithographs were hand-coloured, according to <b>colour</b> <b>reference</b> images, known as ‘pattern plates’, which were produced by Swainson himself. It was his early adoption of this new technology and his natural skill of illustration that in large part led to his fame.|$|R

40|$|The main {{problems}} {{dealt with}} in this thesis are (1) how colours can appear in rooms due to various colour combinations and lighting conditions, and (2) how we can identify and compare colour appearance in rooms. One aim is to demonstrate and discuss the complex problem of how certain conditions in a room affect colour appearance, and to give examples and describe the co-operation between some of the affecting factors in experimental rooms. Another aim is to develop and evaluate methods for studying colours in rooms, methods that give us reliable visual identifications of perceived colour and allow comparisons between different rooms. Through an architectural perspective, tailored methods and specially developed concepts, the thesis presents a way to conceptualise and treat the complex subject of colour in enclosed spaces. The thesis work includes a literature survey and empirical studies. Most of the latter were made in experimental rooms in full and small scale, which were based on studies of actual interiors and preliminary model room studies. The literature survey mapped out the knowledge field, and the empirical studies worked out methods, tools and concepts {{for the study of}} colour appearance in rooms. Preliminary attempts are made to describe the elasticity in colour appearance of certain inherent colours under varying conditions in rooms. The phenomenon of reflections has been systematically studied, and discussed in relation to simultaneous contrast. The developed concepts of identity colour and colour variations have proved to be helpful tools for analysing colour appearance. The Visual Evaluation method of Liljefors and Ejhed was adjusted to involve visual assessments of the perceived <b>colours.</b> The <b>colour</b> <b>reference</b> box developed during the project is taken to solve a serious methodological problem, especially for comparisons between equally painted, but differently illuminated, rooms. The difficult problem of the adaptation effect was specially dealt with - that is, the colour sample in the <b>colour</b> <b>reference</b> box is perceived differently as the observer adapts to various lighting conditions. While complementary studies are needed, it was concluded that the adaptation effect for the hue is possible to map out and control...|$|R
