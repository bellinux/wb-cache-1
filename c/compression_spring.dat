25|$|For {{very large}} heat sinks, {{there is no}} {{substitute}} for the threaded standoff and <b>compression</b> <b>spring</b> attachment method. A threaded standoff is essentially a hollow metal tube with internal threads. One end is secured with a screw through a hole in the PCB. The other end accepts a screw which compresses the spring, completing the assembly. A typical heat sink assembly uses two to four standoffs, which tends to make this the most costly heat sink attachment design. Another disadvantage is the need for holes in the PCB.|$|E
2500|$|For larger {{heat sinks}} and higher preloads, push pins with {{compression}} springs are very effective. The push pins, typically made of brass or plastic, have a flexible barb {{at the end}} that engages {{with a hole in}} the PCB; once installed, the barb retains the pin. The <b>compression</b> <b>spring</b> holds the assembly together and maintains contact between the heat sink and component. [...] Care is needed in selection of push pin size. [...] Too great an insertion force can result in the die cracking and consequent component failure.|$|E

50|$|<b>Compression</b> garter <b>springs</b> are {{a type of}} {{coiled spring}} that exerts outward radial forces away from the center. They are {{typically}} {{made up of a}} thick steel wire with large coils; <b>compression</b> <b>springs</b> {{need to be able to}} handle very large loads while being able to return to their natural extended position. <b>Compression</b> <b>springs</b> store potential energy when they are compressed (length of spring decreases), and exert kinetic energy when released. <b>Compression</b> garter <b>springs</b> use this principle to withstand forces acting on it from outside. They may be placed inside a circular object to maintain the object's circular shape. This is similar to squeezing a rubber ball; the ball will contract when squeezed but will return to its natural state once the external pressure is released.|$|R

Proposed is a method for determining the maximum dynamic loads in the glove machine carriages’ drive. It is noted that the dynamic loads reduction {{can be achieved by}} equipping the drive with energy accumulation and compensation units, in which quality it is expedient to use the cylindrical <b>compression</b> <b>springs.</b> The obtained dependence allows to determine the necessary stiffness of <b>compression</b> <b>springs</b> (energy accumulating and compensating units), at which the dynamic loads due to the carriages masses’ inertia can be almost completely eliminated...|$|R
5000|$|As {{shown in}} the {{disassembly}} photo, the switch actuator pivots in two holes in {{the sides of the}} plastic switch body. An actuator bar slides in two grooves inside the actuator, pressed down by a <b>compression</b> <b>spring</b> into a notch in the common contact bar. The common contact bar is free to rock on a small diameter rod, welded to the common terminal. However, because of the pressure applied by the <b>compression</b> <b>spring,</b> the common contact bar will always be held against one of the two contacts.|$|E
50|$|When the {{actuator}} is moved, {{mechanical energy}} {{is stored in}} the <b>compression</b> <b>spring</b> until the actuator passes its mid-position. At that time, the common contact bar is forced {{in the opposite direction}} by the <b>compression</b> <b>spring,</b> acting via the actuator bar, thus breaking the connection with the existing contact and making connection with the other contact. The common contact bar is made of copper, with an inlay of harder contact metal on the underside. While it is free to move the required distance lengthwise, it is constrained from moving sideways by the construction of the molded plastic body.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{dissertation}} is to explore the effect of cryogenic treatment on the fatigue life of <b>compression</b> <b>springs.</b> Product manufacturers are constantly searching for ways to make their products last longer. This dissertation addresses three questions: (1) What {{is the effect of}} cryogenic treatment on the fatigue life of chrome silicon steel <b>compression</b> <b>springs?</b> Does the life increase, decrease, or remain the same? (2) What is the effect of cryogenic treatment on the Percent Load Loss (Stress Relaxation) of chrome silicon steel <b>compression</b> <b>springs?</b> (3) What are the possible changes in the material that cause these effects? The following tests were carried out; wire tensile test, hardness test, chemical analysis, residual stress, retained austenite, lattice parameter, force vs. deflection, percent load loss (stress relaxation), fatigue, microstructures, and eta carbides. This research produced a number of key findings: (1) The cryogenically treated springs had a longer cycle life and a higher endurance limit than the untreated springs. (2) The percent load loss (stress relaxation) of the cryogenically treated springs was similar to the untreated springs. (3) The cryogenically treated springs had a higher compressive residual stress at the surface than the untreated springs. The conclusions of this research are that the cryogenic treatment of chrome silicon steel <b>compression</b> <b>springs</b> led to an increase in compressive residual stress on the wire surface, which in turn led to an increase in fatigue life and a higher endurance limit. A recommended future study would be to compare cryogenically treated springs to shot peened springs...|$|R
50|$|Spring boards {{were added}} to the market in 2013 with the release of Strongboard Balance, which holds a patent on the multi-spring design. The board’s fulcrum {{consists}} of 4 individual <b>compression</b> <b>springs</b> situated between the base and the platform. Once a user stands on the board, the springs compress. The user’s body then searches for stabilization, but because of the force applied to the springs from the user’s body weight, the board will not stabilize. By redistributing weight across the board, the rider can move the board in any direction - engaging core stabilizing muscles. The four <b>compression</b> <b>springs</b> provide additional support for a variety of exercises, target the core, and improve balance, core strength, agility, and posture.|$|R
40|$|The {{current work}} {{presents}} a statically balanced system with novel design, which incorporates <b>compression</b> <b>springs</b> {{as a positive}} stiffness and magnets as a negative stiffness. The mechanism varies the force in the positive stiffness elements from zero to maximum. In this way, the balancing system {{can be used as}} a force amplifier. The goal of the current design is to be used in a friction brake. A specific magnet configuration is used to achieve a relatively linear force-distance relationship. The configuration consist of three block-magnets, from which one magnet translates and two magnets are placed in a stationary steel U-shape. This force-distance relationship is balanced by a piecewise linear characteristic achieved by using multiple <b>compression</b> <b>springs</b> with different action-initiation points. The proof-of-concept build consists of a lever mechanism with a lever arm of 100 mm, one set of magnets and three <b>compression</b> <b>springs.</b> By varying the position of the lever from to 5. 04, the force in the springs is varied between 0 N and 872 N. Experimental evaluation of the prototype reveals a minimum of 97 % force reduction in the prototype compared to the unbalanced prototype.

50|$|A {{volute spring}} is a <b>compression</b> <b>spring</b> {{in the form}} of a cone (a volute).

50|$|Clothespins {{were further}} {{enhanced}} by the invention of stainless steel clothespins that do not rust or decay with outdoor use. Rather than using a torsion spring that often twists, causing the clothespin to fall apart, they rely on a strong, trapped, <b>compression</b> <b>spring</b> that results in a stronger grip.|$|E

50|$|Shot peening is {{a crucial}} process in spring making. Types of springs include leaf springs, {{extension}} <b>springs,</b> and <b>compression</b> <b>springs.</b> The most widely used application are for engine valve <b>springs</b> (<b>compression</b> <b>springs)</b> due to high cyclic fatigue. In an OEM valve spring application, the mechanical design combined with some shot peening ensures longevity. Automotive makers are shifting to more high performance higher stressed valve spring designs as engines evolve. In aftermarket high performance valve spring applications, the need for controlled and multi-step shot peening is a requirement to withstand extreme surface stresses that sometimes exceeds material specifications. The fatigue life of an extreme performance spring (NHRA, IHRA) can be as short as two passes on a 1/4 mile drag racing track before relaxation or failure occurs.|$|R

5000|$|RFV {{is often}} {{explained}} by modelling the tire {{as being a}} ring composed of short <b>compression</b> <b>springs.</b> As the tire turns a spring element makes contact with the road and is compressed.

50|$|A {{volute spring}} is a <b>{{compression}}</b> <b>spring</b> {{in the form}} of a cone (a volute). Under compression the coils slide over each other, affording longer travel.

50|$|The PMN-2 fuze {{features}} an arming delay of approximately 60 seconds. When the arming key is rotated and {{removed from the}} mine, the arming pin is sheared. This allows the air-bellows inside the mine to be inflated by the <b>compression</b> <b>spring,</b> which in turn lifts a “safety” bar from {{the path of the}} slide, unblocking its travel. The arming delay on a PMN-2 is significantly shorter than that of a PMN-1.|$|E
