[...] So Law appears imperfet, and but giv'n [...] With purpose to resign them in full time [...] 300 [...] Up to a better Cov'nant, disciplin'd [...] From shadowie Types to Truth, from Flesh to Spirit, [...] From imposition of strict Laws, to free [...] Acceptance of large Grace, from servil fear [...] To filial, works of Law to works of Faith. [...] And therefore shall not Moses, though of God [...] Highly belov'd, being but the Minister [...] Of Law, his people into Canaan lead; [...] But Joshua whom the Gentiles Jesus call, [...] His Name and Office bearing, who shall quell [...] 310 [...] The adversarie Serpent, and bring back [...] Through the worlds wilderness long wanderd man [...] Safe to eternal Paradise of rest. [...] Meanwhile they in thir earthly Canaan plac't [...] Long time shall dwell and prosper, but when sins [...] National interrupt thir public peace, [...] Provoking God to raise them enemies: [...] From whom as oft he saves them penitent [...] By Judges first, then under Kings; of whom [...] The second, both for pietie renownd [...] 320 [...] And puissant deeds, a promise shall receive [...] Irrevocable, that his Regal Throne [...] For ever shall endure; the like shall sing [...] All Prophecie, That of the Royal Stock [...] Of David (so I name this King) shall rise [...] A Son, the Womans Seed to thee foretold, [...] Foretold to Abraham, as in whom shall trust [...] All Nations, and to Kings foretold, of Kings [...] The last, for of his Reign shall be no end.

[...] 400 [...] The Law of God exact he shall fulfill [...] Both by obedience and by love, though love [...] Alone fulfill the Law; thy punishment [...] He shall endure by coming in the Flesh [...] To a reproachful life and cursed death, [...] Proclaiming Life to all who shall believe [...] In his redemption, and that his obedience [...] Imputed becomes theirs by Faith, his merits [...] To save them, not thir own, though legal works. [...] For this he shall live hated, be blasphem'd, [...] 410 [...] Seis'd on by force, judg'd, and to death condemnd [...] A shameful and accurst, naild to the Cross [...] By his own Nation, slaine for bringing Life; [...] But to the Cross he nailes thy Enemies, [...] The Law that is against thee, and the sins [...] Of all mankinde, with him there crucifi'd, [...] Never to hurt them more who rightly trust [...] In this his satisfaction; so he dies, [...] But soon revives, Death over him no power [...] Shall long usurp; ere the third dawning light [...] 420 [...] Returne, the Starres of Morn shall see him rise [...] Out of his grave, fresh as the dawning light, [...] Thy ransom paid, which Man from death redeems, [...] His death for Man, as many as offerd Life [...] Neglect not, and the benefit imbrace [...] By Faith not void of works: this God-like act [...] Annuls thy doom, the death thou shouldst have dy'd, [...] In sin for ever lost from life; this act [...] Shall bruise the head of Satan, crush his strength [...] Defeating Sin and Death, his two maine armes, [...] 430 [...] And fix farr deeper in his head thir stings [...] Then temporal death shall bruise the Victors heel, [...] Or theirs whom he redeems, a death like sleep, [...] A gentle wafting to immortal Life. [...] Nor after resurrection shall he stay [...] Longer on Earth then certaine times to appeer [...] To his Disciples, Men {{who in his}} Life [...] Still follow'd him; to them shall leave in charge [...] To teach all nations what of him they learn'd [...] And his Salvation, them who shall beleeve [...] 440 [...] Baptizing in the profluent streame, the signe [...] Of washing them from guilt of sin to Life [...] Pure, and in mind prepar'd, if so befall, [...] For death, like that which the redeemer dy'd.

[...] Then to the Heav'n of Heav'ns he shall ascend [...] 450 [...] With victory, triumphing through the aire [...] Over his foes and thine; there shall surprise [...] The Serpent, Prince of aire, and drag in Chaines [...] Through all his realme, & there confounded leave; [...] Then enter into glory, and resume [...] His Seat at Gods right hand, exalted high [...] Above all names in Heav'n; and thence shall come, [...] When this worlds dissolution shall be ripe, [...] With glory and power to judge both quick & dead, [...] To judge th' unfaithful dead, but to reward [...] 460 [...] His faithful, and receave them into bliss, [...] Whether in Heav'n or Earth, for then the Earth [...] Shall all be Paradise, far happier place [...] Then this of Eden, and far happier daies. [...] So spake th' Archangel Michael, then paus'd, [...] As at the Worlds great period; and our Sire [...] Replete with joy and wonder thus repli'd. [...] O goodness infinite, goodness immense! [...] That all this good of evil shall produce, [...] And evil turn to good; more wonderful [...] 470 [...] Then that which by creation first brought forth [...] Light out of darkness! full of doubt I stand, [...] Whether I should repent me now of sin [...] By mee done and occasiond, or rejoyce [...] Much more, that much more good thereof shall spring, [...] To God more glory, more good will to Men [...] From God, and over wrauth grace shall abound. [...] But say, if our deliverer up to Heav'n [...] Must reascend, what will betide the few [...] His faithful, left among th' unfaithful herd, [...] 480 [...] The enemies of truth; who then shall guide [...] His people, who defend? will they not deale [...] Wors with his followers then with him they dealt? [...] Be sure they will, said th' Angel; but from Heav'n [...] Hee to his own a Comforter will send, [...] The promise of the Father, who shall dwell [...] His Spirit within them, and the Law of Faith [...] Working through love, upon thir hearts shall write, [...] To guide them in all truth, and also arme [...] With spiritual Armour, able to resist [...] 490 [...] Satans assaults, and quench his fierie darts [...] What Man can do against them, not affraid, [...] Though to the death, against such cruelties [...] With inward consolations recompenc't, [...] And oft supported so as shall amaze [...] Thir proudest persecuters: for the Spirit [...] Powrd first on his Apostles, whom he sends [...] To evangelize the Nations, then on all [...] Baptiz'd, shall them with wondrous gifts endue [...] To speak all Tongues, and do all Miracles, [...] 500 [...] As did thir Lord before them. Thus they win [...] Great numbers of each Nation to receave [...] With joy the tidings brought from Heav'n: at length [...] Thir Ministry perform'd, and race well run, [...] Thir doctrine and thir story written left, [...] They die; but in thir room, as they forewarne, [...] Wolves shall succeed for teachers, grievous Wolves, [...] Who all the sacred mysteries of Heav'n [...] To thir own vile advantages shall turne [...] Of lucre and ambition, and the truth [...] 510 [...] With superstitions and traditions taint, [...] Left onely in those written Records pure, [...] Though not but by the Spirit understood. [...] Then shall they seek to avail themselves of names, [...] Places and titles, and with these to joine [...] Secular power, though feigning still to act [...] By spiritual, to themselves appropriating [...] The Spirit of God, promisd alike and giv'n [...] To all Beleevers; and from that pretense, [...] Spiritual Lawes by carnal power shall force [...] 520 [...] On every conscience; Laws which none shall finde [...] Left them inrould, or what the Spirit within [...] Shall on the heart engrave. What will they then [...] But force the Spirit of Grace it self, and binde [...] His consort Libertie; what, but unbuild [...] His living Temples, built by Faith to stand, [...] Thir own Faith not anothers: for on Earth [...] Who against Faith and Conscience can be heard [...] Infallible? yet many will presume: [...] Whence heavie persecution shall arise [...] 530 [...] On all who in the worship persevere [...] Of Spirit and Truth; the rest, farr greater part, [...] Will deem in outward Rites and specious formes [...] Religion satisfi'd; Truth shall retire [...] Bestuck with slandrous darts, and works of Faith [...] Rarely be found: so shall the World goe on, [...] To good malignant, to bad men benigne, [...] Under her own waight groaning, till the day [...] Appeer of respiration to the just, [...] And vengeance to the wicked, at return [...] 540 [...] Of him so lately promis'd to thy aid, [...] The Womans seed, obscurely then foretold, [...] Now amplier known thy Saviour and thy Lord, [...] Last in the Clouds from Heav'n to be reveald [...] In glory of the Father, to dissolve [...] Satan with his perverted World, then raise [...] From the conflagrant mass, purg'd and refin'd, [...] New Heav'ns, new Earth, Ages of endless date [...] Founded in righteousness and peace and love, [...] To bring forth fruits Joy and eternal Bliss.

[...] To whom thus also th' Angel last repli'd: [...] This having learnt, thou hast attaind the summe [...] Of wisdom; hope no higher, though all the Starrs [...] Thou knewst by name, and all th' ethereal Powers, [...] All secrets of the deep, all Natures works, [...] Or works of God in Heav'n, Air, Earth, or Sea, [...] And all the riches of this World enjoydst, [...] And all the rule, one Empire; onely add [...] 580 [...] Deeds to thy knowledge answerable, add Faith, [...] Add Vertue, Patience, Temperance, add Love, [...] By name to come call'd Charitie, the soul [...] Of all the rest: then wilt thou not be loath [...] To leave this Paradise, but shalt possess [...] A Paradise within thee, happier farr. [...] Let us descend now therefore from this top [...] Of Speculation; for the hour precise [...] Exacts our parting hence; and see the Guards, [...] By mee encampt on yonder Hill, expect [...] 590 [...] Thir motion, at whose Front a flaming Sword, [...] In signal of remove, waves fiercely round; [...] We may no longer stay: go, waken Eve; [...] Her also I with gentle Dreams have calm'd [...] Portending good, and all her spirits compos'd [...] To meek submission: thou at season fit [...] Let her with thee partake what thou hast heard, [...] Chiefly what may concern her Faith to know, [...] The great deliverance by her Seed to come [...] (For by the Womans Seed) on all Mankind. [...] 600 [...] That ye may live, which will be many dayes, [...] Both in one Faith unanimous though sad, [...] With cause for evils past, yet much more cheer'd [...] With meditation on the happie end. [...] He ended, and they both descend the Hill; [...] Descended, Adam to the Bowre where Eve [...] Lay sleeping ran before, but found her wak't; [...] And thus with words not sad she him receav'd. [...] Whence thou returnst, & whither wentst, I know; [...] For God is also in sleep, and Dreams advise, [...] 610 [...] Which he hath sent propitious, some great good [...] Presaging, since with sorrow and hearts distress [...] Wearied I fell asleep: but now lead on; [...] In mee is no delay; with thee to goe, [...] Is to stay here; without thee here to stay, [...] Is to go hence unwilling; thou to mee [...] Art all things under Heav'n, all places thou, [...] Who for my wilful crime art banisht hence. [...] This further consolation yet secure [...] I carry hence; though all by mee is lost, [...] 620 [...] Such favour I unworthie am voutsaft, [...] By mee the Promis'd Seed shall all restore. [...] So spake our Mother Eve, and Adam heard [...] Well pleas'd, but answer'd not; for now too nigh [...] Th' Archangel stood, and from the other Hill [...] To thir fixt Station, all in bright array [...] The Cherubim descended; on the ground [...] Gliding meteorous, as Ev'ning Mist [...] Ris'n from a River o're the marish glides, [...] And gathers ground fast at the Labourers heel [...] 630 [...] Homeward returning. High in Front advanc't, [...] The brandisht Sword of God before them blaz'd [...] Fierce as a Comet; which with torrid heat, [...] And vapour as the Libyan Air adust, [...] Began to parch that temperate Clime; whereat [...] In either hand the hastning Angel caught [...] Our lingring Parents, and to th' Eastern Gate [...] Let them direct, and down the Cliff as fast [...] To the subjected Plaine; then disappeer'd. [...] They looking back, all th' Eastern side beheld [...] 640 [...] Of Paradise, so late thir happie seat, [...] Wav'd over by that flaming Brand, the Gate [...] With dreadful Faces throng'd and fierie Armes: [...] Som natural tears they drop'd, but wip'd them soon; [...] The World was all before them, where to choose [...] Thir place of rest, and Providence thir guide: [...] They hand in hand with wandring steps and slow, [...] Through Eden took thir solitarie way.|$|E

[THE Angel ended, and in Adams Eare [...] So Charming {{left his}} voice, that he a while [...] Thought him still speaking, still stood fixt to hear; [...] Then as new wak't thus gratefully repli'd.] [...] What thanks sufficient, or what recompence [...] Equal have I to render thee, Divine [...] Hystorian, who thus largely hast allayd [...] The thirst I had of knowledge, and voutsaf't [...] This {{friendly}} condescention to relate [...] Things else by me unsearchable, now heard [...] 10 [...] With wonder, but delight, and, as is due, [...] With glorie {{attributed to the}} high [...] Creator; some thing yet of doubt remaines, [...] Which onely thy solution can resolve. [...] When I behold this goodly Frame, this World [...] Of Heav'n and Earth consisting, and compute, [...] Thir magnitudes, this Earth a spot, a graine, [...] An Atom, with the Firmament compar'd [...] And all her numberd Starrs, that seem to rowle [...] Spaces incomprehensible (for such [...] 20 [...] Thir distance argues and thir swift return [...] Diurnal) meerly to officiate light [...] Round this opacous Earth, this punctual spot, [...] One day and night; in all thir vast survey [...] Useless besides, reasoning I oft admire, [...] How Nature wise and frugal could commit [...] Such disproportions, with superfluous hand [...] So many nobler Bodies to create, [...] Greater so manifold to this one use, [...] For aught appeers, and on thir Orbs impose [...] 30 [...] Such restless revolution day by day [...] Repeated, while the sedentarie Earth, [...] That better might with farr less compass move, [...] Serv'd by more noble then her self, attaines [...] Her end without least motion, and receaves, [...] As Tribute such a sumless journey brought [...] Of incorporeal speed, her warmth and light; [...] Speed, to describe whose swiftness Number failes. [...] So spake our Sire, and by his count'nance seemd [...] Entring on studious thoughts abstruse, which Eve [...] 40 [...] Perceaving where she sat retir'd in sight, [...] With lowliness Majestic from her seat, [...] And Grace that won who saw to wish her stay, [...] Rose, and went forth among her Fruits and Flours, [...] To visit how they prosper'd, bud and bloom, [...] Her Nurserie; they at her coming sprung [...] And toucht by her fair tendance gladlier grew. [...] Yet went she not, as not with such discourse [...] Delighted, or not capable her eare [...] Of what was high: such pleasure she reserv'd, [...] 50 [...] Adam relating, she sole Auditress; [...] Her Husband the Relater she preferr'd [...] Before the Angel, and of him to ask [...] Chose rather; hee, she knew would intermix [...] Grateful digressions, and solve high dispute [...] With conjugal Caresses, from his Lip [...] Not Words alone pleas'd her. O when meet now [...] Such pairs, in Love and mutual Honour joyn'd? [...] With Goddess-like demeanour forth she went; [...] Not unattended, for on her as Queen [...] 60 [...] A pomp of winning Graces waited still, [...] And from about her shot Darts of desire [...] Into all Eyes to wish her still in sight. [...] And Raphael now to Adam's doubt propos'd [...] Benevolent and facil thus repli'd. [...] To ask or search I blame thee not, for Heav'n [...] Is as the Book of God before thee set, [...] Wherein to read his wondrous Works, and learne [...] His Seasons, Hours, or Days, or Months, or Yeares: [...] This to attain, whether Heav'n move or Earth, [...] 70 [...] Imports not, if thou reck'n right, the rest [...] From Man or Angel the great Architect [...] Did wisely to conceal, and not divulge [...] His secrets to be scann'd by them who ought [...] Rather admire; or if they list to try [...] Conjecture, he his Fabric of the Heav'ns [...] Hath left to thir disputes, perhaps to move [...] His laughter at thir quaint Opinions wide [...] Hereafter, {{when they come to}} model Heav'n [...] And calculate the Starrs, how they will weild [...] 80 [...] The mightie frame, how build, unbuild, contrive [...] To save appeerances, how gird the Sphear [...] With Centric and Eccentric scribl'd o're, [...] Cycle and Epicycle, Orb in Orb: [...] Alreadie by thy reasoning this I guess, [...] Who art to lead thy ofspring, and supposest [...] That Bodies bright and greater should not serve [...] The less not bright, nor Heav'n such journies run, [...] Earth sitting still, when she alone receaves [...] The benefit: consider first, that Great [...] 90 [...] Or Bright inferrs not Excellence: the Earth [...] Though, in comparison of Heav'n, so small, [...] Nor glistering, may of solid good containe [...] More plenty then the Sun that barren shines, [...] Whose vertue on it self workes no effect, [...] But in the fruitful Earth; there first receavd [...] His beams, unactive else, thir vigor find. [...] Yet not to Earth are those bright Luminaries [...] Officious, but to thee Earths habitant. [...] And for the Heav'ns wide Circuit, let it speak [...] 100 [...] The Makers high magnificence, who built [...] So spacious, and his Line stretcht out so farr; [...] That Man may know he dwells not in his own; [...] An Edifice too large for him to fill, [...] Lodg'd in a small partition, and the rest [...] Ordain'd for uses to his Lord best known. [...] The swiftness of those Circles attribute, [...] Though numberless, to his Omnipotence, [...] That to corporeal substances could adde [...] Speed almost Spiritual; mee thou thinkst not slow, [...] 110 [...] Who since the Morning hour set out from Heav'n [...] Where God resides, and ere mid-day arriv'd [...] In Eden, distance inexpressible [...] By Numbers that have name. But this I urge, [...] Admitting Motion in the Heav'ns, to shew [...] Invalid that which thee to doubt it mov'd; [...] Not that I so affirm, though so it seem [...] To thee who hast thy dwelling here on Earth. [...] God to remove his wayes from human sense, [...] Plac'd Heav'n from Earth so farr, that earthly sight, [...] 120 [...] If it presume, might erre in things too high, [...] And no advantage gaine. What if the Sun [...] Be Center to the World, and other Starrs [...] By his attractive vertue and thir own [...] Incited, dance about him various rounds? [...] Thir wandring course now high, now low, then hid, [...] Progressive, retrograde, or standing still, [...] In six thou seest, and what if sev'nth to these [...] The Planet Earth, so stedfast though she seem, [...] Insensibly three different Motions move? [...] 130 [...] Which else to several Sphears thou must ascribe, [...] Mov'd contrarie with thwart obliquities, [...] Or save the Sun his labour, and that swift [...] Nocturnal and Diurnal rhomb suppos'd, [...] Invisible else above all Starrs, the Wheele [...] Of Day and Night; which needs not thy beleefe, [...] If Earth industrious of her self fetch Day [...] Travelling East, and with her part averse [...] From the Suns beam meet Night, her other part [...] Still luminous by his ray. What if that light [...] 140 [...] Sent from her through the wide transpicuous aire, [...] To the terrestrial Moon be as a Starr [...] Enlightning her by Day, as she by Night [...] This Earth? reciprocal, if Land be there, [...] Feilds and Inhabitants: Her spots thou seest [...] As Clouds, and Clouds may rain, and Rain produce [...] Fruits in her soft'nd Soile, for some to eate [...] Allotted there; and other Suns perhaps [...] With thir attendant Moons thou wilt descrie [...] Communicating Male and Femal Light, [...] 150 [...] Which two great Sexes animate the World, [...] Stor'd in each Orb perhaps with some that live. [...] For such vast room in Nature unpossest [...] By living Soule, desert and desolate, [...] Onely to shine, yet scarce to contribute [...] Each Orb a glimps of Light, conveyd so farr [...] Down to this habitable, which returnes [...] Light back to them, is obvious to dispute. [...] But whether thus these things, or whether not, [...] Whether the Sun predominant in Heav'n [...] 160 [...] Rise on the Earth, or Earth rise on the Sun, [...] Hee from the East his flaming rode begin, [...] Or Shee from West her silent course advance [...] With inoffensive pace that spinning sleeps [...] On her soft Axle, while she paces Eev'n, [...] And bears thee soft with the smooth Air along, [...] Sollicit not thy thoughts with matters hid, [...] Leave them to God above, him serve and feare; [...] Of other Creatures, as him pleases best, [...] Wherever plac't, let him dispose: joy thou [...] 170 [...] In what he gives to thee, this Paradise [...] And thy faire Eve; Heav'n is for thee too high [...] To know what passes there; be lowlie wise: [...] Think onely what concernes thee and thy being; [...] Dream not of other Worlds, what Creatures there [...] Live, in what state, condition or degree, [...] Contented that thus farr hath been reveal'd [...] Not of Earth onely but of highest Heav'n. [...] To whom thus Adam cleerd of doubt, repli'd. [...] How fully hast thou satisfi'd mee, pure [...] 180 [...] Intelligence of Heav'n, Angel serene, [...] And freed from intricacies, taught to live, [...] The easiest way, nor with perplexing thoughts [...] To interrupt the sweet of Life, from which [...] God hath bid dwell farr off all anxious cares, [...] And not molest us, unless we our selves [...] Seek them with wandring thoughts, and notions vaine. [...] But apt the Mind or Fancie is to roave [...] Uncheckt, and of her roaving is no end; [...] Till warn'd, or by experience taught, she learne, [...] 190 [...] That not to know at large of things remote [...] From use, obscure and suttle, but to know [...] That which before us lies in daily life, [...] Is the prime Wisdom, what is more, is fume, [...] Or emptiness, or fond impertinence, [...] And renders us in things that most <b>concerne</b> [...] Unpractis'd, unprepar'd, and still to seek. [...] Therefore from this high pitch let us descend [...] A lower flight, and speak of things at hand [...] Useful, whence haply mention may arise [...] 200 [...] Of somthing not unseasonable to ask [...] By sufferance, and thy wonted favour deign'd. [...] Thee I have heard relating what was don [...] Ere my remembrance: now hear mee relate [...] My Storie, which perhaps thou hast not heard; [...] And Day is yet not spent; till then thou seest [...] How suttly to detaine thee I devise, [...] Inviting thee to hear while I relate, [...] Fond, were it not in hope of thy reply: [...] For while I sit with thee, I seem in Heav'n, [...] 210 [...] And sweeter thy discourse is to my eare [...] Then Fruits of Palm-tree pleasantest to thirst [...] And hunger both, from labour, at the houre [...] Of sweet repast; they satiate, and soon fill, [...] Though pleasant, but thy words with Grace Divine [...] Imbu'd, bring to thir sweetness no satietie. [...] To whom thus Raphael answer'd heav'nly meek. [...] Nor are thy lips ungraceful, Sire of men, [...] Nor tongue ineloquent; for God on thee [...] Abundantly his gifts hath also pour'd, [...] 220 [...] Inward and outward both, his image faire: [...] Speaking or mute all comliness and grace [...] Attends thee, and each word, each motion formes. [...] Nor less think wee in Heav'n of thee on Earth [...] Then of our fellow servant, and inquire [...] Gladly into the wayes of God with Man: [...] For God we see hath honour'd thee, and set [...] On Man his equal Love: say therefore on; [...] For I that Day was absent, as befell, [...] Bound on a voyage uncouth and obscure, [...] 230 [...] Farr on excursion toward the Gates of Hell; [...] Squar'd in full Legion (such command we had) [...] To see that none thence issu'd forth a spie, [...] Or enemie, while God was in his work, [...] Least hee incenst at such eruption bold, [...] Destruction with Creation might have mixt. [...] Not that they durst without his leave attempt, [...] But us he sends upon his high behests [...] For state, as Sovran King, and to enure [...] Our prompt obedience. Fast we found, fast shut [...] 240 [...] The dismal Gates, and barricado'd strong; [...] But long ere our approaching heard within [...] Noise, other then the sound of Dance or Song, [...] Torment, and lowd lament, and furious rage. [...] Glad we return'd up to the coasts of Light [...] Ere Sabbath Eev'ning: so we had in charge. [...] But thy relation now; for I attend, [...] Pleas'd with thy words no less then thou with mine. [...] So spake the Godlike Power, and thus our Sire. [...] For Man to tell how human Life began [...] 250 [...] Is hard; for who himself beginning knew? [...] Desire with thee still longer to converse [...] Induc'd me. As new wak't from soundest sleep [...] Soft on the flourie herb I found me laid [...] In Balmie Sweat, which with his Beames the Sun [...] Soon dri'd, and on the reaking moisture fed. [...] Strait toward Heav'n my wondring Eyes I turnd, [...] And gaz'd a while the ample Skie, till rais'd [...] By quick instinctive motion up I sprung, [...] As thitherward endevoring, and upright [...] 260 [...] Stood on my feet; about me round I saw [...] Hill, Dale, and shadie Woods, and sunnie Plaines, [...] And liquid Lapse of murmuring Streams; by these, [...] Creatures that livd, and movd, and walk'd, or flew, [...] Birds on the branches warbling; all things smil'd, [...] With fragrance and with joy my heart oreflow'd. [...] My self I then perus'd, and Limb by Limb [...] Survey'd, and sometimes went, and sometimes ran [...] With supple joints, as lively vigour led: [...] But who I was, or where, or from what cause, [...] 270 [...] Knew not; to speak I tri'd, and forthwith spake, [...] My Tongue obey'd and readily could name [...] What e're I saw. Thou Sun, said I, faire Light, [...] And thou enlight'nd Earth, so fresh and gay, [...] Ye Hills and Dales, ye Rivers, Woods, and Plaines, [...] And ye that live and move, fair Creatures, tell, [...] Tell, if ye saw, how came I thus, how here? [...] Not of my self; by some great Maker then, [...] In goodness and in power praeeminent; [...] Tell me, how may I know him, how adore, [...] 280 [...] From whom I have that thus I move and live, [...] And feel that I am happier then I know. [...] While thus I call'd, and stray'd I knew not whither, [...] From where I first drew Aire, and first beheld [...] This happie Light, when answer none return'd, [...] On a green shadie Bank profuse of Flours [...] Pensive I sate me down; there gentle sleep [...] First found me, and with soft oppression seis'd [...] My droused sense, untroubl'd, though I thought [...] I then was passing to my former state [...] 290 [...] Insensible, and forthwith to dissolve: [...] When suddenly stood at my Head a dream, [...] Whose inward apparition gently mov'd [...] My Fancy to believe I yet had being, [...] And livd: One came, methought, of shape Divine, [...] And said, thy Mansion wants thee, Adam, rise, [...] First Man, of Men innumerable ordain'd [...] First Father, call'd by thee I come thy Guide [...] To the Garden of bliss, thy seat prepar'd. [...] So saying, by the hand he took me rais'd, [...] 300 [...] And over Fields and Waters, as in Aire [...] Smooth sliding without step, last led me up [...] A woodie Mountain; whose high top was plaine, [...] A Circuit wide, enclos'd, with goodliest Trees [...] Planted, with Walks, and Bowers, that what I saw [...] Of Earth before scarse pleasant seemd. Each Tree [...] Load'n with fairest Fruit, that hung to the Eye [...] Tempting, stirr'd in me sudden appetite [...] To pluck and eate; whereat I wak'd, and found [...] Before mine Eyes all real, as the dream [...] 310 [...] Had lively shadowd: Here had new begun [...] My wandring, had not hee who was my Guide [...] Up hither, from among the Trees appeer'd, [...] Presence Divine. Rejoycing, but with aw [...] In adoration at his feet I fell [...] Submiss: he rear'd me, & Whom thou soughtst I am, [...] Said mildely, Author of all this thou seest [...] Above, or round about thee or beneath. [...] This Paradise I give thee, count it thine [...] To Till and keep, and of the Fruit to eate: [...] 320 [...] Of every Tree that in the Garden growes [...] Eate freely with glad heart; fear here no dearth: [...] But of the Tree whose operation brings [...] Knowledg of good and ill, which I have set [...] The Pledge of thy Obedience and thy Faith, [...] Amid the Garden by the Tree of Life, [...] Remember what I warne thee, shun to taste, [...] And shun the bitter consequence: for know, [...] The day thou eat'st thereof, my sole command [...] Transgrest, inevitably thou shalt dye; [...] 330 [...] From that day mortal, and this happie State [...] Shalt loose, expell'd from hence into a World [...] Of woe and sorrow. Sternly he pronounc'd [...] The rigid interdiction, which resounds [...] Yet dreadful in mine eare, though in my choice [...] Not to incur; but soon his cleer aspect [...] Return'd and gratious purpose thus renew'd. [...] Not onely these fair bounds, but all the Earth [...] To thee and to thy Race I give; as Lords [...] Possess it, and all things that therein live, [...] 340 [...] Or live in Sea, or Aire, Beast, Fish, and Fowle. [...] In signe whereof each Bird and Beast behold [...] After thir kindes; I bring them to receave [...] From thee thir Names, and pay thee fealtie [...] With low subjection; understand the same [...] Of Fish within thir watry residence, [...] Not hither summond, since they cannot change [...] Thir Element to draw the thinner Aire. [...] As thus he spake, each Bird and Beast behold [...] Approaching two and two, These cowring low [...] 350 [...] With blandishment, each Bird stoop'd on his wing. [...] I nam'd them, as they pass'd, and understood [...] Thir Nature, with such knowledg God endu'd [...] My sudden apprehension: but in these [...] I found not what me thought I wanted still; [...] And to the Heav'nly vision thus presum'd. [...] O by what Name, for thou above all these, [...] Above mankinde, or aught then mankinde higher, [...] Surpassest farr my naming, how may I [...] Adore thee, Author of this Universe, [...] 360 [...] And all this good to man, for whose well being [...] So amply, and with hands so liberal [...] Thou hast provided all things: but with mee [...] I see not who partakes. In solitude [...] What happiness, who can enjoy alone, [...] Or all enjoying, what contentment find? [...] Thus I presumptuous; and the vision bright, [...] As with a smile more bright'nd, thus repli'd. [...] What call'st thou solitude, is not the Earth [...] With various living creatures, and the Aire [...] 370 [...] Replenisht, and all these at thy command [...] To come and play before thee, know'st thou not [...] Thir language and thir wayes, they also know, [...] And reason not contemptibly; with these [...] Find pastime, and beare rule; thy Realm is large. [...] So spake the Universal Lord, and seem'd [...] So ordering. I with leave of speech implor'd, [...] And humble deprecation thus repli'd. [...] Let not my words offend thee, Heav'nly Power, [...] My Maker, be propitious while I speak. [...] 380 [...] Hast thou not made me here thy substitute, [...] And these inferiour farr beneath me set? [...] Among unequals what societie [...] Can sort, what harmonie or true delight? [...] Which must be mutual, in proportion due [...] Giv'n and receiv'd; but in disparitie [...] The one intense, the other still remiss [...] Cannot well suite with either, but soon prove [...] Tedious alike: Of fellowship I speak [...] Such as I seek, fit to participate [...] 390 [...] All rational delight, wherein the brute [...] Cannot be human consort; they rejoyce [...] Each with thir kinde, Lion with Lioness; [...] So fitly them in pairs thou hast combin'd; [...] Much less can Bird with Beast, or Fish with Fowle [...] So well converse, nor with the Ox the Ape; [...] Wors then can Man with Beast, and least of all. [...] Whereto th' Almighty answer'd, not displeas'd. [...] A nice and suttle happiness I see [...] Thou to thy self proposest, in the choice [...] 400 [...] Of thy Associates, Adam, and wilt taste [...] No pleasure, though in pleasure, solitarie. [...] What thinkst thou then of mee, and this my State, [...] Seem I to thee sufficiently possest [...] Of happiness, or not? who am alone [...] From all Eternitie, for none I know [...] Second to mee or like, equal much less. [...] How have I then with whom to hold converse [...] Save with the Creatures which I made, and those [...] To me inferiour, infinite descents [...] 410 [...] Beneath what other Creatures are to thee? [...] He ceas'd, I lowly answer'd. To attaine [...] The highth and depth of thy Eternal wayes [...] All human thoughts come short, Supream of things; [...] Thou in thy self art perfet, and in thee [...] Is no deficience found; not so is Man, [...] But in degree, the cause of his desire [...] By conversation with his like to help, [...] Or solace his defects. No need that thou [...] Shouldst propagat, already infinite; [...] 420 [...] And through all numbers absolute, though One; [...] But Man by number is to manifest [...] His single imperfection, and beget [...] Like of his like, his Image multipli'd, [...] In unitie defective, which requires [...] Collateral love, and deerest amitie. [...] Thou in thy secresie although alone, [...] Best with thy self accompanied, seek'st not [...] Social communication, yet so pleas'd, [...] Canst raise thy Creature to what highth thou wilt [...] 430 [...] Of Union or Communion, deifi'd; [...] I by conversing cannot these erect [...] From prone, nor in thir wayes complacence find. [...] Thus I embold'nd spake, and freedom us'd [...] Permissive, and acceptance found, which gain'd [...] This answer from the gratious voice Divine. [...] Thus farr to try thee, Adam, I was pleas'd, [...] And finde thee knowing not of Beasts alone, [...] Which thou hast rightly nam'd, but of thy self, [...] Expressing well the spirit within thee free, [...] 440 [...] My Image, not imparted to the Brute, [...] Whose fellowship therefore unmeet for thee [...] Good reason was thou freely shouldst dislike, [...] And be so minded still; I, ere thou spak'st, [...] Knew it not good for Man to be alone, [...] And no such companie as then thou saw'st [...] Intended thee, for trial onely brought, [...] To see how thou could'st judge of fit and meet: [...] What next I bring shall please thee, be assur'd, [...] Thy likeness, thy fit help, thy other self, [...] 450 [...] Thy wish, exactly to thy hearts desire. [...] Hee ended, or I heard no more, for now [...] My earthly by his Heav'nly overpowerd, [...] Which it had long stood under, streind to the highth [...] In that celestial Colloquie sublime, [...] As with an object that excels the sense, [...] Dazl'd and spent, sunk down, and sought repair [...] Of sleep, which instantly fell on me, call'd [...] By Nature as in aide, and clos'd mine eyes. [...] Mine eyes he clos'd, but op'n left the Cell [...] 460 [...] Of Fancie my internal sight, by which [...] Abstract as in a transe methought I saw, [...] Though sleeping, where I lay, and saw the shape [...] Still glorious before whom awake I stood; [...] Who stooping op'nd my left side, and took [...] From thence a Rib, with cordial spirits warme, [...] And Life-blood streaming fresh; wide was the wound, [...] But suddenly with flesh fill'd up & heal'd: [...] The Rib he formd and fashond with his hands; [...] Under his forming hands a Creature grew, [...] 470 [...] Manlike, but different sex, so lovly faire, [...] That what seemd fair in all the World, seemd now [...] Mean, or in her summd up, in her containd [...] And in her looks, which from that time infus'd [...] Sweetness into my heart, unfelt before, [...] And into all things from her Aire inspir'd [...] The spirit of love and amorous delight. [...] She disappeerd, and left me dark, I wak'd [...] To find her, or for ever to deplore [...] Her loss, and other pleasures all abjure: [...] 480 [...] When out of hope, behold her, not farr off, [...] Such as I saw her in my dream, adornd [...] With what all Earth or Heaven could bestow [...] To make her amiable: On she came, [...] Led by her Heav'nly Maker, though unseen, [...] And guided by his voice, nor uninformd [...] Of nuptial Sanctitie and marriage Rites: [...] Grace was in all her steps, Heav'n in her Eye, [...] In every gesture dignitie and love. [...] I overjoyd could not forbear aloud. [...] 490 [...] This turn hath made amends; thou hast fulfill'd [...] Thy words, Creator bounteous and benigne, [...] Giver of all things faire, but fairest this [...] Of all thy gifts, nor enviest. I now see [...] Bone of my Bone, Flesh of my Flesh, my Self [...] Before me; Woman is her Name, of Man [...] Extracted; for this cause he shall forgoe [...] Father and Mother, and to his Wife adhere; [...] And they shall be one Flesh, one Heart, one Soule. [...] She heard me thus, and though divinely brought, [...] 500 [...] Yet Innocence and Virgin Modestie, [...] Her vertue and the conscience of her worth, [...] That would be woo'd, and not unsought be won, [...] Not obvious, not obtrusive, but retir'd, [...] The more desirable, or to say all, [...] Nature her self, though pure of sinful thought, [...] Wrought in her so, that seeing me, she turn'd; [...] I follow'd her, she what was Honour knew, [...] And with obsequious Majestie approv'd [...] My pleaded reason. To the Nuptial Bowre [...] 510 [...] I led her blushing like the Morn: all Heav'n, [...] And happie Constellations on that houre [...] Shed thir selectest influence; the Earth [...] Gave sign of gratulation, and each Hill; [...] Joyous the Birds; fresh Gales and gentle Aires [...] Whisper'd it to the Woods, and from thir wings [...] Flung Rose, flung Odours from the spicie Shrub, [...] Disporting, till the amorous Bird of Night [...] Sung Spousal, and bid haste the Eevning Starr [...] On his Hill top, to light the bridal Lamp. [...] 520 [...] Thus I have told thee all my State, and brought [...] My Storie to the sum of earthly bliss [...] Which I enjoy, and must confess to find [...] In all things else delight indeed, but such [...] As us'd or not, works in the mind no change, [...] Nor vehement desire, these delicacies [...] I mean of Taste, Sight, Smell, Herbs, Fruits, & Flours, [...] Walks, and the melodie of Birds; but here [...] Farr otherwise, transported I behold, [...] Transported touch; here passion first I felt, [...] 530 [...] Commotion strange, in all enjoyments else [...] Superiour and unmov'd, here onely weake [...] Against the charm of Beauties powerful glance. [...] Or Nature faild in mee, and left some part [...] Not proof enough such Object to sustain, [...] Or from my side subducting, took perhaps [...] More then enough; at least on her bestow'd [...] Too much of Ornament, in outward shew [...] Elaborate, of inward less exact. [...] For well I understand in the prime end [...] 540 [...] Of Nature her th' inferiour, in the mind [...] And inward Faculties, which most excell, [...] In outward also her resembling less [...] His Image who made both, and less expressing [...] The character of that Dominion giv'n [...] O're other Creatures; yet when I approach [...] Her loveliness, so absolute she seems [...] And in her self compleat, so well to know [...] Her own, that what she wills to do or say, [...] Seems wisest, vertuousest, discreetest, best; [...] 550 [...] All higher knowledge in her presence falls [...] Degraded, Wisdom in discourse with her [...] Looses discount'nanc't, and like folly shewes; [...] Authoritie and Reason on her waite, [...] As one intended first, not after made [...] Occasionally; and to consummate all, [...] Greatness of mind and nobleness thir seat [...] Build in her loveliest, and create an awe [...] About her, as a guard Angelic plac't. [...] To whom the Angel with contracted brow. [...] 560 [...] Accuse not Nature, she hath don her part; [...] Do thou but thine, and be not diffident [...] Of Wisdom, she deserts thee not, if thou [...] Dismiss not her, when most thou needst her nigh, [...] By attributing overmuch to things [...] Less excellent, as thou thy self perceav'st. [...] For what admir'st thou, what transports thee so, [...] An outside? fair no doubt, and worthy well [...] Thy cherishing, thy honouring, and thy love, [...] Not thy subjection: weigh with her thy self; [...] 570 [...] Then value: Oft times nothing profits more [...] Then self-esteem, grounded on just and right [...] Well manag'd; of that skill the more thou know'st, [...] The more she will acknowledge thee her Head, [...] And to realities yeild all her shows; [...] Made so adorn for thy delight the more, [...] So awful, that with honour thou maist love [...] Thy mate, who sees when thou art seen least wise. [...] But if the sense of touch whereby mankind [...] Is propagated seem such dear delight [...] 580 [...] Beyond all other, think the same voutsaf't [...] To Cattel and each Beast; which would not be [...] To them made common & divulg'd, if aught [...] Therein enjoy'd were worthy to subdue [...] The Soule of Man, or passion in him move. [...] What higher in her societie thou findst [...] Attractive, human, rational, love still; [...] In loving thou dost well, in passion not, [...] Wherein true Love consists not; love refines [...] The thoughts, and heart enlarges, hath his seat [...] 590 [...] In Reason, and is judicious, is the scale [...] By which to heav'nly Love thou maist ascend, [...] Not sunk in carnal pleasure, for which cause [...] Among the Beasts no Mate for thee was found. [...] To whom thus half abash't Adam repli'd. [...] Neither her out-side formd so fair, nor aught [...] In procreation common to all kindes [...] (Though higher of the genial Bed by far, [...] And with mysterious reverence I deem) [...] So much delights me, as those graceful acts, [...] 600 [...] Those thousand decencies that daily flow [...] From all her words and actions, mixt with Love [...] And sweet compliance, which declare unfeign'd [...] Union of Mind, or in us both one Soule; [...] Harmonie to behold in wedded pair [...] More grateful then harmonious sound to the eare. [...] Yet these subject not; I to thee disclose [...] What inward thence I feel, not therefore foild, [...] Who meet with various objects, from the sense [...] Variously representing; yet still free [...] 610 [...] Approve the best, and follow what I approve. [...] To love thou blam'st me not, for love thou saist [...] Leads up to Heav'n, is both the way and guide; [...] Bear with me then, if lawful what I ask; [...] Love not the heav'nly Spirits, and how thir Love [...] Express they, by looks onely, or do they mix [...] Irradiance, virtual or immediate touch? [...] To whom the Angel with a smile that glow'd [...] Celestial rosie red, Loves proper hue, [...] Answer'd. Let it suffice thee that thou know'st [...] 620 [...] Us happie, and without Love no happiness. [...] Whatever pure thou in the body enjoy'st [...] (And pure thou wert created) we enjoy [...] In eminence, and obstacle find none [...] Of membrane, joynt, or limb, exclusive barrs: [...] Easier then Air with Air, if Spirits embrace, [...] Total they mix, Union of Pure with Pure [...] Desiring; nor restrain'd conveyance need [...] As Flesh to mix with Flesh, or Soul with Soul. [...] But I can now no more; the parting Sun [...] 630 [...] Beyond the Earths green Cape and verdant Isles [...] Hesperean sets, my Signal to depart. [...] Be strong, live happie, and love, but first of all [...] Him whom to love is to obey, and keep [...] His great command; take heed least Passion sway [...] Thy Judgement to do aught, which else free Will [...] Would not admit; thine and of all thy Sons [...] The weal or woe in thee is plac't; beware. [...] I in thy persevering shall rejoyce, [...] And all the Blest: stand fast; to stand or fall [...] 640 [...] Free in thine own Arbitrement it lies. [...] Perfet within, no outward aid require; [...] And all temptation to transgress repel. [...] So saying, he arose; whom Adam thus [...] Follow'd with benediction. Since to part, [...] Go heavenly Guest, Ethereal Messenger, [...] Sent from whose sovran goodness I adore. [...] Gentle to me and affable hath been [...] Thy condescension, and shall be honour'd ever [...] With grateful Memorie: thou to mankind [...] 650 [...] Be good and friendly still, and oft return.

[...] To whom thus Eve with sad demeanour meek. [...] Ill worthie I such title should belong [...] To me transgressour, who for thee ordaind [...] A help, became thy snare; to mee reproach [...] Rather belongs, distrust and all dispraise: [...] But infinite in pardon was my Judge, [...] That I who first brought Death on all, am grac't [...] The sourse of life; next favourable thou, [...] Who highly thus to entitle me voutsaf't, [...] 170 [...] Farr other name deserving. But the Field [...] To labour calls us now with sweat impos'd, [...] Though after sleepless Night; for see the Morn, [...] All unconcern'd with our unrest, begins [...] Her rosie progress smiling; let us forth, [...] I never from thy side henceforth to stray, [...] Wherere our days work lies, though now enjoind [...] Laborious, till day droop; while here we dwell, [...] What can be toilsom in these pleasant Walkes? [...] Here let us live, though in fall'n state, content. [...] 180 [...] So spake, so wish'd much-humbl'd Eve, but Fate [...] Subscrib'd not; Nature first gave Signs, imprest [...] On Bird, Beast, Aire, Aire suddenly eclips'd [...] After short blush of Morn; nigh in her sight [...] The Bird of Jove, stoopt from his aerie tour, [...] Two Birds of gayest plume before him drove: [...] Down from a Hill the Beast that reigns in Woods, [...] First Hunter then, pursu'd a gentle brace, [...] Goodliest of all the Forrest, Hart and Hinde; [...] Direct to th' Eastern Gate was bent thir flight. [...] 190 [...] Adam observ'd, and with his Eye the chase [...] Pursuing, not unmov'd to Eve thus spake. [...] O Eve, some furder change awaits us nigh, [...] Which Heav'n by these mute signs in Nature shews [...] Forerunners of his purpose, or to warn [...] Us haply too secure of our discharge [...] From penaltie, because from death releast [...] Some days; how long, and what till then our life, [...] Who knows, or more then this, that we are dust, [...] And thither must return and be no more. [...] 200 [...] Why else this double object in our sight [...] Of flight pursu'd in th' Air and ore the ground [...] One way the self-same hour? why in the East [...] Darkness ere Dayes mid-course, and Morning light [...] More orient in yon Western Cloud that draws [...] O're the blew Firmament a radiant white, [...] And slow descends, with somthing heav'nly fraught. [...] He err'd not, for by this the heav'nly Bands [...] Down from a Skie of Jasper lighted now [...] In Paradise, and on a Hill made alt, [...] 210 [...] A glorious Apparition, had not doubt [...] And carnal fear that day dimm'd Adams eye. [...] Not that more glorious, when the Angels met [...] Jacob in Mahanaim, where he saw [...] The field Pavilion'd with his Guardians bright; [...] Nor that which on the flaming Mount appeerd [...] In Dothan, cover'd with a Camp of Fire, [...] Against the Syrian King, who to surprize [...] One man, Assassin-like had levied Warr, [...] Warr unproclam'd. The Princely Hierarch [...] 220 [...] In thir bright stand, there left his Powers to seise [...] Possession of the Garden; hee alone, [...] To finde where Adam shelterd, took his way, [...] Not unperceav'd of Adam, who to Eve, [...] While the great Visitant approachd, thus spake. [...] Eve, now expect great tidings, which perhaps [...] Of us will soon determin, or impose [...] New Laws to be observ'd; for I descrie [...] From yonder blazing Cloud that veils the Hill [...] One of the heav'nly Host, and by his Gate [...] 230 [...] None of the meanest, some great Potentate [...] Or of the Thrones above, such Majestie [...] Invests him coming; yet not terrible, [...] That I should fear, nor sociably mild, [...] As Raphael, that I should much confide, [...] But solemn and sublime, whom not to offend, [...] With reverence I must meet, and thou retire. [...] He ended; and th' Arch-Angel soon drew nigh, [...] Not in his shape Celestial, but as Man [...] Clad to meet Man; over his lucid Armes [...] 240 [...] A militarie Vest of purple flowd [...] Livelier then Meliboean, or the graine [...] Of Sarra, worn by Kings and Hero's old [...] In time of Truce; Iris had dipt the wooff; [...] His starrie Helme unbuckl'd shew'd him prime [...] In Manhood where Youth ended; by his side [...] As in a glistering Zodiac hung the Sword, [...] Satans dire dread, and in his hand the Spear. [...] Adam bowd low, hee Kingly from his State [...] Inclin'd not, but his coming thus declar'd. [...] 250 [...] Adam, Heav'ns high behest no Preface needs: [...] Sufficient that thy Prayers are heard, and Death, [...] Then due by sentence when thou didst transgress, [...] Defeated of his seisure many dayes [...] Giv'n thee of Grace, wherein thou may'st repent, [...] And one bad act with many deeds well done [...] Mayst cover: well may then thy Lord appeas'd [...] Redeem thee quite from Deaths rapacious claimes; [...] But longer in this Paradise to dwell [...] Permits not; to remove thee I am come, [...] 260 [...] And send thee from the Garden forth to till [...] The ground whence thou wast tak'n, fitter Soile. [...] He added not, for Adam at the newes [...] Heart-strook with chilling gripe of sorrow stood, [...] That all his senses bound; Eve, who unseen [...] Yet all had heard, with audible lament [...] Discover'd soon the place of her retire. [...] O unexpected stroke, worse then of Death! [...] Must I thus leave thee Paradise? thus leave [...] Thee Native Soile, these happie Walks and Shades, [...] 270 [...] Fit haunt of Gods? where I had hope to spend, [...] Quiet though sad, the respit of that day [...] That must be mortal to us both. O flours, [...] That never will in other Climate grow, [...] My early visitation, and my last [...] At Eev'n, which I bred up with tender hand [...] From the first op'ning bud, and gave ye Names, [...] Who now shall reare ye to the Sun, or ranke [...] Your Tribes, and water from th' ambrosial Fount? [...] Thee lastly nuptial Bowre, by mee adornd [...] 280 [...] With what to sight or smell was sweet; from thee [...] How shall I part, and whither wander down [...] Into a lower World, to this obscure [...] And wilde, how shall we breath in other Aire [...] Less pure, accustomd to immortal Fruits? [...] Whom thus the Angel interrupted milde. [...] Lament not Eve, but patiently resigne [...] What justly thou hast lost; nor set thy heart, [...] Thus over fond, on that which is not thine; [...] Thy going is not lonely, with thee goes [...] 290 [...] Thy Husband, him to follow thou art bound; [...] Where he abides, think there thy native soile. [...] Adam by this from the cold sudden damp [...] Recovering, and his scatterd spirits returnd, [...] To Michael thus his humble words addressd. [...] Celestial, whether among the Thrones, or nam'd [...] Of them the Highest, for such of shape may seem [...] Prince above Princes, gently hast thou tould [...] Thy message, which might else in telling wound, [...] And in performing end us; what besides [...] 300 [...] Of sorrow and dejection and despair [...] Our frailtie can sustain, thy tidings bring, [...] Departure from this happy place, our sweet [...] Recess, and onely consolation left [...] Familiar to our eyes, all places else [...] Inhospitable appeer and desolate, [...] Nor knowing us nor known: and if by prayer [...] Incessant I could hope to change the will [...] Of him who all things can, I would not cease [...] To wearie him with my assiduous cries: [...] 310 [...] But prayer against his absolute Decree [...] No more availes then breath against the winde, [...] Blown stifling back on him that breaths it forth: [...] Therefore to his great bidding I submit. [...] This most afflicts me, that departing hence, [...] As from his face I shall be hid, deprivd [...] His blessed count'nance; here I could frequent, [...] With worship, place by place where he voutsaf'd [...] Presence Divine, and to my Sons relate; [...] On this Mount he appeerd, under this Tree [...] 320 [...] Stood visible, among these Pines his voice [...] I heard, here with him at this Fountain talk'd: [...] So many grateful Altars I would reare [...] Of grassie Terfe, and pile up every Stone [...] Of lustre from the brook, in memorie, [...] Or monument to Ages, and thereon [...] Offer sweet smelling Gumms & Fruits and Flours: [...] In yonder nether World where shall I seek [...] His bright appearances, or footstep trace? [...] For though I fled him angrie, yet recall'd [...] 330 [...] To life prolongd and promisd Race, I now [...] Gladly behold though but his utmost skirts [...] Of glory, and farr off his steps adore. [...] To whom thus Michael with regard benigne. [...] Adam, thou know'st Heav'n his, and all the Earth [...] Not this Rock onely; his Omnipresence fills [...] Land, Sea, and Aire, and every kinde that lives, [...] Fomented by his virtual power and warmd: [...] All th' Earth he gave thee to possess and rule, [...] No despicable gift; surmise not then [...] 340 [...] His presence to these narrow bounds confin'd [...] Of Paradise or Eden: this had been [...] Perhaps thy Capital Seate, from whence had spred [...] All generations, and had hither come [...] From all the ends of th' Earth, to celebrate [...] And reverence thee thir great Progenitor. [...] But this praeeminence thou hast lost, brought down [...] To dwell on eeven ground now with thy Sons: [...] Yet doubt not but in Vallie and in Plaine [...] God is as here, and will be found alike [...] 350 [...] Present, and of his presence many a signe [...] Still following thee, still compassing thee round [...] With goodness and paternal Love, his Face [...] Express, and of his steps the track Divine. [...] Which that thou mayst beleeve, and be confirmd, [...] Ere thou from hence depart, know I am sent [...] To shew thee what shall come in future dayes [...] To thee and to thy Ofspring; good with bad [...] Expect to hear, supernal Grace contending [...] With sinfulness of Men; thereby to learn [...] 360 [...] True patience, and to temper joy with fear [...] And pious sorrow, equally enur'd [...] By moderation either state to beare, [...] Prosperous or adverse: so shalt thou lead [...] Safest thy life, and best prepar'd endure [...] Thy mortal passage when it comes. Ascend [...] This Hill; let Eve (for I have drencht her eyes) [...] Here sleep below while thou to foresight wak'st, [...] As once thou slepst, while Shee to life was formd. [...] To whom thus Adam gratefully repli'd. [...] 370 [...] Ascend, I follow thee, safe Guide, the path [...] Thou lead'st me, and to the hand of Heav'n submit, [...] However chast'ning, to the evil turne [...] My obvious breast, arming to overcom [...] By suffering, and earne rest from labour won, [...] If so I may attain. So both ascend [...] In the Visions of God: It was a Hill [...] Of Paradise the highest, from whose top [...] The Hemisphere of Earth in cleerest Ken [...] Stretcht out to amplest reach of prospect lay. [...] 380 [...] Not higher that Hill nor wider looking round, [...] Whereon for different cause the Tempter set [...] Our second Adam in the Wilderness, [...] To shew him all Earths Kingdomes and thir Glory. [...] His Eye might there command wherever stood [...] City of old or modern Fame, the Seat [...] Of mightiest Empire, from the destind Walls [...] Of Cambalu, seat of Cathaian Can [...] And Samarchand by Oxus, Temirs Throne, [...] To Paquin of Sinaean Kings, and thence [...] 390 [...] To Agra and Lahor of great Mogul [...] Down to the golden Chersonese, or where [...] The Persian in Ecbatan sate, or since [...] In Hispahan, or where the Russian Ksar [...] In Mosco, or the Sultan in Bizance, [...] Turchestan-born; nor could his eye not ken [...] Th' Empire of Negus to his utmost Port [...] Ercoco and the less Maritine Kings [...] Mombaza, and Quiloa, and Melind, [...] And Sofala thought Ophir, to the Realme [...] 400 [...] Of Congo, and Angola fardest South; [...] Or thence from Niger Flood to Atlas Mount [...] The Kingdoms of Almansor, Fez, and Sus, [...] Marocco and Algiers, and Tremisen; [...] On Europe thence, and where Rome was to sway [...] The World: in Spirit perhaps he also saw [...] Rich Mexico the seat of Motezume, [...] And Cusco in Peru, the richer seat [...] Of Atabalipa, and yet unspoil'd [...] Guiana, whose great Citie Geryons Sons [...] 410 [...] Call El Dorado: but to nobler sights [...] Michael from Adams eyes the Filme remov'd [...] Which that false Fruit that promis'd clearer sight [...] Had bred; then purg'd with Euphrasie and Rue [...] The visual Nerve, for he had much to see; [...] And from the Well of Life three drops instill'd. [...] So deep the power of these Ingredients pierc'd, [...] Eevn to the inmost seat of mental sight, [...] That Adam now enforc't to close his eyes, [...] Sunk down and all his Spirits became intranst: [...] 420 [...] But him the gentle Angel by the hand [...] Soon rais'd, and his attention thus recall'd. [...] Adam, now ope thine eyes, and first behold [...] Th' effects which thy original crime hath wrought [...] In some to spring from thee, who never touch'd [...] Th' excepted Tree, nor with the Snake conspir'd, [...] Nor sinn'd thy sin, yet from that sin derive [...] Corruption to bring forth more violent deeds. [...] His eyes he op'nd, and beheld a field, [...] Part arable and tilth, whereon were Sheaves [...] 430 [...] New reapt, the other part sheep-walks and foulds; [...] Ith' midst an Altar as the Land-mark stood [...] Rustic, of grassie sord; thither anon [...] A sweatie Reaper from his Tillage brought [...] First Fruits, the green Eare, and the yellow Sheaf, [...] Uncull'd, as came to hand; a Shepherd next [...] More meek came with the Firstlings of his Flock [...] Choicest and best; then sacrificing, laid [...] The Inwards and thir Fat, with Incense strew'd, [...] On the cleft Wood, and all due Rites perform'd. [...] 440 [...] His Offring soon propitious Fire from Heav'n [...] Consum'd with nimble glance, and grateful steame; [...] The others not, for his was not sincere; [...] Whereat hee inlie rag'd, and as they talk'd, [...] Smote him into the Midriff with a stone [...] That beat out life; he fell, and deadly pale [...] Groand out his Soul with gushing bloud effus'd. [...] Much at that sight was Adam in his heart [...] Dismai'd, and thus in haste to th' Angel cri'd. [...] O Teacher, some great mischief hath befall'n [...] 450 [...] To that meek man, who well had sacrific'd; [...] Is Pietie thus and pure Devotion paid? [...] T' whom Michael thus, hee also mov'd, repli'd. [...] These two are Brethren, Adam, and to come [...] Out of thy loyns; th' unjust the just hath slain, [...] For envie that his Brothers Offering found [...] From Heav'n acceptance; but the bloodie Fact [...] Will be aveng'd, and th' others Faith approv'd [...] Loose no reward, though here thou see him die, [...] Rowling in dust and gore. To which our Sire. [...] 460 [...] Alas, both for the deed and for the cause! [...] But have I now seen Death? Is this the way [...] I must return to native dust? O sight [...] Of terrour, foul and ugly to behold, [...] Horrid to think, how horrible to feel! [...] To whom thus Michael. Death thou hast seen [...] In his first shape on man; but many shapes [...] Of Death, and many are the wayes that lead [...] To his grim Cave, all dismal; yet to sense [...] More terrible at th' entrance then within. [...] 470 [...] Some, as thou saw'st, by violent stroke shall die, [...] By Fire, Flood, Famin, by Intemperance more [...] In Meats and Drinks, which on the Earth shal bring [...] Diseases dire, of which a monstrous crew [...] Before thee shall appear; that thou mayst know [...] What miserie th' inabstinence of Eve [...] Shall bring on men. Immediately a place [...] Before his eyes appeard, sad, noysom, dark, [...] A Lazar-house it seemd, wherein were laid [...] Numbers of all diseas'd, all maladies [...] 480 [...] Of gastly Spasm, or racking torture, qualmes [...] Of heart-sick Agonie, all feavorous kinds, [...] Convulsions, Epilepsies, fierce Catarrhs, [...] Intestin Stone and Ulcer, Colic pangs, [...] Dropsies, and Asthma's, and Joint-racking Rheums. [...] Dire was the tossing, deep the groans, despair [...] Tended the sick busiest from Couch to Couch; [...] And over them triumphant Death his Dart [...] Shook, but delaid to strike, though oft invok't [...] With vows, as thir chief good, and final hope. [...] 490 [...] Sight so deform what heart of Rock could long [...] Drie-ey'd behold? Adam could not, but wept, [...] Though not of Woman born; compassion quell'd [...] His best of Man, and gave him up to tears [...] A space, till firmer thoughts restraind excess, [...] And scarce recovering words his plaint renew'd. [...] O miserable Mankind, to what fall [...] Degraded, to what wretched state reserv'd? [...] Better end heer unborn. Why is life giv'n [...] To be thus wrested from us? rather why [...] 500 [...] Obtruded on us thus? who if we knew [...] What we receive, would either not accept [...] Life offer'd, or soon beg to lay it down, [...] Glad to be so dismist in peace. Can thus [...] Th' Image of God in man created once [...] So goodly and erect, though faultie since, [...] To such unsightly sufferings be debas't [...] Under inhuman pains? Why should not Man, [...] Retaining still Divine similitude [...] In part, from such deformities be free, [...] 510 [...] And for his Makers Image sake exempt? [...] Thir Makers Image, answerd Michael, then [...] Forsook them, when themselves they villifi'd [...] To serve ungovern'd appetite, and took [...] His Image whom they serv'd, a brutish vice, [...] Inductive mainly to the sin of Eve. [...] Therefore so abject is thir punishment, [...] Disfiguring not Gods likeness, but thir own, [...] Or if his likeness, by themselves defac't [...] While they pervert pure Natures healthful rules [...] 520 [...] To loathsom sickness, worthily, since they [...] Gods Image did not reverence in themselves. [...] I yeild it just, said Adam, and submit. [...] But is there yet no other way, besides [...] These painful passages, how we may come [...] To Death, and mix with our connatural dust? [...] There is, said Michael, if thou well observe [...] The rule of not too much, by temperance taught [...] In what thou eatst and drinkst, seeking from thence [...] Due nourishment, not gluttonous delight, [...] 530 [...] Till many years over thy head return: [...] So maist thou live, till like ripe Fruit thou drop [...] Into thy Mothers lap, or be with ease [...] Gatherd, not harshly pluckt, for death mature: [...] This is old age; but then thou must outlive [...] Thy youth, thy strength, thy beauty, which will change [...] To witherd weak & gray; thy Senses then [...] Obtuse, all taste of pleasure must forgoe, [...] To what thou hast, and for the Aire of youth [...] Hopeful and cheerful, in thy blood will reigne [...] 540 [...] A melancholly damp of cold and dry [...] To waigh thy spirits down, and last consume [...] The Balme of Life. To whom our Ancestor. [...] Henceforth I flie not Death, nor would prolong [...] Life much, bent rather how I may be quit [...] Fairest and easiest of this combrous charge, [...] Which I must keep till my appointed day [...] Of rendring up, Michael to him repli'd. [...] Nor love thy Life, nor hate; but what thou livst [...] Live well, how long or short permit to Heav'n: [...] 550 [...] And now prepare thee for another sight. [...] He lookd and saw a spacious Plaine, whereon [...] Were Tents of various hue; by some were herds [...] Of Cattel grazing: others, whence the sound [...] Of Instruments that made melodious chime [...] Was heard, of Harp and Organ; and who moovd [...] Thir stops and chords was seen: his volant touch [...] Instinct through all proportions low and high [...] Fled and pursu'd transverse the resonant fugue. [...] In other part stood one who at the Forge [...] 560 [...] Labouring, two massie clods of Iron and Brass [...] Had melted (whether found where casual fire [...] Had wasted woods on Mountain or in Vale, [...] Down to the veins of Earth, thence gliding hot [...] To som Caves mouth, or whether washt by stream [...] From underground) the liquid Ore he dreind [...] Into fit moulds prepar'd; from which he formd [...] First his own Tooles; then, what might else be wrought [...] Fulfil or grav'n in mettle. After these, [...] But on the hether side a different sort [...] 570 [...] From the high neighbouring Hills, which was thir Seat, [...] Down to the Plain descended: by thir guise [...] Just men they seemd, and all thir study bent [...] To worship God aright, and know his works [...] Not hid, nor those things lost which might preserve [...] Freedom and Peace to men: they on the Plain [...] Long had not walkt, when from the Tents behold [...] A Beavie of fair Women, richly gay [...] In Gems and wanton dress; to the Harp they sung [...] Soft amorous Ditties, and in dance came on: [...] 580 [...] The Men though grave, ey'd them, and let thir eyes [...] Rove without rein, till in the amorous Net [...] Fast caught, they lik'd, and each his liking chose; [...] And now of love they treat till th' Eevning Star [...] Loves Harbinger appeerd; then all in heat [...] They light the Nuptial Torch, and bid invoke [...] Hymen, then first to marriage Rites invok't; [...] With Feast and Musick all the Tents resound. [...] Such happy interview and fair event [...] Of love & youth not lost, Songs, Garlands, Flours, [...] 590 [...] And charming Symphonies attach'd the heart [...] Of Adam, soon enclin'd to admit delight, [...] The bent of Nature; which he thus express'd. [...] True opener of mine eyes, prime Angel blest, [...] Much better seems this Vision, and more hope [...] Of peaceful dayes portends, then those two past; [...] Those were of hate and death, or pain much worse, [...] Here Nature seems fulfilld in all her ends. [...] To whom thus Michael. Judg not what is best [...] By pleasure, though to Nature seeming meet, [...] 600 [...] Created, as thou art, to nobler end [...] Holie and pure, conformitie divine. [...] Those Tents thou sawst so pleasant, were the Tents [...] Of wickedness, wherein shall dwell his Race [...] Who slew his Brother; studious they appere [...] Of Arts that polish Life, Inventers rare, [...] Unmindful of thir Maker, though his Spirit [...] Taught them, but they his gifts acknowledg'd none. [...] Yet they a beauteous ofspring shall beget; [...] For that fair femal Troop thou sawst, that seemd [...] 610 [...] Of Goddesses, so blithe, so smooth, so gay, [...] Yet empty of all good wherein consists [...] Womans domestic honour and chief praise; [...] Bred onely and completed to the taste [...] Of lustful apperence, to sing, to dance, [...] To dress, and troule the Tongue, and roule the Eye. [...] To these that sober Race of Men, whose lives [...] Religious titl'd them the Sons of God, [...] Shall yeild up all thir vertue, all thir fame [...] Ignobly, to the trains and to the smiles [...] 620 [...] Of these fair Atheists, and now swim in joy, [...] (Erelong to swim at larg) and laugh; for which [...] The world erelong a world of tears must weepe. [...] To whom thus Adam of short joy bereft. [...] O pittie and shame, that they who to live well [...] Enterd so faire, should turn aside to tread [...] Paths indirect, or in the mid way faint! [...] But still I see the tenor of Mans woe [...] Holds on the same, from Woman to begin. [...] From Mans effeminate slackness it begins, [...] 630 [...] Said th' Angel, who should better hold his place [...] By wisdome, and superiour gifts receavd. [...] But now prepare thee for another Scene. [...] He lookd and saw wide Territorie spred [...] Before him, Towns, and rural works between, [...] Cities of Men with lofty Gates and Towrs, [...] Concours in Arms, fierce Faces threatning Warr, [...] Giants of mightie Bone, and bould emprise; [...] Part wield thir Arms, part courb the foaming Steed, [...] Single or in Array of Battel rang'd [...] 640 [...] Both Horse and Foot, nor idely mustring stood; [...] One way a Band select from forage drives [...] A herd of Beeves, faire Oxen and faire Kine [...] From a fat Meddow ground; or fleecy Flock, [...] Ewes and thir bleating Lambs over the Plaine, [...] Thir Bootie; scarce with Life the Shepherds flye, [...] But call in aide, which tacks a bloody Fray; [...] With cruel Tournament the Squadrons joine; [...] Where Cattel pastur'd late, now scatterd lies [...] With Carcasses and Arms th' ensanguind Field [...] 650 [...] Deserted: Others to a Citie strong [...] Lay Siege, encampt; by Batterie, Scale, and Mine, [...] Assaulting; others from the Wall defend [...] With Dart and Jav'lin, Stones and sulfurous Fire; [...] On each hand slaughter and gigantic deeds. [...] In other part the scepter'd Haralds call [...] To Council in the Citie Gates: anon [...] Grey-headed men and grave, with Warriours mixt, [...] Assemble, and Harangues are heard, but soon [...] In factious opposition, till at last [...] 660 [...] Of middle Age one rising, eminent [...] In wise deport, spake much of Right and Wrong, [...] Of Justice, of Religion, Truth and Peace, [...] And Judgement from above: him old and young [...] Exploded, and had seiz'd with violent hands, [...] Had not a Cloud descending snatch'd him thence [...] Unseen amid the throng: so violence [...] Proceeded, and Oppression, and Sword-Law [...] Through all the Plain, and refuge none was found. [...] Adam was all in tears, and to his guide [...] 670 [...] Lamenting turnd full sad; O what are these, [...] Deaths Ministers, not Men, who thus deal Death [...] Inhumanly to men, and multiply [...] Ten thousand fould the sin of him who slew [...] His Brother; for of whom such massacher [...] Make they but of thir Brethren, men of men? [...] But who was that Just Man, whom had not Heav'n [...] Rescu'd, had in his Righteousness bin lost? [...] To whom thus Michael; These are the product [...] Of those ill-mated Marriages thou saw'st; [...] 680 [...] Where good with bad were matcht, who of themselves [...] Abhor to joyn; and by imprudence mixt, [...] Produce prodigious Births of bodie or mind. [...] Such were these Giants, men of high renown; [...] For in those dayes Might onely shall be admir'd, [...] And Valour and Heroic Vertu call'd; [...] To overcome in Battel, and subdue [...] Nations, and bring home spoils with infinite [...] Man-slaughter, shall be held the highest pitch [...] Of human Glorie, and for Glorie done [...] 690 [...] Of triumph, to be styl'd great Conquerours, [...] Patrons of Mankind, Gods, and Sons of Gods, [...] Destroyers rightlier call'd and Plagues of men. [...] Thus Fame shall be achiev'd, renown on Earth, [...] And what most merits fame in silence hid. [...] But hee the seventh from thee, whom thou beheldst [...] The onely righteous in a World perverse, [...] And therefore hated, therefore so beset [...] With Foes for daring single to be just, [...] And utter odious Truth, that God would come [...] 700 [...] To judge them with his Saints: Him the most High [...] Rapt in a balmie Cloud with winged Steeds [...] Did, as thou sawst, receave, to walk with God [...] High in Salvation and the Climes of bliss, [...] Exempt from Death; to shew thee what reward [...] Awaits the good, the rest what punishment; [...] Which now direct thine eyes and soon behold. [...] He look'd, & saw the face of things quite chang'd; [...] The brazen Throat of Warr had ceast to roar, [...] All now was turn'd to jollitie and game, [...] 710 [...] To luxurie and riot, feast and dance, [...] Marrying or prostituting, as befell, [...] Rape or Adulterie, where passing faire [...] Allurd them; thence from Cups to civil Broiles. [...] At length a Reverend Sire among them came, [...] And of thir doings great dislike declar'd, [...] And testifi'd against thir wayes; hee oft [...] Frequented thir Assemblies, whereso met, [...] Triumphs or Festivals, and to them preachd [...] Conversion and Repentance, as to Souls [...] 720 [...] In prison under Judgements imminent: [...] But all in vain: which when he saw, he ceas'd [...] Contending, and remov'd his Tents farr off; [...] Then from the Mountain hewing Timber tall, [...] Began to build a Vessel of huge bulk, [...] Measur'd by Cubit, length, & breadth, and highth, [...] Smeard round with Pitch, and in the side a dore [...] Contriv'd, and of provisions laid in large [...] For Man and Beast: when loe a wonder strange! [...] Of everie Beast, and Bird, and Insect small [...] 730 [...] Came seavens, and pairs, and enterd in, as taught [...] Thir order; last the Sire, and his three Sons [...] With thir four Wives, and God made fast the dore. [...] Meanwhile the Southwind rose, & with black wings [...] Wide hovering, all the Clouds together drove [...] From under Heav'n; the Hills to their supplie [...] Vapour, and Exhalation dusk and moist, [...] Sent up amain; and now the thick'nd Skie [...] Like a dark Ceeling stood; down rush'd the Rain [...] Impetuous, and continu'd till the Earth [...] 740 [...] No more was seen; the floating Vessel swum [...] Uplifted; and secure with beaked prow [...] Rode tilting o're the Waves, all dwellings else [...] Flood overwhelmd, and them with all thir pomp [...] Deep under water rould; Sea cover'd Sea, [...] Sea without shoar; and in thir Palaces [...] Where luxurie late reign'd, Sea-monsters whelp'd [...] And stabl'd; of Mankind, so numerous late, [...] All left, in one small bottom swum imbark't. [...] How didst thou grieve then, Adam, to behold [...] 750 [...] The end of all thy Ofspring, end so sad, [...] Depopulation; thee another Floud, [...] Of tears and sorrow a Floud thee also drown'd, [...] And sunk thee as thy Sons; till gently reard [...] By th' Angel, on thy feet thou stoodst at last, [...] Though comfortless, as when a Father mourns [...] His Childern, all in view destroyd at once; [...] And scarce to th' Angel utterdst thus thy plaint. [...] O Visions ill foreseen! better had I [...] Liv'd ignorant of future, so had borne [...] 760 [...] My part of evil onely, each dayes lot [...] Anough to bear; those now, that were dispenst [...] The burd'n of many Ages, on me light [...] At once, by my foreknowledge gaining Birth [...] Abortive, to torment me ere thir being, [...] With thought that they must be. Let no man seek [...] Henceforth to be foretold what shall befall [...] Him or his Childern, evil he may be sure, [...] Which neither his foreknowing can prevent, [...] And hee the future evil shall no less [...] 770 [...] In apprehension then in substance feel [...] Grievous to bear: but that care now is past, [...] Man is not whom to warne: those few escap't [...] Famin and anguish will at last consume [...] Wandring that watrie Desert: I had hope [...] When violence was ceas't, and Warr on Earth, [...] All would have then gon well, peace would have crownd [...] With length of happy days the race of man; [...] But I was farr deceav'd; for now I see [...] Peace to corrupt no less then Warr to waste. [...] 780 [...] How comes it thus? unfould, Celestial Guide, [...] And whether here the Race of man will end. [...] To whom thus Michael. Those whom last thou sawst [...] In triumph and luxurious wealth, are they [...] First seen in acts of prowess eminent [...] And great exploits, but of true vertu void; [...] Who having spilt much blood, and don much waste [...] Subduing Nations, and achievd thereby [...] Fame in the World, high titles, and rich prey, [...] Shall change thir course to pleasure, ease, and sloth, [...] 790 [...] Surfet, and lust, till wantonness and pride [...] Raise out of friendship hostil deeds in Peace. [...] The conquerd also, and enslav'd by Warr [...] Shall with thir freedom lost all vertu loose [...] And feare of God, from whom thir pietie feign'd [...] In sharp contest of Battel found no aide [...] Against invaders; therefore coold in zeale [...] Thenceforth shall practice how to live secure, [...] Worldlie or dissolute, on what thir Lords [...] Shall leave them to enjoy; for th' Earth shall bear [...] 800 [...] More then anough, that temperance may be tri'd: [...] So all shall turn degenerate, all deprav'd, [...] Justice and Temperance, Truth and Faith forgot; [...] One Man except, the onely Son of light [...] In a dark Age, against example good, [...] Against allurement, custom, and a World [...] Offended; fearless of reproach and scorn, [...] Or violence, hee of thir wicked wayes [...] Shall them admonish, and before them set [...] The paths of righteousness, how much more safe, [...] 810 [...] And full of peace, denouncing wrauth to come [...] On thir impenitence; and shall returne [...] Of them derided, but of God observd [...] The one just Man alive; by his command [...] Shall build a wondrous Ark, as thou beheldst, [...] To save himself and houshold from amidst [...] A World devote to universal rack. [...] No sooner hee with them of Man and Beast [...] Select for life shall in the Ark be lodg'd, [...] And shelterd round, but all the Cataracts [...] 820 [...] Of Heav'n set open on the Earth shall powre [...] Raine day and night, all fountaines of the Deep [...] Broke up, shall heave the Ocean to usurp [...] Beyond all bounds, till inundation rise [...] Above the highest Hills: then shall this Mount [...] Of Paradise by might of Waves be moovd [...] Out of his place, pushd by the horned floud, [...] With all his verdure spoil'd, and Trees adrift [...] Down the great River to the op'ning Gulf, [...] And there take root an Iland salt and bare, [...] 830 [...] The haunt of Seales and Orcs, and Sea-mews clang. [...] To teach thee that God attributes to place [...] No sanctitie, if none be thither brought [...] By Men who there frequent, or therein dwell. [...] And now what further shall ensue, behold. [...] He lookd, and saw the Ark hull on the floud, [...] Which now abated, for the Clouds were fled, [...] Drivn by a keen North-winde, that blowing drie [...] Wrinkl'd the face of Deluge, as decai'd; [...] And the cleer Sun on his wide watrie Glass [...] 840 [...] Gaz'd hot, and of the fresh Wave largely drew, [...] As after thirst, which made thir flowing shrink [...] From standing lake to tripping ebbe, that stole [...] With soft foot towards the deep, who now had stopt [...] His Sluces, as the Heav'n his windows shut. [...] The Ark no more now flotes, but seems on ground [...] Fast {{on the top of}} som high mountain fixt. [...] And now the tops of Hills as Rocks appeer; [...] With clamor thence the rapid Currents drive [...] Towards the retreating Sea thir furious tyde. [...] 850 [...] Forthwith from out the Arke a Raven flies, [...] And after him, the surer messenger, [...] A Dove sent forth once and agen to spie [...] Green Tree or ground whereon his foot may light; [...] The second time returning, in his Bill [...] An Olive leafe he brings, pacific signe: [...] Anon drie ground appeers, and from his Arke [...] The ancient Sire descends with all his Train; [...] Then with uplifted hands, and eyes devout, [...] Grateful to Heav'n, over his head beholds [...] 860 [...] A dewie Cloud, and in the Cloud a Bow [...] Conspicuous with three lifted colours gay, [...] Betok'ning peace from God, and Cov'nant new. [...] Whereat the heart of Adam erst so sad [...] Greatly rejoyc'd, and thus his joy broke forth. [...] O thou that future things canst represent [...] As present, Heav'nly instructer, I revive [...] At this last sight, assur'd that Man shall live [...] With all the Creatures, and thir seed preserve. [...] Farr less I now lament for one whole World [...] 870 [...] Of wicked Sons destroyd, then I rejoyce [...] For one Man found so perfet and so just, [...] That God voutsafes to raise another World [...] From him, and all his anger to forget. [...] But say, what mean those colourd streaks in Heavn, [...] Distended as the Brow of God appeas'd, [...] Or serve they as a flourie verge to binde [...] The fluid skirts of that same watrie Cloud, [...] Least it again dissolve and showr the Earth? [...] To whom th' Archangel. Dextrously thou aim'st; [...] 880 [...] So willingly doth God remit his Ire, [...] Though late repenting him of Man deprav'd, [...] Griev'd at his heart, when looking down he saw [...] The whole Earth fill'd with violence, and all flesh [...] Corrupting each thir way; yet those remoov'd, [...] Such grace shall one just Man find in his sight, [...] That he relents, not to blot out mankind, [...] And makes a Covenant never to destroy [...] The Earth again by flood, nor let the Sea [...] Surpass his bounds, nor Rain to drown the World [...] 890 [...] With Man therein or Beast; but when he brings [...] Over the Earth a Cloud, will therein set [...] His triple-colour'd Bow, whereon to look [...] And call to mind his Cov'nant: Day and Night, [...] Seed time and Harvest, Heat and hoary Frost [...] Shall hold thir course, till fire purge all things new, [...] Both Heav'n and Earth, wherein the just shall dwell.|$|E
