40|$|The {{ability to}} {{simulate}} maneuvers of rotorcraft vehicles flying at {{the boundaries of}} the flight enve-lope is a valuable asset for performance analysis, handling qualities research, design and <b>certification,</b> <b>pilot</b> training, and support to the flight test activity. For all these applications, the performance limits of a rotorcraft can be estimated by using numerical optimization techniques. Using this approach, the maneuver of interest is formulated in terms of an optimal control problem, whose ingredients are a cost function to be minimized and constraints to be satisfied, for a given mathematical model of the vehicle; solving the problem yields both the control inputs and the vehicle response which minimize the cost and satisfy the constraints. Without such automated procedures and formulation, one would have to find the performance limits of the vehicle by forward time marching simulations, using a trial and error process on the vehicle inputs. Numerical procedures to solve trajectory optimization prob-lems in rotorcraft flight mechanics have been previously developed by our research group, as described in detail in Refs. [3, 4, 5, 6]. In this paper we refine our previous approach by including models of the pilot in the optimization procedure. In the absence of a pilot model, the solution of a trajectory optimization problem amount...|$|E
40|$|Hawai‘i {{lacks the}} number of skilled {{professionals}} needed to meet current and future healthcare demands. In {{order to meet the}} growing needs of Hawai‘i's residents, the Workforce Development Council, a state agency attached to the State Department of Labor and Industrial Relations, is looking to expand the primary care workforce 20 % by the year 2020. Using funds from a Healthcare Workforce Planning grant, the state formed several Healthcare Industry Skill Panels, a workforce development best practice from the State of Washington, to address the gap in healthcare services and healthcare workforce opportunities for Hawai‘i residents. Over 150 stakeholders—from employers, education, the public workforce system, economic development and labor—contributed their time and expertise to identify current workforce issues and develop action-oriented strategies to close industry skill gaps. So far these Skill Panels have developed a Critical Care Nursing Course Curriculum, a Workforce Readiness Curriculum and <b>Certification</b> <b>pilot</b> project, and a group to address specific barriers that are impeding Certified Nurse Aides (CNA). Upcoming initiatives include the distribution of a comprehensive statewide healthcare workforce development plan entitled Hawai‘i's Healthcare Workforce 20 / 20 Plan & Report: Addendum to the Comprehensive State Plan for Workforce Development 2009 – 2014, and the creation of HawaiiHealthCareers. org, a website to both recruit and support individuals interested in pursuing careers in the healthcare industry...|$|E

40|$|Diabetes {{mellitus}} is {{a disease}} with {{a wide spectrum of}} severity and many potential complications if inadequately treated. Historically, diabetic pilots have been permanently disqualified from flying duties. This policy was based on the increased risk of sudden incapacitation in-flight due to hypoglycaemia and cardiovascular disease in diabetics. In recent decades, a shift in worldwide aeromedical policy has occurred. This has resulted in diabetic pilots in several countries, including the United States and Australia, being granted limited flying <b>certification.</b> These <b>pilots</b> are required to satisfy a number of stringent medical criteria to achieve this certification.
