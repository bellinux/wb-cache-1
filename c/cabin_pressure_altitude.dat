50|$|The cabin {{altitude}} of the Boeing 767 is typically about 7000 ft when cruising at 37000 ft. This is typical for older jet airliners. A design goal for many, but not all, newer aircraft {{is to provide}} a lower {{cabin altitude}} than older designs. This can be beneficial for passenger comfort. For example, the Bombardier Global Express business jet can provide a cabin altitude of 4500 ft when cruising at 41000 ft. The Emivest SJ30 business jet can provide a sea-level cabin altitude when cruising at 41000 ft. One study of 8 flights in Airbus A380 aircraft found a median <b>cabin</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>altitude</b> of 6128 ft, and 65 flights in Boeing 747-400 aircraft found a median <b>cabin</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>altitude</b> of 5159 ft.|$|E

[...] Problems range from life support measures for astronauts to recognizing an ear block in an infant traveling on an airliner with elevated <b>cabin</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>altitude.</b> Aeromedical certification of pilots, aircrew and patients {{is also part of}} Aviation Medicine. A final subdivision is the AeroMedical Transportation Specialty. These military and civilian specialists are concerned with protecting aircrew and patients who are transported by AirEvac aircraft (helicopters or fixed-wing airplanes).|$|E
5000|$|All {{exhaust air}} is dumped to {{atmosphere}} via an outflow valve, usually {{at the rear}} of the fuselage. This valve controls the cabin pressure and also acts as a safety relief valve, in addition to other safety relief valves. If the automatic pressure controllers fail, the pilot can manually control the cabin pressure valve, according to the backup emergency procedure checklist. The automatic controller normally maintains the proper <b>cabin</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>altitude</b> by constantly adjusting the outflow valve position so that the cabin altitude is as low as practical without exceeding the maximum pressure differential limit on the fuselage. The pressure differential varies between aircraft types, typical values are between [...] and [...] At 39000 ft, the cabin pressure would be automatically maintained at about 6900 ft (450 ft lower than Mexico City), which is about [...] of atmosphere pressure.|$|E

50|$|Unplanned loss of <b>cabin</b> <b>pressure</b> at <b>altitude</b> is rare but has {{resulted}} in a number of fatal accidents. Failures range from sudden, catastrophic loss of airframe integrity (explosive decompression) to slow leaks or equipment malfunctions that allow <b>cabin</b> <b>pressure</b> to drop undetected to levels that can lead to unconsciousness or severe performance degradation of the aircrew.|$|R
5000|$|Prior to 1996, {{approximately}} 6,000 large commercial transport airplanes were type {{certified to}} fly up to 45000 ft, without {{being required to}} meet special conditions related to flight at high altitude. In 1996, the FAA adopted Amendment 25-87, which imposed additional high-altitude cabin-pressure specifications, for new designs of aircraft types. [...] For aircraft certified to operate above 25,000 feet (FL 250; 7,600 m), it [...] "must be designed so that occupants will not be exposed to <b>cabin</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>altitudes</b> in excess of 15000 ft after any probable failure condition in the pressurization system." [...] In {{the event of a}} decompression which results from [...] "any failure condition not shown to be extremely improbable," [...] the aircraft must be designed so that occupants will not be exposed to a cabin altitude exceeding 25000 ft for more than 2 minutes, nor exceeding an altitude of 40000 ft at any time. [...] In practice, that new FAR amendment imposes an operational ceiling of 40,000 feet on the majority of newly designed commercial aircraft.|$|R
40|$|As {{a result}} of {{technology}} developed at NASA s Kennedy Space Center, pilots now have a hand-held personal safety device to warn them of potentially dangerous or deteriorating <b>cabin</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>altitude</b> conditions before hypoxia becomes a threat. The Personal <b>Cabin</b> <b>Pressure</b> <b>Altitude</b> Monitor and Warning System monitors cabin pressure to determine when supplemental oxygen should be used according to Federal Aviation Regulations. The device benefits both pressurized and nonpressurized aircraft operations - warning pressurized aircraft when the required safe <b>cabin</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>altitude</b> is compromised, and reminding nonpressurized aircraft when supplemental oxygen is needed...|$|E
40|$|A <b>cabin</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>altitude</b> {{monitor and}} warning system {{provides}} a warning when a detected <b>cabin</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>altitude</b> {{has reached a}} predetermined level. The system is preferably embodied in a portable, pager-sized device that can be carried or worn by an individual. A microprocessor calculates the pressure altitude from signals generated by a calibrated pressure transducer and a temperature sensor that compensates for temperature variations in the signals generated by the pressure transducer. The microprocessor is programmed to generate a warning or alarm if a <b>cabin</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>altitude</b> exceeding a predetermined threshold is detected. Preferably, the microprocessor generates {{two different types of}} warning or alarm outputs, a first early warning or alert when a first pressure altitude is exceeded. and a second more serious alarm condition when either a second. higher pressure altitude is exceeded, or when the first pressure altitude has been exceeded for a predetermined period of time. Multiple types of alarm condition indicators are preferably provided, including visual, audible and tactile. The system is also preferably designed to detect gas concentrations and other ambient conditions, and thus incorporates other sensors, such as oxygen, relative humidity, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide and ammonia sensors, to provide a more complete characterization and monitoring of the local environment...|$|E
40|$|Maximum <b>cabin</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>altitude</b> {{is limited}} by {{regulation}} to 2440 m (8 kft) for normal flight. In case of cabin depressurization, the <b>cabin</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>altitude</b> may rapidly increase up to maximum A/C altitude. To protect the passengers from lack of oxygen (hypoxia), the passenger supplemental oxygen supply shall provide per regulation a minimum oxygenation equivalent to 3050 m (10 kft) or 4270 m (14, 000 kft) whether the <b>cabin</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>altitude</b> is lower or higher than 5640 m (18 kft). The corresponding airworthiness requirement CS/FAR 25. 1443 (c) defines the minimum performance in term of oxygen partial pressure in the trachea. For demonstration, international standards have been available (TSO C 64 a / SAE AS 8025) for several decades. 	More than the oxygen partial pressure in the trachea, the blood oxygen saturation is the most relevant parameter to characterize the level of oxygenation. Current medical instrumentation are available for measuring directly the blood oxygen saturation. This alternative means of demonstration has been systematically studied during a test campaign at the DLR – Institute of Aerospace Medicine in Cologne with human testing in altitude chamber. Different types of oxygen dispensing devices have been tested at different altitudes. Results show that the oxygenation level required by the regulation is achieved with significantly less oxygen than used so far. This is explained by the different efficiency level of oxygen transfer to the blood during the different phases of the breathing process. In other words, {{it is important to}} deliver oxygen at the right time, so that oxygen is effectively transferred to the blood and not “wasted” during subsequent exhalation. In the last years, this alternative means of compliance has been accepted by the Airworthiness Authorities. This has opened possibilities to introduce new technologies in oxygen dispensing equipment and {{to reduce the amount of}} oxygen to be transported on-board. These different opportunities are shortly presented and discussed. ...|$|E

40|$|A partial {{pressure}} suit was evaluated during tests in an F- 104 and F- 15 as a protective garment for emergency descents. The garment is an pressure jerkin and modified anti-g suit combined with an oronasal mask. The garment can be donned and doffed at the aircraft to minimize thermal buildup. The oronasal mask was favored by the pilots due to its immobility on the face during high g-loading. The garment was chosen to provide optimum dexterity for the pilot, which is not available in a full pressure suit, while protecting the pilot at altitudes up to 18, 288 meters, during a cabin decompression, and subsequent aircraft descent.

40|$|The {{airliner}} cabin {{environment and}} its effects on occupant health have not been fully characterized. This dissertation is: (1) A review of airliner environmental control systems (ECSs) that modulate the ventilation, temperature, relative humidity (RH), and barometric pressure (PB) of the cabin environment [...] -variables related to occupant comfort and health. (2) A review and assessment of the methods and findings of key cabin air quality (CAQ) investigations. Several significant deficiencies impede the drawing of inferences about CAQ, e. g., lack of detail about investigative methods, differences in methods between investigations, limited assessment of CAQ variables, small sample sizes, and technological deficiencies of data collection. (3) A comprehensive evaluation of the methods used in the subsequent NIOSH-FAA Airliner CAQ Exposure Assessment Feasibility Study (STUDY) in which this author participated. A number of problems were identified which limit the usefulness of the data. (4) An analysis of the reliable 10 -flight STUDY data. Univariate and multivariate methods applied to CO 2 (a surrogate for air contaminants), temperature, RH, and PB, in association with percent passenger load, ventilation system, flight duration, airliner body type, and measurement location within the cabin, revealed neither the measured values nor their variability exceeded established health-based exposure limits. Regression analyses suggest CO 2, temperature, and RH were affected by percent passenger load. In-flight measurements of CO 2 and RH were relatively independent of ventilation system type or flight duration. Cabin temperature was associated with percent passenger load, ventilation system type, and flight duration.

40|$|BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: In the low {{pressure}} environment of commercial aircraft, hypoxaemia may be common and accentuated in patients with lung or heart disease. Regulations specify a <b>cabin</b> <b>pressure</b> not lower than 750 hPa {{but it is not}} known whether this standard is met. This knowledge is important in determining the hazards of commercial flight for patients and the validity of current flight simulation tests. METHODS: Using a wrist-watch recording altimeter, <b>cabin</b> <b>pressure</b> was recorded at 60 s intervals on 45 flights in Boeing 747 - 400 aircraft with three airlines. A log was kept of aircraft altitude using the in-flight display. Change in <b>cabin</b> <b>pressure</b> during flight, relationship between aircraft <b>altitude</b> and <b>cabin</b> <b>pressure</b> and proportion of flight time with <b>cabin</b> <b>pressure</b> approaching the minimum specified by regulation were determined. RESULTS: Flight duration averaged 10 h. Average <b>cabin</b> <b>pressure</b> during flight was 846 hPa. There was a linear fall in <b>cabin</b> <b>pressure</b> as the aircraft cruising altitude increased. At 10, 300 m (34, 000 ft) <b>cabin</b> <b>pressure</b> was 843 hPa and changed 8 hPa for every 300 m (1000 ft) change in aircraft altitude (r(2) = 0. 993; P < 0. 001). Lowest <b>cabin</b> <b>pressure</b> was 792 hPa at 12 200 m (40, 000 ft) but during only 2 % of flight time was <b>cabin</b> <b>pressure</b> less than 800 hPa. CONCLUSIONS: <b>Cabin</b> <b>pressure</b> is determined only by the engineering of the aircraft and its altitude and {{in the present study was}} always higher than required by regulation. Current fitness-to-fly evaluations simulate cabin conditions that passengers will not experience on these aircraft. There may be increased risks to patients should new or older aircraft operate nearer to the present minimum standard. 5 page(s...|$|R
