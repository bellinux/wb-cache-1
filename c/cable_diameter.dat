50|$|Another {{advantage}} is that smaller diameter copper-clad steel conductors {{may be used in}} coaxial cables, permitting higher impedance and smaller <b>cable</b> <b>diameter</b> than with copper conductors of similar strength. Due to the inseparable union of the two metals, it deters theft since copper recovery is impractical and thus has very little scrap value.|$|E
5000|$|Fibre {{infrastructures}} need less cabling {{than traditional}} copper twisted pair networks. The volume of fibre optics cabling is considerably reduced. This {{is due to}} a very small fibre optic <b>cable</b> <b>diameter</b> of 9-50 mm. Typically, one FO-link replaces four twisted pair cables with no loss in bandwidth. This renders advanced redundancy concepts financially feasible.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Cable</b> <b>Diameter</b> and Properties: The next {{variable}} is {{the diameter of}} the cable. Cables can be any wire rope, which meets load strength requirements by the ICC. [...] The most available types are 1x19 1/8", 1x19 3/16", 7x7 3/16" [...] and 1x19 1/4". 316 Stainless Steel is preferred, due to its inherent nature against stretching, keeping long term maintenance down, as well as having anti-corrosive properties.|$|E

As a result, special measures are required to protect cables.

50|$|After the war, Vossberg set out {{to apply}} {{electronics}} technology to industrial applications. Electron-Machine Corporation was formed in 1946 {{for the purpose of}} designing automatic electronic gaging and indicating equipment. The company was established {{in the back of a}} radiator repair shop in Lynbrook, New York. Instruments for diameter and thickness measurements for steel and cable products were conceived, developed, and licensed to other manufacturers. These instruments included the first commercial x-ray thickness gage, optical <b>cable</b> <b>diameter</b> gages, and an industrial process control computer. In 1950 he, in partnership, formed the Industrial Gauges Corporation and later established Research Developments, Inc., as a subsidiary.

40|$|Graduation date: 1975 Short non-flexible {{elements}} of cable were driven harmonically in water while constrained by springs. The cable elements were observed to oscillate at approximately the Strouhal vortex shedding frequency. Damped resonance occurred near {{the point where}} the natural frequency and the Strouhal vertex shedding frequency were equal. Transverse oscillation amplitudes greater than one and one half <b>cable</b> <b>diameters</b> and hydrodynamic drag forces as much as seven times that normally experienced by rigidly constrained cylinders were observed in the neighborhood of the resonance point. A simple second order mathematical model was constructed which closely approximates the cable elements transverse response in the neighborhood of the resonance point...|$|R
50|$|Such a cable {{could be}} made out of any {{material}} able to support itself under tension by tapering the <b>cable's</b> <b>diameter</b> sufficiently quickly as it approached the Earth's surface. On Earth, with its relatively strong gravity, current materials are not sufficiently strong and light. With conventional materials, the taper ratio {{would need to be}} very large, increasing the total launch mass to a fiscally infeasible degree. However, carbon nanotube or boron nitride nanotube based materials have been proposed as the tensile element in the tether design. Their measured strengths are high compared to their linear densities. They hold promise as materials to make an Earth-based space elevator possible.|$|R
50|$|The minimum {{bend radius}} is of {{particular}} importance in the handling of fiber-optic cables, which are often used in telecommunications. The minimum bending radius will vary with different cable designs. The manufacturer should specify the minimum radius to which the cable may safely be bent during installation, and for the long term. The former is somewhat smaller than the latter. The {{minimum bend radius}} is in general also a function of tensile stresses, e.g., during installation, while being bent around a sheave while the fiber or cable is under tension. If no minimum bend radius is specified, one is usually safe in assuming a minimum long-term low-stress radius not less than 15 times the <b>cable</b> <b>diameter.</b>|$|E
50|$|For routing cables {{which are}} already {{assembled}} with connectors, split cable entry {{systems have been}} developed. The divisibility of these systems provides two advantages. The warranty on pre-terminated cables remains since the connectors don’t have to be cut and soldered again after entering the cables. The other advantage is that assembly can be done subsequently because the split cable entries are usually built around the existing lines.Most split cable entries consist of a split hard frame, made of plastic or sometimes aluminium (e.g. utilised in food industry) and one or several split sealing grommets, usually made of elastomer. The grommet matching the <b>cable</b> <b>diameter</b> is placed around the cable and fixed inside the cable entry frame. Thus allowing strain relief for the cables (in some cases according to EN 50262) as well as ingress protection of up to IP 65/66/67.|$|E

Here, 'improvement' is defined {{in the context of}} compromises that must be made among conflicting system constraints during any search for a design which reduces <b>cable</b> <b>diameter,</b> while increasing cable power transmission and strength. The evaluation considers transferred power, cable length, voltage regulation, cable strength and <b>cable</b> <b>diameter.</b> Cables with 1 -, 2 - and 3 conductors are compared, at a common diameter of 17. 3 mm (0. 68 ") and a common length of 10 km.

40|$|One {{objective}} of grid planning for low voltage grids {{is to determine}} <b>cable</b> <b>diameters</b> of feeders. This usually involves simulating worst case scenarios to estimate peak loads, although the probability of such scenarios to actually occur is not known. Furthermore, today's grid planning needs to account for new technologies like dispersed generation and electric vehicles. A worst case approach, for example, would consider generation without any simultaneous load. However, in practical experience {{there is always a}} minimum load, which mitigates the effect of voltage rise due to generation. This publication presents a new approach to probabilistic grid planning under the consideration of risks of certain scenarios to occur. This methodology can help to plan grids more efficiently...|$|R

Starting from the general, nonlinear one-dimensional cable equations with spatially varying <b>cable</b> <b>diameter,</b> the problem is shown to be eqiuvalent (under some variable transformations) {{to the case of}} uniform axons. Characterized by the same normal form, six functions for analytically treatable axon diameter variations are determined. For this class of nonuniform axons, exact solutions describing the propagation of the front of the action potential are derived. The results are used to evaluate the impact of geometric non-uniformity on the properties of propagating action potentials...|$|E

40|$|In the {{changing}} telecom world, demand for better transmission parameters for {{value added services}} with cost effective solution is increasing. With this research for developing lower dielectric materials for insulation and cable filling compounds is going on worldwide. This was instrumental to develop a twisted pair copper cable with low dielectric constant jelly. It is evident that if the dielectric of jelly {{is lower than the}} diameter over insulation can be reduced. The reduction in insulated diameter in turn results in overall reduction of the <b>cable</b> <b>diameter</b> and as a consequence consumption of various raw materials with improved Characteristics of cable also reduced.

40|$|A {{series of}} wind tunnel tests {{were carried out}} to measure drag and lift {{coefficients}} of inclined circular cylinders with artificial rivulet for later investigation on wind-rain-induced cable vibration. The axial flow effect was naturally included in the tests, compared with previous non-yawed horizontal cylinder tests. The test Reynolds number for smooth circular cylinders in uniform flow ranged from 9. 38 × 10 4 to 1. 93 × 10 5. A special test apparatus was designed and manufactured for easy execution of measurements. The effects of artificial rivulet, its shape, and its size on aerodynamic coefficients are discussed in this paper based on wind tunnel test results.

40|$|Non-powered flight {{vehicles}} such as kites {{can provide}} a means of transmitting wind energy from higher altitudes to the ground via tethers. At Delft University of Technology, construction and testing of such a high altitude wind machine is ongoing. The concept is called the Laddermill. It generates energy by pulling a line under high tension from a drum with a kite and retrieving it under low tension. The change in tension is achieved by changing the angle of attack and flight pattern of the kite. This paper presents a modeling and optimization approach {{that can be used}} to help design Laddermill systems for particular sites around the world. Some crude assumptions are used to derive the average power that can be produced by a Laddermill system, taking into the most important system parameters.

40|$|Flow-induced {{resonance}} for a two-end hinged cable under uniform incoming flows is investigated using analytical prediction and numerical simulation. In this study, {{the fundamental}} mode is analyzed for simplicity. First, {{based on a}} series of physical judgments, the approximate cable trajectory is predicted - the whole cable vibrates as a standing wave, with its locus on the transverse cross-section having a convex " 8 "-like shape. To find the exact path, however, experiment or numerical simulation is necessary. Hence, a bronze cable at aspect ratio (length/diameter) of 100 under water flows at Reynolds number (based on <b>cable</b> <b>diameter</b> and incoming velocity) of 200 is computed. The result confirms our predictions. Moreover, it is found that the amplitude of the cross-flow displacement is much higher than that of the streamwise displacement, despite the higher streamwise fluid force. As a consequence, energy transfer from fluid to solid is maximized in the cross-flow direction. Copyright © 2005 by ASME...|$|E
50|$|Coaxial cable conducts {{electrical}} signal using an inner conductor (usually a solid copper, stranded copper or copper plated steel wire) {{surrounded by an}} insulating layer and all enclosed by a shield, typically one to four layers of woven metallic braid and metallic tape. The cable is protected by an outer insulating jacket. Normally, the shield is kept at ground potential and a signal carrying voltage {{is applied to the}} center conductor. The advantage of coaxial design is that electric and magnetic fields are restricted to the dielectric with little leakage outside the shield. Conversely, electric and magnetic fields outside the cable are largely kept from interfering with signals inside the <b>cable.</b> Larger <b>diameter</b> <b>cables</b> and cables with multiple shields have less leakage. This property makes coaxial cable a good choice for carrying weak signals that cannot tolerate interference from the environment or for stronger {{electrical signal}}s that must not be allowed to radiate or couple into adjacent structures or circuits.|$|R
