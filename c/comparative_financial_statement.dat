This is a descriptive and qualitative research, based on analysis of <b>financial</b> <b>statements</b> of 2010. For this, a check list based on CPC 29 was applied, allowing the comparison between public and private companies through of the Mann-Whitney test. The data analyzed allow concluding that most of the sample opted to use fair value as the measurement basis, but did not disclose the assumptions used in the method adopted. This situation undermines the <b>comparative</b> analysis of <b>financial</b> <b>statements</b> and decreases its relevance to users, besides allowing practices of earnings management.
