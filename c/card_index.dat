25|$|With the {{outbreak}} of World War I, the ICRC found itself confronted with enormous challenges that it could handle only by {{working closely with the}} national Red Cross societies. Red Cross nurses from around the world, including the United States and Japan, came to support the medical services of the armed forces of the European countries involved in the war. On 15 October 1914, immediately after the start of the war, the ICRC set up its International Prisoners-of-War (POW) Agency, which had about 1,200 mostly volunteer staff members by the end of 1914. By the end of the war, the Agency had transferred about 20 million letters and messages, 1.9 million parcels, and about 18 million Swiss francs in monetary donations to POWs of all affected countries. Furthermore, due to the intervention of the Agency, about 200,000 prisoners were exchanged between the warring parties, released from captivity and returned to their home country. The organizational <b>card</b> <b>index</b> of the Agency accumulated about 7 million records from 1914 to 1923, each card representing an individual prisoner or missing person. The <b>card</b> <b>index</b> led to the identification of about 2 million POWs and the ability to contact their families. The complete index is on loan today from the ICRC to the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Museum in Geneva. The right to access the index is still strictly restricted to the ICRC.|$|E

25|$|In 1939, {{he became}} privatdozent for his seminal work and {{habilitation}} thesis Naujausių proistorinių tyrinėjimų duomenys (Findings of the Most Recent Archaeological Explorations). This work became a textbook on prehistory of Lithuania. It was superseded only by Lietuvos archeologijos bruožai published in 1961. Puzinas aggregated, summarized, and interpreted data from different excavations in 1928–38 {{and created a}} chronological outline of the prehistory of Lithuania. His periodization of the three ages in Lithuania is still used by modern scholars. The work featured {{a large number of}} new scientific terms in Lithuanian language that Puzinas created in collaboration with linguist Antanas Salys. To that end Puzinas created a <b>card</b> <b>index</b> file with archaeological terms in various languages (Lithuanian, Polish, German, Russian). The file, about 9,000 or 10,000 cards in total, is preserved by Martynas Mažvydas National Library of Lithuania. Among the basic terms introduced by Puzinas are radinys (find) and žalvario amžius (Bronze Age). Possibly it was an embryo of a multilingual archaeological dictionary.|$|E
25|$|The {{legal basis}} {{of the work of}} the ICRC during World War II was the Geneva Conventions in their 1929 revision. The {{activities}} of the Committee were similar to those during World War I: visiting and monitoring POW camps, organizing relief assistance for civilian populations, and administering the exchange of messages regarding prisoners and missing persons. By the end of the war, 179 delegates had conducted 12,750 visits to POW camps in 41 countries. The Central Information Agency on Prisoners-of-War (Zentralauskunftsstelle für Kriegsgefangene) had a staff of 3,000, the <b>card</b> <b>index</b> tracking prisoners contained 45million cards, and 120million messages were exchanged by the Agency. One major obstacle was that the Nazi-controlled German Red Cross refused to cooperate with the Geneva statutes including blatant violations such as the deportation of Jews from Germany and the mass murders conducted in the concentration camps run by the German government. Moreover, two other main parties to the conflict, the Soviet Union and Japan, were not party to the 1929 Geneva Conventions and were not legally required to follow the rules of the conventions.|$|E
25|$|On 13 September 1984 Chikatilo was {{observed}} by an undercover detective attempting to lure young women {{away from a}} Rostov bus station. He was arrested and held. A search of his belongings revealed a knife and rope. He was also discovered to be under investigation for minor theft {{at one of his}} former employers, which gave the investigators the legal right to hold him for a prolonged period of time. Chikatilo's dubious background was uncovered, and his physical description matched the description of the man seen with Dmitry Ptashnikov in March prior to the boy's murder. A sample of Chikatilo's blood was taken; the results of which revealed his blood group to be type A, whereas semen samples found upon a total of six victims murdered by the unknown killer throughout {{the spring and summer of}} 1984 had been classified by medical examiners to be type AB. Chikatilo's name was added to the <b>card</b> <b>index</b> file used by investigators; however, the results of his blood type analysis largely discounted him as being the unknown killer.|$|E
