40|$|Abstract — The {{universal}} {{mobile telecommunications}} system uti-lizes a three-level location-management strategy {{to reduce the}} net costs of location update and paging in the packet-switched service domain. Within a communication session, a mobile station (MS) is tracked at the cell level during packet transmission. In the idle period of an ongoing session, the MS is tracked at the UTRAN registration area (URA) level to avoid frequent cell updates while still keeping the radio connection. If the MS is not in any com-munication session, the MS is tracked at the routing-area (RA) level. The inactivity <b>counter</b> <b>mechanism</b> was proposed in 3 GPP 25. 331 to determine when to switch between the three location-tracking modes. In this <b>mechanism,</b> two inactivity <b>counters</b> are used to count the numbers of cell and URA updates in an idle pe-riod between two packet transmissions. If the number of cell up-dates reaches a threshold 1, the MS is switched from cell tracking to URA tracking.

30|$|Our <b>counter</b> <b>mechanism</b> has two {{parameters}} to set. From {{the perspective}} of the precision of the degree of contention, less g and moderate WS are welcomed. This is because larger g and WS will lead to stale degree of contention and the reordering will not eliminate harmful ordering. Too small WS compared to g will lost much contention information. From {{the perspective of}} memory overhead, large WS is not expected. However, too small g is prohibited by hardware. In this paper, experiments show that the setting of WS = 1  s and g = 100  ms works well under HFT workloads.|$|R
50|$|These are {{the most}} common type of gas meter, seen in almost all {{residential}} and small commercial installations. Within the meter there are two or more chambers formed by movable diaphragms. With the gas flow directed by internal valves, the chambers alternately fill and expel gas, producing a nearly continuous flow through the meter. As the diaphragms expand and contract, levers connected to cranks convert the linear motion of the diaphragms into rotary motion of a crank shaft which serves as the primary flow element. This shaft can drive an odometer-like <b>counter</b> <b>mechanism</b> or it can produce electrical pulses for a flow computer.|$|R

40|$|Over {{millions}} of years, the oxidation of organic carbon contained within sedimentary rocks {{is one of}} the main sources of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere, yet the controls on this emission remain poorly constrained. We use rhenium to track the oxidation of rock-bound organic carbon in the mountain watersheds of New Zealand, where high rates of physical erosion expose rocks to chemical weathering. Oxidative weathering fluxes are two to three times higher in watersheds dominated by valley glaciers and exposed to frost shattering processes, compared to those with less glacial cover; a feature that we also observe in mountain watersheds globally. Consequently, we show that mountain glaciation can result in an atmospheric carbon dioxide source during weathering and erosion, as fresh minerals are exposed for weathering in an environment with high oxygen availability.

40|$|AbstractHuman {{immunodeficiency}} virus type 1 (HIV- 1) needs to overcome cellular <b>counter</b> <b>mechanisms</b> such as to successfully propagate itself. Results of our recent {{studies show that}} overexpression of insulin-like growth factor II mRNA binding protein 1 (IMP 1) inhibits production of infectious HIV- 1 particles through adversely affecting virus maturation. Here, we report that IMP 1 interacts with HIV- 1 Rev protein and its ectopic expression causes relocation of Rev from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. In accordance with this observation, ectopic expression of IMP 1 severely diminishes Rev-dependent expression of CAT enzyme and disturbs HIV- 1 RNA expression by causing accumulation of the multiple spliced viral RNA. Results of mutagenesis analysis further reveal that the KH 4 domain represents the key element of IMP 1 in modulating HIV- 1 RNA expression. Taken together, these data suggest, in addition to hampering virus assembly, that IMP 1 also {{has an effect on}} Rev-dependent viral RNA expression...|$|R

Dead or Alive Ultimate 2, being a remake created after the debut of Dead or Alive 3, takes elements and mechanics from both its original iteration and successor. The action of 3D-axis movement is as free-formatted as DOA3, and Hitomi is now a playable character albeit outside story mode. Other elements have been kept intact from DOA2. These include higher damaging counters than in DOA3, environmental hazards not warranting a knockout on a character, and a <b>counter</b> <b>mechanism</b> that is much harder to execute. Despite being able to freely move on a 3D axis in the Ultimate version of DOA2 however, most moves cannot be sidestepped as in other 3D fighters, {{as well as in}} DOA3.

The final major set of changes instituted in Ultimate is the inclusion of slopes, which are a type of environmental hazard where those knocked down them roll down the slope, taking damage as they fall.|$|R
40|$|Abstract- This paper {{presents}} and analyzes a collision avoidance mechanism {{that increases the}} throughput and decreases the delay in wireless local area networks. The analysis considers the IEEE 802. 11 standard parameters employed in the Distributed Coordination Function used in the Ad Hoc mode operation. The mechanism {{is based on the}} Deferral Counter (DC) algorithm proposed in the HomePlug standard. The purpose of the Deferral Counter is to increase the contention window faster than the regular IEEE 802. 11 backoff function to avoid collisions. Different from IEEE 802. 11, the mechanism increments the contention window of the deferring stations to minimize collisions. We implement this mechanism in the ns- 2 simulator in order to compare it with IEEE 802. 11. We propose three different functions to use in the Deferral <b>Counter</b> <b>mechanism</b> and evaluate their performance considering network throughput, packet delay, and the percentage of overlapping transmissions. The results show that the proposed mechanism performs better when there are more than four active stations no matter the packet size. Furthermore, we also show that the DC function, which achieves the best network throughput depends on the packet size and the number of active nodes...|$|R

Infection of rhesus macaques with simian varicella virus (SVV) recapitulates VZV pathogenesis in hu-mans thus representing a suitable animal model for VZV infection. While the type I interfer-on (IFN) response {{has been shown to}} affect VZV replication, the virus employs <b>counter</b> <b>mechanisms</b> to prevent the induction of anti-viral IFN stimulated genes (ISG). Here, we demonstrate that SVV inhibits type I IFN-activated signal transduction via the JAK-STAT pathway. SVV-infected rhesus fibroblasts were refractory to IFN stimulation displaying re-duced protein levels of IRF 9 and lacking STAT 2 phosphorylation. Since previous work im-plicated involvement of the VZV immediate early gene product ORF 63 in preventing ISG-induction we studied the role of SVV ORF 63 in generating resistance to IFN treatment. In-terestingly, SVV ORF 63 did not affect STAT 2 phosphorylation but caused IRF 9 degradation in a proteasome-dependent manner, suggesting that SVV employs multiple mechanisms to counteract the effect of IFN.
