5|$|Born in Burntwood, Staffordshire, Sutton {{performed}} well at school, but withdrew his applications to university in 2012 after his terminal prognosis for <b>colorectal</b> cancer. His father had fought the disease twice, {{and both were}} predisposed to it through Lynch syndrome. Sutton had struggled to get a diagnosis as doctors {{did not believe that}} <b>colorectal</b> cancer could occur in a teenager.|$|E

5|$|Stansfield was {{diagnosed}} with <b>colorectal</b> cancer in April 2010. He returned to training after surgery and chemotherapy, but died on 10 August that year. A foundation in his name was posthumously set up by his family to provide sporting opportunities and raise awareness of <b>colorectal</b> cancer. He has posthumously been featured on a Flybe airliner livery and tourist currency in Exeter.|$|E
5|$|Aspirin {{is thought}} to reduce the overall risk of both getting cancer and dying from cancer. This effect is {{particularly}} beneficial for <b>colorectal</b> cancer (CRC). It may also slightly {{reduce the risk of}} endometrial cancer, breast cancer, and prostate cancer.|$|E
5|$|Sadasivan was {{diagnosed}} with <b>colorectal</b> cancer and underwent surgical removal of a malignant tumour in 2008. He relinquished his Information, Communications and the Arts portfolio with effect from 1 April 2008, remaining as Senior Minister of State for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.|$|E
5|$|Simon was {{diagnosed}} with terminal <b>colorectal</b> cancer in 2012 and given only {{three to six months}} to live. Simon died on March 8, 2015. He bequeathed his $100 million estate to various charities which he actively supported during his lifetime.|$|E
5|$|Targeted {{monoclonal}} antibody therapy is employed to treat {{diseases such as}} rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, psoriasis, and many forms of cancer including non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, <b>colorectal</b> cancer, head and neck cancer and breast cancer.|$|E
5|$|The {{radioactive}} isotope yttrium-90 {{is used in}} drugs such as Yttrium Y 90-DOTA-tyr3-octreotide and Yttrium Y 90 ibritumomab tiuxetan {{for the treatment of}} various cancers, including lymphoma, leukemia, liver, ovarian, <b>colorectal,</b> pancreatic and bone cancers. It works by adhering to monoclonal antibodies, which in turn bind to cancer cells and kill them via intense β-radiation from the yttrium-90 (see Monoclonal antibody therapy).|$|E
25|$|A 2016 {{meta-analysis}} {{found no}} effect of garlic on <b>colorectal</b> cancer. A 2014 meta-analysis found garlic supplements or allium vegetables {{to have no}} effect on <b>colorectal</b> cancers.|$|E
25|$|In {{the same}} year he also {{attended}} a European master-class in “Laparoscopic <b>colorectal</b> surgery” in Bordeaux (France) and the “Advanced Course in Laparoscopic <b>colorectal</b> Surgery” in Strasbourg at the European Institute of Telesurgery.|$|E
25|$|An {{experiment}} {{designed with}} a large sample and conducted by NIH-AARP Diet and Health Study studied the correlation between fiber intake and <b>colorectal</b> cancer. The analytic cohort consisted of 291,988 men and 197,623 women aged 50–71 years. Diet was assessed with a self-administered food-frequency questionnaire at baseline in 1995–1996; 2,974 incident <b>colorectal</b> cancer cases were identified during five years of follow-up. The result was that total fiber intake {{was not associated with}} <b>colorectal</b> cancer. But on the other hand, the analyses of fiber from different food sources showed that fiber from grains was associated with a lower risk of <b>colorectal</b> cancer.|$|E

25|$|<b>Colorectal</b> {{cancer is}} a disease of old age: It {{typically}} originates in the secretory cells lining the gut, and risk factors include diets low in vegetable fibre and high in fat. If a younger person gets such a cancer, it {{is often associated with}} hereditary syndromes like Peutz-Jegher's, hereditary nonpolyposis <b>colorectal</b> cancer or familial adenomatous polyposis. <b>Colorectal</b> cancer can be detected through the bleeding of a polyp, colicky bowel pain, a bowel obstruction or the biopsy of a polyp at a screening colonoscopy. A constant feeling of having to go to the toilet or anemia might also point to this kind of cancer.|$|E
25|$|Tentative {{evidence}} supports a beneficial role as add-on therapy in <b>colorectal</b> cancer.|$|E
25|$|Zelazny died in 1995, aged 58, {{of kidney}} failure {{secondary}} to <b>colorectal</b> cancer.|$|E
25|$|A novel miRNA-profiling-based {{screening}} assay {{for the detection}} of early-stage <b>colorectal</b> cancer is undergoing a clinical trial. Early results showed that blood plasma samples collected from patients with early, resectable (Stage II) <b>colorectal</b> cancer could be distinguished from those of sex-and age-matched healthy volunteers. Sufficient selectivity and specificity could be achieved using small (less than 1 mL) samples of blood.|$|E
25|$|A {{recent study}} {{suggested}} that caffeine may inhibit paclitaxel-induced apoptosis in <b>colorectal</b> cancer cells.|$|E
25|$|Those with {{a family}} history in two or more first-degree {{relatives}} (such as a parent or sibling) have a two to threefold greater risk of disease and this group accounts for about 20% of all cases. A number of genetic syndromes are also associated with higher rates of <b>colorectal</b> cancer. The most common of these is hereditary nonpolyposis <b>colorectal</b> cancer (HNPCC or Lynch syndrome) which is present in about 3% of people with <b>colorectal</b> cancer. Other syndromes that are strongly associated with <b>colorectal</b> cancer include Gardner syndrome, and familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP). For people with these syndromes, cancer almost always occurs and makes up 1% of the cancer cases. A total proctocolectomy may be recommended for people with FAP as a preventative measure due to the high risk of malignancy. Colectomy, removal of the colon, may not suffice as a preventative measure {{because of the high}} risk of rectal cancer if the rectum remains.|$|E
25|$|Studies {{have overall}} not shown {{effects on the}} {{relative}} risks for <b>colorectal,</b> malignant melanoma or thyroid cancers.|$|E
25|$|Furthermore, {{specific}} miRNAs may {{be associated}} with certain histological subtypes of <b>colorectal</b> cancer. For instance, expression levels of miR-205 and miR-373 {{have been shown to be}} increased in mucinous <b>colorectal</b> cancers and mucin-producing Ulcerative Colitis-associated colon cancers, but not in sporadic colonic adenocarcinoma that lack mucinous components. In-vitro studies suggested that miR-205 and miR-373 may functionally induce different features of mucinous-associated neoplastic progression in intestinal epithelial cells.|$|E
25|$|Greater than 75–95% of <b>colorectal</b> cancer {{occurs in}} people {{with little or no}} genetic risk. Risk factors include older age, male gender, high intake of fat, alcohol, red meat, {{processed}} meats, obesity, smoking, and a lack of physical exercise. Approximately 10% of cases are linked to insufficient activity. The risk from alcohol appears to increase at greater than one drink per day. Drinking 5 glasses of water a day is linked to a decrease in the risk of <b>colorectal</b> cancer and adenomatous polyps. Streptococcus gallolyticus is associated with <b>colorectal</b> cancer. Some strains of Streptococcus bovis/Streptococcus equinus complex are consumed by millions of people daily and thus may be safe. 25 to 80% of people with Streptococcus bovis/gallolyticus bacteremia have concomitant <b>colorectal</b> tumors. Seroprevalence of Streptococcus bovis/gallolyticus is considered as a candidate practical marker for the early prediction of an underlying bowel lesion at high risk population. It has been suggested that the presence of antibodies to Streptococcus bovis/gallolyticus antigens or the antigens themselves in the bloodstream may act as markers for the carcinogenesis in the colon.|$|E
25|$|Mutation of APC also occurs {{commonly}} in incident {{cases of}} <b>colorectal</b> carcinoma, emphasizing its importance {{in this form}} of cancer.|$|E
25|$|One review found limited {{evidence}} for {{a positive relationship between}} consuming animal fat and incidence of <b>colorectal</b> cancer.|$|E
25|$|Loss of DCC in <b>colorectal</b> cancer {{primarily}} occurs via chromosomal instability, {{with only}} a small percent having epigenetic silencing involved.|$|E
25|$|Epigenetic factors, such as {{abnormal}} DNA methylation of tumor suppressor promoters {{play a role}} in {{the development}} of <b>colorectal</b> cancer.|$|E

25|$|Gastrointestinal cancer {{may occur}} {{at any point}} in the {{gastrointestinal}} tract, and includes mouth cancer, tongue cancer, oesophageal cancer, stomach cancer, and <b>colorectal</b> cancer.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the most}} {{frequent}} genetic abnormalities that occur in advanced <b>colorectal</b> cancer is loss of heterozygosity (LOH) of DCC in region 18q21.|$|E
25|$|In some cancers, such as {{melanoma}} and <b>colorectal</b> cancer, lymphocytes can migrate {{into and}} attack the tumor. This can sometimes lead to regression {{of the primary}} tumor.|$|E

25|$|Mutations and {{overexpression}} of β-catenin {{are associated}} with many cancers, including hepatocellular carcinoma, <b>colorectal</b> carcinoma, lung cancer, malignant breast tumors, ovarian and endometrial cancer. Alterations in the localization and expression levels of beta-catenin {{have been associated with}} various forms of heart disease, including dilated cardiomyopathy. β-catenin is regulated and destroyed by the beta-catenin destruction complex, and in particular by the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) protein, encoded by the tumour-suppressing APC gene. Therefore, genetic mutation of the APC gene is also strongly linked to cancers, and in particular <b>colorectal</b> cancer resulting from familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP).|$|E
25|$|ANNs {{have been}} used to {{diagnose}} cancers, including lung cancer, prostate cancer, <b>colorectal</b> cancer and to distinguish highly invasive cancer cell lines from less invasive lines using only cell shape information.|$|E
25|$|Oliver was {{diagnosed}} with <b>colorectal</b> cancer that later metastasized to her lungs and she passed away on May 10, 1990 at the Motion Picture & Television Hospital in Woodland Hills, California.|$|E
25|$|Colonoscopy {{screening}} prevents {{approximately two}} thirds of the deaths due to <b>colorectal</b> cancers {{on the left side of}} the colon, and is not associated with a significant reduction in deaths from right-sided disease.|$|E
25|$|Early {{studies of}} <b>colorectal</b> tumours found that allelic deletions of {{segments}} of chromosome 18q {{occur in a}} very high percentage of <b>colorectal</b> cancers. DCC was initially cloned out {{of the region and}} put forth as a putative tumour suppressor gene, though nothing was known about its function at the time. The DCC gene was examined for the genetic changes found with most other tumour suppressor genes, but it was found to have a comparatively low frequency of somatic mutation. Several years later DCC was shown to encode a transmembrane receptor protein that mediated the effects of netrin-1 on axon outgrowth.|$|E
