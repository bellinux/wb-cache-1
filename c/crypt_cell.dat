40|$|Background: A {{defining}} {{characteristic of}} the human intestinal epithelium {{is that it is}} the most rapidly renewing tissue in the body. However, the processes underlying tissue renewal and the mechanisms that govern their coordination have proved difficult to study in the human gut. Objective: To investigate the regulation of stem cell-driven tissue renewal by canonical Wnt and TGFβ/bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) pathways in the native human colonic epithelium. Design: Intact human colonic crypts were isolated from mucosal tissue samples and placed into 3 D culture conditions optimised for steady-state tissue renewal. High affinity mRNA in situ hybridisation and immunohistochemistry were complemented by functional genomic and bioimaging techniques. The effects of signalling pathway modulators on the status of intestinal stem cell biology, <b>crypt</b> <b>cell</b> proliferation, migration, differentiation and shedding were determined. Results: Native human colonic crypts exhibited distinct activation profiles for canonical Wnt, TGFβ and BMP pathways. A population of intestinal LGR 5 /OLFM 4 -positive stem/progenitor cells were interspersed between goblet-like cells within the crypt-base. Exogenous and crypt cell-autonomous canonical Wnt signals supported homeostatic intestinal stem/progenitor cell proliferation and were antagonised by TGFβ or BMP pathway activation. Reduced Wnt stimulation impeded <b>crypt</b> <b>cell</b> proliferation, but <b>crypt</b> <b>cell</b> migration and shedding from the crypt surface were unaffected and resulted in diminished crypts. Conclusions: Steady-state tissue renewal in the native human colonic epithelium is dependent on canonical Wnt signals combined with suppressed TGFβ/BMP pathways.

In villus cells, the rate of recovery from a propionate-induced alkaline load was not altered by clonidine. However, clonidine stimulated recovery from an acid load induced by NH 4 Cl, Na removal, or amiloride.

Glucose- and alanine-stimulated Na absorption were also reduced, while toxin had no effect on either basal short-circuit current or the secretory response to theophylline.

We have recently described enhanced expression of IFN-alpha in the mucosa {{of patients with}} celiac disease (CD), a gluten-sensitive Th 1 -mediated enteropathy, characterized by villous atrophy and <b>crypt</b> <b>cell</b> hyperplasia. Previous studies from this laboratory have shown that T cell activation in explant cultures of human fetal gut can also result in villous atrophy and <b>crypt</b> <b>cell</b> hyperplasia.

Histological analysis of the intestinal specimens revealed crypt loss and villus atrophy with damage maximal on day 5 after methotrexate injection, and normalization of mucosal structure commencing on day 6. <b>Crypt</b> <b>cell</b> proliferation was decreased dramatically on day 3, normalized on day 4 and up-regulated on days 5 and 6.

Elemental diet mice infected with the protozoan Giardia muris did not have villous atrophy but there was a significant increase in crypt length and metaphase accumulation when compared with infected normal diet mice. These experiments show that in two animal models of enteric infection, elemental diet has altered the host parasite relationship {{to the detriment of the}} host...|$|E
40|$|The mucosa of the {{functioning}} pelvic ileal pouch undergoes loss of villous height {{and an increase}} in <b>crypt</b> <b>cell</b> proliferation as an adaptive response to its new luminal environment. These changes can occur in the absence of inflammation and could be mediated by growth factors such as transforming growth factors alpha and beta 1 (TGF alpha and TGF beta 1). Expression of TGF alpha and TGF beta 1 messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein was determined by in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry in sections of terminal ileum taken at the time of pouch formation and of subsequent pouch biopsies from 14 patients (total of 90 specimens). <b>Crypt</b> <b>cell</b> proliferation was assessed using the monoclonal antibody MIB- 1. As ileal pouch mucosa underwent loss of villous height and crypt hyperplasia, epithelial expression of TGF alpha mRNA and protein decreased. In contrast, TGF beta 1 mRNA and protein were abundant in both normal and flat mucosa. Epithelial expression of TGF beta 1 protein was maximal in flat, inflamed biopsies. These results suggest that although altered expression of TGF alpha and TGF beta 1 mRNA and protein may play some part in the regulation of the adaptive response in ileal pouch mucosa, TGF alpha does not have a direct, positive role in the regulation of <b>crypt</b> <b>cell</b> proliferation...|$|E
40|$|AbstractSialyltransferase {{activity}} was assayed in rat intestinal cells isolated as fractions reflecting the villus-crypt axis of differentiation. In 13 -day-old rats both endo- and exogenous sialyltransferase activity reached their maximum in undifferentiated <b>crypt</b> <b>cells</b> and their peaks overlapped. In contrast, sialyltransferase {{of the adult}} intestine was 4 -fold {{lower than that of}} sucklings in the crypts, with slight tendency to be transferred to the villus cells. Hydrocortisone applied to 10 -day-old rats caused three days later a precocious drop of sialyltransferase activity in the <b>crypt</b> <b>cells.</b> Unlike in vivo, glucocorticoid responsiveness was accompanied by increased sialyltransferase activity in fetal small intestine cultivated for 17 days...|$|R
40|$|Villus and <b>crypt</b> <b>cells</b> {{were removed}} from rabbit ileum by a {{modification}} of a method previously described. Villus cells were isolated by vibration of everted bowel segments in citrate buffer, and <b>crypt</b> <b>cells</b> were removed by the expansion of these segments with air and simultaneous vibration in citrate buffer. Several culture media were tested for the maintenance and/or culture of these cells. Two defined media, Eagle's minimum and medium 199, were unsatisfactory and led to rapid cell death. The presence of whole serum was beneficial and both cell types could be maintained for several hours when homologous rabbit serum was employed. Initially 70 - 80 % of villus and <b>crypt</b> <b>cells</b> were viable in homologous serum, {{and the effect of}} cholera toxin on cell viability was studied by incubating the cells with peptone dialysate supernatant (PSUP) toxin from Vibrio cholerae for 4 h. PSUP toxin reduced the viability of both villus and <b>crypt</b> <b>cells</b> compared with control preparations, as measured by the uptake of trypan blue; cell death was accelerated with time. A purified, diarrhoea-inducing cholera toxin also reduced the viability of these cells and the results were comparable to those with PSUP toxin. The effect was usually immediate, and a significant reduction in viability occurred within 1 hour of the incubation of cells with toxin. The toxin was heat-labile (60 °C/ 30 min) and nondialysable, and its cytotoxic activity could be completely neutralized with cholera antitoxin. Dose—response studies indicated that as little as 0. 0275 equivalent units of ligated ileal loop toxin were active in this system...|$|R
40|$|Fermentation of nonabsorbed {{nutrients}} in the colon generates {{high concentrations of}} NH 3 /NH 4 + in the colonic lumen. NH 3 is a small, lipophilic neutral weak base that readily permeates almost all cell membranes, whereas its conjugate weak acid NH 4 + generally crosses membranes much more slowly. It is not known how colonocytes maintain intracellular pH in the unusual acid-base environment of the colon, where permeant acid-base products of fermentation exist in high concentration. To address this issue, we hand dissected and perfused single, isolated crypts from rabbit proximal colon, adapting techniques from renal-tubule microperfusion. Crypt perfusion permits control of solutions at the apical (luminal) and basolateral (serosal) surfaces of <b>crypt</b> <b>cells.</b> We assessed apical- vs. basolateral-membrane transport of NH 3 /NH 4 + by using fluorescent dyes and digital imaging to monitor intracellular pH of microvacuolated <b>crypt</b> <b>cells</b> as well as luminal pH. We found that, although the basolateral membranes have normal NH 3 /NH 4 + permeability properties, {{there is no evidence}} for transport of either NH 3 or NH 4 + across the apical borders of these <b>crypt</b> <b>cells.</b> Disaggregating luminal mucus did not increase the transport of NH 3 /NH 4 + across the apical border. We conclude that, compared to the basolateral membrane, the apical border of crypt colonocytes has a very low permeability-area product for NH 3 /NH 4 +. This barrier may represent an important adaptation for the survival of <b>crypt</b> <b>cells</b> in the environment of the colon...|$|R
