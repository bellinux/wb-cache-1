40|$|The Italian {{territory}} {{is characterized by}} a great number of <b>capable</b> <b>faults</b> (i. e., faults able to produce significant ruptures/deformations at or near the surface). However, the potential of tectonic surface rupture/deformation (Surface Faulting Hazard, SFH) is not properly considered in national seismic hazard maps and legislation.

The proposed assessment indicates where SFH is expected to be relevant. In this sense, it is an helpful tool for site selection of critical facilities but also for ordinary land planning. Of course, the evaluation of SFH at local scale in the setback areas requires a more detailed characterization through ad hoc seismotectonic and paleoseismic investigations...|$|R

40|$|In case of {{moderate}} to strong earthquakes (generally for M > 5. 5), coseismic slip along a fault can reach directly the ground surface and produce surface faulting. Although scarcely {{considered in the}} Italian legislation, surface faulting hazard can have a relevant societal impact because it exposes to substantial risk urban areas and/or important infrastructures, facilities and critical lifelines that are settled or planned in coincidence of an active and <b>capable</b> <b>fault</b> trace.

We observe a clear temporal and spatial link between our near-field record and InSAR, far-field GPS data, regional measurements from the Italian Strong Motion and National Seismic networks, and field measurements of surface ruptures. Comparison of these datasets illustrates that the observed surface ruptures are the propagation of slip from depth on a surface rupturing (i. e. <b>capable)</b> <b>fault</b> array, as a direct and immediate response to the 30 th October earthquake. Large near-field displacement ceased within 6 – 8 [*]seconds of the origin time, implying that shaking induced gravitational processes were not the primary driving mechanism.

Coseismic surface ruptures were mapped for a minimum distance of 2. 6 km along the Paganica fault, a fault still poorly investigated relative to the other active faults nearby, which bound much wider range fronts. Surface rupture length (SRL) and maximum displacement parameters (2. 6 km minimum and 10 – 15 cm, respectively) are in agreement with what is expected for an Mw 6. 3 event in the Italian Apennines tectonic environment. Different viewpoints exist on the amount of SRL and the number of activated faults. We propose a pattern of sympathetic and secondary slip on an array of faults around the master seismogenic structure. Past seismicity and evidence for larger Holocene offsets on this and other <b>capable</b> <b>faults</b> nearby prove that the 2009 event is not a good reference event for assessing the seismic hazard of the region. Nevertheless, the 2009 L’Aquila earthquake once more confirmed the importance of detailed geological studies for a proper seismic hazard assessment, and it clearly illustrates the need to pay attention to moderate events and supposedly minor active faults. Indeed, this type of earthquake is rather frequent in the whole Mediterranean region and is potentially much more destructive than in the past, due to the expanding urban centers and infrastructures inside their epicentral regions and even right above the traces of <b>capable</b> <b>faults...</b>|$|R

40|$|On 6 th April 2009, a {{moderate}} earthquake (Mw = 6. 3; Ml= 5. 8) struck the Abruzzo region in Central Italy, causing more than 300 fatalities and heavy damage to L'Aquila and surrounding villages. Coseismic surface effects have been thoroughly documented by timely field surveys {{as well as}} by remote sensing analyses of satellite images. The outstanding quality of geological, seismological, geodetic and InSAR information, arguably represents the best ever dataset made available immediately after {{a moderate}} seismic event. Based on this dataset, we aim at testing the capability of coupled geological and InSAR data to map surface faulting patterns associated with moderate earthquakes. Coseismic ground ruptures have been mapped at a scale of 1 : 500 in the whole epicentral area. Traces of surface ruptures have been inferred from linear phase discontinuities identified in the interferogram. A very good agreement between the two methods resulted in the characterization of the main surface rupture along the Paganica fault. The same approach applied to ground ruptures hypothesized along other <b>capable</b> <b>fault</b> segments provided more questionable results. Thus, the combined field and InSAR approach appeared useful for detecting continuous surface ruptures exceeding one km in length and showing displacements greater than a few cm. These are the typical faulting parameters for moderate earthquakes (6. 0 < Mw < 6. 5) in Central Apennines. For continuous ground cracks shorter than a few hundred meters and/or show displacements smaller than 1 - 2 cm, the described approach may be less helpful, most probably due to the limited resolution of the data...|$|E

The main goal of the survey was the shallow (i. e. first 150 m) seismic imaging of the subsurface of this area. Four High Resolution (HR) seismic reflection/refraction profiles (total length about 1500 m) were acquired using an array of receivers consisting of 96 / 72 channels with a Swept Impact Seismic Source (VibSist- 500). Seismic studies were integrated with MASW and MAM analysis and n. 8 Horizontal to Vertical Spectra Ratio (HVSR) investigation.

The epicentre was located near the town of Basantkot (Muzaffarabad), and the focal depth was about 13 km. The Muzaffarabad earthquake provides unequivocal evidence about the localization of severe damage, intense ground shaking and secondary environmental effects near the surface expression of the source fault. We analyse its nature, and impact on man-made structures and the physical environment, on the basis of a detailed survey and macroseismic study of the affected areas conducted by the Micro Seismic Studies Programme (MSSP) Team (Ishfaq Ahmad Research Laboratories, Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission) immediately after the mainshock, assisted by a careful review of the subsequent data and literature. In the course of the field survey, the displacement and surface expression of the causative fault, and accompanying secondary environmental effects were observed at a number of places along a capable thrust fault structure. We refer to this structure as the Kashmir Thrust (KT) <b>capable</b> <b>fault</b> following the terminology of local research geologists in Pakistan; the seismological evidence of this structure is already known in the literature as the Indus-Kohistan Seismic Zone. A complex, clearly segmented, at least 112 -km-long surface rupture was mapped along the KT. The maximum values of vertical displacement (on the order of 4 to 7 m) were observed mainly between Muzaffarabad and Balakot, along the central segment of the rupture (52 km) associated with maximum slip at depth and a major portion of the energy release. Both the NW Alai segment (38 km) and SE Bagh segment (22 km) are characterized by scattered minor surface ruptures with a few centimetres of displacement, accompanied by extensive surface cracking, landslides and severe damage, concentrated in a narrow belt along the fault trace. A maximum intensity of XI on the Modified Mercalli Intensity (MMI) scale and on the Environmental Seismic Intensity scale (ESI 2007) was recorded in the epicentral area between Muzaffarabad and Balakot. Extremely severe damage and very important secondary environmental effects in the hanging wall adjacent to the trace of the causative fault plane are mainly due to near-fault strong motion and rupture directivity effects.

We summarize the procedure {{that is currently}} used to characterize earthquake rupture models for the prediction of ground motions, based on geological investigations of <b>capable</b> earthquake <b>faults</b> and seismological studies of source models. Total fault lengths of scenario earthquake would be evaluated from survey of segmentation and grouping of active faults for a long-term prediction of seismic activity. The fault widths are evaluated based on the thickness of seismogenic zones from the cut-off depth of small earthquakes. The seismic moment of the <b>capable</b> <b>faults</b> are estimated by the empirical relationship between the source areas and seismic source, then average slips are automatically constraint from the seismic moment and source area. The scaling relations of modeling slip heterogeneity constructed based on a statistical analysis of the source inversion of crustal earthquakes ranging from about 6 to 7 in moment magnitude(Mw) (Somerville et al., 1999). We use a set of parameters to quantify in a deterministic manner the distribution of asperities satisfying the heterogeneity of slip on the fault surface and its two-dimensional Fourier transform of the k-squared model by Herrero and Barnard(1994).

The W sector of the foredeep represents in particular the area with most controversial interpretation in terms of active tectonics and seismic potential. For instance, in the ITHACA catalogue of <b>capable</b> <b>faults</b> the Monferrato Arc {{is regarded as a}} seismogenic structure with potential for surface faulting earthquakes; while in the DISS database the W Lombardia and Piemonte are essentially interpreted as areas lacking any evidence of active faulting and seismic sources with Mw > 5. 5. In order to attack this issue, we conducted field investigation, geomorphic analyses and the revision of the large existing database of seismic reflection profiles covering the study area in order to assess the seismic landscape of the Monferrato Arc. Our investigations confirm that the Late Quaternary landscape evolution of the South-Central Piemonte {{is the result of the}} interaction between active tectonics and widespread phenomena of river avulsion and piracy, which affected virtually the whole Piemonte and nearby Liguria region. In fact, these dramatic changes in the regional drainage network are controlled by shortening and thrust fault growth, which started during Oligo-Miocene times and is still active with visible deformation rates (Carraro et al., 1995). The development of the Apennines buried thrust fronts since Miocene give rise to the progressive uplift of the Monferrato and Torino Hills, translated above the depositional sequences of the Po Plain foredeep. The continuing deformation and displacement of the surficial deposits up to at least the Mid Pleistocene allow us to regard the buried structures of the Monferrato Arc as potentially <b>capable</b> <b>faults</b> (IAEA, 2010). Therefore, based on the available data, the regional seismotectonic framework for the W Po Plain is comparable with the one already recognized in the Emilia Arc or in the LombardiaVeneto S Alps (Modena 2012, Brescia 1222, Verona 1117).

EPR design certification {{will investigate}} site-specific surface and subsurface geologic, seismic, geophysical, and geotechnical aspects within 25 miles around {{the site and}} evaluate any impact to the design. The COL applicant will demonstrate that no <b>capable</b> <b>faults</b> exist at the site {{in accordance with the}} requirements of 10 CFR 100. 23 and of 10 CFR 50, Appendix S. If non-capable surface faulting is present under foundations for safety-related structures, the COL applicant will demonstrate that the faults have no significant impact on the structural integrity of safety-related structures, systems or components. This COL Item is addressed as follows: {This section provides information about site-specific field and literature studies of the potential for faults or other tectonic features (including evidence of paleoliquefaction and prehistoric major earthquakes) that have the potential to affect operation of Callaway Plant Unit 2. Results of the investigations indicate that {{there is no evidence of}} Quaternary tectonic surface faulting or fold deformation and there are no capable tectonic sources within a 25 mile (40 km) radius of the Callaway Plant Unit 2 Site. In addition, no non-capable surface faulting has been identified under or near the foundations for safety-related structures. Information contained in these sections was developed in accordance with RG 1. 208 (NRC, 2006), and is intended to satisfy 10 CFR 100. 23, “Geologic and seismic siting criteria ” (CFR, 2007 a) an...|$|R

40|$|Recognition of coseismic and aseismic slip in trench {{exposures}} is a {{major goal}} in paleoseismology. To define stratigraphic criteria for discriminating between (I) fast earthquake-related slip and (2) slow quasi-continuous creep, we carried out several exploratory trenches along the eastern flank of Mt. Etna, where <b>capable</b> <b>faults</b> (active fault. producing displacement {{at or near the}} surface) show both modes of movements with high slip rates and short recurrence intervals. Our sites have experienced predominant coseismic (Fondo Macchia) and aseismic (Mandra del Re) fault slip during histori cal times. At the Fondo Macchia site we trenched a normal fault scarp where - 20 em of vertical olTsetoccurred in 1971 and three other similar earthquakes repeated in the past 150 yr. Several erosional surfaces close to the fault zone in the footwall indicate that (1) a distinct and recognizable fault scarp free face retreated repeatedly, shaped byerosion and fault activity, and (2) the observed vertical displacement is a result of repeated scarp-forming earthquakes. At the Mandra del Re site a left-lateral, strike-slip fault with a large vertical component dams the drainage of a small valley. Avertical fault slip rate of - 2 cmlyr and consequent high deposition rates of ponded, mainly well-layered, fine-grained sediments allow to reconstruct with excellent stratigraphic resolution the fault growth in the past few centuries. More than 3 m of vertical displacement has accumulated in the fault zone, leaving no indication of scarp-related erosion in the footwall deposits or of colluvial wedges in the hanging wall. This unequivocal stratigraphic evidence of "aseismites" (i. e., sedimentary features and relations generated by continuous fault creep) shows that earthquake surface faulting and aseismic creep generate completely different sedimentary responses...|$|R

The use of artificial neural networks {{to provide a}} method of detecting and isolating impending failures in an autonomous underwater vehivle propulsion system has been studied. Two types of fault diagnostic systems, each capable of detecting different kinds of faults, were designed. The first system addresses the fault identification proces {{by looking at the}} raw data available from system sensors. The second design processes sensor data with a Kalman filter before it is input to a neural network. The Kalman filter was designed to identify system parameters that characterize its dynamic response. These parameters serve as input to the network.

30|$|A {{variety of}} fault-isolation and system-recovery schemes have been proposed. They can be broadly {{divided into two}} {{technical}} routes. One is based on converters incapable of fault current interruption and DC breakers (DCBs) [12, 13, 14, 15]. Fault isolation and system recovery are mainly realized by the fast operation of the corresponding DCBs. The other is based on converters <b>capable</b> of <b>fault</b> current interruption [16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21] and an ultrafast mechanical switch (UMS). The fault current is first interrupted by converters. Then the fault section is isolated by the UMS. System recovery is achieved by their coordinated operation. The former route {{appears to be more}} competitive for the VSC-based DC grid in regards to the continuous and reliable transmission of active power.|$|R
