5|$|Although Timberlake {{expressed}} interest in recording songs with rock influences, Timbaland was initially reluctant to pursue the idea {{because he was not}} accustomed to producing such music. Nonetheless, he suggested that they <b>could</b> <b>produce</b> <b>a</b> handful, since they were afraid of alienating Timberlake's urban fan base. Because of this concern, they produced several reprises, encores and preludes with a rock influence, instead of full-length songs.|$|E
5|$|The Mellotron {{was used}} by German {{electronic}} band Tangerine Dream through the 1970s, on albums such as Atem (1973), Phaedra (1974), Rubycon (1975), Stratosfear (1976), and Encore (1977). In 1983, the band's Christopher Franke asked Mellotronics if they <b>could</b> <b>produce</b> <b>a</b> digital model, as the group migrated towards using samplers.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the most}} {{critically}} acclaimed bootlegs from the 1980s is The Black Album by Prince. The album {{was to have been}} a conventional major-label release in late 1987, but on 1 December, immediately before release, Prince decided to pull the album, requiring 500,000 copies to be destroyed. A few advance copies had already shipped, which were used to create bootlegs. This eventually led to the album's official release. Towards the end of the 1980s, the Ultra Rare Trax series of bootlegs, featuring studio outtakes of the Beatles, showed that digital remastering onto compact disc <b>could</b> <b>produce</b> <b>a</b> high-quality product that was comparable with official studio releases.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{being more}} powerfully built than other large cats, Smilodon had a weaker bite. Modern big cats have more {{pronounced}} zygomatic arches, while these were smaller in Smilodon, which restricted the thickness and therefore {{power of the}} temporalis muscles and thus reduced Smilodons bite force. Analysis of its narrow jaws indicates that it <b>could</b> <b>produce</b> <b>a</b> bite only a third as strong {{as that of a}} lion. There seems to be a general rule that the saber-toothed cats with the largest canines had proportionally weaker bites. Analyses of canine bending strength (the ability of the canine teeth to resist bending forces without breaking) and bite forces indicate that the saber-toothed cats' teeth were stronger relative to the bite force than those of modern big cats. In addition, Smilodons gape could have reached almost 120 degrees, while that of the modern lion reaches 65 degrees. This made the gape wide enough to allow Smilodon to grasp large prey despite the long canines.|$|E
5|$|Other notable {{performances}} {{came from}} Berger, {{who took the}} final podium position despite being delayed {{during one of his}} routine pit stops due to a problem with a loose wheel nut; Mika Häkkinen, who finished fourth for the McLaren team despite its new car proving to be uncompetitive in pre-season testing; and Mika Salo, who drove strongly {{in the first half of}} the race to run third in his first Grand Prix for the Tyrrell team, only to suffer from a cramp and drop back to seventh place at the finish. Behind Häkkinen, the other points-scoring finishers were Jean Alesi in the second Ferrari and Mark Blundell, who drove the second McLaren. Blundell was standing in for regular driver Nigel Mansell in the second McLaren until the team <b>could</b> <b>produce</b> <b>a</b> wider chassis in which to accommodate him, as the car's initial cockpit design had proved to be too narrow for him to drive comfortably.|$|E
5|$|Various {{methods were}} used to build mottes. Where a natural hill could be used, scarping <b>could</b> <b>produce</b> <b>a</b> motte without the need to create an {{artificial}} mound, but more commonly much of the motte {{would have to be}} constructed by hand. Four methods existed for building a mound and a tower: the mound could either be built first, and a tower placed on top of it; the tower could alternatively be built on the original ground surface and then buried within the mound; the tower could potentially be built on the original ground surface and then partially buried within the mound, the buried part forming a cellar beneath; or the tower could be built first, and the mound added later.|$|E
50|$|Renault {{manufactured}} the Dauphine at its Flins factory, {{with a car}} {{leaving the}} assembly line every 20-30 seconds, and with engines from the company's headquarters factory on Île Seguin in Billancourt, Paris.

5|$|The MAUD {{reports were}} {{reviewed}} by the Defence Services Panel of the Scientific Advisory Committee. This was chaired by Lord Hankey, with its other members being Sir Edward Appleton, Sir Henry Dale, Alfred Egerton, Archibald Hill and Edward Mellanby. The panel held seven meetings in September 1941, and submitted its report to the Lord President of the Council, Sir John Anderson. At this point it was feared that German scientists were attempting to provide their country with an atomic bomb, and thus Britain needed to finish its first. The report ultimately stated {{that if there were}} even a sliver of a chance that the bomb effort <b>could</b> <b>produce</b> <b>a</b> weapon with such power, then every effort should be made to make sure Britain did not fall behind. It recommended that while a pilot separation plant be built in Britain, the production facility should be built in Canada. The Defence Services Panel submitted its report on 24 September 1941, but by this time the final decision had already been taken. Lord Cherwell had taken the matter to the Prime Minister, Winston Churchill, who became the first national leader to approve a nuclear weapons programme on 30 August 1941. The Chiefs of Staff Committee supported the decision.|$|E

25|$|Shortly after Governor Rod Blagojevich's {{arrest on}} federal {{corruption}} charges on December 9, 2008, Durbin {{called for the}} Illinois legislature to quickly pass legislation for a special election to fill then President-elect Barack Obama's vacant Senate seat.

25|$|Several {{spacecraft}} (Mariner 10, Pioneer 11, and Voyagers 1 and 2) {{had performed}} gravity assist manoeuvres in the 1970s. Those manoeuvres were to reach other planets also orbiting {{close to the}} ecliptic, so they were mostly in-plane changes. However, gravity assists {{are not limited to}} in-plane maneuvers; a suitable flyby of Jupiter <b>could</b> <b>produce</b> <b>a</b> significant plane change. An Out-Of-The-Ecliptic mission (OOE) was thereby proposed. See article Pioneer H.|$|E
25|$|A few of {{the dark}} matter {{particles}} passing through the Sun or Earth may scatter off atoms and lose energy. Thus dark matter may accumulate {{at the center of}} these bodies, increasing the chance of collision/annihilation. This <b>could</b> <b>produce</b> <b>a</b> distinctive signal in the form of high-energy neutrinos. Such a signal would be strong indirect proof of WIMP dark matter. High-energy neutrino telescopes such as AMANDA, IceCube and ANTARES are searching for this signal.|$|E

25|$|Hayes {{next project}} came about as an {{approach}} from Colin Chapman. Chapman's cars had {{until that point}} relied on power from fast revving Coventry Climax engines, but with the change in Formula One regulations to three litre capacity from 1966, Coventry Climax decided for business reasons not to develop a large capacity engine.

25|$|Slave {{breeding}} in the United States includes any {{practice of}} slave ownership that aimed to systematically influence {{the reproduction of}} slaves {{in order to increase}} the wealth of slaveholders. Slave breeding included coerced sexual relations between male and female slaves, promoting pregnancies of slaves, and favoring female slaves who <b>could</b> <b>produce</b> <b>a</b> relatively large number of children. The purpose of slave breeding was to acquire new slaves without incurring the cost of purchase, and to fill labor shortages caused by the termination of the Atlantic slave trade.|$|E
25|$|The Garibaldi Volcanic Belt (GVB) has a {{long history}} of eruptions and poses a threat to the {{surrounding}} region.
