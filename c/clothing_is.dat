5|$|The {{indigenous}} raffia {{plant was}} the base fiber for the clothing traditionally {{worn by the}} Betsimisaraka.

Among the various peoples who united under the Betsimisaraka confederation, women wore a short wrapper (simbo), typically with a bandeau top (akanjo), while men wore smocks. Traditional raffia <b>clothing</b> <b>is</b> still worn by some Betsimisaraka today.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. We {{tried to}} {{simulate}} human bodily movements {{to put on}} <b>clothing.</b> This <b>is</b> a combination of mechanical clothing simulation and measurement of bodily movements. A vest was modeled as virtual clothing because of its simple structure. Paper patterns were scanned and from the obtained images, virtual component panels of <b>clothing</b> <b>were</b> created. A model of <b>clothing</b> <b>was</b> con-structed to seam virtually different component panels. The bodily movements to put on <b>clothing</b> <b>were</b> measured by a motion capture system. A virtual human model was moved according to the measured data of the movements. First, {{the shape of a}} vest in stable state hanging in the air was calculated, human body model was started to move, then the shape of the vest was calculated in every step of the movements. The movements to put on <b>clothing</b> <b>were</b> reproduced with the simulation...|$|R

The average infantryman may have had his uniform made for him in Richmond, Virginia, however, the man enlisted in Georgia, and is now marching through the former state. In {{reflection}} to his loyalties to home, this man, for example, could have adorned his uniform with Georgia State buttons. This would indicate to his fellow soldiers his allegiance to both his state and his military unit. This was common practice during the war for {{both sides in the}} conflict.|$|E
5|$|Chinese Ming style {{clothing}} was forced on Vietnamese {{people by the}} Nguyễn dynasty. The tunics and trouser clothing of the Han Chinese on the Ming and Qing tradition was worn by the Vietnamese. However, Han-Chinese <b>clothing</b> <b>is</b> assembled by several pieces of clothing including both pants and skirts called Qun (裙) or chang (裳) which {{is a part of}} Hanfu garments throughout the history of Han Chinese clothing. The Ao Dai was created when tucks which were close fitting and compact were added in the 1920s to this Chinese style. The Chinese clothing in the form of trousers and tunic were mandated by the Vietnamese Nguyen government. It was up to the 1920s in Vietnam's north area in isolated hamlets where skirts were worn. The Chinese Ming dynasty, Tang dynasty, and Han dynasty {{clothing was}} referred to be adopted by Vietnamese military and bureaucrats by the Nguyen Lord Nguyễn Phúc Khoát (Nguyen The Tong). Chinese clothing started influencing Vietnamese dress in the Ly dynasty. The current Ao Dai was introduced by the Nguyen Lords.|$|E
5|$|Mercury {{and most}} of its {{compounds}} are extremely toxic and must be handled with care; in cases of spills involving mercury (such as from certain thermometers or fluorescent light bulbs), specific cleaning procedures are used to avoid exposure and contain the spill. Protocols call for physically merging smaller droplets on hard surfaces, combining them into a single larger pool for easier removal with an eyedropper, or for gently pushing the spill into a disposable container. Vacuum cleaners and brooms cause greater dispersal of the mercury and should not be used. Afterwards, fine sulfur, zinc, or some other powder that readily forms an amalgam (alloy) with mercury at ordinary temperatures is sprinkled over the area before itself being collected and properly disposed of. Cleaning porous surfaces and <b>clothing</b> <b>is</b> not effective at removing all traces of mercury and it is therefore advised to discard these kinds of items should they be exposed to a mercury spill.|$|E

40|$|Key words: fitting; bias {{structure}} lines; pattern; construction; comfort. Abstract. In {{terms of}} clothing silhouette, {{the design of}} structure lines for fitting <b>clothing</b> <b>were</b> studied, and the feasibility of reconstruction of <b>clothing</b> <b>was</b> discussed, which aimed at combining functionality and decoration to incarnate the creativity in structure design[1]. Bias structure lines used in fitting <b>clothing</b> bodice <b>were</b> chosen to study in this thesis. The bodice of fitting <b>clothing</b> <b>was</b> studied in structure, shape and relationship with wearer from aspects of patterns, production, appearance and comfort. The following conclusions could be drawn: bias structure lines {{could be used to}} reconstruct bodice of fitting clothing, and had easy construction, less fabric, good comfort and appearance...|$|R

5|$|Interviewed by Wallace, McHenry admits being angry after {{discovering}} his girlfriend's infidelity but denies {{that the blood}} on his <b>clothing</b> <b>is</b> hers. Montgomery tries to convince King to report her rape; King refuses, telling Montgomery {{that she does not}} understand {{what it is like to}} be raped. Wilder uses alternative medicine to help King deal with her pain. Psychiatrist Violet Turner (Amy Brenneman) refuses to talk to King about the rape because of similarities to the fetal abduction she experienced a year earlier, and wonders if everyone in the practice is cursed. Bennett wants to go home and rest, which angers Montgomery. King attempts to compose a memorandum saying that she was attacked on the hospital grounds, but Freedman suggests that another member of the staff do it for her; she shouts at Freedman when he calls her a victim. After the argument, Freedman goes to King's office and weeps when he sees the aftermath of her assault. McHenry admits raping a woman, assaulting Wallace before he is pulled away by the police. In the ambulance bay, Bennett expresses his confusion about Montgomery's mood swings and suspects that she is hiding something from him; Montgomery asks him to promise never to leave her alone. After Freedman helps her dress, King says that she loves him and wants to go home. McHenry is held by the police for assaulting a police officer during his arrest and Wallace during his interrogation, but detective Joe Price says that McHenry cannot be charged with rape until charges are filed against him. The episode ends with King walking out of the hospital with Freedman's help; flashbacks of the rape reveal that McHenry was the rapist.|$|E
