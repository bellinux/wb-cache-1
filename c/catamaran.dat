5|$|Fast Ferries service began {{initially}} with {{a single}} boat, the 118-passenger Rich Passage 1, in 2017. The vessel is a <b>catamaran</b> designed to create a very low wake while operating at high speeds by employing a special foil. A second boat of a similar design is planned {{be added to the}} Bremerton route in 2019. The agency's plans call for the purchase of a 150-passenger <b>catamaran</b> for delivery in 2018, two 250-passenger bow loading catamarans for delivery in 2020 and 2021, and an additional 118-passenger high-speed, low-wake <b>catamaran</b> to be delivered in 2022.|$|E
5|$|In 1975, {{the first}} {{practical}} solar boat {{was constructed in}} England. By 1995, passenger boats incorporating PV panels began appearing and are now used extensively. In 1996, Kenichi Horie made the first solar-powered crossing of the Pacific Ocean, and the Sun21 <b>catamaran</b> made the first solar-powered crossing of the Atlantic Ocean {{in the winter of}} 2006–2007. There were plans to circumnavigate the globe in 2010.|$|E
5|$|Several ferry {{services}} {{run from}} docks on Ferry Street {{just north of}} the station. The Cross Sound Ferry runs to Orient Point on Long Island with approximately hourly service year-round. The Block Island Fast Ferry, a high-speed <b>catamaran</b> to Block Island, runs several daily round trips during the summer months. The Fishers Island Ferry offers year-round local service to Fisher's Island, about 5 miles offshore, with multiple daily trips.|$|E

5|$|The school {{operates}} the F.G. Walton Smith research vessel. Designed to met the school's specifications, the <b>catamaran</b> {{was put on}} water in 2000. It {{is equipped with a}} special sea water flow system that can take samples. The on-board lab can perform chemical analysis of those water samples. It also has transducers for measuring ocean currents, sub-bottom profiling, and deep water bathymetry. In response to the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, the vessel was reassigned to environmental monitoring of affected areas and to track underwater plumes of oil.|$|E
5|$|At the store, SpongeBob and Patrick {{find the}} crown, but are nearly killed when the diver {{attempts}} to dry them out using a heat lamp. Their tears short-circuit the lamp's power cord, and its smoke activates the sprinkler system, reviving {{their bodies and}} the other dried sea creatures intended to be sold as souvenirs. As the sea creatures attack the diver, SpongeBob and Patrick take the crown {{and head for the}} beach. Patrick inadvertently loses the Bag of Winds while attempting to use it, but David Hasselhoff appears and offers them a ride; Dennis catches up to them but is knocked by a <b>catamaran</b> back into the sea. Hasselhoff opens up his rocket launching pecs to shoot SpongeBob and Patrick back to Bikini Bottom with the crown.|$|E
5|$|British Waterways {{introduced}} a similar system in September 1974. Called BACAT, for Barges Aboard <b>Catamaran,</b> the system consisted of trains of barges, which were pushed by a tug, and {{which would be}} loaded between the twin hulls of a custom-built delivery ship. The ship would then transport them across the North Sea to continental waterways, without their contents having to be transshipped. The concept failed after 18 months, as the dock workers at Hull blacklisted the entire British Waterways fleet, because {{they believed that the}} system would threaten their jobs. Most of the commercial traffic using the navigation now consists of petroleum tankers and gravel barges.|$|E

40|$|In {{this work}} {{the problem of}} {{slamming}} on the cross structure of <b>catamarans</b> is studied. An introduction and overview {{of the problem is}} given. Methods for predicting the slamming occurrence of high-speed power <b>catamarans</b> and sailing <b>catamarans</b> are presented. Emphasis is placed ondeveloping methods that are practical to use in order to facilitate prediction of slamming occurrence at the design stage. The methods used consist of three steps: Ship motion prediction, slamming identification and slamming pressurecalculations. Existing linear and non-linear ship motion prediction theories are used for high-speed power <b>catamarans</b> while a new strip theory has been developed specifically for motion prediction of sailing multihulls. Predicted shipmotion results are compared to full-scale experiments, both for high-speed powercatamarans and sailing <b>catamarans.</b> A new direct method for identification of slamming occurrence in the time domain is presented, as well as results using probabilistic methods. A comparison between the two methods is presented. Slamming pressure calculations are done using an existing two dimensional slamming theory and are compared with analytical results. A parametric study is done on two case study ships to investigate the effect of various hullformparameters on the slamming occurrence. The methods and results presented are of use to designers of high-speed power <b>catamarans</b> and sailing <b>catamarans...</b>|$|R
50|$|Small sailing <b>catamarans</b> {{are also}} called beach <b>catamarans.</b> The most {{recognized}} racing classes are the Hobie Cat 16, Formula 18 cats, A-cats, the current Olympic Nacra 17, the former Olympic multihull Tornado and New Zealand's Weta trimaran.|$|R
5|$|Simpson {{was killed}} on 9 May 2013, during {{training}} for the 34th America's Cup, when the Swedish Artemis Racing team yacht he was aboard capsized near Treasure Island in San Francisco Bay. The yacht, a 72-foot <b>catamaran</b> with a rigid, wing-like sail, was turning downwind and bearing away when it flipped over and broke into pieces. Simpson was trapped underneath its hulls for approximately ten minutes, and attempts to revive him by doctors afloat and subsequently ashore were unsuccessful. The cause of the accident is unknown. An investigation was initiated by the United States Coast Guard which involved San Francisco police and the America's Cup management.|$|E
5|$|Five {{individuals}} died in maritime {{accidents involving}} {{at least one}} <b>catamaran.</b> There was an accident involving a bus carrying evacuees, killing four people on board. Three people died on the offshore Ambergris Caye. Overall, 19 people perished in the country. Several injuries, mainly from flying debris, were reported in San Pedro, and there were 142 people who were injured in the storm. Throughout the country, approximately 3,279 homes were either damaged or destroyed. The damage total from Keith was initially estimated at $200 million, about half of which to tourism facilities; the remainder was roughly split between crop and infrastructure damage. About 75% of the crops in the country were damaged, including much of the corn harvest that was expected to begin in October. The damage total was later estimated at $280 million, most {{of it on the}} offshore Ambergris Cay and Caye Caulker.|$|E
5|$|Sheerness' {{sand and}} shingle beach {{was awarded a}} European Blue Flag for {{cleanliness}} and safety. Flower gardens decorate the seafront, and a sea wall forms a promenade along the coast. The Sheppey Leisure Complex located near the beach contains a swimming pool and badminton, squash and tennis courts. Other sports clubs include Sheerness Town Bowls Club, Sheerness East Cricket Club, the Isle of Sheppey Sailing Club, Beachfields Skatepark, Sheerness East Table Tennis Club, <b>Catamaran</b> Yacht Club, and Sheerness Swimming Club and Lifeguard Corps. Sheerness Golf Club was founded in 1906, and has an 18-hole course just to the south-east of town. Sheerness East Football Club, established in 1932, play in the Kent County League Premier Division. Sports can be played for free at the town's recreation grounds at Beachfields Park, Festival Playing Field, and Seager Road Sports Ground.|$|E
50|$|<b>Catamarans</b> are {{the most}} common type, with two {{symmetric}} hulls. They are used as racing, sailing, tourist and fishing boats. About 70% of fast passenger and car-passenger ferries are <b>catamarans.</b> About 300 semi-submersible drilling and auxiliary platforms operate at sea.|$|R
50|$|The first {{generation}} Westamaran <b>catamarans</b> {{were not as}} quick as the competing hydrofoils, but their capacity was larger, maintenance easier, and they were more comfortable. The second generation <b>catamarans,</b> with symmetrical hulls, matched the hydrofoils in speed, reaching 35-40 knots.|$|R

5|$|To {{handle this}} new, {{considerably}} {{more complex and}} expensive task, {{it was decided that}} a new organisation was needed. The Mary Rose Trust, a limited charitable trust, with representatives from many organisations would handle the need for a larger operation and a large infusion of funds. In 1979 a new diving vessel was purchased to replace the previous 12m (40ft) <b>catamaran</b> Roger Greenville which had been used from 1971. The choice fell on the salvage vessel Sleipner, the same craft that had been used as a platform for diving operations on the Vasa. The project went from a team of only twelve volunteers working four months a year to over 50 individuals working almost around the clock nine months a year. In addition there were over 500 volunteer divers and a laboratory staff of about 70 that ran the shore base and conservation facilities. During the four diving seasons from 1979 to 1982 over 22,000 diving hours was spent on the site, an effort that amounted to 11.8 man-years.|$|E
25|$|The Tornado <b>catamaran</b> was {{designed}} by three Englishmen for a crew of two in 1967 as an Olympic <b>catamaran</b> candidate. At the Olympic <b>Catamaran</b> Trials of the International Yacht Racing Union, IYRU, it outperformed the other challengers for the role and was selected for the multihull discipline in the Olympic Games from 1976 through 2008. It was redesigned in 2000 and {{remains one of the}} fastest double-handed <b>catamaran</b> models.|$|E
25|$|Catamarans rely {{primarily}} on form stability to resist heeling and capsize. Comparison of heeling stability of a rectangular-cross section monohull of beam, B, compared with two <b>catamaran</b> hulls of width B/2, {{separated by a}} distance, 2×B, determines that the <b>catamaran</b> has an initial resistance to heeling that is seven {{times that of the}} monohull. Compared with a monohull, a cruising <b>catamaran</b> sailboat has a high initial resistance to heeling and capsize—a fifty-footer requires four times the force to initiate a capsize than an equivalent monohull.|$|E
25|$|Sailing <b>catamarans</b> {{have been}} noted for {{incorporating}} technological advances over traditional monohull craft. These include foils that lift racing <b>catamarans</b> out of the water, capacious and stable cruising vessels, and racers that have achieved average speeds on the open ocean, comparable to much larger vessels.|$|R
