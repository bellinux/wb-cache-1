In SDR, a set of automatically transcribed speech documents <b>constitutes</b> the <b>files</b> for retrieval, to which a user may address a request in natural language. This article deals with two probabilistic aspects in SDR. The first part investigates the effect of recognition errors on retrieval performance and inquires the question, why recognition errors have only a little effect on the retrieval performance. In the second part, we present a new probabilistic approach to SDR that is based on interpolations between document representations. Experiments performed on the TREC- 7 and TREC- 8 SDR task show comparable or even better results for the new proposed method than other advanced heuristic and probabilistic retrieval metrics...|$|R

Each {{data file}} is denoted as a MHT (the leaf nodes <b>constitute</b> the data <b>file),</b> and the server first {{asks for a}} random subset of the MHT leaf nodes from the client.

That is, a user that only knows only the hash signature of a file cannot convince the cloud server that he owns that file. Di Pietro and Sorniotti [18] proposed an efficient PoW scheme, in which each challenge is a seed for a pseudorandom generator and the response is the set of values in the file at bit positions derived by the generator from the seed. Every time a file is uploaded to the server, the latter computes a set of challenges for that file and stores them for a later check. Alís et al.

40|$|Abstract. Computer log <b>files</b> <b>constitute</b> a {{precious}} resource for system administrators for discov-ering and comprehending security breaches. A prerequisite of any meaningful log analysis is that attempts of intruders {{to cover their}} traces by modifying log entries are thwarted by storing them in a tamper-resistant manner. Some solutions employ cryptographic authentication when storing log entries locally, and let the authentication scheme’s property of forward security ensure that the cryptographic keys {{in place at the}} time of intrusion cannot be used to manipulate past log entries without detection. This strong notion of security is typically achieved through frequent updates of the authentication keys via hash chains. However, as security demands that key updates take place rather often (ideally, at a resolution of milliseconds), in many settings this method quickly reaches the limits of practicality. Indeed, a log auditor aiming at verifying a specific log record might have to compute millions of hash iterations before recovering the correct verification key. This problem was addressed only recently by the introduction of seekable sequential key genera-tors (SSKG). Every instance of this cryptographic primitive produces a forward-secure sequence of symmetric (authentication) keys, but also offers an explicit fast-forward functionality. The only currently known SSKG construction replaces traditional hash chains by the iterated evaluation o...|$|R
