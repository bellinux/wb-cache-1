Waters invoked non-being or non-existence in The Wall, with the lyrics to [...] "Comfortably Numb": [...] "I caught a fleeting glimpse, out of the <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> eye. I turned to look, but it was gone, I cannot {{put my finger on}} it now, the child is grown, the dream is gone." [...] Barrett referred to non-being in his final contribution to the band's catalogue, [...] "Jugband Blues": [...] "I'm most obliged to you for making it clear that I'm not here." ...|$|E
500|$|According to {{the sheet}} music {{published}} by Sony/ATV Music Publishing, [...] "You and I" [...] {{is set in}} common time with a slow tempo of 60 beats per minute. It is written in the key of A major. During the song Gaga's voice spans from the notes of E3 to C5. The song begins with an A–G–A chord progression, which changes to A–Bm/A–D/A–Bm during the chorus, {{and back to the}} former chords afterwards. The opening lyrics—"It's {{been a long time since}} I came around/ It's been a long time, but I'm back in town/ And this time, I'm not leaving without you"—describe a whiskey-breathed lover for whom she is pining. Gil Kaufman of MTV News described it as the [...] "tune eschewed most of her dance flavor, right down to a rollicking barrel-house piano solo." [...] Her voice sounded like growling during the main verses, where she sings the lines: [...] "He said, 'Sit back down where you belong, in the <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> bar with your high heels on, Sit back down on the couch where we made love the first time..." [...] Noting the differences between live performances of the song and the studio version, Neil McCormick of The Daily Telegraph observed that the piano parts were replaced mostly by [...] "fizzing synths, a stomping beat sampled from [...] "We Will Rock You", thundering electric guitars and backing vocals stacked into shimmering choral walls." [...] Kitty Empire of The Guardian described the song as an [...] "umlaut-toting digital country power ballad" [...] with two Bruce Springsteen references: [...] "born to run" [...] and Nebraska.|$|E

60|$|We tried {{a shorter}} kite-line and a shorter length <b>of</b> <b>my</b> line, and we ran down upon that mess of tuna once more. It was strange--and foolish--how we stuck to that school of biggest fish. This time Dan headed {{right into the}} thick of them. Out <b>of</b> the <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> eyes I seemed to see tuna {{settling}} down all around. Suddenly my brother yelled.|$|R
2500|$|On 30 July 1987, a {{day after}} Gandhi went to Sri Lanka and signed the Indo-Sri Lanka Accord, an honour guard named Vijitha Rohana hit him on his {{shoulder}} with his rifle; Gandhi's quick reflexes saved him from injury. The guard was then dragged by his security personnel. The guard said his intention was to kill Gandhi because of [...] "the damage he had caused" [...] to Sri Lanka. Wijemuni was imprisoned for two-and-a-half years for the assault Gandhi later said about the incident: When I was inspecting the guard of honour and as I walked past one person, I saw through the <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> eye some movement. I ducked {{down a little bit}} in a reflex action. By my ducking, he missed my head and the brunt of the blow came on my shoulder below the left ear.|$|E
2500|$|Edwardes {{purchased}} the lease of the Adelphi Theatre and began his productions there with another Monckton and Millar hit, The Quaker Girl, in 1910 ("The Quaker Girl", [...] "Come to the Ball", and [...] "Tony from America"). [...] For Courtneidge, he wrote The Mousmé in 1911 ("I Know Nothing of Life", [...] "The Little Japanese Mamma", [...] "The Temple Bell", and [...] "The <b>Corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>My</b> Eye") and for Edwardes and the Adelphi, he wrote The Dancing Mistress in 1912. [...] The latter two pieces had merely respectable runs. [...] Monckton's last big hit was The Boy in 1917 (produced after Edwardes's death), {{in collaboration with}} Howard Talbot. [...] This was a musical comedy version of Arthur Wing Pinero's 1885 play, The Magistrate, {{and served as a}} vehicle for the comedian W. H. Berry, who had been the star of High Jinks. [...] Monckton's successful songs included [...] "I Want to Go to Bye-Bye", [...] "The Game That Ends with a Kiss", and [...] "Powder on Your Nose".|$|E
2500|$|In her {{autobiography}} Cross Creek {{first published}} in 1942, Rawlings described how she owned many acres of land and also hired many people to help her with day-to-day chores and activities. An entire chapter {{of the book is}} dedicated to one woman she hired, whose name was Beatrice, but whom she was affectionately known as [...] "GeeChee", because the woman was ethnically part of the GeeChee people. In the book Rawlings said GeeChee's mother lived in nearby Hawthorne, Florida and GeeChee was blind in one eye from a fight she was involved in. GeeChee was employed by Rawlings on and off for nearly two years in which GeeChee dutifully made life easier for Rawlings. GeeChee revealed to Rawlings that her boyfriend named Leroy was serving time in prison for manslaughter, and asked Rawlings for help in gaining his release. She arranged for Leroy to be paroled to her and come work for her estate, and had a wedding on the grounds for Beatrice and Leroy. After a few weeks, Leroy aggressively demanded for more earnings from Rawlings and threatened her. She decided he had to leave, which caused her distress because she did not want GeeChee to go with him, and was sure she would. GeeChee eventually decided to stay with Rawlings, but GeeChee began to drink heavily and abandoned her. Weeks later, Rawlings went out searching for GeeChee and drove her back to her estate, describing GeeChee as a [...] "Black Florence Nightingale". GeeChee was unable to stop herself from drinking, which led a heartbroken Rawlings to dismiss her. Rawlings stated in her autobiography [...] "No maid of perfection--and now I have one--can fill the strange emptiness she left in a remote <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> heart. I think of her often, and I know she does of me, for she comes once a year to see me".|$|E
60|$|Upon one occasion, even, when woollen rags were scarce, and no burned-brick {{was to be}} {{had from}} the ship's Yeoman, I sacrificed the <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> woollen shirt, and used some dentrifice I had, as {{substitutes}} for the rags and burned-brick. The dentrifice operated delightfully, and made the threading <b>of</b> <b>my</b> carronade screw shine and grin again, like a set of false teeth in an eager heiress-hunter's mouth.|$|R
40|$|These {{poems are}} kidnapped scraps of {{conversation}} and memory, moments passed between women in bedrooms and kitchens and cemeteries, echoing up from pits of despair and the quietest <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> life. Scraps that lodged themselves {{in my mind}} till I {{had nothing to do}} but soak them in beer and blood and honey, wring them out, and stretch them taut across a wooden frame so that I could tap them gently to hear any songs they cared to play...|$|R
6000|$|The door opened, and M'Leod reappeared. I {{thanked him}} politely, saying I was charmed with my room, anxious to meet Mrs. M'Leod, much {{refreshed}} with my wash, {{and so on}} and so forth. Beyond a little stickiness at the <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> mouth, it seemed to me that I was managing my words admirably; the while that I myself cowered at the bottom of unclimbable pits. M'Leod laid his hand on my shoulder, and said [...] "You've got it now already, ain't it?" ...|$|R
60|$|I peeped {{round the}} <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> fan at Miss Melbury. She {{was looking at}} us. I shook hands with Mr. Sax.|$|E

60|$|Now {{he began}} to shave, digging his fingers into my countenance to stretch the skin and {{bundling}} and tumbling my head {{this way and that}} as convenience in shaving demanded. As long as he was on the tough sides <b>of</b> <b>my</b> face I did not suffer; but when {{he began to}} rake, and rip, and tug at my chin, the tears came. He now made a handle <b>of</b> <b>my</b> nose, to assist him shaving the <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> upper lip, and it was by this bit of circumstantial evidence that I discovered that a part of his duties in the shop was to clean the kerosene-lamps. I had often wondered in an indolent way whether the barbers did that, or whether it was the boss.|$|R
6000|$|... 'As to {{the other}} point, I require for my private {{happiness}} to have a true warm friend that would be ever at my hand, like my better angel; to whom I could communicate my nascent ideas in {{the very act of}} conceiving them, not needing to transmit them, as at present, by letters or long visits. Nay, when this friend of mine lives beyond the four <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> house, the trifling circumstance, that in order to reach him I must cross the street, dress myself, and so forth, will of itself destroy the enjoyment of the moment, and the train <b>of</b> <b>my</b> thoughts is torn in pieces before I see him.|$|R
60|$|This I {{said with}} a <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> eye in the usual quarter, towards the arts, little dreaming what destiny was to provide.|$|E
6000|$|... "Desperate man, {{there is}} no need; you will find it to the north-west <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> upper {{secretary}} drawer. I spromise not to appear." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{glanced at}} my {{opponent}} out of the <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> eyes. The man was suffering. Beads of perspiration stood out on his forehead.|$|E
5000|$|Priestley {{was born}} in Portland, Oregon to Mae Irene and Arthur James Priestley. She {{grew up in a}} wooded area near the Willamette River with horses, dogs, a cat and a huge {{collection}} of comic books. Priestley began experimenting with animation early in her life. In an interview with Harvey Deneroff she explained: “One of the first toys I was given was a zoetrope, which worked on a little turntable and had little zoetrope strips with it. I loved it! I’m sure I became an animator because of that toy. Then I started drawing on the <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> textbooks in grade school, and later studied art in high school and college, where I specializing in painting and printmaking.” ...|$|R
60|$|Our way led {{us through}} the town where {{everybody}} seemed to be standing about doing nothing and speaking very little. There was a curious air of expectancy upon their faces. They knew that the crisis was at hand, that their nation's fate hung upon the scales, and they watched my every look and movement as though in them they expected to read an omen. I too watched them out <b>of</b> the <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> eyes, wondering whether I should escape from their savage company alive. If once the blood lust broke out among them, {{it seemed to me}} that I should have about as much chance as a chopped fox among a pack of hungry hounds.|$|R
60|$|Then {{that vision}} {{vanished}} and Ayesha's voice {{began to seem}} very far away and dreamy, also her wondrous beauty became visible to me through her veil, as though I had acquired a new sense that overcame the limitations of mortal sight. Even in this extremity I reflected it was well that the last thing I looked on should be something so glorious. No, not quite the last thing, for out <b>of</b> the <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> eyes I saw that Umslopogaas from a sitting position had sunk on to his back and lay, apparently dead, with his axe still gripped tightly and held above his head, as though his arm had been turned to ice.|$|R
60|$|In a dim <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> {{room for}} longer than my fancy thinks A {{beautiful}} and silent Sphinx has watched me through the shifting gloom.|$|E

6000|$|... "As you see, madam mother, I am at practice," [...] I answered, {{and out of}} the <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> eye I {{caught the}} grim {{approving}} twitch of old Falcone's lips.|$|E
60|$|I {{returned}} {{at night}} {{by the same}} railroad {{and in the same}} kind of car. One of the passengers being exceedingly anxious to expound at great length to my companion (not to me, of course) the true principles on which books of travel in America should be written by Englishmen, I feigned to fall asleep. But glancing all the way out at window from the <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> eyes, I found abundance of entertainment for the rest of the ride in watching the effects of the wood fire, which had been invisible in the morning but were now brought out in full relief by the darkness: for we were travelling in a whirlwind of bright sparks, which showered about us like a storm of fiery snow.|$|R
6000|$|... "Do, if you please, my dear child," [...] {{answered}} Hepzibah. [...] "But {{put it on}} {{the table}} in the <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> the passage. <b>My</b> eyes are weak; and I can seldom bear the lamplight on them." ...|$|R
500|$|Hamlisch and Alan and Marilyn Bergman wrote [...] "The Way We Were" [...] while Marty Paich handled its production. In particular, {{the lyrics}} detail the {{personal}} life of Katie Morosky, the character she portrays in the film. Specifically, her troubling relationship with Robert Redford's Hubbell Gardiner is explained, [...] "Memories light the <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> mind / Misty watercolor {{memories of the}} way we were" [...] and [...] "Memories may be beautiful and yet". Streisand sings, [...] "What's too painful to remember / We quickly choose to forget", where she longs for nostalgia, which Rolling Stones Stephen Holden described as an implication that [...] "resonate in the current social malaise". In the beginning of {{what seems to be a}} bridge, she whispers, [...] "If we had the chance to do it all again / Tell me would we? Could we?".|$|R

40|$|This {{article is}} a {{reflective}} account {{of a series of}} short films and book works I have made about <b>my</b> home town <b>of</b> Eden, Northern Ireland.

Therefore I have written a kind <b>of</b> wander through <b>my</b> practice <b>of</b> keeping notebooks and making films. The article explores the techniques and methods used within my filmmaking practice such as incremental writing, anecdote, wandering and chance encounter as a way to create ideas and find meaning from the landscape. I want to focus on the importance of this tactile and reflective process that is often not visible or explicit within the final films. This is an opportunity for me focus on themes and concerns that are present within this fragmented body of work and shine a light into the darken <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> practice...|$|R
