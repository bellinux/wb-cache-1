5000|$|Originally, {{there were}} 23 CB {{channels}} in the U.S.; the 40-channel band plan was implemented in 1977.

Channel 10 was originally often used for highway travel communications east of the Mississippi River, and channel 19 west of the Mississippi; channel 19 then became the preferred highway channel in most areas, as it did not have adjacent-channel interference problems with channel 9.

5000|$|In the United States, the Family Radio Service was {{authorized}} starting in 1996. It uses half-watt hand-held FM UHF radios with 14 fixed channels. Many radios {{sold in the}} United States are advertised as having 22 channels (instead of 14) and claim extremely long range capability. These radios are actually dual-mode radios with both FRS and 8 GMRS (General Mobile Radio Service) exclusive frequencies programmed in them. Use of GMRS requires a simple license, although many users never acquire the license. GMRS radios can transmit up to 5 watts of power. FRS channels 1 through 7 are shared with GMRS and therefore higher power {{can be used on}} channels 1-7, providing greater communication range compared to the 500 mW FRS power limit. Channels 8-14 are FRS only and even combination FRS/GMRS radios may legally only transmit up to 0.5 watts on channels 8-14. The eight GMRS frequencies are often programmed in these radios as channels 15-22, with up to 5 watts of power. Some transceivers feature switchable high/low power output on channels 1-7 and 15-22. Operating GMRS equipment without a license and/or using GMRS power levels on FRS frequencies is illegal and {{is often referred to as}} [...] "bubble-pack piracy" [...] due to the plastic bubble packs that dual-service FRS/GMRS radios are often packaged and sold in. Due to lax enforcement of these rules, the vast majority of GMRS and high power FRS users are unlicensed. GMRS users have the option of setting up repeater systems on the eight GMRS-only frequencies. however the majority of 22-channel FRS/GMRS radios do not support repeater capability. All channels must be shared by all users. All users must cooperate in the sharing of channels. Repeaters are not permitted on FRS frequencies (this includes channels 1-7). 462.675 MHz is the recommended GMRS calling/emergency/motorist assistance channel. Channel 1 (462.5625 MHz) is also often used as an unofficial <b>calling</b> <b>channel.</b>|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Too many hams {{seem to have}} {{completely}} misunderstood APRS and think of APRS as just a vehicle tracking system that transmits GPS coordinates. When in fact, APRS is exactly the opposite. APRS is a receive and display system for the distribution and display of relevant immediate information of use to the mobile operator and others in VHF range. Now that we have another major manufacturer implementing APRS, {{it is time to}} get public perceptions back on track! My response to those people who think of APRS as a tracking system is that the tracking-only application is a relatively dead-end way of thinking about ham radio, and no wonder they are not interested, because in most cases, no one really cares where they are. But flip it around, focus on the receipt and display of local ham radio information and APRS represents the epitome of ham radio. It is receiving signals and information pertaining to every aspect of Ham radio in the immediate VHF surrounding area that is the joy of APRS.

5000|$|From the outset, the {{government}} attempted to regulate CB radio with license fees and call signs, but eventually they abandoned this approach. Enthusiasts rushed for licences {{when the doors}} opened at post offices around Australia in mid 1977 {{and by the end}} of the first quarter of 1978 there had been an estimated 200,000 licences issued (Australia's Population in 1978 was 14.36 Million). The regulations called for one licence per CB radio. The price for a licence in 1977 was AU$25, a not insubstantial amount for the average Australian wage-earner. Australian CB radio uses AM, USB, and LSB modes (No FM) on 27Mhz, allowed output power being 4 Watts AM and 12 Watts SSB. UHF is 477 Mhz, with an output power of 5 Watts. When CB was first legalised the 27 MHz CB Band was intended to be closedAustralian CBers in 1982 and only the 477 Mhz UHF band was to continue, but this did not eventuate. The first 477MHZ CB radio in 1977 was designed and made in Australia by Philips and was a 40 <b>channel</b> CB <b>called</b> the FM320. 27 MHz CB Channel Allocation in Australia is Channel 8 (27.055 MHz) Truckies or Highway Channel, Channel 9 (27.065 MHz) Emergency, Channel 11 (27.085 MHz) AM <b>Call</b> <b>Channel,</b> Channel 16 (27.155 MHz) LSB SSB <b>Call</b> <b>Channel,</b> 35 (27.355 MHz) LSB 2nd SSB <b>Call</b> <b>Channel.</b> UHF CB Channel Allocation is Channel 5 Emergency, <b>Channel</b> 11 <b>Call</b> <b>Channel,</b> Channel 40 Truckies or Highway.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{an investigation into}} the application and performance of direct sequence spread spectrum techniques for land mobile radio systems. There is {{a brief description of the}} basic principles of operation of direct sequence systems. The multiple user facility is analysed and values obtained for the maximum number of simultaneous system users in terms of system parameters. This clearly illustrates the need for power control. A possible method of providing power control is described. Comparison of user density is made against conventional narrowband modulation methods. There is some discussion of the effect of sequence cross-correlations on the number of system users. The system organisation is mentioned, showing possible application of a <b>calling</b> <b>channel.</b> Consideration is given to the possibilities of bandsharing with narrowband modulation systems. Figures are derived for the resulting interference to existing systems which would be caused by such an arrangement. A brief resume of the pertinent features of the land mobile radio channel is given. The effects of shadowing on the output quality and spectral efficiency of direct sequence systems is discussed. There is an analysis of the effects of shadowing on the user density in small cell schemes. An analysis shows the effects of multipath propagation on direct sequence performance by reference to a simple two path channel. Details are given of a simple experimental direct sequence spread spectrum transmitter and receiver constructed. The measured results for the performance of the system against various forms of interference and channel degredation are compared with their theoretical values. Finally ideas for future work are discussed...|$|E
