The infiltration capacities of 9 permeable pavements and 2 swales sites, all with different ages ranging from 1 year to 14 years, were measured using replicate double ring infiltrometers.

40|$|This project {{looked at}} the various responses, both {{political}} and aesthetic, {{to the end of}} socialist realism and the return of pre-war modernism as a desirable ideal. It considered both the built environment and objects of daily use (furniture, radios, TV sets, etc.) in several countries of the region, including Estonia, Hungary, Poland, Russia and Romania, also comparing developments there with corresponding ones in the west. Among particular aspects considered were the effects of Kruschev's speech in December 1954 to workers in construction, machine-building and design industries, in which he argued against monumentalism and criticised both "classical architecture" and socialist realism. The team see the real issue in interpreting Eastern European architecture as its lack of a critical edge, since official discourses took the place of any form of criticism and architects sought to implement the "official line". Megastructures became increasingly popular from the 1960 s onwards and in Romania, for instance, came to dominate the city in the late 1980 s. Such structures proved an efficient way to control the environment in countries plagued by prefabrication and social housing, and the group see the exhibition of inflated <b>concrete</b> <b>grids</b> as perhaps the most important feature of Eastern European architecture in the 1960 s and 1970 s. They also point out the rarity of glass and steel architecture in the east, where the preferred material was concrete, a material seen as "revolutionary" as it was the product of heavy industry and was grey, i. e. the workers' colour. Tactile elements were more important here than the visual elements favoured in the west, and a solidity more in line with the dominant ideology than the ephemeral qualities of glass...|$|R

The aimed SFRSCC was prepared in a concrete mix plant, and standard specimens, ½ scale beam prototypes and a ¼ scale grid prototype were cast. To take into account, in the design context, the fibre distribution and orientation that can occur in grid foundations, core samples were extracted from distinct locations and depths in these beams, and the stress-crack width relationship, σ-w, was experimentally assessed. Based on the obtained σ-w curves, and using a cross-section layer model, the flexural capacity of the grid foundation was evaluated.

40|$|Mechanized {{methods of}} {{vibratory}} concrete consolidation were used on {{all or part}} of fourteen bridge decks in Illinois from 1996 to 1998. The method used on twelve decks consisted of vertical insertion of vibrators in a grid pattern. A transverse drag-through process was used on two decks. Cores were analyzed from decks of both types and compared with cores from conventionally poured decks in order to measure differences in entrapped air voids and in-place density. Based on statistical analysis, the grid pattern method was found to be significantly better than both the drag-through and conventional methods for reducing entrapments per square inch and increasing in-place density. The drag-through method was found to be better than the conventional method for reducing entrapments, but no difference was found for density. Segregation was found in the drag-through cores, but not for either the grid pattern or the conventional method. Some problems were noted on construction sites, mainly having to do with increased weight of the finishing machine and the effect of greater vibration intensity on superplasticized concrete. Costs associated with use of the grid pattern method were approximately $ 6. 58 per square meter ($ 5. 50 per square yard) of bridge deck.

40|$|Urban {{flooding}} is a manmade disaster, and {{a recurrent}} problem in {{cities around the}} globe. Increased surface imperviousness due to urbanization along with inadequate drainage infrastructure system are the chief culprits for urban flooding. Flooding in an urban area brings about severe economic, structural, and environmental damages, and {{can be associated with}} casualties too. In order to evade flooding, an efficient flood model is imperative to study current flooding, and analyze flooding behavior to urban surface characteristics. This research aims to develop a framework using Geographic Information System (GIS) to perform modeling and mapping of flood spatiotemporal variation in urban micro-watersheds. Moreover, watershed hydrologic response to the flood remediation measures through land cover changes is analyzed. The GIS-framework includes a workflow of several methods and processes including delineating urban watershed, generation of runoff hydrograph, and time series mapping of inundation depths and flood extent. The developed GIS-framework is used to study urban watershed hydrologic response to the change in land surface characteristics. This framework is tested in areas previously known to have experienced flooding at the University of Nevada Las Vegas (UNLV) main campus including Blacklot parking lot and East Mall. Calibration is performed with Digital Elevation Model (DEM) resolution, rainfall temporal resolution, and clogging factors whereas validation is performed using news reports and photographic evidence. The testing at Blacklot site resulted in calibration at 5 m DEM resolution and clogging factor of 0. 83. The flood model produces a peak flood depth error of 24 % between the estimated (26 inches) and actual flood depth (34 inches) for the Blacklot. The observed inundation points are found to be within the estimated flood extents. The flood beginning time (1 : 53 PM) is found consistent with the actual timing of 2 : 00 PM. East Mall site shows consistent results. The GIS framework provides spatiotemporal maps of flood inundation for visualization of flood dynamics. Through the calibration against DEM and rainfall resolution, it is observed that DEM resolution follows an irregular trend against errors, while rainfall resolution produces higher errors with increasing resolution. The response of an urban watershed to land cover change is also analyzed. The tests are conducted in the Blacklot area, and the land cover types include porous asphalt, gravel and grass swale strips, grass pavers, and <b>concrete</b> <b>grid</b> pavers. The analysis shows that the watershed flooding reduces with a decrease in curve numbers of the surface materials. Flooding is reduced by 26 % for porous asphalt, and only 2. 90 % for grass and gravel swale strips. The flooding is most reduced for grass pavers (by 46 %), while flooding is reduced to none for <b>concrete</b> <b>grid</b> pavers. <b>Concrete</b> <b>grid</b> pavers are found to be the optimum land cover in the Blacklot area to avoid flooding. This research provides insight into flood modeling, and mapping for a storm drain inlet based watershed. It also provides intuition on calibration against DEM and rainfall temporal resolution, and on soft validation techniques. Finally, it provides understanding on watershed hydrologic response to flood remediation land surfaces...|$|E
40|$|In {{this report}} carbon fibre {{in the form}} of braided rope was {{considered}} for the possibility of use in reinforcing concrete. Braided carbon fibre ropes were considered for applications such as tendons for prestressed concrete or grids for slabs and beams. Experimental investigations that were carried out by Cortis, Kaczmarcyzyk, & Pearce, (2013) reported a low bonding strength between concrete and braided carbon fibre rope. This means braided carbon fibre despite having exceptional mechanical properties may not be used for prestressed concrete. However, braided carbon fibre may be used for post-tensioning of <b>concrete.</b> <b>Grid</b> reinforcement may {{be the only way to}} effectively to use carbon fibre for concrete reinforcement. Application of grid reinforcement in concrete was reported to increase the pull out load (Seo & Djamaluddin, 2006).

Therefore, grid carbon fibre reinforcement may be used to reinforce concrete slabs, wall panels and beams...|$|E
40|$|AbstractJinping I {{hydropower}} {{station is}} one of the most challenging projects in China due to its highest arch dam and complex geological conditions for construction. After geological investigation into the dam foundation, a few large-scale weak discontinuities are observed. The rock masses in the left dam foundation are intensively unloaded, approximately to the depth of 150 – 300 m. These serious geological defects lead to a geological asymmetry on the left and right banks, and thus some major difficulties of dam construction are encountered. In this paper, the influences of geological defects on the project are analyzed, followed by the concepts and methods of treatment design. Based on the analysis, the treatment methods of the weak rock masses and discontinuities are carefully determined, including the concrete cushion, <b>concrete</b> replacement <b>grids,</b> and consolidation grouting. They work together to enhance the strength and integrity of the dam foundation. Evaluations and calibrations through geo-mechanical model tests in combination with field monitoring results in early impoundment period show that the arch dam and its foundation are roughly stable, suggesting that the treatment designs are reasonable and effective. The proposed treatment methods and concepts in the context can be helpful for similar complex rock projects...|$|R

This new barrier wall system was adopted in the Canadian Highway Bridge Design Code (CSA 2006 a). El-Salakawy et al. (2003) tested to-collapse PL- 2 and PL- 3 barrier walls reinforced with low-modulus GFRP bars. They conducted pendulum impact testing (El-Salakawy et al. 2005) on the developed barriers in lieu of vehicle crash testing. In 2007, El-Gamal et al. (2007) conducted pendulum impact testing on PL- 2 and PL- 3 barrier walls reinforced with GFRP bars with lower tensile strength and bigger modulus of elasticity than those used in the earlier pendulum impact testing. In 2011, Charron et al. (2011) developed a precast bridge parapet made with fibre-reinforced concrete (FRC) using the nonlinear finite-element computer modeling. Specific properties of high- and ultrahigh-performance FRC were exploited in these designs. Others conducted finite-element analysis modeling of GFRP-reinforced bridge barrier (Hedjazi et al. 2016; Khederzadeh and Sennah 2015). They conducted experimental testing on the developed FRC barrier to examine the barrier wall cantilever action and compared the results with numerical simulation. Buth et al.

These tested resulted in two MTO Standard Drawings that are currently used by contractors and consulting engineering to bid on MTO bridge projects. Few authors conducted tests on the capacity of barrier–deck junction incorporating GFRP with headed-ends and bars with 180 ° hooks (Azimi et al. 2014 a, b; Rostami et al. 2016). El-Salakawy and Islam (2014) examined experimentally two repair strategies of a GFRP-reinforced concrete bridge barrier damage by vehicle impact. Most recently, American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials, AASHTO (2009) established bridge guide specifications for GFRP-reinforced concrete bridge decks and traffic railings. However, this guide does not provide procedure for the design of the barrier wall except for the diagonal tension in the deck slab below the barrier–deck junction based on a recent work by Matta and Nanni (2009).|$|R
