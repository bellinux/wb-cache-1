40|$|This paper investigates {{whether there}} are {{accident}} vessel damage cost differentials among <b>container,</b> tanker and <b>bulk</b> <b>vessels.</b> Tobit estimates of accident vessel damage cost equations suggest that vessel damage cost differentials exist for <b>container</b> versus <b>bulk</b> and tanker versus <b>bulk</b> <b>vessel</b> accidents, but not for container versus tanker vessel accidents. The vessel damage cost per vessel gross ton of a container (tanker) accident is $ 33. 37 ($ 18. 37) {{less than that of}} a bulk accident, all else held constant. The damage cost differentials are associated with fire/explosion accidents and human and environmental accident causes. The accident vessel damage cost differentials found in this paper may be compared with vessel hull insurance rates for investigating whether the latter reflect the former. Also, such comparisons may reveal whether there is cross-subsidisation among vessel hull insurance payees.
