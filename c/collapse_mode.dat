Depending on girder geometry and load eccentricity, eccentrically patch loaded girders might have <b>collapse</b> <b>mode</b> and collapse load {{the same as}} centrically loaded girders (i. e. {{as if there is}} no eccentricity) or completely different <b>collapse</b> <b>mode</b> than in case of centric load, with reduced collapse load due to load eccentricity.

40|$|The paper {{suggests}} {{the introduction of}} patterns {{to the surface of}} conventional thin-walled square tubes to improve the energy absorption capacity under axial compressive loads. A quasi-static axial crushing analysis has been conducted numerically by the nonlinear explicit finite element code LS-DYNA. Two types of patterns constructed using the basic pyramid elements were introduced. Type A pattern was aimed at triggering the extensional mode for relatively thin square tubes whereas type B pattern was intended to develop new <b>collapse</b> <b>mode</b> capable of absorbing more energy during collapse. A total of 30 tubes with a length of 120 mm, thickness 1. 2 mm and widths of 40 or 60 mm were simulated. Numerical results showed that all tubes with type A patterns developed the extensional <b>collapse</b> <b>mode</b> instead of the symmetric <b>collapse</b> <b>mode</b> and absorbed about 15 - 32. 5 % more energy than conventional thin-walled square tubes with a mass increase less than 5 %. Meanwhile, a new <b>collapse</b> <b>mode</b> named octagonal <b>collapse</b> <b>mode</b> was observed for tubes with type B pattern and the energy absorption of tubes developing this mode increased by 54 - 93 % compared with the conventional tube. The influence of various configurations of the patterns on the deformation and energy absorption of the tubes was also discussed. The paper opens up a new avenue in design of high energy absorption components. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E

40|$|This {{paper is}} to develop {{analytical}} models for the underwater capacitive micromachined ultrasonic transducer (CMUT) to understand its large deflection effect from the water pressure. To accurately model the displacement profile of the CMUT under the water pressure, Von Kármán equations and the perturbation method are employed to calculate the membrane deformation from a uniform pressure. The equations for an annular-ring plate model are first applied to calculate the displacement profile of the uniform CMUT membrane.

40|$|Generative {{adversarial}} networks (GANs) are innovative {{techniques for}} learning generative models of complex data distributions from samples. Despite remarkable recent improvements in generating realistic images, {{one of their}} major shortcomings {{is the fact that}} in practice, they tend to produce samples with little diversity, even when trained on diverse datasets. This phenomenon, known as <b>mode</b> <b>collapse,</b> has been the main focus of several recent advances in GANs. Yet there is little understanding of why <b>mode</b> <b>collapse</b> happens and why existing approaches are able to mitigate <b>mode</b> <b>collapse.</b> We propose a principled approach to handling <b>mode</b> <b>collapse,</b> which we call packing.

40|$|This work {{introduces}} a design method for the progressive collapse of thin-walled tubular components under axial and oblique impacts. The proposed design method follows {{the principles of}} topometry optimization for compliant mechanism design in which the output port location and direction determine the folding (<b>collapse)</b> <b>mode.</b> In this work, the output ports are located near the impact end with a direction that is perpendicular to the component's longitudinal axis.

The enforced buckle zone in the end portion of the tube also helps to avoid or delay the onset of global bending during an oblique impact with load angles higher than a critical value, which otherwise adversely affects the structure's capacity for load-carrying and energy absorption.
