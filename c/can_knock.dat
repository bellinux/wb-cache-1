5|$|Battletoads Arcade, {{also known}} as Super Battletoads in Japan or just Battletoads, is a 1994 {{scrolling}} beat 'em up arcade game in the Battletoads series developed by Rare and published by Electronic Arts. Up to three players, as the Battletoads, brawl aliens and mutant rodents through six levels to save the universe from the Dark Queen. The game also includes vertical and bonus levels. Each Toad has its own signature attack, and as customary for the series, players <b>can</b> <b>knock</b> enemies towards the screen, breaking the fourth wall.|$|E
5|$|As a first-person shooter, Metro: Last Light {{features}} {{a variety of}} firearms, some fictional and some based on real weapons, which the player uses in combat. The game's protagonist, Artyom, also {{has the ability to}} kill an enemy directly with his melee weapon. Artyom has three weapons slots. Players can put any weapon into these slots without restriction. Players have access to four different secondary weapons, including throwing knives, claymores, incendiary grenades, and hand grenades. Mutants do not possess weapons and tend to physically attack the player in swarms, while humans fight with the same firearms available to the player. The player <b>can</b> <b>knock</b> out or kill most human enemies instead of shooting them, using stealth to avoid detection. As enemies are inefficient in spotting the player character in darkness, players can turn off oil lamps and light bulbs to gain an advantage over their opponents.|$|E
5|$|He also gains {{the ability}} to constrict objects and enemies with a band of energy, {{although}} this feature {{was one of the}} few abilities not to feature in future games. Players can find an ancient relic that gives Raziel the power to fire bolts of telekinetic energy, which cause little damage by themselves but <b>can</b> <b>knock</b> enemies into hazards and push objects from a distance. Baptism in holy flame can transform the Soul Reaver into the Fire Reaver, which can set enemies aflame and adds fire to Raziel's telekinetic bolts. Players can also find magical glyphs that allow Raziel to expend magical energy to attack groups of enemies simultaneously. These glyphs typically involve vampire weaknesses such as sunlight, fire, water, or sound, as well as additions such as telekinetic force (available well before the normal telekinesis becomes available) and the causing of earthquakes to temporarily stun enemies. Glyphs are acquired through finding glyph altars, specific locations in Nosgoth where the skills can be learned, and solving a puzzle before being granted the magical ability. However, Raziel begins the game with access to the 'Shift' glyph, granting {{the ability to}} shift between the material and spectral planes, with no glyph altar necessary.|$|E

25|$|Characteristic X-ray {{emission}} (X-ray fluorescence): If {{the electron}} has enough energy it <b>can</b> <b>knock</b> an orbital electron {{out of the}} inner electron shell of a metal atom, {{and as a result}} electrons from higher energy levels then fill up the vacancy and X-ray photons are emitted. This process produces an emission spectrum of X-rays at a few discrete frequencies, sometimes referred to as the spectral lines. The spectral lines generated depend on the target (anode) element used and thus are called characteristic lines. Usually these are transitions from upper shells into K shell (called K lines), into L shell (called L lines) and so on.|$|E
25|$|How {{were the}} bricks stuck together? One {{hypothesis}} is that the builders at Mỹ Sơn developed a way to glue bricks together using tree resin native to central Vietnam. Another {{hypothesis is that}} the builders used a sticky mortar made from the same clay as the bricks themselves. The latter hypothesis is supported by chemical tests that have found no trace of any organic substance between the bricks, but instead have found mineral substances similar to those present {{in the core of}} the bricks. Today the mortar that once held the bricks together has largely decayed, and even a strong wind <b>can</b> <b>knock</b> loose bricks from the structures.|$|E
25|$|The {{environment}} also factors {{heavily in}} combat. In an urban level, for example, snipers {{can be sent}} onto rooftops to eliminate unsuspecting enemies below. Tanks <b>can</b> <b>knock</b> down walls and other obstacles to open new paths. Buildings and other structures offer hard cover around which to maneuver. Foliage offers soft cover to reduce the chance of being spotted by the enemy and to confound their aim when seen. As the Gallian forces advance across the battlefield, control points can be captured, giving the player a tactical advantage and offering additional locations in which to call reinforcements. As Welkin, the player can issue various Orders {{for the purpose of}} things such as artillery strikes, supervising medics, and improving offensive or defensive capabilities of various characters.|$|E

25|$|The game uses a {{class-based}} character system, {{similar to}} the system found in Pandemic's previous game Star Wars: Battlefront. There are four playable classes. Warriors are a melee combat unit which focus on swordsmanship. Unlike the other classes, whose special attacks recharge over time, warriors can only gain energy by defeating enemies, which allows them to unleash more powerful attacks with a flaming sword, such as spinning to hit every adjacent enemy. They are the only class that can block or perform counterattacks with special moves. The warrior also has a throwing axe as a secondary, medium ranged weapon. Archers are better suited for long range combat and are equipped with a bow and arrow. Different types of arrows can be equipped: fire arrows, which <b>can</b> <b>knock</b> down enemies and deal explosive damage; poison arrows, which slow enemies down and do damage over time, {{and the ability to}} fire a volley of three normal arrows at multiple enemies at once. They also have a kick for use in close-quarters, which knocks back the enemy. They can also hit concealed Scouts with the multiple arrow skill. A headshot will allow the archer to kill most enemies in a single hit.|$|E
25|$|Combat {{tends to}} focus on large battles with {{multiple}} combatants. The player will often take on large numbers of enemies at once, sometimes with AI allies, sometimes alone. In the midst of battle, a small flash is placed on an attacking enemy's weapon to indicate the danger of an impending strike. Care {{must be taken to}} block incoming attacks in between offensive blows, hence the player must balance offence and defense to avoid taking damage. The player's shield {{can also be used to}} shove enemies back (again, the player has the option to shove back a single enemy a good distance, or perform a radial shove, pushing a group of enemies back a small distance). This allows the player to interrupt an enemy's block, or to shove enemies off ledges. Shield attacks are especially important for fighting enemies who themselves have shields, as shield attacks <b>can</b> <b>knock</b> them off balance briefly, leaving them open to attack. When an enemy has been knocked to the ground, the player can perform a one hit finishing move, which differs with each weapon. Using these finishing moves in succession fills the rage bar much quicker than landing successful attacks on standing enemies.|$|E
500|$|A's {{pitching}} coach Dave Duncan said of Henderson, [...] "You {{have to be}} careful because he <b>can</b> <b>knock</b> one out. But you don't want to be too careful because he's got a small strike zone and you can't afford to walk him. And that's only half the problem. When he gets on base he's more trouble still." [...] Sportswriter Tom Verducci wrote, [...] "Baseball is designed to be an egalitarian sort of game in which one player among the 18 is not supposed to dominate... Yet in the past quarter century Henderson and Barry Bonds have come closest to dominating a baseball game the way Michael Jordan could a basketball game." ...|$|E
50|$|On a {{table or}} work desk, coffee cups <b>can</b> be <b>knocked</b> {{over by the}} person sitting and working at the desk by their arms or hands. This can happen very easily if they are {{disturbed}} e.g. by a telephone call or by a sudden impulse move. Coffee cups on desks <b>can</b> also be <b>knocked</b> over by pets such as dogs or cats who may jump up on to the desk. Coffee or tea can also spill out of a cup if the table is knocked by a person walking by.|$|R

50|$|Certain enemies carry melee weapons, which <b>can</b> be <b>knocked</b> out {{of their}} hands and picked up to use against them. Available weapons include {{baseball}} bats, whips, throwing knives, and dynamite; in addition, rocks, oil drums, and boxes {{can be found in}} certain places.|$|R
500|$|The main supernatural {{powers are}} {{unlocked}} and purchased using runes—artifacts carved from whale bone—and each can be upgraded. Powers include [...] "Dark Vision", {{which allows the}} player to see enemies through walls, their field of view and highlights interactive objects; [...] "Blink", a short-distance teleportation ability; [...] "Possession", that allows the player to temporarily inhabit and possess other characters; [...] "Devouring Swarm", which summons a swarm of deadly rats; [...] "Bend Time", that slows or freezes time; [...] "Wind Blast", {{a gust of wind}} that <b>can</b> <b>knock</b> down enemies; and [...] "Shadow Kill" [...] that turns dead enemies to ash, preventing their discovery by opposing forces. The player can use weapons including a sword, grenades, a crossbow, and pistols. Coins must be collected to upgrade weapons and gadgets.|$|E

[...] He went on to say, [...] "I'm incredibly passionate about my support for the gay community and what they're dealing with at this current point in time". MacFarlane continued, [...] "Why is it that Johnny Spaghetti Stain in fucking Georgia <b>can</b> <b>knock</b> a woman up, legally be married to her, and then beat the shit out of her, but these two intelligent, sophisticated writers who have been together for 20 years can't get married?" ...|$|E
500|$|The {{player can}} move with weapons drawn and use {{automatic}} targeting functions. Enemies <b>can</b> <b>knock</b> Regina's weapon {{out of her}} hand, at which point she'll have to retrieve it. Sometimes [...] "DANGER" [...] may flash on the screen in perilous situations, {{at which point the}} player should push all the controller buttons as rapidly as possible to survive. If Regina becomes injured, she will hold her arm or struggle to walk. Med Paks can be used to heal Regina's health. Sometimes a trail of blood may appear, indicating that Regina is bleeding and will continue to lose health. Hemostats can be used to stop bleeding injuries. Two types of medical supplies are available in the game: Med Paks, which heals player health, and Hemostats, which stop bleeding injuries. If Regina dies, the player may continue from the room she died in. After five [...] "Continues" [...] are exhausted, the player must continue from their last save point.|$|E

500|$|Offensive {{abilities}} carry several attributes, including Physical, Fire, Ice, Wind, Electricity, Light, [...] Dark and Almighty. As well {{as various}} enemies carrying different attributes, player characters {{may also have}} strengths or weaknesses against certain attacks depending on their Persona or equipment. By exploiting an enemy's weakness or performing a critical attack, the player <b>can</b> <b>knock</b> them over, granting the attacking character an additional move, whilst the enemy may also be granted an additional move if they target a player character's weakness. If the player knocks all of the enemies down, they may be granted the opportunity to perform an [...] "All-Out Attack", {{in which all the}} players rush the downed enemies to inflict heavy damage. Following a battle, players gain experience points, money, and items from their battle. Sometimes after a battle, the player may participate in a mini-game known as [...] "Shuffle: Time" [...] and [...] "Arcana Chance", which can grant player new Personas or various bonuses respectively.|$|E
500|$|Rather than air, {{the solar}} wind is a stream of charged particles—a plasma—ejected from the upper {{atmosphere}} of the sun {{at a rate of}} [...] It consists mostly of electrons and protons with energies of about 1 keV. The stream of particles varies in temperature and speed with the passage of time. These particles are able to escape the sun's gravity, {{in part because of the}} high temperature of the corona, but also because of high kinetic energy that particles gain through a process that is not well understood. The solar wind creates the Heliosphere, a vast bubble in the interstellar medium surrounding the Solar System. Planets require large magnetic fields in order to reduce the ionization of their upper atmosphere by {{the solar wind}}. Other phenomena caused by the solar wind include geomagnetic storms that <b>can</b> <b>knock</b> out power grids on Earth, the aurorae such as the Northern Lights, and the plasma tails of comets that always point away from the sun.|$|E
500|$|Cyathus is a genus of {{fungi in}} the Nidulariaceae, a family collectively {{known as the}} bird's nest fungi. They are given this name since they {{resemble}} tiny bird's nests filled with [...] "eggs", structures large enough to have been mistaken {{in the past for}} seeds. However, these are now known to be reproductive structures containing spores. The [...] "eggs", or peridioles, are firmly attached to the inner surface of this fruit body by an elastic cord of mycelia known as a funiculus. The 45 species are widely distributed throughout the world and some are found in most countries, although a few exist in only one or two locales. Cyathus stercoreus is considered endangered in a number of European countries. Species of Cyathus are also known as splash cups, which refers to the fact that falling raindrops <b>can</b> <b>knock</b> the peridioles out of the open-cup fruit body. The internal and external surfaces of this cup may be ridged longitudinally (referred to as [...] or [...] ); this is one example of a taxonomic characteristic that has traditionally served to distinguish between species.|$|E

500|$|Julian Symons, {{writing in}} The Times Literary Supplement, found Moonraker [...] "a disappointment", and {{considered}} that [...] "Fleming's tendency... to parody {{the form of}} the thriller, has taken charge {{in the second half of}} this story."

Hilary Corke, writing in The Listener, thought that [...] "Fleming is one of the most accomplished of thriller-writers", and considered that Moonraker [...] "is as mercilessly readable as all the rest". Corke warned Fleming away from being over-dramatic, declaring that [...] "Mr Fleming is evidently far too accomplished to need to lean upon these blood-and-thunder devices: he could keep our hair on end for three hundred pages without spilling more blood than was allowed to Shylock."
