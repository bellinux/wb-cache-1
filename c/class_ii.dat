5|$|Class III {{dollars are}} {{identical}} to the <b>Class</b> <b>II</b> dollar, except lettering similar to that on the Class I dollars {{was applied to the}} edge of the coins. Based on the slightly concave appearance of the Class III dollars, it is likely that all were given edge lettering at some point after striking; as the Castaing machine was meant to be used prior to striking, its improper use resulted in a deformation of the coin surface. Newman and Bressett assert that they were struck at approximately the same time as the <b>Class</b> <b>II</b> dollars, and that the edges were lettered and the coins concealed by Mint employees until 1869, when one was offered to a coin collector, who rejected it as a restrike. However, numismatist S. Hudson Chapman believed that some Class III dollars were struck as late as 1876. In 1875, several were sold by Philadelphia coin dealer John W. Haseltine. Six specimens of the Class III dollar are known today.|$|E
5|$|About 250 Pictish stones {{survive and}} have been {{assigned}} by scholars to three classes. Class I stones are those thought to date to the period up to the 7th century and are the most numerous group. The stones are largely unshaped and include incised symbols of animals including fish and the Pictish beast, everyday objects such as mirrors, combs and tuning forks and abstract symbols defined by names including V-rod, double disc and Z-rod. They are found between from the Firth of Forth to Shetland. The greatest concentrations are in Sutherland, around modern Inverness and Aberdeen. Good examples include the Dunrobin (Sutherland) and Aberlemno stones (Angus). <b>Class</b> <b>II</b> stones are carefully shaped slabs dating after the arrival of Christianity in the 8th and 9th centuries, with a cross on one face and {{a wide range of}} symbols on the reverse.

The same ideas are extended to show a way to implement push-down automata with two stacks (i. e, universal computing devices) using two circular molecules glued with a DX molecule and a <b>class</b> <b>IIs</b> restriction enzyme. In this case each computational molecule also contains a DX portion. These devices can potentially be incorporated in an array of TX molecules. ...|$|R

5|$|A B cell {{identifies}} pathogens when antibodies on {{its surface}} bind to a specific foreign antigen. This antigen/antibody complex is {{taken up by the}} B cell and processed by proteolysis into peptides. The B cell then displays these antigenic peptides {{on its surface}} MHC <b>class</b> <b>II</b> molecules. This combination of MHC and antigen attracts a matching helper T cell, which releases lymphokines and activates the B cell. As the activated B cell then begins to divide, its offspring (plasma cells) secrete millions of copies of the antibody that recognizes this antigen. These antibodies circulate in blood plasma and lymph, bind to pathogens expressing the antigen and mark them for destruction by complement activation or for uptake and destruction by phagocytes. Antibodies can also neutralize challenges directly, by binding to bacterial toxins or by interfering with the receptors that viruses and bacteria use to infect cells.|$|E

5|$|The Trinity is {{a popular}} {{whitewater}} rafting and kayaking river. Dam releases for fish restoration have incidentally increased {{the amount of water}} available for boating year-round. The river has three main whitewater runs, all known for their scenery and wildlife. The Pigeon Point section, alongside Highway 299, contains Class II-III (beginner to intermediate) rapids. Below the takeout at Cedar Flat, the Trinity flows through the extremely hazardous Class V Burnt Ranch Gorge, which was first run in 1971 by three kayakers, one of whom {{died of a heart attack}} soon after finishing the run, due to the arduous work of portaging many rapids. This gave the area a bad reputation for many years; it was not until 1983 when commercial trips began on this section of the river. The lower Trinity, much of which flows through the Hoopa Valley Reservation, is a <b>Class</b> <b>II</b> river with gentler and lower gradient despite having a greater volume of water flow.|$|E

40|$|ObjectivesThis study {{sought to}} {{investigate}} factors associated with restenosis after endovascular therapy comparing TASC (Trans-Atlantic Inter-Society Consensus) <b>II</b> <b>classes</b> A to C with class D femoropopliteal (FP) lesions. BackgroundIt is unclear whether the determinants of restenosis for TASC <b>II</b> <b>class</b> D lesions {{are the same as}} those for TASC <b>II</b> <b>classes</b> A to C FP lesions. MethodsWe studied 2, 400 limbs from 1, 889 consecutive patients (73 ± 17 years of age; 31 % women; 30 % critical limb ischemia) who underwent successful endovascular therapy for de novo FP lesions. Predictors for restenosis in TASC <b>II</b> <b>classes</b> A to C and class D lesions were assessed using a Cox proportional hazards model. ResultsThe 5 -year primary patency rate was 50 % in TASC <b>II</b> <b>classes</b> A to C and 34 % in TASC <b>II</b> <b>class</b> D lesions, respectively (p < 0. 001). Overall, restenosis had a significant interaction with sex and renal failure (both p < 0. 01). Female sex was a significant risk factor for restenosis in TASC <b>II</b> <b>class</b> D lesions (adjusted hazard ratio [HR]: 1. 80, p < 0. 001) but not TASC <b>II</b> <b>classes</b> A to C lesions (adjusted HR: 1. 10, p = 0. 352). Conversely, renal insufficiency was a significant risk factor for restenosis in TASC <b>II</b> <b>classes</b> A to C lesions (adjusted HR: 1. 43, p < 0. 001) but not TASC <b>II</b> <b>class</b> D lesions (adjusted HR: 0. 79, p =  0. 129). Diabetes mellitus, no stent use, chronic total occlusion, and poor below-the-knee runoff were shared risk factors for restenosis between TASC <b>II</b> <b>classes</b> A to C and class D lesions (all p < 0. 05). ConclusionsFor de novo FP lesions, diabetes, no stent use, chronic total occlusion, and poor below-the-knee runoff were shared restenosis predictors for TASC <b>II</b> <b>classes</b> A to C and class D lesions, whereas renal failure was a predictor for TASC <b>II</b> <b>classes</b> A to C lesions and female sex for TASC II class D lesions...|$|R
