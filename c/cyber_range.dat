There remains argument amongst cyber crime scholars over how best to define the focus of the field and numerous theoretical explanations compete for preference with the scholarly community.

40|$|Human {{error is}} one of the most common causes of {{vulnerability}} in a secure system. However it is often overlooked when these systems are tested, partly because human tests are costly and very hard to repeat. We have developed a community of agents that test secure systems by running standard windows software while performing collaborative group tasks, mimicking more realistic patterns of communication and traffic, as well as human fatigue and errors. This system is being deployed on a large <b>cyber</b> testing <b>range.</b> One key attribute of humans is flexibility of response in order to achieve their goals when unexpected events occur. Our agents use reactive planning within a BDI architecture to flexibly replan if needed. Since the agents are goal-oriented, we are able to measure the impact of cyber attacks on mission accomplishment, a more salient measure of protection than raw penetration. We show experimentally how the agent teams can be resilient under attacks that are partly successful, and also how an organizational structure can lead to emergent properties of the traffic in the network...|$|R
40|$|Cyber {{crime is}} a {{worldwide}} problem, {{with a global}} reach. Cyber crimes do not respect national boundaries, and so {{can be sent to}} and from anywhere in the world. Many reports, mostly by cyber security firms, regularly release information ranking the different nations in terms of top cyber crime output, broken down into varying cyber crime types. However, little has been done to classify nations according to separate cyber crime typologies using any multivariate methods. Instead, reporting is descriptive and unidimensional. The present research sought to fill this gap by conducting K-means clustering analysis on a sample of 190 countries using seven dimensions of <b>cyber</b> crime <b>ranging</b> from malware, fraud, spam, and digital piracy, as well as measures of GDP and internet use. The findings determined that nations can be broken down into four distinct categories based on cyber crime activity: low cyber crime countries, non-serious cyber crime countries, advance fee fraud countries, and phishing scam countries. The implications of these findings and the directions for future research are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{work on the}} {{analysis}} of polymorphic shellcode engines suggests that modern obfuscation methods would soon eliminate the usefulness of signature-based network intrusion detection methods and supports growing views that {{the new generation of}} shellcode cannot be accurately and efficiently represented by the string signatures which current IDS and AV scanners rely upon. In this paper, we expand on this area of study by demonstrating never before seen concepts in advanced shellcode polymorphism with a proof-of-concept engine which we call Hydra. Hydra distinguishes itself by integrating an array of obfuscation techniques, such as recursive NOP sleds and multi-layer ciphering into one system while offering multiple improvements upon existing strategies. We also introduce never before seen attack methods such as byte-splicing statistical mimicry, safe-returns with forking shellcode and syscall-time-locking. In total, Hydra simultaneously attacks signature, statistical, disassembly, behavioral and emulation-based sensors, as well as frustrates ofﬂine forensics. This engine was developed to present an updated view of the frontier of modern polymorphic shellcode and provide an effective tool for evaluation of IDS systems, <b>Cyber</b> test <b>ranges</b> and other related security technologies...|$|R

30|$|In today’s Internet-connected {{world where}} {{technologies}} underpin almost {{every facet of}} our society, cybersecurity and forensic specialists are increasingly dealing with wide <b>ranging</b> <b>cyber</b> threats in almost real-time conditions. The capability to detect, analyze, and defend against such threats in near real-time conditions is not possible without employment of threat intelligence, big data, and machine learning techniques. For example, when {{a significant amount of}} data is collected from or generated by different security monitoring solutions, intelligent and next-generation big-data analytical techniques are necessary to mine, interpret, and extract knowledge of these unstructured/structured (big) data. Thus, this gives rise to cyber threat intelligence and analytic solutions, such as big data, artificial intelligence, and machine learning, to perceive, reason, learn, and act against cyber adversary tactics, techniques, and procedures.|$|R
40|$|Assignment of {{critical}} missions to unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) {{is bound to}} widen the grounds for adversarial intentions in the <b>cyber</b> domain, potentially <b>ranging</b> from disruption of command and control links to capture and use of airborne nodes for kinetic attacks.

40|$|In April 2017, {{the foreign}} {{ministers of the}} G 7 {{countries}} approved a ‘Declaration on Responsible States Behaviour in Cyberspace’ (G 7 Declaration 2017). The Declaration addresses a mounting concern about international stability and the security of our societies after the fast-pace escalation of cyber attacks occurred during the past decade. In the opening statement, the G 7 ministers stress their concern […] {{about the risk of}} escalation and retaliation in cyberspace […]. Such activities could have a destabilizing effect on international peace and security. We stress that the risk of interstate conflict as a result of ICT incidents has emerged as a pressing issue for consideration. […], (G 7 Declaration 2017, 1). Paradoxically, state actors often {{play a central role in}} the escalation of cyber attacks. State-run cyber attacks have been launched for espionage and sabotage purposes since 2003. Well-known examples include Titan Rain (2003), the Russian attack against Estonia (2006) and Georgia (2008), Red October targeting mostly Russia and Eastern European Countries (2007), Stuxnet and Operation Olympic Game against Iran (2006 – 2012). In 2016, a new wave of state-run (or state-sponsored) <b>cyber</b> attacks <b>ranged</b> from the Russian cyber attack against Ukraine power plant, 1 to the Chinese and Russian infiltrations US Federal Offices, 2 to the Shamoon/Greenbag cyber-attacks on government infrastructures in Saudi Arabia. 3 This trend will continue. The relatively low entry-cost and the high chances of success mean that states will keep developing, relying on, and deploying cyber attacks. At the same time, the ever more likely AI leap of cyber capabilities (Cath et al. 2017) —the use of AI and Machine Learning techniques for cyber offence and defence—indicates that cyber attacks will escalate in frequency, impact, and sophistication. Historically, escalation of interstate conflicts has been arrested using offensive or political strategies, sometimes in combination. Both have been deployed in cyberspace. The first failed; the second needs to be consolidated and enforced (Taddeo and Glorioso 2016 a, b). </p...|$|R
50|$|The biggest {{difference}} from previous {{games in the}} series lies in the Olympic mode: instead of starting in the Olympics, the player must improve and qualify an athlete for the event. Each event has four stages (Open Trials, Invitation Event, The Championship, and Olympic Class), and for each stage the player must complete minigames in the <b>Cyber</b> Gym that <b>range</b> from running on a treadmill, climbing a pole, squats or reaction training, {{for a total of}} 20 minigames. Completing a Cyber Gym game improves the athlete in one of the three ratings temporarily, and to earn the new capacities definitively, the athlete must complete an event with a certain score. After the player is happy with the athlete development, he can try to qualify for the next stage by running against other athletes at the same level. Although it's possible to compete in the Olympics as soon as the athlete reaches the Olympic Class, to get a perfect athlete (with 100% on all ratings) one must complete all minigames, including those on Olympic Class. As the game relies mostly on athletes' ratings, even players with lower button presses per minute can make World Record times without serious effort as long as they passed all the mini games. Other modes include an arcade mode, training and head to head, where two players can compete with their Olympic mode trained athletes. There are four difficulty levels altogether.|$|R
