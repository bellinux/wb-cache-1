40|$|Introduction Human {{designed}} physical patterns, {{while having}} been investigated extensively {{in terms of}} their historical, geographic and cultural significance and their aesthetic and/or mathematical characteristics, have not been fully investigated {{in terms of their}} evolutionary potential. This paper discusses an experimental art research project which focuses on human designed, physical textile patterns to explore pattern as process and investigate the potential for these patterns to evolve and become emergent. The experimental art projects focused on lace and in particular, <b>crochet</b> <b>lace</b> pattern forms commonly referred to as doilies. 1 <b>Crochet</b> <b>lace</b> patterns are widely recognized, domestically produced hand-made physical patterns created from a low-technology repetitive manual process and located for the most part within a craft context. The project explored the developmental potential of these physical pattern forms by translating them into digital media and working in the digital environment. The research created <b>crochet</b> <b>lace</b> pattern simulacra {{in the form of a}} series of digital animations written in computer programming code that illustrate how digital <b>crochet</b> <b>lace</b> patterns form. This paper discusses the properties of lace that make it worthy of further investigation, the motivation behind the selection of <b>crochet</b> <b>lace</b> patterns, and explores the digital environment and its impact on the development of the <b>crochet</b> <b>lace</b> pattern forms. It then reports how the digital <b>crochet</b> <b>lace</b> patterns, when created in a digital environment and constructed using digital media and manipulated by computational processes, became a hybrid form – that is, an amalgam of human design decisions and computational processes. As such, the <b>crochet</b> <b>lace</b> simulacra epitomize the intersection of computational processes and human intervention which is common in the digital environment...|$|E

However, their evolutionary potential remains under-theorized. While the digital environment is increasingly used as a design aid {{in the production of}} textiles, its potential for exploring the evolutionary possibilities for lace has not been fully investigated. This paper discusses an experimental research art project that explored the evolutionary potential for lace patterns within the digital environment. Human designed, hand-made domestically produced physical textile patterns such as lace are familiar in our everyday lives. Their historical, geographic and cultural significance, and aesthetic and/or mathematical characteristics, have been extensively investigated and documented. However, their evolutionary potential remains under-theorised and, while the digital environment is increasingly used as a design aid for patterns, the developmental potential of lace in a digital environment has not been fully explored. <b>Crochet</b> <b>lace</b> patterns are one example of human-designed physical patterns, which have remained largely stable and consistent throughout various societal, economic and geographical transformations (such as the industrial revolution and globalisation). As part of a research project, these patterns were translated into the digital environment where, as data, the patterns became available for manipulation. Digital manipulation of <b>crochet</b> <b>lace</b> patterns offers an opportunity to explore patterns arising from a hybrid aesthetic (that is an amalgam of human design and digital aesthetics) and therefore the potential to examine patterns that might be regarded as expressions of digital culture. Both <b>Crochet</b> <b>lace</b> patterns and software programming scripts use a form of code (<b>crochet</b> <b>lace</b> pattern instructions and computer programming languages respectively) and a systematic method of construction (that is, the application of a set of rules). Because of these similarities, the digital environment and more particularly computer software programming, is able to {{contribute to the development of}} the pattern form. Thus, the research project demonstrates the potential for conventional physical patterns to evolve and produce new pattern forms that both exist in, and are constructed of, the digital environment...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} a brief period, from 1845 to 1855, {{during which}} {{women and girls}} with no previous experience in textile design or production, initiated and produced a stylistically-unique lace. The context of the achievement is investigated to answer the two-part question: how were unskilled Irish <b>Crochet</b> <b>lace</b> makers able to create work of lasting aesthetic significance, and, what elements of their methodology are relevant for contemporary textile art practice? Primary archival and textual evidence is analysed and reveals that Irish <b>Crochet</b> <b>lace</b> is a hybrid of two styles of crochet that developed separately and simultaneously in Ireland, from different sources. Kildare makers, "of their own ingenuity", devised a way to copy old needlelace using a new, hooked, technique. Around Cork, technique allowed designs to evolve during, rather than being created prior to, the process of making. The art practice element of this thesis includes contemporary interpretations that replicate original makers' experimental approach to design, using digital software to mimic the spontaneity enabled by crochet technique. This work proposes that creative possibilities are inherent in a 'choreographed serendipitous' way of working. In this approach, experiential craft skills facilitate visualisation of what is possible {{within the limits of}} a craft, and chance effects stimulate artistic risk-taking. Using tacit knowledge of craft skills to provide an insight into creative problem-solving processes is one of three methodological bases utilised throughout the research. Grounded theory informed the extraction of pertinent facts from an extensive database of historical information, and an understanding of heuristics-based phenomenology helped effect an empathetic relationship between the researcher and the original lacemakers. Together, text and practice contribute to knowledge by revealing the bilateral sources of Irish <b>Crochet</b> <b>lace,</b> the reason for the historical success of the 'controlled chance' method, and its potential for producing creative outcomes in contemporary practice.

5000|$|Filet crochet {{is a type}} of crocheted fabric. This type of <b>crocheted</b> <b>lace</b> is gridlike {{because it}} uses only two crochet stitches: the chain stitch and the double crochet stitch (U.S. terminology; known in some other {{countries}} as chain stitch and treble). Old filet patterns used a treble or triple stitch vertically but chained two between the vertical stitches. This was to prevent distortion of some patterns. Chain stitches use less yarn than double crochet stitches, which results in a visual difference in appearance between the two kinds of stitch. Filet crochet forms patterns by filling in parts of a mostly chain stitch mesh with double crochet stitches. [...] Filet crochet is usually constructed from monotone crochet thread made of Mercerised cotton in white or ecru, and worked in rows. Filet crochet is used for decorative applications such as window curtains, tablecloths, and place settings such as coasters and placemats.|$|R
