The junction between the Dudley canal and the Stourbridge canal {{would be at the}} foot of the 9-lock Black Delph flight. The Act allowed the company to raise £7,000, and this had been subscribed by July 1778, but was insufficient to finance the work. The company continued to <b>call</b> <b>money</b> on the shares, and raised £9,200 in this way, with each £100 share being worth £128. Construction work was completed by 24 June 1779, apart from a water supply reservoir at Pensnett Chase, although little traffic used the canal until the Stourbridge Canal was completed in December of that year. As built, the canal terminated at two basins at Great Ox Leasow and Little Ox Leasow, both built on land owned by T. T. Foley, one of the main shareholders.|$|E

60|$|In {{the first}} place I find that the rich suffer perpetually from money troubles. The poor sit snugly at home while {{sterling}} exchange falls ten points in a day. Do they care? Not a bit. An adverse balance of trade washes over the nation like a flood. Who have to mop it up? The rich. <b>Call</b> <b>money</b> rushes up to a hundred per cent, and the poor can still sit and laugh at a ten cent moving picture show and forget it.|$|E

I tell thee {{there is}} gold {{in store for}} me--not what you <b>call</b> <b>money,</b> nursed {{in the lap of}} luxury, and cradled on grains, and {{drinking}} in wealth from a thousand mash-tubs. What do you know about money? What is poverty to you, is splendour to the hardy son of the humble apothecary. You can't live without an establishment, and your houses in town and country. A snug little house somewhere off Belgravia, a brougham for my wife, a decent cook, and a fair bottle of wine for my friends at home sometimes; these simple necessaries suffice for me, my Foker." [...] And here Pendennis began to look more serious. Without bantering further, Pen continued, [...] "I've rather serious thoughts of settling and marrying. No man can get on in the world without some money at his back. You must have a certain stake to begin with, before you can go in and play the great game. Who knows that I'm not going to try, old fellow? Worse men than I have won at it. And as I have not got enough capital from my fathers, I must get some by my wife--that's all." ...|$|E
50|$|Commercial {{banks have}} to {{maintain}} a minimum cash balance known as the cash reserve ratio. <b>Call</b> <b>money</b> is a method by which banks lend to each other {{to be able to}} maintain the cash reserve ratio. The interest rate paid on <b>call</b> <b>money</b> is known as the call rate. It is a highly volatile rate that varies from day to day and sometimes even from hour to hour. There is an inverse relationship between call rates and other short-term money market instruments such as certificates of deposit and commercial paper. A rise in <b>call</b> <b>money</b> rates makes other sources of finance, such as commercial paper and certificates of deposit, cheaper in comparison for banks to raise funds from these sources.|$|E
