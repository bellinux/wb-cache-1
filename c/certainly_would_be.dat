25|$|Palestinians {{have sought}} to retroactively judge Israeli actions in the 1940s under new norms {{developing}} {{in the late twentieth}} and early twenty-first centuries. But international law does not work like that. Though it is no doubt deeply unsatisfying to Palestinians and their many supporters, the correct legal {{answer to the question of}} whether the 1947–49 refugees have a right of return under international law goes something like this: even if (or assuming that) the Israelis did intentionally expel every Palestinian refugee, it was not illegal when it occurred, though it almost <b>certainly</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> if done today under the same circumstances; and the law at the time did not require repatriation of the refugees to Israel, though it most likely would if the expulsion were to occur today.|$|E
2500|$|Gregory {{spoke at}} a number of engagements in Charleston in 1910 and {{encountered}} a minister who had been to Green Acre and heard of the religion. Gregory also addressed the group of local Black lawyers. Twine, a trustee of the Old Bethel United Methodist Church, was the first to identify himself as a Bahá'í in South Carolina. Gregory wrote to the Hannen's of it [...] "… was particularly impressed with the explanation concerning 'clouds.' He added that if Christ were to come thru the literal clouds, he <b>certainly</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> hidden from half the earth, in view of its roundness." [...] Gregory left and would be away for a number of years. In the meantime, unbeknownst to Gregory, a year later Twine was committed to a mental institution by his mother and family priest, Rev. I. E. Lowery, for [...] "religious obsession" [...] though he hadn't lost any work and wasn't a threat to himself or others but was judged a threat to society. He died three years later, October 26, 1914. He was buried at the Old Bethel United Methodist Church Cemetery.|$|E
6000|$|... "If you wouldn't mind his {{remaining}} a little longer, it <b>certainly</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> safer," [...] said Herbert, with wondering gratitude.|$|E
60|$|Had Congress thought {{proper to}} direct such a measure, Schuyler <b>certainly</b> <b>would</b> have <b>been</b> {{the man to}} execute it.|$|R
6000|$|The doctor smiled. [...] "Well, you see, {{if you did}} {{remain on}} board you <b>would</b> <b>be</b> out of everything. You <b>certainly</b> <b>would</b> not <b>be</b> fit for boat service, you must see that yourself." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{conceived}} the most unreasonable hatred for that poor swordfish that {{had done nothing}} to me and that <b>certainly</b> <b>would</b> have <b>been</b> justified in ramming the boat.|$|R
6000|$|... "He <b>certainly</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> interested, and I'm {{very much}} afraid {{you have made}} trouble. But you haven't told me why you did it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "At present, it <b>certainly</b> <b>would</b> <b>be.</b> I {{have never}} spoken to either {{of them on the}} subject; but I presume they do not think of such a thing for the present." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Well, I {{must say}} I {{think we have}} been very {{comfortable}} here, under Mr. Snape,' said Charley. But if Mr. Snape is to go, why the office <b>certainly</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> deuced dull without him.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{might have}} {{supposed}} that," [...] answered the lady; [...] "for if Miss Asher {{would not take}} you she <b>certainly</b> <b>would</b> not <b>be</b> content with either of them." ...|$|R
5000|$|If {{the answers}} were [...] "no" [...] or [...] "low" [...] {{to any of}} these questions, the {{decision}} <b>certainly</b> <b>would</b> not <b>be</b> to kill the project - hence they're poor go/kill criteria.|$|R
6000|$|... "It <b>would</b> <b>be</b> a good plan, Fergus, {{though in}} truth the weight <b>would</b> <b>be</b> no great burden; but <b>certainly,</b> Armstrong <b>would</b> <b>be</b> pleased {{to know that}} you had seen his daughters." ...|$|R
60|$|PRINCE PAUL. You {{ought to}} remember, too, Professor, {{that if you}} were seized, as you {{probably}} would be, and hung, as you <b>certainly</b> <b>would</b> <b>be,</b> there would be nobody left to read your own articles.|$|E
6000|$|... "Thank {{you very}} much, Colonel. That <b>certainly</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> of assistance. It is only {{of an evening}} {{that he would be}} wanted, for we are quite agreed that these {{meetings}} are sure to take place after dark." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Ah, I {{remember}} now,' {{replied the}} donkey, 'but the stones return so quickly to their places, that you <b>certainly</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> crushed to death {{unless you have}} in your hands a bunch of crowsfoot and of five-leaved trefoil.' ...|$|E
50|$|At a {{time when}} there was {{widespread}} despair amongst the farming community, Chalam persuaded the farmers to cultivate drought resistant TN-1 and staved off what <b>certainly</b> <b>would</b> have <b>been</b> another catastrophic famine in India.|$|R
6000|$|... "It <b>certainly</b> <b>would</b> have <b>been</b> better {{taste in}} {{him to tell}} her," [...] said Bernard, frowning, [...] "and not let other people see how little {{communication}} there is between them. It has mortified her." ...|$|R
60|$|But at {{any rate}} {{it was clear that}} there was no room in his heart for the {{beauteous}} Clementina, 'doosed fine girl' as she undoubtedly was, and serviceable as the £20,000 most <b>certainly</b> <b>would</b> have <b>been.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... 'And to take care,' said Mr. Wickfield, 'that you're not imposed on, eh? As you <b>certainly</b> <b>would</b> <b>be,</b> in any {{contract}} {{you should}} make for yourself. Well! I am ready. There are worse tasks than that, in my calling.' ...|$|E
60|$|With that {{he hurried}} a little faster, {{and then he}} saw what Longlegs was {{watching}} so intently. It was, as you know, Grandfather Frog sitting on his big green lily-pad. Old Whitetail gave a great sigh of satisfaction. Grandfather Frog <b>certainly</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> very filling, very filling, indeed.|$|E
6000|$|... "It is evidently {{something}} about Harry," [...] {{he said to}} himself; [...] "possibly she has taken the idea into her head that he may {{fall in love with}} Agnes. That, <b>certainly,</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> a very nice thing; but I don't suppose it is anything more than an idea of mother's." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, that <b>would</b> <b>be</b> possible--yes, <b>certainly</b> it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> possible. But {{think of}} her position--the house full of wedding presents--guests coming from a distance. It is awful. And you {{say there is no}} alternative." ...|$|R
60|$|In {{that last}} resolve I {{think we may}} {{say that he was}} right. If Lily would ever listen to him again at all, she <b>certainly</b> <b>would</b> not <b>be</b> deterred from marrying him by his own story of his debts.|$|R
25|$|It {{has been}} said that Richard Wagner’s late career is part of Ludwig’s legacy, since he almost <b>certainly</b> <b>would</b> have <b>been</b> unable to {{complete}} his opera cycle Der Ring des Nibelungen or to write his final opera, Parsifal, without the king’s support.|$|R
6000|$|... "That's {{all very}} well," [...] Norgate assented. [...] "It might be our fair share on paper, {{and yet it}} might not be enough. What about our navy if Antwerp, Ostend, Dunkirk, Calais, Boulogne, and Havre were all German ports, as they <b>certainly</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> in an unassisted {{conflict}} between the French and the Germans?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That {{shows how}} disinterested you are, as you <b>certainly</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> in office. Good-bye. Come {{and see the}} Duchess when she comes to town. And if you've nothing better to do, give us {{a day or two}} at Longroyston at Easter." [...] Now Longroyston was the Duke's {{well-known}} country seat, at which Whig hospitality had been dispensed with a lavish hand for two centuries.|$|E
6000|$|... "I am {{glad you}} see it in that way, sir. I own {{that it would be a}} great {{satisfaction}} to have him with me. He <b>certainly</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> a cheery companion, and I should say that he is as hard as nails, and can stand as much fatigue and hardship as myself. Besides, there is no doubt that in case of any trouble two men are better than one." ...|$|E
60|$|The {{meeting was}} unsatisfactory. Some of the {{citizens}} pretended {{that they did not}} recognize De la Noue, saying that the person they knew was a brave gentleman, faithful to his religion, and one who <b>certainly</b> <b>would</b> not <b>be</b> found in a Catholic camp.|$|R
6000|$|... "I suppose," [...] {{said the}} young man, [...] "that {{as she went}} away on foot she must be staying {{with some of the}} neighbors. If we were to make inquiries, it <b>certainly</b> <b>would</b> not <b>be</b> {{difficult}} to find out where she is." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, that <b>would</b> <b>be</b> possible. Yes, <b>certainly,</b> it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> possible. But {{think of}} her position. The house full of wedding presents--guests coming from a distance. It is awful. And you {{say that there is}} no alternative." ...|$|R
6000|$|And so, {{from point}} to point, he progressed till with fine indignation he reached a {{resolution}} to stay and meet whatever came. [...] "I <b>certainly</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> a timorous animal if I let myself be scared into flight by that big bonehead," [...] he said at last. [...] "I have as much right here as he has, and the law must protect me. It can't be that this country is entirely barbaric." ...|$|E
60|$|Madison Clay smiled grimly, {{pushed back}} his chair, rose, dropped a {{perfunctory}} kiss on his daughter's hair, and, taking his shotgun from the corner, departed on a peaceful Samaritan mission to a cow who had dropped a calf {{in the far}} pasture. Inclined as he was to Reuben's wooing from his eligibility as to property, he was conscious that he was sadly deficient in certain qualities inherent in the Clay family. It <b>certainly</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> a kind of mesalliance.|$|E
6000|$|... "Before I leave I {{shall be}} glad to see her, Sir Peregrine; but if I am {{justified}} in regarding you as specially her friend, it may perhaps be well that I should first have some conversation with you." [...] Sir Peregrine in answer to this declared that Mr. Furnival <b>certainly</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> so justified; that he did regard himself as Lady Mason's special friend, {{and that he was}} ready to hear anything that the barrister might have to say to him.|$|E
60|$|Perhaps Cecil {{could not}} <b>be</b> gracious. <b>Certainly,</b> Raymond <b>would</b> have <b>been</b> thankful for even this admission.|$|R
2500|$|Essendon did not {{actually}} agree to play the match until {{the night before the}} game; and, ultimately, this [...] "in doubt until the last minute match" [...] was still attended by 16,538 paying spectators (it <b>certainly</b> <b>would</b> have <b>been</b> a much larger crowd otherwise).|$|R
60|$|All at {{the table}} had risen with Ramiro, and now, copying their leader, they bared their heads in outward token of such respect as <b>certainly</b> <b>would</b> have <b>been</b> felt by any men less {{abandoned}} than were they before so much saintly beauty and distress.|$|R
