5|$|The {{indigenous}} {{people of the}} Eastern U.S.A. domesticated numerous crops. Sunflowers, tobacco, varieties of squash and <b>Chenopodium,</b> as well as crops no longer grown, including marsh elder and little barley, were domesticated. Wild foods including wild rice and maple sugar were harvested. The most common varieties of strawberry were domesticated from Eastern North America. Two major crops, pecans and Concord grapes, were utilized extensively in prehistoric times but {{do not appear to}} have been domesticated until the 19th century.|$|E
5|$|The {{summit of}} Mount Elbert is an alpine environment, {{featuring}} {{plants such as}} Phacelia sericea (sky-pilot), Hymenoxys grandiflora (old-man-of-the-mountain), and Geum rossii (alpine avens). Also noted are Carex atrata var. pullata, Salix desertorum, Platanthera hyperborea, Thalictrum fendleri, Aquilegia canadensis, <b>Chenopodium</b> album, Gentiana detonsa var. hallii, and Bigelovia parryi. Below treeline the mountain is heavily forested, with the lower slopes covered {{with a mixture of}} lodgepole pine, spruce, aspen and fir.|$|E
5|$|The white-winged fairywren is {{primarily}} insectivorous; its diet includes small beetles, bugs, moths, praying mantises, caterpillars, and smaller insects, including spiders. The larger insects are typically fed to nestlings by the breeding female and her helpers, including the breeding male. Adults and juveniles forage by hopping along the shrubland floor, and may supplement their diets with seeds and fruits of saltbush (Rhagodia), goosefoot (<b>Chenopodium)</b> and new shoots of samphire. During spring and summer, birds {{are active in}} bursts through the day and accompany their foraging with song. Insects are numerous and easy to catch, which allows the birds to rest between forays. The group often shelters and rests together during {{the heat of the}} day. Food is harder to find during winter and they are required to spend the day foraging continuously.|$|E
25|$|Some species, such as spinach (Spinacia oleracea) or {{forms of}} beet (Beta vulgaris) (beetroot, chard), {{are used as}} vegetables. Forms of Beta vulgaris include fodder beet (Mangelwurzel) and sugar beet. The seeds of Amaranthus, lamb's {{quarters}} (<b>Chenopodium</b> berlandieri), quinoa (<b>Chenopodium</b> quinoa) and kañiwa (<b>Chenopodium</b> pallidicaule) are edible and are used as pseudocereals.|$|E
25|$|Other {{plants of}} the EAC include little barley (Hordeum pusillum), {{goosefoot}} or lambsquarters (<b>Chenopodium</b> berlandieri), erect knotweed (Polygonum erectum), maygrass (Phalaris caroliniana), sumpweed or marsh elder (Iva annua), and sunflower (Helianthus annuus).|$|E
25|$|The initial four plants {{known to}} have been domesticated were {{goosefoot}} (<b>Chenopodium</b> berlandieri), sunflower (Helianthus annuus var. macroscarpus), marshelder (Iva annua var. macrocarpa), and squash (Cucurbita pepo ssp. ovifera). Several other species of plants were later domesticated.|$|E
25|$|Seventeen {{vegetation}} {{classes have}} been identified in the Yanga National Park, with more than 300 plant species being recorded. River red gum forest/woodland, black box woodland, lignum/nitre goosefoot (<b>Chenopodium</b> nitrariaceum) shrubland, and spike rush (Eleocharis spp.) dominated sedgeland are identified as important vegetation classes in the area.|$|E
25|$|Some seeds {{usually made}} into gruel in {{historical}} times are acorn and manna grass (Glyceria fluitans). Roots {{of the sea}} beet, Beta maritima, were prepared as well. That species is ancestral to modern domestic beets. Greens could have been boiled from nettle (Urtica dioica), orache (Atriplex) and goosefoot (<b>Chenopodium</b> album).|$|E
25|$|Goosefoot, also {{referred}} to as <b>Chenopodium,</b> is a small flowering plant with edible seeds that may have been cultivated in small gardens. The evidence for this is uncertain, however. This also leads to an uncertainty in the timeframe of the suspected cultivation (believed to be during Archaic or Woodland periods).|$|E
25|$|In {{gathering}} the seeds some were undoubtedly {{dropped in the}} sunny environment and disturbed soil of a settlement, and those seeds sprouted and thrived. Over time the seeds were sown and the ground was cleared of any competitive vegetation. The seeds which germinated quickest (i.e. thinner seed coats) and the plants which grew fastest were {{the most likely to}} be tended, harvested, and replanted. Through a process of unconscious selection and, later, conscious selection, the domesticated weeds became more productive. The seeds of some species became substantially larger and/or their seed coats were less thick compared to the wild plants. For example, the seed coats of domesticated <b>chenopodium</b> is less than 20 microns thick; the wild <b>chenopodium</b> of the same species is 40 to 60 microns thick. Conversely, when Indians quit growing these plants, as they did later, their seeds reverted within a few years to the thickness they had been in the wild.|$|E
25|$|By 1800 BC, Indians were {{cultivating}} {{several different}} plants. The Riverton Site in the Wabash River valley of Illinois, near {{the present day}} village of Palestine, {{is one of the}} best known early sites of cultivation. Ten house sites have been discovered at Riverton, indicating a population of 50 to 100 people in the community. Among the hearths and storage pits associated with the houses, archaeologists found a large number of plant remains, including a large number of seeds of chenopods (goosefoot or lamb's quarters) which are likely cultivated plants. Some of the chenopod (<b>Chenopodium</b> berlandieri) seeds had husks only one third as thick as wild seeds. Riverton farmers had bred them selectively to produce a seed easier to access than wild varieties of the same plant.|$|E
25|$|The Przewalski horse's diet {{consists}} {{mostly of}} vegetation. There are many plant species {{in a typical}} Przewalski horse environment including: Elymus repens, Carex spp., Fabaceae, and Asteraceae. While the horses eat {{a variety of different}} plant species, they tend to favor one species during a specific time of the year. In other words, the Przewalski horses have seasonal food preferences. In the springtime, Przewalski horses favor Elymus repens, Corynephorus canescens, Festuca valesiaca, and <b>Chenopodium</b> album. In early summer they favor Dactylis glomerata and Trifolium and in late summer, they gravitate towards Elymus repens and Vicia cracca. In winter, for example, the horses eat Salix spp., Pyrus communis, Malus sylvatica, Pinus sylvestris, Rosa spp., and Alnus spp. Additionally, Przewalski horses may dig for Festuca spp., Bromus inermis and Elymus repens that grow beneath the ice and snow. The Przewalski horse’s winter diet is very similar to the diet of domestic horses. Studies have suggested that in the wintertime, Przewalski horses experience hypodermis. Hypodermis is a condition in which one’s metabolic rate slows down. This means that in the winter time, Przewalski horse’s process their food more slowly than they do during other times of the year. Looking at the species diet overall, however, Przewalski horses most often eat Elymus repens, Trifolium pratense, Vicia cracca, Poa trivialis, Dactylis glomerata and Bromus inermis.|$|E
500|$|The {{black bean}} aphid [...] can feed {{on a wide}} variety of host plants. Its primary hosts on which the eggs overwinter are shrubs such as the spindle tree (Euonymus europaeus), Viburnum species, or the mock-orange (Philadelphus species). Its {{secondary}} hosts, on which it spends the summer, include a number of crops including [...] sugar beets, spinach, beans, runner beans, celery, potatoes, sunflowers, carrots, artichokes, tobacco, and tomatoes. It colonises more than two hundred different species of cultivated and wild plants. Among the latter, it shows a preference for poppies (Papaver species), burdock (Arctium tomentonum), fat-hen (<b>Chenopodium</b> album), saltbush (Atriplex rosea), chamomile (Matricaria chamomilla), thistles (Cirsium arvense), and docks (Rumex spp.).|$|E
500|$|A. brownii has a {{very limited}} range; it is found only on the [...] island of Nihoa, located [...] {{northwest}} of Kauai. It is thought that this endemic plant has probably always been rare and restricted to Nihoa. Its habitat is managed by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service and protected {{as part of the}} Hawaiian Islands National Wildlife Refuge in the Papahānaumokuākea Marine National Monument. A. brownii is one of three endemic and endangered species only found on Nihoa, along with the Nihoa fan palm (Pritchardia remota) and the Nihoa carnation (Schiedea verticillata). At least nine other native plant species can be found in its habitat, including Hawaiian goosefoot (<b>Chenopodium</b> oahuense), lovegrass (Eragrostis variablis), koali awa (Ipomoea indica), goat's foot (Ipomoea pes-caprae subsp. brasiliensis), Panicum torridum, naupakas (Scaevola sericea), Sicyos pachycarpus, ilima (Sida fallax), and Nelson's horsenettle (Solanum nelsonii).|$|E
2500|$|The {{generic name}} Dysphania {{traditionally}} was {{applied in the}} 1930s to some species endemic to Australia. Placement and rank of this taxon have ranged from a mere section in <b>Chenopodium</b> to the sole genus of a separate family Dysphaniaceae, or a representative of Illicebraceae. The close affinity of Dysphania to [...] "glandular" [...] species of <b>Chenopodium</b> sensu lato is now evident.|$|E
2500|$|Oil of <b>chenopodium</b> {{is derived}} from this plant. Merriam-Webster defines it as [...] "a colorless or pale yellow toxic {{essential}} oil of unpleasant odor and taste, ... formerly used as an anthelmintic".|$|E
2500|$|Dysphania ambrosioides, {{formerly}} <b>Chenopodium</b> ambrosioides, {{known as}} wormseed, Jesuit's tea, Mexican-tea, payqu (paico), epazote, [...] or herba sancti Mariæ, is an annual or short-lived perennial herb native to Central America, South America, and southern Mexico.|$|E
2500|$|... 'Fairchance Mound and Village' of Marshall County, West Virginia is a Middle Woodland complex. The mound {{artifacts}} carbon {{dates to}} the 3rd century CE. One of the tombs in the mound is unique in being a stone lined crypt. This [...] "crypt" [...] was simply a layer of [...] "slab-stone" [...] covering the mound with more dirt placed over the [...] "sheets" [...] of stone. This was not [...] a [...] "boxed-in crypt." [...] This {{should not be confused}} with the centuries later Hadden Phase (1100–1600 CE) Hadden site (15To1) mortuaray complex (Allen 1977:14) stone box grave and stone slab-lined crematory cist of the Kentucky Western Coal Fields Section. The Fairchance village pottery included Watson Ware that was lime stone tempered. The stone points were Fairchance-notched and Snyders points. The foods found through screening were the semi-domesticated [...] "wild plants" [...] listed in the summary below for this period. The nearby Watson Farm village dated between 1600 and 1400 BP and its small, one-meter high mound also contained a stone crypt. The limestone tempered Watson Ware along with a limited amount of grit-tempered Mahoning Ware was found. Flotation samples were performed at this site, but, these have not been analyzed by botanical specialists. Either wild or domesticated <b>Chenopodium,</b> goosefoot, was found. These Middle Woodland people subsisted primarily on wild plants, animals, fish, and shellfish. Each site had a single circular structure found, which may be due to limited excavation.|$|E
2500|$|The {{introduction}} of pottery, its widespread use, {{and the increased}} sophistication of its forms and decoration, first believed to have occurred around 1,000 BCE, is a major demarcation of the Woodland era. Archaic pots were thick, heavy, and fragile, but Woodland pottery pots were more intricately designed, and had more uses, such as for cooking and storing surplus food. Woodland peoples also used baskets and gourds for containers too. Around 200BCE, maize production migrated to the eastern United States from Mexico. The {{introduction of}} corn is when Kentucky natives slowly changed from growing indigenous plants to a maize based agricultural economy. In addition to cultivating corn, the Woodland people also cultivated giant ragweeds, amaranth (pigweed), and maygrass. The initial four plants {{known to have been}} domesticated were goosefoot (<b>Chenopodium</b> berlandieri), sunflower (Helianthus annuus var. macroscarpus), marshelder (Iva annua var. macrocarpa), and squash (Cucurbita pepo ssp. ovifera) (gourds). Woodland people raised tobacco in their gardens which they used for smoking. Woodland people still used ground stone tools, especially for processing nuts and seeds. They mined both Mammoth Cave and Salts Cave for gypsum and mirabilite, a salty seasoning. Shellfish was still an important part of their diets, and the most common prey was white-tailed deer. Spears also continued to be made, but late in the Woodland era, the straight bow became the typical weapon of choice in the eastern United States, which is illustrated by the reduction in size of arrowheads. In addition to bows and arrows, some southeastern Woodland peoples also used blowguns. Between 100 BCE and 450BC, the native Americans in Kentucky begin to build burial mounds, which indicates social change. The Woodland Indians buried their dead in conical, and then later flat, or oval-shaped, burial mounds, which were often [...] high (like Serpent Mound). This practice resulted in the Woodland people being called the Mound Builders by 19th-century observers.|$|E
6000|$|... 3. Phelipoea lutea, Desf. A dark, fleshy broom-rape, with scaly leaves. We {{have one}} {{species of the}} same genus in England. They are {{parasitic}} on the roots of plants; and the Midianite species, which is found in North Africa, Egypt, and Arabia, grows on the roots of a <b>Chenopodium.</b>|$|E
60|$|The large village, at {{the time}} of our visit, was gay with holiday dresses. It is {{surrounded}} by trees, chiefly of banyan, jack, mango, peepul, and tamarind: interminable rice-fields extend on all sides, and except bananas, slender betel-nut palms, and sometimes pawn, or betel-pepper, there is little other extensive cultivation. The rose-apple, orange, and pine-apple are rare, as are cocoa-nuts: there are few date or fan-palms, and only occasionally poor crops of castor-oil and sugar-cane. In the gardens I noticed jasmine, Justicia Adhatoda, Hibiscus, and others of the very commonest Indian ornamental plants; while for food were cultivated <b>Chenopodium,</b> yams, sweet potatos, and more rarely peas, beans, and gourds. Bamboos were planted round the little properties and smaller clusters of houses, in oblong squares, the ridge on which the plants grew being usually bounded by a shallow ditch. The species selected was not the most graceful of its family; the stems, or culms, being densely crowded, erect, as thick at the base as the arm, copiously branching, and very feathery throughout their whole length of sixty feet.|$|E
6000|$|There {{were other}} open spaces {{covered with a}} {{vegetation}} almost as interesting as the canes and the trees: this was where what were called [...] "weeds" [...] were allowed to flourish. Here were the thorn-apple, <b>chenopodium,</b> sow-thistle, wild mustard, redweed, viper's bugloss, and others, both native and introduced, in dense thickets five or six feet high. It was difficult to push one's way through these thickets, and one was always in dread of treading on a snake. At another spot fennel flourished by itself, {{as if it had}} some mysterious power, perhaps its peculiar smell, of keeping other plants at a proper distance. It formed quite a thicket, and grew to a height of ten or twelve feet. This spot was a favourite haunt of mine, as it was in a waste place at the furthest point from the house, a wild solitary spot where I could spend long hours by myself watching the birds. But I also loved the fennel for itself, its beautiful green feathery foliage and the smell of it, also the taste, so that whenever I visited that secluded spot I would rub the crushed leaves in my palms and chew the small twigs for their peculiar fennel flavour.|$|E
60|$|We {{embarked}} {{again at}} Chittagong on the 16th of January, at 10 p.m., for Calcutta, {{in a very}} large vessel, rowed by twelve men: we made wretchedly slow progress, for the reasons mentioned earlier, being for four days within sight of Chittagong! On the 20th we only reached Sidhee, and thence made a stretch to Hattiah, an island which {{may be said to}} be moving bodily to the westward, the Megna annually cutting many acres from the east side; and the tide-wave depositing mud on the west. The surface is flat, and raised four feet above mean high-water level; the tide rises about 14 feet up the bank, and then retires for miles; the total rise and fall is, however, much less here than in the Fenny, higher up the gulf. The turf is composed of Cynodon and a Fimbristylis; and the earth being impregnated with salt, supports different kinds of <b>Chenopodium.</b> Two kinds of tamarisk, and a thorny Cassia and Exoecaria, are the only shrubs on the eastern islands; on the central ones a few dwarf mangroves appear, with the holly-leaved Dilivaria, dwarf screw-pine (Pandanus), a shrub of Compositae, and a curious fern, a variety of Aristichum aureum. Towards the northern end of Hattiah, Talipot, cocoa-nut and date-palms appear.|$|E
60|$|On {{my arrival}} I found the villagers in a meadow, all squatted cross-legged in a circle, smoking their brass and iron pipes, {{drinking}} tea, {{and listening to}} {{a letter from the}} Rajah, concerning their treatment of me. Whilst my men were pitching my tent, I gathered forty plants new to me, all of Tartarian types.* [More Siberian plants appeared, as Astragali, <b>Chenopodium,</b> Artemisia, some grasses, new kinds of Pedicularis, Delphinium, and some small Orchids. Three species of Parnassia and six primroses made the turf gay, mixed with saxifrages, Androsace and Campanula. By the cottages was abundance of shepherd's-purse, Lepidium, and balsams, with dock, Galeopsis, and Cuscuta. Several low dwarf species of honeysuckle formed stunted bushes like heather; and Anisodus, a curious plant allied to Hyoscyamus, whose leaves are greedily eaten by yaks, was very common.] Wheat or barley I was assured had been cultivated at Tungu when it was possessed by Tibetans, and inhabited by a frontier guard, but I saw no appearance of any cultivation. The fact is an important one, as barley requires a mean summer temperature of 48 degrees to come to maturity. According to my observations, the mean temperature of Tungu in July is upwards of 50 degrees, and, by calculation, that of the three summer months, June, July, and August, should be about 46.5 degrees. As, however, I do not know whether these cerealia were grown as productive crops, much stress cannot be laid upon the fact of their having been cultivated, for in a great many parts of Tibet the barley is annually cut green for fodder.|$|E
60|$|Yet I am {{prepared}} to believe that some seeds, especially small ones, may retain their vitality for centuries under favorable circumstances. In the spring of 1859, the old Hunt House, so called, in this town, whose chimney bore the date 1703, was taken down. This stood on land which belonged to John Winthrop, the first Governor of Massachusetts, {{and a part of}} the house was evidently much older than the above date, and belonged to the Winthrop family. For many years, I have ransacked this neighborhood for plants, and I consider myself familiar with its productions. Thinking of the seeds which are said to be sometimes dug up at an unusual depth in the earth, and thus to reproduce long extinct plants, it occurred to me last fall that some new or rare plants might have sprung up in the cellar of this house, which had been covered from the light so long. Searching there on the 22d of September, I found, among other rank weeds, a species of nettle (Urtica urens), which I had not found before; dill, which I had not seen growing spontaneously; the Jerusalem oak (<b>Chenopodium</b> botrys), which I had seen wild in but one place; black nightshade (Solanum nigrum), which is quite rare hereabouts, and common tobacco, which, though it was often cultivated here in the last century, has for fifty years been an unknown plant in this town, and a few months before this not even I had heard that one man in the north part of the town, was cultivating a few plants for his own use. I have no doubt that some or all of these plants sprang from seeds which had long been buried under or about that house, and that that tobacco is an additional evidence that the plant was formerly cultivated here. The cellar has been filled up this year, and four of those plants, including the tobacco, are now again extinct in that locality.|$|E
