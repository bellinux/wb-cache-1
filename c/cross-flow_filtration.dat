2500|$|Most {{filtration}} in a winery can {{be classified}} as either the coarser depth filtration or the finer surface filtration. In depth filtration, often done after fermentation, the wine is pushed through {{a thick layer of}} pads made from cellulose fibers, diatomaceous earth, or perlite.

The finest surface filtration, microfiltration, can sterilize the wine by trapping all yeast and, optionally, bacteria, and so is often done immediately prior to bottling. An absolute rated filter of 0.45µm is generally considered to result in a microbially stable wine and is accomplished by the use of membrane cartridges, most commonly polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF). Certain red wines may be filtered to 0.65µm, to remove yeast, or to 1.0µm to remove viable brettanomyces only.|$|E

This study investigated the impact of electrical fields applied to <b>cross-flow</b> membrane <b>filtration</b> on electrolysis and the associated electrochemical modification of functional dairy-based peptides to calculate the electrical load of target analytes during the process. Firstly, electrolysis and the hypochlorite-induced oxidation of the model peptide β-CN f(108 – 113) and lactose at different hypochlorite concentrations were studied under well-controlled laboratory conditions, followed by the electrochemical modification of functional peptides during <b>cross-flow</b> electro membrane <b>filtration.</b> At laboratory conditions, a chemical modification of the model peptide β-CN f(108 – 113) below a value of 3  mol.

The electrochemical modification of functional peptides was only observed for voltages ≥ 10  V in <b>cross-flow</b> electro membrane <b>filtration</b> experiments. In addition, results indicate that a further increase in electrical voltage (> 5  V) does not result in a significant improvement of peptide electrophoresis, and thus, there is no higher fractionation of functional peptides.

40|$|The fouling {{behavior}} of microstructured hollow fiber membranes {{was investigated in}} <b>cross-flow</b> <b>filtrations</b> of colloidal silica and yeast. In addition to the as-fabricated microstructured fibers, twisted fibers made by twisting the microstructured fibers around their own axes were tested and compared to round fibers. In silica filtrations, the three different fibers showed similar behavior and increasing Reynolds number increased the critical fluxes significantly. In yeast filtrations, the twisted fiber performed similar to the round fiber and better than the structured fiber. Among the three fibers, during yeast filtrations the critical flux for irreversibility was highest for the twisted fiber. The Reynolds number {{had little effect on}} the critical fluxes for particle deposition, which was attributed to the strong adsorption of yeast particles on the membrane. On the other hand, the critical fluxes for irreversibility increased with increasing Reynolds number for all three fibers. Direct visual observation of yeast particles {{on the surface of the}} three different hollow fibers revealed that for the structured and twisted fibers, the initial deposition rate on the fins is much lower than that in the grooves. This is attributed to the shear-induced migration of the yeast particles from areas of high shear (fins) to those of low shear (grooves). Furthermore, on the fins of the twisted fiber the deposition rate was lower than that on the fins of the structured fiber. This observation, together with the observed high critical fluxes for the twisted fiber led to the conclusion that the twisting induces a secondary flow in the liquid. This secondary flow is effective in depolarizing the buildup of micron-sized yeast particles since the diffusion of these particles is strongly effected by gradients in shear rate. On the other hand, for the silica colloids which are much smaller, shear-induced diffusion is not significant and twisting does not have an improving effect on filtratio...|$|R

The effects of pore size; applied pressure; cross-flow velocity; and detergent concentration on rejection of O/W emulsion and flux were systematically studied. At the condition achieving complete separation of O/W emulsion the pressure-independent flux was observed and this flux behavior was explained by gel-polarization model. The O/W emulsion tended to permeate through the membrane at the conditions of larger pore size; higher emulsion concentration; and higher pressure.

However, the correlation between adsorption and log D value (the logarithm of the octanol-water distribution coefficient) of the TrOCs (which indicates their hydrophobicity) observed in this study was rather weak. This is due to the adsorption being not only dependent on hydrophobicity, but also on other physicochemical aspects of TrOCs and the membrane material, such as molecular size, charge of the compounds, pore size, charge, and surface roughness properties of the membranes. Therefore, the results suggest that these factors may also govern the adsorption (and subsequently rejection) of TrOCs to NF/RO membranes...|$|R

In this study, a unified CP model was developed for the quantification of the CP formation of colloidal particles. The basic methods adopted in previous models such as mass balance equation accounting for particle diffusion and convection, disintegration of the solid pressure and osmotic pressure and derivation of particle drift velocity are kept. In the new model, the hydrodynamic lift force is {{taken into account in}} the force balance equations and shear-induced diffusion is included in the particle transport process. The simulation results show that the inter-particle interactions and the hydrodynamic lift force are predominant for relatively small and large particles, respectively. More specifically, while the inter-particle interactions are important for relatively small (e. g. 2. a=. 10. nm) particles, the hydrodynamic lift force dominates for relatively large particles (e. g. 2. a=. 1. μm). Neither inter-particle interactions nor hydrodynamic lift forces {{play a significant role in}} CP formation of sub-micro particles (e. g. 2. a=. 100. nm), for which the solid fraction buildup within the CP formation is most severe. For filtration of relatively large particles under a fixed hydrodynamic condition, it appears that there is a critical flux, over which the particle deposition rate will increase dramatically.

The ceramicmembranes used were alpha-alumina membranes with a pore size of 100 nm. Some ofthe membranes were coated with a gamma-alumina layer to reduce the membrane pore size to 10 nm, {{and some of them}} were modified with different metal oxides in order to change the surface properties of the membranes. The effects of operationparameters, such as <b>cross-flow</b> velocity, <b>filtration</b> pressure and backflushing on filtration performance were studied. The measured parameters were the permeateflux, the quality of the permeate, as well as the fouling tendency of the membrane. A dynamic membrane or a cake layer forming on top of the membrane was observed to decrease the flux and increase separa-tion of certain substances, especially at low cross-flow velocities. When the cross-flow velocities were increased the membrane properties became more important. Backflushing could also be used to decrease the thickness of the cake layer and thus it improved the permeate flux. However, backflushing can lead to a reduction of retentions in cases where the cake layer is improving them. The wastewater quality was important for the thickness of the dynamic membrane and the membrane pore size influenced the permeate flux.

40|$|Shear induced {{diffusion}} {{can be used}} {{to induce}} particle migration in flow, and this may be a lead to novel separation technology. Under specific conditions, depending on, amongst others, the ratio between channel height and particle diameter, larger particles preferentially move to the centre of a channel. It has been demonstrated earlier that separation and fractionation can be facilitated by this, leading to lower energy and water demand, and prevention of particle accumulation on sieves that have pores that are much larger than the particles. This situation is very different from regular (<b>cross-flow)</b> membrane <b>filtration,</b> in which particles are retained by the pores, and accumulate in various layers. Unfortunately, the underlying mechanisms of particle migration are not that well understood, and contradicting results are reported in literature. There is clearly a need for a unifying approach that can be used by many; therefore, we developed a CFD computer model that can readily be used, unlike the rather inaccessible computer models that are mostly reported in literature. We focus on particle–particle interactions of monodisperse suspensions in flow, for which we added momentum terms to the general momentum equation. We found amongst others that due to shear induced diffusion the particle volume fraction will be 1. 7 times higher at the centre of the channel compared to the channel wall for a bulk particle volume fraction of 50 %. Our results describe the experimental results, obtained under similar ideal conditions, to a high level of detail. Our findings are also in reasonable agreement with other modelling and experimental studies from literature, and the discrepancies are most probably due to non-ideal behaviour in the experiments and different approaches used in the models. The big advantage of using this software is that the model can be adapted readily by researchers not specifically trained in modelling or programming, but even more importantly, particle migration can now be used as a starting point in separation design since parameter and geometry studies will take less effort using this software. </p...|$|R
