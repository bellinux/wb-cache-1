6000|$|When, {{with only}} Annis following, the {{chambers}} had been reached, Eleanor let herself sink on a <b>cushion,</b> hiding her <b>face</b> against her friend, and sobbing hysterically-- ...|$|R
60|$|And so {{they were}} silent, and he, {{reclining}} on the <b>cushions,</b> watched her <b>face</b> and saw her smile and wondered what was passing in her mind to cause that smile. Doubtless {{it was something to}} do with the question of her disguising arts.|$|R
60|$|But Dea Flavia's {{interest}} in the narrative seemed suddenly to have flagged. She stretched her arms, yawned ostentatiously, and with the movement of a fretful child she threw herself once more flat upon the couch, with her elbows in the <b>cushions</b> and her <b>face</b> buried in her hands.|$|R
25|$|The church's box pews have hinged doors, {{scrolled}} armrests {{and seat}} <b>cushions.</b> They all <b>face</b> {{forward on the}} ground floor except for the two rows in the front. On the upstairs galleries they face the opposite wall. Metal and marble memorial plaques line the walls, and a door on the northwest side leads to the tower vestibule.|$|R
60|$|His friend {{closed the}} door, and looked restlessly towards {{the spot where}} his niece still {{remained}} in the attitude {{in which he had}} left her. She had flung herself heavily upon the couch, and with her head drooping over the <b>cushion,</b> and her <b>face</b> hidden in her hands, seemed to be still weeping in an agony of shame and grief.|$|R
60|$|Lister {{went up the}} steps, and {{entering}} the big room, saw Montgomery in a Madeira chair. His face was wet by sweat, but although his thin form was covered by a blanket he shook with ague. Brown occupied a rude couch, made from two long boxes in which flintlock guns are shipped. He lay in an ungainly pose, his head had fallen from a <b>cushion,</b> and his <b>face</b> was dark with blood. His eyes were shut and he breathed with a snoring noise.|$|R
60|$|Most {{clearly there}} stands out {{a picture of}} {{ourselves}} talking in a gondola {{on our way to}} Torcella. Far away behind us the smoke of Murano forms a black stain upon an immense shining prospect of smooth water, water as unruffled and luminous as the sky above, a mirror on which rows of posts and distant black high-stemmed, swan-necked boats with their minutely clear swinging gondoliers, float aerially. Remote and low before us rises the little tower of our destination. Our men swing together and their oars swirl leisurely through the water, hump back in the rowlocks, splash sharply and go swishing back again. Margaret lies back on <b>cushions,</b> with her <b>face</b> shaded by a holland parasol, and I sit up beside her.|$|R
5000|$|I {{came across}} a short film {{recently}} which blew everything else I had seen that week out of the water. After it was over, {{there was no question}} of doing anything other than lying on the sofa with a <b>cushion</b> on my <b>face,</b> whimpering in fear and paranoia. 'Soft' is shocking and violent, and ingeniously, intimately upsetting in a way I can only compare to the controversial scenes in Gaspar Noé's Irréversible. The film reminded me of an essay I read by the late Alexander Walker about Kubrick's A Clockwork Orange: that the film was not merely about violence but about something deeper, darker, more unsayable: a fear of our children, and older people's fear and hatred of the young.

40|$|Thesis (MTech. {{degree in}} Business Information Systems.) [...] Tshwane University of Technology, 2010. The lack of {{ubiquitous}} social presence of instructors, tutors and knowledgeable experts {{was seen as}} a research problem, where the above are not always available for consultation should a learner face a learning challenge. With the existence of Web 2. 0, there are opportunities to <b>cushion</b> those challenges <b>faced</b> by learners, by incorporating a personal learning environment. The activity and social presence theories were used as lenses, to understand learner interactions (whose outcome is personalized learning) provided by varied Web 2. 0 tools. The research argument was, therefore, that Web 2. 0 could help learners achieve personalized learning support, in varied learning contexts. The evidence shows that different applications available in a Web 2. 0 environment creates a personalized learning environment for learners to interact, share knowledge and collaborate, with those who are not in the same location...|$|R
60|$|Jimmy {{took the}} tray, but, as it happened, the Sorata lurched on the wash from a passing steamer {{as he went}} through the sliding door in the bulk-head, and, {{plunging}} into the saloon with arms stretched out, he fell against the table. It was a moment or two before he partly recovered his equanimity, and then, as he looked about him, a hoarse laugh fell through the open skylights. To make things worse, he fancied that the elderly gentleman cast a suspicious glance at him, while he was quite sure that there was a twinkle in one of the young ladies' eyes. She leaned back somewhat wearily upon a locker <b>cushion,</b> and her <b>face</b> was thin and fragile; but her companion sat upright, and Jimmy saw that she also was regarding him. She was tall and somewhat large of frame, with a quiet face that had something patrician in it, and reposeful brown eyes. Jimmy fancied that she and the others must have heard the laugh above.|$|R
6000|$|Once {{or twice}} he showed {{surprise}} at visits {{from his mother}} or Philip, who had then been entirely kept away from him, and about Christmas he brightened so much, and awoke to things about him so much more fully, that Cecily thought the time of recollection could not be much longer deferred. Any noise, however, seemed so painful to him, that the Christmas festivities were held at Combe Manor instead of Hurst Walwyn; only after church, Sir Marmaduke and Lady Thistlewood came in {{to make him a}} visit, as he sat in a large easy-chair by his bedroom-fire, resting after having gone through as much of the rites of the day as he was able for, with Mr. Adderlay. The room looked very cheerful with the bright wood-fire on the open hearth, shining on the gay tapestry hangings, and the dark wood of the carved bed. The evergreen-decked window shimmered with sun shine, and even the patient, leaning back among crimson <b>cushions,</b> though his <b>face</b> and head were ghastly enough wherever they were not covered with patches and bandages, still had a pleasant smile with lip and eye to thank his stepfather for his cheery wishes of 'a merry Christmas, at least one better in health.' ...|$|R
5000|$|Caledonian Mercury, Edinburgh, Thursday, June 14, 1849 reported: [...] "Mr John Croall, the enterprising coach-builder {{and coach}} {{proprietor}} of this city, is now manufacturing an extensive series of mail coaches for the Emperor of Russia. Each coach weighs about twenty-two hundred weight, and {{is intended to}} be drawn by six horses." [...] Four days later the story was continued: [...] "Three have been completed. Although fifteen feet long, they are constructed in two chief compartments, calculated to carry each only two inside passengers, besides the capacious hind-boot for the mail-bags, and a fore-basket fitted with leather aprons and glasses, holding the guard, in addition to its two passenger occupants; whilst the driver only can be said to be mounted outside, being on the box. Thus the whole occupants of the capacious Russian mail travel in the most luxurious manner, amid Elysian padding and <b>cushions,</b> with their <b>faces</b> to the horses. The exterior panels are most elaborately painted, and varnished until they shine like glass, in the Russian Imperial livery of dark green, relieved with heads of gold, size etc. and adorned only with double crowned heads of the black eagle, with the sceptre and globe in its talons, the Imperial crest and shield representing the equestrian Peter the Great”.Caledonian Mercury, Edinburgh, Thursday, June 18, 1849 ...|$|R
500|$|Ray drags {{the case}} {{to the top of the}} stairs and meets Eddie. Gerald lays Sabrina down on the sofa, places a <b>cushion</b> over her <b>face</b> and shoots her. Gerald turns off the music as the {{doorbell}} is heard. Answering the door, Gerald sees a man (Novak) who holds up a sign reading [...] "Hello, my name is Paul. I am deaf & dumb." [...] The reverse of the sign reads [...] "Do you need any cleaning products today?" [...] Gerald heads inside and hides Sabrina's body as Paul waits. Gerald splashes his soup onto the blood and invites Paul to clean it. Ray runs down the stairs and meets Paul; he proceeds to buy rope before returning upstairs. Paul continues to clean, but sees the bullethole in the cushion, and then the suitcase being lowered outside the window. Gerald heads outside to investigate, but Eddie and Ray drop the case on his head. The burglars run past Paul and look out to see the canvas in the pool, before both being shot by Paul. Paul rings someone and says [...] "Hello, it's me. Yeah, it's done." [...] He looks to the fake painting, and says [...] "I've got it right here. Yeah, it's fine. Not a peep out of anyone." [...] He takes down the painting and walks out, as the real canvas is seen sinking in the pool.|$|R
