Additionally, the fruit bodies have about 30mg of ergosterol peroxide per 100g of dried mushroom. Ergosterol peroxide is a steroid derivative {{with a wide}} spectrum of biological activity, including antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory activity, and cytotoxicity to various tumor cell lines grown in laboratory culture.|$|E
5|$|Hygrophoropsis {{species have}} fruit bodies with concave caps that often have wavy margins and rolled-in edges. The {{texture of the}} cap surface ranges from {{somewhat}} tomentose to velvety. Typical fruit body colors are orange, brownish-yellow (fulvous) or paler, buff, and cream. The gills have a decurrent attachment to the stipe. They are narrow with blunt edges, often multiply forked, and readily detachable from the stipe. The flesh is soft and generally the same colour as the fruit body surface, or lighter. The taste and odour of the flesh is usually nondescript, or similar to <b>cultivated</b> <b>mushrooms.</b> In contrast, H.rufa can have a distinct ozone-like smell, reportedly reminiscent of the orchid Oncidium ornithorhynchum or a photocopier.|$|E
5|$|Both {{the caps}} and the stems contain the psychoactive compounds, {{although}} the caps consistently contain more. The spores of these mushrooms {{do not contain}} psilocybin or psilocin. The total potency varies greatly between species and even between specimens of a species collected or grown from the same strain. Because most psilocybin biosynthesis occurs early {{in the formation of}} fruit bodies or sclerotia, younger, smaller mushrooms tend to have a higher concentration of the drug than larger, mature mushrooms. In general, the psilocybin content of mushrooms is quite variable (ranging from almost nothing to 1.5% of the dry weight) and depends on species, strain, growth and drying conditions, and mushroom size. <b>Cultivated</b> <b>mushrooms</b> have less variability in psilocybin content than wild mushrooms. The drug is more stable in dried than fresh mushrooms; dried mushrooms retain their potency for months or even years, while mushrooms stored fresh for four weeks contain only traces of the original psilocybin.|$|E

40|$|In 1986, American {{investigators}} {{reported that}} feeding mice raw <b>Cultivated</b> <b>Mushroom</b> (Agaricus bisporus) {{three days a}} week for lifetime, induced tumours in several tissues. This finding stimulated the Nordic Working Group on Food Toxicology and Risk Evaluation (NNT) to review the data on phenylhydrazines occurring naturally in A. bisporus, and to summarize what is known about the toxicicy of these compounds and the mushroom per se. Based on the concern expressed in the early Nordic review, dated 1991, a Nordic project was initiated a few years later aiming to provide and collect additional data, useful for an assessment of whether the consumption of A. bisporus constitutes a human health risk or not. During their work, the project group in 1996 organised a Nordic Seminar: Phenylhydrazines in the <b>Cultivated</b> <b>Mushroom</b> (Agaricus bisporus). They also arranged agaritine to be synthesized. Agaritine is the most abundant phenylhydrazine in A. bisporus (approximately 200 - 500 mg/kg fresh weight). The project group used the synthesised material to develop a chemical analytical method for agaritine, and to study to what extent storage and processing influence the level of this compound in ready to consume mushrooms. Some of the agaritine was used for toxicological studies. The present report from the Nordic project group on risk assessment of natural toxicants brings together available scientific data on occurrence and biological properties of the phenylhydrazines and related compounds in A. bisporus, as well as data on the mushroom per se.
