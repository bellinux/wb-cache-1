A new <b>classification</b> <b>of</b> workplace <b>areas</b> is used in combination with an established official <b>classification</b> <b>of</b> residential <b>areas.</b> The approach is demonstrated using an empirical analysis of 26 million commuting flows in England and Wales, measured between the smallest residential and workplace areas in the 2011 census. The analysis demonstrates potential insights to be gained by this approach, revealing clear patterns in the structure of travel to work flows between geodemographic clusters. Our broad approach is not limited to use in specific countries and has potential application for use with data from non-census sources...|$|R
40|$|The Little Ice Age (LIA) is a well-recognized climatic event {{during which}} the glaciers in the Alps {{advanced}} and reached their maximum Holocene extent. During their retreat following the LIA, the glaciers left large areas of loose or poorly consolidated glacial deposits in their forelands, which are subject to paraglacial reworking and may represent potential hazards for human infrastructures. In this study, we present a regional scale mapping of the LIA and post-LIA glacial deposits and a reconstruction of the maximum LIA extents of glaciers in the same area.

A substantial complication is introduced by changes in the geographic <b>classification</b> <b>of</b> <b>areas</b> in the CPS. Geographic information in the CPS is reported by place of residence according to a classification system of “statistical areas” based on population density and commuting patterns. Before 2005, the system was based on four-digit Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) codes for the MSA, PMSA, or Consolidated Metropolitan Statistical Area (CMSA). In 2005, it changed to one based on Core-Based Statistical Areas (CBSA), which have five-digit FIPS codes.|$|E

Space–time interactions are deeply embedded both empirically and theoretically into many areas of criminology. In this paper, we apply a familiar Bayesian spatio-temporal model to explore the space–time variation in burglary risk in Peterborough, England, between 2005 and 2008. However, we extend earlier work with this model by presenting a novel two-stage method for classifying areas into crime hotspots, coldspots or neither and studying the temporal dynamics of areas within each risk category. A further contribution of this paper is the inclusion of covariates into the model in order to explain the space–time <b>classification</b> <b>of</b> <b>areas.</b> We discuss the advantages of, and identify future directions for, this form of modelling for analysing offence patterns in space and time.

40|$|The <b>classification</b> <b>of</b> <b>areas</b> in {{presence}} of combustible dusts is generally {{more complex than}} {{in presence}} of vapours and/or gases. This {{is due to the}} greater number of parameters {{to be taken into account}} (e. g. the particle-size and the humidity), to the difficulty of using an all-purpose approach and to the layer hazard. As a result, the International Standards on the subject are often quite generic, for example when they set the radius of the hazardous zones as a constant quantity independent of the characteristics of the examined system. The CEI (Italian Electrotechnical Committee) is going to issue a guide aiming at, among other aspects, establishing safety measures more suitable to different situations. This paper briefly outlines the area classification procedure, describes the approaches respectively adopted by the international and the Italian national guide and highlights the innovations that will be introduced by the latter. Finally, the results of a simple case study are presented: they have been obtained by using "ProgEx Dust", a software issued by the CEI, in order to help technicians in their wor...|$|E
40|$|A {{methodology}} for optimized contaminated land investigation (OCLI) is described that balances {{the uncertainty of}} measurements against the cost of taking the measurements and the financial losses that may arise from misclassification of the land. Uncertainty from the sources of both field sampling and chemical analysis is estimated using existing techniques, based on the taking of duplicated samples. The actual costs of sampling and analysis and the expected costs that could arise from either `false positive¿ or `false negative¿ <b>classification</b> <b>of</b> <b>areas</b> of land were estimated. A loss function was constructed that calculates the expectation of financial loss that will arise for a given uncertainty of measurement. The function shows a clear minimum value of cost at an optimal value of uncertainty. Application of this OCLI technique to two case studies demonstrated this minimum value. Below the optimum value of uncertainty, the costs increased due to higher measurement costs. Above the optimum, the costs increased due to increasing risk of factors such as unnecessary remediation or potential litigation over undetected contamination. Many areas for further development of OCLI are identified, but the technique is demonstrated as a useful new approach to judging fitness-for-purpose of such measurement...|$|E

40|$|The {{circulation}} of geographical ideas is interesting, not only within intellect currents, {{but also with}} regards to their transfer from the conceptual and representational to the practical plane. This article studies {{the influence of the}} romantic idea of nature and landscape in the earliest decisions regarding the declaration on National Parks.

Moreover, Spain is known {{to be one of the}} first European countries to initiate a conservation policy, rooted in the romantic "regeneracionistas" movements, and because of the role played by geographers in the early conservation development. It is argued in the text, that is the survival of the romantic ideas which partially explains the choice of the first parks and sites, more precisely, that such a process concentrated on high Atlantic mountains and forested areas while Mediterranean environments were postposed. Landscape and geologic symbolism, romanticism's heritage, predominated at this time over ecologic observance. In addition to this, identity and traditional reasons, which also favored romantic "places of choice", whereas social reasons and arguments in favor of increase of productivity prevented an earlier <b>classification</b> <b>of</b> <b>areas</b> with great biological resources as Doñana in the Southwest...|$|E
