25|$|The {{control system}} {{performance}} {{can be improved}} by combining the feedback (or <b>closed-loop)</b> <b>control</b> of a PID controller with feed-forward (or open-loop) control. Knowledge about the system (such as the desired acceleration and inertia) can be fed forward and combined with the PID output to improve the overall system performance. The feed-forward value alone can often provide the major portion of the controller output. The PID controller primarily has to compensate whatever difference or error remains between the setpoint (SP) and the system response to the open loop control. Since the feed-forward output is not affected by the process feedback, it can never cause the control system to oscillate, thus improving the system response without affecting stability. Feed forward can {{be based on the}} setpoint and on extra measured disturbances. Setpoint weighting is a simple form of feed forward.|$|E

2500|$|In a <b>closed-loop</b> <b>control</b> system, {{data from}} a sensor {{monitoring}} the car's speed (the system output) enters a controller which continuously compares the quantity representing the speed with the reference quantity representing the desired speed. The difference, called the error, determines the throttle position (the control). The result is to match the car's speed to the reference speed (maintain the desired system output). Now, when the car goes uphill, {{the difference between the}} input (the sensed speed) and the reference continuously determines the throttle position. As the sensed speed drops below the reference, the difference increases, the throttle opens, and engine power increases, speeding up the vehicle. In this way, the controller dynamically counteracts changes to the car's speed. [...] The central idea of these control systems is the feedback loop, the controller affects the system output, which in turn is measured and fed back to the controller.|$|E

40|$|Objective: The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{demonstrate}} feasibility of a novel <b>closed-loop</b> <b>controlled</b> therapy for prevention of hypertension in the heartbeating brain-dead porcine model. Methods: Dynamic modeling and system identification were based on in-vivo data. A robust controller design was obtained for the identified models. Disturbance attenuation properties, and reliability of operation of the resulting control system, were evaluated in vivo. Results: The control system responded both predictably and consistently to external disturbances. It was possible to prevent mean arterial pressure to fall below a user-specified reference throughout 24 h of completely autonomous operation. Conclusion: Parameter variability in the identified models confirmed the benefit of <b>closed-loop</b> <b>controlled</b> administration of the proposed therapy.

40|$|Daylight {{responsive}} dimming {{systems have}} been used in few buildings to date because they require improvements to improve reliability. The key underlying factor contributing to poor performance is the variability of the ratio of the photosensor signal to daylight workplane illuminance in accordance with sun position, sky condition, and fenestration condition. Therefore, this paper describes the integrated systems between automated roller shade systems and daylight responsive dimming systems with an improved <b>closed-loop</b> proportional <b>control</b> algorithm, and the relative performance of the integrated systems and single systems. The concept of the improved <b>closed-loop</b> proportional <b>control</b> algorithm for the integrated systems is to predict the varying correlation of photosensor signal to daylight workplane illuminance according to roller shade height and sky conditions for improvement of the system accuracy. In this study, the performance of the integrated systems with two improved <b>closed-loop</b> proportional <b>control</b> algorithms was compared with that of the current (modified) <b>closed-loop</b> proportional <b>control</b> algorithm.
