To support this, the pipes can either be flexible or rigid, but the joints to connect the pipes yield better results if the connections are flexible. An alternative to placing the collection system underneath the waste is to position the conduits in trenches or above grade.|$|E

40|$|<b>Collection</b> <b>and</b> <b>transport</b> of {{municipal}} solid waste (MSW), {{as a part of}} solid waste management, have a great environmental impact due to exhaust emissions from fuel combustion.

40|$|Abstract: Waste <b>collection</b> <b>and</b> <b>transport</b> (WC&T) {{constitutes}} a large {{fraction of the}} total municipal solid waste (MSW) management costs worldwide. In Greece currently this may account for 70 - 100 % of the total MSW costs, most of it being spent on salaries and fuel. It is therefore crucial to improve the WC&T system through routing optimisation.

In this study a methodology for the optimisation of the waste <b>collection</b> <b>and</b> <b>transport</b> system, based on GIS, was developed.

40|$|Background, aim, {{and scope}} Many recent studies on waste {{management}} have {{described in detail}} the potential impacts of recycling and final treatment of municipal waste. In public debates the attention has also {{been focused on the}} choice of final disposal technologies (e. g., landfilling vs. incineration). However, a comprehensive assessment of the impacts of waste <b>collection</b> <b>and</b> <b>transport</b> was still lacking. In the present study we use LCA to evaluate the potential impact of the provincial waste management plan of Varese (northern Italy). A particular attention is devoted to the estimation of environmental impacts generated during waste transport. Materials and methods A detailed Life Cycle Inventory was built for the transportation phase, based on primary data collected by interviewing the agencies involved in waste collection. To model the recycling and final disposal phase we relied on the BUWAL 250 database. Impacts were evaluated with the Eco-Indicator 99 method in its egalitarian formulation. Results The results of our analysis reveal that the major potential impacts of the plan are associated with waste <b>collection</b> <b>and</b> <b>transport.</b> These impacts are partially compensated by reduced resource consumption through recycling and energy recovery through incineration. Discussion The outputs of the LCIA were compared with those obtained by using other ecoindicators (Eco-Indicator 99 hierarchist and individualist, CML 2, EPS 2000). Although not comparable on a quantitative basis, they are qualitatively consistent. Conclusions Neglecting the effects of <b>collection</b> <b>and</b> <b>transport</b> might result in a severe underestimation of the environmental impacts of a waste management system, especially as refers to depletion of fossil fuels, emission of respiratory inorganics and climate change. To reduce the environmental impact of waste management systems an accurate optimisation of waste transport is required. Recommendations and perspectives Effective waste management planning requires the explicit inclusion of waste <b>collection</b> <b>and</b> <b>transport</b> when comparing alternative management policies.
