5|$|United States v. Kagama, 118 U.S. 375 (1886), was a United States Supreme Court {{case that}} upheld the <b>constitutionality</b> of the Major Crimes Act of 1885. This Congressional act gave {{the federal courts}} {{jurisdiction}} in certain cases of Indian-on-Indian crimes, even if the crimes were committed on an Indian reservation. Kagama, a Yurok Native American (Indian) accused of murder, was selected as a test case by the Department of Justice to test the <b>constitutionality</b> of the Act.|$|E
5|$|Bolling v. Sharpe, 347 U.S. 497 (1954) Brown {{companion}} case—dealt {{with the}} <b>constitutionality</b> of segregation in the District of Columbia, which—as a federal district, not a state—is {{not subject to}} the Fourteenth Amendment.|$|E
5|$|In 2009, when Pittsburgh Mayor Luke Ravenstahl {{proposed}} a 1% tax on college tuition {{for students at}} Pittsburgh colleges, this case was used to argue against the <b>constitutionality</b> of that proposal.|$|E
5|$|The ACLU was at {{the center}} of several legal aspects of the Vietnam war: {{defending}} draft resisters, challenging the <b>constitutionality</b> of the war, the potential impeachment of Richard Nixon, and the use of national security concerns to preemptively censor newspapers.|$|E
5|$|The {{issue of}} the <b>constitutionality</b> of this {{restriction}} has not yet arisen in any Singapore court, but during a Parliamentary debate in May 2001, Non-constituency Member of Parliament J.B. Jeyaretnam challenged the provision as unconstitutional.|$|E
5|$|When {{the matter}} was decided by the Illinois Supreme Court, they agreed with the Seventh Circuit and {{declared}} the AUUF law unconstitutional, but upheld the <b>constitutionality</b> of the UPF law.|$|E
5|$|A {{person is}} disqualified from voting in certain circumstances, which include {{engaging}} in acts incompatible {{with being a}} Singapore citizen, being of unsound mind, or being in prison for committing a criminal offence. The <b>constitutionality</b> of the statutory provisions denying prisoners {{the right to vote}} has not yet become an issue in Singapore, though it has been controversial in some foreign jurisdictions.|$|E
5|$|Although Roosevelt, {{most of his}} aides, Johnson, and the NRA staff {{felt the}} Act would survive a court test, the U.S. Department of Justice had on March 25, 1935, {{declined}} to appeal an appellate court ruling overturning the lumber industry code {{on the grounds that}} the case was not a good test of the NIRA's <b>constitutionality.</b> The Justice Department's action worried many in the administration. But on April 1, 1935 the Second Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the <b>constitutionality</b> of the NIRA in the Schechter case. Although Donald Richberg and others felt the government's case in Schechter was not a strong one, the Schechters were determined to appeal their conviction. So the government appealed first, and the Supreme Court heard oral argument on May 2 and 3.|$|E
5|$|Current eagle feather law {{stipulates}} that only individuals of certifiable Native American ancestry {{enrolled in a}} federally recognized tribe are legally authorized to obtain or possess bald or golden eagle feathers for religious or spiritual use. The <b>constitutionality</b> of these laws has been questioned by Native American groups {{on the basis that}} it violates the First Amendment by affecting ability to practice their religion freely.|$|E
5|$|During her {{subsequent}} {{testimony before}} the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee {{as part of the}} confirmation hearings, she refused to answer questions about her view on the <b>constitutionality</b> of some issues such as the death penalty as it was an issue that she might have to vote on if it came before the court.|$|E
5|$|Early in the Act's {{enforcement}} history, the Supreme Court {{addressed the}} <b>constitutionality</b> of several provisions relating to voter qualifications and prerequisites to voting. In Katzenbach v. Morgan (1966), the Court upheld the <b>constitutionality</b> of Section 4(e). This section prohibits jurisdictions from administering literacy tests to citizens who attain a sixth-grade education in an American school {{in which the}} predominant language was Spanish, such as schools in Puerto Rico. Although the Court had earlier held in Lassiter v. Northampton County Board of Elections (1959) that literacy tests did not violate the Fourteenth Amendment, in Morgan the Court held that Congress could enforce Fourteenth Amendment rights—such {{as the right to}} vote—by prohibiting conduct it deemed to interfere with such rights, even if that conduct may not be independently unconstitutional. After Congress created a nationwide ban on all literacy tests and similar devices in 1970 by enacting Section 201, the Court upheld the ban as constitutional in Oregon v. Mitchell (1970).|$|E
5|$|On December 2009 the Renewable Fuels Association (RFA) and Growth Energy, two U.S. ethanol {{lobbying}} groups, filed {{a lawsuit}} challenging LCFS' <b>constitutionality.</b> The two organizations argued that LCFS violated both the Supremacy Clause and the Commerce Clause, jeopardizing the nationwide ethanol market.|$|E
5|$|Opponents {{challenged}} ACA's <b>constitutionality</b> {{in multiple}} lawsuits on multiple grounds. In National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius, the Supreme Court ruled on a 5–4 vote {{that the individual}} mandate was constitutional when viewed as a tax, although not under the Commerce Clause.|$|E
5|$|Since {{this case}} {{challenged}} {{the authority of}} the federal courts to try Indian-on-Indian crime, this case was heard as an interlocutory appeal, meaning that the Supreme Court would have to decide the <b>constitutionality</b> of the claimed jurisdiction before Kagama could be tried for the killing of Iyouse in federal court.|$|E
5|$|The Supreme Court's {{decision}} did {{not specifically}} address the <b>constitutionality</b> {{of the older}} portion of the statute which prohibits the unauthorized wearing, manufacturing, or sale of military medals or decorations. Under the law, the unauthorized wearing, manufacturing, or sale of the Medal of Honor is punishable by a fine of up to $100,000 and imprisonment of up to one year.|$|E
5|$|The {{crux of the}} High Court's holding {{rested on}} stage 3(b), as {{illustrated}} in the table below. In analysing the <b>constitutionality</b> of the provision with regards to {{this portion of the}} reasonable classification test, the Court first ascertained the object of section 37(1) of the PCA. It subsequently considered if differentiation on the basis of citizenship was a reasonable means of attaining the objective.|$|E
5|$|In 1823, {{the state}} {{legislature}} chose Rowan and Henry Clay to represent the defendant in a second rehearing of Green v. Biddle before the U.S. Supreme Court. The case, which involved the <b>constitutionality</b> of laws passed by the General Assembly relating to land titles granted in Kentucky when the state was still a part of Virginia, was {{of interest to the}} legislature. The Supreme Court, however, refused the second rehearing, letting stand their previous opinion that Kentucky's laws were in violation of the compact of separation from Virginia.|$|E
5|$|In 2003, she was {{the leader}} of the {{initiative}} to challenge the <b>constitutionality</b> of the Children's Internet Protection Act. Her efforts led to a partial victory for anti-censorship campaigners; the Supreme Court of the United States ruled that the law was constitutional, but that filtering software on computers in public libraries could be turned off if so requested by an adult guardian. Krug warned that the filters used to censor Internet pornography from children were not perfect and risked blocking educational information about social matters, sexuality, and healthcare.|$|E
5|$|Law professors (and brothers) Akhil Reed Amar and Vikram Amar {{defended the}} <b>constitutionality</b> {{of such a}} plan. They {{proposed}} {{that a group of}} states, through legislation, form a compact wherein they agree to give all of their electoral votes to the national popular vote winner, regardless of the balance of votes in their own state. These state laws would only be triggered once the compact included enough states to control a majority of the electoral college (270 votes), thus guaranteeing that the national popular vote winner would also win the electoral college.|$|E
5|$|Legal Services Corp. v. Velazquez, , is a {{decision}} of the Supreme Court of the United States concerning the <b>constitutionality</b> of funding restrictions imposed by the United States Congress. At issue were restrictions on the Legal Services Corporation (LSC), a private, non-profit corporation established by Congress. The restrictions prohibited LSC attorneys from representing clients attempting to amend (or challenge) existing welfare law. The case was brought by Carmen Velazquez, whose LSC-funded attorneys sought to challenge existing welfare provisions, believing {{it was the only}} way to get Velazquez financial relief.|$|E
5|$|On 20 January 1999, Jeyaretnam {{wrote to}} President Ong Teng Cheong {{requesting}} the reference of another constitutional {{question to the}} Tribunal. This was made {{on behalf of his}} client, opposition politician Chee Soon Juan, who had been charged for giving a public talk on 20 December 1999 without a licence under the Public Entertainments Act. The question involved the <b>constitutionality</b> of the Act. Jeyaretnam argued that the Act violated Articles 14(1)(a) and (b) of the Constitution, which enshrines freedom of speech and assembly.|$|E
5|$|The Hobbs Act, the Travel Act, and the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) {{have been}} upheld under the Commerce Clause. The mail fraud statute has been {{justified}} under the Postal Clause. In Sabri v. United States (2004), the Supreme Court upheld the <b>constitutionality</b> {{of the program}} bribery statute, 18 U.S.C. § 666, under the Spending Clause (with Justice Clarence Thomas citing the Commerce Clause in concurrence). Prior to Sabri, several circuit courts had already so held.|$|E
5|$|The defense {{relied on}} the {{provision}} of the Tenure of Office Act that made it applicable only to appointees of the current administration. Since Lincoln had appointed Stanton, the defense maintained Johnson had not violated the act, and also argued that the President {{had the right to}} test the <b>constitutionality</b> of an act of Congress. Johnson's counsel insisted that he make no appearance at the trial, nor publicly comment about the proceedings, and except for a pair of interviews in April, he complied.|$|E
5|$|Wotton contested the <b>constitutionality</b> of Queensland's parole {{conditions}} to the High Court of Australia. The Australian constitution contains an implied freedom of political communication, as {{is necessary in}} a representative democracy, plus rights to freedom of association and assembly. The case was heard by the High Court in August 2010, where Wotton was represented {{by a team of}} lawyers including Levitt Robinson Solicitors, Ron Merkel QC, assisted by Kristen Walker, Alistair Pound and Ben Schokman.|$|E
5|$|After his maiden speech, Breckinridge took a {{more active}} role in the House. In debate with Ohio's Joshua Reed Giddings, he defended the Fugitive Slave Law's <b>constitutionality</b> and criticized Giddings for {{hindering}} the return of fugitive slaves. He opposed Tennessee Congressman Andrew Johnson's Homestead Bill, fearing it would create more territories that excluded slavery. Although generally opposed to funding local improvements, he supported the repair of two Potomac River bridges to avoid higher costs later. Other minor stands included supporting measures to benefit his district's hemp farmers, voting against giving the president ten more appointments to the U.S. Naval Academy, and opposing funds for a sculpture of George Washington because the sculptor proposed depicting Washington in a toga.|$|E
5|$|After the loss, MacShara {{withdrew from}} the case but Rudzewicz appealed the {{decision}} to the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit. In the filing, Rudzewicz claimed that since they were residents of Michigan, and because the claims did not arise within the Southern District of Florida, that District Court lacked personal jurisdiction over them. Additionally Rudzewicz argued that the long-arm statute violated the 14th Amendment and was unconstitutional. Citing a similar case, World-Wide Volkswagen Corp. v. Woodson, the Appeals court agreed with the defendants and overturned the lower court's decision. The court also agreed with Rudzewicz's assertion of the <b>constitutionality</b> of Florida's long arm statute in its application to the case.|$|E
5|$|Also in Oregon v. Mitchell, the Supreme Court {{addressed}} the <b>constitutionality</b> of various other provisions relating to voter qualifications and prerequisites to voting. The Court upheld Section 202, which prohibits any {{state or local}} jurisdiction from requiring people to live in their borders for longer than 30 days before allowing them to vote in a presidential election. Additionally, the Court upheld the provision lowering the minimum voting age to 18 in federal elections, but it held that Congress exceeded its power by lowering the voting age to 18 in state elections; this precipitated the ratification of the Twenty-sixth Amendment the following year, which lowered the voting age in all elections to 18. The Court was deeply divided in Oregon v. Mitchell, {{and a majority of}} justices did not agree on a rationale for the holding.|$|E
5|$|Bill C-19 (previously Bill S-4) titled An Act {{to amend}} the Constitution Act, 1867 (Senate tenure) was a bill to limit new Senators' tenure to eight-year terms. Currently, {{senators}} can stay in office until they reach the age of 75. The bill was first introduced {{by the government in}} the Senate on May 30, 2006. After consideration in committee and making amendments to the bill, the Senate recommended that the bill not be proceeded with until such time as the Supreme Court of Canada had ruled with respect to its <b>constitutionality,</b> which had not occurred prior to dissolution. The bill was reintroduced in the second session as a Commons bill on November 13, 2007, but did not become law before the session ended.|$|E
5|$|Courts {{are divided}} into three categories: civil, religious, and special. The civil courts deal with civil and {{criminal}} matters, including cases brought against the government. The civil courts include Magistrate Courts, Courts of First Instance, Courts of Appeal, High Administrative Courts which hear cases relating to administrative matters, and the Constitutional Court which {{was set up in}} 2012 in order to hear cases regarding the <b>constitutionality</b> of laws. Although Islam is the state religion, the constitution preserves a degree of religious and personal freedom. Religious law only extends to matters of personal status such as divorce and inheritance in religious courts, and is partially based on Islamic Sharia law. The special court deals with cases forwarded by the civil one.|$|E
5|$|During the Great Depression, three {{important}} United States Supreme Court cases were decided which determined the <b>constitutionality</b> of New Deal measures, {{one of which}} originated in the Eastern District of Missouri. The case, originally filed as Norman v. B & O Railroad, reached the Supreme Court along with two cases filed in the United States Court of Claims, under the single heading of the Gold Clause Cases. The Supreme Court upheld {{the determination of the}} trial court judge, Charles Breckenridge Faris, who found that Congress had the power to prohibit parties from contracting for payment in gold.|$|E
5|$|Even if a {{differentiating}} {{measure is}} found, {{there is a}} strong presumption that it is constitutional. The legislature must necessarily have a wide power of classification in making laws that operate differently for different groups of people in order to give effect to its policy. Unless the law is plainly arbitrary, suggesting examples of arbitrariness are not ordinarily helpful in rebutting this presumption of <b>constitutionality.</b> It is presumed that Parliament knows best for its people, and is experienced in making laws directed at societal problems, hence its differentiation is based on adequate grounds. Therefore, to rebut this presumption it is necessary for the person challenging the law to adduce some material or factual evidence to show that it was enacted arbitrarily or had operated arbitrarily.|$|E
5|$|France's highest {{courts are}} located in Paris. The Court of Cassation, the highest court in the {{judicial}} order, which reviews criminal and civil cases, {{is located in the}} Palais de Justice on the Île de la Cité, while the Conseil d'État, which provides legal advice to the executive and acts as the highest court in the administrative order, judging litigation against public bodies, is located in the Palais-Royal in the 1st arrondissement. The Constitutional Council, an advisory body with ultimate authority on the <b>constitutionality</b> of laws and government decrees, also meets in the Montpensier wing of the Palais Royal.|$|E
5|$|Given Armstrong's concerns, the {{administration}} employed general counsel J. Patrick Abell {{to file a}} friendly test case to determine the <b>constitutionality</b> of the incentive package. While the suit was pending, the Lexington Herald-Leader reported that {{the administration}} had failed to include the interest on the bonds used to finance the expenditures in its estimation of the cost; this, plus the cost overruns reported by the Herald-Leader, had already pushed {{the total cost of}} the package to about $354million by late September 1986. In October, Toyota agreed to cover the cost overruns associated with preparing the site for construction.|$|E
5|$|He also prosecuted {{a number}} of {{contempt}} of court cases, including suits against Dow Jones Publishing Company (Asia), Inc. for material published in The Wall Street Journal Asia; against US-based lawyer Gopalan Nair for comments on his blog; and against three Singapore Democratic Party supporters, John Tan Liang Joo, Isrizal bin Mohamed Isa and Muhammad Shafi'ie Syahmi bin Sariman, who wore T-shirts bearing {{the image of a}} kangaroo dressed in a judge's gown outside the Supreme Court Building. On 15 March 2010, in one of his last cases before his term of office ended, he defended the <b>constitutionality</b> of capital punishment in Singapore before the Court of Appeal in an appeal by a man sentenced to death for drug trafficking.|$|E
5|$|Immediately {{after his}} inauguration, Jefferson {{instructed}} his Secretary of State, James Madison, to stop delivery on all outstanding commissions. Further, {{an act of}} March 8, 1802 the abolished the circuit court judgeships created by the Midnight Judges Act (15 of which had already been filled), restoring the system created under the 1789 and 1793 acts. Federalists viewed this as unconstitutional and looked to the then-pending case of Marbury v. Madisonconcerning a confirmed D.C. {{justice of the peace}} who had not received his commissionas a test case for the <b>constitutionality</b> of the repeal. The next session of the Supreme Court was in June, one month before the repeal would take effect. But, the Judiciary Act of 1802 delayed the Court's next session until February 1803, and made other changes to the structure of the judicial system.|$|E
5|$|In 1970 the United States Congress {{repealed}} mandatory {{penalties for}} cannabis offenses and The Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act separated cannabis from other illicit narcotics and removed mandatory sentences {{for possession of}} small amounts of cannabis. In 1972 President Richard Nixon commissioned a comprehensive study from the National Commission on Marijuana and Drug Abuse. The Commission found that the <b>constitutionality</b> of cannabis prohibition was suspect and that the executive and legislative branches had a responsibility to obey the Constitution, {{even in the absence}} of a court ruling to do so. The Richard Nixon administration did not implement the study's recommendations.|$|E
