25|$|Like {{the cuisine}} {{of the rest}} of {{southern}} Italy, pasta plays an important part in Sicilian cuisine, as does rice; for example with arancini. As well as using some other cheeses, Sicily has spawned some of its own, using both cow's and sheep's milk, such as pecorino and <b>caciocavallo.</b> Spices used include saffron, nutmeg, clove, pepper, and cinnamon, which were introduced by the Arabs. Parsley is used abundantly in many dishes. Although Sicilian cuisine is commonly associated with sea food, meat dishes, including goose, lamb, goat, rabbit, and turkey, are also found in Sicily. It was the Normans and Swabians who first introduced a fondness for meat dishes to the island. Some varieties of wine are produced from vines that are relatively unique to the island, such as the Nero d'Avola made near the baroque of town of Noto.|$|E

60|$|This is {{the meat}} and poultry and bread market. There are stalls of new, various-shaped bread, brown and bright: there are tiny stalls of marvellous native cakes, which I want to taste, {{there is a great}} deal of meat and kid: and there are stalls of cheese, all cheeses, all shapes, all whitenesses, all the cream-colours, on into {{daffodil}} yellow. Goat cheese, sheeps cheese, Swiss cheese, Parmegiano, stracchino, <b>caciocavallo,</b> torolone, how many cheeses I don't know the names of! But they cost about the same as in Sicily, eighteen francs, twenty francs, twenty-five francs the kilo. And there is lovely ham--thirty and thirty-five francs the kilo. There is a little fresh butter too--thirty or thirty-two francs the kilo. Most of the butter, however, is tinned in Milan. It costs the same as the fresh. There are splendid piles of salted black olives, and huge bowls of green salted olives. There are chickens and ducks and wild-fowl: at eleven and twelve and fourteen francs a kilo. There is mortadella, the enormous Bologna sausage, thick as a church pillar: 16 francs: and there are various sorts of smaller sausage, salami, to be eaten in slices. A wonderful abundance of food, glowing and shining. We are rather late for fish, especially on Friday. But a barefooted man offers us two weird objects from the Mediterranean, which teems with marine monsters.|$|E

Finally, if the cheese has been left to mature for more than 24 months, the unusual accompaniment of passito wines, like Moscato di Pantelleria, is advisable.

50|$|Lucanian <b>Caciocavallo</b> Podolico {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{characteristic}} cheeses of Basilicata. It is only produced with whole milk from the Podolic breed of cow which feeds mainly in the pastures. The Podolic breed is reared in the wild throughout the southern Apennine mountains. In the Basilicata region the cheese is produced in the province of Potenza (at Brienza, Forenza, Viggiano, Atella, San Fele, Calvello, Pescopagano, Pietrapertosa, Tolve and Lagonegro), and in the province of Matera (at Accettura,Salandra, Stigliano and Ferrandina).For some time now a process has been undertaken with the purpose, of achieving the European Dop mark for Lucanian <b>Caciocavallo</b> Podolico and which has already led to the drafting of production regulations. Lucanian <b>Caciocavallo</b> Podolico is a stringy cheese. The milk, which comes entirely from the morning’s milking, must be processed within 24 hours. The whole process and the seasoning are governed by the regulations, as are the tools and the ingredient amounts, from the “tina”, the wooden container where the cheese is initially worked, to the quantities and types of curd to be used. Even before the regulations were enforced, the process that leads to producing Lucanian <b>Caciocavallo</b> Podolico was codified by centuries-old tradition, handed down in these places by generations of cheese makers and herdsmen. The cheeses are characteristically pear-shaped, hung “by the neck” between the roof beams to mature.The bouquet is that of the Lucanian woods, rosemary and heather, the fragrance and that particularity that only products of long ago know how to transmit, are the best credentials with which Lucanian <b>Caciocavallo</b> Podolico presents itself to the consumers.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Caciocavallo</b> [...] {{is a type}} of stretched-curd cheese {{made out}} of sheep's or cow's milk.

50|$|Irpinia has a proud {{tradition}} of producing wines such as Fiano di Avellino, Greco di Tufo and Taurasi, {{all of which}} are classified as DOCG.

50|$|Apulia is {{a massive}} food producer: major {{production}} includes wheat, tomatoes, zucchini, broccoli, bell peppers, potatoes, spinach, eggplants, cauliflower, fennel, endive, chickpeas, lentils, beans and cheese (like the traditional <b>caciocavallo</b> cheese).

5000|$|Apparently <b>caciocavallo</b> was {{mentioned}} {{the first time}} around 500 BC by Hippocrates, emphasising the [...] "Greeks' cleverness in making cheese".Types of cheese with names similar to [...] "caciocavallo" [...] are common throughout the Balkans and Southern Italy.In Sicily, the Ragusano DOP, known locally as [...] "caciocavallo ragusano" [...] had to drop the denomination [...] "caciocavallo" [...] in order to get DOP status.|$|E
50|$|Traditional Sicilian pizza {{is often}} thick crusted and rectangular, but also round and {{similar to the}} Neapolitan pizza. It is often topped with onions, anchovies, tomatoes, herbs and strong cheese such as <b>caciocavallo</b> and toma. Other {{versions}} do not include cheese. The Sicilian methods of making pizza are linked to local culture and country traditions, so {{there are differences in}} preparing pizza even among the Sicilian regions of Palermo, Catania, Siracusa and Messina.|$|E
5000|$|The Italian name of {{the cheese}} <b>caciocavallo</b> {{literally}} means [...] "horse cheese" [...] and it is generally thought that the name derives {{from the fact that}} two cheese forms are always bound together with rope and then left to mature by placing them 'a cavallo', i.e. straddling, upon a horizontal stick or branch; however, {{it is more likely that}} the name derives from Latin *cascabellus with the meaning of [...] "sleigh bell" [...] for its shape of a hanging ball; compare Spanish [...] "" [...] = [...] "sleigh bell, rattle".|$|E
5000|$|Kashkaval {{is a type}} {{of yellow}} cheese made of cow milk (kashkaval vitosha), sheep milk (kashkaval balkan), or both (kashkaval preslav). The name is derived from the Italian <b>caciocavallo</b> (cașcaval; кашкавал, кашкавал, качкаваљ or kačkavalj; Kaçkavalli; kaşkaval/kaşar; قشقوان‎‎ / qashqawān). In Albania, Bulgaria, Republic of Macedonia, Serbia and Romania, the term is often used to refer to all yellow cheeses (or even any cheese other than sirene). In English-language menus in Bulgaria, [...] "кашкавал" [...] is {{translated}} as [...] "yellow cheese" [...] (whereas sirene is usually translated as [...] "white cheese" [...] or simply [...] "cheese").|$|E
5000|$|Apart {{from the}} famous string {{instruments}} and pottery handicraft traditions, the main {{area of activity}} is agriculture. [...] "At Bisignano they make the earth sparkle and wood play". Agriculture has prospered in the fertile valleys of the area. The town and the other four municipalities of the Calabrian district specialise in the cultivation and production of cereals, pasta, vegetables, fruit (citrons, bergamot oranges, oranges, clementine tangerines, lemons, grapefruit), savoury goat and sheep’s milk cheeses (<b>Caciocavallo</b> silano in particular), hot red peppers, fine extra-virgin olive oil of medium-high quality (various types: slightly fruity, aromatised, organic and the more famous Bruzio DOP), robust and delicate wines (Donnici in particular) and sweets.|$|E
