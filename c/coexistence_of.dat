5|$|Kiarostami's {{style is}} notable {{for the use}} of long shots, such as in the closing {{sequences}} of Life, and Nothing More... and Through the Olive Trees, where the audience is intentionally distanced physically from the characters to invite reflection on their fate. Taste of Cherry is punctuated throughout by shots of this kind, including distant overhead shots of the suicidal Badii's car moving across the hills, usually while he is in conversation with a passenger. The physical distancing techniques stand in juxtaposition to the dialogue, which always remains in the foreground. Like the <b>coexistence</b> <b>of</b> private and public space, or the frequent framing of landscapes through car windows, this fusion of distance with proximity has been seen as a way of generating suspense in the most mundane of moments.|$|E
5|$|Plantinga's {{version of}} the defence embraces Augustine's view of free will, but not his natural theology. Rather than attempt to show the {{existence}} of God as likely {{in the face of}} evil, as a theodicy does, Plantinga's free will defence attempts to show that belief in God is still logically possible, despite the existence of evil. Theologian Alister McGrath has noted that, because Plantinga only argued that the <b>coexistence</b> <b>of</b> God and evil are logically possible, he did not present a theodicy, but a defence. Plantinga did not attempt to demonstrate that his proposition is true or plausible, just that it is logically possible.|$|E

5|$|An {{examination}} of a hunting tradition in northern Europe follows, where falcons assist humans in hunting by catching wild game, such as rabbits and pheasants. Further collaboration with man and animal is highlighted, {{this time with}} cheetahs. To demonstrate the cheetah's speed and effectiveness, a chase between a group of cheetahs and ostriches is arranged, in which the birds are hunted down and killed. The next animal collaborators are dogs, which hunt wild boar in Patagonia and a puma which has attacked a herd of sheep and a shepherd. In cities, however, stray dogs are the ones hunted by dog catchers, which the narrator claims demonstrates that the hunt is still active, but the prey has changed. Indios also use dogs to hunt monkeys, but their efforts are compared to mercenaries hunting the Indios themselves to clear them from their native land for development. In one such instance, mercenaries retaliate against a death of a workman by hunting down a group of Indios, one of which they torture, castrate and murder. Various scenes of wildlife are then shown, after which orangutans are hunted {{to be sold to}} zoos. The film then ends with the <b>coexistence</b> <b>of</b> man and animal between Erik Zimen, an ecologist, and wolves, the group of animals he wishes to save.|$|E
5|$|Modern humans coexisted with woolly mammoths {{during the}} Upper Palaeolithic {{period when the}} humans entered Europe from Africa between 30,000 and 40,000 years ago. Prior to this, Neanderthals had coexisted with mammoths during the Middle Palaeolithic, and already {{utilised}} mammoth bones for tool making and building materials. Woolly mammoths were very important to ice-age humans, and human survival may have depended on the mammoth in some areas. Evidence for such coexistence was not recognised until the 19th century. William Buckland published his discovery of the Red Lady of Paviland skeleton in 1823, which {{was found in a}} cave alongside woolly mammoth bones, but he mistakenly denied that these were contemporaries. In 1864, Édouard Lartet found an engraving of a woolly mammoth on a piece of mammoth ivory in the Abri de la Madeleine cave in Dordogne, France. The engraving was the first widely accepted evidence for the <b>coexistence</b> <b>of</b> humans with prehistoric extinct animals and is the first contemporary depiction of such a creature known to modern science.|$|E
5|$|The second season, , begins {{six months}} later, with dark spirits terrorizing the seas. Korra {{turns to her}} spirit-attuned uncle Unalaq, chief of the Northern Water Tribe, for tutelage, and opens the polar portals to the Spirit World at his direction. Unalaq then seizes power in the Southern Water Tribe by force, {{starting}} a civil war {{in which he is}} opposed by his brother, Korra's father, Tonraq. Seeking allies against Unalaq, Korra experiences the life of the first Avatar, Wan, who fused his soul with the spirit Raava to imprison her opponent Vaatu. Aided by his twin children Eska and Desna, Unalaq frees Vaatu during the Harmonic Convergence, a decamillennial alignment of planets, and unites with him to become a dark Avatar. As Korra fights this figure, her link to the previous Avatars is broken; but with the help of Tenzin's daughter Jinora, she defeats Vaatu and Unalaq, and leaves the spirit portals open, allowing a new <b>coexistence</b> <b>of</b> spirits and humans.|$|E

In our previous work, we built a <b>coexistence</b> model <b>of</b> IEEE 802. 15. 4 WSNs and IEEE 802. 11 b/g WLANs. By identifying three distinct coexistence regions, the model explained the <b>coexistence</b> behavior <b>of</b> IEEE 802. 15. 4 WSNs and IEEE 802. 11 b/g WLANs, and the model was experimentally validated. In this paper, we improve the model by introducing two important implementation factors: the transceiver's Rx-to-Tx turnaround time and the Clear Channel Assessment partial detection effect. The enhanced model significantly improves the accuracy on explaining and predicting the <b>coexistence</b> performance <b>of</b> IEEE 802. 15. 4 WSNs in the real-life environment. Furthermore, {{under the guidance of}} the model, the <b>coexistence</b> performance <b>of</b> IEEE 802. 15. 4 WSNs is extensively investigated in various coexistence scenarios by analysis, simulation and experiments, respectively.
