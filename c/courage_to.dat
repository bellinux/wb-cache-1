The professor/facilitator must make sure that each student has a chance to shine, that each can feel confident, each can have the <b>courage</b> <b>to</b> ask what they think might be a stupid question. What are feared to be stupid questions are often the most provocative ones.|$|E

Walker oversaw a run of bad results and Everton only escaped relegation with a final day victory over Wimbledon, winning 3–2 after turning round a 2–0 deficit. Southall saw that his teammates were reluctant to take a penalty in the match and so took the ball himself before Graham Stuart plucked up the <b>courage</b> <b>to</b> take the ball from him and convert the penalty.|$|E
