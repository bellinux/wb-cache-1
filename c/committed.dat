40|$|Modern {{software}} is often developed {{over many years}} {{with hundreds of thousands}} of <b>commits.</b> <b>Commit</b> metadata is a rich source of time-based characteristics, including the <b>commit’s</b> time of day and the <b>commit</b> frequency and seniority of its author. The “bugginess” of a <b>commit</b> is also a critical property of that <b>commit.</b> In this paper, we investigate the correlation between a <b>commit’s</b> time-based characteristics and its “bugginess”; such results can be useful for software developers and software engineering researchers. For instance, developers or code reviewers might be well-advised to thoroughly verify <b>commits</b> that {{are more likely to be}} buggy. In this paper, we study the correlation between a <b>commit’s</b> bugginess and the time of day of the <b>commit,</b> the day of week of the <b>commit,</b> the <b>commit</b> frequency and seniority of the <b>commit</b> authors, and whether or not the developers have marked a <b>commit</b> as a “stable” <b>commit.</b> We survey three widely-used open source projects: the Linux kernel, PostgreSQL, and the Xorg server...|$|R
30|$|Thicker borders denote {{that the}} <b>commit</b> is a branch’s head (e.g., <b>commit</b> ea 6 a 4). <b>Commits</b> are drawn {{according}} to their precedence order.

For each <b>commit,</b> DyeVC presents the information described in Fig. 5 (gathered from the central database), along with information that is read in real time from the repository metadata, such as branches that point to that <b>commit</b> and affected files (added, edited, and deleted).|$|R

5|$|He {{also said}} that the {{situation}} had been looked at in the wrong way by police, members of parliament and the security services; rather than asking if Profumo had <b>committed</b> adultery they should have asked if his conduct had led ordinary people to believe he <b>committed</b> adultery. His analogy was with divorce law; a man does not need to have <b>committed</b> adultery for his wife to have grounds to divorce him, but rather she simply has to believe that he has <b>committed</b> adultery. This is because such a belief would destroy the trust and confidence within the relationship. This brought criticism from several government ministers including Sir John Hobson, the Attorney-General for England and Wales, saying that it would mean condemning a man on the basis of suspicion rather than evidence.|$|E

30|$|The {{finer grain}} of {{information}} is the CommitInfo, which represents each <b>commit</b> in the topology. A <b>commit</b> is identified by a hash code (hash attribute) and refers to its parents (except for the first <b>commit</b> in the repository, which {{does not have any}} parent). As each <b>commit</b> may not exist in all clones of the topology, we store the list of clones where each <b>commit</b> can be found (foundIn association end). We also store the committer, the <b>commit</b> message (shortMessage attribute), and whether the <b>commits</b> belong to tracked or non-tracked branches (tracked attribute).|$|R
40|$|In {{designing}} a heterogeneous database systems, {{one of the}} main technical challenges is developing techniques for ensuring global <b>commit.</b> That is, guaranteeing that a transaction spanning multiple individual database management systems (DBMSs) either <b>commits</b> at all the participating DBMSs or at none of them. Previous work in this area typically assumes that the participating DBMSs do not provide a mechanism for interacting with their <b>commit</b> facilities. While this is true in many cases, in practice there are systems which support a programmatic interface to their <b>commit</b> protocols. We refer to database systems offering such facilities as externalized <b>commit</b> DBMSs. The focus of this paper is on <b>commit</b> protocols for these systems. We propose two new <b>commit</b> protocols for externalized <b>commit</b> DBMSs. The first may be used to obtain global <b>commit</b> in heterogeneous database systems composed of DBMSs with different 2 -phase <b>commit</b> protocols (e. g., centralized and linear).

40|$|Software {{quality is}} one of the most {{important}} research sub-areas of software engineering. Hence, a plethora of research has focused on the prediction of software quality. Much of the software ana-lytics and prediction work has proposed metrics, models and novel approaches that can predict quality with high levels of accuracy. However, adoption of such techniques remain low; one of the rea-sons for this low adoption of the current analytics and prediction technique is the lack of actionable and publicly available tools. We present <b>Commit</b> Guru, a language agnostic analytics and pre-diction tool that identifies and predicts risky software <b>commits.</b> <b>Commit</b> Guru is publicly available and is able to mine any GIT SCM repository. Analytics are generated at both, the project and <b>commit</b> levels. In addition, <b>Commit</b> Guru automatically identifies risky (i. e., bug-inducing) <b>commits</b> and builds a prediction model that assess the likelihood of a recent <b>commit</b> introducing a bug in the future. Finally, to facilitate future research in the area, users of <b>Commit</b> Guru can download the data for any project that is pro-cessed by <b>Commit</b> Guru with a single click. Several large open source projects have been successfully processed using <b>Commit</b> Guru. <b>Commit</b> Guru is available online at <b>commit.</b> guru.

40|$|Large {{software}} systems undergo significant evolution {{during their}} lifespan, yet often individual changes {{are not well}} documented. In this work, we seek to automatically classify large changes into various categories of maintenance tasks — corrective, adaptive, perfective, feature addition, and non-functional improvement — using Machine Learning techniques. In a previous paper, we found that many <b>commits</b> could be classified easily and reliably {{based solely on the}} manual analysis of the <b>commit</b> metadata and <b>commit</b> messages (i. e., without reference to the source code). Our extension is the automation of classification by training Machine Learners on features extracted from the <b>commit</b> metadata, such as the word distribution of a <b>commit</b> message, <b>commit</b> author, and modules modified. We validated the results of the learners via 10 -fold cross validation, which achieved accuracies consistently above 50 %, indicating good to fair results. We found that the identity of the author of a <b>commit</b> provided much information about the maintenance class of a <b>commit,</b> almost as much as the words of the <b>commit</b> message. This implies that for most large <b>commits,</b> the SCS <b>commit</b> messages plus the <b>commit</b> author identity is enough information to accurately and automatically categorize the nature of the maintenance task. ...|$|R
