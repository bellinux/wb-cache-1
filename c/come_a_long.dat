Tamagnino, likely based on his lauded works at the Certosa di Pavia, receives a commission for six different Caesars and other sculptures. But in an art scene increasingly monopolised by Cairano, who has <b>come</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> way from his naive expression of the Apostles, Tamagnino does not garner much attention, and, humiliated by the cold reception, he leaves Brescia, probably never to return.|$|E

25|$|Vadilal Industries has <b>come</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> {{way since}} its {{inception}} in 1926, when Vadilal Gandhi started a soda fountain in 1926. He passed on the business to his son, Ranchod Lal, who ran a one-man operation. Eventually, Ranchod Lal's sons, Ramchandra and Lakshman, inherited the business and they were instrumental in giving a new direction to the company. The duo imparted a new vision to the venture and infused a spirit of calculated risk-taking into the firm. As a result, by the 1970s, the Vadilal Company had already evolved into a modern corporate entity.|$|E

He believed it was disrespectful to do so because Xi Su had <b>come</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> way to join them. Sun Quan agreed with Lü Meng and returned Xi Su's troops to him.|$|E

Whilst most {{sparkling wine}} is produced from Chardonnay, Pinot noir and possibly Pinot Meuniere, an Australian speciality is sparkling Shiraz, a red sparkling wine produced from Shiraz grapes. Most sparkling Shiraz is traditionally somewhat sweet, but some producers make it dry, full-bodied and tannic.|$|E

Corrigan, a native of Liverpool, England, moved to the United States {{to pursue a career}} in electronics. He climbed the ladder at Motorola in Phoenix, Arizona, before {{becoming}} CEO of Fairchild Semiconductor in Mountain View, California, in the mid-1970s. The launch of LSI Logic marked his transition to entrepreneur. The company went public in 1983. By the mid-1990s, LSI Logic was selling chips to Sony for its PlayStation video game machine. And in 2001, it made its first major acquisition, C-Cube Microsystems, in a stock deal valued at $851 million.|$|E

25|$|Signal Troops is an {{integral}} part of the Armed Forces. Its condition and functioning largely influences efficiency of command, the timeliness of combat equipment and weapons. In its development, the Signal Troops has <b>come</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> and difficult process that is inextricably linked with the history of the Armed Forces, the changes in the forms and methods of their use and the improvement of military art. From simple audio and visual means of communication for the transmission of signals and commands on the battlefield to widely branched multi-channel, advanced automated systems that can provide a link of virtually unlimited range of both stationary and moving objects on the ground, in the water, under the water and in the air, this is the historical path of development and improvement of military communications. Communication on the battlefield is one of the main types of operational support.|$|E

Late in 2013, Sandberg commented on his defensive improvement: [...] "I see tremendous progress on his footwork out there, his reads on balls, his quickness, his reacting to the hops and getting the hop he wants.

Her latest music is lightning and moonglow." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{production}} base for special effects was Century 21 Studios in Slough, Berkshire, {{which had been}} prepared for filming on the last Supermarionation series, The Secret Service. Supervising director Derek Meddings oversaw the shooting of more than 200 effects shots, including the destruction of EUROSEC Headquarters {{at the end of}} the film. A six-foot (1.8m) Phoenix scale model, which emulated the design of the NASA multi-stage Saturn V rocket, had to be rebuilt after unexpectedly igniting and nearly injuring a technician. For authenticity, the effects staff mounted the shots of the Phoenix lift-off outdoors in a section of the Century 21 car park so as to film against a genuine sky backdrop. Archer and Hearn describe the sequence as [...] "one of the most spectacular" [...] of its kind produced by Century 21. Sylvia Anderson, who considers it indistinguishable from a Cape Kennedy launch, comments that she is [...] "still impressed by the magic of the effects. Technology has <b>come</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> way since the early Seventies, but Derek's effects have endured." ...|$|E
500|$|Writing for the AllMusic website, music {{historian}} Richie Unterberger described [...] "Norwegian Wood" [...] as possessing [...] "more {{than enough}} ambiguity and ingenious innuendo to satisfy even a Dylan fan".

[...] Unterberger concludes his review by commenting, [...] "The power of the track is greatly enhanced by McCartney's sympathetic high harmonies on the bridge, and its exoticism confirmed by George Harrison's twanging sitar riffs". A reviewer for Rolling Stone magazine noted [...] "Norwegian Wood" [...] and [...] "Think for Yourself" [...] as documents of the Beatles' increasing awareness and creativity in the studio. Scott Plagenhoef of Pitchfork Media considers the song {{to be one of the}} most self-evident Lennon pieces on Rubber Soul to exemplify his maturity as a songwriter, and praises the composition as [...] "an economical and ambiguous story-song highlighted by Harrison's first dabbling with the Indian sitar".|$|E
500|$|Paulus was an {{founding}} member of the Oregon Women's Political Caucus, a bi-partisan group of Oregon legislators in 1972. She was instrumental in efforts to pass an Equal Rights Amendment in Oregon in 1973 and 1977. Also, in 1972, she was invited {{to be part of the}} Eagleton Institute of Politics' first conference on women in politics. 10 years later, while serving as Secretary of State, she was a principal speaker at the Institute's 1982 conference. Paulus remarked in her speech that [...] "We have <b>come</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> way" [...] referring to women in politics. In 1984, followers of the Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh bused homeless people to Wasco County in an attempt to sway local elections. As Secretary of State, Paulus recommended the county institute emergency procedures to restrict these transients from registering to vote, which the Rajneeshees challenged in federal court. At that time Oregon allowed citizens to register to vote on the same day as an election. Then federal district judge Edward Leavy ruled against the Rajneeshees, determining the emergency procedures were proper. The religious sect later faced government investigations over immigration fraud, a related failed murder plot, and the first bioterrorist attack in the United States.|$|E
