5000|$|In March 1988, a US {{lawsuit was}} filed by Rogelio Roxas against former Philippine dictator, Ferdinand Marcos {{and his wife}} Imelda Marcos. Roxas alleged {{that he was a}} {{treasure}} hunter who in 1971 was searching for Yamashita's gold. In determining whether there was sufficient evidence to support Roxas' claim, the court considered the following evidence and testimony submitted by Roxas: Sometime in 1970, Roxas’s group began digging on state lands near the Baguio General Hospital. After approximately seven months of searching and digging “24 hours a day,” the group broke into a system of underground tunnels. Inside the tunnels, the group found wiring, radios, bayonets, rifles, and a human skeleton wearing a Japanese army uniform. After several weeks spent digging and exploring within the tunnels, Roxas’s group discovered a ten-foot thick concrete enclosure in the floor of the tunnel. On January 24, 1971, the group broke through the enclosure. Inside, Roxas discovered a gold-colored buddha statue, which he estimated to be about three feet in height. The statue was extremely heavy; it required ten men to transport it to the surface using a <b>chain</b> <b>block</b> hoist, ropes and rolling logs. Although he never weighed the statue Roxas estimated its weight to be 1 tonne. Roxas directed his laborers to transport the statue to his home and place it in a closet. Roxas also found a large pile of boxes underneath the concrete enclosure, approximately fifty feet from where the buddha statue had been discovered. He returned the next day and opened one small box, which contained twenty-four one-inch by two-and-one-half-inch bars of gold. Roxas estimated that the boxes were, on average, approximately the size of a case of beer and that they were stacked five or six feet high, over an area six feet wide and thirty feet long. Roxas did not open any of the other boxes. Several weeks later, Roxas returned to blast the tunnel closed, planning to sell the buddha statue in order to obtain funds for an operation to remove the remaining treasure. Before blasting the tunnel closed, Roxas removed the twenty-four bars of gold, as well as some samurai swords, bayonets and other artifacts. Roxas twice attempted to report his find to Judge Marcos, but was unsuccessful in contacting him. During the following weeks, Roxas sold seven of the gold bars and sought a buyer for the golden buddha. Roxas testified that Kenneth Cheatham, the representative of one prospective buyer, drilled a small hole under the arm of the buddha and assayed the metal. The test revealed the statue to be solid twenty-two carat gold. Roxas also testified that a second prospective buyer, Luis Mendoza, also tested the metal of the statue using nitric acid and concluded that it was “more than 20 carats.”Roxas went on to allege that after he discovered the treasure, he was arrested by Marcos, the treasure was seized, and he was tortured. After his release, Roxas died under suspicious circumstance, creating the impression that he might have been murdered. The lawsuit was asserted by his estate and The Golden Budha sic Corporation, a company formed for the purpose of asserting Roxas' rights to the treasure. In 1996, a jury in Honolulu awarded $22 billion in compensatory damages that after the jury verdict increased with interest to over $40 billion. The jury did not award punitive damages. On November 17, 1998, the Hawaii Supreme Court reversed the $41 billion judgment against Ferdinand and Imelda Marcos. A justice department statistical bulletin on civil verdicts claims that the court found insufficient evidence that Roxas had actually discovered the gold bullion while treasure hunting north of Manila in 1971. However, the actual judicial decision of the court only cites insufficient evidence to establish {{the quantity and quality of}} the gold bullion found and left in the concrete chamber: [...] "...there was insufficient evidence to support an award of damages for such gold bullion as may have been contained in the unopened boxes allegedly found by Roxas, inasmuch as the record was speculative regarding the gold’s quantity and purity..."Furthermore, the Court sustained the portion of the verdict that found that Marcos had stolen the golden buddha and 17 bars of gold (the 24 bars Roxas took out of the chamber minus the seven that he sold). With respect to this claim, the Hawaii Supreme Court specifically found as follows: 1) “There was sufficient evidence to support the jury's special finding that Ferdinand converted the treasure that Roxas found”; and 2) “There was sufficient evidence to support the jury's determination that Roxas [...] "found" [...] the treasure pursuant to Philippine law.” The case was remanded to the trial court for a new trial on the value of the converted golden buddha statue and gold bars.|$|E

40|$|The use {{of short}} <b>chain</b> <b>block</b> {{copolymer}} melts as nanostructured templates with sub- 10 nm domains is often limited by their low segregation strength (χN). Since increasing molar mass to strengthen segregation also increases the interdomain spacing of block copolymer melts, {{it is more}} desirable to increase the Flory−Huggins segment−segment interaction parameter, χ, to produce strong segregation. We have recently shown that poly(oxyethylene−oxypropylene−oxyethylene) block copolymer melts can undergo disorder-to-order transition when blended with a selectively associating homopolymer that can hydrogen bond {{with one of the}} blocks. Here, we study the effect of the molar mass of poly(acrylic acid) in the range 1 − 13 times that of the copolymer on the segregation of a 6. 5 kg/mol poly(oxyethylene−oxypropylene−oxyethylene) copolymer melt. The neat copolymer is disordered, and the addition of poly(acrylic acid) resulted in a well-ordered lamellar morphology with an interdomain spacing of 10 ± 1. 0 nm. Using small-angle and ultrasmall-angle X-ray scattering, we found that the blends remain well ordered at 80 °C over the entire range of homopolymer chain lengths. A small increase in the interdomain spacing of the lamellae and an order−order transition from lamellae-to-cylindrical morphology was observed in all blends as a function of increasing homopolymer concentration.

It is well established that many properties of linear polymers can be tuned by using different copolymer systems. Similarly, we expect tunability of bottlebrush polymers by using chem. distinct polymer chains. A collaborative effort with Hadjichristidis from KAUST led us to a deeper study on the arrangement of chem. distinct polymeric units within the bottlebrush architecture. We have organized these samples into four categories based on the geometric connectivity: homo-bottlebrush polymer (H) in which all side chains have identical chem. functionality, main <b>chain</b> <b>block</b> bottlebrush polymers (M) which has chem. distinct side chains are grafted in groups along the backbone, random-co-bottlebrush (R) in which the sequence of grafting is detd. by the no. fraction of each chem. distinct side chain, and diblock side chains bottlebrush polymer (D) in which the side chains themselves are block copolymers.

40|$|We {{describe}} an FPGA-based, 96 -channel, time-to-digital converter (TDC) {{intended for use}} with the Central Outer Tracker (COT) in the CDF Experiment at the Fermilab Tevatron. The COT system is digitized and read out by 315 TDC cards, each serving 96 wires of the chamber. The TDC is physically configured as a 9 U VME card. The functionality is almost entirely programmed in firmware in two Altera Stratix FPGA's. The special capabilities of this device are the availability of 840 MHz LVDS inputs, multiple phase-locked clock modules, and abundant memory. The TDC system operates with an input resolution of 1. 2 ns. Each input can accept up to 7 hits per collision. The time-to-digital conversion is done by first sampling each of the 96 inputs in 1. 2 -ns bins and filling a circular memory; the memory addresses of logical transitions (edges) in the input data are then translated into the time of arrival and width of the COT pulses. Memory pipelines with a depth of 5. 5 μs allow deadtime-less operation in the first-level trigger. The TDC VME interface allows a 64 -bit <b>Chain</b> <b>Block</b> Transfer of multiple boards in a crate with transfer-rates up to 47 Mbytes/sec. The TDC also contains a separately-programmed data path that produces prompt trigger data every Tevatron crossing. The full TDC design and multi-card test results are described.

40|$|Abstract- The living {{character}} (expressed by {{the ratio}} k 0 /kt) of the cationic ring-opening polymerization of N-substituted aziridines is {{strongly influenced by}} the number and the bulki-ness of the substituents on the monomer. Thus, N-tert. butyl aziridine (TBA) has a k/kt value of iO ' l. mol 1 compared with 80 for N-isopropyl aziridine and 4 for N-ethylaziridine. P 0 -lymerization of TBA initiated by methyl trifluoromethylsulfo-nate (methyltriflate) {{in a mixture of}} THF and HMPT allows to prepare poly-TBA with well defined molecular weight (up to 100, 000) and of low dispersity. The thus obtained polymers gi-ye a slow termination reaction which obeys first order kinetics and during which the molecular weight of the polymer remains unchanged. It is therefore assumed to be an intramolecular at-tack of the growing species by an amino function of its own po-lymer chain. Because the termination is very slow compared with propagation, it is possible to react the aziridinium ions which are the active chain ends, with a nucleophile before the termination becomes important. This reaction was first checked with a model compound (N-methyl-N-tert. butyl aziridinium tn-flate) and was then carried out with living poly-TBA. In this way a number of poly-TBA's with different functional end groups were synthesized. They were characterized by 360 MHz 'H NMR spectroscopy and by GPC. If the nucleophile is part of another polymer <b>chain,</b> <b>block</b> or graft copolymers containing poly-TBA segments are obtained. Other aziridines showing a high living character are N-substi-tuted propylenimines.
