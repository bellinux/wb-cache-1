40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to analyse the Hybrid III dummy chest loading in heavy vehicle frontal crashes. In total, eight truck front-to-trailer-type sled tests were performed. The Hybrid III, in driver position, was {{equipped}} with the <b>chest</b> <b>deflection</b> sensor system RibEye and its standard potentiometer sensor was compared with the RibEye deflection data. The chest impact point was established by using Fuji film impression, as well as from video data. Chest-to-steering wheel rim contact occurred in all tests. Differences in chest loading were found between the Hybrid III dummy reference test and the load case identified in this study, predominantly impact velocity, direction, distribution and location of loading. The steering wheel rim contact is the major contributor to <b>chest</b> <b>deflection.</b> The chest deformation consists of anterior/posterior compression and upward deflection of the sternal plate. The Hybrid III standard <b>chest</b> <b>deflection</b> sensor is not reliable in this load case due to the modes of sternal displacement and the single-point measurement location. Combining the RibEye system with global dummy kinematic data and accurate contact detection is required to fully assess <b>chest</b> <b>deflection.</b> New biomechanical data are needed to adapt the injury risk assessment to the identified load case...|$|E
40|$|Ninety-three human cadaver {{tests are}} used in the {{development}} of thoracic injury risk functions with consideration of age and restraint condition. Linear logistic regression models are developed with the set of potential predictors including the maximum <b>chest</b> <b>deflection,</b> the age of the cadaver at death, gender, and the loading condition on the anterior thorax: blunt hub (41 tests), seat belt (26 tests), air bag (12 tests), and combined belt-and-bag (14 tests). Predicted outcomes were the probability of any rib fractures (onset of injury) and the probability of greater than six rib fractures (severe injury). The analysis shows that the injury risk function was not dependent on the loading condition, but was strongly dependent on age. A significant injury risk model with good ability to discriminate injury from non-injury tests (P < 0. 0001, chi-square 21. 49, area under receiver operator characteristic curve (ROC) 0. 867, Kruskal’s Gamma 0. 732) is presented using only maximum <b>chest</b> <b>deflection</b> and cadaver age as predictors of injury risk. The 50 % risk of any rib fractures is found to occur at 35 % <b>chest</b> <b>deflection</b> for a 30 -year-old, but at 13 % deflection for a 70 -year-old.

40|$|The {{usage of}} the {{seatbelt}} {{as a part of}} the vehicle protection system has immensely promoted occupant safety. However, recent accident investigation shows that it is necessary to increase the chest injury protective e_ciency in frontal impact condition. This study aims to investigate the influence of seatbelt system design variables on occupant chest injury related physical parameters at varying impact conditions, especially concerning with the <b>chest</b> <b>deflection</b> and distribution of rib stress/strain. The study is conducted by using human body FE model in combination with post mortem human subjects tests. An FE model of the belted occupant is therefore established by using a baseline human body FE model (GHBMC), which is validated according to detailed experimental data regarding kinematics, seatbelt force and <b>chest</b> <b>deflection.</b> A parameter study is implemented in terms of seatbelt position, seatbelt angle and impact speed to determine the influence of seatbelt utilization on occupant thoracic injury in frontal impact. The results show that the influence of seatbelt position on <b>chest</b> <b>deflection</b> and distribution of rib stress/strain is greater than that of the seatbelt angle. Meanwhile, the trends of chest deflections are the same with the trends of the rib stress/strain responses while the changes of seatbelt design variables. This study provides a virtual test method on investigation of the chest injury biomechanics related to the seatbelt design variables. Furthermore, the results from this study of chest injury mechanism will also provide a reference for optimizing of the occupant restraint system. © 2017, Editorial Office of Chinese Journal of Theoretical and Applied Mechanics.

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this {{quantitative}} study is to investigate the differences of the injury mechanism caused by {{two different types of}} seatbelt loads on the occupant’s chest. Methods: The finite element analysis is employed to compare the different responses of the human body model, including comparison of kinematics, chest accelerations, seatbelt forces and chest injury outcomes regarding <b>chest</b> <b>deflections</b> and rib fractures. Results: The calculated rib strain-stress response from simulations in force-limiting seatbelt are higher than that in the regular seatbelt. The forward movement and torso twist are both great in simulations with force-limiting seatbelt. Moreover, there are obvious differences in the injury outcomes of <b>chest</b> <b>deflections</b> and rib fracture risks under the different seatbelt loads. Conclusion: Results indicate that the <b>chest</b> <b>deflections</b> and rib fracture risks are negatively correlated under the load of the force-limiting seatbelt, However, they are positively correlated to and determined by the seatbelt peak load of the regular seatbelt.

The BOM was established using a human body model from the Global Human Body Models Consortium (GHBMC) and the model was validated against a frontal sled test with a Post-Mortem Human Subjects (PMHS). The bio-fidelity of the belted occupant model was then evaluated according to measured data from experimental test regarding detailed torso kinematics and seatbelt forces. The BOM was then used for prediction of the chest injury via calculated injury related parameters from simulations, including stress and strain distributions on the whole ribcage, {{which could not be}} fully measured in PMHS test. A study of chest injury risk was conducted with the validated model. Special concern is given to the injuries on rib fractures and <b>chest</b> <b>deflections</b> which have been correlated to the calculated stresses and strains. The results demonstrate that the validation can sufficiently meet the reconstruction of the test and the chest injury outcomes obtained from the simulation can fit the experiment, particularly the fracture risk of the rib 6 to the rib 11 on the chest along the seatbelt path.

40|$|This study {{evaluates the}} ability of the Hybrid III dummy and its {{associated}} injury criteria to discriminate sled tests with injurious conditions from those without. Ninety-three matched human cadaver and Hybrid III frontal sled tests over a range of impact speeds and restraint conditions are considered. Chest acceleration, deflection, and CTI are used as predictors of rib fracture outcome in the matched cadaver tests. Univariate and multivariate models are developed to evaluate the importance of the dummy measures relative to three experimental parameters (test speed, restraint condition, seating position) and three cadaver characteristics (age, gender, mass). The primary findings are, first, that chest acceleration has no utility for injury discrimination (Kruskal’s Gamma = 0. 0319, area under the receiver-operator characteristic = 0. 500). Second, the functional relationship between any Hybrid III injury measure and injury risk is sensitive to all three experimental factors. Injury risk models with consideration of this dependence are presented. It is shown that the Hybrid-III <b>chest</b> <b>deflection</b> corresponding to a given level of injury risk is greatest for air bag loading, lowest for belt loading, and intermediate for combined loading. This is shown to be non-biofidelic, since <b>chest</b> <b>deflection</b> as measured directly on the cadaver does not exhibit this sensitivity...|$|E
40|$|The US Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard for frontal {{protection}} requires vehicle crash tests into a rigid barrier {{with two}} belted dummies {{in the front}} seats. The standard was recently modified to require two separate 56 Kph frontal tests. In one test the dummies are 50 % males. In the other test, the dummies are 5 % females. Analysis of crash test data indicates that the 56 Kph test does not encourage technology to reduce chest injuries in lower severity crashes. Tests conducted by Transport Canada provide data from belted 5 % female dummies in the front seats of vehicles that were subjected crashes into a rigid barrier at 40 Kph. An analysis of {{the results showed that}} for many vehicles, the risks of serious chest injuries were higher in the 40 Kph test than in a 56 Kph test. This paper examines the benefits that would result from a requirement for a low severity (40 Kph) frontal barrier crash test with two belted 5 % female dummies and more stringent chest injury requirements. A preliminary benefits analysis for <b>chest</b> <b>deflection</b> allowable in the range of 28 mm. to 36 mm. was conducted.

A combination of modeling techniques was applied using rigid bodies for most segments, but describing the thorax as a deformable structure. In this paper, this modeling strategy was employed to also develop a model representing a small female. The validation database was extended and now also includes lateral validation. The anthropometry of both models has been derived from the RAMSIS anthropometry database. Joint properties for the mid size male were derived from literature, and established scaling techniques were employed to derive joint properties for the small female model. The mid size male model was validated using: frontal volunteer sled tests, frontal and lateral post mortem human subject (PMHS) impactor tests in various body regions, lateral PMHS sled tests, and rearward volunteer and PMHS tests. The small female model was validated using scaled biofidelity requirements from the literature and biomechanic data of the applicable body size including side airbag loading.

However, most occupant models used in crash simulations are based on crash dummies and thereby inherit their apparent limitations. Several models simulating parts of the real human body have been published, but only few describe the entire human body and these models were developed and validated only for a limited range of conditions. This paper describes a human body model for both frontal and rearward loading. A combination of modelling techniques is applied using rigid bodies for most body segments, but describing the thorax as a flexible structure. The skin is described in detail using an arbitrary surface. Static and dynamic properties of the articulations have been derived from literature.

40|$|Factors {{affecting}} {{the risk of}} ribcage injury in adult subjects during CPR were investigated using the torso region of the THUMS model, a full human body FE-model, representing an average adult male. The thoracic dynamic response of the model was compared to experimental PMHS hub loading impact data and live-subject CPR data found in the literature. The model was then used to study the risk of obtaining injuries in various simulated CPR conditions, also varying the stiffness of the costal cartilage. Parameters that are known to predict induced injuries were extracted from the model simulations, i. e. <b>chest</b> <b>deflections,</b> and maximum 1 st principal strain and von-Mises stress in the ribs and sternum, {{as well as the}} pressure in the heart muscle. These were compared with values that have been reported to have the potential to cause injury. The predictions were compared to experimental findings of the probability of CPR resulting in fractures of the ribs and sternum. The previously mentioned parameters did not reach high enough values to predict fracture occurrences, but interesting trends were highlighted with regards to the different loading conditions investigated. It was demonstrated that human body FE-model simulation studies can be useful for investigating the influence of different CPR related loading conditions on the risk of occurrences of rib and sternal fractures. ...|$|R

40|$|A {{human body}} {{finite element model}} for an average adult male was developed. The model {{is based on the}} {{integration}} of finite element models of body regions of the thorax, abdomen, shoulder and head-neck, previously developed at Wayne State University. The model includes details of the human skeleton and major soft tissues in these body regions, including the skull, spinal column, neck muscles, joint ligaments, ribcage, clavicle and shoulder bones and joints, lungs, heart, aorta, vena cava, esophagus, liver, spleen, and kidneys, and various connective arteries and veins, and pelvis. Extensive validations of the human body model have been made against Post Mortem Human Subjects (PMHS) responses for the frontal and side impacts, as well as belt and surrogate airbag loading under various conditions of fifteen sets of pendulum tests performed and published by various researchers. The force-deflection characteristics of shoulders, thorax, and the abdomen are in good agreement with the experimental data. The model was further validated against the chest band data of belted PMHS 30 mph sled test (NHTSA bio-mechanics database, test # 2860). The model predicts the histories of <b>chest</b> <b>deflections</b> and shapes of the fourth and eight rib sections. Robustness study in sled test simulations was made. The model performed well under the impact severities of 15 - 35 MPH in frontal and side impacts. Stress analysis was made on the clavicle under lateral pendulum impact, on the abdominal solid organs under rigid bar impacts, and on the chest ribs under the 30 mph belted PMHS sled test. Comparisons of the analysis results with autopsy results showed that the model can estimate possible locations of the bone and organ failures, consistent with the experimental observations...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate WorldSID constant-speed shoulder and thorax impact responses in terms of impact force, external and internal deflection (1 D and 2 D IR-Tracc response) for two velocities (1 m/s and 3 m/s), at three impact levels (shoulder, upper thorax and mid thorax) in three impact directions (lateral, + 15 ° posterolateral, − 15 ° anteraolateral). In addition, the impact force and external deflection were compared to previously published cadaver data. Each impact condition was repeated twice. A total of 42 tests were performed. The WorldSID’s lowest peak impact force and external deflection were found for impact at shoulder level regardless of impact direction. Maximum force and deflection were found for impact at mid thorax. Comparison between WorldSID and PMHS showed similar external <b>chest</b> <b>deflections</b> for impacts at 3 m/s. The peak impact force response with respect to impact level was found to be reversed for the WorldSID compared to the PMHS, for which shoulder impact resulted in the highest peak force. External time history responses for the WorldSID compared to the one PMHS impacted at 1 m/s in lateral impact direction showed a significant difference in both timing and magnitude. External deflections at upper and mid thorax were approximately twice as high as the internal 1 D deflection measured by the IR-Tracc. However, taking into account the rotation of the rib, the calculated 2 D deflection response at the posterior impact direction was closer to the external deflection, and thus also to the PMHS deflection response at 3 m/s. These findings emphasize the need of 2 D deflection measurement...|$|R
40|$|Australia is {{considering}} allowing {{the use of}} lower anchorage systems for child restraints in motor vehicles. However, care {{needs to be taken}} to ensure that the mix of existing Australian child restraint systems and any proposed lower anchorage system does not pose safety risks for children. In addition, it is desirable to avoid unique requirements for an Australian lower anchorage system and hence an assessment of UNECE ISOFIX and US FMVSS LATCH requirements was undertaken. A series of 28 frontal impact sled tests were conducted based on the Australian Standard AS/NZS 3629 child restraint dynamic test method. A further series of 15 tests were conducted in a vehicle body mounted on an impact sled with an acceleration-time history representative of a 56 km/h full frontal rigid barrier crash. Three different models of forward-facing child restraint were tested, with varying anchorage configurations including rigid ISOFIX, flexible LATCH strap and 3 -point seatbelt. Top tethers were evaluated with anchorages directly behind the child restraint (0 °) and offset at an angle of 20 °. P 3 and Hybrid III 3 year old dummies were used. Anchorage loads and safety performance of the restraint system were assessed. In tests in the vehicle body, maximum dynamic top tether loads were in the range of 7 - 8 kN and maximum dynamic lower anchorage loads are estimated to be in the range 13 - 14 kN. Tests using rigid ISOFIX anchorages generally produced lower head acceleration and forward excursion than other tested anchorage types. However, this was accompanied by increased <b>chest</b> <b>deflections</b> and neck flexion moments. These data suggest that lower anchorage systems may be acceptable in Australia, but that modifications to the UNECE and LATCH requirements may be required to ensure compatibility with existing Australian child restraint systems without a degradation of child safety...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. S.) [...] Wichita State University, College of Engineering, Dept. of Mechanical EngineeringSignificant advancements in {{enhancing}} passenger safety and vehicle structures {{have been made}} in the automotive industry to protect the occupants and to minimize the injuries during crash events. Variety of crash tests, based on federal regulatory standards, have been performed with an end goal to examine the occupant kinematics and potential injury responses. Among different automotive crash scenarios, the frontal impact is the most common type of accident, which has been considered in this study. In recent years, computer-aided engineering tools have been extensively utilized in modeling, analysis and design of vehicle structures and occupant safety systems. The primary reason for the development and use of simulation models is to reduce the number of full-scale sled tests performed, which require vast flow time and are associated with significant cost. This thesis entirely focuses on the comparison of dynamic responses of human body models versus the crash dummy models in various vehicle frontal federal regulatory standards. For this reason, a ford taurus car representing a typical sedan has been considered as a medium. The simulation tests are conducted for the full frontal impact, small offset overlap impact and oblique impact configurations. A car interior environment is developed in MADYMO code, in which the human and dummy models are placed in. The acceleration acquired from the finite element analysis of frontal crash scenarios and the driver seat node are then input into the MADYMO code for both human and dummy models, and their kinematic responses are then compared. Per regulations, chest injury is considered to be a prominent factor in frontal crashes. Hence, the variations of <b>chest</b> <b>deflection,</b> chest acceleration and viscous criteria are investigated. The results from this study illustrate the potential difference between the human and dummy dynamic performances in various frontal crash scenarios. In particular, the differences in chest acceleration, <b>chest</b> <b>deflection,</b> and flexibility of spine are quantified...|$|E

40|$|Recent {{studies have}} shown that {{restrained}} occupants over the age of 50 in frontal crashes have a higher risk of injury in the rear seat than in the front, and have hypothesized that the incorporation of technology such as belt pre-tensioning and force limiting preferentially in the front seat is at least partially responsible for this trend. This study investigates the potential benefits and trade-offs of seat belt pretensioners and force-limiters in the rear seat using a series of frontal impact sled tests at two speeds (48 km/h and 29 km/h ΔV) with a buck representing the interior of the reat seat occupant compartment of a contemporary mid-sized sedan. Four different dummies were tested: the Hybrid III six year old (in a booster seat, H 3 6 YO), the Hybrid III 5 th percentile female (H 3 AF 05), the Hybrid III 50 th percentile male (H 3 AM 50), and the THOR-NT. The restraints consisted of either a standard three point belt, or a 3 -point belt with a retractor pretensioner and a progressive force-limiter (FL+PT). Each test condition was repeated in triplicate. The FL+PT restraints (compared to the standard restraints) resulted in a significant (p≤ 0. 05) decrease in peak internal <b>chest</b> <b>deflection</b> for each of the Hybrid III dummies at both test speeds (48 km/h: 29 % decrease for H 3 6 YO, 38 % decrease for H 3 AF 05, 30 % decrease for H 3 AM 50), and for the THOR-NT at a ΔV of 29 km/h. At 48 km/h, the FL+PT restraint qualitatively decreased the average peak internal <b>chest</b> <b>deflection</b> of the THOR-NT, however this decrease was not statistically significant (p= 0. 06). Furthermore, the FL+PT system allowed little or no increase in forward head excursion, and improved whole-body kinematics for all dummies by restricting pelvic excursion and slightly increasing torso pitch. The results suggest that the FL+PT system studied here may provide injury-reducing benefit to rear seat occupants in moderate to high severity frontal crashes, although more study is needed to evaluate these restraints in other crash scenarios...|$|E
40|$|In this study, {{experiments}} {{originally designed}} to quantify <b>chest</b> <b>deflections</b> of human cadavers and manikins, are used in an analytical scheme to predict force distributions over the chest and shoulder. In these experiments, cadavers and the 50 th percentile Hybrid III manikin were used in deceleration sled tests to simulate a frontal crash. Six cadaver tests and two Hybrid III tests were conducted at high velocity impact (ΔV = 13. 4 m/s), and three cadaver tests at low velocity impact (ΔV = 6. 7 m/s). Surrogates were instrumented with two chestbands to provide chest contours. A three-point belt instrumented with a force transducer above the shoulder level was used for restraining the surrogates. Onboard and offboard high-speed cameras captured the left and frontal-left views of the occupant. The two cameras were synchronized by a flashlight and/or film event marker. The captured crash views were used to reconstruct {{the motion of the}} surrogates in three dimensions. This information was used in conjunction with the contour records from the chestbands to reconstruct the shape of the shoulder belt at five levels; the upper anchorage point, shoulder, upper chestband, lower chestband, and the lower anchorage point. Shoulder belt tension records were used with the belt shape in vector analysis to determine the forces at the three belt levels which are in contact with the occupant. Student T-test was used to establish statistical significance. Kinematic results showed that the vertical range of motion of the head and thorax in the Hybrid III manikin are more than those in the cadavers at high speed (p 3 ̆c 0. 04). Also, human cadaver studies showed that the frontal range of motion of the head and thorax are more in high speed tests (p 3 ̆c 0. 02).

40|$|This {{study was}} aimed at {{investigating}} the injury mechanism of pedestrian chests in collisions with passenger vehicles of various frontal shapes and examining {{the influence of the}} local structural stiffness on the chest injury risk by using the headform impact test at the chest contact area of the vehicle. Three simulations of vehicle to pedestrian collisions were conducted using three validated pedestrian finite element (FE) models of three pedestrian heights of 177 (AM 50 th), 165 and 150 cm and three FE vehicles,models representing a one-box vehicle, a minicar and a medium car. The validity of the vehicle models was evaluated by comparing the headform acceleration against the measured responses from headform impact tests. The chest impact kinematics and the injury mechanisms were analyzed in terms of the distribution of the von Mises stress of the ribcage {{and in terms of the}} <b>chest</b> <b>deflections.</b> The <b>chest</b> contact locations on the front panel and the bonnet top were identified in connection to the causation of rib fractures. The risk of rib fractures was predicted by using the von Mises stress distribution. The headform impact tests were carried out at the chest contact area on the front panel and bonnet to examine the safety performance with respect to pedestrian chest protection. In simulations of the one-box vehicle to pedestrian collisions, the chest was struck directly by the frontal structure at a high velocity and deformed substantially, since a shear force was generated by the stiff windshield frame. The acceleration of the headform was related to the rib deflections. The injury threshold of the ribcage deflection (42 mm) corresponded to the headform average acceleration of 68 G. In the minicar collision, the chest was struck with the bonnet top and cowl area at a low velocity, and the deformation was small due to the distributed contact force between the chest and the bonnet top. Besides, the ribcage deformation was too small for bridging a relation between the headform accelerations and rib deflections. In the medium car collision, the deformation mode of the chest was similar to that in the minicar collision. The chest collided with the bonnet top at a low velocity and deformed uniformly. The deflection of the ribs had an observable correlation with the headform accelerations measured in the headform impact tests. The frontal shape of a vehicle has a large influence on a pedestrian's chest loadings, and the chest deformation depends on the size of the pedestrian and the stiffness of the vehicle. The one-box passenger vehicle causes a high chest injury risk. The headform impactor test can be utilized for the evaluation of the local stiffness of a vehicle's frontal structure. The reduction of the headform acceleration is an effective measure for pedestrian chest protection for specific shapes of vehicles by efficacy in modifying the local structural stiffness...|$|R

Three male human cadavers were successively impacted by an impactor system delivering a constant velocity impact from the left and the right sides at three levels (shoulder, upper chest and mid-chest). Different impact directions were also chosen for each side: lateral, + 15 ° posterolateral, − 15 ° anterolateral. One subject was impacted at 1, 3 and 6 m/s whereas the other two subjects were impacted at 3 m/s only. A total of nineteen tests was performed. The impact force and the <b>chest</b> lateral <b>deflection</b> were measured using respectively a standard data acquisition system and also an optoelectronic stereophotogrammetric system (OSS). After each test, attempts were made to detect rib fractures by palpation, and a necropsy of the torso was performed after the tests series to document the injuries produced by all the tests. Overall, the peak impact force increased from the lowest impact level (mid-chest) to the highest (shoulder) and was found to be rate-sensitive. The force-deflection relationship was non linear for the shoulder impacts (stiffness increased with increasing deflection) whereas stiffness was nearly constant for the mid- and upper-chest impacts. The anterolateral impacts to the mid- and upper-chest generated more rib fractures than the other impact directions...|$|R

40|$|The vehicle {{safety and}} {{roadside}} safety communities utilize full-scale crash tests {{to assess the}} potential for occupant injury during collision loadings. While the vehicle community uses instrumented full-scale crash test dummies (ATDs), the roadside community relies on the flail space model and the Acceleration Severity Index (ASI) models, which are based primarily on the deceleration of the test vehicle. Unfortunately, {{there has been little}} research relating the roadside injury criteria to those used in the vehicle community. This paper investigates the correlation of these differing metrics to gain insight to potential differences in threshold occupant risk levels in the roadside and vehicle safety communities. Full-scale vehicle crash tests are analyzed to compare the flail space model and ASI to ATD-based injury criteria for different impact configurations, including frontal and frontal offset crash tests. The Head Injury Criterion (HIC), peak chest acceleration, peak <b>chest</b> <b>deflection,</b> and maximum femur force are each compared to the ASI, and flail space parameters. With respect to the vehicle crash test injury criteria, the occupant impact velocity and ASI are found to be conservative in the frontal collision mode. The occupant ridedown acceleration appears to have the strongest correlation to HIC while the ASI appears to have the strongest correlation to peak chest acceleration...|$|E
40|$|It {{has been}} shown that the design of the Hybrid III dummy's hip joint can cause high spikes in the chest accelerations. These spikes are {{generated}} when the pelvis rotation is suddenly stopped by the bottoming out of the hip joint. This creates large lumbar shear and tension forces which act to resist forward movement of the dummy's chest. This problem has partly been resolved by the introduction of 'modified femurs'. However, even with modified femurs, high peaks have still been observed in chest accelerations of some front barrier crashes. In order to analyze the load path from upper legs to chest, dynamic experiments have been performed on the hip joint (with modified femurs and with standard femurs), on the isolated lumbar spine and on a partial dummy consisting of upper legs, torso, neck and head. These tests have been used to significantly improve an existing model of the dummy. In the hip joint, a considerable rate-dependency was found and the adjustment of hip friction was found to be an important factor. For different lumbar spines from the same manufacturer, major differences in response were found. These differences between dummy parts are a concern for reproducibility of full dummy tests. A sensitivity analysis showed that such dummy related factors lead to variations in the order of 2 - 8 % for peak chest acceleration and <b>chest</b> <b>deflection,</b> but lead to much larger variations in lumbar loads...|$|E
40|$|Road {{safety is}} a major {{societal}} issue. In 2009, more than 35, 000 people died on the roads of the European Union, i. e. {{the equivalent of a}} medium town, and no fewer than 1, 500, 000 persons were injured 1. The cost for society is huge, representing approximately 130 billion Euros in 2009. In view of this the European road safety policy orientations identify new technologies that have a high potential to improve road safety and should be promoted up to 2020. These new technologies identified as being able to improve road safety include advanced restraint systems. As a contribution to the improvement of road safety the THORAX project studied thoracic injuries. Injury mechanisms and the influence of occupant diversity factors like age and gender were investigated. The gained knowledge was implemented in numerical and experimental tools that enable the design and evaluation of advanced vehicle restraint systems which are capable of offering optimal protection {{for a wide variety of}} car occupants. To develop the improved design and evaluation tools THORAX was structured in four work packages related to accident surveys, biomechanical studies, dummy development and dummy evaluations. Work-Package 1 analysed real world car crash data to provide detailed information on the type and severity of injuries in relation to impact type, restraint type, and occupant characteristics. The survey revealed rib fracture as the predominant thoracic injury and focus for the tool developments. Detailed case studies comparing real world accidents and consumer rating tests showed that female occupants generally are at higher risk in car crashes compared to males. In Work-Package 2 a set of biomechanical requirements for an enhanced shoulder thorax complex of a frontal impact dummy was defined. A suit of Post Mortem Human Subject (PMHS) data was collected and documented in detail for reproduction with the new tools. Missing data were identified and additional tests conducted to complete the dataset. In addition injury mechanisms and governing parameters were studied using Human Body Models. For this purpose PHMS tests conducted under welldefined conditions were simulated using human body models identifying excessive bending strain in the ribs as key factor for the initiation of rib fractures. Based on this finding two injury criteria were proposed. The first correlates dummy <b>chest</b> <b>deflections</b> at four locations to fractures observed in PMHS tests under various conditions in matched dummy – PMHS tests. The second uses local strain data measured around the dummy ribs. Based on the biomechanical requirements a demonstrator dummy with improved thorax and shoulder designs was developed in Work-Package 3. Three prototypes were built and installed on available THOR dummies. The demonstrators were subjected to extensive evaluation testing, reproducing the PMHS tests collected under Work-Package 2. Testing showed a superior biofidelity of the demonstrator compared to existing HIII and THOR dummies. The data was used also to generate preliminary injury risk curves related to the criteria proposed. As a final step, in Work-Package 4, the demonstrator dummy was subjected to extensive testing in a vehicle environment to assess its sensitivity to typical state of the art vehicle restraint systems. Full scale and sled tests were performed in which the demonstrators showed increased sensitivity to different loading severities, loading directions and restraint variations compared to the HIII. The injury risk prediction using the THORAX risk curves was in line with assumed real life observations. It was also shown that current restraint systems will need updates to conform to current rating levels in terms of injury risk. As such it is expected that the THOR injury risk evaluation using risk functions for young and elderly people as well as AIS 2 + will result in further reduced injuries due to frontal injuries. During the entire runtime of the project information was shared with key stakeholders in the field. Results and findings were forwarded to Euro NCAP and the GRSP Informal Group on Frontal Impacts. Based on the THORAX findings both groups decided to include dummies representing females in their future crash test procedures. Also the GRSP Informal Group placed the THOR dummy on the agenda for their phase 2 update of the frontal impact directive for the 2020 timeframe. Information exchange with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration resulted in the preliminary adoption of the new shoulder design and thorax updates from THORAX. This design will be evaluated in 2013 by NHTSA for decision making at the end of 2013...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate new methods for predicting injury from expected spaceflight dynamic loads by leveraging a broader range of available information in injury biomechanics. Although all spacecraft designs were considered, the primary focus was the NASA Orion capsule, as the authors have the most knowledge and experience related to this design. The team defined a list of critical injuries and selected the Test Device for Human Occupant Restraint (THOR) anthropomorphic test device (ATD) as the basis for new standards and requirements. In addition, the team down selected the list of available injury metrics to the following: head injury criteria (HIC) 15, kinematic rotational brain injury criteria (BRIC), neck axial tension and compression force, maximum <b>chest</b> <b>deflection,</b> lateral shoulder force and displacement, acetabular lateral force, thoracic spine axial compression force, ankle moments, and average distal forearm speed limits. The team felt that these metrics capture all of the injuries that might be expected by a seated crewmember during vehicle aborts and landings. Using previously determined injury risk levels for nominal and off-nominal landings, appropriate injury assessment reference values (IARVs) were defined for each metric. Musculoskeletal deconditioning due to exposure to reduced gravity over time can affect injury risk during landing; therefore a deconditioning factor was applied to all IARVs. Although there are appropriate injury data for each anatomical region of interest, additional research is needed for several metrics to improve the confidence score...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the similarity between the response of the THUMS model and the Hybrid III Anthropometric Test Device (ATD) given existing Wright-Patterson (WP) sled tests. There were four tests selected for this comparison with frontal, spinal, rear, and lateral loading. The THUMS was placed in a sled configuration that replicated the WP configuration and the recorded seat acceleration for each test was applied to model seat. Once the modeling simulations were complete, they were compared to the WP results using two methods. The first was a visual inspection of the sled test videos compared to the THUMS d 3 plot files. This comparison resulted in an assessment of the overall kinematics of the two results. The other comparison was a comparison of the plotted data recorded for both tests. The metrics selected for comparison were seat acceleration, belt forces, head acceleration and chest acceleration. These metrics were recorded in all WP tests and were outputs of the THUMS model. Once the comparison of the THUMS to the WP tests was complete, the THUMS model output was also examined for possible injuries in these scenarios. These outputs included metrics for injury risk to the head, neck, thorax, lumbar spine and lower extremities. The metrics to evaluate head response were peak head acceleration, HIC 15, and HIC 36. For the neck, N (sub ij) was calculated. The thorax response was evaluated with peak chest acceleration, the Combined Thoracic Index (CTI), sternal deflection, <b>chest</b> <b>deflection,</b> and chest acceleration- 3 ms clip. The lumbar spine response was evaluated with lumbar spine force. Finally the lower extremity response was evaluated by femur and tibia force. The results of the simulation comparisons indicate the THUMS model had a similar response to the Hybrid III dummy given the same input. The primary difference seen between the two was a more flexible response of the THUMS compared to the Hybrid III. This flexibility was most pronounced in the neck flexion, shoulder deflection and <b>chest</b> <b>deflection.</b> Due to the flexibility of the THUMS, the resulting head and chest accelerations tended to lag the Hybrid III acceleration trace and have a lower peak value. The results of the injury metric comparison identified possible injury trends between simulations. Risk of head injury was highest for the lateral simulations. The risk of chest injury was highest for the rear impact. However, neck injury risk was approximately the same for all simulations. The injury metric value for lumbar spine force was highest for the spinal impact. The leg forces were highest for the rear and lateral impacts. The results of this comparison indicate the THUMS model performs in a similar manner as the Hybrid III ATD. The differences in the responses of model and the ATD are primarily due to the flexibility of the THUMS. This flexibility of the THUMS would be a more human like response. Based on the similarity between the two models, the THUMS should be used in further testing to assess risk of injury to the occupant...|$|E
40|$|The {{safety of}} {{passenger}} cars has been significantly improved {{during the last}} decades. Similar improvements are not as apparent in heavy vehicles {{and one of the}} reasons is believed to be deficiencies in heavy vehicle crash testing and the tools used to evaluate the biomechanical responses. The most commonly used dummy for frontal vehicular crash testing is the Hybrid III. This dummy was mainly intended for testing safety in passenger cars and is as such not appropriately evaluated for use in heavy vehicle driver environments. This research was initiated to evaluate the Hybrid III and its instrumentation for use in heavy vehicle frontal crash testing. The lack of appropriate biomechanical evaluation data lead to a new approach to Hybrid III chest performance evaluation. Finite element modeling was used as an alternative tool. Human body models and Hybrid III models were utilized and the results were compared. It became evident that the contact between the steering wheel rim and the driver’s chest was a critical load situation. A representative load case for heavy vehicle frontal collisions was identified. The occupant models were then evaluated using the best available validation setup. The THUMS proved to be the best available human body substitute in this context. The THUMS was thus used, coupled with the better of the two available Hybrid III models. A suitable Hybrid III <b>chest</b> <b>deflection</b> instrumentation has been identified and a transfer function between the Hybrid III chest response, during steering wheel rim contact, and established chest injury criteria were developed...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of the present work was to develop and use mathematical models to establish principles for protective systems for occupants in car-to-car side impacts. The efforts in this work have concentrated on {{the protection of the}} thorax and abdomen since these body parts are most frequently injured in side impacts. The chosen approach was to develop general-purpose mathematical models since developing occupant protection systems by means of mechanical tests is very costly and time consuming. The models were subsequently used to evaluate a large number of design parameters. The mathematical models developed and implemented were: 1) a model of the BIOSID dummy, and 2) a hybrid model consisting of occupant, vehicle and impacting barrier. The BIOSID model was used in sled simulations to evaluate the potential injury-reducing benefits of padding or airbags in side impacts. The BIOSID dummy model was validated by means of mechanical pendulum tests at two impact velocities. The sled model, including the BIOSID, was validated by means of mechanical sled tests at two impact velocities: with padding or with airbags mounted to the door. The hybrid model was used in crash simulations to evaluate the effects of barrier type and vehicle modifications on injury response. Models of the EUROSID- 1 and US-SID dummies and a model of the human body were used as occupants. Models of the EEVC foam and NHTSA honeycomb side-impact barriers were the impacting object. The EUROSID and US-SID models were validated by means of pendulum tests at one velocity, and the barrier models were validated by means of rigid-wall impact tests at one velocity. The baseline vehicle model including dummies and barriers were validated by means of crash tests according to the NHTSA and EEVC side impact test methods. The sled model, including the BIOSID dummy model, was used to establish the occupant protection system that would result in the efficient protection of the occupant. The lowest TTI was obtained with the airbag with 0 kPa initial over-pressure and 1500 mm 2 ventilation area, while the lowest <b>chest</b> <b>deflection</b> and chest VC were obtained with an airbag with 40 kPa initial over-pressure and 2000 mm 2 ventilation area. Significantly reduced pelvis acceleration was obtained with 75 mm of compliant padding. The risk of the head impacting the side window was significantly reduced with an airbag mounted on the door. It was found that the airbag must be at least 120 mm thick when fully inflated in order to significantly reduce injury risks. It was also found that if the arm and shoulder of the occupant are not engaged by the intruding structures in the impact, significantly higher injury measures would be obtained than if they are engaged. The hybrid model was used to establish the most violent barrier for the occupant. In addition, occupant responses to vehicle modification were evaluated. Generally the TTI predicted by the EUROSID were higher than those predicted by the US-SID. The <b>chest</b> <b>deflection</b> and chest VC predicted by the EUROSID were similar to those predicted by the human body. It was found that significantly reduced injury measures were obtained with the addition of thick padding at higher impact velocities. At lower impact velocities, padding produced no injury-reducing benefits. Impact with the EEVC barrier was more violent for the occupant than impact with the NHTSA barrier; thus, higher dummy readings were obtained with the EEVC barrier. It is shown that vehicle improvement to reduce injury risks in side impacts did not necessarily entail the stiffening or strengthening of the structure. Modifying the structure to minimize the dummy readings for one side-impact barrier may at other impact velocities and other impacting objects result in increased injury risks. The advantage of the mathematical modeling approach is that it provides a quick and economical means of developing principles for occupant protection systems...|$|E
40|$|Objective: This study {{aimed at}} {{investigating}} {{the effects of}} vehicle impact velocity, vehicle front-end shape, and pedestrian size on injury risk to pedestrians in collisions with passenger vehicles with various frontal shapes. Method: A series of parametric studies was carried out using 2 total human model for safety (THUMS) pedestrian models (177 and 165 cm) and 4 vehicle finite element (FE) models with different front-end shapes (medium-size sedan, minicar, one-box vehicle, and sport utility vehicle [SUV]). The effects of the impact velocity on pedestrian injury risk were analyzed at velocities of 20, 30, 40, and 50 km/h. The dynamic response of the pedestrian was investigated, and the injury risk to the head, chest, pelvis, and lower extremities was compared {{in terms of the}} injury parameters head injury criteria (HIC), <b>chest</b> <b>deflection,</b> and von Mises stress distribution of the rib cage, pelvis force, and bending moment diagram of the lower extremities. Result: Vehicle impact velocity has the most significant influence on injury severity for adult pedestrians. All injury parameters can be reduced in severity by decreasing vehicle impact velocities. The head and lower extremities are at greater risk of injury in medium-size sedan and SUV collisions. The chest injury risk was particularly high in one-box vehicle impacts. The fracture risk of the pelvis was also high in one-box vehicle and SUV collisions. In minicar collisions, the injury risk was the smallest if the head did not make contact with the A-pillar. Conclusion: The vehicle impact velocity and vehicle front-end shape are 2 dominant factors that influence the pedestrian kinematics and injury severity. A significant reduction of all injuries can be achieved for all vehicle types when the vehicle impact velocity is less than 30 km/h. Vehicle designs consisting of a short front-end and a wide windshield area can protect pedestrians from fatalities. The results also could be valuable in the design of a pedestrian-friendly vehicle front-end shape...|$|E
40|$|The present work {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} injuries following car-to-car side collisions. The injuries {{in this type of}} impact have been evaluated to form the basis for the development of test methods and for the principles of protective systems. Side impacts give rise to relatively more severe injuries than frontal impacts. The study has shown that the neck and the legs of the struck side occupant need to be better protected due to a high risk of permanent disabilities. The head, chest and abdomen/pelvis need to be better protected from a risk of life-threatening injuries. It has also been found that chest injuries increase significantly with age. Improved protection in side impacts can be achieved with car body/door reinforcements and compliant bolstering (padding and/or airbag) {{on the inside of the}} door. In order to develop and evaluate the principles of such protective systems a subsystem sled test method that simulates full-scale test conditions has been developed. The BioSid dummy was used. The use of a chest airbag (8 litre and unventilated) resulted in significantly lower loadings to the chest compared to (50 mm thick) compliant chest padding of polyethylene foam type, and significantly lower loadings to the head, neck and abdomen than a stiff reference door. Pelvis padding (75 mm thick) of the same material effectively reduced the pelvic loads. Both the acceleration based chest injury criterion TTI and the deformation based criterion VC were considerably reduced compared to a stiff door. The head ejection through the side window frame was reduced by an average of 30 mm. To further enhance the protection level, the airbag was increased to 12 litres in volume to cover both the chest and the abdomen down to the door armrest level. The effect of bag pressure and bag ventilation was investigated at two side impact severities. The ventilation of the bag reduced the maximum <b>chest</b> <b>deflection</b> by 30 % and the maximum chest viscous criterion, VC, by 50 % (comparison was made with the same bag without ventilation). A suitable initial bag (over) pressure was found to be about 40 kPa, when the loading of the abdomen was also taken into consideration. The deflection based criteria were found to be very sensitive to the door velocity. The stiffness of the bag corresponds to the tolerance level of the thorax of elderly people. The 12 litre ventilated side airbag resulted in 30 - 40 % lower <b>chest</b> <b>deflection</b> and about 60 % lower VC than 50 mm of another compliant chest padding material (Ethafoam 220 of polyethylene foam). TTI was 30 - 45 % lower. The findings from the evaluation of the airbag (size, initial pressure, ventilation) are also applicable to seat mounted side airbags of the type Autoliv has developed together with Volvo. To further improve the protection of the head/neck in side impacts a supplementary protective device "the curtain" at the side window has been proposed. In an investigation carried out together with the Birmingham University it was found that the optimum location for a side airbag sensor is the rear lower quadrant of the front door. A sensor located in this sector would cover almost 90 % of the impacts with risk of AIS 3 + injuries. A pendulum subsystem test method for the evaluation of sensors for side airbags has been developed and validated against low speed full-scale tests. The method has been used for evaluation of a pyrotechnical sensor. The sensor fires at impact speeds above 15 - 20 km/h, when there is a risk of life threatening (AIS 3 +) injuries to struck side occupants and not at low impact speeds (7 km/h), when the risk of injury is minimal. The principle finding in the study was that protective systems in side impacts must be softer than the corresponding human body segments. This was best accomplished with a ventilated side airbag for the chest and the abdomen (down to the armrest level) and padding for the pelvis and the leg. The proposed "curtain" will further enhance the head/neck protection...|$|E
40|$|Objective: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} and propose improvements to the injury mitigation systems, in near-side impacts, for 6 common sitting positions of young adolescents using a previously validated model. Methods: The evaluation was made by using a model of a complete passenger car, including head and thorax–pelvis air bags, which was impacted laterally by a barrier in 2 load cases. The SID-IIs finite element model was used for the evaluations and was seated in 6 different positions in the rear outboard seat: the nominal anthropomorphic test device (ATD) position, 1 inboard position, 3 outboard positions, and 1 braking (forward) position. These positions have previously been identified as common sitting positions in awake and asleep children. The studied dependent variables were head injury criterion (HIC) 36, resultant head linear acceleration, resultant head rotational acceleration, chest viscous criterion, and <b>chest</b> <b>deflection.</b> Results: The lowest head injury measures were seen in the braking positions and in the nominal ATD position, and the highest were seen in the inboard and outboard positions. The lowest chest injury measures were recorded in the inboard and nominal ATD positions, and the highest were recorded in the outboard and braking positions. The occupant in the outboard positions interfered with the air bags during their deployment. The occupant in inboard and braking positions tended to push the curtain air bag over the windowsill. Conclusions: Studies that investigate the injury mitigation effects in common sitting positions, beyond the nominal ATD position, are essential to highlight means to provide improved and robust safety for child occupants. This study was based on the SID-IIs 5 th percentile female, which has very similar anthropometry to a 50 th percentile 12 -year-old. Therefore, the conclusions of this study are applicable to many 11 -year-olds up to young adolescents, as well as to small females. The outboard and inboard positions of this study resulted in the highest head injury measures. Although all of the injury measures were only slightly higher than the nominal position, the trends suggest that, in near-side impacts, these positions should be discouraged. The extensively outboard positions resulted in unfavorable air bag positioning during deployment. The inboard position resulted in head strikes further forward of the nominal one; the curtain air bags need inflated cells at all locations of head strike...|$|E
40|$|In {{recent years}} an {{increasing}} interest has evolved concerning seat integrated safety belts in cars, regarding both 3 - and 4 -point belts in various configurations. One safety advantage of seat integrated safety belts {{appears in the}} case of so-called small overlap crashes. One consequence of a small overlap crash can be that the colliding cars strike each other's sides hitting both the A- and B-pillar. Hence, the A- as well as the B-pillar are pushed inwards and backwards. In this case, belt anchor points on the B-pillar may also be pushed backwards and the belt will be stretched over the occupant. The {{purpose of the present study}} was to investigate seat integrated safety belt configurations that may involve a seat structure design that intentionally deforms and absorbs energy during a crash. Common 3 -point configurations were used as references. The aim was to investigate how the physical properties influence the interaction of the seat back frame and the safety belt. Numerical simulations were carried out using the explicit LS-DYNA FE-analysis software. A FE-model of a seat structure, floor pan and B-pillar was established. A 50 th percentile Hybrid III FE-dummy model was used as occupant and for studying the biomechanical responses. Different physical properties of the seat structure and different belt load limit forces were used as parametric variables. Only frontal crashes were considered. Responses concerning <b>chest</b> <b>deflection,</b> head- and chest displacement, change of pelvis angle, pelvis submarining tendency, lap- and torso belt forces, seat back frame deflection, ride-down efficiency, seat structure natural frequency, upper neck loads and neck injury criteria were studied. The results indicate that the belt-webbing distribution between the lap and the torso belts via a slip-ring and in combination with a non-rigid seat back frame increases the ride-down efficiency compared to a system with no belt-webbing distribution. Further, the combined use of different energy absorption mechanisms influences the biomechanical response as well as the structural response of an integrated safety belt configuration. An optimal solution with respect to multiple objectives requires a proper combination of parameters. Beside the optimisation of traditional biomechanical responses, the multiple objectives can be the minimisation of weight and cost as well as optimal control of passenger kinematics. The present study will hopefully create a basis for future research and possibly for the design of seat integrated safety belts. Godkänd; 2006; 20070109 (haneit...|$|E
