5|$|At Potsdam, Truman {{agreed to}} a request from Winston Churchill that Britain be {{represented}} when the atomic bomb was dropped. William Penney and Group Captain Leonard Cheshire were sent to Tinian, but found that LeMay would not let them accompany the mission. All they <b>could</b> <b>do</b> was send a strongly worded signal back to Wilson.|$|E
5|$|Chevelle {{has been}} {{classified}} as alternative metal, post-grunge, and hard rock. The band's albums Wonder What's Next and This Type of Thinking (<b>Could</b> <b>Do</b> Us In) both {{are described as}} nu metal.|$|E
5|$|Even though Harris and his {{soldiers}} vigilantly enforced the rules, arresting many violators, {{there was no}} legal authority for prosecution or punishment. All Harris <b>could</b> <b>do</b> was expel violators from the park.|$|E
6000|$|... "How? <b>Could</b> Lloyd George <b>do</b> it, <b>could</b> Winston <b>do</b> it, <b>could</b> Baldwin <b>do</b> it? No. Not {{since you}} had those bars of yours put on." ...|$|R
6000|$|Hodder was silent. The thought {{struck him}} with {{tremendous}} force. Had he suggested it? And how--why? <b>Could</b> it be <b>done?</b> <b>Could</b> he <b>do</b> it or begin it? ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Sir John Joram has {{got other}} fish to fry before this time. It's a marvel to me, Bagwax, {{that they should}} give way to all this nonsense. If {{anything}} <b>could</b> be <b>done,</b> it <b>could</b> be <b>done</b> in half the time,--and if anything <b>could</b> be <b>done,</b> it <b>could</b> be <b>done</b> here. By the time you're back from Sydney, Caldigate's time will be half out. Why don't you let Sir John see your proof? You don't want to lose your trip, I suppose.' ...|$|R
5|$|Here and there, {{there are}} some people who are supremely endowed. My memory goes back to Jim Thorpe. He never practiced in his life, and he <b>could</b> <b>do</b> {{anything}} better than any other football player I ever saw.|$|E
5|$|It was {{released}} on February 8, 2001 by Red Hill Records which went bankrupt before it <b>could</b> <b>do</b> any marketing, subsequently the album sold fewer than 200 copies and received mixed reviews.|$|E
5|$|Macrae, Ismay and Churchill all saw fit {{to record}} these {{arguments}} over the technical issue of stickiness. As Eden had pointed out, {{there was a}} lot at stake. The British infantry and Home Guard had little with which to put up a fight against tanks and to any who had witnessed trials of Molotov Cocktails and SIP grenades it was evident that they <b>could</b> <b>do</b> little to a modern tank other than to provide a blinding pall of smoke. What was needed was a hand weapon to deliver a coup de grâce by punching through the armoured plate. The sticky bomb <b>could</b> <b>do</b> the job and little else was available.|$|E
6000|$|LESLIE. What is my honour {{but your}} happiness? In what else does it consist? Is it in denying me my heart? {{is it in}} visiting another's sin upon the innocent? <b>Could</b> I <b>do</b> that, and be my mother's son? <b>Could</b> I <b>do</b> that, and bear my father's name? <b>Could</b> I <b>do</b> that, and have ever been found worthy of you? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>could</b> not <b>do</b> it, ma'am! I am sorry, {{sorry to}} the heart, to seem ungrateful for her kindness; but, indeed, I <b>could</b> not <b>do</b> it. I cannot leave {{my sister and}} the children." ...|$|R
5000|$|Upward {{counterfactual}} thinking {{focuses on}} how the situation could have been better. Many times, people {{think about what they}} <b>could</b> have <b>done</b> differently. For example, [...] "If I started studying three days ago, instead of last night, I <b>could</b> have <b>done</b> better on my test." [...] Since people often think about what they <b>could</b> have <b>done</b> differently, {{it is not uncommon for}} people to feel regret during upward counterfactual thinking.|$|R
5|$|One of the {{strengths}} of Hippocratic medicine was its emphasis on prognosis. At Hippocrates' time, medicinal therapy was quite immature, and often {{the best thing that}} physicians <b>could</b> <b>do</b> was to evaluate an illness and predict its likely progression based upon data collected in detailed case histories.|$|E
5|$|Pickingill {{was also}} known for his purported ability to control animals, namely horses, and it was {{believed}} that when he struck a hedgerow with his stick, game animals would run out that could then be caught, killed and eaten. It was also rumoured that he <b>could</b> <b>do</b> things faster than ordinary human beings, and that he <b>could</b> <b>do</b> an hour's job in only a few minutes, with some believing that he got his imps—his familiar spirits—to do the job for him. Maple also noted that people who visited his cottage reported seeing ornaments and furniture dancing around the room of their own accord; the folklorist believed that this story had originated in a Dutch folkloric tradition that may have been imported to Essex when many Dutch migrants settled there in the seventeenth century.|$|E
5|$|Simulations {{showed that}} the {{aircraft}} would be essentially unstoppable by existing or projected air defenses; even surface-to-air missiles armed with nuclear warheads <b>could</b> <b>do</b> no better than force the aircraft to change course to avoid the fringe effects of the explosions.|$|E
6000|$|... "So I did, nearly--" [...] said Lady Laura; [...] "very nearly. You told me {{just now}} that you had money, and <b>could</b> {{therefore}} <b>do</b> as you pleased. I had no money, and <b>could</b> not <b>do</b> as I pleased." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah; {{that is what}} I {{would explain}} to you now,--here on this very spot,--if I <b>could.</b> <b>Does</b> it not seem odd that a girl should have all that she wants offered to her, and yet {{not be able to}} take it?" ...|$|R
60|$|Gent. Alas, Amy! what <b>could</b> I <b>do?</b> Things {{were driven}} to the last {{extremity}} before I went. I <b>could</b> have <b>done</b> nothing but help starve them all if I had stayed; and, besides, I {{could not bear to}} see it.|$|R
5|$|There were various {{experimental}} illustrations showing what {{an electrical}} fire engine <b>could</b> <b>do</b> {{better than a}} steam fire engine if the complete system was put into operation. One set up demonstration was at the Crystal palace electrical exhibition of 1892.|$|E
5|$|Though Caravan had yet {{to achieve}} strong {{commercial}} success in 1970, they had started to build a live following, including an appearance at the Kralingen Pop Festival in the Netherlands {{to an audience of}} 250,000 and the 10th Plumpton Festival. In between touring, the group had written several new pieces that they wanted to record. Having had problems self-producing the previous album, If I <b>Could</b> <b>Do</b> It All Over Again, I'd Do It All Over You, the group decided to collaborate with producer David Hitchcock. Hitchcock had become a fan of the band and had been a key figure in getting them signed to Decca Records. He had progressed from the label's art department to production and was keen to work on the album. The group had been apprehensive about Hitchcock working on If I <b>Could</b> <b>Do</b> It All Over Again... but after discovering his enthusiasm and creative ideas, decided {{it would be a good}} idea to enrol him as producer.|$|E
5|$|A two-day {{political}} crisis followed the raid. It {{was obvious to}} the Ottoman government what Enver had allowed to occur. As soon as {{the news of the}} attack reached Istanbul, the Grand Vizier and the Cabinet forced Enver to wire a ceasefire order to Souchon. Several officials, including the Grand Vizier, threatened to resign in protest. Four later would, including Djavid Bey. Though many in the government thought it opportune to attack Russia, solidarity was regarded as vital and a letter of apology was soon drafted. On 31 October Enver informed the Germans of the planned apology and said there was nothing he <b>could</b> <b>do.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "What <b>could</b> I <b>do</b> with Lady Penwether, Duke? Or what <b>could</b> she <b>do</b> with him? A man won't {{care for}} what his sister says to him. And I don't suppose she'd {{undertake}} {{to speak to}} Lord Rufford on the subject." ...|$|R

3000|$|... “And {{by having}} a {{standard}} set of data that could be utilised, it means that better cross-institution research <b>could</b> be <b>done,</b> better comparisons with other institutes <b>could</b> be <b>done,</b> and performance between countries could even be then more easily compared.” (Orthopaedic surgeon 2).|$|R
5|$|Actors {{and crew}} used their iPhones to {{communicate}} and store information such as the script—that way, they looked like guests casually using their phones. The phones were also used to record sound, in addition to digital recorders taped to each actor's body that were left running all day. For day scenes, Moore felt comfortable risking {{only three or four}} takes of each scene, but found he <b>could</b> <b>do</b> more at night.|$|E
5|$|After the {{governor}} and his department decided that the state <b>could</b> <b>do</b> without the $3.8million (1978USD) that the toll would produce each year, a bill permitting the state {{to take over the}} Loop Parkway was passed on March31, 1978. The removal of the tolls helped Governor Carey gain enough support to pass that year's state budget. The decision to eliminate the Loop Parkway tolls was influenced by Long Beach Supervisor Hannah Komanoff, who also unsuccessfully fought to have the tollbooth on the Atlantic Beach Bridge removed in 1979.|$|E
5|$|Alarmed by over grazing of meadows, logging {{of giant}} sequoia, and other damage, Muir changed {{from being a}} {{promoter}} and scientist to an advocate for further protection. He persuaded many influential people to camp {{with him in the}} area, such as Ralph Waldo Emerson in 1871. Muir tried to convince his guests that the entire area should be under federal protection. None of his guests through the 1880s <b>could</b> <b>do</b> much for Muir's cause, except for Robert Underwood Johnson, editor of Century Magazine. Through Johnson, Muir had a national audience for his writing and a highly motivated and crafty congressional lobbyist.|$|E
6000|$|... "Just so. They came to {{see what}} was up and what <b>could</b> be <b>done,</b> found that nothin' partiklar was up an' nothin' at all <b>could</b> be <b>done,</b> so off they go, mounted, to fish in other waters. Just as well for us." ...|$|R
60|$|Patty {{went downstairs}} and {{stood for a}} moment in the hall, rapt in reflection. If she had been at home, she verily {{believed}} she would have sat down and cried. Oh, it was too bad, too disappointing! Clifford would certainly lose all chance of the permanency, even if the irate news editor did not discharge him at once. What <b>could</b> she <b>do?</b> <b>Could</b> she <b>do</b> anything? She must do something.|$|R
6000|$|... "These are comforts {{which we}} {{have no right to}} expect. I <b>could</b> not have <b>done</b> much for poor Mary; but what a man <b>could</b> have <b>done</b> should not have been wanting." ...|$|R
5|$|Alfred A. Knopf, Inc. {{had planned}} to publish The Well of Loneliness in the United States {{at the same time}} as Cape in the United Kingdom. But after Cape brought forward the {{publication}} date, Knopf found itself in the position of publishing a book that had been withdrawn in its home country. They refused, telling Hall that nothing they <b>could</b> <b>do</b> would keep the book from being treated as pornography.|$|E
5|$|Although Constantine was {{reluctant}} to leave England, his poor health necessitated a return to Trinidad, but before he <b>could</b> <b>do</b> so {{he died of a}} heart attack, probably brought about by bronchitis, on 1 July 1971. His body was flown to Trinidad, where he received a state funeral before being buried in Arouca. He was posthumously awarded Trinidad's highest honour, the Trinity Cross. Later in the month, a memorial service was held in London in Westminster Abbey.|$|E
5|$|Although Du Bois {{generally}} endorsed socialist principles, {{his politics}} were strictly pragmatic: in 1929, Du Bois endorsed Democrat Jimmy Walker {{for mayor of}} New York, rather than the socialist Norman Thomas, believing that Walker <b>could</b> <b>do</b> more immediate good for blacks, even though Thomas' platform was more consistent with Du Bois's views. Throughout the 1920s, Du Bois and the NAACP shifted support {{back and forth between}} the Republican Party and the Democratic Party, induced by promises from the candidates to fight lynchings, improve working conditions, or support voting rights in the South; invariably, the candidates failed to deliver on their promises.|$|E
6000|$|But Mrs. Crawley did {{not give}} the nod of assent. With her face still averted, while the tears were still running down her cheeks, she muttered but a word or two. [...] "I <b>could</b> not <b>do</b> that, Lady Lufton; I <b>could</b> not <b>do</b> that." ...|$|R
60|$|What <b>could</b> I <b>do</b> but follow him? I {{have often}} asked myself the {{question}} since; {{but what else}} <b>could</b> I <b>do?</b> His manner was so final, and I was so astonished, that I followed where he led, as if I had been under a spell.|$|R
60|$|It {{would have}} been his nature to share them with Alfred, but he <b>could</b> not <b>do</b> so without saying where he had been, and that he <b>could</b> not <b>do,</b> so he gave one to Dick, and {{swallowed}} the rest {{to keep out the}} cold.|$|R
