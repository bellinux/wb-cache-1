40|$|We {{propose a}} {{temporal}} extension of Datalog {{which can be}} used to model and query temporal databases with relations based on multiple <b>clocks.</b> The extension, called <b>Clocked</b> Temporal Datalog, is based on a <b>clocked</b> temporal logic in which each predicate and hence each formula can be assigned a separate <b>clock.</b> A <b>Clocked</b> Temporal Datalog program consists of three parts: (1) a <b>clock</b> definition, (2) a <b>clock</b> assignment, and (3) a program body. The <b>clock</b> definition specifies all the available <b>clocks.</b> The <b>clock</b> assignment assigns to each predicate defined in the program body a <b>clock</b> from the <b>clock</b> definition.

50|$|In {{telecommunication}} and horology, a slave <b>clock</b> is a <b>clock</b> {{that depends}} for its accuracy on another <b>clock,</b> a master <b>clock.</b> Many modern <b>clocks</b> are synchronized, either through the Internet or by radio time signals, to a worldwide time standard called Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) {{based on a}} network of master atomic <b>clocks</b> in many countries. For scientific purposes, precision <b>clocks</b> can be synchronized to within a few nanoseconds by dedicated satellite channels. Slave <b>clock</b> synchronization is usually achieved by phase-locking the slave <b>clock</b> signal to a signal received from the master <b>clock.</b> To adjust for the transit time of the signal from the master <b>clock</b> to the slave <b>clock,</b> the phase of the slave <b>clock</b> may be adjusted {{with respect to the}} signal from the master <b>clock</b> so that both <b>clocks</b> are in phase. Thus, the time markers of both <b>clocks,</b> at the output of the <b>clocks,</b> occur simultaneously.|$|R
50|$|A <b>clock</b> {{that employs}} {{electricity}} {{in some form}} to power a conventional <b>clock</b> mechanism is an electromechanical <b>clock.</b> Any spring or weight driven <b>clock</b> that uses electricity (either AC or DC) to rewind the spring or raise {{the weight of a}} mechanical <b>clock</b> then is an electromechanical <b>clock.</b> In electromechanical <b>clocks</b> the electricity serves no time keeping function. The timekeeping function is regulated by the pendulum. Near {{the end of the nineteenth}} century, the availability of the dry cell battery made it practical to use electric power in <b>clocks.</b> The use of electricity then led to many variations of <b>clock</b> and motor designs. Electromechanical <b>clocks</b> were made as individual timepieces but most commonly were used as integral parts of synchronized time installations. Experience in telegraphy led to connecting remote <b>clocks</b> (slave <b>clocks)</b> via wires to a controlling (master <b>clock)</b> <b>clock.</b> The goal was to create a <b>clock</b> system where each <b>clock</b> displayed exactly the same time. The master and the slaves are electromechanical <b>clocks.</b> The master <b>clock</b> has a conventional self-winding <b>clock</b> mechanism that is rewound electrically. The slave <b>clock</b> mechanism is not a conventional <b>clock</b> mechanism as it consists only of a ratchet wheel and time train. Slave <b>clocks</b> rely upon electrical impulses from the master <b>clock</b> to mechanically move the <b>clock</b> hands one unit of time. Synchronized time systems are made up of one master <b>clock</b> and any number of slave <b>clocks.</b> The slave <b>clocks</b> are connected by wires to the master <b>clock.</b> These systems are found in locations where multiple <b>clocks</b> would be used such as learning institutions, businesses, factories, transportation networks, banks, offices and government facilities. A notable example of this type of system is the Shortt-Synchronome <b>clock,</b> which is an example of an electromechanical gravity remontoire. These self-winding <b>clock</b> systems were usually low voltage DC. They were installed thru the 1950s and by then systems with synchronous motor <b>clocks</b> were becoming the <b>clock</b> system of choice.|$|R
50|$|System designs usually {{encompass}} {{more than}} several <b>clock</b> domains with signals traversing separate domains. On-board <b>clock</b> oscillators and global <b>clock</b> lines usually mitigate these issues, but sometimes these resources {{may be limited}} or not fulfill all design requirements. Internal <b>clocks</b> should be implemented within FPGA devices since <b>clock</b> line and <b>clock</b> buffers connections are limited between FPGAs. Internal <b>clocked</b> designs which are partitioned across multiple FPGAs should replicate the <b>clock</b> generator within the FPGA, ensuring a low <b>clock</b> skew between inter-FPGA signals. In addition, any gated <b>clock</b> logic should be transformed to <b>clock</b> enables to reduce skew while operating at high <b>clock</b> frequencies.|$|R

It {{was the first time}} she had ever beaten Mitchell. She earned her second gold by swimming the lead-off backstroke leg for the first-place U.S. team in the women's 4×100-meter medley relay event, sharing the honors with her American teammates Tracy Caulkins (breaststroke), Mary T. Meagher (butterfly), and Nancy Hogshead (freestyle), and <b>clocking</b> a winning time of 4:08.34.

5|$|The inaugural Giro used a points {{system to}} {{determine}} the race winner. The organizers chose to have a points system over a system based around elapsed time after the scandal that engulfed the 1904 Tour de France. Another factor in the organizer's decision {{was that it would}} be cheaper to count the placings of the riders rather than <b>clocking</b> their times during each stage. The race leader was determined by adding up each rider's placing in each stage. Thus if a rider placed second in the first stage and third in the second stage he would have a total of five points, and whoever had the lowest points total was the leader. Under this system Luigi Ganna was declared the winner, but had the Giro been a time-based event he would have lost to the third-place finisher Giovanni Rossignoli by 37 minutes.|$|E

With the Americans and many other western swimmers absent, Australian officials were confident that their three entrants in the 100m backstroke, Kerry, Tonelli and Glenn Patching, would all make the final and win medals. Kerry came third in both his heat and semi-final, <b>clocking</b> 58.08s and 58.07s respectively, missing out on the final by just 0.02s. He was the ninth fastest in the closely run semifinals, with the third fastest qualifier being only 0.18s faster.

He then {{combined with}} Tom Stachewicz, Paul Lee and Barry Armstrong, as Western Australia won the 4100m freestyle relay for the first time. Brooks maintained his form and despite not defending his Australian 100m title, was selected for the 1986 Commonwealth Games in Edinburgh, where he came second to Fasala in the 100m freestyle {{in a time of}} 51.01s. He claimed gold in the 4100m freestyle relay along with Fasala, Stockwell and Matthew Renshaw, anchoring the quartet in setting a Commonwealth Games record. On the return flight, he consumed 46 cans of beer and was banned for six months after he talked about the incident during a television interview. In his memoirs, Talbot, a non-drinker, cited Brooks and his Mean Machine teammates as being one of the biggest proponents of a hard-drinking culture that had permeated the Australian swimming scene at the time. In particular, he singled out Brooks as being a focal point of disruptive activity during his time at the Australian Institute of Sport. Talbot sees alcohol as the main reason behind the collapse of Australia's standing in the swimming world in the 1970s and the subsequent prolonged period of international uncompetitiveness in the 1980s.|$|E

In the 200m, Evans came second in his heat but was not fast {{enough to make the}} final, swimming 1.47s slower than the slowest qualifier to finish 17th. The final event for Evans was the 4×100m medley relay. Evans was joined by Kerry, while Glenn Buchanan and Mark Stockwell swum the butterfly and freestyle respectively. The Americans were overwhelming favourites, boasting the gold medallists in three of the respective individual events. The hosts easily won the gold by almost four seconds; Evans and the Australians were third, relegated from the silver medal by just 0.02s by the Canadian team, having been in the bronze medal position at every change. Evans recorded the second-fastest breaststroke split, slower than Lundquist, but quicker than the rest, including Davis.|$|E

Tapes of Secretariat and Cañonero II were played side by side by CBS, and Secretariat got {{to the finish line}} first on tape, though this was not a reliable method of timing a horse race at the time. The Maryland Jockey Club, which managed the Pimlico racetrack and is responsible for maintaining Preakness records, discarded both the electronic and Daily Racing Form times and recognized the clocker's 1:54 as the official time; however, the Daily Racing Form, {{for the first time in}} history, printed its own <b>clocking</b> of 1:53 underneath the official time in the chart of the race.|$|E
