5|$|The {{northern}} part of the commune is hilly but relatively favorable to agriculture, while the southern part is flat and characterized by sand dunes. Sixteen caves are found within the area. The earth is mainly composed of stony rocks, sandy loam soils, and <b>clay</b> <b>loam</b> soils in the beds of wadis in the area. The soils in the hills have pockets of alluvium and sandy loam suitable for crop development, particularly on the hillsides and {{at the foot of the}} hills. <b>Clay</b> <b>loam</b> soils are found in the bowls and beds of wadis, which although suitable for farming are susceptible to gully and water erosion during the rainy season.|$|E
25|$|Soils in Columbia {{are well}} drained in most cases, with grayish brown loamy sand topsoil. The subsoil may be {{yellowish}} red sandy <b>clay</b> <b>loam</b> (Orangeburg series), yellowish brown sandy <b>clay</b> <b>loam</b> (Norfolk series), or strong brown sandy clay (Marlboro series). All {{belong to the}} Ultisol soil order.|$|E
25|$|The {{central area}} principally {{consists}} of Magallanes loam with streaks of Magallanes <b>clay</b> <b>loam</b> of sandy texture. This {{is recommended for}} diversified farming such as the cultivation of upland rice, corn, sugarcane, vegetables, coconut, coffee, mangoes and other fruit trees. The steep phase should be forested or planted to rootcrops. The eastern side of Cavite consists of Carmona <b>clay</b> <b>loam</b> with streaks of Carmona <b>clay</b> <b>loam</b> steep phase and Carmona sandy <b>clay</b> <b>loam.</b> This type of soil is granular with tuffaceaous material and concretions. It is hard and compact when dry, sticky and plastic when wet. This type of soil is planted to rice with irrigation or sugarcane without irrigation. Fruit trees such as mango, avocado and citrus are also grown {{in this type of}} soil. Guingua fine sandy loam is found along the lower part of Malabon and Alang-ilang River at Noveleta.|$|E
25|$|The soils of Austin {{range from}} shallow, gravelly <b>clay</b> <b>loams</b> over {{limestone}} {{in the western}} outskirts to deep, fine sandy <b>loams,</b> silty <b>clay</b> <b>loams,</b> silty <b>clays</b> or clays in the city's eastern part. Some of the clays have pronounced shrink-swell properties and are difficult to work under most moisture conditions. Many of Austin's soils, especially the clay-rich types, are slightly to moderately alkaline and have free calcium carbonate.|$|R
5000|$|... 83% of {{the land}} is used for agriculture. A large portion of the soils in the {{watershed}} are silt and <b>clay</b> <b>loams.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{land around}} {{the village is}} used for arable farming and grassland. The soil overlies Lias Limestone with shallow well-drained {{calcareous}} <b>clays</b> and <b>clay</b> <b>loams.</b>|$|R
25|$|Houston {{is largely}} {{located within the}} Northern Humid Gulf Coast Prairies level IV {{ecoregion}} (34a), {{a subset of the}} Western Gulf coastal grasslands level III region as defined by the United States Environmental Protection Agency. This region is generally underlaid by Quaternary-aged sand, silts, and clays (clay, <b>clay</b> <b>loam,</b> or sandy <b>clay</b> <b>loam)</b> and covered by grasslands with occasional clusters of oak trees.|$|E
25|$|The most readily {{accessed}} eastern slopes have a predominant {{occurrence of}} Goulding <b>clay</b> <b>loam</b> soils, {{particularly in the}} immediate area of Graham Creek. These are generally areas of 15 to 30 percent slopes that support dense mixed oak woodland, with large percentages of California laurel and bigleaf maple. Higher on the eastern slopes is a large occurrence of Goulding <b>clay</b> <b>loam</b> on 30 to 50 percent slope, still with a dense forest cover, but with more Pacific madrone and coast live oak. Soil depths are rarely over a few feet deep before bedrock is reached, but even thin soils support rich plant growth {{because of the high}} nutrient content and mild climate.|$|E
25|$|Broadleaf {{evergreen}} plants, including palms, dominate Brownsville {{neighborhoods to}} a greater degree than is seen elsewhere in Texasâ€”even in nearby cities such as Harlingen and McAllen. Soils are mostly of clay to silty <b>clay</b> <b>loam</b> texture, moderately alkaline (pH 8.2) to strongly alkaline (pH8.5) and with a significant degree of salinity in many places.|$|E
50|$|It {{prefers to}} grow in soils that contain limestone. But it is {{tolerant}} of other soils including rich <b>clay</b> <b>loams,</b> neutral dry soils, or a 'peat bed' (with mainly leafmold and rotting wood).|$|R
50|$|The soil in {{the park}} is clayey. In the Kidepo Valley, black chalky <b>clay</b> and sandy-clay <b>loam</b> predominate, while the Narus Valley has freer-draining red <b>clays</b> and <b>loams.</b>|$|R
50|$|Found in {{a variety}} of terrains {{including}} Flats, hills, breakaways, wetlands, fringing salt marches and beside drainage lines it is able to grow in red-brown <b>clay</b> <b>loams,</b> orange-brown sandy <b>clays,</b> gravel and grey sandy soils over limestone, granite or laterite.|$|R
25|$|The topsoil on {{the grounds}} {{previous}} outfield was a sandy <b>clay</b> <b>loam,</b> which struggled to cope with Bridgetown's occasional heavy rainfall, with climate data indicating that a storm lasting {{up to an hour}} could dump about 50mm of rain once every five years. The topsoil was a complete mixture of soils and significantly varied in depth, lying over ancient coral reef limestone.|$|E
25|$|Maule {{lies at the}} {{southern}} end of the Central Valley and is one of the coolest wine producing areas in Chile, although the Maule River flowing east to west has a moderating effect on the climate. The river also provides the different alluvial soil types found around the region, which included granite, red <b>clay,</b> <b>loam</b> and gravel. On the slopes where the vineyards grow, the soils are free-draining and more fertile on the valley floor.|$|E
25|$|The {{alluvium}} {{which is}} found in the Indo-Gangetic plain belongs to this era. It was eroded from the Himalayas by the rivers and the monsoons. These alluvial deposits consist of <b>clay,</b> <b>loam,</b> silt etc. and are divided into the older alluvium and the newer alluvium. The older alluvium is called Bhangar and is present in the ground above the flood level of the rivers. Khaddar or newer alluvium is confined to the river channels and their flood plains. This region has some of the most fertile soil found in the country as new silt is continually laid down by the rivers every year.|$|E
5000|$|A {{wide variety}} of fish and other {{wildlife}} are known to occupy the region. The creek passes through rolling prairie that is surfaced by <b>clay</b> <b>loams</b> which support honey mesquite, wild orange, texana plum and natural grasses including [...] "Texas spur".|$|R
50|$|This grass {{grows on}} <b>loams,</b> {{including}} <b>clay</b> <b>loams,</b> and gravelly and sandy soil types. It usually grows in ecosystems {{dominated by the}} ponderosa pine. It may grow alongside blue grama and mountain muhly grasses. It is tolerant of shade and drought.|$|R
50|$|Calothamnus gibbosus {{occurs in}} the area between the Lort River and the Stirling Range and mostly at least 10 km from the coast in the Esperance Plains and Mallee biogeographic region. It grows on sandy <b>clay</b> <b>loams,</b> {{sometimes}} over gravel or laterite.|$|R
25|$|The base of Mount Hood {{consists}} of soils of the Goulding-Toomes-Guenoc association, which are well-drained gently to very steep loams and clay-loams situated upon upland formations. The upper reaches consist of the Kidd-Forward-Cohasset association, which group ranges from well-drained to excessively drained moderate to very steep gravelly and stony loams. Specific soil map patches {{on the upper}} slopes include Boomer loam on some 15 to 30 percent slopes; Goulding cobbly <b>clay</b> <b>loam</b> on 15 to 30 percent slopes; Henneke gravelly loam on some 5 to 30 percent slopes; Henneke gravelly loam on 30 to 75 percent slopes; and rock land on 15 to 75 percent slopes.|$|E
25|$|The {{peak and}} higher {{northern}} slope of Sonoma Mountain consists of soils of the Goulding cobbly loam association, which are five to fifteen percent in slope and may contain up to 20 percent of cobblestones at the near surface. Outcrops of basaltic rock are common among this soil type, betraying the volcanic origin of Sonoma Mountain. The upper western reaches of Sonoma Mountain have some {{amounts of the}} Raynor clay association, which group typically has a depth to bedrock of about four to five feet. Lower on the western exposures, along the Lichau Creek immediate drainage area, there is a broad occurrence of Goulding <b>clay</b> <b>loam</b> on slopes of about 15 to 25 percent.|$|E
25|$|The {{soil profile}} of the {{vineyard}} is very diverse across the collection of east, west and south-facing slopes. Throughout the vineyard {{is a mix of}} calcareous rocks, <b>clay,</b> <b>loam,</b> sand, sandstone and silt. The soils are very well draining and with the arid desert climate of the region that sees only around 6 inches of annual precipitation, irrigation is a must. Located on the far western edge of the Yakima Valley, Red Willow experiences generally warmer climate conditions than the greater Yakima Valley with growing degree day averaging 2796 units since 2003 in contrast to the 2169 GDD units averaged by Yakima Valley vineyards in the subappellation of the Rattlesnake Hills AVA.|$|E
5000|$|Capparis mitchellii {{can grow}} up to six metres in height with leaves between two and six {{centimetres}} in length. [...] The plant's flowers are large and coloured white or cream. It prefers sandy to <b>clay</b> <b>loams</b> but will grow on rocky hillsides.|$|R
50|$|Sugarcane {{is not a}} {{sensitive}} crop and can be grown in almost all types of soil, from sandy to <b>clay</b> <b>loams</b> and from acidic volcanic soils to calcareous sedimentary deposits. The harvest period is from October to December and ends in May.|$|R
50|$|At Bourne {{sections}} {{have shown}} highly weathered gravels overlain by sandy silts and <b>clay</b> <b>loams,</b> {{the highest levels}} in the sequenceshowing evidence of cryoturbation. Two phases of fan sediment deposition were separated by {{a long period of}} subaerial weathering, which may represent an interglacial period.|$|R
25|$|Barbera {{can adapt}} {{to a wide range}} of {{vineyard}} soils but tends to thrive most in less fertile calcareous soils and <b>clay</b> <b>loam.</b> Sandy soils can help limit the vigor and yields. The grape rarely thrives in very alkaline or saline soils. Like many grape varieties with a long history, the Barbera vine has seen mutation and clonal variation arise with different clones of the variety found in Piedmont, Lombardy, Emilia-Romagna and the Mezzogiorno. The different clones can be identified by the size and shape of their grape clusters with the smaller cluster clones producing the highest quality wine. In recent years, viticulturalists have been working with clonal selection to increase Barbera's resistance to the leafroll virus.|$|E
25|$|Overall, the Hunter Valley {{has more}} soils (mostly hard, acidic patches of poorly {{draining}} heavy clay) that are unsuitable for viticulture {{than they have}} areas that are ideal for growing grapes. The soils of the Lower Hunter vary widely from sandy alluvial flats (often planted to Semillon), to deep friable loam (often planted with Shiraz) and friable red duplex soils. In the Upper Hunter, the rivers and creeks of the region contribute to the areas black, silty loam soils that are often overlaid on top of alkaline <b>clay</b> <b>loam.</b> Among the hills of the Brokenback range are strips of volcanic basalt that are prized by growers for their tendencies to restrict vigor and concentrate mineral flavours in the grapes.|$|E
25|$|The {{steep slopes}} of Copeland Creek have a {{predominant}} occurrence of Goulding <b>clay</b> <b>loam</b> soils, with a typical soil depth of only 16to 20inches (41to 51centimeters). These are generally areas of 15to 45percent slopes that support dense mixed oak woodland, with large percentages of California laurel and Bigleaf maple. On the higher drier slopes, there are terraces of Raynor clay, which {{are associated with}} seeps and higher moisture retention known to the Turtle Pond and Cattail Marsh areas of the Preserve. Both soil types are known to support grazing when woodlands are cleared. In the late 19th century, the site was used for sheep and cattle grazing and the woodlands were cut for firewood, which was taken by wagonload down the mountain to Petaluma.|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} soil type on {{population}} densities of plant parasitic nematode species in 17 field blocks of four different soil types rotated to corn, soybeans, wheat, and forage mixtures was investigated during a generally droughty 5 -year period. High densities of Helicotylenchus pseudorobustus {{were found in}} dark silty <b>clay</b> <b>loams.</b> Highest densities of Tylenchorhynchus acutus were also {{in one of the}} dark-colored silty <b>clay</b> <b>loams.</b> Light-colored silt loams favored development of Paratylenchus projectus, which developed poorly in the darker soils. Comparable densities of Xiphinema americanum were found in all soils and on all crops, regardless of soil type. Tylenchorhynchus martini, although present, did not build up in any of the soils. Populations of Pratylenchus species were generally low in the rotated blocks of all soil types...|$|R
50|$|The Fortescue Catchment area drains {{from the}} {{southern}} side of the Chichester Plateau and the northern side of the Hamersley Range making use of the trough between the two. The valley plains are composed of earthy clays with some cracking <b>clays,</b> <b>loams</b> and hard red soils.|$|R
50|$|It {{has a wide}} distribution, {{occurring}} {{throughout the}} Avon Wheatbelt and Coolgardie biogeographic regions, with outliers as far west as Perth and {{as far south as}} Esperance. The relief is generally gentle slopes. It grows in a range of soils: red <b>loams,</b> red <b>clay</b> <b>loams,</b> yellow and red sand, and laterite.|$|R
25|$|The {{lowland area}} of Cavite is {{generally}} composed of Guadalupe clay and <b>clay</b> <b>loam.</b> It is characterized as coarse and granular when dry but sticky and plastic when wet. Its substratum is solid volcanic tuff. These types of soils are suited to lowland rice and corn while {{those in the}} upland are suited for orchard and pasture. Guadalupe clay adobes are abundant {{in the southern part}} of Bacoor and Imus bordering DasmariÃ±as. The soil is hard and compact and difficult to cultivate that makes it generally unsuitable for diverse cropping. It is very sticky when wet and granular when dry. Forage grass is advised for this type of soil. Hydrosol and Obando sand are found along Bacoor Bay. The shoreline of Rosario, Tanza, Naic and Ternate are lined with Guadalupe sand.|$|E
25|$|Like {{all crops}} and plants, Christmas trees require a {{specific}} set of nutrients to thrive. There are 16elements crucial for growth; of those, three are obtained through air and water: hydrogen, carbon, and oxygen. Nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, calcium, magnesium, sulfur, boron, copper, chlorine, manganese, molybdenum, iron, and zinc are obtained from the soil. If the necessary elements are not available in the local soil, nutritious fertilizers are used. Other important soil considerations include pH and drainage. Certain types of soil are preferable, {{depending on the type of}} tree. Pine trees are usually better adapted to a sandy or sandy loam soil, while white spruce trees and fir trees, such as the Douglas-fir, prefer fine-texture loams and <b>clay</b> <b>loam</b> soils. Some trees grow well in all types of soil, but in any case, the land must be well-drained for a Christmas tree farm to have a chance of thriving.|$|E
25|$|The type of soils that {{dominate}} the upland areas are Tagaytay loam and Tagaytay sandy loam with mountain soil undifferentiated found on the south-eastern side bordering Laguna province. Also on the southern tip are Magallanes clay and Mountain soil undifferentiated with interlacing of Magallanes <b>clay</b> <b>loam</b> steep phase. The Tagaytay loam contains fine sandy materials, moderately friable, and easy to work on when moist. In an undisturbed condition, it bakes and becomes hard when dry. About one-half of this soil type is devoted to upland rice and upland crops. On the other hand, Tagaytay sandy loam is friable and granular with considerable amount of volcanic sand and underlain by adobe clay. Mountain soil undifferentiated is forested with bamboos found in the sea coast. Cavite also has the Patungan sand characterized by pale gray to almost white sand with substratum of marine conglomerates which are found at Sta. Mercedes in Maragondon and in some coastlines of Ternate.|$|E
40|$|A {{survey was}} {{conducted}} over a 22 -year period to evaluate the influence of soil texture and land use on the geographical distributions of Rotylenchulus reniformis, Meloidogyne incognita, and Tylenchulus semipenetrans in the lower Rio Grande valley. The distributions of R. reniformis and M. incognita were related to soil texture, whereas T. semipenetrans occurred wherever host plants were present regardless of soil texture. The incidence of M. incognita was greatest in elevated sandy loams and moderately well-drained silts of modern flood terraces of the Rio Grande river. Rotylenchulus reniformis occurred predominantly in clay silts and clays of ancient flood terraces. <b>Clay</b> <b>loams</b> and sandy <b>clay</b> <b>loams</b> of the central, irrigated portion of the lower Rio Grande valley appeared favorable for M. incognita and R. reniformis. Differences between the geographical distributions of these two species could not be attributed to host crops...|$|R
50|$|The soil is <b>clay</b> and <b>loam,</b> over Coal Measures and stone.|$|R
50|$|The bedrock under Uplands is {{quartz diorite}} gneiss. Soils are well drained sandy loams of the Cadboro and Langford series (Cd-L or Lsl), or poorly drained sandy <b>clay</b> <b>loams</b> of the Tolmie series (Tscl); all have thick dark topsoils. In {{near-shore}} areas the soils are more stony and are mapped as Langford-Rough Stony complex(L-Rs).|$|R
