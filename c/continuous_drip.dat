50|$|In {{the first}} decades of the sixteenth century, the eastern Lario was close to the armies {{involved}} in the dispute between France and Spain. An adventurer, Gian Giacomo Medici, attempted to form a principality on Lake Como and a fleet take long in check the forces of Francesco II Sforza. Bellano was plundered and famine raged in every village. A duke died without heirs, and Milan went to the Spanish in 1535. There followed two centuries of gradual decay: the archives of Esino reveal misery, oppression, robberies and injustices. The only glimmer of light are the two pastoral visits of Charles Borromeo to Esino in 1565 and in 1582. The plague of 1630 claimed many victims in Valsassina; fifty in Esino. Along the rest of the century, then, was a <b>continuous</b> <b>drip</b> of starvation and hunger. In the second half of 1600, despite the ancient privileges, Valsassina became a feud chamber.|$|E

50|$|Altruism {{does not}} require {{self-sacrifice}} but sacrifice, such as time or energy, is shown to be of greater significance. Second, water {{can be said to}} be modest since naturally water always goes to the lowest position. Instead of competing for a high position, water is yielding moving to a position below others. Again, one can learn from water to be humble and modest. Third, water can be described as adaptable and flexible as it matches the shape of any container. Water can not be broken and is able to adjust to pressure and work around it. The lesson, according to Lee, is to be flexible and adaptable to different people in different situations. Fourth, water can be very clear and transparent. Being clear shows others that you are trustworthy, as you have nothing to hide. Gentle and persistent force will complete the task overtime, rather than forcing a task and creating more problems. In other words, human beings should be honest and transparent with others. Finally, water can be very soft and gentle (making it difficult to catch) but also strong and persistent (even the hardest rock will yield to <b>continuous</b> <b>drips</b> of water).|$|R

Patients were random-ized to supportive care alone (n= 15, control group) or to supportive care in addition to L-NAME (1 mg/Kg bolus and 1 mg/Kg/h <b>continuous</b> IV <b>drip</b> for 5 h n= 15). Death at one month was 27 % in the L-NAME group vs. 67 % in the control group (p= 0. 008).

To explore tools that assist the monitoring of sedation levels of those receiving sedation holidays. Data sources: A review of the current literature utilizing search engines from CINAHL, Proquest, and professional nursing journal websites referencing sedation holidays (also known as sedation stops, daily interruptions and sedation holds). Literature, both supporting and controversial to, sedation holidays, along with common complications of patients on ventilators is explored. Tools for assessing patients' level of sedation during continuous infusion of sedation agents are also evaluated. Conclusions: Some studies have shown preference for bolus medications, instead of <b>continuous</b> <b>drip</b> medication to prevent over-sedation. A sedation holiday is the practice of turning off continuous sedation once every 24 -hour period (or once a day). This allows for a more accurate nursing assessment of the patient's neurological and respiratory status.
