5|$|On 29 January 1945, Saratoga {{departed}} Pearl Harbor for Ulithi Atoll to {{rendezvous with}} the Enterprise {{and form a}} night fighter task group (TG 58.5/Night Carrier Division 7) along with Enterprise, to provide air cover for the amphibious landings on Iwo Jima. She arrived on 8 February with the 53 Hellcats and 17 Avengers of <b>Carrier</b> <b>Air</b> <b>Group</b> (Night) 53 aboard and sailed two days later.|$|E
5|$|BAe test pilots {{cleared the}} {{aircraft}} carrier ' for Harrier operations in July 1989. The carrier, which replaced the World War II-era , has a 12° ski-jump ramp. It was originally planned that the first unit to operate the aircraft would be the 8a Escuadrilla. This unit was disbanded on 24 October 1986, following the sales of AV-8S Matadors to Thailand. Instead, 9a Escuadrilla was formed on 29 September 1987, {{to become part of}} the Alpha <b>Carrier</b> <b>Air</b> <b>Group</b> and operate the EAV-8B.|$|E
5|$|<b>Carrier</b> <b>Air</b> <b>Group</b> 8 (CVG-8) was {{established}} on 15 September 1948 {{in response to}} the Berlin Blockade with newly qualified pilots and reservists who volunteered for active duty. VA-84 and VA-85, the air group's attack squadrons, began receiving Maulers in November and the last aircraft was delivered in January 1949. Later that month the air group made a flyover of President Harry Truman's Inauguration ceremony. The squadron conducted their qualifications aboard the Midway from 3 to 6 May with ten Maulers crashing into the safety barrier between them. CVG-8 made a two-week cruise aboard the Midway beginning on 27 June along the East Coast of the United States, before it was disbanded in November after the peaceful resolution of the Berlin Blockade.|$|E
50|$|From 1958 to 1971 the Navy {{organized}} the Fleet Replacement Squadrons for Carrier Based aircraft into Readiness <b>Carrier</b> <b>Air</b> <b>Groups</b> (RCVG) and Readiness <b>Carrier</b> <b>Air</b> Anti-Submarine <b>Groups</b> (RCVSG). On 20 December 1963 when all <b>Carrier</b> <b>Air</b> <b>Groups</b> were redesignated <b>Carrier</b> <b>Air</b> Wings (CVW) the RCVGs were redesignated Readiness <b>Carrier</b> <b>Air</b> Wings (RCVW), the RCVSGs however were not redesignated and they remained Readiness <b>Carrier</b> <b>Air</b> Anti-Submarine <b>Groups</b> {{until they were}} disestablished in 1970 and 1971. After disestablishment of the RCVWs and RCVSGs the Fleet Replacement Squadrons were placed under the operational control of the aircraft specific type or functional wings but they all retained their former RCVW or RCVSG tail codes.|$|R

5|$|Implacable {{arrived at}} the BPF's main {{operating}} base at Manus Island, in the Admiralty Islands, on 29 May. A week later Rear Admiral Sir Patrick Brind hoisted his flag in preparation for Operation Inmate, {{an attack on the}} Japanese naval base at Truk in the Caroline Islands that began on 14 June. Having flown 113 offensive sorties over the two days of the attack, with only one loss of a Seafire to enemy action, the carrier and her escorts returned to Manus Island on 17 June. On 30 June No. 8 <b>Carrier</b> <b>Air</b> <b>Group</b> was formed, absorbing No. 24 Naval Fighter Wing, to control all of the air units aboard Implacable.|$|E
5|$|Returning from trials on 27 September, {{the carrier}} {{embarked}} <b>Carrier</b> <b>Air</b> <b>Group</b> 20, which flew two squadrons of Grumman F8F Bearcat fighter aircraft {{as well as}} a squadron each of Curtiss SB2C Helldiver dive bombers and Grumman TBM-3E Avenger torpedo bombers, about 90 aircraft total. She left port 30 September and commenced training en route to Norfolk, Virginia. CVG-20 Commander Robert M. Milner made the first takeoff from the carrier on 1 October aboard a Bearcat. Philippine Sea departed Norfolk Naval Shipyard 12 October for Cuban waters where she conducted an abbreviated shakedown cruise and training exercises for CVG-20's Grumman F8F Bearcats and Curtiss SB2C Helldivers until 20 November.|$|E
5|$|For {{the rest}} of 1950 and early 1951, she {{launched}} numerous attacks against Chinese forces around the 38th Parallel hoping to slow their advance as UN troops retreated. With only brief stops for repair and rest, the carrier continued numerous sorties against Chinese targets. On 25 February, command of Task Force 77 was transferred to Valley Forge. During this time, the cold weather hampered operations and blizzards occasionally shut them down completely. Putting into Yokosuka Naval Base, Japan, in late March 1951 for repair and refit, Philippine Sea exchanged Air Group 11 for <b>Carrier</b> <b>Air</b> <b>Group</b> 2 from Valley Forge, a group which consisted mostly of Vought F4U Corsair fighter-bombers. The same date as the transfer on 28 March, Philippine Sea became flagship of Vice Admiral H. M. Martin, {{the commander of the}} 7th Fleet.|$|E

5|$|Philippine Sea {{completed}} her first deployment to Korea {{and arrived at}} San Francisco on 9 June 1951. It conducted refits, repairs and patrol operations along the West Coast continued {{for the remainder of}} the year. On 19 December, she was the site of a test for an emergency nuclear weapon assembly, the first such test involving a nuclear weapon aboard a US Navy ship. The ship departed from San Diego on 31 December 1951. Arriving at Pearl Harbor on 8 January 1952, Philippine Sea continued on to Yokosuka for a second deployment to Korea, arriving 20 January 1952 with <b>Carrier</b> <b>Air</b> <b>Group</b> 11, which flew five squadrons of the F4U Corsair, about 100 aircraft. During this tour, the front lines in Korea had largely stabilized, and instead the ship directed its aircraft against strategic targets, including the 23 June attack on the Sui-ho Dam in conjunction with Boxer, Princeton, and , and sending aircraft against targets in Pyongyang.|$|E
5|$|Ramage {{reported}} to the Enterprise in Noumea in February 1943. After qualifying to land on a carrier in Noumea in April 1943, {{he was assigned to}} Bombing Squadron Ten (VB-10), one of the carrier's two dive bomber squadrons flying the Douglas SBD Dauntless as its executive officer. Shortly afterwards, the Enterprise returned to Pearl Harbor for overhaul, and Ramage returned to the United States with his wife. The squadrons of <b>Carrier</b> <b>Air</b> <b>Group</b> 10, of which VB-10 was a part, were reequipped with new aircraft, with VB-10 receiving new SBD-5s to replace its older SBD-3 models. Air Group 10 returned to Hawaii in November 1943, and the whole group qualified for night operation, making two night landings on the Enterprise in January 1944. Ramage saw his first combat in the Battle of Kwajalein in January 1944, and participated in the attack on Truk in February and landings at Hollandia in April. He became commander of VB-10 in March.|$|E
5|$|She {{returned}} to San Francisco on 10 September 1946, embarked <b>Carrier</b> <b>Air</b> <b>Group</b> 19 flying the Grumman F8F Bearcat fighter. With this complement, Boxer {{began a series}} of peacetime patrols and training missions off the coast of California during a relatively uneventful period during 1947. In spite of manning difficulties brought on by the demobilization of the US military after World War II, Boxer remained active in Pacific readiness drills around the West Coast and Hawaii. In 1948, she conducted a number of short cruises with US Navy Reserve personnel. On 10 March 1948, a North American FJ-1 Fury launched from Boxer, the first such launch of an all-jet aircraft from an American carrier, which allowed subsequent tests of jet aircraft carrier doctrine. For the remainder of 1948 and 1949, she participated in numerous battle drills and acted as a training carrier for jet aircraft pilots.|$|E
50|$|On 15 November 1946, {{to correct}} the results of demobilization which had left {{squadron}} numbers all out of sequence, sweeping changes were made in <b>air</b> unit designations. <b>Carrier</b> <b>Air</b> <b>Groups</b> of four types were designated according to their assigned ship, as CVBG for Battle Carrier, CVG for Attack Carrier, CVLG for Light Carrier and CVEG for Escort Carrier. Two years later, on 1 September 1948, all <b>carrier</b> <b>air</b> <b>groups</b> became CVG regardless of their carrier affiliation.|$|R

5|$|In late March, {{the carrier}} {{embarked}} <b>Carrier</b> <b>Air</b> <b>Group</b> 9, which flew two squadrons of Gruman F8F Bearcats and Grumman F6F Hellcat fighters {{as well as}} a squadron each of SB2C Helldivers and TBM Avengers, and a detachment of HO3S helicopters for a total of about 100 aircraft. She completed her shakedown cruise at Guantanamo Bay until late May. She continued sea trials in the area until 1 July when she arrived at Gravesend Bay, New Jersey for refit. She was refitted for most of the year at New York Naval Shipyard and Bayonne, New Jersey through 15 November 1947 before conducting trials and training around Quonset and Guantanamo Bay through February 1948. That month, she became flagship of Carrier Division Four led by Rear Admiral Ralph E. Jennings, who established his command aboard her on 4 February. On 20 February she departed for her first deployment in the Mediterranean Sea as part of Vice Admiral Forrest Sherman's 6th Fleet. Here she logged 8,534 flight hours, including 85 hours of night operations. She returned to Quonset 26 June and for repairs to her catapult machinery. She spent the remainder of the year {{as a part of the}} Operational Development Force testing new carrier aircraft doctrine, and her pilots logged 750 hours in 670 carrier controlled approach tests and 314 successful landings. On 22 October she was sent to the North Atlantic to conduct cold-weather landing tests and tested problem landing scenarios along the Arctic Circle until 23 November 1948.|$|E
