The ability to successfully perform long-distance migrations can probably only be fully explained with an accounting for the <b>cognitive</b> <b>ability</b> of the birds to recognize habitats and form mental maps. Satellite tracking of day migrating raptors such as ospreys and honey buzzards has shown that older individuals are better at making corrections for wind drift.|$|E
5|$|The <b>cognitive</b> <b>ability</b> of {{children}} with AS often allows them to articulate social norms in a laboratory context, where {{they may be able}} to show a theoretical understanding of other people's emotions; however, they typically have difficulty acting on this knowledge in fluid, real-life situations. People with AS may analyze and distill their observations of social interaction into rigid behavioral guidelines, and apply these rules in awkward ways, such as forced eye contact, resulting in a demeanor that appears rigid or socially naive. Childhood desire for companionship can become numbed through a history of failed social encounters.|$|E
5|$|Children {{under five}} years old display the least {{effective}} strategies for delaying gratification, such as looking at the reward and thinking about its arousing features. By 5 years old, most children are able to demonstrate better self-control by recognizing the counter-productivity of focusing on the reward. Five-year-olds often choose instead to actively distract themselves or even use self-instructions to remind themselves of the contingency that waiting produces a reward of a greater value. Between 8 and 13 years old, children develop the <b>cognitive</b> <b>ability</b> to differentiate and employ abstract versus arousing thoughts in order to distract their minds from the reward and thereby increase the delay. Once delaying strategies are developed, the capacity to resist temptation is relatively stable throughout adulthood. Preschoolers' performance on delayed gratification tasks correlates with their adolescent performance on tasks designed to measure similar constructs and processing, which parallels the corresponding development of willpower and the fronto-striatal circuit (neural pathways that connect the frontal lobe to other brain regions). Declines in self-regulation and impulse control in old age predict corresponding declines in reward-delaying strategies, specifically reduced temporal discounting due to a decrease in cooling strategies.|$|E

40|$|Levels of four <b>cognitive</b> <b>abilities</b> were {{measured}} in academic librarians and students. It {{was found that}} librarians had higher average logical and verbal comprehension abilities than students, and that students had higher average perceptual speed than librarians. Because these <b>cognitive</b> <b>abilities</b> affect infor-mation retrieval performance, {{these findings suggest that}} different approaches to information retrieval may be appropriate for librarians and students. ntelligence or mental ability is a complex combination of fac-tors called <b>cognitive</b> <b>abilities.</b> Ex-amples of <b>cognitive</b> <b>abilities</b> are the ability to reason, remember, understand language, and locate and understand mate-rial that is presented visually. These cogni-tive abilities have been investigated {{in a wide variety of}} research studies. For in-stance, management research has shown that <b>cognitive</b> <b>abilities</b> are important in-dicators of how well people will perform in certain jobs. library research has demon-strated that people with higher levels of cer-tain <b>cognitive</b> <b>abilities</b> use information retrieval systems more effectively. In sepa-rate investigations, the authors assessed the influence of four <b>cognitive</b> <b>abilities</b> on how well academic librarians are suited to their jobs and how well academic library pa-trons perform in end-user searching. 1 Sub-sequently, the authors compared the <b>cognitive</b> <b>abilities</b> of librarians and their patrons.

5|$|On August 10, 2001, on remand {{from the}} Florida Second District Court of Appeal, Judge Greer heard a motion from the Schindlers {{claiming}} that new medical treatment could restore sufficient <b>cognitive</b> <b>ability</b> such that Terri Schiavo herself {{would be able}} to decide to continue life-prolonging measures. The court also heard motions from the Schindlers to remove the guardian (Michael Schiavo) and to require Judge Greer to recuse himself. Judge Greer denied the motions and the Schindlers appealed to the Second District Court of Appeals. On October 17, 2001 the Court of Appeal affirmed the denials of the motions to remove and recuse. The Court of Appeals acknowledged that their opinion misled the trial court, and they remanded the question of Terri Schiavo's wishes back to the trial court and required an evidentiary hearing to be held. The court specified that five board certified neurologists were to testify. The Schindlers were allowed to choose two doctors to present findings at an evidentiary hearing while Michael Schiavo could introduce two rebuttal experts. Finally, the trial court itself would appoint a new independent physician to examine and evaluate Terri Schiavo's condition. (These decisions, all published in a single order by the Florida Second District Court of Appeal, came to be known by the court as Schiavo III in its later rulings.) In October 2002, on remand by the Second District Court of Appeal, an evidentiary hearing was held in Judge Greer's court to determine whether new therapy treatments could help Terri Schiavo restore any cognitive function. In preparation for the trial, a new computed axial tomography scan (CAT scan) was performed, which showed severe cerebral atrophy. An EEG showed no measurable brain activity. The five physicians chosen were Dr. William Maxfield, a radiologist, and four neurologists: Dr. William Hammesfahr, Dr. Ronald Cranford, Dr. Melvin Greer and Dr. Peter Bambakidis.|$|E

40|$|Aims and objectives. To {{examine the}} psychometric {{properties}} of the Nurses' Observation Scale for <b>Cognitive</b> <b>Abilities.</b> Background. Nurses' Observation Scale for <b>Cognitive</b> <b>Abilities</b> is a behavioural rating scale comprising eight subscales that represent different cognitive domains. It is based on observations during contact between nurse and patient. Design. Observational study. Methods. A total of 50 patients from two geriatric wards in acute care hospitals participated in this study. Reliability was examined via internal consistency and inter-rater reliability. Construct validity of the Nurses' Observation Scale for <b>Cognitive</b> <b>Abilities</b> and its subscales were explored by means of convergent and divergent validity and post hoc analyses for group differences. Results. Cronbach's alpha s of the total Nurses' Observation Scale for <b>Cognitive</b> <b>Abilities</b> and its subscales were 0. 98 and 0. 66 - 0. 93, respectively. The item-total correlations were satisfactory (overall > 0. 4). The intra-class coefficients were good (37 of 39 items > 0. 4). The convergent validity of the Nurses' Observation Scale for <b>Cognitive</b> <b>Abilities</b> against <b>cognitive</b> ratings (MMSE, NOSGER) and severity of dementia (Clinical Dementia Rating) demonstrated satisfactory correlations (0. 59 - 0. 70, p 0. 05). The divergent validity of the Nurses' Observation Scale for <b>Cognitive</b> <b>Abilities</b> against depressive symptoms was low (0. 12, p > 0. 05). The construct validity of the Nurses' Observation Scale for <b>Cognitive</b> <b>Abilities</b> subscales against 13 specific neuropsychological tests showed correlations varying from poor to fair (0. 18 - 0. 74; 10 of 13 correlations p < 0. 05). Conclusions. Validity and reliability of the total Nurses' Observation Scale for <b>Cognitive</b> <b>Abilities</b> are excellent. The correlations between the Nurses' Observation Scale for <b>Cognitive</b> <b>Abilities</b> subscales and standard neuropsychological tests were moderate. More conclusive results may be found if the Nurses' Observation Scale for <b>Cognitive</b> <b>Abilities</b> subscales were to be validated using more ecologically valid tests and in a patient population with less cognitive impairment. Relevance to clinical practice. Use of the Nurses' Observation Scale for <b>Cognitive</b> <b>Abilities</b> yields standardised, reliable and valid information about patient's cognitive behaviour in daily practice. The Nurses' Observation Scale for <b>Cognitive</b> <b>Abilities</b> aids in tailoring nursing interventions to patients' specific cognitive needs. We advocate the implementation of the Nurses' Observation Scale for <b>Cognitive</b> <b>Abilities</b> both in research and at geriatric units in acute care hospitals...|$|R
