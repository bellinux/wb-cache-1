To achieve this improvement, a two-layer system is used, consisting of a metallic, vacuum-plasma-sprayed NiCoCrAlY bond coat for oxidation protection and a ceramic 7 - 8 wt%-Y_ 2 O_ 3 ZrO_ 2 thermal barrier coating produced by atmospheric plasma spraying and serving as a heat shield. The studies described in this thesis concern, on the one hand, the production of coating using the F 4 plasma torch with an established history in the industry as well as the new triplex torch technology. Parameter variations and parameter studies for the bond coats were carried out exclusively with the F 4 torch. The top coat studies were performed with both the F 4 and triplex torches. For characterization, on the other hand, extensive studies were carried out using mercury analysis, image analysis, microindenter Young's modulus and hardness measurement, thermal cycling, Raman microscopy, roughness measurements, dilatometry, SEM and optical microscopy. The factor test scheme presented here is a procedure which unambiguously defines the spraying distance as the most important factor influencing porosity and spray efficiency with the triplex torch. For both torches, increasing wear (in particular of the <b>cathods)</b> is detected on the basis of different layer porosities. The triplex torch was subjected to much stronger wear than the F 4 torch.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{utilization}} of bioelectrochemical systems for methane production has attracted increasing attention, but producing methane in these systems requires additional voltage to overcome large cathode overpotentials. To {{eliminate the need}} for electrical grid energy, we constructed a microbial reverse-electrodialysis methanogenesis cell (MRMC) by placing a reverse electrodialysis (RED) stack between an anode with exoelectrogenic microorganisms and a methanogenic biocathode. In the MRMC, renewable salinity gradient energy was converted to electrical energy, thus providing the added potential needed for methane evolution from the cathode. The feasibility of the MRMC was examined using three different cathode materials (stainless steel mesh coated with platinum, SS/Pt; carbon cloth coated with carbon black, CC/CB; or a plain graphite fiber brush, GFB) and a thermolytic solution (ammonium bicarbonate) in the RED stack.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Li 2 S is a {{high-capacity}} {{cathode material}} for lithium metal-free rechargeable batteries. It has a theoretical capacity of 1166 mAh/g, which is nearly 1 {{order of magnitude}} higher than traditional metal oxides/phosphates cathodes. However, Li 2 S is usually considered to be electrochemically inactive due to its high electronic resistivity and low lithium-ion diffusivity. In this paper, we discover that a large potential barrier (∼ 1 V) exists {{at the beginning of}} charging for Li 2 S. By applying a higher voltage cutoff, this barrier can be overcome and Li 2 S becomes active. Moreover, this barrier does not appear again in the following cycling. Subsequent cycling shows that the material behaves similar to common sulfur cathodes with high energy efficiency. The initial discharge capacity is greater than 800 mAh/g for even 10 μm Li 2 S particles. Moreover, after 10 cycles, the capacity is stabilized around 500 − 550 mAh/g with a capacity decay rate of only ∼ 0. 25 % per cycle. The origin of the initial barrier is found to be the phase nucleation of polysulfides, but the amplitude of barrier is mainly due to two factors: (a) charge transfer directly between Li 2 S and electrolyte without polysulfide and (b) lithium-ion diffusion in Li 2 S. These results demonstrate a simple and scalable approach to utilizing Li 2 S as the <b>cathod...</b>|$|E

The following article appeared in (citation of published article) and may be found at [URL] with cylindrical hollow cathode have been studied by means of two-dimensional particle-in-cell/Monte-Carlo collision (PIC/MCC) simulations. For a given input power, the onset of field emission from the cathode surface caused by the strong electric field generated in these discharges leads to a reduction of the discharge voltage {{and an increase in}} plasma density. The plasma density profile can be strongly influenced by localized enhancements of the electric field, which in turn will affect the erosion profile of the cathode.

Charge-discharge tests of the graphite/PHT (10. 00 mg graphite, 1. 10 mg PHT) indicated a specific capacity of 312 mAh g ' for the deintercalation of Lit. By subtracting the capacity involved in the redox reaction of PHT from {{the capacity of the}} graphite/PHT, the uti-lization of graphite was determined to be 0. 92, which implies that the chemical formula of C 652 Li, was obtained. This result is in accordance with that obtained for an electrode prepared by using poly(vinylidenefluoride) as a binder (graphite/PVDF). The irreversible capacity which appeared during the first cycle of the charge-discharge test of the graphite was apparently reduced by the use of PHT as the binder in place of PVDF, the degree being greater with an increase in the amount of PHT in the electrode.

During the tetrazolium procedure for staining of electrophoreticaly separated serum malic or lactic dehydrogenese isozymes on agargel, without substrate and co-enzyme, two peaks were noticed and named serum "non-specific factor". These peaks were considered a kind of non specific reactions which resulted from a reduction of the tetrazolium salt electrostaticaly adsorbed on Alb. ～ α(1), Glb. by SH-groups of these serum proteins. These reactions were accelerated by the elavation of PH or the temperature, exposure during staining and the prolonged staining time, {{as well as the}} rise of concentrations of NTB, PMS and CN- in the staining medium.

The highest degradation rate is observed under open circuit conditions and is related to formation of a SrCrO 4 layer {{on the surface of}} an LSCF cathode. This results in an increase in both polarization and ohmic electrode resistance. The degradation rate is 3. 7 and 0. 5 Ohm cm 2 / 1000 h, accordingly. When external polarization is applied, the degradation rate decreases considerably. It is found that the amount of chromium in the cathode bulk changes nonlinearly at an increase in current density. At 0. 2 A/cm 2, the overall amount of chromium is twice as large as under open circuit conditions, but the degradation rate is three times lower. Herewith, a considerable amount of chromium was found both on the cathode surface and in its bulk. The results of model experiments show that exposure to external electric current leads to migration of chromium cations in the bulk of the porous cathode. It is shown that the growth of a SrCrO 4 layer on the surface of an LSCF cathode and penetration of chromium into the cathode bulk becomes slower at the current density of 0. 5 A/cm 2.

When the liquid water produced at the cathode is improperly removed, PEFCs experience unstable operation and power loss. Current techniques for cathode water removal result in excessive parasitic loads on the PEFC that contribute to high system costs. This thesis explores {{ways to improve the}} efficiency of PEFC cathode water management by developing a fundamental understanding of the dynamical stability of two-phase air and water ow in parallel cathode microchannels through experiments, analysis, and modeling. The dynamics of an experimental PEFC under varying degrees of cathode water removal were characterized by nonlinear invariants indicative of dynamical complexity and stability, the correlation dimension and Kolmogorov entropy. It was found that low-current operating conditionsm suffer from chaotic instability and performance loss due to cathode flooding. In order to detect and control dynamical instability in real time, a computationally-efficient reduced order Lyapunov exponent was formulated to indicate stability related to cathode water content. A stabilizing control algorithm was developed using feedback from real-time computation of the reduced order Lyapunov exponent of the PEFC voltage to trigger lowcost cathode pressure pulses. The control was demonstrated to stabilize flooding conditions with minimal parasitic expense for water removal. Two-phase air-water ow structures were visualized and pressure drops were measured in ex-situ microchannels under varying levels of transience. The pressure drops and their fluctuations were characterized with average values and fractal statistics, respectively, across air and water ow rates and ow regimes of relevance in PEFC operation. Dynamic pressure drop hysteresis was observed and measured, most likely for the first time. The statistical experimental results were used to develop a dynamical model of a PEFC cathode flow field with two-phase ow in parallel microchannels. The model included experimental values for two-phase pressure drops, a 1 D + 1 PEFC model for water generation, and fractional Brownian motion for two-phase pressure uctuations. The model was used to understand ow maldistribution and Ledinegg instability in PEFC <b>cathod</b> flow fields, and to highlight methods for optimizing PEFC water management...|$|E
40|$|After {{the recent}} upsurge of {{interest}} in the layered LiNi 1 / 3 Co 1 / 3 Mn 1 / 3 O 2 system for use as a cathode material for rechargeable lithium batteries, we have studied the charge compensation mechanism and structural perturbations occurring during cycling of the novel layered system of Li 1. 05 Ni 0. 35 Co 0. 25 Mn 0. 4 O 2 coated with nano-crystallized LiCoO 2, which effectively improved the rate capability. In addition, the LiCoO 2 evidently suppressed any structural change of the Li 1. 05 Ni 0. 35 Co 0. 25 Mn 0. 4 O 2. In situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy �XAS � measurements were performed utilizing a novel in situ electrochemical cell, specifically designed for long-term X-ray experiments. The cell was cycled at a moderate rate through a typical Li-ion battery operating voltage range � 2. 8 – 4. 8 V�. The electrode contained 1. 9 mg of Li 1. 05 Ni 0. 35 Co 0. 25 Mn 0. 4 O 2 ona 25 �m Al foil, and had an area of 0. 79 cm 2. XAS measurements were performed at different states of charge �SOC � during cycling, at the Ni, Co, and the Mn edges, revealing details about the response of the cathode to Li insertion and extraction processes. Extended X-ray absorption fine structure region of the spectra revealed the changes of bond distance and coordination number of Ni, Co, and Mn absorbers {{as a function of the}} SOC of the material. We found that the oxidation states of the transition metals in the system are Ni 2 +,Co 3 +, and Mn 4 + in the fully discharged condition. During charging the Ni 2 + is oxidized to Ni 4 + through an intermediate stage of Ni 3 +,Co 3 + is oxidized almost to Co 4 +. Utilizing a combination of Faraday’s calculation and XAS results, the Co was found to be at Co 3. 89 + at the end of the charge, whereas Mn was found to be electrochemically inactive and remains as Mn 4 +.

40|$|In this study, we {{engineer}} and investigate the interface structure and chemistry at the {{indium tin oxide}} ITO anode front side electrode {{as well as at}} the Mg Ag cathode back side electrode in metal phthalocyanine MePc C 60 organic solar cells OSCs. For the front side electrode, Zn Phthalocyaninetetraphosphonic acid Zn PTPA and Sn phthalocyanine axially substituted with tartaric acid Sn PTA have been used for the surface termination of ITO coated glass substrates. Both terminations yielded OSCs with higher fill factors and open circuit voltages increasing thus the power conversion efficiency by 33 and 67, respectively. A possible influence of a chemisorbed Zn PTPA on the film growth of the adjacent ZnPc absorber in the vicinity of the hybrid interface is discussed using x ray reflectivity and near edge x ray absorption fine structure data. Distinct effects of the Zn PTPA and Sn PTA terminations on the electronic properties of the ITO surface were found by x ray photoelectron spectroscopy XPS measurements at the valence band edge. We demonstrate the possibility to engineer the hybrid interface without additional buffer. For the back side electrode we report on the formation of buffer free charge carrier selective Mg Ag cathodes, which are applied for bulk heterojunction organic absorbers consisting of copper phthalocyanine CuPc donor and fullerene C 60 acceptor materials. The chemical and structural properties of the CuPc C 60 Mg Ag interface is investigated by element depth profiling using secondary ion mass spectrometry SIMS, grazing incidence x ray diffraction analysis GI XRD and XPS. We demonstrate that an optimum charge carrier selectivity is achieved with Mg Ag Ag cathode structures, where the Mg Ag alloy layer has a composition close to that of Ag 3 Mg. In addition, Mg diffusion into CuPc C 60 layer is observed. As a result, an interaction between Mg and Cu 2 with a concurrent change of oxidation state of both metals takes place. However, no formation of MgPc is observed. The findings of this work are discussed against the background of the performance and electrical properties of corresponding MePc C 60 based organic solar cells.
