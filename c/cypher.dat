5|$|Traditionally, {{breakers}} dance {{within a}} <b>cypher</b> or an Apache Line. A <b>cypher</b> is a circular shaped dance space formed by spectators that breakers use to perform or battle in. Cyphers {{work well for}} one-on-one b-boy or b-girl (break-boy/break-girl) battles; however, Apache Lines are more appropriate when the battle is between two crews—teams of street dancers. In contrast to the circular shape of a <b>cypher,</b> competing crews can face each other in this line formation, challenge each other, and execute their burns (a move intended to humiliate the opponent, i.e. crotch grabbing).|$|E

There, at the gulf and its surrounding area, there were many jungles and such in an irradiated area. The jungles flooding the <b>Cyphers</b> base and made a bio-organic shell of life as the base of the <b>Cyphers.</b>|$|R

50|$|Like in 2013, Red Bull BC One held <b>Cyphers,</b> Regional Finals {{as well as}} the World Final. Winners {{of country}} <b>Cyphers</b> got the chance to compete in one of six global qualifiers in an attempt to reach the World Final.

5|$|During the Second World War, Turing {{worked for}} the Government Code and <b>Cypher</b> School (GC) at Bletchley Park, Britain's codebreaking centre that {{produced}} Ultra intelligence. For a time he led Hut 8, the section which was responsible for German naval cryptanalysis. Here he devised a number of techniques for speeding the breaking of German ciphers, including improvements to the pre-war Polish bombe method, an electromechanical machine that could find settings for the Enigma machine. Turing {{played a pivotal role}} in cracking intercepted coded messages that enabled the Allies to defeat the Nazis in many crucial engagements, including the Battle of the Atlantic, and in so doing helped win the war.|$|E
5|$|Her {{interest}} in {{education has been}} one of her most obvious surviving charitable legacies. She founded schools in all the villages surrounding the Roseberys' estates. The Mentmore estate alone was serviced by three schools founded by her at Wingrave, Cheddington and Mentmore itself. Not only were the children educated at her expense by trained teachers, each was also provided with seasonal gifts of new clothes. Cheddington School remains in its original building with her <b>cypher</b> on its walls, while Wingrave School, which opened in 1877, survives in new premises.|$|E
5|$|The Irish overprinted stamps came, as {{supplied}} from the printers in London, with a watermark of the Royal <b>Cypher</b> of George V. The first Irish watermark was a stylised {{design of the}} two overlapping letters 's' and 'e' making an 'se' watermark representing {{the name of the}} country Saorstát Éireann. This watermark was discontinued around 1940 when the country's name changed to Éire (Ireland); it was replaced with e watermark paper to represent Éire. Stamps of the period may have the watermark in any of several states of inversion and rotation attributable to the way the paper was fed into the printing machines.|$|E

5|$|The Italian Constitution {{does not}} make {{provision}} for a Vice-President. However, separate insignia for the President of the Senate, in exercise of duties as acting head of state under Article 86, was created in 1986. This has a white square on the blue field, charged with {{the arms of the}} Republic in silver. Distinguishing insignia for former Presidents of the Republic was created in 2001; a tricolour {{in the style of the}} Presidential standard, it is emblazoned with the <b>Cypher</b> of Honour of the President of the Republic.|$|E
5|$|The Maundy Dish {{is one of}} six used by the Queen at Royal Maundy for {{handing out}} alms to elderly people in {{recognition}} of their service {{to the church and}} local community. The ceremony, which takes place in a different cathedral every year, entirely replaced the ancient custom of washing the feet of the poor in 1730, and the dish, though it bears the royal <b>cypher</b> of William and Mary, dates from the reign of CharlesII. Two purses containing specially minted coins are taken from the dish and presented to each recipient.|$|E
5|$|The {{arms are}} used as a mark of {{authority}} by various government agencies and representatives, including the Prime Minister and Cabinet, the Speaker of the House of Commons, most courts (including the Supreme Court), and, formerly, Parliament, and {{on the cover of}} Canadian passports. Since 1962, a banner of the arms, defaced with a variant of the Queen's <b>cypher,</b> has formed the Royal Standard of Canada, for use by the Canadian sovereign. The personal flag of the Governor General has featured the crest of the arms of Canada on a blue background since 1981.|$|E

50|$|In the 1920s an {{intercept}} station {{would take}} 300 signals a month. In late 1934, the Pillau station collected nearly 1000 Polish and Russian signals. Between 1929 and 1932 the larger Main Intercept Station South received around 100 signals a day, by 1939 this had increased to 1000. In 1937, the 14 intercept stations intercepted 252000 intercepts. By 1938, this had increased by 42000 signals to 290,000. During this time, B-Dienst {{were working on}} seven British <b>cyphers,</b> five French <b>cyphers,</b> four Soviet and three Danish <b>cypher's.</b> By 1939, around 308,000 signals were being intercepted per day.|$|R

5|$|It {{was in the}} Kabaty Woods, at Pyry, on 25 and 26 July 1939 {{with war}} looming that, on {{instructions}} from the Polish General Staff, the Cipher Bureau's chiefs, Lt. Col. Gwido Langer and Major Maksymilian Ciężki, the three civilian mathematician-cryptologists, and Col. Stefan Mayer, chief of intelligence, revealed Poland's achievements to cryptanalytical representatives of France and Britain, explaining how they had broken Enigma. They undertook to give each country a Polish-reconstructed Enigma, along with details of their equipment, including Zygalski sheets and Rejewski's cryptologic bomb. In return, the British pledged to prepare two full sets of Zygalski sheets for all 60 possible wheel orders. The French contingent consisted of Major Gustave Bertrand, the French radio-intelligence and cryptology chief, and Capt. Henri Braquenié of the French Air Force staff. The British sent Commander Alastair Denniston, head of Britain's Government Code and <b>Cypher</b> School, Dilly Knox, chief British cryptanalyst and Commander Humphrey Sandwith, head of the Royal Navy's intercept and direction-finding stations.|$|E
5|$|On 5 September 1945, Igor Gouzenko, a <b>cypher</b> {{clerk at}} the Soviet Union's embassy in Ottawa, and his family {{defected}} to Canada. He brought with him copies of cables detailing Soviet intelligence (GRU) espionage activities in Canada. Agents included Alan Nunn May, who secretly supplied tiny samples of uranium-233 and uranium-235 to GRU agent Pavel Angelov in July 1945; Fred Rose, a member of parliament; and NRC scientists Israel Halperin, Edward Mazerall and Durnford Smith. Pontecorvo, who defected to the Soviet Union in 1950, has long been suspected of having been involved in espionage. No evidence {{that he was a}} Soviet agent has ever been established, but the GRU obtained samples of uranium and blueprints of the NRX, for which Nunn May could not have been the source, and Pontecorvo remains the prime suspect. When the spy ring became public knowledge in February 1946, the Americans became more cautious about sharing information with Britain and Canada.|$|E
5|$|The arms of Canada are {{the arms}} of the {{sovereign}} and signify national sovereignty and ownership. They are used as a mark of authority by various government agencies and representatives, including the prime minister and Cabinet, and most courts, including the Supreme Court, as well as the Canadian Armed Forces and Royal Canadian Mounted Police. It is also present on all pre-polymer denominations of Canadian banknotes (in fact, the way the arms were printed on each bill is a security feature), as well as the 50¢ coin, and on the cover of Canadian passports. Since 1962, a banner of the arms, defaced with a variant of the Queen's <b>cypher,</b> has formed the sovereign's standard for Canada, for use by the Queen in her capacity as monarch of Canada. Since, six additional standards for use by other members of the Canadian Royal Family have been created.|$|E
