40|$|Background: Activity Based Costing (ABC) {{is one of}} the {{new methods}} began {{appearing}} as a costing methodology in the 1990. It <b>calculates</b> <b>cost</b> price by determining the usage of resources. In this study, ABC method was used for <b>calculating</b> <b>cost</b> price of remedial services in hospitals. Methods: To apply ABC method, Shahid Faghihi Hospital was selected. First, hospital units were divided into three main departments: administrative, diagnostic, and hospitalized. Second, activity centers were defined by the activity analysis method. Third, costs of administrative activity centers were allocated into diagnostic and operational departments based on the cost driver. Finally, with regard to the usage of cost objectives from services of activity centers, the cost price of medical services was <b>calculated.</b> Results: The <b>cost</b> price from ABC method significantly differs from tariff method. In addition, high amount of indirect costs in the hospital indicates that capacities of resources are not used properly. Conclusion: Cost price of remedial services with tariff method is not properly calculated when compared with ABC method. ABC <b>calculates</b> <b>cost</b> price by applying suitable mechanisms but tariff method is based on the fixed price. In addition, ABC represents useful information about the amount and combination of cost price services...|$|R

5000|$|Median {{barriers}} can {{be divided}} into three basic categories: rigid barrier systems, semi-rigid barrier systems, and flexible barrier systems. Rigid barrier systems are made up of concrete and are the most common barrier type in use today (e.g. Jersey barrier or concrete step barrier). They are the most costly to install, but have relatively low life-cycle costs, making them economically viable over time. The second barrier type, semi-rigid, is commonly known as guardrail or guiderail barriers. The initial installation of this type can reach as much as $100,000 per mile. [...] These more forgiving barriers are meant to absorb the impact of an accident, and as a result, increase the cost of their life-cycle with each crash and each repair. The third median barrier type is the flexible barrier systems (e.g. cable barriers). Cable barriers are the most forgiving and the least expensive to install, but have high life-cycle costs due to repair needs after crashes. On the other hand, they have been shown to have <b>calculated</b> <b>cost</b> benefits calculating to as much as $420,000 per mile annually. [...] Much cheaper collision reduction methods are to improve road markings, to reduce speeds and to separate traffic with wide central hatching.|$|E
50|$|Johann III Bernoulli served from 1764 to 1787 as Director of the Old Observatory and was {{succeeded by}} Johann Elert Bode. Lambert fetched Bode to Berlin in 1773, {{in order to}} publish an almanac; after Lambert' death, Bode became the sole editor. The first edition of the Berliner Astronomisches Jahrbuch (for 1776) had already {{appeared}} by 1774, initiating the longest-lasting publication series in astronomy, lasting until 1959. By virtue of this medium, Berlin Observatory developed into an information source of prime importance within Europe. Originally Bode had the venerable Christine Kirch to assist him with {{the work on the}} calendar. In 1774, he married a granddaughter of one of her sisters; she was likewise entrusted with astronomical work in line with the Kirch family tradition. Christine Kirch died in 1782. As director of the observatory, Bode was able, through favors from Frederick William III of Prussia, to extend the till then rather third-class-equipped institution with a second observing level. When Bode entered a petition to this effect on 2 November 1798, space for observing within the tower was still limited to the third storey. The two storeys over it were united to a single spacious level. From there, the observing activities could be extended, once the <b>calculated</b> <b>cost</b> of 4465 talers and the plan was approved on 7 April 1800 and the required conversion was completed by June 1801.

The project capital costs together with the estimated cost of rail operation plus the cost of repaying the capital infrastructure debt were identified in a Pro Forma Income Statement for the improved railway enterprise (a designed railway company) at a given future year 2017 tonnage. The project design was built around an attempt to resolve for the lowest possible bulk cargo rates to reach a new proposed bulk cargo port south of Dakar. The target rate was <$32 a metric ton at standard gauge and somewhat higher at meter gauge. This pro forma analysis shows evidence that the railway can be independently financed by investors without the need of a Senegal or a Mali mine company actual railway [...] "ownership" [...] (a burden to the mine company Balance Sheet). A railway authority is recommended as a means of attracting private capital using the bonding and commercial structure of such a government of Senegal and Mali chartered body rather than a conventional concession approach. The railway feasibility was based on a variety of engineering and economic possible designs that used different rail mode market shares and different levels of railway operating efficiency (operating ratios) and different track structure safety standards. Naturally, the local African leaders will have to make the final design choices. From an economic point of view, subsidies and doners are not necessary if the traffic market share and the engineering and train operational designs are correctly matched.USTDA financed The next step is for the large shippers to meet collectively or individually with UEMOA and test the feasibility study against their specific (and often private) shipper requirements. Either the authors or UEMOA should be contacted. In the meantime, rail service is continuing in the corridor under the existing concession arrangement.|$|E

40|$|Abstract- In {{the present}} health care environment, {{cost-benefit}} analysis is extremely important. In this screening program, the minimal cost of screening dipstick urinalysis in 1601 asymptomatic school children was determined. The process of screening {{was similar to}} all the studies. The minimal cost utilizing 3 general physicians was calculated. Costs were determined by using current charge for supplies ordered to perform tests, charges for tests performed by a commercial laboratory, {{and the cost of}} a final evaluation by a pediatric nephrologist. Initial abnormal urinalysis was found in 4. 7 % (76 / 1601) of patients. Upon retesting 1. 37 % (22 / 1601) of patients were calculated to have a persistent abnormality. The <b>calculated</b> <b>cost</b> was 1 / 530 / 000 Rials (164. 5 $) to initially screen all 1601 patients with a dipstick urinalysis or 850 Rials (0. 09 $) per patient. The <b>calculated</b> <b>cost</b> to evaluate the 22 patients with any persistent abnormality on repeat dipstick urinalysis was 246 / 840 Rials (26. 5 $) or 11. 220 Rials (1. 2 $) per patient. This is the <b>calculated</b> <b>cost</b> for a single screening of 1601 asymptomatic pediatric patients.
