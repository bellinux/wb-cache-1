5|$|Examples of glycerophospholipids {{found in}} {{biological}} membranes are phosphatidylcholine (also known as PC, GPCho or lecithin), phosphatidylethanolamine (PE or GPEtn) and phosphatidylserine (PS or GPSer). In addition to {{serving as a}} primary component of <b>cellular</b> <b>membranes</b> and binding sites for intra- and intercellular proteins, some glycerophospholipids in eukaryotic cells, such as phosphatidylinositols and phosphatidic acids are either precursors of or, themselves, membrane-derived second messengers. Typically, {{one or both of}} these hydroxyl groups are acylated with long-chain fatty acids, but there are also alkyl-linked and 1Z-alkenyl-linked (plasmalogen) glycerophospholipids, as well as dialkylether variants in archaebacteria.|$|E
5|$|The nuclear envelope, {{otherwise}} known as nuclear membrane, consists of two <b>cellular</b> <b>membranes,</b> an inner and an outer membrane, arranged {{parallel to one another}} and separated by 10 to 50 nanometres (nm). The nuclear envelope completely encloses the nucleus and separates the cell's genetic material from the surrounding cytoplasm, serving as a barrier to prevent macromolecules from diffusing freely between the nucleoplasm and the cytoplasm. The outer nuclear membrane is continuous with the membrane of the rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER), and is similarly studded with ribosomes. The space between the membranes is called the perinuclear space and is continuous with the RER lumen.|$|E
5|$|Attachment is a {{specific}} binding between viral capsid proteins and specific receptors on the host cellular surface. This specificity determines the host range of a virus. For example, HIV infects a limited range of human leucocytes. This is because its surface protein, gp120, specifically interacts with the CD4 molecule – a chemokine receptor – which is most commonly found {{on the surface of}} CD4+ T-Cells. This mechanism has evolved to favour those viruses that infect only cells in which they are capable of replication. Attachment to the receptor can induce the viral envelope protein to undergo changes that results in the fusion of viral and <b>cellular</b> <b>membranes,</b> or changes of non-enveloped virus surface proteins that allow the virus to enter.|$|E

5|$|APOA5 mainly {{functions}} to influence plasma triglyceride levels. The first suggested mechanism supposes that APOA5 functions as an activator of lipoprotein lipase (which {{is a key}} enzyme in triglyceride catabolism) and, through this process, enhances the metabolism of TG-rich particles. The second is the possible effect of APOA5 on the secretion of VLDL particles, since APOA5 reduces hepatic production by inhibiting VLDL-particle production and assembly by binding to <b>cellular</b> <b>membranes</b> and lipids. Finally, the third possibility relates to the acceleration of the hepatic uptake of lipoprotein remnants {{and it has been}} shown that APOA5 binds to different members of the low-density lipoprotein receptor family. In addition to its TG-lowering effect, APOA5 also plays a significant role in modulating HDL maturation and cholesterol metabolism. Increased APOA5 levels were associated with skewed cholesterol distribution from VLDL to large HDL particles. APOA5 mRNA is upregulated during liver regeneration and this suggests that APOA5 serves a function in hepatocyte proliferation. It’s also reported that APOA5 could enhance insulin secretion in beta-cells and the cell surface midkine could be involved in APOA5 endocytosis.|$|E

The diffusion of ions, due this DC current, through the <b>cellular</b> <b>membrane</b> generates a transmembrane potential. The potential profile across <b>cellular</b> <b>membrane</b> is evaluated by the use of an analytical method applied over the conceived Tumor Cellular Model. The Tumor Cellular Model has two merits.

40|$|Steady-state {{fluorescence}} polarization {{studies with}} the fluorescent lipid probe 1, 6 -diphenyl 1, 3, 5 -hexatriene were done {{to determine the}} degree of microviscosity of <b>cellular</b> <b>membrane</b> lipids and serum lipoproteins in human normal donors and leukemic patients. The results show a marked decrease in microviscosity of <b>cellular</b> <b>membrane</b> lipids in both intact lymphocytes and isolated <b>cellular</b> plasma <b>membranes</b> obtained from leukemic patients in clinical relapse as compared to intact lymphocytes and isolated <b>cellular</b> plasma <b>membranes</b> obtained from normal donors and leukemic patients in complete clinical remission. Concomitant to these dynamic changes in <b>cellular</b> <b>membrane</b> lipids, the degree of microviscosity of lipids in the blood serum of leukemic patients in clinical relapse is markedly reduced as compared to serum obtained from normal donors and leukemic patients in complete clinical remission. Moreover, an in vitro incubation of leukemic lymphocytes with normal low density lipoproteins results in an increased microviscosity of <b>cellular</b> <b>membrane</b> lipids. In addition to the interrelation between <b>cellular</b> <b>membrane</b> lipids and serum lipoproteins, plasma membrane vesicles {{with a high degree}} of lipid microviscosity were isolated from the blood serum and pleural effusion of leukemic patients in clinical relapse. Such membrane vesicles could not be detected in normal serum. Therefore, we suggest that the two major mechanisms associated with the decreased microviscosity of membrane lipids in human leukemic cells are an abnormal exchange in lipids between the leukemic cell surface membrane and leukemic serum lipoproteins and an exfoliation of plasma membrane vesicles {{with a high degree of}} microviscosity from the cell surface of leukemic cells...|$|R

40|$|AbstractEnveloped viruses exit {{their host}} cell by budding from a <b>cellular</b> <b>membrane</b> and thereby spread from one cell to another. Virus budding in general {{involves}} the distortion of a <b>cellular</b> <b>membrane</b> {{away from the}} cytoplasm, envelopment of the viral capsid {{by one or more}} lipid bilayers that are enriched in viral membrane glycoproteins, and a fission event that separates the enveloped virion from the <b>cellular</b> <b>membrane.</b> While it was initially thought that virus budding is always driven by viral transmembrane proteins interacting with the inner structural proteins, {{it is now clear that}} the driving force may be different depending on the virus. Research over the past years has shown that viral components specifically interact with host cell lipids and proteins, thereby adopting cellular functions and pathways to facilitate virus release. This review summarizes the current knowledge of the <b>cellular</b> <b>membrane</b> systems that serve as viral budding sites and of the viral and cellular factors involved in budding.

25|$|Their {{life cycle}} {{is thought to}} begin with a virion {{attaching}} to specific cell-surface receptors such as C-type lectins, DC-SIGN, or integrins, which is followed by fusion of the viral envelope with <b>cellular</b> <b>membranes.</b> The virions taken up by the cell then travel to acidic endosomes and lysosomes where the viral envelope glycoprotein GP is cleaved. This processing appears to allow the virus to bind to cellular proteins enabling it to fuse with internal <b>cellular</b> <b>membranes</b> and release the viral nucleocapsid. The Ebolavirus structural glycoprotein (known as GP1,2) is responsible for the virus' ability to bind to and infect targeted cells. The viral RNA polymerase, encoded by the L gene, partially uncoats the nucleocapsid and transcribes the genes into positive-strand mRNAs, which are then translated into structural and nonstructural proteins. The most abundant protein produced is the nucleoprotein, whose concentration in the host cell determines when L switches from gene transcription to genome replication. Replication of the viral genome results in full-length, positive-strand antigenomes that are, in turn, transcribed into genome copies of negative-strand virus progeny. Newly synthesized structural proteins and genomes self-assemble and accumulate near the inside of the cell membrane. Virions bud off from the cell, gaining their envelopes from the cellular membrane from which they bud. The mature progeny particles then infect other cells to repeat the cycle. The genetics of the Ebola virus are difficult to study because of EBOV's virulent characteristics.|$|E
25|$|Actin {{participates in}} many {{important}} cellular processes, including muscle contraction, cell motility, cell division and cytokinesis, vesicle and organelle movement, cell signaling, {{and the establishment}} and maintenance of cell junctions and cell shape. Many of these processes are mediated by extensive and intimate interactions of actin with <b>cellular</b> <b>membranes.</b> In vertebrates, three main groups of actin isoforms, alpha, beta, and gamma have been identified. The alpha actins, found in muscle tissues, are a major constituent of the contractile apparatus. The beta and gamma actins coexist in most cell types as components of the cytoskeleton, and as mediators of internal cell motility. It is believed that the diverse range of structures formed by actin enabling it to fulfill such a large range of functions is regulated through the binding of tropomyosin along the filaments.|$|E
25|$|ABC {{transporters}} {{utilize the}} energy of ATP binding and hydrolysis to transport various substrates across <b>cellular</b> <b>membranes.</b> They are divided into three main functional categories. In prokaryotes, importers mediate the uptake of nutrients into the cell. The substrates that can be transported include ions, amino acids, peptides, sugars, and other molecules that are mostly hydrophilic. The membrane-spanning region of the ABC transporter protects hydrophilic substrates from the lipids of the membrane bilayer thus providing a pathway across the cell membrane. Eukaryotes do not possess any importers. Exporters or effluxers, which are present both in prokaryotes and eukaryotes, function as pumps that extrude toxins and drugs out of the cell. In gram-negative bacteria, exporters transport lipids and some polysaccharides from the cytoplasm to the periplasm. The third subgroup of ABC proteins do not function as transporters, but are rather involved in translation and DNA repair processes.|$|E

25|$|The mononegavirus {{life cycle}} begins with virion {{attachment}} to specific cell-surface receptors, followed by fusion of the virion envelope with <b>cellular</b> <b>membranes</b> and the concomitant {{release of the}} virus nucleocapsid into the cytosol. The virus RdRp partially uncoats the nucleocapsid and transcribes the genes into positive-stranded mRNAs, which are then translated into structural and nonstructural proteins. Mononegavirus RdRps bind to a single promoter located at the 3' end of the genome. Transcription either terminates after a gene or continues to the next gene downstream. This means that genes close to the 3' end of the genome are transcribed in the greatest abundance, whereas those toward the 5' end are least likely to be transcribed. The gene order is therefore a simple but effective form of transcriptional regulation. The most abundant protein produced is the nucleoprotein, whose concentration in the cell determines when the RdRp switches from gene transcription to genome replication. Replication results in full-length, positive-stranded antigenomes that are in turn transcribed into negative-stranded virus progeny genome copies.

2500|$|Choline is in {{high demand}} during {{pregnancy}} as a substrate for building <b>cellular</b> <b>membranes,</b> (rapid fetal and mother tissue expansion), increased need for one-carbon moieties (a substrate for addition of methylation to DNA and other functions), raising choline stores in fetal and placental tissues, and for increased production of lipoproteins (proteins containing [...] "fat" [...] portions). In particular, there is interest in the impact of choline consumption on the brain. This stems from choline's use as a material for making <b>cellular</b> <b>membranes,</b> (particularly in making phosphatidylcholine). Human brain growth is most rapid during the third trimester of pregnancy {{and continues to be}} rapid to approximately five years of age. During this time, the demand is high for sphingomyelin, which is made from phosphytidyl choline (and thus from choline), because this material is used to myelinate (insulate) nerve fibers. Choline is also in demand for the production of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, which can influence the structure and organization of brain regions, neurogenesis, myelination, and synapse formation. Acetylcholine is even present in the placenta and may help control cell proliferation/differentiation (increases in cell number and changes of multiuse cells into dedicated cellular functions) and parturition.|$|E
