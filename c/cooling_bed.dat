Rods to be beta heat treated by-pass the <b>cooling</b> <b>bed</b> and were lifted into the beta heat treating furnace by means of a hoist, to be held at 1,320-1,365 °F for 11-20 minutes and then quenched in cold water. After quenching, these rods were conveyed to the Medart straightener for straightening. The rods were located in -inch Acme-Gridley automatic screw machines where slugs were cut from the rods. The Hanford slugs were then placed in the Heald machine, which cuts the slugs to desired lengths and finishes and radiuses the ends. The Savannah River slugs were reduced to exact dimensions of size, surface, and straightness on a centerless grinder after which a contour was placed on the surface by a thread rolling machine. The slugs were numbered and put on a basket on a conveyor that passes through a degreasing tank, pickling tank, two rinse tanks and a hot air dryer before depositing the slug basket in the Inspection Department. The slugs were inspected for seams, striations, dimensions and handling defects with the good slugs being packed for shipment.|$|E
50|$|The {{quenching}} process {{produces a}} high strength bar from inexpensive low carbon steel. The process quenches the surface {{layer of the}} bar, which pressurizes and deforms the crystal structure of intermediate layers, and simultaneously begins to temper the quenched layers using {{the heat from the}} bar's core. Steel billets 130mm² ("pencil ingots") are heated to approximately 1200°C to 1250°C in a reheat furnace. Then, they are progressively rolled to reduce the billets to the final size and shape of reinforcing bar. After the last rolling stand, the billet moves through a quench box. The quenching converts the billet's surface layer to martensite, and causes it to shrink. The shrinkage pressurizes the core, helping to form the correct crystal structures. The core remains hot, and austenitic. A microprocessor controls the water flow to the quench box, to manage the temperature difference through the cross-section of the bars. The correct temperature difference assures that all processes occur, and bars have the necessary mechanical properties. The bar leaves the quench box with a temperature gradient through its cross section. As the bar cools, heat flows from the bar's centre to its surface so that the bar's heat and pressure correctly tempers an intermediate ring of martensite and bainite. Finally, the slow cooling after quenching automatically tempers the austenitic core to ferrite and pearlite on the <b>cooling</b> <b>bed.</b>|$|E
40|$|In recent years, {{the steel}} {{industry}} has undertaken efforts to increase energy efficiency by reducing energy consumption and recover otherwise lost heat. About 60 % of the energy consumed in a steel plant is lost in cooling beds where the hot steel beams are cooled down by natural convection and radiation. In this paper, the potential of heat recovery by radiation in a <b>cooling</b> <b>bed</b> was determined. Firstly, numerical simulations of the heat flux were done and validated with experimental measures. Secondly, a pilot test to recover the heat with modified solar absorbers was installed {{at the side of}} the <b>cooling</b> <b>bed.</b> The standard solar panels were painted with high absorption paint in the wavelength range of the hot beams. The results showed that up to 1 kW/m 2 could be recovered with a temperature of 70 °C {{at the side of the}} <b>cooling</b> <b>bed,</b> with a thermal efficiency of approximately 40 %. As the experimental results were promising, further research is suggested to find an adequate selective coating and glazing. This would maximize the absorption at the wavelength range of the hot beams and minimize the emissivity at operational temperature of the absorber (100 °C). Additionally, it would be of interest to find the optimum position for the absorbers in the <b>cooling</b> <b>bed,</b> which maximizes the heat recovery and does not interfere in the production process...|$|E

40|$|This diploma {{work was}} {{performed}} at Ovako Steel’s plant in Hofors, Sweden. At the tube mill, hot rolled seamless tubes are produced. Large amounts of energy {{are needed for}} the rolling and the heat treatment of the tubes. The purpose of this thesis was to investigate possibilities to reduce the consumption {{of energy in the}} tube mill. The heating of steel at the tube mill is mainly done by combustion of propan 95, a fossil fuel. An inventory of the energy flow in the tube mill, made by heat balances over the process stages showed that the furnaces (a rotary furnace and heat treatment furnaces) are in poor condition. Significant improvements can be achieved with economical and environmental revenues as a result. The tubes are placed on a <b>cooling</b> <b>bed</b> after the rolling. A lot of heat is released from the tubes on the <b>cooling</b> <b>bed</b> and should be recovered, but today technology is not available that is applicable to the conditions of the <b>cooling</b> <b>bed</b> in the tube mill. Since propan 95 is a fossil fuel, combustion will increase the content of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. By exporting waste heat to a nearby heat and power plant, biofuel will be released that can replace fossil fuel in another heat plant and global carbon dioxide emissions will be reduced. An improvement of the rotary furnace will decrease the consumption of propan 95 from 2388 tons per year to 1600 tons, which also leads to a decrease of the emissions of carbon dioxide by 33 %. Recovery of the heat in the flue gas by export of waste heat would decrease the emissions by another 633 tons per year. The heat treatment furnaces can reduce the use of propan 95 by 25 %, but recovering heat in the flue gas stream is not recommended...|$|E

40|$|Four {{studies were}} {{conducted}} to evaluate the effects of supplemental cooling and niacin on heat stress (HS) responses in vivo and in vitro in lactating dairy cows. For experiment one, lactating dairy cows were fed four levels of dietary niacin, NIASHURE® (0, 4, 8, 12 g/d) for 21 d. Heat stress decreased niacin levels in whole blood, red blood cells and plasma as compared to thermoneutral. Water intake, plasma and milk niacin concentrations increased linearly with increasing dietary niacin in HS cattle. In thermoneutral, but not HS cows, niacin increased skin temperature compared to controls suggesting niacin increased skin blood flow and sensible heat loss. In experiment 2, lactating cows were {{used to evaluate the}} impact of feed-line soaking (FLS) combined with niacin supplementation.
