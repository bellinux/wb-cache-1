To do this we collected two large data sets from Mininova. com and Amazon. <b>com,</b> <b>documenting</b> levels of piracy and DVD sales for both NBC and other major networks' content around these events. We analyze these data in a difference-in-difference model and find that NBC's decision to remove its content from iTunes in December 2007 is causally associated with an 11. 4 % increase in the demand for NBC's pirated content. This is roughly equivalent to an increase of 48, 000 downloads a day for NBC's content and is approximately twice as large as the total legal purchases on iTunes for the same content in the period preceding the removal. We also find evidence of a smaller, and statistically insignificant, decrease in piracy for the same content when it was restored to the iTunes store in September 2008.

A weblog (hhtp://quilted-out-ofspace. blogspot. <b>com)</b> will <b>document</b> the process and in turn be analysed to explore parallels with the processes of making a quilt— including the potential for alternative social networks such as ‘cybermovements’, ‘submerged networks’, and ‘counterpublics’. The quilts of Emma Rowden, Judy McDermott, and Pamela Fitzsimons interrogate specific places within New South Wales—the site of a former mental asylum and now college of the arts (Callan Park), a jail (Long Bay) and a place of natural but now endangered beauty (Bow Wow Gorge). They expose many and varied voices: those of the ‘mad’ and the ‘bad’, the institution, alternative notions of home, and concepts of time. Each artist also taps into a subtext of the personal and private, producing work that subverts the comforting notion of the quilt, thereby ‘shattering’ prior expectations of the form. The ‘here’ and ‘now’ of performance allows the speaker to embody these many voices, to which she adds her own, thereby creating yet another space which, by its inherent instability has the potential to open up yet other connections, other possibilities, and the dissolution of boundaries...|$|R

This non-line-of-sight technology has the potential of dramatically increasing the level of visibility throughout the supply chain for many types of products, assisting in defect reduction, increased granularity in inventory tracking, and decreased direct labor. In recent years, developments in RFID technology have decreased the cost of RFID equipment, and several large U. S. retailers have started to use RFID to track consumer products. However, what is not clear is whether or not these RFID implementations have yielded economic returns. Although RFID promises higher read rates and increased accuracy, how the technology works in particular warehouse settings is not clear. The first step to determining the feasibility of RFID in any organization is the complete evaluation of RFID technology.

[...] University of Washington, 2012 University of Washington Abstract Oboebasics. com A Modern Method for Oboe Embouchure Jennifer Elise Muehrcke Chair of the Supervisory Committee: Professor Steven Morrison Music This {{dissertation}} {{presents a}} method for teaching oboe embouchure aimed specifically at the beginner oboe student, using video instruction via the Internet. This is a two-tiered project involving {{the creation of the}} website www. oboebasics. <b>com</b> and a <b>document</b> which explains the project's origins and development. The website includes instruction and videos that address embouchure, breath control, posture, hand position, articulation, pitch, and tone quality. The website's materials are also relevant to intermediate and advanced students as well as teachers, instructors, and ensemble directors. The curriculum is formatted in a progressive manner with an overall focus on creating the proper embouchure. Chapter one of the dissertation examines past and current teaching methods of oboe embouchure offered in method books, journals, dissertations, CDs, DVDs, and Internet resources. This survey provides an overview of resources available to oboe players. Chapter two then details my approach to teaching oboe embouchure, discussing how to evaluate the embouchure, analyzing problems, and finding solutions. Exercises and practice methods to assist in attaining the proper embouchure are also presented. The second half of the document explains the development and testing of multiple versions of the website, culminating in www. oboebasics. com. Chapter three details the website building process and the technical aspects of script writing, filming, post-production, and the decision-making involved in building this website. Chapter four focuses on the testing of the website, which took place {{over the course of a}} year. The testing process included alpha, beta and kappa testing to gain input on the appearance, functionality, and effectiveness of the website as it evolved. The evaluative process aided in the construction of the website and provided a framework for post-doctoral work. The instruction and exercises presented in the website and document were culled from my oboe studies, my teaching experience, and my knowledge of what works for beginner students and oboists in general. The embouchure remains the focus of the website as the cornerstone of all other techniques. It is a vital starting point for any player and the most unique fundamental of oboe playing...|$|R
40|$|After the adoption, of the EU Climate and Energy Package (2008), the European Commission {{launched}} the Covenant of Mayors (CoM) to endorse {{and support the}} efforts deployed by local authorities {{in the implementation of}} sustainable energy policies. Nowadays the CoM is the mainstream European movement involving local and regional authorities, voluntarily committing to meet and exceed the European Union 20 % CO 2 reduction objective by 2020. Up to mid-March 2013, 5 ˙ 049 municipalities, representing 160 million citizens in EU and 27 from outside, signed the Covenant of Mayors (<b>CoM).</b> A key <b>document,</b> showing how to reach the emission reduction is the Sustainable Energy Action Plan (SEAP) that is submitted by the local authority together with a Baseline Emission Inventory (BEI). It identifies the sectors of human activity and emission abatement measures that are furtheron yearly monitored and compared with the reduction target. The SEAP covers mainly the CO 2 emissions that occur due to energy consumption in the territory and under the responsibility of the local authority (excluding industries). Examples of actions are the development of the district heating network, wind farms and solar photovoltaic installation, but also wastewater and solid waste treatment with methane recovery. CoM authorities may decide to account emissions using either a standard or a LCA approach. The two approaches have common activity data but different emission factors (EF) for each energy carrier, for which national defaults are provided in the CoM Guidebook. Whereas the IPCC standard yields an amount of emissions related to the carbon content of the vector, the LCA approach produces a more holistic amount of emissions that is related to the whole fuel supply-chain that is characterised by the European reference Life Cycle Database (ELCD). Practicaly, the different system boundaries of the two approaches are included in the application of different EFs. We analysed statistically a sample of 1 ˙ 278 SEAPs (representative for 50 million EU citizens) that are accepted by 11 / 06 / 2013 and that did not show outlayer values. The LCA approach is used much less (by 76 authorities out of the 1 ˙ 278) than the standard IPCC approach. In order to promote the LCA approach, a comparison with IPCC approach and analysis of benefits and drawbacks is needed. The SEAPs setup under LCA approach include on average less actions than the plans using IPCC approach (42 versus 47) and a smaller total emission reduction (85 ktCO 2 -eq versus 100 ktCO 2 -eq). Nevertheless the average reduction estimation per action for SEAPs using LCA is larger than for plans using IPCC (3600 tCO 2 -eq/action versus 2000 tCO 2 -eq/action). Among other aspects, also the share of sectors in SEAPs differs. Plans with LCA approach include more actions in non-energy-related emission sectors, such as waste managements, and in sectors with local electricity production and local district heating. In general terms, actions in SEAPs planned using an LCA approach lead to a more holistic accounting of emission reduction but they remain more complex to understand and prepare by the local authorities. Extra effort on specific database for SEAPs using LCA is worth to be envisaged in order to facilitate the use of such method. Furthermore the LCA approach resulted particulary fitted for Southern countries (see the involment in the CoM of countries from Magreb and Masrik regions) with more potential in non-energy-related sectors.
