However, the expense {{to do this is}} considerable in bothmaterials and in installation labor. More common are STC45 walls that end at a suspended mineral tile ceiling, return air grilles and a <b>continuous</b> <b>ceiling</b> plenum between rooms. It that case, Confidential Privacy can be achieved with sound masking. The table on the right shows a sound masking spectrum that accomplishes that objective under the conditions listed above. The overall level for that spectrum is 44 dB(A). Variations in installation quality have shown that overall levels from 42 to 45 dB(A) may be acceptable.|$|E
50|$|In some offices, {{particularly}} warehouses {{that have}} been converted to office space, there is no ceiling plenum. Masking speakers are hung {{in a similar manner}} to those above suspended ceilings but the speaker spacing and height is different. Typically, the speakers are mounted higher and the spacing between them is closer. The height of the structural ceiling above is a large factor in spacing, as is {{the presence or absence of}} sound absorbing materials on the ceiling surface. Reasonably good uniformity of sound masking can be achieved. Some office designs employ the use of scattered (as opposed to <b>continuous)</b> <b>ceiling</b> tiles (clouds). Careful design is needed to achieve reasonable sound masking uniformity.|$|E

40|$|The seismic {{damage of}} {{non-structural}} components could involve functionality interruption {{of the most}} affected buildings and substantial economic losses. Among non-structural components, the lightweight steel ceiling-partition wall systems can represent a significant investment in the construction sector. Nevertheless, the proper seismic design of these systems plays a secondary role within the current structural design, by leading {{to a lack of}} specific design provisions. Since the behaviour of these systems cannot be easily simulated with traditional analysis methods, the experimental characterization is an effective procedure.

The RRS is obtained {{as a function of the}} design spectral response acceleration at short peri-ods, SDS, depending on the site soil condition and the mapped maximum earthquake spectral acceleration at short periods. The selection procedure is performed, for a RRS corresponding to SDS= 1. 50 g; the so obtained record is then scaled to match other four levels of the target spectrum (corresponding to SDS 0. 30 g, 0. 60 g, 0. 90 g and 1. 20 g). These accelerograms, representative of different intensity levels, are then applied to a test setup opportunely designed and realized to perform the shaking table tests.

The seismic qualification of <b>continuous</b> <b>ceiling</b> systems, plasterboard and brick internal partitions via shake table tests is described in the paper. The test campaign on <b>continuous</b> <b>ceiling</b> systems highlights the low fragility of the tested specimen, primarily caused by: (a) the continuous nature of the ceiling, (b) the dense suspen-sion grid, and (c) the large number of hangers being used. In order to test the internal partitions, which are mainly displacement-sensitive components, an appropriate steel test structure is designed. This structure simulates the behavior of a generic floor in a structure that exhibits an interstorey drift equal to 0. 5 % for a frequent earthquake, according to Eurocode 8 prescriptions. Three possible damage states are considered in the study and correlated to an engineering demand parameter, i. e. the interstorey drift ratio, through the use of a damage scheme. Extensive tests show an excellent seismic performance of the plasterboard partition walls, which are characterized by innovative anti-seismic details. In fact, they show minor damage when subjected to interstorey drifts even larger than 1 %.

50|$|Radiant cooling {{panels are}} {{generally}} attached to ceilings, {{but can be}} attached to walls also. They are usually suspended from the ceiling, but can also be directly integrated with <b>continuous</b> dropped <b>ceilings.</b> Modular construction offers increased flexibility in terms of placement and integration with lighting or other electrical systems. Lower thermal mass compared to chilled slabs means they can’t easily take advantage of passive cooling from thermal storage, but controls in panels can more quickly adjust to changes in outdoor temperature. Chilled panels are also better suited to buildings with spaces that have a greater variance in cooling loads. Perforated panels also offer better acoustical dampening than chilled slabs. Ceiling panels are also very suitable for retrofits {{because they can be}} attached to any ceiling. Chilled ceiling panels can be more easily integrated with ventilation supplied from the ceiling.

Among the non-structural building components, the ceiling-partition systems represent a large economic investment in construction sector. Nevertheless, their seismic performance is poorly understood, because information and specific guidance are very limited. In the last years, international studies have been conducted on the seismic behaviour of light gage steel stud partition walls (Lee et al. [1], Restrepo and Bersofsky [2], Tasligedik et al.

40|$|After an earthquake, {{the failure}} of {{suspended}} ceiling systems {{is one of the}} most widely reported types of nonstructural damage in building structures. Since suspended ceiling systems are not amenable to traditional structural analysis, full-scale experimental testing is planned and executed. In particular, shaking table tests are performed in order to investigate the seismic behaviour of plasterboard <b>continuous</b> suspended <b>ceilings</b> under strong earthquakes. Two kinds of ceiling systems, named single frame ceiling and double frame ceiling, are tested. A steel test frame is properly designed in order to simulate the seismic effects at a generic building storey. A set of five accelerograms, used as input for the shakings, are selected matching the target response spectrum provided by the U. S. code for nonstructural components. Three limit states (occupancy, damage and life safety limit state) are considered in this study in order to characterize the seismic response of suspended ceiling systems. The tested ceilings show no damage at all intensity levels, evidencing a low fragility. Three main aspects may be the cause of this low vulnerability: (a) the continuous nature of the tested ceilings; (b) the dense steel channel grid that supports the plasterboard panels; (c) the large number of hangers that connects the ceiling system to the roof, avoiding any vertical movement of the ceilings. Finally, an interesting comparison is made with a previous vulnerability study on a different typical U. S. ceiling system...|$|R
40|$|Some {{research}} studies concerning nonstructural components {{are described in}} this thesis, based on several motivations: (a) the threat to life-safety that the collapse of nonstructural components can cause; (b) the attitude of these components in exhibiting damage (and the consequent evacuation of buildings) even for low-intensity earthquakes; (c) the huge economic loss connected to their damage. Different experimental activities are carried out aiming at {{the evaluation of the}} seismic capacity of some nonstructural components, i. e. innovative plasterboard partitions, hollow brick partitions, standard high plasterboard partitions, hospital building contents and plasterboard <b>continuous</b> <b>ceilings.</b> A test setup is defined for each test campaign in order to subject the specimen to the demand that it would experience in a building. Realistic boundary conditions of the specimen are reproduced. A testing protocol is defined according to AC 156, in case shake table tests are conducted, and FEMA 461 prescriptions, in case quasi-static tests are performed. A slight modification to the testing protocol provided by FEMA 461 is proposed, considering a set of European earthquakes in lieu of American ones, while a seismic input is derived based on AC 156 prescriptions for shake table testing. After each test of each campaign the visual damage is correlated to the occurrence of a given Damage State (DS) {{through the use of a}} damage scheme. A relationship between an Engineering Demand Parameter (EDP), e. g. the interstory drift ratio or the peak floor acceleration, and a predefined Damage State (DS), is established for the tested components. In case the number of specimens within a test campaign is adequate, the fragility curve of the tested specimens, that expresses the attitude that the specimens have to exhibit damage at different seismic demand levels, is also evaluated. The damage progression is correlated to different properties of the test setup, such as its natural frequency, damping ratio and the dissipated energy. Macro-models of the tested specimens are also defined based on the experimental results for an easy implementation in a structural model of the tested nonstructural components. The evaluation of the seismic demand on nonstructural components is also a main objective of this research study. Nonstructural components should be subjected to a careful and rational seismic design, in order to reduce the economic loss and to avoid threats to the life safety, as well as what concerns the structural elements. A parametric study on five RC frame structures, designed according to Eurocode 8, is conducted. It is found that the Eurocode formulation for the evaluation of the seismic demand on nonstructural components does not well fit the outcomes of the analyses. Some comments on the target spectrum provided by AC 156 for the seismic qualification of nonstructural components are also included and a modification is proposed. The counterintuitive approach of current building codes to the design of nonstructural components is highlighted. For this reason the seismic demand on acceleration-sensitive nonstructural components caused by frequent earthquakes is also investigated. Finally, a novel formulation for the evaluation of such a demand is proposed for an easy implementation in future building codes based on the actual Eurocode provisions. The proposed formulation gives a good estimation of the floor spectral accelerations that result from the analyzed structures...|$|R
