5|$|In 2001, the Environmental Protection Agency sued MIT {{for violating}} the Clean Water Act and the Clean Air Act with regard to its {{hazardous}} waste storage and disposal procedures. MIT settled the suit by paying a $155,000 fine and launching three environmental projects. In connection with capital campaigns to expand the campus, the Institute has also extensively renovated existing buildings to improve their energy efficiency. MIT has also taken steps to reduce its environmental impact by running alternative fuel campus shuttles, subsidizing public transportation passes, and building a low-emission <b>cogeneration</b> <b>plant</b> that serves most of the campus electricity, heating, and cooling requirements.|$|E
5|$|The initial event {{caused a}} number of wood framed homes in Scotia to come off their {{foundations}} while the porches of some other homes became detached. The 25MW <b>cogeneration</b> <b>plant</b> there that used wood waste products to power both the lumber company and the town suffered damage and both lumber mills were shut down for several weeks. In Rio Dell, across the Eel River from Scotia, glass store fronts along the main street were shattered and numerous buildings slipped into a culvert along Monument Road. In Petrolia (the small community closest to the epicenter) the general store (combined with a post office and gas station) was destroyed by fire, and in Fortuna, damage totaled $4 million. A six figure portion of that figure was due to losses at the high school's gymnasium.|$|E
25|$|In {{the case}} of a fossil fueled <b>cogeneration</b> <b>plant,</b> the heat output is {{typically}} sized to meet half of the peak heat load but over the year will provide 90% of the heat supplied. The boiler capacity will be able to meet the entire heat demand unaided and can cover for breakdowns in the <b>cogeneration</b> <b>plant.</b> It is not economic to size the <b>cogeneration</b> <b>plant</b> alone to be able to meet the full heat load. In the New York City steam system, that is around 2.5 GW. Germany has the largest amount of CHP in Europe.|$|E

Due to the lack of heat demand in summer, <b>cogeneration</b> <b>plants</b> are only promising for providing positive balancing power. Furthermore, {{there is a lack of}} seasonal similarities in balancing power demand. That’s why seasonal variation of switch-on priorities for conventional and <b>cogeneration</b> <b>plants</b> seems to be most promising.

25|$|In Germany {{district}} heating has a {{market share of}} around 14% in the residential buildings sector. The connected heat load is around 52.729MW. The heat comes mainly from <b>cogeneration</b> <b>plants</b> (83%). Heat-only boilers supply 16% and 1% is surplus heat from industry. The <b>cogeneration</b> <b>plants</b> use natural gas (42%), coal (39%), lignite (12%) and waste/others (7%) as fuel.|$|R
25|$|The core {{element of}} many {{district}} heating systems is a heat-only boiler station. Additionally a <b>cogeneration</b> <b>plant</b> (also called combined heat and power, CHP) is often added {{in parallel with}} the boilers. Both have in common that they are typically based on combustion of primary energy carriers. The {{difference between the two}} systems is that, in a <b>cogeneration</b> <b>plant,</b> heat and electricity are generated simultaneously, whereas in heat-only boiler stations – as the name suggests – only heat is generated.|$|E

50|$|Industrial <b>cogeneration</b> <b>plants</b> {{normally}} {{operate at}} much lower boiler pressures than utilities. Among the reasons are: 1) <b>Cogeneration</b> <b>plants</b> face possible contamination of returned condensate. Because boiler feed water from <b>cogeneration</b> <b>plants</b> has much lower return rates than 100% condensing power plants, industries usually {{have to treat}} proportionately more boiler make up water. Boiler feed water must be completely oxygen free and de-mineralized, and the higher the pressure the more critical the level of purity of the feed water. 2) Utilities are typically larger scale power than industry, which helps offset the higher capital costs of high pressure. 3) Utilities {{are less likely to}} have sharp load swings than industrial operations, which deal with shutting down or starting up units that may represent a significant percent of either steam or power demand.|$|R

These and other fuels help power the Humboldt Bay Power Plant (which includes the now defunct and dismantled Humboldt Bay Nuclear Power Plant).

The heat is often obtained from a <b>cogeneration</b> <b>plant</b> burning fossil fuels but increasingly biomass, although heat-only boiler stations, geothermal heating and central solar heating are also used, as well as nuclear power. A system was built in France in the 14th Century and the United States Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland began steam district heating service in 1853. However, the first commercially successful district heating system was launched in Lockport, New York, in 1877 by American hydraulic engineer Birdsill Holly, considered the founder of modern district heating.|$|E

Colleges using district heating include the University of Texas at Austin; Rice University; Brigham Young University; Georgetown University; Cornell University, which also employs deep water source cooling using the waters of nearby Cayuga Lake; Purdue University; University of Notre Dame; Michigan State University; Case Western Reserve University; Iowa State University; University of Delaware;, University of Maryland, College Park , and several campuses of the University of California. MIT installed a cogeneration system in 1995 that provides electricity, heating and cooling to 80% of its campus buildings. The University of New Hampshire has a <b>cogeneration</b> <b>plant</b> run on methane from an adjacent landfill, providing the University with 100% of its heat and power needs without burning oil or natural gas.|$|E
25|$|District heating (also {{known as}} heat {{networks}} or teleheating) {{is a system}} for distributing heat generated in a centralized location for residential and commercial heating requirements such as space heating and water heating. The heat is often obtained from a <b>cogeneration</b> <b>plant</b> burning fossil fuels but increasingly also biomass, although heat-only boiler stations, geothermal heating, heat pumps and central solar heating are also used, as well as nuclear power. District heating plants can provide higher efficiencies and better pollution control than localized boilers. According to some research, district heating with {{combined heat and power}} (CHPDH) is the cheapest method of cutting carbon emissions, and has one of the lowest carbon footprints of all fossil generation plants. A combination of CHP and centralized heat pumps are used in the Stockholm multi energy system. This allows the production of heat through electricity when there is an abundance of intermittent power production and cogeneration of electric power and district heating when the availability of intermittent power production is low.|$|E
25|$|Because it is {{situated}} in a fairly rural area, the UConn campus at Storrs has facilities that {{allow it to be}} virtually self-sufficient. All heat on campus is steam, and where possible sidewalks were laid over the underground connectors to keep the snow off. In 2005, a <b>cogeneration</b> <b>plant</b> was activated, which generates most of the electricity for the campus, and uses the exhaust steam for the campus central heating system. The university owns its own public water system and waste water treatment facility. With the support {{of a growing number of}} industry leaders based in Connecticut, UConn is at the forefront of developing clean, alternative sources of renewable energy using fuel cell technology. In April 2012, UConn commissioned a fuel cell power plant at its Depot Campus that will supply the campus with clean and efficiency energy, cooling and heating. The installation of a ClearEdge Power, former UTC Power, PureCell System is the latest step by UConn to reduce its carbon footprint and build a sustainable community. The fuel cell installation was made possible through a federal stimulus grant from Connecticut’s Clean Energy Finance and Investment Authority.|$|E
