5|$|Casey's initial {{need was}} for {{engineer}} units {{to accomplish the}} daunting construction program, but soon stocks of engineer supplies and equipment began to run low. This was exacerbated by incoming units arriving without their equipment, or with it stowed on numerous ships, which often arrived at various ports in a theater where ports were hundred or thousands of miles apart. Critical shortages developed of tractors, graders, concrete mixers and welding equipment. In {{the absence of a}} proper stock control system, an overall <b>coordinating</b> <b>agency,</b> and adequate numbers of engineer depot units, the allocation and distribution of the meager supplies on hand were difficult tasks. The worst problem was spare parts. Equipment was operated around the clock under harsh conditions and soon wore out or broke. A large proportion of equipment became unserviceable for lack of spare parts. Requisitions sent to the United States took months to arrive, so recourse was made to the limited sources of supply in Australia.|$|E

25|$|The Co-operative Central Exchange (CCE) was a {{cooperative}} federation established {{at a meeting}} of representatives of 19 Finnish-American consumers' co-operatives held in Superior, Wisconsin, on July 30, 1917. The idea for a central <b>coordinating</b> <b>agency</b> to unit the existing network of cooperative stores in the Upper Midwest of the United States had been brewing for several years, based upon a desire to buy commonly sold goods more cheaply if purchased in bulk. Also driving the cooperatives to action was discriminatory credit practices practiced by the largest regional grocery and hard goods wholesaler, who restricted the extension of credit to the cooperatives {{at the behest of the}} privately-owned retailers who were competing with them. The magazine Pelto ja Koti (Farm and Home) was instrumental in coordinating the launch of the central cooperative initiative.|$|E

The Grand Secretariat drew its members from the Hanlin Academy and were considered part of the imperial authority, not the ministerial one (hence being at odds with both the emperor and ministers at times).

The news agency was also responsible to Ministry of Information which coordinated press activities. David Hill of Murdoch University points out that under the Suharto government Antara's Supervisory Council at one point included the deputy chief of the State Intelligence <b>Coordinating</b> <b>Agency,</b> indicating military interest in regulating the press. Antara's status as a government entity had come into question as restrictions on press activity were lifted.

According to a geospatial survey conducted between 2007 and 2010 by National <b>Coordinating</b> <b>Agency</b> for Survey and Mapping (Bakosurtanal), Indonesia has 13,466 islands, about 6,000 of which are inhabited. These are scattered over both sides of the equator. The largest are Java, Sumatra, Borneo (shared with Brunei and Malaysia), Sulawesi, and New Guinea (shared with Papua New Guinea). Indonesia shares land borders with Malaysia on Borneo, Papua New Guinea on the island of New Guinea, and East Timor on the island of Timor. Indonesia shares maritime borders across narrow straits with Singapore, Malaysia, Vietnam, the Philippines, and Palau to the north, and with Australia to the south. The capital, Jakarta, is on Java and is the country's largest city, followed by Surabaya, Bandung, Medan, and Semarang.|$|E
2500|$|Another plan {{proposed}} by RTA in 1978 {{called for a}} 1.5-mile extension of the Green Line east to Interstate 271 along with exit ramps from the interstate highway to a 1,500-car parking garage attached to a new station. [...] The cost {{of the project was}} estimated at $29 million. [...] The proposal was assailed almost immediately by various elements in the community. [...] The Northeast Ohio Areawide <b>Coordinating</b> <b>Agency</b> complained that the project would primarily benefit the more affluent parts of the community while its cost would be borne by residents of the entire county. [...] There were also arguments that the extension would only serve a low-population-density area, although the park-and-ride connection with the interstate highway provided a potential for increased ridership from throughout the eastern suburbs. [...] Ultimately, the RTA Board of Trustees voted unanimously that any extension of the Shaker Rapid Transit would be made only after improvements were made in other corridors to the southeast and the southwest and after a downtown distributor system was built. [...] The Board's refusal to commit funds for the extension was undoubtedly made because it had already announced plans to rebuild the entire Shaker Rapid Transit system, and it was unwise to spend too much of its capital resources on just one segment of a county-wide transit system.|$|E
2500|$|On August 4, the {{government}} of Belize declared a 30-day state of emergency. The government focused their initial disaster response on search and rescue missions, medical care, helping storm victims, cleaning debris from roads, and restoring utilities. The country's Minister of Works sent employees to clear blocked highways, and {{the government}} hired residents to help clean the streets from debris. Workers quickly restored 75% of the power outages within a day of the hurricane's passage, which increased to 99% by August11. All emergency shelters closed on August12, and the remaining displaced families were provided rent-free lodging {{for up to three}} months. The National Relief and Supplies Management Committee provided food, water, cleaning supplies, tarps, and mattresses to affected residents, helping 8,000people by August10. Damage to water systems resulted in decreased water pressure in buildings, possibly contaminating the nation's water supply. As a result, the Health Ministry advised residents to treat drinking water, and officials worked to repair water systems in the week after the storm's passage. The Belize Water Service sent a truck to the Old Northern Highway. About 90% of residents in damaged houses enacted their own repairs, with the help of neighbors. To assist with disaster relief, the European Union donated [...] to Belize through the Disaster Relief Emergency Fund of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies. Taiwan sent US$100,000 to the country. The Inter-American Development Bank provided US$200,000 to Belize to purchase food, medicine, and supplies to rebuild. Belize Telemedia Limited also donated US$50,000 toward disaster relief, and Norwegian Cruise Line donated BZ$100,000. The Belize government received US$261,073 from the Caribbean Catastrophe Risk Insurance Facility, having first bought an excess rainfall policy in June 2016. UNICEF acted as the primary <b>coordinating</b> <b>agency</b> for the United Nations, its first emergency in that capacity. The agency provided the government with $35,000 toward clean-up, 430family hygiene kits, and emergency SMSs to be distributed by phone.|$|E

40|$|The International Comparison Program (ICP) is a {{worldwide}} statistical initiative designed to estimate Purchasing Power Parities (PPPs) {{that can be}} used as currency converters to compare the performance of economies around the world. The ICP conducts surveys every five/six years to collect price and expenditure data for all goods and services that make up the Gross Domestic Product (GPD) in order to calculate the PPPs. To ensure the quality of PPP data, the ICP puts much effort into harmonizing and standardizing practices across countries and regions; effort goes into ensuring that countries use the same methodology and comparable data collection procedures. Being a multilateral comparison, the ICP does not only require correct and reliable price data, but also comparable data. To ensure correctness, reliability and comparability, the validation process is carried out at both the intra-country and the inter-country levels and requires close cooperation and collaboration between participating countries, Regional <b>Coordinating</b> <b>Agencies</b> and the ICP Global Office. The ICP Global Office holds bi-annual meetings with Regional <b>Coordinating</b> <b>Agencies</b> to discuss methodology and processes, while the Regional <b>Coordinating</b> <b>Agencies</b> organize frequent meetings, training sessions and validation workshops for participating countries to ensure consistency of methodology, comparability of prices and soundness of results.
