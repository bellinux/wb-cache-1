5|$|Every year of its 17-year run on CBS, Lassie placed {{first in}} its time slot, Sunday 7:00 P.M. EST, and often {{ranked among the}} top 25 shows on television. The show's highest ranking years in the Nielsen ratings were the Martin years when the show placed #24 in 1957, #22 in 1958, #15 in 1959, #15 in 1961, #21 in 1962, #13 in 1963, and #17 in 1964. The only Martin year Lassie did not <b>climb</b> <b>into</b> the top twenty-five was 1960, when it ran {{opposite}} Walt Disney Presents on ABC and Shirley Temple Theater on NBC. However, Lassie still ran opposite Disney when the Disney anthology television series moved to NBC in 1961, and still managed to <b>climb</b> <b>into</b> the Top 25. With {{the advent of the}} Forest Service seasons, the show began a steady decline in ratings.|$|E
5|$|Soaring {{related to}} wind shear, also called dynamic soaring, is a {{technique}} used by soaring birds like albatrosses, who can maintain flight without wing flapping. If the wind shear is of sufficient magnitude, a bird can <b>climb</b> <b>into</b> the wind gradient, trading ground speed for height, while maintaining airspeed. By then turning downwind, and diving through the wind gradient, they can also gain energy. It has also been used by glider pilots on rare occasions.|$|E
5|$|English doctor Maxwell (Shearsmith) {{settles into}} bunk 9E while {{travelling}} from Paris to Bourg-Saint-Maurice. Maxwell is disturbed first by Jorg (Pemberton), a drunk, flatulent German who climbs into bunk 9D, then by Kath (Hesmondhalgh) and Les (Benton), a couple travelling to their daughter's wedding. Jorg is in Les's bed, but the couple <b>climb</b> <b>into</b> 9A. Australian backpacker Shona (Gunning) enters; she places her bag on bunk 9C then leaves, and Maxwell closes the door. Kath and Les, laughing at Maxwell, begin to undress on the bed. Les wakes Jorg, but understanding is limited until Maxwell translates. Jorg switches to 9F and Les climbs into 9D.|$|E
50|$|He was spoofed on Late Night with David Letterman after <b>climbing</b> <b>into</b> a mock-up of the Chilean miners' rescue capsule. The {{producers}} of the show shot him into the sun after showing him <b>climbing</b> <b>into</b> the mock-up.|$|R

5|$|Feit {{initially}} denied hearing Garza's confession in the rectory, but {{he later}} {{admitted to having}} done so. He accounted for his absence from the sanctuary by explaining that he had broken his glasses that night; {{he said that he}} often played with his glasses nervously as he listened to confession. Feit said that he had driven back to the pastoral house to get another pair of glasses, and when he arrived he had no key, so he had to <b>climb</b> <b>into</b> the house on the second floor. He said that he sustained the scratches on his hands as was climbing the outside of the brick structure.|$|E
5|$|Seventeen-year-old Andy {{is about}} to leave for college, and his toys have not been played with for years. He intends to take Woody with him, and puts Buzz Lightyear, Jessie, and the other toys in a trash bag to be stored in the attic. Andy's mother mistakenly takes the bag to the curb for garbage pickup. The toys escape and, believing Andy {{intended}} to throw them away, decide to <b>climb</b> <b>into</b> a donation box with Molly's discarded toy, Barbie, bound for Sunnyside Daycare. Woody follows them, but is unable to convince them of the mistake.|$|E
5|$|Another {{example of}} his {{leadership}} and his coup d'œil, {{the ability to see}} at a glance what needed to be done, occurred after the Battle of Kolin. The loss at Kolin forced the King to lift the siege at Prague. The King's brother, Augustus William, took command of the army and ordered the retreat from Prague. Seydlitz was attached to the advanced corps of Karl Christoph von Schmettau in a brigade of ten squadrons. As Seydlitz's wing entered Lusatia, near the town of Zittau, the Austrians were present in force, and Seydlitz with his squadrons were trapped in the town. Tricking the Austrians into thinking his troop was a foraging party, his cavalry burst on the Austrian cavalry before they could <b>climb</b> <b>into</b> their saddles. Seydlitz led his cavalry in an escape, in close column, and was quickly out of sight.|$|E

5|$|The first-ever Queen of the Cage {{match for}} number one contendership to the TNA Women's Knockout Championship was next. The {{participants}} in the encounter were Angelina Love, Christy Hemme, Jackie Moore, Rhaka Khan, Roxxi Laveaux, Salinas, Traci Brooks, and Velvet Sky. In this match, the participants fought {{on the outside of}} the ring to <b>climb</b> <b>into</b> the cage. The first two to do so had a standard wrestling match, with the winner determined by pinfall or submission. It lasted 5 minutes and 30 seconds. Laveaux and Love were the first to enter the cage, with Laveaux gaining the pinfall after her signature Voodoo Drop maneuver to become the first-ever Queen of the Cage and become number one contender to the TNA Women's Knockout Championship.|$|E
5|$|The first {{lifeboat}} launched was Lifeboat 7 on {{the starboard}} side with 28 people on board out of a capacity of 65. It was lowered at around 12:45am as believed by the British Inquiry. Collapsible Boat D was the last lifeboat to be launched, at 2:05. Two more lifeboats, Collapsible Boats A and B, {{were in the process}} of being removed from their location on the roof of the officer's house but could not be properly launched. Collapsible B floated away from the ship upside down, while Collapsible A became half-filled with water after the supports for its canvas sides were broken in the fall from the roof of the officers' quarters. There were arguments in some of the lifeboats about going back to pick up people in the water, but many survivors were afraid of being swamped by people trying to <b>climb</b> <b>into</b> the lifeboat or being pulled down by the suction from the sinking Titanic, though it turned out that there had been very little suction. At 2:20am, Titanic herself sank. A small number of passengers and crew were able to make their way to the two unlaunched collapsible boats, surviving for several hours (some still clinging to the overturned Collapsible B) until they were rescued by Fifth Officer Harold Lowe.|$|E

25|$|Wind {{gradient}} soaring, {{also called}} dynamic soaring, {{is a technique}} used by soaring birds including albatrosses.

Geographically, the Port of Port of Spain is ideal for maritime traffic, providing a natural harbour on Trinidad’s north-western coasts where adverse weather conditions are extremely rare.|$|E
25|$|Stella sank {{in eight}} minutes. Four {{lifeboats}} were successfully launched, while a fifth capsized. The {{women and children}} first protocol was observed, although one stewardess, Mary Ann Rogers, gave up her lifejacket and refused a place in a lifeboat. The capsized lifeboat was later righted by a freak wave and 12 people managed to <b>climb</b> <b>into</b> it. Four of these died of exposure during the night. The eight remaining survivors were rescued by the French Naval tug Marsouin.|$|E

Then, as a {{wildcard}} at Wimbledon, she defeated 11th seed Jelena Dokić, her first win over a top-20 player, to reach the fourth round, where she lost in three sets to Svetlana Kuznetsova.|$|E

25|$|The mating {{habits of}} Limax maximus are {{considered}} unusual among slugs: the hermaphrodite slugs court, usually for hours, by circling and licking each other. After this, the slugs will <b>climb</b> <b>into</b> {{a tree or}} other high area and then, entwined together, lower themselves on a thick string of mucus, evert their white translucent mating organs (penises) from their gonopores (openings {{on the right side}} of the head), entwine these organs, and exchange sperm. Both participants will later lay hundreds of eggs.|$|E
25|$|The highest rankings in the Nielsen {{ratings for}} Lassie were the Martin family years: #24 in 1957, #22 in 1958, #15 in 1959, #15 in 1961, #21 in 1962, #13 in 1963, and #17 in 1964. The only year the show did not <b>climb</b> <b>into</b> the top twenty-five was 1960, when it ran {{opposite}} Walt Disney Presents on ABC and Shirley Temple Theatre on NBC.

25|$|By {{the time}} they got to the beach, Kalaniʻōpuʻu's two {{youngest}} sons, who had been following their father believing they were being invited to visit the ship again with the ruler, began to <b>climb</b> <b>into</b> the boats that were waiting at the shore. Kānekapōlei shouted to them {{to get out of the}} boat and pleaded with her husband to stop. The ruler then realized that Cook and his men were not asking him to visit the ship, but forcing him. At this point he stopped and sat down.|$|E
