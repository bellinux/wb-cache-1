2500|$|Swedish {{uses the}} acute to show {{non-standard}} stress, {{for example in}} [...] (café) and [...] (résumé). This occasionally helps resolve ambiguities, such as ide (hibernation) versus idé (idea). In these words, the acute is not optional. Some proper names use non-standard diacritics, such as Carolina Klüft and Staël von Holstein. For foreign loanwords the original accents are strongly recommended, unless the word has been infused into the language, in which case they are optional. Hence <b>crème</b> <b>fraîche</b> but ampere. [...] Swedish also has the letters å, ä, and ö, but these are considered distinct letters, not a and o with diacritics.|$|E
