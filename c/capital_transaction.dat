40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} was to explore the relationship between social <b>capital,</b> <b>transaction</b> costs, and organizational outcomes. 178 employees at a mid-sized high tech manufacturing plant located in the Southeastern United States completed a survey that assessed self-perceptions of social <b>capital,</b> <b>transaction</b> costs, and organizational outcomes. Multiple stepwise linear regression was used to determine which elements of social capital served as predictors of transaction costs and organizational outcomes. Significant multiple correlations were established between social capital and both transaction costs and organizational outcomes. In particular, trust, strength of ties, accessibility, and timing served as predictors. The results suggest that social capital analysis provides an effective means of making predictions regarding the expenses incurred regarding human interaction and the success that organizations have in achieving important goals and objectives...|$|E

40|$|Ten {{countries}} from {{central and eastern}} Europe currently negotiate their accession to the EU. By {{the end of the}} current decade a number of them will not only have joined the EU but will also have adopted the euro. The range of exchange rate arrangements followed by these countries at the present time covers a broad spectrum from floating to currency board hard pegs. While many of these regimes will (have to) change until the adoption of the euro some countries might opt for a hard peg until the adoption of the euro. In this paper we deal with the policy challenges facing hard pegging candidate countries. We use the Austrian experience of maintaining a fixed peg to the DEM for two decades, of the change-over to the EMS and the ERM, of continuous structural change and of <b>capital</b> <b>transaction</b> liberalization as an example. The Austrian experience also testifies to the compatibility of a fixed peg with a trend real appreciation of the exchange rate that i...|$|E

The estimation result of the short-term equation indicates that the enhancement of direct investment inflow at the last quarter caused the rupiah exchange rate run into appreciation. While the other investment inflow at the last two quarters, direct investment outflow at one or two quarters and portfolio investment outflow at the last quarter caused the rupiah exchange rate run into depreciation. The estimation results of the long-term equation indicates that the enhacement of other investment inflow caused the rupiah exchange rate run into appreciation, portfolio investment outflow and other investment outflow caused the rupiah exchange rate run into depresiation...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The {{world of}} {{international}} economics {{is going through}} difficult and unsettled times due increasing capital flows volatility, especially short-term one. The Asian crisis and the current global crises demonstrate the potential risks associated with unmanaged capital flows. The objective of the paper is to defend the role of capital controls in helping to curb dangerous capital flows, and to buffer the impact of external financial shocks. The experiences of China and India are used to support our views. The paper highlights that the capital controls help to provide short-term monetary policy independence within the impossible trinity and that long-standing capital controls is possible leading to a mid-way path. The International Monetary Funds ’ change of perception vis-à-vis capital controls is presented in detailed. We emphasize the existence of Article VI under which the choice of using capital controls {{has always been a}} right given country members. Despite the potential benefits of further <b>capital</b> <b>transaction</b> liberalization, we conclude that it remains premature to envisage full capital account convertibility for both China and India...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the impact}} of tax sparing agreements on Japanese foreign direct investment (FDI) distribution in developing countries. These agreements are sometimes concluded between a developed country and a developing country which grants fiscal incentives to foreign investors. In that case, the former agrees not to tax its outward investors in order that the host country fiscal advantage is not compensated for by the increase in its own income taxes. Apart from the United States, the majority of developed countries have included these tax sparing provisions in their fiscal bilateral treaties with developing countries. Their impacts are observed {{on the distribution of}} Japanese FDI outflows and average size of <b>capital</b> <b>transaction,</b> on the Japanese firm sales and employment {{as well as on the}} difference between the Japanese and U. S. FDI shares, over the 1989 - 2000 period. The empirical results suggest that each additional year, subsequent to the signature of a tax sparing agreement, increases Japanese FDI activity by 1. 7 - 11 %. These findings are robust to the use of an instrumental variable specification and give empirical support to the debate on the exclusion or not of these provisions under the bilateral tax treaty. Thus, this study confirms that tax sparing agreements can be useful instruments to increase the attractiveness of a developing country. Foreign direct investment, fiscal incentives, tax sparing. ...|$|E
40|$|The Mexican, Asian, and Russian {{crises of}} the mid- and late 1990 s have renewed {{interest}} among policymakers in the determinants {{and effects of}} private capital inflows. This paper analyzes whether policies can affect the composition of capital inflows and whether different compositions aggravate crises. The results support the view that, while fundamentals matter, capital controls can affect the mix of capital inflows that countries receive. The results also show that during the Asian crisis, countries with more yen-denominated debt faired worse, while during the Mexican crisis larger short-term debt stocks increased {{the severity of the}} crisis.

40|$|The lack of {{specific}} tax legislation and practice {{dealing with the}} taxation of derivatives in South Africa necessitates {{the construction of a}} framework for the taxation of derivatives: the subject of this dissertation. The lack of sophistication within the Income Tax Act, No. 58 of 1962 and the lack of clarity provided by the South African Revenue Service with regard to derivatives, specifically in a hedging context, is expected to be overcome to a large degree by virtue of the contents of this dissertation. The dissertation considers the meaning of a derivative and a hedge in a tax context and culminates in the drafting of suggested definitions of a derivative and a hedge to be housed within our tax legislation. The definitions have been constructed from key themes and features extracted from various comparative studies. Given the changes in accounting methodologies and practice of derivative transactions, it is considered that the need, from a tax perspective, is to move closer to the accounting treatment of gains and losses on derivative transactions. The analysis in this dissertation favours this approach in the instance specifically where derivatives are transacted as a hedge of an underlying <b>capital</b> <b>transaction.</b> The purposes for which derivatives are used are finally considered specifically {{in the context of the}} common law doctrine of substance over form. The subjective test of the taxpayer’s mindset plays a major part in balancing the legal form of a transaction and its legal substance. It is hoped that a fresh view on the taxation of derivatives and the construction of this framework provides users of tax legislation with a concise pathway to the tax effect and consequences of their application.
