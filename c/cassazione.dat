25|$|Italian trials {{can last}} many months and have long gaps between {{hearings}} (the first trial of Knox and Sollecito was heard {{two days a}} week, for three weeks a month). If found guilty, a defendant is absolutely guaranteed what is in effect a retrial, where all evidence and witnesses can be re-examined. A verdict can be overturned by the Italian supreme court, the Corte di <b>Cassazione,</b> which considers written briefs. If the Corte di <b>Cassazione</b> overturns a verdict, it explains what legal principles were violated by the lower court, which must abide by the ruling when re-trying the case. If the Corte di <b>Cassazione</b> upholds a guilty verdict of the appeal trial, the conviction becomes definitive, the appeals process is exhausted, and any sentence is served.|$|E

2500|$|Five {{more members}} of the group went to trial in June 2005 and were sentenced to long prison terms in early 2006. Nicola Sapone, leader of the group and the person {{suspected}} as the mastermind behind the killings, received a life sentence. The other four, Paolo Leoni, Marco Zampollo, Eros Monterosso and Elisabetta Ballarin, received sentences between 24 and 26 years for their role in all three murders. On 2007 the Court of Appeal confirmed the life sentence for Sapone and improved the convictions for other three {{members of the}} group: Paolo Leoni passed from 26 years to a life sentence, Marco Zampollo from 26 years to 29 years and 2 months and Eros Monterosso from 24 years to 27 years and 3 months; the sentence for Elisabetta Ballarin was reduced from 24 years and 3 months to 23 years.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{deals with}} the complex and delicate issue of allocation {{of the burden of}} proof of causation in medical liability. The research has followed two lines of investigation, functional between them. First of all, it shows the different jurisprudential approaches to this topic, paying particular attention to the orientation that has prevailed (and summarized in the Corte di <b>Cassazione’s</b> judgement n. 577 / 2008), whilst trying to highlight the conflicts with the general principles of contractual liability. Secondly, a reconstructive proposal has been presented to shoulder a uniform solution in terms of allocating the burden of proof, suitable on one side to overcome the prevailing jurisprudence’s criticality and on the other to recover consistency with the law, and furthermore, with the general principles of allocation of the burden of proof. This study is divided in three parts. The first one, an introduction, offers a survey {{of the state of the}} art of medical liability, with particular consideration to the nature of this liability, in order to identify the relevant legal category (art. 1218 Civil Code) and the reasons that make it systematically consistent on the one hand, and appropriate on the other. In this context, an account of the recent legislative amendment introduced by Decreto Balduzzi has been given. Its reference in the article 2043 of the Civil Code has been interpreted by the prevailing jurisprudence as irrelevant to the nature of medical liability, which therefore, continues to be related to the contractual paradigm. The second part {{deals with the}} analysis of the responses offered by doctrine and jurisprudence to the specific problem of allocating the burden of proof of a causal link between the damage alleged by the patient and doctor’s non-fulfilment. In particular the traditional approach and the one anointed by Cass., sez. un., n. 577 / 2008 («it is sufficient that the patient adduces a qualified non-fulfilment, or theoretically apt to produce the damage») were compared. The orientation introduced by this judgment has been analysed in detail: in particular, the impact of this new case-law with the current law. Assumed the principle of proof’s proximity, the question asked was how this principle can be placed in our system and what are its relations with law. The third part of the research wants to be a reconstructive hypothesis. First of all, the reasons that justify the existence of a crossroads of applied solutions as numerous as different from each other has been researched. The cause was identified in the peculiar features that characterize the health-care obligation. These characters were found: in the object, consisting in the activity adequate not in meeting the ultimate interest of the patient (healing), but the intermediate interest (performance’s accuracy) only teleologically directed to that aim (the reference is to the traditional distinction between means and result obligations); in the peculiar structure of the damage, which due to its similarity, in some ways, to the damage in tort law, has led the jurisprudence, and the doctrine, to borrow the distinction between natural and legal causation, creating many problems of coordination; and last in the hybrid nature of the required behaviour of the debtor, consisting of a "performance" and/or "protection" duty. It is through the analysis of these unique profiles, their "variables", and the relationship between them and the current law, that it seemed possible to reach the formulation of a clear answer, suitable as a general solution to the problem relating to the allocation of the burden of proof: the restoration of the rule which places the burden of proof on causation to the patient. The role of «loss of chance» damage and hypothesis of a liability’s apportionment have also been taken into consideration with the caveat, however, these are institutions capable of influencing not the an of causation’s proof but only the quantum, which remains therefore set on the patient. Finally, act of plausible need for adjustments or corrections to the current law has been acknowledged. Such are likely to meet the perceived needs of social nature related to the particular quality of the interest, which embodies the doctor-patient relationship, as well as the natural asymmetry between the positions of the parties. However, on the assumption of no possibility for a path-oriented jurisprudence in this direction, forcing the inevitable penalty of the law, a prospect legislative guide (de iure condendo) has opened, taking the health care liability reform recently implemented in Germany as exampl...|$|R
