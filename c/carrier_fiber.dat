In this paper, the environmental aspects of fiber crops cultivation and use are reviewed. The analysis was based on the following categories: use of resources, emission of gases, effects on the quality of soil and water and biological and landscape diversity. As bioenergy and biomaterials <b>carriers,</b> <b>fiber</b> crops offer ecological advantages over conventional ones by contributing to carbon sequestration and energy savings, and to the reduction of greenhouse gases and non-renewable resources. However, other environmental outcomes, such as acidifying and eutrophication emissions, may limit the conversion and use of fiber crops. Even so, the low input requirements associated with this class of crops and its phytoremediation aptness for wastewaters or contaminated land, are some of the environmental advantages associated with fiber crops. Crop management options and processing choices can influence the outcomes, but site specific factors should be accurately assessed to evaluate the adequacy between crop and location.

Cellulosic fibers as hydrophilic and biocompatible, nontoxic and eco-friendly make a good polymer matrix for obtaining biologically active fibers. Current investigations in this area show that the features of these fibers depend {{on the type of}} carrier as well as the drug structure. Loading drugs on the <b>fiber</b> <b>carrier</b> is accomplished by ionic bonding between ionized drugs and the groups fixed on the fiber (by ion exchange) or loosely adsorption on the fiber through hydrophobic interactions. These interactions can be achieved between hydrophobic parts of the drug and the <b>fiber</b> <b>carrier</b> or among the hydrophobic drugs bonded on the fiber. Prevailing mechanism of ionized drug bonding on the carrier is ionic, although different hydrophobic interactions can contribute the drug loading to varying degrees. In this paper oxidized cellulose (OC) with different carboxylic group content is obtained by selective oxidation and used for chemical bonding of antibiotic ceftazidime. In its structure this antibiotic has aminothiazole ring and pyridine ring in the side chains of cephem nucleus. Ceftazidime has two carboxylic groups and also great number of electron donors and acceptors. Due to these groups and structures ceftazidime is able to form multiple chemical bonds i. e. interactions with oxidized cellulosic bandage. The bonding was performed in antibiotic water solution concentration of c= 3, 4 â 10 - 3 mol/L at room temperature (22 Â± 1 Â°C), while desorption was performed in physiological solution. The amounts of bonded and released antibiotic were determined spectrophotometrically in UV range.

One important {{application of the}} spectral disperser is {{in the area of}} wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) fiber communication. Current WDM is operated at channel spacing of tens of GHz (standard is 50 GHz or 100 GHz), which is referred as dense WDM (DWDM). Hyperfine WDM (HWDM) has been proposed by the industry to utilize the optical communication band more efficiently at channel spacing of several GHz. Such a narrow channel spacing is a big challenge for DWDM wavelength demultiplexers. In experiment using a solid VIPA at a 50 GHz free spectral range (FSR) and a single mode fiber array with eight ports, we have implemented an eight-channel hyperfine wavelength demultiplexer at 1. 55 um, and we obtain a channel spacing around 3 GHz, more than or equal to 23 dB adjacent channel isolations and more than or equal to 30 dB nonadjacent channel isolations. Firstly, using the eight-channel wavelength demultiplexer, we test data detection at 622 Mbps (OC- 12) in a HWDM system configuration. The single channel filtering effects as well as the adjacent channel crosstalk are studied in detail. ^ DWDM transmitter consists of multiple laser diode array sources, which have a stable range of several GHz. The DWDM transmitter can 2 Ì 7 t be used in HWDM as HWDM system requires highly stable channel sources. Here, we demonstrate a novel HWDM transmitter via sub-carrier multiplexing (SCM), where multiple RF/microwave sub-carriers are modulated on to an optical <b>carrier</b> for <b>fiber</b> transmission. For the first time to our knowledge, we demonstrate a 4 -user, around 3 GHz-spaced hybrid SCM-HWDM system on a 50 -km fiber link, in which the SCM is used to generate closely spaced channels in the transmitter, while a hyperfine wavelength demultiplexer is used at the receiver to separate the sub-carrier channels for optical direct detection. A hyperfine blocking filter is employed in the transmitter to realize optical single sideband (O-SSB) modulation with strong carrier suppression. This work is the first demonstration of a multiple-user HWDM system at the narrowest channel spacing around 3 GHz. ...|$|R
40|$|Typically, {{continuous}} filament composite components are fabricated using a filament winding technique. In this operation, fibers {{are introduced to}} a rotating mandrel while a guide holding the material traverses {{back and forth to}} place the material in a helical pattern over the surface of the mandrel. This procedure is continued until complete coverage is obtained. An alternative method for fabricating {{continuous filament}} composite components is braiding. In the braiding operation a mandrel is traversed {{through the center of the}} braider while 144 strands of material traverse around a carrier ring. As the fibers are applied to a mandrel surface, 72 <b>carriers</b> holding the <b>fibers</b> travel clockwise, while another 72 carriers travel counterclockwise to interlock fibers. An additional 72 carriers located on the back of the braider introduce longitudinal fibers to the composite giving the composite lateral strength. The goal of using the braider is to reduce production time by simultaneously applying 144 strands of material onto a mandrel as opposed to the four-strand wrapping most filament winding techniques offer. Benefits to braiding include the ability to (1) introduce longitudinal fibers to the composite structure; (2) fabricate non-symmetric components without using complex functions to produce full coverage; and (3) produce a component with a higher degree of damage tolerance due to the interlocking of fibers. The fabrication of bore evacuator chambers for a tank cannon system is investigated by utilizing a 144 carrier braiding machine, an industrial robot, and a resin applicator system...|$|R
40|$|Polyethylene glycol is a synthetic, biodegradable, and {{water-soluble}} polyether. Owing to {{its good}} biological and material properties, polyethylene glycol shows promise in spinal cord tissue engineering applications. Although {{studies have examined}} repairing spinal cord injury with polyethylene glycol, these compelling findings have not been recently reviewed or evaluated as a whole. Thus, we herein review and summarize the findings of studies conducted both within and beyond China that have examined the repair of spinal cord injury using polyethylene glycol. The following summarizes the results of studies using polyethylene glycol alone as well as coupled with polymers or hydrogels: (1) polyethylene glycol as an adjustable biomolecule <b>carrier</b> resists nerve <b>fiber</b> degeneration, reduces the inflammatory response, inhibits vacuole and scar formation, and protects nerve membranes in the acute stage of spinal cord injury. (2) Polyethylene glycol-coupled polymers not only promote angiogenesis but also carry drugs or bioactive molecules to the injury site. Because such polymers cross both the blood-spinal cord and blood-brain barriers, they {{have been widely used}} as drug carriers. (3) Polyethylene glycol hydrogels have been used as supporting substrates for the growth of stem cells after injury, inducing cell migration, proliferation, and differentiation. Simultaneously, polyethylene glycol hydrogels isolate or reduce local glial scar invasion, promote and guide axonal regeneration, cross the transplanted area, and re-establish synaptic connections with target tissue, thereby promoting spinal cord repair. On the basis of the reviewed studies, we conclude that polyethylene glycol is a promising synthetic material for use in the repair of spinal cord injur...|$|R
