The crude oil is predicted will diminish within twenty years, therefore vegetable or animal oils are promisingly resource for the production of biodiesel. In the research, biodiesel was produced using CaO as heterogeneous catalyst through transesterification process. The heterogeneous catalyst had more advantages than the homogeneous one since it was not corrosive to metal and polluted to biodiesel and glycerol being produced. The heterogeneous catalyst was easily separated from the liquid product and it could be designed to possess higher activity and selectivity, as well as, longer lifetime. The aim of the research was to determine the optimum operating condition of the transesterification of <b>coconut</b> <b>palm</b> <b>oil</b> and methanol using CaO as the heterogeneous catalyst to produce biodiesel as main product and glycerol as by product.

Spirulina sp is a kind of cyanobacteria contains high protein and a potential product for animal feed. This research purpose is to find optimum saving synthetic nutrient of Spirulina sp cultivated in POMED and to find optimum POMED concentration used for algae cultivation. Research was done in two steps. First step, Spirulina sp was cultivated in 20 % POMED concentration with different saving nutrient (0 %, 20 %, 50 %, 70 %, and 90 %).
