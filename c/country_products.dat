5000|$|The city of Naucalpan is {{actually}} {{larger than the}} municipality itself, with part of it extending into neighboring Huixquilucan Municipality. At the 2010 census its total population was 913,681 inhabitants, with 792,211 of these in Naucalpan Municipality and 121,470 in Huixquilucan Municipality. Since cities, or localities, have no separate government, the two parts are governed from their respective municipalities. Within Naucalpan Municipality only the Los Remedios National Park and several ejidos remaining mostly unurbanized. Over 95% of the municipality’s population lives in the city proper. The municipality consists of 119 neighborhoods in the city proper, 18 small villages, 71 residential developments and two rural housing developments. [...] Because {{of the growth of}} its industry, Naucalpan {{is one of the most}} important municipalities in the <b>country.</b> <b>Products</b> manufactured here include foodstuffs, drinks, tobacco, clothing and textiles, wood products and paper, metals and chemicals. Industrial parks include Alce Blanco, Atoto, Industrial Naucalpan, La Perla and Tlatilco.The municipality is part of Greater Mexico City and in the Valley of Mexico, sharing the air quality and other environmental problems that are prevalent in this region. Naucalpan already participates in the “Hoy No Circula” program, which restricts the use of private automobiles in Mexico City and some adjoining areas during the week and is considering extending restrictions to Saturdays as well. Its subsoil is considered to be gravely polluted, mostly due to the Bordo Poniento landfill and the sinking of the subsoil due to the over pumping of groundwater and the dumping of untreated wastewater. In addition, many small businesses such as brick making operations, public restrooms and restaurants flagrantly violate sanitation and environmental laws. However, automobiles account for 70% of the air pollution. [...] Stronger enivironmental regulations have been enacted and enforced, but this has led to the abandonment of the municipality by larger industries who have relocated to the north and west. Over 200 companies have relocated from here and neighboring municipalities Tlalnepantla and Ecatepec. Industries which have left Naucalpan include metals, cement, glass-works and others that use a large quantity of energy. About twenty percent of manufacturing facilities have closed their doors and six industrial parks are empty. In addition to environmental regulation, other actors behind this rising land and rental prices, economic slowdown and competition from Asia. Several major roadways pass through the city and municipality, which connect the Mexico City area to parts north and west, as well as other parts of the metropolitan area. The northern section of the Anillo Periférico passes through Ciudad Satélite. There have been plans to add a second level to this roadway, but local residents have been working against it. One of the concerns is that the new roadway will damage the nearby Torres de Satélite. [...] The recently built Viaducto Bicentenario highway, linking Mexico City with western Mexico State passes through Naucalpan and was the first section to begin operations. This section connects the Lomas Verdes section with Cuatro Caminos at the border of Mexico City. [...] The construction of these roadways is projected to make changes in the urban landscape of the city, attracting projects such as office buildings and commercial centers. A number of projects are already in the works. The goal is to build areas here similar to Santa Fe and Interlomas. [...] Naucalpan is strongly dependent on cars and other motorized transportation. Efforts have been made to promote bicycle use such as bike paths and free bicycle loans, but they have not been successful.|$|E

40|$|This thesis investigates ethnocentric {{behaviour}} (i. e. favouritism {{for home}} <b>country</b> <b>products)</b> among consumers who had migrated {{to a foreign}} country and those living in their home country. The work was underpinned by two key theories, namely, ethnocentricity (Shimp and Sharma, 1987) and acculturation (Berry, 1980; 1997), and {{is the first time}} these constructs are united in an academic study to investigate the willingness-to-purchase home <b>country</b> <b>products</b> over time. Based on quantitative research, and a survey design, three empirical studies were undertaken to investigate Malaysian consumers residing in UK and Malaysia. Study 1, a pilot testing exercise, assessed the reliability of the measurement scales. Study 2 took place in Malaysia and uncovered the levels of ethnocentrism present in the home country consumers. Study 3 was carried out in the UK to investigate the behaviours of acculturating Malaysian migrants. A total of 958 responses were obtained and subjected to data analysis involving a series of techniques including factor analysis, F-test, Mest and structural equation modelling. The results revealed {{a significant difference in the}} levels of consumer ethnocentrism between the home country and the acculturating samples. As hypothesised, the latter group was less ethnocentric than the former. Analyses revealed a negative relationship between length of residence in the UK and consumer ethnocentrism. Hence, respondents with a longer stay in the UK tended to be less ethnocentric than those with a shorter period of stay. Analysis demonstrated a positive relationship between acculturation and consumer ethnocentrism. This thesis makes significant contributions to knowledge at a theoretical and methodological level. At an applied level, this work also provides significant inputs into marketing and retail management and the development of public policy.

30|$|Airports are {{the most}} {{important}} country frontiers to be protected because infectious agents can reach destinations and disseminate very quickly and they are strategic areas for national veterinary surveillance. This is because infectious agents can be transported in food of animal origin, especially those without health certificates and these can be detected in international baggage (Taniguchi et al. 2008 Chaber et al. 2010) using X-ray scanners. Airborne, food-borne, vector-borne, and zoonotic infectious diseases transmitted during commercial air travel became an important public health issue due to the greater affordability of air travel, increasing the mobility of people (Mangili and Gendreau 2005). To minimize the risk of these diseases entering a <b>country,</b> <b>products</b> of animal origin need to be accompanied by an international health certificate. This is crucial to assure a reliable health situation when countries with known health status are involved, as regulated by the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) for its member countries (Pastoret and Chaisemartin 2011).|$|E

40|$|Proceeding {{from the}} {{assumption}} that the domain of food and food-related broader issues of relationship to nutrition are of the key importance {{for the development of a}} culture, the relationship of the Serbian society to food/nutrition was thematised through an internet discussion broached by the Miguel Rodriguez’s interview to the daily ’Politika’ - ’The Serbs are not a poor nation’. Since the discussion raised the question of food/nutrition as the sole measurement of development, the text examines the revealed local tensions and discomforts arising from the relationship to agriculture, the country and <b>country</b> <b>products</b> in the context of the question of Serbian development, as well as in the context of a proper public presentation of Serbia. The unveiling of the complexity of this relationship was approached from the perspective of the conceptual-analytical concept of cultural intimacy introduced by the American anthropologist Michael Herzfeld, and discourse analysis. The conclusion is that, on account of the variety of ’appetites’ of the contemporary man, development of society cannot be measured solely by the level of access to sources of food; nevertheless, this assessment acknowledges that the key importance of food and relationship to food/ nutrition cannot be neglected, even if we wanted to.

40|$|In a {{high-tech}} <b>country</b> <b>products</b> are becoming rapidly more complex. To manage {{the development process}} {{as well as to}} encounter unforeseen challenges, the understanding and thus the explicit modeling of organizational workflows is more important than ever. However, available tools to support this work, in most cases force a new notation upon the company or cannot be adapted to a given publication layout in a reasonable amount of time. Additionally, collaboration among colleagues as well as different business units is complicated and less supported. Since it is of vital importance for a company to be able to change its processes fast and adapt itself to new market situations, the need for tools supporting this evolution is equally crucial. In this paper we present a domain specific language (DSL) developed for modeling a company's workflows. Furthermore, the DSL is embedded in a web-based editor providing transparent access using modern web 2. 0 technologies. Results of the DSL's as well as the editor's application to document, model, and improve selected workflows of a German automotive manufacturer are presented.

40|$|Concerns that (1) {{growth in}} {{developing}} countries could worsen the US terms of trade and (2) that increased US trade with developing countries will increase US wage inequality both implicitly reflect the assumption that goods produced in the United States and developing countries are close substitutes and that specialization is incomplete. In this paper we show on the contrary that there are distinctive patterns of international specialization and that developed and developing countries export fundamentally different products, especially those classified as high tech. Judged by export shares, the United States and developing countries specialize in quite different product categories that, for the most part, do not overlap. Moreover, even when exports are classified in the same category, there are large and systematic differences in unit values that suggest the products made by developed and developing countries are not very close substitutes—developed <b>country</b> <b>products</b> are far more sophisticated. This generalization is already recognized in the literature {{but it does not}} hold for all types of products. Export unit values of developed and developing countries of primary commodity–intensive products are typically quite similar. Unit values of standardized (low-tech) manufactured products exported by developed and developing countries are somewhat similar. By contrast, the medium- and high-tech manufactured exports of developed and developing countries differ greatly. This finding has important implications.

40|$|The United States {{has often}} been criticized for {{protectionist}} measures taken against developing <b>country</b> <b>products.</b> Yet, average agricultural protection has reemained practically nil in the U. S. over time, while rising in the European Common Market (E. C. M) and, even more, Japan. It further appears that manufactured imports from developing countries have increased much more rapidly, and reached higher levels, in the U. S. than in the E. C. M and, in particular, Japan. The U. S. -Japan comparisons for manufactured goods {{do not conform to}} the data on the extent of nontariff barriers, as measured by the share of imports from the developing countries which are subject to such trade barriers. The solution to the puzzle lies in part in the inadequacies of data on the share of imports subject to nontariff measures for gauging the protective effects of such measures and in part in the reliance on formal measures of protection in the United States as against the informal measures in Japan. More generally, one may explain the results obtained by reference to the openness of the U. S. market that has generally been more hospitable to imports from developing countries than have the markets of other industrial countries, particularly Japan.

40|$|This article raises certain {{legal and}} policy issues {{arising from the}} use of {{labelling}} for environmental purposes (eco-labels) in international trade, and the implications for market access, particularly for developing <b>country</b> <b>products.</b> Of particular interest are transparency issues relating to the design and implementation of voluntary eco-labelling schemes; the criteria used in the design of eco-labels which increasingly reflects the life cycle of products; and the WTO treatment of eco-labelling. Eco-labelling was identified as a significant area in Agenda 21 (1992) and in Doha Declaration (2001). More recently, the Johannesburg Plan of Implementation (WSSD, 2002) recognises the importance of consumer information related to sustainable consumption and explicitly noted the need to continue work in this area. The financial cost of eco-labelling could be quite high. At the same time, eco-labelling is seen by some as an important element for gaining access to ‘green’ markets. Eco-labels may potentially enhance the terms of trade of those developing countries able to accurately translate the mood of industrialised country consumers into environmentally friendly product development. There are also hopes that eco-labelling could provide new opportunities for attracting capital investment and joint ventures in developing countries, such as Bangladesh. As a least developed country with a big emerging market, Bangladesh needs to {{have a better understanding of}} issues of eco-labelling. Therefore, this paper discusses the challenges and opportunities eco-labelling may create for Bangladesh. ...|$|E
