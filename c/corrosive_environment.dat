5|$|Off {{the coast}} of Fort Lauderdale is the Osborne Reef, an {{artificial}} reef made of discarded tires that {{has proven to be}} an ecological disaster. The dumping began in the 1960s, with the intent to provide habitat for fish while disposing of trash from the land. However, in the rugged and <b>corrosive</b> <b>environment</b> of the ocean, nylon straps used to secure the tires wore out, cables rusted, and tires broke free. The tires posed a particular threat after breaking free from their restraints. The tires then migrated shoreward and ran into a living reef tract, washed up on its slope and killed many things in their path. In recent years, thousands of tires have also washed up on nearby beaches, especially during hurricanes. Local authorities are now working to remove the 700,000 tires, in cooperation with the U.S. Army, Navy and Coast Guard.|$|E

[...] Modern production methods produce Cl2 and NaOH/KOH from the electrolysis of brine using a Nafion membrane between half-cells.

[...] The disadvantages of these systems is worker safety and environmental concerns associated with mercury and asbestos, although economical factors also played a part. [...] Nafion was the direct result of the chlor-alkali industry addressing these concerns; Nafion could tolerate the high temperatures, high electrical currents, and <b>corrosive</b> <b>environment</b> of the electrolytic cells.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{superplasticizer}} is {{very useful}} to reduce mixing water in fresh concrete, {{which results in}} the enhancement of watertightness and strength of hardened concrete. But it has a limit of not preventing steel bar embedded in concrete from corrosion under critical <b>corrosive</b> <b>environments.</b> Thus, this study aims at developing a nano hybrid agent chemically combining PCA admixture with anionic charge of clay. As results of concrete tests using general PCA superplasticizer and new one developed, {{it can be found}} that new plasticizer has higher performance in terms of time-dependent slump and air content loss, compressive strength, and anti-corrosion. It is expected for new superplasticizer, called the PCA-HT NHA, to be applicable to concrete under severe <b>corrosive</b> <b>environments...</b>|$|R

"The triple {{situation}} of disbondment of the (corrosion) coating, the dielectric {{nature of the}} coating and the unique electrochemical environment established under the exterior coating, which acts as a shield to the electrical CP current, {{is referred to as}} CP shielding. The combination of tenting and disbondment permits a <b>corrosive</b> <b>environment</b> around the outside of the pipe to enter into the void between the exterior coating and the pipe surface. With the development of this CP shielding phenomenon, impressed current from the CP system cannot access exposed metal under the exterior coating to protect the pipe surface from the consequences of an aggressive <b>corrosive</b> <b>environment.</b> The CP shielding phenomenon induces changes in the potential gradient of the CP system across the exterior coating, which are further pronounced in areas of insufficient or sub-standard CP current emanating from the pipeline's CP system. This produces an area on the pipeline of insufficient CP defense against metal loss aggravated by an exterior corrosive environment." ...|$|E
