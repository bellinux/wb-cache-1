(2003) found that {{bell pepper and}} black peppers possess anti-mutagenic activity. They further stated that both are capable of inhibiting carcinogen activation, improving the detoxification of carcinogens by scavenging the reactive agents that damage DNA. They revealed that black pepper show antimutagenic effect due to inhibition of certain mutagen formation and their direct interaction with electrophilic species (Hamssa et al. 2003). Parveen and Shadab (2012) studied antioxidant activity of spices and found that Nigella sativa effectively controls the number of chromosome aberrations induced by chlorambucil (CLB). They further revealed that N. sativa’s anti carcinogenic activity inhibits DNA damage but it cannot completely protect cells from damage (Parveen and Shadab 2012). These findings provide evidence to the results reported in this document that N. sativa helps to prevent DNA damage.|$|E

40|$|Non-wood forest {{products}} (NWFPs) {{are one of}} the major sources of food and income for rural populations in Tanzania. A survey was conducted to assess the economic importance of non-wood {{forest products}} in the study area. The study was carried out in two villages; Shebomeza and Mkwakwani in Muheza and Korogwe districts, from 12 th to 25 th July, 2013. A structured questionnaire was used to gather data from the respondents. A total of sixty-four respondents were chosen based on their involvement in NWFP practices. The most important NWFPs are fodder, honey, beeswax, cloves, <b>cinnamon,</b> nuts, <b>fruits,</b> medicinal plants and aromatic herbs. There was statistical significance in household income difference of respondents from the two villages and in respondents with different farm sizes. No statistically significant differences were found due to income differences of respondents with different age classes and respondents with respect to different number of livestock. This study also analyzed the most important NWFPs in the study area, the frequency of collection, purpose for collection and income generating potential. Factors affecting peoples’ perception of the economic importance of NWFPs have been discussed as well as their impact on consumption and income generation. Opportunities and constraints within the supply chain have been identified and suggestions have been put forward on how local community can easily utilize the supply chain for their benefit...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: This review {{will discuss}} recent {{progress}} in the chemistry of secondary polyphenols produced during food processing. The production mechanism of the secondary polyphenols in black tea, whisky, <b>cinnamon,</b> and persimmon <b>fruits</b> will be introduced. In the process of black tea production, tea leaf catechins are enzymatically oxidized to yield a complex mixture of oxidation products, including theaflavins and thearubigins. Despite {{the importance of the}} beverage, most of the chemical constituents have not yet been confirmed due to the complexity of the mixture. However, the reaction mechanisms at the initial stages of catechin oxidation are explained by simple quinone–phenol coupling reactions. In vitro model experiments indicated the presence of interesting regio- and stereoselective reactions. Recent results on the reaction mechanisms will be introduced. During the aging of whisky in oak wood barrels, ellagitannins originating from oak wood are oxidized an...|$|R
40|$|Organic wines {{produced}} by using organically cultivated grapes were evaluated using multivariate analysis and profiled by quantitative descriptive analysis. Trained judges rated {{the intensity of}} aroma and flavour descriptors. The statistical evaluation of the data demonstrated the close relation between Merlot and Cabernet sauvignon wines, considering their aroma descriptors and between Merlot and Carignan {{taking into account the}} taste descriptors. Significant differences among white wines were determined for sweet and bitter attributes and among red wines for sour, sweet, bitter, and astringency descriptors. The results of wine aroma characteristics demonstrated the following major descriptors for each wine type: metallic (Columbard); grape juice, wet wood, vine leaf (Semillon); burned wood (Grenache); dust, sour cherry, tobacco, yeast (Cabernet sauvignon); cork, unripe <b>fruit,</b> <b>cinnamon</b> (Carignan); grape molasses, dry plum (Merlot). Flavor profile of organic wines revealed specific descriptors for each wine type, namely raisin (Columbard); alcohol, rose, vine leaf, sulphur (Semillon); clove, salty (Grenache); flower, sour cherry, melon, cornelian cherry (Cabernet sauvignon), dry plum (Carignan, Merlot) ...|$|R

40|$|Objective: To {{measure the}} acidity of commercially {{available}} candies. Material and Methods: Tic Tac ® candies {{with the following}} flavors were selected: mint, orange, extra-strong, <b>cinnamon,</b> strawberry, cherry/passion <b>fruit,</b> acquired in supermarkets. Candies were triturated and from the resulting powder, 3 samples of 5 grams were separated and dissolved in 10 ml of doubly deionized water. This process has allowed reading pH in triplicate, measured {{with the aid of}} an in vitro combined potentiometer and electrode, previously gauged with pH 4 and 7 with standard solutions before reading. In candies with pH values under 5. 5. pH, tritatable acidity was verified. Three 15 -gram candy powder samples were separately dissolved in 30 ml of doubly deionized water. In this solution, aliquots of 100 μl 1 N NaOH were added to reach pH 5. 5. Mineral water was used as control. The results were submitted to Analysis of Variance (ANOVA). The comparisons of means were carried out by the Tukey test at 5 % significance level (p< 0. 05).

During the aging of whisky in oak wood barrels, ellagitannins originating from oak wood are oxidized and react with ethanol to give characteristic secondary ellagitannins. The major part of the cinnamon procyanidins is polymerized by copolymerization with cinnamaldehyde. In addition, anthocyanidin structural units are generated in the polymer molecules by oxidation which accounts for the reddish coloration of the cinnamon extract. This reaction is related to the insolubilization of proanthocyanidins in persimmon fruits by condensation with acetaldehyde. In addition to oxidation, the reaction of polyphenols with aldehydes may be important in food processing...|$|R
40|$|The chitosan-based coating with {{antimicrobial}} agent {{has been developed}} recently to control the decay of fruits. However, its fresh keeping and antimicrobial mechanism is still not very clear. The preservation mechanism of chitosan coating with <b>cinnamon</b> oil for <b>fruits</b> storage is investigated in this paper. Results in the atomic force microscopy sensor images show that many micropores exist in the chitosan coating film. The roughness of coating film {{is affected by the}} concentration of chitosan. The antifungal activity of cinnamon oil should be mainly due to its main consistent trans-cinnamaldehyde, which is proportional to the trans-cinnamaldehyde concentration and improves with increasing the attachment time of oil. The exosmosis ratios of Penicillium citrinum and Aspergillus flavus could be enhanced by increasing the concentration of cinnamon oil. Morphological observation indicates that, compared to the normal cell, the wizened mycelium of A. flavus is observed around the inhibition zone, and the growth of spores is also inhibited. Moreover, the analysis of gas sensors indicate that the chitosan-oil coating could decrease the level of O 2 and increase the level of CO 2 in the package of cherry fruits, which also control the fruit decay. These results indicate that its preservation mechanism might be partly due to the micropores structure of coating film as a barrier for gas and a carrier for oil, and partly due to the activity of cinnamon oil on the cell disruption...|$|R
