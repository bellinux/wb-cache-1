The first one, resurrected and elaborated by the grandmaster Pavel Blatny, is to exchange the Bb4 for the Bf4. This {{can be achieved}} via 10...Ng6 11.Bg3 (11.Bxc7?? d6 loses a piece) 11...Bd6 12.Bxd6 Qxd6. White still has possibilities to play for an advantage due to his more advanced development, his space advantage on the queenside and the possibility to install his knight on the good square d5. Taylor considers this Black's best line, stating that Black has not given White the bishop pair, nor weakened his pawn structure, and {{should be able to}} gradually equalize.|$|E

25|$|This {{method of}} {{detecting}} binaries {{is also used}} to locate extrasolar planets orbiting a star. However, the requirements to perform this measurement are very exacting, due to the great difference in the mass ratio, and the typically long period of the planet's orbit. Detection of position shifts of a star is a very exacting science, {{and it is difficult to}} achieve the necessary precision.

25|$|Oil spills at sea are {{generally}} much more damaging {{than those on}} land, since they can spread for hundreds of nautical miles in a thin oil slick which can cover beaches with a thin coating of oil. These can kill seabirds, mammals, shellfish and other organisms they coat. Oil spills on land are more readily containable if a makeshift earth dam can be rapidly bulldozed around the spill site before most of the oil escapes, and land animals <b>can</b> <b>avoid</b> <b>the</b> oil more easily.|$|E
25|$|This version's major {{difference}} is Brainiac's role in Krypton's destruction. Brainiac {{is portrayed as}} the supercomputer that monitors Krypton and advises the planetary council on scientific matters. He senses the imminent destruction of the planet, but denies it so he <b>can</b> <b>avoid</b> <b>the</b> council's order to organize the planet's evacuation and instead focus on saving himself. Brainiac reasons {{that the loss of}} the planet itself and all its living inhabitants is part of the natural order, but his own survival would ensure the preservation of Krypton's history and achievements. Because he goes against Brainiac and the Kryptonian Council, Jor-El becomes an outlaw in their eyes as he works to save his son. After the destruction of Krypton and Kal-El's arrival on Earth, Brainiac eventually becomes an enemy of Superman.|$|E

25|$|Central to {{the success}} of this is the ability of the human body, unlike that of the animals they hunt, to {{effectively}} remove muscle heat waste. In most animals, this is stored by allowing a temporary increase in body temperature. This allows them to escape from animals that quickly speed after them for a short duration (the way nearly all predators catch their prey). Humans, unlike other animals that catch prey, remove heat with a specialized thermoregulation based on sweat evaporation. One gram of sweat can remove 2,598 J of heat energy. Another mechanism is increased skin blood flow during exercise that allows for greater convective heat loss that is aided by our upright posture. This skin based cooling has resulted in humans acquiring an increased number of sweat glands, combined with a lack of body fur that would otherwise stop air circulation and efficient evaporation. Because humans can remove exercise heat, they <b>can</b> <b>avoid</b> <b>the</b> fatigue from heat exhaustion that affects animals chased in a persistent manner, and so eventually catch them.|$|E
25|$|Proper {{choice of}} plasmatic metal nano-particles {{is crucial for}} the maximum light {{absorption}} in the active layer. Front surface located nano-particles Ag and Au are {{the most widely used}} materials due to their surface plasmon resonances located in the visible range and therefore interact more strongly with the peak solar intensity. However, such noble metal nano-particles always introduce reduced light coupling into Si at the short wavelengths below the surface plasmon resonance due to the detrimental Fano effect, i.e. the destructive interference between the scattered and unscattered light. Moreover, the noble metal nano-particles are impractical to implement for large-scale solar cell manufacture due to their high cost and scarcity in the earth's crust. Recently, Zhang et al. have demonstrated the low cost and earth abundant materials Al nano-particles to be able to outperform the widely used Ag and Au nano-particles. Al nano-particles, with their surface plasmon resonances located in the UV region below the desired solar spectrum edge at 300nm, <b>can</b> <b>avoid</b> <b>the</b> reduction and introduce extra enhancement in the shorter wavelength range.|$|E
500|$|The Saxbe fix , or salary rollback, is a {{mechanism}} by which the President of the United States, in appointing a current or {{former member of the}} United States Congress whose elected term has not yet expired, <b>can</b> <b>avoid</b> <b>the</b> restriction of the United States Constitution's Ineligibility Clause. That clause prohibits the President from appointing a current or former member of Congress to a civil office position that was created, or to a civil office position for which the pay or benefits (collectively, [...] "emoluments") were increased, during the term for which that member was elected until the term has expired. The rollback, first implemented by an Act of Congress in 1909, reverts the emoluments of the office to the amount they were when that member began his or her elected term.|$|E

500|$|When Black {{opts for}} 10...Bxd2, {{he runs the}} risk to end up a tempo down over the 7.a3 {{variation}} and to be soon unable to meet White's positional threats on the queenside. White <b>can</b> <b>avoid</b> <b>the</b> push a2–a3 and continue with the standard plans of the 7.a3 variation. However, everything is not that bad for Black. First, to implement his plan White has to concentrate on development (9.Be2, 10.0-0) before he turns {{his attention to the}} queenside. That means Black has more time to organise his play than in the 7.a3 variation, notably to attempt a blockade of the c5-square. Moreover, as White does not put immediate pressure on Black's position, Black is not compelled to castle rapidly and he can keep his king in the centre for a longer time, or even castle queenside. Hence Lalic note that [...] "White has not wasted time with a2–a3, but in fact it is not so easy to capitalise on this extra tempo." ...|$|E
500|$|Nadine Ross first {{appears in}} [...] She is voiced and motion-captured by Laura Bailey. During {{the events of}} A Thief's End, she {{is the leader of}} a private {{military}} company called Shoreline, and forms a partnership with Rafe Adler in finding Henry Avery's lost treasure. They attempt to buy a St. Dismas Cross at an auction in Italy, where she sees Victor Sullivan, whom she is acquainted with. When they fail to acquire the cross due to Nathan Drake cutting off the power, Ross confronts him elsewhere and the two briefly fight, but Nathan escapes with the cross. Adler hacks into Nathan and Sam's phones, using their GPS to track them to Madagascar. Along the way, Ross slowly loses patience with Adler, citing the loss of her men for something that they may not find, and numerous times advocates for Adler to kill Nathan and Sam, which he refuses to do. In the game's climax, Ross and Adler succeed in pillaging a portion of Avery's treasure and is content with leaving afterwards, unwilling to risk falling into Avery's traps aboard the ship and even ready to let Sam and Nathan keep the rest if they <b>can</b> <b>avoid</b> <b>the</b> traps, though Adler coerces her into aiding him by turning her men against her. Aboard the ship, however, a trap is sprung by Sam himself and the ship begins to sink. Finally fed up of Adler's greed and grudges, Ross betrays Adler and at gunpoint abandons him to die aboard the ship with Nathan and Sam while she escapes with the rest of her men.|$|E
500|$|The double {{burden is}} usually {{view as a}} primary problem for single women or married women. However, it is often less {{recognized}} that men can and often do {{go through the same}} trials and hard times as a parent trying to balance work and the family. Within the book The Canadian Family in Crisis, Conway addresses this issue with an argument from Eichler. Eichler says, [...] "Social science fails to understand men" [...] by tending [...] "to downplay or ignore a potential conflict between work and home for men." [...] Married men <b>can</b> <b>avoid</b> <b>the</b> full impact of the double burden, but single fathers are totally incapable of avoiding the double burden of family and work. Though single fathers face the same number of problems that single mothers face, they have two advantages that play in their favor. Men usually have a higher income and have a shorter time of being single than women. However, until they are remarried or have a woman to help them out around the house, men still must deal with the sexual and emotional frustration as a woman does. They must deal with the balancing of work, childcare, and domestic responsibilities. Single fathers are usually doubtful about their ability be a parent, and they are challenged psychologically. [...] "The problems faced by the working single father are more than merely the logistical problems shared by all working parents. He has to change the way he feels about himself as man." [...] A man being a single parent and feelings the effects of the double burden can and will interfere with his career just as it does with a single mother that has a career. A study showed that five percent of single fathers were fired form their jobs due to the double burden and another eight percent quit because the double burden became too much of a burden for them to balance both work and the family. With that being said, single fathers feel the same, if not more, of the effect of the double burden as women do.|$|E
