Clips of a schoolgirl playing Carey are also shown, with Carey shadowing her movements, and her efforts to catch a schoolboy's attention who in turn persistently ignores her, choosing to mess about {{in the classroom and}} corridors with his friends instead. Towards the end of the video, groups of schoolchildren are shown dancing in the corridor as the boy she liked, now an adult, is following Carey around the school and trying to flirt with her, but Carey brushes him off. The official music video has achieved 3.3 million views on YouTube as of June 2017.|$|E

25|$|Aiken {{attended}} Raleigh's Leesville Road High School {{and took}} courses at Campbell University before enrolling at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte. In 1995, Clay started {{working at the}} YMCA. Still in high school, Clay learned quickly {{that he could make}} a difference in the lives of young people. He found his interest in special education while directing YMCA children's camps as a teenager, and at age 19, he served as a substitute teacher for a <b>classroom</b> <b>of</b> students with autism at Brentwood Elementary School in Raleigh. It was during that experience that he decided to finish college and become a special education teacher. While attending college in Charlotte, he took a part-time job as an assistant to a boy with autism, and it was this child's mother, Diane Bubel, who urged him to audition for American Idol. Although his American Idol activities temporarily delayed his academic pursuits, Aiken completed his course work while on tour and graduated with a bachelor's degree in special education in December 2003.|$|E

500|$|An {{accompanying}} {{music video}} for [...] "Good Hit" [...] {{was directed by}} Alexandre Moors.

Hill requested that Baraka speak to the children about the concept of love, to which he improvised in the lecture. Slant Magazines Paul Schrodt remarked on the title's reference to Carter G. Woodson's The Mis-Education of the Negro: [...] " [...] adopts Woodson's thesis and makes it part of her own artistic process. Like the songs themselves, the intro/outro classroom scenes suggest a larger community working to redefine itself." [...] Along with Woodson's book, the album's title was inspired by the film and autobiographical novel The Education of Sonny Carson.|$|E

2500|$|The term [...] "unschooling" [...] as {{coined by}} John Holt {{describes}} an approach in which {{parents do not}} authoritatively direct the child's education, but interact with the child following the child's own interests, leaving them free to explore and learn as their interests lead. [...] "Unschooling" [...] does not indicate {{that the child is}} not being educated, but that the child is not being [...] "schooled", or educated in a rigid school-type manner. Holt asserted that children learn through the experiences of life, and he encouraged parents to live their lives with their child. Also known as interest-led or child-led learning, unschooling attempts to follow opportunities as they arise in real life, through which a child will learn without coercion. Children at school learn from 1 teacher and 2 auxiliary teachers in a <b>classroom</b> <b>of</b> approximately 30. Kids have the opportunity of dedicated education at home with a ratio of 1 to 1. An unschooled child may utilize texts or classroom instruction, but these are not considered central to education. Holt asserted that there is no specific body of knowledge that is, or should be, required of a child.|$|E
