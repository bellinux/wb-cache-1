40|$|We {{developed}} {{four new}} techniques to visualize hyper spectral image data for man-in-the-loop target detection. The methods respectively: (1) display the subsequent bands {{as a movie}} (movie), (2) map the data onto three channels and display these as a colour image (colour), (3) display {{the correlation between the}} pixel signatures and a known target signature (match) and (4) display the output of a standard anomaly detector (anomaly). The movie technique requires no assumptions about the target signature and involves no information loss. The <b>colour</b> <b>technique</b> produces a single image that can be displayed in real-time. A disadvantage of this technique is loss of information. A display of the match between a target signature and pixels and can be interpreted easily and fast, but this technique relies on precise knowledge of the target signature. The anomaly detector signifies pixels with signatures that deviate from the (local) background. We performed a target detection experiment with human observers to determine their relative performance with the four techniques,. The results show that the match presentation yields the best performance, followed by movie and anomaly, while performance with the colour presentation was the poorest. Each scheme has its advantages and disadvantages and is more or less suited for real-time and post-hoc processing. The rationale is that the final interpretation is best done by a human observer. In contrast to automatic target recognition systems, the interpretation of hyper spectral imagery by the human visual system is robust to noise and image transformations and requires a minimal number of assumptions (about signature of target and background, target shape etc.) When more knowledge about target and background is available this may be used to help the observer interpreting the data (aided target detection) ...|$|E

40|$|Anecdotal and journalistic {{references}} to harmful algal blooms (HABs) often report {{the impact on}} water colour, using terms such as “red tide”. Indeed probably the earliest recording (Exodus 7 : 20 - 21) of a harmful algal bloom (HAB) remarks that the waters “turned to blood”. A few thousand years later photoelectric devices have replaced the human eye as detector, allowing a transition from subjective and descriptive observations to detailed and quantitative information on water constituents. The objective of this chapter is to summarise the status of optical remote sensing of HABs by reviewing ocean colour theory and giving an overview of available systems. Applications of optical remote sensing to the monitoring of HABs are reviewed, noting capabilities and limitations, and future perspectives are discussed. The scope of this chapter, as given by the title “ocean colour”, covers passive systems for optical remote sensing using the sun as direct light source (Mobley, 1994). While the term optical remote sensing could be considered to cover {{a wide variety of}} sensors, including the human eye, airborne photographic cameras, shipborne above-water radiometers, etc. the scope here will be limited to sensors providing digital image-based information, thus covering essentially satellite and airborne radiometers. The focus is on reflectance-based techniques because of their overwhelming importance in the available data stream. However, it is noted that some information on phytoplankton (without specific relevance to HABs) can be retrieved from remote sensing of sun-stimulated fluorescence (Babin, 2005; Gower et al. 1999). Active remote sensing systems based on, for example, laser-induced fluorescence (Hoge and Swift, 1981) are excluded. Applications are drawn mainly from marine waters because of the user interest and experience there though the validity of the theory and systems to estuarine and inland waters is also considered. The applications described in this chapter are drawn essentially from HAB studies. However, the theory described as well as many of the remarks made in this chapter are relevant both to HABs and to the much wider field of ecosystem dynamics. In fact, as will be discussed in detail later, ocean colour is used primarily for algae bloom (AB) detection and generally requires supplementary information from seaborne measurements or expert knowledge for determination of the harmfulness of the event. The question “Is the AB a HAB?” is a major challenge for the ocean <b>colour</b> <b>technique.</b> The definition of “harmful” in this context is left for others (Cullen, 2005; Geohab, 2001; Graneli et al. 1998). The present chapter thus covers a wide range of algal species with very different severities of impact. The content of this chapter has been selected according to the spirit of the workshop to provide readers with the theory relevant to understanding the basic principles of ocean colour observations and with an appreciation of the current capabilities and limits of these tools for HAB detection. The target readership is students and potential end-users of coastal observation systems who should thus acquire sufficient knowledge for the initiation and use of such observing tools. Thus, the focus is on general principles of ocean colour remote sensing and a broad understanding of processes with emphasis on their spectral reflectance, loosely termed as “colour”. Optical remote sensing specialists who require a more detailed description of radiative transfer theory and especially the complications of interacting processes, such as multiple scattering, and second order optical effects, should consult the references in the appropriate sections. Readers with no interest in the details of ocean colour theory and data processing may skip sections 2, 3. 1 and 3. 2 but are strongly advised {{to be aware of the}} variety of methods presented in sections 3. 3, 3. 4 and 3. 5 and especially of their limitations. It is common for products from the main ocean colour sensors to give very different results in coastal waters even for data acquired almost simultaneously (De Cauwer et al. 2004). Key questions which are to be answered in this chapter include: • What is ocean colour? • What sensors are available and suitable for HAB detection? • What information can be obtained from such sensors? • What are the limitations of the ocean <b>colour</b> <b>technique</b> for HAB detection? • What developments can be expected in the future?info:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E

METHODS [...] 38 PMR/GCA patients were followed up prospectively. Serum levels of sIL- 2 R and peripheral blood CD 8 lymphocytes were measured {{before the start of}} corticosteroid treatment, after six months of treatment and at the last visit. Phenotypical analysis of lymphocyte subpopulations was performed with a two <b>colour</b> <b>technique,</b> and assay of sIL- 2 R was performed using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent kit. Forty four healthy people matched for age and gender comprised a healthy control group. RESULTS [...] The median duration of follow up was 28 months (range 7 - 65). Corticosteroid treatment lasted a median of 23. 5 months (7 - 65). Eleven patients (29 %) were in remission at the end of follow up; 45 % of the patients had at least one relapse or recurrence. Compared with controls, patients with active disease had a significantly lower percentage of CD 8 cells and significantly increased sIL- 2 R levels. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C reactive protein, and sIL- 2 R values were significantly less after six months of steroid treatment compared with before treatment. The percentage of CD 8 cells remained significantly lower at six months and the end of follow up compared with controls, while sIL- 2 R levels remained significantly greater. Patients in whom the percentage of CD 8 cells at six months was lower than one SD of the mean of normal controls (26 %) had a significantly longer duration of corticosteroid treatment, a greater cumulative dose of prednisone and more relapses or recurrences compared with patients in whom the percentage was in the normal range. The duration of treatment and the cumulative dose of prednisone were not influenced by the percentage of CD 8 cells before treatment therapy or by the levels of sIL- 2 R after six months of treatment. CONCLUSIONS [...] A reduced percentage of CD 8 cells after six months of treatment may be a useful outcome parameter which would identify a group of PMR/GCA patients likely to experience more severe disease, defined as longer duration of corticosteroid treatment, higher cumulative dose of prednisone, and relapse or recurrence of disease...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of the research reported in this thesis {{was to develop a}} technique to monitor the dynamics of sediments and nutrients entering the coastal ocean with river plumes associated with high intensity low frequency events (e. g. floods), using ocean colour remote sensing. To achieve this objective, an inverse bio-optical model was developed, based on analytical and empirical relationships between concentrations of optically significant substances and remote sensing of water-leaving radiance. The model determines concentrations of water-colouring substances such as chlorophyll, suspended sediments, and coloured dissolved organic matter, as well as the values of optical parameters using water-leaving radiances derived from the Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor (SeaWiFS). To solve atmospheric correction in coastal waters, the aerosol type over clear waters is transferred to adjacent turbid water pixels. The vicinity of the Herbert River, central Great Barrier Reef zone, Australia, was used as a case study for the application of the algorithm developed. The satellite ocean <b>colour</b> <b>technique</b> was successfully validated using sea-truth measurements of water-colouring constituents acquired in the area during various seasons throughout 2002 - 2004. A high correlation between chlorophyll and dissolved organic matter was found in the coastal waters of the region, and when the bio-optical model was constrained to make chlorophyll a function of dissolved organic matter, the relationship between in situ and satellite-derived data was substantially improved. With reliable retrieval of the major water-colouring constituents, the technique was subsequently applied to study fluxes of particulate and dissolved organic and inorganic matter following a flood event in the Herbert River during the austral summer of 1999. Extensive field observations covering a seasonal flood in the Herbert River in February 2004 revealed high sediment and nutrient exports from the river to the adjacent coastal waters during the flood event. Due to rapid settling, the bulk of the sediment-rich influx was deposited close inshore, while the majority of nutrients exported from the river were consumed by phytoplankton in a relatively small area of the coastal ocean. With the help of ocean colour remote sensing, it was demonstrated that river-borne sediments and nutrients discharged by a typical flood in the Herbert River are mostly precipitated or consumed within the first 20 km from the coast and therefore are unlikely to reach and possibly affect the midshelf coral reefs of this section of the Great Barrier Reef lagoon...|$|E

40|$|The thesis {{explores the}} visual {{narrative}} concerning {{a journey of}} empowerment for women. To enable the journey to advance the inquiry is directed into two areas. The first area is female gender, which is argued to be socially constructed and implicit in the marginalisation of women in western society. The second area is ‘feminine authority’, which is gained by developing an understanding and acceptance of the characteristics which have historically been considered as belonging to the feminine. Granting these characteristics agency would recognise their authority and assist in the elevation of the female {{to a position of}} equality in western society. Beginning from a feminist position, the research supported the belief that the female is marginalised in western society. It also confirmed the notion that empowerment and authority can be attained by women if they actively pursue the following; • Explore their own psychology beyond the existing socially constructed gender roles. • Develop an understanding of their feminine self by applying Jung 2 ̆ 7 s theories on individuation and archetypes. • Expose the underlying patriarchal influence in western epistemology and science by challenging existing deeply held cultural and scientific beliefs and by actively contributing as feminists to the areas of epistemology and science. Archetypal myths of the ‘feminine’ have developed from an androcentric position. They enforce and perpetuate gender imbalance which contributes to the disenfranchisement of women in western society, ‘Individuation’ is a process in which a person explores aspects of themselves to bring forth parts of their unconscious into their conscious mind in an attempt to gain a deeper understanding of themselves. As a consequence the consciousness develops closer links with archetypal memories which assists the exploration. The ‘true feminine’ is the feminine not restricted or defined by the dominant androcentric view. Knowledge of the feminine empowers women to address the marginalisation of the female in western society and assists in the process of gaining female authority. This enquiry also investigated the four stages of female psychological development with regard to patriarchal influences. Of particular importance is the second stage of psychological development where the female identifies with historically perceived inferior characteristics of the female. This is when she rejects her connections with the primacy of female power and her deep connections with nature which were inherited from archaic times. It is at this stage that she absorbs the myths associated with western patriarchal society which effectively disempower her. Western epistemology, with its emphasis on ‘objective’ investigation and empiricism contributes to the support for and promotion of ‘inferior’ female gender. This type of investigation is brought into question when areas of research into primates and human evolutionary theory is shown to develop from an androcentric view. Western knowledge has associations with power and justice and power is commonly associated with dominance. Regard for ‘truth’ and ‘absolute’ can be viewed as key elements in the support for knowledge and its associations with power. Knowledge has historically maintained suppression of individual experience which promotes a universalised account. This suppression of beliefs other than the dominant authority maintains the existing dominant social structure. Foucault 2 ̆ 7 s view of the genderised or inscribed body alerts us to areas where dominance, resistance and power play a part in maximising masculine power and control. Gender becomes an instrument of power within the existing patriarchal structure. Gender, knowledge and power are identified as areas obstructing female empowerment. Part 3 of this exegesis examines the imagery which embodies the visual narrative. Particularly, the harlequin image, its historical background and connections with ancient mythology including reference to Jungian psychology. The harlequin image is developed sequentially in the earlier black and white drawings on paper. These drawings contained a female figure which was often placed in juxtaposition with a Venus or goddess image, reference was also made to ‘eve’ and the ‘siren’. These elements provided the framework which enabled the harlequin image to emerge and evolve. The narrative developed with an understanding of the ‘feminine’ aspects of the psyche which resulted in the harlequin acquiring the elevated authority of a goddess. The Harlequin evolved from my need for symbolic representation of the female psyche. It represents contradiction and dualism. It is a composition of opposites, reflects masculine and feminine traits, the dark and light of the conscious and unconscious mind, it houses both comic and sinister elements, is a trickster and menace. The costume, colours and patterns are expressive elements conducive to fragmentation and layering within the composition of the paintings. Jung examined the harlequin in Picasso 2 ̆ 7 s paintings. He concluded that as Picasso drew on his inner experiences the harlequin became important as a symbol; it was a pictorial representation from the unconscious psyche. It travelled freely from the conscious to the unconscious and represented the masculine and feminine, chthonian and apollonian. The final painting in the series, a triptych, completes the narrative and stands alone as a salutatory work. It unites the series by combining existing compositional devices and technique while making reference to imagery from previous works, ‘The Three Graces Victorious’, expresses the authority of the feminine. It completes a victorious stage of a journey where the harlequin is empowered by archaic memories and knowledge of the psyche. The feminine is hailed, elevated and venerated. Other elements which assist in expressing the visual narrative are; <b>colour,</b> <b>technique</b> and influence. Colour is explored and its use as an emotive devise in expressionism. Paul Klee 2 ̆ 7 s writing on the use of colour and it 2 ̆ 7 s symbolic meaning and Julia Kristeva 2 ̆ 7 s investigation on colour from a psychoanalytic and semiotic view are also discussed. To indicate influences and connections within my oeuvre, reference is also made to the following: Jasper Johns 2 ̆ 7 for his use of imagery in his ‘Four Seasons’ series with it 2 ̆ 7 s reference to a journey of maturation and Louise Bourgeois 2 ̆ 7 work which deals with issues of gender, memories and past journeys. Although ‘The Three Graces Victorious’; the concluding painting for the investigation is celebratory and represents a finality to the thesis, it points to further areas that impede feminine development and need future examination. Reference is made to a continuation of the exploratory journey by plotting the Harlequin/Goddesses future directions. Although the Harlequin/Goddess is empowered with newly acquired authority, her future journey {{does not need to be}} bound by mathematics or limited by rationality. She does not require power to dominate or gender structures to subjugate, but requires limitless boundaries and contexts. The Harlequin/Goddess 2 ̆ 7 s future journey is not fixed...|$|E
40|$|Research Doctorate - Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) In recent years, {{increasing}} {{concern over}} {{global warming and}} climate change and its connection to CO 2 emissions have received huge attention worldwide. The alarming rise in CO 2 levels and escalating demand for cleaner energy has {{lead to the development}} of novel technologies that may {{play a major role in}} addressing the issues related to CO 2 emissions. Some of these technologies aim at reducing CO 2 emissions by capturing and sequestrating it. Development of carbon abatement technologies, usually referred to as carbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies enables substantial reduction in CO 2 emissions but still using fossil fuels. In conventional coal power plants, recovery of CO 2 is energy intensive because of the low concentration of CO 2 in the flue gas, which is due to the dilution by N 2 in air. The concentration of CO 2 can be increased and thereby the cost of CO 2 recovery can be reduced by removing the nitrogen in the air before entering the furnace. Therefore, in oxy-fuel technology, combustion of coal takes place in the presence of pure oxygen and flue gas that is recycled from the furnace exit to moderate the temperature of the combustion process and for effective heat transfer. Techno-economic feasibility studies that have compared different CCS technologies have declared that oxy-fuel technology emerges as a favourable option among the CCS technologies that are close to commercialization. Apart from the capability to produce a highly concentrated CO 2 stream, this technology has also been credited for its flexibility, as it can be adapted in new designs or used to retrofit existing coal fired (p. f.) power plants. Review of the literature shows that the change from air to oxy-fuel mode modifies the gas composition inside the furnace that leads to an altered temperature, species and heat transfer profiles causing undesirable effects inside an oxy-fired furnace. The difference in the combustion behaviour in an oxy-fuel furnace compared to conventional systems is summarized in the literature as due to the difference in the thermo-physical properties of the bulk gas (either N 2 or CO 2) and due to the change in the near burner aerodynamics caused due to different throughputs in air and oxy-fuel combustors. Extensive research work has been carried out in this novel mode of combustion, establishing the issues and addressing solutions. More research is needed especially on issues like ignition and devolatilization, as stable combustion in pulverized coal combustion system is ensured by the rapid volatile release, ignition and heat released during devolatilization. Therefore issues related to ignition and devolatilization is considered most important and requires continuous intensive research to take this technology to the next phase of commercialization. It has also been proposed by many researchers that undesirable behaviour during oxy-fuel combustion can be controlled by increasing the oxygen concentration in the oxidizer stream above 21 % in CO 2. The current research aims to carry out a fundamental investigation on the ignition behaviour of individual coal particles in oxy-fuel environments, comparing the results with the behaviour in air combustion. The objective is to compare the combustion parameters such as burnout times and particle burning temperatures in N 2 and CO 2 environments to understand the coal burning behaviour in oxy-fuel combustion and to quantify the impact of CO 2 when substituted for N 2. This was accomplished by carrying out a single particle experimental and theoretical investigation on the ignition behaviour of individual pulverized coal particles in air and oxy-fuel conditions utilising an entrained flow reactor supported by a flat flame burner. Optical pyrometry was used to collect thermal radiation emission-time history of the burning particles and burnout times and temperatures were obtained from the radiation traces. The temperatures of the burning particles were estimated by two <b>colour</b> <b>technique</b> while assuming the burning particle behaved as a grey body. Two coals of different rank (sub-bituminous and lignite), two particle size fractions (180 - 212 μm and 106 - 125 μm) at two furnace temperatures (1550 K and 1800 K), with oxygen concentration in the ambient gas varying from 10 % to 50 % by volume were used for the experiments. A single particle combustion model was also developed to simulate the combustion behaviour of coal particles in air and oxy-fuel conditions. Direct observations of the burning particles using a high speed camera were completed to validate the flame sheet concept used in the volatile combustion modelling. Cine and still images showed that the volatiles released from the particle form a volatile cloud surrounding the particle and are burnt in a spherical diffusion flame sheet enveloping the particle which shrinks in size as the volatiles are consumed. The size of the volatile cloud decreases with increasing oxygen concentration in the ambient gas which is consistent with the flame sheet radius predicted using the flame sheet model. Combustion data obtained in different gas mediums (O 2 /N 2 and O 2 /CO 2) show that, particles burn faster and hotter in the presence of N 2 compared to CO 2. Particles burning slower and colder in CO 2 environments is attributed to the higher molar heat capacity of CO 2 and lower mass diffusivity in CO 2. The higher molar heat capacity acts as a heat sink, lowering the temperature of volatile combustion and particle temperature (cooling effect), while the lower mass diffusivity slows down the burning rate of both volatile and char. Irrespective of the bulk gas composition, burnout times and particle temperatures were strongly dependent on oxygen concentration and particle size. Smaller particles were found to burn rapidly and more intensely than larger particles due to the close proximity of the flame sheet to the particle surface. Since the energy imparted to the particle is higher, smaller particles burn hotter for shorter times, with little impact of the ambient gas temperature. Once the flame sheet, which is at a higher temperature than the ambient has formed, it becomes the dominant source of energy isolating the particle from the ambient. Oxygen concentration has a significant effect on the extent of devolatilization, which can be explained by the higher energy feed back to the particle due to higher flame sheet temperatures and closer flame sheet locations. The increased rate of char burning at higher oxygen concentrations can be explained by the higher accessibility of oxygen and higher heating rates from the flame sheet, ensuring the char particle reaches a higher temperature, thus increasing the char burning rate and lower burnout times. The observed trends in combustion durations and particle temperatures in air and oxy-fuel conditions are in accordance with previous investigations on single coal particles in air and oxy-fuel conditions and also with the predicted data using single particle modelling. Though the combustion duration trends predicted by the model are consistent with the measured times, the model over predicted the times irrespective of coal type and other experimental conditions. The relatively poorer behaviour of coal burning in an oxy-fuel environment compared to air can be overcome by increasing the oxygen concentration in the ambient gas above 21 % by volume...|$|E
