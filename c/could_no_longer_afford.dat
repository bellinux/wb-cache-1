In 1952, the school buildings were considered insufficient so a new block was built, opening in 1955.

50|$|After Coastal {{became a}} branch of the University of South Carolina in 1961, it moved from its {{location}} at Conway High School and into its current location, sitting on 184 acre of land. Then, only the Singleton building existed, which housed classrooms, offices, and the library. A full-time librarian <b>could</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> be <b>afforded,</b> so Patricia Kleinhans was hired as a library assistant. After the 1967 SACS visit described the library as minimal, the college decided to allot $180,000 to expand the building and allow for the expansion of the library to 27,000 volumes.|$|R

Accordingly, the interest rate was lowered by 0.75%. The economy, too, was so decrepit that barter trade became prevalent in rural market places.

The decline continued after World War II when electric washers and dryers meant for home use became affordable to {{a large percentage of}} the populace. As individual customers disappeared, factory laundries turned to specialized services such as washing diapers or linens. In 1950, the American Linen Supply Company bought the Yale Laundry Company. In 1959, Perfect Fit Manufacturing began to use the building to make auto seat covers, tire covers, and other automotive fabrics. Perfect Fit remained in the building through 2006.|$|E
5000|$|The rebels also {{received}} {{financial support from}} Charles II, Duke of Guelders, who claimed the Duchy of Guelders {{in opposition to the}} House of Habsburg. Charles also employed mercenaries under command of his military commander Maarten van Rossum in their support.

The rebels lost their financial support and <b>could</b> then <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>afford</b> to pay their mercenary army.

50|$|Unfortunately for the movement, on January 24 {{the second}} largest steel company in Korea {{declared}} bankruptcy and with it there came to surface a hosts of government scandals. This diverted the media's focus from the strike. Compounding the problem, many workers and unions {{did not want to}} go back on strike because they had already suffered lost wages and could not afford to continue. Not only <b>could</b> the workers <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>afford</b> to continue, the KCTU and the FKTU had run out of money by this point and did not have the necessary finances to continue the strikes.|$|R
5|$|Instead, Metternich stayed six months, entrusting {{his office}} in Vienna to his father. He set about using the marriage, and flattery, to renegotiate the terms set out at Schönbrunn. The {{concessions}} he won were trivial, however: a few trading rights, delay in the payment of the war indemnity, restitution of some estates belonging to Germans in the Austrian service, including the Metternich family's, and the lifting of a 150,000 man limit on the Austrian army. The last was particularly welcomed {{as a sign of}} increased Austrian independence, although Austria <b>could</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>afford</b> an army greater than the limit prescribed.|$|E

It was commissioned by the Kent County Cricket Club {{at the suggestion of}} chairman Lord Harris to celebrate their first County Championship title win. Tayler painted the picture after taking individual sittings with each of the Kent players. With the exception of short-term loans, the painting remained at the St Lawrence Ground until 1999, at which time it was moved to the Lord's Pavilion as the Kent Club <b>could</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>afford</b> the insurance. In 2006, Kent sold the painting to a charity foundation at an auction. The piece is currently on display at Lord's Cricket Ground in London.|$|E
5|$|Merrick was now {{homeless}} on {{the streets}} of Leicester. His uncle, a barber named Charles Merrick, heard of his nephew's situation, sought him out and offered him accommodation in his home. Merrick continued to hawk around Leicester {{for the next two years}} but his efforts to earn a living met with little more success than before. Eventually, his disfigurement drew such negative attention from members of the public that the Commissioners for Hackney Carriages withdrew his licence when it came up for renewal. With young children to provide for, Charles <b>could</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>afford</b> to support his nephew. In late December 1879, now 17 years old, Merrick entered the Leicester Union Workhouse.|$|E
5000|$|The Truce of Espléchin {{marked the}} end of the first phase of the Hundred Years' War and {{resulted}} in a cessation of hostilities on all fronts for nine months. The cost both politically and financially had been immense. Grand alliances <b>could</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> be <b>afforded</b> and some allies <b>could</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> be relied on. The German princes all backed out of the anti-French alliance, only the burghers of Flanders remained. In England; opinion was turning against Edward, his gains on the continent had been at a large cost and most of Scotland had been lost. Essentially bankrupt, Edward was forced to cut his losses. Those whose support he could not afford to lose were repaid, others were not. The contemporary Florentine chronicler Giovani Villanni suggested that the banks of Bardi and Peruzzi failed because Edward III defaulted on the loans. Villanni was not an independent source, his brother was a member of the Peruzzi company. Villanni said that Edward owed the Bardi 900,000 gold florins (£135,000) and the Peruzzi 600,000 (£90,000). But the Peruzzis' records show that they never had that much capital to lend Edward III. [...] In reality the English crown had forced the companies to accept a smaller amount of debt and repaid some with cash and others with royal grants of wool, a principal export of the English economy at the time.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: This essay briefly {{examines}} the British military and their decline {{as a world}} military leader between 1919 - 1939. During this period {{one could argue that}} naiveté clouded the lens through which they viewed military power in general in relation to other nations causing miscalculations in particular with regard to strategic policy considerations. We can contrast their lens then with our lens today as we transition from major military engagements to minimal engagements while balancing strategic prudence with fiscal limitations. Although the context is not exactly the same, the consequences of miscalculated policy decisions following World War I provide useful causal lessons worth further consideration. Those lessons do not entirely regard the effect of restraints directly on the military, rather they regard potential blind spots that might be either missed or neglected. By 1919 the body politic in Britain lacked the stomach to endure the physical cost of another Great War. They also <b>could</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> financially <b>afford</b> it. This aversion transcended social attitudes to political and military policies {{to the extent that the}} British government definitively forecasted a ten year period in which, "the British Empire will not be engaged in any great war…and that no Expeditionary Force is required for this purpose. "[1] Through the 1920 s and 1930 s, protecting British fiscal interests outweighed protecting potential security interests. Consequently Britain's weakened will for security translated int...|$|R

Young Stephen was sent to school near Mobile, Alabama, but his {{education}} was interrupted by his father's death. His elder brother John also died about this time. To support herself and her surviving son, Ellen opened a boarding house for seamen. Then she sent her son away for further schooling at a Moravian academy in Nazareth, Pennsylvania. Although he was {{for all of his}} life a practicing Catholic, he had only praise for the education he received at the academy. After about three years, his mother <b>could</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>afford</b> to pay his tuition, so in 1829 his schooling ended and he returned home.|$|E
5|$|The {{heaviest}} fighting {{occurred at}} the Thomas gate, where Thomas again commanded the sally in person. After intense fighting, Thomas, seeing {{that there was no}} weakening in the Muslim front, decided that continuing the attack would be fruitless and would lead to even heavier casualties among his men. He ordered a withdrawal and the Romans moved back at a steady pace, during which they were subjected to a concentrated shower of arrows by the Muslims. This was the last attempt by Thomas to break the siege. The attempt had failed. He had lost thousands of men in these sallies, and <b>could</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>afford</b> to fight outside the walls of the city.|$|E

In addition, {{shortly after the}} publication of Emma, Henry Austen repurchased the copyright for Susan from Crosby. Austen was forced to postpone publishing either of these completed novels by family financial troubles. Henry Austen's bank failed in March 1816, depriving him of all of his assets, leaving him deeply in debt and losing Edward, James, and Frank Austen large sums. Henry and Frank <b>could</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>afford</b> the contributions they had made to support their mother and sisters.|$|E

5|$|Along {{with the}} rising {{importance}} of a central administration arose {{a new class of}} educated scribes and officials who were granted estates by the pharaoh in payment for their services. Pharaohs also made land grants to their mortuary cults and local temples, to ensure that these institutions had the resources to worship the pharaoh after his death. Scholars believe that five centuries of these practices slowly eroded the economic power of the pharaoh, and that the economy <b>could</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>afford</b> to support a large centralized administration. As the power of the pharaoh diminished, regional governors called nomarchs began to challenge the supremacy of the pharaoh. This, coupled with severe droughts between 2200 and 2150BC, is assumed to have caused the country to enter the 140-year period of famine and strife known as the First Intermediate Period.|$|E
5|$|In early 1957, Tubb persuaded Hamilton {{to switch}} the {{magazine}} from pocket-book to digest size format, {{in the hope}} that this would improve the magazine's visibility on bookstalls. The circulation did indeed rise, to about 14,000 copies per month—a surprisingly low figure given Landsborough's assertion that Authentic had been selling 30,000 copies in the early days. However, later that year, Hamilton made the decision to invest a substantial sum in the UK paperback rights of an American best-seller: it is not known for certain which book this was, but it is thought to have been Evan Hunter's The Blackboard Jungle. Hamilton <b>could</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>afford</b> to have cash tied up in Authentic, and in the summer of 1957 Tubb was given two months to close down the magazine, printing stories that had already been paid for. The last issue was dated October 1957.|$|E

When the Second World War broke out in 1939, measures were taken to defend the Northumberland coastline from a potential German invasion. The castle was used as an observation post and the site was refortified with trenches, barbed wire, pill boxes and a mine field. In the 21st century the castle is owned by the National Trust and run by English Heritage. The ruins are protected under UK law as a Grade I listed building, and are part of a Site of Special Scientific Interest, forming an important natural environment for birds and amphibians.|$|E

This was a huge sum, and Henry turned to parliament for help in 1255, only to be rebuffed; further attempts followed, but by 1257 only partial parliamentary assistance had been offered. Alexander grew increasingly unhappy about Henry's prevarication and in 1258 sent an envoy to England, threatening to excommunicate Henry {{if he did not}} first pay his debts to the Papacy and then send the promised army to Sicily. Parliament again refused to assist the King in raising this money. Instead Henry turned to extorting money from the senior clergy, who were forced to sign blank charters, promising to pay effectively unlimited sums of money in support of the King's efforts, raising around £40,000. The English Church felt the money was wasted, vanishing into the long-running war in Italy.|$|E
