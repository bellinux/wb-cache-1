5|$|Formby went to Normandy in July 1944 in {{the vanguard}} of a wave of ENSA performers. He and Beryl {{travelled}} over on a rough crossing to Arromanches giving a series of impromptu concerts to troops in improvised conditions, including on the backs of farm carts and army lorries, or in bomb-cratered fields. In one location the German front line was too close for him to perform, so he <b>crawled</b> <b>into</b> the trenches and told jokes with the troops there. He then boarded HMS Ambitious for his first scheduled concert before returning to France to continue his tour. During dinner with General Bernard Montgomery, whom he had met in North Africa, Formby was invited to visit the glider crews of 6th Airborne Division, who had been holding a series of bridges without relief for 56 days. He did so on 17 August in a one-day visit to the front line bridges, where he gave nine shows, all standing beside a sandbag wall, ready to jump into a slit trench in case of problems; much of the time his audience were in foxholes. After the four-week tour of France, Formby returned home to start work on I Didn't Do It (released in 1945), although he continued to work on ENSA concerts and tours in Britain. Between January and March 1945, shortly after the release of He Snoops to Conquer, he left on an ENSA tour that took in Burma, India and Ceylon (the latter is now Sri Lanka). The concerts in the Far East were his last for ENSA, {{and by the end of}} the war it was estimated that he had performed in front of three million service personnel.|$|E

Children who, over the years, have <b>crawled</b> <b>into</b> the arched space beneath the pulpit have {{discovered}} another such beautiful carved boss, in miniature and usually unseen. On all the terminals of arches within the buildings are carved heads of saints. Those that are near the confessionals are at eye-level and may be examined for their details.|$|E

500|$|... "Agua Mala" [...] {{was written}} by David Amann and was his second story for The X-Files after [...] "Terms of Endearment." [...] "Agua Mala" [...] went through several very {{different}} drafts. Amann was originally tasked with bringing back the character of Arthur Dales. His original story was of a monster loose in an abandoned gold mine. Frank Spotnitz, the show's executive producer, did not particularly {{like the idea of}} a gold mine, but he enjoyed the concept of a monster loose in an enclosed space. Amann quickly decided to set the episode during a hurricane and feature a sea monster as the primary antagonist. Originally, the sea monster was blown onto dry land and <b>crawled</b> <b>into</b> the building, before Amann decided to re-write it as living water.|$|E
500|$|The {{original}} {{idea for the}} [...] "Furnace Trap" [...] came from the house having been a crematorium at some point, but this would have involved turning the house into a funeral parlor, so it was instead decided that the furnace {{would be part of}} the house's boiler system. The furnace was visualized {{in the form of a}} computer model so that Bousman could better understand how shots could be filmed. Using the computer model as a guide, the furnace was constructed in three days using cement board and tin with removable sides and top so Timothy Burd (Obi) could be filmed crawling inside. The furnace produced real flames and, in place of Burd, a stunt man using a fire-retardant gel <b>crawled</b> <b>into</b> the fire.|$|E
500|$|The {{cast and}} {{the crew of the}} show enjoyed the episode, for the most part. Co-producer Paul Rabwin said that the episode had some of the funniest {{material}} in The X-Files {{as well as some of}} the most horrific, such as the scene where a cockroach <b>crawled</b> <b>into</b> someone's arm. Gillian Anderson rated the episode one of her favorite episodes of the third season. On a more negative note, writer Darin Morgan ended up being unhappy with the final product, saying [...] "The other day, my girlfriend was saying, 'I never understood that episode,' and I guess I don't either. It was an episode that had a lot of what I thought were really good ideas and never quite got it to work. I was really disappointed with that episode. Some people love it." [...] The plot for [...] "War of the Coprophages" [...] was also adapted as a novel for young adults in 1997 by Les Martin, under the title Die, Bug, Die!.|$|E

2500|$|On December 7, 1987, on {{what would}} have been his 45th birthday, Chapin was posthumously awarded the Congressional Gold Medal for his campaigning on social issues, {{particularly}} his highlighting of hunger around the world and in the United States. His work on hunger included being widely recognized as a key player {{in the creation of the}} Presidential Commission on World Hunger (under 39th President Jimmy Carter) in 1977 (he was the only member who attended every meeting). He was also the inspiration for the antihunger projects USA for Africa and Hands Across America, which were organized by Ken Kragen, who had been Chapin's manager at the end of Chapin's career, after Fred Kewley. Kragen, explaining his work on these benefit events, said, [...] "I felt like Harry had <b>crawled</b> <b>into</b> my body and was making me do it." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{plan called}} for the mine to be detonated between 3:30 and 3:45am {{on the morning of}} July 30. Pleasants lit the fuse accordingly, but as {{with the rest of the}} mine's provisions, they had been given poor quality fuse, which his men were forced to splice themselves. After more and more time passed and no {{explosion}} occurred (the impending dawn creating a threat to the men at the staging points, who were in view of the Confederate lines), two volunteers from the 48th Regiment (Lt. Jacob Douty and Sgt. Harry Reese) <b>crawled</b> <b>into</b> the tunnel. After discovering the fuse had burned out at a splice, they spliced on a length of new fuse and relit it. Finally, at 4:44a.m., the charges exploded in a massive shower of earth, men, and guns. A crater (still visible today) was created, [...] long, [...] wide, and at least [...] deep.|$|E
2500|$|Klebold {{walked down}} the steps toward the cafeteria. He came up to Kirklin, who was already wounded and lying on the ground, weakly calling for help. Klebold said, [...] "Sure. I'll help you," [...] then shot Kirklin in the face, {{critically}} wounding him. Daniel Rohrbough and Sean Graves had descended the staircase when Klebold and Harris' attention was diverted by the students on the grass; Graves—paralyzed beneath the waist—had <b>crawled</b> <b>into</b> {{the doorway of the}} cafeteria's west entrance and collapsed. Klebold shot Rohrbough, who was already fatally wounded by the shots previously fired by Harris, at close range through the upper left chest and then stepped over the injured Sean Graves to enter the cafeteria. Officials speculated that Klebold went to the cafeteria to check on the propane bombs. Harris shot down the steps at several students sitting near the cafeteria's entrance, severely wounding and partially paralyzing 17-year-old Anne-Marie Hochhalter as she tried to flee. Klebold came out of the cafeteria and went back up the stairs to join Harris.|$|E

2500|$|While on {{a flight}} over North Vietnam, Capt. Sijan ejected from his {{disabled}} aircraft and successfully evaded capture for more than 6 weeks. During this time, he was seriously injured and suffered from shock and extreme weight loss {{due to lack of}} food. After being captured by North Vietnamese soldiers, Capt. Sijan was taken to a holding point for subsequent transfer to a prisoner of war camp. In his emaciated and crippled condition, he overpowered 1 of his guards and <b>crawled</b> <b>into</b> the jungle, only to be recaptured after several hours. He was then transferred to another prison camp where he was kept in solitary confinement and interrogated at length. During interrogation, he was severely tortured; however, he did not divulge any information to his captors. Capt. Sijan lapsed into delirium and was placed in the care of another prisoner. During his intermittent periods of consciousness until his death, he never complained of his physical condition and, on several occasions, spoke of future escape attempts. Capt. Sijan's extraordinary heroism and intrepidity above and {{beyond the call of duty}} at the cost of his life are in keeping with the highest traditions of the U.S. Air Force and reflect great credit upon himself and the U.S. Armed Forces./S/GERALD R.
