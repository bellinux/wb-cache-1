40|$|A greased {{cable is}} {{positioned}} along a generic {{curve in the}} interior of a beam and is anchored to the beam at its extreme points. The absence of friction permits a relative slipping between the cable and beam at intermediate points and this makes the <b>cable</b> <b>strain</b> dependent on the global deformation of the beam. Such a system permits controlling the beam state of stress and strain by assigning a predetermined traction force on the cable. This paper proposes a formulation of the system dynamics by defining the balance conditions describing the infinitesimal motions in the neighbourhood of a known balanced static configuration in order to evaluate the effect due to the presence of the stretched cable on the motion and free vibrations of the system. The kinematical model adopted for the beam permits a sufficiently accurate description of the behavior of thin walled beams and the <b>cable</b> <b>strain</b> is obtained as a functional of global deformation. Some qualitative aspects concerning the problem formulation and the dynamical behavior are stated.

40|$|Accelerometer cables {{should be}} {{securely}} fastened to stationary components with clamp, tape, or other adhesive means to minimize relative cable motion (cable whip). Cable motion can introduce self noise, especially in high-impedance signal paths (for example, from piezoelectric accelerometer output to charge amplifier input). This self-generated noise {{is referred to}} as the triboelectric effect. Although the low-noise treatment of cable is a solution to minimizing this effect it is still necessary to limit the motion of cables to further reduce noise. When an accelerometer cable is fastened to non-moving structure it introduces <b>cable</b> <b>strain</b> near the electrical connector of the accelerometer that pushes or pulls the accelerometer while it is in movement. Such a push or pull contributes to the accelerometer rocking motion that is a main source of measurement uncertainty. In practice, leaving enough slack to allow free movement of the accelerometer while securing the cable may reduce the <b>cable</b> <b>strain</b> in trade with cable motion limitation. This paper presents the development of a laser position sensing system to study this trade-off. Dummy accelerometers are fabricated that integrate mirrors and electrical connector. The dummy accelerometers have the same mechanical dimensions of commercial accelerometers and are made of solid steel to eliminate the rocking motion due to accelerometer housing. A laser beam is incident on one of the mirrors of the dummy accelerometer. The reflected laser beam is received by a lateral effect position sensitive detector (PSD) to monitor any motion that deviates from the axial motion due to the rocking motion. A twochannel waveform recorder is used to capture the PSD output signals. The waveform recorder, which is equipped with a computer interface, is capable of analog-to-digital conversion, storage of the PSD output signals and display of laser beam deviations in real time. With this system the adjustment of cable fastening can be done in real time. An example is given in this paper that shows the accelerometer rocking motion for different cable fastening conditions. The system can also be used to study the rocking motion of a vibration shaker while performing calibration for different mass loads and air bearing flow rates.

In 2010, the <b>cable</b> <b>strain</b> relief of the HM II device was improved (132 patients with old and 79 with new) and sealed grafts were introduced (68 patients with sealed inflow connector and outflow graft and 125 without). In 2011, titanium sintering of the inflow cannula of HW pumps was introduced (137 patients with a non-sintered and 210 with a sintered inflow cannula). Results: The median support time was 1. 12 (0 - 6. 1) years for all HM II and 0. 59 (0 - 4. 2) years for all HW patients. The cumulative rate of events per patient-year (EPPY) was 0. 11 in HM II patients, compared with 0. 09 EPPY in HW patients (P = 0. 32).

40|$|Because {{of concern}} about {{possible}} impacts of hydrocarbon production activities on coastal-area environments and infrastructures, new hydrocarbon offshore development projects in Italy must submit a monitoring plan to Italian authorities to measure and analyse real-time subsidence evolution. The general geological context, where the main offshore Adriatic fields are located, is represented by young unconsolidated terrigenous sediments. In such geological environments, sea floor subsidence, caused by hydrocarbon extraction, is quite probable. Though many tools are available for subsidence monitoring onshore, few are available for offshore monitoring. To fill the gap ENI (Ente Nazionale Idrocarburi) started a research program, principally in collaboration with three companies, to generate a monitoring system tool to measure seafloor subsidence. The tool, according to ENI design technical-specification, would be a robust long pipeline or cable, with a variable or constant outside diameter (less {{than or equal to}} 100 mm) and interval spaced measuring points. The design specifications for the first prototype were: to detect 1 mm altitude variation, to work up to 100 m water depth and investigation length of 3 km. Advanced feasibility studies have been carried out with: Fugro Geoservices B. V. (Netherlands), D'Appolonia (Italy), Agisco (Italy). Five design (using three fundamental measurements concepts and five measurement tools) were explored: cable shape changes measured by <b>cable</b> <b>strain</b> using fiber optics (Fugro); cable inclination measured using tiltmeters (D'Appolonia) and measured using fiber optics (Fugro); and internal cable altitude-dependent pressure changes measured using fiber optics (Fugro) and measured using pressure transducers at discrete intervals along the hydraulic system (Agisco). Each design tool was analysed and a rank ordering of preferences was performed. The third method (measurement of pressure changes), with the solution proposed by Agisco, was deemed most feasible. Agisco is building the first prototype of the tool to be installed in an offshore field in the next few years.

50|$|As {{the costs}} of {{erecting}} a sufficiently high mast were exorbitant, a suspended antenna system in the mountains was conceived. The 1735 m Herzogstand mountain between the Kochelsee and Walchensee in the Bavarian alps seemed particularly suitable for several reasons: the summit is accessible all year round, sufficient water for drinking and cooling was available, and the conveniently nearby Lake Walchen Power Plant promised a safe, economical power supply. The design of the antenna was unprecedented. As free span a distance of over 2,5 km resulted to reach with a difference in height of 800 m. around a sufficient height of the antenna above ground should the rope at the lower point of suspension horizontally accumulate, which required an enormous tension of the rope. Due to that load by wind, in addition, by snow and ice, additionally which can be expected, only steel wire of highest firmness was applicable. A first thin steel <b>cable</b> became <b>strained</b> in the summer 1920. Radiation measurements resulted in the 1.3 subject radiation and/or the 1.6 subject in the comparison to the overseas Eilvese transmitter {{in the case of}} wavelengths of 12,6 km and 9.7 km in the comparison to the high-power radio station Nauen. Up to the early summer 1925 3 antennas were pulled fan-like for the summit burr of the duke conditions. In order to improve conductivity, the steel cable was coated with aluminum. The rope in a particularly developed Seilereianlage within the summit range were manufactured. Around the summit the antennas were fixed to concreted steel anchors. At the lower tie points a mobile suspension system was used, in order to allow the cables to stretch when loaded with snow and ice.|$|R
