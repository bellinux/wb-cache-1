40|$|The routine use of drains {{in surgery}} has been dogmatically instituted in some disciplines. Orthopaedic surgery {{is one such}} sub-speciality. The use of {{postoperative}} <b>closed</b> suction <b>drainage</b> in total hip arthroplasty (THA) has become increasingly controversial with multiple randomised control trials performed to assess the benefit to outcome in THA. The hypothesis of this systematic review is that <b>closed</b> suction <b>drainage</b> does not infer a benefit and increase transfusion requirements of primary total hip arthroplasty patients. A systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted adhering to the PRISMA guidelines. A search of the available literature was performed on PubMed, Cochrane Central Registry of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE (OVID) and EMBASE {{using a combination of}} MeSH terms and Boolean operators. All data analysis was performed using the Cochrane Collaboration's Review Manager 5. 1. Sixteen studies (n= 2705) were included in the analysis. Post-operative <b>closed</b> suction <b>drainage</b> was found to increase total blood loss and blood transfusion requirements (p< 0. 05). Surgical site infection demonstrated {{no significant difference between the}} two groups (p= 0. 82). No significant difference in haematoma formation between groups (p= 0. 19) was elicited.

40|$|Background: Total knee {{arthroplasty}} (TKA) {{is widely}} accepted treatment for moderate or severe osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis. Significant blood loss {{can be seen}} during the early postoperative period where a blood transfusion may be necessary. <b>Closed</b> suction <b>drainage</b> is known to prevent the formation of hematomas in the operative field, decrease tension on incisions, diminish delayed wound healing and {{reduce the risk of}} infection. Subcutaneous indwelling <b>closed</b> suction <b>drainage</b> method has been known to be beneficial and an alternative to the intraarticular indwelling method. This prospective randomized study was to compare the visible, hidden, total blood loss and postoperative hemodynamic change of subcutaneous and intraarticular indwelling <b>closed</b> suction <b>drainage</b> method after TKA. Materials and Methods: One hundred and sixty patients with primary osteoarthritis who underwent unilateral TKA were enrolled; group A with subcutaneous (n = 78) and group B with intraarticular (n = 79) indwelling <b>closed</b> suction <b>drainage</b> method. Total blood loss, visible blood loss, internal blood loss, postoperative day 1, 5 th, 10 th day hemoglobin, hematocrit levels were compared. Allogeneic blood transfusion rate and complications related to soft tissue hematoma formation were additionally compared. Results: Allogenic transfusion requirements between subcutaneous drainage group and intraarticular drainage groups (6. 4 % vs. 24. 1 %) were significantly different (P = 0. 002). Although the minor complications such as the incidence of bullae formation and the ecchymosis were higher in the subcutaneous indwelling group, the functional outcome at postoperative 2 year did not demonstrate the difference from intraarticular drainage group. Conclusion: Subcutaneous indwelling <b>closed</b> suction <b>drainage</b> method is a reasonable option after TKA for reduction of postoperative bleeding and transfusion rate...|$|R

40|$|One {{important}} form {{of wetlands}} habitat in Nebraska is the “Fresh-water Basins”; their importance extends to both waterfowl and upland game. The fresh-water basins are located primarily in south-central Nebraska.

Soils are silt loam and the somewhat impervious soils in flat or depressed position receive and retain the largest amounts of water. This caused leaching and concentration of clay in the subsoil forming a soil type peculiar to these areas known as 2 ̆ 2 Scott silt-loam, 2 ̆ 2 a heavy clay-loam which forms a water-retaining soil from four inches to more than six feet thick in some cases.

40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} the efficacy {{and safety of}} the treatment of traumatic hemothorax by <b>closed</b> pleural <b>drainage</b> using a central venous catheter (CVC), compared with using a conventional chest tube. Methods: A prospective controlled study with the Ethics Committee approval was undertaken. A total of 407 patients with traumatic hemothorax were involved and they {{were randomly assigned to}} undergo <b>closed</b> pleural <b>drainage</b> with CVCs (n= 214) or conventional chest tubes (n= 193). The Seldinger technique was used for drainage by CVC, and the conventional technique for drainage by chest tube. If the residual volume of the hemothorax was less than 200 ml after the daily volume of drainage decreased to below 100 ml for two consecutive days, the treatment was considered successful. The correlative data of efficacy and safety between the two groups were analyzed using t or chi-squared tests with SPSS 13. 0. A P value of less than 0. 05 was taken as indicating statistical significance. Results: Compared with the chest tube group, the operation time, fraction of analgesic treatment, time of surgical wound healing, and infection rate of surgical wounds were significantly decreased (P 0. 05), or in the mean catheter/tube indwelling time and mean medical costs of patients treated successfully (P> 0. 05).
