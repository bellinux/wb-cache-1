40|$|The Army {{manpower}} {{system is}} a integration of numerous elements that can be independently modeled. Identifying and closing gaps in modeling research can reduce workforce inefficiencies and costs. Military manpower models are predominantly focused on forecasting behavior and inventory within given demand requirements. Moreover, research directed towards predicting behavior is almost entirely disaggregated by pecuniary and non-pecuniary goals with disproportionate effort devoted to modeling the external factors that effect such behavior. This thesis proposes modeling approaches to improve the management capabilities of the Army 2 ̆ 7 s manpower system. First, we consider a simulation-optimization approach to estimating workforce requirements examines the capabilities and limitations of Monte Carlo simulation and optimization methods {{within the context of}} workforce demand forecasting, modeling and planning. Specifically, we focus on these methods as a viable improvement for aligning strategic goals with workforce requirements. A general model is presented for estimating workforce requirements given uncertain demand. Using a real-world data example, we assess the benefits of this methodology to determine an optimal mix of workforce skills while providing the flexibility and robustness to incorporate uncertainty, assess risk and improve effectiveness of the workforce planning process. Second, we address the critical stay-or-leave decision associated with <b>military</b> retention. <b>Personnel</b> retention {{is one of the most}} significant challenges faced by the U. S. Army. Central to the problem is understanding the incentives of the stay-or-leave decision for <b>military</b> <b>personnel.</b> Using three years of data from the U. S. Department of Defense, we construct and estimate a Markov chain model of <b>military</b> <b>personnel.</b> Unlike traditional classification approaches, such as logistical regression models, the Markov chain model allows us to describe <b>military</b> <b>personnel</b> dynamics over time and answer a number of managerially relevant questions. Building on the Markov chain model, we construct a finite horizon stochastic dynamic programming model to study the monetary incentives of stay-or-leave decisions. The dynamic programming model computes the expected payoff of staying versus leaving at different stages of the <b>career</b> of <b>military</b> <b>personnel,</b> depending on employment opportunities in the civilian sector. We show that the stay-or-leave decisions from the dynamic programming model possess surprisingly strong predictive power, without requiring personal characteristics that are typically employed in classification approaches. Furthermore, the results of the dynamic programming model can be used as input in classification methods and lead to more accurate predictions. Overall, our work presents an interesting alternative to classification methods and paves the way for further investigations on personnel retention incentives. Finally, a graph coloring approach to deployment sourcing addresses one of the external factors of personnel inventory behavior, deployments. The configuration of persistent unit deployments has the ability to affect everything from individual perceptions of service palatability to operational effectiveness. There is little evidence to suggest any analytical underpinnings to U. S. Army deployment scheduling and unit assignment patterns. This paper shows that the deployment scheduling and unit assignment (DSUA) problem can be formulated as an interval graph such that modifications to traditional graph coloring algorithms provide an efficient mechanism for dealing with multiple objectives...|$|R

40|$|<b>Military</b> <b>personnel</b> {{are faced}} with having to move every three to four years, making it {{extremely}} difficult to build any equity in a home when {{they are forced to}} refinance their loan every time they buy and sell their home. This continuous churn of home loans over a 20 year <b>career,</b> results in <b>military</b> <b>personnel</b> ending their <b>career</b> with little equity in a home because they have primarily only paid the high interest portions of the loans to financial institutions and any equity gained from rising home prices is offset by closing costs. This research will review the current approaches to housing for <b>military</b> <b>personnel,</b> develop the stakeholders needs, propose new approaches to meet these needs, analyze these new approaches and identify the recommended new approaches. The major players in military home purchases have been the service member, Department of Defense, local real estate services, and financial institutions. Local real estate services and financial institutions are currently the groups benefiting from the churn of homes by service members so they have no obvious incentive to change. The research will break down the resources of each of these players and align them with new approaches to real estate. The new approaches listed below will establish the need for large property management/developers that have purchasing powers within the real estate markets similar to Wal-Mart/Sams Club within the consumer goods market. With the military base realignment and closure almost complete, Department of Defense looking {{to get out of the}} housing business and the military clearly at a low manning level, the markets are now primed for this transformation.

The {{aim was to}} examine whether the utilization of psychiatric services of female <b>military</b> <b>personnel</b> has changed since then and to identify psychosocial characteristics of female <b>military</b> <b>personnel</b> with psychiatric disorders. Methods: The centrally archived statistics concerning psychiatric illness of Bundeswehr <b>military</b> <b>personnel</b> for the years 2000 and 2006 were analysed. Further a group of female psychiatric inpatients at the Military Hospital (n= 83) was evaluated with regard to sociodemographic characteristics and compared with a military control group. Results: Between 2000 and 2006, the frequency in percentage terms (based on the average totals {{of male and female}} <b>military</b> <b>personnel)</b> of general practitioners´ consultations for psychiatric problems increased significantly for both male and female <b>military</b> <b>personnel,</b> this increase being more apparent for women than for men. Stress reaction illnesses (ICD- 10 : F 43) showed the greatest rise. In 2006, the total proportion of both outpatient and inpatient mental health treatment provided to female <b>military</b> <b>personnel</b> was significantly higher than for male <b>military</b> <b>personnel,</b> particularly with regard to acute stress reaction, depressive illnesses (F 32 - 39) and personality disorders (F 60 - 61). Partnership conflicts, low education and low rank were significantly more frequent features in the soldiers receiving inpatient treatment than in the female control group. Conclusions: The changes observed may be a reflection of developments in civilian society. However, the special features of military life, such as missions abroad, must also be considered. The implications regarding the demand for psychiatric care in the Bundeswehr are discussed.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} unlimitedWhat {{is the political}} feasibility of a peacetime draft?

In addition to providing estimates of the labor and resources that will be available for transfer to the civilian sector, Iudin examines some of the factors that have made it difficult to assess the comparative magnitudes of real military outlays in the Soviet Union and the United States. How could the Soviet Union have maintained approximate "military parity" with the United States while its levels of military outlays were substantially lower? Among the explanations, in the author's view, were the lower prices and profits of producers of military goods in the Soviet Union, the lower real wages of Soviet military personnel, and lower Soviet outlays on the maintenance of its troops abroad. As for the labor that will be released through reduced defense expenditures, Iudin sees no particular difficulty in shifting workers from the defense sector to civilian production, but does express some concern about the special problems associated with the absorption of <b>career</b> <b>military</b> <b>personnel</b> into civilian life. They will need help in the form of "social protection," housing, new skills, and job placement.
