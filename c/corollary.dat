5|$|As a <b>corollary,</b> Nyuserre {{was almost}} {{certainly}} a son of Neferirkare Kakai as Khentkaus II was Neferirkare's queen. This relationship is also indicated by the location of Nyuserre's pyramid in Abusir next to that of Neferirkare, {{as well as his}} reuse for his own valley temple of materials from Neferikare's unfinished constructions.|$|E
5|$|Christologically Maximus {{insisted on}} a strict dyophysitism, which {{can be seen as}} a <b>corollary</b> of the {{emphasis}} on theosis. In terms of salvation, humanity is intended to be fully united with God. This is possible for Maximus because God was first fully united with humanity in the incarnation. If Christ did not become fully human (if, for example, he only had a divine and not a human will), then salvation was no longer possible, as humanity could not become fully divine.|$|E
5|$|Of {{the four}} major {{elements}} in seawater – hydrogen, oxygen, sodium, and chlorine – only sodium takes on intense, short-term radioactivity {{with the addition of}} a single neutron to its nucleus: common sodium-23 becomes radioactive sodium-24, with a 15-hour half-life. In six days its intensity drops a thousandfold, but the <b>corollary</b> of short half-life is high initial intensity. Other isotopes were produced from seawater: hydrogen-3 (half-life 12 years) from hydrogen-2, oxygen-17 (stable) from oxygen-16, and chlorine-36 (301 thousand years) from chlorine-35, and some trace elements, but due to low abundance or low short-term intensity (long half-life) they were considered insignificant compared with sodium-24.|$|E

5|$|Since in {{the limit}} the forces are {{parallel}} to SP and sp, {{if the same}} force acted on the body in Fig. 2 as in Fig. 1, the body would arrive at y, since ry = RQ. The difference in horizontal speed {{does not affect the}} vertical distances. Newton refers to <b>Corollary</b> 2 of the Laws of Motion where the motion of the bodies is resolved into a component in the radial direction acted on by the whole force, and the other component transverse to it, acted on by no force.|$|E
5|$|Germanicus was a {{favorite}} of his great-uncle Augustus who for some time considered him heir to the Empire. In AD 4, persuaded by his wife Livia, Augustus decided in favor of Tiberius, his stepson from Livia's first marriage to Tiberius Claudius Nero. As a condition of Tiberius' own adoption by Augustus, Tiberius was to adopt Germanicus as a son and to name him as his heir. If Tiberius had not adopted Germanicus before his own adoption, and had Augustus adopted Tiberius first, then Tiberius would have lost sui iuris, which included the legal authority to adopt. It was a <b>corollary</b> to the adoption, probably the next year, that Germanicus married his maternal second cousin, Agrippina the Elder.|$|E
5|$|However, later {{research}} suggests that the initial stability of the implant in bone is a more important determinant of success of implant integration, rather than a certain period of healing time. As a result, the time allowed to heal is typically based on the density of bone the implant is placed in and the number of implants splinted together, rather than a uniform amount of time. When implants can withstand high torque (35 Ncm) and are splinted to other implants, there are no meaningful differences in long-term implant survival or bone loss between implants loaded immediately, at three months, or at six months. The <b>corollary</b> is that single implants, even in solid bone, require a period of no-load to minimize the risk of initial failure.|$|E
30|$|The {{operators}} A and g in <b>Corollaries</b> 3.3 and 3.4 [47] are relaxed cocoercive. But we {{note that}} {{the conditions of the}} aforesaid <b>corollaries</b> guarantee that the operators A and g in these <b>corollaries</b> are in fact strongly monotone. Accordingly, <b>Corollaries</b> 3.3 and 3.4 in [47] are stated with the condition strongly monotonicity of the operators A and g instead of the mild condition relaxed cocoercivity.|$|R

5|$|The {{goal of the}} Commando Hunt campaigns was not to halt infiltration, but to {{make the}} North Vietnamese pay too heavy a price for their effort. <b>Corollary</b> to this was the {{destruction}} of as much of their logistical system as possible and to tie down as many PAVN forces in static security roles as possible. Aerial interdiction could not succeed unless Hanoi felt the pressure and relented. The seed of the campaign's failure, however, was sown in its first operation. Despite the expenditure of {{an enormous amount of}} ordnance over five years, the level of that pressure {{was never going to be}} sufficient to deter Hanoi from its goal.|$|E
25|$|A <b>corollary</b> is a {{proposition}} that follows with little proof from another theorem or definition.
