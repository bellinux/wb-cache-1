5|$|Lissitzky, {{aware of}} severe {{mismatch}} between his {{ideas and the}} existing urban landscape, experimented with different configurations of the horizontal surface and height-to-width ratios so that the structure appeared balanced visually ("spatial balance is in the contrast of vertical and horizontal tensions"). The raised platform was shaped {{in a way that}} each of its four facets looked distinctly different. Each tower faced the Kremlin with the same facet, providing a pointing arrow to pedestrians on the streets. All eight buildings were planned identically, so Lissitzky proposed <b>color-coding</b> them for easier orientation.|$|E
5|$|In the Case 1 diagram, B1 cells show {{canonical}} values, {{which are}} color-coded {{to show their}} row-wise distribution in B2 triplets. Colors reflect distribution but not location or values. For this case: the B2 top row triplet (r21) has 1 value from B1 middle triplet, the other colorings can now be deduced. E.g. the B2 bottom row triplet (r23) coloring is forced by r21: the other 2 B1 middle values must go to bottom, etc. Fill {{in the number of}} B2 options for each color, 3..1, beginning top left. The B3 <b>color-coding</b> is omitted since the B3 choices are row-wise determined by B1, B2. B3 always contributes 3! permutations per row triplet, or 63 for the block.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to develop a {{diagnostic}} tool capable of providing diffusion and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) map information in a single <b>color-coded</b> image and to assess the performance of <b>color-coded</b> images compared with their corresponding diffusion and ADC map. The institutional review board approved this retrospective study, which sequentially enrolled 36 head MRI scans. Diffusion-weighted images (DWI) and ADC maps were compared to their corresponding <b>color-coded</b> images. Four raters had their interobserver agreement measured for both conventional (DWI) and <b>color-coded</b> images. Differences between conventional and <b>color-coded</b> images were also estimated for each of the 4 raters. Cohen’s kappa and percent agreement were used. Also, paired-samples t-test was used to compare reading time for rater 1. Conventional and <b>color-coded</b> images had substantial or almost perfect agreement for all raters. Mean reading time of rater 1 was 47. 4 seconds for DWI and 27. 9 seconds for <b>color-coded</b> images (P=. 00007). These findings are important because they support the role of <b>color-coded</b> images as being equivalent to that of the conventional DWI in terms of diagnostic capability. Reduction in reading time (which makes the reading easier) is also demonstrated for one rater in this study...|$|R

40|$|A {{widely used}} method in {{high-speed}} 3 D shape measurement, <b>color-code</b> fringe projection requires {{the projection of}} only one image. In traditional <b>color-code</b> method, the projected fringe is compounded by sinusoidal fringes, grayscale value distribution ranges from 0 – 255, and projection speed is limited to 120 frames/s. Consequently, measurement speed is restricted, and a nonlinear gamma of the projector exists, as well as high harmonics, which have a great influence on measurement accuracy. Binary <b>color-code</b> fringe defocused projection is proposed to solve the abovementioned problems. With the proposed method, projection speed can switch to tens of K frames/s because it only has two grayscale values (0 and 255). A standard sinusoidal <b>color-code</b> fringe can be generated by properly defocusing the binary <b>color-code</b> fringe, thereby overcoming the influence of nonlinear gamma and ultimately improving measurement accuracy. Experiment results verify the feasibility and superiority of the proposed method...|$|R

25|$|There {{are various}} ways to {{describe}} the stroke order of a character. Children learn the stroke order in courses, as part of writing learning. Various graphical representations are possible, most notably successive images of the character with one more stroke added (or changing color) each time, numbering strokes, <b>color-coding,</b> fanning, and more recently animations. Stroke order is often described in person by writing characters on paper or in the air.|$|E

25|$|The {{study of}} {{functions}} {{of a complex}} variable is known as complex analysis and has enormous practical use in applied mathematics {{as well as in}} other branches of mathematics. Often, the most natural proofs for statements in real analysis or even number theory employ techniques from complex analysis (see prime number theorem for an example). Unlike real functions, which are commonly represented as two-dimensional graphs, complex functions have four-dimensional graphs and may usefully be illustrated by <b>color-coding</b> a three-dimensional graph to suggest four dimensions, or by animating the complex function's dynamic transformation of the complex plane.|$|E
25|$|The helical wheel {{represents}} a helix by {{a projection of}} the Cα backbone structure down the helix axis, while the wenxiang diagram represents it more abstractly as a smooth spiral coiled on {{the plane of the}} page. Both label the sequence with one-letter amino-acid code (see amino acid) at each Cα position, using different colors or symbols to code the amino-acid properties. Hydrophobic vs hydrophilic amino acids are always distinguished, as the most important property governing helix interactions. Sometimes positively vs negatively charged hydrophilics are distinguished, and sometimes ambiguous amino acids such as glycine (G) are distinguished. <b>Color-coding</b> conventions are various. The helical wheel does not change representation along the helix, while the wenxiang diagram is able to show the relative locations of the amino acids in an α-helix regardless of how long it is.|$|E
25|$|The primary form of fMRI {{uses the}} blood-oxygen-level {{dependent}} (BOLD) contrast, discovered by Seiji Ogawa. This {{is a type}} of specialized brain and body scan used to map neural activity in the brain or spinal cord of humans or other animals by imaging the change in blood flow (hemodynamic response) related to energy use by brain cells. Since the early 1990s, fMRI has come to dominate brain mapping research because it does not require people to undergo shots or surgery, to ingest substances, or to be exposed to ionising radiation. This measure is frequently corrupted by noise from various sources; hence, statistical procedures are used to extract the underlying signal. The resulting brain activation can be graphically represented by <b>color-coding</b> the strength of activation across the brain or the specific region studied. The technique can localize activity to within millimeters but, using standard techniques, no better than within a window of a few seconds. Other methods of obtaining contrast are arterial spin labeling and diffusion MRI. The latter procedure is similar to BOLD fMRI but provides contrast based on the magnitude of diffusion of water molecules in the brain.|$|E

25|$|Each {{section is}} denoted {{by a certain}} color to {{differentiate}} sections beyond lettering and is seen in a box the top-left corner of the first page; the principal section colors are blue for News (section A), green for Money (section B), red for Sports (section C), and purple for Life (section D); in the paper's early years, the Life and Money sections were also assigned blue nameplates and spot color, as the presses used at USA Today printing facilities did not yet accommodate the use of other colors to denote all four original sections. Orange is used for bonus sections (section E or above), which are published occasionally such as for business travel trends and the Olympics; other bonus sections for sports (such as for the PGA Tour preview, NCAA Basketball Tournaments, Memorial Day auto races (Indianapolis 500 and Coca-Cola 600), NFL opening weekend and the Super Bowl) previously used the orange color, but now use the red designated for sports in their bonus sections. To increase their ties to USA Today, Gannett incorporated the USA Today coloring scheme into an internally created graphics package for news programming that the company began phasing in across its television station group – which were spun-off in July 2015 into the separate broadcast and digital media company Tegna – in late 2012 (the package utilizes the color scheme for a rundown graphic used on most stations – outside of those that Gannett acquired in 2014 from London Broadcasting, which began implementing the package in late 2015 – that persists throughout its stations' newscasts, as well as bumpers for individual story topics).

500|$|Abrams {{selected}} Michael Kaplan {{to design}} the costumes because {{he had not seen}} any of the films, meaning he would approach the costumes with a new angle. For the Starfleet uniforms, Kaplan followed the show's original <b>color-coding,</b> with dark gray (almost black) undershirts and pants and colored overshirts showing each crew member's position. Command officers wear gold shirts, science and medical officers wear blue, and operations (technicians, engineers, and security personnel) wear red. Kaplan wanted the shirts to be more sophisticated than the originals and selected to have the Starfleet symbol patterned on them. Kirk wears only the undershirt because he is a cadet. Kaplan modelled the uniforms on Kelvin on science fiction films of the 1940s and 1950s, to contrast with Enterprise-era uniforms based on the ones created in the 1960s. For Abrams, [...] "The costumes were a microcosm of the entire project, which was how to take something that's kind of silly and make it feel real. But how do you make legitimate those near-primary color costumes?" ...|$|E
500|$|The {{production}} budget for Mr. Nobody was €33 million (US$47 million), ranking {{it the most}} expensive Belgian film to date. The budget was approved before casting was done, based on the prominence of the director's name {{and the strength of}} his script. Half of the budget was provided by the film's French producer Philippe Godeau through his production company Pan-Européenne, and the other half was financed by distributors Wild Bunch and Pathé. Production took place throughout 2007, lasting 120 days and filming in Belgium, Germany, and Canada. Scenes were filmed on location in Montreal, Canada and at Babelsberg Studios in Berlin, Germany. Van Dormael said, [...] "I think the film needed that for these multiple lives. Each time a new style of setting is required. And each life is filmed in a different style, with a different grammar for the camera, the colours, the decor. At the same time, if all the styles have to be very contrasted, they knock together by fusing." [...] The three lives that Nemo Nobody experiences were separated by <b>color-coding</b> and musical cues. Each life's design was also {{based on the work of}} British photographer Martin Parr.|$|E

As they sing [...] "Understand we'll {{go hand in}} hand / But we'll walk alone in fear", they line up, hold hands, then fling each other's hands away in a piece of what Whedon calls [...] "literal choreography". Each of the eight characters in this line wears a color in the visible spectrum, a conscious decision by the costume designer. The couples in the group wear opposite colors (Giles in green and Buffy in red, Anya in blue and Xander in orange, Tara in yellow and Willow in purple), and Rhonda Wilcox interprets the <b>color-coding</b> and choreography to represent the [...] "tension between the individual and the group". The characters as a chorus sing [...] "The curtains close on a kiss, God knows / We can tell the end is near", moments before Buffy runs out to kiss Spike and the show closes with actual curtains. As Spike and Buffy kiss, a swell of music accompanies them, similar to the ending of Gone with the Wind. Lyrics sung moments before, however, forecast the uncertainty of the relationship between Spike and Buffy, as well as their contrasting reasons for initiating any romance; Spike wants to feel love from Buffy, while she simply wants to feel.|$|E
