The duo started by setting up the epitaxial process at Santa Clara. Once the technology was in place, Widlar concentrated on voltage regulators {{and by the end}} of 1966 produced the industry's first integrated linear regulator. The LM100, a revolutionary new circuit, became another flagship product that surpassed expectations for sales and longevity. In 1967 Widlar designed the LM101, an operational amplifier with improved gain, decreased input current, and protection against short circuit. The LM101 featured another unorthodox input stage, employing NPN input transistors emitter coupled to PNP transistors in a <b>common</b> <b>base</b> <b>arrangement.</b> The high reverse breakdown voltage of the PNP transistors allowed the LM101 to withstand a differential input voltage of ±30 V. Its frequency compensation was simpler and more robust and stable than that of μA709. It was followed by LM101A, a functionally identical IC that pioneered the use of a field-effect transistor to control internal current sources. Widlar's solution minimized die area and current drain, and enabled operation over a wide range of power supply voltages. Later he devised another new device, the super-beta transistor. It was created in silicon by Talbert and integrated in the LM108 precision operational amplifier, which was released in 1969. These high-gain, very-low-voltage devices were capable of operating at very low input currents within the full military range of operating conditions. The items in the linear circuit product line were user friendly, very useful, and very profitable.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a novel {{algorithm}} to construct com-mon base domains for cross-parameterization constrained by an-chor points. <b>Based</b> on the <b>common</b> <b>base</b> domains, a bijective mapping between given models can be established. Experimen-tal {{results show that}} the distortion in a cross-parameterization generated on our <b>common</b> <b>base</b> domains is much smaller than that of a mapping on domains constructed by prior methods. Different from prior algorithms that generate domains by a heuristic of having higher priority to link the shortest paths be-tween anchor points, we compute the surface Voronoi diagram of anchor points to find out the initial connectivity for the base domains. The final <b>common</b> <b>base</b> domains can be efficiently gen-erated from the initial connectivity. The Voronoi diagram of the anchor points gives better cues than the heuristic of connecting shortest paths greedily, therefore resulting in an efficient and re-liable algorithm for construction of <b>common</b> <b>base</b> domains that bring to low distortion in constrained cross-parameterization. ...|$|R

Our algorithm lists all <b>common</b> <b>bases</b> by using pivot operations {{in such a}} way that each basis appears exactly once. The time complexity of the algorithm is O(n(n 2 + t) λ) where n is the size of the ground set of the matroids, λ is the number of <b>common</b> <b>bases,</b> and t is time to make one pivot operation. The space complexity is O(n 2) and thus does not depend on λ As applications, we show how our algorithm can be applied to efficient enumerations of all complementary bases in the linear complementarity problem and all perfect matchings in a bipartite graph...|$|R
