40|$|This {{dissertation}} bundles {{together a}} number of essays that find themselves on {{the intersection of the}} fields of law and economics. It shows that economics can help determine the rationale of individuals’ behaviour both in situations of certainty and uncertainty, by looking at incentives and consequences of behavioural choices. Economics <b>can</b> <b>create</b> <b>insights</b> into the rationale and goals of legislation and it can also explain how preferences and information asymmetries influence the outcomes of negotiations between multiple parties. If there is a central thesis to this dissertation, it is that legal issues can benefit from economic analysis in every stage of the legal process. Albeit by explaining legal constructs from a behavioural perspective ex post, or by using economic concepts to inform legislative decisions ex ante...|$|E
40|$|This essay {{reflects}} {{upon the}} purposes of studying environmental communication {{by focusing on the}} variety of ways we quote ‘‘the environment’’ in our studies. Special attention is given to balancing the twin objectives of speaking about ‘‘the environment,’’ while also listening to what the environment says to us. In the process, we can serve a diversity of peoples, eco-parts and processes, through a language which can keep that diversity in view. How, then, can we assess movement, toward these ends? A proposal is made: We can gather Touchstones on EARTH into our studies, reminding ourselves that: Earth, ‘‘Environment,’’ is doubly quoted: Both the word and the world speak; Action is engaged in words, environments, and their peoples; Responsible research takes nature, or earth, to be the measure of the good; Time helps temper enthusiasms, and allows enduring insights to be built; Heuristic explorations as these <b>can</b> <b>create</b> <b>insights</b> about communication and environment, while generating better ways of dwelling on earth...|$|E

The aim {{of the study was to}} find out what can be learned about the user behavior and how to utilize the captured user interaction data when considering future improvements to the service to enhance the overall user experience. The research of the thesis is based on a case-study inspecting the web analytics data of the Lupapiste web service. The Lupapiste web service allows citizens to apply for constriction permits electronically, while municipalities and cities are able to handle construction permits and the communication by utilizing the Lupapiste web service. Google Analytics was used as the main source of the user interaction data. The results showed web analytics data can give a detailed view of the user behavior, depending on the details of the web analytics implementation and coverage. Inspecting the web analytics data from multiple viewpoints and from varying levels of detail, the data <b>can</b> <b>create</b> <b>insights</b> about the user behavior. The insights from the data can be used for guiding the future improvements of the service. Furthermore, the segmenting of the web analytics data enables to discover distinctive user behaviors. Also, the data can be utilized when considering more detailed inspection of the user behavior such as usability studies. However, the web analytics data cannot reveal the motivations of the users, thus web analytics data should be used in a combination with other research methods to capture attitudinal data of the user behavior...|$|E

It has been revised and updated in 2006, but the core scheme of metaphors has remained the same. Morgan’s simple premise is (2006, 4) “… all theories of organization and management are based on implicit images or metaphors that lead us to see, understand, and manage organizations in distinctive yet partial ways.” Morgan states that a metaphor {{is much more than}} just a devise for embellishing discourse; the use of metaphor implies a way of thinking and a way of seeing that pervade how we understand our world generally. Morgan claims that all theory is metaphor. Theory may be capable of <b>creating</b> valuable <b>insights,</b> but may also give incomplete, biased and potentially misleading information. Metaphor is inherently paradoxical. It <b>can</b> <b>create</b> powerful <b>insights</b> that also become distortions, as a way of seeing through a metaphor (and theory) becomes a way of not seeing. Barter and Russel (2013), as an example, confirm this in their study on the concept of sustainable development. They conclude that the dominant machine and organism metaphors impede progress towards sustainable development because they perpetuate a story that dehumanises and de‐prioritises humans {{at the expense of the}} organisation which in turn becomes a rarefied and prioritised subject.|$|R
40|$|Double {{degree of}} Master of Science in Science Communication & Systems Engineering, Policy Analysis, and Management / SEPAM: Technology Policy and Management / Department: Engineering, Systems and Services + SEC: Applied Physics / Department: Science Communication - In {{the era of}} digital communication, the {{relationship}} between businesses and customers has changed. Businesses provide online personalized services within their ecosystem based on customer data, {{but at the same}} time, customers are reluctant to share personal information. In this article, an online trust building tool is proposed to increase customer’s willingness to share information. A conceptual model is constructed on the relationship between customers sharing information in an online context and businesses providing online personalized services. Customer conditions for information sharing from the conceptual model are validated by a survey under a selection of Transavia airlines’ customers. After conducting a principal component and linear regression analysis, it is found that these customers do not necessarily find monetary or non-monetary benefits the most important conditions for online sharing information. Moreover, gender and age do not have influence. The factor that appears most important for sharing information relates to trust. Customers with a higher general trust and higher institutional trust, are willing to share more personal information with the company. Therefore, literature on trust building is reviewed and four trust building principles are constructed: experience, security, transparency, and trusted sources. For each of the principles, constructs are identified in literature and validated by exploratory customer interviews. The list of constructs is the input for a trust building tool for companies to increase their online trustworthiness. The tool is a basis for a discussion with businesses. These discussions <b>can</b> <b>create</b> <b>insights</b> in how a business can become more trustworthy {{in the eyes of the}} customer, and can as a result lead to gaining more customer information.

We developed this approach for a National Research Council committee which was charged with figuring out the best means for protecting people against potential thyroid cancer due {{to the release of}} radioactive iodine. We first identify an objectives hierarchy, and then develop the single dimensional value functions and the weights for the objectives using a swing weight method. The identification of the largest value gaps between the status quo and the ideally perfect situation helps to develop potential KI distribution plans. We then use an additive value function to assess the performance of these new alternatives with the status quo as a benchmark by computing their overall values. Furthermore, sensitivity analysis for the KI problem shows this approach <b>can</b> <b>create</b> more key <b>insights</b> for the improvement of health and safety decision making processes, and is a useful contribution to the literature on sensitivity analysis in decisions under certainty...|$|R

40|$|This thesis reads sexual power {{dynamics}} – taking {{pleasure in}} being hurt by or hurting someone, wanting to control someone sexually {{or to be}} controlled, and enjoying power struggles and negotiations of roles – as central elements of Charlotte Brontë’s four mature novels. The argument explores the intersections of sex, play, power and agency in Brontë’s work, drawing out the intricate, shifting, and often unexpected dynamics that underlie what can seem like stark, gender-based power differentials between her characters. While {{there is a long}} critical history of examining how erotic relationships in Brontë’s novels develop through power struggles, such readings often cast these patterns of desire as either pathological, or (particularly in the case of submissive or masochistic female characters) as responses created wholly by societal strictures on female power and sexuality. Taking a reparative, sex-radical approach, this thesis rethinks literary intersections of sex and power as productive, not just problematic, and as ways of undermining and playing with, rather than just reinforcing, societal and gendered power structures. The introduction examines the critical history of reading sex and power in Brontë’s work, situates non-normative sexual desire in Brontë’s mid- nineteenth-century context, and shows how reading reparatively <b>can</b> <b>create</b> new <b>insights</b> into sexual power dynamics in literature. The argument examines embodied power and the erotics of mutual infliction of pain in Jane Eyre, shows how material things used as sexual mediators widen the erotic scope of Villette, reads the negotiation of sexual roles in Shirley as a way of managing and transcending the pain of its novel-world, and explores the idea of fantasy as an uncontrollable, unsettling form of intimacy in Jane Eyre, The Professor and the Roe Head journal...|$|R
40|$|Between 2000 and 2008, writer/director Richard Dutcher made four {{films with}} {{narratives}} {{focused primarily on}} members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints. The films are explicitly Mormon-related in their content, but I argue they are also inherently Mormon in their style. Critic and filmmaker Paul Schrader argues there is a particular style of filmmaking, a dialect of the cinematic language if you will, that enables viewers to experience an encounter with a Transcendent Divinity. The contention of this dissertation is that Schrader 2 ̆ 7 s views were simultaneously too general and too narrow. I draw on Clive Marsh 2 ̆ 7 s call for an embrace of religious particularity in film criticism and scholarship and reject the idea of some 2 ̆ 2 universal 2 ̆ 2 filmic style that evokes the Transcendent for all viewers. Rather than ignore the doctrinal, cultural, and historical specifics of a particular religion, I mine the specifics on my own religion, Mormonism, and examine Dutcher 2 ̆ 7 s movie through those lenses in order to discover how a Mormon Transcendent might be evoked through film. I take Marsh 2 ̆ 7 s concept and enact it here in hopes of finding how religious particularity <b>can</b> <b>create</b> greater <b>insight</b> into religious and/or spiritual films and generate greater opportunity for encounters with the Transcendent for viewers. Dutcher 2 ̆ 7 s movies attempt to fuse style and content {{in a way that}} is reflective of Mormon history, doctrine, and worldview. While the style is tentative at first and evolves over the course of his quartet, his films give successful on-screen concretion to elements of Mormonism that allow viewers to experience Latter-Day Saint Divine...|$|R

40|$|Overcrowding {{has been}} an issue in many {{outpatient}} clinics and emergency rooms of healthcare organizations. However, they are important departments that are required to efficiently serve the masses of patients from the general public. This workshop is created to {{understand the importance of}} evaluating the business processes in these departments and how data analytics <b>can</b> help to <b>create</b> <b>insights</b> and provides the opportunity for process and scheduling improvement, hence maximizing efficiency. A process view is important as it allows healthcare organization to stay focus on business needs and drive analytics initiatives. It also helps to leverage on economies of scales in applying techniques to multiple processes of similar nature. The workshop will also cover more advanced topics such as predictive and decision analytics, coupled with IT considerations to create decision-support strategies that enable proactive business processes. Proactive processes combine analytic tools with business process management technology in order to achieve continuous process improvements. Being proactive helps the healthcare organization prepare for likely scenarios. In the final part of the workshop, a case-study in the context of fulfilling service targets of a hospital’s emergency room will be used to show how use of data analytics, prediction analytics and decision analytics can empower decision-making and bring improvements to the ED process. The workshop will be conducted in seminar-styled, small-group coaching and small-group presentations. It is designed to be highly interactive to facilitate discussions and idea generations...|$|R

40|$|In prior research, the {{classification}} of concepts into three types—descriptive, hypothetical and theoretical—has allowed for the association of students’ use of different concept types with their level of understanding. Previous studies have also examined {{the ways in which}} students link concepts to determine whether students have a meaningful understanding of principles of evolution. In this study, we build on our previous work that seeks to examine how students use prior knowledge in new situations and context, as well as present an adaptation of concept and concept-link categorization previously used in biology education research. In this adaptation, concepts are categorized {{on the basis of the}} observability of the concept exemplars and are shown to be dependent upon the knowledge level of the student. We use this categorization method to examine how students use prior knowledge when presented with an opportunity to apply physics in a new context, namely, wavefront aberrometry. Results indicate that students primarily utilize lower-level concepts, which is in agreement with previous research findings. We also found that students are able to create links between different levels of concepts, and that the type of links <b>created</b> <b>can</b> give <b>insight</b> to how deeply they understood the physics of the new context...|$|R
