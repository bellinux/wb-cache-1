5|$|Snow {{develops}} in clouds that themselves {{are part of}} a larger weather system. The physics of snow crystal development in clouds results from a complex set of variables that include moisture content and temperatures. The resulting shapes of the falling and fallen crystals can be classified into a number of basic shapes and combinations, thereof. Occasionally, some plate-like, dendritic and stellar-shaped snowflakes can form under <b>clear</b> <b>sky</b> with a very cold temperature inversion present.|$|E

Fleming then considered The Moonraker Secret, The Moonraker Plot, The Inhuman Element, Wide of the Mark, The Infernal Machine, Mondays are Hell and Out of the <b>Clear</b> <b>Sky.</b> George Wren Howard of Jonathan Cape suggested Bond & the Moonraker, The Moonraker Scare and The Moonraker Plan, while his friend, the writer William Plomer, suggested Hell is Here; the final choice of Moonraker was a suggestion by Wren Howard.|$|E
5|$|The second book, Thunder Rising, {{takes place}} {{a couple of}} months after The Sun Trail. Turtle Tail returns to Gray Wing's group {{pregnant}} by an aggressive kittypet tomcat named Tom, and becomes Gray Wing's mate. A fire breaks out in the forest, forcing Clear Sky's group to take shelter with Gray Wing. While taking shelter with Gray Wing, <b>Clear</b> <b>Sky</b> realizes that he was wrong about Thunder and invites him to join his group. Thunder quickly accepts the offer, but soon realizes that his father is too power-hungry and concentrated on the needs of the group over the individual and leaves.|$|E

5000|$|In 2002 President George W. Bush {{announced}} an environment legislative initiative titled <b>Clear</b> <b>Skies.</b> The <b>Clear</b> <b>Skies</b> proposal's stated goals were to reduce three pollutants: sulfur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, and mercury. <b>Clear</b> <b>Skies</b> {{was to use}} a market based system [...] by allowing energy companies to buy and trade pollution credits. The president argued that since <b>Clear</b> <b>Skies</b> would use a market based system, {{millions of tons of}} pollution would be eliminated when compared to the Clean Air Act. However, the president’s critics argued that the <b>Clear</b> <b>Skies</b> policy would weaken provisions in the Clean Air Act.|$|R

[...] The <b>Clear</b> <b>Skies</b> Act came about {{as the result of}} President Bush's <b>Clear</b> <b>Skies</b> Initiative.|$|R
5|$|The {{solar eclipse}} of March 20, 2015, {{was the first}} {{occurrence}} of an eclipse estimated to potentially {{have a significant impact}} on the power system, with the electricity sector taking measures to mitigate any impact. The continental Europe and Great Britain synchronous areas were estimated to have about 90 gigawatts of solar power and it was estimated that production would temporarily decrease by up to 34 GW compared to a <b>clear</b> <b>sky</b> day. The temperature may decrease by 3°C, and wind power potentially decreases as winds are reduced by 0.7m/s.|$|E
5|$|The first Wellington N2960 {{took off}} from RAF Mildenhall in Suffolk at 09:27 with Wing Commander Richard Kellett at the controls. No. 9 Squadron {{took off from}} the nearby RAF Honington and formed up over King's Lynn and started out over the North Sea. Feltwell's No. 37 Squadron took off but missed the {{rendezvous}} and {{caught up with the}} main formation an hour later over the North Sea. Once over the Wash they set a course of 040° true, as far as latitude 55°north. The plan was to avoid heavy anti-aircraft artillery concentrations on the Frisian Islands. However, as they left England the cloud broke and they found themselves without cover in a bright crystal <b>clear</b> <b>sky.</b> Two bombers, N2984 and N2894, piloted by Duguid and Kelly turned back; the first due to engine trouble, the other escorting the troubled bomber back to base. The remaining bombers flew north past the Frisian Islands then turned due south, continuing their mission in perfect visibility which made it easy to be spotted by German aircraft.|$|E
5|$|Three {{practice}} sessions—two on Friday and a {{third on}} Saturday—were held before the main Sunday race. The Friday afternoon and evening sessions each lasted ninety minutes. The third session was held on Saturday afternoon and lasted an hour. The first practice session was initially held on a wet track with a <b>clear</b> <b>sky</b> after rainstorms {{earlier in the day}} left standing water on parts of the circuit, and high humidity slowed the drying process. These conditions meant drivers used intermediate tyres first before dry tyres were utilised in the session's closing minutes. Webber set the fastest time of the first session with a late lap of 1 minute and 54.589 seconds, one-tenth of a second faster than Michael Schumacher in second who was briefly quickest before Webber set his lap. Adrian Sutil, with a lap of 1:58.827, was third fastest, ahead of Vettel and Jaime Alguersuari. Button, Vitantonio Liuzzi, Sébastien Buemi, Kubica, and Vitaly Petrov rounded out the session's top ten fastest drivers.|$|E
40|$|The 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments {{require the}} U. S. EPA to control mercury {{emission}} outputs from coal-burning power plants through implementation of MACT, Maximum Achievable Control Technology, standards. However, in 2003 the Bush Administration revealed an alternative and controversial regulatory strategy for mercury, developing a {{cap and trade}} emissions credit trading program under the <b>Clear</b> <b>Skies</b> Initiative. Although emissions trading was {{proven to be a}} successful regulatory strategy for sulfur dioxide through the 1992 Acid Rain Program, the uniquely dangerous properties of mercury make this market-based regulation risky for certain vulnerable segments of the population. Since its unveiling, the <b>Clear</b> <b>Skies</b> cap and trade approach has been criticized for being too industry-friendly and inadequately setting limits on mercury emissions. Current challenges to the <b>Clear</b> <b>Skies</b> approach to the regulation of mercury claim that not only is it illegal under the Clear Air Act, but that it inhibits innovation and undermines an international strategy to reduce anthropogenic mercury emissions. This thesis evaluates the critiques of <b>Clear</b> <b>Skies</b> and the reasoning given by the EPA in defense of the regulation. (cont.) Recent academic studies and a comparison case study with the Acid Rain Program are used to discuss the probable effects of <b>Clear</b> <b>Skies</b> on mercury reduction. The main questions addressed in the thesis are: 1) what is the motivation for <b>Clear</b> <b>Skies?</b> 2) what is the legal basis for the Initiative? 3) what are the potential failures of <b>Clear</b> <b>Skies</b> in protecting against mercury exposure? 4) what will be the resulting impact of <b>Clear</b> <b>Skies</b> on technological innovation? and 5) how does <b>Clear</b> <b>Skies</b> compare with international mercury reduction strategies?by Meghan Sweeney.

25|$|Radiation fog {{is formed}} by the cooling of land after sunset by {{infrared}} thermal radiation in calm conditions with a <b>clear</b> <b>sky.</b> The cooling ground then cools adjacent air by conduction, causing the air temperature to fall below the dew point, forming fog. In perfect calm, the fog layer can be less than a meter thick, but turbulence can promote a thicker layer. Radiation fogs occur at night, and usually doesn't last long after sunrise, but it can persist all day in the winter months especially in areas bounded by high ground. Radiation fog is most common in autumn and early winter. Examples of this phenomenon include the Tule fog.|$|E
25|$|Upon entry he {{was given}} the shikona or {{fighting}} name of Tokitenkū, a reference to Mongolia's <b>clear</b> <b>sky.</b> He began his career in July 2002, winning all of his first 22 official bouts and earning three consecutive division championships in the process. He was the third person to achieve the feat of three consecutive championships, and his 22 consecutive wins tied the record for fourth-highest, with only Jokoryu (27) and Itai and Tochiazuma (26) having a longer unbeaten run upon entering professional sumo. He progressed to the second highest jūryō division in March 2004 and, just two tournaments later, to the top makuuchi division. It took him only 12 tournaments from his professional debut to make the top division, which at the time was the equal-fastest rise since the format of six tournaments per year was introduced in 1958.|$|E
25|$|It {{was during}} this period {{that some of the}} more {{important}} production companies first came into being, notably Mingxing ("Star") and the Shaw brothers' Tianyi ("Unique"). Mingxing, founded by Zheng Zhengqiu and Zhang Shichuan in 1922, initially focused on comic shorts, including the oldest surviving complete Chinese film, Laborer's Love (1922). This soon shifted, however, to feature-length films and family dramas including Orphan Rescues Grandfather (1923). Meanwhile, Tianyi shifted their model towards folklore dramas, and also pushed into foreign markets; their film White Snake (1926) proved a typical example of their success in the Chinese communities of Southeast Asia. In 1931, the first Chinese sound film Sing-Song Girl Red Peony was made, the product of a cooperation between the Mingxing Film Company's image production and Pathé Frères's sound technology. However, the sound was disc-recorded, and the first sound-on-film talkie made in China was either Spring on Stage (歌場春色) by Tianyi, or <b>Clear</b> <b>Sky</b> After Storm by Great China Studio and Jinan Studio.|$|E

As the Stanton {{children}} walk home, Miss Greythorne (Frances Conroy), the local mistress of the Manor, and her Butler Merriman Lyon (Ian McShane) invite the siblings to a Christmas party. Later, two farmers, Dawson (James Cosmo) and Old George (Jim Piddock), whom Will does not know, arrive at his house with a large Christmas tree ordered by the family. The farmers know Will’s name, wish him a happy birthday, and predict a storm despite the relatively <b>clear</b> <b>sky.</b> Will’s birthday {{is so close to}} Christmas that everyone in his large family ignores it except for his little sister Gwen (Emma Lockhart), who gives him his only birthday present (a Casio G-Shock Mudman wristwatch). The family has moved from the United States to a small English village and one of his brothers has arrived home for the holidays and displaces Will to the attic. For a Christmas present, Will buys Gwen an enigmatic stone pendant at the local mall. Two suspicious security guards accuse him of shoplifting and take him to their office. Alarmingly, as they question Will under the room's flickering lights, the guards metamorphose into rooks. They attack Will, but he manages to escape, accidentally using his powers for the first time. Will begins to experience more odd incidents and receives a strange and Celtic-looking belt from his oldest brother, Stephen (Jordan J. Dale).|$|E
25|$|Faced by {{a period}} of bad weather {{endangering}} the harvest during one early spring, King Numa resorted to the scheme of asking {{the advice of the}} god by evoking his presence. He succeeded through the help of Picus and Faunus, whom he had imprisoned by making them drunk. The two gods (with a charm) evoked Jupiter, who was forced to come down to earth at the Aventine (hence named Iuppiter Elicius, according to Ovid). After Numa skilfully avoided the requests of the god for human sacrifices, Jupiter agreed to his request to know how lightning bolts are averted, asking only for the substitutions Numa had mentioned: an onion bulb, hairs and a fish. Moreover, Jupiter promised that at the sunrise of the following day he would give to Numa and the Roman people pawns of the imperium. The following day, after throwing three lightning bolts across a <b>clear</b> <b>sky,</b> Jupiter sent down from heaven a shield. Since this shield had no angles, Numa named it ancile; because in it resided the fate of the imperium, he had many copies made of it to disguise the real one. He asked the smith Mamurius Veturius to make the copies, and gave them to the Salii. As his only reward, Mamurius expressed the wish that his name be sung in the last of their carmina. Plutarch gives a slightly different version of the story, writing that the cause of the miraculous drop of the shield was a plague and not linking it with the Roman imperium.|$|E
