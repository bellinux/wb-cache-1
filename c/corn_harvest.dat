When the federal government imposed an excise tax on whiskey, Western Pennsylvania farmers felt victimized, leading to the Whiskey Rebellion in 1794.

5|$|Five {{individuals}} died in maritime {{accidents involving}} {{at least one}} catamaran. There was an accident involving a bus carrying evacuees, killing four people on board. Three people died on the offshore Ambergris Caye. Overall, 19 people perished in the country. Several injuries, mainly from flying debris, were reported in San Pedro, and there were 142 people who were injured in the storm. Throughout the country, approximately 3,279 homes were either damaged or destroyed. The damage total from Keith was initially estimated at $200 million, about half of which to tourism facilities; the remainder was roughly split between crop and infrastructure damage. About 75% of the crops in the country were damaged, including much of the <b>corn</b> <b>harvest</b> that was expected to begin in October.

5|$|While {{moving through}} the Philippines, Chanchu {{affected}} several islands with strong winds and heavy rainfall. In Legazpi, Albay, strong waves wrecked 100homes and left 1,500people homeless. High winds left widespread power outages, particularly in Mindoro, Batangas, and across the Bicol Region. The storm severely damaged the banana industry and affected various other fruit crops. Near Metro Manila, the winds damaged billboards, knocked over trees, and caused isolated power outages. Rough seas sank a ferry off Masbate, despite a warning against the operation of small craft, having left at sunrise to avoid the police. The Coast Guard rescued 18passengers, but 28people died in the wreck. An empty ferry sank at port in Tabaco. A ferry with 700people aboard went missing, but the Coast Guard found it washed ashore with everyone safe on board. Similarly, an oil tanker washed ashore at Pinamalayan, Oriental Mindoro, and its crew of 13 was rescued. Throughout the country, Chanchu killed 41people, mostly from the Masabate ferry wreck. The storm damaged 5,630homes, and destroyed 1,013others, forcing 53,307people to leave their homes. Agricultural losses totaled ₱71.57million (PHP, $1.3million USD), chiefly to the <b>corn</b> <b>harvest,</b> with an additional ₱46million (PHP, $850,000 USD) in infrastructure damage.|$|E
40|$|Whole-plant <b>corn</b> was <b>harvested</b> at early dent, quarter milkline, two-thirds milkline, {{and black}} layer stages to {{evaluate}} the effects of maturity on intake, digestion, and milk production when corn was fed as silage in the diet. Twenty multiparous Holstein cows were used in a replicated experiment with a 4 × 4 Latin square design with 28 -d periods. Diets containing 50 % forage (67 % corn silage and 33 % alfalfa silage) and 50 % concentrate (dry matter basis) were fed as total mixed rations. Moisture contents were 69. 9, 67. 6, 64. 9, and 58. 0 % for silages from <b>corn</b> <b>harvested</b> at early dent, quarter milkline, two-thirds milkline, and black layer stages, respectively. Intakes of dry matter were similar across the four treatments and ranged from 3. 73 to 3. 79 % of body weight. Milk production was highest (33. 4 kg/d) for cows fed silage from <b>corn</b> <b>harvested</b> at the two-thirds milkline stage and lowest (32. 4 kg/d) for cows fed silage from <b>corn</b> <b>harvested</b> at the early dent stage. Milk protein production was highest for cows fed silage from <b>corn</b> <b>harvested</b> at the two-thirds milkline stage (1. 17 vs. 1. 12 to 1. 13 kg/d). Apparent total tract digestion of dry matter, organic matter, crude protein, acid detergent fiber, and starch was lowest for cows fed silage from <b>corn</b> <b>harvested</b> at the black layer stage. Although starch intake was similar for cows fed silage from <b>corn</b> <b>harvested</b> at the two-thirds milkline stage and for cows fed silage from <b>corn</b> <b>harvested</b> at the black layer stage (9 kg/d), intake of digestible starch was 0. 4 kg/d lower for cows fed silage from <b>corn</b> <b>harvested</b> at the black layer stage.

5|$|The Mikea {{live in a}} {{symbiotic}} relationship with the neighboring Masikoro farmers and herders, and the Vezo fishing clan. The Mikea live primarily on food scavenged from the forest but also grow seasonal crops. Their mobility and reliance on scavenging as opposed to crop growing shifts in response to changes in environmental and economic pressures on availability of resources within the Mikea {{community as well as}} those of their Vezo and Masikoro neighbors. The Mikea sell their forest products, as well as woven mats and food animals they raise, at weekly Vezo and Masikoro markets in nearby villages to obtain the necessities they cannot scavenge, such as clothing and medicine. Some Mikea migrate for periods of time to work in local villages or the town of Morombe. They are also hired to work for Vezo and Masikoro villagers, such as by cutting forest for villagers or other Mikeas' corn fields, or guarding villagers' zebu herds. They occasionally acquire one or more zebu in addition to or in lieu of payment, as these are seen as a form of wealth and are mainly sacrificed in ancestral ceremonies rather than eaten as food. The rainy season is the time when Mikea are most likely to leave their scavenging encampments for wage labor opportunities in villages or for the <b>corn</b> <b>harvest.</b> This is also the time when Masikoro and Vezo villagers are most likely to move into the forest to grow corn.|$|E

The blue mist, like memory in the eyes of a neglected wife, never goes from the wooded hill, and only at noon creeps from the near hedges. There is no bird to put a song in the throat of morning; only the crow's voice speaks during the day. Perhaps there is the regular breathing hush of the scythe—even the fretful jar of the mowing machine. But next day, in the morning, all is still again. The lying corn is wet, and when you have bound it, and lift the heavy sheaf to make the stook, the tresses of oats wreathe round each other and droop mournfully.|$|E
