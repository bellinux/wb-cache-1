Elements of construction and installation are discussed under the headings thermocouple current, fabrication, switch box fabrication, field installation of the cable and temperature readings. The principle of measurement is that the emf generated between a reference junction of known temperature and one of unknown temperature can give the unknown temperature. The two metals used are copper and <b>constantan,</b> and the wires must be protected electrically from short circuits. Twenty gauge duplex wire individually encased in polyvinyl chloride is satisfactory. The wires from the installation are usually terminated in a weatherproof switch box. Leeds and Northrup rotary switches, type 31 - 3 are used. Simple clamp type connectors and terminal blocks ensure positive connection. The copper wires are attached to rotary switches. The <b>constantan</b> wires are attached to a common <b>constantan</b> wire. The thermocouple cable's outer jacket is cut at the depths at which readings are required and the copper and <b>constantan</b> wires are soldered to give a thermocouple junction. The completed multi-wire cable is inserted in a suitable length of polyethylene hose. A lucite or brass plug seals the lower end. Steel switch boxes house the switches and wire connection from the elements and still provide accessibility for readings. The cable and switch box are filled with high quality transformer oil. Installation involves pushing the assembly into a bore hole {{or in the case}} of short cables, a test pit. Longer assemblies are usually lowered into bore holes with a 10 - 20 lb weight tied to the bottom. Finally the bore hole is backfilled so that no air pockets exist.

40|$|This {{research}} effort {{explored the}} possibility of using interwoven conductive and nonconductive fibers in a composite laminate for structural health monitoring (SHM). Traditional SHM systems utilize fiber optics, piezoelectrics, or detect defects by nondestructive test methods by use of sonar graphs or x-rays. However, these approaches are often expensive, time consuming and complicated. The primary objective of this research was to apply a resistance based method of structural health monitoring to a composite structure to determine structural integrity and presence of defects. The conductive properties of fiber such as carbon, copper, or <b>constantan</b> - a copper-nickel alloy - can be utilized as sensors within the structure. This allows the structure to provide feedback via electrical signals to a user which are essential for evaluating the health of the structure. In this research, the conductive fiber was made from <b>constantan</b> wire which was embedded within a composite laminate; whereas prepreg fiberglass, a nonconductive material, serves as the main structural element of the laminate. A composite laminate was constructed from four layers of TenCate 7781 “E” fiberglass and BT 250 E- 1 resin prepreg. Integrating the <b>constantan</b> within the composite laminate provides a sensory element which supplies measurements of structural behavior. Thus, with fiberglass, epoxy, and a <b>constantan</b> conductive element, a three-part composite laminate is developed. Test specimens used in this research were fabricated using a composite air press with the recommended manufacturer cure cycle. A TenCate BT 250 E- 1 Resin System and 7781 2 ̆ 2 E 2 ̆ 2 impregnated glass-fiber/epoxy weave was used. A <b>constantan</b> wire of 0. 01 ” gauge diameter was integrated into the composite structure. The composite laminate specimen with the integrated SHM system was tested under tensile and flexural loads employing test standards specified by ASTM D 3039 and D 7264, respectively. These test methods were modified to determine the behavior of the laminate in the elastic range only. A tension and flexural delamination test case was also developed to investigate the sensitivity of the SHM system to inherent defects. Moreover, material characteristic tests were completed to validate manufacturer provided material characteristics. The specimens were tested while varying the <b>constantan</b> configurations, such as the sensor length and orientation. A variety of techniques to integrate the sensor were also investigated. Two different measurement methods were used to determine strain. Strain measurements were made with Instron Bluehill 2 software and correlated to strain obtained by the structural health monitoring system {{with the use of a}} data acquisition code written to interact with a micro-ohm-meter. The experimental results showed good agreement between measurements made by the two different methods of measurement. Observations discovered that varying the length of the sensor element improved sensitivity, but resulted in different prediction models when compared to cases with less sensor length. The predictions are based on the gauge factor, which was determined for the each test case. This value provides the essential relationship between resistance and strain. Experiments proved that the measured gauge factor depended greatly on the sensor length and orientation. The correlation was of sufficient accuracy to predict strain values in a composite laminate without the use of any added tools or equipment besides the ohm-meter. Analytical solutions to the loading cases were developed to validate results obtained during experiments. The solutions were in good agreement with the experimental results...|$|E
40|$|Surface {{passivation}} plays a {{dual role}} of protecting copper (Cu) from getting oxidized {{and reducing the}} surface roughness of Cu thin film and thus enables low-temperature Cu-Cu bonding.

Systematically optimized ultrathin, <b>constantan</b> (2 nm) on Cu surface not only protected Cu from oxidation but also reduced the surface roughness to about 0. 7 nm, which led to Cu-Cu bonding at a temperature as low as 150 °C at 4 bar pressure.
