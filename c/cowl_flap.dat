5000|$|During {{the week}} of 15-22 April, no fewer than five 58th wing B-29s crashed near Karachi, all from {{overheated}} engines. The cause was traced {{to the design of}} the engine cowl flaps which controlled air flow over the cylinders. There were also problems with exhaust valves and valve guides on the engine. The B-29 was an advanced aeronautical design which had not been fully tested before being deployed overseas. The Wright 3350 tended to overheat partially due to reduced airflow over the rear cylinders due to restricted space caused by the <b>cowl</b> <b>flap</b> design. Additional complications leading to overheating were caused by operations in the tropical heat of India and by flying with maximum loads. The lower air pressures produced by the high ambient heat reduced lift and engine performance. The result was engine fires and crashes on take off.|$|E

40|$|A {{study of}} the data {{obtained}} in a flight investigation of an R- 2800 - 21 engine in a P- 47 G airplane was made {{to determine the effect}} of the flight variables on the engine cooling-air pressure distribution. The investigation consisted of level flights at altitudes from 5000 to 35, 000 feet for the normal range of engine and airplane operation. The data showed that the average engine front pressures ranged from 0. 73 to 0. 82 of the impact pressure (velocity head). The average engine rear pressures ranged from 0. 50 to 0. 55 of the impact pressure for closed <b>cowl</b> <b>flaps</b> and from 0. 10 to 0. 20 for full-open <b>cowl</b> <b>flaps.</b> In general, the highest front pressures were obtained {{at the bottom of the}} engine. The rear pressures for the rear-row cylinders were. lower and the pressure drops correspondingly higher than for the front-row cylinders. The rear-pressure distribution was materially affected by cowl-flap position in that the differences between the rear pressures of the front-row and rear-row cylinders markedly increased as the <b>cowl</b> <b>flaps</b> were opened. For full-open <b>cowl</b> <b>flaps,</b> the pressure drops across the rear-row cylinders were in the order of 0. 2 of the impact pressure greater than across the front-row cylinders. Propeller speed and altitude had little effect on the -coolingair pressure distribution, Increase in angle of inclination of the thrust axis decreased the front ?pressures for the cylinders at the top of the engine and increased them for the cylinders at the bottom of the engine. As more auxiliary air was taken from the engine cowling, the front pressures and, to a lesser extent, the rear pressures for the cylinders at the bottom of the engine decreased. No correlation existed between the cooling-air pressure-drop distribution and the cylinder-temperature distribution...|$|R

5000|$|Investigators {{with the}} Civil Aeronautics Board {{determined}} that the underlying cause of the accident was a single error made by the flight engineer. Stratocruiser engines were cooled by opening panels called [...] "cowl flaps" [...] or [...] "engine cooling flaps" [...] (also called [...] "cowl gills") which circled the rear part of the engine and allowed heat to dissipate when open. The open <b>cowl</b> <b>flaps</b> could also disrupt the flow of air over the wings and it was therefore necessary to close them during critical phases of flight such as takeoff when maximum lift was needed. When the captain during his pre-takeoff checklist called, [...] "Cowl flaps set for takeoff", the flight engineer replied [...] "Set for takeoff", but had not actually closed them. When the aircraft took off and the wing flaps were retracted, the loss of lift caused by the open engine <b>cowl</b> <b>flaps</b> caused the aircraft wings to partially stall. Tests performed by CAB investigators showed that a Stratocruiser that took off with all <b>cowl</b> <b>flaps</b> open would respond very similarly to a Stratocruiser with one engine shut down and could be turned and flown for some time before becoming too unstable {{to remain in the}} air. However, the captain was convinced that the problem had been caused by asymmetric wing flaps, a situation that would make all but the slightest turn dangerous, and decided to ditch based on that analysis.|$|R
