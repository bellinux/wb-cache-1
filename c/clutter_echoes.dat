5000|$|A related {{application}} of AGC is in radar systems, {{as a method}} of overcoming unwanted <b>clutter</b> <b>echoes.</b> This method relies on the fact that clutter returns far outnumber echoes from targets of interest. The receiver's gain is automatically adjusted to maintain a constant level of overall visible clutter. While this does not help detect targets masked by stronger surrounding clutter, it does help to distinguish strong target sources. In the past, radar AGC was electronically controlled and affected the gain of the entire radar receiver. As radars evolved, AGC became computer-software controlled, and affected the gain with greater granularity, in specific detection cells.Many radar countermeasures use a radar's AGC to fool it, by effectively [...] "drowning out" [...] the real signal with the spoof, as the AGC will regard the weaker, true signal as clutter relative to the strong spoof.|$|E

40|$|Because echoes {{caused by}} nonmeteorological targets {{significantly}} affect radar scans, contaminated bins must {{be identified and}} eliminated before precipitation can be quantitatively estimated from radar measurements.

It uses some statistics to highlight clutter characteristics (namely, shallow vertical extent, high spatial variability, and low radial velocities) to output a value that quantifies the possibility of each bin being affected by clutter (in order to remove those in which this factor exceeds a certain threshold).

When a severe clutter interference is expected, a specially designed doppler filter is needed to reject as much of the clutter as possible while enhancing the echo signal from a moving target. For this purpose, the optimum Moving Target Indication filter is described and a FORTRAN program to calculate the filter weights is presented. The frequency response of certain calculated filters is also analyzed. To implement these filters in a radar system, the optimum weights must be truncated to fit the finite word length of the radar's computer. The effect of truncation is analyzed for various degrees of truncation and various filter bandwidths. The filter's truncation errors are found to be within a tolerable limit for a typical level of truncation (sic.).

40|$|The {{major problem}} {{encountered}} by an airborne bistatic radar is {{the suppression of}} bistatic clutter. Unlike <b>clutter</b> <b>echoes</b> for a sidelooking airborne monostatic radar, bistatic <b>clutter</b> <b>echoes</b> are range dependent. Using training data from nearby range gates will result in widening of the clutter notch of STAP (space-time adaptive processing) processor. This will cause target returns from slow relative velocity aircraft to be suppressed or even go undetected. Some means of Doppler compensation for mitigating the clutter range dependency must be carried out. This thesis investigates {{the nature of the}} <b>clutter</b> <b>echoes</b> with different radar configurations. A novel Doppler compensation method using Doppler interpolation in the angle-Doppler domain and power correction for a JDL (joint domain localized) processor is proposed. Performing Doppler compensation in the Doppler domain, allows several different Doppler compensations to be carried out at the same time, using separate Doppler bins compensation. When using a JDL processor, a 2 -D Fourier transformation is required to transform space-time domain training data into angular-Doppler domain. Performing Doppler compensation in the spacetime domain requires Fourier transformations of the Doppler compensated training data to be carried out for every training range gate. The whole process is then repeated for every range gate under test. On the other hand, Fourier transformations of the training data are required only once for all range gates under test, when using Doppler interpolation. Before carrying out any Doppler compensation, the peak clutter Doppler frequency difference between the training range gate and the range gate under test, needs to be determined. A novel way of calculating the Doppler frequency difference that is robust to error in pre-known parameters is also proposed. Reducing the computational cost of the STAP processor has always been the desire of any reduced dimension processors such as the JDL processor. Two methods of further reducing the computational cost of the JDL processor are proposed. A tuned DFT algorithm allow the size of the clutter sample covariance matrix of the JDL processor to be reduced by a factor proportional to the number of array elements, without losses in processor performance. Using alternate Doppler bins selection allows computational cost reduction, but with performance loss outside the clutter notch region. Different systems parameters are also used to evaluate the performance of the Doppler interpolation process and the JDL processor. Both clutter range and Doppler ambiguity exist in radar systems operating in medium pulse repetitive frequency mode. When suppressing range ambiguous <b>clutter</b> <b>echoes,</b> performing Doppler compensation for the <b>clutter</b> <b>echoes</b> arriving from the nearest ambiguous range alone, appear to be sufficient. Clutter sample covariance matrix is estimated using training data from the range or time or both dimension. Investigations on the number of range and time training data required for the estimation process in both space-time and angular-Doppler domain are carried out. Due to error in the Doppler compensation process, a method of using the minimum amount of range training data is proposed. The number of training data required for different clutter sample covariance matrix sizes is also evaluated. For Doppler interpolation and power correction JDL processor, the number of Doppler bins used can be increased, {{to reduce the amount of}} training data required, while maintaining certain desirable processor performance characteristics...|$|E
40|$|In a high pulse-repetitive-frequency forward-looking radar, the <b>clutter</b> <b>echo</b> is {{not only}} {{severely}} rangedependent but also range-ambiguous. It is therefore difficult to realize clutter compensation and suppression for conventional Space-Time Adaptive Processing (STAP) radar. To alleviate this problem, in this study, a novel range-ambiguous clutter suppression method is proposed for STAP radar with Frequency Diverse Array (FDA). Because the transmit steering vector of the FDA is range-angle dependent, the range-ambiguous clutter can be separated in the spatial domain using a subspace projection approach. The separated clutter can then be compensated using the Doppler warping technique. Finally, the compensated clutter can be suppressed, and target detection is realized in both the unambiguous and ambiguous range regions.

Once fully deployed, this scheme will {{improve the quality of}} the radar base data by identification and removal of AP ground <b>clutter</b> <b>echoes.</b> The AP Ground Clutter Mitigation Scheme consists of two parts: the Radar Echo Classifier (REC) that is partially deployed within the Radar Product Generator (RPG) and the Clutter Mitigation Decision (CMD) that is under development for the Open Radar Data Acquisition (ORDA). The CMD is discussed in Dixon et al. (2005) at this conference. The Radar Echo Classifier (REC) (Kessinger et al, 2003) is a data fusion system that uses fuzzy-logic techniques to estimate the type of scatterer measured by the WSR- 88 D. The REC consists of three algorithms: the AP Detection Algorithm (APDA) classifies AP ground clutter return, the Precipitation Detection Algorithm (PDA) classifies precipitation regions, and the Sea Clutter Detection Algorithm (SCDA) classifies return from the ocean surface. The APDA is deployed within the RPG. Currently, the APDA is used as a quality control flag for the Enhanced Precipitation Preprocessing (EPRE) hydrological algorithm (O’Bannon and Ding, 2003) to remove ground clutter contamination during construction of the Hybrid Scan Reflectivity (HSR). The HSR is input into the radar-derived rainfall calculation. The PDA has been ported to the RPG Common Operating Development Environment (CODE) and modifications have been made to EPRE.

For the rain retrieval algorithm for the PR, {{it is needed}} to distinguish the rain <b>echo</b> and <b>clutter</b> to estimate the rain profile, because the algorithm need to correct the attenuation by rainfall throughout the profile (PR uses 13. 8 GHz and it is certainly attenuate in moderate to heavy rainfall) and the relatively high reflectivity <b>clutter</b> <b>echo</b> causes large error. The current algorithm tries to detect the clutter range for each ray by detecting the large change in radar echo around the earth surface range bin.
