500|$|Due to Bungie's {{commitment}} {{to the development of}} Halo 2 during I Love Bees run, they were unable to assist 42 Entertainment with story creation, and so the ARG's story is only tangentially related to the main Halo storyline. The events of I Love Bees were, therefore, originally not considered to be Halo canon. In a 2006 interview, however, Bungie's <b>content</b> <b>manager</b> Frank O'Connor expressly confirmed that I Love Bees is part of [...] "things that we embrace as canon." [...] References to elements of I Love Bees have since appeared in the 2006 Halo Graphic Novel and the 2009 Halo Encyclopedia, both of which are official canon.|$|E

500|$|In contrast, on 1UP.com, Parish {{argued in}} favor of Barret, noting that while on the surface he {{appeared}} to be the [...] "worst kind of stereotype," [...] he was a great character with complexity, having made [...] "difficult decisions in his life, and agonized over his losses." [...] Parish went further to describe Barret as the [...] "first true father figure the [...] series had ever seen," [...] noting his relationship with his adopted daughter. RPGamer's <b>content</b> <b>manager</b> Shawn Bruckner took the discussion further, arguing that claims of Barret's presentation being racist was oversimplification of the character's portrayal, and stated that while he was in some aspects a stereotype, in others, such as his compassion towards his daughter or guilt regarding his past actions, he was not. He added that Barret [...] "shows us that a black man speaking in 'ebonics' is not something to fear," [...] and that his portrayal was not racist, but instead the opposite.|$|E

In addition, 343 Industries aimed for [...] "a more complete connectivity between all of their future media than before"; relating Halo 4s story to the Forerunner Saga and Kilo-Five Trilogy novels as well as using terminals in Halo: Combat Evolved Anniversary to introduce background knowledge on the Forerunners.|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with MTV, Halo developer Bungie's former <b>content</b> <b>manager</b> Frank O'Connor said that {{the inclusion of the}} Arbiter as a playable character in Halo2 {{was supposed to be a}} [...] "secret on the scale of a Shyamalan plot twist" [...] and explains that Bungie was able to keep the public uninformed about this until the game's release, to the point that O'Connor never even considered including it on the weekly development updates posted at Bungie's webpage. O'Connor also stated that Bungie [...] "had some other things that were secrets within secrets" [...] and claimed that there was material related to the Arbiter that was kept secret during the development of Halo3 because [...] "There is an aspect of the Arbiter's character that is still secret to this day and will remain so for a good reason." [...] Story director Joseph Staten said that the purpose of introducing the Arbiter was [...] "to offer another, compelling point of view on a war where telling friend from foe wasn't always clear-cut. We knew we had a trilogy on our hands, so we were looking past the shock of playing as the enemy [...] ".|$|E

I think it completely warrants the Assassin's Creed IV moniker, not only with the new name and setting, but the attitude and the tone of the experience." [...] Assassin's Creed IV is the first main series numbered title to carry a subtitle, a decision which Myhill says was made to clearly distinguish the pirate theme {{from the rest of the}} franchise.|$|E
