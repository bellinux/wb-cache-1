The expansion ratio, water absorption index, a cooking degree and the organoleptic assessment were tested with the standard methods for pasta products. The microstructure was characterised by SEM microscopy technique at different magnifications. The processing parameters (like, a screw rpm and a moisture content of raw materials) estab-lished some physical properties and the microstructure of the pasta products processed on a modified single screw extrusion-cooker TS- 45. The addition of functional components like salt, egg powder, disodium orthophosphate, methylcellulose and ascorbic acid had a strong effect on the surface and the interior structure of products as well as dried precooked pasta quality. The best results associated with the uniform and compact structure of pasta products and excellent quality were obtained at processing a flour mixture enriched with a methylcellulose additive at 80 – 100 rpm and at 80 – 95 °C temperature range...|$|E

The control group (NDC) was fed with a standard diet, while T 2 DM was induced in the rats belonging to the other three groups by a high-fat diet followed by a streptozotocin (STZ) injection. The T 2 DM rats were further divided into a T 2 DM control group (DC), which was fed with the normal diet containing 50 % <b>common</b> <b>wheat</b> <b>flour,</b> a high dose SGW group (HGW) fed with a diet containing 50 % SGW flour, and a low dose SGW group (LGW) fed with a diet containing 25 % SGW flour and 25 % <b>common</b> <b>wheat</b> <b>flour.</b> Our results showed that SGW contained cereal antioxidants, particularly high in flavonoids and anthocyanins (46. 14 ± 1. 80 mg GAE/ 100 g DW and 1. 73 ± 0. 14 mg CGE/ 100 g DW, respectively). Furthermore, SGW exhibited a strong antioxidant activity in vitro (30. 33 ± 2. 66 μg TE/g DW, p < 0. 01). Administration of the SGW at a high and low dose showed significant down-regulatory effects on fasting blood glucose (decreasing by 11. 3 % and 7. 0 %, respectively), insulin levels (decreasing by 12. 3 % and 9. 7 %, respectively), and lipid status (decreasing by 9. 1 % and 7. 5 %, respectively) in T 2 DM rats (p < 0. 01).

40|$|Master of ScienceFood Science InstituteKaren SchmidtFlour is {{essential}} to bread production as it provides structure, texture, and flavor. The most <b>common,</b> <b>wheat</b> <b>flour,</b> is unique compared to other cereal flours as it forms gluten {{that is capable of}} forming viscoelastic dough, which retains gas produced during fermentation and helps create cohesive dough, all of which are critical to bread development. However, a certain percentage of the population has a rare autoimmune disorder, celiac disease, which is triggered by gluten. A gluten-free diet is the only remedy for celiac disease. Traditionally, in gluten-free breads, hydrocolloids, or gums have been used to mimic the behavior of gluten. However, the lack of a protein structure in breads made with hydrocolloids leads to an almost batter-like viscosity. Therefore, research has focused on gluten-free alternatives, particularly non-wheat cereal proteins that can be altered to mimic gluten’s dough forming properties. For example, zein has an average molecular weight and larger peptides than gluten, which contribute to its hydrophobic behavior. In fact, zein from maize flour is an ideal alternative as it can be manipulated to behave like gluten under certain conditions. The main difference between gluten and zein is that zein does not exhibit a large disulfide-linked polymer. Zein is also more hydrophobic than gluten. However, zein has been found to exhibit viscoelastic properties similar to gluten’s at temperatures higher than its glass transition. Other research has found the secondary structure of zein, in particular the β-sheet structure, increases at temperatures above its glass transition. This suggests that temperature and shear are not the only factors necessary to form and maintain the viscoelastic properties of zein; apparently, the β-sheet structures also affect viscoelasticity. Finally, differences such as maize variety and particle size also affect the properties of zein in bakery applications...|$|E
40|$|AbstractOver {{the past}} decade due to the changed climate in the Mediterranean region, {{technological}} quality of Triticum aestivum wheat has varied extremely. The effect of changed climate conditions was demonstrated in a directly (drought, temperature stress, increased rainfall) and indirectly manner (development of pest-field molds and insects). The wheat bug damaged kernels have become a characteristic phenomenon in recent years. The degree of wheat protein damage {{is influenced by the}} intensity of wheat bug attack and plant development stage in which the attack takes place. In certain years, wheat harvested in Serbia had very poor technological quality and used additives have not given the desired results. Therefore, a need to find some other possible solutions arose. Since in Serbia durum flour is readily available in the market, it could be used as improvement agent in bread making. Moreover, its novel use would reduce the price of a durum wheat processing products. Therefore, the chemical composition of soft wheat and durum <b>wheat</b> <b>flour</b> samples was investigated. Rheological properties of all raw materials were determined using Farinograph, Extensograph, Amylograph and Alveograph. The baking tests based on durum and <b>common</b> <b>wheat</b> <b>flours</b> were conducted. Also, the volumes of obtained breads were measured and sensory evaluation was performed. Results of the chemical composition and dough rheological properties of tested flour samples showed that they differ in terms of bread baking properties. Comparison of bread made from <b>wheat</b> <b>flour</b> characterized by damaged protein structure, bread made from <b>wheat</b> <b>flour</b> with damaged protein structure and with 50 % of <b>wheat</b> <b>flour</b> having excellent quality and bread made from <b>wheat</b> <b>flour</b> with damaged protein structure with 50 % of durum flour, revealed that only the addition of durum flour resulted in the bread of appropriate coherent structure and of adequate sensory quality...|$|R

A total of 26 flours, two blends from an industrial mill and 24 single-cultivar flours collected over three different years of grain production (from 2013 to 2015) and cultivar grain hardness (from soft to hard) were used {{in a wide range of}} protein content (from 9. 0 to 16. 2 %) and values of Chopin’s alveograph parameters (as indexes of gluten characteristics), i. e., P (from 27 to 160 mm), L (from 32 to 236 mm), P/L (from 0. 13 to 4. 44), and W (from 63 to 398). The same plasticization recipe and filming procedure was adopted for all manufactures. The maximum tensile strength (max) and the elongation at break (εmax), as well as the elastic modulus (E), stiffness (k) and energy at break (wb) of films from flours having moderate to high values of P (> 60 mm), P/L (≥ 0. 43) and W (> 170) were positively correlated to P and negatively correlated to P/L and W, with all the variables significant (p-value < 0. 05) and R 2 = 0. 72 for max, 0. 62 for εmax, 0. 81 for E, 0. 83 for k and 0. 72 for wb.

Simultaneous replacement of maize flour samples by R and WF at 40  % significantly modified textural profile, crumb grain features and firming kinetics, and free polyphenol pattern of breads thereof compared to the respective Y or W maize counterparts. Bigger specific volume (+ 28  % Y-R-WF, + 36  % W-R-WF), softer crumb bread (− 64  % Y-R-WF, W-R-WF), more aerated structure and homogeneous crumb grain, and lower and slower staling kinetics are observed in composite Y and W maize-based breads, respectively. Nutritional information on maize-based blended breads showed most appealing nutritional quality than WF breads, in terms of lower digestible starch (up to − 21  % in Y-R-WF, W-R-WF, WR) and rapidly digestible starch (up to − 37  % in W-R-WF), higher slowly digestible starch (up to three times in WR) and resistant starch contents (from five to six times in Y-R-WF, W-R-WF, W-R, Y-R) of medium-high sensorially rated bread matrices. All single and blended maize-based breads can be labelled as high-fibre breads (6  g dietary fibre (DF) / 100  g food). According to health-related benefits and prebiotic dosage of resistant starch a daily intake of 100  g of single Y-R, W-R, W-R-WF and W-R-WF provides enough resistant starch to positively affect postprandial glucose and insulin levels, while 170  g covers the amount necessary to enhance health.

Pasting properties of waxy <b>wheat</b> <b>flours</b> {{as well as}} factors governing the pasting properties were investigated. Waxy wheat starch granules swelled more extensively and were more prone to α-amylase degradation than normal wheat starch. A combination of endogenous α-amylase activity and protein matrix contributed to a large variation of pasting properties of waxy <b>wheat</b> <b>flours.</b> Bi-axial extension properties classified dough from waxy wheat as in-elastic. Waxy <b>wheat</b> <b>flour</b> had higher water absorption and lower mixing time than normal <b>wheat</b> <b>flour.</b> Waxy <b>wheat</b> starch affected protein hydration but not protein extractability after optimum dough mixing. Presence of some non-protein free thiol contents and some gliadins acting as chain terminators could be the underlying reasons for waxy <b>wheat</b> <b>flours</b> producing slack dough. In an effort to improve functionality of waxy <b>wheat</b> <b>flours,</b> hydro-thermal processing was used. Two temperatures (140 and 160 °C), three moisture contents (0, 12. 4 and 20 %), and four exposure times (0, 5, 15, 30 and 60 min) were employed. Hydrothermal processing resulted in non-cohesive waxy <b>wheat</b> <b>flours</b> with high viscosity and greater acid stability than native waxy <b>wheat</b> <b>flour.</b> A closer investigation revealed the possible role of endosperm proteins in improving pasting properties of waxy <b>wheat</b> <b>flours.</b> Upon thermal processing, waxy <b>wheat</b> <b>flours</b> demonstrated a long hydration time before forming dough.

40|$|Among all cereals, wheat is {{the most}} {{abundant}} food crop worldwide. Wheat is commonly milled to <b>wheat</b> <b>flour</b> which could be further treated by other chemical methods depending on its utilisation. There are more than thousands bakery products using <b>wheat</b> <b>flour</b> as the main ingredient around the world. However, the most important use of <b>wheat</b> <b>flour</b> is for bread (Kokelaar, 1994). Due to its viscoelastic behaviour, which is not yet fully understood <b>wheat</b> <b>flour</b> doughs are complex systems that create great challenges in process engineering and product development research. Szczesniak (1988) gives the most striking definition of dough [...] 'it is alive' [...] referring to its condition of a dynamic system continually changing due to physical and chemical factors. Many scientists are interested in <b>wheat</b> <b>flour</b> dough rheology because <b>wheat</b> <b>flour</b> dough is unique and different from other flour doughs. Also, during breadmaking, dough undergoes different type of deformation in every phase of the conversion of <b>wheat</b> <b>flour</b> into baked products. During mixing, dough is subjected to extreme deformations that may exceed its rupture limit. During sheeting, fermentation, proofing, shaping and baking, the properties of wheat dough vary largely (Hoseney, 1986). All of these changes affect the final quality of baking products. If the rheological properties of <b>wheat</b> <b>flour</b> dough were fully understood it would facilitate quality control of baking products and improvement of the bread making process...|$|R

Sweetpotato can replace up to 40 % of the wheat in many bakery products. This can lower firm production costs, save a country foreign exchange, and increase rural farmers' incomes. We produced bread, biscuits, queen cakes and doughnuts {{in a commercial}} bakery, using different combinations of ingredients as follows: <b>wheat</b> <b>flour</b> only; a mixture of <b>wheat</b> <b>flour</b> and orange-flesh sweetpotato (OFSP) flour; and, a mixture of <b>wheat</b> <b>flour</b> and OFSP puree. The products were then subjected to sensory testing, using 120 consumer panelists drawn from a rural primary school, an urban girls' secondary school, and a university. Each of the testers was given a sample of each product marked with a circle, diamond, or square. We used means t-tests and ordered-logit to analyze the evaluations. The results showed that bread made out of a mix of 30 % OFSP puree and 70 % <b>wheat</b> <b>flour</b> was preferred to that made of 100 % <b>wheat</b> <b>flour.</b> Consumers showed no preference between doughnuts and queen cakes made from 100 % <b>wheat</b> <b>flour</b> and those made from a mix of 60 % <b>wheat</b> <b>flour</b> and 40 % OFSP puree.
