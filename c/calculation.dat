5|$|In 1975, Stephen Hawking {{published}} a <b>calculation</b> which suggested that black holes {{are not completely}} black but emit a dim radiation due to quantum effects near the event horizon. At first, Hawking's result posed a problem for theorists because it suggested that black holes destroy information. More precisely, Hawking's <b>calculation</b> seemed to conflict {{with one of the}} basic postulates of quantum mechanics, which states that physical systems evolve in time according to the Schrödinger equation. This property is usually referred to as unitarity of time evolution.

5|$|In {{addition}} to its applications in enumerative geometry, mirror symmetry is a fundamental tool for doing <b>calculations</b> in string theory. In the A-model of topological string theory, physically interesting quantities are {{expressed in terms of}} infinitely many numbers called Gromov–Witten invariants, which are extremely difficult to compute. In the B-model, the <b>calculations</b> can be reduced to classical integrals and are much easier. By applying mirror symmetry, theorists can translate difficult <b>calculations</b> in the A-model into equivalent but technically easier <b>calculations</b> in the B-model. These <b>calculations</b> are then used to determine the probabilities of various physical processes in string theory. Mirror symmetry can be combined with other dualities to translate <b>calculations</b> in one theory into equivalent <b>calculations</b> in a different theory. By outsourcing <b>calculations</b> to different theories in this way, theorists can calculate quantities that are impossible to calculate without the use of dualities.|$|R
