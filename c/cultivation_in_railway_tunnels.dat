30|$|This paper {{deals with}} the theory and {{calculation}} methods for compensation of the gradient <b>in</b> <b>railway</b> <b>tunnels</b> through theoretical analysis, numerical calculation, and statistic regression methods. On {{the basis of the}} principle that the resultant force is zero, the formula of the maximum calculated gradient was derived for the freight and passenger line and high-speed passenger special line. The formula of aerodynamic drag in tunnel is provided using the domestic and foreign relevant experimental investigations, and revised with modern train and engineering parameters. A calculation model of aerodynamic drag when the train goes through a single-tracked tunnel was built. Finally, the concept of maximum calculated gradient was adopted to revise the formula for compensation of the gradient <b>in</b> <b>railway</b> <b>tunnels.</b>|$|R

40|$|The Railway {{transport}} system is experimenting a deep transformation nowadays. The continuous technological evolution and the raising {{the standard of}} living of the population have led today to an increase in the volume of rail traffic, both referred to the passenger and freight transport. Despite railways being a statistically safe form of transportation (due to guidance per rails, professional drivers, etc.) rail accidents may still happen. Safety <b>in</b> <b>railway</b> infrastructure must be understood as the safe performance of their functions by the main components. From this perspective it denotes a growing interest in the issue of safety <b>in</b> <b>railway</b> <b>tunnels.</b> <b>In</b> particular, the analysis of the structural aspects of reliability and maintenance goes to correlate safety analysis. The papers aims to ensure a proper level of safety <b>in</b> <b>railway</b> <b>tunnels,</b> through the adoption of measures of prevention and protection finalized at the reduction of critical situations.

40|$|AbstractWater inrush and mud gushing {{are one of}} {{the biggest}} hazards in tunnel construction. Unfavorable {{geological}} sections can be observed <b>in</b> almost all <b>railway</b> <b>tunnels</b> under construction or to be constructed, and vary in extent. Furthermore, due to the different heights of mountains and the lengths of tunnels, the locations of the unfavorable geological sections cannot be fully determined before construction, which increases the risk of water inrush and mud gushing. Based on numerous cases of water inrush and mud gushing <b>in</b> <b>railway</b> <b>tunnels,</b> the paper tries to classify water inrush and mud gushing <b>in</b> <b>railway</b> <b>tunnels</b> <b>in</b> view of the conditions of the surrounding rocks and meteorological factors associated with tunnel excavation. In addition, the causes of water inrush and mud gushing in combination of macro- and micro-mechanisms are summarized, and site-specific treatment method is put forward. The treatment methods include choosing a method of advance geological forecast according to risk degrees of different sections in the tunnel, determining the items of predictions, and choosing the appropriate methods, i. e. draining-oriented method, blocking-oriented method or draining-and-blocking method. The treatment technologies of railway water inrush and mud gushing are also summarized, including energy relief and pressure relief technology, advance grouting technology, and advance jet grouting technology associated with their key technical features and applicable conditions. The results in terms of treatment methods can provide reference to the prevention and treatment of tunnel water inrush and mud gushing...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{physical}} and mathematical turbulence flow fields models {{are set up}} to numerically simulate <b>railway</b> <b>tunnel</b> fire and smoke flow. An experimental fire simulation results <b>in</b> <b>railway</b> <b>tunnel</b> indicate that the temperature distribution of laminar flame, the smoke concentration and flow velocity can be expressed by the fully developed smoke flow downwind. Through numerical simulation, it is concluded that the turbulent flow field models are better and have good consistency with the experimental results. The phenomenon of tunnel fire, the development and distribution of smoke flow can not only provide great support on the fire protecting and ventilation plan, but also give better reference to the pedestrian evacuation and the design of disaster prevention and mitigation...|$|R

25|$|The adult spiders are photophobic {{and live}} in places free from light, {{frequently}} in caves and tunnels, though they can sometimes be seen outside of caves and mines as they will emerge around dusk to hunt, often using a single silk lasso line and swinging down upon their prey. They are often found {{in areas that are}} frequented by bats. The spiders are most often observed <b>in</b> <b>railway</b> <b>tunnels</b> and mines since these {{are more likely to be}} visited by humans. The young spiders are, after several instars, (and in contrast to the adults) strongly attracted to light—probably an evolutionary adaptation which ensures the spread of the species to new areas (see Life cycle for further details).|$|R
50|$|The {{piston effect}} is very {{pronounced}} <b>in</b> <b>railway</b> <b>tunnels,</b> because the {{cross sectional area}} of train is large and almost completely fills the whole tunnel cross section. The wind felt by the passengers on underground train station platforms (that do not have platform screen doors installed) when a train is approaching is air flow from the piston effect. The effect is less pronounced in road vehicle tunnel, as the cross-sectional area of vehicle is small compared to the total cross-sectional area of the tunnel. Single track tunnels experience the maximum effect but clearance between rolling stock and the tunnel {{as well as the}} shape of the front of the train affect its strength.|$|R
