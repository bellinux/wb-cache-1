25|$|Berkey v. Third Avenue Railway, 244 N.Y. 84 (1926), the <b>corporate</b> <b>veil</b> {{cannot be}} pierced, even {{in favor of}} a tort victim unless {{domination}} of a subsidiary by the parent is complete.|$|E
25|$|The {{common law}} of tort also remains {{particularly}} relevant {{for the type of}} liability an employer has where there is scientific uncertainty about the cause of an injury. In asbestos disease cases, a worker may have been employed with at a number of jobs where he was exposed to asbestos, but his injury cannot with certainty be traced to any one. Although he may be able to sue all of them, a number may have already gone insolvent. In Fairchild v Glenhaven Funeral Services Ltd the House of Lords held that if any employer had materially increased the risk of harm to the worker, they could would be jointly and severally liable and could be sued for the full sum, leaving it up to them to seek contribution from others and thus the risk of other businesses' insolvency. For a brief period, in Barker v Corus the House of Lords then decided that employers would only be liable on a proportionate basis, thus throwing the risk of employers' insolvency back onto workers. Immediately Parliament passed the Compensation Act 2006 section 3 to reverse the decision on its facts. It has also been held in Chandler v Cape plc, in 2011, that even though a subsidiary company is the direct employer of a worker, a parent company will owe a duty of care. Thus shareholders {{may not be able to}} hide behind the <b>corporate</b> <b>veil</b> to escape their obligations for the health and safety of the workforce.|$|E

2500|$|On November 26, the Supreme Court {{accepted}} and consolidated {{the case with}} Conestoga Wood Specialties v. Sebelius. Two dozen amicus briefs support the government, and five dozen support the companies. American Freedom Law Center's brief argues that birth control harms women because men will only want them [...] "for the satisfaction of [...] own desires." [...] Another brief argues that the contraception rule leads to [...] "the maximization of sexual activity". Two of the briefs oppose {{each other on the}} constitutionality of the RFRA. Two briefs that do not formally take sides oppose each other on whether the right to religion applies to corporations. One of those briefs argues that if shareholders are separated by the <b>corporate</b> <b>veil</b> from corporate liabilities, then their religious values are also separate from the corporation. It mentions the ruling in Domino's Pizza, Inc. v. McDonald made against the African American owner of JWM Investments whose contracts were breached due to racial discrimination. The brief argues that if JWM Investments could not suffer discrimination through its owner, then Hobby Lobby could not suffer religious burden through its owner. Two briefs were filed by LGBT groups concerned that future anti-discrimination laws would be pre-emptively harmed if employers could claim to be religiously exempt.|$|E
2500|$|... {{also adds}} that, when an SE is incorporated, {{employees}} have the default right to retain all existing representation {{on the board}} of directors that they have, unless the negotiate by collective agreement a different or better plan than is provided for in existing member state law. Other than this, most important standards in a typical company law are left to member state law, so long as they comply with further minimum requirements in the company law directives. Duties owed by the board of directors to the company and its stakeholders, or the right to bring derivative claims to vindicate constitutional rights, are not generally regulated by EU law. Nor are rights of pre-emption to buy shares, nor rights of any party regarding claims by tort, contract or piercing the <b>corporate</b> <b>veil</b> to hold directors and shareholders accountable. However, Directives do require minimum rights on company formation, capital maintenance, accounting and audit, market regulation, board neutrality in a takeover bid, rules on mergers, and management of cross-border insolvency. The omission of minimum standards is important since the Court of Justice held in Centros that freedom of establishment requires companies operate in any member state they choose. This has been argued to risk a [...] "race to the bottom" [...] in standards, although the Court of Justice soon affirmed in Inspire Art that companies must still comply with proportionate requirements that are in the [...] "public interest".|$|E
5000|$|Piercing the <b>corporate</b> <b>veil</b> or {{lifting the}} <b>corporate</b> <b>veil</b> {{is a legal}} {{decision}} to treat the rights or duties of a corporation as the rights or liabilities of its shareholders. Usually a corporation is treated as a separate legal person, which is solely responsible for the debts it incurs and the sole beneficiary of the credit it is owed. Common law countries usually uphold this principle of separate personhood, but in exceptional situations may [...] "pierce" [...] or [...] "lift" [...] the <b>corporate</b> <b>veil.</b>|$|E

5000|$|When lawyers {{attempted}} to sue Pittson Company, the sole shareholder of the Buffalo mining company, they {{first had to}} pierce the <b>corporate</b> <b>veil.</b> Pittson's lawyers filed certain documents with the court to show that, as a shareholder, Pittson was not liable for the disaster because the Buffalo Mining Company was run independently. These documents were minutes of shareholders' and directors' meetings that Pittson's attorneys relied on in their argument that Pittson was a protected shareholder behind the <b>corporate</b> <b>veil.</b> The lawyers {{for the victims of}} Buffalo creek were able to pierce the <b>corporate</b> <b>veil</b> when they proved that none of these meetings [...] "had actually taken place." ...|$|E
