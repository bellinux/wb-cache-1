40|$|Taiwan’s Environmental Protection Administration (EPA) has {{enacted a}} food waste {{recycling}} policy since 2003 {{as an alternative}} of landfill and incineration for the final disposal of municipal solid waste. Recycled food waste is currently seen as a valuable material, especially when appropriate technology is developed. This paper conducts a cost/benefit analysis based on six cases of food waste composting plants in Taiwan, finding that (1) the composting of food waste may yield the most net benefit compared to other applications of today; (2) the production cost of compost ranges from NT$ 2897 – 23, 117 /tonne; (3) the adoption of more automatic technology may reduce operation costs and, thus, a <b>closed</b> <b>composting</b> system with mechanical aeration may be more cost effective; (4) the output is a determinant of affecting production costs and private firms are more competitive in production costs than government-affiliated composting units; (5) all of the government-affiliated composting units face a negative profit and thus {{they are required to}} make use of the market value of the produced compost to achieve economic viability; and (6) a subsidy to the compost producer is needed to expand the market demand as the food waste recycled can save the disposal cost of municipal solid waste (MSW) incineration...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of the present studies was to explore the possibility of employing composting as a mean of sewage sludge stabilization. A series of composting experiments were performed using dewatered secondary activated sewage sludge from a domestic wastewater treatment plant in New Plymouth, New Zealand. These trials {{have been carried out}} treating the sludge in both open and <b>closed</b> <b>composting</b> systems on a laboratory scale. Two open system methods, one aerated windrow and one static pile, and three closed experiments using a compostumbler were performed. Throughout the whole study woodchips (in varying ratios) were used as a bulking agent. An initial moisture content of nearly 60 % in the sludge - woodchips mixture produced the highest degree of composting activity over a three week period. Biological drying during the process was indicated by an increase in total solids up to values between 17 % and 27 %. Partial stabilization of the organic fraction was indicated by a decrease in volatile solids of 28 % - 50 %. In two closed system trials a total carbon decrease of 26 % - 42 % was observed, serving as an additional indication {{that there had been a}} reduction in organic matter. Total nitrogen losses were substantial in all experiments. Reductions were in the range of 14 % - 58 % with the highest losses observed in the static pile experiment. Phosphorus was found to be stable with only minor concentration changes observed. Temperature development in the composting material followed the well known pattern, provided that the factors influencing the composting process were close to optimal. Temperatures approaching 70 °C in the initial stage of the process were measured. Bacteriological studies indicated, that the final composted product was not free from microbial hazard. In one closed system trial, however, no entero-streptococci were observed, indicating a complete inactivation of these indicator microorganisms. Ongoing development of the composting systems used, including improvements of methodologies employed is necessary in conducting further investigations...|$|E

50|$|In {{places where}} water {{hyacinth}} is invasive, overabundant, {{and in need}} of clearing away, these traits make it free for the harvesting, which makes it very useful as a source of organic matter for composting in organic farming in those locales, provided that the composting method properly handles it. As an aquatic plant, it requires most of the same composting principles as the seaweed that is <b>composted</b> <b>close</b> to sea coasts.|$|R
40|$|Abstract This paper {{describes}} an exploratory study of endotoxin emissions and dispersal from a commercial composting facility. Replicated samples of air {{were taken by}} filtration at different locations around the facility on 10 occasions. Measurements were made of endotoxin and associated culturable microorganisms. The inflammatory response of cell cultures exposed to extracts from the filters was measured. Endotoxin was detected in elevated concentrations <b>close</b> to <b>composting</b> activities. A secondary peak, of lesser magnitude than the peak at source was detected at 100 - 150 m downwind of the site boundary. Unexpectedly high concentrations of endotoxin were measured at the most distant downwind sampling point. Extracted endotoxin was found to stimulate human monocytes and a human lung epithelial cell line to produce significant amounts of pro-inflammatory cytokines. On a weight basis, endotoxin extracted from the composting source has a greater inflammatory cytokine inducing effect than commercial E. coli endotoxin. </p...|$|R
40|$|AbstractAerobic {{composting}} is {{a method}} for sanitary disposal of human feces as {{has been used in}} bio-toilet systems. As the composting method can be used at family in city to save water and to control water pollution, it would be favorable if the composting process could be controlled to improve biodegradation of organic matters and holding of N,P. In this study, batch experiments were conducted using a <b>closed</b> aerobic <b>composting</b> reactor with sawdust as the bulky matrix to simulate the condition of a bio-toilet for sanitary disposal of human feces. Attention was paid to the Biodegradation of organic matter and holding of N,P. Under a controlled condition of temperature at 60 °C, moisture content at 60 %, and continuous air supply, more than 70 % fecal organic mattres removal was obtained while merely 17 % fecal nitrogen loss without loss of P was observed in a two-week composting period. The nitrogen loss was found to occur mainly in the frst day with quick depletion of inorganic nitrogen and unchanged organic nitrogen content. The fecal NH 4 -N which was the main compoernent of the inorganic nitrogen (> 90 %) decreased quickly in the first day, gradually decreased in the following days, and finally disappeared. Thermophilic composting could be considered to keep more than 70 % fecal organic matters removal, decreasing fecal nitrogen loss, keep more organic nitrogen content without loss of P in the composts for well controling water pollution of lake, waterland or wetland...|$|R
40|$|Fur animal excreta, due {{to their}} high content of {{biogenic}} elements {{as well as the}} possibility of microbiological and parasitologic contamination, should not be applied directly as a fertilizer. The excreta properties can be improved in composting process. European Union legislation permits fertilization use of composted fur animal excreta. The aim of the research was to determine the dynamics of some heavy metals content (Fe, Mn and Ni) during the composting process of coypu and chinchilla excreta. Composted were excreta without additions (control) as well as excreta with 20 % and 40 % addition of leaves and straw. The composting process was conducted in PVC containers in a <b>closed</b> place. The <b>composting</b> lasted 25 weeks. During that time moisture of the materials was kept at a constant level, and every two weeks the materials were mixed for aeration purpose. Samples of the materials were taken after 11, 13, 15, 23 and 25 weeks of the composting process. Heavy metals content was determined by ICP-AES method. The heavy metals content in the examined composts was decreasing in order: Fe>Mn>Ni. While analyzing the heavy metals content in composts, as a rule the lowest content of elements was determined in composts with straw addition. Moreover, from among the three components used t...|$|R
40|$|Compost can {{increase}} soil water availability and nutrient uptake by plants, {{but it is}} not clear whether it can also improve the ability of plants to recover after drought stress. Tomato plants (Lycopersicon esculentum L.) were grown in sandy soil without compost or with compost either incorporated or mulched. There were two water treatments: (i) plants grown under sufficient water supply throughout the experiment and (ii) plants grown with sufficient water supply until day 33 after which water was withheld until stomatal conductance was <b>close</b> to zero. <b>Compost</b> addition increased water content at both field capacity and permanent wilting point, but only incorporated compost increased total available water. Compost addition increased shoot and root growth under well-watered and drought stressed conditions with a greater effect by incorporated compost. At sufficient water supply, the rates of photosynthesis and transpiration were similar in all treatments. Drought stressed plants with incorporated compost wilted earlier than control plants, whereas mulched compost increased water availability to plants and hence the number of days until wilting. Photosynthesis and transpiration recovered faster in plants grown with incorporated compost compared to other treatments. The rapid recovery of plants after drought with incorporated compost could be due to their greater root length. T. -T. Nguyen, S. Fuentes, P. Marschner[URL]...|$|R
40|$|The {{composting}} process {{like other}} waste management activities {{has the potential}} to generate large concentrations of bioaerosols which can be widely dispersed into the surrounding environment. There has been considerable interest in the literature of the effect of bioaerosols and in particular Aspergillus fumigatus on the health of plant operators and those living in <b>close</b> proximity to <b>composting</b> plants (Olver, 1994; Fischer et al., 1999; Fischer et al., 2000; Bunger et al., 200). Although bioaerosols can be generated through a range of operational procedures it has also been suggested that large numbers of Aspergillus fumigatus spores can be emitted from static compost piles through the action of natural air movements {{across the surface of the}} biodegrading material. Through the use of a portable wind tunnel apparatus researchers have determined the rate of emission of Aspergillus fumigatus spores as a result of air movement across the surface of the material (Taha et al., 2004; 2005; 2006 & 2007). The aim of this work was to use controlled laboratory experiments using compost samples and Aspergillus fumigatus spores to determine the sporulation rate of Aspergillus fumigatus. Using this data it would then be possible to verify whether bioaerosol emission rates from static compost windrows calculated and quoted in the literature can in fact be maintained over longer time periods. A series of experiments were carried out using Aspergillus fumigatus spores on agar plates and small samples of green waste compost to determine the number of spores that could be generated by each existing spore over a seven day period. From the experiments the sporulation rate determined from the agar plates varied with averages of either 4. 48 x 104 or 2. 83 spores/day depending upon the date set used and from the compost experiments it was 1. 33 spores/day. Using this data and making a number of assumptions for moisture content (50...|$|R
40|$|International audienceOne way {{to treat}} the organic wastes {{accordingly}} to the environmental policies is to develop biological treatment like composting. Nevertheless, this development largely relies {{on the quality of}} the final product and as a consequence {{on the quality of the}} biological activity during the treatment. Favourable conditions (oxygen concentration, temperature and moisture content) in the waste bed largely contribute to the establishment of a good aerobic biological activity and guarantee the organic matter stabilisation with limitation and control of odorous and greenhouse effect gaseous emissions. Several approaches (0 D biochemical reducing, see Pommier et al. 2007, effective 1 D modelling coupling transport and biochemical) have been made to understand the behaviour of such systems. In this paper we will present a 2 D numerical model using Darcy scale equations for heat and mass transport coupled with a biochemical reactive scheme. Then, we will solve that system (using experimental measurements on reactivity and transport coefficients) with a commercial code (COMSOL TM). The model described here is based on the biological model presented in Trémier et al 2005 coupled with an upscale transport model detailed in Hénon 2008 which takes into account the major components of the gas phase: N₂, O₂, CO₂ and also H₂O. This is a crucial point because of: - The reaction rate, depending on the moisture content (humidity comes from the initial condition of the sludge but also from the reactive scheme because reactions produce water), - heat content, very sensitive to the evaporation rate in the sludge. It has been shown in Pujol et al 2011 that the impact of drying could be important on the reactivity but also that the pseudo component air could not be sufficient to represent the drying in the sludge. The process studied was a <b>closed</b> reactor <b>composting</b> process (180 m³ rectangular box) with positive forced aeration. The air was blown from the bottom of the reactor, via two ventilation pipes. In the upper part of the reactor, air was sucked and led to a biofilter treatment system. The treated waste was a mixture of sewage sludge and bulking agent that was composted during four weeks without turning. Several informations were recorded during the treatment like temperature evolutions at different locations (see Henon et al. 2009 for more details about the temperature recording). We have validated this code by comparing the temperatures obtained through the simulations with those recorded during the experiments. After this step of validation and a discussion on final composition of the organic matter in the experiments compared to the ones estimated by simulations, we have used this numerical model as an optimization tool. Modifying the initial, boundary and operating conditions we have been able to determine the best conditions to this particular composting process. A whole set of conditions is discussed in the paper...|$|R
