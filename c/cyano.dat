5|$|Chromobacterium violaceum and Pseudomonas fluorescens {{can both}} {{mobilize}} solid copper as a cyanide compound. The ericoid mycorrhizal fungi associated with Calluna, Erica and Vaccinium can grow in metalliferous soils containing copper. The ectomycorrhizal fungus Suillus luteus protects young pine trees from copper toxicity. A {{sample of the}} fungus Aspergillus niger was found growing from gold mining solution and was found to contain <b>cyano</b> complexes of such metals as gold, silver, copper, iron, and zinc. The fungus also {{plays a role in}} the solubilization of heavy metal sulfides.|$|E
25|$|A cyanide is a {{chemical}} compound {{that contains the}} group CN. This group, known as the <b>cyano</b> group, consists of a carbon atom triple-bonded to a nitrogen atom.|$|E
25|$|Cyclotrimerization {{is often}} used to link {{tetrahedral}} monomers to create CMPs. CMPs that are synthesized via <b>cyano</b> cyclotrimerization exhibit narrow micropore size distribution, high enthalpies of H2 adsorption and fast selective gas adsorption.|$|E
25|$|The {{electronic}} {{properties of}} the substituents also influence {{the strength of the}} attraction. Electron withdrawing groups (for example, <b>cyano</b> CN) weaken the interaction, while electron donating substituents (for example, amino NH2) strengthen the cation–π binding. This relationship is illustrated quantitatively in the margin for several substituents.|$|E
25|$|The <b>cyano</b> {{group in}} HCN {{can add to}} the {{carbonyl}} group to form cyanohydrins, R−CH(OH)CN. In this reaction the CN− ion is the nucleophile that attacks the partially positive carbon atom of the carbonyl group. The mechanism involves a pair of electrons from the carbonyl group double bond transferring to the oxygen atom, leaving it single bonded to carbon and giving the oxygen atom a negative charge. This intermediate ion rapidly reacts with H+, such as from the HCN molecule, to form the alcohol group of the cyanohydrin.|$|E
25|$|Hydroxyflutamide and its analogues, {{bicalutamide}} and nilutamide, {{share an}} anilide ring structure. The structures {{can be seen}} in figure 7, where the anilide ring is coloured red. These three compounds require an electron-deficient aromatic ring for efficient AR binding. Replacing the anilide with an alkene gives weakly active compounds, which {{can be attributed to the}} lack of intramolecular hydrogen binding or to poor hydrogen-bond donor capability. Various combinations of electron-withdrawing substitutions in the aniline ring of these drugs have not shown higher binding to the AR receptor, compared to compounds which have a chloro or trifluoromethyl group at the meta position (R1) and either a <b>cyano</b> or nitrogen group at the para position (R2).|$|E
25|$|The final {{efforts were}} {{directed}} at placing methyl groups at position 5 and 15. With position 10 sufficiently shielded reaction with chloromethyl benzyl ether produced the di(chloromethyl) adduct which was further converted to the dithiophenyl compound 63 using thiophenol, isolation of which required thin layer chromatography. Desulfurisation took place with Raney nickel and the reduction reaction also opened the lactone ring to the carboxylic acid which was converted to the ester 64 by reaction with diazomethane. At this stage {{the number of}} isomers in the mixture was reduced by HPLC to just two with the racemic propionic acid ester group at C13 (ring C) remaining in 65. Reaction with sulfuric acid converted the <b>cyano</b> group to the amide group in 66, again destroying stereochemistry at C13. The correct isomer 67 (minor yield) was isolated again by HPLC.|$|E
25|$|B12 is {{the most}} {{chemically}} complex of all the vitamins. The structure of B12 {{is based on a}} corrin ring, which is similar to the porphyrin ring found in heme, chlorophyll, and cytochrome. The central metal ion is cobalt. Four of the six coordination sites are provided by the corrin ring, and a fifth by a dimethylbenzimidazole group. The sixth coordination site, the center of reactivity, is variable, being a <b>cyano</b> group (–CN), a hydroxyl group (–OH), a methyl group (–CH3) or a 5′-deoxyadenosyl group (here the C5′ atom of the deoxyribose forms the covalent bond with cobalt), respectively, to yield the four B12 forms mentioned below. Historically, the covalent C-Co bond {{is one of the first}} examples of carbon-metal bonds to be discovered in biology. The hydrogenases and, by necessity, enzymes associated with cobalt utilization, involve metal-carbon bonds.|$|E

2500|$|The {{involvement}} of the otherwise rare Cu(III) oxidation state has been demonstrated in the conjugate addition of the Gilman reagent to an enone: In a so-called rapid-injection NMR experiment at -100°C, the Gilman reagent Me2CuLi (stabilized by lithium iodide) was introduced to cyclohexenone (1) enabling the detection of the copper— alkene pi complex 2. On subsequent addition of trimethylsilyl cyanide the Cu(III) species 3 is formed (indefinitely stable at that temperature) and on increasing the temperature to -80°C the conjugate addition product 4. According to an accompanying in silico experiments [...] the Cu(III) intermediate has a square planar molecular geometry with the <b>cyano</b> group in cis orientation {{with respect to the}} cyclohexenyl methine group and anti-parallel to the methine proton. With other ligands than the <b>cyano</b> group this study predicts room temperature stable Cu(III) compounds.|$|E
2500|$|Anions end in o. [...] This {{replaces the}} final 'e' when the anion ends with '-ide', '-ate' or '-ite', e.g. {{chloride}} becomes chlorido and sulfate becomes sulfato. Formerly, '-ide' {{was changed to}} '-o' (e.g. chloro and <b>cyano),</b> but this rule has been modified in the 2005 IUPAC recommendations and the correct forms for these ligands are now chlorido and cyanido.|$|E
2500|$|Metal-catalyzed {{reactions}} of NO are not commonly synthetically useful. [...] Nitric oxide is however an important signalling molecule {{in nature and}} this fact {{is the basis of}} the most important applications of metal nitrosyls. The nitroprusside anion, 2−, a mixed nitrosyl <b>cyano</b> complex, has pharmaceutical applications as a slow release agent for NO. [...] The signalling function of NO is effected via its complexation to haeme proteins, where it binds in the bent geometry.|$|E
2500|$|Because of the cyanide anion's high nucleophilicity, <b>cyano</b> {{groups are}} readily {{introduced}} into organic molecules by displacement of a halide group (e.g., the chloride on methyl chloride). In general, organic cyanides are called nitriles. Thus, CH3CN {{can be called}} methyl cyanide but more commonly {{is referred to as}} acetonitrile.

2500|$|A cyanohydrin is a {{functional}} group found in organic compounds {{in which a}} <b>cyano</b> and a hydroxy group {{are attached to the}} same carbon atom.

2500|$|Bicalutamide has a <b>cyano</b> {{group at}} the para {{position}} instead of a nitro group like flutamide and nilutamide. This change in groups avoids the nitro reduction observed in nilutamide. Bicalutamide has a chiral carbon in its structure (labeled with an asterisk in figure 6), which {{is connected to the}} hydroxyl and methyl groups [...] It is therefore administered as a racemate. Post-approval investigation revealed that its antiandrogenic activity resides almost entirely in the (R)-enantiomer. (R)-bicalutamide has an almost fourfold higher affinity for the prostate AR than hydroxyflutamide and has a better side-effect profile compared to other antiandrogens.|$|E
2500|$|The {{core of the}} {{molecule}} vitamin B12 (cobalamin) is a corrin structure (depicted in red) with at its center a cobalt ion. Several vitamins exist with different cobalt ligands but the total synthesis concerned the one with a <b>cyano</b> ligand called cyanocobalamin. The corrin rim is lined with methyl groups (8) and lined with amide groups (6) linked through C1 and C2 spacers. [...] A seventh amide group is N-alkylated by a large tail consisting of an isopropanol group, a phosphate group, a ribose group and a dimethylbenzimidazole group. One of the nitrogen atoms on the imidazole is a fifth nitrogen ligand for the cobalt atom. A total of nine carbon atoms on the corrin frame are chiral, adding another challenge to the synthesis.|$|E
50|$|The {{hydrogenation}} of NTAN first converts a <b>cyano</b> group into an imino {{group which}} attacks a <b>cyano</b> group (which are adjacent and sterically suitable for forming a six-membered ring) {{rather than being}} further hydrogenated to the primary amino group.
