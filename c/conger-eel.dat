2500|$|In the Greek {{islands and}} on the coast, fresh fish and seafood (squid, octopus, and shellfish) were common. They were eaten locally but more often transported inland. Sardines and {{anchovies}} were regular fare for the citizens of Athens. They were sometimes sold fresh, but more frequently salted. A stele of the late 3rd century BC from the small Boeotian city of Akraiphia, on Lake Copais, provides us {{with a list of}} fish prices. The cheapest was skaren (probably parrotfish) whereas Atlantic bluefin tuna was three times as expensive. Common salt water fish were yellowfin tuna, red mullet, ray, swordfish or sturgeon, a delicacy which was eaten salted. Lake Copais itself was famous in all Greece for its eels, celebrated by the hero of The Acharnians. Other fresh water fish were pike-fish, carp and the less appreciated catfish. In classical Athens, eels, <b>conger-eels,</b> and sea-perch (...) were considered to be great delicacies, while sprats were cheap and readily available.|$|R

50|$|The silvery conger (Ariosoma anago) {{also known}} as the sea conger, the darkfin conger, the dark-finned <b>conger-eel,</b> or simply the conger eel, is an eel in the family Congridae (conger/garden eels). It was {{described}} by Coenraad Jacob Temminck and Hermann Schlegel in 1846, originally under the genus Conger. It is a tropical, marine eel which is known to dwell in sandy and muddy bottoms on coasts in the Indo-west Pacific. Males can reach a maximum total length of 60 centimetres.|$|E

(1) Mercury level in muscle exceeded the allowable line for marketable fish in 9 samples of Conger myriaster (<b>conger-eel,</b> ""maanago"") & Malakichthys griseus (""oomehata"") (0. 42 - 1. 40 ppm), whileranged from 0. 02 to 0. 07 ppm in Eteris carbunculus (""hamadai""), Coelorhynchus jordani (""kyushuhige"") and Cynogrossuls grandisquana (""akashitabirame""). (2) Mercury concentrations in the tissues ofconger-eel were highest in liver (1. 10 - 1. 27 ppm), and followed by muscle, stomach, intestine andpancreas in decreasing order. The contents of digestive organs contained mercury level similar tothat of the organs. (3) Most of mercury in the muscle of <b>conger-eel</b> was found in myofibrillar fraction.

Field experiments were conducted once a month from over a 6 month period from June 2011 to December 2011. The video camera successfully captured the following aspects of conge reel behavior: approaching the tube, entering the tube, feeding, escaping from the entrance, escaping from escape holes, and stealing bait. In addition, the video-camera also captured other fish species in the traps. The following responses were obtained when the footage was shown to fishermen: 'Just as I thought', 'Solved the mystery of how bait is stolen ' and 'Fish are intelligent 'The results clarified how the traps work and provided useful information on how the traps could be improved...|$|E
