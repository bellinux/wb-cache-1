50|$|A <b>conveyor</b> <b>furnace</b> uses a {{flexible}} metal belt to convey soil through the primary heating chamber. A one-inch-deep layer of soil is spread {{evenly over the}} belt. As the belt moves through the system, soil agitators lift the belt and turn the soil to enhance heat transfer and volatilization of organics. The <b>conveyor</b> <b>furnace</b> can heat soils to temperatures from 300 to 800 degrees F. At the higher temperature range, the <b>conveyor</b> <b>furnace</b> is more effective in treating some heavier petroleum hydrocarbons than are oil- or steam-heated thermal screws, asphalt plant aggregate dryers, and carbon steel rotary dryers. After the treated soil exits the <b>conveyor</b> <b>furnace,</b> it is sprayed with water for cooling and dust control.

40|$|Purpose: This paper {{shows that}} the laser micro-treatment of the silicon {{elements}} of solar cells with the different morphology of monocrystalline silicon, including the selective laser sintering of the front electrode to its surface using the CO 2 laser, improves the quality by minimising the resistance of a joint between the electrode and the substrate. The influence of the properties achieved for the front electrode on the electrical properties of solar cells was assessed. A front electrode of photovoltaic cells deposited by the traditional screen printing method and by co-firing in the infrared <b>conveyor</b> <b>furnace</b> was prepared for comparative purposes. Design/methodology/approach: The topography of front contacts subjected to selective laser sintering and co-firing in the infrared <b>conveyor</b> <b>furnace</b> was investigated using the scanning electron microscope with the energy dispersive X-ray (EDS) spectrometer for a microchemical analysis and with the confocal laser scanning microscope. Both, the surface topography and {{cross section of the}} front contacts was examined with the SEM microscope. The phase composition analyses of the selected front contacts were carried out using the XRD method. The front contacts were formed on the surface with the different morphologies of solar cells: textured ones with a coated antireflection layer, textured ones without a coated antireflection layer, non-textured ones with a coated antireflection layer and non-textured ones without a coated antireflection layer. An average size of pyramids was measured using the atomic force microscope (AFM). The resistance of the front electrodes was investigated using the Transmission Line Model (TLM). Findings: The following technological recommendations for the laser micro-treatment technology such as optimal paste composition, the power and scanning speed of the laser beam, the morphology of the silicon substrate to produce the front electrode of silicon solar cells, were selected experimentally in order to produce a uniformly melted structure, well adhering to the substrate, with the low resistance of the front electrode-to-substrate joint zone. Research limitations/implications: The contact resistance of front metallisation established depends on the paste composition, morphology of the silicon substrate as well as the co-firing and laser micro-treatment conditions.

40|$|The aim of {{the paper}} was to apply the newly {{developed}} instruments ‘Corescan ’ and ‘Sherescan ’ {{in order to measure}} the essential parameters of producing solar cells in comparison with the standard techniques. The standard technique named the Transmission Line Method (TLM) is one way to monitor contacting process to measure contact resistance locally between the substrate and metallization. Nowadays, contact resistance is measured over the whole photovoltaic cell using Corescanner instrument. The Sherescan device in comparison with standard devices gives a possibility to measure the sheet resistance of the emitter of silicon wafers and determine of both P/N recognition and metal resistance. The Screen Printing (SP) method is the most widely used contact formation technique for commercial silicon solar cells. The contact resistance of manufactured front metallization depends of both the paste composition and co-firing conditions. Screen printed front side metallization and next to co-fired in the infrared <b>conveyor</b> <b>furnace</b> was carried out at various temperature from 770 ◦C to 920 ◦C.

50|$|Typically, large ovens {{are used}} for the {{annealing}} process. The inside of the oven {{is large enough to}} place the workpiece in a position to receive maximum exposure to the circulating heated air. For high volume process annealing, gas fired <b>conveyor</b> <b>furnaces</b> are often used. For large workpieces or high quantity parts, car-bottom furnaces are used so workers can easily move the parts in and out. Once the annealing process is successfully completed, workpieces are sometimes left in the oven so the parts cool in a controllable way. While some workpieces are left in the oven to cool in a controlled fashion, other materials and alloys are removed from the oven. Once removed from the oven, the workpieces are often quickly cooled off in a process known as quench hardening. Typical methods of quench hardening materials involve media such as air, water, oil, or salt. Salt is used as a medium for quenching usually in the form of brine (salt water). Brine provides faster cooling rates than water. This is because when an object is quenched in water air bubbles form {{on the surface of the}} object reducing the surface area the water is in contact with. The salt in the brine reduces the formation of air bubbles on the object's surface, meaning there is a larger surface area of the object in contact with the water, providing faster cooling rates. Quench hardening is generally applicable to some ferrous alloys, but not copper alloys.|$|R

However, solar cell manufacturing cost (dollar/watt) is still substantially higher than fossil fuels. The route to lowering cost may not lie with continuing automation and economies of scale. Alternate fabrication processes with lower cost and environmental-sustainability coupled with self-reliance, simplicity, and affordability may lead to price compatibility with carbon-based fuels.

40|$|PM 304 is a NASA-developed {{composite}} powder metallurgy {{material that is}} being developed for high temperature applications such as bushings in high temperature industrial <b>furnace</b> <b>conveyor</b> systems. My goal this summer was to analyze and evaluate the effects that heat exposure had on the PM 304 material at 500 C and 650 C. The material is composed of Ni-Cr, Ag, Cr 2 O 3, and eutectic BaF 2 -CaF 2. PM 304 is designed to {{eliminate the need for}} oil based lubricants in high temperature applications, while reducing friction and wear. However, further investigation was needed to thoroughly examine the properties of PM 304. The effects of heat exposure on PM 304 bushings were investigated. This investigation was necessary due to the high temperatures that the material would be exposed to in a typical application. Each bushing was cut into eight sections. The specimens were heated to 500 C or 650 C for time intervals from 1 hr to 5, 000 hrs. Control specimens were kept at room temperature.

40|$|This work is {{focussed}} on a {{high carbon}} tool steel used {{for the production of}} files. The mechanical properties of the files depend on a hardening thermal treatment that produces a martensitic structure. Thus, the motivation for this work is technological: we want to understand the effects of two types of thermal treatment on the file's mechanical properties. The first is a traditional thermal treatment in a cyanide bath (CN), while the other is performed in a <b>conveyor</b> belt <b>furnace</b> (BF). The files resulting from BF treatment have sometimes a poorer performance. In order {{to improve the quality of}} BF files, we study the relationship between the mechanical properties and the microstructure resulting from a particular thermal treatment. Transmission electron microscopy does not reveal a change in the microstructure produced by different thermal treatments, yet it does permit visualization of the complex material microstructure, consisting of a martensitic matrix with embedded carbides. On the other hand, thermoelectric power measurements allow a differentiation between CN and BF files in a fast and non-destructive manner: the measurements performed on the whole files show that the thermopower of BF files is lower. This result is attributed to a higher concentration of carbon soluted in the martensitic matrix. The yield stress and compression strength determined by compression testing, as well as the hardness measured by nanoindentation, are higher for the bulk of BF files, emphasizing the importance of soluted carbon in hardening the martensite. The mobility of point defects and dislocations, and their interaction, are studied by mechanical spectroscopy. The martensitic structure is characterized by a rich internal friction spectrum comprising several overlapping relaxation and material transformation peaks. The internal friction measured at room temperature is related to an athermal background due to the interaction between soluted carbon and dislocations. This background is higher for BF files. The internal friction spectrum indicates that, upon heating above 375 K, the material structure irreversibly changes due to tempering processes. Tempering effects on the material are studied combining several experimental techniques. A first stage of tempering, observed by differential scanning calorimetry, starts around 375 K and is related to carbon precipitation in the form of transition carbides. At this temperature, the thermopower and Young's modulus increase, and the internal friction and hardness decrease, implying that all these quantities are sensitive to soluted carbon. The hardness continuously decreases with tempering and no precipitation hardening is observed. A second stage of tempering is observed around 525 K, leading to cementite precipitation. X-ray diffraction allows quantitative determination of the concentration of carbon in solid solution by measuring the tetragonality of the martensite lattice. The evolution of carbon content during tempering is compared to the evolution of internal friction and thermoelectric power revealing a strong correlation between these quantities. Internal friction measured at room temperature is directly proportional to the carbon content. The measurement of the concentration of carbon by X-ray diffraction is used to determine the variation of carbon content in the file profile. Thermopower measurements indicate that BF files have a lower concentration of carbon in the teeth than in the bulk, while the opposite is found for CN files. This is confirmed by X-ray diffraction. Moreover, diffraction performed on the very surface of the teeth reveals a lower carbon concentration in BF than in CN files teeth, which is probably the origin of their lesser performance. It can be concluded that the concentration of carbon in solid solution in martensite is responsible for the steel's hardness and therefore for its resistance to wear...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{technological}} advances in sensor and computer technology allow {{the observation of}} business and industrial processes at fairly high frequencies. For example, data used for monitoring critical parameters of industrial <b>furnaces,</b> <b>conveyor</b> belts or chemical processes may be sampled every minute or second. A high sampling rate is also possible in business related processes such as mail order distribution, fast food restaurant operations, and electronic commerce. Data obtained from frequently monitored business processes {{are likely to be}} autocorrelated time series {{that may or may not}} be stationary. If left alone, processes will typically not be stable, and hence they will usually not posses a fixed mean, thus exhibiting homogeneous non-stationarity. For monitoring, control, and forecasting purposes of such potentially non-stationary processes it is often important to develop an understanding of the dynamic properties of processes. However, it is sometimes difficult if not impossible to conduct deliberate experiments on full scale industrial plants or business processes to gain the necessary insight of their dynamic properties. Fortunately, intentional or inadvertent process changes that occur in the course of normal operation sometimes offer an opportunity to identify and estimate aspects of the dynamic behavior. ^ To determine if a time series is stationary, the standard exploratory data analytic approach is to check that the sample autocorrelation function (ACF) fades out relatively quickly. An alternative, and at times a sounder approach is to use the variogram – a data exploratory tool widely used in spatial (geo) statistics for the investigation of spatial correlation of data. The first objective of this dissertation is to derive the basic properties of the variogram and to provide the literature on confidence intervals for the variogram. We then show how to use the multivariate Delta method to derive asymptotic confidence intervals for the variogram that are both practical and computationally appealing. ^ The second objective of this dissertation is to review the theory of dynamic process modeling based on time series intervention analysis and to show how this theory can be used for an assessment of the dynamic properties of business and industrial processes. This is accompanied by a detailed example of the study of a large scale ceramic plant that was exposed to an intentional but unplanned structural change (a quasi experiment). ^ The third objective of this dissertation concerns the analysis of multiple interventions. Multiple interventions occur either as a result of multiple changes made to the same process or because of a single change having non-homogeneous effects on time series. For evaluating the effects of undertaken structural changes, it is important to assess and compare the effects, such as gains or losses, of multiple interventions. A statistical hypothesis test for comparing the effects among multiple interventions on process dynamics is developed. Further, we investigate the statistical power of the suggested test and elucidate the results with examples. ...|$|R
