50|$|Historically {{from time}} to time, {{underground}} seams of coal have caught fire, often from careless or unfortunate mining activities. The pocket of ignited coal is fed oxygen by vent paths {{that have not yet}} been discovered. These can smolder for years. Commonly, exhaust vents in populated areas are soon sensed and are sealed while vents in uninhabited areas remain undiscovered. Occasionally, vents are discovered via fumes sensed by passers-by, often in forested areas. Attempts to extinguish those remaining have at times been futile, and several such <b>combustion</b> <b>areas</b> exist today. The existence of an underground combustion site can sometimes be identified in the winter where fallen snow is seen to be melted by the warmth conducted from below. Proposals for harnessing this heat as geothermal energy have not been successful.|$|R
50|$|The stove {{is started}} by burning easily ignited {{material}} such as bundle of coconut leaves, newspaper partially {{embedded in the}} rice husks or other fuels in the combustion chamber area. After the fire is established, the updraft air from the stove designs will quickly sustain and magnify the combustion. The rate of combustion is regulated by removing appropriate amount of ash from under the <b>combustion</b> <b>area</b> with a poker, thus enable more fuel to enter.|$|E

40|$|There are a {{significant}} number of uncontrolled coal mine fires (primarily due to spontaneous combustion of coal), which are currently burning all over the world. These spontaneous combustion sources emit greenhouse gases (GHGs). A critical review reveals that there are no standard measurement methods to estimate GHG emissions from mine fire/spontaneous <b>combustion</b> <b>areas.</b> The objective of this research paper was to estimate GHGs emissions from spontaneous combustion of coals in the Indian context. A sampling chamber (SC) method was successfully used to assess emissions at two locations of the Enna Opencast Project (OCP), Jharia Coalfield (JCF), for 3 months. The study reveals that measured cumulative average emission rate for CO 2 varies from 75. 02 to 286. 03 gs− 1 m− 1 and CH 4 varies from 41. 49 to 40. 34 gs− 1 m− 1 for low- and medium-temperature zones.

Franz's conservative approach came under question from the RLM, but was vindicated when even given the developmental problems that it was to face, the 004 entered production and service well ahead of its more technologically advanced, but slightly lower thrust (7.83 kN/1,760 lbf), the BMW 003.|$|E

50|$|What {{distinguished}} the Clerget {{rotary engine}} from its rivals (Gnome and Le Rhône) {{was that the}} Clerget had normal intake and exhaust valves unlike the Gnome, and the connecting rod arrangement was much simpler than the Le Rhone. A source of failure among the Clerget engines were the special-purpose piston rings, called obturator rings. These were located below the gudgeon or wrist pin, to block heat transfer from the <b>combustion</b> <b>area</b> to {{the lower part of}} the cylinder and overcome their subsequent distortion. These rings were often made from brass and only had a lifespan of a few hours. The Clerget engines were considered reliable but they cost more per unit to produce than their rivals. Unlike other contemporary rotaries in which the ignition system was either switched on or off to provide a rudimentary form of engine speed control, the Clerget featured a throttle.|$|E
5000|$|The {{original}} Atar 101 {{featured a}} seven-stage axial compressor using aluminum alloy blades attached to an aluminum rotor.

One unique feature of the Atar designs was the separate Atar 5000 accessories section, which could be mounted in front of the engine, driven by an extension shaft. The <b>combustion</b> <b>area</b> consisted of twenty steel flame cans arranged in a [...] "canular" [...] layout, exiting into the single-stage turbine. Early models were 2.85 m long, 0.9 m in diameter, and weighed 850 kg, while The C models and on were 3.68 m lone including the long extension, 0.89 m in diameter, and weighed 940 kg.

5000|$|On 30 March 1942, Lockheed {{submitted}} proposals for the Lockheed L-133 and L-1000 to the US Army Air Forces development division at Wright Field. By {{this point the}} original design proved too complex and had evolved into a new design replacing the pistons {{with a set of}} three centrifugal stages, with intercooling between each of the stages. The main combustor was a [...] "canular" [...] type with twelve flame cans in an annular container, feeding their exhaust to a five-stage axial turbine. For additional thrust, fuel could be sprayed between the turbine stages. To fine-tune performance at different altitudes, the compressor and turbine stages were coupled using a variable-speed hydraulic clutch. The design called for a weight of 1,700 lb (775 kg) and a sea level thrust of 5,100 lbf (22700 N). By November 1942 the design had been further refined, with the weight settling at 1,610 lb (735 kg) and the <b>combustion</b> <b>area</b> using chrome-steels.

50|$|The fourth {{category}} of furnace is the high-efficiency, or condensing furnace. High-efficiency furnaces can achieve from 89% to 98% fuel efficiency. This style of furnace includes a sealed <b>combustion</b> <b>area,</b> combustion draft inducer and a secondary heat exchanger. Because the heat exchanger removes {{most of the}} heat from the exhaust gas, it actually condenses water vapor and other chemicals (which form a mild acid) as it operates. The vent pipes are normally installed with PVC pipe versus metal vent pipe to prevent corrosion. The draft inducer allows for the exhaust piping to be routed vertically or horizontally as it exits the structure. The most efficient arrangement for high-efficiency furnaces include PVC piping that brings fresh combustion air from the outside of the home directly to the furnace. Normally the combustion air (fresh air) PVC is routed alongside the exhaust PVC during installation and the pipes exit through a sidewall of the home in the same location. High efficiency furnaces typically deliver a 25% to 35% fuel savings over a 60% AFUE furnace.|$|E
50|$|The {{thrust chamber}} {{injector}} received the propellants {{under pressure from}} the turbopumps, then mixed them in a manner that produced the most efficient combustion. 614 hollow oxidizer posts were machined to form {{an integral part of the}} injector, with fuel nozzles (each swaged to the face of the injector) threaded through and installed over the oxidizer posts in concentric rings. The injector face was porous, being formed from layers of stainless steel wire mesh, and was welded at its periphery to the injector body. The injector received LOX through the dome manifold and injected it through the oxidizer posts into the <b>combustion</b> <b>area</b> of the thrust chamber, while fuel was received from the upper fuel manifold in the thrust chamber and injected through the fuel orifices which were concentric with the oxidizer orifices. The propellants were injected uniformly to ensure satisfactory combustion. The injector and oxidizer dome assembly was located at the top of the thrust chamber. The dome provided a manifold for the distribution of the LOX to the injector and served as a mount for the gimbal bearing and the augmented spark igniter.|$|E
5000|$|Several {{advanced}} retort-house appliances {{were introduced}} for improved efficiency and convenience.

Another class of appliances introduced were apparatuses - and ultimately, machines - for retort loading and unloading. Retorts were generally loaded by using an elongated scoop, into which the coal was loaded - a gang of men would then lift the scoop and ram it into the retort. The coal would then be raked by the men into a layer of even thickness and the retort sealed. Gas production would then ensue - and from 8 - 12 hours later, the retort would be opened, and the coal would be either pulled (in the case of [...] "stop-ended" [...] retorts) or pushed (in the case of [...] "through" [...] retorts) out of the retort. Thus, the retort house had heavy manpower requirements - as many men were often required to bear the coal-containing scoop and load the retort.|$|E

40|$|Nitrogen oxides (NOx) {{is one of}} {{the harmful}} {{emissions}} from power plants. Efforts are made to reduce NOx emissions by researchers and engineers all the times. NO, emissions are from three resources during the combustion: prompt NO, fuel NO and thermal NO. The last one - thermal NO, which is described by `Zeldovich-mechanism', is the main source for NOx emissions. The thermal NO emission mainly results from the high combustion temperature in the combustion process. In order to control the NO formation, the control of peak combustion temperature is the key factor, as well as the oxygen concentration in the <b>combustion</b> <b>areas.</b> Flameless oxidation (FLOX) and continuous staged air combustion (COSTAIR) are two relatively new technologies to control the combustion temperature and the reaction rate and consequently to control the NO, emissions.
