In addition, the 51 crew members had not been paid in five months. The ship was impounded in Newfoundland and in February 2012 was sold to Neptune International Shipping to be broken up.|$|E
25|$|As the <b>charterer</b> was {{responsible}} for paying for the aircraft's entire capacity regardless of whether all seats were filled, {{there was a great}} temptation to let people, who were not eligible to travel under the affinity group rules, take the seats of other, eligible travellers who had cancelled their bookings. As a result, there were numerous occasions on which the airlines got into trouble with the authorities {{on both sides of the}} Atlantic. This made the system increasingly unworkable.|$|E
25|$|The loss of {{the ship}} was subject of a lawsuit filed within weeks of the sinking by {{relatives}} of the crew members seeking 2.5 million dollars in damages under two specific federal acts (the Jones Act, 46 U.S.C. § 688; and the Death on the High Seas Act, 46 U.S.C. § 761), based upon maritime laws regarding the unseaworthiness of a vessel. Marine Sulphur Transport Corporation (the owners of the ship), and Marine Transport Lines, Inc. (demise <b>charterer)</b> petitioned for exoneration {{or at least a}} limitation of liability. The amount of damages sought would grow to $20 million by 1969.|$|E
40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this study was to explore {{shipbroker}} selection criteria of <b>charterers</b> in dry bulk voyage chartering. Other supportive objectives of the study were to understand the role of shipbrokers in dry bulk voyage chartering, expectations and complaints of <b>charterers,</b> reasons behind why <b>charterers</b> work via shipbrokers and to make recommendations to shipbrokers for future. Interviews were done with three shipbrokers from two dry cargo shipbroking companies and two chartering manager, one is from iron and steel while the other is from a coal trading company. Nine criteria were found out that <b>charterers</b> assess when selecting a broker to charter a vessel. “Trustworthiness and reputation” is the most important criterion and if the broker has a bad reputation <b>charterers</b> do not even consider other criteria. It was found out that “ability to find lower freight rates”, “ability to find suitable vessel in due time”, “negotiation skills“ and “service quality during post-fixture” are very important. However, lower freight rates and suitable vessel in due time were prioritized than other two. “Information and advisory services” and “cargo expertise” are regarded important criteria but not as important as preceding criteria. Finally “geographical expertise” of a broker and “communication availability” may be considered as well should previous criteria are satisfied by more than one broker. It was observed that expectation of <b>charterers</b> from brokers and reasons why they work with brokers depend on whether they have a professional chartering department or not. Shipbrokers offer more comprehensive services today with comparison to twenty years ago. It was also figured out that some traders with expert chartering department skip brokers and make direct business with owners. Most common complaints of <b>charterers</b> are deceptive brokers and brokers which do not follow-up the chartering operation and do not pay sufficient attention. Shipbrokers should understand and consider needs, expectation and dissatisfaction of <b>charterers</b> for surviving in the market. They must develop their network for competitive freight rates and focus on advisory services more for investment decision of <b>charterers...</b>|$|R

25|$|In {{the early}} 2000s the {{managing}} director Kyösti Vesterinen and several other high-ranking members of the Finnish Maritime Administration were caught in a bribery scandal when it was found out that DSND Offshore, the <b>charterer</b> of the Finnish multipurpose icebreakers, had offered them several private trips around the world. At {{the same time the}} offshore company, which had failed to make payments for the charters in time, was forgiven 153,000 euros of penalty interests. As a result, Vesterinen and two other officials were found guilty for corruption and as a result lost their positions, were given suspended sentences of four to ten months and had to pay back the unlawfully obtained benefits. The incident ended the co-operation between DSND and the Finnish Maritime Administration and left many people suspicious about the profitability of the multipurpose icebreakers.|$|E
500|$|The act {{of hiring}} a ship to carry cargo is called chartering. [...] Tankers are hired by {{four types of}} charter agreements: the voyage charter, the time charter, the bareboat charter, and {{contract}} of affreightment. In a voyage charter the <b>charterer</b> rents the vessel from the loading port to the discharge port. In a time charter the vessel is hired for a set period of time, to perform voyages as the <b>charterer</b> directs. In a bareboat charter the <b>charterer</b> acts as the ship's operator and manager, taking on responsibilities such as providing the crew and maintaining the vessel. Finally, in a contract of affreightment or COA, the <b>charterer</b> specifies a total volume of cargo to be carried in a specific time period and in specific sizes, for example a COA could be specified as [...] of JP-5 in a year's time in [...] shipments. A completed chartering contract {{is known as a}} charter party.|$|E
500|$|One {{of the key}} {{aspects of}} any charter party is the freight rate, or the price {{specified}} for carriage of cargo. [...] The freight rate of a tanker charter party is specified in one of four ways: by a lump sum rate, by rate per ton, by a time charter equivalent rate, or by Worldscale rate. In a lump sum rate arrangement, a fixed price is negotiated for the delivery of a specified cargo, and the ship's owner/operator is responsible {{to pay for all}} port costs and other voyage expenses. [...] Rate per ton arrangements are used mostly in chemical tanker chartering, and differ from lump sum rates in that port costs and voyage expenses are generally paid by the <b>charterer.</b> Time charter arrangements specify a daily rate, and port costs and voyage expenses are also generally paid by the <b>charterer.</b>|$|E
50|$|The case {{involved}} {{the charter of}} a ship for two years’ consecutive voyages between US and Europe. The ship was to be loaded at a specified rate. The owners were to be paid according {{to the number of}} voyages made during the two-year period. If the time taken for loading and unloading was longer than required, the <b>charterers</b> were to pay $1000 per day by way of demurrage. The <b>charterers</b> were taking many extra days in loading and unloading but were allowed to continue to have the use of the ship {{for the remainder of the}} two years. Eight round trips were made. However, the owners alleged that the <b>charterers</b> delay in loading and unloading had made a further six trips impossible and sued for damages. The owners claimed that they were not bound by that clause because the <b>charterers</b> by their extraordinary delays had committed a fundamental breach of the contract.|$|R
50|$|A time {{charter-party}} is {{a contract}} between the shipowner and <b>charterers,</b> {{by which the}} shipowner agrees to let and the <b>charterers</b> to hire the vessel for a specified term for employment—either generally in any lawful trade or on voyages within certain limits. The time charter-party usually names {{a place where the}} vessel must be re-delivered to the owners {{at the end of the}} term, and the freight is payable until then. The owner almost always pays the wages of the master and crew, and the <b>charterers</b> provide coals and pay port charges. The freight is usually fixed at a certain rate per gross register ton per month, and made payable monthly in advance. Provision is made for suspension of hire in certain cases if the vessel is disabled. The master, though usually employed by the owner, must follow the orders of the <b>charterers</b> concerning use of the vessel. The <b>charterers</b> agree to indemnify the owners from all liability they may be exposed to by the master signing bills of lading or otherwise complying with the charterers' orders. The contract is subject to exceptions similar to those in bills of lading and voyage charter-parties. This is the general outline of the ordinary form of a time charter-party, but forms and clauses can vary considerably.|$|R
40|$|The Commercial Court’s recent {{decision}} in Progress Bulk Carriers Ltd v Tube City IMS LLC (The Cenk Kaptanoglu) {{is an interesting}} example of economic duress founded (in part) on a lawful threat. The claimants in this case were the disponent owners of the vessel Cenk Kaptanoglu. On 2 April 2009, they chartered the vessel to the respondent-charterers for the carriage of shredded scrap but delivered the vessel to a third party shortly thereafter. This constituted a repudiatory breach of the charterparty, which was not accepted by the <b>charterers</b> {{even though there was}} then no realistic chance of the Cenk Kaptanoglu’s fulfilling the charter. Conceding their error, the owners promised to provide an alternative vessel and compensate the <b>charterers</b> for their loss. A substitute vessel (the Agia) was subsequently identified, but by that time it was clear that a delay in shipment could not be avoided. The <b>charterers</b> then sought, unsuccessfully, to negotiate a discount on the freight as a condition for accepting the Agia and the late shipment. On 28 April 2009, the owners made a “take it or leave it” offer, requiring the <b>charterers</b> to accept the Agia at a $ 2 per metric ton discount and waive all claims connected to the owners’ repudiatory breach. The <b>charterers</b> eventually agreed under protest...|$|R

Suddenly Falk takes to going up to their bungalow after dinner, and sitting for hours in the verandah saying nothing. The poor girl couldn't tell for the life of her what to do with such a man, so she would keep on playing the piano and singing to him evening after evening till she was ready to drop. And it wasn't {{as if she had been}} a strong young woman either. She was thirty, and the climate had been playing the deuce with her. Then--don't you know--Fred had to sit up with them for propriety, and during whole weeks on end never got a single chance to get to bed before midnight. That was not pleasant for a tired man--was it? And besides Fred had worries then because his shop didn't pay and he was dropping money fast. He just longed to get away from here and try his luck somewhere else, but for the sake of his sister he hung on and on till he ran himself into debt over his ears--I can tell you. I, myself, could show a handful of his chits for meals and drinks in my drawer. I could never find out tho' where he found all the money at last. Can't be but he must have got something out of that brother of his, a coal merchant in Port Said. Anyhow he paid everybody before he left, but the girl nearly broke her heart. Disappointment, of course, and at her age, don't you know.... Mrs. Schomberg here was very friendly with her, and she could tell you. Awful despair. Fainting fits. It was a scandal. A notorious scandal. To that extent that old Mr. Siegers--not your present <b>charterer,</b> but Mr. Siegers the father, the old gentleman who retired from business on a fortune and got buried at sea going home, he had to interview Falk in his private office. He was a man who could speak like a Dutch Uncle, and, besides, Messrs. Siegers had been helping Falk with a good bit of money from the start. In fact you may say they made him as far as that goes. It so happened that just at the time he turned up here, their firm was chartering a lot of sailing ships every year, and it suited their business that there should be good towing facilities on the river. See?... Well--there's always an ear at the keyhole--isn't there? In fact," [...] he lowered his tone confidentially, [...] "in this case a good friend of mine; a man you can see here any evening; only they conversed rather low. Anyhow my friend's certain that Falk was trying to make all sorts of excuses, and old Mr. Siegers was coughing a lot. And yet Falk wanted all the time to be married too. Why! It's notorious the man has been longing for years to make a home for himself. Only he can't face the expense. When it comes to putting his hand in his pocket--it chokes him off. That's the truth and no other. I've always said so, and everybody agrees with me by this time. What do you think of that--eh?" ...|$|E

50|$|A {{contract}} of affreightment is a contract between a ship-owner and another person (called the <b>charterer),</b> in which the ship-owner agrees to carry goods for the <b>charterer</b> in the ship, or to give the <b>charterer</b> {{the use of the}} whole or part of the ship's cargo-carrying space for the carriage of goods on a specified voyage or voyages or for a specified time.

5000|$|There {{are legal}} {{differences}} between a bareboat charter {{and other types}} of charter arrangements, commonly called time or voyage charters. In a voyage or time charter, the <b>charterer</b> charters the ship (or part of it) for a particular voyage or for a set period of time. In these charters the <b>charterer</b> can direct where the ship will go but the owner of the ship retains possession of the ship through its employment of the master and crew. In a bare-boat or demise charter, on the other hand, the owner gives possession of the ship to the <b>charterer</b> and the <b>charterer</b> hires its own master and crew. The bare-boat <b>charterer</b> is sometimes called a [...] "disponent owner". The giving up of possession of the ship by the owner is the defining characteristic of a bareboat or demise charter.|$|E
50|$|Time charter: In a {{time charter}} the owner {{provides}} a vessel that is fully manned and equipped. The owner provides the crew, but the crew takes {{orders from the}} <b>charterer.</b> The owner is also responsible for insuring the vessel, repairs the vessel may need, engine parts and food for the ship's personnel. The <b>charterer</b> is responsible for everything else. The main advantage of the time charter is that it diverts the costs of running a ship to the <b>charterer.</b>|$|E
50|$|In a {{bareboat charter}} no {{administration}} or technical maintenance is included {{as part of}} the agreement.

40|$|The {{right of}} owners to claim damages {{in the event}} of <b>charterers</b> failing to pay hire and the vessel being {{withdrawn}} is complicated. The complication has been reflected in the commentary in Time Charters and is generated from conflicting authorities as to whether the contractual obligation of <b>charterers</b> to pay hire punctually and regularly is a condition or an innominate term.

50|$|The {{cesser clause}} {{has come into}} common use because, frequently, the <b>charterers</b> are not {{personally}} interested in the cargo.

The effect of the clause is that by the <b>charterers</b> shipping a full cargo, they fulfill all their obligations. The shipowner discharges them from further liability and takes instead a lien on the cargo for payment of all freight, demurrage, or dead freight that is payable. It has become established {{in the construction of the}} cesser clause that, if the language permits it, the cesser of liability is assumed co-extensive only with the lien given to the shipowner.
