However, this study finds that the residuals from regressions of both real estate series on financial asset returns are significantly correlated. This supports the notion that there is a common factor (or factors) associated with real estate that affects both sets of returns. In addition, lagged values of the EREIT residuals help explain variations in the <b>conventional</b> unsecuritized real <b>estate</b> return residuals. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the appraisal}} of a specialized form {{of real estate}} - data centres - that has a unique blend of locational, physical and technological characteristics that differentiate it from <b>conventional</b> real <b>estate</b> assets. Market immaturity, limited trading {{and a lack of}} pricing signals enhance levels of appraisal uncertainty and disagreement relative to <b>conventional</b> real <b>estate</b> assets. Given the problems of applying standard discounted cash flow, an approach to appraisal is proposed that uses pricing signals from traded cash flows that are similar to the cash flows generated from data centres. Based upon ‘the law of one price’, it is assumed that two assets that are expected to generate identical cash flows in the future must have the same value now. It is suggested that the expected cash flow of assets should be analysed over the life cycle of the building. Corporate bond yields are used to provide a proxy for the appropriate discount rates for lease income. Since liabilities are quite diverse, a number of proxies are suggested as discount and capitalisation rates including indexed-linked, fixed interest and zero-coupon bonds. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{volume of}} {{research}} specifically directed at lodging {{real estate investment}} trusts (REITs) is slender, although numerous studies have been conducted on REITs generally. Studies of REITs generally have found that regulatory requirements disperse ownership and focus management’s attention on its position as the shareholders’ agents. While REITs have carried more uncertainty of results than <b>conventional</b> real <b>estate</b> investments, they remain a vehicle for relatively small investors to participate in large real estate holdings. Despite the presence and apparent success of lodging REITs, no study has specifically addressed which ownership format is most suited to the hotel industry...|$|R

The integrative negotiation approach emphasises mutual gains. The approach has been applied in land use planning and environmental management, but has not {{been used as a}} coordinated approach to real estate development, city design, and urban planning.

This research aims to explore and then summarize the present sustainable CREM practices and components relating to sustainable performance measurement integrating a sustainable theory that balances environmental, economic and social impacts. These act as indicators to measure the outcomes of the practice in the form of a generic model on sustainability preliminary framework for CRESM. The objectives of this research include identifying corporate real estate sustainable management (CRESM) practice and components of sustainable performance measurement.

S., Urban Land Development) [...] California State University, Sacramento, 2010. <b>Conventional</b> real <b>estate</b> {{development}} {{practices and}} {{the operation of}} existing buildings create significant negative externalities. New practices collectively known as ???green building??? or ???sustainable development??? offer mitigation for these externalities. However, the proliferation of green buildings has been hindered by, among other things, {{a lack of understanding}} of how property-level sustainability affects building valuation and investment and analysis. Sources of Data???I used the LEED New Construction rating system as framework for evaluating property-level sustainability???s interaction with building value. Various studies and market data provided the basis for assumptions about the value of various sustainable attributes. Personal communications with investment analysts provided insight into the trends, attitudes, and analytical framework employed by large investment funds with respect to sustainable properties. Conclusions Reached???Conventional financial analysis techniques such as discounted cash flow analysis can be modified to account for sustainable building features. Each property is unique and has a unique interaction between sustainability and value. Using the exercises presented in this thesis can help guide the process of underwriting sustainable property investment. Investment funds can encourage sustainable development by prioritizing funding for sustainable projects, but will should develop an institutional understanding of how to analyze sustainable property investment in order to avoid tradeoffs between sustainability and profitability.

40|$|The rapid {{expansion}} of the TMT sector in the late 1990 s and more recent growing regulatory and corporate focus on business continuity and security have raised the profile of data centres. Data centres offer a unique blend of occupational, physical and technological characteristics compared to <b>conventional</b> real <b>estate</b> assets. Limited trading and heterogeneity of data centres also causes higher levels of appraisal uncertainty. In practice, the application of conventional discounted cash flow approaches requires information about {{a wide range of}} inputs that is difficult to derive from limited market signals or estimate analytically. This paper outlines an approach that uses pricing signals from similar traded cash flows is proposed. Based upon ‘the law of one price’, the method draws upon the premise that two identical future cash flows must have the same value now. Given the difficulties of estimating exit values, an alternative is that the expected cash flows of data centre are analysed over the life cycle of the building, with corporate bond yields used to provide a proxy for the appropriate discount rates for lease income. Since liabilities are quite diverse, a number of proxies are suggested as discount and capitalisation rates including indexed-linked, fixed interest and zero-coupon bonds. Although there are rarely assets that have identical cash flows and some approximation is necessary, the level of appraiser subjectivity is dramatically reduced. ...|$|R

We provide insight about many of the <b>conventional</b> approaches to <b>estate</b> planning and suggest how these strategies can be enhanced. For example, we show that {{the advantage of the}} reset provision by which the investor’s capital gains tax bases are adjusted to the market value at the time of death is greater in the presence of individual rather than joint ownership of assets, provided that at the first death of one of the joint owners the basis is reset to an average of the date of death value and the survivor’s original cost. We analyze asset location and distribution policies in the context of trusts that are outside of the taxable estate of its principal beneficiary as well as direct funds owned by the beneficiary, highlighting the interaction between estate taxation and the reset of the capital gains tax basis at death. We compare the optimal decisions for traditional tax-deferred accounts and after-tax (“Roth”) IRAs. Finally, we also examine the value and importance of borrowing in various contexts in estate planning. ...|$|R

40|$|In {{contrast}} to the <b>conventional</b> wisdom, real <b>estate</b> activity in the aggregate is not disfavored by the 1986 Tax Act. Within the broad aggregate, however, widely different impacts are to be expected. Regular rental and commercial activity will be slightly disfavored, while historic and old rehabilitation activity will be greatly disfavored. In contrast, owner- occupied housing, {{far and away the}} largest component of real estate, is favored, both directly by an interest rate decline and indirectly owing to the increase in rents. Low-income rental housing may be the most favored of all real estate activities. The rent increase for residential properties will be 10 to 15 percent with our assumption of a percentage point decline in interest rates. For commercial properties, the expected rent increase is 5 to 10 percent. The market value decline, which will be greater the longer and further investors think rents will be below the new equilibrium, is unlikely to exceed 4 percent in fast growth markets, even if substantial excess capacity currently exists. In no-growth markets with substantial excess capacity, market values could decline by as much as 8 percent from already depressed levels. Average housing costs will decrease slightly for households with incomes below about $ 60, 000, but increase by 5 percent for those with incomes above twice this level. With the projected increase in rents, homeownership should rise for all income classes, but especially for those with income under $ 60, 000. The aggregate home ownership rate is projected to increase by three percentage points in the long run in response to the Tax Act. The new passive loss limitations are likely to lower significantly the values of recent loss-motivated partnership deals and of properties in areas where the economics have turned sour (vacancy rates have risen sharply). The limitations should have little impact on new construction and market rents, however. Reduced depreciation write-offs, lower interest rates, and higher rents all act to lower expected passive losses. Moreover, financing can be restructured to include equity-kickers or less debt generally at little loss of value. ...|$|R
40|$|Many Australians {{today are}} image consumers. We fail to {{question}} the importance of lifestyle imagery created and promoted by Real Estate Agencies whom have no actual part in the physical creation of house, or indeed the intimate making of "home" through our experiences of place. Real Estate Markets dictate how, where, when and what we buy. Re-sale values, profit-making, and value-adding interfere with the crafting of a home over time as a tangible, individual, collaborative, and rich lived experience of dwelling. The "NOT FOR SALE" project is a response and critique of the dominance of real estate forces in West End within the context and unshakable presence of a booming inner-city property market. This proposal originated from an experimental dwelling in Avebury St., West End. This project has been fashioned {{over a period of}} several years primarily from recycled local materials, interconnected with the changing needs and spatial requirements of the occupants and project participants. The influence of property markets is of little concern in this home "making". The "NOT FOR SALE" project attempts to question and critique the purely financial value that we as a society place upon our homes. By appropriating and re-coding the Real Estate Signage typologies, we aim to provoke social commentary on the dominance of real estate forces in the West End suburb. There is a strong and rich tradition of anti-consumerist activist graffiti in West End. Activists re-code signs and property with political commentary and critique. The "NOT FOR SALE" project draws upon this tradition through our RRESign (Recodified Real Estate Signs) : we aim to redress the dominant commercial forces associated with the single house/property. Collectively, at the scale of the street, these RRESigns will reflect a critique of street scale, amenity, and character. Finally, at the scale of the suburb, the network of RRESigns will reflect a critique of the idea of place making. Collectively, the aim of the "NOT FOR SALE" RRESign interventions is to highlight the idea of making and the material characteristics of dwelling that challenges the cultural value of commodified property, re-defining and prioritising the idea of "home". <b>Conventional</b> Real <b>Estate</b> signs use images and text to sell an idea of home: our proposed interventions sell nothing, and are rather celebrations of the joy of making tactile, handcrafted objects, and by extension, the making and crafting of home. The intimate and experiential understanding of home will be harnessed through the engagement of local residents. Community groups within West End such as Local Push can further disseminate the RRESign interventions. The signs will be constructed West End-specific materials (old signs purchased from inexpensive second-hand material merchant Reverse Garbage in Montague Rd.) : turning post-consumer waste into objects of material beauty and social critique. Residents and community groups will be encouraged to place their RRESigns outside their properties and adjacent real estate signs, frustrating and recoding the existing For-Sale signs that currently dominate the West End street scape. The project is dependent on the support of the local residents, extending from a few signs in Avebury St. to a network of RRESigns throughout West End.
