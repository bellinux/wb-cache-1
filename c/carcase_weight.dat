50|$|Ireland {{has a low}} {{density of}} pig {{production}} {{when compared to the}} larger pig producing regions across Europe.Irish pig producers finish their pigs at lower <b>carcase</b> <b>weights</b> compared to most countries across Europe. As a result, Irish producers do not castrate their male pigs. Castration is carried out across most of Europe as male pigs are generally brought to heavier <b>carcase</b> <b>weights</b> and, without castration, 'boar taint' may become an issue. Boar taint refers to the unpleasant odour and flavour characteristics noted in pork derived from males boars as they reach sexual maturity. Taint is only found in a small minority of boars and can be found in sows as it is actually caused by two different chemicals, one produced in the male testes and the other produced in the intestines. As the castration of pigs has also become an animal welfare issue across Europe, non-castration is considered a double advantage, as it benefits the welfare of the animal and entire boars produce leaner and better quality meat. Taint can be controlled through breeding away from the few lines that have it (genetics), feed management (higher fibre) and housing management (out on pasture instead of confinement).|$|R

40|$|This paper {{summarise}} six studies {{undertaken by}} the Sheep CRC to elucidate certain aspects of confinement feeding of sheep. A review of confinement feeding highlighted the variability of growth rate and feed conversion of sheep and revealed that {{little is known about}} the use of sorghum for feeding sheep. The review indicated that the main factors responsible for variation of growth rate and feed conversion were adaptation to grain and feeding system, including the preparation and presentation of feed. The importance of social and physiological adaptation to grain feeding was confirmed. Factors identified as responsible for safe induction and uniform growth rates included prior exposure to grain as lambs, gradual introduction of grain and, when concentrate was provided ad libitum from the first day, the use of either virginiamycin, a pelleted feed, a total mixed ration or a step-wise increase of high-starch grain components. Separate feeding of hay and grain resulted in performance comparable with that of a pelleted diet and that of a total mixed ration. Sorghum-based concentrate diets resulted in growth rates and <b>carcase</b> <b>weights</b> similar to that for winter cereal grains or pellets. Steam flaking or expanding of sorghum had no significant effect on growth rates or <b>carcase</b> <b>weights.</b> These results can be used to determine the profitability of various feedlotting options...|$|R

40|$|The {{commercial}} {{harvest of}} kangaroos in Australia is regulated by various state government agencies. They control {{the number of}} kangaroos that can be harvested annually with the view to ensuring that the harvest remains ecologically and economically sustainable. In addition to controlling the harvest quotas, some agencies impose minimum weight restrictions on harvested animals, which may assist with maintaining viable breeding populations. However, harvesting usually occurs in remote regions and carcases may be stored refrigerated for up to 10 - 14 d before being inspected for compliance with minimum weight restrictions. Consequently, there is concern that weight loss during cold storage, particularly in small carcases close to the minimum limit, could lead to harvesters being wrongly prosecuted or fined for breaching the minimum <b>carcase</b> <b>weight</b> licence condition. We found that for two species of kangaroo, the large eastern grey kangaroo (Macropus giganteus; liveweight 30 - 70 kg) and the smaller red-necked wallaby (M. rufogriseus; liveweight 10 - 24 kg), <b>carcase</b> <b>weight</b> loss after 10 days cold storage was negligible.

As the four economic drivers of beef production in northern Australia are: survival, reproduction, weight gain, and carcass and meat quality, this trial was a quantitative test of three aspects of the suitability of Brahman type cattle for the north Australian cattle industry. The final weighing of the steers in the 2½ year-long weight trial took place during the first field day for north Queensland cattlemen, organised by the Mount Garnet branch of the Graziers' Association in co-operation with the Dept A, and held at Wairuna Homestead, in 1955.

These lambs were the progeny of 363 Terminal, Maternal, and Merino sires divergent for post-weaning eye muscle depth breeding values (PEMD). Dressing percentage was calculated by dividing hot standard <b>carcase</b> <b>weight</b> by pre-slaughter weight expressed as a percentage, and all three of these terms were analysed using a linear mixed effects models. The base model included fixed effects for site, year of birth, kill group, sex, birth-rear type, sire type and dam breed, with sire and darn identification included as random terms. Sire post-weaning fat depth, weight, and PEMD breeding values were included as covariates. The PEMD breeding value was found to have no effect on pre-slaughter weight, however it did increase (P< 0. 01) hot standard <b>carcase</b> <b>weight</b> by 1 kg across the 7 unit PEMD range. This increase was attributable to the impact of sire PEMD on dressing percentage which increased (P< 0. 01) by 1. 7 dressing percentage units across the PEMD range. This represents a clear production advantage for producers using high PEMD sires, the progeny of which will have a similar live weight to low PEMD sires, but will deliver heavier carcase weights {{on the basis of their}} improved dressing percentage.

40|$|In vivo {{measures}} of carcase quality can aid selection. Muscle density, (measured by computer tomography) has strong negative genetic and phenotypic correlations with intramuscular fat. The {{aim of this}} study was to evaluate growth and carcase parameters of lambs, sired by five high and low muscle density Terminal sire rams, using three different covariates. Progeny (n= 394) were recorded for live weight at: birth; 8 weeks, 16 weeks and immediately pre-slaughter. Ultrasonic measurements were made at the third lumbar vertebrae, pre-slaughter. Carcase records include carcase weights, EUROP classification scores for fatness and conformation. Data were analysed using GENSTAT 15, using a sire nested within muscle density ANOVA design model, fitting sex; dam age (slaughter batch for carcase traits); birth/rear type and MyoMaxTM carrier status. The model was adjusted for the covariates, age at measurement (age) : live weight at slaughter (Slwt); or slaughter fat grade (fat). Low muscle density sired lambs were heavier at 8 weeks (age P= 0. 022; Slwt P= 0. 043 : fat P= 0. 04) and 16 weeks (age 0. 014; Slwt P= 0. 05; fat P= 0. 036). However high muscle density sired lambs had increased ultrasonic muscle depth (age 0. 0 19 : Slwt P= 0. 017; and fat P= 0. 017), heavier hot <b>carcase</b> <b>weight</b> (age P= 0. 004; Slwt P< 0. 001; fat P= 0. 004), 48 h cold <b>carcase</b> <b>weight</b> (age P= 0. 027; Slwt P< 0. 001 : fat P= 0. 013), higher killing out percentages (age, Slwt and fat P< 0. 001), and improved carcase conformation (age, Slwt and fat P< 0. 001).

The different sources providing such data report very different figures and trends over time, but {{they all seem to}} indicate an overall trend of decrease in total farm numbers over the last decades, which appears to be due mainly to a decrease in the numbers of grazing and fattening farms and in the number of arable farms.

However, different trends can be observed depending on the farm type. The report then explores the change in livestock numbers over time. Thus, during the last 20 years, the main trends consist in an overall decrease in sheep and beef numbers, while dairy and deer numbers increased. To conclude, the report deals with the question of intensification in New Zealand farming systems. It underlines the increase in numbers of cows per hectare and production per cow in the dairy sector, and the increase in lambing rates and <b>carcase</b> <b>weights</b> in the sheep and beef sector.

40|$|Associations between {{intensity}} {{and frequency of}} Cryptosporidium and Giardia shedding with growth, <b>carcase</b> <b>weight</b> and dressing% were investigated using a longitudinal study of 1182 lambs on eight Australian farms. Live weight was recorded and faecal samples were collected on three sampling occasions; weaning (approximately 12 weeks of age), post-weaning (approximately 19 weeks) and pre-slaughter (approximately 29 weeks). Hot standard <b>carcase</b> <b>weight</b> (HSCW) and dressing% were measured at slaughter. Faecal samples were screened for presence and concentration of Cryptosporidium, Giardia and Haemonchus oocysts using a quantitative PCR. Trichostrongylid eggs were quantified with modified McMaster faecal worm egg count (WEC). Protozoan shedding intensity was categorised as high (above median oocyst concentration in positive sheep), low (below median oocyst concentration in positive sheep) or not detected. Shedding was also categorised for shedding type (no shedding, single Giardia infection, single Cryptosporidium infection, concurrent Giardia and Cryptosporidium infection) and lambs were categorised for frequency of shedding (shedding identified on 0, 1, 2 or 3 occasions). Associations of parasite shedding intensity category, shedding type, shedding frequency, WEC and Haemonchus status (positive or negative) with lamb production were assessed using general linear models (HSCW and dressing%) and linear mixed effects models (live weight). High Cryptosporidium parvum shedding was associated with lower live weight, ranging 2. 31 – 4. 52 kg over the 3 sampling occasions. Cryptosporidium parvum shedding was associated with less HSCW in high (3. 22 kg less) and low (3. 22 kg less) shedding lambs post-weaning, and high (2. 21 kg less) and low (2. 60 kg less) shedding lambs pre-slaughter as well as lower dressing% (2. 7 % lower in high shedding lambs post-weaning). Cryptosporidium (all species) shedding pre-slaughter was associated with reduced dressing% in both high (1. 25 % lower) and low (1. 21 % lower) shedding lambs. Giardia shedding pre-slaughter was associated with 0. 59 kg less HSCW in high shedding lambs. Increased frequency of C. parvum and Giardia shedding in a specific animal (repeated detection) were associated with reduced HSCW and dressing%. Concurrent Giardia and Cryptosporidium shedding pre-slaughter was associated with reduced dressing%. No statistically {{significant main effects for}} either WEC (P > 0. 05) or Haemonchus status (P > 0. 05) were identified for any of the sheep meat productivity measures (live weight, HSCW and dressing%).

A major multi-breed study reported that Limousins converted feed into saleable meat more efficiently and significantly faster than popular British breeds, and marginally faster than other popular continental European cattle breeds. Conversely, the other cattle breeds produced proportionally more low-cost by-product and waste, which resulted in their live weight growth being faster than Limousins. Limousins are especially favoured for crossbreeding with cattle such as Angus, Hereford and Shorthorn because of their ability to contribute hybrid vigour, and improve the yield and feed conversion efficiency of these British breeds, which produce higher levels of fat and marbled meat.|$|R

Half carcases were dissected into fat, muscle, bone and connective tissue. Repeatability of photograph interpretation was {{of the order of}} 0. 75 for fat depth at the 12 th rib and tuber coxae sites and M. longissirnus area, but low for shoulder fat depth.

40|$|Increased {{growth rate}} and carcass lean meat yield % are key profit drivers for the lamb industry, however redistributing lean tissue to more highly priced {{parts of the}} carcase will also {{increase}} its value. Faster growing lambs {{are known to be}} leaner and less mature at slaughter. Therefore we hypothesised that selection for growth using the Australian Sheep Breeding Value (ASBV) for greater post weaning weight (PWWT) would increase whole carcase lean weight, when animals are compared at the same <b>carcase</b> <b>weight.</b> Lamb carcases (n= 1, 218) from the Sheep CRC Information Nucleus were scanned in sections (fore, saddle, and hind) using Computed Tomography (CT) to determine fat lean and bone weights. Data was analysed using the log-linearised allometric equation logy = log a + b. logx. Fixed effects were site-year, sex sire type, birth-type rear-type and kill group within site-year, with random terms sire and dam by year. For the same carcass weight PWWT caused no composition differences, except in female lambs which had 3. 3 % more carcase lean (P< 0. 01) across the 25 unis PWWT range. Alternatively for the same fat, lean or bone weight these tissues were all proportionately heavier in the saddle region of the high PWWT lambs by 3 %, 7 %, and 16 % across the PWWT range. Aligning with our hypothesis, PWWT was associated with increased total carcase lean, although only in females. Unexpectedly, PWWT caused a redistribution of carcass tissues to the saddle region, particularly for bone and lean, implying an altered conformation in these high growth lambs. Conflicting with the premise of our hypothesis, these effects appear to be independent of maturity as there was no whole body increase in bone weight. Furthermore loin muscle myoglobin concentration in the high PWWT lambs was increased (by 0. 03 ± 0. 018 mg/g tissue) rather than decreased as would be expected in a less mature animal, In conclusion, PWWT redistributes <b>carcase</b> <b>weight</b> to the saddle region of lambs...|$|E

There were marked differences between sire types and dam breeds, with pure-bred Merinos having lower pre-slaughter weight, reduced dressing percentage, and lower HCWT than progeny from Terminal and Maternal sired lambs or progeny from Maternal (1 st cross) dams...|$|E
40|$|An {{experiment}} with grazing weaner cattle {{was conducted in}} which supplements of molasses, phosphoric acid and urea were compared with no supplement during wet and dry seasons. No responses to urea supplementation occurred until faecal protein levels fell below 8. 0 per cent, when liveweight responses to a molasses-urea supplement occurred, initially with increased rate of gain then reduced ‘rate of loss. A molasses supplement increased wet season gains, and a phosphoric acid supplement fed with either molasses or molasses-urea significantly increased dry season weight loss. No significant differences in post-supplementation growth rate were observed between treatment groups, and, at the final weighing, urea-supple-mented groups were significantly heavier than those which received no urea. Final <b>carcase</b> <b>weight</b> and dressing percentage were significantly higher following urea supplementation. Measurements of faecal output indicated that urea groups consumed more dry matter than non-urea groups, from late autumn onwards. I...|$|E
40|$|The {{aim of this}} master {{thesis on}} the topic of: Evaluation {{of the effects of}} {{breeding}} and species belonging to livestock on the strength of the muscle fibers was to establish the influence of factors (breeding and species affiliation, sex, age at the time of slaughter, carcass weight, net gain, etc.) on the strength of the muscle fibres in these species of animals: cattle, pigs, rams, poultry, pheasants. The thinnest muscle fibers are measured by rams. Significantly (p < 0. 01) higher value diameter of muscle fibers should slaughter roosters, followed by pheasants and cattle. The strongest fiber (p < 0. 01) had slaughter pigs. The results show that pork is the observed species grossest muscle structure, while the finest muscle structure and thus have the finest meat rams. Significant influence on the strength of muscle fibers in most studied species of livestock should <b>carcase</b> <b>weight</b> and age at the time of slaughter. The strength fibers with age and carcass weight increased significantly...|$|E
40|$|The aim of diploma thesis was {{to analyze}} an {{ecological}} farm in South Bohemia region {{with the system}} of beef farming with the exclusion of market milk production, and evaluation of selected reproductive and meat production parameters. Meat hybrids of aberdeen angus, galloway, charolais and hereford breed were kept on this farm. Years from 2010 to 2015 were analyzed and then following parameters were evaluated: number of births during the year and in individual months, length of gestation and calving interval, service period, insemination index and calf losses. Meat production indicators were evaluated including the resulting class of carcase classification in SEUOP system, <b>carcase</b> <b>weight</b> {{and the age of}} animals at the time of slaughtering. Subsequently, comparison with neighboring organic farm and conventional farms were made. Although it is a small farm the results of the analysis shows that the reproductive parameters are above the average compared to the conventional aberdeen angus farms. Comparing conventional farms meat production results are relatively the same...|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} {{explored}} whether {{the use of}} group medication with antibiotics in a Danish pig herd was reduced after vaccination of the pigs against proliferative enteropathy (PE) caused by Lawsonia intracellularis. 7900 pigs originating from a single commercial sow herd were vaccinated against L. intracellularis, whereas 7756 pigs were kept as non-vaccinated controls. The pigs were included batch-wise in the study with every second batch being vaccinated. In the vaccinated batches, the consumption of oxytetracykline to treat PE was reduced by 79 %, with a significantly lower number of pigs being treated (P < 0. 0001). Vaccination also resulted in a highly significant improvement of average daily weight gain (+ 46 g/day; P = 9. 55 × 10 - 31) and <b>carcase</b> <b>weight</b> (+ 1. 25 kg; P = 4. 54 × 10 - 05) {{as well as a}} shortened fattening period (- 8 days; P = 2. 01 × 10 - 45) ...|$|E
40|$|The {{current study}} {{examined}} the effect of supplementing lambs with algae. Forty, three month old lambs were allocated to receive a control ration based on oats and lupins (n= 20) or the control ration with DHA-Gold™ algae (~ 2 % of the ration, n= 20). These lambs came from dams previously fed a ration based on either silage (high in omega- 3) or oats and cottonseed meal (OCSM: high in omega- 6) at joining (dam nutrition, DN). Lamb performance, <b>carcase</b> <b>weight</b> and GR fat content were not affected by treatment diet (control vs algae) or DN (silage vs OSCM). Health claimable omega- 3 fatty acids (EPA+DHA) were significantly greater in the LL of lambs fed algae (125 ± 6 mg/ 100 g meat) compared to those not fed algae (43 ± 6 mg/ 100 g meat) and this effect was mediated by DN. Supplementing with algae high in DHA provides a means of improving {{an aspect of the}} health status of lamb meat...|$|E
40|$|The {{growth and}} carcase {{characteristics}} of South Suffolk x Merino ewe lambs, grazed on mature crops of either faba beans, field peas, or lupins were evaluated. Lambs grazing faba beans grew significantly (P< 0. 05) faster (220 g/head/day) than lambs grazing field peas (186 g/day), {{which in turn}} grew faster than lambs grazing lupins (166 g/day). These differences in growth rate {{were also reflected in}} significant (P< 0. 05) differences in <b>carcase</b> <b>weight.</b> Carcases from lambs grazing lupins had whiter fat than those from lambs grazing faba beans or field peas (P< 0. 05) but there were no differences in either meat colour or GR tissue depth. The gross margin from grazing lambs on lupins was greater than grazing lambs on either field peas or faba beans. Grazing mature crops of lupins and field peas to produce prime lambs out of season generated greater gross margins per hectare than would have been achieved had these crops been harvested for sale of grain...|$|E
