40|$|In the {{preceding}} chapters it is {{demonstrated that the}} Norwegian-Icelandic herring tagging experiments have met with success. When properly handled the herring is capable of withstanding the shock of tagging, and this first successfully executed herring tagging experiment in European waters is certainly encouraging. Herring tagging is now being done in several European contries, {{with the use of}} different kinds of external tags and it is demonstrated that the herring also can stand up to this treatment. It is further shown that a herring shoal must be regarded as a temporary phenomenon, for the shoals evidently disperse after a time, the fish later reforming themselves into new ones. Another important result of the taggings is that <b>tagged</b> <b>spring</b> herrings appear in the catches in the large-herring district, and an intermixture between large and spring herring definitely takes place. If this feature continues to manifest itself, the morphological differences observed (Rasnmussen 1940) (Rundstrøm 1941) need further explanation. An outstanding feature which may be stressed as being of particular importance is that transoceanic migrations also take place to a considerable extent, this being in direct support of Fridriksson's theory, (Fridriksson 1944). From the results already obtained through this tagging experiment it is strongly recommended that this work be continued and, if possible, extended. As the herrings in the northern waters are only caught commercially during limited fishing seasons, difficulties are encountered in the very interesting problem of fixing the routes of the migrations, but attempts will be made to find and mark herrings in the open sea in the close seasons in an attempt to clear up this special point...|$|R

Figure 1 : Numbers of tagged cod recaptured by ICES rectangle. Of the 18 recaptures reported, 12 were made between January and March 2007, and the remaining six between April and December 2007. During the spawning period (January – March), three tagged fish were recaptured in ICES rectangles adjacent to that {{in which they were}} released (30 F 0), one of which was recaught in ICES area IVc (Figure 1).

40|$|Like large {{hydropower}} {{counterparts in}} the Columbia River, low-elevation dams and irrigation diversions may impede adult salmonid migrations as fish approach spawning areas in smaller tributaries. The Umatilla River has seven low elevation dams that may obstruct Chinook salmon and steelhead access to historic spawning areas. We used radio telemetry to examine fallback rates, passage routes, rates, and delays, holding and spawning locations, and maximum upstream distribution of Chinook salmon and steelhead in the Umatilla River basin (Oregon). Analyses focused {{on the effects of}} project modifications on salmonid passage and overall system use by fish. Detections at fixed receivers and mobile tracking of 476 <b>tagged</b> steelhead, 130 <b>spring</b> Chinook salmon, and 206 fall Chinook salmon from 2009 - 2012 provided data for these analyses. Recent project modifications at individual diversion structures have resulted in marked improvements in fish passages times. Species show preference for different aspects of the modifications; for example, jump pools are used by spring Chinook more than steelhead. System passage times have also been markedly reduced.

Fifty-four adult saugers were captured during fall 2004, surgically implanted with radio transmitters, and tracked through mid-July 2005. Tagged saugers selected large and deep pools. Such pools were abundant throughout the Little Wind River system and led to saugers being widely dispersed from fall to early spring. During fall, winter, and early <b>spring,</b> <b>tagged</b> saugers remained sedentary and moved short distances among pools in close proximity to each other. Longer movements by tagged saugers occurred from mid-spring to early summer, and were associated with both upstream and downstream movements to and from two river segments believed to be used for spawning. During early summer, most saugers returned to locations where they had been tagged the previous fall and had spent the winter. Our results provide evidence that preservation of the sauger fishery in the Wind River system will depend on maintaining fish passage throughout the portion of the watershed inhabited by saugers and preserving natural fluvial processes that maintain large and deep pools...|$|R
40|$|This report {{details the}} smolt {{performance}} {{of natural and}} hatchery chinook salmon and steelhead from the Imnaha River to the Snake River and Columbia River dams during migration year 2000. Flow conditions in the Imnaha River and Snake River were appreciably lower during May and June in 2000, compared to historic levels at gauging stations, but flow conditions in the Imnaha and Snake River were above average during April. Overall, water conditions for the entire Columbia River were characterized by the Fish Passage Center as below normal levels. Spill occurred continuously at Lower Granite Dam (LGR), Little Goose Dam (LGO), and Lower Monumental Dam (LMO) from April 5, April 10, and April 4, respectively, to June 20, and encompassed the periods of migration of Imnaha River juvenile chinook salmon and steelhead, with a few exceptions. Outflow in the tailraces of LGR, LGO, and LMO decreased in May and June while temperatures increased. Chinook salmon and steelhead were captured using rotary screw traps at river kilometer (rkm) 74 and 7 during the fall from October 20 to November 24, 1999, and during the spring period from February 26 to June 15, 2000, at rkm 7. Spring trapping information was reported weekly to the Fish Passage Center's Smolt Monitoring Program. A portion of these fish were tagged weekly with passive integrated transponder (PIT) tags and were detected migrating past interrogation sites at Snake River and Columbia River dams. Survival of PIT tagged fish was estimated with the Survival Using Proportional Hazards model (SURPH model). Estimated survival of fall tagged natural chinook (with {+-} 95 % confidence intervals in parenthesis) from the upper Imnaha (rkm 74) to LGR was 29. 6 % ({+-} 2. 8). Natural chinook salmon tagged in the fall in the lower Imnaha River at rkm 7, which over wintered in the Snake River, had an estimated survival of 36. 8 % ({+-} 2. 9 %) to LGR. <b>Spring</b> <b>tagged</b> natural chinook salmon from the lower site had an estimated survival of 84. 8 % ({+-} 2. 6 %) to LGR. The season wide survival of <b>spring</b> <b>tagged</b> natural chinook salmon smolts from release in the Imnaha River to McNary Dam (MCN) was 67. 9 % ({+-} 6. 3 %). Post release survival of hatchery chinook salmon smolts, from release at the Imnaha River acclimation facility to the lower Imnaha River trap, was estimated at 94. 7 % ({+-} 4. 7 %).

40|$|Graduation date: 2014 The typical {{coho salmon}} life {{history has been}} {{characterized}} by juvenile fish that spend their entire first year in freshwater habitats before migrating into estuaries as smolts. However, reports of early migrating coho fry (age 0), including migration downstream to estuarine habitats, {{date back to the}} 1960 s. Until a few years ago, these individuals were considered to be displaced surplus fish with low chances of survival. Recent studies have suggested that subyearling estuarine migrating coho salmon could be an alternative life history in coastal populations, but their return as jacks or mature adults needed to be documented for this life history to be considered a viable strategy. The goal of our study was to track the return of spawning coho salmon that had been individually tagged in either estuarine or riverine nursery habitats, and determine return percentages for each life history strategy as well as independently verify the presence of subyearling estuarine migrating coho salmon through otolith analysis on spawning populations. We used Passive Integrated Transponder (PIT) tags to identify individual fish as they passed through a series of antennas deployed in two coastal lowland streams on the southern Oregon coast. Percentage return of estuary tagged parr (fish ≥ 60 mm <b>tagged</b> in <b>spring</b> and summer of their first year) was variable between years and streams. For the 2010 return year, subyearling estuarine migrants was 2. 5 times higher than stream residents in Palouse Creek. Fork length at estuary entrance was reconstructed for one return year of spawning fish based on otolith Sr:Ca and Br:Ca. Four main life history strategies were identified based on their fork length at time of estuary/ocean entrance: early migrating fry (70 mm fork length). Overall, 30 % (Larson Creek) to 42 % (Palouse Creek) of the 2009 spawning run was made up of fish that displayed evidence of estuarine residence during their first year. This study confirms that subyearling estuarine migrating coho salmon survive to reproductive age and contribute to subsequent generations. The survival of this life history type likely varies between years with changing ocean and stream conditions. It is hypothesized that their life history serves as a "bet hedging" strategy that supports coastal populations in years of poor stream conditions. In the face of rising sea levels, this life history may represent a key to the future viability of coho salmon stocks in coastal watersheds...|$|R
40|$|This report {{summarizes}} the emigration {{studies of the}} Nez Perce Tribe in the Imnaha River subbasin during the 2001 and 2002 migration years. A migration year for the Imnaha River is defined here as beginning July 31 {{of the previous year}} and ending July 30 the following year. The conclusion of the studies at the end of migration year 2002 marked the 11 th year of the Nez Perce Tribe's Lower Snake River Emigration Studies. The Nez Perce Tribe has participated in the Fish Passage Center's Smolt Monitoring Program for nine of the 11 years. These studies collect and tag juvenile chinook salmon and steelhead at two locations in the fall, rkm 74 and rkm 7, and at rkm 7 during the spring. Data from captured and tagged fish provide an evaluation of hatchery production and releases strategies, post release survival of hatchery chinook salmon, abundance of natural chinook salmon, and downstream survival and arrival timing of natural and hatchery chinook salmon and steelhead. The hydrologic conditions that migrating fish encountered in 2001 were characterized as a drought and conditions in 2002 were characterized as below average. Hatchery chinook salmon had a mean fork length that was 34 mm greater in 2001 and 35 mm greater in 2002 than the mean fork length of natural chinook smolts. Hatchery steelhead smolt mean fork lengths were 39 mm greater than natural steelhead smolts in 2001 and 44 mm greater than natural steelhead smolt fork lengths in 2002. A significant difference (p < 0. 05) between hatchery and natural chinook salmon and steelhead fork lengths has been documented by these emigration studies from 1997 to 2002. Hatchery chinook salmon were volitionally released in 2001 and 2002 and the 90 % arrivals for 2001 and 2002 at the lower rkm 7 trap were within the range of past observations of 22 to 38 days observed in 1999 and 2000. We estimated that 93. 9 % of the 123, 014 hatchery chinook salmon released in 2001 survived to the lower trap and 90. 2 % of the 303, 769 hatchery chinook salmon released in 2002 survived to the lower trap. Post release survival estimates for hatchery chinook salmon were within the range of past estimates; 88. 4 % in 1998 to 100. 9 % in 1994. An estimated 7, 646 to 23, 249 (95 % C. I.) natural chinook salmon smolts migrated past the lower Imnaha River trap from April 4 to April 22. An additional 6, 767 to 14, 706 (95 % C. I.) natural chinook salmon smolts migrated past the lower Imnaha River trap from April 23 to May 14, 2002. Natural chinook salmon captured and tagged at the upper rkm 74 trap survived to Lower Granite Dam (LGR) at a rate of 28. 8 % during migration year 2001 and 21. 9 % during migration year 2002. The survival estimate for fall tagged natural chinook salmon from the lower trap to LGR was 41. 9 % in 2001 and 33. 3 % in 2002. Differences between survival from release to LGR for fall tagged natural chinook salmon from the lower trap have been 5. 9 % to 16. 9 % higher than for fall tagged natural chinook salmon from the upper trap from 1994 to 2002. <b>Spring</b> PIT <b>tag</b> release groups of natural chinook salmon, hatchery chinook salmon, and hatchery steelhead produced estimates of survival from the trap to LGR within the range of past estimates since 1993. Estimated survival from release to LGR for 2001 and 2002 were as follows: 83. 7 % and 86. 9 % for natural chinook salmon, 80. 3 % and 77. 3 % for hatchery chinook salmon, 82. 7 % and 81. 8 % for natural steelhead, and 82. 0 % and 83. 0 % for hatchery steelhead. Estimates of survival for <b>spring</b> <b>tagged</b> fish from the trap to Lower Monumental Dam (LMO) during the drought of 2001 were the lowest estimates of survival from 1998 to 2002 for natural chinook salmon, and from 1997 to 2002 for natural and hatchery steelhead. Estimates of migration year 2001 survival from the trap to LMO were as follows: 65. 6 % - natural chinook salmon, 68. 9 % - hatchery chinook salmon, 49. 7 % natural steelhead, and 42. 9 % - hatchery steelhead. Estimates of migration year 2002 survival from the trap to LMO were as follows: 76. 8 % - natural chinook salmon, 68. 1 % - hatchery chinook salmon, 69. 9 % natural steelhead, and 78. 0 % - hatchery steelhead. A smolt-to-adult return rate (SAR) index from LGR to LGR was calculated for migrating pre-smolt and smolt natural chinook salmon, that were PIT tagged in the fall and spring at the lower trap, for brood years 1996 to 1998 (migration years 1998 to 2000). The SARs are representative of in-river Imnaha natural chinook salmon. The LGR to LGR SAR index for presmolt chinook salmon is as follows: 3. 08 % (BY 1996), 2. 41 % (BY 1997), and 2. 98 % (BY 1998). Smolt-to-adult return rate index for <b>spring</b> <b>tagged</b> smolts was lower: 1. 75 % (BY 1996), 2. 24 % (BY 1997) and 2. 94 % (BY 1998).

40|$|From 1970 s, {{year round}} field {{samplings}} and observations of Funka Bay {{have been conducted}} aboard the R/V Ushio-Maru, Faculty of Fisheries, Hokkaido University. The hydrographic, chemical, and biological data {{have been used to}} understand the ecosystem of Funka Bay, especially the relationships among the biological production of low trophic levels, nutrient dynamics, and the behavior of the Oyashio Coastal Water(OCW) from winter through early <b>spring.</b> <b>Tagging</b> experiments conducted by the Hokkaido National Fisheries Research Institute have shown that the Pacific population of walleye pollock occurs from the eastern side Hokkaido Island to northern coastal area of Honshu Island. The distribution of early stage eggs indicates that the spawning grounds are formed from the mouth of Funka Bay to the eastern shelf area outside of the bay. The relationship between the mean days required for 50 % hatching(D) and temperature(T) is expressed as follows; D= 31. 70 exp(- 0. 12 T) by development. Pollock eggs are transported into the bay, where hatchings initiate feeding on copepod nauplii. The feeding success of pollock larvae is higher in Tsugaru Warm Water, which stagnates in winter in the bay, than in OCW, which enters the bay in late January-early February. Early invasion of OCW into the bay is thought to increase the larval pollock mortality due to low temperature and transportation of carnivorous plankton. Strong year classes occurred only in years when late invasions of OCW were observed. With growth, the main food of pollock larvae and juveniles changed to copepodids such as Pseudocalanus newmanii, Neocalanus spp. and Eucalanus bungii. Their biological production might be controlled by the primary production from late winter through early spring, which might be affected by the behavior of OCW. Therefore, the annual fluctuation of the behavior of OCW is a factor affecting complicatedly the year class strength of the walleye pollock Pacific population...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. S.) University of Alaska Fairbanks, 2015 In Arctic Alaska, Dolly Varden Salvelinus malma {{is highly}} valued as a {{subsistence}} fish; however, {{little is known}} about oceanic dispersal or ecology. This study addresses this knowledge gap, by using a fisheries independent method, pop-up satellite archival <b>tags</b> (PSATs). In <b>spring</b> of 2012 and 2013, we attached 52 PSATs to Dolly Varden in a river in northwestern Alaska, which flows into the Arctic Ocean, to examine the marine dispersal, behavior and habitat occupancy of this species. Tagged Dolly Varden demonstrated two types of dispersal, including offshore and nearshore dispersal. The offshore type was the first documented northwesterly dispersal and occupancy of Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) areas of the Russian Chukchi Sea. While occupying this area, tagged Dolly Varden demonstrated affinity for the first 5 m of the water column, diel patterns in depth occupancy, and dive depths of up to 50 m, while experiencing a thermal environment of generally 3 - 7 °C. During the nearshore dispersal type, Dolly Varden transited in coastal areas of northwest Alaska, likely returning to their natal rivers to spawn. While in nearshore areas, tagged Dolly Varden always occupied shallow waters (< 6 m), and experienced a rapidly changing thermal environment (± 15 °C), including some waters temperatures cooler than - 1 °C. This study demonstrates that PSATs offer an alternative and effective platform with which to study several aspects of large adult Dolly Varden dispersal and ecology in areas where it is not practical or feasible to capture these fish, such as in coastal and offshore regions of Arctic Alaska. Additionally, {{the results of this study}} have increased our knowledge of the summer marine distribution, behavior and thermal environment of Dolly Varden in Arctic regions of Alaska, and this knowledge is important to several stake holders for the conservation of this important subsistence species...|$|R
40|$|During winter 2001, the U. S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) and Bonneville Power Administration (BPA) {{installed}} a prototype orifice-based PIT-tag interrogation system into the Washington Shore Ladder at Bonneville Dam (BWSL). Detectors were installed into 12 weirs: 4 downstream (Weirs 334 - 337) and 8 upstream (Weirs 352 - 359) from the fish release point (i. e., the exit ladder for the Adult Fish Facility). NOAA Fisheries (National Marine Fisheries Service [...] NMFS) tagged and released salmonids during 2001 to determine tag-reading efficiencies for different salmonid populations. Data analyses {{focused on the}} upper eight weirs. The 2001 <b>tagging</b> results for <b>spring</b> chinook salmon indicated that having detectors in four consecutive weirs would have been sufficient to yield a reading efficiency of 95 %. The BWSL orifice-based system performed well until the coho and fall chinook salmon migrations began. Coho and fall chinook salmon appeared to use the weir overflows, and thus avoid detection, at much higher rates than biologists expected. During 2001, technology advances {{led to the development}} of significantly larger antennas than had been available earlier, and thus it was possible to build antennas of approximately 2 x 6 ft. Consequently, it became feasible to design interrogation systems for ladder locations where all fish would have to go through the antennas and thus could not avoid detection by using the weir overflows (Fig. 1). Destron Technologies by Digital Angel designed a prototype interrogation system with two antennas that was installed into the counting-window area in the Oregon Ladder at McNary Dam, where its performance could then be directly compared to that of the orifice-based system in the same ladder. Although the orifice-based systems appeared less effective than the fisheries community wanted for fall chinook and coho salmon, the decision was made to proceed with installations planned for Bonneville and McNary Dams because valuable data would still be collected. During the winter of 2002, the Corps and BPA installed PIT-tag interrogation systems into the Bradford Island and Cascades Island Fish Ladders at Bonneville Dam and into the Washington and Oregon Ladders at McNary Dam. Like BWSL in 2001, these ladders had eight weirs (16 orifices) outfitted with fiberglass antennas. Douglas County Public Utility District also {{installed a}}n orifice-based system into its ladders at Wells Dam, but they were able to use weirs with no overflow sections wherein all fish had to swim through the orifice antennas. Thus, 2002 was the first year that the fisheries community had PIT-tag detection of adult salmonids at Bonneville, McNary, Wells, and Lower Granite Dams (Fig. 2). This overview will provide information on how well the systems at Bonneville and McNary Dams performed...|$|R
40|$|In 2005, the University of Washington {{developed}} a new statistical model to analyze the combined juvenile and adult detection histories of PIT-tagged salmon migrating through the Federal Columbia River Power System (FCRPS). This model, implemented by software Program ROSTER (River-Ocean Survival and Transportation Effects Routine), {{has been used to}} estimate survival and transportation effects on large temporal and spatial scales for PIT-tagged hatchery spring and summer Chinook salmon and steelhead released in the Snake River Basin from 1996 to 2003. Those results are reported here. Annual estimates of the smolt-to-adult return ratio (SAR), juvenile inriver survival from Lower Granite to Bonneville, the ocean return probability from Bonneville to Bonneville, and adult upriver survival from Bonneville to Lower Granite are reported. Annual estimates of transport-inriver (T/I) ratios and differential post-Bonneville mortality (D) are reported on both a systemwide basis, incorporating all transport dams analyzed, and a dam-specific basis. Transportation effects are estimated only for dams where at least 5, 000 tagged smolts were transported from a given upstream release group. Because few tagged hatchery steelhead were transported in these years, no transportation effects are estimated for steelhead. Performance measures include age- 1 -ocean adult returns for steelhead, but not for Chinook salmon. Annual estimates of SAR from Lower Granite back to Lower Granite averaged 0. 71 % with a standard error (SE) of 0. 18 % for spring Chinook salmon from the Snake River Basin for tagged groups released from 1996 through 2003, omitting age- 1 -ocean (jack) returns. For summer Chinook salmon from the Snake River Basin, the estimates of annual SAR averaged 1. 15 % (SE= 0. 31 %). Only for the release years 1999 and 2000 did the Chinook SAR approach the target value of 2 %, identified by the NPCC as the minimum SAR necessary for recovery. Annual estimates of SAR for hatchery steelhead from the Snake River Basin averaged 0. 45 % (SE= 0. 11 %), including age- 1 -ocean returns, for release years 1996 through 2003. For release years when the ocean return probability from Bonneville back to Bonneville could be estimated (i. e., 1999 through 2003), it was estimated that on average approximately 86 % of the total integrated mortality for nontransported, <b>tagged</b> hatchery <b>spring</b> and summer Chinook, and 74 % for steelhead, occurred during the ocean life stage (i. e., from Bonneville to Bonneville). This suggests that additional monitoring and research efforts should include the ocean and estuary environment. Annual estimates of the systemwide T/I are weighted averages of the dam-specific T/I ratios for each transport dam (with {ge} 5, 000 tagged fish transported), weighted by the probabilities of being transported at each dam. The systemwide T/I compares the observed SAR under the existing transportation system with the expected SAR if the transportation system had not been operated. Estimates of 1. 0 indicate that the systemwide transportation program has no effect on SAR, while estimates > 1. 0 indicate that the transportation program increases SAR. Excluding the 2001 release group, the geometric mean of the systemwide T/I estimates for hatchery spring Chinook salmon from the Snake River Basin was 1. 15 (SE= 0. 03) for release years 1997 through 2003. The geometric mean of the systemwide T/I estimates for hatchery summer Chinook salmon from the Snake River Basin was 1. 28 (SE= 0. 13) for release years 1997 through 2000 and 2003. Estimates were much higher for the 2001 release groups. These estimates reflect transportation from Lower Granite and/or Little Goose for most release years, depending on the number of tagged smolts actually transported at each dam during each release year. Differential post-Bonneville mortality (D) is the ratio of post-Bonneville survival to Lower Granite Dam of transported fish to that of nontransported ('inriver') fish. Excluding the 2001 release year, the geometric mean of the D estimates for hatchery spring Chinook salmon from the Snake River Basin was 1. 00 (SE= 0. 09) for release years 1997 through 2003. For hatchery summer Chinook salmon from the Snake River Basin, the geometric mean of the D estimates was 1. 32 (SE= 0. 27) for release years 1997 through 2000 and 2003. These estimates reflect transportation from Lower Granite and/or Little Goose, depending on the number of tagged smolts actually transported at each dam during each release year. Approximately half the point estimates of D for both spring and summer Chinook salmon were 1. 0 or greater, indicating that for those release groups, transported fish did not have lower ocean and adult survival than nontransported fish. For those years with estimates of D < 1. 0, the systemwide T/I estimates were always {ge} 1. 0, indicating that despite lower ocean and adult survival of transported fish, transportation did not lower SAR overall...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 2007 For {{many species}} of marine turtle the {{characteristics}} that define pelagic habitat {{have yet to be}} fully identified. A better understanding of these habitat characteristics is critical to reduce high seas fisheries interactions with turtles, especially as the status of many turtle populations has placed them on the threatened or endangered species list. The combination of high-resolution satellite-tracking data with remotely sensed oceanographic data makes it possible to identify habitat for loggerhead turtles by analyzing the behavior of individual animals. Bycatch of loggerhead turtles in longline fisheries can also be examined using the same high-resolution oceanographic data to determine if there are identifiable habitat differences in high- and low- bycatch areas. I analyzed the tracks of ten loggerhead turtles <b>tagged</b> in the <b>spring</b> and fall of 1998 near Madeira, Portugal in relation to the marine environment they occupied. To determine the relationship between an individual turtle and its environment, some measure of behavior was necessary. I calculated the straightness index (SI), the ratio of the displacement of the animal to the total distance traveled, for individual weekly segments of the ten tracks as a measure of individual behavior. I then extracted information about the chlorophyll, sea-surface temperature (SST), bathymetry, and geostrophic current of the ocean in a 20 km buffer surrounding the tracks, and examined the relationship between the straightness index and those characteristics using logistic regression. Chlorophyll a value, bathymetry, and movement of the turtle with geostrophic currents were consistently related to the straightness index of the tracks of all ten animals (two-sided p-value from Wald's test: 0. 005, 0. 0017, and 0. 0018, respectively). Tracks were less straight in high chlorophyll regions and in shallower ocean areas, and animals {{were more likely to be}} moving with prevailing geostrophic currents during straighter track segments. These results confirm comparable analyses of loggerhead tracks in the Pacific, and indicate that sea turtles alter their behavior (likely representing a shift from traveling to foraging) when they encounter high-chlorophyll regions. Turtles with highly sinuous tracks spend more time in a given area or habitat than those who pass straight through, and therefore may be more susceptible to incidental capture by fisheries operating in those habitats. To address the fisheries bycatch/ habitat interactions I analyzed longline bycatch data to determine whether the marine environmental variables identified in the first part of my study were related to the probability of catching a turtle on a given longline set. I performed a logistic regression analysis using bycatch of turtles as the response variable, and bathymetry, SST, SST gradient (indicative of frontal activity), chlorophyll a, and chlorophyll a gradient as the independent variables. I also included the location and the date of the longline sets as potential predictor variables. I found that the most important variables predicting the odds that a turtle would be caught on a given set were chlorophyll a value in the area of the haul (Wald's test, p= 0. 009) and the latitude at the beginning of the haul (Wald's test, p= 0. 0005). Turtles were more likely to be caught on sets in lower chlorophyll regions and in higher latitude regions of the data set, and there was no indication of important effects of bathymetry. These results disagree with my predictions from the tracking analysis, either because the fisheries-dependent bycatch data set did not provide enough contrast of habitat types, or because bycatch probability is not related to turtle behavior. My results indicate a difference between the critical variables selected as predictors of turtle habitat using the bycatch data and those selected using the behavior of individual tracked animals. While bycatch information is important, the distribution of fisheries data is highly biased towards frontal zones and regions of historic high catch. Judgments about turtle behavior based on only fisheries interactions could lead to incorrect conclusions about where animals spend the majority of their time. Assuming that animals are more likely to have an increased probability of interaction with longlines in areas where they spend more time foraging, fishing pressure should be reduced in those areas of high-use for pelagic loggerheads. It is crucial to base fisheries time-area closures and the design of marine protected areas on the behavior of tracked animals, and not just on fisheries bycatch data...|$|R
40|$|This report {{summarizes}} the Nez Perce Tribe (NPT) Department of Fisheries Resources Management (DFRM) {{results for the}} Lower Snake River Compensation Plan (LSRCP) Hatchery Evaluation studies and the Imnaha River Smolt Monitoring Program (SMP) for the 2007 smolt migration from the Imnaha River, Oregon. These studies are closely coordinated and provide information about juvenile natural and hatchery spring/summer Naco x (Chinook Salmon; Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) and Heeyey (steelhead; O. mykiss) biological characteristics, emigrant timing, survival, arrival timing and travel time to the Snake River dams and McNary Dam (MCD) on the Columbia River. These studies provide information on listed Naco x (Chinook salmon) and Heeyey (steelhead) for the Federal Columbia River Power System (FCRPS) Biological Opinion (NMFS 2000). The Lower Snake River Compensation Plan program's goal is to maintain a hatchery production program of 490, 000 Naco x (Chinook salmon) and 330, 000 Heeyey (steelhead) for annual release in the Imnaha River (Carmichael et al. 1998, Whitesel et al. 1998). These hatchery releases occur to compensate for fish losses due to the construction and operation of the four lower Snake River hydroelectric facilities. One of the aspects of the LSRCP hatchery evaluation studies in the Imnaha River is to determine natural and hatchery Naco x (Chinook salmon) and Heeyey (steelhead) smolt performance, emigration characteristics and survival (Kucera and Blenden 1998). A long term monitoring effort was established to document smolt emigrant timing and post release survival within the Imnaha River, estimate smolt survival downstream to McNary Dam, compare natural and hatchery smolt performance, and collect smolt-to-adult return information. This project collects information for, and is part of, a larger effort entitled Smolt Monitoring by Federal and Non-Federal Agencies (BPA Project No. 198712700). This larger project provides data on movement of smolts out of major drainages and past dams on the Snake River and Columbia River. In season indices of migration strength and migration timing are provided for the run-at large at key monitoring sites. Marked smolts are utilized to measure travel time and estimate survival through key index reaches. Fish quality and descaling measures are recorded at each monitoring site and provide indicators of {{the health of the}} run. Co-managers in the Imnaha River subbasin (Ecovista 2004) have identified the need to collect information on life history, migration patterns, juvenile emigrant abundance, reach specific smolt survivals, and Smolt-to-Adult Return rates (SAR's) for both Heeyey (steelhead) and Naco x (Chinook salmon) smolts. The current study provides information related to the majority of the high priority data needs. Current funding does not allow for determination of a total (annual) juvenile emigrant abundance and lack of adult passive integrated transponder (PIT) tag detectors {{at the mouth of the}} Imnaha River results in the inability to calculate tributary specific SAR's. Information is shared with the Fish Passage Center (FPC) on a real time basis during the spring emigration period. The Bonneville Power Administration (BPA) and the United States Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) contracted the NPT to monitor emigration timing and tag up to 19, 000 emigrating natural and hatchery Naco x (Chinook salmon) and Heeyey (steelhead) smolts from the Imnaha River with passive integrated transponder (PIT) tags. The completion of trapping in the spring of 2007 marked the 16 th year of emigration studies on the Imnaha River, and the 14 th year of participating in the FPC smolt monitoring program. Monitoring and evaluation objectives were to: (1) Evaluate effects of flow, temperature and other environmental factors on juvenile migration timing. (2) Determine emigration timing, travel time, and in-river survival of PIT tagged hatchery Naco x (Chinook salmon) smolts released at the Imnaha River acclimation facility to the Imnaha River juvenile migration trap. (3) Monitor the daily catch and biological characteristics of juvenile Naco x (Chinook salmon) and Heeyey (steelhead) smolts collected at the Imnaha River screw trap. (4) Determine spring emigration timing of Naco x (Chinook salmon) and Heeyey (steelhead) smolts collected at the Imnaha River juvenile migration trap. (5) Compare emigration characteristics and survival rates of natural fall and <b>spring</b> <b>tagged</b> juvenile Naco x (Chinook salmon). (6) Determine arrival timing, travel time and estimated survival of PIT tagged natural and hatchery Naco x (Chinook salmon) and natural and hatchery Heeyey (steelhead) smolts from the Imnaha River to Snake and Columbia River dams...|$|R
40|$|Sexual {{maturation}} during commercial {{culture of}} Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua L.) represents a significant production bottleneck restricting {{the profitability of}} the industry. Such problems in other species have traditionally been addressed by artificial manipulation of photoperiod cycles, however little research exists in this field in cod. This thesis therefore investigates the interactions between artificial photoperiod manipulation, sexual maturation and somatic growth in this species. In the first experiment, populations of Atlantic cod (hatched, spring 1999) were maintained on either a simulated natural photoperiod (SNP) or continuous illumination (LL) from approximately 15 months post hatch (MPH) (July 2000) in an enclosed tank system. Growth performance was recorded monthly along with observations of reproductive activity over the subsequent 2 years (up to July 2002). At both 2 and 3 years of age the entire population raised under SNP matured and spawned, during which time mean weight reduced by 13 % and 24 % respectively. No spawning individuals were recorded at 2 years {{of age in the}} LL population and only 18 % were observed to spawn at 3. However, observations of both changes in gonadal morphology (observed via ultrasound scanning) and a suppression in growth rate at 2 years of age in the LL population alluded to a maturation “dummy run” regulated by an endogenous clock. Despite this phenomenon, the LL treatment realised a 39 % and 43 % improvement in wet weight following 1 and 2 years of exposure to LL respectively. When the diel cycle of plasma melatonin was compared between the treatments in February 2001 (23 MPH) the SNP population displayed an A-profile diel rhythm ranging between 20 and 50 pg/ml while the LL treatment did not display any rhythm. In the second experiment of this work, two populations of cod (hatched, spring 2001) were reared in commercial open cage systems, one of which experienced continuous additional artificial illumination between July 2002 (15 MPH) and October 2003 (30 MPH) provided by four, 400 W submerged lighting units. Growth and maturation were assessed in both populations throughout. In March 2003 (24 MPH) it was apparent that spawning individuals were present in both the SNP and LL populations though a significantly lower number of spawning individuals in the LL treatment suggested that the peak in spawning activity was delayed by about 1 to 2 months. With both populations apparently maturing at 2 years of age, {{there was no significant difference}} in weight between the populations at the end of the trial. In comparison to experiments I and IV of this work, these results would suggest that in comparison to salmonids for example, Atlantic cod appear to have a heightened sensitivity to light allowing individuals to differentiate the ambient photoperiod signal from the application of continuous artificial light. In the third experiment, 6 populations of approximately 20 <b>tagged</b> individuals (hatched <b>spring</b> 1999) were maintained, from December 2000 to July 2002, under either SNP, LL or one of four, out of season “square wave” photoperiod regimes (repeating cycles with a 12 month period, consisting of a 6 month window of LL followed by six months of short day lengths [SD, 7 L: 17 D] which had been staggered to start over a six month period). Each individual was monitored monthly for maturation status. Out of season “square wave” photoperiods were demonstrated to successfully entrain maturation and hence significantly alter the spawning profiles in these populations. Application of LL from December 2000 failed to inhibit maturation in the spring of 2001 and, in fact, advanced the spawning season by 1 month while those that experienced SD from the same date showed significant extension of the subsequent spawning season. Interestingly, the males maintained on LL throughout the experiment matured both in the spring of 2001 and one year later in the spring of 2002 while females under the same treatment only matured and spawned in 2001. In the fourth experiment, a total of 830 tagged individuals were raised either under SNP or one of 7 photoperiod treatments, consisting of 5 groups transferred from SNP to LL at 3 monthly intervals between 6 and 18 MPH where they remained and a further two groups maintained on LL from 6 to 15 MPH and 6 to 21 MPH respectively before being returned to SNP. Both the gonadic and somatic axes were monitored at the physiological and endocrinological level at three monthly intervals from 6 to 27 MPH. The results demonstrated that it is the falling autumnal photoperiod signal after the summer solstice, more specifically after October, that is responsible for recruiting individuals to enter the sexual maturation cycle. Furthermore, in all treatments where this signal was masked i. e. those which experienced LL starting at or prior to 15 MPH, except for some restricted spermatogenic activity in the males testis observed at 27 MPH, there was no significant reproductive activity and growth was improved by up to 60 % at 27 MPH. While providing evidence for direct photic stimulation of somatic growth, the growth results were also correlated with the measurement of plasma IGF-I and demonstrated its potential as a tool to assess growth rates in the species. Plasma melatonin measured at 15 MPH, as in experiment I, was suppressed in all populations which were under LL photoperiods. By identifying the photoperiod “window of opportunity” which recruits individuals into the sexual maturation cycle, this work was able to conclude that the application of LL from the summer solstice prior to maturation is the most efficient photoperiod strategy to be adopted by the aquaculture industry to realise maximum growth potential from their cultured stocks.
