500|$|Steven Rea of The Philadelphia Inquirer {{gave the}} film {{a score of}} 3 out of 4; he said: [...] "Woodley...balances grace with gravity, wit with heart." [...] A. O. Scott writing for The New York Times said: [...] "The film sets out to make you weepnot just sniffle or <b>choke</b> <b>up</b> a little, but sob until your nose runs and your face turns blotchy. It succeeds." [...] The Boston Globe's Ty Burr gave the film a rating of 2.5 out 4 and said: [...] "If Elgort's Gus is glibly charming and {{ultimately}} affecting, The Fault in Our Stars belongs to Woodley, a performer who {{always seems to be}} backing warily into her own movies." ...|$|E
500|$|... "At Long Last Leave" [...] has {{received}} generally positive reviews from television critics, [...] particularly for its couch gag in the Simpsons opening sequence. This couch gag features a frame-by-frame montage of previous couch gags that pulls {{back into a}} photomosaic of the number [...] "500". The A.V. Club critic Hayden Childs wrote that the [...] "best thing about the 500th Simpsons episode is the opening couch montage, which hits the nostalgia bullseye almost perfectly." [...] HitFix's Alan Sepinwall praised the couch gag as being [...] "marvelous", noting that it [...] "actually made me <b>choke</b> <b>up</b> a bit." [...] Sepinwall commended [...] "At Long Last Leave", commenting that [...] "like many latter-day Simpsons outings, [...] features a story we've seen variations on several times before (including in The Simpsons Movie), but also features many funny jokes that affirm my belief that I'm happier {{to live in a}} world that keeps giving us new Simpsons episodes [...] than I will be in the one where that inevitably stops." [...] Similarly to Sepinwall, Tim Goodman of The Hollywood Reporter wrote: [...] "I got a few laughs and that's all I ever look for in The Simpsons these days. I just like knowing it's still there. [...] It doesn't have the spring in the legs quite like it used to. It's not going to dazzle at the same spectacular rate. But even after 500 episodes, it still has a little something left." [...] Goodman described the couch gag as [...] "lovely".|$|E

He writes, [...] "I had not imagined I might <b>choke</b> <b>up...</b> at that moment George W Bush wasn't just the president. He was a compassionate human being who had a sense of what Joyce and I were going through."

[...] On the final scene in which the main cast silently farewell Morse and Hunter, Bell said, [...] "When Paul Zbyszewski was pitching it in the room, he was getting <b>choked</b> <b>up,</b> we were in the room getting <b>choked</b> <b>up,</b> and then we all read it and we got <b>choked</b> <b>up.</b> At the table read, where everyone is saying goodbye, everyone is getting <b>choked</b> <b>up</b> there and...then on the day at the bar that we shot at, everybody was a mess.

60|$|A curious {{example of}} the {{struggle}} between plants has been communicated to me by Mr. John Ennis, a resident in New Zealand. The English water-cress grows so luxuriantly in that country as to completely <b>choke</b> <b>up</b> the rivers, sometimes leading to disastrous floods, and necessitating great outlay to keep the stream open. But a natural remedy has now been found in planting willows on the banks. The roots of these trees penetrate {{the bed of the}} stream in every direction, and the water-cress, unable to obtain the requisite amount of nourishment, gradually disappears.|$|E

6000|$|... § XXXVIII. Several distinctions in the {{quantity}} and style of the ornament must instantly follow from this great distinction in its position. First, in its quantity. For, observe: since in the Doric profile, c of Fig. V., the contour itself is to be composed of {{the surface of the}} ornamentation, this ornamentation must be close and united enough to form, or at least suggest, a continuous surface; it must, therefore, be rich in quantity and close in aggregation; otherwise it will destroy the massy character of the profile it adorns, and approximate it to its opposite, the concave. On the other hand, the ornament left projecting from the concave, must be sparing enough, and dispersed enough, to allow the concave bell to be clearly seen beneath it; otherwise it will <b>choke</b> <b>up</b> the concave profile, and approximate it to its opposite, the convex.|$|E

60|$|The {{island of}} Torcello is some {{five miles away}} from Venice, in the {{northern}} lagoon. The city was founded far back in the troubled morning of Christian civilization, by refugees from barbarian invasion, and built with stones quarried from the ruins of old Altinum, over which Attila had passed desolating. During the first ages of its existence Torcello enjoyed the doubtful advantage of protection from the Greek emperors, but fell afterward under the domination of Venice. In the thirteenth century the debris of the river that emptied into the lagoon there began to <b>choke</b> <b>up</b> the wholesome salt canals, and to poison the air with swampy malaria; and {{in the seventeenth century}} the city had so dwindled that the Venetian podestà removed his residence from the depopulated island to Burano,--though the bishopric established immediately after the settlement of the refugees at Torcello continued there till 1814, to the satisfaction, no doubt, of the frogs and mosquitoes that had long inherited the former citizens.|$|E
