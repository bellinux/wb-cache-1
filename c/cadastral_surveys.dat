25|$|Many Japanese {{settlers}} {{were interested}} in acquiring agricultural land in Korea even before Japanese land ownership was officially legalized in 1906. Governor-General Terauchi Masatake facilitated settlement through land reform, which initially proved popular {{with most of the}} Korean population. The Korean land ownership system was a system of absentee landlords, only partial owner-tenants and cultivators with traditional (but no legal proof of) ownership. Terauchi's new Land Survey Bureau conducted <b>cadastral</b> <b>surveys</b> that reestablished ownership by basis of written proof (deeds, titles, and similar documents). Ownership was denied to those who could not provide such written documentation; these turned out to be mostly high-class and impartial owners who had only traditional verbal cultivator rights. Japanese landlords included both individuals and corporations such as the Oriental Development Company. Many former Korean landowners, as well as agricultural workers, became tenant farmers, having lost their entitlements almost overnight.|$|E
25|$|Kenshin's {{military}} {{success is}} related to his successful reform efforts on trade, market, transportation network (taxing mechanism in the port towns), and revenues generated by the cloth trade. The result was control over commerce which previously government did not have. He also established feudal ties with the warrior population by land grants. The so-called Funai Statutes show the provisions that apply to the traditional elites and common folk, tax breaks due to war exhaustion, with intent to centralize and consolidate the lands around his capital, which were followed by further reforms for the consolidation of the imperial lands prior the 1560–1562 Kantō campaign. However, despite Kenshin's control over agriculture and economy, he did not thoroughly implement key reforms such as <b>cadastral</b> <b>surveys,</b> important for military obligations, implying Kenshin's focus on commerce. The management of the administration, military organization, as well in some minor battles in Echigo Funai were handed by vassal Kurata Gorōzaemon.|$|E
2500|$|In 1851 {{the south}} {{peak of the}} {{mountain}} was selected by Colonel Leander Ransom as the initial point [...] where the Mount Diablo Base and Mount Diablo Meridian lines intersect [...] for <b>cadastral</b> <b>surveys</b> of a large area. [...] Subsequent surveys in much of California, Nevada and Oregon were located with reference to this point. Toll roads up the mountain were created in 1874 by Joseph Seavey Hall and William Camron (sometimes [...] "Cameron"); Hall's Mount Diablo Summit Road was officially opened on May 2, 1874. [...] Camron's [...] "Green Valley" [...] road opened later. [...] Hall also built the 16-room Mountain House Hotel near the junction of the two roads, a mile below the summit (2,500 foot elevation, operated through the 1880s, abandoned 1895, burned c. 1901). As far north as Meridian Road, {{on the outskirts of}} Chico, California, the summit was used as a reference point. The road is colinear with the summit, and is named for the meridian which intersects it.|$|E
40|$|New Zealand {{currently}} has a world-class property rights system that underpins {{the delivery of}} social, economic, and cultural benefits. This system comprises a land tenure system to provide certainty about property rights and a supporting <b>cadastral</b> <b>survey</b> system to provide certainty about the spatial extent of those rights. However, there is an increasing concern that New Zealand’s property rights system will not continue to be optimal in the future. A significant contributing factor to this concern is {{the inability of the}} <b>cadastral</b> <b>survey</b> system to handle three-dimensional (3 D) information defining the spatial extents of property rights in a digital environment. The development of 3 D <b>cadastral</b> <b>survey</b> systems {{is the subject of a}} substantial body of international research and discussion. Despite this, no country in the world has successfully implemented a fully functioning 3 D digital <b>cadastral</b> <b>survey</b> system. Also, while New Zealand has an interest in developing a 3 D digital <b>cadastral</b> <b>survey</b> system, there is no substantive local research on the matter. The research undertaken as part of this thesis will contribute to the literature by providing a New Zealand perspective on developing such a system and will also feed into the development of New Zealand’s <b>cadastral</b> <b>survey</b> system. This research explores New Zealand’s current <b>cadastral</b> <b>survey</b> system and considers the motivation for its enhancement. The literature supporting international research and development is evaluated to determine the characteristics, opportunities, issues and approaches associated with developing a <b>cadastral</b> <b>survey</b> system with 3 D digital capabilities. A preferred approach to a 3 D digital <b>cadastral</b> <b>survey</b> system is established and then developed at a conceptual level after it was found that an internationally standardised approach was inadequate...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the investigation of}} UAVs (Unmanned Aerial Vehicles) for use in <b>cadastral</b> <b>surveying.</b> Within the scope of a pilot study UAVs were tested for capturing geodata and compared with conventional data acquisition methods for <b>cadastral</b> <b>surveying.</b> Two study sites were therefore surveyed with a tachymeter-GNSS combination {{as well as a}} UAV system. The workflows of both methods were investigated and the resulting data were compared with the requirements of Swiss <b>cadastral</b> <b>surveying.</b> Concerning data acquisition and evaluation, the two systems are found to be comparable in terms of time expenditure, accuracy, and completeness. In conclusion, the UAV image orientation proved to be the limiting factor for the obtained accuracy due to the low- cost camera including camera calibration, image quality, and definition of the ground control points (natural or artificial). However, the required level of accuracy for <b>cadastral</b> <b>surveying</b> was reached. The advantage of UAV systems lies in their high flexibility and efficiency in capturing the surface of an area from a low flight altitude. In addition, further information such as orthoimages, elevation models and 3 D objects can easily be gained from UAV images. Altogether, this project endorses the benefit of using UAVs in cadastral applications and the new opportunities they provide for <b>cadastral</b> <b>surveying...</b>|$|R

The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to describe the Australian Cadastral System with an emphasis on <b>cadastral</b> <b>surveying</b> and mapping and the role of the professional land surveyor. First an overview of the Australian land market is presented, followed by a discussion of the difference between European cadastres and cadastral systems developed under English Common Law. Next the historical development and current status of both the Torrens System of title registration and the <b>cadastral</b> <b>surveying</b> system is given. The trend for Australian cadastral systems to move from <b>cadastral</b> <b>surveying</b> of individual parcels to an integrated cadastral mapping system is highlighted together with the development of the associated digital cadastral databases. The paper describes the professional qualifications required of a land surveyor as well as the institutions supporting the survey system. The relationship of the cadastral system to the development of state-wide land information systems is discussed. The paper concludes by highlighting future trends in the Australian cadastral system. 1 July 1994 Open Acces...|$|R
