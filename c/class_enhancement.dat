40|$|After {{the direct}} {{training}} of baseline conditional relations, {{the emergence of}} derived relations that have the properties of reflexivity, symmetry and transitivity documents the formation of equivalence classes. Studies on the formation of these equivalence classes {{have shown that the}} probability of class formation is influenced by a wide array of variables. The meaningfulness of the stimuli used {{has been found to be}} one of such important variables. The formation of equivalence classes that include meaningless or abstract stimuli only has been found to be less probable. However, the inclusion of a meaningful stimulus, such as a familiar picture in a set of other meaningless stimuli can help to convert that set of stimuli into an equivalence class. In five studies with college students, this thesis has explored the properties of meaningful stimuli that account for the <b>class</b> <b>enhancement</b> they produce. Study 1 explored how a simple discriminative function acquired by an abstract stimulus through simultaneous and/or successive discrimination training enhanced the formation of an equivalence class of which that stimulus was a member. In two experiments, Study 2 investigated how the order of training, familiar pictures, and abstract stimuli that acquired discriminative functions influenced equivalence class formation. In yet another two experiments, Study 3 studied the effect of the use of a meaningful stimulus as a class member on equivalence class formation. Two parallel groups were trained to form three 3 -node 5 -member equivalence classes (A B C D E) under the simultaneous protocol in both experiments. The baseline relations AB, BC, CD, and DE were trained in a serialized manner in Experiment 1 while Experiment 2 involved the concurrent training of baseline relations. Study 4 investigated whether the acquisition of an identity conditional discriminative function by a meaningless stimulus using simultaneous or delayed matching procedures would influence the likelihood of formation of an equivalence class of which it is a member along with other meaningless stimuli. In a replication to Study 4, Study 5 investigated how equivalence class formation was enhanced by the inclusion of one abstract stimulus that had acquired an identity or arbitrary conditional discriminative function on a simultaneous or delayed basis, prior to the establishment of the classes. In addition to their traditional connotative and denotative properties, these studies extend our knowledge on the class enhancing properties of meaningful stimuli to include acquired discriminative functions and delayed relational (identity and arbitrary) functions. The studies also strengthen existing findings that the inclusion of a meaningful stimulus in a set of other meaningless class enhances the formation of equivalence classes. However, its inclusion alone is shown to be insufficient to generate the <b>class</b> <b>enhancement</b> and that, the order of introduction in the serial training of the baseline relations for a class, the structural location of the meaningful stimulus in the training structure as well as its behavioral functions interact with the meaningful stimulus to account for their <b>class</b> <b>enhancement.</b> Finally, there was a strong concordance between two trial formats: matching to sample trials during class formation and sorting during post class formation sorting test in terms of participants’ performances indicative of equivalence class formation...|$|E

40|$|The {{inclusion}} of a meaningful stimulus {{in a set of}} abstract stimuli enhances the likelihood of forming an equivalence class with the set. <b>Class</b> <b>enhancement</b> effects can be due to the discriminative, conditional discriminative, and class-based behavioral functions served by the meaningful stimulus. This experiment determined whether acquisition of an identity conditional discriminative function by an abstract stimulus enhances the formation of an equivalence class of which it is a member along with other abstract stimuli. Forty adults attempted to form 3 three-node five-member equivalence classes (A[*]→[*]B[*]→[*]C[*]→[*]D[*]→[*]E) using the simultaneous protocol. In the PIC group, the C stimuli were pictures and the A, B, D, and E stimuli were abstract shapes. In the ABS group, all of the stimuli were abstract shapes. In the Id-S-MTS (identity simultaneous matching-to-sample) and Id- 6 sD-MTS (identity 6 s delayed matching-to-sample) groups, prior to class formation, identity conditional discriminations were formed with the C stimuli using simultaneous or 6 s delayed matching-to-sample procedures, respectively. Classes were formed by 80 and 60 % of participants in the PIC and delayed identity groups, and by 0 and 10 % of participants with no prior training (ABS group) or after forming identity relations on a simultaneous basis. These outcomes were confirmed with post class formation sorting tests. Thus, a portion of the class enhancing effects of meaningful stimuli can be attributed to their presumed delayed identity conditional discriminative function. Adventitious coding or mediating behavior during identity training might have influenced acquisition of baseline relations and likelihood of class formation...|$|E

Recente proposta de tratamento cirúrgico para a insuficiência cardíaca {{terminal}} é a ventriculectomia parcial esquerda, não havendo publicações específicas sobre seus benefícios em pacientes acima de 60 anos. Objetivo: Estudar os resultados obtidos com o tratamento da miocardiopatia dilatada em pacientes acima de 60 anos, submetidos à ventriculectomia parcial esquerda. Método: Entre maio de 1995 e dezembro de 1997 dez pacientes com idade entre 62 e 78 anos, portadores de miocardiopatia dilatada em classe funcional IV (NYHA), foram submetidos à ventriculectomia parcial esquerda no Serviço de Cirurgia Cardiotorácica da Disciplina de Cirurgia Cardiotorácica da Universidade Federal de Mato Grosso do Sul - Núcleo de Hospital Universitário. A ressecção, de forma elíptica, foi realizada na parede lateral do VE, entre os dois músculos papilares, estendendo-se, desde o ápice até próximo do anel mitral. Resultados: Nove (90 %) pacientes receberam alta hospitalar e um paciente (10 %) evoluiu para óbito, no sexto dia de pós-operatório. O fragmento ressecado variou de 6 a 10, 5 cm de comprimento por 4 a 5, 5 cm de largura, com 10, 8 ± 1, 3 cm por 5 ± 0, 06 cm em média. O controle ecocardiográfico demonstrou: No seguimento, observou-se que três pacientes (30 %) encontram-se em grau funcional I (NYHA), três pacientes (30 %) em II e um paciente (10 %) em grau funcional III. A sobrevida atuarial desses pacientes foi de 100 %, 87 %, 87 % e 67 % para 6, 12, 24 e 36 meses de seguimento, respectivamente. Conclusão: A ventriculectomia parcial esquerda, realizada em pacientes com idade superior a 60 anos portadores de insuficiência cardíaca com severa disfunção hemodinâmica, apresentou mortalidade baixa, promovendo recuperação acentuada do desempenho cardíaco. Background: Cardiac insufficiency {{is one of}} {{the most}} important problems challenging the public health resources in the modern world. The partial left ventriculectomy (Batista's Operation) is the most recent surgical treatment for the end-stage heart failure but, until now, without specific reports in the cardiovascular literature regarding its results in elderly patients. Objective: To study the results of the Batista's Operation in aged patients. Method: From May 1995 to December 1997, ten patients aged 62 to 78 years, suffering from dilated cardiomyopathy (class IV NYHA), were treated with the partial left ventriculectomy procedure in the Cardiothoracic Surgical Clinic of the Cardiothoracic Surgery Department of Mato Grosso do Sul Federal University [...] (University Hospital Nucleus). Results: Nine (90 %) patients were discharged from the hospital and one (10 %) patient died in the 6 th postoperative day from respiratory insufficiency. An elliptical resection was performed in the lateral wall of the left ventricle, from the apex to near the atrioventricular groove and between the papillary muscles. Dimensions of the removed fragment (mean values) : 10. 8 + 1. 3 cm x 5. 0 + 0. 6 cm. The echocardiographic control has proved: FE = fractional shortening, EF = ejection fraction, LVSD = left ventricular end-systolic diameter, LVDD = left ventricular end-diastolic diameter, DVL = diastolic volume lowering and SVR = systolic volume rised. In the late follow up three patients were in NYHA class I, three patients in class II and one in class III. The actuarial survival rate were 100 %, 87 %, 87 % and 67 % for 6, 12, 24 and 36 months respectively.

There are two subclasses. One subclass is the chain: {Negative Laplace operator, Multiplication by Power (γ− 1) of modulus-Laplace value, Inverse Negative Laplace operator} together with generalized versions. The generalization of the Negative Laplace operator consists of replacing its isotropic frequency square transfer function by an (equally isotropic) modulusfrequency to-the-power-p transfer-function. The inverse is defined accordingly. The second subclass is the chain: {Vector-Gradient operator, Multiplication by Power (γ− 1) of modulus-gradient value, Inverse Vector-Gradient operator} together with generalized versions. We believe the Inverse Vector-Gradient operator (and its generalized version) to be a novel operation in image processing. The generalization of the Vector-Gradient operator consists of multiplying its transfer functions by an isotropic modulus-frequency to-thepower-(p− 1) transfer-function. The inverse is defined accordingly. Although the generalized (Inverse) Negative Laplace and Vector-Gradient operators are best implemented via the frequency domain, their point spread functions are checked for too large footprints {{in order to}} avoid spatial aliasing in practical (periodic image) implementations.
