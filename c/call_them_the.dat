25|$|Sir John Lubbock has {{proposed}} to <b>call</b> <b>them</b> <b>the</b> Archaeolithic, or Palaeolithic, and the Neolithic Periods respectively, terms which {{have met with}} almost general acceptance, and of which I shall avail myself {{in the course of}} this work.|$|E
25|$|By the 5th century BC, the Thracian {{presence}} was pervasive {{enough to have}} made Herodotus <b>call</b> <b>them</b> <b>the</b> second-most numerous people {{in the part of}} the world known by him (after the Indians), and potentially the most powerful, if not for their lack of unity. The Thracians in classical times were broken up into a large number of groups and tribes, though a number of powerful Thracian states were organized, such as the Odrysian kingdom of Thrace and the Dacian kingdom of Burebista. A type of soldier of this period called the Peltast probably originated in Thrace.|$|E
25|$|Ghiberti won the competition. His {{first set}} of Baptistry doors took 27 years to complete, after which he was {{commissioned}} to make another. In the total of 50 years that Ghiberti worked on them, the doors provided a training ground {{for many of the}} artists of Florence. Being narrative in subject and employing not only skill in arranging figurative compositions but also the burgeoning skill of linear perspective, the doors were to have an enormous influence on the development of Florentine pictorial art. They were a unifying factor, a source of pride and camaraderie for both the city and its artists. Michelangelo was to <b>call</b> <b>them</b> <b>the</b> Gates of Paradise.|$|E

Several 19th and 20th century occultists claimed to belong to or to have contacted these Secret Chiefs and made these communications known to others, including H.P. Blavatsky (who <b>called</b> <b>them</b> <b>the</b> [...] "Tibetan Masters" [...] or Mahatmas), C.W. Leadbeater and Alice A. Bailey (who <b>called</b> <b>them</b> Masters of <b>the</b> Ancient Wisdom), Guy Ballard and Elizabeth Clare Prophet (who <b>called</b> <b>them</b> Ascended Masters), Aleister Crowley (who used the term to refer {{to members of the}} upper three grades of his order, A∴A∴ [...] ), Dion Fortune (who <b>called</b> <b>them</b> <b>the</b> [...] "esoteric order"), and Max Heindel (who <b>called</b> <b>them</b> <b>the</b> [...] "Elder Brothers").|$|R

500|$|Bass's {{announcement}} {{received a}} large amount of media attention. The American public's reaction was generally positive, with Bass receiving [...] "overwhelming support" [...] from many teenagers and young adults who grew up listening to 'N Sync. However, Bass received criticism from the LGBT community when he referred to himself and his friends as [...] "straight-acting" [...] in his People interview, stating, [...] "I <b>call</b> <b>them</b> <b>the</b> SAGs— the straight-acting gays. We're just normal, typical guys. I love to watch football and drink beer." [...] This comment angered some members of the LGBT community, who believed that Bass not only implied that effeminate gay men were not 'normal', but further enforced unneeded stereotypes. In a 2007 interview with The Advocate, Bass called his comment a [...] "mistake" [...] and noted that he was unaware of the negative implications surrounding the term. Bass stated, [...] "Every community is hard to please. Our community is very fickle. It's a touchy community because it's the last civil rights movement we have left here in America. So when someone new like myself comes along and says off-the-mark things, yeah, I can see how people would get pissed." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Protestant philosopher George Berkeley (1685–1753), in his {{campaign}} against the religious implications of Newtonian mechanics, wrote a pamphlet {{on the lack of}} rational justifications of infinitesimal calculus: [...] "They are neither finite quantities, nor quantities infinitely small, nor yet nothing.

2500|$|French composers {{including}} Hector Berlioz {{struggled in}} vain against {{the tide of}} Italian operas. Berlioz succeeded in getting his opera [...] Benvenuto Cellini [...] staged at the Royal Academy in 1838, but it closed after just three performances, and was not staged again in France during his lifetime. [...] Berlioz complained in the Journal des Debats that there were six operas by Donizetti in Paris playing in one year. [...] "Monsieur Donizetti has the air to treat us like a conquered country," [...] he wrote, [...] "it is a veritable war of invasion. We can no longer <b>call</b> <b>them</b> <b>the</b> lyric theaters of Paris, just the lyric theaters of Monsieur Donizetti." ...|$|E
2500|$|The closest living {{language}} to {{them are the}} languages of the Mohawk & Tuscarora Iroquois, who once lived immediately {{north and south of}} them. The English and Dutch came to <b>call</b> <b>them</b> <b>the</b> Minqua, from Lenape, which breaks into min-kwe & translates to [...] "as a woman." [...] As to when they arrived, some early records detailing their oral history seem to point {{to the fact that they}} descended from an Iroquoian group who conquered Ohio centuries before, but were pushed back east again by Siouan and Algonquin enemies. They also conquered and absorbed other unknown groups in the process, which probably explains how languages like Tuscarora came to be so completely divergent from other Iroquoian languages. It also appears possible that the word [...] "Iroquois" [...] actually derived from their language.|$|E
2500|$|However, on 23 November 2001, the High Court of Ireland deemed this {{subcommittee}} {{of both houses}} of the Irish parliament to be unconstitutional. The state's appeal, on 11 April 2002, of this decision to the Supreme Court of Ireland failed when the latter body found in favour of 36 Gardaí who challenged the right of this particular committee to <b>call</b> <b>them.</b> <b>The</b> ground upon which The Supreme Court had ruled this committee unconstitutional was that the Oireachtas has no explicit, implicit or inherent power to conduct an inquiry which [...] could lead [...] "to adverse findings of fact and conclusions (including a finding of unlawful killing) as to the personal culpability of an individual {{not a member of}} the Oireachtas so as to impugn their good name is ultra vires in that the holding of such an inquiry is not within the inherent powers of the Oireachtas". The Thirtieth Amendment of the Constitution Bill 2011 was intended to reverse this judgment.|$|E

2500|$|In 1884, Harry Wright, {{the former}} manager of baseball's first openly {{professional}} team, the Cincinnati Red Stockings, was recruited as manager {{in hopes of}} reversing the team's fortunes. [...] Also in 1884, the team {{changed its name to}} the [...] "Philadelphias", as it was common for baseball teams in that era to be named after their cities (for instance, the [...] "Bostons" [...] and [...] "New Yorks"). [...] However, as [...] "Philadelphias" [...] was somewhat hard to fit in newspaper headlines, some writers still continued to <b>call</b> <b>them</b> <b>the</b> [...] "Quakers" [...] while others began shortening the name to [...] "Phillies." [...] At some point in the 1880s, the team accepted the shorter nickname [...] "Phillies" [...] as an official nickname. [...] "Quakers" [...] continued to be used interchangeably with [...] "Phillies" [...] until 1890, when the team officially became known as the [...] "Phillies." [...] This name is one of the longest continually used nicknames in professional sports by a team in the same city.|$|E
2500|$|Keane caused {{controversy}} in November 2000, when he criticised sections of United supporters after the Champions League victory over Dynamo Kyiv at Old Trafford. He {{complained about the}} lack of vocal support given by some fans when Dynamo were dominating the game, stating, [...] "Away from home our fans are fantastic, I'd <b>call</b> <b>them</b> <b>the</b> hardcore fans. But at home they have a few drinks and probably the prawn sandwiches, and they don't realise what's going on out on the pitch. I don't think {{some of the people who}} come to Old Trafford can spell 'football', never mind understand it." [...] Keane's comments started a debate in England about the changing atmosphere in football grounds, and the term [...] "prawn sandwich brigade" [...] is now part of the English football vocabulary, referring to people who attend football games or claim to be fans of football because it is fashionable rather than due to any genuine interest in the game.|$|E
2500|$|Like the Dragon Kings, {{they are}} an {{alternative}} player character type to the Exalted. They know themselves by their own word, Raksha; however the superstitious in Creation, rightly fearing that to name them is to invoke them, <b>call</b> <b>them</b> <b>the</b> Fair Folk {{with the hope of}} flattering and placating them. Unlike the Creation-born, who have a fixed, definite shape and form within the pattern of created things, Fair Folk are entities composed of Essence unadulterated with form, and thus they are without much constancy. They are natives of the Wyld, which they call Rakshastan [...] the place that exists between Creation and the Unshaped Chaos. Like the Wyld environment they inhabit, Fair Folk are partially and provisionally confined and defined by their proximity to the structure of Creation, temporarily taking on aspects of the created world by interacting with it. They are inhuman and beautiful beguiling monsters that subsist on elements of human subjectivity, devouring dreams, imbibing hopes and fears, and assuming narrative personalities stolen piecemeal from the Creation-born.|$|E

2500|$|Many times, {{they made}} the playoffs with horrendous records. In 1987–88, for instance, they {{finished}} with the second-worst record in the league (and the third-worst record in franchise history, at [...]325), and only a point ahead of the Minnesota North Stars for the worst record. However, the Norris Division was so weak that year (only the Red Wings finished with a winning record) that the Leafs and Stars were actually still in playoff contention {{on the last day}} of the season. [...] In those days, the four top teams in each division made the playoffs, regardless of record. [...] The Leafs defeated the Red Wings in the final game of the regular season, while the Stars lost to the Flames. [...] This handed the Leafs the final playoff spot from the division. [...] Despite one of the worst winning percentages ever for a playoff team, the Leafs gave the Red Wings a surprisingly tough series in the first round, pushing them to six games. [...] Many Leafs fans consider Ballard's tenure as owner to be the darkest era in team history; indeed, they only notched six winning seasons during Ballard's 18-plus years as majority owner, never finished above third in their division and only got out of the second round twice. [...] The Leafs' subpar performance led some to <b>call</b> <b>them</b> <b>the</b> [...] "Maple Laughs." [...] The Leafs' poor record resulted in several high draft picks. Wendel Clark, the first overall pick in the 1985 draft went on to captain the team.|$|E
2500|$|The bottom {{fell out}} in the 1972–73 season. For all intents and purposes, the season ended when Cunningham bolted to the ABA, leaving the Sixers with a roster of Greer and little else. The 76ers lost their first 15 games of the season, and {{a few months later}} set a then-record 20-game losing streak in a single season. Their record {{following}} the 20-game losing streak was 4–58, and the team at that point had just lost 34 of 35 games. The 76ers finished the season with a 9–73 record, leading the skeptical Philadelphia press to <b>call</b> <b>them</b> <b>the</b> [...] "Nine and 73-ers". Under coach Roy Rubin the 76ers went 4–47. It was his first and, as it turned out, his last NBA coaching job. He was succeeded by player-coach Kevin Loughery, who went 5–26 the rest of the way. The 76ers finished an NBA-record 59 games behind the Atlantic Division champion Boston Celtics. The nine wins by the 1972–73 squad is the fourth fewest in NBA history, and remains the fewest for a full 82 game season. The 73 losses, although threatened several times, remains the all-time low-water mark for any NBA franchise. The 76ers’ 0.110 winning percentage was a record worst at the time, and is still the second lowest in NBA history, broken only by the 2011–12 Charlotte Bobcats, who finished 7–59 for a [...]106 winning percentage in a season shortened due to a lockout. Only six seasons earlier, the 76ers had set the NBA record for most wins in a season. The 76ers of 1972–73 are generally considered to be the worst team an NBA franchise has ever put on the court – although NBA historian Kyle Wright argued in a 2007 study that owing to weaker schedules the 1992–93 Mavericks and 1997–98 Nuggets, both of whom won eleven games, plus the inaugural Cleveland Cavaliers who played an extremely weak schedule, were actually poorer teams.|$|E
