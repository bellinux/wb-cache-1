Frequencies determined from two engines of different cylinder sizes are shown to agree with the values calculated from sound theory. An outline of the theoretically possible modes of vibration in a right <b>circular</b> cylinder with <b>flat</b> <b>ends</b> is included. An appendix by John P.

40|$|The arc heated {{wind tunnel}} LBK of DLR {{is used to}} {{investigate}} the response of heat protection material to high enthalpy flow. The experimental study is performed using <b>circular</b> <b>flat</b> plates in the stagnation point area of blunt cylinders. The surface temperature distribution in the stagnation point area on two thermal protection materials and the heat flux rate of a catalytic wall are used to investigate the gas surface interaction of different materials with the air flow of high enthalpy. The sample holder consists of a spherical faced cylinder of SiC which holds a <b>circular</b> <b>flat</b> plate. The pressure at {{the surface of the}} heat protection material is measured by a Pitot probe and the heat flux rate by a heat flux probe of the same shape as the sample holder.
