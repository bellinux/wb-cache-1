However, by using glucose with C-1, the carbonyl <b>carbon,</b> <b>marked</b> with the isotope 13C in the reaction, researchers found that the α-dicarbonyl formed has the carbonyls located at C-5 and C-6 of the original glucose backbone. [...] The best mechanism proposed is that the α-dicarbonyl N 6-(2,3-dihydroxy-5,6-dioxohexyl)-L-lysinate, a key intermediate in the glucosepane reaction, forms from the Amadori product through a carbonyl shift {{all the way down}} the 6 carbon sugar backbone by keto-enol tautomerism and the elimination of the C-4 hydroxyl. [...] Further, evidence was given for the extent of the hypothesized carbonyl shift by using heavy hydrogen in the solvent water, D2O. [...] Researchers found that all the H-C-OH of the carbon backbone were converted to D-C-OH after the reaction, demonstrating that all the hydrogens got transferred out through keto-enol tautomerism, and thus the carbonyl shift went {{all the way down the}} backbone, finally eliminating the C-4 hydroxy group.|$|R

This paper outlines a formal heuristic procedure for identifying regular ties in valued networks where the “significance” of ties is related to each actor's role sets. Combined with measures for block criteria fulfillment, the procedure yields reduced graphs, which seem more sensitive to patterns, rather than strengths, of ties.

Recent evidence suggests that the rate of diffusion of hydrogen from the surface of Pd nanoparticles to the subsurface region critically affects the hydrogenation rate, as this rate dictates whether or not the nanoparticles can maintain a sufficient concentration of subsurface hydrogen species under operating conditions. Recent theoretical calculations predicted pronounced facilitation of subsurface hydrogen diffusion by coadsorbed carbon and identified the conceptual importance of atomically flexible low-coordinated surface sites on small metal clusters for the diffusion process.
