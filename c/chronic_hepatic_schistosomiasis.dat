40|$|Portal-systemic {{encephalopathy}} (PSE) {{is classified}} as type B hepatic encephalopathy. Portal-systemic shunting rather than liver dysfunction is {{the main cause of}} PSE in <b>chronic</b> <b>hepatic</b> <b>schistosomiasis</b> japonicum (HSJ) patients. Owing to lack of detectable evidence of intrinsic liver disease, chronic HSJ patients with PSE are frequently clinically undetected or misdiagnosed, especially chronic HSJ patients with covert PSE (subclinical encephalopathy). In this study, we investigated whether magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) could be a useful tool for diagnosing PSE in chronic HSJ patients. Magnetic resonance (MR) T 1 -weighted imaging, diffusion-weighted imaging, and MRS were performed in 41 chronic HSJ patients with suspected PSE and in 21 age-matched controls. The T 1 signal intensity index (T 1 SI) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) value were obtained in the Globus pallidus. Liver function was also investigated via serum ammonia and liver function tests. Higher T 1 SI and ADC values, increased lactate and glutamine levels, and decreased myo-inositol were found in the bilateral Globus pallidus in chronic HSJ patients with PSE. No significantly abnormal serum ammonia or liver function tests were observed in chronic HSJ patients with PSE. On the basis of these findings, we propose a diagnostic procedure for PSE in chronic HSJ patients. This study reveals that MRS can be useful for diagnosing PSE in chronic HSJ patients...|$|E

Silymarin (SIL) is a hepatoprotective and antioxidant medicament largely prescribed against liver diseases that has previously been shown to prevent fibrosis during acute murine schistosomiasis. Here we employed silymarin to try to reverse established <b>hepatic</b> fibrosis in <b>chronic</b> <b>schistosomiasis.</b> Silymarin or vehicle was administered to BALB/c mice every 48 h, start-ing on the 40 th (80 days of treatment), 70 th (50 days), or 110 th (10 days) day postinfection (dpi). All mice were sacrificed and analyzed at 120 dpi. Treatment with silymarin reduced liver weight and granuloma sizes, reduced the increase in alanine amino-transferase and aspartate aminotransferase levels, and reduced the established hepatic fibrosis (assessed by hydroxyproline con-tents and picrosirius staining). Treatment with silymarin also reduced the levels of interleukin- 13 (IL- 13) in serum and increased the gamma interferon (IFN-) /IL- 13 ratio.

40|$|Introduction Chronic {{hepatitis}} B {{virus and}} schistosomiasis are independently associated with significant mortality and morbidity worldwide. Despite much geographic overlap between these conditions and {{no reason why}} co-infection should not exist, we present what is, {{to the best of}} our knowledge, the first published report of a proven histological diagnosis of <b>hepatic</b> <b>Schistosomiasis</b> japonicum and <b>chronic</b> hepatitis B co-infection. A single case of hepatitis B and <b>hepatic</b> <b>Schistosomiasis</b> mansoni diagnosed by liver biopsy has previously been reported in the literature. Case presentation A 38 -year-old Chinese man with known chronic hepatitis B virus infection presented with malaise, nausea and headache. Blood tests revealed increased transaminases and serology in keeping with hepatitis B virus e-antigen seroconversion. A liver biopsy was performed because some investigations, particularly transient elastography, suggested cirrhosis. Two schistosome ova were seen on liver histology, identified as S. japonicum, probably acquired in China as a youth. His peripheral eosinophil count was normal, schistosomal serology and stool microscopy for ova, cysts and parasites were negative. Conclusion <b>Hepatic</b> <b>schistosomiasis</b> co-infection should be considered in patients with hepatitis B virus infection who are from countries endemic for schistosomiasis. Screening for schistosomiasis using a peripheral eosinophil count, schistosomal serology and stool microscopy may be negative despite infection, therefore presumptive treatment could be considered. Transient elastography should not be used to assess liver fibrosis during acute flares of viral hepatitis because readings are falsely elevated.

40|$|For <b>hepatic</b> <b>schistosomiasis</b> the egg-induced granulomatous {{response}} {{and the development}} of extensive fibrosis are the main pathologies. We used a Schistosoma japonicum-infected mouse model to characterise the multi-cellular pathways associated with the recovery from hepatic fibrosis following clearance of the infection with the anti-schistosomal drug, praziquantel. In the recovering liver splenomegaly, granuloma density and liver fibrosis were all reduced. Inflammatory cell infiltration into the liver was evident, and the numbers of neutrophils, eosinophils and macrophages were significantly decreased. Transcriptomic analysis revealed the up-regulation of fatty acid metabolism genes and the identification of Peroxisome proliferator activated receptor alpha as the upstream regulator of liver recovery. The aryl hydrocarbon receptor signalling pathway which regulates xenobiotic metabolism was also differentially up-regulated.

40|$|AbstractSchistosomiasis is {{a chronic}} disease {{caused by the}} {{parasite}} of the Schistosoma genus and is characterized by egg-induced hepatic granulomas and fibrosis. Macrophages {{play a central role}} in schistosomiasis with several studies highlighting their differentiation into M 2 cells involved in the survival of infected mice through limitation of immunopathology. However, little is known regarding the mechanisms of regulating macrophage differentiation. Here, we showed that the early stage of infection by Schistosoma japonicum induced expression of type 1 T-helper-cell (Th 1) cytokine, interferon-γ (IFN-γ), leading to increase in M 1 cells. However, the presence of liver-trapped eggs induced the expression of Th 2 cytokines including interleukin- 4 (IL- 4), IL- 10, and IL- 13 that upregulated the transcription of miR- 146 b by activating signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 / 6 (STAT 3 / 6) that bind to the promoter of the pre-miR- 146 b gene. We found that the miR- 146 a/b was significantly upregulated in macrophages during the progression of <b>hepatic</b> <b>schistosomiasis.</b> The elevated miR- 146 a/b inhibited the IFN-γ-induced differentiation of macrophages to M 1 cells through targeting STAT 1.

Results showed a significant decrease (p < 0. 001) of the proportion of Coproporphyrin I in acute hepatic porphyria (acute intermittent porphyria, hereditary coproporphyria, variegate porphyria, porphobilinogen synthase deficiency porphyria) as compared with <b>chronic</b> <b>hepatic</b> porphyria (porphyria cutanea tarda, <b>chronic</b> <b>hepatic</b> porphyria type B and C) (13. 2 ± 5. 3 %, χ ± S.

40|$|Schistosomiasis japonica is {{a serious}} {{tropical}} parasitic disease in humans, which causes inflammation and fibrosis of the liver. Hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) are known {{to play an important}} role in schistosome-induced fibrosis, but their role in schistosome-induced inflammation is still largely unknown. Here, we use a murine model of schistosomiasis japonica to investigate the role that nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB), a critical mediator of inflammatory responses, plays in schistosome-induced inflammation. We revealed that NF-κB was significantly activated in HSCs at the early stage of infection, but not at later stages. We also show that the expression levels of several chemokines regulated by NF-κB signaling (Ccl 2, Ccl 3 and Ccl 5) were similarly elevated at early infection. TLR 4 signaling, one of the strongest known inducers of NF-κB activation, seemed not activated in HSCs post-infection. Importantly, we found that levels of miR- 146 (a known negative regulator of NF-κB signaling) in HSCs opposed those of NF-κB signaling, elevating at later stage of infection. These results indicate that HSCs might play an important role in the progression of <b>hepatic</b> <b>schistosomiasis</b> japonica by linking liver inflammation to fibrosis via NF-κB signaling. Moreover, our work suggests that miR- 146 appeared to regulate this process. These findings are significant and imply that manipulating the function of HSCs by targeting either NF-κB signaling or miR- 146 expression may provide a novel method of treating <b>hepatic</b> <b>schistosomiasis</b> japonica...|$|R

A hepatocyte-specific PP 2 Acα ablation mice model was established to {{examine the effect of}} PP 2 Acα on carbon tetrachloride- (CCl 4 -) induced <b>chronic</b> <b>hepatic</b> injury and fibrosis.

Using thick naive mouse liver tissue and sterile culture conditions, the addition of soluble egg antigen (SEA) derived from Schistosoma japonicum eggs, followed 4, 24 and 48 hrs time points. Tissue was collected for transcriptional analysis and supernatants collected to quantitate liver enzymes, cytokines and chemokines. No significant hepatotoxicity was demonstrated by supernatant liver enzymes due to the presence of SEA. A proinflammatory response was observed both at the transcriptional level and at the protein level by cytokine and chemokine bead assay. Key genes observed elevated transcription in response to the addition of SEA included: IL 1 -α and IL 1 -β, IL 6, all associated with inflammation. The recruitment of antigen presenting cells was reflected in increases in transcription of CD 40, CCL 4 and CSF 1. Indications of tissue remodeling were seen in elevated gene expression of various Matrix MetalloProteinases (MMP 3, 9, 10, 13) and delayed increases in TIMP 1. Collagen deposition was significantly reduced in the presence of SEA as shown in COL 1 A 1 expression by qPCR after 24 hrs culture.

Each patient's encephalopathy was defined according to clinical, psychometric, electroencephalographic, and magnetic resonance spectroscopy criteria. Using positron emission tomography, the brain volume of distribution of 11 C-flumazenil was obtained; this reflects benzodiazepine receptor availability. Proton magnetic resonance spectra were acquired at 1. 5  T using a multivoxel technique; peak area ratios were calculated for choline, glutamine/glutamate, N-acetylaspartate, and creatine resonances.  RESULTS—The mean volume of distribution of 11 C-flumazenil was significantly higher in the cortex, cerebellum, and the basal ganglia in the patients compared with controls (p< 0. 001). In the patient group, the mean glutamine/glutamate to creatine ratio was significantly increased and the mean choline to creatine ratio was significantly decreased in all brain areas, compared with healthy volunteers. However, the N-acetylaspartate to creatine ratio was unchanged compared with controls.  CONCLUSIONS—The spectroscopy results reflect the cerebral metabolic derangement associated with hepatic encephalopathy.
