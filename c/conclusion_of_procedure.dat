This method, however, can still provide a false negative result in cases of urological injury secondary to thermal damage or where there is partial obstruction [17, 18]. The fistula {{in this case was}} thought to have formed post-operatively from a diathermy injury to the ureter whilst obtaining haemostasis at the vaginal vault. The patient underwent further surgery for reimplantation of the right ureter, and subsequently, made a full recovery.

Case: The patient was a 31 -year-old white female who presented with recurrent pregnancy loss on two occasions. The couple had a normal work-up for recurrent miscarriages {{except for a}} fundal type II submucosal fibroid on transvaginal 3 D ultrasound (US) with saline infusion hysterosonogram (SIH). Laparoscopic myomectomy and repair of the myometrial defect was performed. At the <b>conclusion</b> <b>of</b> the <b>procedure,</b> a diagnostic hysteroscopy suggested a possible concurrent incomplete short uterine septum, {{which could not be}} corrected for fear of cutting the myomectomy sutures. The patient did not appear for follow up, which led her to have three more miscarriages and one chemical pregnancy. The presence of a short uterine septum was confirmed on SIH with 3 D US. The patient underwent hysteroscopic division of the short uterine septum. Results: Postoperative SIH showed a normal uterine cavity, and currently the patient is trying to conceive. Conclusion: Coexistence of a type II submucous fibroid in the fundal region of the uterus and an incomplete uterine septum presents both a diagnostic and management challenge.

40|$|Conference Theme: Technology Transforming Head and Neck Cancer CareBackground: Nasoseptal flap is a pedicle mucosal flap {{based on}} the nasoseptal branch of the sphenopalatine artery. The flap is {{frequently}} used in reconstruction of the skull anterior skull base after endoscopic skull base surgery. Certain patients may be previously treated with high dose radiation with the pedicle of the flap in the high dose zone of radiation. The blood supply to the nasoseptal flap may then be jeopardized by the prior radiation. The current study investigates {{the viability of the}} nasoseptal flap harvested from a previously irradiated area. Materials and Methods: 25 patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) treated with radiation had nasoseptal flap harvested to cover the raw area of nasopharynx and clivus after surgery. 8 patients had open maxillary swing nasopharyngectomy for locally recurrent NPC and contralateral nasoseptal flaps were harvested to cover the raw area of the clivus. 4 NPC patients previously treated with radiation suffered from osteoradionecrosis of the nasopharynx who underwent endoscopic debridement and nasoseptal flap were harvested endoscopically to cover the raw area. 13 patients underwent robotic nasopharyngectomy and nasoseptal flaps were harvested endoscopically at the <b>conclusion</b> <b>of</b> the <b>procedure.</b> All patients had endoscopic debridement and assessment of the viability of the nasoseptal flap 4 weeks after the operation. The original images of the flap at the <b>conclusion</b> <b>of</b> the <b>procedure</b> were used as reference. The viability of the flap is classified into 4 grades. Grade 1, 0 - 25 % of the flap viable; grade 2, 25 - 50 % of the flap viable; grade 3, 50 - 75 % of the flap viable; grade 4, 75 - 100 % of the flap viable. Results: All flaps were successfully harvested and inset to cover the raw area in the nasopharynx. 16 (64 %) flaps had minimal loss of tissue (grade 4) and 5 (20 %) patients and moderate amount of flap necrosis (grade 3) with the distal part of the flap not being viable. 4 (16 %) patients had complete loss of flap (grade 1). Defining flap failure as any tissue loss > 25 % (grade 1 - 3), patients received more than one course of radiation did not have increased risk of flap failure (p= 0. 21, Fisher's exact test) and patients with radiation more than 5 years before the time of harvesting the flap (p= 1. 00, Fisher's exact test) Conclusion: For patients with prior radiation to the central skull base and nasopharynx area, the nasoseptal flap may not be totally reliable and partial or total flap loss can occur. Alternative reconstruction techniques should be considered in the primary reconstruction or salvage in case of failure of the nasoseptal flap...|$|R

The nerve block was performed by anesthetizing the right and left dorsal penile nerves, the deepest divisions of the pudendal nerve (Gauntlett 2003). The syringe was aspirated to ensure that no vascular structure was entered. A total of 20  mL was injected subcutaneously in the sub-pubic space at the base of the penis, cephalad to the dorsal penile vessels, as well as circumferentially at the time of skin closure.

40|$|Aim: To {{determine}} whether applying forced air warming attenuates {{the impact of}} sedation-induced impairment of thermoregulation on body temperature of patients who are sedated during interventional procedures in the cardiac catheterization laboratory. Background: A moderate proportion of sedated patients who undergo procedures in the cardiac catheterization laboratory with only passive warming become hypothermic. Hypothermia in the surgical population is associated with increased risk of adverse cardiac events, infections, thrombotic and haemorrhagic complications and prolonged hospital stay. For this reason, investigation of the clinical benefits of preventing hypothermia in sedated patients using active warming is required. Design: Randomized controlled trial. Methods: A total of 140 participants undergoing elective interventional procedures with sedation in a cardiac catheterization laboratory will be recruited from two hospitals in Australia. Participants will be randomized to receive forced air warming (active warming) or usual care (passive warming with heated cotton blankets) throughout procedures. The primary outcome is hypothermia (defined as temperature less than 36 °C) at the <b>conclusion</b> <b>of</b> the <b>procedure.</b> Secondary outcomes are postprocedure temperature, postprocedural shivering, thermal discomfort, major complications, disability-free survival to 30 days postprocedure, cost-effectiveness and feasibility of conducting a larger clinical trial. Discussion: The {{results from this study}} will provide high-level evidence for practice in an area where there is currently no guidance. Findings will be easily translatable into clinical practice because most hospitals already have forced air warming equipment available for use during general anaesthesia...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} an investigation <b>of</b> problem-solving <b>procedures</b> to troubleshoot electrostatic accelerators. A novel technique to diagnose issues with high-voltage components is described. The main {{application of this}} technique is noninvasive testing of electrostatic accelerator high-voltage grading systems, measuring insulation resistance, or determining the volume and surface resistivity of insulation materials used in column posts and acceleration tubes. In addition, this technique allows verification of {{the continuity of the}} resistive divider assembly as a complete circuit, revealing if an electrical path exists between equipotential rings, resistors, tube electrodes, and column post-to-tube conductors. It is capable of identifying and locating a “microbreak” in a resistor and the experimental validation of the transfer function of the high impedance energy control element. A simple and practical fault-finding procedure has been developed based on fundamental principles. The experimental distributions of relative resistance deviations (ΔR/R) for both accelerating tubes and posts were collected during five scheduled accelerator maintenance tank openings during 2013 and 2014. Components with measured ΔR/R>± 2. 5 % were considered faulty and put through a detailed examination, with faults categorized. In total, thirty four unique fault categories were identified and most would not be identifiable without the new technique described. The most common failure mode was permanent and irreversible insulator current leakage that developed after being exposed to the ambient environment. As a result of efficient in situ troubleshooting and fault-elimination techniques, the maximum values of |ΔR/R| are kept below 2. 5 % at the <b>conclusion</b> <b>of</b> maintenance <b>procedures.</b> The acceptance margin could be narrowed even further by a factor of 2. 5 by increasing the test voltage from 40  V up to 100  V. Based on experience over the last two years, resistor and insulator failures are less common now due to the routine use of the noninvasive ultrahigh impedance technique...|$|R

Methods: This post-hoc, single-masked study was conducted with 310 patients who were scheduled to undergo unilateral clear corneal cataract surgery with phacoemulsification and intraocular lens implantation. Incisions were closed with stromal hydration (270 patients) or without stromal hydration (40 patients) based on physician standard of care. All patients received the hydrogel bandage at the <b>conclusion</b> <b>of</b> the <b>procedure.</b> Ocular assessments <b>of</b> stromal edema, flare, corneal staining, anterior chamber cells, best-corrected visual acuity, and intraocular pressure were made 24 hours after surgery. Results: Significantly more patients experienced stromal edema in the group with stromal hydration (26. 3 % versus 10. 0 %, respectively; P = 0. 028). A higher percentage of patients experienced corneal staining when stromal hydration was performed (20. 4 % versus 2. 5 %; P = 0. 004). The mean BCVA (best-corrected visual acuity) also was significantly different between the groups (logMAR of 0. 164 with stromal hydration versus 0. 095 without hydration; P = 0. 007). No significant differences were observed between the study groups in terms of flare, anterior chamber cells, or intraocular pressure.

40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} the {{mechanisms by which}} groups of agents can track the truth, particularly in political situations. I argue that the mechanisms which allow groups of agents to track the truth operate in two stages: firstly, there are search procedures; and secondly, there are aggregation procedures. Search procedures and aggregation procedures work in concert. The search procedures allow agents to extract information from the environment. At the <b>conclusion</b> <b>of</b> a search <b>procedure</b> the information will be dispersed among different agents in the group. Aggregation procedures, such as majority rule, expert dictatorship and negative reliability unanimity rule, then pool these pieces of information into a social choice. The institutional features <b>of</b> both search <b>procedures</b> and aggregation procedures account for the ability of groups to track the truth and amount to social epistemic mechanisms. Large numbers of agents are crucial for the epistemic capacities <b>of</b> both search <b>procedures</b> and aggregation procedures. This thesis makes two main contributions to the literature on social epistemology and epistemic democracy. Firstly, most current accounts focus on the Condorcet Jury Theorem and its extensions as the relevant epistemic mechanism that can operate in groups of political agents. The introduction <b>of</b> search <b>procedures</b> to epistemic democracy is (mostly) new. Secondly, the thesis introduces a two-stage framework {{to the process of}} group truth-tracking. In 4 addition to showing how the two <b>procedures</b> <b>of</b> search and aggregation can operate in concert, the framework highlights the complexity of social choice situations. Careful consideration of different types of social choice situation shows that different aggregation procedures will be optimal truth-trackers in different situations.

Thesematerials {{can be classified}} as 3 -step (when primer and bond are applied separately) or 2 -step (when the primer and bond functions are carried out by a single component). Objective: To {{determine the influence of}} immediate or delayed insertion of restorative material on the values of bond strength of 2 -step and 3 -step etch-and-rinse adhesive systems using the microtensile test. Material and methods: Bovine incisors were used, which had its vestibular surface abraded to obtain a flat dentin surface. 3 -step (Scotchbond Multi-Purpose – SMP; Optibond FL – OFL; Bond-It – BIT) and 2 -step (Single-Bond – SB; Optibond Solo Plus – OSP; Bond- 1 – B 1) etch-and-rinse adhesive systems were used, and composite resin (Z- 350) was adhered to this substrate at two different times: immediately and later (after 24 hours). Procedures were performed with simulated physiological pulpal pressure. Results were submitted to statistical analysis through Anova and Tukey’s test (p < 0. 05). Results: When the composite resin was immediately inserted all the adhesive systems showed similar results. 3 -step adhesive systems did not show reduction in bond strength values related to delayed insertion of composite. On the other hand, 2 -step adhesive systems showed significant reduction in the values of bond strength. Reduction was around 30. 24 % to SB, 27. 19 % to OSP and 28. 21 % to B 1.

MethodsBetween December 2004 and August 2006, 262 endovascular aortic aneurysm repairs were performed. Percutaneous access {{was used for the}} introduction of 12 F to 24 F sheaths (4. 4 -mm to 8. 6 -mm outer diameter). The technique involved deployment of two Proglide devices before insertion of the sheath (“Preclose” technique) with the sutures left extracorporeally for closure after <b>conclusion</b> <b>of</b> the <b>procedure.</b> A prospectively maintained endovascular database and medical records were retrospectively reviewed. Rates of technical success, failure modes, and the overall duration of the endovascular repair compared with a similar cohort using open femoral exposures were examined. ResultsA total of 559 Proglide devices were used to close 279 femoral arteries, and 175 (63 %) required the insertion of 18 F to 24 F sheaths. There were 16 failures, mainly due to obesity, device malfunction, severe calcific disease, and faulty arterial punctures, for a technical success rate of 94. 3 %. The success rates for 12 F to 16 F size sheaths were significantly higher than for the larger 18 F to 24 F sheaths (99. 0 % vs 91. 4 %, P <. 01). For both endovascular abdominal (EVAR) and thoracic (TEVAR) aortic repairs, the Preclose technique resulted in shorter overall procedure times compared with a similar cohort in which open femoral exposures were used (EVAR, 115 vs 128 min, P <. 001; TEVAR, 80 vs 112, P =. 019). Despite this reduction <b>of</b> <b>procedure</b> time, the savings on the cost of operating room time was negated by the cost of the Proglide devices ($ 295 per device). ConclusionsPercutaneous access for endovascular aortic repair is safe and feasible using the Proglide device. Although the success rates are higher for smaller size sheaths, successful closures may be obtained for up to 24 F sheaths. Percutaneous access may result in shorter overall procedure times and potentially lower operating room costs, but this appears to be offset by the cost of the closure devices...|$|R

An important issue is legal nature and relevance <b>of</b> <b>procedure</b> rules according to positive law. The <b>conclusion</b> <b>of</b> {{this part of}} the diploma work is the negative and positive definition of the legal nature <b>of</b> <b>procedure</b> rules. The core of the assessment of the appropriatiness and legality <b>of</b> the specific <b>procedure</b> rules is the analysis of contemporary case law addressing the legal action against unlawful interference with the rights the question of right of a citizen of the county, eventually municipality to comment on individual agenda items discussed by the council. The specific <b>procedure</b> rules <b>of</b> various councils were analysed from the point of possible discrepancies with the law, redundant provisions copying the law or details concerning the implementation of the citizen rights to express their attitudes towards the issues discussed by the council. The <b>conclusion</b> <b>of</b> my work are suggestions de lege ferenda, which can be briefly summarized into three scopes. The first of all is an explicit statutory regulation of the obligation to publish the procedure rules in a manner allowing remote access. The second suggestion de lege ferenda is recommendation to add details on council [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Currently, {{under the}} Federal Rules <b>of</b> Civil <b>Procedure,</b> courts are not {{required}} to include findings <b>of</b> fact and <b>conclusions</b> <b>of</b> law in orders granting or denying class certification. Because of the complex nature of the law and facts involved in class suits, this note will also suggest a requirement, possibly through amendment of the Federal Rules <b>of</b> Civil <b>Procedure,</b> that such orders make explicit, through written findings and conclusions, the factors taken into account in the court 2 ̆ 7 s decision. Such a requirement would aid the courts in properly applying Rule 23 to Title VII. Moreover, written findings <b>of</b> fact and <b>conclusions</b> <b>of</b> law would also provide the parties, especially the losing party, with an articulated basis for the court 2 ̆ 7 s decision...|$|R
