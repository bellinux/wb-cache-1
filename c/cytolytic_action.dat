50|$|Although {{there have}} been {{hundreds}} of studies on exercise and the immune system, there is little direct evidence on its connection to illness. Epidemiological evidence suggests that moderate exercise has a beneficial effect on the human immune system; an effect which is modeled in a J curve. Moderate exercise {{has been associated with}} a 29% decreased incidence of upper respiratory tract infections (URTI), but studies of marathon runners found that their prolonged high-intensity exercise was associated with an increased risk of infection occurrence. However, another study did not find the effect. Immune cell functions are impaired following acute sessions of prolonged, high-intensity exercise, and some studies have found that athletes are at a higher risk for infections. Studies have shown that strenuous stress for long durations, such as training for a marathon, can suppress the immune system by decreasing the concentration of lymphocytes. The immune systems of athletes and nonathletes are generally similar. Athletes may have slightly elevated natural killer cell count and <b>cytolytic</b> <b>action,</b> but these are unlikely to be clinically significant.|$|E

It has been shown in some human cells that the gene encoding manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD), a TNF-induced gene, can provide resistance to TNF killing. Variation in the sensitivity to TNF was observed during subcloning of mouse SV 40 -transformed cell lines. This variation fell into three phenotypic classes. Cells were found that were either always resistant to TNF, always sensitive to TNF, and sensitive to TNF if inhibitors of transcription or translation were present. To determine if the regulation of MnSOD was responsible for the TNF sensitivity, Northern blot analysis was carried out. These experiments showed no correlation between expression and/or induction of the MnSOD mRNA and sensitivity or resistance to TNF. These data suggest that other pathways and gene products must therefore play a role for cells to resist TNF-mediated cellular lysis...|$|R

We present evidence that another level of complexity may also contribute to lack of responses by the lymphocytes toward gliomas. Atomic force microscopy of four different glioma types-human U 251 and rat T 9 and F 98 glioma cells, including freshly isolated human glioblastoma multiforme neurosphere cultures (containing "stem cell-like cells") -revealed a complex surface topography with numerous microvilli and filopodia. These structures were not found on other cell types. Electron microscopy and immunofluorescence microscopy of glioma cells confirmed that microvilli are present. U 251 cells with microvilli resisted the <b>cytolytic</b> <b>actions</b> of different human effector cells, (lymphokine-activated killer cells, γδ T cells, conventional CTLs, and chimeric Ag-receptor-redirected T cells) better than their nonmicrovilli-expressing counterparts. Killer lymphocytes released perforin, which was detected within the glioma's microvilli/filopodia, indicating these structures can receive the cytolytic effector molecules, bu t cytotoxicity is suboptimal. Air-dried gliomas revealed nodes within the microvilli/filopodia. The microvilli that penetrated 0. 4 -μm transwell chamber's pores resisted the actions of CTLs and physical damage. Those nodelike structures may represent a compartmentalization that resists physical damage. These microvilli may play multiple roles in glioma biology, such as invasion and resistance to lymphocyte-mediated killing. Copyright © 2010 by The American Association of Immunologists, Inc...|$|R

40|$|Unique {{features}} of the primary site of rickettsial replication in typhus fevers, i. e., within the endothelial cells of small blood vessels in tissues, suggest that effector mechanisms, other than those dependent on phagocytosis by activated macrophages with enhanced microbicidal properties, most likely are necessary to explain the cell- mediated immune control of intracellular rickettsial replication in these sites. Theoretically, such mechanisms might involve contact between infected endothelial cells and activated T lymphocyte subpopulations or macrophages or immunologically induced soluble factors or lymphokines. Support {{for the existence of}} {{at least one of these}} alternative effector mechanisms is presented here for Rickettsia prowazekii. Cultures of human blood leukocytes, upon immunologically specific stimulation with R. prowazekii antigen or nonspecific stimulation with the mitogen phytohemagglutinin, produce soluble factor(s) in the supernatant fluid which, in culture, have (a) an intracellular antirickettsial action on R. prowazekii-infected human endothelial cells, fibroblasts, and macrophages, and (b) a specific <b>cytolytic</b> <b>action</b> on R. prowazekii-infected, but not uninfected bystander, human fibroblasts.

40|$|International audienceTumorigenesis implies {{adaptation}} of tumor cells to an adverse environment. First, developing tumors must acquire nutrients {{to ensure their}} rapid growth. Second, they must escape the attack from the host immune system. Recent studies suggest that these phenomena could be related and that tumor cell metabolism may propel tumor immune escape. Tumor cell metabolism tends to avoid mitochondrial activity and oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), and largely relies on glycolysis to produce energy. This specific metabolism helps tumor cells to avoid the immune attack from the host by blocking or avoiding the immune attack. By changing their metabolism, tumor cells produce or sequester a variety of amino acids, lipids and chemical compounds that directly alter immune function therefore promoting immune evasion. A second group of metabolism-related modification targets the major histocompatibility complex-I (MHC-I) and related molecules. Tumor MHC-I presents tumor-associated antigens (TAAs) to cytotoxic T-cells (CTLs) and hence, sensitizes cancer cells to the <b>cytolytic</b> <b>actions</b> of the anti-tumor adaptive immune response. Blocking tumor mitochondrial activity decreases expression of MHC-I molecules at the tumor cell surface. And peroxynitrite (PNT), produced by tumor-infiltrating myeloid cells, chemically modifies MHC-I avoiding TAA expression in the plasma membrane. These evidences {{on the role of}} tumor cell metabolism on tumor immune escape open the possibility of combining drugs designed to control tumor cell metabolism with new procedures of anti-tumor immunotherapy.

Mouse and human cytomegalovirus, and simian virus 40 showed only low levels of infection or GFP expression. VSV and Sindbis virus showed strong <b>cytolytic</b> <b>actions</b> and high rates of replication and spread, leading to an elimination of glioblastoma. PRV and both MVM strains generated more modest lytic effects and replication capacity. VSV showed a similar oncolytic profile on U- 87 MG and M 059 J glioblastoma. In contrast, Sindbis virus showed strong preference for U- 87 MG, whereas MVMi and MVMp preferred M 059 J. Sindbis virus and both MVM strains showed highly tumor-selective actions in glioblastoma plus fibroblast coculture. VSV and Sindbis virus were serially passaged on glioblastoma cells; we isolated a variant, VSV-rp 30, that had increased selectivity and lytic capacity in glioblastoma cells. VSV and Sindbis virus were very effective at replicating, spreading within, and selectively killing human glioblastoma in an in vivo mouse model, whereas PRV and AAV remained at the injection site with minimal spread.

Both the heparin-binding and antigenic characteristics of p 115 - 129 were essentially conserved in p 115 -W 3, suggesting that the modification did not lead to radical structural alterations.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Multidrug {{resistance}} 3 (MDR 3) P-glycoprotein is a lipid floppase that is encoded by the ATP-binding cassette sub-family B member 4 (ABCB 4) {{gene and}} plays {{a crucial role}} in proper bile formation by transporting phosphatidylcholine across the canalicular plasma membrane of the hepatocyte into bile. The relevance of this function is underscored by the severe pathology that develops in patients with ABCB 4 deficiency. This deficiency leads to the destruction of hepatocytes and cholangiocytes by bile salts, because their <b>cytolytic</b> <b>action</b> is not reduced by formation of mixed micelles with phospholipid. AREAS COVERED: Evidence that phospholipid secretion into bile is also essential for biliary cholesterol secretion as cholesterol dissolves much better in mixed micelles of bile salts and phospholipid than in pure bile salt micelles. As a consequence, net biliary cholesterol secretion depends on the amount of phospholipid secreted and hence, the expression of ABCB 4 indirectly determines biliary cholesterol output. EXPERT OPINION: It can be argued that upregulation of the ABCB 4 gene expression may not only be beneficial for liver pathology in patients with partial ABCB 4 deficiency, but also for the prevention of gallstone formation and optimal cholesterol disposition in a much larger populatio...|$|E

40|$|Mechanisms {{underlying}} the enhanced virulence phenotype of community-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (CA-MRSA) are incompletely defined, but presumably include evasion of killing by human polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs or neutrophils).

Survival of USA 300 clinical isolates after phagocytosis ultimately resulted in neutrophil lysis. PMNs containing ingested USA 300 underwent morphological changes consistent with apoptosis, but lysed rapidly thereafter (within 6 h), whereas cells undergoing FAS-mediated apoptosis or phagocytosis-induced cell death remained intact. Phagosome membranes remained intact until the point of PMN destruction, suggesting lysis was not caused by escape of S. aureus from phagosomes or the <b>cytolytic</b> <b>action</b> of pore-forming toxins. Microarray analysis of the PMN transcriptome after phagocytosis of representative community-associated S. aureus and healthcare-associated MRSA strains revealed changes unique to community-associated S. aureus strains, such as upregulation of transcripts involved in regulation of calcium homeostasis.

40|$|Whether T-cell antigen receptors (TCR) on donor T cells require direct {{interactions}} with {{major histocompatibility complex}} class I or class II (MHCI/MHCII) molecules on target cells to mediate graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) is a fundamental question in allogeneic stem-cell transplantation (alloSCT). In MHC-mismatched mouse models, these contacts were not required for GVHD. However, this conclusion may not apply to MHC-matched, multiple minor histocompatibility antigen-mismatched alloSCT, {{the most common type}} performed clinically. To address this, we used wild-type (wt) →MHCI−/− or wt→MHCII−/− bone marrow chimeras as recipients in GVHD experiments. For GVL experiments, we used MHCI−/− or MHCII−/− chronic-phase CML cells created by expressing the BCR-ABL cDNA in bone marrow from MHCI−/− or MHCII−/− mice. TCR/MHCI contact was obligatory for both CD 8 -mediated GVHD and GVL. In contrast, CD 4 cells induced GVHD in wt→MHCII−/− chimeras, whereas MHCII−/− mCP-CML was GVL-resistant. Donor CD 4 cells infiltrated affected skin and bowel in wt→MHCII−/− recipients, indicating that they mediated GVHD by acting locally. Thus, CD 4 cells use distinct effector mechanisms in GVHD and GVL: direct <b>cytolytic</b> <b>action</b> is required for GVL but not for GVHD. If these noncytolytic pathways can be inhibited, then GVHD might be ameliorated while preserving GVL...|$|E
40|$|Lys 49 {{phospholipase}} A 2 (PLA 2) homologues are myotoxic proteins {{devoid of}} catalytic activity. Their toxic determinants {{map to the}} C-terminal region 115 – 129, which plays an effector role in membrane damage. The dimeric state {{was reported to be}} essential for a Lys 49 PLA 2 which lost its liposome-disrupting activity after dissociating into monomers at pH 5. 0. This study, evaluated the effects of a pH-induced dissociation on the toxicity of four Lys 49 PLA 2 s, using biological targets instead. Both their cytolytic and myotoxic activities were lower at pH 5. 0 than at pH 7. 2. However, in contrast with experiments using artificial bilayers, toxic effects upon biological targets were not abolished at pH 5. 0. Importantly, C-terminal synthetic peptides of two Lys 49 PLA 2 s also showed lower <b>cytolytic</b> <b>action</b> at pH 5. 0 than at pH 7. 2, indicating that factors other than the dimeric/monomeric state of the proteins may also be involved in these differences of toxicity. Results support the view that the dimeric state of Lys 49 PLA 2 s could play an enhancing, although not essential role, in their C-terminal region-mediated mechanism of myotoxicity.

40|$|Antisera {{produced}} in rats by immunization with alloimmune murine C 57 Bl/ 6 anti-P 815 splenic lymphocytes or purified T cells activated in vitro by coculture with phytohemagglutinincoated L- 929 cells {{were found to}} inhibit the in vitro <b>cytolytic</b> <b>action</b> of in vivo and in vitro alloimmune C 57 Bl/ 6 anti-P 815 cytotoxic T cells in a 4 -hr chromium- 51 release assay. The rat anti-murine-activated lymphocyte (anti-MAL) or antiactivated T-cell (anti-ATC) serum inhibited lysis {{in the absence of}} exogenously added complement activity and were not directly cytotoxic to CTL. Absorption of anti-MAL with target cells P 815, L- 929, EL- 4, and normal C 57 Bl/ 6 lymphocytes removed a limited amount of the CTL-inhibitory activity. In contrast, lectin-activated alloimmune lymphocytes fully absorbed the inhibitory activity indicating these antisera preferentially recognize unique antigenic determinants associated with the activated CTL cell surface. The anti-ATC was found to block alloimmune lysis by CTL from several inbred mouse strains suggesting these antisera recognized antigenic determinants of a common lytic mechanism. A kinetic analysis of the inhibitory activity of the anti-MAL on the CTL reaction scheme revealed this antiserum inhibited lysis at a post-Ca 2 + -dependent step, presumably during the target cell lytic phase. This result suggests the rat antiserum can neutralize the CTL lytic mechanism. © 1981...|$|E

In the present study, we purified flammutoxin as a single haemolytic protein of 31 kDa and studied the mode of its <b>cytolytic</b> <b>action.</b> (1) Flammutoxin caused efflux of potassium ions from human erythrocytes and swelling of the cells before haemolysis. (2) Flammutoxin did not lyse human erythrocytes {{in the presence of}} non-electrolytes with hydrodynamic diameters of > 5. 0 nm, although it caused leakage of potassium ions and swelling of the cells under the same conditions. (3) Experiments including solubilization of cell-bound toxin with 2 % (w/v) SDS at 20 degrees C and subsequent Western immunoblots showed that flammutoxin formed a band corresponding to 180 kDa under the conditions where it lysed erythrocytes. (4) Electron microscopy of flammutoxin-treated human erythrocytes revealed the presence of a ring-shaped structure with outer and inner diameters of 10 and 5 nm, respectively, on the cells. (5) A ring-shaped toxin oligomer of the same dimensions was solubilized from the toxin-treated human erythrocytes with 2 % (w/v) SDS at 20 degrees C and isolated by a sucrose-gradient ultracentrifugation. These data indicated that flammutoxin assembles into a ring-shaped oligomer possessing a hydrophilic pore of 4 - 5 nm on target cells...|$|E
40|$|The jelly {{surrounding}} the eggs of the starfish, Asterias forbesi, is insoluble in normal sea water, but rapidly swells and dissolves when {{the eggs are}} washed in a pure isotonic solution of NaCl. In {{the presence of a}} small proportion of CaCl 2 this solvent and disintegrative action of the NaCl solution is entirely prevented, and in the mixed solution the jelly exhibits the same insolubility and other properties as in normal sea water. 2. This action of CaCl 2 in preventing the dissolution of the jelly runs parallel with its action in preventing certain definite effects of the pure NaCl solution on the living egg (agglutination, <b>cytolytic</b> <b>action,</b> membrane formation, prevention of maturation). 3. The inference is that the essential factor in these and similar antagonistic and protective actions is the formation of solid water-insoluble colloidal salts (e. g., soaps and proteinates) of calcium (or other metal) with the structural colloids of the protoplasm. Apparently the presence of a certain proportion of such compounds is necessary to the structural stability of the living protoplasm, and especially to the water-insolubility and semipermeability of its external layer or plasma membrane. When the cell is immersed in the pure NaCl solution, water-soluble Na compounds are substituted for the insoluble Ca compounds which normally provide the necessary insolubility and coherence, and disintegration results...|$|E

The cytotoxic action of alpha toxin for tissue cultures was evaluated by use of such parameters as total and viable cell counts, glucose and protein determination, and cytopathic effects in the presence and absence of Enovid. To 3 -day-old primary rabbit baby kidney tissue cultures a mixture of 20 μg of norethynodrel per ml [17 α-ethynyl-hydroxy- 5 (10) -estren- 3 -one] and 5 μg of mestranol per ml (17 -ethynelestradiol- 3 -methyl ether) was added; growth of tissue cultures in Eagle medium was continued till the sixth day, and then one tissue cytopathic dose of alpha toxin per ml was added and the subsequent fate of tissue cultures was assayed. Such cultures yielded higher total and viable cell counts, utilized more glucose, and contained more protein than the control cultures. In control cultures, cytopathogenicity appeared on the third day after the addition of alpha toxin, and it was complete in 24 hr, whereas in tissue cultures treated with Enovid cytopathogenicity was significantly reduced. Thus the mixture of synthetic hormones known as Enovid, in pharmacological concentrations, was found capable of reducing the cytopathic action of alpha toxin, but only to a slightly lesser degree than such natural hormone as progesterone...|$|E
40|$|WE {{investigated}} {{the effects of}} the antibiotic ceftazidime (C 2 LZ) on the <b>cytolytic</b> <b>action</b> of the neutrophil myeloperoxidase-hydrogen peroxidechloride anion system (MPO/H 202 /CI-). In this system, myeloperoxidase catalyses the conversion of H 202 and CI- to the cytotoxic agent HOCI. Stimulated neutrophils can release MPO into the extracellular environment and then may cause tissue injury through direct endothelial cells lysis. We showed that human umbilical vein endothelial cells (ItUVEC) were capable of taking up active MPO. In presence of H 202 (10 - 4 M), this uptake was accompanied by cell lysis. The cytolysis was estimated by the release of SlCr from HUVEC and expressed as an index of cytotoxicity (IC). Dose dependent protection was obtained for CAZ concentrations ranging from 10 - s to 10 - 3 M; this can be attributed to inactivation of HOCI by the drug. This protection is comparable to that obtained with methionine and histidine, both of which are known to neutralize HOCI. This protection by CAZ could also be attributed to inactivation of H 202, but when cytolysis was achieved with H 202 or 02 - generating enzymatic systems, no protection by CAZ was observed. Moreover, the peroxidation activity of MPO (action on H 202) was not affected by CAZ, while CAZ prevented the chlorination activity of MPO (chlorination of monochlorodimedon). So, we concluded that CAZ acts via HOCI inactivation. These antioxidant properties of CAZ may be clinically useful in pathological situations where excessive activation of neutrophils occurs, such as in sepsis.

40|$|Bordetella {{adenylate cyclase}} (AC) toxin-hemolysin (CyaA) targets myeloid phagocytes expressing the alphaMbeta 2 {{integrin}} (CD 11 b/CD 18) and delivers into their cytosol an AC enzyme that converts ATP into cyclic AMP (cAMP). In parallel, CyaA {{acts as a}} hemolysin, forming small membrane pores. Using specific mutations, we dissected {{the contributions of the}} two activities to cytolytic potency of CyaA on J 774 A. 1 murine monocytes. The capacity of AC to penetrate cells and deplete cytosolic ATP was essential for promoting lysis and the enzymatically inactive but fully hemolytic CyaA-AC- toxoid exhibited a 15 -fold-lower cytolytic capacity on J 774 A. 1 cells than intact CyaA. Moreover, a two- or fourfold drop of specific hemolytic activity of the CyaA-E 570 Q and CyaA-E 581 P mutants was overpowered by an intact capacity to dissipate cytosolic ATP into cAMP, allowing the less hemolytic proteins to promote lysis of J 774 A. 1 cells as efficiently as intact CyaA. However, an increased hemolytic activity, due to lysine substitutions of glutamates 509, 516, and 581 in the pore-forming domain, conferred on AC- toxoids a correspondingly enhanced cytolytic potency. Moreover, a threefold increase in hemolytic activity could override a fourfold drop in capacity to convert cellular ATP to cAMP, conferring on the CyaA-E 581 K construct an overall twofold increased cytolytic potency. Hence, although appearing auxiliary in <b>cytolytic</b> <b>action</b> of the toxin on nucleated cells, the pore-forming activity can synergize with ATP-depleting activity of the cell-invasive AC enzyme and complement its action toward maximal cytotoxicity...|$|E
