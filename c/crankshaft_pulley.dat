50|$|Speed {{reduction}} is via a standard twin cog-belt system, with harmonic dampening on the <b>crankshaft</b> <b>pulley.</b> The initial TBO was {{estimated by the}} manufacturer as 1500 hours.|$|E
50|$|Changing the {{original}} <b>crankshaft</b> <b>pulley</b> {{can also have}} negative effects if the replacement pulley is not manufactured properly. A crankshaft or accessory pulley not machined or balanced properly can cause severe damage leading to {{thousands of dollars in}} repairs.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Life Cycle Assessment or LCA {{method is}} {{believed}} to be a good solution to improve sustainability in a manufacturing process. This method allows designers to identify opportunities to improve the environmental aspects of products at various points in their life cycle. In this paper, the implementation of LCA through the development of an Environmental Impact Assessment Tool (EIAT) is demonstrated via a case study of Volkswagen <b>pulley</b> <b>crankshaft.</b> EIAT is a tool that aids designers to improve the environmental impact in a manufacturing process by designing or producing products with minimal environmental impact and minimal use of resources, such as the material and energy. EIAT also offers the optimization of design solutions to reduce potential environmental impact of a specific product according to its design features. A <b>pulley</b> <b>crankshaft</b> was modelled in a CAD system where the form is fixed to maintain its function. <b>Pulley</b> <b>crankshaft</b> features, such as the type of material, diameter of pocket, stock thickness and diameter are the parameters that were optimized through the Genetic Algorithm encoded in EIAT. EIAT was validated with Eco-It (an established LCA tool) and with actual experiments. Results show a difference of less than 9 % error between EIAT with the results produced by Eco-It and the actual experiments...|$|R
50|$|The {{engine was}} {{typically}} belted to the device being {{powered by a}} wide flat belt, typically from 2 - 6 inches (5 - 15 cm) wide. The flat belt is driven by a pulley on the engine that attached either to a flywheel or to the <b>crankshaft.</b> The <b>pulley</b> is specially made in that its circumference is slightly tapered from the middle to each edge (like an over-inflated car tyre) so that {{the middle of the}} pulley is a slightly larger diameter. This design keeps the flat belt in the centre of the pulley.|$|R
50|$|An {{underdrive}} pulley {{refers to}} a <b>crankshaft</b> or accessory <b>pulley</b> (a/c, alternator, power steering, water pump, etc.) designed to turn at a slower speed than stock. To Underdrive means to slow the rate of rotation in a system. Underdrive is achieved by either making the crank/main (drive) pulley smaller or the accessory (driven) pulley larger than the original diameter pulleys.|$|R
50|$|A {{timing mark}} is an {{indicator}} used for setting {{the timing of}} the ignition system of an engine, typically found on the <b>crankshaft</b> <b>pulley</b> (as pictured) or the flywheel, being the largest radius rotating at crankshaft speed and therefore the place where marks at one degree intervals will be farthest apart.|$|E
50|$|Top {{dead centre}} for {{cylinder}} one is often {{marked on the}} <b>crankshaft</b> <b>pulley,</b> the flywheel or dynamic balancer or both, with adjacent timing marks showing the recommended ignition timing settings as decided during engine development. These timing marks {{can be used to}} set the ignition timing either statically by hand or dynamically using a timing light, by rotating the distributor in its seat.|$|E
50|$|Tuned mass dampers {{are widely}} used in {{production}} cars, typically on the <b>crankshaft</b> <b>pulley</b> to control torsional vibration and, more rarely, the bending modes of the crankshaft. They are also used on the driveline for gearwhine, and elsewhere for other noises or vibrations on the exhaust, body, suspension or anywhere else. Almost all modern cars will have one mass damper, some may have 10 or more.|$|E
50|$|Engineers {{can use the}} Brinell {{hardness}} {{of materials}} in their calculations to avoid this mode of failure. A rolling element bearing's static load rating is defined to avoid this failure type. Increasing the number of elements can provide better distribution of the load, so bearings intended for a large load may have many balls, or use needles instead. This decreases the chances of brinelling, but increases friction and other factors. However, although roller and ball bearings work well for radial and thrust loading, they are often prone to brinelling when very high impact loading, lateral loading, or vibration are experienced. Babbitt bearings or bronze bushings are often used instead of roller bearings in applications where such loads exist, such as in automotive <b>crankshafts</b> or <b>pulley</b> sheaves, to decrease the possibility of brinelling by distributing the force over a very large surface area.|$|R
5000|$|Fred ('Freddie') W. Barnes {{was hired}} as chief {{engineer}} in 1905, and patented the [...] "Gradua" [...] variable-ratio belt drive transmission that year. The Gradua system simultaneously changed {{the diameter of the}} <b>crankshaft</b> belt-drive <b>pulley</b> to alter the drive ratio, while moving the rear wheel forward or back to maintain belt tension. [...] The Gradua's action was controlled by a rotating lever atop the fuel tank, and was among the first attempts to provide multiple drive ratios for a motorcycle, at a time when very simple, direct belt-drive transmission was the industry norm. Variable drive ratios proved a significant advantage in competition, leading riders of other marques to complain the Gradua gave an unfair advantage; eventually Zeniths with Gradua gears were banned from many competitions. Zenith capitalized on this ban, adding the word [...] "Barred" [...] to their advertising and logo. The Gradua system was replaced by the now-standard gearbox and chain transmission in 1924.|$|R
5000|$|Impact {{wrenches}} {{are available}} in all sizes and in several styles, depending on the application. ¼" [...] drive wrenches are commonly available in both inline (the user holds the tool like a screwdriver, with the output on the end) and pistol grip (the user holds a handle which is {{at right angles to}} the output) forms, and less commonly in an angle drive, which is similar to an inline tool but with a set of bevel gears to rotate the output 90°. ⅜" [...] impacts are most commonly available in pistol grip form and a special inline form known as a [...] "butterfly" [...] wrench, which has a large, flat throttle paddle {{on the side of the}} tool which may be tilted to one side or the other to control the direction of rotation, rather than using a separate reversing control, and shaped to allow access into tight areas. Regular inline and angle ⅜" [...] drive impact wrenches are uncommon, but available. ½" [...] drive units are virtually only available in pistol grip form, with any inline type being virtually impossible to obtain, due to the increased torque transmitted back to the user and the greater weight of the tool requiring the larger handle. ¾" [...] drive impact wrenches are again essentially only available in pistol grip form. 1" [...] drive tools {{are available in}} both pistol grip and [...] "D handle" [...] inline, where the back of the tool has an enclosed handle for the user to hold. Both forms often also incorporate a side handle, allowing both hands to hold the tool at once. 1¼" [...] and larger wrenches are usually available in [...] "T handle" [...] form, with two large handles on either side of the tool body, allowing for maximum torque to be applied to the user, and giving the best control of the tool. Very large impact wrenches (up to several hundred thousand foot-pounds of torque) usually incorporate eyelets in their design, allowing them to be suspended from a crane, lift, or other device, since their weight is often more than a person can move. A recent design combines an impact wrench and an air ratchet, often called a [...] "reactionless air ratchet" [...] by the manufacturers, incorporating an impact assembly before the ratchet assembly. Such a design allows very high output torques with minimal effort on the operator, and prevents the common injury of slamming one's knuckles into some part of the equipment when the fastener tightens down and the torque suddenly increases. Specialty designs are available for certain applications, such as removing <b>crankshaft</b> <b>pulleys</b> without removing the radiator in a vehicle.|$|R
5000|$|Accessories — The <b>crankshaft</b> <b>pulley</b> {{diameter}} {{decreased by}} 14% (as {{compared to the}} GT) in order to under-drive the alternator, A/C, and smog pump, all to increase power. The water pump pulley also decreased in diameter by the same amount {{in order to preserve}} the ratio of pump speed, and thus coolant flow. These smaller accessory pulleys necessitated a shorter serpentine belt. Part Numbers: F3ZZ-6A312-A (crank pulley), F3ZZ-8509-A (water pump pulley), and F3ZZ-8620-A (belt).|$|E
50|$|In 2005, the RSX {{received}} a refresh. On the exterior, Acura updated the headlights and taillights and the Type-S {{received a}}n updated rear hatch spoiler. The base model received a 12 spoke Enkei alloy wheel, while the Type-S now {{comes with a}} 17-inch 5-spoke Enkei/Asahi wheels wrapped in Michelin HX MXM4 215/45/R17 tires. 17-inch Enkei J10s alloy wheels (with Acura specific fitment and center caps) were optional. Under the hood, the RSX Type-S received the camshafts, b-pipe and muffler, 4.77 final drive ratio, <b>crankshaft</b> <b>pulley</b> and the intake snorkel duct from the Japanese DC5 Type R.|$|E
50|$|Mechanical {{fans are}} {{most common in}} trucks and SUVs, and some RWD cars. This is easier to {{accomplish}} because the engine is mounted longitudinally, with the belt accessory components mounted facing the radiator. The fan is mounted on the <b>crankshaft</b> <b>pulley</b> {{or one of the}} accessory pulleys (e.g. the water pump pulley) and will spin in between the radiator and the engine, drawing air back through the radiator and blowing it over the engine. Even though the air has been heated by passing through the radiator, it is still much less hot than the engine surface, so the airflow over the engine helps with cooling.|$|E
5000|$|The update program {{commenced}} in late 2002 {{with production}} launch {{slated to be}} fall of 2004. The engineering team chose the engine variant out of the GMT560 truck (the C4500) because it packaged better into the H1 engine bay; however, 23 engine component changes were required and the team {{had to do a}} 2.0 in body lift to accommodate the taller engine and its turbo housing (a prior 0.5 in lift had been done for MY96 to accommodate the turbo on the 6.5L engine). The 8th digit of the VIN number is 3, setting this version of the 6.6L Duramax apart from the versions used in pickup trucks. The GMT560 engine calibration was used with minimal modification; engine output was [...] and 520 lbft Nm of torque. The Duramax engine was equipped with cooled exhaust gas recirculation and an internal engine oil cooler, thus, requiring a 40 percent heat rejection increase to engine coolant. Because space was limited between the air-lift brackets that protrude from the hood, the fan system was modified by putting it directly under the coolpack and driving it through a special gearbox directly off the <b>crankshaft</b> damper <b>pulley.</b> Several other cooling system modifications were required to assist with cold starting from [...]|$|R
50|$|The {{timing light}} is {{connected}} to the ignition circuit and used to illuminate the timing marks on the engine's <b>crankshaft</b> <b>pulley</b> or flywheel, with the engine running. The apparent position of the marks, frozen by the stroboscopic effect, indicates the current timing of the spark in relation to piston position. A reference pointer is attached to the flywheel housing or other fixed point, and an engraved scale gives the offset between the spark time and the top dead centre position of the piston in the cylinder. The distributor can be rotated slightly until the reference pointer aligns with the specified point on the timing scale.|$|E
50|$|On November 9, 2011, Toyota {{announced}} a recall of 550,000 vehicles (447,000 in the U.S., 38,000 in Japan, and 25,000 in Australia and New Zealand) worldwide; the recall affects MY 2004-2005 Camry, Highlander, Sienna and Solara, MY 2004 Avalon, MY 2006 Highlander HV, MY 2004-2005 Lexus ES330 and RX330 and MY 2006 RX400h. The recall concerns a steering problem {{caused by the}} misalignment of {{the inner and outer}} rings of the <b>crankshaft</b> <b>pulley,</b> which could cause a noise or the Check Engine light to illuminate; if this problem is not corrected, the power steering belt can fall off the pulley, which can cause a sudden loss of power assist.|$|E
5000|$|A {{number of}} special design {{features}} help {{the engine to}} develop [...] A special fuel injection unit has ram tubes of larger cross section and 2510 longer {{than those of the}} regular production design. Individual exhaust pipes of a tuned length empty into large collector pipes and no mufflers are used. No cooling fan is required or used, and the water pump speed is reduced 30% by the use of a smaller <b>crankshaft</b> <b>pulley.</b> A small, 5-ampere generator is used in conjunction with a lightweight aircraft type battery In addition to the aluminum water pump mentioned previously, the engine cooling system consists of an aluminum radiator mounted forward of the driver, and two oil cooler radiators mounted one {{on each side of the}} main radiator.|$|E
5000|$|The {{engine was}} a modern unit, with a {{water-cooled}} inline design with forged crankshaft, alloy cross-flow head and five main bearings. An unusual feature on early models was {{the absence of}} a spin-on paper oil filter. Instead, the engine featured a form of centrifugal oil filter in the hollow rear <b>crankshaft</b> <b>pulley,</b> although all later versions used the more traditional disposable cartridge filters. One of its major innovations was the use of a swirl vortex on the intake valve port which gave very good combustion, and thus both power and economy for this time. This engine proved cheap to build, and several models of different sizes and market segments used this displacement, which survived until 1982, as the ever-present entry level for the Simca 1100.|$|E
50|$|The air {{compressor}} {{is driven by}} the engine either by <b>crankshaft</b> <b>pulley</b> via a belt or directly from the engine timing gears. It is lubricated and cooled by the engine lubrication and cooling systems. Compressed air is first routed through a cooling coil and into an air dryer which removes moisture and oil impurities and also may include a pressure regulator, safety valve and smaller purge reservoir. As an alternative to the air dryer, the supply system can be equipped with an anti-freeze device and oil separator. The compressed air is then stored in a reservoir (also called a wet tank) from which it is then distributed via a four way protection valve into the front and rear brake circuit air reservoir, a parking brake reservoir and an auxiliary air supply distribution point. The system also includes various check, pressure limiting, drain and safety valves.|$|E
50|$|The 1998 Miata uses a {{modified}} BP, the BP-4W, which replaces the old Hall Effect dual Cam Angle Sensor unit mounted {{at the back}} of the exhaust cam with two separate Hall Effect units at the front - one on the intake cam gear and one mounted on the oil pump, to the side of the <b>crankshaft</b> <b>pulley.</b> It also has an improved intake system (a better flowing cylinder head because of the angle of the intake ports being changed). There was also a switch from the earlier problematic hydraulic lifters to solid lifters. The United States 2004-2005 Mazdaspeed MX-5 turbo is based on this engine rather than the newer BP-Z3 and produces 178 hp (133 kW) and 166 lb·ft (225 N·m) with slightly reduced compression. The Mazdaspeed turbo engine has no VICS, but does have VTCS which is often mistaken to be related to VICS.|$|E
50|$|The {{rear wheels}} and side pipes were changed. For the second film, the {{original}} Weiand blower, which was removed and subsequently lost, was replaced. Unlike {{in the first}} film, this time the supercharger was functional (connected directly to the engine's <b>crankshaft</b> <b>pulley)</b> {{and the effect of}} the blower being engaged or disengaged was created by placing the vehicle on a low loader, and while in motion, the interceptor's engine was simply started or stopped. The car was cosmetically modified for the new post-apocalyptic setting {{with the addition of a}} pair of large cylindrical fuel tanks fitted in the rear (requiring the back window and boot lid to be removed) and its general appearance was given a more used look by painting the vehicle in matte rather than gloss black, and the paint was scrubbed off to appear rusty. The front end was also modified by removing the air dam. A duplicate car was also put together for the film. When the script required it to be destroyed by rolling down an embankment and eventually exploding, the duplicate interceptor was used, leaving the original vehicle intact.|$|E
5000|$|For the {{mechanical}} upgrade, work {{began with the}} engine, in accordance to the new standard now known as ZMZ-402. This produced , but needed 92 octane petrol. The other option was the ZMZ 4021, which gave [...] but only needed the more common 76 octane. The main novelty of the ZMZ-4022 was stratified charge ignition. This was immediately ruled out, due to its complication for the mass-produced car. Other changes, however, were retained. These included fingerless crankshaft bearing caps, new cast iron camshaft supports with no bushings, inlet and outlet valves of increased diameter with double-wound-springs, a new water pump, vibration dampener on the <b>crankshaft</b> <b>pulley,</b> contactless ignition system with a new alternator, new spark plugs, and an upgraded K-126GM carburettor. Some cars would feature the K-151 carburettor with a paper air filter (as opposed to the traditional oil bath filters), and an idle fuel cutoff solenoid with exhaust gas recirculation. These would often carry the aluminium cylinder block from the ZMZ-4022. Power was now [...] 0 to 100 km/h took 19 seconds, top speed was 147 km/h, and fuel economy [...] The GAZ-3102's braking system was also improved, with atandem brake cylinder that featuring a dual-chambered vacuum servo and pressure regulator on the rear brakes; the 3102's front disk brakes were left out. The 3.9:1 rear axle, clutch and 205/70R14 radial tyres with [...] "aerodynamic" [...] hub cups were also carried across. The dashboard and steering wheel were also from the 3102 parts bin.|$|E
5000|$|The first {{generation}} of the 4E-FE was {{the basis of the}} 4E-FTE in 1989, which was a turbocharged engine producing [...] at 6,400 rpm with [...] of torque at 4,800 rpm. The 4E-FTE was the most powerful of the E series engines ever produced. It was produced exclusively for the Toyota Starlet GT Turbo (Japan Only) and its successor, the Toyota Glanza V (Japan only). However the 4E-FTE was a very popular conversion engine by enthusiasts for many small Toyota cars such as the Corolla, Tercel, Paseo and Sera which it fitted into with standard Toyota parts. The 4E-FTE differed internally from the 4E-FE by its stronger connecting rods, lower compression pistons (reduced from 9.6:1 to 8.5:1) and stronger crankshaft. The cylinder head and valve train was identical to the 4E-FE. The 4E-FTE also featured a harmonic damper instead of a normal <b>crankshaft</b> <b>pulley.</b> The turbocharger fitted to the 4E-FTE was Toyota's own CT9 model, which featured an internal waste gate and had 2 modes: low (0.4 bar/40 kPa) and high (0.65 bar/65 kPa) boost. The low boost mode was electronically controlled by a solenoid valve and the ECU and the high boost was controlled by an actuator connected to the turbocharger. The 4E-FTE also had a top mounted, air cooled intercooler. The 4E-FTE was mated to the Toyota C52 transmission (for the EP82 Starlet GT) and the C56 transmission (for the EP91 Glanza V).|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe pulleys of an {{automotive}} {{front engine}} accessory drive are driven in rotation by a poly-V belt itself {{driven by the}} <b>crankshaft</b> <b>pulley.</b> This driving pulley is often used as a torsional vibration damper (TVD) for the crankshaft. Three elements compose the pulley: the hub, a rubber ring and an inertia steel ring with v-ribs on its outer diameter. Although the crankshaft torsional vibrations are dampen, they are transmitted to the belt transmission and therefore to the driven accessories. Hence, recent developments have conducted to add a decoupling function to these pulleys. The decoupling is realized by an other rubber ring. The TVD pulley components are designed in order to dampen crankshaft vibrations over a given frequency range, i. e. stiffness and damping characteristics are determined for the rubber ring. These expected characteristics have to be checked after manufacturing for product certification but also to give some real measured data input for simulation models. An experimental characterization method is presented and discussed for {{the determination of the}} stiffness and damping coefficients of the rubber rings used in such pulley. The test rig developed is temperature controlled in order to show the influence of the temperature...|$|E
