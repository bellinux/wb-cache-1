They make a magical bridge over the river wherein just as they cross, they meet the personification of Death, who is angry for losing three potential victims. He pretends to be impressed by them and grants each a wish as a reward. The oldest brother asks for an unbeatable dueling wand, so Death gives him the Elder Wand. The middle brother asks for the ability to resurrect the dead, so Death gives him the Resurrection Stone. The youngest brother does not trust Death and asks {{for a way to}} stop Death from following him, so Death reluctantly gives him his <b>Cloak</b> <b>of</b> Invisibility. Afterwards, the brothers go their separate ways.|$|E
5|$|In Britain {{the use of}} {{elaborate}} {{symbols of}} authority developed about 15,000 years ago during the Upper Paleolithic. Ivory rods, carved antlers, painted animal skulls, and other objects were buried with tribal leaders at caves in Somerset and Derbyshire. Later, around 2400BCE (BC), a group of peoples from mainland Europe known as Beaker folk conquered most of Britain. This warrior race had a tradition of investing their new leaders with polished ceremonial axes made of green quartzite, red tourmaline, and jadeite. Excavations at Bush Barrow, Wiltshire, unearthed an early example of a sceptre, decorated with bone in a zig-zag pattern, and topped by a stone. Archaeologists believe it and other treasures found in the grave may have belonged to the ruling family who built Stonehenge. By 1600 BCE, the rulers of southern Britain wore gold epaulettes, gold brooches, and gold-plated bronze daggers. A ceremonial gold <b>cloak</b> <b>of</b> the same period, the Mold cape, was found at a Bronze Age burial mound in Flintshire, Wales, in 1833.|$|E

5|$|The New South Wales waratah {{featured}} {{prominently in}} the folklore of the Darug and Tharawal people in the Sydney basin and Gandangara people to the southwest. A dreamtime legend from the Eora tells of a female wonga pigeon searching for her husband who has been lost while out hunting. A hawk attacks and wounds her, and she hides in a waratah bush. Her husband calls and as she struggles in the bush her blood turns the white waratah blooms red. A tale from the Burragorang Valley tells of a beautiful maiden named Krubi, who wore a red <b>cloak</b> <b>of</b> rock wallaby adorned with the feathers of the gang-gang cockatoo. She {{fell in love with}} a young warrior who did not return from battle. Grief-stricken, she died, and up from the ground grew the first waratah. The Dharawal people regarded it as a totem, using it in ceremonies and timing ceremonies to its flowering.|$|E
5|$|Kaecilius {{uses the}} stolen pages {{to contact the}} {{powerful}} Dormammu of the Dark Dimension, where time is non-existent. Kaecilius destroys the London Sanctum to weaken Earth's protection. The zealots then attack the New York Sanctum, killing its guardian, but Strange holds them off {{with the help of}} the <b>Cloak</b> <b>of</b> Levitation until Mordo and the Ancient One arrive. Strange and Mordo become disillusioned with the Ancient One after Kaecilius reveals that the Ancient One's long life is due to her drawing power from the Dark Dimension. Kaecilius mortally wounds the Ancient One and escapes to Hong Kong. Before dying, she tells Strange that he too will have to bend the rules to complement Mordo's steadfast nature in order to defeat Kaecilius. Strange and Mordo arrive in Hong Kong to find Wong dead, the Sanctum destroyed, and the Dark Dimension irresistibly engulfing Earth. Strange uses the Eye to reverse time and save Wong, then creates an infinite time loop inside the Dark Dimension that traps himself and Dormammu in the same moment of time. After repeatedly killing Strange to no avail, Dormammu finally gives in to Strange's demand that he leave Earth and take Kaecilius and his zealots with him in return for Strange breaking the time loop.|$|E

40|$|We {{show that}} <b>cloaking</b> <b>of</b> {{isolated}} objects {{is subject to}} a diameter-bandwidth product limitation: as {{the size of the}} object increases, the bandwidth of good (small cross-section) cloaking decreases inversely with the diameter, as a consequence of causality constraints even for perfect fabrication and materials with negligible absorption. This generalizes a previous result that perfect <b>cloaking</b> <b>of</b> isolated objects over a nonzero bandwidth violates causality. Furthermore, we demonstrate broader causality-based scaling limitations on any bandwidth-averaged cloaking cross-section, using complex analysis and the optical theorem to transform the frequency-averaged problem into a single scattering problem with transformed materials.

In particular a particle placed near a superlens would appear to disappear as the light surrounding the particle resonates as the same frequency as the superlens. The resonance would effectively cancel out the light reflecting from the particle, rendering the particle electromagnetically invisible.|$|R

25|$|During the 1960s and 1970s, {{there was}} a dramatic, {{fundamental}} shift in American society generally, which profoundly affected public political behavior. Elected officials were compelled to confront new constituents with new attitudes. In particular, for the Central Intelligence Agency, the societal change altered notions of what was considered 'politically acceptable conduct'. In the early cold war period, the Agency had been somewhat exempt from normal standards of accountability, {{so that it could}} employ its special espionage and covert capacities against what was understood as an amoral communist enemy. At times during this period, the CIA operated under a <b>cloak</b> <b>of</b> secrecy, where it met the ideological foe in a gray-and-black world. In that era, normal Congressional oversight was informally modified to block unwanted public scrutiny, which might be useful to the enemy.|$|E

25|$|From 1780 on, however, a new conjuncture of {{internal}} and external conditions and forces conspired to bring {{the economy and the}} political structure of the Republic to a crisis that they could not survive. The Fourth Anglo-Dutch War ended the <b>cloak</b> <b>of</b> neutrality which had protected Dutch shipping for most of the century, in that period obviating the need for naval protection that was now lacking due to many years of neglect of the navy. Trade came temporarily to a standstill, because the British blockade could not be broken, despite the relative success of the Dutch navy in the Battle of Dogger Bank (1781). The trade of the VOC was devastated, even apart from the loss of some of its colonies. It experienced a liquidity crisis which exposed its inherent insolvency. The company was too important to let it fail (also because of the importance of its outstanding debt in the Dutch financial system), so that it was kept afloat {{for more than a decade}} by emergency aid from the States of Holland, before it was finally nationalized in 1796.|$|E
