METHODS: Cross-sectional surveys were used to measure tobacco and alcohol use, multiple indicators of child competence, parenting behaviors, and parental modeling of tobacco and alcohol use {{in a sample of}} 1470 third- and fifth-grade children. Both self-report and teacher-rated assessments were obtained, which allowed <b>collateral</b> <b>testing</b> of study hypotheses. RESULTS: Children's tobacco and alcohol use was strongly related to low scores on several measures of child competence, both self-reported and teacher rated. Children's tobacco and alcohol use was also associated with less effective parenting behaviors and with parental use of tobacco and alcohol. CONCLUSIONS: Children's early experience with tobacco and alcohol is associated with weak competence development and exposure to socialization factors that promote risk taking.

Two were propagated serially, and {{it seems likely that}} all could have been maintained indefinitely had litters been available of newborn animals of the sort in which they arose. These successes are the more worthy of note because of the well-nigh uniform failure of similar growths on transfer to adults. The tumors enlarged with great rapidity in the sucklings, were extraordinarily destructive, and two of them metastaslzed within a few weeks. Many efforts were made to extract causative agents from the three carcinomas, on the assumption that these might be due to variants of the Shope virus. Highly favorable conditions for the demonstration of this latter were provided in the tests; yet their outcome was wholly negative although all of the cancers derived from papillomas caused by "recoverable" strains of virus, and although one of them appeared to be consequent upon only the slightest of alterations toward malignancy {{on the part of the}} papilloma from which it came. Extracts of another of the cancers, an anaplastic, squamous-cell carcinoma devoid of any morphological sign of the influence of the Shope virus, yielded typical virus papillomas on several occasions.

It {{has been suggested}} that during ACP, abdominal organs are better protected than during DHCA owing to partial perfusion via <b>collaterals.</b> We <b>tested</b> this hypothesis using intraoperative near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS), lactate measurements, and biomarkers for early abdominal injury in neonates undergoing complex aortic arch repair. MethodsNeonates scheduled for aortic arch reconstruction via median sternotomy between 2009 and 2011 were randomized to either DHCA or ACP. During surgery, regional oxygen saturations of the abdomen were monitored using NIRS. Immediately aafter DHCA or ACP, lactate concentrations from the inferior vena cava were compared with those from the arterial cannula. Postoperatively, biomarkers for early abdominal organ injury were measured in urine. ResultsTwenty-five neonates were analyzed (DHCA, n =  12; ACP, n =  13). Procedures were performed at 18 °C, and ACP flow was set at 35 to 50 mL · kg− 1 · min− 1. Median abdominal NIRS value during DHCA was 31 % (IQR, 28 %- 41 %) whereas during ACP it was 56 % (IQR, 34 %- 64 %; P < . 01 between groups). Immediately after DHCA, median lactate from the inferior vena cava was 4. 2 mmol/L (IQR, 3. 3 - 5. 3 mmol/L) compared with 3. 1 mmol/L (IQR, 2. 9 - 4. 4 mmol/L) after ACP (P = . 03). Postoperatively, biomarkers for renal and intestinal damage (gluthatione s-transferase and intestinal fatty acid binding protein, respectively) were higher in the DHCA group than for the ACP group (P = . 03, P = . 04, respectively).

40|$|Assessment of coronal knee laxity via manual {{stress testing}} is {{commonly}} performed during joint examination. While {{it is generally}} accepted that the knee should be flexed slightly to assess its collateral restraints, {{the importance of the}} exact degree of flexion at time of testing has not been documented. The aim of this study therefore was to assess the effect of differing degrees of knee flexion on the magnitude of coronal deflection observed during <b>collateral</b> stress <b>testing.</b> Using non-invasive infrared technology, the real-time coronal and sagittal mechanical femorotibial (MFT) angles of three asymptomatic volunteers were measured. A single examiner, blinded to the real-time display of coronal but not sagittal alignment, held the knee in maximum extension and performed manual varus and valgus stress manoeuvres to a perceived end-point. This sequence was repeated at 5 ° increments up to 30 ° of flexion. This provided unstressed, varus and valgus coronal alignment measurements as well as overall envelope of laxity (valgus angle – varus angle) which were subsequently regressed against knee flexion. Regression analysis indicated that all regression coefficients were significantly different to zero (p < 0. 001). With increasing knee flexion, valgus MFT angles became more valgus and varus MFT angles became more. The overall laxity of the knee in the coronal plane increased approximately fourfold with 30 ° of knee flexion. The results demonstrated that small changes in knee flexion could result in significant changes in coronal knee laxity, an observation which has important clinical relevance and applications. For example the assessment of medial collateral ligament (MCL) injuries can be based on the perceived amount of joint opening with no reference made to knee flexion at time of assessment. Therefore, close attention should be paid to the flexion angle of the knee during stress testing in order to achieve a reliable and reproducible assessment...|$|R

BackgroundThe safety and efficacy of an exclusively systemic application of GM-CSF in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) and collateral artery promotion has not been studied so far. MethodsIn 14 men (age 61 ± 11 years) with chronic stable CAD, the effect of GM-CSF (molgramostim) on quantitatively assessed <b>collateral</b> flow was <b>tested</b> in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled fashion. The study protocol consisted of an invasive collateral flow index (CFI) measurement in a stenotic as well as a normal coronary artery before and after a two-week period with subcutaneous GM-CSF (10 μg/kg; n = 7) or placebo (n = 7). Collateral flow index was determined by simultaneous measurement of mean aortic, distal coronary occlusive, and central venous pressure. ResultsCollateral flow index in all vessels changed from 0. 116 ± 0. 05 to 0. 159 ± 0. 07 in the GM-CSF group (p = 0. 028) and from 0. 166 ± 0. 06 to 0. 166 ± 0. 04 in the placebo group (p = NS). The treatment-induced difference in CFI was + 0. 042 ± 0. 05 in the GM-CSF group and − 0. 001 ± 0. 04 in the placebo group (p = 0. 035). Among 11 determined cytokines, chemokines, and their monocytic receptor concentrations, the treatment-induced change in CFI was predicted by the respective change in tumor necrosis factor-alpha concentration. Two of seven patients in the GM-CSF group and none in the placebo group suffered an acute coronary syndrome during the treatment period. ConclusionsA subcutaneous-only, short-term protocol of GM-CSF is effective in promoting coronary collateral artery growth among patients with CAD.

40|$|The striatopallidal (indirect) pathway is {{considered}} {{as the main}} modulatory locus for the basal ganglia control of motor functions. According to the classic basal ganglia model, the striatopallidal pathway inhibits motor activity mainly via its projection to globus pallidus (GPe). However, striatopallidal medium spiny neurons (MSNs) form extensive feedback and lateral inhibitory networks via their collaterals. Thus, the striatopallidal pathway may control motor activity either through its projections onto GPe or through the striatal collaterals. To further define the circuit mechanism whereby the striatopallidal pathway controls motor activity, we have developed two new optogenetic transgenic mouse lines expressing channelrhodospin- 2 (ChR 2) or archaerhodopsin- 3 (Arch) selectively in the striatopallidal neurons under the Adora 2 a gene promoter. Consistent with previous optogenetic studies, we found that ChR 2 activation and Arch silencing of the striatopallidal neurons in dorsolateral striatum (DLS) suppressed and increased motor activity, respectively. However, contrary to the prediction from the classical model, we found that selective activation of the striatopallidal axon projections in GPe increased locomotor activity. Thus, light stimulation of MSN cell bodies and collaterals in DLS, versus stimulation in GPe axon projections, produced opposite motor responses. This led us to reassess {{the function of the}} striatopallidal <b>collaterals</b> and to <b>test</b> the hypothesis that the profuse projections and collaterization within the striatum may contribute to striatopallidal pathway control of motor activity. We found that ChR 2 -mediated activation of the striatopallidal neurons in DLS induced c-Fos expression in ChR 2 /GFP-positive MSNs. Conversely, Arch-mediated silencing of the striatopallidal neurons induced c-Fos expression and MAPK phosphorylation in Arch/GFP-negative MSNs surrounding the Arch/GFP-positive MSNs. This c-Fos/pMAPK expression pattern in MSNs is consistent with the suppression of GABA release in GFP-positive cells, resulting in the induction of c-Fos in GFP-negative cells having collateral connections with the GFP-positive cells. Together, our findings revealed a previously unrecognized complexity and novel motor control mechanism of the striatopallidal pathway: activation of striatopallidal projections to GPe increases motor activity while activation of striatopallidal neurons and collaterals in the DLS may contribute to motor suppression. These findings call for a revisit of GPe as a potential locus for deep brain stimulation in Parkinson’s disease...|$|R

40|$|Of the {{approximately}} 8 million Americans {{who suffer from}} ischemic peripheral arterial occlusive disease (PAOD), many present with intermittent claudication, or pain associated with exercise. Impaired vasodilation of resistance vessels is a potential explanation for this symptom. Occluded arteries can lead to increased flow through collateral vessels, which function as natural bypasses around the obstruction. This increase in blood flow and resulting shear stress can cause outward remodeling, or arteriogenesis, which improves the efficacy of collaterals. However, following femoral artery ligation in a mouse model of chronic ischemia, vasodilation in the stem region of collateral vessels is impaired at day 7. In the outwardly remodeled collateral stem, the vessel diameter increase is not associated with cell proliferation, suggesting the functionality of the present smooth muscle cells (SMCs) {{may account for the}} impaired vasodilation. A potential mechanism for increased vessel diameter in the collateral stem is mechanoadaptation of the vascular SMCs to adapt to the increased fluid shear stress {{as a result of the}} increased blood flow. Indeed, decreased SMC overlap and increased SMC length (indicators of mechanoadaptation) coincides with impaired vasodilation in the C 57 BL/ 6 mouse strain, which exhibits a large number of collateral vessels and robust collateral remodeling. Collateral density, remodeling following an ischemic event, and VEGF-A expression differ widely among mouse strains, with BALB/c mice exhibiting impaired arteriogenesis due to a polymorphism of the Vegfa gene. It is hypothesized that following femoral artery occlusion in BALB/c mice, the SMC mechanoadaptation in the profunda femoris artery will be impaired, which should normalize vasodilation, if mechanoadaptation is a cause of impaired vasodilation in the <b>collateral</b> stem. To <b>test</b> this hypothesis, the femoral artery was ligated in BALB/c mice, before maximal vasodilation at day- 7 post-surgery. The animals were then perfusion fixed before resecting and immunostaining the profunda femoris artery to measure SMC length and overlap. The resting and diameters were not different at 40 3 m and 48 2 m, and the maximally dilated diamters were not different at 61 4 m, and 65 3 m for the control and day- 7 post-ligation profunda femoris arteries, respectively. The increase in diameter for day- 7 post-ligation and control profunda femoris arteries were not different, with a percent change of 52 11 % and 413 %. SMC length between day- 7 post-ligation and control hindlimbs was not different, at 351 26 m verses 318 57 m in the control. SMC overlap reduced in the day- 7 post-ligation hindlimb, 18 2 m versus 22 m in the control. These results indicate a subtle impairment in BALB/c collateral stem remodeling, and suggest that the cell processes involved in increasing smooth muscle cell length may impair vasodilation signaling. Further studies are necessary to evaluate the causal relationship between mechanoadaptive remodeling and impaired vasodilation...|$|R
40|$|Data on new {{predictors}} of outcome include penumbra core or <b>collaterals.</b> Objective: To <b>test</b> the predictive value of recanalization, collaterals, penumbra and core of ischemia for functional outcome {{in a large}} group of patients with MCA occlusion. Method: Consecutive events included prospectively in the Acute Stroke Registry and Analysis of Lausanne from April 2002 to April 2009 with an acute stroke due to proximal MCA occlusion (M 1) were considered for analysis. Acute CTA were reviewed to grade the collaterals (dichotomized in poor __ 50 % or good _ 50 % compared to the normal side) and localization of M 1 occlusion (proximal or mid-distal). Acute CTP were reviewed and reconstructed to determine penumbra, core and stroke index (penumbra/penumbra_core) of brain ischemia. Good outcome was defined by mRS 0 - 2 at 3 months. Results: Among 242 events (115 male, mean NIHSS 18. 1, SD 5. 8, mean age 66, SD 15), 42 % were treated with intravenous thrombolysis, and 3 % with intraarterial thrombolysis. Collateral status was rated as poor in 53 % of events and proximal M 1 occlusion was present in 64 %. Recanalization determined at 24 hours with CTA was complete in 26 % events and partial/absent in 54 %. CTP was available for 212 events. Mean penumbra was 88. 6 cm 3 (median 84. 4, SD 53. 8), mean core was 54. 1 cm 3 (median 46. 2, SD 45. 7) and stroke index was 64 % (median 68 %, SD 25 %). Good outcome was observed in 87 events (36 %) and was associated in multivariate logistic regression with thrombolysis (p_ 0. 02, OR_ 2. 5, 95 % CI 1. 2 - 5. 4), recanalization (p_ 0. 001, OR_ 4. 1, 95 % CI 1. 9 - 8. 9), lower NIHSS (p_ 0. 001, OR_ 0. 84, 95 % CI 0. 78 - 0. 91), male gender (p_ 0. 01, OR_ 2. 8, 95 % CI 1. 3 - 5. 9), mRS prior to stroke (p_ 0. 02, OR_ 0. 5, 95 % CI 0. 28 - 0. 9) and good collateral status (p_ 0. 005, OR_ 3, 95 % CI 1. 4 - 6. 4). Nor penumbra, nor core, nor stroke index were significant in the multivariate model, even if an association was present in the univariate model between good functional outcome and penumbra (p_ 0. 004, OR_ 1. 008, 95 % CI 1. 003 - 1. 01), core (p_ 0. 001, OR_ 0. 98, 95 % CI 0. 976 - 0. 99) and strokeindex (p_ 0. 001, OR_ 16. 7, 95 % CI 4. 6 59. 9). Conclusion: MCA recanalization is the best predictor for good functional outcome, followed by collateral status. CTP data did not predict the functional outcome in our large group of M 1 occlusion.

40|$|Since the 1970 s {{there has}} been a rising trend in South Africa for legal {{professionals}} to use the services of psychologists in legal proceedings. Psychologists have therefore increasingly started to appear as expert witnesses in court cases. Despite this, the field of forensic psychology in South Africa has yet to be defined and delineated. Currently there are no set guidelines or regulations regarding who is qualified to do forensic work, and no standards against which this work can be measured. Psychology in the courtroom has begun to receive a notorious reputation as a result of this. The Professional Board for Psychology (PBP) of the Health Professions Council of South Africa (HPCSA) is investigating {{the creation of a new}} category of registration, that of Forensic Psychologist, partly in an effort to manage and address this problem. However, to date little, if any, research has been conducted on the scope of the work presented to the courts by psychologists appearing as expert witnesses. This research aimed to address this gap by analysing a sample of forensic psychological reports. The following aspects were investigated: Who (category or registration, length of registration, etc.) is doing sentencing reports; How (interviews, <b>collateral</b> information, psychometric <b>tests,</b> etc.) these reports are compiled; and Whether these reports measure up to professional expectations as well as adhere to the guidelines of the HPCSA. It is clear from the results of this research that some of the psychologists doing forensic assessments and writing reports do so in an idiosyncratic way. Besides the fact that no uniformity exists, forensic work is sometimes done by psychologists who are not qualified to do so in terms of their registration category and thus their scope of practice. The reports analysed did not always measure up to guidelines or professional standards from abroad (in lieu of local standards or guidelines for reports) and/or transgressions were made in terms of HPCSA policies and guidelines. This situation is understandable in the light of two shortfalls in this field, namely training and regulation. The following recommendations can be made on the basis of this study: That psychologists who are adequately trained and have the proven experience in forensic work, be accredited by the PBP; That guidelines and standards for forensic work be drawn up by the PBP; in addition, that more complete ethical guidelines than those contained in chapter 7 of the PBP’s Rules of Conduct Pertaining Specifically to Psychology also be drawn up; That adequate training at MA level in basic forensic issues be made compulsory, with the option of advanced training for those wishing to specialise in the field; and That lawyers be trained in basic concepts of psychology so as to allow for better selection of an appropriate psychologist to assist them and also to assure effective cross-examination regarding psychological issues in court. If these recommendations were implemented, they could aid in regulating the field, thus producing forensic work of a consistently high quality. This will hopefully help to narrow the gap between the expected and actual interaction between law and psychology. CopyrightDissertation (MA) [...] University of Pretoria, 2010.

40|$| (Performance®, Biomet, Warsaw, IND, USA) {{demonstrated}} {{very low}} gravimetric wear. The wear {{rate of the}} same implant in the fixed mode compared to the rotating platform mode was four times higher (p 1100 TKA. This group of replaced knees was primarily constituted of Performance TKA. Approximately 600 CR implants were available to compare to 500 PS knees. This latter group consist of 250 PS fixed and 250 PS-RP knees. Our analysis of the results in this large cohort of patients revealed no difference in outcome. However this study is not a randomized controlled trial, but rather a retrospective investigation by the single surgeon using a single implant in three different versions [Delport et al., The Open Orthopaedics Journal]. Nevertheless, many other publications also concluded {{that the use of}} a Rotating Platform does not lead to improved clinical success. III. Discussion [...] Chapter III: Experimental setup of the soft tissue envelope analysis in the human knee joint before and after TKA. I. Introduction. We became convinced that if we are trying to improve the post-operative function it is useful to look at the behaviour of the native knee and try to copy this in the replaced knee. This work is a continuation of the fundamental research line of the Orthopaedic Department, and the Department of Biomechanics of the University Hospitals Pellenberg Leuven, into the field of clinical and fundamental research on orthopaedic implant technology. This part of the doctoral work was conducted in cooperation with the European Center for Knee Research (Smith & Nephew, Haasrode, Belgium). With the idea in mind that ligament strains in the native knee should be similar to those after TKA, we intended to measure the medial and the lateral collateral ligament strain before and after TKA. We believe that ligamentous strains after TKA should be similar or close to the native situation to prevent patient discomfort and improve function. We also think that it is only possible to closely reproduce the kinematics of a normal knee in a TKA if the ligaments remain isometric. Due to differences in material properties and surface geometry, however we realise that reconstruction of native laxity using contemporary TKA remains difficult. II. Aims. The aim of this project is to determine how collateral ligament strains compare before and after TKA using a measured resection technique with specimen specific cutting blocks. III. Hypothesis. 1. Length changes of the medial and lateral collateral ligament will be smaller than 5 % when measured directly by extensometers in the native knee during laxity testing. 2. 1. Length changes of the medial and lateral collateral ligament will be smaller than 5 % when measured directly by extensometers in the native knee during several motor tasks. 3. Insertion of a knee prosthesis aiming at neutral alignment will alter ligament strains, knee mechanics and kinematics during several motor tasks more than when implanted in constitutional alignment. 4. It is possible to determine a safe zone for frontal plane TKA alignment in relation to the constitutional alignment axis in which ligament strains are almost physiological (average strain deviations less than 5 %). IV. Methodology of the ex vivo experiment. An in vitro cadaver test (6 specimens) - Using extensometers (MTS) - Using a navigation system (Vicon) - Using pressure measurements (Tekscan). The work was performed using fresh frozen cadaver specimens. Trackers with reflecting spheres were mounted on the tibia, femur and patella of the frozen specimen. A spiral CT scan was performed to determine the spatial relation of the surface anatomy of the knee and reference insertions of ligaments to the tracking spheres. This was done using commercially available segmentation software. V. Materials: Part I, II, III and IV. We prepared the ligaments using the MCL technique of LaPrade and the LCL technique of Espregueira and sutured the extensometers. For the laxity test we measured the strain in the collateral ligaments directly with extensometers to quantify ligament laxity. We also measured the strain in the collateral ligaments directly with extensometers simulating three motor tasks: passive  open chain - squat. Then we implanted a Genesis II PS fixed bearing in neutral position (0 &# 176;) using Patient Specific Guides (Visionaire, Smith & Nephew). Same tests were repeated for both settings. In 7 the relation between post-operative alignment and ligament strain was evaluated by introducing different alignment conditions. VI. Methodological sequence. Chapter IV: The Laxity <b>test.</b> <b>Collateral</b> ligament strains during knee joint laxity evaluation before and after TKA. This study enables a very precise measurement of varus and valgus laxity as compared to clinical assessment. The biomechanics of the ligaments in the replaced knee are significantly different from those in the native knee. In the native knee, strain increases with flexion in the MCL, while the LCL relaxes in flexion. The differences are very subtle, never exceeding more than 2 - 3 mm (in terms of changes in length) or 2 - 3 &# 176; (in terms of tibial tilting); thus, they could potentially go unnoticed, even by an experienced surgeon. After insertion of a TKA, strain decreases in the MCL during flexion while increasing minimally in the LCL. However, since we tried to preserve the ligaments that act isometrically, it might be appropriate to aim for a laxity that is within the range of the native knee. We concluded that the range of varus-valgus laxity in extension and flexion as measured passively in cadaver specimens are small and near-isometric. Further investigation is necessary to determine if the laxity data from this study after implantation of a contemporary PS-TKA can inform the surgeon regarding what to aim for in positioning the implant with respect to the mechanical axis. Chapter V: Relation between post-operative alignment and ligament strain. Restoration of constitutional alignment in TKA leads to more physiological strains in the collateral ligaments. The MCL and the LCL showed minimal changes in length when measured directly by extensometers in the native knee during 3 motor tasks (passive motion  open chain  squat). With our technique using extensometers directly on the ligaments we measured strains of less than 2 % confirming our first hypothesis. Several published data, including the excellent doctoral thesis of Jan Victor, although using other techniques, concluded to similar figures. The LCL showed the same pattern of strains less than 2 % until 80 &# 176; of flexion. Thereafter the LCL demonstrated gradually more laxity. Insertion of a total knee led to minimal differences compared to the native knee on the medial side (MCL), at least during passive and open chain motions with differences in strain of less than ± 2 % over the flexion range = isometric. The lateral ligament(LCL) showed quite different behavior. This ligament is stretched by an extra 6 % compared to the native situation during open chain. This means that hypothesis 2 is also confirmed. Insertion of a TKA will alter kinematics and lateral ligament strains in the unloaded situation. In the loaded test however, after insertion of a total knee and during squatting, the MCL showed 9 % extra strain. The LCL relaxes more during squatting after TKA reaching almost 6 % less strain at 120 &# 176; compared to the native situation. We have also showed that during passive motion knee behaviour is more determined by the soft tissue envelope than during loaded motor tasks where the geometry of the articular surface becomes more important. To investigate Hypothesis 2 and 3, we evaluated the influence of surgical malposition with the same set of tests. As suggested in the literature we also believe that surgical malposition of a TKP (even minor) has an influence on the strain in both medial and lateral collateral ligaments. (see graphs). We observed clear differences in collateral ligament strains using the inserts, mimicking malalignment. In the varus malposition, the LCL is more strained and in the valgus malposition the MCL is more under strain compared to the neutral situation. This means that 5 &# 176; of deviation gives rise to high strains in the opposite ligament. Varus and valgus malalignment leads to strain deviations close to or larger than 5 %. Strain deviations were typically higher for less-loaded motor tasks and less high for the highly-loaded motor task (squat). Although data presented are averages for the six specimens, the conclusions remained valid for each specimen separately. We have proved that strain deviations (for both ligaments taken together) are always minimal for the TKA configurations closest to constitutional alignment. Varus and valgus inserts systematically lead to strain deviations, which are higher, while absolute neutral alignment also shows relatively low strain deviations, albeit higher than in constitutional alignment. All this is consistently true for all motor tasks. Since the extensometers were capable of detecting strain with an accuracy of 1. 0 %, we believe that our measurements are comparable with the natural behavior of the mechanoreceptors in the human knee soft tissue envelope. Type I Ruffini receptors have a very low threshold and high sensitivity, driven by very small tensile stresses (around 15 kPa = 112 mm Hg, to compare atmospheric pressure is 760 mm Hg). Our second hypothesis was also confirmed. Fitting a quadratic trend-line to the data shows good matching for the loaded motor tasks and a less good fit for passive motion. The minimum of the parabolic curves is always situated close to constitutional alignment (indicated with the dashed line in figure below). Using these data,we are able to calculate this safe zone around the neutral axis as well as around the constitutional axis. This proved our third hypothesis. If the surgeon aims for a minimal strain deviation of 4 %, he should determine the final leg alignment after TKA maximal 4 &# 176; varus o...|$|R
