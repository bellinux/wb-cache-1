5000|$|The {{calculated}} altitude (Hc) {{is compared}} to the observed altitude (Ho, sextant altitude (Hs) corrected for various errors). The difference between Hc and Ho is called [...] "intercept" [...] and is the observer's distance from the assumed position. The resulting line of position (LOP) is a small segment of the <b>circle</b> <b>of</b> <b>equal</b> <b>altitude,</b> and is represented by a straight line perpendicular to the azimuth of the celestial body. When plotting the small segment of this circle on a chart it is drawn as a straight line, the resulting tiny errors {{are too small to}} be significant.|$|E
5000|$|He [...] "discovered" [...] the (later so-called) line of {{position}} or <b>circle</b> <b>of</b> <b>equal</b> <b>altitude,</b> which he named [...] "parallel of equal altitude" [...] on a voyage from South Carolina to Scotland in 1837. On December 17, 1837, as he was nearing the coast of Wales, he was uncertain of his position after several days of cloudy weather and no sights. A momentary opening in the clouds allowed {{him to take a}} sight of the sun which he reduced with his estimated latitude. Measuring the longitude depended on knowing the latitude accurately. Being uncertain about the latitude he reduced the sight again using 10' greater and 20' greater latitude, plotted the longitude for each one, and he observed that all three resulting positions were located in a straight line which also happened to pass through Smalls Lighthouse (off the coast of Pembrokeshire in Wales). He reasoned that he must be located somewhere along that line and so he set course along that line reasoning that he should eventually sight the light which, in fact he did. He realized that a single observation of the altitude of a celestial body determines the position of a line somewhere on which the observer is located. Sumner published his findings six years later in 1843 and this method of resolving a sight for two different latitudes and drawing a [...] "line {{of position}}" [...] through the two positions obtained was an important development in celestial navigation. The method was instantly recognized as important and a copy of the pamphlet describing the method was supplied to every ship in the United States Navy.|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we present two new {{approaches}} to planetary rover perception. One approach concerns stereo driving without 3 -D reconstruction. This approach begins with weakly calibrated stereo images, and evaluates the traversability of terrain using shape indicators such as relative slope and relative elevation. The approach then evaluates candidate paths based on the traversability analysis and generates the best path. The second approach involves estimating vehicle position by observing the Sun. At a given time, a measurement of the Sun 2 ̆ 7 s altitude constrains the observer to lie on a circle on the terrestrial surface called the <b>circle</b> <b>of</b> <b>equal</b> <b>altitude.</b> We determine {{the position of the}} observer by intersecting circles of equal altitude identified at different times. We are validating experimentally both approaches in unstructured, outdoor environments with several wheeled rovers, Future efforts will transfer the developed technology into Lunar Rover demonstration and flight programs...|$|E

50|$|In {{classical}} geometry, the bisection is {{a simple}} compass and straightedge construction, whose possibility depends {{on the ability to}} draw <b>circles</b> <b>of</b> <b>equal</b> radii and different centers.

5000|$|Bending {{the rules}} by {{allowing}} {{an infinite number}} of compass-and-straightedge operations or by performing the operations in certain non-Euclidean geometries also makes squaring the circle possible in some sense. For example, although the circle cannot be squared in Euclidean space, it sometimes can be in hyperbolic geometry under suitable interpretations of the terms. [...] As there are no squares in the hyperbolic plane, their role needs to be taken by regular quadrilaterals, meaning quadrilaterals with all sides congruent and all angles congruent (but these angles are strictly smaller than right angles).There exist, in the hyperbolic plane, (countably) infinitely many pairs <b>of</b> constructible <b>circles</b> and constructible regular quadrilaterals <b>of</b> <b>equal</b> area, which, however, are constructed simultaneously.There is no method for starting with a regular quadrilateral and constructing the <b>circle</b> <b>of</b> <b>equal</b> area, and there is no method for starting with a circle and constructing a regular quadrilateral <b>of</b> <b>equal</b> area (even when the circle has small enough radius such that a regular quadrilateral <b>of</b> <b>equal</b> area exists).|$|R
40|$|This paper derives {{the exact}} {{distribution}} [...] {{in the sense}} of not asymptotic [...] of the number of perceived conflicts with prescribed duration during a known time period.

The underlying statistical assumption regarding aircraft arrivals is that they are independent, with respect to the air routes, and subject to Poisson forms with possibly different parameters. The resulting distribution, it is shown, is not a compound Poisson, as was previously surmised in the literature, but a Poisson sum of combinatorial numbers of independent Poisson variables. It is studied in detail under a certain condition and compared with a compound Poisson and a simulated distribution. ...|$|R
