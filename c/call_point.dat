5000|$|In Europe, Australia, New Zealand, and Asia, pull {{stations}} {{are generally not}} used; instead a manual <b>call</b> <b>point</b> is used, which is usually referred to as an MCP, <b>call</b> <b>point</b> or Fire Point within the fire protection industry and as a [...] "transmitter" [...] in Japan. They are used to allow building occupants to signal that a fire or other emergency exists within the building. They are usually connected to a central fire alarm panel which is in turn connected to an alarm system in the building, and often to a local fire brigade dispatcher as well. The first modern MCP arrived in Europe in 1972 and was developed by KAC.|$|E

50|$|It is {{becoming}} increasingly common in the UK and Europe for wireless MCPs {{to be used in}} temporary environments such as construction sites. These typically provide the same level of protection as a standard wired fire alarm installation, but can be moved around as needed in the changing environment of a building under construction without the need for specialist electrician installation. They often combine <b>call</b> <b>point</b> functionality with sounder and strobe functions for ease of installation.|$|E
50|$|Manual call {{points are}} used to {{initiate}} an alarm signal, and operate {{by means of a}} simple button press. They can form part of a manual alarm system or an automatic alarm system. There will be an indicator on the monitoring unit for visual indication to locate the <b>call</b> <b>point</b> easily, and there should be a visual identifier of the unit which triggered the alarm, typically a mechanical flag which operates on a latch and must be manually reset, e.g. by a key.Previously, the old British standard did not allow hinged covers and plastic resettable elements. Plastic elements must have the same printing as the EN 54 glass.|$|E
50|$|Salem PD is {{the primary}} public-safety {{answering}} point (PSAP) for the City of Salem and is the initial <b>call</b> <b>point</b> responsible for all emergency 911 calls, including medical and fire. In 2013 Salem PD responded to approximately 40,000 calls for service. Approximately 1/8 of all calls are forwarded to the Fire Department, but those calls are also served by SPD. The dispatch center also receives calls for the Salem State University and the SPD works closely with them on matters of mutual concern. The dispatch center is typically staffed by one or two civilian dispatchers, one House Officer/Dispatcher, 1 House Sergeant and 1 lieutenant (Officer in Charge).|$|E

5000|$|Speed: The DRF lists {{times at}} certain call points of each race, and the lengths {{back from the}} lead at each <b>call</b> <b>point.</b> Speed handicappers compare race times to help {{ascertain}} which horses will most likely win the race. The DRF contains a numerical summation of the speed that each horse ran in every race, called a Beyer speed figure. This number is generated through a method developed by Andrew Beyer, and described in his 1975 book Picking Winners. The Beyer speed figures {{takes into account the}} individual class of a race as well as how the racetrack was playing on a particular day to create an aggregate number for each horse.|$|E
50|$|The {{automated}} {{public address}} announcement can be generated automatically by the station's fire warning system, or can be triggered from the station control. The message audio file is usually stored as the primary standard emergency announcement on the station PA/VA system. The message may indicate that a single fire alarm <b>call</b> <b>point</b> in a public area has been operated. If an automatic fire detector in a non-public area is operated, or more than one device or zone reports a fire, the system will start the evacuation procedure and the fire brigade is automatically called. The announcement can be triggered by the station controller to alert station staff of other incidents which need urgent attention. The automated nature of the announcement and its high priority means that it has occasionally been known to cut into manual (lower priority) announcements being made by station staff.|$|E
5000|$|Manual {{fire alarm}} {{activation}} is typically achieved {{through the use}} of a pull station (USA & Canada) or <b>call</b> <b>point</b> (Europe, Australia, Asia and Germany), which then sounds the evacuation alarm for the relevant building or zone. Manual fire alarm activation requires human intervention, as distinct from automatic fire alarm activation such as that provided {{through the use of}} heat detectors and smoke detectors. It is, however, possible for call points/pull stations to be used in conjunction with automatic detection as part of an overall fire detection and alarm system. Systems in completed buildings tend to be wired in and to include a control panel. Systems for use during construction can also be wireless or mechanical, however it is recommended by the Structural Timber Association in the UK that for timber-framed constructions, interconnecting wireless systems be used.|$|E
