40|$|Abstract: This paper {{examines}} how political institutions and election outcomes {{have affected the}} <b>economic</b> <b>reform</b> <b>process</b> in the post-communist transition countries. The analysis is based on panel data estimations using annual data for 26 transition economies for 1992 - 2006. Among political institutions, democratisation has been conducive to <b>economic</b> <b>reforms,</b> while the timing of elections has been unimportant. Among political outcomes, the government‘s share of seats in parliament and {{whether it was a}} coalition government have not affected the <b>economic</b> <b>reform</b> <b>process.</b> Governments with right-wing ideology have implemented more market-economic reforms than governments with other ideologies. Among economic factors, a high development level and high inflation have arguably been conducive to market reforms, while unemployment has had the opposite effect. There are noticeable differences across dif-ferent reform areas, across the early and the later transition phase and across countries in dif-ferent regions...|$|R

40|$|The {{topic of}} this thesis is {{the shaping of}} modern economies, {{represented}} by a case-study of the Norwegian electricity market <b>reform</b> <b>process.</b> The essential questions raised are: “Why are industries and economies organized the way they are?” and “Why {{and how do they}} occasionally experience fairly radical transformations during which we come to see their organizational structures and associated behaviors in entirely different ways?” To answer these questions, the author has followed a radical “market-making” <b>economic</b> <b>reform</b> <b>process</b> through its many projects, processes and rivalries, from its roots in specific historical controversies through its major breakthrough and into a stabilized new economic system. A major argument through out the analysis is that economics as a scientific activity and -community plays a particularly important role in the re-shaping of economic systems. Large scale <b>economic</b> <b>reforms</b> are found to be dependent upon scientific and political powers and legitimacy which results from broad consensus within the relevant scientific communities. In order to make his point, the author presents and discusses various historical <b>economic</b> <b>reform</b> initiatives both within the Norwegian electricity sector, within other sectors of the economy and in other countries. He also presents elements of a broad process of reorientation within economics during the 1970 s and follows these new conceptions up to the electricity market <b>reform</b> <b>process</b> in the late 1980 s. The analysis tries to explain why Norway became a hotbed for market reform of the technically integrated and institutionally complex and locked-in electricity system, but also tries to extract medium range insights about <b>economic</b> <b>reform</b> <b>processes</b> and to discuss more general implications for other large scale <b>economic</b> <b>reform</b> projects as well as for economic theories about economic change - through a rethinking of some of the basics in economic thought...|$|R

In our empirical study we find {{a significant relationship between}} constitutional rules and the <b>economic</b> <b>reform</b> <b>process</b> in post-socialist countries of Europe and Asia after 1989. In principle, the results confirm the arguments of the so-called negative constitutionalists, according to which the main function of the constitution for <b>economic</b> <b>reforms</b> in transition is its func-tioning as a commitment mechanism. The conclusions constitute an important step towards verification of different and often conflicting theories proposed by consti-tutional economists and allow to formulate practical recommendations for constitutional legislators and other actors capable of influencing constitutional change in countries encompassed by the study...|$|R

30|$|The Indian {{economy is}} growing fast since the {{introduction}} of the <b>economic</b> <b>reform</b> <b>process</b> has been recognized by policy analysts and policy makers (Kotwal et al. 2011; Ahluwalia 2002).

In order to examine such implications of <b>economic</b> policy <b>reforms,</b> an economy-wide database such as a social accounting matrix (SAM) that includes a detailed component of household income distribution of different socio-economic groups is required.
