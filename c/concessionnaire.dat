6000|$|The Report then {{proceeds}} {{to point out}} very clearly, the all-important fact which arises from the expropriation of the native from the land. [...] "Apart from the rough plantations," [...] it says, [...] "which barely suffice, to feed the natives themselves and to supply the stations, all {{the fruits of the}} soil are considered as the property of the State or of the <b>Concessionnaire</b> societies." [...] This being so, there is an end forever of free trade, or, indeed, of any trade, save an export by the Government itself, or by a handful of companies which really represent the Government, of the whole wealth of the country to Europe for the benefit of a ring of millionaires.|$|E
60|$|One chance Belgium had. If {{immediately}} upon {{taking over the}} State they had formed a Judicial Commission for the rigid inspection of the whole matter, with power to punish for all past offences, and to examine all the scandals of recent years, then {{they would have done}} something to clear the past. If on the top of that they had freed the land, given up the system of forced labour entirely, and cancelled the charters of all the <b>concessionnaire</b> companies, for the obvious reason that they have notoriously abused their powers, then Belgium could go forward in its colonizing enterprise on the same terms as other States, with her sins expiated so far as expiation is now possible.|$|E
60|$|That {{is for the}} statesmen of Europe and America to determine. America hastened {{before all}} the rest of the world in 1884 to {{recognize}} this new State, and her recognition caused the rest of the world to follow suit. But since then she has done nothing to control what she created. American citizens have suffered as much as British, and American commerce has met with the same impediments, in spite of the shrewd attempt of King Leopold to bribe American complicity by allowing some of her citizens to form a <b>Concessionnaire</b> Company and so to share in the unholy spoils. But America has a high moral sense, and when the true facts are known to her, and when she learns to distinguish the outcome of King Leopold's dollars from the work of honest publicists, she will surely be ready to move in the matter. It was in crushing pirates that America made her first international appearance upon the world's stage. May it be a precedent.|$|E

25|$|There {{are four}} {{categories}} of urban service providers in Morocco: private <b>concessionnaires</b> (38% of urban water customers), municipal utilities (31%), the national public company ONEE (28%), and municipalities providing services directly (3%). De jure, {{according to the}} municipal code of 1976 (Charte Communale), amended in 2002 and 2008, public services such as water supply, sewerage and electricity distribution are the responsibility of municipalities (communes). There are 1,547 municipalities in Morocco, including 249 urban and 1,298 rural municipalities. As mentioned above, some municipalities have delegated service provision to private <b>concessionnaires.</b> In other municipalities the Régies provide these services, often {{not on the basis}} of a specific contract. In the smaller municipalities ONEE often provides services, either with or without a contract (contrat de gestion déléguée) with the municipality. In the case of sewers, many smaller municipalities still provide this service directly, although there is a policy to gradually transfer sewer services to ONEE.|$|R
25|$|Investments are financed from tariff revenues, various {{subsidies}} and transfers (grants and soft loans) by external partners. However, {{there are also}} substantial cross-subsidies. For example, bulk water tariffs charged by ONEE to the private <b>concessionnaires</b> and the Régies are higher than production costs. The surplus is used to cross-subsidize ONEE's activities in rural water supply and in sanitation, where tariffs do not cover costs.|$|R
60|$|If in {{the years}} which {{immediately}} succeeded the Brussels Conference--from 1890 to 1894--a bird's-eye view could be taken of the enormous river which, with its tributaries, forms a great twisted fan radiating over the whole centre of Africa, one would mark in all directions symptoms of European activity. At the Lower Congo one would see crowds of natives, impressed for the service and guarded by black soldiers, working at the railway. At Boma and at Leopoldsville, the two termini of the projected line, cities are rising, with stations, wharves and public buildings. In the extreme southeast one would see an expedition under Stairs exploring and annexing the great district of Katanga, which abuts upon Northern Rhodesia. In the furthest northeast and along the whole eastern border, small military expeditions would be disclosed, fighting against rebellious blacks or Arab raiders. Then, along all {{the lines of the}} rivers, posts were being formed and stations established--some by the State and some by the various <b>concessionnaire</b> companies for the development of their commerce.|$|E
60|$|With the {{characteristic}} {{policy of the}} Congo authorities, it was originally given {{to the world as}} being a triumphant vindication of King Leopold's administration, which would certainly have been the greatest whitewashing contract ever yet carried through upon this planet. Looked at more closely, it is clearly seen that behind the veil of courtly phrase and complimentary forms, every single thing that the Reformers have been claiming has been absolutely established. That the land has been taken. That the produce has been taken. That the people are enslaved. That they are reduced to misery. That the white agents have given the capitas a free hand against them. That there have been illegal holdings of hostages, predatory expeditions, murders and mutilations. All these things are absolutely admitted. I do not know that anything more has ever been claimed, save that the Commission talks coldly of what a private man must talk of hotly, and that the Commission might give the impression that they were isolated acts, whereas the evidence here given and the general depopulation of the country show that they are general, universal, and parts of a single system extending from Leopoldville to the Great Lakes, and from the French border to Katanga. Be it private domain, crown domain, or <b>Concessionnaire</b> territory, be it land of the Kasai, the Anversoise, the Abir, or the Katanga companies, the tale still tells of bloodshed and horror.|$|E
6000|$|Shortly after {{receiving}} this permit, {{for which he}} had paid a considerable sum, certain changes were made in the company by which the State secured a controlling influence in it. A new manager, Major Weyns, appeared, who represented the new régime, superseding M. Lévêque, who had sold the permits {{in the name of the}} original company. Major Weyns was zealous that the whole trade of the country should belong to the <b>Concessionnaire</b> Company, which was practically the Government, according to the usual, but internationally illegal, habit of the State. To secure this trade, the first step was evidently to destroy so well-known and successful a private trader as M. Rabinck. In spite of his permits, therefore, a charge was trumped up against him of having traded illegally in rubber--an offence which, even if he had no permit, was an impossibility in the face of that complete freedom of trade which was guaranteed by the Treaty of Berlin. The young Austrian could not bring himself to believe that the matter was serious. His letters are extant, showing that he regarded the matter as so preposterous that he could not feel any fears upon the subject. He was soon to be undeceived, and his eyes were opened too late to the character of the men and the organization with which he was dealing. Major Weyns sat in court-martial upon him. The offence with which he was charged, dealing illegally in rubber, was one which could only be punished by a maximum imprisonment of a month. This would not serve the purpose in view. Major Weyns within forty minutes tried the case, condemned the prisoner, and sentenced him to a year's imprisonment. There was an attempt to excuse this monstrous sentence afterward by the assertion that the crime punished was that of selling guns to the natives, but as a matter of fact there was at the time no mention of anything of the sort, as is proved by the existing minutes of the trial. Rabinck naturally appealed against such a sentence. He would have been wiser had he submitted to it in the nearest guard-house. In that case he might possibly have escaped with his life. In the other, he was doomed. [...] "He will go," [...] said Major Weyns, [...] "on such a nice little voyage that he will act like this no more, and others will take example from it." [...] The voyage in question was the two thousand miles which separated Katanga from the Appeal Court at Boma. He was to travel all this way under the sole escort of black soldiers, who had their own instructions. The unfortunate man felt that he could never reach his destination alive. [...] "Rumours have it," [...] he wrote to his relatives, [...] "that Europeans who have been taken are poisoned, so if I disappear without further news you may guess what has become of me." [...] Nothing more was heard from him save two agonized letters, begging officials to speed him on his way. He died, as he had foreseen, on the trip down the Congo, and was hurriedly buried in a wayside station when two hours more would have brought the body to Leopoldville. If it is possible to add a darker shadow to the black business it lies in the fact that the apologists of the State endeavoured to make the world believe that their victim's death was due to his own habit of taking morphia. The fact is denied by four creditable witnesses, who knew him well, but most of all is it denied by the activity and energy which had made him one of the leading traders of Central Africa--too good a trader to be allowed open competition with King Leopold's huge commercial monopoly. As a last and almost inconceivable touch, the whole of the dead man's caravans and outfits, amounting to some £15,000, were seized by those who had driven him to his death, and by the last reports neither his relatives nor his creditors have received any portion of this large sum. Consider the whole story and say if it is exaggeration to state that Gustav Maria Rabinck was robbed and murdered by the Congo Free State.|$|E
25|$|Furthermore, {{according}} to a World Bank study of 2008, there is a cross-subsidy of about Dirham 1bn from electricity users who are charged distribution tariffs that are above costs. This allows the <b>concessionnaires</b> and the Régies to generate the revenue necessary {{to pay for the}} inflated tariffs for bulk water, which in turn allows ONEE to cross-subsidize rural water supply and sanitation at an amount that is also about Dirham 1bn.|$|R
50|$|In mid-2009 {{the finance}} {{chief of the}} Federal District, Mario Delgado, and the {{director}} general of the District's water company SACM announced that from mid-2010 onwards the District intends to enhance the participation of the private sector in water supply through concessions, under which the <b>concessionnaires</b> would buy bulk water and distribute it, thus providing an incentive to reduce non-revenue water. A total of four concession covering 11 of the District's 16 delegaciones would be bid out. The concessions would replace the existing four service contracts for metering and billing.|$|R
50|$|As {{mentioned}} before, the two <b>concessionnaires</b> submitted bids with tariffs {{that were}} {{much lower than}} the previous tariffs: 26 percent of the previous tariffs in the East Manila and 57 percent in West Manila. In West Manila the average tariff for all customer groups (base tariff) was 5 Pesos/m3 and in East Manila it was only 2.3 Pesos/m3, compared to 8.6 Pesos/m3 before the concession. Tariffs remained close to these low levels for five years until the first rate rebasing took place in 2002, followed by further significant tariff increases, as shown in the table below.|$|R

60|$|It may be objected {{that this}} is ancient history, and that {{the greater part of}} it refers to a period before the Congo State was annexed to Belgium on August 10th, 1908. But {{responsibility}} cannot be so easily shaken off. The Congo State was founded by the Belgian King, and exploited by Belgian capital, Belgian soldiers and Belgian <b>concessionnaires.</b> It was defended and upheld by successive Belgian Governments, who did all they could to discourage the Reformers. In spite of legal quibbles, it is an insult to common sense to suppose that the responsibility for the Congo has not always rested with Belgium.

50|$|The {{investments}} {{undertaken by}} the concessionaire are financed through retained earnings, the municipality and the State Bank of Ecuador.

50|$|The public {{counterparts}} (delegating authorities) of {{the concessions}} in Morocco are the municipalities. Each delegating authority {{has set up}} a technical committee to regulate the contracts, comprising representatives of the municipality, the Ministry of Interior and the <b>concessionnaire.</b> The committee reviews work plans and reports. In addition, about one year after the contracts in Casablanca and Rabat were signed local supervisory commissions were set up. Also, a supervisory commission was created at the national level. As of 2002, the government concluded that the members representing the delegating authority in the technical committee in Casablanca felt constrained by a lack of expertise compared to the specialists from the private <b>concessionnaire.</b> On the other hand, the <b>concessionnaire</b> felt that there was interference in the management of the services. This improved somewhat after the local supervisory commission was set up in Casablanca. This experience influenced the design of the concession contracts in Tangiers and Tetouan where clauses to protect consumers were added and local supervisory commissions were included in contract design from the beginning.|$|E
6000|$|But {{whichever}} {{solution is}} adopted, {{the conscience of}} Europe should not be content merely with the safeguarding of the future. Surely {{there should be some}} punishment for those who by their injustice and violence have dragged Christianity and civilization in the dirt.

Justice cannot be satisfied with less. An International Commission, with punitive powers, may be exceptional, but the whole circumstances are exceptional, and Europe must rise to them. The fear is, however, that it is the wretched agents on the spot, the poor driven bonus-hunters who will be offered up as victims, whereas the real criminals will escape. The curse of blood and the scorn of every honest man rest upon them already. Would that they were within the reach of human justice also!

5000|$|The {{book was}} {{intended}} as an exposé {{of the situation in}} the so-called Congo Free State (labelled a [...] "rubber regime" [...] by Conan Doyle), an area occupied and designated as the personal property of Leopold II of Belgium and where the serious human rights abuses were occurring. Indigenous people in the region were being brutally exploited and tortured, particularly in the lucrative rubber trade. In the introduction to The Crime of the Congo Conan Doyle wrote: [...] "I am convinced that the reason why public opinion has not been more sensitive upon the question of the Congo Free State is that the terrible story has not been brought thoroughly home to the people", a situation he intended to rectify. Conan Doyle was [...] "strongly of the opinion" [...] that the crimes committed on the Congo were [...] "the greatest to be ever known",and he lauded the work of the Congo Reform Association. Conan Doyle was dismissive of the annexation of the state by Belgium, a situation intended to end the personal rule of the King. Conan Doyle noted that slavery and ivory poaching continued to occur after annexation and that [...] "The Congo State was founded by the Belgian King, and exploited by Belgian capital, Belgian soldiers and Belgian <b>concessionnaires.</b> It was defended and upheld by successive Belgian Governments, who did all they could to discourage the Reformers".|$|R
6000|$|Sir Edward Grey {{has told}} us in his speech of July 22nd, 1909, that a danger to European peace lies in the matter. Let us look this danger {{squarely}} in the face. Whence does it come? Is it from Germany, with her traditions of kindly home life--is this the power which would raise a hand to help the butchers of the Mongalla and of the Domaine de la Couronne? Is it likely that those who so justly admire the splendid private and public example of William II. would draw the sword for Leopold? Both {{in the name of}} trade rights and in that of humanity Germany has a long score to settle on the Congo. Or is it the United States which would stand in the way, when her citizens have vied with our own in withstanding and exposing these iniquities? Or, lastly, is France the danger? There are those who think that because France has capital invested in these enterprises, because the French Congo has itself degenerated under the influence and example of its neighbour, and because France holds a right of pre-emption, that therefore our trouble lies across the Channel. For my own part, I cannot believe it. I know too well the generous, chivalrous instincts of the French people. I know, also, that their colonial record during centuries has been hardly inferior to our own. Such traditions are not lightly set aside, and all will soon be right again when a strong Colonial Minister turns his attention to the <b>concessionnaires</b> in the French Congo. They will remember de Brazza's dying words: [...] "Our Congo must not be turned into a Mongalla." [...] It is an impossibility that France could ally herself with King Leopold, and certainly if such were, indeed, the case, the entente cordiale would be strained to breaking. Surely, then, if these three Powers, the ones most directly involved, have such obvious reasons for helping, rather than hindering, we may go forward without fear. But if it were not so, if all Europe frowned upon our enterprise, we would not be worthy to be the sons of our fathers if we did not go forward on the plain path of national duty.|$|R
