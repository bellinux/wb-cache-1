It can be shown that the exchange rate serves to convert prices of international undiversifiable risks from one currency to another. Put differently, arbitrage ensures that risk carries the same price in any two countries when evaluated from a particular viewpoint. As a consequence of this, expected returns should be equal after being <b>converted</b> to <b>a</b> common <b>currency.</b> We develop, estimate and test a linear 3 -country asset pricing model for exchange risk hedged bond returns. Using US, UK, and German bond portfolio return data we find favorable evidence for the exchange rate being an unconditional converter of prices of risk across countries.

40|$|Background: The rate of extrapair {{paternity}} is {{a commonly}} used index for {{the risk of}} sperm competition in birds, but paternity data exist {{for only a few}} percent of the approximately 10400 extant species. As paternity analyses require extensive field sampling and costly lab work, species coverage in this field will probably not improve much in the foreseeable future. Recent findings from passerine birds, which constitute the largest avian order (, 5 900 species), suggest that sperm phenotypes carry a signature of sperm competition. Here we examine how well standardized measures of sperm length variation can predict the rate of extrapair paternity in passerine birds. Methodology/Principal Findings: We collected sperm samples from 55 passerine species in Canada and Europe for which extrapair paternity rates were already available from either the same (n = 24) or a different (n = 31) study population. We measured the total length of individual spermatozoa and found that both the coefficient of between-male variation (CV bm) and within-male variation (CV wm) in sperm length were strong predictors of the rate of extrapair paternity, explaining as much as 65 % and 58 %, respectively, of the variation in extrapair paternity among species. However, only the CVbm predictor was independent of phylogeny, which implies that it can readily be <b>converted</b> into <b>a</b> <b>currency</b> of extrapair paternity without the need for phylogenetic correction. Conclusion/Significance: We propose the CV bm index as an alternative measure to extrapair paternity for passerine birds...|$|R

Combining US and Soviet time series for output and employment together {{with the results of}} the detailed comparison of labour productivity for 1987, brought me to the conclusion that over the period 1928 - 89 Soviet labour productivity inproved very little relative to the US.

5000|$|The {{validity}} of international comparisons of labour productivity can {{be limited by}} a number of measurement issues. The comparability of output measures can be negatively affected by the use of different valuations, which define the inclusion of taxes, margins, and costs, or different deflation indexes, which turn current output into constant output. Labor input can be biased by different methods used to estimate average hours or different methodologies used to estimate employed persons. [...] In addition, for level comparisons of labor productivity, output needs to be <b>converted</b> into <b>a</b> common <b>currency.</b> The preferred conversion factors are Purchasing Power Parities, but their accuracy can be negatively influenced by the limited representativeness of the goods and services compared and different aggregation methods. To facilitate international comparisons of labor productivity, a number of organizations, such as the OECD, the Groningen Growth Centre, International Labor Comparisons Program, and The Conference Board, prepare productivity data adjusted specifically to enhance the data’s international comparability.|$|R
40|$|Estimates {{of aquatic}} primary {{productivity}} derived from in situ active chl a fluorescence have rapidly gained popularity {{over the past}} 2 decades. This trend has been driven primarily {{by the need to}} improve upon 'conventional' carbon (C) uptake- or oxygen (O 2) evolution-based productivity estimates that require water samples to be incubated ex situ. Unlike the conventional approaches to measuring productivity, chlorophyll fluorescence measurements inherently describe only the activity of photosystem II (PSII) in the light reactions; thus, the photosynthetic 'currency' of the fluorescencebased approach is an electron turnover rate for PSII (ETR PSII). <b>A</b> photosynthetic <b>currency</b> of electrons has limited ecological relevance but can be <b>converted</b> to <b>a</b> <b>currency</b> of carbon if an 'exchange rate', i. e. a value or factor of equivalence for any single time point, is applied. We used fast repetition rate fluorometry (FRRf), mass inlet membrane spectrometry (MIMS) and 14 C uptake to determine ETR PSII, gross and net O 2 evolution and C fixation measured simultaneously for 6 microalgal species and for different steady-state growth conditions. Quantifying the PSII reaction centre (RCII) concentration and the spectral dependency of the effective absorption cross section yielded an FRRf approach that provided a robust estimate of the ETRPSII and gross O 2 evolution for all species and conditions tested; however, the ETRPSII exceeded carbon dioxide (CO 2) uptake by a factor of ̃ 5. 4 to 11. 6. At least 3 species exhibited substantial light-dependent O 2 cycling to account for ̃ 40 to 60 % of the difference between the ETRPSII and CO 2 uptake. The highly variable nature of the ETRPSII:CO 2 uptake 'exchange rate' observed here highlights the need for future studies that rely on active fluorescence to examine aquatic productivity to focus towards a systematic description of how electrons are coupled to C fixation in nature. © Inter-Research 2009...|$|R

The first section considers the PPPs concept and its relation to the exchange rate (ER) concept. The evolution of the ideas about PPPs concept as well as approaches to PPPs estimation is studied. The methodology and progress of the UN International Comparison Project (ICP) is described. The second section presents estimates of GDP using PPPs of international comparisons, including Bulgaria {{from the beginning of the}} century up to the present. The historical and economic changes during this comparatively long period determine three quite different by nature subperiods: until the end of World War II, under the conditions of centrally planning (1945 - 1989) and during the transition to a market economy (after 1989). The results of the first participation of Bulgaria in the European Comparison Programme of real GDP in 1993 are briefly described. An approach is applied to derive GDP estimates based on PPPs around a benchmark year. The importance of the problems considered for the country in connection with the urgent tasks of the transition is pointed out. ...|$|R
