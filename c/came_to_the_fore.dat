5|$|In 1912 the Reformist Party was founded, which {{attracted}} intellectuals. Figures {{like its}} leader, Alejandro Lerroux, helped attract wide {{support from the}} working class. His advocacy of anti-clericalism made him a successful demagogue in Barcelona. He argued that the Catholic Church was inseparable from the system of oppression the people were under. It was around this time that republicanism <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>fore.</b>|$|E
5|$|Wilders {{received}} his secondary {{education at the}} Mavo and Havo {{middle school and high}} school in Venlo.

5|$|With {{the rise}} of nation-states and the Protestant Reformation, the theory of divine right {{justified}} the king's absolute authority in both political and spiritual matters. The theory <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>fore</b> in England under the reign of James I of England (1603–1625, also known as James VI of Scotland 1567–1625). Louis XIV of France (1643–1715) strongly promoted the theory as well.|$|E

5|$|Miller was Australia's top-scorer {{during the}} Victory Tests and <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>fore</b> with his fast bowling. Miller was {{acclaimed}} for his free-spirited and adventurous batting, which he {{attributed to the}} triviality of sport in comparison to war. This was particularly exhibited in his 185 from 165 minutes for Dominions against England. It was through his involvement in wartime cricket that Miller met many of his future international colleagues, such as England's Denis Compton, Bill Edrich and Len Hutton.|$|E
5|$|He {{made his}} debut at The Hawthorns as a {{substitute}} in a 2–1 win over Tranmere Rovers on 9 August 1997. Seven days later he scored two goals from the bench in a 3–2 win over Crewe Alexandra at Gresty Road. Though signed by Ray Harford, he <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>fore</b> under new boss Denis Smith. Smith handed Hughes his first start on 28 December, in a 1–1 home draw with Stoke City. He finished his debut season as the club's top-scorer with 14 goals in 41 appearances, and was rewarded with a new four-year contract.|$|E
5|$|In English, Jonathan Swift (30 November 1667 – 19 October 1745), {{often called}} the {{foremost}} satirist in the English language, gained fame for works such as Gulliver's Travels and A Modest Proposal. Other notable eighteenth century writers of Irish origin included Oliver Goldsmith and Richard Brinsley Sheridan, though they {{spent most of their}} lives in England. The Anglo-Irish novel <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>fore</b> in the nineteenth century, featuring such writers as Charles Kickham, William Carleton, and (in collaboration) Edith Somerville and Violet Florence Martin. The playwright and poet Oscar Wilde, noted for his epigrams, was born in Ireland.|$|E

5|$|Kennedy's role as {{a liberal}} lion in the Senate <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>fore</b> in 1995, when the Republican Revolution took control and {{legislation}} intending to fulfill the Contract with America was coming from Newt Gingrich's House of Representatives. Many Democrats in the Senate and the country overall felt depressed but Kennedy rallied forces to combat the Republicans. By the beginning of 1996, the Republicans had overreached; most of the Contract had failed to pass the Senate and the Democrats could once again move forward with legislation, {{almost all of it}} coming out of Kennedy's staff.|$|E
5|$|The Reformation brought {{changes in}} outlook and artistic {{expression}} as secular and landscape imagery overtook biblical scenes. Sacred imagery {{was shown in}} a didactic and moralistic manner, with religious figures becoming marginalized and relegated to the background. Pieter Bruegel the Elder, {{one of the few}} who followed Bosch's style, is an important bridge between the Early Netherlandish artists and their successors. His work retains many 15th-century conventions, but his perspective and subjects are distinctly modern. Sweeping landscapes <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>fore</b> in paintings that were provisionally religious or mythological, and his genre scenes were complex, with overtones of religious skepticism and even hints of nationalism.|$|E
5|$|Stephen and Constantine Lekapenos <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>fore</b> in 943, {{when they}} opposed a dynastic {{marriage}} for their nephew, Romanos II. Their father {{wanted to have}} his eldest surviving grandson married to Euphrosyne, a daughter of his successful general John Kourkouas. Although such a union would effectively cement the loyalty of the army, it would also strengthen {{the position of the}} legitimate Macedonian line, represented by Romanos II and his father Constantine VII, over the imperial claims of Romanos's own sons. Predictably, Stephen and Constantine opposed this decision, and prevailed upon their father, who was by this time ill and old, to dismiss Kourkouas in the autumn of 944. Romanos II instead married Bertha, an illegitimate daughter of Hugh of Arles, King of Italy, who changed her name to Eudokia after her marriage.|$|E

5|$|The First World War had {{a severe}} effect on Stanford. He was frightened by air-raids, {{and had to}} move from London to Windsor to avoid them. Many of his former pupils were {{casualties}} of the fighting, including Arthur Bliss, wounded, Ivor Gurney, gassed, and George Butterworth, killed. The annual RCM operatic production, which Stanford had supervised and conducted every year since 1885, had to be cancelled. His income declined, as the fall in student numbers at the college reduced the demand for his services. After a serious disagreement {{at the end of}} 1916, his relationship with Parry deteriorated to the point of hostility. Stanford's magnanimity, however, <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>fore</b> when Parry died two years later and Stanford successfully lobbied for him to be buried in St Paul's Cathedral.|$|E
5|$|According to {{the model}} by sinologist Karl August Wittfogel, the loess soils of Shaanxi made it {{possible}} for the Chinese to develop irrigated agriculture early on. Although this allowed them to expand into the lower reaches of the Yellow River valley, such extensive waterworks on an ever-increasing scale required collective labour, something that could only be managed by some form of bureaucracy. Thus the scholar-bureaucrats <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>fore</b> {{to keep track of the}} income and expenses of the granaries. Walled cities grew up around the granaries for reasons of defence along with ease of administration; they kept invaders out and ensured that citizens remained within. These cities combined to become feudal states, which eventually united to become an empire. Likewise, according to this model, walls not only enveloped cities as time went by, but also lined the borders of the feudal states and eventually the whole Chinese empire to provide protection against raids from the agrarian northern steppes.|$|E
5|$|The 1st Cavalry Division {{arrived in}} Australia and {{continued}} its training at Strathpine, Queensland. Training {{there was more}} vigorous than at Fort Bliss, and Chase broke his heel bone in a training accident. In December 1943, the 1st Cavalry Division sailed for Oro Bay, where it staged for its next operation, the Admiralty Islands campaign. Chase was chosen to lead the assault. Here, his tactical expertise <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>fore.</b> He resisted the temptation to overrun the island of Los Negros, and thereby overextend his forces, and instead formed a defensive perimeter that made good use of the terrain. From this position, {{he was able to}} defeat a series of counterattacks by the numerically superior Japanese garrison. The crisis passed, Chase's force was reinforced {{by the rest of the}} division, and the 1st Cavalry Division was then able to overrun the islands. Chase was awarded the Bronze Star for his role in the campaign.|$|E

5|$|The British government's {{refusal to}} grant {{independence}} to Southern Rhodesia under the 1961 constitution was largely {{the result of}} the geopolitical and moral shifts associated with the Wind of Change, coupled with the UK's wish to avoid opprobrium and loss of prestige in the United Nations (UN) and the Commonwealth. The issue gained international attention in Africa and worldwide as a flashpoint for questions of decolonisation and racism. By the early 1960s, general consensus in the post-colonial UN—particularly the General Assembly, where the communist bloc and the Afro-Asian lobby were collectively very strong—roundly denounced all forms of colonialism, and supported communist-backed black nationalist insurgencies across southern Africa, regarding them as racial liberation movements. Amid the Cold War, Britain opposed the spread of Soviet and Chinese influence into Africa, but knew it would become an international pariah if it publicly expressed reservations or backed down on NIBMAR in the Southern Rhodesia question. Once the topic of Southern Rhodesia <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>fore</b> in the UN and other bodies, particularly the Organisation of African Unity (OAU), even maintaining the status quo became regarded as unacceptable internationally, causing the UK government a great deal of embarrassment.|$|E
5|$|The NWOBHM {{triggered}} a renaissance in a stagnant rock genre, but took on heavy criticism for the excessive local media hype surrounding {{a legion of}} typically mediocre musicians. Detractors think that, unlike heavy metal of the preceding decades, their music was unoriginal and included no classic rock recordings. Nevertheless, these bands and their diverse output offered a blueprint that counterparts across the Western world would later emulate and expand. The collision of styles that characterised the NWOBHM {{is now seen as}} key to the diversification of heavy metal {{in the second half of}} the 1980s into various subgenres that <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>fore</b> in the 1990s. The stardom of Def Leppard in the US provided a catalyst for the growth of glam metal, just as bands like Angel Witch, Witchfynde, Cloven Hoof and especially Venom generated the music, lyrics, cover art and attitude that sparked black metal in its various forms in Europe and America. Motörhead, Iron Maiden, Raven, Tank, Venom and other minor groups are viewed as precursors of speed metal and thrash metal, two subgenres which carried forward the crossover with punk, incorporating elements of hardcore while amplifying volume, velocity and aggressive tone.|$|E
5|$|The {{assemblage}} of monumental Neolithic structures in Orkney is without parallel in the United Kingdom {{and on the}} Orkney Mainland provides an entire landscape of features from this period. During this time, complex new societies <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>fore</b> that were {{a radical departure from}} the earlier hunter-gatherers and which were capable of creating substantial structures. The Neolithic in Scotland lasted from approximately 4000 to 2200 BC and Orkney as a whole has nearly 3,000 identified Neolithic sites all told. British archaeologists have often interpreted this era as having two distinct phases; the Earlier Neolithic dominated by regional styles of pottery and architecture followed by a relatively abrupt change into the Later Neolithic characterised by new traditions found throughout the British Isles that incorporate structures on a grander scale. In the Orcadian context, there are definite developments during the Neolithic, but the changes are gradual and tend to build on earlier ideas rather than appearing to form two distinct periods.|$|E

5|$|Sainsbury added {{himself to}} the list of early Somerset centurions during 1878, hitting 105 while batting at number 6 against Hertfordshire. In doing so, he batted for over four hours, and shared an eighth wicket {{partnership}} of 114 with Francis Reed, out of a Somerset total of 249. His bowling was also on form during the match, and after collecting two wickets in the first innings, he claimed five in the second. The Somerset side during the late 1870s reflected the strength of the Lansdown club: of the eleven players that represented Somerset in their match against the Marylebone Cricket Club in early August 1878, five of them also represented Lansdown when the London club travelled down to Bath. In between these two matches against the MCC, Sainsbury scored a half-century for Somerset during their match against Devon. Toward the end of August, Sainsbury's bowling once again <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>fore,</b> as he claimed five wickets in the first innings against Worcestershire to help defend Somerset's lead and propel them to an innings victory. He once again led the Somerset batting averages, scoring 211 runs at an average of 35.16, while his 13 wickets were the second most in the team, at an average of 9.69.|$|E
5|$|The intense {{competition}} between {{the kingdom of the}} western Deccan and those of the Tamil country <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>fore</b> in the 11th century over the acutely contested fertile river valleys in the doab region of the Krishna and Godavari River called Vengi (modern coastal Andhra Pradesh). The Western Chalukyas and the Chola Dynasty fought many bitter wars over control of this strategic resource. The imperial Cholas gained power {{during the time of the}} famous king Rajaraja Chola I and the crown prince Rajendra Chola I. The Eastern Chalukyas of Vengi were cousins of the Western Chalukyas but became increasingly influenced by the Cholas through their marital ties with the Tamil kingdom. As this was against the interests of the Western Chalukyas, they wasted no time in involving themselves politically and militarily in Vengi. When King Satyashraya succeeded Tailapa II to the throne, he was able to protect his kingdom from Chola aggression as well as his northern territories in Konkan and Gujarat although his control over Vengi was shaky. His successor, Jayasimha II, fought many battles with the Cholas in the south around c. 1020–21 when both these powerful kingdoms struggled to choose the Vengi king. Shortly thereafter in c. 1024, Jayasimha II subdued the Paramara of central India and the rebellious Yadava King Bhillama.|$|E
5|$|Between May 1367 and September 1370 repairs costing £2,262 {{were carried}} out. Records show that {{sections}} of the curtain wall were repaired and two mural towers built, one of them replacing a tower on the same site. The towers were positioned north-east of the keep and still stand. Although more work was undertaken between 1370 and 1377, the year of Edward's death, what it consisted of is unknown. The royal apartments built during HenryIII's reign were never repaired; {{it has been suggested}} this was because by the 14thcentury, when considerable sums were being spent on repairs elsewhere in the castle, Rochester had fallen out of favour as a royal residence. As the castle's importance as a high-status residence waned, its role as a barracks and administrative centre <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>fore.</b> The reign of RichardII (1377–1400) saw the investment of £500 in repairing the castle. This was in part in response to French raids on England's southern coast during the Hundred Years' War as England's fortunes in the conflict worsened. The most significant of these works was the construction of a tower {{at the north end of}} the castle, overlooking the bridge over the Medway. Records document the sum of £350 spent on a new tower between 1378 and 1383, and it mostly likely refers to the one guarding the bridge. Rochester Castle saw fighting for the final time during the Peasants' Revolt of 1381. It was besieged and captured by a group of rebels who plundered the castle and released a prisoner. It has been suggested that the £66 10s spent in 1384–1388 and the £91 13s spent in 1395–1397 may have been partially in response to damage incurred during the revolt.|$|E
