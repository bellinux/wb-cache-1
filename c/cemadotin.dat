The putative second product of the hydrolysis of P 5, N,N-dimethylvalyl-valyl-N-methylvalyl-proline (P 4), had little activity as either an antitubulin or cytotoxic agent. In seven suspension cell lines, the cytotoxicity of tasidotin correlated with total cell uptake of the compound and was probably affected negatively by the extent of degradation of P 5 to proline and, presumably, P 4. The intracellular enzyme prolyl oligopeptidase probably degrades tasidotin to P 5. When CCRF-CEM human leukemia cells were treated with N-benzyloxycarbonylprolylprolinal (BCPP), an inhibitor of prolyl oligopeptidase, there was a 30 -fold increase in the IC 50 of tasidotin and a marked increase in intracellular [3 H]tasidotin. BCPP also caused a 4 -fold increase in the IC 50 of P 5, so the enzyme probably does not convert P 5 to P 4. Inhibiting degradation of P 5 should have led to a decrease in the IC 50 obtained for P 5 in the presence of BCPP...|$|E
40|$|Antibody–drug conjugates are {{increasingly}} being used for cancer therapy, but {{little is known about}} their ability to promote anticancer immunity, which may lead to long-lasting remissions. We investigated the therapeutic effect of antibody-based pharmacodelivery of <b>cemadotin,</b> a cytotoxic drug, and IL 2, a strong proinflammatory cytokine. Using the F 8 antibody, which selectively localizes to the tumor neovasculature, combination treatment led to tumor eradication, in a process dependent onCD 8 þT cells and natural killer cells in the C 1498 syngeneic mouse model of acute myelogenous leukemia. The clinical combination of antibody– drug conjugates and antibody–cytokine proteins should be facilitated by their orthogonal toxicity profiles. Mol Cancer Ther; 13 (7); 1 – 5. 2014 AACR...|$|E
