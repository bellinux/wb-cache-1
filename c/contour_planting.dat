Contour maps are especially useful for diffuse forms or scales of pollution. Acid precipitation is indicated on maps with isoplats. Some of the most widespread applications of environmental science contour maps involve mapping of environmental noise (where lines of equal sound pressure level are denoted isobels), air pollution, soil contamination, thermal pollution and groundwater contamination.

40|$|Yunnan {{province}} is 94 % mountainous and maize {{is one of}} {{the major}} arable crops grown in uplands areas. Increasing the productivity of maize crops on sloping land in the province is an important priority to improve rural incomes and reduce cultivation pressures on the more fragile, marginal land. At present, few soil conservation techniques are employed with maize cultivation to reduce erosion. This field-based study investigated the effectiveness of cultivation practices designed to improve productivity, while maintaining or enhancing soil conservation. This investigation was carried out in Wang Jia Catchment, selected as a representative area of fragile slopes in Yunnan province. Five cultivation treatments, including the use of <b>contour</b> <b>planting,</b> straw and polythene mulches, were selected for evaluation and established on replicated field plots in 1998 and 1999. Crop growth parameters, soil temperature and soil moisture were measured during the growing season and yield was determined at harvest. Straw mulch with <b>contour</b> <b>planting</b> retained soil moisture and was associated with lower soil temperatures. Polythene mulch improved soil moisture retention when the polythene was applied after irrigation and increased soil temperatures by up to 4 C. The changes were associated with increases in green leaf area index, green leaf area duration and crop yield, which was increased by up to 51. 6 % compared to unmulched plots. The effectiveness of theses mulches in reducing runoff and erosion has been evaluated in parallel erosion plot studies (Barton, 1999; Milne, 2001). It is concluded that a cultivation technique combining <b>contour</b> <b>planting</b> with early irrigation and polythene and straw mulches would be the most effective for increasing productivity and improving soil conservation on sloping land in Yunnan province...|$|E
40|$|Practices {{that combine}} GPS-based {{guidance}} for terrain contouring and tillage for runoff detention have potential to increase water infiltration and reduce runoff. The {{objective of this}} study was to investigate <b>contour</b> <b>planting</b> as a means to reduce soil erosion on steep slopes of the Columbia Plateau dryland wheat region. An exploratory field study was conducted on a Ritzville silt loam (coarsesilty, mixed, superactive, mesic Calcidic Haploxerolls) and 0 - 20 percent slopes. Planting was performed with a deep furrow drill on the contour to a depth of 20 cm. Our results demonsrate that a strip of deep-furrow seeding precisely contoured on the upper shoulder slope should provide sufficient detention storage to capture and hold the runoff from a 100 -yr 24 -h storm if the contour strip area was approximately 2 % of the runoff collection area. This research also examined artificial neural networks for generating routing maps that optimize seeding on precise, GPS-guided contours. A contouring algorithm was evaluated in which the direction of a tractor is determined by contour-based neural activity whereby neurons corresponding to regions of the terrain of similar height to that of the tractor’s current position receive the greatest excitatory input. The contour region, therefore, has the global effect of influencing the whole state space to attract the tractor in the right direction.

The project restored 8. 3 acres of hemi-marsh (emergent marsh and shallow open water habitat interspersed in roughly equal parts in a complex pattern), which historically (before 1960) occurred at the site. Around 1960, the area was filled and the hemi 2 ̆ 2 marsh was replaced with mowed lawn. The improvement project consisted of the removal of fill material that was placed at the historic emergent river marsh, site grading to create wetland <b>contours,</b> <b>planting</b> of wetland and riparian botanical species and invasive species-control. The restoration of the wetland {{has created a new}} viable habitat, providing food and cover for wildlife and aquatic species. Since the project is located within Beaver Island State Park, the NYPA engaged in a collaborative design process with the New York State Office of Parks, Recreation, and Historic Preservation the owners of the site and the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation which was interested in restoring a historic emergent wetland in a highly developed urban river corridor. While the primary goal of the project was wetland restoration, other features were added through the collaborative process for recreation and as a means to dispose of 70, 000 CY excavated fill from the wetland restoration. These features include a canoe/kayak launch, an osprey pole, shallow breakwaters and shoreline stabilization, a walking trail and overlook, and conversion of a paved parking lot to a 2 ̆ 2 green 2 ̆ 2  parking lot. Multiple project features posed permitting challenges with the U. S. Army Corps of Engineers since their Nationwide Permit Program focus is on projects with a single purpose.

Soil water stored within 1700 mm was monitored every 2 - 3 weeks by neutron moisture meter. Runoff and erosion were measured after every rain storm. Soil sampling and analysis were conducted one month after sowing and one month before harvesting maize. Crop development was measured as total dry biomass at different growth stages and maize and lablab bean yields were harvested as total dry-matter and yields. Results obtained during the two experimental years (2000 - 2001) showed that alley cropping (AL) was the most effective treatment in decreasing runoff and erosion, while CRP was the second best at erosion control. However, CRP had the highest rate of runoff and erosion under high intensity rainfall during the early growing season. Generally, CRP protected the soil surface from the splash erosion and had better soil physical properties, leading to the highest crop water use efficiency, and had the highest growth rate of Lablab bean.

Such Af estimates are particularly {{used to assess}} the drag coefficient (Cd) in hydro- or aerody- namic studies of organisms. So far, estimates of Af from image analysis were generally biased (as subsequent Cd assessments) for flexible organisms at a given flow, as these estimates were obtained using the same scale for parts of the body being close to or far from the camera. To assess this problem, I used image analyses on 3 flex- ible freshwater macrophytes, each exposed to 3 different flows. For these, using a single image scale resulted in ~ 20 % errors of Af estimates if compared with a multiple scale (16 subscales, providing the "reference area") assessment.

40|$|In {{order to}} assess the water runoff on the sloping {{cultivated}} fields of Central Greece, an experiment was carried out from 1997 to 2000. The following treatments were used: three tillage methods, viz. conventional tillage, reduced tillage with heavy cultivator and disk-harrow: two with or without winter cover crop, two parallel and perpendicular to the <b>contour</b> tillage and <b>planting</b> directions. An existing methodology for predicting runoff was evaluated and improved, {{which is based on}} the estimation of pending time for the different tillage systems in the study area under rainfall. An equation predicting the time to ponding was used obtaining data from infiltration experiments using double-cylinder infiltrometers in the field. The surface runoff of each rain storm was estimated by combining the appropriate infiltration equation with the rain intensity data, taking into consideration not only the excess rainfall rate over the infiltration rate, but also the surface detention. Measured runoff was used to test the validity of the USDA-Soil Conservation Service (SCS) curve number method in the region. The results from this test indicated that this prediction runoff method may not be used in the region without the proper modifications to suit the rainfall in the region. The developed model could be used to successfully estimate runoff and erosion in the area. It was found that the combination of equations of time to incipient ponding and the maximum surface storage capacity of topsoil, could explain about 85 % of the existing runoff variation.

This included: - Soil research in South Vietnam showed that planting of cassava on the same land for many years reduced soil fertility more than with some other crops, trees or natural forest, resulting in soil degradation. - In fertilizer trials, the response of cassava depends on the type of soil and the kind of fertilizers. In both north and south Vietnam cassava showed strong responses to application of N and K, while there was a response to P in only one site. In long-term NPK trials conducted in Thai Nguyen University and in Hung Loc Center the application of 80 : 40 : 80 and 160 : 80 : 160 kg/ha of N-P 2 O 5 -K 2 O gave higher yields and higher economic returns than other treatments. - In intercropping trials conducted on research stations and on farmers’ fields with flat land, cassava intercropped with food crops and grain legumes increased income. In sloping areas cassava intercropping with peanuts or <b>planting</b> <b>contour</b> hedgerows of legume trees like Tephrosia candida or Gliricidia sepium reduced soil loss due to erosion and maintained or improved soil fertility. - In order to reduce the cost of production, the use of pre-emergence herbicides to control weeds was very effective and controlled about 90 % of the weeds for the first 3 - 4 months after planting, resulting in higher profits than when cassava was weeded by hand or when post-emergence herbicides were applied...|$|R
40|$|A {{pilot project}} {{on the use of}} Farmer Participatory Research (FPR) methodologies with the {{objective}} of enhancing farmer adoption of practices that minimize soil erosion in cassava-based cropping systems, was conducted jointly by DOA and DOAE with technical and financial support from CIAT in two sites in Nakhon Ratchasima and Sra Kaew provinces. The activities involved a preliminary survey using RRA methodologies, the setting out of demonstration plots, as well as farmers meetings and farmers field trips to observe the demonstration plots. The activities also included conducting various types of FPR trials with farmers on their own land and organizing a farmer's field day to harvest these trials, to discuss the results, and to select the best treatments for next-year's trials. The results revealed that the highest yield of cassava in Soeng Saang district of Nakhorn Ratchasima province was obtained from <b>planting</b> <b>contour</b> barriers of vetiver grass within cassava plots; this practice also resulted in the lowest level of soil erosion. On the contrary, in Wang Nam Yen district of Sra Kaew province, the highest cassava yield was obtained in plots with upand-down ridging, while the lowest level of soil erosion was observed with contour ridging. However, from the discussion between participating farmers and FPR team members it was concluded that the <b>planting</b> of <b>contour</b> barriers of vetiver grass was the most effective method to reduce erosion in the long-term, even though this treatment neither had produced the highest yield of cassava nor the highest income. Within the same pilot project, FPR trials on cassava varieties and on rates of fertilizer application were conducted in order to motivate farmers to participate m the project. In Wang Nam Yen district, Rayong 90 had the highest yield and ranked second in starch content, while Rayong S had the second highest yield but the highest starch content. In Soeng Saang district, Rayong 90 ranked first in yield and starch content, while Kasetsart 50 ranked second in both yield and starch content. With respect to the fertilizer trials, it was found that in Soeng Saang district the application of 156 kg/ha of 15 - 15 - 15 resulted in both the highest yield of cassava and highest net income...|$|R
40|$|Since 1987 cassava {{agronomy}} {{research has}} been conducted by scientists from national cassava programs in Asia in collaboration and with small financial assistance from the CIAT cassava program. This paper summarizes and pulls together the results obtained, mainly corresponding to the period of 1490 to 1993. Research on cultural practices concentrated on determining the best time of planting and harvest, optimum planting methods and plant spacing as well as intercropping systems that increase farmers' financial returns. Planting cassava stakes in a vertical or inclined position generally increased yields compared with horizontal planting, but differences were not large and depended to some extent on the variety and on soil moisture conditions during planting. Vertical planting always resulted in quicker sprouting and canopy formation, which helps to reduce weed competition and erosion. Among various intercropping systems used in Asia, the interplanting of cassava with peanuts usually produced highest net incomes. A normal square planting arrangement often produced higher total net incomes than the wide-row or double-row arrangements. Long-term fertility trials have now been conducted for 3 - 5 years in nine locations in four countries. Significant responses to N were observed in seven locations and to P and K in four locations each. Responses to fertilizer application, especially to that of K, have been increasing over time. Only in Hung Loc Centre in south Vietnam no significant responses to fertilizer application were observed even after three years of continuous cropping. In most other locations the combined application of N, P and K more than doubled cassava yields. Erosion control trials have been conducted in 12 locations in six countries. The most effective practices to reduce erosion varied somewhat among locations, but generally in cluded <b>contour</b> ridging, closer <b>plant</b> spacing, fertilizer application, mulching and reduced tillage. Other practices, such as the planting of leguminous tree hedgerows, grass contour barriers or intercropping, will have long-term benefits in terms of erosion control, soil fertility maintenance and improving soil moisture conditions. Since the effect of these practices are rather site-specific and depend to a great extent on the socio-economic conditions of farmers,the choice of the best components of the technology, aimed at increasing farmers' income while preventing soil degradation, will need to be done on farmers' fields and through more active farmer participation in the research...|$|R
40|$|The California Department of Transportation (Caltrans) {{conducted}} mitigation work {{to establish}} and protect native wetland and riparian habitat on approximately 0. 5 hectare (1. 3 acres) adjacent to Dan Wilson Creek. Dan Wilson Creek {{is located in the}} Solano Community College property just off of Suisun Valley Road in Fairfield, California. This work mitigates for impacts to 0. 07 hectare (0. 17 acre) of wetland habitat and 0. 05 hectare (0. 13 acre) of riparian habitat resulting from the Solano Interstate Route 80 Widening Project located between Interstate 680 and State Route 12 East. Caltrans began construction on the I- 80 Widening Project in the fall of 2003. Mitigation work coincided with the widening of Interstate 80 over Dan Wilson Creek that occurred during the summer of 2004. Approximately 0. 16 hectare (0. 40 acre) of the land <b>contoured,</b> graded, and <b>planted</b> at the mitigation site will provide riparian habitat and 0. 20 hectare (0. 50 acre) will provide wetland habitat after the five-year monitoring period to meet the mitigation goals established by Caltrans, the California Department of Fish and Game, and the U. S. Army Corps of Engineers. Caltrans biologists obtained a photographic record of the mitigation site in June 2004 before it was graded and contoured. These biologists will obtain photographic records of the same location(s) annually during the five-year monitoring period to monitor the progress of the mitigation project. Caltrans biologists will conduct spring and summer plant surveys to detect early and late-season species and will map the extent of the vegetation cover using a Global Positioning System (GPS). Caltrans biologists will use a minimum of 20 vegetation sample plots, each measuring 3 x 3 meters (10 x 10 feet), to estimate plant coverage and dominance and will collect information on wildlife observed at the mitigation site on an opportunistic basis. The majority of plants installed at the mitigation site have been successful as of June 2005. Approximately 90 % of the plants installed in the upland and upland-riparian zones of the mitigation site showed signs of growth. Approximately 488 (91 %) of the 535 planted arroyo willows were found in the mitigation area, with 313 (64 %) of the counted willows showing signs of growth. Some of the installed wetland plants, including common tule (Scirpus acutus var. occidentalis), have established and spread throughout the wetland zone. Animal species identified by Caltrans biologists in the area before the mitigation work began were again observed in the area after the work. Some of the aquatic species have migrated into the newly developed wetland from Dan Wilson Creek. The number of bird species observed in the area increased after the mitigation work. Birds commonly observed in freshwater pond habitats are using the wetland...|$|R
40|$|For nearly 20 {{years the}} Sahel has been {{suffering}} terrible drought. Despite many projects and heavy investment, the desert continues its inexorable advance on agricultural land, {{and seems to}} be invincible. Recently Segou in Mali was the venue for rural organizations and government representatives of the states concerned, and funding agencies to meet and take stock of the successes and failures of their projects, and try to work out a concerted and lasting plan of campaign against the desert's advance. The population of the Sahel (some 35 million) is higher than ever before, but in many villages crop yields are falling, and often now {{it is a question of}} survival rather than subsistence. In 1984 a CILSS (Comite Inter-Etats de Lutte contre la Secheresse au Sahel/Inter-State Anti-Drought Committee in the Sahel) initiative at Nouakchott brought together representatives from all over the Sahel and defined a common strategy:- to attain self-sufficiency in food while keeping intact the ecological and financial resources of the region. To do this they had to be able to count on the active participation of the people, on the support and coordination of outside aid, and on a combined approach to all systems of production. But putting the key points of the Nouakchott agreement into practice turned out to be more complicated than had been forseen. Too many policy-makers, Sahelian and non-Sahelian, maintained a macroeconomic 'productivist' stance which sees smallholders and their land as of only secondary importance in their strategy. All too often there was poor communication among them and information about the success or failure of projects was not properly circulated either among the countries of the Sahel or within them. But rural organizations - with or without the help of outside agencies - have nevertheless managed to push back the advance of the desert in some cases. These small local projects, learning from their own failures, have single-mindedly managed to obtain some amazing results. But this is not the general picture - and overall the desert marches onward. Very much aware of this state of affairs, CILSS and the Club du Sahel brought together funding agencies and the Sahelian states at Segou in May 1989, and organized a dialogue between the protagonists in the Sahelian conflict: the people represented by their rural organizations, the states, and their partners in the international community (public agencies and NGOs). One major queshon springing from their own experience concerned all 130 parhcipants: how to make the Nouakchott strategy viable so that the Sahel can really get to grips with lashng and sustainable development? Restoring the ecological resources The ecology of the Sahel has been severely damaged by untrained smallholder farmers who have for years over-exploited their natural environment to ensure the survival of the ever-increasing populahon. But the damage is not, as yet, irreversible: for the most part the agricultural potential of the land could be restored or even improved and there is a wide range of proven techniques available to do this. The integration of mechanical and biological techniques is being brought on much faster than was thought possible, often with the unexpected support of the local populahon. Cactus can be used to fix dunes but they should be planted close together to prevent damage frorn animals. Senegal has had notable success in fixing coastal dunes with plantations of 'filao' (casuarina equisetifolia) and 'n'guere' (Guiera senegalensis) as wind-breaks; the Mauritanian experience in fixing inland dunes (by mechanical and biological means) is an example to other Sahelian countries; and Cape Verde is skilled in collecting and storing rainwater. But the campaign against the onward march of the desert also means limiting flashflood erosion by means of gullying, and reclaiming land which has been lost to cultivation. In Burkina Faso the filtration dykes built in the Rissiam region have caused an increase in water infiltrahon upstream, with deposits of sand, clay and organic debris. These methods may well preserve the environment, but it should be remembered what villagers want above all is to increase agricultural produchon. More food is their primary need. To achieve this the resources of both water and soil must be maximized - and the ultimate success of any operation depends on this. The extent of adoption of any method will be determined by the degree to which it achieves immediate results. At Tademy in Mali the construction of small dykes with stone overflow spillways and a small dam of gabions to top up the groundwater level has helped water lie in places it has not before. The farmers who have settled here have managed to produce 300 kg/ ha of millet on land never before cultivated and yields like this have galvanized the people into achon. But this is not a major victory: it is only the first stage of a programme to restore the ecological resources. Listening to the village communities It is not the techniques themselves which cause delays and problems but the way they are adopted by the local populahon and by the relationships with outside aid agencies. A good technique usually requires a lot of commitment to get it off the ground, and this can jeopardize existing produchon systems. Many projects have failed because they have not won over the people concerned. In Noogo, Yatenga, in Burkina Faso villagers made piles of stones to show how willing they were to build dyke walls, but then FEER (Fonds de l'Eau et de ['Equipment Rural/ Rural Water and Facilities Fund) arrived and built the dykes of earth. The villagers accepted this because 'if someone wants to do something for you, you don't say no', but they didn't maintain them. Fortunately this was put right during the next campaign in Noogo. However, it is skill not enough just to apply appropriate techniques and take into account the needs expressed by the villagers because the best techniques in the world will founder on lack of interest or local hostility. The success of an anti-desertification project lies in the efficiency of its organization and the motivation of the community involved. Training technicians and funding agencies should not see the village solely as some sort of useful focal point which happens to have a chief and an organizing president, but must take note of its way of working and its dynamics. Now development institutions are slowly changing their approach: GRID did a survey of eight villages in the Maradi department of Niger to find out more on both agro-pastoral production capacity, and the organizational abilities of the local communities. In Ranawa, a village on the Mossi plateau, new techniques coupled with efficient village organization have put the village back on its feet again - though the annual rainfall has dropped from 800 to 500 mm during the past 20 years and the population has continued to grow, despite seasonal emigration. The Patenga Agroforestry Project (PAF) in collaboration with the Water and Forests Department has managed to persuade the local communities to construct stone dykes which follow the <b>contour</b> levels, to <b>plant</b> trees for fruit and forage, and adopt the ageold 'zai' method (shallow basins for water dug into the hillsides). All of this was carried out by the smallholders and their families who formed a Revolutionary Village Group (GVR). But in Ranawa, which is considered to be an active village, too many organizations want to take part without any common plan of action. Now a management committee to deal with the improvements has been formed within the GVR - on the suggestion of PAF. It has initiated a cereals rota fund, from which any individual or group can borrow cereals when they wish to undertake anti-erosion measures. Regular repayments have been made for four years now at harvest-time. The committee decides each year's programme taking everyone's needs into consideration Improving women's role Villagers do understand the power that these organizations give them, but they also know that they must find their own people who will take charge of them and must also resolve their internal difficulties. Ranawa's renaissance may be well on the way, but for women there are still many problems: their access to the land, water and trees is limited. All too often it is the women who 'cut too much wood and have too many children' and are blamed for the process of desertification. In fact it was the Sahelian women who were the first to be worried by it. Their lives are a long hard struggle to find enough food for tomorrow, to keep their men in the village - or get them to come back - and give their children a future. Their persistence in staying on land long abandoned by the men should prehaps give them the right to become preferential partners in any project. The campaign against desertification must aim to help the cause of women generally, not just use them as labour. The failure of the great shemes for dyke construction where women worked in return for food aid illustrates the fact that if women are not consulted at the planning stage, the projects will not be maintained. These programmes have focused attention on the problem of land ownership for women - the right to reclaimed land and to the trees planted there. Frequently the ownership of the land is not clearly defined: modern law and traditional law are often found operating side-by-side, though they say different things. A clarification is needed of the legislation which would bring together both the legislators and those affected. Any undertaking that seeks to exploit women's labour potential without involving them more fully risks apathy and failure. Some very recent projects (notably agroforestry) have sought to further women's socio-economic position. Before any agroforestry project can get off the ground, the women must be consulted, then their knowledge and experience and their needs can be taken into consideration. Foresters must learn to work with women. and the appointment of female forestry agents should be considered - such as the 'forest women smallholders' of the Village Wood Project in Kaya. Pushing back the desert can also be achieved by controlling population growth. Contrary to popular belief, rural women are not opposed to birth control when it works to the good of the whole community and safeguards the environment. Resistance to family planning comes from the men, and has its roots in ignorance and in the lack of modern methods of contraception among the rural populations. According to a CILSS/ Club du Sahel survey, rural women are ready to control their fertility, but still need more help to do so. Involving everyone in the dialogue Even with the willing and informed participation of local communities, both male and female, these projects would still not be enough to stop the onward march of the desert. Outside aid, both financial and technical, is vital, because on its own voluntary work is too limited. This is an opportunity for funding agencies and agricultural training organizations to learn the lessons of past failures and work out new ways of tackling the problems in cooperation with smallholder organizations. Smallholders themselves look for quick profit since for their livelihoods it is a queshon of survival but the restorahon of the land needs longterm investment. Incentives - from gifts of wheelbarrows to income support schemes - should give the farmers the necessary encouragement to support the projects. Does all this mean the reintroduchon of onerous rural credit schemes? Smallholders need cheap credit spread over a long period - which is just what states in financial crisis cannot provide. State support for savings and credit schemes through rural organizations would help to reduce intermediary costs and to introduce less onerous credit schemes. One of the most innovatory experiments is the Village Development Fund in the Segou, started by IFAD in 1984 (See Speakers Corner, Spore No. 21). Those villages in this northern part of Mali which are willing to work have created a Village Savings Pund and a Village Credit Committee. The constituhon of a collective savings fund deposited in the Banque Nationale de Developpememt Agricole determines how credit is granted. At the end of 1987 the total savings deposited by the 85 participahng villages was considerably greater than one million francs CFA per village, and all loans have been repaid to the BNDA This project, which must not necessarily be taken as representative, illustrates the dynamism of communities determined to win this life- and-death battle against the desert. During the regional meeting in Segou the participants did not agree on all points - far from it - but each one gained greater awareness of the potential and the limitations of his partners. A three-way dialogue was established, which was sometimes difficult but always rewarding. In view of past experiences it was certainly necessary. None of the three great 'families' of rural development (rural organizations, the states concerned, and funding agencies) could by itself mobilize a sustainable campaign against the desertification of the Sahel. An old Mossi proverb puts it well: 'You can't pick up rice off the mat with one hand. 'For nearly 20 years the Sahel has been suffering terrible drought. Despite many projects and heavy investment, the desert continues its inexorable advance on agricultural land, {{and seems to be}} invincible. Recently Segou in Mali was the venue for [...] ...|$|R
