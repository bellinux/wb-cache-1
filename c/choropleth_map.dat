30|$|Classification also {{turns out}} to be problematic. A typical means of showing data by the {{classification}} of categories are <b>choropleth</b> <b>maps,</b> where areas are shaded in relation to the classified statistical measure, for example, population density. <b>Choropleth</b> <b>maps</b> are often used in inappropriate applications; class breaks are artificial separations that can be manipulated to yield <b>choropleth</b> <b>maps</b> supporting (politically) divergent interpretations. Existing alternatives to classic <b>choropleth</b> <b>maps</b> include cartography of ratios, proportions, and visualization of reference values (Madelin et al. 2009).|$|R
50|$|<b>Choropleth</b> <b>mapping</b> is {{commonly}} used to show data for counties, states, or other enumeration units. Data collected for <b>choropleth</b> <b>maps</b> is usually grouped into separate classes based on attributes {{or other forms of}} classification. The classes are given a specific color or shading based on their values and what they are trying to portray. <b>Choropleth</b> <b>maps</b> are most effective when the data or classes change abruptly at each enumerated boundary.|$|R

50|$|Isopleth maps use isolines {{that connect}} points of equal values. A {{good example of}} isolines is {{connecting}} areas with similar temperatures. As with <b>choropleth</b> <b>maps,</b> Isopleth maps require standardized data to be appropriately contoured.|$|R
30|$|Summary {{displays}} are {{an alternative}} to ensemble displays and are suggested to be easier and more effective for users to understand. Work in cartography argues that <b>choropleth</b> <b>maps,</b> which are color encodings of summary statistics such as the average value over a region, are more comprehensible than displaying all of the individual data values (Harrower & Brewer, 2003; Watson, 2013). Michael Dobson argued that the summarization in <b>choropleth</b> <b>maps</b> decreases mental workload and time to perform tasks while improving control of information presentation and pattern recognition (Dobson, 1973, 1980). Beyond <b>choropleth</b> <b>maps,</b> summarization techniques have been developed that can encode advanced summary statistics, such as quartiles, outlier data, and task-relevant features, in ensemble datasets (Mirzargar, Whitaker, & Kirby, 2014; Whitaker et al., 2013).|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Regionally {{partitioned}} {{health indicator}} values are commonly presented in <b>choropleth</b> <b>maps.</b> Policymakers and health authorities use them among others for health reporting, demand planning and quality assessment. Quite often {{there are concerns}} whether the health situation in certain areas can be considered different or equivalent to a reference value. Results Highlighting statistically significant areas enables the statement that these areas differ from the reference value. However, this approach does not allow conclusions which areas are sufficiently close to the reference value, although these are crucial for health policy making as well. In order to overcome this weakness a combined integration of statistical difference and equivalence tests into <b>choropleth</b> <b>maps</b> is suggested and the approach is exemplified with health data of Austrian newborns. Conclusions The suggested method will improve the interpretability of <b>choropleth</b> <b>maps</b> for policymakers and health authorities. </p...|$|R

50|$|A {{proportional}} symbol map {{is better}} than <b>choropleth</b> <b>maps</b> for showing raw data totals. A proportional symbols map uses symbols that are proportional the data that they are representing with point locations. These symbols can be true points or conceptual points. True points represent real objects or {{the exact location of}} a tangible object. This could be an oil well or fire hydrant. A conceptual point represents the center of the enumeration unit, such as a corn field. The raw data on proportional symbol maps go {{hand in hand with the}} data shown on <b>choropleth</b> <b>maps.</b>|$|R
50|$|Color is a {{very useful}} {{attribute}} to depict different features on a map. Typical uses of color include displaying different political divisions, different elevations, or different kinds of roads. A <b>choropleth</b> <b>map</b> is a thematic map in which areas are colored differently to show the measurement of a statistical variable being displayed on the map. The <b>choropleth</b> <b>map</b> provides {{an easy way to}} visualize how a measurement varies across a geographic area or it shows the level of variability within a region.|$|E

5000|$|A dasymetric map is an {{alternative}} to a <b>choropleth</b> <b>map.</b> As with a <b>choropleth</b> <b>map,</b> data are collected by enumeration units. But instead of mapping the data so that the region appears uniform, ancillary information is used to model internal distribution of the phenomenon. For example, population density will be much lower in forested area than urbanized area, so in a common operation, land cover data (forest, water, grassland, urbanization) {{may be used to}} model the distribution of population reported by census enumeration unit such as a tract or county.|$|E
40|$|Geographically {{weighted}} regression (GWR) {{is a local}} spatial statistical technique for exploring spatial nonstationarity. Previous approaches to mapping the results of GWR have primarily employed an equal step classification and sequential no-hue colour scheme for <b>choropleth</b> <b>mapping</b> of parameter estimates. This cartographic approach may hinder the exploration of spatial nonstationarity by inadequately illustrating the spatial distribution of the sign, magnitude, and significance {{of the influence of}} each explanatory variable on the dependent variable. Approaches for improving mapping of the results of GWR are illustrated using a case study analysis of population density–median home value relationships in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA. These approaches employ data classification schemes informed by the (nonspatial) data distribution, diverging colour schemes, and bivariate <b>choropleth</b> <b>mapping...</b>|$|R

50|$|Choropleth {{maps are}} {{sometimes}} incorrectly {{referred to as}} heat maps.

40|$|Mapping {{survey data}} {{has become an}} {{increasingly}} important means of displaying survey information and highlighting differences across geographic areas. In public health, geospatial data are used by policy-makers, researchers, and other health professionals to identify and address issues of public health concern. Traditionally, geospatial data are presented in <b>choropleth</b> <b>maps,</b> where defined geographic units (i. e., political boundaries) are filled with a uniform color or pattern. Such maps are appropriate for data that have been scaled or normalized. For example, high school graduation rates displayed by county are typically represented using <b>choropleth</b> <b>maps.</b> Alternatively, geospatial data can be displayed using isopleth maps, in which the data are not aggregated to pre-defined geographic units, but rather are typically smoothed across adjacent geographic boundaries. There is little empirical research, however, on the differential effectiveness of <b>choropleth</b> versus isopleth <b>maps.</b> In particular, how do these two different mapping techniques affect the users ability to extract information from the map?

50|$|A <b>choropleth</b> <b>map</b> (from Greek χῶρος ("area/region") + πλῆθος ("multitude")) is a {{thematic}} map in which areas are shaded or patterned {{in proportion to}} the measurement of the statistical variable being displayed on the map, such as population density or per-capita income.

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{describes}} {{the design and}} implementation of PerspectiveView, a web-based application for visualizing temporal geospatial datasets and their correlations. Building {{on top of the}} existing geovisualization tool, AmMap, perspectiveView integrates bimodal control mechanisms that allow the user to alter the <b>choropleth</b> <b>mapping</b> of multiple sets of data on the world map dynamically using novel interaction combinations. The application determines the set of geospatial data to display based on the user’s head position detected through a web camera; by shifting the head from left to right, the user selects between viewing two different datasets or their correlation values on the map. The application also implements a dynamic cross map and timeline control, allowing the user to identify any spatial trends that exist in the datasets at the same time. Combining data selection using headcoupled interaction and theasholds and time adjustment using the mouse simultaneously offer a interesting two-way control that engage the user into using the application and understanding the geospatial data.
