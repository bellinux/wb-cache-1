Marshall Porterfield, Zengkai Zhang, Wenjun Wang, Yue (Jeff) Xu & Jinxing Lin ### Abstract This {{protocol}} {{describes an}} {{integration of the}} Non-invasive Micro-test Technique and Oxygen Optrode (NMT-OO) to quantify rhizosphere oxygen fluxes in Arabidopsis. The optrode has high sensitivity and selectivity in the measurement of oxygen concentrations and fluxes at the cellular level. In particular, application of the NMT-OO using the self-referencing method avoids environmental electromagnetic noise and hysteresis/calibration drift, providing extremely high signal-to-noise ratios for measuring biophysical transport. We successfully applied this technique to measure rhizosphere oxygen fluxes and metabolism in intact roots of Arabidopsis plants. The system we describe here is a simple and reliable method for measuring oxygen fluxes in plants and has other broad applications in cytological studies. ### Introduction Oxygen {{is one of the}} most fundamental elements for animals, plants, fungi, and bacterial systems. Real-time measurement of oxygen concentration, transport, and respiration in living cells is crucial to answering physiological questions of development, metabolism, and stress response. There have been significant efforts to measure oxygen transport and metabolism in living cells and tissues (1, 2, 3, 4). Early efforts were based on polarograghic electrochemical approaches where a current is measured as a function of oxygen reduction. These electrode-based methods all face limitations because of susceptibility to electromagnetic interference, convective artifacts, and calibration drift, which create high background noise 5 and a requirement for constant recalibration. It is possible to partially alleviate convective artifacts from the electrode-based methods by reducing the diameter of an electrode and covering the electrode by a gas-permeable membrane (5) but this in turn increases the susceptibility to electromagnetic noise. The self-referencing technique can provide a reliable solution to measuring the analytes flux associated with living cells. To monitor oxygen flux and respiratory activity in single cells or/and tissues, microelectrode-based electrochemical polarographic methods were adapted in the last decade (3, 6, 7, 8). However, the electrochemical microelectrode approach still suffered from experimental artifacts when high sensitivity and accuracy of measurement are required because the electrode sensitivity to electromagnetic noise, fouling, and calibration drift. Therefore, an optical sensor, the so-called optrode (optical electrode), was developed to minimize these disadvantage (9, 10, 11, 12). An optrode is an optical fiber with a specific fluorescence dye (platinum tetrakis pentafluorophenyl porphyrin or PtTFPP in this study), immobilized on the tip of a tapered fiber optic 10. The PtTFPP is excited by blue light (505 nm), and the red emission fluorescence signal (640 nm) is conducted through the fiber and recorded by optical equipment. The concentration of analytes, oxygen in this case, changes the lifetime and intensity of the fluorescence signals (9, 10). These measurable characters of fluorescence signals reflect the concentration of the analyte in a linear relationship (Box 1). The application of an optical fiber prevents corrosion of metallic probes in buffers or physiologic solutions, and the recording of light signals minimizes electromagnetic noise. Furthermore, the measurement of fluorescence duration has significant advantages over measurement of fluorescence intensity, in terms of stability and photobleaching of fluorescence dyes (9, 10). Based on applying the principles of frequency domain lifetime approaches, shifts in the phase angle of fluorescence signals are measured for the NMT-OO system. The NMT can provide non-invasive measurement of the flux of analytes in living cells and tissues. Based on Fick’s law, *we can calculate the flux rate by measuring concentration differences using a microsensor, which oscillates between two positions (ΔX) *, if the diffusion coefficient (*D*) is known (10). In the current study, we used a newly developed oxygen-specific optrode with high sensitivity and a high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Furthermore, when using an optrode with NMS, there is no need to use a reference electrode, and thus the system is simple to construct. This construction helps in decreasing experimental artifacts and errors (Box 2). The oxygen transport and respiratory activity of plant cell tissues reflect spatial and temporal information about the physiological responses of cell metabolism and stress responses (11). Here we compared oxygen metabolism and flux rate on the root surface of wild-type (WT) Arabidopsis and mutant lines of the atrbohD/F double mutant, which lacks the expression of membrane-localized NADPH-oxidase, resulting in a reduced rate of root elongation by inhibition of cell expansion and growth (13, 14). We also compared rhizosphere oxygen flux rate in light- and dark-grown Arabidopsis seedlings, which show different elongation rates in the elongation zone (15). These results documented differences in respiratory oxygen flux that correlate with root growth, and confirm the NMT-OO approach as a low-cost, easy-to-use instrument for detecting oxygen transport and metabolism with high sensitivity and a high SNR. The following is a detailed protocol for the complete construction of this optrode-based NMT and measurement of rhizosphere oxygen flux in Arabidopsis seedlings. ### Reagents 1. ½ Murashige and Skoog (½MS) medium (Sigma-Aldrich) with 0. 4 % phytagel (Sigma-Aldrich) containing 1 % sucrose for dark-grown seedlings. Caution! Autoclave after combining to avoid contamination. - ½ MS liquid medium. Caution! The liquid medium contains the same components as the solid medium without phytagel to avoid additional stress. Critical! Wash the optrode with distilled water very carefully, avoiding crystallization of salts and contamination from sucrose. - Calibration medium: ½ MS medium bubbled with pure N 2 (0 % O 2) or air (21 % O 2) in an Erlenmeyer flask, or other kind of container with a narrow neck. Caution! N 2 bubbling should last at least 30 minutes to completely expel the oxygen from the medium. ### Equipment 1. Light-emitting diode (LED) : A LED lamp provides blue light (403 – 405 nm) to excite the fluorescence dye immobilized on the tip of the optrode. - LED power: An amplifier can provide stable voltage signals to the LED light source. In our equipment, we used the SRS 530 amplifier (SRS, USA) as the power supplier. - Laser coupler: A band-pass optical filter (Edmund Optics, USA) prevents nonspecific light reaching the fluorescent dye on the optrode tip. The emitted fluorescent light from the optrode is in the red color range, and thus a red color filter (Edmund Optics) was used in the light path to obtain pure fluorescence signals. LED, LED Power and Laser Coupler were installed by ScienceWares, Inc., MA. - MicroTip-Fiber Optic Oxygen Sensor, World Precision Instruments; Cat. Number 501656 : The fiber sensor is 140 µm long tapering to a sharp sensor tip with a diameter of 50 µm housed inside a steel needle ([URL] Alternatively, the company Ocean Optics Sensors (USA) also provides optical microsensors. (See [URL] Critical! Two types of optrodes are on the market, a tapered tip and flat-broken tip microsensor. The tapered tip optrode provides higher spatial and temporal resolution, while the flat-broken tip optrode has higher light stability. - Optical fiber: Optical fibers guide the light path in this optrode system. No special requirement for the fibers. - Photomultiplier tube (PMT) : The PMT is a special electron tube that can transduct the weak light signals into measureable electric signals via application of the photoelectric effect and secondary emission ability of electrons. A current type of photomultiplier consists of a photoemissive cathode (sensitive to even a single photon) followed by an electron multiplier (in high vacuum) and an electron collector (anode). Several companies provide PMT devices with high sensitivity and high SNR. We combined a PMT (Hamamatsu, Japan) into our system. - PMT power: To obtain constant application and measurement with the PMT, a high voltage power supply is integrated into the system (Optical Signal Processor, YGOO-OSP; YoungerUSA). - Optical device: Any kind of microscope is suitable for the this approach but inverted microscopes are easier to adapt for observation. We used the Olympus IMT 2 microscope in our study. An objective lens with 10 × or 20 × magnification is good for observation. Critical! Water/oil immersion lenses have not been tried out for this experiment. - Non-invasive Micro-test System: The system (BIO-IM, YoungerUSA, US) was constructed as originally descriptions (16, 17). The optrode is moved by a three-dimensional stepper motor (YGOO-LTS，YoungerUSA，USA), that has submicron step resolution. For flux measurements the typical distance is 10 μm. A lock-in amplifier (SR 530 ，SRS，USA) amplifier analyzes the phase angle associated with the fluorescent lifetime of the dye using frequency domain analysis approaches. - Calibration and recording chamber: A small Petri-dish of 5 cm diameter was chosen as a calibration chamber for optrodes and recording experiments. Any transparent container can be used as the chamber. Critical! The edge of the chamber should not be so high as to prevent the microsensor from reaching the samples, and the bottom of the chamber can be specially treated to avoid interfere with microscopic observation. ### Procedure **EQUIPMENT SETUP** Figure 2 shows the schematic diagram of the NMT-OO system in our study. The software, imFLUX (YoungeUSA), controls several basic components of this system by adjusting the power supply, imaging with a digital camera, and managing the main component: the optrodes. The following describes the construction of the measuring system: A LED power supplier controls the voltage signal to a blue LED (503 – 505 nm). A 20 × microscope (Newport, USA) objective focuses light from the LED onto the optical fiber, which is coupled to a blue filter leading the excitation light to the MicroTip-Fiber Optic Oxygen Sensor (World Precision Instruments, USA). Fluorescence emission is conducted by the fibers and split by the fiber coupler again. When the red fluorescence signal reaches the PMT (Hamamatsu, Japan), the signals are transformed into electrical signals and conducted into a Lock-in-Amplifier (SRS 530). Then, the phase shift and fluorescence intensities are recorded by the computer and analyzed by imFLUX (YoungerUSA，USA). **PROCEDURE** Experimental measurements 1. Calibration of the optrode: We calibrated the optrode in the <b>calibration</b> <b>medium</b> with two different concentrations of oxygen (0 and 21 % oxygen). The phase angles of the fluorescence signals of these two concentrations were measured and a linear slope was calculated. ? TROUBLESHOOTING - Equilibration of plant material: The 4 -day-old seedlings were dipped into the measuring buffer (½ MS liquid medium) for 30 minutes before measuring. - Immobilizing the plant material: The measurement of oxygen flux with the optrode occurs in an aqueous environment; therefore, we needed to immobilize the sample to avoiding unwanted stirring, and movement. The method used to immobilize the sample must be gentle enough to prevent mechanical damage to the tissues and allow free access of the optrode to measure the tissue. As shown in Figure 3 a, we used two small pieces of filter paper to clamp the root of Arabidopsis, leaving about 2 – 3 mm of the root tip free for microsensor measurement. ? TROUBLESHOOTING - Adjusting the measuring position of the optrode by a stepper motor: Caution! The tip of the optrode sensor is fragile. Move the optrode gently to avoid breaking the tip. - At each measuring point, the optrode is vibrating between two positions at a distance of 30 μm (Figure 3 a). We set an optimal vibration frequency to avoid stirring and to obtain stable results with 2 seconds of quiet time before measuring and 1. 92 seconds of measurement at each position in our experiments. Thus, time of measurement at each position is 8. 6 seconds at each measuring point. ? TROUBLESHOOTING - Start the measurement with a reference measure by placing the optrode in a background place, i. e., in the medium as far away from the sample as possible (Figure 3 b). When the base level of oxygen flux in the environment is steady at a baseline, move the tip of the optrode to a position near (5 μm) the periphery of the sample root (Figure 3 b). Measurement of oxygen flux in the background position and the rhizophere of Arabidopsis are shown in Figure 3 c. - Based on the aim of the experiment, we can adjust control probe positioning and angle of oscillation. As shown in Figure 4 a, we mapped the oxygen flux rate on the periphery of the root apical region in Arabidopsis. We also analyzed the effect of hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2) on the oxygen flux rate as shown in Figure 4 b. ### Timing - Steps 1 and 2 : 30 minutes to select an optimal vibration frequency and phase angle for measurement. - Step 3 : Equilibration requires 30 minutes. We can perform this step at the same time as steps 1 and 2. - Step 4 : 5 minutes - Step 5 : 20 minutes. - Steps 6 – 7 : 30 – 45 minutes for a single experiment. ### Troubleshooting Step 1 : - Problem: Large differences in empirical values; - Possible reasons: 1. The <b>calibration</b> <b>medium</b> was not bubbled enough. - 2. Contamination or inactivation at the optrode sensor tip. - Solution: 1. Bubble the medium with N 2 or air for a longer time. - 2. Clean the optrode or use a new one. Step 3 : - Problem: Roots are moving during the measurement. - Possible reasons: The access tip region is too long. - Solution: Leave only 2 – 3 mm of the root tip free. Step 5 : - Problem: Unsettled results. - Possible reasons: 1. The optrode is not fixed properly on the stepper motor. - 2. The quiet time for measurement is too short. - Solution: 1. Fix it tightly. - 2. Prolong the quiet time to avoid possible stirring effects. ### Anticipated Results Roots are heterotrophic tissues in plant bodies, taking up oxygen from the environment for growth and metabolism. The rhizosphere oxygen flux results in a net influx value in experiments (Figure 2 C). As shown in Figure 3 A, the peak oxygen influx value occurred 0. 2 mm back from the root tip, coinciding with the root apical transition zone, which has also a peak value of auxin influx and high cell elongation and development rate (18, 19 20). Lack of NADPH-oxidase results in a reduced root elongation and may alter respiratory activity at the rhizophere of the apical root elongation zone (13, 14). The oxygen influx rate is reduced significantly in the atrbohD/F double mutant (Figure 3 A). Dark-grown seedlings have a low respiratory rate and metabolism at the root meristem and elongation zone (15). Thus, the oxygen influx rate in dark-grown Arabidopsis seedlings is significantly decreased (Figure 3 A). H 2 O 2, a typical ROS signal molecule, also changes the rhizosphere oxygen flux dramatically (Figure 3 B). **CONCLUSION** In conclusion, we describe here a real-time and non-invasive probe system with highly sensitivity for detecting the oxygen flux rate in plant system. ### References 1.

The software, imFLUX, controls several basic components of this system, including adjusting the power supply, imaging with a digital camera, and managing the main component: the optrode system. We described the construction of the measuring system here: A LED power supplier controls the voltage signal to a blue LED (503 – 505 nm). An optical fiber coupled with a blue band-pass filter leads this excitation light to the MicroTip-Fiber Optic Oxygen Sensor, which has the fluorescence reporter, PtTFPP, on the micro-tip. Fluorescence emission (630 – 640 nm) is conducted by the fibers and split by the fiber coupler again. When the red fluorescence signal reaches the PMT, the signals are multiplied and transformed into electrical signals and conducted into an amplifier. Then, the phase shift and fluorescence intensities are recorded by the computer and analyzed by imFLUX*. **Figure 3 : Setting the measuring chamber and me...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Due {{to their}} high {{wavelength}} and power range, thermal detectors {{were employed in}} our measurement set-up for optical power measurements. A link between optical power <b>calibrations</b> at <b>medium</b> power levels and our primary standard cryogenic radiometer was established by means of transfer standards. Analysis of the set-up and characterization of our working standard thermal detectors to yield uncertainty budget is presented in this study. Detector Based Measurements As the needs and applications of optical measurements increase, we frequently face with new radiation detectors and lasers with different structure, speed, range or beam properties. However in the calibration and measurements, commercially, {{there is no single}} suitable working standard detector available to cover all the power and optical wavelength range of interest. In our laboratory, treaceability from our Cryogenic Radiometer (Oxford Instr., Radiox) is provided by using a set of home-built 3 -element reflection type trap detectors as the transfer standards. Due to the type of silicon detectors used, those trap detectors can be used safely in 300 to 1100 nm wavelength range but only up to 3 mW incident power due to their linearity limits. The measurements at wider wavelength ranges have become possible by employing our Electrically Calibrated Pyroelectric Radiometer. But for higher power ranges, it was found out that it is not feasible to use filtered photodetectors due to the heating effects, nonhomogeneity of the filter surface and strong depen- dence of the alignment and on incident angle. Therefore, we have chosen and employed thermopiles in our laser power measurement and detector calibration set-up...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The steps {{followed}} {{in the design of}} a reference resistive-capacitive divider for on-site <b>calibration</b> on the <b>medium</b> voltage grid are described. The design constraints are defined {{on the basis of the}} expected on-site conditions, rated primary and secondary voltage, insulation requirements and accuracy performances. The final set up of the divider is defined by making use of a circuital model. Both the stray parameters of the divider components and the capacitive coupling with the shield, which are estimated through finite element modelling, are included in the model. The electric field distribution between divider and shield is also estimated, taking into account the presence of the insulating medium to identify the electric field hot spots and verify the dielectric strength of the device. The variation of the divider behaviour in a frequency range from power frequency to 100 kHz is found to be within 200 ppm and 2 mrad for the ratio and phase displacement, so making feasible the extension of its use over a quite wide frequency range both as a reference or a measuring transducer...|$|R

In this study, Regression Tree (RT) algorithm was used to estimate percent tree cover maps. This technique is well suited for percentage tree cover mapping because, as a non-parametric classifier, it requires no prior assumptions about the distribution of the training data. This model also allows for the calibration of the model along the entire continuum of tree cover, avoiding the problems of using only end members for <b>calibration.</b> The <b>medium</b> resolution Envisat MERIS with a 300 m and MODIS with a 500 m pixel representation data were used as predictor variables. Three scenes of high resolution IKONOS images were employed as a training data, and testing the accuracy of model. The regression tree method for this study consisted of six steps: i) generate reference percentage tree cover data, ii) derive metrics from Envisat MERIS and MODIS data, iii) select predictor variables, iv) fit RT model, v) undertake accuracy assessment and produce final model and map, vi) compare results. The training data set was derived supervised land cover classification of IKONOS imagery to generate reference percent tree cover data. Specifically, this classification was aggregated to estimate percent tree cover at the MERIS and MODIS spatial resolution. The predictor variables incorporated the MERIS and MODIS wavebands in addition to biophysical variables estimated from the MERIS and MODIS data. Percent tree cover maps were derived from MERIS and MODIS data for Seyhan upper Basin as final outputs. These final outputs consisted of spatially distributed estimates of percent tree cover at 300 m and 500 m spatial resolution and erro...|$|R

Unlike the existing studies, we consider the possibility of the price puzzle when agent expectations are based on adaptive learning and three monetary policy alternatives (the optimal monetary policy, money growth targeting, and a Calvo-type policy rule) are available to the central bank. Furthermore, we use two alternative measures of inflation. <b>Calibration</b> of our <b>medium</b> scale model, using plausible parameter values, reveals that irrespective of how the inflation rate is measured and the policy rule used by the central bank, the puzzle fades away when a sufficiently strong exchange rate pass through is present in the economy.

40|$|The {{in-flight}} radiometric <b>calibration</b> of the <b>MEdium</b> Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS) {{instrument is}} checked using a vicarious calibration approach. Cloud-free in-situ measurements from the SIMBADA radiometer {{in the open}} ocean are used as input data into a Radiative Transfer Equation (RTE) code to simulate the Top Of the Atmosphere (TOA) radiance. That radiance is then compared to the one measured by MERIS and a calibration correction factor is derived. The method {{has been applied to}} the MERIS data available by the end of November 2002 and preliminary results using seven match-ups are presented. They show excellent agreement with standard in-flight calibration. However, more match-ups are needed in order to confirm those preliminary results and to analyse differences between the five cameras or the time degradation of the sensors. 1. CALIBRATION METHOD The method has been detailed in [1]. It differs from other methods like the one applied to SeaWiFS [2] in the way that it does not rely on any hypothesis on atmosphere characteristics or on the atmospheric correction scheme applied for level 2 computation.

It {{is a measure of}} the ionization produced in air by X-rays or gamma radiation and it is used because air ionization can be measured directly.It is named after the German physicist Wilhelm Röntgen, who discovered X-rays. Originating in 1908, this unit has been redefined and renamed over the years. It was last defined by the US National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in 1998 as 2.58&times;10&minus;4 C/kg, (i.e. 1 C/kg = 3876 R) with a recommendation that the definition be given in every document where the roentgen is used. One roentgen of air kerma (kinetic energy released per unit mass) deposits [...] of absorbed dose in dry air, or [...] in soft tissue. One roentgen (air kerma) of X-rays may deposit anywhere from [...] in bone depending on the beam energy. [...] This tissue-dependent conversion from kerma to absorbed dose is called the F-factor in radiotherapy contexts. The conversion depends on the ionizing energy of a reference medium, which is ambiguous in the latest NIST definition.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} the calibration {{of the two}} solid-state Si(Li) X-ray detectors and the X-ray telescopes that flew as part of Goddard Space Flight Center's Broad Band X-Ray Telescope (BBXRT) experiment on board the space shuttle Columbia in 1990 December. During the 9 day shuttle mission, BBXRT performed approximately 150 observations of 82 celestial sources. The content of the archive is summarized here. Although BBXRT had a relatively short life, it stands as a milestone in X-ray astronomy as being the first instrument to offer moderate spectral resolution over a wide bandpass (0. 3 - 12. 0 keV). Among other things, this paper discusses the effective area calibration of the instrument, the flux calibration and flux corrections for off-axis observations, the detector background, and optimal background subtraction techniques. The on-axis effective area calibration for the central detector elements was performed {{using data from the}} Crab Nebula, while other carefully selected targets were used for calibration of the outer detector elements. The remaining systematic uncertainties in the effective area calibration for point sources observed both on and off axis are generally less than 5 %- 10 %. The energy scale is known to better than 0. 5 % at 6. 0 keV for both detectors. The results presented here {{have an impact on the}} <b>calibration</b> of other <b>medium</b> resolution X-ray experiments such as the CCDs on board ASCA (Astro-D) as well as the Advanced X-Ray Astrophysics Facility detectors...|$|R
40|$|The {{reproductive}} performance of cattle {{may be influenced}} by several factors, but mineral imbalances are crucial in terms of direct effects on reproduction. Several studies have shown that elements such as calcium, copper, iron, magnesium, selenium, and zinc are essential for reproduction and can prevent oxidative stress. However, toxic elements such as lead, nickel, and arsenic can have adverse effects on reproduction. In this paper, we applied a simple and fast method of multi-element analysis to bovine semen samples from Zebu and European classes used in reproduction programs and artificial insemination. Samples were analyzed by inductively coupled plasma spectrometry (ICP-MS) using aqueous <b>medium</b> <b>calibration</b> and the samples were diluted in a proportion of 1 : 50 in a solution containing 0. 01 % (vol/vol) Triton X- 100 and 0. 5 % (vol/vol) nitric acid. Rhodium, iridium, and yttrium were used as the internal standards for ICP-MS analysis. To develop a reliable method of tracing the class of bovine semen, we used data mining techniques that make it possible to classify unknown samples after checking the differentiation of known-class samples. Based on the determination of 15 elements in 41 samples of bovine semen, 3 machine-learning tools for classification were applied to determine cattle class. Our results demonstrate the potential of support vector machine (SVM), multilayer perceptron (MLP), and random forest (RF) chemometric tools to identify cattle class. Moreover, the selection tools made it possible {{to reduce the number of}} chemical elements needed from 15 to just 8.

40|$|Significant {{financial}} {{investments are}} made in the offshore wind energy, in a race to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The trend is to install larger capacity wind turbines in deeper waters, further from shore. DTI (2001) states that 30 % of this investment is represented by the foundation costs. Senders (2008) and Byrne & Houlsby (2003) found suction caisson foundations within a multi-footing configuration to be a viable and more economically attractive solution. But, the available norms and standards provide insufficient guidance. It is the aim of this dissertation to provide an additional method to investigate the long term performance of these foundations for their usage as footings for large (6 MW) offshore wind turbines, embedded in sandy soil conditions. Literature revealed significant research being undertaken to better understand the cyclic performance of different foundation types. Three main model types have been found: empirical (does not assess each individual cycle), constitutive (assess each individual cycle) and hybrid (a combination of the first two). The hypoplastic sand model with intergranular strain concept is employed, based on its ability to accurately assess the two main effects of cyclic loading on sand: pore pressure and strain accumulation, provided that a correct calibration is done. This research looks at the usage of a centric three-leg jacket for an offshore wind turbine, located in the North Sea, with a soil profile characterised by medium dense sand. It is shown that suction caissons present a large advantage in lateral resistance. Due to their increased diameter, the problem is reduced to the assessment of vertical cyclic resistance, confirming the theory that multi-footings take the loads through a “push-pull” system. The loading conditions, defined by vertical mean load and cyclic amplitude, found within a certain range of the caisson capacity, produce no significant strain or pore pressure accumulation. The behaviour within the elliptically shaped boundary is dominantly hypoelastic. Outside of the boundary, hypoplastic strains and pore pressure build-up occur, with consequent strength and stiffness degradation. Due to insufficient data for the <b>calibration</b> of the <b>medium</b> dense sand soil volume, an overestimation of the pore pressure occurs. Thus, no conclusion may be drawn regarding the behaviour outside of the defined boundary. Nonetheless, this boundary is conservatively constructed based on the chosen type of soil, medium dense sand that is more prone to pore pressure build-up than the denser sands found in-situ. The period of application of the load is conservatively chosen to be equal to the wave period, regardless of the observed larger values, closer to the wind period, which would allow for more consolidation time. This research provides a basis for the design of suction caisson foundations for offshore wind turbines. It provides a tool for the identification of loading conditions that are potentially dangerous for the long term performance of these foundations embedded in sand and subjected to vertical cyclic loading.
