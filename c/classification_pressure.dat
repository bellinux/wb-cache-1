40|$|Introduction: The obstructive sleep apnea-hyponea {{syndrome}} (OSAHS) is {{a chronic}} and progressive disease {{with a high}} morbidity. The application of positive pressure mask in the airways, connected to a CPAP (nasal continuous positive airway pressure) is an efficient method, but with side effects relating to the mask and to the pressure. Objective: To determine the possible reduction of the CPAP pressure, {{with the use of}} a metallic intranasal dilator. Method: We carried out a multicentric prospective study of 15 patients, from November 2003 through June 2006, with patients using CPAP, divided into two groups: 10 with adhesion problems and five without adhesion problems, all examined for inclusion. We performed another polissonography for classification of the pressure with the use of the intranasal dilator in both groups. Results: Out of 10 patients with treatment adhesion problems, all had a reduction on the <b>classification</b> <b>pressure,</b> in the polissonography made with the use of the intranasal dilator. Out of five patients without adhesion problems in two the pressure didn't change, but they mentioned the sensation of comfort improved; in two, the pressure increases; and in one the pressure decreased.

Pressure ulcer risk scales aim to support practitioners in determining individual pressure ulcer risk and in starting preventive activities.

This paper {{is a report}} of {{a study of the}} inter-observer reliability of the European Pressure Ulcer Advisory Panel <b>pressure</b> ulcer <b>classification</b> system and of the differential diagnosis between moisture lesions and pressure ulcers. Background. <b>Pressure</b> ulcer <b>classification</b> is a valuable tool to provide a common description of ulcer severity for the purposes of clinical practice, audit and research. Despite everyday use of the European Pressure Ulcer Advisory Panel system, its reliability has been evaluated in {{only a limited number of}} studies. Methods. Asurvey was carried out between September 2005 and February 2006 with a convenience sample of 1452 nurses from five European countries. Respondents classified 20 validated photographs as normal skin, blanchable erythema, pressure ulcers (four grades), moisture lesion or combined lesion. The nurses were familiar with the use of the European Pressure Ulcer Advisory Panel <b>classification</b> scale. Results. <b>Pressure</b> ulcers were often classified erroneously (j = 0 Æ 33) and only a minority of nurses reached a substantial level of agreement. Grade 3 lesions were regularly classified as grade 2. Non-blanchable erythema was frequently assessed incorrectly as blanchable erythema. Furthermore, the differential diagnosis between moisture lesions and pressure ulcers appeared to be complicated. Conclusion. Inter-observer reliability of the European Pressure Ulcer Advisory Panel classification system was low. Evaluation thus needs to focus on both the clarity and complexity of the system. Definitions and unambiguous descriptions of pressure ulcer grades and the distinction between moisture lesions will probably enhance clarity.

This work evaluates {{the performance of}} this new design, considering pressure drop, Δp, and quality of fluidization. Bed fluidization was easily achieved with the proposed device, improving the solid mixing {{and the quality of}} fluidization. In order to examine the effect of the rotational speed of the distributor plate on the hydrodynamic behavior of the bed, minimum fluidization velocity, Umf, and pressure fluctuations were analyzed. Experiments were conducted in the bubbling free regime in a 0. 19 m i. d. fluidized bed, operating with Group B particles according to Geldart's <b>classification.</b> The <b>pressure</b> drop across the bed and the standard deviation of pressure fluctuations, σp, were used to find the minimum fluidization velocity, Umf. A decrease in Umf is observed when the rotational speed increases and a rise in the measured pressure drop was also found. Frequency analysis of pressure fluctuations shows that fluidization can be controlled by the adjustable rotational speed, at several excess gas velocities. Measurements with several initial static bed heights were taken, in order to analyze the influence of the initial bed mass inventory, over the effect of the distributor rotation on the bed hydrodynamics.

40|$|Abstract—A textile {{pressure}} sensor {{has been designed}} for mea-suring pressure distribution on the human body. Electrodes built with conductive textiles are arranged {{on both sides of}} a compress-ible spacer, forming a variable capacitor. The use of textiles makes unobtrusive, comfortable, lightweight, and washable sensors pos-sible. This simplifies the goal to integrate such sensors into clothing in the future, to be simple, and fast to mount just as getting dressed. Hysteresis induced by the spacer of the sensor has been modeled with the Preisach model to reduce the measurement error from 24 % to 5 % on average and the maximal error from above 50 % to below 10 %. Standard textiles that are not specially optimized for low hysteresis can be used for designing the sensor due to the modeling. The model may also be used for other pressure or even strain sensors to reduce their hysteresis. The modeling enhances the accuracy of the textile sensor to those of commercial, nontextile pressure sensing mats. Furthermore, we used the sensor system for the classification of sitting postures in a chair. The data of nine subjects have been clas-sified with Naïve Bayes classifier, achieving an average recognition rate of 82 %. We show that the textile sensor performs similarly to a commercial, nontextile pressure sensing mat for this application.

This can pose a hurdle for their development and clinical use. Radiopharmaceuticals are fundamentally different from other medicinal products and these regulations are not always adequate for their production. Strict compliance may have a huge resource impact, without further improving product quality. In this paper we give {{an overview of the}} applicable legislation and guidelines and propose a risk-based approach for their implementation. We focus on a few controversial Good Manufacturing Practice topics: cleanroom <b>classification,</b> air <b>pressure</b> regime, cleanroom qualification and microbiological monitoring. We have developed an algorithm to assess the combined risk of microbiological contamination of a radiopharmaceutical preparation process and propose corresponding Good Manufacturing Practice classification levels. In our opinion, the risk of carry-over of radiopharmaceuticals by individuals cannot be contained by pressure differences, and complicated regimes with underpressured rooms are not necessary in most situations. We propose a sterility assurance level of 10 (- 2) for radiopharmaceuticals that are administered within a working day, irrespective of their use. We suggest the adoption of limits for environmental monitoring of microbial contamination, as proposed by Bruel and colleagues, on behalf of the French Society of Radiopharmacy.

Aims: To determine whether different grades of pressure ulcers exhibit specific hues. To develop a consensus of opinion from four experts on the grade of pressure ulcers which can be compared with hue. Methods: Data was analysed from 141 patients from a previous randomised controlled trial. All grade 2 pressure ulcers and above were photographed and a computerised image analysis made to measure the hue, saturation and intensity of ulcers and the skin tone of the subject’s adjacent healthy skin. This data was analysed against two <b>classifications</b> of <b>pressure</b> ulcers — the National Pressure Ulcer Advisory Panel and Stirling plus digits — and a consensus panel of experts. Results: It was shown that the mean and standard deviations of the recorded HSIs could discriminate between normal skin, grade 2 a and grade 2 b pressure ulcers.
