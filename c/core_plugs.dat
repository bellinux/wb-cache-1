25|$|A {{block heater}} warms {{the engine of}} an {{automobile}} in order to ease and speed starting and vehicle warm-up in cold weather. The most common type is an electric heating element connected through a power cord often routed through the vehicle's grille. The block heater may replace one of the engine's <b>core</b> <b>plugs,</b> or may be installed in line {{with one of the}} radiator or heater hoses. The block heater, first known as a head bolt heater, was invented in 1945 by Andrew Freeman in Grand Forks, North Dakota. Freeman used some scrap hoses and copper tubing onto the heating element of an old flat-iron and produced the first headbolt heater, which warmed the engine's water jacket and the oil film between cylinder heads and pistons. U.S. patent #2,487,326 was filed on November 4, 1946 and issued to Freeman on November 8, 1949.|$|E
2500|$|Antifreeze was {{developed}} to overcome the shortcomings of water as a heat transfer fluid. In some engines freeze plugs (engine block expansion plugs) are placed {{in areas of the}} engine block where coolant flows {{in order to protect the}} engine from freeze damage [...] if the ambient temperature drops below the freezing point of the antifreeze/water mixture. These should not be confused with <b>core</b> <b>plugs,</b> whose purpose is to allow removal of sand used in the casting process of engine blocks (<b>core</b> <b>plugs</b> will be pushed out if the coolant freezes, though, assuming that they adjoin the coolant passages, which is not always the case).|$|E

50|$|The {{variation}} of wave propagation direction {{can be achieved}} by either cutting three samples at 0°, 45° and 90° from the cores or by using one <b>core</b> <b>plug</b> with transducers attached at these three angles. Since most shales are very friable and fissured, {{it is often difficult to}} cut shale <b>core</b> <b>plug.</b> Its edges break off easily. Thus the cutting sample method can only be used for hard, competent rocks. The cutting position of samples can be explained by the following diagram.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>core</b> <b>plug</b> often binds {{inside the}} hole saw, and often must be pried out after each hole is cut. Sometimes the prying is quite difficult.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Core</b> <b>plugs</b> {{can often}} {{be a source of}} leaks due to {{corrosion}} caused by cooling system water. Although modern antifreeze chemicals do not evaporate and may be considered [...] "permanent", anti-corrosion additives gradually deplete and must be replenished. Failure to do this periodic maintenance accelerates corrosion of engine parts, and the thin metal <b>core</b> <b>plugs</b> are often the first components to start leaking.|$|E

50|$|Sand cores {{are used}} to form the {{internal}} cavities when the engine block or cylinder head(s) is cast. These cavities are usually the coolant passages. Holes are designed into the casting to support internal sand forms, and to facilitate {{the removal of the}} sand after the casting has cooled. <b>Core</b> <b>plugs</b> are usually thin metal cups press fitted into the casting holes, but may be made of rubber or other materials. In some high-performance engines the <b>core</b> <b>plugs</b> are large diameter cast metal threaded pipe plugs.|$|E
50|$|Permeability is {{measured}} in the laboratory by encasing a <b>core</b> <b>plug</b> of known length and diameter in an air-tight sleeve (the Hassler Sleeve). A fluid of known viscosity is injected into the <b>core</b> <b>plug</b> while mounted in a steel chamber. The samples are either full diameter core samples that are intervals of whole core cut, typically 6 inches long, or 1-in plugs drilled from the cores. The pressure drop across the sample and the flow rate are measured and permeability is calculated using Darcy's law.|$|R
30|$|Spontaneous {{imbibition}} test acceptably simulates {{the production}} from fractured reservoirs in the tertiary oil recovery stage. In {{this type of}} experiment, the fluid in the fracture (brine around the core) penetrates into the <b>core</b> <b>plug</b> and drives the trapped oil out of the core. The fluid displacement in the Spontaneous imbibition phenomena is governed by both capillary and gravity forces. However, the small height of <b>core</b> <b>plug</b> and also the significance of capillary pressure {{in the case of}} tight rocks might lead to the capillary force as dominant mechanism, whereas the gravity force becomes negligible. Wettability alteration of pore surfaces towards water-wetness by imbibing fluid {{would be one of the}} main mechanisms that lead to the oil production from <b>core</b> <b>plug</b> during imbibition test. As above mentioned, the low-salinity water injection has been proposed to reach this purpose (Tang and Morrow 1997 a; Shehata and Nasr El-Din 2015).|$|R

40|$|Studying the {{permeability}} in {{a particular}} formation will be our address in this paper, through collection {{of a set of}} data in relates to the past real core analyses by the oil operators and correlating them to our lab works on the samples of the same formation from Pilaspi formation (M. EOCENE - U. EOCENE) outcrop on Haibat Sultan Mountain near Taq Taq oil Field. Lab works were done in Koya University using most of reservoir lab equipments for getting and determining the most important properties like porosity and permeability on plug samples of that formation. The key study in this paper is oil well TT- 02 in Taq Taq oil field. In this paper we will try to nominate and recognize the more active porosity type through measuring air and liquid permeability in our reservoir lab and show the effects of increasing flowing pressure on the permeability using saturated and dry <b>core</b> <b>plug.</b> Water and air were used as flowing fluids and two methods were used to measure the permeability; steady-state method, measures the permeability of a saturated <b>Core</b> <b>plug</b> under constant flow rate conditions and air permeability with (N 2) for dry <b>core</b> <b>plug.</b> ...|$|R
30|$|Figure  13 {{also shows}} that the {{imbibition}} time required to obtain the ultimate oil recovery was shorter for the high-permeability <b>core</b> <b>plug</b> compared with the low-permeability ones.

40|$|A novel {{adsorption}} type gel {{plugging agent}} (ATGPA) was prepared using acrylamide (AM), acrylic acid (AA), diallyl dimethyl ammonium chloride (DMDAAC), 2 -acrylamido- 2 -methylpropanesulfonate (AMPS), formaldehyde (HCHO), resorcinol (C 6 H 6 O 2), and thiocarbamide (CH 4 N 2 S) {{as raw materials}} under mild conditions. ATGPA was characterized by infrared (IR) spectroscopy, elemental analysis, and scanning electron microscope (SEM). It was found that ATGPA exhibited higher elastic modulus (G′) and viscous modulus (G′′) than AM/AA gel plugging agent (AAGPA) under the same scanning frequency. It was also found that ATGPA had moderate temperature resistance and salt tolerance. <b>Core</b> <b>plugging</b> tests results indicated that ATGPA could achieve up to higher plugging rate (PR) than AAGPA (97. 2 % versus 95. 7 %) at 65 °C.

50|$|Beginning in 1965, the 200 engines were {{upgraded}} to seven main bearings to reduce harmonic vibrations and increase durability.

The initial porosity and permeability of the core sample were also set based on the experimental condition, which are 12 % and 40  mD, respectively. In this model, the initial porosity and permeability of the core sample were kept constant along the <b>core</b> <b>plug.</b> Hence, the transport mechanism of the model was simplified to only one-dimensional flow, which is only in the direction from the inlet face to the outlet face (x-direction).|$|R
