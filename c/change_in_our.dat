Perales, with Perales the fund's first president. It was created as a privately funded, nonprofit and nonpartisan organization {{with the goal of}} changing discriminatory practices via advocacy and litigation. [...] It was inspired in form and purpose by the high-profile NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, which Thurgood Marshall had established in 1957. [...] PRLDEF (pronounced [...] "pearl-deaf") had $300,000 of initial funding from foundations, government sources, and private corporations. [...] U.S. House of Representatives member Herman Badillo was on its first Board of Directors, and at the fund's initial press conference he said, [...] "There is plenty of room for <b>change</b> <b>in</b> <b>our</b> society, and much can be done through the medium of class actions."

[...] The song [...] "changed everything" [...] for the group, leading their first two albums to sell more than twice what they had prior to the film's debut. [...] "Almost overnight, the Shins became indie-rock icons," [...] wrote Robert Levine of Spin. The band extended their tour in support of the song and its popularity. [...] "We saw a <b>change</b> <b>in</b> <b>our</b> audience. By the time we were done touring for Chutes Too Narrow, there was this new interest," [...] said Mercer. [...] "We toured again almost as the soundtrack to that movie, and colleges were all of a sudden interested in us playing on their campuses.

2500|$|The {{number of}} {{contacts}} on a social platform is sometimes considered {{an indicator of}} social capital.

Indeed, people tend to add friends to compensate low self-esteem {{and there is a}} high correlation between the number of [...] "friends" [...] on social media platforms and feeling social anxiety, leading to symptoms of major depression and dysthymia. [...] If we consider this aspect with regards to the relationships maintained through social media platforms, we can easily point out a <b>change</b> <b>in</b> <b>our</b> understanding of friendship. As a matter of fact, online platforms and social media services altered the old definition of friendship. Indeed, friendship [...] "redoubleth joys, and cutteth griefs in halves" [...] as stated by Francis Bacon.

2500|$|Upon {{returning}} to Malaya in 1959, {{he was appointed}} as external affairs minister. The following year, a controversy arose when the Tunku stated that Malaya would eventually have to recognise the communist People's Republic of China. This was, in the Tunku's words, [...] "a sudden <b>change</b> <b>in</b> <b>our</b> policy towards Communist China" [...] that had been influenced by private talks between the Tunku and French President Charles de Gaulle. Ismail was outraged by this decision, which had been taken without consultation with him, and directly contradicted Ismail's stated policy of refusing to recognise the People's Republic of China {{as long as they}} backed the Malayan Communist Party, which had waged an armed insurgency against the government. Ismail threatened to resign, and apparently attempted to do so on four separate occasions. The situation was defused by the Tunku refusing to see Ismail, who eventually calmed down and put the incident behind him, behaving [...] "as if nothing had happened." ...|$|E
2500|$|During congressional {{hearings}} held in November 2008 at Washington D.C., {{and in a}} show of support, Ford's Alan Mulally stated that [...] "We at Ford are hopeful that we have enough liquidity.

Mulally went on to state that [...] "The collapse of one of our competitors would have a severe impact on Ford" [...] and that Ford Motor Company's supports both Chrysler and General Motors in their search for government bridge loans in the face of conditions caused by the 2008 financial crisis. Together, the three companies presented action plans for the sustainability of the industry. Mulally stated that [...] "In addition to our plan, we are also here today to request support for the industry. In the near-term, Ford does not require access to a government bridge loan. However, we request a credit line of $9 billion as a critical backstop or safeguard against worsening conditions as we drive transformational <b>change</b> <b>in</b> <b>our</b> company" [...] GM and Chrysler received government loans and financing through T.A.R.P. legislation funding provisions.|$|E
2500|$|From the {{earliest}} days of Zionist settlement, Jewish immigrants wrote popular folk music. At first, songs were based on borrowed melodies from German, Russian, or traditional Jewish folk music with new lyrics written in Hebrew. Starting in the early 1920s, however, Jewish settlers made a conscious effort to create a new Hebrew style of music, a style that would tie them to their earliest Hebrew origins and that would differentiate them from the style of the Jewish diaspora of Eastern Europe, which they viewed as weak. This new style borrowed elements from Arabic and, to a lesser extent, traditional Yemenite and eastern Jewish styles: the songs were often homophonic (that is, without clear harmonic character), modal, and limited in range. [...] "The huge <b>change</b> <b>in</b> <b>our</b> lives demands new modes of expression," [...] wrote composer and music critic Menashe Ravina in 1943. [...] "... and, just as in our language we returned to our historical past, so has our ear turned to the music of the east ... as an expression of our innermost feelings." ...|$|E

2500|$|Several {{theories}} {{have been proposed}} which modify the equations of quantum mechanics to be symmetric with respect to time reversal. (E.g. see Wheeler-Feynman time-symmetric theory). [...] This creates retrocausality: events in the future can affect ones in the past, exactly as events in the past can affect ones in the future. [...] In these theories, a single measurement cannot fully determine the state of a system (making them a type of hidden variables theory), but given two measurements performed at different times, {{it is possible to}} calculate the exact state of the system at all intermediate times. [...] The collapse of the wavefunction is therefore not a physical change to the system, just a <b>change</b> <b>in</b> <b>our</b> knowledge of it due to the second measurement. [...] Similarly, they explain entanglement as not being a true physical state but just an illusion created by ignoring retrocausality. [...] The point where two particles appear to [...] "become entangled" [...] is simply a point where each particle is being influenced by events that occur to the other particle in the future.|$|E
2500|$|On {{the other}} hand, {{the events in}} Georgia {{demonstrated}} the necessity for greater concessions to the peasants; Stalin declared that an August 1924 uprising in Georgia was sparked by dissatisfaction among the peasants and called the party to conciliate them. He admitted that [...] "what has happened in Georgia may happen throughout Russia, unless we make a complete <b>change</b> <b>in</b> <b>our</b> attitude to the peasantry" [...] and placed {{the responsibility for the}} errors committed on subordinate officials. Vyacheslav Molotov, an influential member of the Politburo, for his part declared: [...] "Georgia provides a startling example of the breach between the Party and the mass of the peasantry in the country." [...] As a result, the Communist Party of Georgia chose, for the time being, to use peaceful persuasion rather than armed coercion to extend their influence over the peasant masses, and to moderate the attempts to enforce collectivization. The extension of the radical land reform and the relative freedom granted peasants reduced hostility to the new regime. Although the last attributes of Georgia's political and economic sovereignty, which both the Mensheviks and the [...] "national Communists" [...] had fought to preserve, had been eliminated, the final victory of the Soviet power in Georgia was accompanied by moderate economic growth, that ensured relative stability in the country. Another important factor in lessening opposition to the Bolsheviks, particularly from the intelligentsia, was the policy of [...] "nativization" [...] pursued by the Soviet government in the 1920s; Georgian art, language, and learning were promoted; the spread of literacy was sponsored and the role of ethnic Georgians in administrative and cultural institutions enhanced.|$|E
