60|$|Before {{the captain}} could answer {{there came a}} call down the <b>companion</b> <b>way.</b>|$|E
60|$|He {{ran up the}} <b>companion</b> <b>way,</b> and Mrs. Stanhope followed. The lady felt {{weak and}} utterly discouraged.|$|E
60|$|Then Komba, after {{consultation}} with his <b>companions,</b> gave <b>way.</b> Evidently he was anxious {{that we should}} visit Pongo-land.|$|R

60|$|Sam {{passed him}} with a cold face and hurried through the door leading to the <b>companion</b> <b>way.</b>|$|E
60|$|He {{was about}} to leave the cabin when a form darkened the <b>companion</b> <b>way,</b> and Arnold Baxter appeared.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Albert now went {{round to}} the other side of the <b>companion</b> <b>way,</b> to the place where the two ladies were sitting.|$|E
50|$|Mughal Badshah Jehangir and his <b>companions</b> {{on their}} <b>way</b> to Ahmedabad stopped at this {{historic}} place near Jehangirpur {{which is now}} called Rander Eid-Gah.|$|R
50|$|After {{some time}} to recover, the <b>companions</b> make their <b>way</b> to the MAT-TRANS chamber; Michael accompanies them. Ryan closes the door and initiates the jump.|$|R
50|$|The path of {{the line}} follows the Pennine Way for some of its route, and was {{mentioned}} by Alfred Wainwright in his Pennine <b>Way</b> <b>Companion.</b>|$|R
60|$|So {{they chose}} good seats near the <b>companion</b> <b>way,</b> {{and sat down}} there, and their husbands brought them carpet bags to put their feet upon.|$|E
60|$|We {{were moving}} towards the <b>companion</b> <b>way,</b> to go below for lunch, when a boat hailed us. We {{went to the}} side and looked over.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, {{it will be}} best," [...] added Crabtree, {{and then}} the lady {{disappeared}} down the <b>companion</b> <b>way,</b> walking slowly, for she felt weaker than ever, because of the excitement.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{did not say}} that," [...] remarked the free-and-easy Eskimo, {{interrupting}} his <b>companion</b> in a <b>way</b> {{that would}} have been deemed very bad manners in an Indian, [...] "I asked you the question." ...|$|R
60|$|The {{fisherman}} readily agreed, and Edmund and his <b>companions</b> {{made their}} <b>way</b> {{into the heart}} of the island. It was of some extent, and rose above the tree-tops of the surrounding country. Presently they came to a cottage. A man came out.|$|R
60|$|With such {{kinds of}} {{histories}} of their parties and good jokes, did Lydia, assisted by Kitty's hints and additions, endeavour to amuse her <b>companions</b> all the <b>way</b> to Longbourn. Elizabeth listened {{as little as}} she could, {{but there was no}} escaping the frequent mention of Wickham's name.|$|R
60|$|At {{that instant}} a loud sneeze reached their ears, causing Dick to pause on the <b>companion</b> <b>way.</b> Looking {{into the cabin}} he saw a man {{standing}} there, partly dressed.|$|E
60|$|Dick was right; Captain Langless was {{descending}} the <b>companion</b> <b>way.</b> On tiptoes {{the three}} boys {{hurried to the}} door leading to the hold. As they flung it back they found themselves confronted by Arnold Baxter and Dan.|$|E
6000|$|He {{led the way}} grimly back to the cabin, {{the young}} people following; but turning {{suddenly}} at the <b>companion</b> <b>way</b> he observed Renshaw's arm around the waist of his daughter. He said nothing until they had reached the cabin, when {{he closed the door}} softly, and looking at them both gently, said with infinite cunning: ...|$|E
5000|$|Carolyn Cushman in [...] Locus [...] calls Here There Be Dragons “a Thurberesque {{idea and}} Zelazny handles it quite well.” She {{goes on to}} write: “It’s a cute story, without intrusively obvious {{educational}} elements, and with just enough truth, wonder and silliness to catch the imagination of all ages.” She likes it “for its satiric wit and appeal across ages.” [...] Darrell Schweitzer in Aboriginal Science Fiction writes that Here There Be Dragons [...] and its <b>companion</b> piece, <b>Way</b> Up High, “are charming, and worthy of widespread circulation.” ...|$|R
50|$|Hooker hired Billy the Kid {{before he}} became famous during the Lincoln County War. Hooker, like many ranchers and businessmen, {{supported}} the lawmen Virgil and Wyatt Earp. On March 27, 1882, after the Earp Vendetta Ride, Hooker hosted the Earps and their <b>companions</b> on their <b>way</b> out of the Arizona Territory.|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{need not}} tell an old seaman how {{to gather in}} the slack of a running idea!" [...] cried Bob, chuckling and winking at his <b>companion</b> in a <b>way</b> that displeased the latter by its familiarity; [...] "I have not lived fifty years on blue water, to mistake it for the skies." ...|$|R
60|$|Once on deck Tom {{looked around}} him curiously, {{and then moved}} toward the <b>companion</b> <b>way</b> leading to the cabin. He felt instinctively {{that he was in}} a {{dangerous}} position. As he crossed the deck several ill-appearing sailors gazed at him curiously, but said nothing--being under strict orders from the captain to remain silent {{in the presence of the}} stranger.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, he's your father--Nott? Certainly. I see now," [...] he continued, {{looking at}} her with a half {{repressed}} smile. [...] "Certainly, Miss Nott, good morning," [...] he half added and walked towards the <b>companion</b> <b>way.</b> Something in the direction of his eyes as he turned away made Rosey lift her hands to her head. She had forgotten to remove her father's baleful gift.|$|E
60|$|Military {{men are not}} as sure-footed as sailors {{on board}} a ship, which may be rolling and tossing on rough waters; and one day, as Colonel Wolfe was coming into the cabin, he tripped and fell when he was halfway down the <b>companion</b> <b>way,</b> and would {{probably}} have broken his neck, {{if it had not}} been that Honeyman happened to be at the bottom of the steps, and caught the colonel in his arms, thus saving him from injury.|$|E
5000|$|Here {{some years}} afterwards, {{according}} to , {{where he is}} described as [...] "the evangelist" [...] (a term found again in the New Testament only in Ephesians 2 Timothy [...] ), he entertained Paul the Apostle and his <b>companion</b> on their <b>way</b> to Jerusalem; at that time [...] "he had four daughters which did prophesy".|$|R
60|$|An {{argument}} {{arose in}} regard to the best way up the slope, and by virtue of a majority we decided to try the direction Jim and I thought best. My <b>companions</b> led the <b>way,</b> carrying the lioness suspended on the pole. I brought up the rear, packing my rifle, camera, lasso, canteen and a chain.|$|R
50|$|Revised {{editions of}} Wainwright's other Pictorial Guides, A Coast to Coast Walk, The Outlying Fells of Lakeland and Pennine <b>Way</b> <b>Companion</b> were {{published}} between 2010 and 2012, with the amendments again {{being made by}} Chris Jesty. Revised editions of Walks in Limestone Country and Walks on the Howgill Fells were published in April 2014.|$|R
6000|$|The {{next moment}} {{both men were}} flying up the pilot-house <b>companion</b> <b>way,</b> three steps at a jump! Nobody there! The great steamer was {{whistling}} {{down the middle of}} the river at her own sweet will! The watchman shot out of the place again; Ealer seized the wheel, set an engine back with power, and held his breath while the boat reluctantly swung away from a 'towhead' which she was about to knock into the middle of the Gulf of Mexico! ...|$|E
60|$|The opening was now tolerably clear, {{and away}} went the three boys for the cabin, gaining the {{compartment}} {{before any of}} the men could follow. The door to the <b>companion</b> <b>way</b> was open, and up the steps they flew with all the speed at their command. They heard the sailors yell at them and use language unfit to print, but paid no heed. Their one thought was to put distance between themselves and those who wished to keep them prisoners.|$|E
60|$|Nevertheless this calm {{security}} was presently invaded {{by a sense}} of stealthy life and motion. What had seemed a fixed shadow suddenly detached itself from the deck, and began to slip stanchion by stanchion along the bulwarks toward the <b>companion</b> <b>way.</b> At the cabin door it halted and crouched motionless. Then rising, it glided forward with the same staccato movement until opposite the slight elevation of the forehatch. Suddenly it darted to the hatch, unfastened and lifted it with a swift, familiar dexterity, and disappeared in the opening. But as the moon shone upon its vanishing face, it revealed the whitening eyes and teeth of the Lascar seaman.|$|E
6000|$|... [Footnote B: There is {{something}} characteristic in Wordsworth's addressing an intimate travelling <b>companion</b> in this <b>way.</b> S. T. C., or Charles Lamb, would have written, as we do, [...] "My dear Jones"; but Wordsworth addressed his friend as [...] "Dear Sir," [...] and described his sister as [...] "a Young Lady," [...] {{and as a}} [...] "Female Friend."--Ed.] ...|$|R
40|$|In {{a review}} of psychology, {{psychopathology}} can be started from three assumptions. First, the Freudian assumed that the human soul was basically born in sickness, evil, negative / destructive. To be positive, it need <b>companion</b> <b>ways</b> that are impersonal and directive / directing. Second, as a behaviorist, Skinner assumed that the human soul was born in neutral (not sick and unhealthy), where the environment {{plays a role in}} determining the direction of its development. Third, Maslow and Rogers as a humanistic figure assumed that the human soul was born in a state of conscious, free, responsible and guided by positive forces emanating from itself to the expansion of all human potential to its fullest. Whereas in Islamic studies of psychopathology can be divided into two categories, namely the worldly, as has been formulated by contemporary psychology, and the hereafter. This paper attempts to explain kinds of psychotherapy according to the study of Islam and how Islam is doing its part in the psychotherapy world and ukhrowi psychopathology. Discussion of Islam against psychopathology of psychotherapy becomes important. In addition to see the growing of Islamization method, as well as to explore therapist aspects in Islam based on the Qur'an and Hadith. The Islamic Psychotherapy is also to provide an alternative to the criticisms made against modern psychology that break away from the values of divinity. This paper begins his discussion of the notion of Psychopathology, Islamic psychotherapy understanding and the existing concept of the theories...|$|R

I keep six indoors, {{and if someone}} rings about an infestation and asks us to go ratting, they will know and {{are out of the}} door in a millisecond. If you train them, they'll retrieve. They'll do anything to please you." ...|$|R
