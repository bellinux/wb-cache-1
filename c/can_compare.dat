5|$|Structural {{alignments}} <b>can</b> <b>compare</b> two sequences {{or multiple}} sequences. Because these alignments rely on information {{about all the}} query sequences' three-dimensional conformations, the method can only be used on sequences where these structures are known. These are usually found by X-ray crystallography or NMR spectroscopy. It is possible to perform a structural alignment on structures produced by structure prediction methods. Indeed, evaluating such predictions often requires a structural alignment between the model and the true known structure to assess the model's quality. Structural alignments are especially useful in analyzing data from structural genomics and proteomics efforts, {{and they can be}} used as comparison points to evaluate alignments produced by purely sequence-based bioinformatics methods.|$|E

25|$|OBE can be {{compared}} across different institutions. On an individual level, institutions can look at what outcomes a student has achieved to decide what level the student would be at within a new institution. On an institutional level, institutions <b>can</b> <b>compare</b> themselves, by checking to see what outcomes they have in common, and find places where they may need improvement, based on the achievement of outcomes at other institutions. The ability to compare easily across institutions allows students to move between institutions with relative ease. The institutions <b>can</b> <b>compare</b> outcomes to determine what credits to award the student. The clearly articulated outcomes should allow institutions to assess the student’s achievements rapidly, leading to increased movement of students. These outcomes also work for school to work transitions. A potential employer can look at records of the potential employee to determine what outcomes they have achieved. They can then determine if the potential employee has the skills necessary for the job.|$|E

And I can sum up that difference in one word: none.|$|E
25|$|For various reasons, an {{approach}} based on cardinal utility, where the utility has a meaning beyond just giving a ranking of alternatives, is not common in contemporary economics. However, once one adopts that approach, one can take intensities of preferences into consideration, or one <b>can</b> <b>compare</b> (i) {{gains and losses}} of utility or (ii) levels of utility, across different individuals. In particular, Harsanyi (1955) gives a justification of utilitarianism (which evaluates alternatives {{in terms of the}} sum of individual utilities), originating from Jeremy Bentham. Hammond (1976) gives a justification of the maximin principle (which evaluates alternatives in terms of the utility of the worst-off individual), originating from John Rawls.|$|E

25|$|In {{addition}} to poor states of preservation, the poor impression modern listeners may get of wax cylinders is from their early date, which <b>can</b> <b>compare</b> unfavorably to recordings made even {{a dozen years}} later. Other than a single playable example from 1878 (from an experimental phonograph-clock), the oldest playable preserved cylinders are from the year 1888. These include a severely degraded recording of Johannes Brahms, Handel's Israel in Egypt and a short speech by Sir Arthur Sullivan in fairly listenable condition. Somewhat later are the almost unlistenable 1889 amateur recordings of Nina Grieg. The problem with the wax cylinders is that they readily support the growth of mildew which penetrates throughout the cylinder and, if serious enough, renders the recording unplayable. The earliest preserved rubber disc recordings are children's records, featuring animal noises and nursery rhymes. This means that the earliest disc recordings most music lovers will hear are shellac discs made after 1900, after {{more than ten years}} of development.|$|E

500|$|Warren denies {{claims of}} an imitation, noting the {{discrepancies}} between the production schedules: when Inseminoid entered the shooting stage, Alien, {{which had been}} filmed in closed studios, had been released months before. While the director accepts the often [...] "uncanny" [...] similarities between the two films, he states that Alien distributors 20th Century Fox discounted the possibility of derivation after watching the final cut of Inseminoid: [...] "... in fact, the head of Fox sent us a very nice letter saying how much he enjoyed the film and wished us luck with the release ... I find it flattering that anyone <b>can</b> <b>compare</b> Alien, which cost {{in the region of}} $30million, with Inseminoid which cost less than £1million.

[...] On December 28, 2008, the UK Singles Chart listed it as the second biggest selling single for the year end countdown and the nineteenth best-selling single of the decade. The British Phonographic Industry (BPI) certified the song double-platinum, denoting shipments of over 1.2 million copies within the country.|$|E

500|$|Thin layer {{chromatography}} (TLC) {{is a quick}} {{alternative to}} more complex chromatography methods. TLC {{can be used to}} analyze inks and dyes by extracting the individual components. [...] This can be used to investigate notes or fibers left at the scene since each company's product is slightly different and those differences can be seen with TLC. [...] The only limiting factor with TLC analysis is the necessity for the components to be soluble in whatever solution is used to carry the components up the analysis plate. [...] This solution is called the mobile phase. [...] The forensic chemist <b>can</b> <b>compare</b> unknowns with known standards [...] by looking at the distance each component traveled. [...] This distance, when compared to the starting point, is known as the retention factor (Rf) for each extracted component. [...] If each Rf value matches a known sample, that is an indication of the unknown's identity.|$|E
500|$|However, Looking Glass Studios {{experienced}} serious {{financial trouble}} as development progressed into mid-1997. The company's Austin branch closed, costing Spector and several game engine programmers; this team relocated to ION Storm, and released Deus Ex in 2000. Spector later called his impact on Thief, [...] "at best, minimal". Levine too had left The Dark Project project before the Keepers factions {{was added to}} the game. By April 18, Looking Glass Studios laid off half of its entire staff in six months, which damaged morale of The Dark Project team, which at this point was vastly different from the one with which the development began. [...] "Few emotions <b>can</b> <b>compare</b> to the stress of heading to work not knowing who might be laid off, including yourself, or whether the doors would be locked when you got there," [...] lead programmer Tom Leonard later said. This stress caused several team members to voluntarily quit, including the lead programmer (Briscoe Rogers) who had designed the game's AI system, which suffered from software bugs and problems with complexity.|$|E

500|$|Criticism of Kurosawa in {{his legacy}} has {{significantly}} followed a close parity between the main currents of domestic criticism his films received {{when they were}} released in Japan with the international reception his individual films received when released abroad during his lifetime. Since the early to mid-1950s, a number of critics from the French New Wave championed the films of the older Japanese master, Kenji Mizoguchi, {{at the expense of}} Kurosawa's work. New Wave critic-filmmaker Jacques Rivette, said: [...] "You <b>can</b> <b>compare</b> only what is comparable and that which aims high enough... seems to be the only Japanese director who is completely Japanese and yet is also the only one that achieves a true universality, that of an individual." [...] According to such French commentators, Mizoguchi seemed, of the two artists, the more authentically Japanese. But at least one film scholar has questioned the validity of this dichotomy between [...] "Japanese" [...] Mizoguchi and [...] "Western" [...] Kurosawa by pointing out that [...] "Mizo" [...] had been as influenced by Western cinema and Western culture in general as Kurosawa, and that this is reflected in his work.|$|E
500|$|Within {{hours of}} its launch A Journey became the fastest-selling {{autobiography}} {{of all time}} at bookseller Waterstones, where it sold more copies in one day than Peter Mandelson's [...] had done in its first three weeks earlier that year.

Within a week, Nielsen BookScan said that 92,000 copies of A Journey had been sold in the United Kingdom, the best opening week for an autobiography since the company began keeping figures in 1998. The New York Times reported that in the United States, an initial print run of 50,000 copies had been extended by another 25,000, with the book set to debut at Number 3 on The New York Times hardcover best-seller list.
