40|$|Thuya occidentalis “Emeraud” (Thuya ssp), {{is one of}} {{the most}} used {{evergreen}} ornamental plants for decoration of parks and gardens with very slow growth. They form few seeds with relatively low germination. This is the cause of the continuous efforts to find efficient ways of vegetative propagation, which influence the increase of the coefficient of thuya’s propagation. The paper presents the influence of the naphthalene acetic acid (NAA) 4000 ppm in the rooting of one year vegetative <b>cuttings</b> of Thuya occidentalis “Emeraud”, with and without biennial wood. The experiment was carried out during three consecutive years, 2008 - 2010, in the flower’s greenhouse of the Experimental Centre of the Department of Horticulture at Agricultural University of Tirana. The one year vegetative <b>cuttings</b> were prepared as simple <b>cuttings</b> (<b>cuttings</b> without bark or biennial wood) and <b>cuttings</b> with the scion (<b>cuttings</b> with bark or biennial wood). Vegetative <b>cuttings</b> of thuya were sown in the perlite band. Control for the final rooted seedlings and/or rooting percentage was carried out 60 days after sowing of the vegetative <b>cuttings</b> in the perlite band. There was calculated the rooting percentage of the vegetative <b>cuttings</b> treated and untreated with NAA 4000 ppm. The results show that the average rooting percentage of the simple untreated <b>cuttings</b> was 20 %, while the average rooting percentage of the untreated <b>cuttings</b> with a scion was 45 %. Total rooting percentage of the untreated <b>cuttings</b> was 32. 5 %. So, <b>cuttings</b> with a scion (the <b>cuttings</b> with bark and biennial wood), have a higher rooting percentage even when they are not treated with NAA. There were observed significant differences of the results in the case of treating <b>cuttings</b> with the rooting hormone NAA, 4000 ppm. These differences consisted in increasing the rooting ability and the rooting percentage of the <b>cuttings.</b> The average rooting percentage of the simple untreated <b>cuttings</b> with NAA was 51 %, while the mean percentage of the <b>cuttings</b> with a scion treated with NAA was 80 %. The total rooting percentage of the untreated <b>cuttings</b> was 65. 5 %. The use of the rooting hormone NAA, 4000 ppm, for the treatment of the one year vegetative <b>cuttings</b> of thuya was followed by the significant increases the rooting percentage in total from 32. 5 % to 65. 5 %. The three-year-results showed that the use of the rooting hormone NAA, 4000 ppm, does affect significantly in the increase of the rooting percentage of the vegetative <b>cuttings,</b> up to 30 %, as well as in doubling the quantity of the seedling produced for each planting season, which was confirmed by ANOVA...|$|R

It is important and essential to study critical parameters how to influence <b>cuttings</b> bed development, especially the drillpipe rotation effects on <b>cuttings</b> transport behavior. In this study, <b>cuttings</b> transport simulations were carried out for inclinations from 45 ° to 90 °, for pipe rotation speeds from 80 to 240  rpm, and for flow rates from 30 to 50  L/s. Annular <b>cuttings</b> volume, pressure drop, and <b>cuttings</b> distribution are recorded simultaneously within the simulation proceeding. The CFD simulations show that pipe rotation makes <b>cuttings</b> presented in asymmetric distribution along the wellbore and significantly improves the drag effects on drilling fluid in the tangential direction. At a low or medium flow rate, pipe rotation has a significant impact on annular <b>cuttings</b> volume and pressure drop. However, there is no additional contribution of pipe rotation after reaching critical speed at high flow rates. Buckingham-π theorem combined with least square method was applied to establish the empirical correlations for estimating <b>cuttings</b> concentration and annular pressure drop.|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Drill <b>cuttings</b> {{with various}} {{characteristics}} and sizes are produced in any offshore {{oil and gas}} exploration and production (EP) drilling of the seabed. Drill <b>cuttings</b> may be transported to shore for land disposal or they may be disposed off into the sea after proper treatment on site. Offshore disposal of treated drilling muds and rock <b>cuttings</b> is operationally the simplest option available and economically the least expensive. Appropriate environmental measures, however, must be taken to ensure that the marine environment is not unduly polluted by the discharged drill <b>cuttings.</b> Further, the disposed drill <b>cuttings</b> will ultimately deposit onto the seabed to form piles around the toe of the platform that might hinder optimal pipe laying and maintenance. To enable proper assessment of the impacts of drill <b>cuttings</b> on the seabed and the marine environment, model simulations are performed to analyze the transport, dispersion and deposition of drilling muds and rock <b>cuttings.</b> For this purpose, a simulation model known as TUNA-PT has been developed to model the transport and deposition of drill <b>cuttings</b> subject to various climatic conditions, coastal environments and <b>cuttings</b> characteristics.
