40|$|The {{problem and}} the solution. Until recently, planned train-ing on the job has been {{primarily}} used to achieve individual train-ing objectives. How to use planned {{training on the job}} as part of the change management process to achieve broader organiza-tional goals has recently emerged as an issue of importance. Spe-cifically, planned training on the job has been suggested as a means to deliver <b>cascade</b> <b>training.</b> <b>Cascade</b> <b>training</b> has been defined as the process of providing the competence required to ensure the institutionalization of organizational change. Con-necting planned training on the job and <b>cascade</b> <b>training</b> for the purpose of institutionalizing organizational change has implica-tions for both human resource development (HRD) theory and practice. The previous chapters of this monograph have focused on the nature of planned training on the job and its use to achieve training objectives for indi-vidual trainees. In this chapter, we suggest that planned training on the job, when used in combination with other training approaches, can be used to help achieve broader organizational change goals as part of the change man-agement process. Specifically, planned training on the job can be used to help ensure that change efforts will persist beyond the initial implementa-tion period. We call this <b>cascade</b> <b>training</b> because the name conjures the image of having a critical information flow from one group to another until it reaches the final destination, similar to that of a waterfall. Although <b>cascade</b> <b>training</b> can include several different training approaches, including classroom training and computer-lab training, some form of planned training on the job is invariably a major part of its design. Indeed, the particular appeal of <b>cascade</b> <b>training</b> comes from having employees both deliver and receive the training in the actual change context. This chapter discusses a framework for institutionalizing change and the role of training in promoting the institutionalization process. Second, th...|$|E

40|$|The {{emergence}} {{and spread}} of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza H 5 N 1 has caused substantial poultry-related economic losses {{and public health}} concerns {{in relation to a}} potential pandemic. While biosecurity measures for commercial poultry industry are of the highest standards, these measures are difficult to implement and often unaffordable for backyard poultry farming, particularly in tropical and low-income settings. We designed a feasible biosecurity intervention to improve flock hygiene in Cambodia, - based on community hygiene, cleaning of poultry flock areas and human and poultry movement control. We conducted a cluster randomized and controlled intervention trial in 18 villages in Takeo province to evaluate improvements in biosecurity-related knowledge and practices. The intervention relied on community involvement and community education using special information dissemination tools. We trained village teams (VT) to assist villagers in implementing the intervention using a <b>cascade</b> <b>training</b> approach, in which a few individuals were trained, who in turn trained a larger group of people. During the 14 month follow up, we conducted observational and interview-based surveys (baseline vs. final surveys, VT supervision visits, monitoring surveys) to assess VTs' motivation, intervention messages dissemination and the implementation of recommended measures. Most of villagers (95 %, confidence interval: 87. 8 - 100. 0 %) in intervention villages received general information about how to raise poultry. Farmers in intervention villages reported to have made more changes (? 1 biosecurity related practice during the study period) compared with that of control villages (70. 0 % (260 / 372) vs. 22. 6 % (85 / 377), p value. <. 0. 01). When observing biosecurity-related practices in intervention villages, overall scores increased significantly (p<. 0. 05). Practices such as use of quarantine cages for new and sick birds, limitation of people movement in backyards and waste management reached high scores during the 15 -months period within five of the nine intervention villages. <b>Cascade</b> <b>training</b> managed to reach out to almost all villagers and significantly influence changes in biosecurity practices in the community. However, further follow-ups are needed to assess whether practices-related changes persist {{over a longer period of}} time. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|E
40|$|Investigations {{related to}} {{educational}} technologies, ensuring the Investigations {{are related to}} the educational technologies, ensuring the formation and support of a system of mentoring of managerial staff {{on the basis of the}} «cascade» technology training. A new form of <b>cascade</b> <b>training</b> – academic <b>cascade</b> <b>training</b> when the educational institutions create a large-scale information and educational environment on the basis of telecommunication technologies to provide the institute mentoring support in the state bodies and organizations. In comparison with the traditional mentoring (personal experience), students and graduates of the retraining system of educational institutions can transmit the knowledge and skills, acquired by them in the course of training, to the young managers and specialists of their organizations, thereby promoting further innovative educational potential of educational institutions through a system of cascading mentoring. For this purpose, in educational institutions an interactive educational environment is created based on telecommunication technologies, which allows you to create and develop a common information space, to simplify the procedure for communicating the mentors and trainees, to provide a wide access to the content. Telecommunication information technologies are not only a powerful tool, intelligent instrument and means of creating a cascade learning environment, but also an important factor in improving the entire methodical system of mentoring. It is proposed the creation of a large-scale information and educational environment on the basis of telecommunication technologies for <b>cascade</b> <b>training</b> when the educational institutions may become a part of the mentoring institution. On the one hand, they prepare students, including both potential mentors, and on the other hand, using modern telecommunication educational technologies, they participate together with the students-mentors in mentoring activity in organizations. Today, the full range of human activities entrusted to the personnel service of organizations. Educational institutions are involved only in the process of learning and, as a rule, stand apart from the rest of the personnel requirements of organizations (according to the principle: “We gave you the knowledge, and then you are by yourself…”). It is practically impossible to create a large-scale system of continuous development of managerial staff in the organizations without continuous interaction of personnel services in organizations, and educational institutions that have, both human and educational technologies. It is proposed to extend the learning process of the educational institutions in the state bodies and organizations through a system of cascading mentoring based on telecommunication technologies. The structure of the e-learning system provides means of creation, management and delivery of the content, means of organizing the learning process and interaction support of the participants. E-learning system provides system view of the educational process, when the main unit is not the academic discipline, and the formed administrative competence, around which the complex process of interaction between students, lecturers, learners and educational institutions exists. In the Academy of Management this interaction is carried out using the remote control SharePoint LMS learning system, which provides the high-quality implementation of the educational process. In the cascade mentoring system the distance learning is based on the modern telecommunication technologies and means of remote access to the distributed databases and knowledge of scientific, technical and educational information. The most promising model in this area is the open education, the dominant trend in the development of which becomes the student-centered learning model, taking into account the individual, personal qualities of each student and is based on the advanced pedagogical and information technologies of distance learning. </p...|$|E

40|$|Short {{overview}} of the Chapter—Motion estimation necessitates an appropriate choice of similarity function. Because generic similarity functions derived from simple assumptions are insufficient to model complex yet structured appearance variations in motion estimation, we propose to learn a discriminative similarity function to match images under varying appearances by casting image matching into a binary classification problem. We use the LogitBoost algorithm to learn the classifier based on an annotated database that exemplifies the structured appearance variations: An image pair in correspondence is positive and an image pair out of correspondence is negative. To leverage the additional distance structure of negatives, we present a location-sensitive <b>cascade</b> <b>training</b> procedure that bootstraps negatives for later stages of the cascade from the regions closer to the positives, which enables viewing {{a large number of}} negatives and steering the training process to yield lower training and test errors.

30|$|After {{one stage}} of {{classifiers}} learning is converged via Algorithm 2, {{we continue to}} train another one with false-positive samples coming from the scanning of non-target images with the partially trained cascade. We repeat this procedure until the overall FPR reaches the stated goal. As with many current methods [3, 20, 26, 27], this measure was also inspired by the V-J framework [1], and although we indicated in Section 3.3 that we had adopted this approach, our approach is able to process binary cascades, as well as multi-class cascades. In every independent threading channel, respective cascade recognition sub-frameworks can be trained simultaneously for each data category. Furthermore, we propose an algorithm (Algorithm 2) to implement the boosting ensemble of classifiers for multiclass cascades, which is an original contribution to boost learning research. Equally important is that in our approach, the <b>cascade</b> <b>training</b> process is based on AUC analysis, and the FPR is usually much smaller than 0.5. In addition, it is adaptive for different stages. Therefore, this approach {{can result in a}} model size that is much smaller and has a recognition speed that is dramatically increased.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background The {{training}} of health {{workers in the}} use of malaria rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) is an important component of a wider strategy to improve parasite-based malaria diagnosis at lower level health care facilities (LLHFs) where microscopy is not readily available for all patients with suspected malaria. This study describes the process and cost of training to attain competence of lower level health workers to perform malaria RDTs in a public health system setting in eastern Uganda. Methods Health workers from 21 health facilities in Uganda were given a one-day central training on the use of RDTs in malaria case management, including practical skills on how to perform read and interpret the test results. Successful trainees subsequently integrated the use of RDTs into their routine care for febrile patients at their LLHFs and transferred their acquired skills to colleagues (<b>cascade</b> <b>training</b> model). A cross-sectional evaluation of the health workers’ competence in performing RDTs was conducted six weeks following the training, incorporating observation, in-depth interviews with health workers and the review of health facility records relating to tests offered and antimalarial drug (AMD) prescriptions pre and post training. The direct costs relating to the training processes were also documented. Results Overall, 135 health workers were trained including 63 (47 %) nursing assistants, a group of care providers without formal medical training. All trainees passed the post-training concordance test with[*]≥[*] 80 % except 12 that required re-training. Six weeks after the one-day training, 51 / 64 (80 %) of the health workers accurately performed the critical steps in performing the RDT. The performance was similar among the 10 (16 %) participants who were peer-trained by their trained colleagues. Only 9 (14 %) did not draw the appropriate amount of blood using pipette. The average cost of the one-day training was US$ 101 (range $ 92 -$ 112), with the main cost drivers being trainee travel and per-diems. Health workers offered RDTs to 76 % of febrile patients and AMD prescriptions reduced by 37 % six weeks post-training. Conclusion One-day training on the use of RDTs successfully provided adequate skill and competency among health workers to perform RDTs in fever case management at LLHF in a Uganda setting. The cost averaged at US$ 101 per health worker trained, with the main cost drivers being trainee travel and per diems. Given the good peer training noted in this study, there is need to explore the cost-effectiveness of a <b>cascade</b> <b>training</b> model for large scale implementation of RDTs. </p...|$|E
40|$|Motion {{estimation}} {{for applications}} where appearance undergoes complex changes is challenging {{due to lack}} of an appropriate similarity function. In this paper, we propose to learn a discriminative similarity function based on an annotated database that exemplifies the appearance variations. We invoke the LogitBoost algorithm to selectively combine weak learners into one strong similarity function. The weak learners based on local rectangle features are constructed as nonparametric 2 D piecewise constant functions, using the feature responses from both images, to strengthen the modeling power and accommodate fast evaluation. Because the negatives possess a location parameter measuring their closeness to the positives, we present a locationsensitive <b>cascade</b> <b>training</b> procedure, which bootstraps negatives for later stages of the cascade from the regions closer to the positives. This allows viewing a large number of negatives and steering the training process to yield lower training and test errors. In experiments of estimating the motion for the endocardial wall of the left ventricle in echocardiography, we compare the learned similarity function with conventional ones and obtain improved performances. We also contrast the proposed method with a learning-based detection algorithm to demonstrate the importance of temporal information in motion estimation. Finally, we insert the learned similarity function into a simple contour tracking algorithm and find that it reduces drifting. 1...|$|E
