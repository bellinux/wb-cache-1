50|$|The {{diagnosis}} of Jeavons syndrome is simple because the characteristic eyelid myoclonia, if seen once, {{will never be}} forgotten or confused with other conditions. Furthermore, the EEG with the characteristic eye-closure-related discharges and photosensitivity leaves no room for diagnostic error.

The symptom/seizure of eyelid myoclonia alone {{is not sufficient to}} characterise Jeavons syndrome, as it may also occur in symptomatic and <b>cryptogenic</b> <b>epilepsies,</b> which are betrayed by developmental delay, learning difficulties, neurological deficits, and abnormal MRI and background EEG.|$|R
40|$|We {{evaluated}} the efficacy {{and safety of}} lamotrigine in 41 {{children and young adults}} (age range, 3 - 25 years; mean, 12 years) with drug-resistant, partial epilepsies, based on a prospective, add-on study Patients had severe symptomatic/cryptogenic partial epilepsies (mean seizure frequency = 3. 6 /day), resistant to one to four major antiepileptic drugs. Mean seizure fre-quency significantly decreased (P 50 % seizure reduction) was observed in 15 patients of whom 6 were seizure-free (follow-up: 12 - 48 months). Higher responder rate was found among <b>cryptogenic</b> <b>epilepsies</b> and epilepsies symptomatic of cerebral malformation, whereas patients with posthypoxic-ischemic perinatal damage were poor responders. Lamotrigine discontinuation was mainly due to lack of efficacy (46 % of patients), whereas only 2 patients developed a transient skin rash and did not drop out. Lamotrigine represents a valuable treatment for severe partial epilepsies of childhood that have proved resistant to previous antiepileptic drugs. (J Child Neurol 2000; 15 : 671 - 674).

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to analyse the {{comorbidity}} between headache and epilepsy in a large series of children with headache (1, 795). Fifty-six cases (3. 1 %) suffered from idiopathic headache and idiopathic or <b>cryptogenic</b> <b>epilepsy</b> or unprovoked seizures. There was a strong association between migraine and epilepsy: in migraineurs (46 / 56) the risk of epilepsy was 3. 2 times higher when compared with tension-type headache, without significant difference between migraine with and without aura (P = 0. 89); children with epilepsy had a 4. 5 -fold increased risk of developing migraine than tension-type headache. In cases with comorbidity, focal epilepsies prevailed (43 / 56, 76. 8 %). Migraineurs affected by focal epilepsies (36 / 56) had a three times higher risk of having a <b>cryptogenic</b> <b>epilepsy</b> (27 / 36, 75 %) than an idiopathic epilepsy (9 / 36, 25 %) (P = 0. 003).

40|$|BACKGROUND Temporal lobe {{epilepsy}} (TLE) is {{a frequent}} type of focal epilepsy that constitutes 30 % to 50 % of all epileptic syndromes. This medical condition {{is often associated with}} hippocampal sclerosis, however it can be due to cortical dysplasia, brain tumour, vascular malformation or without any evidence for pathology (cryptogenic). Even though the main symptoms are the seizures, epilepsy sometimes interferes with cognitive functions such as visual or verbal memory, language or attention. TLE is frequently pharmaco-­‐resistant and only a hippocampal resection helps patients to become seizure-­‐free. Temporal lobe epilepsy is also described as a progressive disorder that causes chronic brain tissue damages. History of febrile seizures and status epilepticus, frequency of seizures and age at onset of seizure, as well as epilepsy duration or years of anti-­‐epileptic drugs use are all factors that impact the gravity of the brain structure's damage. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has undergone a considerable development and, nowadays, has become an essential clinical tool in the diagnosis of TLE. It is currently used to reveal precisely cerebral abnormalities that may induce seizures. PURPOSE The aim of this cross-­‐sectional study is to investigate the pattern of microstructural brain tissue characteristics (grey and white matter volumes) occurring in three clinically distinctive TLE entities: mesial temporal sclerosis (MTS), focal cortical dysplasia (FCD) and <b>cryptogenic</b> <b>epilepsy.</b> By comparing them to each other, we want to acquire in-­‐depth knowledge of their pathological mechanism. We use well-­‐established computational anatomy methodology -­‐ voxel-­‐ based morphometry (VBM) to investigate brain anatomy changes related to the present clinical phenotype. CONTRIBUTION OF THE STUDY In the past few years, {{there has been a lot}} of controversy concerning structural MRI findings in TLE. Most of the studies looked for informative brain changes in epilepsy with MTS compared with healthy controls. This study is the first to take into consideration all clinical aspects of TLE together -­‐ mesial temporal sclerosis, focal cortical dysplasia and <b>cryptogenic</b> <b>epilepsy.</b> MATERIAL AND METHODS In-­‐vivo anatomical brain imaging data (MRI at 1. 5 T) was acquired in patients with clinical diagnosis of temporal lobe epilepsy. TLE patients were divided in three groups according to radiological description of brain MRI findings -­‐ mesial temporal sclerosis [MTS_group], focal cortical dysplasia [Dysplasia_group] and <b>cryptogenic</b> <b>epilepsy</b> [NoMRI_group] and compared with healthy volunteers. VBM technique was used to identify brain tissues alterations (GM and WM). RESULTS We demonstrate that MTS showed similar grey and white matter volumes reduction in the hippocampus, thalamus and cerebellum ipsilateral to the epileptogenic focus when compared with <b>cryptogenic</b> <b>epilepsy</b> patients and healthy controls. The focal cortical dysplasia patients showed grey matter volume loss restricted to the thalamus...|$|E
40|$|SummaryA {{meta-analysis}} {{was performed}} on three case controlled studies which {{examined the relationship between}} latent toxoplasmosis gondii infection in the immunocompetent host and <b>cryptogenic</b> <b>epilepsy.</b> Further comparison was also made by examining the seroprevalence of toxoplasmosis rates for 17 various countries, cities or regions against the prevalence rates for epilepsy in those regions. ResultsThe results for the meta-analysis showed a log-odds ratio of 4. 8 which approximates to a similar relative risk, (CI 2. 6 to 7. 8), with CI for all three studies being above 1. Seroprevalence rates for toxoplasmosis and prevalence rates of epilepsy showed a strong association (p< 0. 001). DiscussionThe prevalence of toxoplasmosis {{is an important factor in}} the prevalence of epilepsy with a probable link in the cryptogenic epilepsies. An area with a reduced burden of toxoplasmosis will also have a reduced burden of epilepsy. Neuropathophysiology findings from various studies show a common physical relationship of microglial nodule formation in Toxoplasma gondii infection and epilepsy. This analysis raises the possibility that one of the many causes of epilepsy may be an infectious agent, or that <b>cryptogenic</b> <b>epilepsy</b> may be a consequence of latent toxoplasmosis infection. This raises the possibility that public health measures to reduce toxoplasmosis infection may also result in a reduction in epilepsy...|$|E
40|$|AbstractObjectivesApproximately {{two-thirds of}} the {{patients}} with newly diagnosed partial epilepsy remained on their first antiepileptic drug (AED) for 2 years in clinical practice. We aimed to analyze retention on the first AED for 2 years in newly diagnosed <b>cryptogenic</b> partial <b>epilepsy</b> patients in clinical practice and whether the presence of epileptiform discharges on the initial EEG was a predictor {{of the failure of}} retention on the first AED. MethodsFor the purpose of this study, we retrospectively reviewed epilepsy database. On the Epilepsy Database, we found 495 newly diagnosed epilepsy patients who had been followed up for at least 2 years. Of these 495 newly diagnosed epilepsy patients, 172 patients had <b>cryptogenic</b> partial <b>epilepsy.</b> The outcome of this study was the retention rate for the first AED for 2 years. In addition, we analyzed the retention on first AED according to {{the presence or absence of}} epileptiform discharges on the initial EEG using Kaplan–Meier survival analysis. ResultsOverall, retention rate on the first AED for 2 years was 51 %. The main lesion of retention failure was a lack of tolerance. The presence of epileptiform discharges on the initial EEGs was significantly related to the failure of retention on the first AED (p= 0. 003). ConclusionsIn newly diagnosed <b>cryptogenic</b> partial <b>epilepsy,</b> overall retention on the first AED was not significantly different from that in newly diagnosed partial epilepsy.

40|$|Autoantibodies to {{glutamic acid}} decarboxylase (GADA) have been {{associated}} {{to a wide range}} of neurologic conditions, including epilepsy. However, the spectrum of epileptic conditions associated with GADA is not completely established. We aimed to determine the occurrence of GADA in a large series of patients with different epilepsy types. Moreover, we assessed whether specific subgroups of patients are associated to GAD autoimmunity. METHODS: GADA were measured by radioimmunoassay in a series of consecutive unselected epileptic patients observed over a 2 -years-period. Patients with neuromuscular features, acute or subacute encephalopathic course, cognitive deterioration or psychiatric symptoms were excluded. RESULTS: Two hundred thirty-three patients (121 women, mean age: 29. 3 years; range: 6 - 78) were recruited. There were eighty-three (35. 6 %) patients with idiopathic (66 generalized, 17 focal) epilepsy; fifty-nine (25. 3 %) with cryptogenic (52 focal, 7 generalized) epilepsy, and ninety-one (39. 0 %) with symptomatic (75 focal, 16 generalized) epilepsy. GADA were detected in six (2. 58 %) patients. Two had idiopathic generalized epilepsy associated with diabetes mellitus type 1 (DM 1); the other four patients suffered from <b>cryptogenic</b> temporal <b>epilepsy</b> and no history or signs of DM 1. GADA positive patients could not be distinguished by seizure frequency or number of AEDs. However, in these cases, the mean epilepsy duration (8. 5 +/- 5. 0 years) was shorter compared to the other 48 GADA-negative patients with <b>cryptogenic</b> focal <b>epilepsy</b> (17. 3 +/- 9. 6) (p< 0. 0001). CONCLUSIONS: We confirm that GAD autoimmunity may be associated with some forms of epilepsy.

The aim {{of the study was to}} compare the intellectual and cognitive func-tions between children with newly diagnosed cryptogenic par-tial epilepsy (CPE) children and the control healthy group. Material and methods: 184 participants, 89 patients with cryptogenic partial epilepsy and 95 healthy children and ado-lescents, with ages ranging from 6 - 16 years were assessed on neuropsychological tests of general intellectual functioning and selected cognitive skills. Results: There were significant differences found between groups for four examined functions. Children with CPE scored significantly lower in verbal and categorial fluency, visuocon-structional tasks, learning and memory than group of healthy children. There was no differences in general IQ level.

40|$|RATIONALE: The aim of {{this study}} is to {{investigate}} efficacy and tolerability of topiramate (TPM) add-on therapy in Drug resistant (DR) Localization Related Epilepsies. METHODS: Forty-two patients (22 M and 20 F) affected by DR Localization Related Epilepsies entered the study after informed consent. Mean age was 32. 3 years (range 17 - 59). Twenty four patients (57. 1 %) were affected by Symptomatic Localization Related Epilepsies and 18 (42. 9 %) by <b>Cryptogenic</b> Localization Related <b>Epilepsies.</b> All patients were already treated with 14 antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) with plasma levels within therapeutic ranges. TPM was given as add-on treatment with doses ranging from 150 to 600 mg/day. After TPM titration all patients entered a follow-up period lasting at least 6 months (mean 9. 8 months). Patients were considered responders when seizures showed a 2 50 % reduction with respect to the 6 -month period preceding TPM add-on. RESULTS: In the whole group responders were 26 (61. 9 %) with 3 patients (7. 1 %) completely seizure free. No significant differences in seizure response were observed between Symptomatic and <b>Cryptogenic</b> <b>Epilepsies.</b> Side effects were reported in 13 patients (31. 0 %), consisting mainly of weight reduction. This phenomenon was generally transient and did not lead to discontinuation of TPM therapy.

40|$|Research on {{comparative}} efficаcy and tolerability of monotherapy with Depakine chronosphere, drugs of Carbamazepine {{group with}} extended release and oxcarbazepine in symptomatic and <b>cryptogenic</b> focal <b>epilepsy</b> {{has been conducted}} at Svt. Luka’s Institute of Child Neurology and Epilepsy (ICNE) (Moscow). This retrospective study covers {{a random sample of}} patients treated in ICNE in the period from December  1, 2013 to September 1, 2014.  The study included 131 patients aged 1 to 18 years with symptomatic and <b>cryptogenic</b> focal <b>epilepsy</b> receiving treatment with one of the study drugs in monotherapy: group 1 – monotherapy with Depakine chronosphere (n = 56); group 2 – monotherapy with drugs of carbamazepine group with extended release (n = 55); group 3 – monotherapy with oxcarbazepine (trileptal) (n = 20). The obtained results allow us to conclude that the effectiveness of Depakin chronosphere, carbamazepine with extended release and oxcarbazepine in monotherapy of symptomatic and <b>cryptogenic</b> focal <b>epilepsy</b> was comparable (statistically significant differences in efficacy were not found). However, carbamazepine was awarded the highest frequency of seizures aggravation. Drugs showed approximately same tolerability (statistically significant differences in tolerability were not found). However, withdrawal of the drug due to side effects was the rarest in Depakine (3. 5 %), and withdrawal due to intolerance was higher in carbamazepine and oxcarbazepine (5 and 10 % respectively). Depakinum and oxcarbazepine had the best results in the blocking of pathological activity on the electroencephalogram, whereas carbamazepine was clearly inferior to them. In this regard, complete clinical-electroencephalographic remission (lasting 12 months or more) was achieved under treatment of Depakine chromosphere in 21. 5 % of cases, oxcarbazepi on therapy for 12 months was similar in all study drugs. Considering that the objective of epilepsy treatment is to achieve complete control over seizures, or at least substantially reduce and weaken them in the absence of significant side effects that disturb the patient’s quality of life, it can be concluded that the best treatment results were obtained in group of depakine chronosphere therapy. </p...|$|R
40|$|We used POINTER {{to perform}} {{segregation}} analysis of <b>cryptogenic</b> <b>epilepsy</b> in 1, 557 three-generation families (probands and their parents, siblings, and offspring) ascertained from voluntary organizations. Analysis {{of the full}} data set indicated that the data were most consistent with an autosomal dominant (AD) model with 61 % penetrance of the susceptibility gene. However, subsequent analyses revealed that the patterns of familial aggregation differed markedly between siblings and offspring of the probands. Risks in siblings were consistent with an autosomal recessive (AR) model and inconsistent with an AD model, whereas risks in offspring were inconsistent with an AR model and more consistent with an AD model. As a further test {{of the validity of}} the AD model, we used sequential ascertainment to extend the family history information in the subset of families judged likely to carry the putative susceptibility gene because they contained at least three affected individuals. Prevalence of idiopathic/cryptogenic epilepsy was only 3. 7 % in newly identified relatives expected to have a 50 % probability of carrying the susceptibility gene under an AD model. Approximately 30 % (i. e., 50 % x 61 %) were expected to be affected under the AD model resulting from the segregation analysis.

40|$|Objective To {{describe}} the electroclinical features {{and the long-term}} outcomes of epilepsy in a large cohort {{of males and females}} with Down syndrome who developed epilepsy in childhood. Study design Subjects with Down syndrome and <b>cryptogenic</b> <b>epilepsy</b> with onset in childhood were identified retrospectively from the databases of 16 Italian epilepsy centers over a 40 -year period. For each subject, age at onset of seizures, seizure semiology and frequency, electroencephalography characteristics, treatment with antiepileptic drugs, and long-term clinical and electroencephalography outcomes were analyzed. Results A total of 104 subjects (64 males [61. 5 %], 40 females [38. 5 %]) were identified. Seizure onset occurred within 1 year of birth in 54 subjects (51. 9 %), between 1 and 12 years in 42 subjects (40. 4 %), and after 12 years in 8 subjects (7. 7 %). Males had a younger age of seizure onset than females. Of the 104 subjects, 51 (49. 0 %) had infantile spasms (IS), 35 (33. 7 %) had partial seizures (PS), and 18 (17. 3 %) had generalized seizures (GS). Febrile seizures were recorded in 5 (4. 8 %) subjects. Intractable seizures were observed in 23 (22. 1 %) subjects, including 5 (9. 8 %) with IS, 8 (44. 4 %) with PS, and 10 (31. 3 %) with GS.

40|$|Purpose: To {{study the}} {{familial}} occurrence of epilepsy {{in children with}} newly diagnosed multiple unprovoked seizures. Methods: Between August 1988 and September 1992, 462 children with two or more unprovoked seizures {{were included in the}} prospective Dutch Study of Epilepsy in Childhood. Seizures and epilepsy syndromes of probands were classified according to the International Classifications. Probands with at least 1 first-degree relative with epilepsy were selected. Seizures and syndromes of their relatives were classified using medical files and telephone interviews. Results: In 42 % of the probands, the epilepsy was classified as localization-related, in 57 % as generalized, and in 1 % as undetermined whether focal or generalized. The 47 (10. 2 %) children with at least 1 first-degree relative with epilepsy less frequently had localization-related epilepsy (23 %) and more often had generalized epilepsy (77 %) as compared with the total group Of probands. Fifty-eight first-degree and 21 other relatives had epilepsy. Thirty-three of the 40 (83 %) first-degree relatives with idiopathic or <b>cryptogenic</b> <b>epilepsy</b> had the same seizure type as the proband, but detailed information about their seizures was sometimes difficult to obtain. Of the 12 first-degree relatives with epilepsy syndromes classifiable according to the International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) 7 (58 %) had the same syndrome as the proband. Conclusions: In 10 % of children with newly diagnosed epilepsy, the condition is familial. Relatively more often, these children have generalized epilepsy syndromes as compared with children with a negative family history. Most of the relatives with idiopathic or <b>cryptogenic</b> <b>epilepsy</b> had the same seizure type as the proband.

40|$|Children with {{a history}} of {{epilepsy}} are almost six-times more likely than their unaffected siblings to be referred for speech or language therapy. However, the abnormalities in neural pathway that cause these delays are poorly understood. We recorded evoked fields using whole-head magnetoencephalography during real and non-word visual and auditory rhyme tasks in 15 children with non-localized <b>cryptogenic</b> <b>epilepsy.</b> Basic phonological and orthographic language skills were assessed using Woodcock-Johnson Test of Achievement subtests. Dynamic statistical parameter mapping was used with individual participant magnetic resonance images. Significant cortical activity was visualized on average and performance weighted maps. For the auditory rhyme tasks, bilateral primary and secondary auditory cortices, the superior temporal sulcus and insular cortex were activated early with later increases in left hemisphere activity. Visual rhyme tasks evoked early bilateral primary and secondary occipital cortical and angular gyri activity followed by later activation of the planum temporale and supramarginal gyri and the left ventral occipitotemporal area. For the auditory rhyme tasks, performance weighted maps demonstrated that early right hemisphere activation was associated with poorer reading skills while later activity was associated with better reading skills; for the left hemisphere, greater early activation of the secondary auditory cortex, including the planum temporale, was related to better reading skills while relatively later activation of these areas was associated with poorer reading skills. For the visual rhyme tasks, greater activity in the bilateral ventral occipitotemporal and insular areas and angular and supramarginal gyri were associated with better performance.

RESULTS: A total of 104 subjects (64 males [61. 5 %], 40 females [38. 5 %]) were identified. Seizure onset occurred within 1 year of birth in 54 subjects (51. 9 %), between 1 and 12 years in 42 subjects (40. 4 %), and after 12 years in 8 subjects (7. 7 %). Males had a younger age of seizure onset than females. Of the 104 subjects, 51 (49. 0 %) had infantile spasms (IS), 35 (33. 7 %) had partial seizures (PS), and 18 (17. 3 %) had generalized seizures (GS). Febrile seizures were recorded in 5 (4. 8 %) subjects. Intractable seizures were observed in 23 (22. 1 %) subjects, including 5 (9. 8 %) with IS, 8 (44. 4 %) with PS, and 10 (31. 3 %) with GS. CONCLUSION: <b>Cryptogenic</b> <b>epilepsy</b> in Down syndrome may develop {{during the first year of}} life in the form of IS or, successively, as PS or GS. Electroclinical features of IS resemble those of idiopathic West syndrome, with a favorable response to treatment with adrenocorticotropic hormone seen. Patients experiencing PS and GS may be resistant to therapy with antiepileptic drug...|$|E
40|$|Abstract We {{reviewed}} {{the results of}} imaging studies on 111 children and adolescents with partial epilepsy to determine which imaging procedure had the greatest sensitivity and specificity for partial epilepsy in this age range. All cases were classified as idiopathic, lesional, and <b>cryptogenic</b> <b>epilepsy</b> based on the 1989 International League Against Epilepsy Classification. All patients had magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and 98 also had computed tomography (CT). Thirty patients with negative CT had MRI lesions that were most likely {{the cause of the}} epilepsy, and the initial diagnosis of cryptogenic partial epilepsy was changed to lesional partial epilepsy. We concluded that CT use is unwarrantedly common. MRI should be considered the procedure of first choice. CT has a complementary role, and functional neuroimaging should be encouraged...|$|E
40|$|AbstractPurposeIctal {{piloerection}} is an infrequent seizure semiology that {{is commonly}} overlooked as an ictal epileptic manifestation. Piloerection {{is considered to}} be principally caused by temporal lobe activity although frontal and hypothalamic seizure origins have been reported. The described etiology has shown a wide variety of structural causes such as mesial temporal sclerosis, tumors, posttraumatic, cavernomas and <b>cryptogenic</b> <b>epilepsies.</b> MethodsWe retrospectively reviewed the incidence of ictal piloerection in the clinical records of patients who underwent video-EEG monitoring (VEEGM) between 2007 and 2013 in a multicenter cooperative study. All patients presented refractory epilepsies and were evaluated with a protocol that included brain MRI, neuropsychology and VEEGM. ResultsA total of 766 patients were evaluated in four tertiary centers in Spain. Five patients showed piloerection as principal seizure semiology (prevalence 0. 65 %). The mean age at seizure onset was 39. 6 years and the average epilepsy duration was 5. 2 years (range 2 – 14) before diagnosis. Four patients were additionally examined with FDG-PET and/or SPECT-SISCOM. All presented temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), three right-sided and two left-sided. A typical unilateral hippocampal sclerosis was described in 3 cases. The etiology detected in all cases was limbic encephalitis. Three had LGI 1, one anti-Hu, and another Ma 2 antibodies. ConclusionOur series describes a so far not well-recognized autoimmune association of pilomotor seizures to limbic encephalitis. This etiology should be ruled out through a comprehensive diagnostic work-up even in cases of long-lasting TLE with typical hippocampal atrophy on MRI...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: In women {{younger than}} 45 years, {{a new form}} of {{encephalitis}} associated with ovarian teratoma and presenting with seizures and psychiatric symptoms has been described. Most patients have antibodies to NR 1 /NR 2 heteromers of the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR). OBJECTIVE: To assess the frequency and significance of antibodies to NMDAR in otherwise unexplained new-onset epilepsies in young women. DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. SETTING: University department of epileptology. PATIENTS: From January 1, 2005, to June 30, 2007, we identified 19 female patients aged 15 to 45 years with unexplained new-onset epilepsy. In addition, we studied 61 cerebrospinal fluid-serum sample pairs from patients with other <b>cryptogenic</b> <b>epilepsies</b> and 11 cerebrospinal fluid-serum sample pairs from surgically treated patients with epilepsy with no evident encephalitic abnormalities. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Antibodies to NMDAR and characteristics of affected patients. RESULTS: Five of the 19 patients had antibodies against NMDAR. These patients had diffuse cerebral dysfunction and seizure origins. Psychiatric symptoms and pleocytosis were significantly associated with this group of patients. The disease course was episodic, in part relapsing-remitting, with full recoveries either spontaneously or after corticosteroid or intravenous immunoglobulin treatments. Only 1 patient had a neoplasm (multiple neuroendocrine tumors that included the ovaries) identified to date. In the control series, one 22 -year-old man with a cryptogenic, severely encephalopathic seizure disorder was NMDAR antibody positive, and he also recovered fully. CONCLUSIONS: Anti-NMDAR encephalitis accounts for a relevant proportion of otherwise unexplained new-onset epilepsies. Patients harboring NMDAR antibodies usually have prominent psychiatric symptoms and pleocytosis, and they may develop hypoventilation. Anti-NMDAR encephalitis is not always paraneoplastic...|$|R
40|$|The {{relationship}} between severe myoclonic epilepsy of infancy (SMEI or Dravet syndrome) {{and the related}} syndrome SMEI-borderland (SMEB) with mutations in the sodium channel alpha 1 subunit gene SCN 1 A is well established. To explore the phenotypic variability associated with SCN 1 A mutations, 188 patients {{with a range of}} epileptic encephalopathies were examined for SCN 1 A sequence variations by denaturing high performance liquid chromatography and sequencing. All patients had seizure onset within the first 2 years of life. A higher proportion of mutations were identified in patients with SMEI (52 / 66; 79 %) compared to patients with SMEB (25 / 36; 69 %). By studying a broader spectrum of infantile epileptic encephalopathies, we identified mutations in other syndromes including <b>cryptogenic</b> generalized <b>epilepsy</b> (24 %) and <b>cryptogenic</b> focal <b>epilepsy</b> (22 %). Within the latter group, a distinctive subgroup designated as severe infantile multifocal epilepsy had SCN 1 A mutations in three of five cases. This phenotype is characterized by early onset multifocal seizures and later cognitive decline. Knowledge of an expanded spectrum of epileptic encephalopathies associated with SCN 1 A mutations allows earlier diagnostic confirmation for children with these devastating disorders. Louise A.
