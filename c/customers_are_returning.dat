Web analytics is the measurement, analysis, collection and reporting of web data for purposes of understanding and optimising web usage. Google analytics are widely used through Digital Marketing and Promotions as it allows a brand or organisations marketing department the ability to track the amount of traffic and attention ads or promotions are gaining online while also extending {{the ability to use}} this information for better placement of online advertising or promotions. This information makes it easier to understand and tailor the content or promotions a business uploads on their digital platforms across the internet weather it be Social media, web pages, search engines or mobile devices. Using web analytic tools such as Google Analytics allows business to view information on their customer base such as age groups, geographic locations and how long customers are spending on their promotional platforms. This information gives the ability to segment markets easily and target specific digital promotions to specific audiences i.e. 35-45 year old males, living in Sydney, Australia. It also allows business or organisations to see if these <b>customers</b> <b>are</b> <b>returning</b> to visit promotions or content or if they are single unique viewers {{or in the case of}} social media if these customers have seen a promotion and in return subscribed to the businesses page or online channel.|$|E

In this paper, we aim to explore {{the definition of the}} concept of quality in logistics service and its associated dimensions by constructing a conceptual model and test it empirically. A survey was conducted in Singapore with 2333 logistics service providers and customers from Singapore Logistics Association and Singapore&# 039;s National Shipper Council. A total of 171 questionnaires including 86 from logistics service providers and 85 <b>customers</b> <b>were</b> <b>returned.</b> After the process of exploratory factor analysis followed by confirmatory factor analysis, we found that the revised model of five factors and 20 items of logistics service quality (LSQ) is valid and reliable to measure the quality of logistics service.

5|$|Despite the {{problems}} of the press launch day, a more positive response was expected from the 20,000 members of the public who attended the remaining two days of the launch event to try out the C5 on the Alexandra Palace test track. Sinclair reported the day after the event that its switchboard had been overwhelmed by enquirers, and it expected that all 2,700 units from the first production run would be sold by the following Monday. Setting a pattern that would be repeated throughout the C5's short commercial life, this prediction was wildly optimistic; less than 200 were sold during the Alexandra Palace event. However, sales picked up as mail order forms – which had been sent to all of Sinclair's computer <b>customers</b> – <b>were</b> <b>returned</b> with fresh orders.

40|$|Reusable {{packages}} are logistic items {{used for the}} shipments of goods from a producer to its customers and which, once the goods have been consumed by the <b>customers,</b> <b>are</b> to <b>be</b> <b>returned</b> to the producer. This doctoral thesis addresses the strategic design and the operational management of large independent reverse networks for their return flows when fixed transportation costs apply. At the strategic level, we identify the economic logic by which the allocation of the <b>customers</b> should <b>be</b> made and the optimal shipment sizes determined. We then deal with {{the issues of the}} size of the fleet of reusable packages and of the use and locations of intermediary facilities. We further discuss the impacts of having a standard fleet of packages when compared to a heterogeneous fleet and of capacity limits on transportation. At the operational level, we tackle the problem of the coordination of the flows. Our main contribution is to show that, in large granular networks, finding very good solutions to this problem is relatively easy and natural. We suggest a myopic heuristic procedure to solve this problem and derive lower bounds on the optimal cost. We also evaluate the cost impact of using a discrete review policy instead of a continuous policy and we finally discuss the impact of variability and lead times in transportation. Although the insights are derived for reverse networks, the assumptions used in this thesis are relatively general. The models could easily be applied on delivery networks or integrated forward and reverse networks. (ECON 3) [...] UCL, 201...|$|R

Target Canada enjoyed a strong opening, but subsequent results were disappointing, dragging down its parent company's second quarter results. Despite the initial high traffic at Target's new stores, <b>customers</b> <b>were</b> not <b>returning</b> frequently enough to these stores to buy the basic household items, as that market was dominated by entrenched Canadian grocery and drug retail chains such as Loblaws, Shoppers Drug Mart, and Walmart Canada. In addition while Target Canada aimed to have its customers do [...] "one-stop shopping", Canadian consumers generally pick and choose between different retailers' strengths. While Target Canada stores were said to be an improvement over the untidy Zellers stores, some Canadians lamented that they missed the deals found at Zellers.|$|R

While they are one of the closest families to nature throughout the whole novel, akin to most of the Indians, they live in the same one bedroom shack built in the 17th century, and the children often watch the adults' sexual activity. However, {{by the end of the}} book, at least some of the Turlocks have risen out of poverty. The head of the Turlock family by 1978 is a wealthy real estate broker, selling waterside properties to a well-heeled clientele; one of his <b>customers</b> <b>is</b> a <b>returning</b> member of the Steed family.

40|$|It is {{well-known}} that selling different goods {{in a single}} bundle can significantly increase revenue, even when the valuations for the goods are independent. However, bundling is no longer profitable if the goods have high production costs. To overcome this challenge, we introduce a new mechanism, Pure Bundling with Disposal for Cost (PBDC), where after buying the bundle, the <b>customer</b> <b>is</b> allowed to <b>return</b> any subset of goods for their production cost. We derive both distribution-dependent and distribution-free guarantees on its profitability, which improve previous techniques. Our distribution-dependent bound suggests that the firm should never price the bundle such that the profit margin is less than 1 / 3 of the expected welfare, while also showing that PBDC is optimal for {{a large number of}} independent goods. Our distribution-free bound suggests that on the distributions where PBDC performs worst, individual sales perform well. Finally, we conduct extensive simulations which confirm that PBDC outperforms other simple pricing schemes overall. Comment: 40 page...|$|R

40|$|One of the {{consequences}} of <b>customer</b> product <b>returns</b> <b>is</b> that they can increase retail costs and with supermarkets increasing their online and in-store non-food market share, <b>returns</b> <b>are</b> becoming one of the most topical issues in the industry. This paper is relevant to the field of reverse logistics which is becoming a crucial channel within the retail supply chain, involving the integration of information, transportation, warehousing and product handling. With liberal ‘no quibble returns guarantees’, the scale of the problem is set to rise. Typically in Europe the consumer can return any defective product through a store or direct by post (for those purchased online) to the retailer within 14 days and request a replacement or a credit. The product doesn't have to be defective and so the major consumer areas generating <b>returns</b> <b>is</b> non-food products, particularly electrical products sold in-store and online. The costs of retail <b>returns</b> <b>are</b> becoming more and more important both in terms of the profitability for retailers and the need to manage down the transportation, warehousing and handling costs associated with these large scale returns operations. A fundamental issue therefore is to understand how better to manage returns processes. <br/...|$|R
