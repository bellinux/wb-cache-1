Butterfly valves are used as a safety element in the energy industry, petrochemical industry, in steam lines etc. The paper describes the theoretical determination of the control torque on the <b>closure</b> <b>element,</b> the torque causes the opening and closing of butterfly valve. Determination of this torque depends on many factors, geometry of the <b>closure</b> <b>element,</b> misalignment to the axis of fluid flow, control method of valve, method of imposition of the moving member and of course on the operating parameters.

40|$|NOVELTY - The {{apparatus}} has header that {{is set to}} {{make the}} heavier and lighter liquid phases flow along outer side surface of a third tube (8) as far as first <b>closure</b> <b>element</b> (13). The third tube is provided with second side openings for directly connecting {{the first and second}} meatus. The heavier liquid phase is maintained at lower portion of the first meatus due to gravity and lighter liquid phase is maintained at upper portion of the first meatus until the liquid phases fall into a fourth tube (9). The heavier liquid phase is collectible through a collection hole (12). USE - Apparatus e. g. reactor/separator for synthesizing and separating synthesis products e. g. gaseous phase and heavier and lighter liquid phases on catalytic bed, used in production of biodiesel. ADVANTAGE - Since heavier liquid phase is maintained at lower portion of the first meatus due to gravity and lighter liquid phase is maintained at upper portion of the first meatus, sedimentation separation of the liquid phases is improved. The structure of the apparatus is simplified and the apparatus is constructed easily. The efficacy and use of catalyst are maximized.

A second tube (1 ') is arranged adjacent to second end of the first tube. A first <b>closure</b> <b>element</b> is provided with a through hole for sole passage of the second liquid and of the gaseous phase. A third tube is affixed to first end of second tube. A first meatus is set between second tube and the third tube. The fourth tube is set inside the third tube so as to define a second meatus between the third tube and the fourth tube. A separation zone is set between the heavier and lighter liquid phases. A collection hole is set in the second tube to collect the heavier liquid phase. The third tube is set with first side openings at first end, and is set with a header for collecting the liquid phases originating from the synthesis module. The first meatus is directly inserted into the third tube and subsequently into the fourth tube. A control system is set between the liquid phases, to check and maintain interface level below {{the upper end of the}} first side openings. The control system has interface level indicator that is connected to the second tube by second side holes envisaged in side surface of the second tube. One of the second side holes is arranged in proximity of the first <b>closure</b> <b>element</b> and other is positioned above the upper end of the first side openings. The protrusions are arranged along cylindrical side surface of the third tube, and are separated by spaces for passage of the liquid phases from the header to the first meatus. A redistribution module (M 3) is set to redistribute the lighter liquid phase and gaseous phase originating from the fourth tube. A fifth tube (1 ") is arranged adjacent to second end of the second tube. The <b>closure</b> <b>element</b> is set with a central perforated area. A sixth tube (14) is set to descent and release of the gaseous phase.

40|$|The {{problem of}} glass {{strength}} {{arises from the}} increasingly spread use of the material in building. Due to its high transparency, glass has been always used as <b>closure</b> <b>element,</b> {{but in recent years}} a tendency of using it for structural purpose is growing rapidly. In addition, glass provides challenging solutions for conservation of archaeological heritage. These reasons require a deep investigation on failure mechanisms of glass and above all on its resistance to tensile stress. Since 1920, linear elastic fracture mechanics allowed understanding the reasons of the low tensile strength values registered in glass. It seems that {{this is due to the}} propagation, even very slow, of surface microdefects induced by manufacturing processes. Later, physical theories empirically founded further investigated on the processes of rupture in glass, observing that microdefects may evolve up to structural failure not only for a stress increase but also as consequence of chemical-physical interaction with surrounding environment. Most of prediction models which aim at evaluating a glass element lifetime are based on empirical laws. The parameters of those theories are related to the influence of environment but their values are provided by the literature only within limited ranges. However, the influence of environmental variables is complex and not secondary. In addition, in recent years, glass is being used in building even in non favorable climatic conditions. This latter is a challenging aim, considering the high aesthetic qualities of glass. For these reasons, the present thesis considered necessary to investigate on the microphysics and chemistry which determine the phenomenon of environmental corrosion, and this allowed identifying the physical variables which play the most influent role. Secondarily, an expression of failure time as explicit function of environmental variables is provided, focusing on temperature and relative humidity. Through parameter calibration, on the basis of four-point beam-bending tests, a lifetime curve is obtained for a given environment. This work arises on the one hand from a physical interest and it shows a scientific coherence, considering the strong influence of environmental variables, and on the other hand it is strictly connected to design purposes, since glass is being used in increasingly disparate climatic conditions. For this latter reason, to be able to express failure time as function of environment becomes a non negligible need...|$|E

The BOP received increased attention after the Macondo well blowout in 2010, and previous BOP safety and reliability performance estimates have been challenged.

The 'information age' has paradoxically seen the demise of the facade as an important signifier of cultural meaning. Homogeneous and minimally articulated skins have become silent and passive masks, creating anonymous and unresponsive urban environments. In contrast, the decorated facades of post-modem architecture have failed to address questions of meaning and representation in a serious and satisfactory way. Perhaps the problem is not solely one of economic constraints and misguided construction practices, but a lack of understanding and evaluation {{of the role of the}} skin, both as an architectural element, and as a social and cultural phenomenon. This thesis will use the ethnographic theories of Gottfried Semper as a basis for establishing themes that have persisted in the understanding and construction of <b>closure</b> <b>elements</b> since the earliest shelters of man. The issue of transparency and spatial depth will then be addressed as a modem social and architectural dilemma, inseparable from the problem of designing building facades.
