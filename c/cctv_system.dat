One 1980s mural remains on one of the platforms. The Central line platform works were substantially complete and a new Station Operations Room at top level opened. This enabled the entire <b>CCTV</b> <b>system</b> to be switched over to new recordable digital technology.

50|$|In the United Kingdom the Data Protection Act 1998 imposes legal {{restrictions}} on the uses of CCTV recordings and mandates the registration of <b>CCTV</b> <b>systems</b> with the Data Protection Agency.

In 2006–2007, modernization and expansion (for 200 more seats) of the international sector of the airport was carried out, including the installation of new passenger elevators and escalators {{as well as new}} luggage conveyor and equipment for customs control. In 2007, a renewed VIP hall was opened. In 2009, a new flight information system with 49 monitors was installed. The airport's security was upgraded, including the installation of a new <b>CCTV</b> <b>system</b> and screening equipment at the terminal's entrances.

40|$|Modern {{surveillance}} {{devices are}} increasingly being taken off private networks and placed onto networks connected via gateway to the Internet or into Wi-Fi based local area wireless networks (LAWN). The devices are also increasingly using IPv 4 and IPv 6 network stacks and some form of embedded processing or compute built in. Additionally, some specialist devices are using assistive technologies such as GPS or A-GPS. This paper explored the issues with use of the technologies in a networked environment, both wireless and internetworked. Analysis of these systems shows {{that the use of}} IP based <b>CCTV</b> <b>systems</b> carries greater risk than traditional <b>CCTV</b> <b>systems,</b> primarily due to the exposure to IP based vulnerabilities. Furthermore, Wi-Fi based IP <b>CCTV</b> <b>systems</b> are additionally susceptible to remote, physical denial of service attacks due to the broadcast nature of wireless communication systems. Interception of traffic is possible with IP based systems, and again, Wi-Fi IP based <b>CCTV</b> <b>systems</b> are more susceptible due to protocol vulnerabilities and lack of processing power. The paper concludes that more research is needed in this area to identify and classify generic vulnerabilities that these systems are vulnerable to, and to present a framework which can be used to mitigate the risk of adopting these systems...|$|R
40|$|Closed-Circuit Television (<b>CCTV)</b> <b>systems</b> {{are used}} in modern {{buildings}} for different purposes. By the use of smart cameras, dedicated safety or security-critical events {{that may lead to}} an alarm condition can be detected autonomously (e. g., safety events like fire or security events like glass break). Integrating <b>CCTV</b> <b>systems</b> into building automation systems provides the opportunity to react to critical events by, for example, informing the operator about the occurrence of such events, providing relevant video data, and most important concurrently initiating appropriate actions (e. g., smoke extraction in case of fire). This paper focuses on the integration of such smart camera systems into BACnet based networks. At first, a short introduction to BACnet and its interworking model is given. Afterwards, a possible way of integrating <b>CCTV</b> <b>systems</b> into BACnet is presented. The functionality of this model is shown by a proof-of-concept implementation which is also described in this paper. 1...|$|R

These networks often required a specific manufacturer’s camera, restricting the Highways Agency’s control over technology and cost.|$|E
