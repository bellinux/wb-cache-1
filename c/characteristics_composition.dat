5000|$|From 1919 to 1922, Itten {{taught at}} the Bauhaus, {{developing}} the innovative [...] "preliminary course" [...] which was to teach students the basics of material <b>characteristics,</b> <b>composition,</b> and color. [...] "Itten theorized seven types of color contrast and devised exercises to teach them. His color contrasts included (1) contrast by hue, (2) contrast by value, (3) contrast by temperature, (4) contrast by complements (neutralization), (5) simultaneous contrast (from Chevreuil), (6) contrast by saturation (mixtures with gray), and (7) contrast by extension (from Goethe)."(de) In 1920 Itten invited Paul Klee and Georg Muche to join him at the Bauhaus. He also published a book, The Art of Color, which describes these ideas as a furthering of Adolf Hölzel's color wheel. Itten's so called [...] "color sphere" [...] went on to include 12 colors. In 1924, Itten established the “Ontos Weaving Workshops” near Zurich, {{with the help of}} Bauhaus weaver Gunta Stölzl.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the effect of genetic polymorphism of kappa-casein, breed and seasonality on the physicochemical <b>characteristics,</b> <b>composition</b> and stability of milk in commercial dairy herds. A total of 879 milk and blood samples were collected from 603 Holstein and 276 Girolando cows, obtained during rainy and dry seasons. Milk samples were analyzed to determine the physicochemical <b>characteristics,</b> <b>composition</b> and ethanol stability, while blood samples were subjected to polymerase chain reaction to identify the kappa-casein genotype. The frequencies of genotypes AA, AB and BB of k-casein were respectively, 66. 83, 31. 84 and 1. 33 % for Holstein, and 71. 38, 27. 90 and 0. 72 % for the Girolando cows, respectively. The A allele was more frequent than the B allele, both for Holstein (0. 827 and 0. 173) and Girolando cows (0. 853 and 0. 147), respectively. Cows of AB and BB genotypes showed a higher milk fat content compared to the AA genotype. There was an interaction between breed and seasonality on the concentration of milk urea with higher values for Holstein and Girolando cows in the rainy and dry season, respectively. The levels of lactose, total solids, crude protein, true protein, casein and the casein:true protein ratio were higher during the dry season, while during the rainy season, the somatic cell count and milk urea concentration were higher. There was no association between milk stability and k-casein genotypes, but Holstein cows showed higher milk stability than Girolando cows, and milk was more stable during the rainy season than during the dry season...|$|E

The major design issues for WAG are reservoir characteristics and heterogeneity, rock and fluid <b>characteristics,</b> <b>composition</b> of injection gas, injection pattern, WAG ratio, three-phase relative permeability effects and flow dispersion.

The as-synthesized materials, hydrothermally prepared and presenting (SbO) (2) M 20 O 56 type structure (the so called M 1 -phase), were activated by different heat-treatments, characterized (XRD, SEM-EDS, HRTEM, V K-edge, Sb L- 1 - and K-edges XANES, EPR, XPS, NH 3 -TPD) and tested in propane partial oxidation. In general, the selectivity to acrylic acid (the most valuable product) was higher in K-containing MoVSbO catalysts.
