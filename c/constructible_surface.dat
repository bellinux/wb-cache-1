Stanbock-Fermore and his wife. The count also bought another building not far from the hotel at the Ligovskiy avenue. The author of the project was also A.P. Gemilian. Now there is a Ligovskiy building of the hotel.|$|E

We {{prove that}} if f : A [...] > R is etale, then the {{corresponding}} mapping between real Riemann surfaces S-r(f) : S-r(R/k) [...] > S-r(A/k) {{is a local}} homeomorphism. Several preparatory results are proved, as well. The most relevant among these are: (1) a Chevalley's theorem for real Riemann surfaces on the preservation of constructibility via S-r(f), and (2) {{an analysis of the}} closure operator on real Riemann <b>surfaces.</b> <b>Constructible</b> sets are dealt with by means of a suitable first-order language...|$|R
