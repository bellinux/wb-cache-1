2500|$|Although {{visitors}} may {{be surprised}} by the apparently large number of <b>cycle</b> <b>parking</b> facilities in Copenhagen, there {{is in fact a}} severe lack of available cycle stands, and among the subjective indicators measured by the city, bicycle parking fares worst, with only 29% being satisfied with the facilities. There are approximately 560.000 bicycles in the city of Copenhagen, more bicycles than people, yet they share only 48.000 bicycle stands. With a view to remedying the situation, in 2008 the Danish Cyclists Federation published a [...] "Bicycling Parking Manual" [...] with a number of guidelines. They are of immediate practical use to today's users but they also offer advice for city planners wishing to improve facilities in the future. A number of projects have been launched to ease Copenhagen's notorious shortage of bicycle parking spaces, particularly at transport hubs. While the city expects there will always be more bicycles in Copenhagen than parking spots, it hopes to increase satisfaction with bicycle parking significantly by 2025, through a coordinated effort to improve conditions and facilities.|$|E

50|$|In {{areas in}} which cycling is popular and encouraged, cycle-parking {{facilities}} using bicycle stands, lockable mini-garages, and patrolled <b>cycle</b> <b>parks</b> are used {{in order to reduce}} theft.

Reference is made to the recent OECD survey on the anticipated growth of nuclear power in the OECD countries.
