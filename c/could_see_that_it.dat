25|$|Captain Tracy {{and a small}} crew left Newburyport for Boston {{to take on a}} full crew for {{a six-month}} patrol. As the ship rounded Cape Ann, they spotted another sail. As the Yankee Hero was short-handed, Tracy decided to let it pass. However, some local sailors rendezvoused with them at sea and told them that several {{transports}} had been seen close to the Cape that day. Supplemented with fourteen of the local men, bringing his crew to 40 (other accounts say 52), Tracy set after the distant ship. When they had approached to within six miles, they <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was a ship of war, the HMS Milford. Still short-handed and ill-prepared for a fight, the Captain changed his mind again and ordered the ship around. However, the Milford had spotted them by this time and gave chase. Heavily outgunned and outmanned, the Yankee Hero's crew was decimated and the ship disabled. At least four of the crew were killed and thirteen wounded, including Captain Tracy.|$|E
60|$|The figure glided yet nearer, and I <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was trembling, and now {{its arms}} were {{extended}} also.|$|E
60|$|The {{trail was}} a {{well-defined}} one, and they <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> {{had been used}} only a short while before.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, anybody <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>that.</b> <b>It's</b> {{the image}} of you. And so is our Joey. You don't let your young ones favor your husbands much, Nancy; and yet you was not always so set against me. What's your notion letting Joey come to the Temple?" ...|$|R
60|$|He nodded, {{and though}} she had scored her point she <b>could</b> not <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> had any {{material}} bearing after all.|$|R
60|$|I <b>could</b> soon <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> {{was to be}} no {{false alarm}} this time, and that the tribes really meant business.|$|R
60|$|He {{was from}} the country. I <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>that.</b> <b>It</b> was written all over him, from his face to his shoes.|$|E
60|$|The man's brow grew {{black with}} anger. He was very angry, and I <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was with {{difficulty}} {{he kept his}} hands off me.|$|E
60|$|And so {{she went}} on talking about it and growing more and more troubled about it, until one <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was filling all her mind.|$|E
60|$|I {{was sorry}} I had spoken of the letter. I <b>could</b> readily <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> had worked Mr. Stillwell up to a fever heat.|$|R
60|$|Ned did {{not much}} like being left alone, {{but he made}} no objections, since he <b>could</b> readily <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was of the highest {{importance}} that they should learn if {{the man and his}} companion were watching for them.|$|R
6000|$|... "But {{our case}} was very peculiar. I <b>could</b> <b>see</b> {{afterwards}} <b>that</b> <b>it</b> needn't {{have been two}} months, if I {{had been willing to}} acknowledge at once that I was in the wrong. I waited till we met." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Where are you going, Frederick?" [...] called Lucia, {{from the}} window; {{she had been}} {{watching}} the interview anxiously enough, and <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> had ended well.|$|E
6000|$|Rupert was eyeing him sarcastically, and I <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> {{was on the}} tip of {{his tongue}} to say, inquiringly, [...] "Receiver of stolen goods, perhaps." [...] What he did say was: ...|$|E
60|$|He {{had taken}} {{out of his pocket}} a small, stout, leather-bound volume, and Flambeau, looking over his shoulder, <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was some book of old travels, and had a leaf turned down for reference.|$|E
60|$|For a minute, Ben did {{not seem}} to {{understand}} him, plainly as he spoke; then he turned an angry scarlet, and, with a reproachful glance at his mistress, opened the little drawer so <b>that</b> both <b>could</b> <b>see</b> all <b>that</b> <b>it</b> contained.|$|R
60|$|An icy blast {{that set}} them {{shivering}} went roaring through the wood, {{but they were}} too intent to heed it, and Curtis {{picked up one of}} the garments. He <b>could</b> <b>see</b> only <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was a jacket, for darkness was closing in suddenly.|$|R
6000|$|... "Very likely she's engaged; I've known a {{good many}} American girls, and they always were; but I <b>could</b> never <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> made any difference, upon my word! As for my being a good husband," [...] Mr. Touchett's visitor pursued, [...] "I'm not sure of that either. One can but try!" ...|$|R
60|$|Thus {{coming to}} it, our hero <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> {{was a large}} yawl-boat manned by half a score of black men for rowers, {{and that there were}} two {{lanterns}} in the stern-sheets, and three or four shovels.|$|E
60|$|As {{they came}} close above the {{stricken}} ship, they <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> would be but {{a question of}} minutes before the green horde would swarm across the armoured bulwarks to glut the ferocity of their bloodlust upon the defenders.|$|E
60|$|Even at {{the height}} at which they were standing, Roger <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was densely populated. Villages were {{scattered}} thickly, and the forest was restricted to patches, here and there, the greater portion of the land being under cultivation.|$|E
60|$|The poor lads were thinly clad for {{a summer}} walk, Jock had left his plaid behind him, and they were {{beginning}} to feel only too vividly <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was past supper-time, when they <b>could</b> dimly <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was past nine, and began to shout, but they soon found this severe and exhausting.|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> she {{considered}} <b>it</b> her duty beyond all other duties, and so said no more, knowing nothing of her religion beyond what your father told me." ...|$|R
60|$|They {{were saying}} good-night; {{and he had}} to smirk and smile, and pretend--to her above all--that he was happy, and he <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> she knew <b>it</b> was pretence.|$|R
60|$|He got up {{and opened}} a mud cupboard, from which he took a big steel trap. Twinkle <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was just like the trap papa had set to catch the woodchucks, only it seemed much bigger and stronger.|$|E
60|$|Thus {{coming to}} it, our hero <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> {{was a large}} yawl boat manned with half a score of black men for rowers, {{and there were two}} {{lanterns}} in the stern sheets, and three or four iron shovels.|$|E
60|$|I {{could bear}} no more. I am a tender-hearted man, and I made some excuse and got away. From the {{expression}} on the girl's face I <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was only a question of days before she gave her heart to this romantic newcomer.|$|E
60|$|I knocked. There was no answer. I {{tried the}} handle, {{and found the}} door unlocked. I walked in, and Stroeve {{followed}} me. The room was in darkness. I <b>could</b> only <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was an attic, with a sloping roof; and a faint glimmer, {{no more than a}} less profound obscurity, came from a skylight.|$|R
50|$|In {{order to}} {{highlight}} their puppetry skills, The Henson Company puppeteers created Rygel {{to be as}} small as possible, so the viewers <b>could</b> clearly <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was not a human being in a suit. Similarly, they made Pilot so large and shaped {{in such a way}} <b>that</b> <b>it</b> would be clear it was not a human, either.|$|R
5000|$|It's {{very hard}} to be for genocide, or against people who are against genocide, but I couldn't <b>see</b> {{anything}} in <b>that</b> resolution that could prevent any single drop of blood being shed. All I <b>could</b> <b>see</b> was <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was doing harm to the U.S., rather than to the perpetrators of the alleged genocide.|$|R
60|$|The {{four young}} oarsmen {{increased}} their stroke, and soon gained the point. Then the boat again came into full view and they <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was their own craft {{and that the}} colored man was rowing along at a good rate of speed.|$|E
60|$|Presently {{he was by}} {{the side}} of the wanderer, and <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was a maiden of ten or twelve years old, who somehow, even in the darkness, had not the air of one of the few {{inhabitants}} of that wild mountain district.|$|E
6000|$|... "I <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> {{was not my}} messenger, but {{a second}} one. Milord Hawkesbury caught the paper from his hand, and read it {{by the light of}} the {{carriage}} lamp. His face, monsieur, was as white as this plate, before he had finished.|$|E
6000|$|... "You know," [...] he began, as he wheeled a chair up to {{the fire}} for her, [...] "that man Griffiths doesn't like me. He never took {{to me from the}} first, I <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>that.</b> If <b>it</b> comes to <b>that,</b> I don't like Griffiths. He is one of those mean, {{suspicious}} sort of characters we could very well do without." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{think he}} was glad of it. Clearly indeed he was. He stayed {{a quarter of an}} hour. I <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> for him <b>it</b> was long. He's interested," [...] said Mrs. Stringham.|$|R
6000|$|... "Not exactly; but you <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> {{she meant}} <b>it.</b> Do {{you think it}} would do for them to change from their hotel, and go to the Grand Union or the States or Congress Hall?" ...|$|R
