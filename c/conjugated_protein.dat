50|$|On {{the basis}} of their {{chemical}} nature tumor markers can be <b>proteins,</b> <b>conjugated</b> <b>proteins,</b> peptides or carbohydrates. <b>Proteins</b> or <b>conjugated</b> <b>proteins</b> may be enzymes, hormones or fragments of proteins. Sequencing of genes for diagnostic purposes is mostly classified under the biomarker heading and is not treated here.|$|R

40|$|To {{determine}} whether {{the interaction of the}} TRH receptor with �-arrestin is necessary for TRH activation of MAPK, cells expressing either intact or truncated, internalization-defective TRH receptors were transfected with a �-arrestin-green fluorescent <b>protein</b> <b>conjugate.</b> In cells expressing the wild-type pituitary TRH receptor, TRH caused translocation of the �-arrestin-green fluorescent <b>protein</b> <b>conjugate</b> from the cytosol to the plasma membrane within 30 sec. After 5 min, the �-arrestin-green fluorescent <b>protein</b> <b>conjugate</b> was visible in vesicles, where it colocalized with rhodaminelabeled TRH.

50|$|A chromoprotein is a <b>conjugated</b> <b>protein</b> that {{contains}} a pigmented prosthetic group (or cofactor). A common example is hemoglobin, which contains a heme cofactor, which is the iron-containing molecule that makes oxygenated blood appear red. Other examples of chromoproteins include other hemochromes, cytochromes, phytochromes and flavoproteins.|$|E
50|$|Many {{proteins}} contain only {{amino acids}} {{and no other}} chemical groups, and they are called simple proteins. However, other kind of proteins yield, on hydrolysis, some other chemical component in addition to amino acids and they are called conjugated proteins. The non-amino part of a <b>conjugated</b> <b>protein</b> is usually called its prosthetic group. Most prosthetic groups are formed from vitamins. Conjugated proteins are classified {{on the basis of}} the chemical nature of their prosthetic groups.|$|E
5000|$|The Robert Hill Institute at the University of Sheffield, {{from which}} he {{received}} an honorary degree in 1990, was named after him. Hill was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 1946, his certificate of election reads: [...] Distinguished for his research on Haemoglobin and Photosynthesis. He {{was the first to}} demonstrate the reconstruction of haemoglobin from its components: globin and haematin. This was the first case of the splitting and reconstruction of a <b>conjugated</b> <b>protein.</b> He determined the properties and dissociation curve of myoglobin which explain the physiological function of the pigment. He also determined the structure and properties of several haematin compounds thereby aiding the study of their catalytic activities. He discovered a new approach to the biochemical study of photosynthesis which enabled him to demonstrate and to measure the evolution of oxygen by isolated chloroplasts exposed to light in the complete absence of CO2. This remarkable photochemical reaction was found by him to have the same properties as [...] "light reaction" [...] obtained with intact green cells in presence of CO2, and it led him to formulate an interesting working hypothesis of the mechanism of photosynthesis.|$|E
40|$|Glaucoma {{and other}} optic neuropathies are {{characterized}} by a loss of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), a cell layer located in the posterior eye segment. Several preclinical studies demonstrate that neurotrophins (NTs) prevent RGC loss. However, NTs are rarely investigated in the clinic due to various issues, such as difficulties in reaching the retina, the very short half-life of NTs, {{and the need for}} multiple injections. We demonstrate that NTs can be conjugated to magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs), which act as smart drug carriers. This combines the advantages of the self-localization of the drug in the retina and drug protection from fast degradation. We tested the nerve growth factor and brain-derived neurotrophic factor by comparing the neuroprotection of free versus <b>conjugated</b> <b>proteins</b> in a model of RGC loss induced by oxidative stress. Histological data demonstrated that the <b>conjugated</b> <b>proteins</b> totally prevented RGC loss, {{in sharp contrast to the}} equivalent dose of free proteins, which had no effect. The overall data suggest that the nanoscale MNP-protein hybrid is an excellent tool in implementing ocular drug delivery strategies for neuroprotection and therapy...|$|R
30|$|The {{present study}} {{investigated}} the role of SENP 3 in the global protein turnover related to SUMO 2 / 3 -targeted ubiquitination, and focused in particular on the SENP 3 regulation of the stability of Sp 1. Our findings provide a new explanation for the enrichment of Sp 1 protein in cancers and suggest a global regulation of SUMO 2 / 3 <b>conjugated</b> <b>proteins</b> whose levels may be tightly controlled by SENP 3 and RNF 4.|$|R
40|$|An Antigen is a substance, which, when {{introduced}} parenterally into an animal, induces {{the production}} of a specific serum globulin which has the unique property of combining specifically with the antigen. Most proteins are antigenic, but antigenicity is not confined only to <b>proteins.</b> Thus, <b>conjugated</b> <b>proteins</b> (Felton, 1934), polysaccharides (Avery, et al 1931), and lipids (Boivin et al, 1935) have shown to be antigenic. One can not state unequivocally what physical and chemical characteristics make a substance antigenic...|$|R
40|$|AbstractLysine-rich {{phosphorylated}} cystatin α (P-cystatin α) from newborn rat epidermis {{is a good}} substrate for epidermal transglutaminase (TGase) {{and also}} one of the component proteins of cornified envelope in the stratum corneum. Since the filaggrin linker segment peptide was efficiently conjugated with P-cystatin α and was mediated by epidermal TGase in the presence of Ca 2 + ions, filaggrin is a candidate for the glutamine-rich linkage protein to conjugate with lysine-rich P-cystatin α. A <b>conjugated</b> <b>protein</b> was formed by epidermal TGase in the activated condition with Ca 2 + ions and dithiothreitol. In contrast, the <b>conjugated</b> <b>protein</b> was not formed under chelated conditions with EDTA. The <b>conjugated</b> <b>protein</b> reacted positively with anti-P-cystatin α polyclonal antibody (PoAb). The <b>conjugated</b> <b>protein</b> and purified cornified envelope showed an inhibitory effect against papain and cathepsin L, but cathepsin B and H were not inhibited by these P-cystatin α conjugates. Although the component protein, P-cystatin α itself, inhibited cathepsin H strongly, these conjugated proteins inhibited specifically the cathepsin L family. The amino acid composition of cornified envelope protein and the <b>conjugated</b> <b>protein</b> of P-cystatin α and filaggrin linker segment peptide was not completely the same. The <b>conjugated</b> <b>protein</b> of P-cystatin α and filaggrin linker segment peptide showed the same inhibitory properties against cysteine proteinases as the cornified envelope. These findings suggest that the linkage protein between P-cystatin α and filaggrin linker segment peptide may be considered a model of cornified envelope, although skin cornified envelope may be conjugated with some additional proteins...|$|E

30|$|Fluorophores were {{conjugated}} to the diabody via the C-terminal cysteines. The {{protein in}} PBS/ 2  mM EDTA (pH  7.0) was incubated for 30  min at 37 °C with a 10 -fold molar excess of TCEP (Bond-Braker, Pierce Biotechnology, Rockford, IL, USA) before {{addition of a}} 20 -fold molar excess Alexa 488 -C 5 -maleimide (Life Technologies) for 2  h at room temperature (RT). Unconjugated fluorophore was removed by size exclusion chromatography using a Superdex 75 column, and the <b>conjugated</b> <b>protein</b> was concentrated using MWCO membrane spin filters (Vivaspin 2, MWCO 5000, Sartorius, Darmstadt, Germany).|$|E
40|$|An {{enzyme-linked}} immunosorbent assay {{has been}} established to measure anthrax antibody titers. The protective antigen component of anthrax toxin {{was used as the}} capture antigen. Two types of <b>conjugates</b> (<b>protein</b> A-horseradish peroxidase and anti-human immunoglobulin G plus immunoglobulin A plus immunoglobulin M-horseradish peroxidase) were tested. Results from {{enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay}} testing were compared with those from indirect hemagglutination titers on serum from vaccinees. The overall trend of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and indirect hemagglutination titers was significant. The enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay offered speed, precision, and reduced cost per test...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} verify the “radiation protection” effect of {{prosthetic}} groups in irradiated <b>conjugated</b> <b>proteins</b> {{and the influence of}} their electronic structure on intramolecular excitation transfer, two series of substances were examined. The first was composed of ferrihemoglobin and its constituents and the second was composed of similar hemoproteins with heme groups with major differences in electronic structure. The results point to a strong radiation protection effect of the heme groups and a dependence of radical yield of hemoproteins on the electronic structure of the heme. A possible interpretation of this latter effect is discussed...|$|R
40|$|The {{glycoprotein}} {{is a kind}} of <b>conjugated</b> <b>proteins</b> and is {{subdivided into}} mucin, mucoid and chondroprotein. The true mucin yield extraordinary glutinous or mucilaginons solutions rom which the mucin is precipitated by acetic acid. The present paper reports preliminary studies on the mucin of Loach, Misgumus anquillicandatus. Our observations clearly demonstrated that the protein in the mucin of Loach consists of the amino acids; cystine, glutamic acid, serine, glycin, lysin, valine, phenylalanine and the amino sugar of glucosamine. Further studies of the sugars in the mucin are being investigated...|$|R
40|$|Both nitroreductase and {{transglutaminase}} {{activities have}} been assayed in the 10 000 x g supernatant fluids of rat intestine homogenates after Triton X- 100 treatment. Incubation of 14 C-nitrofurantoin in the intestine extract yielded protein-bound 14 C-labeled products. Injection into rabbits of the <b>conjugated</b> <b>protein</b> similarly prepared with unlabeled nitrofurantoin elicited formation of antibodies against nitrofurantoin. These {{results suggest that}} intestinal metabolism and conjugation to protein of orally administered drugs {{may serve as a}} probable mechanism of drug allergy, and this may be accomplished by enzymatic coupling of relatively stable drug metabolites to protein carriers...|$|E
40|$|Fowls {{given one}} {{injection}} of 2, 4 -dinitrophenyl-bovine γ-globulin (DNP-BGG) intravenously or subcutaneously with complete Freund's adjuvant, or multiple injections intramuscularly, responded neither to the hapten nor to the carrier moieties of the antigen. DNP-BGG injected {{directly into the}} spleen gave rise to antibodies that precipitated with native BGG, in 0 · 9 per cent NaCl only, {{but not with the}} <b>conjugated</b> <b>protein.</b> Two subcutaneous injections of DNP-BGG mixed with complete adjuvant produced high levels of anti-DNP antibodies.

40|$|We have {{developed}} a technique for reversibly masking a peptide-targeting signal. A fluoresceinated derivative of the simian virus 40 large tumor antigen nuclear-targeting signal was synthesized and cross-linked to bovine serum albumin. The <b>conjugated</b> <b>protein</b> was efficiently transported into rat liver nuclei unless the peptide-targeting signal was sterically hindered by binding of an anti-fluorescein antibody. Addition of free 5 -aminofluorescein competed for antibody binding and rapidly restored nuclear accumulation of the derivatized bovine serum albumin. General use of hapten derivatization and anti-hapten antibodies for caging portions of macromolecular surfaces can be extended {{to a variety of}} proteins, including antibodies themselves...|$|E
40|$|Many <b>protein</b> <b>conjugates,</b> {{prepared}} in vitro with reactive simple chemicals, are highly effective reagents for inducing {{the formation of}} antibodies which are specific for the simple chemical components of the conjugates (1). Antibodies may also be formed directly in response to injections of certain simple chemicals, providing the simple substances used are capable of reacting in vivo to form <b>protein</b> <b>conjugates</b> (24). These generalities are only partly applicable to the induction of contact skin sensitivity. In order for simple chemicals to induce the latter hypersensitive state, the in ~vo formation of <b>protein</b> <b>conjugates</b> (6, 7) is also obligatory (5). However, with a few possible exceptions (8), <b>protein</b> <b>conjugates</b> {{prepared in}} ~itro have little, if any, capacity to induce contact skin sensitivity (9). Part of the present work {{is devoted to the}} presentation of evidence which supports and extends older observations (8, 9) concerning the unexpected inability of <b>protein</b> <b>conjugates,</b> made in tritro, to induce contact skin sensitivity.

50|$|A {{respiratory}} pigment is a molecule, such as hemoglobin in humans and other vertebrates, {{that increases the}} oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood. The four most common invertebrate {{respiratory pigment}}s are hemoglobin, haemocyanin, haemerythrin and chlorocruorin. Hemoglobin is bright red when oxygenated, and dark red(purplish) when deoxygenated, oxygenated haemocyanin is blue in color, deoxygenated it is almost colorless. Oxygenated chlorocruorin turns from green to red, whereas oxygenated haemerythrin is a violet to pink colour and colorless when deoxygenated. Any of various colored <b>conjugated</b> <b>proteins,</b> such as hemoglobin, occur in living organisms and function in oxygen transfer in cellular respiration.|$|R
40|$|Although {{penicillin}} G (PG) 1 {{has long}} been known to be a clinical allergen, the identity of the antigenic determinant groups responsible for hypersensitivity to PG is not clearly known. Such knowledge would be of importance since it would lead to the preparation of <b>conjugated</b> <b>protein</b> antigens useful as reagents to diagnose penicillin hypersensitivity. This information would make possible also the synthesis of low molecular weight univalent haptens which might be useful, therapeutically, to specifically inhibit antibody-dependent penicillin allergic reactions. Also, with the clear definition of the responsible antigenic determinant groups, the penicillin system may be employed as a model to study more general problems of human hypersensitivity...|$|E
40|$|Five protein {{fractions}} {{have been}} separated by paper electrophoresis from the plasma of the American cockroach. With {{the utilization of}} various staining procedures several of the plasma fractions were shown to be conjugated proteins. Two of these (fractions II and IV) are readily identifiable by their phospholipid, carbohydrate, and protein composition. A third <b>conjugated</b> <b>protein,</b> fraction III, is characterized by its high neutral lipid and sterol content. This lipoprotein is also sex-specific. Another fraction (I) contains neutral lipid, sterol, and protein but electrophoretically is more mobile than fraction III.

40|$|We {{present a}} {{straightforward}} and rapid {{surface acoustic wave}} (SAW) atomization-based technique for encapsulating proteins into 10 µm order particles composed of a biodegradable polymeric excipient, using bovine serum albumin (BSA) as an exemplar. Scans obtained from confocal microscopy provide qualitative proof of encapsulation and show the fluorescent <b>conjugated</b> <b>protein</b> to be distributed in a relatively uniform manner within the polymer shell. An ELISA assay of the collected particles demonstrates that the BSA survives the atomization, particle formation, and collection process with a yield of approximately 55 %. The SAW atomization universally gave particles with a textured morphology, and increasing the frequency and polymer concentration generally gave smaller particles (to 3 µm average) with reduced porosity...|$|E
40|$|Here, we {{show that}} oxygen and glucose {{deprivation}} (OGD) causes increased small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) - 1 and SUMO- 2 / 3 conjugation to substrate proteins in cultured hippocampal neurones. Surprisingly, the SUMO protease SENP- 1, which removes SUMO from <b>conjugated</b> <b>proteins,</b> was also increased by OGD, suggesting that the neuronal response to OGD involves a complex interplay between SUMOylation and deSUMOylation. Importantly, decreasing global SUMOylation in cultured hippocampal neurones by overexpression of the catalytic domain of SENP- 1 increased neuronal vulnerability to OGD-induced cell death. Taken together, these results suggest a neuroprotective role for neuronal SUMOylation after OGD...|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of novel therapies is arguably {{one of the}} most important roles of modern chemistry and biology. Here, we shed light on a particular class of human therapies in which synthetic chemical entities are attached to expressed biologicals (proteins) with the goal to enhance clinical activity. We focus our discussion on three key categories of these derivatized biologicals: <b>proteins</b> <b>conjugated</b> with biologically inert molecules, <b>proteins</b> <b>conjugated</b> with biologically active small molecules and peptides (e. g., antibody drug <b>conjugates</b> [ADCs]), and <b>proteins</b> <b>conjugated</b> with radio isotopes. Overall, it is apparent by the impact on clinical activity as well as the commercial success that chemical modification of recombinant proteins is becoming of increasing importance. Therefore, we argue that deeper understanding of the chemical reactions between large proteinaceous molecules and small molecule reagents will allow for more precise and elegant solutions to existing limitations in this field...|$|R
40|$|Methods {{that allow}} soft matter to be {{fabricated}} with controlled {{structure and function}} would be beneficial for applications ranging from flexible electronics to regenerative medicine. Here, the assembly of a multifunctional gelatin matrix is demonstrated by triggering its self-assembly and then enzymatically assembling biological functionality. Triggered self-assembly relies on electrodeposition of the pH-responsive hydrogelator, 9 -fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl-phenylalanine (Fmoc-Phe), in response to electrical inputs that generate a localized pH-gradient. Warm solutions of Fmoc-Phe and gelatin are co-deposited and, after cooling to room temperature, a physical gelatin network forms. Enzymatic assembly employs the cofactor-independent enzyme microbial transglutaminase (mTG) to perform two functions: crosslink the gelatin matrix to generate a thermally stable chemical gel and <b>conjugate</b> <b>proteins</b> to the matrix. To <b>conjugate</b> globular <b>proteins</b> to gelatin these proteins are engineered to have short lysine-rich or glutamine-rich fusion tags to provide accessible residues for mTG-catalysis. Viable bacteria can be co-deposited and entrapped within the crosslinked gelatin matrix and can proliferate upon subsequent incubation. These results demonstrate the potential for enlisting biological materials and mechanisms to biofabricate multifunctional soft matter...|$|R
