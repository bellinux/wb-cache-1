40|$|We {{introduce}} {{techniques to}} support efficient non-atomic execution of very long traces {{on a new}} binary translation based, x 86 - 64 compatible VLIW microprocessor. Incrementally <b>committed</b> long traces significantly reduce wasted computations on exception induced rollbacks by retaining the correctly <b>committed</b> parts of traces. We divide each scheduled trace into multiple <b>commit</b> groups; groups are <b>committed</b> to the architectural state after all instructions within and prior to each group complete without exceptions. Architectural state updates are only visible after future <b>commit</b> points are deferred using a simple hardware <b>commit</b> buffer. We employ a <b>commit</b> depth predictor to predict how many groups a trace will complete, thereby eliminating pipeline flushes on repeated rollbacks. Unlike atomic traces, we allow instructions to be freely scheduled across <b>commit</b> points throughout the trace to maximize ILP. <b>Commit</b> groups are formed after scheduling, allowing the <b>commit</b> points terminating each group to be inserted more optimally. <b>Commit</b> groups promote significantly faster convergence on optimized traces, since we salvage partially executed traces and splice the working parts together into new optimized traces. We use detailed models to demonstrate how <b>commit</b> groups substantially improve performance (on average, over 1. 5 × on SPEC 2000) relative to atomic traces...|$|R
