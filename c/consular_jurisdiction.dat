25|$|The initial {{inquiry and}} {{preliminary}} {{hearings on the}} 1886 Normanton Incident fell under the <b>consular</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> of the Kobe foreign settlement. On October 24, the cargo ship Normanton, belonging to a steamboat company at the Yokohama settlement, sank in the waters {{off the coast of}} Wakayama Prefecture. The boat's 25 Japanese passengers, who were riding along with the cargo, all died. Although 11 British crewmen boarded lifeboats and survived, not a single Japanese passenger made it out alive, and so suspicion emerged that the captain and crew had been negligent in saving the passengers. Under the <b>consular</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> guaranteed by the Ansei Treaties, the hearings for the case were heard over five days beginning on November 1 in the Kobe foreign settlement, but the British consul James Troup found the crew innocent. The governor of Hyōgo Prefecture, Utsumi Tadakatsu, was dissatisfied with the verdict and accused the captain of murder. On November 20, preliminary hearings were held on this charge in the foreign settlement, and on December 8 public hearings were held in Yokohama; both of these found the captain guilty. As the initial inquiry over the incident had found the crew blameless, doubts and criticism of the right to <b>consular</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> arose domestically in Japan, along with a wave of anti-British sentiment. This initial inquiry is a black spot in the otherwise positive history of foreign–Japanese relations in the Kobe foreign settlement.|$|E

5000|$|Some of the {{challenges}} on how the IME worked {{were based on the}} actual members and how they saw and understood IME. One of the issues is that [...] "in some <b>consular</b> <b>jurisdictions,</b> elections were controlled by local power groups that interfered in the election processes to prevent outsiders from being elected." [...] Then, it is not clear if the leading members have enough knowledge, control, and strategy to create a common agenda, and strengthen the relationship between the group in order for their ideas and contributions to actually be considered and flow adequately. Furthermore, it is not fully clear what the process is to elect new members for the council that are trustworthy and not corrupt. Lastly, it is the idea that there will be different perspectives between native born Mexicans, and Mexican-Americans in the council regarding some of the policies, and {{it is not clear what}} will be the process to negotiate such differences. This is due to the idea that there has to be loyalty and to some extent a form of equality for the migrants, and some issues might not be understood with those that are not actual migrants themselves.|$|R
25|$|In {{order to}} respect the foreigners' self-government, there were limits on the {{abilities}} of Japanese to enter the settlement and of Japan to exercise police power in the area. Due to the extraterritoriality enforced by unequal treaties, legal disputes involving Westerners were subject to judgment by their consulates. The right to self-government was tied {{to the land of}} the settlement, and thus did not apply outside its boundaries, but the right to <b>consular</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> was tied to the people it applied to, and thus extended even to disputes that occurred outside the settlement. In practice, foreigners claimed the same extraterritoriality outside the settlement that they did inside, which sometimes developed into trouble with the Japanese side.|$|E
25|$|On July 2, 1871, a Hyōgo prefectural {{police officer}} brought a woman {{suspected}} of prostitution {{in to the}} station from within the foreign settlement. Once the investigation determined {{that she was a}} servant of the Englishman Mr. Walters, who lived within the settlement, she was released. However, Walters was angry over the affair, and on the next day, July 3, he trapped two police officers he believed to have been involved in her arrest within his estate. The case fell under <b>consular</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> and was judged by the English consul Abel Gower, who judged that the Japanese officers were unable to exercise police power in the settlement—not even to patrol it, let alone arrest anyone. Thus, Walters was not found guilty of obstruction of justice against the officers, but only of false imprisonment. This judgment clarified that only the settlement police, under the authority of the executive committee, was allowed to undertake police action in the settlement. Hyōgo Prefecture remained unable to exercise these powers in the settlement until its return in 1899.|$|E
25|$|On July 29, 1858, the Tokugawa shogunate {{entered into}} the Treaty of Amity and Commerce with the United States. In Article 6 of that treaty, the shogunate {{acknowledged}} the <b>consular</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> of the U.S. in Japan. In Article 3 it opened Hyōgo port as a treaty port from January 1, 1863, agreeing to establish a fixed area (foreign settlement) to be loaned to foreigners to reside and conduct economic activity in. Before long, the shogunate signed similar treaties known as the Ansei Treaties with the Netherlands, Russia, the United Kingdom, and France. However, these treaties were unable to gain the approval of an imperial edict, and after negotiations with the foreign powers {{the opening of the}} port was delayed for five years, until January 1, 1868. The court expressed disapproval for the opening of a port so close to the imperial palace in Kyoto, and even after the Ansei Treaties were approved by imperial edict on December 22, 1865, approval for the port was still not granted. On June 26, 1867, when the treaty port's scheduled opening was six months away, an imperial edict finally acknowledged its establishment.|$|E
5000|$|In common usage from 1840 onward, [...] "Palestine" [...] {{was used}} either to {{describe}} the <b>consular</b> <b>jurisdictions</b> of the Western powers or for a region that extended in the north-south direction typically from Rafah (south-east of Gaza) to the Litani River (now in Lebanon). The western boundary was the sea, and the eastern boundary was the poorly defined place where the Syrian desert began. In various European sources, the eastern boundary was placed anywhere from the Jordan River to slightly east of Amman. The Negev Desert was not included. The Consuls were originally magistrates who tried cases involving their own citizens in foreign territories. While the jurisdictions in the secular states of Europe had become territorial, the Ottomans perpetuated the legal system they inherited from the Byzantine Empire. The law in many matters was personal, not territorial, and the individual citizen carried his nation's law with him wherever he went. Capitulatory law applied to foreigners in Palestine. Only Consular Courts of the State of the foreigners concerned were competent to try them. That was true, not only in cases involving personal status, but also in criminal and commercial matters. According to American Ambassador Morgenthau, Turkey had never been an independent sovereignty. The Western Powers had their own courts, marshals, colonies, schools, postal systems, religious institutions, and prisons. The Consuls also extended protections to large communities of Jewish protégés who had settled in Palestine.|$|R
50|$|After the Berlin Conference of 1884, Britain {{announced}} {{formation of}} the Oil Rivers Protectorate, which included the Niger Delta and extended eastward to Calabar, where the British consulate general was relocated from Fernando Po. The protectorate was organized to control and develop trade coming down the Niger. Vice consuls were assigned to ports that already had concluded treaties of cooperation with the Foreign Office. Local rulers continued to administer their territories, but <b>consular</b> authorities assumed <b>jurisdiction</b> for the equity courts established earlier by the foreign mercantile communities. A constabulary force was raised and used to pacify the coastal area.|$|R

2500|$|On August 7, 1868, the Meiji {{government}} {{concluded the}} , {{in which it}} acknowledged certain executive and financial rights of foreigners within the settlement. Specifically, the [...] was created as the highest legislative organ {{in charge of the}} improvement of infrastructure and public order within the settlement. The Municipal Council was funded in part by a portion of the profits from the auctions of the perpetual leases, and was also allowed to collect land and police taxes. This self-government by the residents of the settlement continued until the abolishment of the settlement—unlike that in Nagasaki and Yokohama, which began with rights to self-government but lost them after a time. Meanwhile, the various foreign powers placed consulates around the settlement in order to safeguard their financial interests and citizens and exercise their <b>consular</b> <b>jurisdiction.</b>|$|E
2500|$|However, Townsend Harris' {{terms were}} much more {{demanding}} than Perry's. Harris claimed that the laws of Japan were [...] "very peculiar" [...] {{and it would be}} unfair for foreigners to live under such rule. Article III of the treaty gave Americans the right to trade and reside in Yedo (Tokyo) and Osaka without influence from the Japanese government; the treaty also allowed for <b>consular</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> in those cities opened to American trade, the free export of Japanese gold and silver, and a conventional tariff. The entrance of foreigners to the port of Edo, the shogunal capital, and the placement of an official from a foreign government in proximity to the Emperor was threatening, even to those who supported opening to the West publicly. These demands in particular demonstrated the United States' planned role for Japan; there was to be freedom of trade, allowance for an influx of Americans, (but no expectations of Japanese coming to the United States), no interest in military concerns, and religious toleration of Japanese tradition. It was merely a link in a chain of commerce that would connect North America to China.|$|E
2500|$|In 1894, the Meiji {{government}} {{concluded the}} Anglo-Japanese Treaty of Commerce and Navigation with the United Kingdom, realizing {{its goal of}} repealing <b>consular</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> and reclaiming the foreign settlements. The government proceeded to conclude treaties to the same effect with 14 more countries, including the U.S. and France. These treaties took effect on July 17, 1899, and on this date the Kobe foreign settlement was returned to Japanese hands. The settlement was incorporated into Kobe City, and its administrative and financial autonomy was canceled. Japanese were allowed to enter freely and to reside within the area. The settlement's internal police force, which had been organized by the Municipal Council, was abolished, and its fire brigade, which had been organized directly be residents, {{was transferred to the}} control of the city as a regular fire brigade. The government of the settlement was transferred from the highest office within the Municipal Council, the head of the [...] (see below), to commissioned members of the prefectural and city governments. On the old site of the office, a local police station was built, and a committee called the [...] (later the [...] ) was allowed to be established by the foreigners to help prevent disputes arising from the loss of extraterritoriality. In these ways, the government showed some consideration for the foreigners as well.|$|E
2500|$|Initially, {{the judges}} {{who had served}} the Zhangs were retained, but in 1934, the Judicial Law College headed by the Japanese judge Furuta Masatake was opened in Changchun, to be {{replaced}} by a larger Law University in 1937. Right from the start, the new applicants vastly exceeded the number of openings as the first class of the Law College numbered only 100, but 1, 210 students had applied. The legal system that the students were trained was closely modeled after the Japanese legal system, which in its turn was modeled after the French legal system, but there were a number of particularities unique to Manchukuo. Law students were trained to write essays on such topics as the [...] "theory of the harmony of the five races [...] ", the [...] "political theory of the Kingly Way", [...] "practical differences between <b>consular</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> and extraterritoriality", and how best to [...] "realize the governance of the Kingly Way". The Japanese professors were [...] "astonished" [...] by the [...] "enthusiasm" [...] which the students wrote their essays on these subjects as the students expressed the hope that the wangdao was an uniquely Asian solution to the problems of the modern world, and that Manchukuo represented nothing less than the beginning of a new civilization that would led to an utopian society in the near-future. The Japanese professors were greatly impressed with the Confucian idealism of their students, but noted that their students all used stock phrases to the extent it was hard to tell their essays apart, cited examples of wise judges from ancient China while ignoring more recent legal developments, and were long on expressing idealistic statements about how the wangdao would led to a perfect society, but were short on how explaining just how this was to be done in practice.|$|E

50|$|It {{served as}} the {{consulate}} during construction of a Western-style building within the official Settlement boundaries just {{to the south of}} Suzhou Creek.

50|$|By 1839, Hope was {{becoming}} involved in parliamentary work.

His brother's appointment as Under Secretary of State for the Colonies in Sir Robert Peel's administration may have opened some doors.

50|$|In 19251926, the {{treaties}} were revised {{to provide for}} <b>consular</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> to be terminated, and nationals of {{the parties to the}} treaty were to come under the jurisdiction of Thai courts after the introduction of all Thai legal codes and a period of 5 years thereafter. By 1930, extraterritoriality was in effect no longer in force. After absolute monarchy was replaced by constitutional monarchy in the bloodless Siamese revolution of 1932, the constitutional government promulgated a set of legal codes, setting the stage for new treaties signed in 19371938 which canceled extraterritorial rights completely.|$|E
50|$|On 29 November of {{the same}} year, the Consulate was {{promoted}} {{to the status of}} Consulate General, with Lee Jung-bang, councillor of the Korean Embassy to the Republic of China (ROC) became the first Consul General under appointment of the Korean MOFA.

50|$|In essence, {{this was}} true {{culmination}} of the 1875 reforms. From {{the beginnings of the}} Mixed Courts in 1875, to the Native Courts in 1883, and the Montreux Convention reforms in 1937, the various jurisdictions of the Egyptian legal system drew closer together, {{while at the same time}} foreign <b>consular</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> lessened. Finally, the whole of Egypt’s legal system became unified in 1956. The Mixed Courts paved the way for this to happen by the gradual cycle of reform, development and reform. The fusion of the Mixed and Native Courts provided an up-to-date and solid system.|$|E
5000|$|As {{a treaty}} power {{which had been}} granted {{extraterritorial}} jurisdiction, France exercised <b>consular</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> in the French Concession. Cases involving French nationals were heard by the French consular court. Matters involving Chinese nationals, or nationals or non-treaty powers, were heard in the International Mixed Court for the French Concession, a court nominally headed by a Chinese official but [...] "assisted" [...] by French consular officials, and using an adapted version of Chinese procedural rules. The International Mixed Court was abolished in 1930 and replaced by Chinese courts under the judicial system of the Republic of China.|$|E
50|$|The capitulations {{system was}} {{introduced}} into Egypt during the 19th {{century as a}} result of pressure on the foreign powers by the people. Following the First World War, a wave of nationalism was on the rise in Egypt, and the government, backed by the newly established Wafd Party, put growing demands before the British government - then in control of Egypt - to abolish the capitulations system while placing foreigners under the local Egyptian legal system. As a result, several of the foreign consular courts were abolished in 1920-1921, while their nationals were placed under British <b>consular</b> <b>jurisdiction.</b> This did not satisfy the demands of the Egyptian government regarding the total abolition of capitulations.|$|E

50|$|These crises induced the British {{government}} to inquire more carefully into the financial {{condition of the}} country, where Europeans had invested much capital. In December 1875, Stephen Cave, MP, and Colonel (later Sir) John Stokes, RE, were sent to Egypt to inquire into Egypt's financial situation. Mr Cave's report, made public only in April 1876, showed that under the existing administration national bankruptcy was inevitable. With no alternatives, European powers used Egypt's indebtedness to extract concessions regarding how the debts would be repaid. Other commissions of inquiry followed, and each one brought Ismail increasingly under European control. The establishment of the Mixed Tribunals in 1876, {{in place of the}} system of <b>consular</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> in civil actions, made some of the courts of justice international.|$|E
50|$|South Korea {{maintains}} 9 Consulate Generals, 1 Consulate Agency, and 2 Consular Offices {{in addition}} to its main embassy in Washington D.C. to better offer diplomatic services to Korean and foreign nationals from every corner of the United States.

On the other hand, the 2 Consular Offices located in Anchorage and Dallas do not control over an exclusive <b>consular</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> and instead offer consular services to those from Alaska and Dallas-Fort Worth metro area respectively, who otherwise would have to travel to the Consulate Generals in Seattle and Houston, respectively.|$|E

50|$|It {{was only}} in 1845 that Britain {{followed}} in America's footsteps and signed a land-deal to allow Britons to rent land in Shanghai in perpetuity. The American consular presence did not create {{a problem for the}} British because it was never intended to have a post in person. Since American traders in China were prohibited from engaging in the opium trade (though almost all were active in this trade), their business transactions were conducted under the auspices of British firms. The only serious incident of political complaint against the Americans was in 1845, when the Stars and Stripes was raised by the acting US Consul, Henry G. Wolcott, who had just arrived in the city. Neither the British nor the Chinese governor approved of the display. In 1848, France established its own French concession under French <b>consular</b> <b>jurisdiction,</b> squeezed between the British settlement to the north and the Chinese walled city to the south.|$|E
