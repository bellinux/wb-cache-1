In the present study, we intended to gain further insights into the evolution of <b>COG</b> subunits in vertebrates, using comparative analyses of all eight <b>COG</b> proteins. Results: We used protein distances and dN/dS ratios as a measure of the rate of proteins evolution. The results showed that all <b>COG</b> subunits are evolving under strong purifying selection, although <b>COG</b> 1 seems to evolve faster than the remaining proteins. In addition, we also tested the expression of <b>COG</b> genes in 20 human tissues, and demonstrate their ubiquitous nature. Conclusions: <b>COG</b> complex has a critical role in Golgi structure and function, which, in turn, is involved in protein sorting and glycosylation.

40|$|International audienceThe conserved {{oligomeric}} Golgi (<b>COG)</b> {{complex is}} a tethering factor composed of eight subunits that {{is involved in}} the retrograde transport of intra-Golgi components. Deficient biosynthesis of <b>COG</b> subunits leads to alterations of protein trafficking along the secretory pathway and thereby to severe diseases in humans. Since the <b>COG</b> complex affects the localization of several Golgi glycosyltransferase enzymes, <b>COG</b> deficiency also leads to defective protein glycosylation, thereby explaining the classification of <b>COG</b> deficiencies as forms of congenital disorder of glycosylation (CDG). To date, mutations in <b>COG</b> 1, <b>COG</b> 4, <b>COG</b> 7 and <b>COG</b> 8 genes have been associated with diseases, which range from severe multi-organ disorders to moderate forms of neurological impairment. In the present study, we describe a new type of <b>COG</b> deficiency related to a splicing mutation in the <b>COG</b> 5 gene. Sequence analysis in the patient identified a homozygous intronic substitution (c. 1669 - 15 T>C) leading to exon skipping and severely reduced expression of the <b>COG</b> 5 protein. This defect was associated with a mild psychomotor retardation with delayed motor and language development. Analysis of different serum glycoproteins revealed a CDG phenotype with typical undersialylation of N- and O-glycans. Retrograde Golgi-to-endoplasmic reticulum trafficking was markedly delayed in the patient's fibroblast upon brefeldin-A treatment, which is a hallmark of <b>COG</b> deficiency. This trafficking delay could be restored to normal values by expressing a wildtype <b>COG</b> 5 cDNA in the patient cells. This case demonstrates that <b>COG</b> deficiency and thereby CDG must be taken into consideration even in children presenting mild neurological impairments...|$|R

The <b>cogging</b> torque is measured with a torque transducer connected between the test object and the load machine. The <b>cogging</b> torque can be determined in two different ways: Measurement of the <b>cogging</b> torque at slow speed or measurement of the <b>cogging</b> torque with closed-loop position control.

The conserved oligomeric Golgi (<b>COG)</b> complex has been implicated in tethering of retrograde intra-Golgi vesicles in yeast and mammalian cells. Using genetic and cytologic approaches, we demonstrate that T-DNA insertions in Arabidopsis <b>COG</b> complex subunits, <b>COG</b> 3 and <b>COG</b> 8, cause an absolute, male-specific transmission defect that can be complemented by expression of <b>COG</b> 3 and <b>COG</b> 8 from the LAT 52 pollen promoter, respectively.
