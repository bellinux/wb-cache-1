5000|$|A WIC is {{inserted}} into a WIC (or HWIC, or EHWIC) expansion slot in a Cisco device. According to Cisco, [...] "Cisco <b>interface</b> <b>cards</b> are classified {{according to the}} technologies they support. For example, WAN <b>interface</b> <b>cards</b> (WICs) support WAN technologies, such as Gigabit Ethernet; and voice <b>interface</b> <b>cards</b> (VICs) support voice technologies. Voice/WAN <b>interface</b> <b>cards</b> (VWICs) can support voice, data, and voice and data applications, depending on {{the capabilities of the}} router in which the VWIC is installed." [...] The WIC is supported by many Cisco devices, particularly their branch routers including the 2500 series routers and its successors.|$|R

50|$|The ProFile was {{the first}} hard disk drive {{produced}} by Apple Computer, initially for use with the Apple III personal computer. The original model had a formatted capacity of 5 MB and connected to a special <b>interface</b> <b>card</b> that plugged into an Apple III slot.

50|$|SFP sockets {{are found}} in Ethernet switches, routers, {{firewalls}} and network <b>interface</b> <b>cards.</b> Storage <b>interface</b> <b>cards,</b> also called HBAs or Fibre Channel storage switches, also make use of these modules, supporting different speeds such as 2Gb, 4Gb, and 8Gb. Because of their low cost, low profile, and ability to provide a connection to different types of optical fiber, SFP provides such equipment with enhanced flexibility.|$|R
50|$|Telephony <b>Interface</b> <b>Cards</b> - Digium {{produces}} <b>interface</b> <b>cards</b> {{to connect}} IP PBX, IVR, VoIP Gateway or custom telephony {{solutions to the}} public telephone network. Digital, Analog and Hybrid cards enable connections between Asterisk and analog equipment (faxes, phones, lines); T1, E1, J1 and ISDN-BRI interfaces; and mixed mode environments.

That is, the communication module is involved in the authentication protocol implementation.|$|R
50|$|The {{expansion}} box allowed up to 4 <b>interface</b> <b>cards</b> to {{be connected}} to the COMX 35. The expansion box also included a firmware ROM connected to memory location @E000-@EFFF which extended basic with commands and logic to switch between different <b>interface</b> <b>cards.</b> Next to the standard firmware ROM there was an adaptation made by F&M (Frank and Marcel van Tongeren) this ROM added a screen editor feature to COMX basic.|$|R
5000|$|Token Ring network <b>interface</b> <b>cards</b> contain {{all of the}} {{intelligence}} required for speed autodetection, routing and can drive themselves on many Multistation Access Units (MAUs) that operate without power (most MAUs operate in this fashion, only requiring a power supply for LEDs).

Computer interface and control applications are common practice not exceptions in the workplace. The {{knowledge of how to}} manage processes with computer control can be developed by working with basic tools of microprocessor <b>interfacing.</b> An <b>interface</b> <b>card</b> placed in a microcomputer can provide practitioners with the skills they need to be competitive. The Intel 82 C 55 A programmable peripheral interface IC can be used to interface external hardware with a microcomputer. The <b>interface</b> <b>card</b> being built and used at Morehead State University is based on the Intel 82 C 55 A programmable peripheral I/O device. With minimal support circuitry the 82 C 55 A can be interfaced with a microcomputer. The 82 C 55 A contains three 8 -bit ports providing 24 lines of digital I/O. Several circuits can be connected to the 82 C 55 A making it more versatile. Counter/timers, analog to digital converters, digital to analog converters, sensors, and several other circuits can be connected to the <b>interface</b> <b>card.</b> The card is used to control and monitor different processes through hardware and software interfaces. Software used to program the <b>interface</b> <b>card</b> includes BASIC, Visual Basic, Visual C++, and Labview.
