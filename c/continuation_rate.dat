40|$|Objectives: To {{assess the}} 1 -year <b>continuation</b> <b>rate</b> of HRT {{prescribed}} in Hong Kong public health sector {{and to identify}} factors affecting this <b>continuation</b> <b>rate.</b> Methods: All women who received at least one dispensed prescription of estrogens between January 1998 and December 2000 from 36 specialist outpatient clinics of the Hospital Authority were selected, and observed for at least 2 years and at most 3 years. The duration of use and variables including age, types of hormones, routes of delivery, dose of estrogen, and prescribing specialty were retrieved from the central prescription database of the Hospital Authority. Results: Of 12, 711 incident users of HRT, more than half were aged 50 - 59. Most (78. 5 %) of the users took conjugated equine estrogens (CEE) 0. 625 mg or related products. Only a small proportion (3. 0 %) of women used CEE 0. 3 mg. Initial estrogen prescriptions were written by gynaecologists in 86. 7 %. The overall 1 -year <b>continuation</b> <b>rate</b> was 68. 3 %. The highest and lowest continuation rates were observed in women aged 40 - 49 and the two extreme age groups (35 - 39 and 70 - 79), respectively. Better <b>continuation</b> <b>rate</b> was observed in women taking estrogen-only therapy such as CEE or estradiol (overall 76. 3 %) than in women using continuous combined therapy (58. 6 %), sequential combined therapy (64. 8 %), or transdermal estrogen (60. 6 %). In the age group 60 - 69, the use of CEE 0. 3 mg was associated with better <b>continuation</b> <b>rate</b> than CEE 0. 625 mg. Conclusions: Better <b>continuation</b> <b>rate</b> at 1 year was associated with age younger than 60, oral route of HRT and hysterectomy. © 2004 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis is to design and construct a unique analytical data base {{to be used to}} examine the effects of the military drawdown on the retention of Naval aviators. Past analyses of retention have focused primarily on the individual retention decision. This thesis uses grouped data defined by year of commission, fiscal year, and aviator type. The analysis quantifies the relationship between various downsizing policies and cohort continuation rates while controlling for the effects of time-since-MSR (minimum service requirement) and civilian unemployment. Separate regression models are specified for the jet, prop, and helo pilot communities, and for the jet and prop NFO communities, with the <b>continuation</b> <b>rate</b> as the dependent variable. The models are estimated using weighted OLS. The samples contained observations on a total of 1, 907 cohort continuation rates for each fiscal year between 1977 and 1993. The study found that the percentage of Aviation Continuation Pay bonuses available in a given year is directly related to the grouped <b>continuation</b> <b>rate.</b> The effect of the VSI/SSB and IRAD progrnas was found to be statistically insignificant. Thus, it was concluded that the downsizing policies have had only a minor effect on the underlying, baseline <b>continuation</b> <b>rate.</b> NANAU. S. Navy (U. S. N.) author...|$|E
40|$|Background: Copper intrauterine device (Cu-IUD) use in Australia is low {{despite being}} a highly {{effective}}, cost effective non-hormonal contraceptive with reported 12 -month <b>continuation</b> <b>rates</b> of 85 % compared to 59 % for oral contraception. Aims: To describe {{the characteristics of}} Cu-IUD users in the Australian context, their experiences of side effects, <b>continuation</b> <b>rates</b> and reasons for discontinuation. Methods: Between August 2009 and January 2012 we undertook a prospective cohort study of consecutive women presenting for Cu-IUD insertion to three family planning clinics in Queensland and New South Wales. We used survival analysis for <b>continuation</b> <b>rates</b> and univariate and multivariable analyses to characterise users, their experiences {{up to three years}} and reasons for discontinuation. Results: Of the 211 enrolled women, a third (36. 0 %) were aged under 30 and a third were nulliparous (36. 5 %). Efficacy and lack of hormones were the most frequently cited reasons to choose the method. Four women were lost to follow-up. Overall <b>continuation</b> <b>rates</b> were 79. 1 % at one year and 61. 3 % at three years. Early discontinuation was reduced in those with two or more children (adjusted hazards ratio 0. 22, 95 % CI 0. 09 – 0. 50). Heavy menstrual bleeding was the commonest reason for removal in 28 of 59 (47. 5 %) discontinuations due to complications or side effects. One uterine perforation and one method failure resulting in an ectopic pregnancy occurred.

40|$|Objective: In {{this study}} <b>continuation</b> <b>rate</b> and reasons for {{discontinuation}} of Depot-medroxyprogestrone acetate (DMPA) and Cyclofem have been compared. Materials and methods: A retrospective cohort {{study was conducted}} with 422 women (202 Cyclofemand 220 DMPA users) who had started using the methods 12 - 24 months before the study in East Azerbaijan health houses. Data were collected by reviewing the records and interview with the clients and analysed using Kaplan-Meier and Cox Regression. Results: The 3, 6, 9, 12 months <b>continuation</b> <b>rate</b> were 56 %, 37 %, 30 %, 27 % respectively for Cyclofem versus 75 %, 59. 5 %, 48 %, 42. 5 % for DMPA. Menstrual changes were reported significantly more by the DMPA users than the Cyclofem users (85 % vs. 73 %, P= 0. 008) as the main reason for the discontinuation, the difference mainly reflected of amenorrhea (50 % vs. 23 %, P= 0. 003). None of DMPA users and 11 % of Cyclofem users claimed frequency of visits and lack of method supplies as their main discontinuation reason. Conclusion: Discontinuation rate was high for the both methods but it was higher for Cyclofem. The common side effects mentioned as the main reasons for discontinuation of the both methods are not health threatening.

30|$|Regarding {{the effects}} of {{interventions}} with exergaming, although short-term (6 – 12  weeks) interventions have been reported (Taylor et al. 2011; Bailey and McInnis 2011; Sell et al. 2008; Maloney et al. 2008; Anderson-Hanley et al. 2011; Lamoth et al. 2011; Natbony et al. 2013; Skjæret et al. 2015 a, b), no study has conducted an intervention that lasted for several years. Annesi previously reported the dropout rate of a new exercise program started in a public exercise facility (Annesi 2007). The exercise <b>continuation</b> <b>rate</b> {{a few months after}} starting the exercise was relatively low (Annesi 2007). We performed an intervention with exergaming for 3  years, and exercise was continued by 16 out of the 20 subjects, showing a high <b>continuation</b> <b>rate.</b> The attendance rate (%) was high (79  % in the 1 -year group, 82.6  % in the 2 -year group, 82.4  % in the 3 -year group). These changes were not significant. A possible reason for the high attendance rate is a report that exergaming increases exercise compliance (Warburton et al. 2007; Tamura et al. 2007; Baranowski et al. 2008). In addition, Motor functions also significantly improved. This may have been related to adequate exercise loading and enjoyable game features. This is the first study on the exergaming <b>continuation</b> <b>rate</b> and its influence on motor functions during a long-term intervention for the elderly.

40|$|Programs and {{contraceptive}} use <b>continuation</b> <b>rates</b> {{were obtained}} for a rural Georgia family planning clinic. Program continuation is a measurement of maintenance of clinic attendance, while use continuation is related to actual use of effective contraceptives regardless of clinic activity status. Program <b>continuation</b> <b>rates</b> ranged from 0. 77 at 12 months to 0. 48 at 36 months. Contraceptive use <b>continuation</b> <b>rates</b> were 0. 78 at 12 months and 0. 58 at 36 months. Women who moved or were otherwise lost to follow-up formed the largest category of discontinuation. The highest rate of discontinuation from clinic attendance occurred after the first visit with secondary peaks {{around the time of}} scheduled annual checkups. Women who were younger and had fewer living children had a greater likelihood of discontinuing clinic attendance and contraceptive use. The reasons for and timing of discontinuation from clinic attendance suggest that clinic personnel should place special emphasis on the first visits, arrange referral for women who might have plans to leave the service area before the scheduled return visit, send reminders before first revisits, and follow up patients soon after missed visits. Priority might be assigned to the younger women of low parity who {{have been shown to be}} at higher risk of discontinuation. Other factors which might influence continuation include method of contraception, marital status, and race. Program continuation can be determined by analysis of clinic records alone while contraceptive use continuation often requires follow-up of patients. Although the two <b>continuation</b> <b>rates</b> were not equivalent, program and use continuation were roughly parallel through much of the study period.

40|$|Abstract Background Breastfeeding is a {{cost-effective}} public health intervention that reduces infant {{morbidity and mortality}} in developing countries. In Lebanon, breastfeeding exclusivity and <b>continuation</b> <b>rates</b> are disappointingly low. This qualitative study aims at identifying barriers and promoters of breastfeeding in the Lebanese context by exploring mothers' perceptions and experiences in breastfeeding over a one year period. Methods We conducted focus group discussions in three hospitals in Beirut, Lebanon, and followed up 36 breastfeeding mothers with serial in-depth interviews for one year post-partum or until breastfeeding discontinuation. Results Themes generated from baseline interviews revealed several positive and negative perceptions of breastfeeding. Longitudinal follow up identified insufficient milk, fear of weight gain or breast sagging, pain, sleep deprivation, exhaustion, or maternal employment, as reasons for early breastfeeding discontinuation. Women who continued breastfeeding for one year were more determined to succeed and overcome any barrier, relying mostly on family support and proper time management. Conclusions Increasing awareness of future mothers about breast feeding difficulties, its benefits to children, mothers, and society at large may further promote breastfeeding, and improve exclusivity and <b>continuation</b> <b>rates</b> in Lebanon. A national strategy for early intervention during school years to increase young women's awareness may improve their self-confidence and determination to succeed in breastfeeding later. Moreover, prolonging maternity leave, having day-care facilities at work, creation of lactation peer support groups and hotlines, and training of doctors and nurses in proper lactation support may positively impact breastfeeding exclusivity and <b>continuation</b> <b>rates.</b> Further {{research is needed to}} assess the effectiveness of proposed interventions in the Lebanese context. </p...|$|R
40|$|Background The optimal timing to {{initiate}} bevacizumab (BV) therapy for recurrent glioblastoma (GBM) is currently unclear. To address this issue, we examined progression-free survival (PFS) and survival time (ST) {{in a large}} retrospective cohort of GBM patients treated with BV at different recurrences. Methods We identified 468 primary GBM patients who underwent biopsy or surgery followed by radiation therapy and temozolomide (RT/TMZ), and then received BV. PFS and ST were compared between patients stratified by the recurrence that BV was initiated (upfront, first recurrence, second recurrence, or 3 + recurrences). We also examined the effect on PFS and ST of the addition of chemotherapy to BV. In a larger cohort of GBM patients, we determined overall treatment <b>continuation</b> <b>rates</b> at each recurrence and identified variables predictive of inability to continue treatment. Results BV PFS was similar for all 3 recurrence groups (median, 4. 1 months). There were no differences in BV ST (median, 9. 8 months). The addition of chemotherapy to BV improved PFS but not ST. Analysis of treatment <b>continuation</b> <b>rates</b> indicated {{that the number of}} patients unable to undergo further treatments is modest, and that patients unable to tolerate BV delay can be identified by age ≥ 60 years and low extent of resection.
