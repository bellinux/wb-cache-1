5|$|The partly ionic {{structure}} of BN layers in h-BN reduces <b>covalency</b> and electrical conductivity, whereas the interlayer interaction increases resulting in higher hardness of h-BN relative to graphite. The reduced electron-delocalization in hexagonal-BN is also indicated by its absence {{of color and}} a large band gap. Very different bonding – strong covalent within the basal planes (planes where boron and nitrogen atoms are covalently bonded) and weak between them – causes high anisotropy of most properties of h-BN.|$|E
5|$|Zinc {{chemistry}} {{is similar to}} the chemistry of the late first-row transition metals, nickel and copper, though it has a filled d-shell and compounds are diamagnetic and mostly colorless. The ionic radii of zinc and magnesium happen to be nearly identical. Because of this some of the equivalent salts have the same crystal structure, and in other circumstances where ionic radius is a determining factor, the chemistry of zinc has much in common with that of magnesium. In other respects, there is little similarity with the late first-row transition metals. Zinc tends to form bonds with a greater degree of <b>covalency</b> and much more stable complexes with N- and S- donors. Complexes of zinc are mostly 4- or 6- coordinate although 5-coordinate complexes are known.|$|E
5|$|If the {{electronic}} {{structure of the}} two interacting bodies {{is affected by the}} presence of one another, covalent interactions (non-ionic) also contribute to the overall energy of the compound formed. Ionic compounds are rarely purely ionic, i.e. held together only by electrostatic forces. The bonds between even the most electronegative/electropositive pairs such as those in caesium fluoride exhibit a small degree of <b>covalency.</b> Conversely, covalent bonds between unlike atoms often exhibit some charge separation and can be considered to have a partial ionic character. The circumstances under which a compound will have ionic or covalent character can typically be understood using Fajans' rules, which use only charges and the sizes of each ion. According to these rules, compounds with the most ionic character will have large positive ions with a low charge, bonded to a small negative ion with a high charge. More generally HSAB theory can be applied, whereby the compounds with the most ionic character are those consisting of hard acids and hard bases: small, highly charged ions with a high difference in electronegativities between the anion and cation. This difference in electronegativities means that the charge separation, and resulting dipole moment, is maintained even when the ions are in contact (the excess electrons on the anions are not transferred or polarized to neutralize the cations).|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{calibration}} of two popular density functionals (B 3 LYP and BP 86) for {{the prediction}} of isomer shifts (IS) in 57 Fe Mössbauer (MB) spectra is reported. A linear correlation between non-relativistically calculated theoretical electron densities and experimentally measured ISs is established. Both functionals lead to accurate predictions of MB ISs with standard deviations {{on the order of}} approximately 0. 1 mm s− 1 over a range of approximately 2 mm s− 1. The correlation holds for complexes of different total charge, total spin, valence state at the iron, coordination number and coordination geometry. A detailed analysis of the contributions to the IS is presented. It is shown that the important contributions are: (a) the variation of the 3 s-contribution which is mainly caused by differing shielding according to the d-population of the metal; and (b) variations in the valence shell contribution. The latter contribution accounts for approximately 70 % of the totally observed variation. The interpretation of the valence contribution is complex and involves contributions from changes in <b>covalencies,</b> orbital distortions due to bonding and shielding effects. The changes in metalligand distances are also an important factor, which influences the shape of the 4 s-orbital and therefore modulates ISs...|$|R

40|$|The intensities and {{relative}} energies of metal K pre-edge features {{are sensitive to}} both geometric and electronic structures. With the possibility to collect high-resolution spectral data {{it is important to}} find theoretical methods that include all important spectral effects: ligand-field splitting, multiplet structures, 3 d- 4 p orbital hybridization, and charge-transfer excitations. Here the restricted active space (RAS) method is used {{for the first time to}} calculate metal K pre-edge spectra of open-shell systems, and its performance is tested against on six iron complexes: [FeCl 6](n-), [FeCl 4](n-), and [Fe(CN) (6) ](n-) in ferrous and ferric oxidation states. The method gives good descriptions of the spectral shapes for all six systems. The mean absolute deviation for the relative energies of different peaks is only 0. 1 eV. For the two systems that lack centrosymmetry [FeCl 4](2 -/ 1 -), the ratios between dipole and quadrupole intensity contributions are reproduced with an error of 10 %, which leads to good descriptions of the integrated pre-edge intensities. To gain further chemical insight, the origins of the pre-edge features have been analyzed with a chemically intuitive molecular orbital picture that serves as a bridge between the spectra and the electronic structures. The pre-edges contain information about both ligand-field strengths and orbital <b>covalencies,</b> which can be understood by analyzing the RAS wavefunction. The RAS method can thus be used to predict and rationalize the effects of changes in both the oxidation state and ligand environment in a number of hard X-ray studies of small and medium-sized molecular systems...|$|R
