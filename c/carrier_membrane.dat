In this work, we discuss recent progress achieved in this field, focusing on gas and liquid separation using facilitated transport membranes.

40|$|The {{separation}} of ethylene from gas mixtures by <b>carrier</b> <b>membranes</b> has been investigated. Novel amorphous polyurethanes containing heteroaromatic building units and their polymer/Cu(I) ion complexes have been synthesized and characterized. These polymer ion complex networks were employed as materials for <b>carrier</b> <b>membranes.</b> The {{principle of the}} separation {{is based on the}} reversible and selective complexation of ethylene to the Cu(I) -complexes of the heteroaromatic bipyridine, phenanthroline or biquinoline units which are built into the polymer chain; the heteroaromatic complexation prevents the Cu(I) ion from oxydation. It was demonstrated that the complexation of ethylene by Cu(I) not only depends on the structure of the Cu(I) -complex itself but also on the constitution of the polyurethane which controls the morphology, the chain mobility and the local free volume around the Cu(I) complex.

Zur Abtrennung von Ethylen aus Gasgemischen wurden amorphe Polymere auf Polyurethanbasis mit heteroaromatischen Strukturelementen und komplexierten Cu(I) -Ionen als Materialien fuer Carrier-Membranen synthetisiert. Das Trennprinzip dieser Membrane basiert auf der reversiblen und selektiven Komplexierung des Ethylens an den im Polymer eingebauten Cu(I) -Komplexen mit Bipyridin-, Phenanthrolin- und Bichinolinstrukturen, welche die oxidative und photolytisch induzierte Zersetzung des Cu(I) inhibieren. Es konnte gezeigt werden, dass der strukturelle Aufbau der als Carrier fungierenden Cu(I) -Komplexe einer wesentlichen Einfluss auf die Anbindung des Ethylens an den Carrierbaustein hat.

Defect regions of about 10 µm width are inscribed by multiple scans of the laser along the intended dicing lanes, where the beam is focused at different depths of the wafer. The figure displays an optical micrograph of a cleavage plane of a separated chip of 150 µm thickness that was subjected to four laser scans, compare. The topmost defects are the best resolved and it is realized that a single laser pulse causes a defected crystal region that resembles {{to the shape of}} candle flame. This shape is caused by the rapid melting and solidification of the irradiated region in the laser beam focus, where the temperature of only some µm3 small volumes suddenly rises to some 1000 K within nanoseconds and falls to ambient temperature again. The laser is typically pulsed by a frequency of about 100 kHz, while the wafer is moved with a velocity of about 1 m/s. A defected region of about 10 µm width is finally inscribed in the wafer, along which preferential fracture occurs under mechanical loading. The fracture is performed in the second step and operates by radially expanding the <b>carrier</b> <b>membrane</b> to which the wafer is attached. The cleavage initiates at the bottom and advances to the surface, from which it is understood that a high distortion density must be introduced at the bottom.|$|E

40|$|Novel {{pressure}} sensors {{characterized by a}} hybrid setup of both plastic and glass have been presented. Concepts {{have been developed for}} the fabrication of {{pressure sensors}} using the low-cost AMANDA process. These concepts have then been evaluated on the basis of specifications made by industry. This has resulted in a new product concept with the pressure sensor mainly consisting of two molded housing parts, a <b>carrier</b> <b>membrane,</b> and a circular measurement plate made of glass. Mechanical stresses or strains occurring in the housing are not transferred to the sensitive part of the measurement plate, as the latter is connected to the housing via a thin, slack <b>carrier</b> <b>membrane.</b> In case of a pressure gradient prevailing in the housing, the measurement plate rests against the one or the other side, while its bearing at the edge remains the same. One housing shell is designed as a hollow sphere. Here, a circular plate always contacts along its edges irrespective of positional deviations. On the other side, the measurement plate is always borne by a polyimide ring fixed {{to the bottom of the}} housing. This even holds in case of positional deviations. On its surface, the measurement plate is equipped with strain gauges that measure the strain of the measurement plate under a pressure load. To specify the layout of the strain gauges, the stress and strain behavior on the calculated free measurement plate was described by mathematical equations. Furthermore, equations were derived for the variation of strain gauge resistance on the plate. These equations were entered into a computer program, by means of which the characteristics could be simulated as a function of strain gauge layout. 12 pressure sensors were manufactured in parallel with each pressure sensor containing a measurement plate of 2084 #mu#m in diameter, which was etched from 50 #mu#m thick glass substrates. This diameter ensures a linear relationship between central deflection and pressure difference in case of the measurement plate being subjected to pressure differences of #+-# 1000 hPa. (orig.)

Immunohistochemistry revealed that SCAMP 1 protein is also expressed in these two brain regions, and qualitatively appears greater in males.

HYSYS simulation was conducted on a scenario of CO 2 capture from a gross output 819 MWe power plant with novel fixed-site- <b>carrier</b> <b>membranes.</b> A relatively low efficiency penalty of 10 % and a competitive CO 2 capture cost of 47. 3 $/tonne CO 2 captured were found to be competitive to conventional amine absorption. Membrane systems have potentials for CO 2 capture if such performance can be achieved on pilot scale demonstration...|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} how high-pressure freezing of infectious biological material can safely be accomplished {{with the help}} of <b>membrane</b> <b>carriers.</b> The method described is easy to perform; however, careful manipulations are required. Existing safety regulations must still be followed. However, the procedure reduces the risk of dissemination of infectious material...|$|R
