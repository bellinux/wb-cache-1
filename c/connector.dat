5|$|Neither USB 1.0 nor 1.1 {{specified}} {{a design}} for any <b>connector</b> {{smaller than the}} standard type A or type B. Though many designs for a miniaturised type B <b>connector</b> appeared on many peripheral devices, conformance to the USB 1.x standard was fudged by treating peripherals that had miniature connectors {{as though they had}} a tethered connection (that is: no plug or socket at the peripheral end). There was no known miniature type A <b>connector</b> until USB 2.0 (rev 1.01) introduced one.|$|E
5|$|Route 87 {{begins at}} an {{intersection}} with U.S. Route 30 in Atlantic City, {{heading to the}} northeast on Huron Avenue, an undivided road with two northbound lanes and three southbound lanes. Immediately after beginning, it passes under the Atlantic City – Brigantine <b>Connector</b> and comes to a ramp that provides access from southbound Route 87 to the southbound <b>connector.</b> From here, the route widens to seven lanes, with two northbound lanes and five southbound lanes. It passes by the Borgata casino, with a ramp from the casino to the northbound direction. The road becomes a four-lane divided highway and passes under a ramp from the Atlantic City – Brigantine <b>Connector</b> to the Borgata before heading under northbound direction of the <b>connector.</b> Here, a ramp from the <b>connector</b> provides access to Route 87. A short distance later, the route comes to the northern terminus of Route 187 and turns north to follow Brigantine Boulevard, which is a four-lane divided highway.|$|E
5|$|Six years later, the US25 {{designation}} was decommissioned in Michigan, {{although all}} sections {{of it are}} still state highways. The southern section from the state line northward through Monroe was renumbered M-125 and the US25 designation was removed from US24 (Telegraph Road). In the Detroit area, the connection between US24 and I-75 in Woodhaven was redesignated as an unsigned <b>connector</b> highway (now <b>Connector</b> 24). The US25 designation was removed from I-75 northward into Detroit, while the routing along Clark Street became an unsigned <b>connector</b> highway (now <b>Connector</b> 850). The routing along Fort Street and Gratiot Avenue was numbered as M-3. The US25 designation was removed from I-94, and the routing through Port Huron and northward to Port Austin became part of an extended M-25. One segment of highway near Port Huron became an unsigned highway now designed <b>Connector</b> 25.|$|E
50|$|Twist-on <b>connectors</b> {{are also}} known as wire nuts, wire <b>connectors,</b> cone <b>connectors,</b> or thimble <b>connectors.</b> One trade name for such <b>connectors,</b> Marrette, {{is derived from the}} name of their {{inventor}} (see History).|$|R

50|$|Later analog video (VGA and later) {{adapters}} generally replaced these <b>connectors</b> with DE15 high-density sockets (though {{some early}} VGA devices still used DE9 <b>connectors).</b> DE15 <b>connectors</b> {{are similar to}} DE9 <b>connectors</b> (see above).|$|R
5|$|The {{standard}} <b>connectors</b> {{were designed}} to be more robust than many past <b>connectors.</b> This is because USB is hot-pluggable, and the <b>connectors</b> would be used more frequently, and perhaps with less care, than previous <b>connectors.</b>|$|R
5|$|While <b>connector</b> {{interfaces}} can {{be designed}} to allow plugging with either orientation, the original design omitted such functionality to decrease manufacturing costs.

5|$|Conn. M-13 {{starts at}} exit164 along I-75/US23 north of Bay City. At the {{interchange}} that marks its southern terminus, the <b>connector</b> route continues {{to the north}} while the main I-75 freeway turns northwesterly. About three-quarters of a mile (1.2km) north, there is an interchange for Wilder Road. Traffic running southbound on the <b>connector</b> that wishes to continue northbound on I-75/US23 has to use Wilder Road to connect to the latter freeway. The <b>connector</b> route is bordered by fields and residential subdivisions as it continues north to the community of Kawkawlin. The freeway ends at an at-grade intersection with M-13.|$|E
5|$|DisplayPort <b>connector</b> is {{compatible}} with HDMI and can trasmit single-link DVI and HDMI 1.2/1.4/2.0 signals using attached passive adapters or adapter cables. The source device includes a dual-mode transmitter which supports both LVDS signals used by DisplayPort and TMDS signals used by DVI/HDMI. The same external <b>connector</b> is used for both protocols - when DVI/HDMI passive adapter is attached, the transmitter circuit switches to TDMS mode. DisplayPort Dual-mode ports and cables/adapters are typically marked with the DisplayPort++ logo. Thunderbolt ports with mDP <b>connector</b> also supports Dual-mode passive HDMI adapters/cables. Conversion to dual-link DVI and component video (VGA/YPbPr) requires active powered adapters.|$|E

5|$|In 1954, a new US223 bypass {{was built}} around Adrian, {{resulting}} in the relocation of M-34 to end at BUS US223/M-52. Finally, in 1966, when a new alignment of M-99 highway was opened, the western terminus of M-34 was scaled back to end at the new highway near Osseo. In 2003, the short <b>connector</b> between M-34 and US223 was abandoned and obliterated. Industrial Drive, which is known internally at MDOT as <b>Connector</b> 34, is a new <b>connector</b> between the two highways that was assumed into the state trunkline system at the same time.|$|E

40|$|This study investigates {{patterns}} of <b>connectors</b> in L 2 academic {{writing and the}} effects of instruction on students’ output in the use of <b>connectors.</b> Specifically, the current study examines 1) how ESL learners’ writing proficiency relates to sentence <b>connectors,</b> 2) whether different levels of learners shows distinctive patterns in the use of sentence <b>connectors,</b> and 3) different approaches in grammar instruction (structured input approach, and text-based approach) facilitates the appropriate use of <b>connectors.</b> Students’ writing samples from the placement test at an academic English program was analyzed. The results showed no meaningful differences in the use of <b>connectors</b> among participants whose level of proficiency differ.

40|$|Shear <b>connectors</b> {{are used}} in steel beam–concrete slabs of {{composite}} frame and bridge structures to transfer shear force according to design loads. The existing Y-type perfobond rib shear <b>connectors</b> are designed for girder slabs of composite bridges. Therefore, the rib and transverse rebars of the conventional Y-type perfobond rib shear <b>connectors</b> are extremely large for the composite frames of building structures. Thus, this paper proposes stubby Y-type perfobond rib shear <b>connectors,</b> redefining the existing <b>connectors,</b> for composite frames of building structures; these were used to perform push-out tests. These shear <b>connectors</b> have relatively small ribs compared to the conventional Y-type perfobond rib shear <b>connectors.</b> To confirm the shear resistance of these stubby shear <b>connectors,</b> we performed an experiment by using transverse rebars D 13 and D 16. The results indicate that these shear <b>connectors</b> have suitable shear strength and ductility for application in composite frame structures. The shear strengths obtained using D 13 and D 16 were not significantly different. However, the ductility of the shear <b>connectors</b> with D 16 was 45. 1 % {{higher than that of}} the shear <b>connectors</b> with D 13...|$|R
