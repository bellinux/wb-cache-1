5000|$|<b>Cost</b> <b>center</b> {{accounting}} is {{the most}} important element in GPK. A <b>cost</b> <b>center</b> can be defined as an area of responsibility that is assigned to a manager who is held accountable for its performance. It is common to have from 200 to over 2,000 cost centers in a typical GPK adopter organization.|$|E
50|$|Step 5: Identification of each {{input and}} output of every <b>cost</b> <b>center.</b>|$|E
50|$|Secondary <b>Cost</b> <b>Centers</b> - are <b>cost</b> <b>centers</b> that incur <b>costs</b> but {{exist to}} support the {{functions}} of the primary <b>cost</b> <b>centers.</b> Typical secondary <b>cost</b> <b>centers</b> include: information technology (IT) services and; human resources (HR) areas that offer hiring and training functions.|$|R
50|$|<b>Cost</b> <b>Centers</b> can be trimmed {{down to the}} {{smallest}} segregated tasks within Departments. It {{is not necessary to}} consider departments as outright <b>cost</b> <b>centers.</b> Some companies adopt a different approach when treating <b>cost</b> <b>centers.</b>|$|R
50|$|With the GPK {{marginal}} costing approach, primary <b>cost</b> <b>centers</b> outputs {{consumed by}} products/services reflect direct causal relationships, {{as well as}} causally-linked costs originating from supporting secondary <b>cost</b> <b>centers</b> that primary <b>cost</b> <b>centers</b> need to function. As such, both of these causally-linked outputs—if proportional in nature—will vary with product/service output volume (albeit the secondaries only indirectly) and {{are reflected in the}} appropriate product/service contribution margin in the P&L.|$|R
50|$|Typical {{examples}} of responsibility centers are the profit {{center and the}} <b>cost</b> <b>center.</b>|$|E

50|$|Total {{absorption}} costing (TAC) is {{a method}} of Accounting cost which entails {{the full cost of}} manufacturing or providing a service. TAC includes not just the costs of materials and labour, but also of all manufacturing overheads (whether ‘fixed’ or ‘variable’).The cost of each <b>cost</b> <b>center</b> can be direct or indirect cost. The direct cost can be easily identified with individual cost centers. whereas the indirect cost can't be easily identified with the <b>cost</b> <b>center.</b> The distribution of overhead among the departments is called apportionment.|$|E
50|$|The Investment Center {{takes care}} of Revenues, Cost and Assets, while a Profit Center deals with {{revenues}} and <b>costs</b> and <b>Cost</b> <b>Centers</b> with <b>costs</b> only. This is a clear sign of how the span of control and span of accountability grow from <b>Cost</b> <b>Centers</b> to Investment ones.|$|R
50|$|Cost {{allocation}} is {{a process}} of providing relief to shared service organization's <b>cost</b> <b>centers</b> that provide a product or service. In turn, the associated expense is assigned to internal clients' <b>cost</b> <b>centers</b> that consume the products and services. For example, the CIO may provide all IT services within the company and assign the costs back to the business units that consume each offering.|$|R

50|$|As a multi-variant {{mathematical}} playspace {{used for}} identifying the optimal boundary spaces (the Pareto frontier) where the multiple variants have strong interdependencies. The term, Tradespace, {{is a combination}} of the words “trade-off” and “playspace”, where “trade-off” indicates the method of traversing the Tradespace in search of the optimal boundary space (e.g., trading off a cost in one <b>cost</b> <b>center</b> (variant A) for a cost in another <b>cost</b> <b>center</b> (variant B)). Tradespace analysis is used in this context by NASA, DARPA and MIT for analyzing the complex resource, costs and provisioning involved in large projects with multiple stakeholders and multiple objectives.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVES: Nursing cost-center limits were examined, {{along with}} their effects on Medicaid. METHODS: A {{national}} survey of Medicaid nursing facility reimbursement provided data on <b>cost</b> <b>centers</b> for nursing, administration, and capital, whether in specific, larger, or multiple <b>cost</b> <b>centers.</b> RESULTS: Most states impose nursing and administration limits. Far fewer states impose capital limits, but only capital limits {{may be related to}} constraint of reimbursement rates. CONCLUSIONS: Shifting toward limiting capital costs, or simply eliminating cost-center limits, might accommodate cost control while removing negative constraints on direct resident care...|$|R
