5|$|A week-long {{visit to}} White House Farm had been {{arranged}} for the August at the Bambers' request; the plan was that the boys would visit their grandparents with Sheila before going on holiday to Norway with their father. Daniel and Nicholas were reluctant {{to stay at the}} farm. They disliked that June made them pray, and in the <b>car</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> asked their father to speak to her about it. In addition Daniel had become a vegetarian and was worried about being forced to eat meat. When their father dropped them off at the house on 4 August, {{it was the last time}} he saw them. The boys are buried together in Highgate Cemetery. Sheila was cremated, and the casket with her ashes was placed in their coffin.|$|E

25|$|Although Angie {{tries to}} stop drinking, her {{attempts}} always fail dismally {{and by the}} end of the year she is arrested for drink-driving when she crashes Den's <b>car</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> home from a darts match. In episodes broadcast in 1986, Den's mistress, Jan, starts to frequent The Queen Vic. The physical arrival of Jan sends Angie's marriage into further decline as she is unable to contain her jealousy and anger. Angie becomes so depressed that she takes a near lethal cocktail of booze and pills in an attempted suicide. By chance, Den returns home early following an argument with Jan, discovers Angie and rushes her to the hospital where she has her stomach pumped. Angie recovers, but is left shaken when she discovers how close to death she actually came. Upon recovering, Angie decides to play Den at his own game and so she begins another affair with Andy O'Brien (Ross Davidson). Den is furious when he discovers them in bed together, but his rage is short-lived as he has more pressing things on his mind, such as the birth of his illegitimate daughter, Vicki Fowler (Emma Herry). Angie's affair with Andy only lasts a month, ending when Andy reunites with his ex-girlfriend Debbie Wilkins (Shirley Cheriton). Andy dies in a road accident shortly afterwards.|$|E

500|$|Dragonlance is {{a shared}} {{universe}} created by Laura and Tracy Hickman, and expanded by Tracy Hickman and Margaret Weis {{under the direction}} of TSR, Inc. into a series of fantasy novels. [...] The Hickmans conceived Dragonlance while driving in their <b>car</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> to TSR for a job interview. At TSR Tracy Hickman met Margaret Weis, his future writing partner, and they gathered a group of associates to play the Dungeons & Dragons role-playing game. The adventures during that game inspired a series of gaming modules, a series of novels, licensed products such as board games, and lead miniature figures.|$|E
500|$|... "Mr. Pitiful" [...] was {{recorded}} in December 1964 at the Stax studios. The song was written by both guitarist Steve Cropper and Redding, and was their first collaboration. It was inspired by and written {{as a response to}} a statement made by radio disc jockey Moohah Williams, who had nicknamed Redding [...] "Mr. Pitiful" [...] for sounding pitiful when singing ballads. Cropper heard about this and, while taking a shower, got the idea it would make a good song. In the <b>car</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> to the studio, Cropper proposed the idea with a melody already in mind, humming it to Redding. By the time they reached the studio, the song was written and they recorded it in two or three takes. It was released as a single with the B-side [...] "That's How Strong My Love Is". The song became a hit and the album's most successful track, peaking at number 10 on the Billboard R and at number 41 on Billboard Hot 100 chart.|$|E
500|$|As 1980 began, {{the band}} {{began work on}} a new album that would {{eventually}} become Back in Black, but Bon Scott would not live to see it finished. On 19 February 1980, Scott passed out in the <b>car</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> back to friend Alistair Kinnear's house {{after a night of}} heavy drinking at the Music Machine club in London. Upon arrival at his home, Kinnear was unable to move Scott from the car into his home for the night, so he left him in the car overnight to sleep off the effects of the alcohol. Unable to wake Scott late the next morning, Kinnear rushed him to King's College Hospital in Camberwell, where Scott was pronounced dead on arrival. Pulmonary aspiration of vomit was the cause of Scott's death, and the official cause was listed as [...] "acute alcohol poisoning". Scott's family buried him in Fremantle, Western Australia, the area they emigrated to when he was a boy.|$|E

500|$|McCartney {{first used}} {{drugs in the}} Beatles' Hamburg days, when they often used Preludin to {{maintain}} their energy while performing for long periods. Bob Dylan introduced them to marijuana in a New York hotel room in 1964; McCartney recalls getting [...] "very high" [...] and [...] "giggling uncontrollably". His use of the drug soon became habitual, and according to Miles, McCartney wrote the lyrics [...] "another kind of mind" [...] in [...] "Got to Get You into My Life" [...] specifically as a reference to cannabis. During the filming of Help!, McCartney occasionally smoked a joint in the <b>car</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> to the studio during filming, and often forgot his lines. Director Richard Lester overheard two physically attractive women trying to persuade McCartney to use heroin, but he refused. Introduced to cocaine by Robert Fraser, McCartney used the drug regularly during the recording of Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, and {{for about a year}} total but stopped because of his dislike of the unpleasant melancholy he felt afterwards.|$|E
500|$|Foremost of the disorienting effects, {{to critics}} and scholars, is Whedon's use {{of sound and}} silence. While Buffy {{performs}} CPR, she cracks one of Joyce's ribs with a startling snap. After Buffy vomits on the floor, she stands in the back doorway listening to life carrying on: children playing, someone practicing a trumpet, and birds singing. Long pauses between dialogue create gaps that turn awkward as the characters {{try to think of}} what to say, made especially notable in a series famous for its rapid banter. The transition between the Christmas dinner scene and the living room scene is abrupt, and the sound of Buffy and Joyce shouting because they dropped a pie on the floor carries over into the silence of Joyce's lifeless face and Buffy standing alone in the living room. This effect is also used when shifting between Buffy's alternate version of her mother being [...] "good as new" [...] in the hospital and the paramedics trying to revive her. In the <b>car</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> to Willow's dormitory, Anya is shot by a camera mounted on the front bumper, separated from the audience by the windshield. Xander, driving, faces the other way; neither of them speak and only the sound of the car can be heard. Joyce Millman at Salon.com writes of the sound issues, [...] "The effect was almost Bergmanesque in its starkness. The spooky stillness and the long, spacey pauses in conversation as characters struggled to articulate their feelings exaggerated the sense of time elongating and standing still." ...|$|E
