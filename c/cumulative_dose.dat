40|$|This study {{evaluated}} a <b>cumulative</b> <b>dosing</b> {{procedure for}} drug discrimination with human participants. Four participants learned to discriminate triazolam (0. 35 mg/ 70 kg) from placebo. A crossover design {{was used to}} compare the results under a single dosing procedure with results obtained under a <b>cumulative</b> <b>dosing</b> procedure. Under the single dosing procedure, a dose of triazolam (0, 0. 05, 0. 15, or 0. 35 mg/ 70 kg) or secobarbital (0, 25, 75, or 175 mg/ 70 kg) was administered 45 min before assessment. Determining each dose-effect curve thus required four sessions. Under the <b>cumulative</b> <b>dosing</b> procedure, four doses of triazolam (0, 0. 05, 0. 10, and 0. 20 mg/ 70 kg) or secobarbital (0, 25, 50, and 100 mg/ 70 kg) were administered approximately 55 min apart, producing a complete dose-effect curve in one four-trial session. Regardless of procedure, triazolam and secobarbital produced discriminative stimulus and self-reported effects similar to previous single dosing studies in humans. Shifts to the right in cumulative dose-effect curves compared to single dose-effect curves occurred on several self-report measures. When qualitative stimulus functions rather than quantitative functions are of interest, application of <b>cumulative</b> <b>dosing</b> may increase efficiency in human drug discrimination...|$|R
2500|$|Stereotactic {{radiosurgery}} {{was first}} developed in 1949 by the Swedish neurosurgeon Lars Leksell to treat small {{targets in the}} brain that were not amenable to conventional surgery. The initial stereotactic instrument he conceived used probes and electrodes. The first attempt to supplant the electrodes with radiation {{was made in the}} early fifties, with x-rays. The principle of this instrument was to hit the intra-cranial target with narrow beams of radiation from multiple directions. The beam paths converge in the target volume, delivering a lethal <b>cumulative</b> <b>dose</b> of radiation there, while limiting the dose to the adjacent healthy tissue. Ten years later significant progress had been made, due in considerable measure to the contribution of the physicists Kurt Liden and Börje Larsson. [...] At this time, stereotactic proton beams had replaced the x-rays. The heavy particle beam presented as an excellent replacement for the surgical knife, but the synchrocyclotron was too clumsy. Leksell proceeded to develop a practical, compact, precise and simple tool which could be handled by the surgeon himself. In 1968 this resulted in the Gamma Knife, which was installed at the Karolinska Institute and consisted of several cobalt-60 radioactive sources placed in a kind of helmet with central channels for irradiation with gamma rays. This prototype was designed to produce slit-like radiation lesions for functional neurosurgical procedures to treat pain, movement disorders, or behavioral disorders that did not respond to conventional treatment. The success of this first unit led to the construction of a second device, containing 179 cobalt-60 sources. This second Gamma Knife unit was designed to produce spherical lesions to treat brain tumors and intracranial arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). In the 1980s the third and fourth units (with 201 cobalt-60 sources) were installed in Buenos Aires, Argentina, and Sheffield, England. The fifth Gamma Knife was installed at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center in Pittsburgh in 1987.|$|E

40|$|We studied 21 COPD {{patients}} in stable clinical conditions {{to evaluate whether}} changes in lung function induced by <b>cumulative</b> <b>doses</b> of salbutamol alter diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO), and whether this relates {{to the extent of}} emphysema as assessed by high resolution computed tomography (HRCT) quantitative analysis. Spirometry and DLCO were measured before and after <b>cumulative</b> <b>doses</b> of inhaled salbutamol (from 200 μg to 1000 μg). Salbutamol caused significant increments of forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1), and flows at 30 % of control FVC taken from both partial and maximal forced expiratory maneuvers. Functional residual capacity and residual volume were reduced, while total lung capacity did not change significantly. DLCO increased progressively with the incremental doses of salbutamol, but this became significant only at the highest dose (1000 μg) and was independent of the extent of emphysema, as assessed by radiological parameters. No significant changes were observed in CO transfer factor (DLCO/VA) and alveolar volume (VA).

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The {{purpose of}} the study was to assess the effects of Escherichia coli STa (heat stable) toxin on {{isolated}} human myometrial response to oxytocin.

Uterine contractility in response to <b>cumulative</b> <b>doses</b> of E. coli STa toxin was recorded, as well as uterine response to <b>cumulative</b> <b>doses</b> of oxytocin before and after incubation with STa toxin or vehicle. The 50 th percentile effective oxytocin concentration (EC 50) of muscle strips with and without spontaneous activity before and after the incubation with STa toxin or vehicle was calculated.
