30|$|Lateral {{dimensions}} of the <b>cantilever</b> <b>platform</b> and thicknesses of the constituent layers are designed to meet specifications of mechanical stability, i.e., spring constant, resonant frequency, and electrical sensitivity. To ensure stability and compliance of the cantilever, the spring constant is typically chosen {{in the range from}} 0.1  ×  10 − 3 to 10  N m− 1, whereas to reduce the vulnerability of the sensor from external vibrational noise, the sensor is designed with resonant frequency more than 5  kHz. The lateral {{dimensions of}} the cantilever are also governed by factors like piezoresistor coverage area, sensor die size, etc. Compared to the typical thickness of solid-state semiconductor cantilevers (less than 1  µm), the thickness of SU- 8 cantilevers is kept more than 1  µm mainly to ensure mechanical stability of the <b>cantilever</b> <b>platform.</b> It may be noted that in all the devices mentioned, careful design is performed such that the distance between the mid-plane of piezoresistor and the neutral axis of the cantilever stack is maximum, thereby maximizing the electrical sensitivity. For instance, in most cases, the thickness of the structural layer is kept {{more than three times the}} isolation layer thickness. Even though a separate Au immobilization layer is used, its thickness is kept minimal (nm) to maximize electrical sensitivity.|$|E

Thermal and electrical characterization of the thermal bimorph actuators showed low influence in the platforms temperature and low power consumption (< 35 μW) mainly due to the natural isolation of the structure. Tip displacements larger than 500 μm were achieved.

30|$|Structural {{layer of}} the {{cantilever}} forms the mechanical platform which not only provides mechanical stability to the sensor, but also acts as a stress collector. To perform the electromechanical transduction of structural deformation of the cantilever into an equivalent electrical signal, a piezoresistive layer is deposited atop or doped in the structural layer. Functional layers of the sensor include an isolation layer and an immobilization layer. For reliable operation of the sensor in liquid medium, the piezoresistor is encapsulated by an isolation layer, whereas the cantilever surface is grafted or immobilized with receptors that have high affinity toward the target molecules. Target–receptor interactions on the cantilever surface result in redistribution of energy states on the cantilever surface which is translated into a net cantilever deflection. Even though immobilization of receptors can be performed on the isolation layer, to improve the magnitude of surface stress generated on the <b>cantilever</b> <b>platform,</b> a separate immobilization layer is preferred [50].|$|E
30|$|In cantilever-based {{chemical}} and biological sensors, target molecules are assayed by converting the mechanical deformation of cantilever platforms into an equivalent electrical signal. In this regard, receptor molecules which have affinity toward target molecules are immobilized on the sensor surface. When exposed to target molecules, target–receptor interactions take place on a sensor surface. These target–receptor interactions induce changes in cantilever characteristics {{that are in the}} form of either cantilever displacement (static mode) or change in its resonant frequency (dynamic mode). The aforementioned changes in cantilever characteristics are used to assay the type and quantity of target molecules. Although dynamic mode of measurement depicts higher resolution than static mode, it suffers from fluid damping effects that severely affect sensor sensitivity. In static mode, the measuring cantilever is typically placed in a micro-fluidic chamber with inlet and outlet valves designed {{in such a way that}} the fluid flow is laminar, reducing any noise from turbulence. Mechanical stability of the measuring cantilever especially against environmental vibrational noise is ensured by carefully designing the <b>cantilever</b> <b>platform</b> with a high value of resonant frequency. In addition, specific immobilization protocol and proper cleaning techniques reduce cross-sensitivity and biological noise floor. In static mode of operation, conversion of target–receptor interaction-induced deflection of the <b>cantilever</b> <b>platform</b> into an equivalent electrical signal is performed either by optical [23] or by electrical readout methods like piezoelectric [24], piezoresistive [25], and capacitive [26] techniques. Typically, in optics-based readout mechanisms, cantilever deflection is measured with a laser source that is incident on the cantilever surface and a position detector assembly that calibrates the cantilever deflection in terms of shift in laser spot from the initial position. Further, integrated optical readout on waveguides for cantilever sensors is also an alternative option [27]. Such opto-mechanical systems depict high resolution. However, in general optics-based readout methods suffer from limitations due to bulkiness of measurement setup, continuous need for realignment and recalibration, ineffectiveness in opaque medium, complexity in multiplexing, etc. Among the electrical readout techniques, piezoresistive readout is a highly preferred choice due to its advantages like compactness, better scalability, larger dynamic range, possibility of multiplexed operation, independence of operational medium, label-free detection, flexibility of on-chip or off-chip signal processing circuitry, compatibility with integrated circuit (IC) fabrication process flow, to cite a few. The aforementioned factors play a critical role in developing self-sensing, compact, and multi-functional sensors, especially for point-of-care testing (PoCT) and micro-total analysis systems (µTAS).|$|E

This will be the foundation for possible applications of biosensors applicable to real-life samples containing not only the analyte of interest, but many background ‘contaminants’. These three challenges are: 1. How can large surface stress signals be achieved? Any contaminants on the surface will reduce the available surface area and therefore lead to smaller surface stress change. We will present an electrochemical cleaning protocol that results in a clean gold surface, leading to a large and quantitatively reproducible surface stress signal when surface charge densities change. 2. How can the signal-to-noise ratio be improved? An optimal probe density is required for good signal-to-noise ratios of the surface stress change. This is achieved by using a multi-step functionalization protocol recently described by Nagai et al. [15]. 3. How can sensors with long term stability and realistic shelf life be manufactured?

30|$|Piezoresistive SU- 8 {{polymeric}} cantilever sensors {{emerged as}} one of the potential replacements for solid-state semiconductor-based designs mainly due to their high performance-to-cost ratio. The research and development of SU- 8 polymer-based sensors has been a vibrant field. Continuous endeavor of researchers in developing piezoresistive SU- 8 polymeric cantilever sensors has made <b>cantilever</b> <b>platform</b> a universal sensing tool for chemical and biological sensing applications. In this article, we have summarized the developments in piezoresistive SU- 8 cantilever sensors and critically analyzed their performance considering the material selection, design, and fabrication aspects, and their interdependence. A brief insight into various theories of surface stress generation is detailed. Composite piezoresistive SU- 8 micro-cantilever sensors have been classified as hetero- and completely polymeric cantilever. Specifics related to material selection, design, and fabrication of the aforementioned types of SU- 8 polymeric cantilevers along with their performances are elucidated in detail. In addition, a critical comparison of the performance of piezoresistive SU- 8 cantilever variants with their solid-state semiconductor counterparts using analytical models is also made. Finally, we cited existing challenges and various applications of piezoresistive SU- 8 cantilever sensors as a chemical and biological sensing platform.|$|E
30|$|The {{performance}} optimization of cantilever sensors using various innovative {{designs and}} process optimizations has been also reported. Sensor performance optimization {{has been carried}} out by careful structural optimization [204, 205, 206, 207] and material selection [208, 209, 210]. The performance of SU- 8 polymeric piezoresistive micro-cantilever sensors is determined not only by electrical sensitivity governed by material parameters of piezoresistor gauge factor and Young’s modulus of structural layer, but also by geometrical factors and noises (both intrinsic and extrinsic). Geometrical parameters include the <b>cantilever</b> <b>platform</b> and piezoresistor shape (including constituent layer dimensions) and are governed by desired electrical sensitivity and mechanical stability of the sensor from external vibrational noises. In addition, the sensor design is also governed by noise sources like thermal drift of sensor output, invalid detection due to temperature variation of cantilever surface induced by either external temperature change or joule heating of the dc-excited piezoresistor, variation in sensor output due to change in pH of operational medium, plastic deformation and electro-migration (in case of metal piezoresistors) due to joule heating, change in cantilever resonant frequency due to moisture absorption by SU- 8 polymer, biological noise floor due to non-specific target–receptor interactions, to mention a few. Importantly, the aforementioned factors are limited by fabrication constraints.|$|E

40|$|Cantilever sensors have {{attracted}} considerable attention {{over the last}} decade because of their potential as a highly sensitive sensor platform for high throughput and multiplexed detection of proteins and nucleic acids. A micromachined <b>cantilever</b> <b>platform</b> integrates nanoscale science and microfabrication technology for the label-free detection of biological molecules, allowing miniaturization. Molecular adsorption, when restricted to a single side of a deformable cantilever beam, results in measurable bending of the cantilever. This nanoscale deflection is caused by a variation in the cantilever surface stress due to biomolecular interactions and can be measured by optical or electrical means, thereby reporting on the presence of biomolecules. Biological specificity in detection is typically achieved by immobilizing selective receptors or probe molecules {{on one side of the}} cantilever using surface functionalization processes. When target molecules are injected into the fluid bathing the cantilever, the cantilever bends as a function of the number of molecules bound to the probe molecules on its surface.

40|$|Over the years, piezoresistive nano {{cantilever}} sensors {{have been}} extensively investigated for various biological sensing applications. Piezoresistive cantilever sensor {{is a composite}} structure with different materials constituting its various layers. Design and modeling of such sensors become challenging since their response is governed by the interplay between their geometrical and constituent material parameters. Even though, piezoresistive nano cantilever biosensors have several advantages, they suffer from a limitation {{in the form of}} self-heating induced inaccuracy which is seldom considered in design stages. Although, a few simplified mathematical models have been reported which incorporate the self-heating effect, several assumptions made in the modeling stages result in inaccuracy in predicting sensor terminal response. In this paper, we model and investigate the effect of self-heating on the thermo-electro-mechanical response of piezoresistive cantilever sensors {{as a function of the}} relative geometries of the piezoresistor and the <b>cantilever</b> <b>platform.</b> Finite element method (FEM) based numerical computations are used to model the target-receptor interactions induced surface stress response in steady state and maximize the electrical sensitivity to thermal sensitivity ratio of the sensor. Simulation results show that the conduction mode of heat transfer is the dominant heat transfer mechanism. Furthermore, the isolation and immobilization layers play a critical role in determining the thermal sensitivity of the sensor. It is found that the shorter and wider cantilever platforms are more suitable to reduce self-heating induced inaccuracies. In addition, results depict that the piezoresistor width plays a more dominant role in determining the thermal drift induced inaccuracies compared to the piezoresistor length. It is found that for surface stress sensors at large piezoresistor width, the electrical sensitivity to thermal sensitivity ratio improves...|$|E
30|$|Piezoresistor {{geometry}} {{is chosen}} {{based on the}} desired nominal resistance value and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Lower limit of nominal resistance is determined by joule heating-induced self-heating effects and electro-migration, whereas its upper limit is determined by specifications of driving current and interface circuitry. Thus, typically the value of nominal resistance of piezoresistors is kept in kΩ range. In general, the piezoresistors {{are designed to be}} U-shaped to improve reliability by avoiding interconnects on the <b>cantilever</b> <b>platform.</b> Since the electrical resistivity of metals is low (in the range of µ Ω-cm), when metal piezoresistors are designed in U shape, their nominal resistance is only a few ohms, which results in large joule heating. Thus, strategically the metal piezoresistors are designed lengthier to obtain large nominal resistance. Therefore, in few cases, rather than the conventional U-shaped design, the piezoresistors are meander-shaped. However, the coverage of the piezoresistor is limited by the cantilever lateral dimensions, since lengthier cantilever platforms result in reduced mechanical stability and electrical sensitivity. On the other hand, by tailoring the electrical resistivity of the piezoresistor material and careful design, it is possible to realize U-shaped metal piezoresistors. Similarly, the width and thickness of the piezoresistor are designed to obtain a desirable nominal resistance. Thickness of metal piezoresistors has an additional constraint on noise figure, since thinner metal piezoresistors show higher electrical noise level. The need for high nominal resistance value to reduce the current density and therefore the joule heating effects is achieved by using lower supply voltages. In the case of doped polysilicon or doped SU- 8 piezoresistors, the electrical resistivity is controlled by varying the dopant concentration. Thus, by optimizing the dopant concentration and geometry of the piezoresistor, desired nominal resistance is achieved. Typical magnitude of surface stress sensitivity and deflection sensitivity of SU- 8 piezoresistive cantilever sensors are in the range of a few ×  10 − 3 (N/m)− 1 and a few ×  10 − 6 to ×  10 − 9 (nm)− 1 which can detect miniscule forces of pN magnitude and lower.|$|E

30|$|Compared to {{metal and}} doped polysilicon-based {{piezoresistor}}s, the spin-coated CB-doped piezoresistor overcomes {{the limitations of}} higher-temperature deposition techniques. In addition, since (conductive) SU- 8 itself is used as the piezoresistor, the limitation of residual stress generated due to two dissimilar materials, which are found between metal–SU- 8 and polysilicon–SU- 8 <b>cantilever</b> <b>platforms,</b> is overcome. However, tight control over the process parameters becomes essential, especially to realize SU- 8 as the piezoresistor element. Furthermore, since the polymer matrix absorbs water from its surroundings SU- 8 is susceptible to humidity [269, 270, 271, 272]. The absorption of humidity results in variations in the resonant frequency of SU- 8 polymeric cantilevers, which affects the mechanical stability of the sensor [273]. However, humidity-related drifts and resist aging-related issues can be reduced by process optimization [66, 274].

30|$|The initial AFMs and {{cantilever}} sensors {{were either}} optics- or resonant frequency shift readout-based systems (where, {{in the former}} technique, a laser beam is incident {{at the apex of}} the cantilever and its shift in position is measured with a photodetector, and in the latter, the shift in the resonant frequency of the cantilever is measured using a piezoelectric actuation system). Even though optics- and resonant frequency shift-based readout techniques exhibited cantilever displacement resolution in nanometer (nm) [126] and mass detection sensitivity in picogram (pg) [127] range, their applicability was restricted to vacuum and air operational medium mainly due to the following reasons: (1) inaccurate measurement in liquid medium due to fluid damping effect, (2) ineffectiveness in opaque liquid, (3) bulkiness of measurement setup, and (4) need for continuous realignment and recalibration. To overcome the limitations of optics- and resonant frequency-based readout methods, self-sensing piezoresistive readout technique was adopted by various researchers in the mid- 1990 s. Piezoresistive readout was first demonstrated by Tortonese et al. in 1991 [128] in AFM cantilevers. Even though other integrated readout techniques like capacitive [129], piezoelectric [130], tunneling [131], and integrated optical waveguide [132] were also implemented, piezoresistive readout demonstrated better performance. A few early illustrations of piezoresistive cantilever-based biological and chemical sensors include analysis of the dehydration of copper sulfate pentahydrate with picogram resolution [133], detection of alcohol vapor with detection limits below 10  ppm [134], measurement of temperature, humidity and alcohol with a minimum detectable cantilever deflection of 1 Å and a deflection sensitivity of 1.6  nm (µW)− 1 [135], investigation of surface stress due to self-assembled alkanethiol on gold surface [136]. Furthermore, to reduce the probability of non-specific detection, specific receptors, which have high affinity toward target molecules, were immobilized on the cantilever surface. The specific bindings of target molecules on the <b>cantilever</b> <b>platform</b> resulted in either a change in its mass or a variation in its surface energies that resulted in cantilever deflection.|$|E

Primary {{focus of this}} review is to provide comprehensive information {{on the development of}} piezoresistive SU- 8 cantilever sensors with a focus on the design-, fabrication-, and performance-related aspects. Organization of this article is as follows: Sect.  2 details device configuration and working principle of piezoresistive SU- 8 polymeric cantilever sensors. Due to their high surface-to-volume ratio, micro-cantilever platforms respond to changes in their own characteristics like mass and spring constant, and thereby to forces even in the range of a few pN. Therefore, cantilever platforms have been extensively explored as mechanical sensing platforms. The cantilever platform-based sensors can be operated in either mass or end point deflection mode. Specifics of basic sensing modes of cantilever sensors are summarized in Sect.  3. Binding of chemical and biological analytes on the cantilever surface induces change in surface stress. Although surface stress-based sensors have found versatile applications, there is no clear understanding on the phenomenon of surface stress generation when target and receptor interact on a surface. The origin, type, and magnitude of surface stress generated due to different target–receptor interactions on cantilever surfaces along with different theoretical and experimental data related to surface stress are detailed in Sect.  4. Due to its origin from AFM, the initial piezoresistive <b>cantilever</b> <b>platform</b> surface stress sensors were based on solid-state semiconductors. The evolution of polymeric cantilevers from their semiconductor counterparts is summarized in Sect.  5. In the last two decades, the piezoresistive element in SU- 8 piezoresistive cantilever sensors has been realized with different materials. Specifics of variants of piezoresistive SU- 8 polymeric cantilevers which include their classification, structural details, and functional features are explained in Sect.  6. Variants of piezoresistive SU- 8 cantilever sensor differ in geometrical design as well as fabrication aspects. The fabrication details of different classes of piezoresistive SU- 8 polymeric cantilever sensors covering the fabrication process involved in the same are summarized in Sect.  7. Soon after its inception, SU- 8 piezoresistive cantilever sensors have been used as an investigation and detection tool for assaying versatile chemical and biological entities. Typical applications of SU- 8 polymeric cantilevers as chemical and biological sensors are summarized in Sect.  8. Finally, in Sect.  9, we discuss the challenges, possible solutions, and future perspectives of SU- 8 polymer-based piezoresistive cantilever sensors as the next-generation sensing tool.|$|E

They consist of three octagonal reinforced-concrete towers of 30 ft, 37 ft and 46 ft in height, with sides 1.5 ft in width, surmounted by <b>cantilevered</b> octagonal concrete <b>platforms</b> on which stand sealed-beam lights. The lights are accessed by ladders which extend up the columns through an opening in the platform. Each column carries a steel daymark painted black and white.|$|R
