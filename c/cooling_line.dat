40|$|This note {{describes}} some of {{the constraints}} on muon diagnostics for the neutrino source and considers useful options. Many of these issues will also apply at some level {{to the design of}} the muon cooling experiment. Although measurements of muon beams have been made for years, the high precision, high intensities, limited access, and large backgrounds associated with the cooling environment may make the required measurements of the muon beam challenging. The primary problems seem to be associated with tuning and operating of the transverse cooling sections. At the upstream end of the <b>cooling</b> <b>line,</b> the total number of secondaries produced at the target will make any measurement of muons difficult, however at the downstream end of the <b>cooling</b> <b>line,</b> once pions and other particles have decayed or been removed by collimation, solenoidal focusing, momentum cuts or absorption, measurements using standard techniques should be much easier.

40|$|Gas {{has been}} {{detected}} {{in a number}} of debris disk systems. This gas may have arisen from grain sublimation or grain photodesorption. It interacts with the surrounding dust grains through a number of charge and heat exchanges. Studying the chemical composition and physical state of this gas can therefore reveal much about the dust component in these debris disks. We have produced a new code, ontario, to address gas emission from dusty gas-poor disks around A [...] F stars. This code computes the gas ionization and thermal balance self-consistently, with particular care taken of heating/cooling mechanisms. Line emission spectra are then produced for each species (up to zinc) by statistical equilibrium calculations of the atomic/ionic energy levels. For parameters that resemble the observed beta Pictoris gas disk, we find that the gas is primarily heated by photoelectric emission from dust grains, and primarily cooled through the CII 157. 7 micron line emission. The gas can be heated to a temperature that is warmer than that of the dust and may in some cases reach temperature for thermal escape. The dominant <b>cooling</b> <b>line,</b> CII 157. 7 micron, should be detectable by Herschel in these disks, while the OI 63. 2 micron line will be too faint. We also study the dependence of the <b>cooling</b> <b>line</b> fluxes on a variety of disk parameters, in light of the much improved sensitivity to thermal line emission in the mid/far infrared and at sub-millimeter wavelengths provided by, in particular, Herschel, SOFIA and ALMA.
