Approximately 60% of the region is dedicated to intensive agriculture. Urbanization is also very important as it comprises Montréal, Québec City and Ottawa within its area.|$|E

50|$|The spas {{were first}} {{mentioned}} in written documents dating to 1486, the Aquilea Document. The spas were {{owned by the}} Habsburgs for 30 years {{and then by the}} Counts of Celje (1456) together with the Laško Estate. Through history the baths owners changed numerous times. The first turnabout in the spa's history was in 1840, when the former wholesale merchant from Trieste Gustav Adolf Uhlich bought the spas on behalf of his wife Amalia because he was healed by the healing power of the thermal water there. This was when what had been a modest health resort was turned into the modern spas and given the name Rimske Toplice ('Roman Spas'). For the needs of the spa, two large wells were regulated and named Amalia's Spring (38.4 °C) and Roman Spring (36.3 °C). With the construction of the Sophia Manor, the number of rooms increased from 38 to 100 at first and then to over 200. On the even plateau with a chestnut tree promenade there was a spa church on one side and an orchestra pavilion on the other side. In the afternoon the orchestra played out in the open, on evenings in the spa salon. There was a billiard room, a tennis court in a nearby wood and on a steep meadow a roofed bowling alley. Because the Vienna-Trieste railroad passed Rimske Toplice after 1848; more guests visited the place, all of them better-off people from Trieste, Hungary, Zagreb, or even the United States. Most of them were Germans from all over the monarchy. A sensation for all of them was the visit of the British princess and Prussian heiress Victoria, who stayed at Rimske Toplice in 1879, using it {{as a starting point for}} trips in the surrounding countryside. The most distinguished guests had the habit of planting exotic trees in the spa’s park, so even nowadays you can see huge sequoias, <b>Canadian</b> <b>hemlocks,</b> cypresses, Californian cedars, and other interesting species.|$|R
2500|$|Ramsey’s Draft Wilderness is {{well known}} for its stands of old-growth <b>Canadian</b> <b>hemlock,</b> {{particularly}} in the northern reaches of Ramsey’s Draft, however these stands are under attack by the hemlock woolly adelgid and may not last much longer.

50|$|A. flavorubens was {{originally}} described {{from the state}} of Ohio, USA and is also known from forests associated with beech (Fagus grandifolia), oak (Quercus), pine (Pinus), birch (Betula), and also the <b>Canadian</b> <b>hemlock</b> (Tsuga canadensis) from the southeastern part of Canada to the state of Alabama in eastern North America, central Mexico, and southeastern Arizona.|$|E
50|$|Due to {{its unique}} location, {{the park is}} home to a number of species of flora that are more {{commonly}} found in the westernmost part of the state. Carolina and <b>Canadian</b> <b>hemlock</b> grow alongside each other, and in the spring visitors can view the colorful displays of rhododendron, mountain laurel, pinxter azalea, {{and a number of other}} wildflowers. Much of the park is an oak-hickory forest, with chestnut oak the dominant hardwood.|$|E

50|$|The beech-maple forest harbors a few {{tree species}} that are more common in cooler climates: yellow birch, <b>Canadian</b> <b>Hemlock</b> and Canada yew are common there. Some of these trees cling to the rock faces, their roots pushing into every {{available}} crevice. In {{the shelter of the}} roots and shaded by the leafy canopy above, ferns such as the Christmas fern and maidenhair fern grow in abundance. Others such as the marginal shield fern, grape fern, wood fern, and common polypody are more unusual for this part of the state.|$|E
5000|$|The {{vineyard}} is over 2500 ft {{above sea}} level, so cultivars were chosen that thrive {{in a cold}} climate. These cultivars are disease resistant and use a special trellis, the [...] "Vertical Shoot Positioning V-shaped system", developed by Dr. Daniel. By 2007 Daniel Vineyards was West Virginia's largest winery. It has hosted the West Virginia Spring Wine Festival each year since 1999. In 2008 the West Virginia Department of Conservation rated the vineyard as the third best conservation farm in West Virginia, {{due in part to}} features such as deer training fences and vegetation around the vineyard such as <b>Canadian</b> <b>hemlock,</b> Lombardy poplar, and roses. Special events such as birthdays and weddings are held at the vineyard.|$|E
40|$|The shear {{behaviors}} {{of a wall}} structure with diagonal wood bracing and wood panels (sheathing) were studied. The principal structural components of the wall were <b>Canadian</b> <b>Hemlock</b> (Canada Tsuga) and Japanese cedar (Sugi).

The test results from these studies also allowed the calculation of Shear Wall Multiplier Factors used for shear design of wooden structures in Japan...|$|E
40|$|Shape: Conical with nodding apex and branch tips Main features: <b>Canadian</b> <b>hemlock</b> {{is a large}} very {{beautiful}} and graceful conifer native to moist forests and stream banks of the Appalachian Mountains. Unlike most other conifers, it is shade tolerant but will tolerate full sun. Given appropriate conditions (well-drained moist soil and only minimal exposure to drought), this species makes a superb large landscape tree with only one exception. That exception is the hemlock wooly adelgid, an exotic insect pest, that is killing and weakening trees in native habitats {{as well as in}} landscapes. This adelgid has infested trees in over half of the hemlock’s native range, the Appalachian Mountains and adjacent areas (Hemlock Wooly Adelgid Infestations 2008); its spread is unimpeded and all our hemlocks are in peril. This pest can kill a tree within 4 to 10 years; it can also weaken a tree {{to the point that it}} becomes vulnerable to other insects and diseases. There are two control strategies for landscape Canadian hemlocks: 1) spray with a horticultural oil (at prescribed times). This is the least expensive and quite effective. 2) Inject the soil or tree with a systemic insecticide; this method is also quite effective, lasts for one to two years, but is relatively expensive. Consult the Virginia Pest Management Guide – Home Ornamentals: Insects of Trees and Shrubs for recommendations (see References section). In the case of large trees, one will have to contact a certified arborist with the necessary equipment to effectively reach all parts of the tree. Before planting <b>Canadian</b> <b>hemlock,</b> one must factor in the price of regular tree spraying as part of the required inputs for this species...|$|E
