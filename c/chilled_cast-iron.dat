5000|$|Grenfell was {{afterwards}} {{for many}} years associated with the experimental work of Armstrong, Whitworth & Co. He {{was the first to}} direct the Admiralty's attention to the night-sighting of guns and about 1891, on the introduction of the incandescent electric lamp, he invented his 'self-illuminating night sights for naval ordnance.' The invention was for fifteen years attached to all heavy guns in the British navy, and was adopted by some foreign navies. Grenfell {{was also one of the}} first to suggest the use of sight-scales marked in large plain figures for naval guns, and advocated, though without success, the adoption of a telescopic light for day use. He also worked out the arrangement subsequently adopted for quick-firing field artillery, by which the changes of angle between the line of sight and the axis of the bore which are required when firing at a moving target can be effected without altering the fine of sight.In April 1877, Grenfell read before the Institution of Naval Architects an able paper advocating the trial of Hermann Gruson's <b>chilled</b> <b>cast-iron</b> armour in England, and in 1887 he published 'Gr√ºson's <b>Chilled</b> <b>Cast-iron</b> Armour' (translated from the German of Julius von Schutz).|$|E
50|$|In 1842, {{he formed}} a {{partnership}} with Matthias W. Baldwin to manufacture steam locomotives in Philadelphia. Two years later he left Baldwin, and worked for the reorganized Morris Canal Company. In 1846, he opened his own factory to manufacture wheels for railway carriages. In 1847, he took out patents for the corrugated-plate carriage wheel and the curved corrugated-plate carriage wheel, and the following year for the process of annealing carriage wheels. This consisted of placing the wheels, soon after they were cast, in a heated furnace, where they were subjected to a further gradual increase of temperature, and were then slowly cooled for three days. The discovery of this process of annealing, as applied to <b>chilled</b> <b>cast-iron</b> wheels, marked an era {{in the history of}} railroads. It enabled trains to safely increase both loads and speed. Previous to this discovery it was impossible to cast wheels with solid hubs, and therefore impossible to secure them rigidly to the axle. Now the whole wheel was easily cast in one piece, and capable of being forced securely upon the axle at a pressure of 40 tons. In 1850, he patented the tapered and ribbed corrugated wheel.|$|E
5000|$|With some funds he {{had managed}} to save, Ludvig opened a new firm, the Machine-Building Factory Ludvig Nobel. Initially {{producing}} <b>chilled</b> <b>cast-iron</b> shells, the factory became in a few years one of the largest producers of gun carriages of Russia.While running the factory in St. Petersburg, Ludwig obtained a large contract to manufacture rifles for the Russian government and he needed wood for the rifle stocks. He sent his oldest brother, Robert Nobel in 1873 to procure Russian walnut wood in the Caucasus region of southern Russia. Without consulting his brother, Robert spent the 25,000 rubbles that Ludwig entrusted to him for buying wood - [...] "walnut money" [...] - and instead bought a small refinery in Baku. Ludwig sent additional funds to Robert to invest in modernisation and refinery efficiency. By 1876, the Nobel brothers established themselves as the most competent refiner in Baku and sent the first shipment of illuminating oil to St. Petersburg. [...] By 1879, Ludvig turned the initial business into a shareholding company, Branobel, of which he was the major shareholder and had as partners his brothers Robert and Alfred Nobel.|$|E
50|$|Alger also devised {{numerous}} {{improvements in}} the construction of time fuses for bomb shells and grenades. In 1811 he patented a method of making <b>cast-iron</b> <b>chilled</b> rolls, and in 1822 first designed cylinder stoves. Alger served {{as a member of the}} city council during the first year of its existence, and was elected alderman in 1824 and 1827.|$|R
5000|$|The firm of Ransomes was {{established}} in the last century by Mr. Robert Ransome, the grandfather of the subject of this notice. It was Robert Ransome who took out the first patent for manufacturing <b>cast-iron</b> <b>chilled</b> ploughshares, and thus by making the under-side much harder than the upper, preserving a sharp cutting edge to the share. The use of this process in turning out ploughshares is now almost universal, both in this country and America. The chief business of the establishment is still the manufacture of agricultural implements and machinery; although the firm is also extensively recognised in conjunction with railway works and improvements. Upwards of three thousand miles of [...] " [...] line" [...] in the United Kingdom, and nearly two thousand more {{in other parts of the}} world, are now laid down and maintained on the patent known as Ransome and May's.|$|R
40|$|Sand-cast {{plates of}} a {{commercial}} AZ 91 C alloy {{have been used for}} the study. Varying the solidification rate by placing large <b>cast-iron</b> <b>chills</b> in the mould produced a range of secondary dendrite arm spacing (SDAS) within the cast plates. The plates were solution heat-treated. quenched and aged at 165 degreesC for up to 350 h. The SDAS (mum) varied with the solidification time, t(f) (s), as SDAS = 5. 3 t(f) (0. 43). The tensile ductility in the as-quenched (T 4) condition did not depend on the solidification rate whilst in the T 6 condition it tended to decrease for slowly solidified material (SDAS > 50 mum). The yield strength and hardness increased and the ductility decreased with ageing. The fracture mode changed from predominantly transgranular in the T 4 condition to predominantly intergranular in the T 6 condition. The properties of the sand-castings are compared with those of high-pressure diecastings and the possible strengthening mechanisms are discussed. A number of areas that require more research are pointed out. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
