5|$|A {{long line}} of subwoofers placed {{horizontally}} along {{the front edge of}} the stage can be delayed such that the center subs fire several milliseconds prior to the ones flanking them, which fire several milliseconds prior to their neighbors, <b>continuing</b> <b>in</b> this fashion until the last subwoofers are reached at the outside ends of the subwoofer row (beamforming). This method helps to counteract the extreme narrowing of horizontal dispersion pattern seen with a horizontal subwoofer array. Such delay shading can be used to virtually reshape a loudspeaker array.|$|E

5|$|Gibbs, now 18, {{returned}} to the reserves {{for much of the}} following season. Watford's first-team struggled, failing to win any of their first nine league games. Although his first start of the season ended in an 2–0 defeat to Queens Park Rangers, Gibbs retained his place for 10 of the remaining 11 matches, experiencing only one further defeat. <b>Continuing</b> <b>in</b> this vein, 1985–86 saw Gibbs establish himself as the team's first choice right-back. He missed only two games all season, both of which resulted in defeat for Watford. His first goal came on 5 April 1986 in a 4–1 home victory over Newcastle United, while he also played in a 5–1 win over Chelsea at Stamford Bridge {{on the final day of}} the season.

Goronwy led Llywelyn's military forces, and in February 1263 he took them as far south as Gwent in action against the Marcher Lords. Tudur ap Goronwy was one of three sons of Goronwy ab Ednyfed, alongside Goronwy ap Goronwy (also known as Goronwy the Younger or Goronwy Fychan) and Hywel ap Goronwy. Tudur Hen was not the first member of the family to be named Tudur: he was preceded by his uncle, Tudur ab Ednyfed, {{who had been in the}} service of the previous Prince of Wales, Dafydd ap Llywelyn.|$|E
