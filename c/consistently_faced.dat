40|$|Within {{the past}} few years, a number of {{important}} cases have been decided by federal courts involving difficult points of evidence law, suggesting a trend toward liberality in admission of evidence. On the face of the opinions many of these decisions are influenced by the clear direction of the Federal Rules of Procedure, both civil and criminal.

The trend for liberality by the courts may be influenced by the feeling that juries are better educated today than they were 100 years ago when many of the evidence rules were being evolved, and that lawyers are better prepared to use the adversary system of litigation.

40|$|AbstractConventional {{approaches}} for therapeutic targeting of viral pathogens have <b>consistently</b> <b>faced</b> obstacles {{arising from the}} development of resistant strains {{and a lack of}} broad-spectrum application. Influenza represents a particularly problematic therapeutic challenge since high viral mutation rates have often confounded many conventional antivirals. Newly emerging or engineered strains of influenza represent an even greater threat as typified by recent interest in avian subtypes of influenza. Based on the limitations associated with targeting virally-encoded molecules, we have taken an orthogonal approach of targeting host pathways in a manner that prevents viral propagation or spares the host from virus-mediated pathogenicity. To this end, we report herein the application of an improved technology for target discovery, Random Homozygous Gene Perturbation (RHGP), to identify host-oriented targets that are well-tolerated in normal cells but that prevent influenza-mediated killing of host cells. Improvements in RHGP facilitated a thorough screening of the entire genome, both for overexpression or loss of expression, to identify targets that render host cells resistant to influenza infection. We identify a set of host-oriented targets that prevent influenza killing of host cells and validate these targets using multiple approaches. These studies provide further support for a new paradigm to combat viral disease and demonstrate the power of RHGP to identify novel targets and mechanisms...|$|E
40|$|This thesis aims {{to provide}} an {{examination}} of the police experience of mental illness. The thesis highlights several of the dilemmas of the police, the perception of their roles and the methods used by the officers to deal with the mentally ill in the community. The police have <b>consistently</b> <b>faced</b> social problems in the community, including mental illness. There have been many changes and reforms of mental health policy over the past twenty years. This includes the introduction of community care policy. It has been acknowledged that these changes have impacted on the police and numbers of mentally ill being dealt with by the police. This thesis involves an examination of previous research into the police and the mentally ill, the policy and social context of this involvement, including an examination ofpeliinent mental health policy, and the practice of the police when facing a complex social problem. Operational officers from two police stations were interviewed to gain insight into their perceptions of the mentally ill. Senior, managerial officers also participated {{to provide an}} overview of the policies of several forces. Various issues were raised concerning the involvement of the police with the mentally ill. These included the dilemma of dealing with a vulnerable group in a climate where risk is at the forefront. The police adopt various methods for managing the mentally ill. The overwhelming approach, however, continued to involve the use of police discretion. The pragmatic use of discretion appeared to be the most useful mechanism, regardless of the policy and procedure of their specific forces...|$|E

5000|$|It may be {{that the}} use of {{distinct}} brain regions for processing different object categories results from different processing requirements necessary for each class. Indeed, Malach et al. (2002) [...] detail findings that buildings and faces require processing at different resolutions in order to be recognised - face recognition requires the analysis of fine detail, while buildings can be recognised using larger scale feature integration. As a result, faces are associated with central visual field processing while buildings are processed more peripherally. Malach et al. (2002) report that points on the retina sharing foveal centricity are mapped onto parallel cortical bands and it therefore follows that object classes that are processed differently by retinal cells should be represented distinctly within the brain. <b>Consistently,</b> <b>faces</b> and buildings were found to be processed independently of each other and in discrete cortical regions suggesting that processing is facilitated by assigning object categories to distinct cortical regions according to the level and type of processing that they require.|$|R

40|$|Since the {{dissolution}} of apartheid, corporate governance in South Africa has evolved from being a soft mainly ethical issue to a hard knowledge-based technological issue, recognised as pivotal to the success and revitalisation of the country’s capital markets and, ultimately, the prospects of the corporate economy. These high stakes have produced a succession of measures aimed at transforming corporate governance in the economy. As such, South Africa’s corporate managers are <b>consistently</b> <b>faced</b> with the seemingly unassailable obstacle of discerning and implementing technologically progressive and culturally/racially unbiased management strategies/systems. The focus of this thesis is the latter of these two obstacles. Ubuntu acts as the scope via which the issues embedded within the incumbent management strategies/systems are viewed. Ubuntu philosophy embodies a socio-cultural framework that applies to all individuals and institutions throughout the continent. It embodies collectivism and teamwork, creation of synergies and competitive advantages, humanist leadership styles and maturity, consensus in decision-making systems, effective communication, and community-based corporate social responsibility. Ubuntu is pervasive in almost all parts of Southern African continent – it is integrated into all aspects of day-to-day life throughout the region. This thesis reviews and analyses some of the lessons that can be learned through the inception of African management, more specifically Ubuntu management, within South Africa’s corporate sphere. This thesis aims to prove that there exists {{a need for a}} new South African corporate management system, one which is able to harmoniously integrate the incumbent, western-orientated management strategies and systems with one of African origins...|$|E
40|$|The {{application}} of diffuse pollution models included in EUROHARP encompassed {{varying levels of}} parameterisation and approaches to the preparation of input data depending on the model and modelling team involved. Modellers <b>consistently</b> <b>faced</b> important decisions in relation to data interpretation, especially in those catchments with unfamiliar physical or climatic characteristics, where catchment conditions were beyond the range for which a particular model was originally developed, or where only limited input data were available. In addition to a broad discussion of data issues, this paper compares {{the performance of the}} four sub-annual output models tested in EUROHARP (EveNFlow, NL-CAT, SWAT and TRK) in three test catchments without the modelling teams having sight of measured flow and nitrate concentration data. Model performance in this ""blind test"" indicate that the range of predictions generated by any individual models pre and post calibration exceed the differences between the estimates yielded by all four models. Comparison of Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) statistics for simulated and observed flow, concentration and loads underscores the benefits of calibration for these intermediate and complex model formulations. Interpretation of input data (e. g. rainfall interpolation method and pedotransfer functions selected) appeared equally (or more) important than process representation. In the absence of calibration data, modeller unfamiliarity with a particular catchment and its environmental processes sometimes resulted in questionable assumptions and input errors which highlight the problems facing modellers charged with implementing policies under the Water Framework Directive (2000 / 60 /EC) in poorly monitored catchments. Catchment data owners and modellers must therefore work more closely given that the output from diffuse pollution models is clearly modeller-limited as well as model-limited. © 2009 The Royal Society of Chemistry...|$|E
40|$|Problem statement: Real estate {{developers}} were <b>consistently</b> <b>faced</b> {{with the}} issue of making decisions on the types of property to invest their hard earned income or highly competitive secured mortgage funds, which were attached with high lending rates. One of the different sectors that are begging for such investment is residential property development. Approach: This study evaluated the effects of available infrastructure in residential property on its rental values in Akure, Ondo state, Nigeria. Two different sets of questionnaires were designed and administered for the collection of primary data used in the study. The first set of questionnaires was for the tenants of residential property while the second set of questionnaires was administered on the practicing estate surveyors based in Akure. The questions in the questionnaires amongst others probed into the types of available infrastructure in the rented apartment, rent paid, income of household-heads and family size. Primary data collected were subjected to multiple regression analysis and the determination of the effects of each of the available infrastructure (water, electricity, access road, kitchen, toilet, refuse disposal facility, wall fence, installed burglary proof, drainage channel, daywatch-security and nightwatch-security services) on the rental value was achieved. Results: The study revealed that infrastructural facilities contributed 30. 50 % in the determination of rental values of residential buildings in Akure; of which the provision of wall-fence round the building and the installation of burglary proof in all the windows played the most important infrastructure. Conclusion: Property developers that want to invest in residential buildings development should endeavour to provide these two infrastructure amongst others with a view to earn attractive rental values on their residential property in Akure in particular and towns and cities in developing countries...|$|E

40|$|The {{management}} of multinational operations is often required to balance conflicting priorities between responsiveness {{at the national}} subsidiary level and central coordination for global competitiveness. Such balancing requires that relevant data {{be brought to bear}} on decisions, that consensus be created among key managers, and that relative power among them be carefully balanced. In large complex MNCs the balancing process can be institutionalized through the structuring of relationship between headquarters and subsidiaries. Beyond formal organization reporting lines, relationships between headquarters and subsidiaries can be structured using a wide array of management tools. Consistent and inconsistent patterns in the use of these tools are identified and assessed, based on detailed analysis of management tools in a selected group of multinational companies. Findings suggest that selected tools must be used to manage data, to manage managers, and to manage conflicts; and that the successful companies blend an array of tools into a consistent management process. Companies with too narrow or too wide a repertory of tools and companies that fail to blend tools <b>consistently</b> <b>face</b> difficulties in trading off needs for responsiveness and needs for coordination. © 1984 JIBS.
