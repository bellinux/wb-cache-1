40|$|Childhood chronic {{pancreatitis}} {{is a rare}} disorder, {{which can}} lead to a <b>chronically</b> <b>debilitating</b> <b>condition.</b> The etiology of recurrent hereditary pancreatitis, which previously was classified as idiopathic, has now been attributed in certain cases to specific genetic mutations including abnormalities in the PRSS gene. We describe here the use of total pancreatectomy and autoislet transplant in a 5 -year-old with chronic pancreatitis. This represents the youngest patient undergoing the procedure at our institution.

30|$|To scientists, doctors, journalists, {{policy makers}} and the public alike it appears self-evident that a primary driver behind the {{development}} of the above three stem cell treatments was a desire to treat patients with fatal or <b>chronically</b> <b>debilitating</b> <b>conditions.</b> However, it has to be recognized that their refinement into effective clinical therapies, through dramatic improvements in efficacy and reduced treatment invasiveness, arose {{as a direct result of}} extensive basic research. This research, and its wide and transparent dissemination, created testable hypotheses that were assessed in controlled clinical settings. For example, the successful application of HSC for lymphopenia, leukemias and lymphomas only became possible after extensive research provided a detailed molecular understanding of GVHD[3, 4]. For skin and corneal grafts, targeted research into the identification, harvesting, expansion and transplantation of appropriate stem/progenitor cells was needed before the treatment of patients could be attempted[11, 14]. Clearly, successful development of these clinical therapies hinged on continuous evidence-based research to improve treatment efficacy and safety, and to reduce patient discomfort.|$|R
40|$|According to the Regulation (EC) N. 141 / 2000 of the European Parliament {{and of the}} Council, rare {{diseases}} are life-threatening or <b>chronically</b> <b>debilitating</b> <b>conditions,</b> affecting no more than 5 in 10 000 persons in the European Community. It is estimated that between 6000 to 8000 distinct {{rare diseases}} affect up to 6 % of the total EU population. Therefore, these conditions can be considered rare if taken individually but they affect {{a significant proportion of}} the European population when considered as a single group. Several initiatives have been undertaken at international, European and national level to tackle public health as well as research issues related to the prevention, diagnosis, treatment and surveillance of these diseases. The development of innovative and effective medical products for their diagnosis and treatment is frequently hampered by several factors, including the limited knowledge of their natural history, the difficulties in setting up clinical studies due to the limited numbers of patients affected by a specific disease, the weak interest of sponsors due to the restricted market opportunities. Therefore, incentives and other facilitations have been adopted {{in many parts of the}} world, including in the EU, in order to facilitate the development and commercialization of diagnostic tools and treatments devoted to rare diseases. This paper illustrates mainly the European initiatives and will discuss the problematic and controversial aspects surrounding orphan drugs. Finally, activities and measures adopted in Italy are presented...|$|R
