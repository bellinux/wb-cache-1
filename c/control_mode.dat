Of particular interest were <b>control</b> <b>modes</b> that provide force reflection to the operator. The task selected for the experiment is {{a portion of the}} Solar Maximum Satellite Repair procedure we developed to demonstrate the repair of the Solar Maximum Satellite with teleoperators. The seven manual <b>control</b> <b>modes</b> evaluated in the experiment are combinations of manual position or resolved motion rate control with alternative control schemes for force reflection and remote manipulator compliance. Performance measures used were task completion times, average force and torque exerted during the execution of the task, and cumulative force and torque exerted. The results were statistically analyzed and they show that, in general, force reflection significantly improves operator performance and indicate that a specific force-reflecting scheme may yield the best performance among the <b>control</b> <b>modes</b> we tested. Also, our experiment showed that, for the selected task, the position <b>control</b> <b>modes</b> were preferable to the rate <b>control</b> <b>modes</b> and slave manipulator compliance reduced task interaction forces and torques...|$|R

This paper examines decision makers' {{selection of}} contextual <b>control</b> <b>modes</b> {{as described by}} Hollnagel's Contextual Control Model, and evaluates real-time, unobtrusive measures of a decision maker's immediate mode. In a two-part experiment, participants performed airline rescheduling tasks. The first portion varied task time limits, the second introduced a sudden change in the task. Participants reported operating in, and transitioning between, different contextual <b>control</b> <b>modes</b> in response to time limits and task changes. Computer interaction did not correlate to contextual <b>control</b> <b>modes.</b> Contextual <b>control</b> <b>modes</b> did not correlate with TLX ratings of demand and effort, but did correlate with TLX-frustration and TLX-performance ratings. The results suggest that decision making performance may be determined by use of context-appropriate contextual <b>control</b> <b>modes,</b> and imply that the design of decision aids should work to support those modes...|$|R

40|$|Designers work in groups. They need {{to share}} {{information}} either synchronously or asynchronously as they work with parametric modelling software, as with all computer-aided design tools. Receiving information from collaborators while working may intrude on their work and thought processes. Little research exists on how the reception of design updates influences designers in their work. Nor do we know much about designer preferences for collaboration. In this paper, we examine how sharing and receiving design updates affects designersi performances and preferences. We present a system prototype to share changes on demand or in continuous mode while performing design tasks. A pilot study measuring the preferences of nine pairs of designers for different combinations of <b>control</b> <b>modes</b> and design tasks shows {{statistically significant differences between}} the task types and <b>control</b> <b>modes.</b> The types of tasks affect the preferences of users to the types of <b>control</b> <b>modes.</b> In an apparent contradiction, user preference of <b>control</b> <b>modes</b> contradicts task performance time. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{successful}} {{application of}} the unified power flow controller (UPFC) provides a new control method for the secure and economic operation of power system. In {{order to make the}} full use of UPFC and improve the economic efficiency and static security of a power system, a preventive security-constrained power flow optimization method considering UPFC <b>control</b> <b>modes</b> is proposed in this paper. Firstly, an iterative method considering UPFC <b>control</b> <b>modes</b> is deduced for power flow calculation. Taking into account the influence of different UPFC <b>control</b> <b>modes</b> on the distribution of power flow after N- 1 contingency, the optimization model is then constructed by setting a minimal system operation cost and a maximum static security margin as the objective. Based on this model, the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm is utilized to optimize power system operating parameters and UPFC <b>control</b> <b>modes</b> simultaneously. Finally, a standard IEEE 30 -bus system is utilized to demonstrate that the proposed method fully exploits the potential of static control of UPFC and significantly increases the economic efficiency and static security of the power system...|$|R

This transition between abstraction levels inevitably results in a specification-to-execution gap, and we discuss two sources for this gap; namely model based and constraint based. For both of {{these two types of}} sources, we show how hybrid control techniques provide the tools needed to compile high-level control programs {{in such a way that}} the specification-to-execution gap is removed. The solutions involve introducing new <b>control</b> <b>modes</b> into nominal strings of <b>control</b> <b>modes</b> as well as adjusting the <b>control</b> <b>modes</b> themselves...|$|R

Prior studies typically investigate {{one of these}} two forms of control relationships in isolation. Hence, {{little is known about the}} differences between hierarchical and market-based control relationships.

Specifically, we conduct a metaanalysis to compare the effects of <b>control</b> <b>modes</b> on IS project performance reported in research on hierarchical and market-based control relationships. The results suggest that the effects of behavior and self-control on performance differ between these two forms of control relationships.
