The North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) has reduced barriers and tariffs, facilitating cross-border trade. Each day 2008, $2 billion of cross-border trade was conducted between Canada and the United States alone. Consumers {{take part in}} cross-border trading to broaden their product selection, gain access to a larger market place, or take advantage of currency volatility. Online commerce {{has taken on a}} more prominent role in recent years and gives consumers a convenient platform for <b>cross-border</b> <b>shopping.</b> However, additional border costs such as duties, brokerage and shipping are not always disclosed up front or even known to the retailer, leading to a situation where the final cost of an item can greatly exceed expectations. Dedicated <b>cross-border</b> <b>shopping</b> solutions such as Wishabi, and Canada Post’s Borderfree exist to mitigate these problems with varied success. In the end, caution is necessary to determine the final cost of goods before purchase.|$|E

Such findings came {{from a series of}} pre-studies including interviews with two agents in Sweden and two customers in China, non-participant observations of the two agents’ WeChat 1 accounts, and netnographical investigation of customer feedbacks on one agent's Taobao 2 online shop. They show the central role of the agent and the direct person-to-person interaction between agent and customers. Further, they uncover a favorable image of Sweden among Chinese consumers who shop Swedish products through Daigou. Based on the findings from the pre-studies and literature review, two models were developed which examine how satisfaction respectively repurchase intention are influenced in the context of Chinese <b>cross-border</b> online <b>shopping</b> through agent in Sweden. A web survey was carried out in order to test the two models. Results show that although trust in the agent, country image and perceived social value were found to be all positively and significantly influencing both satisfaction and repurchase intention, their importance emerged to be different. For satisfaction, trust in the agent is the most important and country image the least important determinant; while for repurchase intention, country image was found {{to be the most important}} and trust in the agent the least important determinant. From a theoretical perspective, our research fills up the research gap of this ever-growing consumption behavior among Chinese consumers, which has not yet been paid attention to and develops the definition of retail agent. From a practical perspective, the results from the quantitative study could be useful for Swedish retailers/producers who seek to extend their customer base in China but doesn’t want to take risks and high investments of a traditional market entry.

40|$|Further {{growth of}} {{cross-border}} e-commerce in the European Union markets requires improved express delivery services. The framework {{presented in this}} paper identifies relevant contextual factors that affect express delivery adoption rates in European cross-border e-commerce. This framework leads to a set of hypotheses, both on the effects of express deliveries on financial performance indicators (order incidence, order size, and repurchase rate) and on the factors that drive demand for express deliveries (consumer income, logistic costs, and lead-time benefits). A case study provides empirical tests of the hypotheses, using data on about forty thousand sales transactions from a consumer electronics manufacturer’s <b>cross-border</b> online <b>shop.</b> The findings are that express delivery has positive effects on financial performance, as it leads to higher order incidence, larger order size, and higher repurchase rates in cross-border transactions. Demand for express delivery services increases with higher income, larger lead-time benefits, and lower logistic costs. Managers can employ the presented framework to formulate and analyse their own targets for performance and express delivery services...|$|R

40|$|<b>Cross-border</b> forum <b>shopping</b> for a {{different}} insolvency law regime has become popular within the European Union in recent years. Yet legislators, courts and legal scholarship react with suspicion when debtors cross the border only to benefit from {{a different}} insolvency law system. The most prominent legal tool, the European Insolvency Regulation, {{is based on the}} assumption that forum shopping has a negative impact on the functioning of the European Internal Market. This paper questions the hostile attitude towards the phenomenon of forum shopping. It is argued that forum shopping can have beneficial effects both for the company and for its creditors, and that strong safeguards for creditors who oppose the migration are in place. Furthermore, the validity of the COMI approach of the Regulation under the fundamental freedoms of the Treaty is questioned; it is suggested that the current regime needs to be amended.

Government as an important participator has greatly promoted the healthy and rapid development of this business model. As a vital topic {{in all kinds of}} businesses, customer trust is also a core research topic in online shopping. Many scholars have studied customer trust in traditional online shopping while few of them focused on <b>cross-border</b> online <b>shopping,</b> let alone the CICBEC business model.

This research aims to address existing research gap by contributing to Lee and Turban (2001) ’s Customer Trust in Internet Shopping (CTIS) Model and constructing a new customer trust model. A number of influencing factors of customer trust were defined and tested in this research. It shows that influencing factors from four participators, the e-retailers, e- commerce platforms, government and third-parties, have a significant correlation with customer trust. The final results show that order fulfillment, government actions, e-retailer reputation, information quality, e-commerce platform security and e-commerce platform reputation have significant influences on customer trust. ...|$|R
40|$|Purpose – This {{viewpoint}} {{seeks to}} review the changing environment of shopping spaces in Europe, specifically evaluating factors underpinning development trends. The paper provides a critical overview, staking stock of recent debates {{in the area of}} European shopping place development and international retailing. It provides a discussion of themes emerging from the views of expert research‐orientated stakeholders. Design/methodology/approach – Themes were drawn from a survey of a group of 11 expert research‐orientated European shopping centre stakeholders. Findings – Key suggestions centre around issues associated with: people and lifestyle; planning and economics; environment and design, and globalisation. Two seemingly dichotomous trends are discussed; the increasing <b>cross‐border</b> transfer of <b>shopping</b> place forms, and the increasing need for shopping space individualism, identity, integrity and sensitivity to locality. Research limitations/implications – Whilst the authors' recognise that a limited number of experts were consulted the data reveals an important insight into the views of practitioners well‐placed to foresee the future. Further investigations can be envisaged which consult a wider range of views.

40|$|The partial {{revenue from}} each {{indirect}} tax {{and the total}} revenue from all indirect taxes on consumer goods are derived as functions of all commodity prices, the tax rates of each commodity, total expenditure and demographic variables using a complete demand system. Within this framework we define Dupuit curves, or Laffer curves, and analyze their existence and maximum points theoretically and empirically. The macro demand system is based on exact aggregation across all households in the economy, and on exact aggregation across commodities within a detailed non-homogeneous utility tree. An empirical application for Norway with 55 commodity groups is presented. For beer, wine, spirits and tobacco, consumers can choose among buying at home, <b>cross-border</b> shopping/ tax-free <b>shopping</b> and smuggling. These substitution possibilities increase substantially the price elasticities for these goods. The partial revenue from wine as function of the tax share on wine has a single maximum value close to the actual tax rate in Norway in 1999, conditioned on all the other exogenous variables. The total revenue {{as a function of}} the tax share on wine also has a single maximum value, larger than that for the partial revenue. The same results are valid for spirits.

40|$|The {{present state}} of world economy urges {{managers}} to look for new methods, which can help to start the economic growth. To achieve this goal, managers use standard {{as well as new}} procedures. The fundamental prerequisite of the efficient decision-making processes are actual and right information. Managers need to monitor past information and current actual information to generate trends of future development based on it. Managers always should define strictly what do they want to know, how do they want to see it and for what purpose do they want to use it. Only in this case they can get right information applicable to efficient decision-making. Generally, managers´ decisions should lead to make the customers´ decision-making process easier. More frequently than ever, companies use e-commerce systems for the support of their business activities. In connection with the present state and future development, <b>cross-border</b> online <b>shopping</b> growth can be expected. To support this, companies will need much better systems providing the managers adequate and sufficient information. This type of information, which is usually multidimensional, can be provided by the Business Intelligence (BI) technologies. Besides special BI systems, some of BI technologies are obtained in quite a few of ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) systems. One of the crucial questions is whether should companies and firms buy or develop special BI software, or whether they can use BI tools contained in some ERP systems. In respect of this, there is a question if the modern ERP systems can provide the managers sufficient possibilities relating to ad-hoc reporting, static and dynamic reports and OLAP analyses. A one of the main goals {{of this article is to}} show and verify Business Intelligence tools of Microsoft Dynamics NAV for the support of decision-making in terms of the cross-border online purchasing.

40|$|The European Patent Convention (EPC) {{provides}} for a common application and examination procedure for European patents. Therefore, European patents are granted {{on the basis of}} uniform European law which is applied and interpreted by the EPO, as well as by a great number of national judges and members of other authorities who are bound by national case law. The fact that the EPC and corresponding national patent law is "uniform law" requires that it is construed in an international spirit based on its ratio and with a view to create cross-border legal uniformity. This is not least underscored {{by the fact that the}} extent of protection conferred by a European patent should be determined according to Article 69 EPC and the Protocol on the Interpretation of Article 69 EPC and that a large part of national patent laws of EPC Contracting states have been unified with the Strasbourg Convention on the Unification of Certain Points of Substantive Law on Patents for Invention and the 1975 Community Patent Convention - as agreed in a resolution on the adjustment of national patent law - in order to achieve legal uniformity. However, diverging decisions with regard to the corresponding parts of a European patent remain an issue to date. Furthermore, under current law the patent holder must initiate several parallel infringement actions, based on the same European patent and directed against the same alleged infringer before the national courts in the states where the infringing acts have taken place. This situation gives rise to many difficulties for the parties and has several undesirable effects which weaken the patent system in Europe. The PhD thesis deals with different legal measures which would promote the uniform interpretation of European patent law and which would help to ease the difficulties related to multiple litigation. This includes in particular, - the creation of specialised courts at national level and the influence of <b>cross-border</b> forum <b>shopping</b> in this regard, including the problems and possible solutions related to forum shopping, - the judicial cooperation among judges, including the exchange of judges and scientific support from scholars and practitioners, - the establishment of an international referral body, - Alternative Dispute Resolution (Arbitration, Mediation, and other instruments), - harmonisation of the court proceedings and the substantive patent law, - cross-border injunctions, or - the establishment of a common court of appeal. The author concludes that specialisation at the level of first instance courts in combination with several other of the above mentioned measures could ensure a uniform interpretation of European patent law. Finally, the author outlines past and current attempts for the establishment of a common patent court in Europe with a clear focus on the proposed court architecture and the elaboration of specific conditions regarding the organisation of the court in order to safeguard a uniform interpretation of European patent law and to avoid multiple litigation.

[...] It was also aimed to influence energy policy discussion as the First Ministers met at Niagara-on-the-Lake, Ontario. Critics of the report debated its findings in media. Jock Finlayson of the BC Business Council {{pointed out that the}} drop in fuel consumption might be due to <b>cross-border</b> <b>shopping,</b> as many BC residents are able to drive into Washington or Alberta to fuel their cars and trucks, as well as to a much larger gasoline levy implemented Greater Vancouver (accounting for much of BC's population) to fund public transit development (TransLink), and that businesses were receiving less tax advantages from the plan than individuals. [...] Aldyen Donnelly of WDA Consulting suggested that the success of the tax in reducing fuel consumption would cannibalize the potential revenue it could generate, creating a tax waste, and that it fell more on the middle and lower-middle classes than on the rich, making it a regressive tax. [...] Supporter Mark Jaccard of Simon Fraser University, defended the tax by saying that BC’s aviation fuel usage, which is not subject to the carbon tax, [...] "did not diverge from the Canadian pattern, supporting the argument that the carbon tax really did have an effect. And BC’s disconnect {{from the rest of the}} country was evident for all taxed fuels, not just gasoline; so the argument that BC’s divergence is caused by increased <b>cross-border</b> <b>shopping</b> for gasoline is not supported."
