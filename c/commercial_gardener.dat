50|$|The {{plant was}} {{introduced}} to Europe by the German gardener Mühlendorff in 1892, who discovered it near Amasya. It is named after Carl Sprenger, a <b>commercial</b> <b>gardener,</b> who also published {{a description of the}} plant. The first scientific description was produced by J. Gilbert Baker in 1894 in the Gardener's Chronicle. Mühlendorff sent bulbs to the nursery of Damman&Cie near Naples in Italy, which then supplied numerous bulbs to European gardeners between 1895 and 1898. The Armenian teacher J. J. Manissadijan from Merzifon supplied bulbs to the Dutch company Van Tubergen and John Hoog. He also sold other rare plants, like Iris gatesi to Dutch commercial gardeners. Obviously, too many bulbs were taken from the wild, and the plant became extinct. Later, he had to flee the country. The Englishman Edward Whittall from Izmir seems to have supplied Damman & Sprenger as well. No wild plants have been recorded since the First World War.|$|E

50|$|A nursery is a {{place where}} plants are {{propagated}} and grown to usable size. They include retail nurseries which sell to the general public, wholesale nurseries which sell only to businesses such as other nurseries and to <b>commercial</b> <b>gardeners,</b> and private nurseries which supply the needs of institutions or private estates.

Seaweed production averages 3,821.5 tonnes per annum, while catches of shrimp, crabs, and milkfish average 4,318 tonnes, 2,061 tonnes, and 4.964 tonnes per annum each. Catches of other fish, mainly tuna, average 73,763.5 tonnes per annum.|$|R
50|$|His {{mother was}} German, his father Armenian. He went to Germany {{in order to}} study natural history at the Humboldt University at Berlin. In 1890, he became Professor of Botany at the American Anatolia College in Marsovan (also spelled Mersiwan) in Paphlagonia in Northeastern Anatolia, where he also founded a museum. Manissadijan {{collected}} plants in the Black Sea region of the Ottoman Empire. He discovered several new species of bulbous plants that were published by the Austrian Botanist Josef Franz Freyn. He also collected butterflies and other insects. He also supplied <b>commercial</b> <b>gardeners</b> in the Netherland, foremost van Tubergen, with plant material from the Pontus region. Among those were bulbs of the now locally extinct Sprenger's tulip from the Amasya region.|$|R

50|$|Climate-friendly gardeners {{therefore}} grow {{at least}} some of their food, and may choose food crops which therefore help to keep carbon in farmland soils if they grow such high-risk crops in small vegetable plots in their gardens, where it is easier to protect the soil than in large fields under <b>commercial</b> pressures. Climate-friendly <b>gardeners</b> may grow and eat plants such as sweet cicely which sweeten food, and so reduce the land area needed for sugar-beet. They may also choose to grow perennial food plants to not only reduce their indirect greenhouse gas emissions from farmland, but also to increase carbon stores in their own gardens.|$|R
40|$|The bright red, geraniums that {{trail from}} the {{balconies}} of Swiss chalets and clamber up palm trees in California aren’t botanically speaking, geraniums at all, {{nor are they}} Swiss or Californian; in fact they are pelargoniums. They were first brought to Europe – and misidentified – after 1652, when the VOC (the Dutch East India Company) established a permanent settlement and a Company Garden at the Cape and started to explore the surrounding area to bring back new botanical treasures, which apart from pelargoniums included proteas, ericas and many other mainstays of European gardens. By the time the confusion between the two species was resolved, ‘African geraniums’ had been around for 150 years and British <b>commercial</b> growers and <b>gardeners</b> were reluctant {{to give up the}} familiar name...|$|R
40|$|In {{the latter}} half of the 17 th century, floricultures as well as garden plants prospered in Edo as the {{pleasure}} of urban common people. Especially, one of the largest and most remarkable horticulture centers in the world was formed around Sugamo, Komagome and Somei villages in the northern periphery of Edo. Although the origin of the center’s formation was based on the gardening of daimyos and noble families, a prominent group of <b>commercial</b> farmers and <b>gardeners</b> became floriculture specialists for Edo’s ordinary residents. Various kinds of horticulture were developed such as garden plants, bonsai（ dwarf potted tree） and cultivation of morning glory and chrysanthemum. The origin of chrysanthemum species is assumed to be in China, however, the significant varieties have been developed in Japan, and a kind of chrysanthemum culture flourished throughout the Edo period. Additionally, a series of cultivation technology, including empirical scientific observations and chrysanthemum works and figure making were developed by the above mentioned entreprenant gardeners. Many practical guidebooks and manuals on floriculture, including Kadan-Chikinsho （花壇地錦抄），were published from the end of 17 th to 19 th century for many varieties of chrysanthemum. The objective of this paper is to analyze the diffusing process of chrysanthemum cultivation and people’s entertainment, and the spatial differentiation, from the viewpoint of urban expansion process of Edo （renamed Tokyo after 1867 ） as well as farmer’s commercial behavior, by reinterpreting historical documents and old local area maps. After Japan opened its country in 1858, some European “plant hunters” accompanied by official personnel started collecting plant seeds, nurseries of rare and beautiful flowers or trees such as azalea in Japan. Their aim was to bring them back to their sponsor’s countries safely to transplant. Their method of collecting growing plants was to buy them from gardeners or farmers around Edo/Tokyo or Yokohama, where a foreign settlement was located, rather than to explore wild species by themselves. The main reason of this was that all foreigners were strictly restricted to travel around in Japan. Robert Fortune （ 1812 - 1880 ）, a renowned English plant hunter who had mainly travelled inland China in search for useful plants like tea or rare and beautiful flowers which fit in cool climate of the UK, was a good example. The author also focuses on the network among plant hunters, gardeners and suburban farmers around Tokyo...|$|R
