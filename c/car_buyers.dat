25|$|The {{oil crisis}} pushed West European <b>car</b> <b>buyers</b> away from larger, less {{economical}} cars. The most notable {{result of this}} transition was the rise in popularity of compact hatchbacks. The only notable small hatchbacks built in Western Europe before the oil crisis were the Peugeot104, Renault5 and Fiat127. By {{the end of the}} decade, the market had expanded with the introduction of the Ford Fiesta, Opel Kadett (sold as the Vauxhall Astra in Great Britain), Chrysler Sunbeam and Citroën Visa.|$|E
25|$|Sir Bernard Docker {{took the}} extra {{responsibility}} of Daimler's managing director in January 1953 when James Leek {{was unable to}} continue through illness. <b>Car</b> <b>buyers</b> were {{still waiting for the}} new (Churchill) government's easing of the 'temporary' swingeing purchase tax promised in the lead up to the snap-election held during the 1951 Earl's Court motor show. Lady Docker told her husband to rethink his marketing policies. 3-litre Regency production was stopped. In the hope of keeping 4,000+ employed the Consort price was dropped from 4 February 1953 to the expected new tax-inclusive level.|$|E

The Estate had the same top-hinged rear opening, but featured a more comfortable, while still folding, rear seat. There was also a folding luggage shelf in the trunk. Sops to safety, already somewhat better than the regular Fronte because of the engine location and the driver's seat being located farther back, included an anti-glare dashboard and a round horn pad in the steering wheel.|$|E

25|$|It was {{determined}} that Ford's strategy to redesignate new cars in the lineup with new names beginning with the letter F, as in Ford Focus, Ford Fusion, and Ford Freestyle, {{was not a good}} marketing move, as some of the renamed cars had highly recognizable iconic names. <b>Car</b> <b>buyers</b> in the U.S. did not associate the new F names with Ford, and were confused by the name changes. Mulally believed that the Taurus had an immediately strong brand equity, and that it would take years for consumers to have a similar recognition of the Five Hundred.|$|E
25|$|As Singapore is a {{small island}} with a high {{population}} density, the number of private {{cars on the road}} is restricted so as to curb pollution and congestion. <b>Car</b> <b>buyers</b> must pay for duties one-and-a-half times the vehicle's market value, and bid for a Singaporean Certificate of Entitlement (COE), which allows the car to run on the road for a decade. The cost of the Singaporean certificate of entitlement alone would buy a Porsche Boxster in the United States. Car prices are generally significantly higher in Singapore than in other English-speaking countries. As with most Commonwealth countries, vehicles on the road and people walking on the streets keep to the left.|$|E
25|$|With its {{aluminum}} {{body and}} frame, the Insight was an expensive car {{to produce and}} was never designed for high-volume sales.

With an aerodynamic fuel-saving shape similar to the Audi A2, and some unconventional body colors it was a bit more than mainstream <b>car</b> <b>buyers</b> could handle, preferring more conservative styles. Production halted announced in May 2006, with plans announced to replace Insight with a new hybrid car, smaller than the eighth generation Civic, but not earlier than in 2009. Ahead of this announcement, Honda stopped selling Insight in the UK, for example, as early as December 2005.|$|E

2500|$|New <b>car</b> <b>buyers</b> are {{required}} to buy a Certificate of Entitlement (COE), which is valid for ten years. The typical car lifespan is 10 years.

The term [...] "bidding" [...] is often used, but in practice new car dealers assist in the process. The fee of each COE is added on to the costs of a new car based on engine size—Category A is 1,600 cc engine and below; Category B is 1,601 cc engine and above—and is generally lower for Category A vehicles. There are provisions for a rebate of the COE if the car is scrapped before 10 years.|$|E

2500|$|Ford {{revolutionized}} {{labor relations}} with his high wage policy that {{brought in the}} best workers in Detroit, and made [...] "Fordism" [...] world-famous. He began with a $5 a day minimum wage in 1910, about double the going rate at rival firms. It succeeded in stopping the massive turnover rate, raised productivity, lowered overall labor costs and helped to propel the Model T to industry dominance. [...] By the 1920s, however, Ford's formula of cheap cars with few options fell behind General Motors, which emphasized upscale quality and variety, and provided financing for <b>car</b> <b>buyers.</b>|$|E

The application is developed to cater needs of a potential <b>car</b> <b>buyer.</b> The buyer or the user of this application is able to get useful information regarding the car they intend to buy. The users of this application can gather valuable information based on the analysis of the cars and the manufacturers, and the car sales over the years to make an inference and thereby able to make the right decision while buying a car. It also focuses on the predictive analysis of the car sales with respect to the analysis of the sales over the past years in Ireland. This aspect will cater the needs of a businessman who intends to become a car dealer in making the right choice with the respect to the area and the make of cars that he intends to take the dealership...|$|R
50|$|The {{most obvious}} {{effect of the}} plan for the Australian <b>car</b> <b>buyer</b> was the {{appearance}} of badge engineered vehicles, where the same basic vehicle was sold by several companies under different names.

However, the smaller Plymouth provided greater owner approval in their actual use. A Plymouth Belvedere with six-cylinder engine and automatic transmission was compared to the intermediate-size Ford Fairlane and the compact-size Chevrolet Chevy II in an economy test by Popular Mechanics and the road test concluded that the Belvedere was [...] "a very pleasant transportation package." [...] Another advantage of the smaller and lighter body was in drag racing.|$|E

[...] It {{is important to}} note, however, early LSS models (1995) were rarely equipped with the 3800 Supercharged engine. [...] The LSS was an originally a trim level package on the 88 starting in 1992. In 1996 the LSS received Aurora-inspired seats. 1996 was the final year that the original-style rocket (in black and silver) appeared on a hood emblem. 1997 would welcome the new Oldsmobile logo on all Eighty-Eight trims except the Regency.|$|E

40|$|The Internet {{has led to}} the {{development}} of on-line markets, and computer scientists have designed various auction algorithms, as well as automated exchanges for standardized commodities; however, they have done little work on exchanges for complex nonstandard goods. We present an exchange system for trading complex goods, such as used cars or nonstandard financial securities. The system allows traders to represent their buy and sell orders by multiple attributes; for example, a <b>car</b> <b>buyer</b> can specify a model, options, color, and other desirable features. Traders can also provide complex price constraints, along with preferences among acceptable trades; for instance, a <b>car</b> <b>buyer</b> can specify dependency of an acceptable price on the model, year of production, and mileage. We describe the representation and indexing of orders, and give algorithms for fast identification of matches between buy and sell orders. The system identifies the most preferable matches, which maximize trader satisfaction; it allows control over the trade-off between speed and optimality of matching. It supports markets with up to 300, 000 orders, and processes hundreds of new orders per second. Keywords: E-commerce, exchange markets, indexing and retrieval, best-first search. ...|$|R
