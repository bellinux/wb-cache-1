50|$|The set {{of complex}} numbers with {{imaginary}} part strictly greater than zero {{and less than}} one, furnishes a nice example of an unbounded, connected, open subset of the plane whose complement is not connected. It is nevertheless simply-connected. It might also be worth pointing out that a relaxation of the requirement that X be connected leads to an interesting exploration of open subsets of the plane with <b>connected</b> <b>extended</b> complement. For example, a (not necessarily connected) open set has <b>connected</b> <b>extended</b> complement exactly when each of its connected components are simply-connected.|$|R
50|$|There {{are five}} Challenge levels: Basic <b>Challenge</b> (C1), <b>Extended</b> <b>Challenge</b> (C2), <b>Extended</b> <b>Challenge</b> (C3A), Challenge 3B (C3B) and Challenge 4 (C4). The first {{three of these}} are {{maintained}} and organized by Callerlab, while the last two exist on a more ad hoc basis, maintained by a small set of interested callers. As {{a result of this}} there are a few different C4 lists, mostly the same, but with various differences.|$|R

50|$|As of 2012, {{it seems}} that the local governments have shifted towards a more tram-friendly view: line 1 and 3 will be renovated and line 1 {{extended}} (mostly from EU funding); line 47 and 49 are planned to reach Nyugati tér once again {{as it used to be}} their final stop before M3 was opened. There is also a major project being planned to <b>connect,</b> <b>extend,</b> and develop the tram lines on the Buda side (providing longer lines and fewer transfers), which is held up by debate between the districts and the city.|$|R

In February 1964 she bought a second-hand Austin Traveller, but soon after traded it for a Mini van. Twelve-year-old Keith Bennett disappeared on 16 June 1964. His stepfather, Jimmy Johnson, became a suspect; in the two years following Bennett's disappearance, Johnson was taken for questioning on four occasions.

40|$|Wireless Mesh Networks (WMNs) are {{currently}} {{the subject of}} much research. WMNs are not Mobile Ad Hoc Networks (MANETs); instead they are a superset of MANETs. WMNs may exist {{in the absence of a}} central infrastructure taking the form of a MANET. However on the other hand, they may exist as networks comprised of an infrastructure <b>connecting</b> <b>extended</b> ad hoc networks. One significant area of research within ad hoc networks is routing and in particular, the securing thereof. Owing to the characteristics of WMNs however, routing algorithms designed for ad hoc networks however may not always be applicable to WMNs...|$|R

40|$|These days, {{the idea}} of the cyborg is less the stuff of science fiction and more a reality, as we are all, in one way or another, {{constantly}} <b>connected,</b> <b>extended,</b> wired, and dispersed in and through technology. One wonders where the individual, the person, the human, and the body are-or, alternatively, where they stop. These are the kinds of questions Hélène Mialet explores in this fascinating volume, as she focuses on a man who is permanently attached to assemblages of machines, devices, and collectivities of people: Stephen Hawking.

50|$|HP Virtual Connect brings {{virtualization}} to {{the blade}} server edge. It picks up where virtual machine technology stops. Virtual machine technology can only move workloads across virtual machines {{on a single}} server. It becomes a challenge when moving virtual machines from one physical machine to another or between data center locations, because changes to the LAN and SAN environments require manual intervention by network and storage administrators. By pooling and sharing multiple network connections across multiple servers and virtual machines, Virtual <b>Connect</b> <b>extends</b> Data Center capability by allowing physical setup and movement of Virtual Machine workloads between servers and Virtual Machines, transparently from the LAN and SAN infrastructure.|$|R
40|$|A (left) quandle is {{connected}} if its left multiplication group acts transitively. In 2014, Eisermann introduced {{the concept of}} quandle coverings, corresponding to so-called constant quandle cocycles that form a subset of quandle cocycles. A connected quandle {{is said to be}} simply connected if it has no nontrivial coverings, or, equivalently, if its second constant cohomology groups are trivial. In this paper we develop a combinatorial approach to constant cohomology. Upon applying our theory, we prove that connected quandles that are affine over cyclic groups are simply <b>connected</b> (<b>extending</b> a result of Graña for quandles of prime size) and that finite doubly transitive quandles of order different from 4 are simply connected...|$|R

In particular, it discusses the RERS initiative, which provides a community platform together with a learning framework that allows users to interactively compose complex learning solutions {{on the basis of}} libraries for various learning components, system connectors, and other auxiliary functionality.

This paper describes a work-in-progress WSN/robots communication framework that is being purposefully built to facilitate the constructions of robotic ecologies, i. e. networks of heterogeneous computational nodes interfaced with sensors, effectors and mobile robot devices. This paper discusses a number of requirements characterizing this type of systems and illustrates how they are being addressed {{in the design of the}} new communication framework...|$|R

40|$|We present {{transport}} measurements onYBCO single crystals in {{the vortex}} liquid regime using the De flux transformer geometry. We {{show that the}} data are inconsistent with the material being an anisotropic, local conductor. The results provided evidence for non-local transport which indicate {{that there can be}} correlated vortex motion over macroscopic distances in this system. We have shown that this correlated vortex motion can be destroyed by either thermal fluctuations or the applications of large driving forces. •. The effects of vortex line fluctuations in the mixed state of high teml~rature superconductors introduces novel physical phenomena important in explaining the experimental results. In several earlier works[I, 2], it has been demonstrated that in the vortex liquid regime of YBCO crystals, the vortices are well <b>connected</b> <b>extended</b> objects at lower temperatures and they becomes decorrelated ata well defined temperature Tth(H).

40|$|Interactions between {{localized}} plasmons in proximal nanostructures is a well-studied phenomenon. Here {{we explore}} plasmon plasmon interactions in <b>connected</b> <b>extended</b> systems. Such systems {{can now be}} easily produced using graphene. Specifically we employ the finite element method to study such interactions in graphene nanoribbon arrays with a periodically modulated electrochemical potential or number of layers. We find a rich variation in the resulting plasmonic resonances depending on the dimensions and the electrochemical potentials (doping) of the nanoribbon segments and the involvement of transverse and longitudinal plasmon interactions. Unlike predictions based of the well-known "orbital hybridization model", the energies of the resulting hybrid plasmonic resonances of the extended system can lie between the energies of the plasmons of the individual components. The results demonstrate the wide range tunability of the graphene plasmons and can help to design structures with desired spectra, {{which can be used}} to enhance optical fields in the infrared region of the electromagnetic spectrum.

40|$|John Smyth’s {{remarkable}} body of writing, {{research and}} scholarship has spanned four decades, and {{the urgency of}} our times makes it imperative to look in some depth at the breadth of his research and its trajectory, {{in order to see}} how we can <b>connect,</b> <b>extend,</b> build and enrich our understandings from it. Possibly the single most unique aspect to Smyth’s version of critical research is his passion for living and ‘doing’ {{what it means to be}} a critical pedagogue. For him, ‘doing’ is a verb that gives expression to what he believes it means to be a critical scholar. This necessitates actively listening to lives; taking on an advocacy position with informant groups; displaying a commitment to praxis; and being activist in celebrating ‘local responses’ to global issues. Smyth’s research is pursued with vigour through the lives he researches, as he interrupts and punctures ‘bad’ theory, supplanting it with more democratic alternatives, which, by his own admission, makes his research (and all research), political...|$|R
