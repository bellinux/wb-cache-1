40|$|The role {{of adult}} host {{preference}} {{as a mechanism}} of carrot (Daucus carota L. cultivar resistance to <b>carrot</b> <b>rust</b> <b>fly</b> (Psila rosae F. [Diptera: Psilidae]) attack was examined via an ovipositional preference study in the laboratory and a damage assessment in the field. Laboratory studies were conducted to determine if P. rosae had a propensity to oviposit on a specific cultivar. Cultivar pairs were exposed to adult P. rosae for seven days to two weeks in controlled temperature chambers and were examined {{for the number of}} eggs deposited by P. rosae through floatation and filtration of the samples. There was a significant difference (P = 0. 0015) between the number of eggs found on cv. Danvers Half Long 126 and on cv. Flyaway. There were no significant deviations from the expected 50 : 50 ratio in the tests comparing oviposition on Danvers and Nantes, Danvers and Chantenay, Nantes and Chantenay, and Nantes and Flyaway. [...] The resistance of the same four carrot cultivars to <b>carrot</b> <b>rust</b> <b>fly</b> attack was investigated in field studies at two sites in 1995 and 1996. Four carrot cultivars were planted in mid-June at two sites (Memorial University of Newfoundland Botanical Garden (BG) and Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada Research Centre, St. John's (RC)), in a randomized block design, and assessed for the damage caused by P. rosae larvae. At the BG site in 1995, significant damage was found on cv. Danvers Half Long 126 (1. 2 %), Nantes Half Long received 1. 1 % damage, Chantenay had 0. 9 % damage and Flyaway received 0. 3 % damage. No significant damage was found at this site in 1996 or at the RC site in 1995 or 1996. [...] Adult carrot rust flies were monitored with marigold-yellow sticky traps at home gardens and commercial sites in the St. John's area from mid-June to November in 1995 and 1996. One distinct period of adult activity was observed in 1995 whereas two distinct periods were observed in 1996. This reflects the occurrence of one generation per year typically and the possibility of another generation depending upon the season. Two-year means for cumulative air degree-days (DD) above 3 °C after 1 April for first, 10 %, maximum, and 90 % trap catch of the overwintering generation were 308, 418, 590, and 752 DD, respectively. [...] Adult carrot rust flies were trapped in carrot production areas in the regions surrounding Conception Bay, Placentia Bay, Bonavista Bay, Notre Dame Bay, and Bonne Bay. However, even though traps were placed in field in the area around St. George's Bay and in Labrador, no flies were trapped. [...] Damage caused by the larvae of the <b>carrot</b> <b>rust</b> <b>fly</b> was reduced in areas exposed to wind compared to more sheltered areas thus it is possible that <b>carrot</b> <b>rust</b> <b>fly</b> damage can be reduced by planting the carrot crop in exposed areas of the garden or field where the adult will have difficulty flying. [...] The study of the seasonal history and distribution of the <b>carrot</b> <b>rust</b> <b>fly</b> in Newfoundland provides valuable information to producers because it has alerted producers to a potential pest in their production area. The information will provide the farmer with the tools required to understand the activity of the <b>carrot</b> <b>rust</b> <b>fly</b> in the field and consequently accurately time controls. Although many studies have investigated the activity of the <b>carrot</b> <b>rust</b> <b>fly</b> in other parts of Canada and the world, the pest has never been studied in a climate similar to that found in Newfoundland...|$|E
40|$|The {{effectiveness}} of exclusion fences in preventing the colonization of carrot plantings by the <b>carrot</b> <b>rust</b> <b>fly,</b> Psila rosae (F.), was tested in small field plots. Fenced enclosures {{were surrounded by}} panels of mesh nylon window screen l 20 cm high. Control enclosures were left unfenced. Although the number of first generation P. rosae adults captured on yellow sticky traps was not significantly different between control and fenced enclosures, the number of second generation adults emerging within enclosures was significantly higher in control enclosures than in fenced enclosures. The percentage of unmarketable carrots, % damaged carrots, % urunarketable yield, % damaged yield, and number of lesions per carrot werc all significantly higher In control enclosures than in fenced enclosures. We conclude that exclusion fences impede the colonization of carrot plantings by P. rosae and reduce damage to carrots.

40|$|Protecting crops with insect fences is {{currently}} being considered {{as an alternative to}} row cover netting and synthetic insecticides. Previous studies reported efficacies of such fences with 50 - 90 % reduction in crop damage by root flies. We conducted trials with a 1. 70 m fence over two years to monitor <b>carrot</b> <b>rust</b> <b>fly</b> (Psila rosae) in carrots and cabbage root fly (Delia radicum) in radish. There was a significant reduction in cabbage root fly damage in fenced plots whereas no such effect could be found with <b>carrot</b> <b>rust</b> <b>fly.</b> The structure of the overhang {{at the top of the}} fence and the mobility of this particular species may be important elements to consider in fence design. The length of the overhang also seemed to be important for cabbage root fly (Delia radicum) control, as a statistically significant treatment effect was observed only when the overhang was 35 cm long. Using radish as a test crop, the fences reduced damage by 55 % in the second year of the trial. The population size of overwintering cabbage root flies was also an important factor, as the number of flies in the year that the fence was effective was lower than in the previous year...|$|E

40|$|Intercropping, {{or the use}} of {{different}} aspects of the interaction between organisms in ecosystems, can be classified as an ecological method that limits harmful human interference in the environment, especially the consumption of chemicals. The impact of intercropping carrot with coriander Coriandrum sativum L. and summer savory Satureja hortensis L. on the occurrence of select carrot pests was estimated in the years 2010 - 2011. Intercropping had a significant effect on the decrease of the number of roots damaged by <b>carrot</b> <b>rust</b> <b>fly</b> Psila rosae. During harvest, the least number of damaged roots was observed in combination with summer savory S. hortensis L. The number of carrot psyllid Trioza viridula Zett. and aphids on carrot leaves and roots damaged by nematodes was significantly lower on plots where carrot was intercropped. Intercropping both herbs had a positive influence on the number of beneficial insects.

40|$|Carrot weevils {{can damage}} up to 80 % of the carrots in a field. • Processors {{will not accept}} carrots with more than 1 % damage by carrot weevil. • Carrot rust flies cause about 20 % loss on organic carrot farms in Washington. • Prior to the {{introduction}} of synthetic chemicals, carrot growers spread about a ton of naphthalene flakes (moth balls) to control rust fly. Technical Summary Carrots are grown on 85, 000 acres with a production volume of 2. 9 billion pounds worth $ 500 million. Insects are erratic pests in most carrot fields. The three states with the highest usage of insecticides on carrots are Michigan, Texas and Washington. In these states insecticides are used on 77 - 100 % of the carrot acres and it is estimated that carrot yields would decline by 30 - 50 % without insecticide use [10]. Carrot fields in these three states have entrenched major insect pests which are not a problem in the other major producing states: Washington (<b>carrot</b> <b>rust</b> <b>fly),</b> Texas and Michigan (carrot weevil). In California 20 % of carrot acres are treated with insecticides primarily for leafhoppers and cutworms and production would decline by 15 % without this use [10][20].

40|$|The State of Washington is {{the number}} one {{producer}} of processing carrots in the United States and the fourth largest producer of fresh market carrots (Washington Agricultural Statistics Service 2001). This accounts for 33 % of the processed carrots and almost 4 % of the fresh carrots produced in the nation. Carrot production generated $ 29. 8 million dollars for Washington State in 2000 (Sorensen 2000). The leading carrot-producing counties are Benton and Franklin {{in the eastern part of}} the state and Cowlitz and Skagit west of the Cascade Mountains. As of 2000 Washington had 5000 acres of processing carrots and 3000 acres of fresh market carrots (Sorensen 2000). Approximately 2 % of the carrots grown in Washington were grown organically (Sorensen 2000). About the Pest Arguably the most important pest of carrots, particularly on the western side of the state, is the <b>carrot</b> <b>rust</b> <b>fly</b> (Psila rosae Fabricius) (Figure 1, a and b). The rust fly adult is about 6 - 8 mm long with a shiny black thorax and abdomen, a reddish-brown head, and yellow legs. The adult female lays its eggs in the soil at the base of the carrot. Six to ten days later the larva hatches and feeds on the carrot root, rendering the carrots impossible to market. Carrot rust flies obtain- 2...|$|E
40|$|Intercropping {{combines}} {{different aspects}} of the interaction between organisms in ecosystems and may be classified as a pro-ecological method of plant cultivation limiting the harmful human interference in the environment, especially the use of chemicals. It also allows high yield, good quality, and economic productivity to be achieved. The aim of the present study, conducted in the years 2003 – 2004 in Mydlniki near Kraków, was to determine the effect of intercropping carrot Nardin F 1 with French marigold (Tagetes patula nana L.) 'Kolombina' and pot marigold (Calendula officinalis L.) 'Promyk' on carrot yield, its quality, and the occurrence of pests. On average in both years of the study, intercropping did not reduce total or marketable carrot yield. In 2003 intercropping contributed to a significant increase in marketable yield compared with yield from sole cropping. In 2004 the dry matter content was higher in the roots of carrots grown with pot marigold. The treatments intercropped with both French and pot marigold were characterized by an increased content of sugars in carrot roots and in 2004 year – of carotenoids. Intercropping had a significant effect on the number of roots damaged by the <b>carrot</b> <b>rust</b> <b>fly,</b> Psila rosae, (the best in this respect was the combination with Tagetes) and by nematodes (the best in this respect was the combination with Calendula).

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} {{the origin and}} identification of mysterious particles in Papanicolaou smears from healthy, asymptomatic women participating in a local mass screening program. STUDY DESIGN: The material consisted of 16, 000 cervicovaginal smears studied at the cytology laboratory of Pathology Laboratory of South-Western Finland Ltd. Unidentified particles were found in four apparently independent smears. All the slides were rescreened, but no further positive cases were found. RESULTS: Several swab samples were collected from the investigation room, but all were negative. Attempts at identification included numerous consultations. A telepathology consultation with the Cellular Division, Armed Forces Institute of Pathology, Washington, D. C., U. S. A., was conducted. Another teleconsultation with the reference laboratory for intestinal parasites in Iceland was conducted. Finally, the Aerobiology Unit, University of Turku, was consulted. The aerobiologist suggested that the particles were most probably summer spores of birch rust fungus (Melampsoridium betulinum). To confirm this we obtained a reference specimen of the fungus from the herbarium at the University of Turku. The morphology of the spore particles was identical {{to that in the}} cervicovaginal smears, proving that the smears were contaminated with birch rust fungus spores. CONCLUSION: Birch rust is ubiquitous in Finland. Outside the hospital window there is a wide lawn behind which, at a distance of 70 m, there is a forest of birch trees. It is most likely that the <b>rust</b> spores <b>flew</b> in through the open window, to settle down on the surface of material that was used in sample taking.

40|$|Doctor of PhilosophyGenetics Interdepartmental ProgramJesse A. PolandWheat {{is perhaps}} the most {{important}} component in human diet introduced since the conception of modern agriculture, which provides about 20 % of the daily protein and calorie intake to billions of people. Adaptable to wide range of climates, wheat is grown worldwide, lending it the potential to mitigate the imminent risk of food security for future population of 9. 5 billion people. For developing improved crop varieties in the future, genetic diversity is a key factor in plant breeding. Constraints in wheat evolution and artificial selection practices have resulted in erosion of this ingredient in elite germplasm. However, wheat wild relatives, such as Ae. tauschii, D-genome donor of wheat, are a storehouse for unexploited genetic diversity {{that can be used for}} improving wheat for disease and insect resistance, yield, quality, and tolerance to abiotic stresses. More than 1700 genebanks around the world hold over 7 million accessions of these wild relatives. These genebanks are expensive to maintain, therefore, efficient curation is necessary. We developed and implemented a protocol to identify duplicate accessions using genomic tools. Implementing this approach with three genebanks, we identified over 50 % duplicated accessions across genebanks. There are over a million Triticeae accessions held collectively, and it is likely as more number of genebanks are tested, there will be decreasing number of unique accessions. Selecting and utilizing the wild genetic diversity is no easy task. Historically, breeders and geneticists have chosen the accessions primarily based on associated phenotypic data. Unless focusing on a targeted trait, this practice is imperfect in capturing the genetic diversity with some other limitations, such as confounding phenotypic data with the testing environment. Utilizing next-generation sequencing methods, we selected a MiniCore consisting of only 40 accessions out of 574 capturing more than 95 % of the allelic diversity. This MiniCore will facilitate the use of genetic diversity present in Ae. tauschii for wheat improvement including resistance to leaf rust, stem <b>rust,</b> Hessian <b>fly,</b> and tolerance to abiotic stresses. Hessian fly is an important insect pest of wheat worldwide. Out of 34 known resistance genes, only six have been mapped on the D sub-genome. With swift HF evolution, we need to rapidly map and deploy the resistance genes. Some of the undefeated HF resistance genes, such as H 26 and H 32, were introgressed from Ae. tauschii. In this study, we mapped three previously known genes, and a new gene from Ae. tauschii accession KU 2147. Genes were mapped on chromosomes 6 B, 3 D, and 6 D. Further, identification and cloning of resistance genes will enhance our understanding about its function and mode of action. In conclusion, wild wheat relatives are genetically diverse species, and utilizing the novel genetic diversity in Ae. tauschii will be fruitful for wheat improvement in the wake of climate change to ensure future food security to expected 2 billion newcomers by 2050...|$|R
