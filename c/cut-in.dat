5|$|Takumi {{felt that}} the best way to write a mystery with a good climax is to reveal various clues, and then pull them {{together}} into one conclusion, and not have multiple possible endings. He said that the biggest challenge with that was to make the gameplay and story work together; the goal was to make the player feel like they have driven the story forward themselves, with their own choices, even though the game is linear. When writing the episodes, Takumi ranked each after its importance: the first episode was the most important, to make sure that the player likes the game; the second episode was the second most important, to solidify the player's interest; and the finale was the third most important. In general, each scenario was finished before anything else was done; after this, characters were designed based on the scenarios, and then Takumi adjusted dialogue as needed to make sure that it fit the designs. At this point, it was also decided what scenes were going to have specific <b>cut-in</b> illustrations made for them; Takumi drew rough sketches of them, and also drew the storyboards for the episodes' openings, which consist of series of detailed drawings that show what is happening.|$|E
5|$|After {{finishing}} {{writing the}} dialogue, Takumi was called into another meeting with Inaba, {{and was told}} to add a new gameplay mechanic to the investigations. Takumi {{wanted to keep the}} gameplay simple enough for his mother {{to be able to play}} it, and keep it focused on the core concept of finding lies; according to him, he immediately had a vision of the psyche lock system during the meeting with Inaba, but still asked for three days to come up with an idea. He found it easy to formulate the idea, but it took over a month to create the system; the biggest problem was how to visually represent the psyche locks. Takumi also drew storyboards for the episodes' openings, which consisted of series of detailed drawings that show what is happening. He also drew rough sketches of <b>cut-in</b> illustrations; it was only decided after all the text had been written what scenes would have illustrations made for them. While the game's opening features the judge, it was originally supposed to have featured a demon instead; this was because Takumi was playing Devil May Cry at the time, and had liked its opening. As Takumi wanted the first three Ace Attorney games to be part of one larger work, he did not want the first game to look outdated in comparison to later ones, so it was decided to keep the same graphics for main characters such as Phoenix, Maya and Edgeworth throughout all their appearances, and not make updates to them. The game's music was composed by Naoto Tanaka under the pseudonym Akemi Kimura.|$|E
25|$|In 2013 Al Jazeera Media Network began {{planning}} a new channel called Al Jazeera UK. If launched, the British channel would broadcast {{for five hours}} during prime time as <b>cut-in</b> UK content aired on Al Jazeera English. It would in effect function much like RT UK and RT America does in the United States.|$|E
50|$|In addition, since November 14, 2011, KRCW {{produces}} {{local news}} and weather <b>cut-ins</b> {{under the name}} Portland's Morning News during the Tribune-produced EyeOpener program; the <b>cut-ins</b> are anchored by Ken Ackerman in-studio and weather segments are anchored by Tim Joyce.|$|R
50|$|After Castro's departure, {{the hosts}} had cut {{directly}} to local CBS affiliates to provide forecast <b>cut-ins</b> (with a narrated national outlook available to stations {{that did not}} provide <b>cut-ins</b> due {{to the absence of}} a news department), making CBS {{the only one of the}} three major broadcast morning shows without a national forecast segment.|$|R
50|$|The {{program is}} {{different}} from other studio programs, such as Baseball Tonight, in that it contains live <b>cut-ins</b> to NBA games in-progress as well as interviews with players after games end. However, the live <b>cut-ins</b> are not truly live, as there is usually a gap of a few minutes between the direct feed and what ESPN is showing.|$|R
25|$|It {{crosses to}} Meycauayan River {{and after a}} few meters is the Meycauayan Exit to serve its town proper. Another service road named St. Francis Service Road that is located beside the expressway's {{southbound}} lane. It passes through residential areas and institutions within the municipality, intersects with Lias Road, and continues straightforward. On Marilao, there is a Petron service area and after it are the Marilao River and its exit. It enters Bocaue after Marilao Exit and intersects with Duhat Overpass. This is where the Hermosa-Balintawak line connects with Meralco Duhat substation to make a <b>cut-in</b> connection with it thus NGCP calls the power line as Balintawak-Duhat and Duhat-Hermosa transmission lines as well as separating it into two individual lines. Another Meralco subtransmission line enters the expressway and adjacent to the said substation is a plant of Atlas Feeds. The Philippine Arena can be seen on this segment. The road turns eastward to serve Bocaue toll plaza, with a southbound lane being widened to 22 lanes with 4 from a service road making a grand total of 26 lanes, and on the middle of it is a newly built toll plaza and road. It turns westward, passes through Bocaue Exit, Santa Maria River, and Taal Bridge, and continues on a straight direction until Balagtas Interchange. Before it are the Petron for southbound and Shell for northbound lanes. Pass Shell service area is the Tabang Spur Road and Balagtas Interchange which was opened on March 20, 2012. This is the former terminus of the original segment of an expressway from 1967 to 1976 before it extended to Dau.|$|E
2500|$|However, diodes {{can have}} more {{complicated}} behavior than this simple on–off action, because of their nonlinear current-voltage characteristics. [...] Semiconductor diodes begin conducting electricity only if a certain threshold voltage or <b>cut-in</b> voltage {{is present in the}} forward direction (a state in which the diode is said to be forward-biased). The voltage drop across a forward-biased diode varies only a little with the current, and is a function of temperature; this effect {{can be used as a}} temperature sensor or as a voltage reference.|$|E
2500|$|With a {{small forward}} bias, where {{only a small}} forward current is conducted, the current–voltage curve is {{exponential}} {{in accordance with the}} ideal diode equation. [...] There is a definite forward voltage at which the diode starts to conduct significantly. [...] This is called the knee voltage or <b>cut-in</b> voltage and is equal to the barrier potential of the p-n junction. This is a feature of the exponential curve, and appears sharper on a current scale more compressed than in the diagram shown here.|$|E

50|$|WFIE-DT2 was {{launched}} in Fall 2005 as an affiliate of the NBC Weather Plus service, a 24-hour weather channel that provided regional and national weather information forecasts in a continuous basis, along with <b>cut-ins</b> of local weather forecasts from WFIE's weather forecasting team. WFIE's weather team provided the <b>cut-ins</b> for WFIE-DT2 during the entire existence of NBC weather plus. The channel's original branding was First Alert Weather Now.|$|R
5000|$|Both newscasts {{were pulled}} in mid-2005 due to poor ratings; the News Central format would {{be phased out}} entirely in its other markets by March 2006. For a time afterward, News Central still {{provided}} WXLV with weekday morning weather <b>cut-ins</b> during Good Morning America featuring meteorologist Tony Pagnotti. Production of the <b>cut-ins</b> is now based from its Asheville sister station, WLOS, with meteorologist Julie Wunder providing the taped-in-advance updates.|$|R
2500|$|The diagram shows a {{schematic}} representation of an NPN transistor connected to two voltage sources. ( [...] The same description applies to a PNP transistor with reversed directions of current flow and applied voltage.) [...] To make the transistor conduct appreciable current (on {{the order of}} 1mA) from C to E, VBE must be above a minimum value {{sometimes referred to as}} the <b>cut-in</b> voltage. The <b>cut-in</b> voltage is usually about 650mV for silicon BJTs at room temperature but can be different {{depending on the type of}} transistor and its biasing. This applied voltage causes the lower P-N junction to 'turn on', allowing a flow of electrons from the emitter into the base. In active mode, the electric field existing between base and collector (caused by VCE) will cause the majority of these electrons to cross the upper P-N junction into the collector to form the collector current IC. The remainder of the electrons recombine with holes, the majority carriers in the base, making a current through the base connection to form the base current, IB. As shown in the diagram, the emitter current, IE, is the total transistor current, which is the sum of the other terminal currents, (i.e., IE=IB+IC).|$|E
2500|$|An {{optional}} console shifted [...] "Twin-Stick" [...] manual overdrive transmission was introduced. This transmission has {{a bigger}} gap between 2nd and 3rd gears {{compared to the}} regular three-speed transmissions with overdrive (that operated like a five-speed although the driver needed to know the governor <b>cut-in</b> speed, free-wheeling, as well as when to lock the overdrive in or out). This allowed the transmission to be shifted as a five-speed (1, 2, 2+OD, 3, and 3+OD). The Twin-Stick-shift had the kick-down button {{on top of the}} main shift-knob to facilitate five-speed shifting.|$|E

If needed, the Batmobile is capable of a quick 180° [...] "bat-turn" [...] thanks to two rear-mounted ten-foot Deist parachutes. [...] The main license plate seen throughout the series was 2F-3567 (1966). Some changes were made during {{the run of the}} series, including different license plates (TP-3567; BT-1 and BAT-1), removal of the Futura steering wheel and substitution with a 1958 Edsel steering wheel, and the addition of extra gadgets such as a net in the trunk, remote-controlled driving, a rear-facing camera under the turbine exhaust port, and the Bat Ram.|$|E
50|$|KRXI {{simulcasts}} newscasts {{from former}} sister station and current Fox {{owned and operated}} station KTVU in Oakland, California. It includes an hour-long prime time news (weeknights at 10:00 p.m.). All newscasts are presented in high definition from KTVU's studios at Jack London Square in Downtown Oakland. During the nightly news at 10:00 p.m., there were local weather <b>cut-ins</b> provided by AccuWeather meteorologists (weeknights at 10:40 p.m. and weekends at 10:40 p.m.). These forecast segments, taped in advance, originate from headquarters on Science Park Road in State College, Pennsylvania. Both of the weather <b>cut-ins</b> ended on June 17, 2014 (weeknights) and on June 20, 2014 (weekends), {{in favor of the}} local weather and news <b>cut-ins</b> provided by KRNV-DT (weeknights at 10:40 p.m. and weekends at 10:40 p.m.).|$|R
50|$|The format {{allowed for}} news and weather <b>cut-ins,</b> however not every {{affiliate}} provided local updates, usually {{due to a}} lack of a staff normally assigned for a weekend (or at least, a Saturday) morning newscast on stations that did not offer local updates. Alternately, an informal conversation segment among the anchors appeared during the time allocated to the <b>cut-ins,</b> and graphical weather information for various U.S. cities during the weather <b>cut-ins</b> on stations that did not provide local updates. Weather anchors Ira Joe Fisher and, initially, Lonnie Quinn, would provide voiceovers for some of the forecasts, while chatting with people in the audience outside the studio's building; afterward, the graphics ran only set to music. In 2008, The Saturday Early Show began to be branded as simply The Early Show, in line with the weekday edition.|$|R

60|$|In {{shape the}} plateau resembled the ace of clubs. The center and side wings were high and well wooded with heavy pines; the middle wing was longest, sloped west, had no pine, but a dense growth of cedar. Numerous ridges and canyons cut up this central wing. Middle Canyon, {{the longest and}} deepest, {{bisected}} the plateau, headed near camp, and ran parallel with two smaller ones, which we named Right and Left Canyons. These three were lion runways and hundreds of deer carcasses lined the thickets. North Hollow was the only depression, as well as runway, on the northwest rim. West Point formed the extreme western cape of the plateau. To the left of West Point was a deep <b>cut-in</b> of the rim wall, called the Bay. The three important canyons opened into it. From the Bay, the south rim was regular and impassable all the way round to the narrow Saddle, which connected it to the mainland.|$|E
50|$|Pressuretrols have 2 settings: A main <b>cut-in</b> or cut-out setting (depending on model), and a {{differential}} setting (which {{is either}} additive or subtractive, and usually stated on the controller). The main setting is accessible {{from the outside}} of the controller, but the differential is often located inside the controller box, and typically the cover must be removed by removing a screw to access the differential control. If the main setting is a <b>cut-in</b> setting, then the differential setting sets the cut-out setpoint by adding to the <b>cut-in</b> setting(additive), and if the main setting is a cut-out setting, then the differential sets the <b>cut-in</b> by subtracting from the cut-out setting (subtractive).|$|E
