The New York–Montreal Adirondack received Turboliners on March 1, 1977, replacing <b>conventional</b> <b>equipment.</b> By April 1977, Turboliners had displaced <b>conventional</b> <b>equipment</b> on most routes in upstate New York.

5|$|Amtrak {{established}} a separate maintenance facility for all six trainsets in the Brighton Park neighborhood of Chicago, {{on the site}} of a former Gulf, Mobile and Ohio Railroad coach yard. This facility closed in 1981 after the withdrawal of the RTGs from service; according to Amtrak, the trainsets were too expensive to operate compared to <b>conventional</b> <b>equipment.</b> The trainsets were mothballed at Amtrak's main maintenance facility in Beech Grove, Indiana. A contributing factor to the withdrawal was the spike in fuel prices after the Yom Kippur War.|$|E

After the discontinuance of the Daylight and Night Diamond on October 27, 1958 the Green Diamond became the Illinois Central's last train between Chicago and St. Louis and its departure from St. Louis {{moved up to}} mid-afternoon. On May 20, 1968 the Illinois Central truncated it to Springfield, Illinois and renamed it the Governor's Special, a name which if nothing else suited the new terminus. The Green Diamond had operated just over 32 years. Amtrak did not continue the Governor's Special and it ended on April 30, 1971. However, Amtrak Lincoln Service has been provided along the route since 2006, {{as well as the}} longer route Texas Eagle since the 1980s.|$|E

50|$|The excavatability of an earth (rock and regolith) {{material}} {{is a measure}} of the material to be excavated (dug) with <b>conventional</b> excavation <b>equipment</b> such as a bulldozer with rippers, backhoe, scraper and other grading equipment. Materials that cannot be excavated with <b>conventional</b> excavation <b>equipment</b> are said to be non-rippable. Such material typically requires pre-blasting or use of percussion hammers or chisels to facilitate excavation. The excavatability or rippability of earth materials is evaluated typically by a geophysicist, engineering geologist, or geotechnical engineer.|$|R
5000|$|Special use {{in nuclear}} {{industries}} for fuel reprocessing, where spent fuel from reactors {{is subjected to}} solvent extraction. A pulsation is created using air by a pulse leg. The feed is aqueous solution containing radioactive solutes, and the solvent used is TBP (Tri-Butyl Phosphate) in suitable hydrocarbon. To create turbulence for dispersion of one phase in other, a mechanical agitator is used in <b>conventional</b> <b>equipments.</b> But, because of radioactivity, and frequent maintenance required for mechanical agitators, pulsing is used in extraction columns.|$|R
500|$|The Hi-Levels stood [...] high, [...] {{taller than}} most <b>conventional</b> <b>equipment.</b> Seating {{occupied}} the entire upper level, with restrooms, baggage, and other non-revenue {{areas on the}} lower level. In most cars, vestibules connected the upper levels only. A central staircase linked the two levels. Hi-Levels featured a row of windows across the upper level; on the prototype coaches, this row slanted inwards. The two-level design offered several advantages over conventional single-level equipment. Budd and the Santa Fe expected the upper level, located [...] above the rails, to provide a smoother, quieter ride for passengers. With the lower level free of passengers, designers could provide larger restrooms and baggage areas. Finally, the lower level contained all the electrical equipment, away from the passengers, and with easy access for maintenance. The cars cost [...] apiece.|$|E
