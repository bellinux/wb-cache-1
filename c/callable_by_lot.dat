5000|$|Two {{types of}} stored {{procedures}} are supported: Managed Assembly Stored Procedure (MASP) and Common Language Runtime Stored Procedure (CLRSP). A MASP {{consists of a}} compiled [...]NET assembly containing a public interface exposed through the KSP {{as well as any}} dependent files. Once the MASP is uploaded to the KSP through its management interface, it becomes <b>callable</b> <b>by</b> KSP client programs. A CLRSP consists of a source file written in one of the supported CLR programming languages (C#, Visual Basic [...]NET, Managed Extensions for C++, and others). The functionalities of the CLRSPs are exposed through a public interface defined in the source file. Once the CLRSP is deployed to KSP through its management interface, it is compiled on-demand by KSP and becomes <b>callable</b> <b>by</b> KSP client programs. Compared to database sprocs, KSP sprocs are object-oriented. A sproc may contain a set of related functions, or even identically named functions with different signatures.|$|R
40|$|The {{problem of}} {{enabling}} a `sleeping' process on a shared-memory multiprocessor {{is a difficult}} one, especially if the process is to be awakened by an interrupt-time event. We present here the code for sleep and wakeup primitives that we use in our multiprocessor system. The code has been exercised by months of active use and by a verification system. Our problem is to synchronise processes on a symmetric shared-memory multiprocessor. Processes suspend execution, or sleep, while awaiting an enabling event such as an I/O interrupt. When the event occurs, the process is issued a wakeup to resume its execution. During these events, other processes may be running and other interrupts occurring on other processors. More specifically, we wish to implement subroutines called sleep, <b>callable</b> <b>by</b> a process to relinquish control of its current processor, and wakeup, <b>callable</b> <b>by</b> another process or an interrupt to resume the execution of a suspended process. The calling conventions of these subroutin [...] ...|$|R

50|$|ACC is a near-C {{compiler}} for the MS-DOS {{operating system}} on the IBM PC line of computers for programs. The compiler and compiled programs will run on any Intel 80386 or above PC running MS-DOS. Included with the compiler are a 386 assembler and a linker for combining multiple object files. There are also two libraries, which are a protected mode DOS extender (based on Thomas Pytel's, AKA Tran's PMODE30B + PMODE307 DOS extenders), and a library of functions <b>callable</b> <b>by</b> C programs.|$|R
50|$|Noncumulative {{perpetual}} debt {{is almost}} identical to typical preferred shares (most of which are noncumulative), the only difference being that preferred shares often {{have the option of}} conversion to common shares, while perpetual debt generally does not. Because noncumulative perpetual debt can be counted as Tier 2 capital (supplementary capital), it is generally issued by banks as a way to maintain capital requirements (i.e. capital adequacy ratio or CAR). The debt is generally <b>callable</b> <b>by</b> the issuer at some point.|$|R

50|$|New {{regulations}} for {{the elections of}} the doge introduced in 1268 remained in force {{until the end of}} the republic in 1797. Their object was to minimize as far as possible the influence of individual great families, and this was effected by a complex electoral machinery. Thirty members of the Great Council, chosen <b>by</b> <b>lot,</b> were reduced <b>by</b> <b>lot</b> to nine; the nine chose forty and the forty were reduced <b>by</b> <b>lot</b> to twelve, who chose twenty-five. The twenty-five were reduced <b>by</b> <b>lot</b> to nine and the nine elected forty-five. Then the forty-five were once more reduced <b>by</b> <b>lot</b> to eleven, and the eleven finally chose the forty-one who actually elected the doge. None could be elected but by at least twenty-five votes out of forty-one, nine votes out of eleven or twelve, or seven votes out of nine electors. A detailed description of this process, and the ceremonial procession that followed, is preserved in Martin Da Canale's work Les Estoires de Venise (English translation by Laura K. Morreale, Padua 2009).|$|R

50|$|If {{a player}} {{does not follow}} suit when {{he is able to}} (usually by playing a trump card instead), it is {{considered}} a renege and cheating, and the opposing team is rewarded two points if it is caught in later tricks of the same hand. However reneges can also be unintentional, where a player misreads some of his/her cards, most commonly by misinterpreting the left bauer as being of its native suit, but are still <b>callable</b> <b>by</b> opponents as reneging. In some variants reneging when a player or his opponent is going alone may result in a penalty of four points in order to equalize the potential values of a hand. Usually reneging on purpose is not discouraged as long as the player is not caught and many strategies can be used to confuse the opposing team or disguise ones cheating.The four point penalty for reneging should apply equally for the maker of trump and the opposing team.|$|R
40|$|Control {{of custom}} {{instrumentation}} as accomplished through platforms consisting of unique hardware, drivers, process and control programs, and user interfaces can alternatively be implemented with custom PCI hardware, custom driver software, and commercial process and control applications including the user interface. Process control of SNS custom diagnostics PCI instrumentation is accomplished through applications developed from standard commercial software. The system’s design maximizes modularization of the hardware, software, and operator interface, which simplifies {{the complexity of}} development by requiring minimal overlap of expertise between the hardware designers, software engineers, and operators. Cost of development is also kept minimal by integrating commercial software packages at the lowest level possible. SNS diagnostics hardware designers independently create LabVIEW applications to verify the functionality of their instruments. The software driver modules are implemented as DLLs containing exported functions <b>callable</b> <b>by</b> any number of client processes. A library of sub-VIs is pre-configured with driver function calls establishing the communications connection for instrument control and data acquisition...|$|R
