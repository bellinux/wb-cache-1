500|$|A {{distinguishing}} {{feature of the}} locomotive was the high-set Nclass boiler, which was pitched [...] above the frames to accommodate the inside <b>cylinder</b> <b>assembly,</b> potentially exposing the conjugation mechanism to the elements. To prevent corrosion, Maunsell incorporated a vertical metal cover above the front buffer beam to protect the inside cylinder and valve gear assembly, the main visual difference from the Nclass. Maunsell and Holcroft anticipated that the standard Nclass chimney would choke the exhaust blast produced by the three cylinders. To mitigate this, a wider-diameter blastpipe was cast for the locomotive and a new smokebox fabricated to accommodate a wide-diameter cast chimney. The rest of the construction process followed the 1919 N1 specification, and the final {{three members of the}} order for 15 Nclass locomotives were built as intended. The N1 prototype was completed in December 1922 and attached to a standard Maunsell [...] flat-sided Ashford Nclass tender. It entered service on 24 March 1923 and the boiler pressure was reduced from [...] to [...] for No.822's fuel consumption to be compared with that of the 2-cylinder Nclass during trials.|$|E

500|$|At the Southern Railway’s January 1925 Locomotive Committee meeting, when it {{was decided}} to use outside {{contractors}} to build the Kclass, Maunsell received authority to retain one set of parts at Ashford works to construct a prototype 3-cylinder 2-6-4 tank. The modification was based upon that used on Nclass No.822 to produce a 3-cylinder locomotive in 1922, although it retained the [...] driving wheels and shorter wheelbase of the Kclass. The modification was the inclusion of an additional (inside) cylinder between the frames, and a crank axle was fitted to the middle driving wheels. The axle was connected to the inside <b>cylinder</b> <b>assembly</b> by a connecting rod inclined at 1 in 8 to clear the front driving axle. [...] This arrangement was supplemented by two smaller-diameter outside cylinders with [...] bore (compared to the [...] cylinders of the Kclass), and a greater chimney diameter. The resulting prototype 3-cylinder [...] "K1" [...] was narrower than the Kclass and hence could work on routes with restricted loading gauge. As with No.822, this locomotive used Holcroft's derivative of the Gresley conjugated valve gear to drive the inside cylinder. To accommodate this, the boiler had to be raised by [...] above the inside gear, raising the centre of gravity on the locomotive.|$|E
2500|$|... 1909 saw {{radial engine}} forms rise to significance. The {{air-cooled}} Anzani 3-cylinder semi-radial or fan engine of 1909 (also {{built in a}} true, 120° cylinder angle radial form) developed only 25hp (16kW) but was much lighter than the liquid-cooled [...] Antoinette, and was chosen by Louis Blériot for his cross-Channel flight. A major advance came {{with the introduction of}} the Seguin brothers' Gnome Omega air-cooled rotary engine, exhibited at the Paris Aero Salon 1n 1908 and first fitted to an aircraft in 1909. [...] This radial-configuration engine was constructed {{in such a way that}} the entire crankcase and <b>cylinder</b> <b>assembly</b> rotated around a stationary crankshaft, itself fastened securely through the engine's rear attachment to the airframe, ensuring an adequate flow of cooling air over the cylinders even when the aircraft was not moving. [...] Although this type had been introduced as long ago as 1887 by Lawrence Hargrave and built two years later by Hargrave for compressed-air power — with an experimental five-cylinder internal combustion rotary engine used by French inventor Félix Millet that same year to power an early motorcycle design — improvements made to the Seguin brothers' Gnome series of engine designs created a robust, relatively reliable and lightweight design which revolutionised aviation and would see continuous development over the next ten years. Fuel was introduced into each cylinder direct from the crankcase meaning that only an exhaust valve was required. [...] Producing 37kW (50hp) for a dry weight of 75kg (165lb), this engine soon became one of the most widely used powerplants; the company went on to produce a number of similar engines producing more power, first by increasing the engine capacity and also by producing two-row variants. The larger and more powerful nine-cylinder. French-made Le Rhone 9C 80hp rotary was introduced in 1913 and was widely adopted for military use.|$|E

40|$|The {{friction}} pair of {{piston rings}} and cylinder liner {{is one of}} the most important friction couplings in an internal combustion engine. It influences engine efficiency and service life. Under the excitation of piston slaps, the dynamic deformation of cylinder liner is close to the surface roughness magnitudes, which can affect the friction and lubrication performance between the piston rings and <b>cylinder</b> <b>assemblies.</b> To investigate the potential influences of structural deformations to tribological behaviours of <b>cylinder</b> <b>assemblies,</b> the dynamic deformation of the inner surface due to pistons slaps is obtained by dynamic simulations, and then coupled into an improved lubrication model. Different from the traditional lubrication model which takes the pressure stress factor and shear stress factor to be constant, the model proposed in this paper calculated these factors in real time using numerical integration to achieve a more realistic simulation. Based on the improved piston rings and cylinder liner lubrication model, the minimum oil film thickness and friction force curves are obtained for an entire work cycle. It shows that the friction force obtained from the improved model manifests clear oscillations in each stoke, which is different from the smoothed profiles predicted traditionally. Moreover, the average amplitude of the friction forces also shows clear reduction...|$|R

50|$|After {{a period}} of service, {{ordnance}} personnel began to receive BARs with inoperable or malfunctioning recoil buffer mechanisms. This was eventually traced to the soldier's common practice of cleaning the BAR in a vertical position with {{the butt of the}} weapon on the ground, allowing cleaning fluid and burned powder to collect in the recoil buffer mechanism. Additionally, unlike the M1 rifle, the BAR's gas cylinder was never changed to stainless steel. Consequently, the gas cylinder frequently rusted solid from the use of corrosive-primered M2 service ammunition in a humid environment when not stripped and cleaned on a daily basis. While not without design flaws (a thin-diameter, fixed barrel that quickly overheated, limited magazine capacity, complex field-strip/cleaning procedure, unreliable recoil buffer mechanism, a gas <b>cylinder</b> <b>assembly</b> made of corrosion-prone metals, and many small internal parts), the BAR proved rugged and reliable enough when regularly field-stripped and cleaned.|$|E
5000|$|The term power {{assembly}} {{refers to an}} Electro-Motive Diesel (EMD) engine sub-assembly designed to be [...] "easily" [...] removed and replaced in order to restore engine performance lost to wear or engine failure.

This increases engine value, reduces downtime and allows the engine {{to be returned to}} true new engine performance. Other terms such as cylinder pack, liner pack, <b>cylinder</b> <b>assembly</b> and cylinder kit are used in the engine industry to describe similar assemblies.

Although it was down and locked, the rapid and abnormal free fall of the gear damaged a microswitch so severely that it failed to complete the circuit to the cockpit green light that tells the pilots that gear is down and locked. Those unusual indications (loud noise, vibration, yaw, and no green light) led the captain to abort the landing, {{so that they would}} have time to diagnose the problem and prepare the passengers for an emergency landing. While the decision to abort the landing was prudent, the accident occurred because the flight crew became so absorbed with diagnosing the problem that they failed to monitor their fuel state and calculate a time when they needed to return to land or risk fuel exhaustion.|$|E
