5|$|In {{addition}} to contextual animal ethics and her exploration {{of animals in}} environmental ethics, Palmer has written on disenhanced animals (i.e., animals that have been engineered to lose certain capacities) and companion animals.

40|$|Although {{the law has}} {{traditionally}} treated non-human animals as property, public attitudes and many of our current laws already are beginning reflect {{many ways in which}} <b>animals,</b> and especially <b>companion</b> <b>animals,</b> are fundamentally different from inanimate property. Despite these trends, the differences between animals and inanimate property need to be more clearly reflected in our laws, because there are still too many cases where the results under current laws are inconsistent with this understanding of <b>companion</b> <b>animals.</b> This article proposes the legislative creation of a new status that formally recognizes <b>companion</b> <b>animals</b> as a distinct legal category: “companion animal property. ” A separate legal category for <b>companion</b> <b>animals</b> has both intuitive appeal and would better reflect {{the way in which we}} value <b>companion</b> <b>animals</b> in our society. In addition to recognizing the bonds between humans and animals, formally creating a new legal category for <b>companion</b> <b>animals</b> leads to more consistency in the law and would help to make sense of a number of judicial and legislative trends that have been emerging in the past decade or more. Changing the legal status of animals has many positive implications for the veterinary profession. Previous opposition to such change – driven primarily by fears about increased malpractice awards – should give way to recognition of the numerous ways the veterinary profession will benefit from enhancing the legal status of <b>companion</b> <b>animals.</b> It is ultimately in the best interest of the profession to raise the status of <b>companion</b> <b>animals</b> above that of inanimate property...|$|R
40|$|<b>Companion</b> <b>animals</b> {{are found}} in the {{majority}} of western households. In surveys it has been found that <b>companion</b> <b>animals</b> are often viewed as family members. There is debate in psychological literature on what people mean when they describe <b>companion</b> <b>animals</b> in familial terms, with three theoretical frameworks posited to help explain the pets-as-family phenomena. Attachment theorists suggest that pets meet all four criteria for psychological attachment. Other researchers have suggested that <b>companion</b> <b>animals</b> are positioned within family systems, and are part of the dynamic interplay between human family members. Evolutionary psychologists have suggested that <b>companion</b> <b>animals</b> take advantage of in-built nurturing mechanisms in humans. The present study utilises interpretive phenomenology to explore the unique perspective of a new romantic partner’s perspective of a pre-existing human-pet dyad. Eight participants, four male and four female are interviewed using semi-structured questioning to find emergent themes. Each theory will be critically evaluated in reference to these themes, and suggestions for further research in this area will be proposed...|$|R

The animal was a frequent travel companion to the singer, whose attachment to the animal led to media mockery and, among other factors, a public perception of Jackson as eccentric. During the Bad world tour, for example, Jackson brought Bubbles with him to Japan, where they both drank tea with the mayor of Osaka.|$|E

40|$|International audienceAntimicrobials are {{important}} tools for the therapy of infectious bacterial diseases in <b>companion</b> <b>animals.</b> Loss of efficacy of antimicrobial substances can seriously compromise animal health and welfare. A {{need for the}} development of new antimicrobials for the therapy of multiresistant infections, particularly those caused by Gram-negative bacteria, has been acknowledged in human medicine and a future corresponding need in veterinary medicine is expected. A unique aspect related to antimicrobial resistance and risk of resistance transfer in <b>companion</b> <b>animals</b> is their close contact with humans. This creates opportunities for interspecies transmission of resistant bacteria. Yet, the current knowledge of this field is limited and no risk assessment is performed when approving new veterinary antimicrobials. The objective of this review is to summarize the current knowledge on the use and indications for antimicrobials in <b>companion</b> <b>animals,</b> drug-resistant bacteria of concern among <b>companion</b> <b>animals,</b> risk factors for colonization of <b>companion</b> <b>animals</b> with resistant bacteria and transmission of antimicrobial resistance (bacteria and/or resistance determinants) between animals and humans. The major antimicrobial resistance microbiological hazards originating from <b>companion</b> <b>animals</b> that directly or indirectly may cause adverse health effects in humans are MRSA, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus pseudintermedius, VRE, ESBL- or carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae and Gram-negative bacteria. In the face of the previously recognized microbiological hazards, a risk assessment tool could be applied in applications for marketing authorization for medicinal products for <b>companion</b> <b>animals.</b> This would allow the approval of new veterinary medicinal antimicrobials for which risk levels are estimated as acceptable for public health...|$|R
40|$|<b>Companion</b> <b>animals</b> {{and their}} human guardians suffer {{from many of}} the same types of cancer and are often treated with many of the same drugs. Moreover, the overall tumour biology is much more similar between humans and <b>companion</b> <b>animals</b> than between humans and rodent tumor models. Therefore, it is {{proposed}} that pre-clinical evaluation of novel cancer therapeutics should more often include appropriately designed trials in <b>companion</b> <b>animals</b> with cancer to more accurately predict efficacy and toxicity in humans. For example, studies in dogs with cancer have been used to assess efficacy and design human clinical trials of immunotherapy, gene therapy, sustained release drug delivery and liposomal drug delivery. In the future, such studies will ultimately benefit not only humans, but also <b>companion</b> <b>animals</b> with cancer...|$|R

40|$|Understanding the {{zoonotic}} risk {{posed by}} poxviruses in <b>companion</b> <b>animals</b> {{is important for}} protecting both human and animal health. The outbreak of monkeypox in the United States, as well as current reports of cowpox in Europe, {{point to the fact}} that <b>companion</b> <b>animals</b> are increasingly serving as sources of poxvirus transmission to people. In addition, the trend among hobbyists to keep livestock (such as goats) in urban and semi-urban areas has contributed to increased parapoxvirus exposures among people not traditionally considered at high risk. Despite the historic notoriety of poxviruses and the diseases they cause, poxvirus infections are often missed. Delays in diagnosing poxvirus-associated infections in <b>companion</b> <b>animals</b> can lead to inadvertent human exposures. Delays in confirming human infections can result in inappropriate treatment or prolonged recovery. Early recognition of poxvirus-associated infections and application of appropriate preventive measures can reduce the spread of virus between <b>companion</b> <b>animals</b> and their owners. This review will discuss the epidemiology and clinical features associated with the zoonotic poxvirus infections most commonly associated with <b>companion</b> <b>animals...</b>|$|R
