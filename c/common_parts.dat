5|$|When resting, lion {{socialisation}} occurs {{through a}} number of behaviours, and the animal's expressive movements are highly developed. The most common peaceful tactile gestures are head rubbing and social licking, which have been compared with grooming in primates. Head rubbing – nuzzling one's forehead, face and neck against another lion – appears to be a form of greeting, as it is seen often after an animal has been apart from others, or after a fight or confrontation. Males tend to rub other males, while cubs and females rub females. Social licking often occurs in tandem with head rubbing; it is generally mutual and the recipient appears to express pleasure. The head and neck are the most <b>common</b> <b>parts</b> of the body licked, which may have arisen out of utility, as a lion cannot lick these areas individually.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} joint source-channel coding problem of sending two {{correlated}} memoryless sources with <b>common</b> <b>part</b> over a memoryless multiple access channel (MAC). An inner bound and two outer bounds on the achievable distortion region are derived. In particular, they respectively recover the existing bounds for several special cases, such as communication without <b>common</b> <b>part,</b> lossless communication, and noiseless communication. When specialized to quadratic Gaussian communication case, transmitting Gaussian sources with Gaussian <b>common</b> <b>part</b> over Gaussian MAC, the inner bound and outer bound {{are used to}} generate two new bounds. Numerical result shows that <b>common</b> <b>part</b> improves the distortion of such distributed source-channel coding problem. Comment: Presented at Allerton Conference 201...|$|R

25|$|After {{the success}} of the EMB 110 Bandeirante, Embraer began the {{development}} of their first transport category airliner in 1974. The Family 12X comprised three models with modular concept designs: EMB 120 Araguaia, EMB 123 Tapajós and EMB 121 Xingu. EMB 121 was the sole 12X model effectively produced. Araguaia's name was changed to Brasilia in 1979 at the official launching of the project, when at a CAAA (Commuter Airline Association of America) convention at USA several suggestions from prospective operators were collected and incorporated to EMB 120 design. Thus, a completely new aircraft – no longer related to the 12X family – was launched. No <b>common</b> <b>parts</b> from EMB 121 Xingu were used, and the capacity was revised from 24 to 30 seats. Originally designed to utilise the new 1500 shp Pratt & Whitney Canada PW115 turboprop, it was later upgraded to the 1892 eshp PW118.|$|E

500|$|Through its {{treatment}} of locative technology, the novel revisits notions of virtual reality and cyberspace prominent in Gibson's early cyberpunk fiction. One character proposes that cyberspace is everting; becoming an integral and indistinguishable element {{of the physical world}} rather than a domain to be visited. During the book tour for the novel, Gibson elaborated on this theme, proposing that the ubiquity of connectivity meant that what had been called [...] "cyberspace" [...] is no longer a discrete sphere of activity separate from and secondary to normal human activity, but that those increasingly less <b>common</b> <b>parts</b> of normal life free from connectivity were the exception. [...] "If the book has a point to make where we are now with cyberspace", he commented, it was that cyberspace [...] "has colonized our everyday life and continues to colonize everyday life." ...|$|E
40|$|Different sensors or estimators {{may have}} {{different}} capability to provide data. Some sensors can provide a relatively higher dimensional data, while other sensors can only provide part of them. Some estimators can estimate full dimensional quantity of interest, while others may only estimate part of it due to some constraints. How is such kind of data with different dimensions fused? How do the <b>common</b> <b>part</b> and the uncommon part affect each other during fusion? To answer these questions, a fusion algorithm based on linear minimum mean-square error (LMMSE) estimation is provided in this paper. Then the fusion performance is analyzed, which is the main contribution of this work. The conclusions are as follows. First, the fused <b>common</b> <b>part</b> is not affected by the uncommon part. Second, the fused uncommon part {{will benefit from the}} <b>common</b> <b>part</b> through the cross-correlation. Finally, under certain conditions, both the more accurate <b>common</b> <b>part</b> and the stronger correlation can result in more accurate fused uncommon part. The conclusions are all supported by some tracking application examples...|$|R
40|$|This {{case study}} aims to study {{parts of speech}} used in online Thai food recipes from an online cooking website and to examine which parts of speech are {{frequently}} used in an online cooking website. The material {{in this study was}} 40 Thai food recipes that are selected and analyzed from one online Thai food recipes website. The instrument was a checklist which determines and categorizes parts of speech as nouns, verbs, adverbs, adjectives, pronouns, conjunctions, prepositions and determiners.

The result of the study shows that nouns are the most <b>common</b> <b>part</b> of speech used in an online recipe writing (59 %) while pronouns are the least <b>common</b> <b>part</b> of speech found from the study (0 %).

[...] Although a relatively low-production model, the Marlin is a derivative of AMC's higher-volume models so it shares many <b>common</b> <b>parts.</b> Vehicles in various stages of appearance and mechanical condition can be found for sale.

2500|$|According to Jeep's chief engineer, Roy Lunn, [...] "unlike most engines {{available}} today [...] {{was not designed}} for passenger cars and then adapted for trucks. We specifically developed it with our Jeep vehicles and Eagle in mind. That's the reason that performance and durability were of such prime consideration from the very beginning." [...] Although some of components were interchangeable between the AMC 258 cubic inch six-cylinder and the new engine, the four-cylinder was not a cut down version of the big six. Noted Roy Lunn, [...] "There are some <b>common</b> <b>parts,</b> but the 4-cylinder includes many unique items such as its own electronics systems. It also has a shorter stroke and larger bore. The valves are larger and the pistons are new." [...] Roy Lunn recalled: [...] "We wanted as much displacement - for power and torque - as possible {{within the confines of}} bore centers of the tooling. The only parameter we could influence substantially was stroke. So we picked the largest bore and stroke in order to get 2.5 Liters." ...|$|E
2500|$|The mid-sixties {{automobile}} {{market in}} the U.S. was marked an increasing influence of younger buyers who wanted a sporty image. Most of the [...] "sportiness" [...] of these was due to effective marketing. No longer satisfied with [...] "standard" [...] cars the market moved into new segments that included pony cars, muscle cars, and personal luxury cars. Many were heavily restyled derivatives of volume models and shared <b>common</b> <b>parts.</b> Moreover, they were image builders and big profit generators for their automakers. The objective of the Marlin was to move AMC in this direction. However, the AMC [...] "had an established image as {{an expert in the}} small-car field", and thus faced problems in marketing the Marlin as a sporty big car. Moreover, [...] "the Marlin actually represented a double leap" [...] for AMC: into performance, as well as personalization. The model had a good start, but sales quickly bottomed out in the 1967 model year. The automaker's anti-racing philosophy turned around after $40 million (US$ in dollars) was spent to develop a new V8 engine family and AMC turned to [...] "competitive events as a means of knocking down its avidly gathered reputation for economy." ...|$|E
