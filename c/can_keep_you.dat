500|$|Craig Delancey, an Assistant Professor of Philosophy at the State University of New York, {{cited the}} {{conclusion}} of [...] "Acrobat" [...] {{as an example of}} how rock music can be [...] "profoundly successful at evoking the mixture of anger and contempt that <b>can</b> <b>keep</b> <b>you</b> going in the face of seemingly overwhelming opposition." [...] He noted that [...] "the powerful closing sentiments of Achtung Babys 'Acrobat' can help us feel motivated and empowered in the face of powers that want us to feel powerless." [...] Timothy Cleveland, the Head of the Philosophy Department at New Mexico State University, wrote that the opening lyric was an introspection of the self. He noted [...] "here feeling is contrasted with perceptual states that make one aware of the world around them. The 'enemy' that one can feel is oneself. 'To feel' in this case refers to a kind of awareness one has of oneself independent of the sensations of the outside world... Like perceptual feeling it is a kind of direct awareness and so a kind of knowledge by acquaintance." ...|$|E
500|$|Game Informers Andrew Reiner {{cited the}} example of coin {{redistribution}} in the game, which meant that [...] "You could win every minigame and collect the most coins but still end up in last place", when giving a second opinion of the game. While acknowledging issues relating to the waiting times during board games, IGN's Peer Schneider praised this installment for relieving the problem slightly, specifically referring to the Mini Bowsers, who all take their turns {{at the same time}} in [...] "Story" [...] mode. The quantity and accessibility of the minigames was lauded by GameSpot, although the reviewer Ryan Davis proceeded to note [...] "If you bought Mario Party 4 last year, Mario Party 5 is hard to recommend.", noting a lack of change to the series formula. Generally, critics cited having a fun experience in Mario Party 5, although the minigames received a more enthusiastic reaction than the actual board game, with GameSpy commenting that [...] "the sheer volume <b>can</b> <b>keep</b> <b>you</b> compelled. If only you didn't have to deal with all that BS in-between" [...] when referring to gameplay of the actual board game.|$|E
500|$|Rimsky-Korsakoffee has {{received}} a generally positive reception and is known mostly for its desserts and for offering a unique experience to guests. After noting its status {{as one of the}} oldest coffeehouses in Portland, Fodor's said in a Pacific Northwest guide that it remains [...] "one of the best", specifically complimenting the desserts. In her travelogues of Portland, Rachel Dresbeck noted the coffeehouse's uniqueness and recommended the mocha fudge cake and the ice cream desserts known as [...] "Rasputin's Vice" [...] and [...] "Tsar Sulton Suite". Similarly, Portland Examiner contributor Dominique Dobson called the coffeehouse [...] "whimsical" [...] and wrote, [...] "this is a great evening stopoff for caffeine and dessert. It can sometimes be a bit crowded, but the mocha fudge cake is phenomenal with coffee, and the quirky clientele and (sometimes live) music <b>can</b> <b>keep</b> <b>you</b> lingering over that amazing cheesecake!" [...] In his 2010 Frommer's guide titled Portable Portland, Karl Samson noted the coffeehouse's loyal patrons, calling it [...] "Portland's favorite dessert hangout for more than 25 years." [...] Julian Smith wrote in a 2012 Frommer's guide, Portland Day by Day, that Rimsky-Korsakoffee is the [...] "most atmospheric" [...] of the city's coffee establishments, with [...] "fun and sassy" [...] waiters, desserts [...] "to die for" [...] and bathrooms [...] "you have to see to believe". Ari Shapiro, a journalist and White House correspondent for NPR who has performed with the band Pink Martini, was raised in Portland and worked at Rimsky-Korsakoffee.|$|E

500|$|In {{a conference}} call with Billboard, Carey {{revealed}} that she wrote [...] "Triumphant (Get 'Em)" [...] while her husband, Nick Cannon, was hospitalized receiving medical treatment for mild kidney failure, saying [...] "There's a lot of things you can take from there that <b>can</b> <b>keep</b> <b>you</b> going in a tough situation." [...] Carey also added that the song was written around the time her friend, singer Whitney Houston, had died. [...] "'We were actually in the hospital together when we saw it on TV.' It was important for me to write something that would...help me get through the moment. That’s where ‘Stay triumphant, keep on living’ came from." [...] Carey also expressed why she chosen Ross and Mill, or any hip-hop artist in general on the track, claiming that they are [...] "different" [...] and how she is always experimenting on collaborations with varying and new artists. When asked why she chose not to release a lead single which was dance influenced, Carey explained how she felt regarding the current music scene; [...] "I think it would be incredible if we could bring back the days when R records didn't have to cross over but be massive hits on their own," [...] and that was the reason why {{she did not want to}} conform to what is currently on trend. Additionally, she felt that [...] "Triumphant (Get 'Em)", potentially, would be able to generate cross-appeal, and not only cater Mainstream Top 40. With specific emphasis on the dance music scene and its popularity, Carey stated that while she was pregnant, the vast majority of music that was being released was dance and electronic music, saying [...] "I was pregnant forever, and I was being tortured day and night by techno music. I was complaining to everyone who was listening. One time I made dinner for L.A. Reid, and we were both sitting there like 'What happened? It saddened Carey that R and hip-hop music was being [...] "bowled over" [...] by dance music, and therefore wanted to remain true to herself by making traditional R music: ...|$|E
