The front room is used as a waiting area for visitors while Archie informs Wolfe of their arrival, and also as a place for Archie to hide one visitor from another.|$|E

50|$|Before {{starting}} work {{each morning}} he sings to {{a statue of}} god Gu. He is noted for his work using scrap metals, including the rims of wheels and bicycle <b>chains,</b> <b>bolts</b> and springs, which he uses mainly to make metal works of Voodoo gods.|$|R

50|$|This giant {{variation}} in cost has two main reasons: relative {{wealth of the}} consumers purchasing the bikes, and the difference in production quality. In the United States, all parts incorporated into the bike are high-end, similar to the parts used in professional carbon fibre bikes. The machines used to laminate, waterproof, and join the individual bamboo bikes are state-of-the-art. The Ghanaian bikes, on the other hand, are literally joined together by warming various glues over fires, while sourcing many of the additional parts (e.g. <b>chains,</b> <b>bolts,</b> etc.) from either low-cost Chinese-made parts or local markets.|$|R

60|$|But {{just then}} I heard the harsh music of rusty <b>chains</b> and <b>bolts,</b> a light flashed in my eyes, and that butterfly, Clarence, stood before me! I gasped with surprise; my breath almost {{got away from}} me.|$|R
60|$|Duncombe unfastened the <b>chain</b> and <b>bolts</b> of the {{ponderous}} front door, {{and looked}} out into the darkness. A carriage and pair of horses were drawn up outside. A man and a woman, both dressed in long travelling-coats, were standing upon the door-step.|$|R
50|$|The {{speedometer}} drive mechanism operated {{from the rear}} wheel, with a long cable to the speedometer. This drive mechanism wore out very quickly, as did any replacement, leading to no speedometer reading (never resolved). The early tachometer drive jutted from {{the right side of}} the engine, and was vulnerable to being struck and snapped off (relocated to front of engine). The primary <b>chain</b> tensioning <b>bolt</b> tended to loosen at inconvenient times. The rear <b>chain</b> adjusting <b>bolts</b> pushed, rather than pulled, the rear axle, and would bend, making them difficult to turn. Nor were there index marks to allow equal axle positioning on the right and left side of the swing arm. The ignition switch mount would break from vibration (later relocated).|$|R

5000|$|The Nails and Bolts Plant (Uzina e GozhdÃ«-Bulonave) {{was inaugurated}} on November 28, 1963. Using Chinese technology, the plant {{produced}} nails, bolts and screws.

60|$|One morning, {{shortly after}} sunrise, Mark {{was awakened by}} the {{entrance}} of their jailor. By that time he had grown so accustomed to clanking <b>chains,</b> shooting <b>bolts,</b> and such-like sounds, that he looked up sleepily and without much interest, but a thrill or qualm passed through him when he observed that the jailor was followed by Hater of Lies with his silver spear.|$|R
60|$|The {{sound of}} the knocker had {{scarcely}} ceased to echo when I heard the shuffling of feet within, {{and the sound of}} <b>chains</b> and <b>bolts</b> being withdrawn. The door opened. A man stood before me holding a lighted candle which he shaded with his hand. His faded black clothes, once apparently a butler's dress, his white hair and advanced age left me in no doubt that he was Horrod of whom Sir Jeremy had spoken.|$|R
60|$|Steele, {{without more}} ado, shoved his jailer and guard inside his jail, {{deliberately}} closed, barred and <b>chained</b> the iron <b>bolted</b> door, {{and put the}} key in his pocket. Then he remained there all day without giving heed to his prisoners' threats.|$|R
50|$|A bolt cutter, {{sometimes}} called bolt cropper, {{is a tool}} used for cutting <b>chains,</b> padlocks, <b>bolts</b> and wire mesh. The original use for bolt cutters was, as the name suggests, to cut bolt seals from shipping containers at the delivery point. It typically has long handles and short blades, with compound hinges to maximize leverage and cutting force. A typical bolt cutter yields 20 kN of cutting force for a 250 N force on the handles.|$|R
50|$|The changes {{extended}} to the engine where Honda's late 1970s issues with cam chains were dealt with via the introduction of an automatic tensioner replacing the manual version on the earlier models. Other changes also meant that the standard valve clearances were reduced, possibly through tighter manufacturing control. Sports model engines are identifiable via {{the lack of a}} cam <b>chain</b> tensioner <b>bolt</b> and the revised valve covers which feature black painted stripes and satin alloy flat areas.|$|R
60|$|In a {{few minutes}} more he had reached the main door of the mansion, and {{withdrawing}} the <b>chain</b> and <b>bolt,</b> stood in the open air. It was a bright moonlight night. He struck slowly across the open grounds towards the sunken fields beyond. When-midway across the grounds, he turned towards the mansion, and saw three of the front windows filled with white faces, gazing in terror at the wonderful spectre. Soon descending a slope, he disappeared from their view.|$|R
6000|$|Next morning, at {{an unusually}} early hour, the <b>chains</b> and <b>bolts</b> {{of the cell}} were heard to clash and groan, and Damian was startled from a broken sleep, which he had not enjoyed for above two hours. His eyes were bent on the slowly opening door, {{as if he had}} {{expected}} the headsman and his assistants; but the jailer ushered in a stout man in a pilgrim's habit. [...] "Is it a priest whom you bring me, warden?" [...] said the unhappy prisoner.|$|R
60|$|Like all Mr. Pickwick's determinations, {{this was}} the best that could be made under the circumstances; but, unfortunately, it was founded upon the {{assumption}} that they would not venture to open the door again. What was his discomfiture, when he heard the <b>chain</b> and <b>bolts</b> withdrawn, and saw the door slowly opening, wider and wider! He retreated into the corner, step by step; but do what he would, the interposition of his own person, prevented its being opened to its utmost width.|$|R
40|$|Issue: One of {{the most}} common {{contaminants}} of recovered wood waste supplies is ferrous metal. One can find ferrous metal within crates, pallets, construction and demolition debris as nails, screws, staples and other hardware. Larger pieces such as scrap metal can also be found within the wood waste supply. Other sources of metal contaminant include damaged parts from the processing equipment (for example, sections of <b>chain,</b> <b>bolts,</b> and tools). Metal contaminants create problems for processing equipment. For example, chippers are sensitive to even the smallest pieces of metal. Even the sturdiest hog can receive serious damage from a piece of metal. Most importantly, to safeguard against damage to the equipment, detect ferrous metals at the in-feed of certain critical pieces of process equipment, like sizereduction equipment. Best Practice: This Best Practice recommends wood waste processors install a metal detection system upstream of sensitive or critical process equipment. Generally, metal detection equipment is installed in a conveyor system. The basic equipment consists of a section of metal free conveyor trough, usually fiberglass, that contains a metal detecting coil. The detector is activated by the presence of magnetic or non-magnetic metal in the material flow. Any metal passing over the coil produces an electronic signal that activates an alarm system. The alarm usually sets off a warnin...|$|R

60|$|The {{captain had}} {{expected}} to interview Semmel once more, but found the fellow so surly he gave up the attempt. As the brig was so hot and uncomfortable, {{the master of the}} schooner had the door fixed so it could be left open several inches, with a <b>chain</b> at the <b>bolt</b> to keep it from going further.|$|R
500|$|The Admiralty {{division}} {{housed a}} few prisoners under naval courts-martial for mutiny, desertion, piracy, {{and what the}} deputy marshal in 1815 preferred to call [...] "unnatural crimes". Unlike {{other parts of the}} prison that had been built from scratch in 1811, the Admiralty divisionâas well as the northern boundary wall, the dayroom and the chapelâhad been part of the old Borough gaol and were considerably run down. The cells were so rotten they were barely able to confine the prisoners; in 1817 one actually broke through his cell walls. The low boundary wall meant that Admiralty prisoners were often <b>chained</b> to <b>bolts</b> fixed to the floor in the infirmary.|$|R
5000|$|On August 9, 1864, a {{tremendous}} explosion shook the city. General Grant reported, [...] "Every {{part of the}} yard used as my headquarters is filled with splinters and fragments of shell," [...] and a staff officer wrote, [...] "Such a rain of shot, shell, bullets, pieces of wood, iron bars and <b>bolts,</b> <b>chains</b> and missiles of every kind was never before witnessed." ...|$|R
50|$|The Coin Shooting Pistol that fired American five cent pieces was {{designed}} for the Carnival trade and Amusement Parks. They were sold in sets of four with <b>chains</b> and eye <b>bolts</b> to attach to stall counters. When first introduced the operator was expected to set up prizes on boards/stands. Contestants were expected to knock the prize off to win. Tarpaulins behind the prizes would catch the booth operators earnings.|$|R
50|$|Track {{construction}} and assembly is {{dictated by the}} application. Military vehicles use a track shoe that is integral {{to the structure of}} the chain in order to reduce track weight. Reduced weight allows the vehicle to move faster and decreases overall vehicle weight to ease transportation. Since track weight is completely unsprung, reducing it improves suspension performance at speeds where the track's momentum is significant. In contrast, agricultural and construction vehicles opt for a track with shoes that attach to the <b>chain</b> with <b>bolts</b> and do not form part of the chain's structure. This allows track shoes to break without compromising the ability of the vehicle to move and decrease productivity but increases the overall weight of the track and vehicle.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the year}} that {{followed}} the fire, Massachusetts and other states enacted laws for public establishments banning flammable decorations, inward-swinging exit doors, and requiring exit signs to be visible at all times (meaning that the exit signs had to have independent sources of electricity, and be easily readable in even the thickest smoke). The new laws also required that revolving doors used for egress must either be flanked {{by at least one}} normal, outward-swinging door, or retrofitted to permit the individual door leaves to fold flat to permit free-flowing traffic in a panic situation, and further required that no emergency exits be <b>chained</b> or <b>bolted</b> shut {{in such a way as}} to bar escape through the doors during a panic or emergency situation. Municipal licensing authorities ruled that no Boston establishment could use [...] "The Cocoanut Grove" [...] as a name thereafter.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{will tell}} you, sir, exactly," [...] he said; [...] "I have {{no wish to}} conceal anything. I have long wanted to have an {{opportunity}} to inform occupants of houses, especially those in the suburbs, of the insufficiency of their window fastenings. Familiar with mechanic devices as I am, and accustomed to think of such things, the precautions of householders sometimes move me to laughter. Your outer doors, front and back, are of heavy wood, <b>chained,</b> locked, and <b>bolted,</b> often double locked and bolted; but your lower windows are closed in the first place by the lightest kind of shutters, which are very seldom fastened at all, and in the second place by a little contrivance connecting the two sashes, which is held in place by a couple of baby screws. If these contrivances are of the best kind and cannot be opened from the outside with a knife-blade or piece of tin, the burglar puts a chisel or jimmy under the lower sash and gently presses it upward, when the baby screws come out as easily as if they were babies' milk-teeth. Not for a moment does the burglar trouble himself about the front door, with its locks and <b>chains</b> and <b>bolts.</b> He goes to the window, with its baby screws, which might as well be left open as shut, for all the hindrance it is to his entrance; and if he meddled with the door at all, it is simply to open it from the inside, so that when he is ready to depart he may do so easily." ...|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Viola was an Italian, too, {{a native}} of Spezzia, and though {{considerably}} younger than her husband, already middle-aged. She had a handsome face, whose complexion had turned yellow because the climate of Sulaco did not suit her at all. Her voice was a rich contralto. When, with her arms folded tight under her ample bosom, she scolded the squat, thick-legged China girls handling linen, plucking fowls, pounding corn in wooden mortars amongst the mud outbuildings {{at the back of}} the house, she could bring out such an impassioned, vibrating, sepulchral note that the <b>chained</b> watch-dog <b>bolted</b> into his kennel with a great rattle. Luis, a cinnamon-coloured mulatto with a sprouting moustache and thick, dark lips, would stop sweeping the cafe with a broom of palm-leaves to let a gentle shudder run down his spine. His languishing almond eyes would remain closed for a long time.|$|R
60|$|The {{door was}} {{fastened}} by a catch and a latch with an inside key, to which at night a <b>chain</b> and two <b>bolts</b> were added. Carefully abstaining from thrusting against each other, Ann Veronica {{and her father}} began an absurdly desperate struggle, the one to open the door, the other to keep it fastened. She seized the key, and he grasped her hand and squeezed it roughly and painfully between the handle and the ward {{as she tried to}} turn it. His grip twisted her wrist. She cried out with the pain of it.|$|R
60|$|Bertram {{came out}} of the carriage, and, {{collared}} by the constable as he put his foot on the ground, was dragged, though he offered no resistance, across the threshold, amid the continued shouts of the little sansculottes, who looked on at such distance as their fear of Mrs. Mac-Guffog permitted. The instant his foot had crossed the fatal porch, the portress again dropped her <b>chains,</b> drew her <b>bolts,</b> and, turning with both hands an immense key, took it from the lock and thrust it into a huge side-pocket of red cloth.|$|R
