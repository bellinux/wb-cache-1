5|$|The <b>choice</b> <b>of</b> <b>Law</b> {{marked the}} start of a new chapter for Smuts. The {{preceding}} years at Stellenbosch had been ones of tremendous intellectual development. From the narrow focus of his upbringing, his outlook had now expanded, awakening within him a consciousness of the breadth of knowledge now open before him. Smuts, though remaining an adherent of the Church, and respectful of the Bible and its teachings, had developed a more questioning and critical outlook during the course of his studies. Whereas at the outset of his university career he was content to follow his parents' wishes and be ordained into the Church, as his time at Victoria College came to an end he found himself more and more unwilling to commit to this path. Though he had now as yet wholly rejected the idea of ordination, he wished for a period of more diversified study before making that decision. So it was that Smuts came to select Law, rather than Divinity or Philosophy - the logical choices for a future Minister of Religion.|$|E

40|$|Applicable Law in International Commercial Arbitration (Abstract) The aim of {{this thesis}} is to analyse the <b>choice</b> <b>of</b> {{applicable}} <b>law</b> in the international commercial arbitration from three perspectives: applicable <b>law</b> <b>of</b> an underlying agreement, applicable <b>law</b> <b>of</b> an agreement to arbitrate, and applicable <b>law</b> <b>of</b> procedural aspects of arbitration proceedings (lex arbitri, arbitrability). Furthemore, the thesis is alco focused on elements related to the <b>choice</b> <b>of</b> applicable <b>law,</b> for instance the principle of party autonomy and limits <b>of</b> the <b>choice</b> <b>of</b> applicable <b>law.</b> To answer the main three above-mentioned questions regarding applicable law, comparative method is used and subsequently number of foreign legal regulations on arbitral proceedings as well as arbitral awards and relevant case law are analyzed. Theoretical approaches to the <b>choice</b> <b>of</b> applicable <b>law</b> are therefore confronted with their potential application and modifications in practice...|$|R
25|$|If a {{different}} {{result would be}} achieved depending on which of several possibly relevant laws is applied, characterisation reveals the relevant rule for the <b>choice</b> <b>of</b> <b>law,</b> {{but it is not}} necessarily a simple process (see the incidental question).|$|E
25|$|In the US, the New York Court of Appeals set a {{national}} trend in Babcock v. Jackson, 240 N.E.2d 279 (N.Y. 1963), which abandoned the {{lex loci delicti}} rule completely. Most jurisdictions have not been so radical and preferred to retain the framework of categories and <b>choice</b> <b>of</b> <b>law</b> rules but left public policy in place, as an avoidance device.|$|E
25|$|Likewise, for {{litigation}} {{of commercial}} disputes {{arising out of}} unpredictable torts (as opposed to the prospective <b>choice</b> <b>of</b> <b>law</b> clauses in contracts discussed in the previous paragraph), certain jurisdictions attract an unusually high fraction of cases, because of the predictability afforded by the depth of decided cases. For example, London is considered the pre-eminent centre for litigation of admiralty cases.|$|E

Awarded {{the first}} edition (for year 2012) <b>of</b> the European <b>Law</b> Faculties Association (ELFA) prize for {{outstanding}} Doctoral Thesis on European Law, on 16 May 2013 at the Council of Europe in Strasbourg. Abuses <b>of</b> Union <b>law</b> {{can be defined as}} undesirable <b>choices</b> <b>of</b> <b>law</b> made by Union citizens. The treatment <b>of</b> <b>choices</b> <b>of</b> <b>law</b> by Union citizens has proved inconsistent under Union law, being alternatively endorsed (Centros) or sanctioned (Cadbury Schweppes) by Union institutions. This inconsistent treatment <b>of</b> <b>choices</b> <b>of</b> <b>law</b> is a manifestation of a broader dialectic between two conceptions of economic integration, designated as the paradigms of Regulatory Neutrality and Regulatory Competition. If economic integration is conceived as competition among Member States (Regulatory Competition), artificial <b>choices</b> <b>of</b> <b>law</b> ought to be endorsed as a legitimate process of regulatory arbitrage, by which Union citizens elect their favourite national law. Conversely, if the objective of economic integration is to avoid the competition among private businesses being distorted by national laws (Regulatory Neutrality), artificial <b>choices</b> <b>of</b> <b>law</b> ought to be sanctioned as abuses <b>of</b> <b>law.</b> Accordingly, ‘regulatory arbitrage’ and ‘abuse of law’ are two masks covering one phenomenon: the election of a more favourable national law by Union citizens. More generally, this dialectic between two conceptions of economic integration pervades our perception of the internal market, and therefore accounts for long-established contradictions <b>of</b> internal market <b>law.</b> Social dumping and reverse discriminations distort the competition among private businesses, but represent the ordinary functioning of the competition among Member States. Union harmonisation is desirable under Regulatory Neutrality, whereas Regulatory Competition requires regulatory diversity. In the context of the freedoms of movement, Regulatory Neutrality promotes Host equality (equal treatment of migrant citizens with Host society), while Regulatory Competition endorses Home equality (equal treatment with Home society). State aids should be prohibited under Regulatory Neutrality, but allowed under Regulatory Competition. In sum, one (internal market) law is assigned the contradictory mission of ensuring the proper functioning of two competitive processes: the competition among private businesses (Regulatory Neutrality) and among Member States (Regulatory Competition) ...|$|R

25|$|Some {{contracts}} {{are governed by}} multilateral instruments that require a non-chosen courts to dismiss cases, and require the recognition of judgements made by courts having jurisdiction based on a choice of court clause.

40|$|This paper {{attempts}} {{to show that}} the greatest impediment to a reduction in the transaction cost consists of two factors. First, the problem <b>of</b> the <b>choice</b> <b>of</b> <b>laws</b> makes contracting a hazardous enterprise for those who have an information disadvantage. Second, the reluctance of the legal profession to embrace and familiarise themselves with uniform international laws does not enhance a client’s expectation to be able to access the ‘best’ law. It is argued that the inclusion <b>of</b> international uniform <b>laws</b> such as the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods (CISG, 1980) will reduce the transactions costs either at trial or when a problem rises as both parties operate in essence under the same law and, hence, a negotiated settlement is more likely. The paper specifically addresses the problem which can emerge when a contract is silent as to which law will govern the legal relationship. Close attention is given to a possibility <b>of</b> overcoming <b>choice</b> <b>of</b> <b>laws</b> problems by applying the CISG, instead of explicitly excluding the CISG. This paper also investigates the inclusions <b>of</b> soft <b>laws</b> into contracts and the ability of such an inclusion to reduce transaction costs. The conclusion is that the inclusion <b>of</b> uniform <b>laws</b> reduces uncertainty and is, furthermore, merely recognition of a development which is gathering speed...|$|R

25|$|Characterising by {{reference}} to the lex causae, the law that is identified in the <b>choice</b> <b>of</b> <b>law</b> stage of the conflict process as the one {{to be applied to}} determine the case, would be problematic. Although it may appear logical to allow the whole of the lex causae, including its characterisation rules, to apply, it actually produces a circular argument: the lex causae is to apply to the process of characterisation before the process of characterisation has led to the choice of the relevant lex causae.|$|E
25|$|Characterisation {{is one of}} the {{key element}} in demarcating the <b>choice</b> <b>of</b> <b>law</b> and {{jurisdiction}} issues.Once the forum court decides that it has jurisdiction to hear the case, it must characterise or classify the cause(s) of action. That is regarded as the most important and difficult problem in conflict of laws as trade and travel between states have become the norm and the effects of broken promises, defective goods, traffic accidents and marital squabbles are no longer confined to the sovereign territory of one particular state or nation.|$|E
25|$|Many {{contracts}} {{and other forms}} of legally binding agreement include a jurisdiction or arbitration clause specifying the parties' choice of venue for any litigation (called a forum selection clause). Then, <b>choice</b> <b>of</b> <b>law</b> clauses may specify which laws the court or tribunal should apply to each aspect of the dispute. This matches the substantive policy of freedom of contract. Judges have accepted that the principle of party autonomy allows the parties to select the law most appropriate to their transaction. This judicial acceptance of subjective intent excludes the traditional reliance on objective connecting factors; it also harms consumers as vendors often impose one-sided contractual terms selecting a venue far from the buyer's home or workplace.|$|E

25|$|The {{court is}} {{required}} to analyse the pleadings prepared by the parties and to assign each component element to the most appropriate juridical concept or category.
