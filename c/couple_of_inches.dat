25|$|On Easy {{difficulty}} Pro mode, {{the game}} will only present single notes to the player; Medium difficulty introduces chords, while Hard difficulty is a less-dense version of the full guitar track charted for Expert mode. The game adjusts which frets are used depending on which Pro model guitar is used, because the Mustang, being only a <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>inches</b> smaller than a real guitar, has fewer frets than the Squier real guitar. Some leeway is given on Pro Guitar such as by missing a chord by one offset string.|$|E
25|$|A {{trial was}} held at the Stirling Spring Circuit Court on 19 April 1823; however, Forrest had absconded and was absent from the hearings. He was assumed to be heading for Paris whilst McNab and Mitchel were held prisoners in the Stirling Tolbooth. The court {{documents}} do not mention Shiels however. The crime had been discovered when the grave of Mary Wotherspoon, who had been buried a week before, had been observed to be a <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>inches</b> below the surface. A rope was discovered near the surface and digging down to the coffin revealed it had been broken open and the body removed, however the clothes had been thrown back inside.|$|E
25|$|In the Tour of California, Sagan won on stages one, {{which was}} a bunch sprint finish, and 4, where the finish was contested on the Mazda Raceway Laguna Seca. On stage 7, {{he was part of}} the breakaway, went solo from fifty {{kilometers}} to cover and was caught with 20 kilometers to go to the finish. He still managed a second place by a <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>inches</b> over Alexander Kristoff. On stage 8 he took another 2nd place and clinched the points classification. On his next race, the Tour de Suisse, Sagan sprinted to victory on the hilly stage 1 around Baar. It was a record-breaking 12th victory for the Slovak on the Swiss race. The very next day he won another stage after joining the late breakaway after attacking the reduced peloton at the end of a climb, and outsprinted the pair.|$|E

Hardwood hammock and cypress trees {{are susceptible to}} heavy damage from fire, and some may take decades to grow back. Peat built up over centuries in the marsh can cause fires to burn deep scars in the soil. In 2007, Fred Sklar of the South Florida Water Management District said: [...] "An extreme drought can be viewed (as) almost as catastrophic as a volcano. It can reshape the entire landscape. It can take 1,000 years to produce two inches of peat, and you can lose those <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>inches</b> in a week." ...|$|E

My leg was all twisted around and my foot was pointing in the wrong direction. It was painful. Very painful." [...] Dierdorf was carried off the field on a stretcher, underwent knee surgery, and missed the remainder of the 1979 season.|$|E

60|$|For {{several weeks}} I had been culling all the {{information}} I could about Italy, from tourists. The tourists were all agreed upon one thing--one must expect to be cheated at every turn by the Italians. I took an evening walk in Turin, and presently came across a little Punch and Judy show {{in one of the}} great squares. Twelve or fifteen people constituted the audience. This miniature theater was not much bigger than a man's coffin stood on end; the upper part was open and displayed a tinseled parlor--a good-sized handkerchief would have answered for a drop-curtain; the footlights consisted <b>of</b> a <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> candle-ends an <b>inch</b> long; various manikins the size of dolls appeared on the stage and made long speeches at each other, gesticulating a good deal, and they generally had a fight before they got through. They were worked by strings from above, and the illusion was not perfect, for one saw not only the strings but the brawny hand that manipulated them--and the actors and actresses all talked in the same voice, too. The audience {{stood in front of the}} theater, and seemed to enjoy the performance heartily.|$|R

2500|$|Snails can be bred {{in boxes}} or cages stacked several units high. An {{automatic}} sprinkler {{system can be}} used to provide moisture. Breeding cages need a feed trough and a water trough. Plastic trays a <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>inches</b> deep are adequate; deeper water troughs increase the chance of snails drowning in them. Trays can be set on a bed of small gravel. Small plastic pots, e.g., flower pots about 3inches deep, can be filled with sterilized dirt (or a loamy pH neutral soil) and set in the gravel to give the snails a place to lay their eggs. After the snails lay eggs each pot is replaced. (Set one pot inside another so that one can be easily lifted without shifting the gravel.) ...|$|E
2500|$|A simple panel {{resonator}} {{can be built}} to hang on a wall by building a wooden frame, adding a <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>inches</b> of mineral wool to the inside and adding a sheet of plywood over the top attached only at the edges. [...] A small gap should be left between the panel and the acoustic insulation so that the panel is free to resonate. Panel resonance can be enhanced by reducing the point of connection between the panel and the frame by means of narrow spacer material such as a loop of wire or welding rod run {{along the edge of}} the frame so that the panel is perched on a thin edge.

2500|$|A six-foot five-inch [...] "Blond Giant", Rorke was {{the fastest}} Australian bowler and accused of {{throwing}} by the English press, but this paled beside his excessive dragging. With his gigantic seven-foot stride and dragging his rear foot a yard over the crease {{he could be}} only eighteen yards from the batsman when he finally delivered the ball and at times seemed impossible to score from. Fred Trueman was no balled for dragging his foot a <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>inches</b> over the crease and wrote [...] "It was really annoying as this umpire seemed to allow Gordon Rorke to bowl with both his feet over the front line!". One picture showed him with his rear foot past the bowling crease before he had even begun to drag. Colin Cowdrey joked [...] "I was frightened that he might tread on my toes".|$|E

2500|$|Shipman {{said that}} after arriving, {{she was aware of}} someone {{following}} her to an airport satellite parking area. When she got into her car, she heard running footsteps and quickly locked the door. Nowak slapped the window and tried to open the car door, asked for a ride, then started crying. Shipman rolled down the window a <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>inches</b> after which Nowak sprayed the pepper spray into the car. Shipman drove off to the parking lot booth where police were summoned. Several Orlando Police Department Airport Division officers arrived minutes later, with the first officer observing Nowak throwing a bag into the trash at a parking shuttle bus stop. Nowak was subsequently arrested at Orlando International Airport on charges of attempted kidnapping, battery, attempted vehicle burglary with battery, and destruction of evidence. In a handwritten request for a restraining order against Nowak after her arrest, Shipman referred to Nowak as an acquaintance of a boyfriend but did not identify Oefelein, and also claimed Nowak had been stalking her for two months. Nowak told investigators she was involved in a relationship with Oefelein which she described as being [...] "more than a working relationship but less than a romantic relationship". Citing evidence of elaborate planning, disguises and weapons, police recommended she be held without bail.|$|E
2500|$|England won the toss {{and decided}} to bat. Flintoff handed Sajid Mahmood his first Test cap, while Chamara Kapugedera made his Test debut for Sri Lanka. Marcus Trescothick opened for England {{for the first time}} since last year, {{alongside}} Andrew Strauss. 20 minutes before lunch Muttiah Muralitharan was brought in for his first over at Lord's, the 23rd of the England innings, with the seamers not having taken a wicket. However, in the fourth over of Muralitharan's innings Jayawardene had Strauss caught off Muralitharan, putting the English at 86 for one at lunch. The afternoon session started with Alastair Cook, playing in his first home Test, coming in to face his first ball in home Test cricket; after leaving that one alone, he proceeded to 44 not out by tea, while Trescothick was on 95 not out. Trescothick got his hundred by [...] "slogging" [...] Muralitharan for a single, but in the next over he, too, perished through being caught by Jayawardene. England batted through to stumps and lost only one further wicket, with Cook caught behind off Farveez Maharoof's bowling for 89, and England closed with nightwatchman Matthew Hoggard at the crease and the overnight total 318 for three. Sri Lanka, however, had taken a catch off a no-ball, a close lbw against Kevin Pietersen turned down off Chaminda Vaas, and Alastair Cook a <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>inches</b> from being run out.|$|E
