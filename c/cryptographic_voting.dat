This, and other early <b>cryptographic</b> <b>voting</b> systems, assumed that voters could reliably compute values with their personal computers.

40|$|We {{construct}} a universally verifiable, <b>cryptographic</b> <b>vote</b> casting protocol that enables each voter to determine with high certainty via a receipt that her choices (intended votes) have been accurately {{represented in the}} input to a public tally. However, since the receipt, in isolation, can represent a choice for any candidate with equal probability, it does not enable vote buying or coercion. The key to making this possible is that the totality of information that the voter uses to convince herself of encrypted ballot integrity includes temporal information that is only {{available at the time}} the ballot is cast. We assume that, as with conventional voting systems, the act of casting takes place in a private environment – i. e. the “poll booth. ” Under this assumption then, the scheme, in conjunction with a universally verifiable tabulation protocol, provides an end-to-end verifiable, secret vote receipt based election protocol that is coercion free. Intrinsically, the protocol is unconditionally secure, although for the sake of usability, the commitment of data is likely to be implemented via a secure oneway hash. The security of such an implementation would then depend on the one-way property of the hash function employed. The scheme requires no more computation or data processing from the voter than is performed by a bank customer at a typical ATM. Thus, it is very practical...|$|R

40|$|Democracy {{depends on}} the proper {{administration}} of popular elections. Voters should receive assurance that their intent was correctly captured and that all eligible votes were correctly tallied. The election {{system as a whole}} should ensure that voter coercion is unlikely, even when voters are willing to be influenced. These conflicting requirements present a significant challenge: how can voters receive enough assurance to trust the election result, but not so much that they can prove to a potential coercer how they voted? This dissertation explores cryptographic techniques for implementing verifiable, secretballot elections. We present the power of <b>cryptographic</b> <b>voting,</b> in particular its ability to successfully achieve both verifiability and ballot secrecy, a combination that cannot be achieved by other means.

40|$|Abstract. We present Selections, a new <b>cryptographic</b> <b>voting</b> {{protocol}} that is end-to-end verifiable {{and suitable}} for Internet voting. After a one-time in-person registration, voters can cast ballots in an arbitrary number of elections. We say a system provides over-the-shoulder coercionresistance if a voter can undetectably avoid complying with an adversary that is present during the vote casting process. Our {{system is the}} first in the literature to offer this property without the voter having to anticipate coercion and precompute values. Instead, a voter can employ a panic password. We prove that Selections is coercion-resistant against a non-adaptive adversary. 1 Introductory Remarks From a security perspective, the use of electronic voting machines in elections around the world continues to be concerning.

To provide voting systems with more transparency and accountability throughout the process while preserving privacy which allows voters to express their true intent. Helios Voting {{is one of these}} systems [...] -an online platform where anyone can easily host their own cryptographically end-to-end verifiable election, aiming to bring verifiable voting to the masses. Helios does this by providing explicit cryptographic checks that an election was counted correctly, checks that any member of the public can independently verify. All of this while still protecting one of the essential properties of open democracy, voter privacy. In spite of these cryptographic checks and the strong mathematical assertions of correctness they provide, this thesis discusses the discovery and exploit of three vulnerabilities. The first is the insufficient validation of cryptographic elements in Helios ballots uploaded by users. This allows a disgruntled voter to cast a carefully crafted ballot which will prevent an election from being tallied. The second vulnerability is the insufficient validation of cryptographic parameters used in ElGamal by an election official. This leads to an attack where the election official can upload weak parameters allowing the official to cast arbitrary votes in a single ballot. The final attack is a cross-site scripting attack that would allow anyone to steal or re-cast ballots on behalf of victims. We coordinated disclosure with the Helios developers and provided fixes for all the vulnerabilities outlined in the thesis. Additionally, this thesis adds to the body of work highlighting the fragility of internet voting applications and discusses the unique challenges faced by internet voting applications...|$|R
40|$|<b>Cryptographic</b> <b>voting</b> {{systems are}} trying to ensure privacy, {{security}} and ver-ifiability to the electronic voting systems. They try to guarantee these traits independent of the used software. As those protocols rely on another set of hardware, the hole system needs to be evaluated. In this paper i will discuss the schemes of Andrew Neff and David Chaum based on the paper from Karlof, Sastry and Wagner [2]. It also contains a small motivation why the DRE sys-tems are not sufficient and alternatives like <b>cryptographic</b> <b>voting</b> protocols are needed. Several weaknesses have been discovered in the analysis, most of them hard to solve. They are all induced by the underspecification of the protocols, as they have not described how the most vital parts of the protocols should be implemented, they are just described as black boxes. Karlof has hopes for the voting protocols if they specify {{the rest of the}} system, even though he does not propose the use already. In contrast to them, i highly doubt they will be capable reaching their goal of becoming a secure, software independent system. With new specifications, new problems will occur and all proposes of Karlof induced new weaknesses or a rollback to the paper based system. So in my opinion <b>cryptographic</b> <b>voting</b> protocols were aiming for a good but kind of un-reachable target and there has to be found a way to trust at least one vital part of an election to ensure security for the hole election. ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Mixnets {{are one of}} {{the main}} {{approaches}} to deploy secret and verifiable electronic elections. General-purpose verifiable mixnets however suffer from the drawback that the amount of data to be verified by observers increases linearly with the number of involved mix nodes, the number of decryptors, and the number of voters. Chase et al. proposed a verifiable mixnet at Eurocrypt 2012 based on so-called malleable proofs- proofs that do not increase with the number of mix nodes. In work published at PKC 2013, the same authors adapted malleable proofs to verifiable distributed decryption, resulting in a <b>cryptographic</b> <b>voting</b> scheme. As a result, the amount of data to be verified only increases linearly with the number of voters. However, their scheme leaves several questions open which we address in this paper: As a first contribution, we adapt a multi-party computation protocol to build a distributed key generation protocol for the encryption scheme underlying their voting scheme. As a second contribution, we decompress their abstract scheme description, identify elementary operations, and count the number of such operations required for mixing and verification. Based on timings for elementary operations, we extrapolate the running times of the mixing and verification processes, allowing us to assess the feasibility of their scheme. For the German case, we conclude that the replacement of postal voting by <b>cryptographic</b> <b>voting</b> based on malleable proofs is feasible on an electoral district level...|$|E

40|$|Voting is a {{fundamental}} decision making instrument in any consensus-based society. It is employed in various applications from student body elections, reality television shows, shareholder meetings, to national elections. With the motivation of better eciency, scalability, speed, and lower cost, voting is currently shifting from paper-based {{to the use of}} electronic medium. This is while aiming to achieve better security, such that voting result reflects true opinions of the voters. Our research focuses on the study of <b>cryptographic</b> <b>voting</b> protocols accommodating a flexible ballot structure as a foundation for building a secure electronic voting system with acceptable voting results. In particular, we search for a solution suitable for the preferential voting system employed in the Australian Federal Election. The outcomes of the research include: improvements and applications of batch proof and verication theorems and techniques, a proposed alternative homomorphic encryption based voting scheme, a proposed Extended Binary Mixing Gate (EBMG) mix-network scheme, a new threshold randomisation technique to achieve receipt-freeness property in voting, and the application of <b>cryptographic</b> <b>voting</b> protocol for preferential voting. The threats and corresponding requirements for a secure secret-ballot voting scheme are rst discussed. There are significant security concerns about the conduct of electronic voting, and it is essential that the voting results re ect the true opinions of the voters - especially in political elections. We examine and extend batch processing proofs and verifications theorems and proposed applications of the theorems useful for voting. Many instances of similar operations can be processed in a single instance using a batch technique based on one of the batch theorems. As the proofs and verications provide formal assurances that the voting process is secure, batch processing offers great efficiency improvements while retaining the security required in a real-world implementation of the protocol. The two main approaches in <b>cryptographic</b> <b>voting</b> protocols, homomorphic encryption based voting and mix-network based voting, are both studied in this research. An alternative homomorphic voting scheme using multiplicative homomorphism property, and a number of novel mix-network schemes are proposed. It is shown that compared to the mix-network approach, homomorphic encryption schemes are not scalable for straight-forward adaptation of preferential systems. One important requirement of secret-ballot voting is receipt-freeness. A randomisation technique to achieve receipt-freeness in voting is examined and applied in an ecient and practical voting scheme employing an optimistic mix-network. A more general technique using threshold randomisation is also proposed. Combination of the primitives, both the homomorphic encryption and mixnetwork approach, yields a hybrid approach producing a secure and ecient secret-ballot voting scheme accommodating a exible ballot structure. The resulting solution oers a promising foundation for secure and practical secret-ballot electronic voting accommodating any type of counting system...|$|E

40|$|One of {{the major}} {{problems}} that prevent the widespread of Internet voting is {{the vulnerability of the}} voter’s computer. A computer connected to the Internet is exposed to virus, worms, spyware, malware and other threats that can endanger the election’s integrity.

It is possible to write such a virus so that the voter would not notice anything wrong with the voting application. This attack is very dangerous because it may pass undetected. To prevent such attack it is necessary to prevent automatic vote manipulation at voter’s computer. Here we present CodeVoting, a technique to create a secure communication channel to a smart card that prevents vote manipulation by the voter’s PC, {{while at the same time}} allows the use of any <b>cryptographic</b> <b>voting</b> protocol to protect the election’s integrity at the server side of the voting application...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—There {{are many}} {{advantages}} to voting schemes in which voters rank all candidates in order, {{rather than just}} choosing their favourite. However, these schemes inherently suffer from a coercion problem when there are many candidates, because a coercer can demand a certain permutation from a voter and then check whether that permutation appears during tallying. Recently developed <b>cryptographic</b> <b>voting</b> protocols allow anyone to audit an election (universal verifiability), but existing systems are either not applicable to ranked voting at all, or reveal enough information about the ballots to make voter coercion possible. We solve this problem for the popular single transferable vote (STV) ranked voting system, by constructing an algorithm for the verifiable tallying of encrypted votes. Our construction improves upon existing work because it extends to multiple-seat STV and reveals less information than other schemes. The protocol is based on verifiable shuffling of homomorphic encryptions, a wellstudied primitive in the voting arena. Our protocol is efficient enough to be practical, even for a large election.

40|$|Abstract: Voter anonymity, {{also known}} as unlinkability, is the basic {{requirement}} {{in order to satisfy}} privacy in electronic voting (e-voting) protocols, which means that a particular vote is not linkable to any voter. In other words, the relationship between voter identity and the related cast vote should be private to that particular voter and it should not be revealed or proved in any way. Many e-voting protocols have been proposed from both theoretical and practical perspectives in the last decades. This paper focuses on the anonymity properties of some previously proposed e-voting protocols and classifies the e-voting protocols by their privacy preserving approaches as: (a) protocols based on anonymous channel, (b) protocols based on homomorphic encryption and (c) other protocols. Then, main features and characteristics of these approaches are pointed out and feasibility of performing practical and secure e-voting is discussed.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{the design of}} a novel class of pollsterless voting schemes. Many <b>cryptographic</b> <b>voting</b> schemes necessitate a pollster because the client side computations are beyond the understanding or ability of the voter. Such interactions require that the voter trust the software to perform operations on their behalf, and in effect, the pollster acts as the voter. Conversely, the pollsterless schemes presented here permit voters to interact with an election authority directly, without complex computations. Pollsterless schemes have the additional advantage of permitting voting on virtually any networked device, increasing the potential mobility of voting. The proposed pollsterless schemes are implemented and then evaluated with respect to the particular requirements of the UK public election context. The flexibility of pollsterless schemes in particular are demonstrated to fulfill the diverse requirements that may arise in this context, whilst the mobility of pollsterless schemes is demonstrated to fulfill requirements to improve the convenience of voting.
