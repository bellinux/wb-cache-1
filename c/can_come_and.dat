Kemal was noted as [...] "the most imaginative, most successful officer to fight on either side" [...] during the Gallipoli Campaign. How the Turks viewed the invasion can be judged by Kemal's orders to his troops following the initial landings; [...] "Men, I am not ordering you to attack. I am ordering you to die. In the time that it takes us to die, other forces and commanders <b>can</b> <b>come</b> <b>and</b> take our place." ...|$|E
500|$|Although {{at least}} one {{organization}} criticized the aquarium for attempting to keep white sharks in captivity, several independent shark researchers expressed approval for the logistical design and the educational impact of Project White Shark, and some scientific insights from it. On its educational impact, a white shark researcher from Australia stated in 2006 that [...] "the fact people <b>can</b> <b>come</b> <b>and</b> see these animals and learn from them is of immeasurable value." [...] The first captive white shark—on exhibit in 2004 {{for more than six}} months—was seen by one million visitors, and another million visitors saw either the second or third white sharks on display. [...] Monterey Bay Aquarium is the only public aquarium in the world to have successfully exhibited a white shark for more than 16 days.|$|E

500|$|Schwartz {{uses the}} [...] "Unlimited" [...] theme {{as the second}} major motif running through the score. Although not {{included}} as a titled song, the theme appears as an interlude {{in several of the}} musical numbers. In a tribute to Harold Arlen, who wrote the score for the 1939 film adaptation, the [...] "Unlimited" [...] melody incorporates the first seven notes of the song [...] "Over the Rainbow." [...] Schwartz included it as an inside joke as, [...] "according to copyright law, {{when you get to the}} eighth note, then people <b>can</b> <b>come</b> <b>and</b> say, 'Oh you stole our tune.' And of course obviously it's also disguised in that it's completely different rhythmically. And it's also harmonized completely differently.... It's over a different chord and so on, but still it's the first seven notes of 'Somewhere Over the Rainbow'". Schwartz further obscured the motif's origin by setting it in a minor key in most instances. This also creates contrast in the songs in which it forms a part, for example in [...] "Defying Gravity", which is written primarily in the key of D-flat major. In the song [...] "The Wicked Witch of the East", however, when Elphaba finally uses her powers to let her sister walk, the [...] "Unlimited" [...] theme is played in a major key.|$|E
500|$|On the Turkish side, by {{that night}} the 2nd Battalion 57th Infantry were on Baby 700, the 3rd Battalion, reduced to only ninety men, were at The Nek, and the 1st Battalion on Mortar Ridge. Just south {{of them was the}} 77th Infantry, next was the 27th Infantry {{opposite}} 400 Plateau. The last regiment, the 72nd Infantry, were on Battleship Hill. As for manpower, the Turks were in a similar situation to the ANZACs. Of the two regiments most heavily involved, the 57th had been destroyed, and the 27th were exhausted with heavy casualties. Large numbers of the 77th had deserted, and the regiment was in no condition to fight. The 72nd was largely intact, but they were a poorly trained force of Arab conscripts. The III Corps, having to deal with both landings, could not assist as they had no reserves available. It was not until 27 April that the 33rd and 64th Infantry Regiments arrived to reinforce the Turkish forces. The ANZACs, however, had been unable to achieve their obectives, and therefore dug in. Gallipoli, like the Western Front, turned into a war of attrition. The German commander, Liman von Saunders, was clear about the reasons for the outcome. He wrote that, [...] "on the Turkish side the situation was saved by the immediate and independent action of the 19th Division." [...] The division commander, Kemal, became noted as [...] "the most imaginative, most successful officer to fight on either side" [...] during the campaign. As a commander he was able {{to get the most out}} of his troops, typified by his order to the 57th Infantry Regiment; [...] "Men, I am not ordering you to attack. I am ordering you to die.

Ramallah Mayor Janet Mikhail announced later that Darwish would be buried next to Ramallah's Palace of Culture, at the summit of a hill overlooking Jerusalem on the southwestern outskirts of Ramallah, and a shrine would be erected in his honor.
