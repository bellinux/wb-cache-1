These tasks define the so-called three-pronged task (TT) that is of current interest, but today, {{according to the data}} available from the open press, has no satisfactory solution. This is connected with the complexity of TT and moreover a <b>covert</b> <b>communication</b> <b>channel</b> itself requires additional guaranteeing the reliability of perception and insensitivity of formed steganomessage against disturbing influences. The digital image stands as a container. The additional embedded information that is the result of pre-primary encoding of confidential information and the subsequent secondary coding using a secret key for authentication is represented as a binary sequence. Developed steganomethod for solving TT, ensures the reliability of perception of formed steganomessage, is resistant to attacks against embedded messages and allows to effectively decode the transmitted information even {{in the event of a}} breach of its integrity, that is evidenced by the results of a computational experiment...|$|E
40|$|It {{has long}} been {{believed}} that once the voice media between caller and callee is captured or sniffed from the wire, either legally by law enforcement agencies or illegally by hackers through eavesdropping on communication channels, {{it is easy to}} listen into their conversation. In this paper, we show that this common perception is not always true. Our real-world experiments demonstrate that it is feasible to create a hidden telephonic conversation within an explicit telephone call. In particular, we propose a real-time <b>covert</b> <b>communication</b> <b>channel</b> within two-way media streams established between caller and callee. The real-time covert channel is created over the media stream that may possibly be monitored by eavesdroppers. However, the properly encoded media stream acts as a cover (or decoy) carrying bogus media such as an earlier recorded voice conversation. This spurious content will be heard if the media stream is intercepted and properly decoded. However, the calling and called parties protected by the <b>covert</b> <b>communication</b> <b>channel</b> can still directly talk to each other in privacy and real-time, just like any other normal phone calls. This work provides an additional security layer against media interception attacks, however it also exposes a serious security concern to CALEA (Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act) wiretapping and its infrastructure...|$|E

40|$|Network covert {{channels}} {{have become}} a sophisticated means for transferring hidden information over the network. Covert channel-internal control protocols, also called micro protocols, have been introduced {{in the recent years}} to enhance capabilities of the network covert channels. Micro protocols are usually placed within the hidden bits of a covert channel's payload and enable features such as reliable data transfer, session management, and dynamic routing for network covert channels. These features provide adaptive and stealthy <b>covert</b> <b>communication</b> <b>channels.</b> Some of the micro protocol based tools exhibit vulnerabilities and are susceptible to attacks. In this paper, we demonstrate some possible attacks on micro protocols, which are capable of breaking the sophisticated <b>covert</b> <b>channel</b> <b>communication</b> or jeopardizing the identity of peers in such a network. These attacks are based on the attacker's interaction with the micro protocol...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Covert {{channels}} pose {{a significant}} threat for networking sys-tems. In this paper, {{we examine the}} exploitation of Session Description Protocol (SDP) information residing in Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) requests with the aim to hide data in plain sight. While a significant mass of works in the literature cope with <b>covert</b> <b>communication</b> <b>channels,</b> only a very limited number of them rely on SIP to realize its goals. Also, none of them concentrates on SDP data contained in SIP messages to imple-ment and evaluate such a hidden <b>communication</b> <b>channel.</b> Motivated by this fact, the work at hand proposes and demonstrates the feasibility of a simple but very effective in terms of stealthiness and simplicity SIP-based covert channel for botnet Command and Control (C&C).

40|$|At the {{organization}} of a <b>covert</b> <b>communication</b> <b>channel</b> a number of requirements are imposed on used steganography algorithms among {{which one of the}} main are: resistance to attacks against the built-in message, reliability of perception of formed steganography message, significant throughput of a steganography communication channel. Aim: The aim of this research is to modify the steganography method, developed by the author earlier, which will allow to increase the throughput of the corresponding <b>covert</b> <b>communication</b> <b>channel</b> when saving resistance to attacks against the built-in message and perception reliability of the created steganography message, inherent to developed method. Materials and Methods: Modifications of a steganography method that is steady against attacks against the built-in message which is carrying out the inclusion and decoding of the sent (additional) information in spatial domain of the image allowing to increase the throughput of the organized communication channel are offered. Use of spatial domain of the image allows to avoid accumulation of an additional computational error during the inclusion/decoding of additional information due to “transitions” from spatial domain of the image to the area of conversion and back that positively affects the efficiency of decoding. Such methods are considered as attacks against the built-in message: imposing of different noise on a steganography message, filtering, lossy compression of a ste-ganography message where the JPEG and JPEG 2000 formats with different quality coefficients for saving of a steganography message are used. Results: It is shown that algorithmic implementations of the offered methods modifications remain steady against the perturbing influences, including considerable, provide reliability of perception of the created steganography message, increase the throughput of the created steganography communication channel in comparison with the algorithm implementing steganography method taken as a basis. All conclusions are confirmed with results of representative computational experiments...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{presents}} a systematic {{solution to the}} problem of using ICMP tunneling for covert channel. ICMP is not multiplexed via port numbers and the data part of the ICMP packet provides considerable bandwidth for malicious covert channels. These factors make it an integral part of many malicious software like remote access and denial of service attack tools. These tools use ICMP to establish <b>covert</b> <b>communication</b> <b>channels.</b> In this paper a stateless model is proposed to prevent ICMP tunneling. A Linux kernel module was implemented to demonstrate the proposed stateless solution. The module enforces a fixed payload policy for ICMP packets and virtually eliminates ICMP tunneling which arises due to the data carrying capability of ICMP. The performance impact on end hosts and routers due to the stateless monitoring model is described. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The {{well-known}} {{formulation of}} the Prisoner’s Problem was an inspiration to the academic community {{to pay more attention}} to a large number of issues that had arisen in data hiding communication security. Most of the techniques that were implemented were based on modulating a media file to hide the information required to be transmitted. If the transmission is rather continuous in time, one may refer to the technique as a <b>covert</b> <b>communication</b> <b>channel</b> between two parties. Various methods of advanced steganalysis techniques, with varying degrees of success, were developed to detect the existence of such hidden messages in a media file. In this work, we present an alternative approach to hiding data in media files. To be more precise, we use two different DNA-based steganographic techniques where the message is embedded within a vector sequence using recombinant DNA technology or created using DNA mutagenesis technique. The proposed method has many potential unconventional applications not only in data hiding but also in massive data storage...|$|E
40|$|An {{increasing}} number of countries and companies routinely block or monitor access to parts of the Internet. To counteract these measures, we propose Infranet, a system that enables clients to surreptitiously retrieve sensitive content via cooperating Web servers distributed across the global Internet. These Infranet servers provide clients access to censored sites while continuing to host normal uncensored content. Infranet uses a tunnel protocol that provides a <b>covert</b> <b>communication</b> <b>channel</b> between its clients and servers, modulated over standard HTTP transactions that resemble innocuous Web browsing. In the upstream direction, Infranet clients send covert messages to Infranet servers by associating meaning to the sequence of HTTP requests being made. In the downstream direction, Infranet servers return content by hiding censored data in uncensored images using steganographic techniques. We describe the design, a prototype implementation, security properties, and performance of Infranet. Our security analysis shows that Infranet can successfully circumvent several sophisticated censoring techniques. ...|$|E

In covert computation, a party runs a secure computation protocol over a covert (or steganographic) channel without knowing if the other parties are participating as well or not. At {{the end of the}} protocol, if all parties participated in the protocol and if the function output is “favorable ” to all parties, then the output is revealed (along with the fact that everyone participated). All covert computation protocols known so far require a large polynomial number of rounds. In this work, we first study the question of the round complexity of covert computation and obtain the following results: • There does not exist a constant round covert computation protocol with respect to black box simulation even for the case of two parties. (In comparison, such protocols are known even for the multi-party case if there is no covertness requirement.) • By relying on the two slot non-black-box simulation technique of Pass (STOC’ 04) and techniques from cryptography in NC 0 (Applebaum et al, FOCS’ 04), we obtain a construction of a constant round covert multi-party computation protocol. Put together, the above adds one more example to the growing list of tasks for which non-black-box simulation techniques (introduced in the work of Barak in FOCS’ 01) are necessary. Finally, we study the problem of covert multi-party computation in the setting where the parties only have point to point (<b>covert)</b> <b>communication</b> <b>channels.</b> We observe that our covert computation protocol for the broadcast channel inherits, from the protocol of Pass, the property of secure composition in the bounded concurrent setting.

By differentiating the perceptual capacity and the numerical capacity of the VoIP data, DST further improves the capacity of the LACK channel over VoIP stream. At the same time, the quality of the VoIP stream is also improved with the existence of the LACK channel.|$|R

Most organizations depend on broad and heterogeneous communication networks, which provide numerous possibilities for malicious users to smuggle sensitive private information out of their boundaries. They can achieve that objective with the use of network covert channels, that apart from carrying the data outside of the organization, hide the fact that the communication is taking place. This study provides a comprehensive, up to date review of the current state of research in the field of network <b>covert</b> channels: hidden <b>communication</b> <b>channels</b> that abuse legitimate network <b>communication</b> <b>channels.</b> It also presents a novel technique to establish such channels based on the use Digital Certificates, along with an informal framework to exfiltrate data making use of the technique. It involves the use of the Transport Secure Layer protocol, a network protocol normally used to provide confidentiality and integrity services to applications. Several detection and prevention mechanisms and methodologies exist or have been proposed to counter the threats posed by this hidden <b>communication</b> <b>channels.</b> They are also identified and discussed in this work, explaining their applicability and limitations...|$|R
40|$|Abstract- Covert {{channels}} leaks information where information travels overlooked. Encryption used {{to protect}} the communication from being deciphered by unlawful users. But covert channels hide the presence of <b>communication.</b> <b>Covert</b> <b>channels</b> are serious security intimidation. There are many existing techniques available for development of covert channels by influencing certain fields in the network protocols such as HTTP, IP, TCP, etc. The available packet length based covert channels are having tamper resistance capability but due to abnormal traffic distribution results in recognition possibility. In this paper we present overview of different protocol {{as well as some}} packet length based covert channels.
