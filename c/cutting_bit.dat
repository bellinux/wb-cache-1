40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} a {{numerical}} analysis of the hard rock (ore) disintegration process. The bit moves and sinks into the hard rock (mechanical contact with friction between the ore and the <b>cutting</b> <b>bit)</b> and subsequently disintegrates it. The disintegration (i. e. the stress-strain relationship, contact forces, reaction forces and fracture of the ore) is solved via the FEM (MSC. Marc/Mentat software) and SBRA (Simulation-Based Reliability Assessment) method (Monte Carlo simulations, Anthill and Mathcad software). The ore is disintegrated by deactivating the finite elements which satisfy the fracture condition. The material of the ore (i. e. yield stress, fracture limit, Young’s modulus and Poisson’s ratio), is given by bounded histograms (i. e. stochastic inputs which better describe reality). The results (reaction forces in the <b>cutting</b> <b>bit)</b> are also of stochastic quantity and they are compared with experimental measurements. Application of the SBRA method {{in this area is}} a modern and innovative trend in mechanics. However, {{it takes a long time}} to solve this problem (due to material and structural nonlinearities, the large number of elements, many iteration steps and many Monte Carlo simulations).

40|$|Ultrasonic {{tools are}} used {{for a variety of}} cutting {{applications}} in surgery and the food industry, but when they are applied to harder materials, such as rock, their cutting performance declines because of the low effective impulse delivered by each vibration cycle. To overcome this problem, a technique known as high-frequency/low-frequency (or alternatively, ultrasonic/sonic) drilling is employed. In this approach, an ultrasonic step-horn is used to deliver an impulse to a free mass which subsequently moves toward a drilling bit, delivering the impulse on contact. The free mass then rebounds to complete the cycle. The horn has time between impacts to build significant vibration amplitude and thus delivers a much larger impulse to the free mass than could be delivered if it were applied directly to the target. To maximize the impulse delivered to the target by the <b>cutting</b> <b>bit,</b> both the momentum transfer from the ultrasonic horn to the free mass and the dynamics of the horn/free mass/cutting bit stack must be optimized. This paper uses finite element techniques to optimize the ultrasonic horns and numerical propagation of the stack dynamics to maximize the delivered effective impulse, validated in both cases by extensive experimental analysis...|$|E

40|$|High-frequency/low-frequency {{drilling}} is {{an attractive}} technology for planetary exploration tools, and one which has seen considerable innovation in the techniques used to ensure rotation of the front-end <b>cutting</b> <b>bit.</b> This rotation is essential to prevent tooth imprintation in hard materials, and extracting the rotation from the high-frequency or ultrasonic system has obvious benefits in terms of simplicity and robustness. However, extracting the rotation from an ultrasonic horn raises the possibility of bit-walk if {{it is used to}} operate a coring device and the authors therefore propose an ultrasonic horn which uses an excitation applied to a single input surface to yield torsional and longitudinal vibration on two physically separated output surfaces. By engaging with the two output surfaces, longitudinal vibration can be extracted to achieve initial percussive drilling, even where a coring bit is applied, and the torsional output can subsequently be added to prevent tooth imprintation once the coring bit has settled into the site in question. In this manner, the horn provides a mechanism whereby high-frequency/low-frequency drilling technique can be applied to coring operations without the need for an exceptionally robust drill structure capable of resisting bit-walk forces...|$|E
40|$|Drilling {{with water}} has the {{potential}} to significantly reduce the respirable dust concentrations generated from small-diameter rotary drills when drilling blastholes on surface mining operations. However, water adverseky affects tri- cone drill bits commonly used in surface drilling operations, causing excessive wear and premature replacement. Consequently, dry drilling with a dust collector system has the most widespread use in the industry. Tests have been conducted by the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (NOSH), Pittsburgh Research Laboratory (PRL) on a newly designed device for smaller diameter drills that separates the water from the bailing air before it reaches the bit and thus provides the cost benefit of dry drilling while providing the benefit of wet drilling for dust suppression. The water that is delivered to the hole with the bailing air is separated from the air by a proprietary mechanical device that is encased in a drill sub (short section of drill rod/pipe) located immediately behind the <b>cutting</b> <b>bit.</b> A cascade cyclone and a real-time dust monitor were used to sample dust emissions from the holes.

40|$|We {{propose that}} {{a new type of}} drill, {{alternately}} known as a Fast Mechanical-Access Drill, or Coiled Tubing Drill for Ice (CTDI), be developed for polar research. The proposed drill is similar in concept to the latest coiled tubing (CT) drills used for commercial oil and gas development. CT drills use a metal or advanced-composite tube to deliver fluid downhole to a hydraulic motor that drives a <b>cutting</b> <b>bit.</b> This technique should permit drilling rates of ∿ 40 m・(hr) ^ in polar ice. The bulk of the components are commercially available. The CTDI would be : a) capable of drilling through 3 - 4 km of ice in 6 - 8 days, including setup time, b) aircraft (LC- 130) transportable and sled-mounted for rapid mobilization/demobilization, c) able to drill an array of deep boreholes in a single season. d) able to produce semi-permanent uniform-diameter holes with minimal thermal disturbance, e) capable of acquiring rock cores, frozen sediment cores, and short ice cores, f) sufficiently modular and flexible by design that new tools can be added to satisfy future research needs. The capabilities of the CTDI would fill the void between existing deep ice-core drills and hot-water drills. It is believed the new drilling system would greatly enhance several lines of current research, as well as allow the pursuit of new scientific investigations that are not currently feasible. The CTDI could be used by the research community to help address outstanding questions concerning the Earth 2 ̆ 7 s climate system, the history and dynamics of ice sheets, the geology and tectonics of polar regions, and the biology within and beneath polar ice sheets.
