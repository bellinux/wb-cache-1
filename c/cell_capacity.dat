50|$|Without balancing, the {{smallest}} <b>capacity</b> <b>cell</b> is a problem, and potentially a serious one.

50|$|Solar {{power is}} a {{relatively}} recent arrival in Denmark and significant generation first occurred in 2012 with 104 GWh of electricity generation. By 2014 this had risen to 597 GWh. The large increase in solar deployment in 2012 was aided by incentives including tax credits and net settlement for produced power. In response to a dramatic rise in solar installations during that year the incentives were revised downwards for 2013 and a smaller rise occurred during that year. Smaller solar installations predominate with 73% of PV <b>cell</b> <b>capacity</b> being less than 6 kW {{by the end of}} 2014, a sign that incentives have largely benefitted households.

5000|$|Interference {{to other}} {{users in the}} same {{frequency}} band is increased. In cellular spread-spectrum systems such as CDMA, where users share a single frequency and are only separated by different spreading codes, the number of users that a cell can support {{as well as the}} size of the cell are typically limited by the amount of interference present in the cell; increased interference therefore results in decreased <b>cell</b> <b>capacity</b> and size. Even in FDMA systems such as GSM where each user in a cell uses a different frequency, interference is still present between different cells and reduces the amount of frequency reuse the network can support. In wireline networks such as DSL, lines from many subscriber homes are often bundled together, and interference between signals on different lines manifests itself as crosstalk and reduces the achievable data rate to each home.|$|E
