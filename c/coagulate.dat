5|$|Proteins were {{recognized}} as a distinct class of biological molecules {{in the eighteenth century}} by Antoine Fourcroy and others, distinguished by the molecules' ability to <b>coagulate</b> or flocculate under treatments with heat or acid. Noted examples at the time included albumin from egg whites, blood serum albumin, fibrin, and wheat gluten.|$|E
5|$|The {{protoplanetary disk}} is an {{accretion}} disk that feeds the central star. Initially very hot, the disk later cools {{in what is}} known as the T tauri star stage; here, formation of small dust grains made of rocks and ice is possible. The grains eventually may <b>coagulate</b> into kilometer-sized planetesimals. If the disk is massive enough, the runaway accretions begin, resulting in the rapid—100,000 to 300,000years—formation of Moon- to Mars-sized planetary embryos. Near the star, the planetary embryos go through a stage of violent mergers, producing a few terrestrial planets. The last stage takes approximately 100million to a billion years.|$|E
5|$|A rare but serious {{complication}} {{resulting from}} treatment with warfarin is warfarin necrosis, which occurs more frequently shortly after commencing treatment {{in patients with}} a deficiency of protein C. Protein C is an innate anticoagulant that, like the procoagulant factors that warfarin inhibits, requires vitamin K-dependent carboxylation for its activity. Since warfarin initially decreases protein C levels faster than the coagulation factors, it can paradoxically increase the blood's tendency to <b>coagulate</b> when treatment is first begun (many patients when starting on warfarin are given heparin in parallel to combat this), leading to massive thrombosis with skin necrosis and gangrene of limbs. Its natural counterpart, purpura fulminans, occurs in children who are homozygous for certain protein C mutations.|$|E
40|$|Chitosan, a {{cationic}} carbohydrate polymer manufactured from chitin in {{shrimp and}} crab wastes, <b>coagulated</b> suspended solids in cheese whey as effectively or {{more so than}} ten commercial synthetic polymers. Concentrations of suspended solids after settling were reduced over 90 % by coagulation at pH 6. 0 with a ratio of chitosan to suspended solids of 2. 15 %(1 : 46. 5). The yield of <b>coagulated</b> solids was approximately 2, 270 mglliter. The proximate composition of the <b>coagulated</b> solids after freeze drying was 73 % protein, 6 % lactose, 10 % ash, and 7 % moisture. Without {{the aid of a}} <b>coagulating</b> agent, settling for 1 or 3 h reduced suspended solids by only 34 % and 49 %, respectively. Rat feeding studies showed no significant differences in the protein efficiency ratio of casein, <b>coagulated</b> whey solids containing chitosan, and whey solids containing no polymer. These results provide evidence of utility for <b>coagulated</b> whey solids as a protein supplement...|$|R
40|$|We {{report on}} the {{blending}} of three natural polymers, raw cotton, silk and wool, using ionic liquids as the dissolving media. We find that with increased content of wool and silk the thermal degradation temperature of the new bio films increases. This is due {{to an increase in}} the hydrogen bond network between the blended polymers. We also investigated the role of the <b>coagulating</b> solvent by <b>coagulating</b> the bio films using water, methanol or isopropanol. Again, we find the <b>coagulating</b> solvent impacts the final properties of the bio films with water shown to <b>coagulated</b> films with the best material properties...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: In {{the present}} study, <b>coagulated</b> styrene- vinylpyridine-butadiene ter-polymer latex (VP latex) {{is used as}} a {{secondary}} accelerator to increase the cure rate in the sulfonamide–sulfur curing system in natural as well as synthetic rubber-based compounds. The activation energy is observed to be lower when <b>coagulated</b> VP latex {{is used as a}} secondary accelerator. All other physical properties are observed to be comparable. It is found that a small amount of <b>coagulated</b> VP ter-polymer is sufficient to increase the reaction rate. However, it is also found that <b>coagulated</b> VP latex alone is not a satisfactory accelerator...|$|R

25|$|Smallholders’ lump is {{produced}} by smallholders who collect rubber from trees far from the nearest factory. Many Indonesian smallholders, who farm paddies in remote areas, tap dispersed trees {{on their way to}} work in the paddy fields and collect the latex (or the coagulated latex) on their way home. As it is often impossible to preserve the latex sufficiently to get it to a factory that processes latex in time for it to be used to make high quality products, and as the latex would anyway have coagulated by the time it reached the factory, the smallholder will <b>coagulate</b> it by any means available, in any container available. Some smallholders use small containers, buckets etc., but often the latex is coagulated in holes in the ground, which are usually lined with plastic sheeting. Acidic materials and fermented fruit juices are used to <b>coagulate</b> the latex— a form of assisted biological coagulation. Little care is taken to exclude twigs, leaves, and even bark from the lumps that are formed, which may also include tree lace.|$|E
25|$|Milk {{contains}} {{dozens of}} other types of proteins beside caseins and including enzymes. These other proteins are more water-soluble than caseins and do not form larger structures. Because the proteins remain suspended in whey remaining when caseins <b>coagulate</b> into curds, they are collectively known as whey proteins. Whey proteins make up approximately 20% of the protein in milk by weight. Lactoglobulin is the most common whey protein by a large margin.|$|E

40|$|The {{comparative}} localisation of renin in the genital organs, {{especially in}} the <b>coagulating</b> glands of male mice of the strains C 57 BL/ 6 and Balb/c, was investigated using immunocytochemical, immunoelectron microscopical and Northern blot techniques. Dot-like reactions for renin, of varying diameters, were detected immunocytochemically in the epithelial cells of <b>coagulating</b> glands of C 57 BL/ 6 mice, but not in those of Balb/c mice. In both strains, many electron dense granules differing in content and morphology were observed in the epithelial cells of the <b>coagulating</b> glands. Crystalline materials were sometimes contained in these granules. Colloidal gold particles indicating the presence of renin were detected in the electron dense granules of C 57 BL/ 6 mice, in which they showed a heterogeneous distribution and were especially located on the crystalline structure. No positive reaction was detected in these crystalline structures in Balb/c mice. Renin mRNA was detected in the <b>coagulating</b> glands of both C 57 BL/ 6 and Balb/c mice by Northern blot analysis. However, the expression in C 57 BL/ 6 <b>coagulating</b> glands was stronger than that in Balb/c. These findings suggest that renin is synthesised and released in the <b>coagulating</b> glands...|$|R

25|$|Egg {{emulsion}} sauces include mayonnaise, Hollandaise and Béarnaise. For hollandaise sauce, {{egg yolks}} and water, lemon juice or vinegar are emulsified. Unlike custard, the egg does not <b>coagulate.</b> An emulsion {{is a mixture}} of two or more liquids that are normally immiscible (unmixable or unblendable). Droplets of the butter become suspended in the water and lemon juice once emulsion occurs. While emulsions can be either stable or unstable, hollandaise is made stable by the addition of eggs which contain lecithin, combining with the oil and water, holding it together.|$|E
25|$|Mohini was {{checked for}} Chédiak-Higashi {{syndrome}} in 1960, {{but the results}} were inconclusive. This condition is similar to albino mutations and causes bluish lightening of the fur color, crossed eyes, and prolonged bleeding after surgery. Also, {{in the event of}} an injury, the blood is slow to <b>coagulate.</b> This condition has been observed in domestic cats, but there has never been a case of a white tiger having Chédiak-Higashi syndrome. There has been a single case of a white tiger having central retinal degeneration, reported from the Milwaukee County Zoo, which could be related to reduced pigmentation in the eye. The white tiger in question was a male named Mota on loan from the Cincinnati Zoo.|$|E
25|$|Rennet is {{a mixture}} of enzymes used to <b>coagulate</b> milk into cheese. Originally it was {{available}} only from the fourth stomach of calves, and was scarce and expensive, or was available from microbial sources, which often produced unpleasant tastes. Genetic engineering made it possible to extract rennet-producing genes from animal stomachs and insert them into bacteria, fungi or yeasts to make them produce chymosin, the key enzyme. The modified microorganism is killed after fermentation. Chymosin is isolated from the fermentation broth, so that the Fermentation-Produced Chymosin (FPC) used by cheese producers has an amino acid sequence that is identical to bovine rennet. The majority of the applied chymosin is retained in the whey. Trace quantities of chymosin may remain in cheese.|$|E

40|$|Changes in the <b>coagulating</b> {{system of}} the blood were studied in six {{subjects}} during prolonged hypokinesia. Thrombogenic properties of the blood rose in all cases on the 8 th day. These changes are explained by stress reaction due to unusual conditions for a healthy person. Changes in the blood <b>coagulating</b> system in the group subjected to physical exercise and without it ran a practically parallel course.

When the mass fraction of the first <b>coagulating</b> bath is among 0 %- 50 %, the pure water flux of the membrane decreases with the concentration, and the rejection ratio of BSA change less, and when the concentration of the first <b>coagulating</b> bath exceeds 60 % and the openings appear on the membrane surface, the pure water flux would ascend but the rejection ratio would markedly decrease...|$|R
25|$|The simple phenols are not {{the only}} active element in wood-tar creosote. In solution, they <b>coagulate</b> albumin, which is a {{water-soluble}} protein found in meat; so they serve as a preserving agent, but also cause denaturation. Most of the phenols in the creosote are methoxy derivatives—they contain the methoxy group linked to the benzene nucleus (OCH3). The high level of methyl derivates created from the action of heat on wood (also apparent in the methyl alcohol produced through distillation) make wood-tar creosote substantially different from coal-tar creosote. Guaiacol is a methyl ether of pyrocatechin, while creosol is a methyl ether of methyl-pyrocatechin, the next homolog of pyrocatechin. Methyl ethers differ from simple phenols in being less hydrophilic, caustic and poisonous. This allows meat to successfully be preserved without tissue denaturation, and allows creosote {{to be used as a}} medical ointment.|$|E
25|$|Sulfate {{aerosols}} promote complex {{chemical reactions}} on their surfaces that alter chlorine and nitrogen chemical {{species in the}} stratosphere. This effect, together with increased stratospheric chlorine levels from chlorofluorocarbon pollution, generates chlorine monoxide (ClO), which destroys ozone (O3). As the aerosols grow and <b>coagulate,</b> they settle down into the upper troposphere where they serve as nuclei for cirrus clouds and further modify the Earth's radiation balance. Most of the hydrogen chloride (HCl) and hydrogen fluoride (HF) are dissolved in water droplets in the eruption cloud and quickly {{fall to the ground}} as acid rain. The injected ash also falls rapidly from the stratosphere; most of it is removed within several days to a few weeks. Finally, explosive volcanic eruptions release the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide and thus provide a deep source of carbon for biogeochemical cycles.|$|E
25|$|Camel milk {{cannot be}} made into butter by the {{traditional}} churning method. It can be made if it is soured first, churned, and a clarifying agent is then added. Until recently, camel milk could not {{be made into}} camel cheese because rennet was unable to <b>coagulate</b> the milk proteins to allow the collection of curds. Developing less wasteful uses of the milk, the FAO commissioned Professor J.P. Ramet of the École Nationale Supérieure d'Agronomie et des Industries Alimentaires, {{who was able to}} produce curdling by the addition of calcium phosphate and vegetable rennet. The cheese produced from this process has low levels of cholesterol and is easy to digest, even for the lactose intolerant. The sale of camel cheese is limited owing to the small output of the few dairies producing camel cheese and the absence of camel cheese in local (West African) markets. Cheese imports from countries that traditionally breed camels are difficult to obtain due to restrictions on dairy imports from these regions.|$|E

500|$|The acidity of {{dromedary}} milk {{stored at}} [...] increases {{at a slower}} rate than that of cow milk. Though the preparation of butter from dromedary milk is difficult, it {{has been carried out}} successfully in 1959 in the USSR. The cream of the dromedary milk, containing 4.2% fat, yielded 25.8% butter. In 2001, the ability of dromedary milk to form curd was studied; coagulation did not show curd formation, and had a pH of 4.4. It was much different from curd produced from cow milk, and had a fragile, heterogeneous composition probably composed of casein flakes. Nevertheless, cheese and other dairy products can be made from camel milk. A study found bovine calf rennet could be used to <b>coagulate</b> dromedary milk. A special factory has been set up in Nouakchott to pasteurise and make cheese from camel milk. Mystical beliefs surround the use of camel milk in some places; for example, it may be used as an aphrodisiac in Ethiopia.|$|E
