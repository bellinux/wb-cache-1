5|$|In {{the weekend}} from 4 to 6 February, county {{conventions}} {{were held in}} eleven counties, including Hagen's native Oslo, and Buskerud, Finnmark, Telemark, Vest-Agder, Hordaland, Nordland, Østfold, Troms, Nord-Trøndelag and Møre og Romsdal. Hagen belonged to the Oslo chapter, but {{the leader of the}} chapter, Peter N. Myhre, stated beforehand that Hagen's proposal would probably be rejected. It was speculated that rejections <b>could</b> <b>come</b> <b>from</b> the Buskerud and Finnmark's conventions as well. On 7 February, Hagen confirmed his leadership candidacy for the electoral committee.|$|E
5|$|Establishment {{and support}} of cadet battalions and rifle clubs, with the caveat that no funding could be {{provided}} out of the Parliamentary grant in respect of any person {{under the age of}} sixteen. This caveat was a compromise introduced on the third reading of the bill; the Commons had provided that no support could be given for a person under sixteen at all, and the Lords wished to remove this restriction. The compromise was to state that no support <b>could</b> <b>come</b> <b>from</b> Parliamentary funds, but the associations were effectively free to raise money themselves for this purpose.|$|E
5|$|Merit system: The {{earliest}} {{example of}} a merit system {{dates back to the}} Qin and Han dynasties. In order to maintain power over a large, sprawling empire, it became necessary for the government to maintain a complex network of officials. Prospective officials <b>could</b> <b>come</b> <b>from</b> a rural background and government positions were not restricted to the nobility. Rank was determined by merit, through the civil service examinations, and education became the key for social mobility. After the fall of the Han Dynasty, the nine-rank system was established during the Three Kingdoms period. The concept of a merit system spread from China to British India during the 17th century, and then into continental Europe and the United States.|$|E

50|$|The first {{mention of}} Währing is in {{documents}} from around 1170, as Warich. The name <b>could</b> plausibly <b>come</b> <b>from</b> Slavic (var for a warm spring) or Germanic (werich for {{a plot of}} land that a farmer can work for a day) origins. It <b>could</b> also <b>come</b> <b>from</b> Werigandus, the first abbot of Michaelbeuern Abbey. The name could also go back to Slavic land acquisitions: Döbling from toplica, warm stream, and Währing from varica, dark stream.|$|R
50|$|Forming a {{magma ocean}} {{requires}} {{a large amount}} of energy. This energy <b>could</b> have <b>come</b> <b>from</b> accretion, short-lived radioisotopes, and core formation.|$|R
5|$|Andrew II of Hungary was {{extremely}} favorably disposed towards the Templars. During {{his participation in}} the Fifth Crusade, he appointed Pontius de Cruce, Master of the Order in the Hungarian Kingdom, as a regent in Croatia and Dalmatia. After his return in 1219, {{in recognition of the}} great logistical and financial support which the Order had given him during the campaign, he granted the Order the estate of Gacka. Even before his departure from the city of Split in 1217, he had made over to the Templars the castle of Klis (Clissa), a strategic point in the hinterland of Split (Spalato), which controlled the approaches to the town. The king Andrew was reluctant to entrust the castle of Klis to any of the local magnates, knowing what great harm <b>could</b> <b>come</b> <b>from</b> that castle. It was the king's will that Split receive the castle of Klis for the defense of their city. The city of Split showed little interest in the royal favors, so the king entrusted Klis into Templars hands. Shortly after this, the Templars lost Klis, and, in exchange, the king gave them the coastal town of Šibenik (Sebenico).|$|E
5|$|Bach, the Thomaskantor in Leipzig from May 1723, {{composed}} this cantata {{to complete}} his second cantata cycle of chorale cantatas, begun in 1724. He used the lyrics of the hymn unchanged, which reflect the psalm and Jesus as the Good Shepherd. Bach structured the work in five movements. The outer choral movements are a chorale fantasia and a four-part closing chorale, both on the hymn tune. Bach set the inner stanzas as aria – recitative – aria, with music unrelated to the hymn tune. He scored the cantata for four vocal soloists, a four-part choir and a Baroque instrumental ensemble of two horns, two oboes d'amore, strings and continuo. Bach scholars agree that the brass instruments, normally reserved for Feast days, <b>could</b> <b>come</b> <b>from</b> an earlier chorale fantasia of the same melody with {{the text of the}} German Gloria.|$|E
5|$|In season 10, Cristina {{decides to}} accept a job to run {{a state of the}} art clinic in Switzerland. Owen {{supports}} her decision as he realizes no good <b>could</b> <b>come</b> <b>from</b> him asking her to stay, but requests her not to leave him until she has to leave him for good, following which, they both spend two weeks leading to her permanent departure together. While saying her farewell to her colleagues of the last seven years, there is a possible act of terrorism in Seattle, which later turns out to be just a gas main explosion. Cristina has a quick but emotional goodbye hug with Derek, Bailey, and Webber, leaves her shares of the hospital to Alex, and dances it out with Meredith one last time to an old favorite song. Owen, however, is busy saving a patient in the O.R., so they share a silent goodbye through the gallery's glass.|$|E

5|$|Investigation on this {{reaction}} was continued; {{the research was}} aimed at looking for fission fragments of isotopes of element 105. A subsequent paper was published in February 1970. Two activities were found, with half-lives of 14 ms and 2.2±0.5 s. The former activity was assigned to 242mfAm; the latter one was described as having been caused by an isotope of element 105. The possibility that the latter activity <b>could</b> <b>come</b> <b>from</b> a transfer reaction and thus not be from element 105 {{was said to be}} diminished {{by the fact that the}} yield ratio for {{this reaction}} was lower than that of the 242mfAm-producing transfer reaction. The idea that this synthesis reaction was indeed a (22Ne,xn) reaction was supported by research on reactions of the 243Am target with 18O; reactions producing 256103 and 257103 showed very little spontaneous fission (SF) activity (matching the established data), and the reaction producing heavier 258103 and 259103 produced no SF activity at all, falling in line with theoretical data.|$|E
25|$|In an ICM poll for The Guardian (14 February 2003– 16 February 2003), 6% {{of people}} claimed that someone from their {{household}} {{went on the}} march or had intended to. The StWC claims that this translates into 1.25million households and thus supports the estimate of two million people, assuming {{that more than one}} person <b>could</b> <b>come</b> <b>from</b> each household.|$|E
25|$|Launching {{materials}} from Earth is expensive, so bulk materials for colonies <b>could</b> <b>come</b> <b>from</b> the Moon, a near-Earth object (NEO), Phobos, or Deimos. The benefits of using such sources include: a lower gravitational force, no atmospheric drag on cargo vessels, and no biosphere to damage. Many NEOs contain {{substantial amounts of}} metals. Underneath a drier outer crust (much like oil shale), some other NEOs are inactive comets which include billions of tons of water ice and kerogen hydrocarbons, {{as well as some}} nitrogen compounds.|$|E

2500|$|The Supreme Court disagreed, {{stating that}} the new DNA {{evidence}} was of [...] "central importance." [...] A jury, informed that fluids on Mrs. Muncey's garments <b>could</b> have <b>come</b> <b>from</b> House, might have found that House traveled to the victim's home and lured her away in order to commit a sexual offense. According to the Court, a jury acting without {{the assumption that the}} semen <b>could</b> have <b>come</b> <b>from</b> House would have found it necessary to establish a different motive for her murder.|$|R

25|$|Du Pont in his {{official}} report asserted that he fully intended {{to renew the}} attack the next day, but his captains were unanimously opposed. Keokuk sank during the night (with no loss of life), {{two or three of}} the monitors had sustained damage that would keep them out of further action for days if not weeks, and the captains agreed that nothing good <b>could</b> <b>come</b> <b>from</b> prolonging the battle. Even if they could knock out Fort Sumter, the rest of the fortifications remained, and the fleet had not penetrated the first defensive ring.|$|E
25|$|A later study {{questioned}} {{the attitudes of}} adolescents. When asked about abstinence, many girls reported they felt conflicted. They were trying to balance maintaining a good reputation with trying to maintain a romantic relationship and wanting to behave in adult-like ways. Boys viewed having sex as social capital. Many boys believed that their male peers who were abstinent would not as easily climb the social ladder as sexually active boys. Some boys said that for them, the risks that may come from having sex were {{not as bad as}} the social risks that <b>could</b> <b>come</b> <b>from</b> remaining abstinent.|$|E
25|$|Simple attacks such as SYN floods {{may appear}} {{with a wide}} range of source IP addresses, giving the {{appearance}} of a well distributed DoS. These flood attacks do not require completion of the TCP three way handshake and attempt to exhaust the destination SYN queue or the server bandwidth. Because the source IP addresses can be trivially spoofed, an attack <b>could</b> <b>come</b> <b>from</b> a limited set of sources, or may even originate from a single host. Stack enhancements such as syn cookies may be effective mitigation against SYN queue flooding, however complete bandwidth exhaustion may require involvement.|$|E

25|$|Additionally, Article 7, Section 11 of the 1876 Constitution {{established}} the Permanent University Fund, a {{sovereign wealth fund}} managed by the Board of Regents of the University of Texas and dedicated {{for the maintenance of}} the university. Because some state legislators perceived an extravagance in the construction of academic buildings of other universities, Article 7, Section 14 of the Constitution expressly prohibited the legislature from using the state's general revenue to fund construction of university buildings. Funds for constructing university buildings had to come from the university's endowment or from private gifts to the university, but the university's operating expenses <b>could</b> <b>come</b> <b>from</b> the state's general revenues.|$|E
25|$|Having without difficulty, rid {{himself of}} the Clubmen, Rupert was eager to resume his march into the north. It is {{unlikely}} that he wished to join Montrose in Scotland, though Charles himself favoured that plan. However, he certainly intended to fight the Scottish army, more especially as after the Covenanter's defeat at the Scottish Battle of Inverlochy, the Scottish army in England had been called upon to detach a large force to deal with Montrose. But {{this time there was}} no Royalist army in the north to provide infantry and guns for a pitched battle. Rupert had perforce to wait near Hereford till the main body, and in particular the artillery train, <b>could</b> <b>come</b> <b>from</b> Oxford and join him.|$|E
25|$|Later {{on in the}} woods, Regina and Emma stumble onto Henry {{practicing}} {{and both}} give him a boost of encouragement. This bought back memories for Regina as she reflected about how Cora killed Daniel, which gave Regina an idea to obtain the tear, which <b>could</b> <b>come</b> <b>from</b> her by using the dreamcatcher. When Emma tried using it, the potion didn’t work, as Regina has moved on to Robin. Meanwhile, Henry treats Violet to dinner and a movie at Granny's and she is impressed, but when the subject of dating or courting came up, Violet tells Henry {{that she wants to}} just be friends, but explains that it was not because of her father's disapproval of him. This devastated Henry because he is not a hero in this universe. He is consoled by Regina, who then takes Henry's teardrop to Emma and tells Henry he just found a way to save Emma.|$|E

25|$|Much of {{the flow}} of the Jordan River is {{diverted}} by Israel and much {{of the flow}} of the Yarmouk River by Syria, leaving only a small share to Jordan. Syria and Jordan have signed a bilateral treaty over the sharing of the Yarmouk River in 1987 in preparation for the construction of the Al-Wehda Dam on the border between the two countries. An Annex to the Israel–Jordan Treaty of Peace of 1994 specifies the allocation of the Jordan River and the lower Yarmouk River water between the two countries. As part of this treaty, Israel supplies Jordan with 20 million cubic metres per year during the summer from the Sea of Galilee in exchange for the same amount that Israel pumps from the Yarmouk River in the winter for storage in the Sea of Galilee. The treaty also specifies the supply of 10 million m3 of desalinated brackish water from Israel to Jordan and the supply of an additional 50 million cubic metres per year of drinkable water for Jordan from an unspecified source. This water <b>could</b> <b>come</b> <b>from</b> the Sea of Galilee or brackish water springs.|$|E
500|$|The {{origin and}} meaning of the name [...] "Teaneck" [...] is not known, but {{speculation}} is that it <b>could</b> <b>come</b> <b>from</b> various Dutch or English words, {{or it could be}} Native American in origin, meaning [...] "the woods". An alternative is from the Dutch [...] "Tiene Neck" [...] meaning [...] "neck where there are willows" [...] (from the Dutch [...] "tene" [...] meaning willow).|$|E
