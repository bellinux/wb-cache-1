5|$|Elphaba {{returns to}} the Wizard's palace to free the monkey {{servants}} and comes across the Wizard himself. He tries once again to convince her to work with him, telling her {{that he is not}} evil - just a mediocre man who <b>came</b> <b>into</b> <b>his</b> position by chance, led to stay by the reverence of the Ozians, and he offers to redeem Elphaba's reputation ("Wonderful"). She is almost won over, until she sees Dr. Dillamond, who has lost the power of speech. She vows to fight the Wizard until the end. Fiyero and the guards enter, followed by Glinda. Fiyero helps Elphaba escape, and decides to escape with her, leaving Glinda behind. Though she was broken-hearted, Glinda reminds the Wizard and Madame Morrible that the way to recapture Elphaba is to make her think her sister is in trouble, and she will be sure to come to her rescue. She mourns that Fiyero does not love her ("I'm Not that Girl, Reprise").|$|E

25|$|Contrary {{to popular}} Western impressions, sub-Saharan Africa did produce {{significant}} cavalry forces where the environment permitted it. The savannahs of Western Africa in particular (Guinea, Gambia, Senegal, Niger etc.) and its borderlands into the Sahara and Sahel saw {{the development of}} several powerful cavalry-based states that dominated the region for centuries. Where the tsetse fly was not strong, and the terrain was favorable, the mounted horseman <b>came</b> <b>into</b> <b>his</b> own, and emerged as the true aristocracy of the savannah. As they did further north in Carthage, Egypt and Libya, {{the introduction of the}} horse, (and to some extent the camel in desert areas) had a transformational effect on African warfare.|$|E

Paterson, now with a rifle, ran back outside and onto Champ Street. He decided he could not get a clear shot, so he stood on a low wall in the prison's front garden. He aimed his rifle at Ryan, and claimed he fired a shot in the air when a woman <b>came</b> <b>into</b> <b>his</b> line of sight.|$|E
25|$|The Third Symphony was a {{transitional}} work. Glazunov admitted its composition caused {{him a great}} deal of trouble. With the Fourth Symphony, he <b>came</b> <b>into</b> <b>his</b> mature style. Dedicated to Anton Rubinstein, the Fourth was written as a deliberately cosmopolitan work by a Russian looking outward to the West, yet it remained unmistakably Russian in tone. He continued to synthesize nationalist tradition and Western technique in the Fifth Symphony. By the time Glazunov wrote his Seventh Symphony, his duties at the Conservatory had slowed his rate of composition. After his Eighth Symphony, his heavy drinking may have started taking a toll on his creativity, as well. He sketched one movement of a Ninth Symphony but left the work unfinished.|$|E
25|$|Little is {{recorded}} of Richard's early life. On 19 May 1426 he was knighted at Leicester by John of Lancaster, 1st Duke of Bedford, {{the younger brother}} of King Henry V. In October 1429 (or earlier) his marriage to Cecily Neville took place. On 6 November he {{was present at the}} formal coronation of King Henry VI in Westminster Abbey. He then followed Henry to France, being present at his coronation as king of France in Notre-Dame on 16 December 1431. Finally, on 12 May 1432, he <b>came</b> <b>into</b> <b>his</b> inheritance and was granted full control of his estates. On 22 April 1433 York was admitted to the Order of the Garter.|$|E

25|$|Dravid's post-World Cup {{campaign}} {{started on}} a poor note with just 40 runs coming in 4 games of Aiwa Cup in August 1999. He soon <b>came</b> <b>into</b> <b>his</b> own, top-scoring for India in two consecutive limited-overs series – the Singapore Challenge, the highlight being a hundred in the Final coming in a lost cause, and the DMC Cup, the highlight being a match winning effort (77 runs, 4 catches) in the series decider for which he received man-of-the-match award. By now, Dravid had started to keep wickets on an infrequent basis with India fielding him as designated wicket-keeper in five out of 10 ODIs played in the three events. Dravid had a quiet time in the LG Cup where he scored 81 runs in 4 games.|$|E
25|$|While Earl Browder {{was one of}} the {{top leaders}} of American Communism during the {{so-called}} Third Period of the early 1930s, he <b>came</b> <b>into</b> <b>his</b> own during the interval which followed, the era of the Popular Front against fascism. With the rise of Adolf Hitler to Chancellor of Germany at the end of January 1933, {{the balance of power in}} Europe was shifted. Formerly home to one of the most powerful Communist organizations, the Communist Party of Germany (KPD) was quickly suppressed. The failure of the KPD to cooperate with workers adhering to the rival Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD) was seen by many Comintern officials as a major contributing factor to the disaster. New tactics building a broad alliance in opposition to fascism seemed to be indicated.|$|E
25|$|Taupin came to Spain {{as part of}} the 2nd Division under Marshal Jean-de-Dieu Soult. On 15 September 1810, he {{commanded}} a brigade in Bertrand Clausel's division of Junot's VIII Corps during the Battle of Bussaco. The 1,949-man brigade consisted of the 4th Battalions of the 15th Light, 46th Line, and 75th Line Infantry Regiments. The VIII Corps was part of Marshal André Masséna's Army of Portugal. While the French were engaged in the 1810 Siege of Ciudad Rodrigo Taupin vowed to shoot any French soldier that <b>came</b> <b>into</b> <b>his</b> brigade's area to forage for grain. During the invasion, Taupin's brigade was in the advance guard and began to pillage Coimbra as soon as that city was occupied. When other French officers complained, Junot refused to do anything. Taupin served throughout the 1810–11 invasion of Portugal.|$|E

On reaching the age of 21 he <b>came</b> <b>into</b> <b>his</b> inheritance from his father, but he squandered much of it on gambling and on funding two unsuccessful newspapers, The National Standard and The Constitutional, {{for which he had}} hoped to write. He also lost a good part of his fortune in the collapse of two Indian banks. Forced to consider a profession to support himself, he turned first to art, which he studied in Paris, but did not pursue it, except in later years as the illustrator of some of his own novels and other writings.|$|E
25|$|The {{day after}} the decision, Gould says, Truesdale <b>came</b> <b>into</b> <b>his</b> office and {{subjected}} him to loud verbal abuse (which devolved into a shouting match) because Truesdale was upset that Gould had spoken to the New York Times about the Board's decision. Gould lunched with Mikva after the incident, at which time Mikva allegedly counseled Gould to allow Truesdale and the other Board members to write opinions supporting their votes in this high-profile case. Gould was unwilling to do this, and told Mikva that Truesdale was too deferential to the General Counsel's requests to make that a valuable exercise. On March 28, Gould learned that Truesdale was about to publish comments critical of Gould's contacts with the press during the baseball strike. Gould asked Mikva if the White House {{would be willing to}} privately discipline Truesdale, but Mikva indicated it would not.|$|E
25|$|The Astros {{were playing}} great {{baseball}} throughout the season. José Cruz and Enos Cabell both stole 30 bases. Joe Niekro {{had a great}} year with 21 wins and 3.00 ERA. J. R. Richard won 18 games and set a new personal strikeout record at 313. Joe Sambito <b>came</b> <b>into</b> <b>his</b> own with 22 saves as the Astros closer. Things were going as they should {{for a team that}} could win the west. The Astros and Reds battled the final month of the season. The Reds pulled ahead of the Astros by a game and a half. Later that month they split a pair and the Reds kept the lead. That would be how it would end. The Astros finished with their best record to that point at 89–73 and 1½ games behind the NL winner Reds.|$|E

25|$|Mackworth <b>came</b> <b>into</b> <b>his</b> estates, aged 21, in 1624. He {{married for}} the first time, around the same time, to Anne Waller: a son was baptised on 10 September 1629. His family lived at Betton Strange while he practised as a lawyer, {{dividing}} his time between Shropshire and London. From 1626 to 1631 he collected reports on cases in the Court of Common Pleas and the Court of King's Bench. In the 1630s he was {{a lawyer for the}} town of Shrewsbury itself. In 1633 he was made an alderman of the town, although the position was unconfirmed as the town was awaiting confirmation of its royal charter. During this period of absolute monarchy, known as Thorough, most of the normal political channels for debate and contest were unavailable and both conformity and dissent were vented through ecclesiastical politics.|$|E
25|$|McDonald {{started his}} first class career with 32 wickets {{in his first}} ten games in 2003–04. His best spell was 6 for 67 against Western Australia. He was {{struggling}} however with the bat and despite batting at 4 {{at the start of}} the summer he would end it at number 8 in the batting order. Finger surgery the following season limited his appearances. In 2005–06 he played just four matches and only managed 83 runs and four wickets. Injury free, McDonald <b>came</b> <b>into</b> <b>his</b> own in the 2006–07 season. In the Pura Cup he boasted a batting average of over a hundred when he brought up his 500th run. He finished the season as only the 4th player in Sheffield Shield/Pura Cup history to reach the double of 750 runs and 25 wickets in a season.|$|E
25|$|With his father's death, {{fighting}} for the king at the Battle of Shrewsbury on 21 July 1403, Sir John <b>came</b> <b>into</b> <b>his</b> patrimony. In September his commission of array for Shropshire was renewed, along with his uncle's, and his commission of the peace was renewed twice in 1404, in March from Westminster and in November from Coventry. St. Mary's Priory in Coventry was the location that month of a Michaelmas Parliament, the second of that year because of royal financial demands, known as the Parliamentum Indoctorum or Unlearned Parliament. This was attended as representatives for Derbyshire by Cokayne and Roger Bradbourne, a Lancastrian who had fought under Gaunt in Spain and welcomed Bolingbroke at Ravenspurn but was not apparently a paid part of the Lancastrian retinue. The two members claimed expenses totalling £16 for 40 days' service, authorised by a writ issued on 12 November.|$|E
