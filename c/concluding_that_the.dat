5|$|Based on {{his work}} for the 60 Minutes reports plus further {{investigation}} on his own, Thompson wrote A Glimpse of Hell. The book was published by W. W. Norton & Company. Thompson's book was extremely critical {{of most of the}} Navy personnel involved in the investigation, <b>concluding</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Navy had orchestrated a cover-up to conceal the true cause of the explosion.|$|E
5|$|Breckinridge {{was also}} {{concerned}} with easing overland {{transport of goods}} to Virginia. In mid-1795, he, Robert Barr, Elijah Craig, and Harry Toulmin formed a committee {{to raise funds for}} a road connecting the Cumberland Gap to central Kentucky. Breckinridge was disappointed with the quality of the route, which was finished in late 1796, <b>concluding</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> individual maintaining it was keeping most of the tolls instead of using them for the road's upkeep.|$|E

He holds that while direct action should be tolerated in liberal democracies, this toleration should not extend to certain campaigning tactics used by extremists, such as threat-making.|$|E
5|$|In February 2010, the IMA {{shifted from}} current {{environmental}} control standards within their exhibition spaces, allowing {{temperature and humidity}} fluctuation of a few degrees {{on either side of}} the suggested standard.

5|$|After a Ministry of Supply {{security}} officer {{working at the}} project is shot dead, M assigns Bond to replace him and also to investigate what {{has been going on}} at the missile-building base, located between Dover and Deal on the south coast of England. All the rocket scientists working on the project are German. At his post on the complex, Bond meets Gala Brand, a beautiful police Special Branch officer working undercover as Drax's personal assistant. Bond also uncovers clues concerning his predecessor's death, <b>concluding</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> man may have been killed for witnessing a submarine off the coast.|$|E
5|$|He {{describes}} {{the range of}} species in each group in some detail, <b>concluding</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> birds are unlike those {{of any of the}} surrounding countries and are quite isolated, but are related to those of distant places including New Guinea, Australia, India and Africa; he thinks there is nowhere else where so many such species occur in one place. Similarly in the Nymphalidae (he mentions the English member, the purple emperor butterfly), there are 48 species of which 35 are endemic to Celebes. He concludes that the Celebes group of islands is a major faunal division of the archipelago.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to the new findings, the U.S. Navy, with Sandia's assistance, reopened the investigation. In August 1991, Sandia and the GAO completed their reports, <b>concluding</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> explosion was likely caused by an accidental overram of powder bags into the breech of the 16-inch gun. The U.S. Navy, however, disagreed with Sandia's opinion {{and concluded that the}} cause of the explosion could not be determined. The U.S. Navy expressed regret (but not an apology) to Hartwig's family and closed its investigation.|$|E

5|$|Interest {{continued}} in {{the origins of the}} castle, which for a period were forgotten. Local medieval tradition suggested that the mound had been made by the devil, after he completed the dykes at Narborough and Newmarket, but by the Victorian period academics had concluded that the mound was either of Celtic or Norman origin, with late Victorian scholars correctly <b>concluding</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Norman period was the most likely. Other traditions claimed that the mound covered a palace filled with treasure, or six silver bells from Thetford Priory. Archaeological investigations into Red Castle by G. Knocker between 1957–58, and during the early 1960s by R. R. Clarke and Barbara Green revealed the design and date of this castle site.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, the 11th century {{dispute over}} the cathedral {{graveyard}} had continued unabated and in 1217 Henry III's government decided to announce that the disputed land would be granted to the cathedral. A panel met to agree exactly how the land should be divided, <b>concluding</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> division should run straight across the bailey; the far side was returned to the cathedral, making {{the remainder of the}} castle unusable from a military perspective. Henry thus ingratiated himself with the church and broke the power of the Beauchamps in the city by crippling their local fortress.|$|E
5|$|Prior to this burst, astronomers had {{not reached}} {{consensus}} regarding {{how far away}} GRBs occur from Earth. Although the isotropic distribution of bursts suggested {{that they do not}} occur within the disk of the Milky Way, some astronomers supported the idea that they occur within the Milky Way's halo, <b>concluding</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> bursts are visibly faint because they are not highly energetic. Others concluded that GRBs occur in other galaxies at cosmological distances and that they can be detected because they are extremely energetic. The distance measurement and the calculations of the burst's total energy release unequivocally supported the latter theory, effectively ending the debate.|$|E

5|$|The Australian {{zoologist}} John Veron and {{his co-workers}} analyzed ribosomal RNA in 1996 to obtain similar results to Romano and Palumbi, again <b>concluding</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> traditional families were plausible but that the suborders were incorrect. They also established that stony corals are monophyletic, including all the descendants of a common ancestor, but that they are divided into two groups, the robust and complex clades. Veron suggested that both morphological and molecular systems be used in future classification schemes.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} {{histories of}} British and Irish castles were recorded, albeit {{in a somewhat}} fragmented fashion, by John Leland in the 16th century and, by the 19th century, historical analysis of castles had become popular. Victorian historians such as George Clark and John Parker concluded that British castles had been built {{for the purposes of}} military defence, but believed that their history was pre-Conquest – <b>concluding</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> mottes across the countryside had been built by either the Romans or Celts.|$|E
5|$|As decolonisation {{proceeded}} {{throughout the}} British Empire in the 1950s and 1960s, former colonies often did not reject English but rather {{continued to use}} it as independent countries setting their own language policies. For example, the view of the English language among many Indians has gone from associating it with colonialism to associating it with economic progress, and English continues to be an official language of India. English is also widely used in media and literature, and the number of English language books published annually in India is the third largest in the world after the US and UK. However English is rarely spoken as a first language, numbering only around a couple hundred-thousand people, and less than 5% of the population speak fluent English in India. David Crystal claimed in 2004 that, combining native and non-native speakers, India now has more people who speak or understand English than {{any other country in the}} world, but the number of English speakers in India is very uncertain, with most scholars <b>concluding</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> United States still has more speakers of English than India.|$|E

5|$|Having survived {{until the}} end of the time stop, the LEP is bound by law and leaves the {{remaining}} gold and departs. At the end, Butler demands an explanation as to how Artemis came up with the idea of using sleeping pills. Artemis explains that he had gotten the idea from old fairy tales, in which human characters never wake up at an inopportune moment for the fairies, and had guessed that time-stops were the reason. <b>Concluding</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> time-stop forces a being to stay in whichever state of consciousness they were in when the time-stop is started, Artemis uses sleeping pills to break out of the time-stop. Artemis finds his mother has fully recovered from her insanity thanks to Holly's magic.|$|E
5|$|Later, in 1993, Gerard 't Hooft wrote a {{speculative}} {{paper on}} quantum gravity {{in which he}} revisited Hawking's work on black hole thermodynamics, <b>concluding</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> total number of degrees of freedom in a region of spacetime surrounding a black hole {{is proportional to the}} surface area of the horizon. This idea was promoted by Leonard Susskind and is now known as the holographic principle. The holographic principle and its realization in string theory through the AdS/CFT correspondence have helped elucidate the mysteries of black holes suggested by Hawking's work and are believed to provide a resolution of the black hole information paradox. In 2004, Hawking conceded that black holes do not violate quantum mechanics, and he suggested a concrete mechanism by which they might preserve information.|$|E
5|$|On 6 January 2006, the Regional Public Prosecutor in Viborg {{discontinued}} {{the investigation}} as {{he found no}} basis for <b>concluding</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> cartoons constituted a criminal offence because the publication concerned a subject of public interest and Danish case law extends editorial freedom to journalists regarding subjects of public interest. He stated that in assessing what constitutes an offence, the right to freedom of speech {{must be taken into}} consideration, and said that freedom of speech must be exercised with the necessary respect for other human rights, including the right to protection against discrimination, insult and degradation. In a new hearing resulting from a complaint about the original decision, the Director of Public Prosecutors in Denmark agreed with the previous ruling.|$|E
