5|$|Already in 1941, Tronstad {{was aware}} that heavy water {{production}} at Vemork had greatly increased. In the beginning, Tronstad had not {{been aware of the}} connection between heavy water and atomic weaponry, but it eventually became clear that Germany could be running a nuclear energy project, especially after Harold Urey visited the United Kingdom in November 1941. Tronstad later learned from Jomar Brun that further expansion of heavy water production was being discussed. Brun had been a part of a small <b>conference</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> issue, hosted by Kurt Diebner in Berlin, in January 1942. Brun would later communicate with England through Einar Skinnarland, a covert Special Operations Executive agent hailing from Rjukan. In October 1942, Brun was summoned to England, reportedly at the request of Winston Churchill. Instead, a team of agents were parachuted into the area to gather more intelligence, under the codename Operation Grouse.|$|E
5|$|In 1999, Oliver Ford Davies {{starred in}} Ben Brown's play Larkin With Women at the Stephen Joseph Theatre, Scarborough, reprising his {{role at the}} Orange Tree Theatre, London in 2006. The play was {{published}} by Larkin's usual publishers, Faber and Faber. Set in the three decades after Larkin's arrival in Hull, it explores his long relationships with Monica Jones, Maeve Brennan and Betty Mackereth. Another Larkin inspired entertainment, devised and starring Sir Tom Courtenay, was given a pre-production performance {{on the afternoon of}} Saturday 29 June 2002 at Hull University's Middleton Hall. Courtenay performed his one-man play Pretending to Be Me as part of the Second Hull International <b>Conference</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Work of Philip Larkin. In November that year, Courtenay debuted the play at the West Yorkshire Playhouse, later transferring the production to the Comedy Theatre in London's West End.|$|E

5|$|In May 1958, Britain had {{informed}} that US {{that it would}} be willing to join a testing moratorium on 31 October 1958, by which point it would have finished its hydrogen-bomb testing, conditional on the US providing Britain with nuclear information following amendment of the McMahon Act. The US Congress approved amendments permitting greater collaboration in late June. Following Soviet assent on 30 August 1958 to the one-year moratorium, the three countries conducted a series of tests in September and October. At least 54 tests were conducted by the US and 14 by the Soviet Union in this period. On 31 October 1958 the three countries initiated test-ban negotiations (the <b>Conference</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Discontinuance of Nuclear Tests) and agreed to a temporary moratorium (the Soviet Union joined the moratorium shortly after this date). The moratorium would last for close to three years.|$|E
5|$|Intelligent Systems for Molecular Biology (ISMB) is {{an annual}} {{academic}} <b>conference</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> subjects of bioinformatics and computational biology organised by the International Society for Computational Biology (ISCB).

The conference has been held every year since 1993 and has grown {{to become one of}} the largest and most prestigious meetings in these fields, hosting over 2,000 delegates in 2004. From the first meeting, ISMB has been held in locations worldwide; since 2007, meetings have been located in Europe and North America in alternating years. Since 2004, European meetings have been held jointly with the European Conference on Computational Biology (ECCB).|$|E
5|$|Josephson's {{reputation}} for promoting unorthodox causes was cemented by {{his support for}} the ideas of water memory and cold fusion, both of which are rejected by mainstream scientists. Water memory is purported to provide an explanation for homeopathy; it is mostly dismissed by scientists as pseudoscience, although Josephson has expressed support for it since attending a conference at which French immunologist Jacques Benveniste first proposed it. Cold fusion is the hypothesis that nuclear reactions can occur at room temperature. When Martin Fleischmann, the British chemist who pioneered research into it, died in 2012, Josephson wrote a supportive obituary in the Guardian and complained to Nature that its obituary had failed to give Fleischmann due credit. Antony Valentini of Imperial College London withdrew Josephson's invitation to a 2010 <b>conference</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> de Broglie-Bohm theory because of his work on the paranormal, although it was reinstated after complaints.|$|E

5|$|Mills made eight {{appearances}} for Boston {{before being}} appointed the player-manager of Southern League Premier Division club Tamworth on 12 January 2001. He {{was not in}} charge for the following day's 3–0 home defeat to Boston in the FA Trophy, with Tim Steele continuing as caretaker manager for this match. His first match as manager was a 2–2 home draw with Havant & Waterlooville on 20 January 2001, in which he played and scored. Tamworth finished the season in 12th place in the Southern League Premier Division, and Mills made 16 appearances and scored two goals. Tamworth missed out on promotion to the Football <b>Conference</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> final day of 2001–02, finishing second in the Southern League Premier Division, two points behind the title winners Kettering Town. He played often for Tamworth this season, making 30 appearances.|$|E

He was facing a season-long NCAA suspension after testing positive for marijuana after the Wolverines' NCAA tournament win over Tennessee, a game for which he dressed but {{was not able to}} play. When all three players were drafted, it marked the first time Michigan had at least three draft picks since the 1990 NBA draft.|$|E

On April 8 Kennedy and his wife went, {{at the request of}} Coretta Scott King, to Atlanta to attend Martin Luther King Jr.'s funeral. That evening he held a meeting with his aides over how {{to get the attention of}} middle-class whites weary of the civil rights movement in order to relieve the racial tension in the country. Kennedy returned to Indiana and on April 10 delivered his third and final speech inspired by King's death. Moving past his previous calls for compassion and an end to violence, he admonished whites to accept and welcome blacks into American society. Throughout the rest of the month, Kennedy toned down his campaign rhetoric and fixed on a theme of unity and reconciliation.|$|E
5|$|The {{main event}} at Against All Odds was a {{standard}} wrestling {{match for the}} NWA World Heavyweight Championship, in which Jeff Jarrett defended the championship against his on-screen rival Kevin Nash. The bout was announced on the January 21 episode of TNA's primary television program, TNA Impact!, during a pre-taped press <b>conference.</b> <b>On</b> <b>the</b> February 11 episode of Impact!, authority figure Dusty Rhodes added the stipulation that if Jarrett used a guitar (a weapon he often used to win his matches) during the match, he would be automatically disqualified and would lose the NWA World Heavyweight Championship to Nash even if the referee did not see him use it.|$|E
5|$|British {{knowledge}} of thermonuclear weapons {{was based on}} work done at the Los Alamos Laboratory during the war. Two British scientists, Bretscher and Fuchs, had attended the <b>conference</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Super (as it was then called) there in April 1946, and Chadwick had written a secret report on it in May 1946. The Classic Super design was unsuccessful. Fuchs and John von Neumann had produced an ingenious alternative design, for which they filed a patent in May 1946. This was tested in the American Operation Greenhouse George test in May 1951, but was also found to be unworkable. There was also some intelligence about Joe 4 derived from its debris, which was provided to Britain under the 1948 Modus Vivendi. Penney established three megaton bomb projects at Aldermaston. Orange Herald, under Bryan Taylor, a large boosted fission weapon; Green Bamboo an interim thermonuclear design similar to Soviet Layer Cake used in Joe 4 and the American Alarm Clock; and Green Granite, a true thermonuclear design. Orange Herald {{would be the first}} British weapon to incorporate an external neutron initiator.|$|E

5|$|By December 1942, with Allied forces {{advancing}} through Tunisia {{after landing}} there {{the month before}} in Operation Torch, the North African Campaign was coming to a close; with victory there imminent, discussions began among the Allies regarding {{the nature of their}} next objective. Many Americans argued for an immediate invasion of Northern France, while the British, as well as then-Lieutenant General Dwight D. Eisenhower, argued that the island of Sardinia was the best subsequent target of the Allied forces. In January 1943 the British Prime Minister Winston Churchill and U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt settled at the Casablanca <b>Conference</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> island of Sicily, whose invasion and occupation could potentially provide the Allies with Mediterranean shipping routes and airfields nearer to mainland Italy and Germany. The codename Operation Husky was decided upon for the Allied invasion of Sicily, and planning for Husky began in February. Initially the British Eighth Army, under the command of General Sir Bernard Montgomery, were to land on the south-eastern corner of the island and advance north to the port of Syracuse. Two days later the U.S. Seventh Army, commanded by Lieutenant General George S. Patton, would land on the western corner of the island and move towards the port of Palermo.|$|E
5|$|In 1929, Stevens {{returned}} to the United States and began to study law, taking classes at the American University and Columbia University in international law and foreign policy. In 1930, she {{returned to}} Havana in February for {{the first meeting of}} the CIM women which included Flora de Oliveira Lima (Brazil), Aída Parada (Chile), Lydia Fernández (Costa Rica), Elena Mederos de González (Cuba), Gloria Moya de Jiménez (Dominican Republic), Irene de Peyré (Guatemala), Margarita Robles de Mendoza (Mexico), Juanita Molina de Fromen (Nicaragua), Clara González (Panama), Teresa Obregoso de Prevost (Peru). From Cuba, she went to The Hague for the first World <b>Conference</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Codification of International Law held on 13 March. Presenting her data on what had been accomplished in the Americas, Stevens asked that the international community enact laws to protect women's citizenship. She {{returned to the}} United States and her studies. Though she didn't graduate, in 1931 she became the first woman member of the American Institute of International Law. That same year, she, Belmont and Paul attended the League of Nations meeting in September to present their nationality findings.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to drug smuggling, Noriega's associates such as Floyd Carlton and Cesar Rodríguez also eventually {{became involved with}} money laundering: large sums from drug revenues were brought in from Miami and elsewhere to Panama for laundering, and Noriega received protection payments in these instances as well. American Steven Kalish also began a large scale business selling drugs, laundering money and selling hardware to the Panamanian military for large profits with Noriega's assistance. Dinges writes that in {{at the time of}} the 1984 election, Kalish was preparing to ship a load of marijuana worth U.S. $1.4 million through Panama, for which Noriega had agreed to provide false Panamanian customs stamps to help it avoid scrutiny in the U.S.; Noriega was to be payed $1 million for this exercise. However, beginning in 1984 Noriega appeared to reduce the scale of his operations, and even ordered a raid against a cocaine factory in the interior of Panama, a raid which he then emphasized as evidence of his cooperation with the U.S. in their fight against drugs. He also ordered a crackdown on money laundering by the Colombian cartel. Noriega's new image was symbolized by his being invited as a speaker in 1985 to Harvard University, for a <b>conference</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> role of the military in Central America's wars, a speech which received a lot of attention in Panama's pro-government press.|$|E
