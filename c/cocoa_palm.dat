50|$|Agricultural {{production}} in Ashanti {{is a major}} contributor to Ashanti region and national economy. Industrial agricultural production is mainly undertaken for household consumption in Ashanti region and Kumasi metropolis, despite the huge demand for food by the large and relatively affluent Ashanti capital Kumasi metropolis urban populace. Therefore, Ashanti's and Kumasi metropolis' modern agricultural activity on a large scale finds a ready large urban market demand for food produce in Kumasi metropolis and Ashanti region country. Ashanti region and Kumasi's centrality has been a significant factor in defining its role as a major market for agricultural produce from the hinterland of Ashanti region. Kumasi's strategic location within Ashanti region has also endowed it with the status of the principal trucking terminal, and assured its pivotal role in the vast and profitable distribution of goods across the Ashanti region country. The impact of these on the structure of Kumasi metropolis has been the creation of a strong commercial centre covering Kejetia, Adum, Asafo and parts of Bantama in Ashanti's capital Kumasi metropolis. Ashanti region and Kumasi metropolis has abundant food supplies to feed its Ashanti people population. These Ashanti region and Kumasi metropolis food supplies include cooking plantain, rice, maize, wheat, cassava, taro-cocoyam, pineapple, yam, vegetables and other cereals and legumes. Irish potatoes also thrive well in Nsuta near Mampong in Ashanti region country. Kumasi metropolis and Ashanti region industrial crops grown include <b>cocoa,</b> <b>palm</b> oil, tobacco, bast fibre, cotton, citrus and cashew, sweet potatoes, millet, beans, onions, peanuts, tomatoes, and many fruits.·Ashanti region and Kumasi Metropolis has a large number of poultry farming industries including Darko Farms, Mfum Farms, Asamoah Yamoah Farms, Asare Farms and many others and Ashanti region with Kumasi metropolis also has large poultry feedmills.

40|$|This study {{examined}} the effects of agroclimatic factors on the yield of cash crops in Nigeria and other variables such as producer prices, exchange rate and level of national income (GDP). The effects of total rainfall, mean temperature, sunshine hour, relative humidity, radiation, exchange rate and GDP on the yields of three cash crops (<b>Cocoa,</b> <b>Palm</b> Kernel and Palm Oil) were estimated for the period 1970 - 2003 in Nigeria. The methods of analysis employed in the study were mainly error-correction model (ECM) within the context of co-integration theory. The results showed that all the variables are not stationary at their levels and thus, a need for differencing once to attain stationary. Statistical significance of the error-correction terms for the three produce validates the existence of an equilibrium relationship among the variables in each of these co-integrating vectors. However, producer price, temperature and GDP were the most significant factors influencing the yield of cocoa while only exchange rate was the most significant factors for the palm produce...|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the in situ and in vitro degradation kinetics and to predict the digestible neutral detergent fiber (dNDF) from the incubation times; in situ and in vitro degradation kinetic parameters; and equations fitted for agricultural and agro-industrial byproducts. Byproducts from pineapple, <b>cocoa,</b> <b>palm</b> kernel, corn gluten meal, common bean, sunflower, guava, cassava bark, cassava stems, cassava foliage, papaya, mango, passion fruit and turnips were evaluated. There were differences between the byproducts as for the potentially neutral detergent fiber (NDF) fraction and the in situ NDF degradation rate in the final volume of the gases generated by fibrous carbohydrates (FC), for the lag time and for the in vitro fractional degradation rate of the FC. There was equivalence between the dNDF values predicted in situ and those observed in vivo; however, there was low precision of estimates. The degradability in the in vitro incubation times of 30 and 48 hours presented equivalence with the values observed, but also did not present precision in the estimates. The equations fitted without lignin were not precise and accurate to estimate the dNDF of agricultural and agro-industrial byproducts. The equation with lignin and with the digestion rate obtained by the in vitro method presented more precise estimates. Byproducts from common bean, cassava bark and papaya presented greater NDF availability, whereas those of guava had the lowest NDF availability. The digestible NDF fraction was best predicted with the in situ incubation time of 72 hours.

40|$|The rapid {{expansion}} of the production of agricultural commodities such as beef, <b>cocoa,</b> <b>palm</b> oil, rubber and soybean is associated with high rates of deforestation in tropical forest landscapes. Many state, civil society and market sector actors are engaged in developing and implementing innovative interventions that aim to enhance the sustainability of commodity supply chains by affecting where and how agricultural production occurs, particularly in relation to forests. These interventions – {{in the form of}} novel or moderated institutions and policies, incentives, or information and technology – can influence producers directly or achieve their impacts indirectly by influencing consumer, retailer and processor decisions. However, the evidence base for assessing the impacts of these interventions in reducing the negative impacts of commodity agriculture production in tropical forest landscapes remains limited, and there has been little comparative analysis across commodities, cases, and countries. Further, there is little consensus of the governance mechanisms and institutional arrangements that best support such interventions. We develop a framework for analyzing commodity supply chain interventions by different actors across multiple contexts. The framework can be used to comparatively analyze interventions and their impacts on commodity production with respect to the spatial and temporal scales over which they operate, the groups of supply chain actors they affect, and the combinations of mechanisms upon which they depend. We find that the roles of actors in influencing agricultural production depends on their position and influence within the supply chain; that complementary institutions, incentives and information are often combined; and that multi-stakeholder collaborations between different groups of actors are common. We discuss how the framework can be used to characterize different interventions using a common language and structure, to aid planning and analysis of interventions, and to facilitate the evaluation of interventions with respect to their structure and outcomes. Studying the collective experience of multiple interventions across commodities and spatial contexts is necessary to generate more systematic understandings of the impacts of commodity supply chain interventions in forest-agriculture landscapes...|$|E
