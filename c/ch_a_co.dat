40|$|The primary {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to ascertain the relative importance of a multi-gas emission control strategy (in our case: CO 2 and <b>CH</b> 4) vis-à-vis <b>a</b> <b>CO</b> 2 -only abatement strategy. In other words: We want to sort out how much can be gained if we put “what”-flexibility on top of “where”- and “when”-flexibility. The explanatory power of such a comparison depends crucially on the proper design of the overall analytical framework. Therefore, we place special emphasis on the description of the baseline calibration and the integration of climate relationships into PACE, a dynamic multi-sector, multi-region computable general equilibrium (CGE) model of global trade and energy use. Based on numerical simulation with this integrated assessment model we find that “what”-flexibility substantially reduces the compliance costs under alternative emission control schemes. When comparing policies that simply involve long-term temperature targets against more stringent strategies that include additional constraints on the rate of temperature increase, it turns out that the latter involve huge additional costs. These costs may be interpreted as additional insurance payments if damages should not only dependent on absolute temperature change but also the rate of temperature change. Our calculations also confirm the shortcomings of the global warming potential (GWP) approach to represent the contribution of different greenhouse gases to global temperature change because the relative contribution may vary substantially over time.

40|$|International audienceIt {{has been}} {{suggested}} that the present release rate of methane to the Martian atmosphere could be the result of serpentinization in the deep subsurface, followed by the conversion of H 2 to <b>CH</b> 4 in <b>a</b> <b>CO</b> 2 -rich fluid. Making this assumption, we show that the cryosphere could act as a buffer storing under the form of micron-size methane clathrate particles the methane delivered from below by hydrothermal fluids and progressively releasing it to the atmosphere at the top. From an extrapolation of the present CH 4 release rate back to the past, we calculate that up to several hundred millibars (~ 200 - 2000 mbar) of CO 2, resulting from the oxidation of the released CH 4, in addition to the volcanic supply (~ 400 mbar), should have accumulated in the atmosphere in the absence of <b>a</b> <b>CO</b> 2 sink. We reassess the capability of escape to have removed CO 2 from the atmosphere by C escape, and show that it is not significant. We suggest that atmospheric carbon is recycled to the crust through an active subsurface hydrological system, and precipitates as carbonates within the crust. During episodic periods of magmatic activity, these carbonates are decomposed to CO 2 dissolved in running water, and CO 2 can react with H 2 formed by serpentinization to build CH 4. CH 4 is then buffered in the subsurface cryosphere, above the water table, and finally released to the atmosphere, before being recycled to the subsurface hydrological system, and converted back to carbonates. We propose a typical evolution curve of the CO 2 pressure since the late Noachian based on our hypothesis. Contrary to the steady state carbon cycle at work on Earth, a progressive damping of the carbon cycle occurs on Mars due to the absence of plate tectonics and the progressive cooling of the planet...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{attempts}} {{to resolve the}} faint young Sun paradox have focused on an early Earth atmosphere with elevated levels of the greenhouse gases methane (CH 4) and carbon dioxide (CO 2) that could have provided adequate warming to Earth’s surface. On Titan, the photolysis of CH 4 {{has been shown to}} create a thick haze layer that cools its surface. Unlike Titan, however, early Earth’s atmosphere likely contained high amounts of CO 2 and hydrogen (H 2). In this work, we examine haze formation in an early Earth atmosphere composed of CO 2, H 2, N 2, and <b>CH</b> 4, with <b>a</b> <b>CO</b> 2 =CH 4 ratio of 10 and a H 2 =CO 2 ratio of up to 15. To initiate aerosol formation, a broad-spectrum ultraviolet (UV) energy source with emission at Lyman-a was used to simulate the solar spectrum. Aerosol composition and total aerosol mass produced as a function of reagent gas were measured with an aerosol mass spectrometer (AMS). Results show an order of magnitude decrease in haze production with the addition of H 2, with no significant change in the chemical composition of the haze. We calculate that the presence of H 2 on early Earth could thus have favored warmer surface temperatures and yet allowed photochemical haze formation to deliver complex organic species to early Earth’s surface.

The work was part an ongoing investigation by the Molecular Energetics group on how structural changes affect the energetics of different molecular organic solids. Studies of the two known polymorphs of 4 -hydroxybenzaldehyde (chapter 3) were carried out to complement a previous investigation of 4 ’-hydroxyacetophenone and address the question of how the substitution of <b>a</b> <b>C(O)</b> <b>CH</b> 3 by <b>a</b> <b>C(O)</b> H group influenced polymorphism in hydroxybenzoil derivatives. This also {{led to the development of}} a methodology for the selective and reproducible preparation of the two 4 -hydroxybenzaldehyde polymorphs and the determination of their stability domains represented in a Gibbs energy vs. temperature phase diagram. Simvastatin was structurally and energetically characterized from ambient temperature to the liquid state. The variation of its crystal structure with temperature, for the sub-ambient range, was also analyzed. These studies (chapters 4 and 5) led to the conclusion that previously reported phase transitions did not imply polymorphism (at least in the classical sense of the term) and were simply related to variations in the rotational freedom of the ester group present in simvastatin and not with crystal modifications. The thermal oxidative decomposition of simvastatin (chapter 6) was also studied. The main decomposition products were identified and the work conditions that can be used to prevent decomposition were determined. Finally (chapter 7), some exploratory studies to investigate if the solubility of simvastatin could be improved through the preparation of mixtures/dispersions in polyethylene glycols were also performed. This also included tests of the effect of compression on the stability of prepared materials, since compression is normally a fundamental step in the production of tablets.

E. <b>Ch.</b> <b>A),</b> one of {{the oldest}} organizations of the Chicano movement. History shows that M. E. <b>Ch.</b> <b>A</b> has been able to reflect on itself and change accordingly; thus, it has been able to stay alive due to internal debates from the 1960 s to the 1990 s. In the 1960 s, male, heterosexual Mexicans dominated the Chicano movement. In the 1980 s, Xicanas challenged them to look past their privileges into more intersectional, inclusive identities. My research question is: in 2013, how do Californian MEChistAs view themselves, their political consciousness, and their social justice work? MEChistAs view themselves as an inclusive, diverse, and progressive organization. Chican@/Xican@ is a political identity and ideology that includes women, queers, and non-Mexicans. Women and queers took leadership of the organization, which shows that the revised historical documents made a difference. However, M. E. <b>Ch.</b> <b>A</b> continues a Mexican-centric organization that isolates Central Americans, South Americans, and Afro-Latin@s. M. E. <b>Ch.</b> <b>A</b> has changed since the 1960 s in many ways, but the work continues. M. E. <b>Ch.</b> <b>A</b> still needs to address several internal debates as an organization, such as: Aztlán’s meanings, community versus campus organizing, generational gaps, and working with social organizations. Despite these debates, M. E. <b>Ch.</b> <b>A</b> has survived. Using 22 in-depth interviews with contemporary MEChistAs in California from 10 different universities, I examined the identities and politics of M. E. <b>Ch.</b> <b>A</b> activists.

Cheese analogue (<b>Ch</b> <b>A)</b> treatments were enriched with C. vulgaris (1, 2 and 3 %) and evaluated for chemical, physical and sensory properties, within three months of cold storage. Chlorella biomass cheeses were richer in the protein, carbohydrates and fiber contents than control samples. On the other hand, addition of Chlorella biomass to the cheese gave products more firmness and gives a stronger network and leads to lower oil separation and meltability values than control. The sensory evaluation indicated that addition of 2 % C. vulgaris in <b>Ch</b> <b>A</b> did not have any effect on the overall acceptability of <b>Ch</b> <b>A</b> and in the same time introduced a new healthy alternative <b>Ch</b> <b>A</b> for a healthier lifestyle.

40|$|Asthma is a {{disorder}} of increasing severity and prevalence. Recent {{knowledge about the}} pathogenesis of asthma emphasizes its inflammatory nature. CpG oligonucleotides are a class of compounds containing motifs based on the cytosine-guanine dinucleotides (CpG-ODNs). These motifs are suppressed in mammalian DNA. They induce inflammation in mammals characterized by the induction of T helper type 1 and regulatory responses. In this paper, the effect of CpG DNA co-administration with a homemade Chenopodium album (<b>Ch.</b> <b>a)</b> extract in a murine model of asthma is reported for the first time. Balb/C mice were sensitized using <b>Ch.</b> <b>a.</b> pollen allergenic extract plus CpG-ODNs intraperitoneally and were challenged with aerosolized allergen. Results measured included IL- 10 and IFN-gamma cytokines as well as IgG subclasses. For this, splenocytes from mice treated with CpG/Ag or Ag alone, were cultured {{in the presence of}} antigen. The results showed that CpG ODN administered at the time of <b>Ch.</b> <b>a</b> sensitization, effectively increased cytokines and IgG 2 a/IgG 1 ratios compared with those in mice treated with antigen  or with PBS alone(P≤ 0. 001). Our experiments revealed that <b>Ch.</b> <b>a.</b> sensitization decreased IgG 2 a/IgG 1 compared with non-sensitized mice (P≤ 0. 001), while CpG ODN/Ch. a reversed this ratio, indicating CpG potentials towards IgG 2 a subclass switching. We conclude that Co- administration of <b>Ch.</b> <b>a.</b> allergen and CpG ODN prevents the development of TH 2 -mediated response probably through the IL- 10 regulatory effects. Thus, these components could be used with the other allergens in order to induce the prevention of inflammatory conditions.
