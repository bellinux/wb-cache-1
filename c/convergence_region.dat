5000|$|This rule {{may be true}} under a few special circumstances, {{otherwise}} it is false. By standing with one's back to the ground-level wind and observing {{the movement of the}} clouds, it is possible to determine whether the weather will improve or deteriorate. For the Northern Hemisphere, it works like this: If the upper-level clouds are moving from the right, a low-pressure area has passed and the weather will improve; if from the left, a low pressure area is arriving and the weather will deteriorate. (Reverse for the Southern Hemisphere.) This is known as the [...] "crossed-winds" [...] rule. Clouds traveling parallel to but against the wind may indicate a thunderstorm approaching. Outflow winds typically blow opposite to the updraft zone, and clouds carried in the upper level wind will appear to be moving against the surface wind. However, if such a storm is in the offing, {{it is not necessary to}} observe the cloud motions to know rain is a good possibility. The nature of airflows directly at a frontal boundary can also create conditions in which lower winds contradict the motions of upper clouds, and the passage of a frontal boundary is often marked by precipitation. Most often, however, this situation occurs in the lee of a low pressure area, to the north of the frontal zones and <b>convergence</b> <b>region,</b> and does not indicate a change in weather, but rather, that the weather, fair or showery, will remain so for a period of hours at least.|$|E

Delineation of the <b>regions</b> of <b>convergence</b> of this multimodal algorithm has remained as an unresolved problem {{in spite of its}} significance with regard to CMA initialization strategies. In this paper we present a qualitative analysis of <b>convergence</b> <b>regions</b> of the fractionally spaced CMA (FS-CMA) equalizer based on a new geometrical understanding of the constant modulus cost function. We characterize the location and volume of the <b>convergence</b> <b>regions</b> of local minima, and associate the volume of the <b>convergence</b> <b>regions</b> with their MSE performance. The <b>convergence</b> <b>regions</b> of the local minima with low noise gain expand near origin, while those of the local minima with high noise gain shrink.

40|$|Power flow study plays a {{fundamental}} {{role in the}} process of power system operation and planning. Of the several methods in commercial power flow package, the Newton-Raphson (NR) method is the most popular one. In this paper, we numerically study the <b>convergence</b> <b>region</b> of each power flow solution under the NR method. This study of <b>convergence</b> <b>region</b> provides insights of the complexity of the NR method in finding power flow solutions. Our numerical studies confirm that the <b>convergence</b> <b>region</b> of NR method has a fractal boundary and find that this fractal boundary of convergence regions persists under different loading conditions. In addition, the convergence regions of NR method for power flow equations with different nonlinear load models are also fractal. This fractal property highlights the importance of choosing initial guesses since a small variation of an initial guess near the convergence boundary leads to two different power flow solutions.

The parameter $c$ {{is used to}} adjust and control the <b>convergence</b> <b>region</b> and rate of the resulting series solution.

Furthermore, a numerical approach for finding the optimal value of the convergence-control parameter is given. At the same time, it is found that the traditional Adomian decomposition method is only a special case of the new method. The effectiveness and applicability of the new technique are demonstrated by several physical models including nonlinear heat transfer problems, nano-electromechanical systems, diffusion and dissipation phenomena, and dispersive waves. Moreover, the ideas proposed in this paper may offer us possibilities to greatly improve current analytic and numerical techniques. Comment: 15 page, 7 figure...|$|E
