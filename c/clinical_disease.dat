This is believed to be a rare event, but outbreaks of vaccine-associated paralytic poliomyelitis (VAPP), caused by a circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus (cVDPV), have been reported, and tend to occur in areas of low coverage by OPV, presumably because the OPV is itself protective against the related outbreak strain.|$|E

25|$|As well as {{attempting}} to find disease-modifying agents for osteoarthritis, there is emerging {{evidence that a}} system-based approach is necessary to find the causes of osteoarthritis. Changes may occur before <b>clinical</b> <b>disease</b> is evident due to abnormalities in biomechanics, biology or structure of joints that predispose them to develop <b>clinical</b> <b>disease.</b> Research is thus focusing on defining these early pre-osteoarthritis changes using biological, mechanical, and imaging markers of osteoarthritis risk, emphasising multi-disciplinary approaches, and looking into personalized interventions that can reverse osteoarthritis risk in healthy joints before the disease becomes evident.|$|E

40|$|Objective: In {{thalassemia}} major, extramedulary hematopoiesis {{results in}} bony deformities such as sever malocclusion {{in the head}} and neck, delayed pneumatization of paranasal sinuses and so on. Also, there are many systemic and iatrogenic problems that may affect the head and neck region. The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine otorhinolaryngologic manifestations as <b>clinical</b> <b>diseases</b> in thalassemia major patients. Material & Methods: In a cross sectional study 190 thalassemia major patients were evaluated (by history and physical examination) for snoring, epistaxis, nasal obstruction, sinusitis, temporomandibular joint (TMJ) pain and TMJ dislocation, tinnitus and hearing loss. Radiological studies of the skull and paranasal sinuses and audiological tests were performed. The data was analyzed in different age groups with chi 2 test. Findings: Relative frequency of some otorhinolaryngologic manifestations in this population was high. The differences between some <b>clinical</b> <b>diseases</b> as TMJ pain, and epistaxis in different age groups were statistically significant. Conclusion: Thalassemia major increases some <b>clinical</b> <b>diseases</b> in the Otolarygology field. With early diagnosis and early treatment many of them may be prevented...|$|R

25|$|As noted above, {{there are}} many {{different}} kinds of DNA sequence variation, ranging from complete extra or missing chromosomes down to single nucleotide changes. It is generally presumed that much naturally occurring genetic variation in human populations is phenotypically neutral, i.e. has little or no detectable effect on the physiology of the individual (although there may be fractional differences in fitness defined over evolutionary time frames). Genetic disorders can be caused by any or all known types of sequence variation. To molecularly characterize a new genetic disorder, it is necessary to establish a causal link between a particular genomic sequence variant and the <b>clinical</b> <b>disease</b> under investigation.

25|$|Mutations of the HFE gene {{account for}} 90% {{of the cases}} of non-transfusional iron overload. This gene is {{closely linked to the}} HLA-A3 locus. Homozygosity for the C282Y {{mutation}} is the most common genotype responsible for clinical iron accumulation, though heterozygosity for C282Y/H63D mutations, so-called compound heterozygotes, results in clinically evident iron overload. There is considerable debate regarding the penetrance—the probability of clinical expression of the trait given the genotype—is for <b>clinical</b> <b>disease</b> in HHC homozygotes. Most, if not all, males homozygous for HFE C282Y will show manifestations of liver dysfunction such as elevated liver-specific enzymes such as serum gamma glutamyltransferase (GGT) by late middle age. Homozygous females can delay the onset of iron accumulation because of iron loss through menstruation.|$|E

Medi-ports, similar to ports used to administer chemotherapy drugs, were surgically placed into the twins' chest walls and allow doctors to directly infuse HPbCD into their bloodstreams.

25|$|Coccidioidomycosis* is a {{fungal disease}} caused by Coccidioides immitis or Coccidioides posadasii that affects {{a variety of}} species, {{including}} dogs. In dogs signs of primary pulmonary disease include a cough, fever, weight loss, anorexia, and lethargy. Disseminated disease occurs when the fungus has spread outside of the lungs and may include clinical signs such as lameness, pain, seizures, anterior uveitis, and localized swelling. Diagnosis of Valley Fever may include multiple tests, including serology and radiology. According to a study performed in the Tucson and Phoenix area, 28% of dogs will test positive for exposure to the fungus by two years of age, but only 6% of the dogs will be ill with <b>clinical</b> <b>disease.</b> There is {{an increased risk of}} infection associated with amount of time spent outdoors, a larger roaming space accessed by the dog, and increasing age.|$|E

25|$|The main way {{to prevent}} malaria is through vector control. There are mostly three main forms that the vector can be controlled: (1)insecticide-treated {{mosquito}} nets, (2)indoor residual spraying and (3)antimalarial drugs. Long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLNs) are the preferred method of control {{because it is the}} most cost effective. The WHO is currently strategizing how to ensure that the net is properly maintained to protect people at risk. The second option is indoor residual spraying and has been proven effective if at least 80% of the homes are sprayed. However, such method is only effective for 3-6months. A drawback to these two methods, unfortunately, is that mosquito resistance against these insecticides has risen. National malaria control efforts are undergoing rapid changes to ensure the people are given the most effective method of vector control. Lastly, antimalarial drugs {{can also be used to}} prevent infection from developing into a <b>clinical</b> <b>disease.</b> However, there has also been an increase resistance to antimalarial medicine.|$|E
25|$|Obligate myiasis {{of various}} forms {{are typical of}} the oestrid genera.

Larval Oestrus nasal-bots infest the nasal cavities of sheep and goats. In the case of stomach-bots it is often uncertain how much <b>clinical</b> <b>disease</b> or loss of production small levels of infestation causes the host. With infestations of warble-flies and nasal-bots severe distress to the hosts may be caused and there are production losses from reduction of value of cattle hides, and reduced grazing time by sheep.

40|$|Objectives: Trefoil factor 3 (TFF 3) {{is a small}} peptide {{that plays}} an {{important}} role in mucosal protection, cell proliferation, and cell migration. The aberrant expression of TFF 3 is correlated with gastrointestinal inflammation, solid tumors, and other <b>clinical</b> <b>diseases.</b> The objective of this study was to identify the distribution characteristics of serum TFF 3 in common <b>clinical</b> <b>diseases.</b> Materials and Methods: A large prospective randomized study of 1, 072 Chinese patients was performed using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to examine the serum TFF 3 concentrations in patients with different diseases. A matched case-control study was conducted on patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) stages 1 – 5. Immunohistochem-istry (IHC) was performed using renal tissues to determine the relationship between the severity of CKD and the serum and urine concentrations of TFF 3 peptides. Results: The mean serum concentrations of TFF 3 in patients with CKD, metastatic and secondary carcinoma (MC) and acute gastroenteritis (AG) (200. 9 ng/ml, 95. 7 ng/ml and 71. 7 ng/ml, respectively) were significantly higher than those in patients with other common <b>clinical</b> <b>diseases.</b> A positive correlation tendency was observed between the serum TFF 3 concentrations and the severity of CKD. The mean serum TFF 3 values for CKD stages 1 – 5 were 23. 6 ng/ml, 29. 9 ng/ml, 54. 9 ng/ml, 85. 0 ng/ ml and 176. 6 ng/ml, respectively.

2500|$|There are {{a number}} of {{problems}} with serological testing: in highly endemic areas, not everyone who becomes infected will actually develop <b>clinical</b> <b>disease</b> or require treatment.

[...] Conversely, because serological tests look for an immune response and not for the organism itself, the test does not become negative after the patient is cured, it cannot be used as a check for cure, or to check for re-infection or relapse.
