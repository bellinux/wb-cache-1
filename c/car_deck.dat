50|$|The vessel has 13 <b>car</b> <b>decks,</b> {{of which}} 4 are hoistable (most are hoisted using a deck lifter, some are hoisted using wires). The vessel also has 2 center ramps {{on the port}} and {{starboard}} side, but these are rarely used.|$|R
25|$|On 6 March 1987, the Townsend-Thoresen branded {{car ferry}} Herald of Free Enterprise capsized just outside Zeebrugge's harbour about 25 minutes after departure. A {{subsequent}} inquiry {{determined that the}} ship's bow doors had been left open allowing water to get onto the <b>car</b> <b>deck.</b> 193 people {{died as a result}} of the sinking.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 1960s the Finland Steamship Company decided to {{construct}} a 5,171 gross register ton ship for the Finland—Sweden service the company operated in collaboration with Steamship Company Bore, Rederi AB Svea, and Siljavarustamo, a joint subsidiary of the three companies. For {{the first time in}} Finland SS Co's history, the new ship was fitted with diesel engines and included side-loadable <b>car</b> <b>deck</b> for 50 cars. Her service speed was planned at , and she was to carry 1000 passengers, 332 of them in two classes with berths and the rest as classless deck passengers.|$|E
25|$|Most {{passenger}} spaces on the Superspeed 1 {{are located on}} decks 7 and 8, above the multi-deck <b>car</b> <b>deck</b> complex and storage rooms. A two-deck high atrium is located by the entrance amidship. The forward part of deck 7 houses a large tax free shop, with smaller shops located around the atrium. An arcade connects the atrium to a two-deck high bar/lounge complex located {{at the rear of}} decks 7 and 8. A business lounge is located next to the bar/lounge complex on deck 8, while another arcade connects them to the three restaurants that occupy the rest of deck 8. An additional sitting lounge is located on deck 9.|$|E

50|$|M.V.(Motor Vessel)Heroic ace has 13 <b>car</b> <b>decks,</b> {{including}} movable decks. The decks {{are moved}} using a hydraulic deck lifter {{which is part}} of the ship's equipment and operated by the ships officers. The vessel plies on a world wide route, and has traded in North America, Europe, Asia and Africa.|$|R
25|$|The Ilmatars {{original}} {{interior layout}} was {{a compromise between}} the traditional two-class passenger liner and the new ro-ro car/passenger ferry. In order to transport cars she was fitted with a gate on the port side, from where cars were driven inside the ship and then lifted mechanically to the actual <b>car</b> <b>deck.</b> This arrangement was already out of date when the ship was delivered, as Finland SS Co.'s subsidiary Siljavarustamo had taken the delivery of the first ro-ro ferry with bow and rear gates on the North Baltic already in 1961. An extra cardeck was added on the ship coinciding with the 1973 lengthening, but that too was served by the side gate and a lift.|$|E
25|$|North Vancouver No. 5 {{was built}} in Coal Harbour by Boeing Shipyards in 1941. She ran {{faithfully}} with her Union Diesel until 1958 when she was tied up {{at the foot of}} Lonsdale Ave along with North Vancouver Ferry No. 4. Capt. Jesse Oliver Kinnie, a North Vancouver Ferry employee, looked into the possibility of purchasing North Vancouver Ferry No. 4 and running it on the same route as she had run all her life. She had a higher height clearance on the <b>car</b> <b>deck</b> than Ferry No. 5 and was faster. The numbers did not add up and the plan was abandoned. Ferry No. 4 also ran on a Union Diesel.|$|E
25|$|In {{a similar}} incident, on August 13, 1992, the same vessel {{pulled out of}} its berth at the Departure Bay {{terminal}} while vehicle loading ramps were still lowered and resting on the ship. Three people were killed, including two children, one was seriously injured, and two others received minor injuries when a van from Alberta containing 6 people fell 15 m (about 50ft) from the upper deck onto the lower <b>car</b> <b>deck</b> and finally into the sea below. The van had been stopped and instructed to wait on the loading ramp by terminal crew members. The Transportation Safety Board of Canada determined that the accident {{was caused by the}} vessel not properly following departing procedures and secondarily due to poor communication between terminal and ship crew members.|$|E
50|$|The seven ships {{constructed}} {{were soon}} modified to increase vehicle capacity twice. The first refit was {{the installation of}} ramps and platform <b>car</b> <b>decks,</b> the second refit saw the ships sliced in half vertically across the beam for the insertion of a new 84 ft midsection, which dramatically increased their capacity.|$|R
50|$|Unlike her quasi-sister ships, Jupiter and Juno, Saturns {{bridge was}} {{constructed}} one deck above the upper passenger deck, giving passenger access right round {{the front of}} the ship, allowing views directly over the bow. Saturn did not have the large mast structure fitted above the <b>car</b> <b>decks</b> of her quasi-sisters.|$|R

The 14-ton cargo lift had space for five average cars, which were turned on two 14-foot turntables on the lift and a further one {{at the front of}} the [...] "garage". An aft cargo hold had two 7-ton derricks for cargo handling. These were removed in 1958 and the hold plated over, to provide additional <b>car</b> <b>deck</b> area.|$|E

2500|$|All three ships {{built for}} the UK–Sweden service were based on an {{essentially}} traditional concept with subdued and luxurious interior fittings and without full-height <b>car</b> <b>decks,</b> with a service speed of [...] Rederi AB Svea's Svea was launched from drydock on 3 March 1966, and delivered to her owners on 27 October of the same year.|$|R
2500|$|MV Cowal [...] was {{virtually}} identical to her older sister, [...] Cowal {{was the first}} Clyde vessel to enter service with radar. Passenger accommodation consisted of a large lounge and a tearoom above, and a bar below, the <b>car</b> <b>deck.</b> The bridge was above the upper deck, allowing passengers unobstructed views forward. Officer and crew accommodation was below the bridge and at the stern.

2500|$|New designs, the [...] "citadel concept" [...] {{once again}} {{influenced}} by Estonia, aim to ensure damaged ships have sufficient buoyancy to remain afloat, though cost will determine if any are built.

25|$|SF Line's latest newbuilding was the Aurella, {{delivered}} to the company in 1973. The Aurella was of {{a new breed of}} ferries crossing the Baltic, she had two decks of public spaces along with two separate <b>car</b> <b>decks.</b> Inspired by the success of the Aurella, the newbuildings' design resembled her closely although more cabins and larger public spaces were added.|$|R
2500|$|On May 12, 2003, Queen of Surrey was {{disabled}} as {{a result}} of an engine room fire. [...] Queen of Capilano was dispatched and tethered to [...] Queen of Surrey while tugboats were dispatched. The vessel was then towed back to shore. None of the 318 passengers were injured, but several crew members were treated for minor injuries. Some buckling of the main <b>car</b> <b>deck</b> resulted from the heat of the fire, but no vehicles were damaged in the incident.|$|E
2500|$|The {{new ship}} was planned {{together}} with her contracted builders, Meyer Werft, Papenburg in West Germany. This shipyard [...] had built the Apollo and the Diana for Slite as well as four sister vessels for Rederi Ab Sally. The design greatly resembled the former ships but the newbuilding was larger in every respect. Among the distinguishing differences were {{the addition of a}} second <b>car</b> <b>deck</b> as well as a larger number of berths. The new ship was named M/S Diana II af Slite and launching took place on March 31, 1979.|$|E
2500|$|The Diana IIs large <b>car</b> <b>deck</b> on deck 4 {{was during}} the 1980s deemed to be larger than {{necessary}} and of its port side was rebuilt with additional cabins. In preparations of her entry into EstLine service in 1994, the ship received its most extensive modification to date. Apart from the sealing of the bow visor a [...] "duck tail" [...] was added at the stern. Also, the ship's funnel was once again rebuilt to sport a more solid look. The bow remained inaccessible until its complete rebuilding prior to the ships entry into the Tallinn—Helsinki service in 1996.|$|E
5000|$|Built {{to carry}} RoRo cargoes and containers, the ship {{initially}} had a tonnage of 27,990 GT. [...] In 2008 Taiko was {{converted to a}} vehicle carrier in China, resulting in an increase to 66,532 GT. In addition to its <b>car</b> <b>decks,</b> loaded and unloaded through a ramp with 400 tonnes carrying capacity (via a 6.4 m high and 12.5 m wide hatch), it has two hoistable decks.|$|R
25|$|In January–April 2000, Queen of Scandinavia was rebuilt by Remontowa in Gdynia, Poland, with rear {{sponsons}} and, again, a new sleeker bow. The new bow {{is especially}} notable {{due to the}} fact that it has no gate or visor, hence the ship's <b>car</b> <b>decks</b> can now only be loaded/unloaded from the rear. Also, a new marine evacuation system was added on deck 9. All the other life rafts were removed, and the new evacuation system features a chute instead.|$|R
2500|$|From {{early on}} the ELS service faced fierce {{competition}} from Tor Line, who had also initiated a UK–Sweden service in 1966. Unlike the ELS ships, Tor Line's [...] and [...] featured modern furnishings, full-height <b>car</b> <b>decks</b> and had a service speed of [...] Possibly due to {{the high level of}} competition Rederi AB Svea decided to withdraw from the joint UK–Sweden service in March 1968, when Svea was sold to Swedish Lloyd for a delivery in 1969.|$|R
