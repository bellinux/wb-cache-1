50|$|The lead {{goes into}} the vein and heart and will grow into the heart wall over time. This may {{increase}} the chance of complications if the lead system needs to be removed or replaced, as the procedure to extract a <b>cardiac</b> <b>lead</b> can be a challenge. Because the lead needs {{to go into the}} heart it needs to be relatively thin and flexible, since it has to pass through (and remain in) the heart valve(s) and needs to flex with every heartbeat. This makes the lead more vulnerable to lead fracture (and therefore complications). Due to the position of the pulse generator under the collarbone, it can be more visible with certain clothing.|$|E
40|$|Delayed cardiac {{perforation}} is {{a serious}} medical condition where an implanted <b>cardiac</b> <b>lead</b> migrates through the heart wall, causing life-threatening complications. Where acute perforation occurs during implant, delayed perforation is not detected until after 30 days from implant and is frequently not diagnosed until complications are present. The phenomenon is particularly prevalent in cardiac leads with active helices. Detailed here is a test method that subjects leads to cyclic loading in an environment {{similar to that of}} the human heart. A test setup was developed; leads migrate through a degradable cardiac simulant for a fixed cycle count, after which the simulant is evaluated. Initial testing was conducted and improvements made to the device. Nineteen <b>cardiac</b> <b>lead</b> models were tested and ranked in three metrics related to perforation damage. Trends matched available medical knowledge on lead perforation risk. This experiment provides a framework for further investigation into lead perforation. by Matthew J. Rosario. Thesis (S. M.)

Magnitude of lead deflection depends on cardiac muscle contraction forces. The {{purpose of this}} study was to measure the charge generated due to triboelectric effect between one of the lead conductors and the inserted stylet. The charge wasmeasured by a differential charge amplifier being connected to an isolation amplifier and power supply. Sensor signal, ECG, and intracardiac electrograms were acquired. Threemodels of customdesigned leads were implanted in eight sheep. Measurements were done in 18 patients undergoing pacemaker implantation and replacement procedures. Atrial and ventricular tensiometric signals were recorded in dual chamber and in single-lead ventricular diastolic dysfunction patients. Recordings in sinus rhythm at various atrioventricular intervals and in supraventricular tachycardia were done. On average, charge variation between 1 and 600 pC was measured. Tensiometric stylet could be feasible hemodynamic sensor for myocardial contraction detection. Its main advantage is that it is easily exchangeable and universal for all leads...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} our study was to {{investigate}} variety of <b>cardiac</b> <b>lead</b> conductor designs as high-frequency (HF) transmission lines. Special attention was given on evaluation of chronic HF applications in cardiac electrotherapy. We measured the characteristic impedance and the attenuation coefficient of six pacing leads between 1 and 21 MHz. They were subsequently immersed into the saline solution simulating the body fluid and the measurements were repeated 10 years later. Identical measurements were performed on 15 new pacing and defibrillation leads. The results revealed that lead geometry is the main factor affecting the HF parameters. Attenuation coefficients of old and contemporary leads do not differ significantly. Penetration of saline within the leads during a decade did not influence much their HF characteristics. Thus, a chronic cardiac contraction sensor based on lead’s HF impedance variation is feasible. The signal losses of ultrasonic transducers mounted on the lead might be stable for years at acceptable levels without significant variation. Due to mutually similar values of HF parameters in different leads, design of tensiometric or ultrasonic applications could be universal for majority of commercially available leads. Automatic system calibration could be developed for each and every lead after determination of its HF parameters...|$|E
40|$|In silico {{clinical}} trials, {{defined as}} “The use of individualized computer simulation {{in the development}} or regulatory evaluation of a medicinal product, medical device, or medical intervention,” have been proposed as a possible strategy to reduce the regulatory costs of innovation and the time to market for biomedical products. We review some of the the literature on this topic, focusing in particular on those applications where the current practice is recognized as inadequate, as for example, the detection of unexpected severe adverse events too rare to be detected in a clinical trial, but still likely enough to be of concern. We then describe with more details two case studies, two successful applications of in silico clinical trial approaches, one relative to the University of Virginia/Padova simulator that the Food and Drug Administration has accepted as possible replacement for animal testing in the preclinical assessment of artificial pancreas technologies, and the second, {{an investigation of the}} probability of <b>cardiac</b> <b>lead</b> fracture, where a Bayesian network was used to combine in vivo and in silico observations, suggesting a whole new strategy of in silico-augmented clinical trials, to be used to increase the numerosity where recruitment is impossible, or to explore patients’ phenotypes that are unlikely to appear in the trial cohort, but are still frequent enough to be of concern. ...|$|E
40|$|Fort Wayne Metals is {{interested}} in developing a new machine to experimentally test fatigue strength of various metal wiring manufactured by their company. The test rotates a wire while arced so that the peak experiences equal amount of tension and compressive loading until the sample breaks from cyclic loading. The wiring has {{a wide range of}} applications from industrial cable used in military helicopters to a more apparent use, medical wiring which includes neurostimulation and <b>cardiac</b> <b>lead</b> wire. The company has specifically requested the design of this system have more functional components integrated unlike their more primitive machines currently in use. This includes, but is not limited to, an integrated bath design to wet test samples in a circulating saline solution with a calibrated way to adjust the arc dimensions of the sample. Electronically, Fort Wayne Metals also requests a functional user interface to program test duration in terms of cycle count that the wire experiences. Likewise, the end design requires a form of break detection if the sample fails before the test duration is completed and an appropriate method of kill switching the motor as well as recording the cycle count at time of failure. Additional specific considerations regarding test conditions and housing have also been specified by the company.

40|$|Abstract-An {{electrocardiogram}} (ECG) {{compression technique}} based on subband coding {{has been developed}} in this paper to compare with compression techniques based on Wavelet Packets (WP). The filter bank designed is a cosine-modulated pseudo-QMF bank using the Kaiser Window Approach (KWA) method {{that does not have}} the perfect reconstruction (PR) property, as opposed to WP that are implemented by means of a PR filter bank. In both schemes, the coding process is the same to be able to compare the results. This is carried out using a very easy algorithm based on a thresholding technique, which provides good compression rate. Its main application is to encode long-term registers of digitized electrocardiogram signal, {{in order to reduce the}} bit rate. To preserve the reconstructed signal accuracy, the percentage root-mean-square difference (PRD) is used as an objective measurement parameter, which is selected before compression. The tests have been done for the twelve principal <b>cardiac</b> <b>leads,</b> and the compression degree measurement is evaluated by means of the mean number of bits per sample (MBPS) and the compression ratio (CR).

For patient data, the proposed method is first evaluated in a high statistic (20 min scans) dual gating study of 21 patients. It is shown that the proposed approach properly corrects PET images for dual-cardiac as well as respiratory-motion. In a second study the list mode data of the same patients is cropped to a scan time reasonable for clinical practice (3 min).
