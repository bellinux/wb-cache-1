Toronto Review states that [...] "a new aesthetic of magical realism, Jiang deftly defies {{the gravity of}} linear storytelling to produce sheer visual poetry. This gallery of lavishly <b>composed</b> <b>frames</b> may seem to follow an irrational logic but, in the end, the imagery is as rare and precious as velvet was scarce in the isolated China the film so vividly depicts." [...] The Hollywood Reporter wrote [...] "Fluid motion and glorious colors provide a visual treat in Jiang Wen's sumptuous romantic fantasy... besides being wonderful to look at, The Sun Also Rises is great fun, with sure-handed performances."

50|$|Core Video {{provides}} both a buffering {{model and}} a playback synchronization solution within its processing pipeline. A video source provides a decompressed data stream to be rendered as images within a visual context in Quartz 2D. Core Video {{can be thought}} of as the link between this video source and its display context. Rendered images can be further processed by Core Image before being composed into a final scene with Quartz Compositor. As part of the composition process, Core Video maintains a frame buffer, keeping a pool of rendered, <b>composed</b> <b>frames</b> ready for playback. To ensure smooth playback, Core Video uses a high-priority thread to maintain its frame buffer. This display link runs independently from the application which invokes video playback, and it compensates for different display refresh rates and latency.|$|R

The whole package is still pretty good, but it’s difficult to ignore that particular misstep." ... That aside, {{this is a pretty}} decent horror experience. The film runs a little long, but part of that is due to the film’s patience. The film isn’t just trying to shock people. It builds atmosphere and constructs horrific situations that are meant to genuinely disturb. It isn’t just about ghosts popping out of nowhere. It’s more about the creeping realization that there are some things in this world that aren’t quite right, {{and people are going to}} get hurt because of it. Laranas’ meticulously <b>composed</b> <b>frames</b> make great use of the interplay between light and shadow, setting up an eerie atmosphere that permeates every second of the film.....|$|R

50|$|In the {{construction}} of a wooden-hulled ship, the futtocks are the separate pieces of timber which <b>compose</b> the <b>frame</b> of the ship. There are four futtocks (component parts of the rib), and occasionally five, to a ship. Those next to the keel are called ground-futtocks, or navel-futtocks, and the rest are termed upper futtocks. The word itself is derived from a contraction of 'foot hook', indicating their role in providing a secure framework to a ship.|$|R
40|$|Built-up {{members of}} cold-formed steel (CFS) {{profiles}} {{were tested in}} 4 -point bending. CFS profiles (generally thin-walled) deform considerably under load, and the deformed configuration {{is a result of}} the superposition of different buckling mode shapes. Local buckling propagates through the profile walls; during distortional buckling parts of the cross-section rotate around a web-flange juncture. Alongside the buckling effects, the overall deformation of the member is considerable. To study these slender and relatively long members, a sufficient number of measuring positions on the specimens is needed. Often, this is not feasible with the conventional measuring techniques. An optical measuring device was used to record the movement of a large number of points per specimen. The obtained results are placed in a 3 D coordinate system and can be exported for further data processing. The goal of the measurement campaign was to calibrate a Finite Element model that will simulate the tests. The model will be used for the analysis of <b>composed</b> <b>frame</b> members of CFS profiles, whose design is not entirely covered by the European Standard [1]. After calibration, the FEA predicts the performance of these built-up members well. status: publishe...|$|R

The light bands across the photograph are an artifact, the result of sunlight scattering off parts of the camera and its sunshade, due to the relative proximity between the Sun and the Earth.

Detailed analysis suggested that the camera also detected the Moon, although it is too faint to be visible without special processing.|$|R
40|$|Abstract The {{opinions}} about the European Union vary considerably between the member states. There are likely several reasons of this, the following study examines one that ought {{to play a major}} role. This study examines the idea that media affects the public opinion. According to the theory of Framing media can not only tell us what to think about, media also has the power to influence how we think about the matter. “Framing: Toward Clarification of a fractured paradigm” by Robert M. Entman works as a main influence of this study. Entman suggests that frames promote a particular problem definition, causal interpretation, moral evaluation, and/or treatment recommendation for the item described. The aim of the study is to analyse how the European Union is depicted in German and Austrian newspapers. To find underlying frames in the chosen 114 articles, a comparative qualitative textanalysis has been used. The four, by Entman suggested, items that <b>compose</b> <b>frames</b> were searched, analysed and compared. The result concludes that different frames occur in German and Austrian newspapers. The various EU-opinions in the two countries could with other words partly be due to different kinds of media reports. Nyckelord: Framing, EU, media, allmänna opinionen, medias effek...|$|R
