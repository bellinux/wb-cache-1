5|$|Foreign comics, {{especially}} Japanese, {{became quite}} successful in Canada, and stood out for gaining {{large numbers of}} female fans, who had traditionally stayed away from comic books. They also had a significant influence on artists such as Bryan Lee O'Malley and his Scott Pilgrim series. Due to differing social norms, the content of these comics are sometimes censored or ran afoul of Canadian customs officials. Incidental nudity <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>interpreted</b> by them as child pornography and result in jail terms.|$|E
5|$|In a study, eight addax antelopes {{on a diet}} {{of grass}} hay (Chloris gayana) were studied to {{determine}} the retention time of food from the digestive tract. It was found that food retention time was long, taken as an adaptation to a diet including {{a high proportion of}} slow fermenting grasses; while the long fluid retention time <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>interpreted</b> to be due to water-saving mechanisms with low water turnover and a roomy rumen.|$|E

5|$|These {{numbers are}} (by ancient standards) consistent, and this <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>interpreted</b> {{that a number}} around 1,200 is correct. Among modern {{scholars}} some have accepted this number, although suggesting that the number must have been lower by the Battle of Salamis. Other recent works on the Persian Wars reject this number1,207 being seen {{as more of a}} reference to the combined Greek fleet in the Iliadand generally claim that the Persians could have launched no more than around 600 warships into the Aegean.|$|E
5|$|On {{behalf of}} Somersett, it was argued that while colonial laws might permit slavery, neither {{the common law}} of England, nor any law made by Parliament {{recognised}} the existence of slavery, and slavery was therefore illegal. Moreover, English contract law did not allow for any person to enslave himself, nor could any contract be binding without the person's consent. The arguments thus focused on legal details rather than humanitarian principles. A law passed in 1765 said that all lands, forts and slaves owned by the Africa Company were a property of the Crown, which <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>interpreted</b> to mean that the Crown accepted slavery. When the two lawyers for Charles Stewart put their case, they argued that a contract {{for the sale of}} a slave was recognised in England, and therefore the existence of slaves must be legally valid.|$|E
5|$|The motif {{has many}} {{historical}} meanings. First, {{as a scientific}} and secular motif, it was only an astrological and zodiacal symbol. Under the Safavid and the first Qajar kings, it became more associated with Shia Islam. During the Safavid era, the lion and sun stood for the two pillars of society, {{the state and the}} Islamic religion. It became a national emblem during the Qajar era. In the 19th century, European visitors at the Qajar court attributed the lion and sun to remote antiquity; since then, it has acquired a nationalistic interpretation. During the reign of Fat′h-Ali Shah Qajar and his successors, the form of the motif was substantially changed. A crown was also placed {{on the top of the}} symbol to represent the monarchy. Beginning in the reign of Fat′h-Ali, the Islamic aspect of the monarchy was de-emphasized. This shift affected the symbolism of the emblem. The meaning of the symbol changed several times between the Qajar era and the 1979 revolution. The lion <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>interpreted</b> as a metaphor for the Shia Imam Ali or it could be symbolizing Rostam, the legendary hero of Iranian mythology. The Sun has alternately been interpreted as symbol of motherland or Jamshid, the mythical Shah of Iran.|$|E

5|$|Traditionally, Pre-Columbian Aztec {{writing has}} not been {{considered}} a true writing system, since it did not represent the full vocabulary of a spoken language {{in the way that}} the writing systems of the Old World or the Maya Script did. Therefore, generally Aztec writing was not meant to be read, but to be told. The elaborate codices were essentially pictographic aids for memorizing texts, which include genealogies, astronomical information, and tribute lists. Three kinds of signs were used in the system: pictures used as mnemonics (which do not represent particular words), logograms which represent whole words (instead of phonemes or syllables), and logograms used only for their sound values (i.e. used according to the rebus principle). However, epigrapher Alfonso Lacadena has argued that by the eve of the Spanish invasion, one school of Nahua scribes, those of Tetzcoco, had developed a fully syllabic script which could represent spoken language phonetically in the same way that the Maya script did. Some other epigraphers have questioned the claim, arguing that although the syllabicity was clearly extant in some early colonial manuscripts (hardly any pre-Columbian manuscripts have survived), this <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>interpreted</b> as a local innovation inspired by Spanish literacy rather than a continuation of a pre-Columbian practice.|$|E
5|$|The Confession {{starts with}} the {{doctrine}} of revelation, or how people can know about God. The divines believed knowledge of God was available to people through nature {{as well as the}} Bible, but they also believed that the Bible, or Scripture, is the only way in which people attain saving knowledge of God. The doctrine of Scripture was also a particularly important area of debate at the time. Scholars had begun to argue that the Hebrew vowel points, marks added to the text to aid in pronunciation, of the Old Testament were probably not part of the original. This caused significant debate between Reformed polemicists and Roman Catholics. Catholics argued that such a discovery demonstrated the need for an authoritative magisterium to interpret the Bible as opposed to the Protestant doctrine of perspicuity, that the essential teachings of the Bible <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>interpreted</b> by anyone. English Reformed writers in particular took up the work of defending the Reformed doctrine. The divines had a strong view of the inspiration of the Bible, and believed that God revealed himself in the propositions found in Scripture. While the issue of biblical inerrancy, the belief that there are no errors in the Bible, did not arise until the eighteenth century, the divines clearly did not believe the Bible to contain any errors. Many of the divines held a rather mechanical view of biblical inspiration, believing that not only the words and ideas but also the letters and vowel points of the Hebrew text were inspired by God. On the other hand, they acknowledged that the text was written by humans in their own styles. They did not make any distinction between essential and incidental matters with respect to biblical inspiration.|$|E
