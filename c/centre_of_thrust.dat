The tail unit comprised a cantilever tailplane with a single fin and rudder. The prototype aircraft was powered by two 80hp Pobjoy R radial engines; the production aircraft however were fitted with the 90hp Pobjoy Niagara III radial engines.

Both the Scion and the Scion II were produced as either landplanes or floatplanes, the majority as landplanes (see the table below).

40|$|The effect <b>of</b> <b>thrust</b> on the {{flutter of}} a high-aspect-ratio wing is investigated. The wing is {{represented}} by a beam using a nonlinear mixed finite element method. Aerodynamic forces are calculated using a finite-state, two-dimensional unsteady aerodynamic model. The effect <b>of</b> <b>thrust</b> is modeled as a follower force of prescribed magnitude. Without the thrust force, the wing is shown to become unstable for freestream airspeeds greater than the flutter speed. On the other hand, {{in the absence of}} aerodynamic forces, the wing becomes unstable for values <b>of</b> the <b>thrust</b> in excess <b>of</b> a critical magnitude of the force. When both effects are present, the airspeed at which the instability occurs depends on the thrust magnitude. For validation, an analytical solution for the en vacuo case (accounting only for the effect <b>of</b> <b>thrust)</b> was developed and shown to closely match results from the numerical method. Parametric studies show that the predicted stability boundaries are very sensitive to the ratio of bending stiffness to torsional stiffness. Indeed, the effect <b>of</b> <b>thrust</b> can be either stabilizing or destabilizing, depending on the value of this parameter. An assessment whether or not the magnitude <b>of</b> <b>thrust</b> needed to influence the flutter speed is practical is made for one configuration...|$|R
