5|$|On {{the eve of}} September 5, 1972, tourism {{minister}} Manuel Elizalde called {{each member}} of Manila's foreign press corps to a party. Imelda arrived at the party, allegedly rambling about democracy and how only the Americans <b>could</b> <b>afford</b> <b>it.</b> On that same day, Martial Law was announced.|$|E
5|$|As in all {{occupied}} {{countries in}} Europe, food, fuel and clothing were strictly rationed by the German authorities. Even with the stringent rationing, {{the food and}} materials which civilians should officially have been entitled to were not always available. A significant black market also existed in the country, supplying food illegally at very high prices to those that <b>could</b> <b>afford</b> <b>it.</b> Information and the press were strictly controlled by the German government and news was greatly restricted. Nevertheless, the sales of collaborationist newspapers like Le Soir and the newspapers of pro-collaborationist political parties like Le Pays Réel remained high. A large number of underground newspapers were also published and distributed – the underground paper La Libre Belgique achieved a circulation of 30,000.|$|E
5|$|In modern times, {{water is}} seen as a common choice to drink with a meal. In the Middle Ages, however, {{concerns}} over purity, medical recommendations and its low prestige value made it less favored, and alcoholic beverages were always preferred. They were seen as more nutritious and beneficial to digestion than water, with the invaluable bonus of being less prone to putrefaction due to the alcohol content. Wine was consumed on a daily basis in most of France and all over the Western Mediterranean wherever grapes were cultivated. Further north it remained the preferred drink of the bourgeoisie and the nobility who <b>could</b> <b>afford</b> <b>it,</b> and far less common among peasants and workers. The drink of commoners in the northern parts of the continent was primarily beer or ale.|$|E

50|$|Government {{policies}} that encouraged home ownership {{even for those}} who <b>could</b> not <b>afford</b> <b>it,</b> contributing to lax lending standards, unsustainable housing price increases, and indebtedness.|$|R
5000|$|Gender {{inequality}} in education is common — male literacy and school enrolment exceeds female rates in all aspects. Out of the 2 million {{children who do}} not attend school in Guatemala, the majority are indigenous girls living in rural areas. Most families subscribe to patriarchal traditions that tie women to a domestic role and the majority would rather send a son than a daughter to school if they <b>could</b> <b>afford</b> <b>it.d</b> ...|$|R
5|$|Research into medieval foodways was, until around 1980, a much {{neglected}} {{field of}} study. Misconceptions and outright errors were common among historians, {{and are still}} present in {{as a part of}} the popular view of the Middle Ages as a backward, primitive and barbaric era. Medieval cookery was described as revolting due to the often unfamiliar combination of flavors, the perceived lack of vegetables and a liberal use of spices. The heavy use of spices has been popular as an argument to support the claim that spices were employed to disguise the flavor of spoiled meat, a conclusion without support in historical fact and contemporary sources. Fresh meat could be procured throughout the year by those who <b>could</b> <b>afford</b> <b>it.</b> The preservation techniques available at the time, although crude by today's standards, were perfectly adequate. The astronomical cost and high prestige of spices, and thereby the reputation of the host, would have been effectively undone if wasted on cheap and poorly handled foods.|$|E
5|$|The Basilica of Saint Mary was {{constructed}} between 1907 and 1915 on {{land that was}} formerly a farm, then a zoological garden. Archbishop John Ireland supervised the planning of the church, originally named the Pro-Cathedral of Minneapolis, along with the Cathedral of St. Paul in Saint Paul. He chose architect Emmanuel Masqueray, who was trained at the École des Beaux-Arts in Paris. The first Mass was held on May 31, 1914. Church leaders desired to build the finest altar in America, handcrafted of the finest marble they <b>could</b> <b>afford.</b> <b>It</b> was elevated {{to the rank of}} basilica and became the first basilica in the United States in 1926. The building is listed on the National Register of Historic Places as one of the area's finest examples of Beaux-Arts architecture.|$|E
5|$|From the 1840s onwards more mines {{provided}} crude shelters {{to protect}} surface {{workers from the}} worst of the weather, but at many others work at surface-level took place in the open air. Workers were generally expected to remain at their posts except in the most extreme weather conditions. Bal maidens wore gooks, a specialised bonnet which covered the shoulders and extended over the face to protect from rain, bright sunlight, flying debris and loud noise. In the winter the gook was made of felt, and in summer of cotton. Working in close proximity to heavy industrial machinery, they wore shorter dresses or skirts than the ankle-length clothing typical of the period, and their exposed lower legs were wrapped in protective coverings. Their arms were sometimes protected by hessian sleeves worn over their clothes. Some bal maidens working in cobbing and bucking wore rubber tubing on the fingers of one hand as protection from their hammer. While working bal maidens wore a waist-length hessian apron ('towser') over their clothes, and those who <b>could</b> <b>afford</b> <b>it</b> would have a white herden (flax and hemp) apron for wearing to and from work. These working clothes were accessorised with flowers, bows, ribbons, jewellery and other decoration. Until the end of the 19thcentury the working clothing of a bal maiden changed very little.|$|E
50|$|In {{the early}} days, the {{hospital}} offered medical service {{free of charge}} to those who <b>could</b> not <b>afford</b> <b>it,</b> with funding provided by local merchants. That tradition continues today.|$|R

5|$|Mail {{service was}} chaotic during the stampede. Apart {{from the number}} of prospectors, two major {{obstacles}} stood in its way. To begin with, any mail from America to Dawson City was sent to Juneau in South-east Alaska before being sent through Dawson and then down the Yukon to Circle City. From here it was then distributed by the US Post Office back up to Dawson. The huge distances involved resulted in delays of several months and frequently the loss of protective envelopes and their addresses. The second problem was in Dawson itself, which initially lacked a post office and therefore relied on two stores and a saloon to act as informal delivery points. The NWMP were tasked to run the mail system by October 1897, but they were ill-trained to do so. Up to 5,700 letters might arrive in a single shipment, all of which had to be collected in person from the post office. This resulted in huge queues, with claimants lining up outside the office for up to three days. Those who had no time and <b>could</b> <b>afford</b> <b>it</b> would pay others to stand in line for them, preferably a woman since they were allowed to get ahead in line out of politeness. Postage stamps, like paper in general, were scarce and rationed to two per customer. By 1899, trained postal staff took over mail delivery and relieved the NWMP of this task.|$|E
5|$|The {{effects of}} this {{migration}} have been observed {{in the ruins of}} burial sites left behind by the Iazyges, in that they lacked the standard items of gold being buried alongside a person, and even lacked the gear of a warrior. One explanation for this was that the Iazyges were no longer in contact with the Pontic Steppe, and thus cut off from all trade with them, which had previously been a vital part of their economy. Another problem the Iazyges had with their new location was that it lacked both precious minerals and metals, such as iron, that could be turned into weapons. The Iazyges found that it was much harder to raid the Romans, due to them having organized armies around the area, as opposed to the disorganization of the armies of their previous neighbors. Due to their trade with the Pontic Steppe being cut off, they could no longer trade for gold for burial sites, assuming any of them <b>could</b> <b>afford</b> <b>it.</b> The only such goods they could find were the pottery and metals of the Dacian and Celtic peoples near them. Iron weapons would have been exceedingly rare, if the Iazyges even had them, and would likely have been passed down from father to son, rather than buried, because it could not have been replaced.|$|E
25|$|The Byzantine empire {{also became}} quite {{famous for its}} desserts, which {{included}} biscuits, rice pudding, quince marmalade, rose sugar and many types of non-alcoholic beverages. The most common sweetener was honey, with sugar extracted from sugar cane being reserved for those who <b>could</b> <b>afford</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E
50|$|During the 1940s, a rectory {{and school}} {{building}} were added. The school closed in 1969 because the parish <b>could</b> not <b>afford</b> <b>it.</b> It became a convent for the Disciples of the Divine Master.|$|R
50|$|In September 1849, Chopin took an {{apartment}} at Place Vendôme 12. The second-floor, seven-room apartment had previously housed the Russian Embassy; Chopin <b>could</b> not <b>afford</b> <b>it,</b> but Jane Stirling rented it for him.|$|R
50|$|Another {{topic that}} Murphy {{addresses}} is the lure ice cream trucks have on children. Once {{the ice cream}} was bought, they would sing and dance mockingly in front of kids who <b>could</b> not <b>afford</b> <b>it.</b>|$|R
25|$|In 1860, Sadok Bey {{introduced}} conscription for {{the first}} time in Tunisiamilitary service was now obligatory for a period of eight years. Recruits were selected by lot, and those who <b>could</b> <b>afford</b> <b>it</b> could buy themselves out of the service. Thus it was only the poor who ended up serving.|$|E
25|$|Whilst many early virginals {{throughout}} Europe {{were left}} in plain wood, they were soon provided with rich decoration, which {{may have contributed to}} the survival of many such instruments. From mouldings on case edges, jackrails and namebattens to adornment with ivory, mother-of-pearl, marble, agate, tortoiseshell or semi-precious stones, not to mention intricate painting, no expense was spared by those who <b>could</b> <b>afford</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E
25|$|The items used in {{decoration}} {{may also}} have been darker and heavier than those used today, simply as a matter of practicality. London was noisy and its air was full of soot from countless coal fires. Hence those who <b>could</b> <b>afford</b> <b>it</b> draped their windows in heavy, sound-muffling curtains, and chose colours that didn't show soot quickly. When all washing was done by hand, curtains were not washed as frequently as they might be today.|$|E
60|$|Lantry professed {{himself to}} be quite willing to oblige an old {{customer}} to that extent. He <b>could</b> well <b>afford</b> <b>it,</b> he said; and it was unquestionable truth that he uttered, for his charges were exorbitant.|$|R
60|$|When I {{was with}} {{people who did not}} drink, I never thought of drinking. Louis did not drink. Neither he nor I <b>could</b> <b>afford</b> it; but, more {{significant}} than that, we had no desire to drink. We were healthy, normal, non-alcoholic. Had we been alcoholic, we would have drunk whether or not we <b>could</b> have <b>afforded</b> <b>it.</b>|$|R
50|$|Before 1650, fine {{furniture}} was {{a rarity in}} Western Europe and North America. Generally, people did not need it {{and for the most}} part <b>could</b> not <b>afford</b> <b>it.</b> They made do with simple but serviceable pieces.|$|R
25|$|The {{phenomenon}} of migration from Ireland is recorded since early Medieval times, {{but it is}} only possible to quantify it from around 1700: since then between 9 and 10 million people born in Ireland have emigrated. This is more than the population of Ireland at its historical peak in the 1840s of 8.5 million. The poorest of them went to Great Britain, especially Liverpool; those who <b>could</b> <b>afford</b> <b>it</b> went further, including almost 5 million to the United States.|$|E
25|$|In {{the autumn}} of 1786, the Swedish West India Company was {{established}} on the island. Gustav told investors that they could expect big profits in the future. Anyone who <b>could</b> <b>afford</b> <b>it</b> was allowed to buy shares, but Gustav kept 10 percent of the shares for himself, which made him the largest shareholder. The king received one quarter of all profits of the Company and the other shareholders three quarters, even though the king owned only 10 percent of the Company.|$|E
25|$|Another area {{of income}} {{important}} to African-born ex-slaves was {{their own work}} as slavers upon being granted their freedom. In fact, purchase of slaves was a standard practice for ex-slaves who <b>could</b> <b>afford</b> <b>it.</b> This is evidence {{of the lack of}} a common identity among those born in Africa and shipped to Brazil, for it was much more common for ex-slaves to engage in the slave trade themselves than to take up any cause related to abolition or resistance to slavery.|$|E
50|$|In the quoted {{portions}} of his letter, Kennedy, a steadfast proponent {{of health care}} reform, also posed {{the question of what}} would happen if one knew treatment existed for a condition but one <b>could</b> not <b>afford</b> <b>it.</b>|$|R

5000|$|Edward de Vere, Earl of Oxford in 1580 {{even though}} he also <b>could</b> ill <b>afford</b> <b>it.</b> The land was {{possibly}} held by his ancestors at some point. He sold it to William Cornwallis (c. 1545 - 1611) in 1588.|$|R
25|$|Wald's {{vision for}} Henry Street was one unlike any {{others at the}} time. Wald {{believed}} that every New York City resident was entitled to equal and fair health care regardless of their social status, socio-economic status, race, gender, or age. She argued that everyone {{should have access to}} at-home-care. A strong advocate for adequate bed-side manner, Wald believed that regardless of if a person could afford at-home-care, they deserved to be treated with the same level of respect that some who <b>could</b> <b>afford</b> <b>it</b> would be.|$|E
25|$|Sugar {{remained}} a luxury {{in much of}} the world until the 18th century. Only the wealthy <b>could</b> <b>afford</b> <b>it.</b> In the 18th century, the demand for table sugar boomed in Europe and by the 19th century it had become regarded as a human necessity. The use of sugar grew from use in tea, to cakes, confectionery and chocolates. Suppliers marketed sugar in novel forms, such as solid cones, which required consumers to use a sugar nip, a pliers-like tool, in order to break off pieces.|$|E
25|$|Visitors to {{the pier}} had to pay a toll, priced {{deliberately}} high at 6d (equivalent to £2.75 in 2016) to ensure only the most affluent <b>could</b> <b>afford</b> <b>it.</b> As the 1870s progressed, the numbers of working class visitors increased and tolls were reduced to 2d. Storm damage was an unfortunate frequent occurrence, with several storms damaging the pier's foundations and buildings throughout the late 1880s and early 1890s. A fire in September 1897 destroyed the original pavilion, with its replacement opening in January 1902 and considered grander with the inclusion of an auditorium.|$|E
50|$|They {{expressed}} their {{opinion that the}} time was not right for a house of assembly because the colony <b>could</b> not <b>afford</b> <b>it</b> and suggested that a larger council, composed of both new and old subjects, {{would be a better}} choice.|$|R
