40|$|Our {{findings}} indicate that the impedance cardiogram spectrum extends from DC to 50 Hz. Any amplifier with an upper band limit less than 50 Hz {{can be expected to}} produce attenuation and distortion of the impedance cardiogram. This signal attenuation may be systematically enhanced under conditions of high heart rate when a greater proportion of signal energy will be in the upper frequency range of the impedance cardiogram spectrum. Therefore, the present study was designed to assess the influence of amplifier bandwidth on dZ/dtmax, stroke volume, and systolic time intervals (LVET, PEP, QZ, QX). Simultaneously measured &# 916;Z and dZ/dt signals from two impedance <b>cardiographs,</b> with corner frequencies of 120 and 60 Hz for the &# 916;Z and 50 and 15 Hz for dZ/dt channels, were contrasted over a broad range of heart rate (70 – 150 bpm). In addition to the analog dZ/dt signals obtained from the instruments, the &# 916;Z signals were digitally converted to dZ/dt by off-line digital differentiation with a 50 Hz corner frequency. The results demonstrated that the measurements with the 15 Hz corner frequency, when compared with the 50 Hz corner frequency measurements, systematically attenuated the dZ/dtmax amplitude and stroke volume measurements as heart rate increased. The attenuation of dZ/dtmax and stroke volume ranged from about 13 % to 26 % as heart rate increased from 70 to 150 bpm. When the upper bandlimit was 50 Hz, the dZ/dt signal had greater resolution of waveform events and produced less prolonged systolic time intervals. The 15 Hz amplifier differentially influenced the B point, Z-peak and X minimum, having no apparent effect on the temporal location of the B point, but delaying the Z-peak about 21. 7 ms and the X minimum about 7. 4 ms.

The ability to monitor changes occurring in a subject during {{activities of daily living}} (ADL), could lead to the detection and treatment of many undiagnosed patients. Non-invasive monitoring of hemodynamic variables have gone through many changes since its inception in 1966, when Kubicek et al developed the first impedance <b>cardiograph</b> for NASA. Since then changes have been made to the formula which detects hemodynamic changes, however, the impedance <b>cardiograph</b> is still considered the gold standard for non-invasive monitoring. The current study assessed the accuracy of an ambulatory monitoring device, the Vivometric LifeShirt, compared to the current gold standard impedance <b>cardiograph</b> (Cardiodynamics, Bio-Z), during pre and post rest conditions. Methods:The volunteer subjects included 14 healthy males recruited from California State University, Northridge. The male participants were between the ages of 19 - 33 and all provided written informed consent. Pre and post test values were obtained while the Cardiodynamics Bio-Z and Vivometric LifeShirt simultaneously recorded hemodynamic values. Heart rate, stroke volume and cardiac output were then analyzed and recorded. Results:There was a very strong correlation to heart rate when comparing pre (Pearson correlation =. 988, Sig. 2 tailed =. 000) and post rest (Pearson correlation =. 990, Sig. 2 tailed =. 000) data between the LifeShirt and Bio-Z.

40|$|Abstract – Impedance cardiography is a {{non-invasive}} technique for measuring cardiac output and for diagnosing cardiac disorders. During systol, blood is {{pumped into the}} thoracic region which changes its basal impedance. High frequency (20 – 100 kHz) current (3 – 10 mA) is injected into the thoracic region through a pair of electrodes and the impedance change is sensed, by measuring the voltage across another pair of electrodes. The impedance variation thus measured is known as impedance cardiogram (ICG) {{and can be used}} for estimating stroke volume by using appropriate models of blood flow and can also be used for diagnostic information. As part of instrumentation development, a thoracic impedance simulator has been developed for comprehensive testing and calibration of the impedance <b>cardiograph</b> instrument to ensure proper signal pickup and detection of impedance variation. Features of this simulator include the variation of base impedance of the thorax by less than 1 percent as a square wave, electrode– tissue contact impedances for 4 – electrode configuration, 24 – 300 beats/min heart beat rate, 0 – 60 mV common mode ECG, 0 – 20 mV differential ECG, and option for feeding external pickup...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Power transistors, {{such as the}} vertical, double-diffused, metal-oxide {{semiconductor}} (VDMOS), are used extensively in the amplifier circuits of medical devices. The aim of thi s research was to construct a VDMOS power transistor with an optimized structure to enhance the operation of medical devices. First, boron was implanted in silicon by implanting unclamped inductive switching (UIS) and a Faraday shield. The Faraday shield w as implanted in order to replace the gate-field parasitic capacitor on the entry part of the device. Also, implanting the UIS was used in order to decrease the effect of parasitic bipolar junction transistor (BJT) of the VDMOS power transistor. The researc h tool {{used in this study}} was Silvaco software. By decreasing the transistor entry resistance in the optimized VDMOS structure, power losses and noise at the entry of the transistor were decreased, and, by increasing the breakdown voltage, the lifetime of the VDMOS transistor lifetime was increased, which resulted in increasing drain flow and decreasing Ron. This consequently resulted in enhancing the operation of high -frequency medical devices that use transistors, such as Radio Frequency (RF) and electro <b>cardiograph</b> machines...|$|E
40|$|Since the {{spectrum}} of the impedance cardiogram (ICG) extends from DC to 50 Hz, any amplifier with an upper band limit less than 50 Hz {{can be expected to}} produce attenuation and distortion of the ICG. This signal attenuation may be systematically enhanced under conditions of high heart rates (HR) when a greater proportion of signal energy will be in the upper frequency range of the ICG spectrum. Therefore, the present study was designed to assess the influence of amplifier bandwidth and signal fidelity on dZ/dtmax, stroke volume (SV), and systolic time intervals (LVET, PEP, OZ, HI). The performance of commonly available commercial systems was tested over a broad range of HRs. The results demonstrated that a digitally differentiated dZ/dt signal using a differentiator with a corner frequency of 50 Hz, when compared with the 15 Hz corner frequency used In the commercial impedance <b>cardiograph,</b> systematically enhanced the dZ/dtmax amplitude and SV measurements as HR increased. For SV the increase ranged from 17 to 30 % as HR increased from 70 to 150 bpm.

NPV was obtained from the DC and AC (pulsatile) components of the finger photo-plethysmograph signal. This measure has been proposed as a valid index of α-adrenergic sympathetic activity in the finger arteriolar vessels (Matsumura and Yamakoshi 2013; Lee et al. 2013; Sawada et al. 2001). A logarithmic transformation was applied to the NPV values (= ln NPV) to normalize the distribution.|$|E
40|$|Objective: In this {{retrospective}} study, we {{aimed to}} manifest some clinical, radiologic and demographical features of patients which were admitted to our emergency department and diagnosed with aortic dissection. Materials and Methods: Records of patients diagnosed with aortic dissection in our Emergency Department during March 2009 -March 2011 were scanned retrospectively. Patients’ gender, age, complaints (chest pain, backache, abdominal pain, syncope, dizziness and other), presence of mediastinal widening on tele <b>cardiograph</b> and presence of fleb on echocardiograph were recorded. Results: Total 12 patients (8 males, 4 females) were included into the study. Mean age was 63. 5 ± 19. 0 (minimum 28, maximum 85). Complaints were chest pain (50 %), backache (25 %), abdominal pain (25 %), syncope (25 %) and dizziness (16. 7 %), respectively. There was a pulse {{difference between the}} two arms in 25 % of patients. However, mediastinal widening was present in 50 % of patients. Eight patients (67 %) have a fleb on echocardiograph. Eight patients had Standford Type A and five of patients had De Bakey Type 1 aortic dissection. There were no statistical differences between dissection types and gender (p> 0. 5). Eleven patients were referred to another hospital, and one of patients died. Conclusion: We thought that in clinical doubt of aortic dissection which is diagnosed with difficulty, bedside echocardiographic evaluation will provide convenience for emergency physicians in emergency departments...|$|E
40|$|Only {{three cases}} of tetralogy of Fallot in cattle have been {{described}} (Hahn, 1908; Jasper, 1948; Cordy and Ribelin, 1950). None of these reports has included detailed descriptions of the clinlical and physiological disturbances associated with this anomaly. The following case is reported since {{for the first time}} in cattle it was possible, using specialized techniques, to establish the diagnosis in life with reasonable certainty. METHODS OF EXAMINATION In addition to clinical and pathological examinations the following examinations were carried out. Electrocardiograms. Electrocardiograms were taken using the standard limb leads of Einthoven and unipolar limb leads with the right arm electrode attached to the right foreleg, the left arm electrode to the left foreleg, the left leg electrode attached to the left hind leg, and the right leg electrode attached to the right hind leg. The <b>cardiograph</b> used was a Siemens Cardirex 6. * Heart Sound Recordings. Using the Cardirex 6, graphic records were taken of the heart sounds at five different frequency bands, together with a lead II electrocardiogram for timing. -Dye Dilution Curves. By means of a long polythene catheter inserted into the jugular vein it was possible to inject volumes of Evans Blue dye into the right atrium, right ventricle, and pulmonary artery. The appear-ance of the dye in the arterial circulation was followed by removing arterial samples at one second interval...|$|E
40|$|The {{movement}} of the anterior leaflet of the mitral valve has been recorded with an ultrasound echo technique. The intrinsic mobility of the valve cusps {{and the rate of}} ventricular filling are thought to influence the closure of the valve during diastole. Atrial contraction occurs at the end of ventri-cular diastole and reopens the valve before the mitral valve returns to the closed position before the onset of ventricular systole. The relation of the opening snap and third heart sound to the {{movement of}} the cusp is shown. In mitral stenosis ventricular systole occurs when the mitral valve is still far away from the closed position and the rapid {{movement of the}} cusp to the closed position may be the cause of the high intensity vibrations of the first heart sound. The EF slope (representing the rate of the closing movement of the cusp in end diastole) is decreased and a good correlation has been found with the degree of stenosis. After mitral valvotomy the EF slope increases significantly. The validity of these methods in assessing mitral incompetence or relative predominance of stenosis or incompetence in mixed mitral lesions is discussed. The ultrasound <b>cardiograph</b> is a fairly simple and completely atraumatic technique with proven diagnostic value in mitral valve disease. In addition, because of the new type of information that i...|$|E
