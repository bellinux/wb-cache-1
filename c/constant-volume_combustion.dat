The entropy minimum associated with Chapman–Jouguet (CJ) detonations [2] and its potential implications on the thermal efficiency of these systems [3] {{has been one of the}} main motivations for these efforts. The notion of applying thermodynamic cycles to detonation was considered first by Zel’dovich [4], who concluded that the efficiency of the detonation cycle is slightly larger than that of a cycle using <b>constant-volume</b> <b>combustion.</b> More recently, Heiser and Pratt [3] conducted a thermodynamic analysis of the detonation cycle for a perfect gas using a one-γ model of detonations. Other studies have used <b>constant-volume</b> <b>combustion</b> as a surrogate for the detonation process [5]. This work presents two main contributions. First, we present an alternative physical model for the detonation cycle handling propagating detonations in a purely thermodynamic fashion. The Fickett–Jacobs (FJ) cycle is a conceptual thermodynamic cycle that can be used to compute an upper bound to the amount of mechanical work that can be obtained from detonating a given mass of explosive.

40|$|Objectives: A reduced toluene {{reference}} fuel (TRF) mechanism of multi-component nature {{from the literature}} is utilized to simulate <b>constant-volume</b> spray <b>combustion</b> of n-heptane. The approach allows a preliminary assessment of fuel kinetic model and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) formulations in a simplified computational domain before integrating them in complex engine simulations. Methods: The operating conditions vary in ambient densities between 14. 8 kg/m 3 and 30 kg/m 3 with initial oxygen concentrations ranging from 10 % to 21 %. The CFD models are first calibrated to replicate spray penetration lengths of the non-reacting condition. The tuned numerical models are then applied to simulate the combustion and soot formation events of reacting sprays. The soot model employed is the multi-step Moss-Brookes model with updated oxidation models. Findings: The relative errors for ignition delay and lift-off length predictions are within 35 % and 22 % respectively. Furthermore, simulated soot volume fraction contours agree qualitatively with the experimental soot clouds. Computed peak soot locations, however, {{are found to be}} further downstream axially as compared to the experimental results across all test cases.

40|$|Fuel {{flexibility}} in gas turbines {{is of particular}} importance because of the main fuel source, natural gas. Blends of methane, ethane, and propane are big constituents in natural gas and consequently are of particular interest. With this level of importance comes the need for baseline data such as laminar flame speed of said fuels. While flame speeds at standard temperature and pressure have been extensively studied in the literature, experimental data at turbine-like conditions are still lacking currently. This thesis discusses the theory behind laminar flames; new data acquisition techniques; temperature and pressure capability improvements; measured flame speeds; and {{a discussion of the}} results including stability analysis. The measured flame speeds were those of methane, ethane, and propane fuel blends, as well as pure methane, at an elevated pressure of 5 atm and temperatures of 298 and 473 K, using a <b>constant-volume,</b> cylindrical <b>combustion</b> vessel. The current Aramco mechanism developed in conjunction with National University of Ireland Galway compared favorably with the data, while the literature data showed discrepancies at stoichiometric to rich conditions. An in-depth flame speed uncertainty analysis yielded a wide range of values from 0. 5 cm/s to 21. 5 cm/s. It is well known that high-pressure experiments develop flame instabilities when air is used as the oxidizer. In this study, the hydrodynamic instabilities were restrained by using a high diluent-to-oxygen ratio. The thermal-diffusive instabilities were inhibited by using helium as the diluent. To characterize this flame stability, the Markstein length and Lewis number were calculated for the presented conditions.

40|$|The {{application}} of detailed chemistry to the {{computational fluid dynamics}} simulation of combustion process in diesel engines has many potentials, including the possibility to predict auto-ignition, diffusion flame structure, stabilisation and soot formation {{in a wide range}} of operating conditions, also taking into account the effects of different fuel types. Among the approaches that were proposed over the years, the ones that are mostly used in practical calculations can be divided into two main categories: the first assumes each cell to be a well-stirred reactor, while the second employs the flamelet assumption to describe both auto-ignition and turbulent diffusion flame propagation. Despite the fact that both types of model have been widely validated over the years, a detailed comparison between them appears to be very useful in order to understand better the relevant parameters governing auto-ignition, flame stabilisation and the formation of pollutant emissions. This work is focused on a comparison of two different combustion models that were recently implemented by the authors in an open-source code. The first assumes each cell to be a homogeneous reactor and neglects interaction between turbulence and chemistry, while in the second, multiple laminar flamelets are used to represent the structure of a turbulent diffusion flame. Suitable techniques for online reaction rate tabulation and chemical mechanism reduction are also incorporated, to make the use of bigger mechanisms possible (up to 150 species). The two models are compared and validated by simulating <b>constant-volume</b> diesel <b>combustion</b> {{in a wide range of}} operating conditions, including variations of ambient temperature and oxygen concentration.

The modest pressure rise translates to a comparable increase in overall engine efficiency and, consequently, a comparable decrease in specific fuel consumption. The ejector-enhanced pulsejet combustor may also offer potential for reducing the emission of harmful exhaust compounds by making it practical to employ a low-loss rich-burn/quench/lean-burn sequence. Like all prior concepts for pressure-gain combustion, the present concept involves an approximation of <b>constant-volume</b> <b>combustion,</b> which is inherently unsteady (in this case, more specifically, cyclic). The consequent unsteadiness in combustor exit flow is generally regarded as detrimental to the performance of downstream turbomachinery. Among other adverse effects, this unsteadiness tends to detract from the thermodynamic benefits of pressure gain. Therefore, it is desirable in any intermittent combustion process to minimize unsteadiness in the exhaust path...|$|E
40|$|This report {{presents}} {{the latest in}} a number of versions of chemical equilibrium and applications programs developed at the NASA Lewis Research Center over more than 40 years. These programs have changed over the years to include additional features and improved calculation techniques and to take advantage of constantly improving computer capabilities. The minimization-of-free-energy approach to chemical equilibrium calculations has been used in all versions of the program since 1967. The two principal purposes of this report are presented in two parts. The first purpose, which is accomplished here in part 1, is to present in detail a number of topics of general interest in complex equilibrium calculations. These topics include mathematical analyses and techniques for obtaining chemical equilibrium; formulas for obtaining thermodynamic and transport mixture properties and thermodynamic derivatives; criteria for inclusion of condensed phases; calculations at a triple point; inclusion of ionized species; and various applications, such as constant-pressure or <b>constant-volume</b> <b>combustion,</b> rocket performance based on either a finite- or infinite-chamber-area model, shock wave calculations, and Chapman-Jouguet detonations. The second purpose of this report, to facilitate the use of the computer code, is accomplished in part 2, entitled 'Users Manual and Program Description'. Various aspects of the computer code are discussed, and a number of examples are given to illustrate its versatility...|$|E
40|$|Several {{investigations}} {{have reported that}} the lift-off length on diesel jets depends strongly on the ambient temperature. The spacing between adjacent jets is thereby expected to influence the lift-off length, as it affects the amount of hot, burned gases present between the jets. Measurements on an 8 -hole nozzle in an optical diesel engine showed that the lift-off length can be transient at all times between the start and end of injection. This is attributed to varying in-cylinder temperature and especially {{to the presence of}} hot combustion products in the gases entrained into the jets. The effect of inter-jet angle on lift-off length was investigated using symmetric and asymmetric nozzle cups. Decreasing the inter-jet angle produces shorter lift-off length. The lift-off length showed a weaker dependence on the ambient temperature in the engine than predicted by an empirical expression established in a <b>constant-volume</b> <b>combustion</b> vessel. These findings indicate that experiments in such vessels may not capture all features of the conditions in engines. The lift-off length tended to be 15 % shorter on the downswirl (leeward) side of the jet. A strong interaction between the effects of the inter-jet spacing and the inlet temperature on the lift-off length was found. All these effects are attributed to the presence of hot gases between the jets. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedIn {{support of the}} Navy’s Green Fleet Initiative, this thesis researched the ignition characteristics for diesel replacement fuels used with Navy-relevant fuel injectors. A <b>constant-volume</b> <b>combustion</b> chamber was used to simulate Top-Dead-Center conditions of a diesel engine using an ethylene-air preburn with appropriate make-up oxygen. The injection conditions ranged from temperatures of 1, 000 K to 1, 300 K and densities has high as 14. 8 kg/m 3. Hydrotreated renewable diesel (HRD) and direct sugar-to-hydrocarbon (DSH) fuels were injected into the combustion chamber using a Sturman research injector, a Yanmar injector, and an Electro Motive Diesel (EMD) injector. The primary means of data collection was optical emission imaging of laser induced fluorescence of the fuel and broadband emission of the combustion event. The ignition delay was determined using high speed imaging at 50 kHz to determine the time delay between start of injection and start of combustion. The {{results of the study}} show that the ignition delay characteristics for the F- 76 /HRD 50 / 50 blend are compatible with those of conventional F- 76 diesel fuel for both the Yanmar and EMD injectors at the conditions tested. The ignition delay characteristics of the F- 76 /DSH 50 / 50 blend fuel for the Yanmar injector were also compatible with those of F- 76. Ensign, United States Nav...|$|E
40|$|Changing the {{combustion}} process {{of a gas}} turbine from a constant-pressure to a pressure-increasing approximate <b>constant-volume</b> <b>combustion</b> (aCVC) {{is one of the}} most promising ways to increase the efficiency of turbines in the future. In this paper, a newly proposed method to achieve such an aCVC is considered. The so-called shockless explosion combustion (SEC) uses auto-ignition and a fuel stratification to achieve a spatially homogeneous ignition. The homogeneity of the ignition can be adjusted by the mixing of fuel and air. A proper filling profile, however, also depends on changing parameters, such as temperature, that cannot be measured in detail due to the harsh conditions inside {{the combustion}} tube. Therefore, a closed-loop control is required to obtain an adequate injection profile and to reject such unknown disturbances. For this, an optimization problem is set up and a novel formulation of a discrete extremum seeking controller is presented. By approximating the cost function with a parabola, the first derivative and a Hessian matrix are estimated, allowing the controller to use Newton steps to converge to the optimal control trajectory. The controller is applied to an atmospheric test rig, where the auto-ignition process can be investigated for single ignitions. In the set-up, dimethyl ether is injected into a preheated air stream using a controlled proportional valve. Optical measurements are used to evaluate the auto-ignition process and to show that using the extremum seeking control approach, the homogeneity of the ignition process can be increased significantly...|$|E
40|$|An {{improved}} phenomenological soot model {{coupled with}} a reduced n-heptane chemical mechanism was implemented into KIVA- 3 V code to describe soot formation and oxidation processes in diesel homogeneous charge compression ignition (HCCI) combustion. This model was first validated by the shock tube experiments with a rich n-heptane mixture over wide temperature and pressure ranges. The computational results demonstrate that the phenomenological soot model is capable of predicting the soot yield, particle diameter, and number density with satisfactory accuracy. Then the model was applied to investigate {{the influence of the}} orifice diameter and injection pressure on soot emissions in a <b>constant-volume</b> <b>combustion</b> vessel under typical diesel combustion conditions. The predictions showed qualitative agreement with the measurements on the soot volume fraction distribution. The results also indicate that the soot formation can almost be suppressed as the local equivalence ratio is kept lower than 2. 0. Finally, the model was used to explore the potentials of soot reduction with HCCI combustion for diesel engines. The overall trend of soot with the variations in the start of injection timing was well reproduced by the model. With the help of an equivalence ratiotemperature map, it was found that nitrogen oxide emissions could be markedly reduced by applying a high exhaust gas recirculation rate and relative low compression ratio for diesel HCCI engines. However, the mixture preparation by using a multi-hole injector with early injection strategy remains a limitation for further reduction in soot emission...|$|E
40|$|Diesel flame {{lift-off}} and stabilization in {{the presence}} of laser-ignition were numerically investigated with the method of Eulerian stochastic fields. The aim was to scrutinise the interaction between the lifted diesel flame and an ignition kernel upstream of the lifted flame. The numerical simulation was carried out in a <b>constant-volume</b> <b>combustion</b> vessel with n-heptane as fuel. The process was studied previously in an experiment employing Diesel # 2 as the fuel in the same combustion vessel. In the experiment a lifted flame was first established at a position downstream of the nozzle. An ignition kernel was then initiated using a high-energy pulse laser at a position upstream of the natural lift-off position of the diesel flame. The laser-ignition kernel was modelled using a high-temperature (∼ 2000 K) hot spot. In both experiment and simulations the upstream front of the ignition kernel was shown to remain around the initial laser ignition site for a substantially long period of time, while the downstream front of the ignition kernel propagates rapidly towards the natural lift-off position downstream of the laser ignition site. The lift-off position oscillated before the final stabilization at the natural lift-off position. The structures and the propagation speed of the reaction fronts in the laser-ignition kernel and the main flame were analysed. Two different stabilization mechanisms, the auto-ignition mechanism and the flame propagation mechanism, were identified for the naturally lifted flame and the laser-induced reaction front, respectively. A mechanism was proposed to explain the oscillation of the lift-off position...|$|E
