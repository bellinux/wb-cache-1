5|$|In 1973 the LPO was <b>caught</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> a {{recurring}} phenomenon of London orchestral life: the conviction in official circles that having four independent orchestras {{is too much}} for one city, and that two or more of the existing ensembles should merge.

The proposed merger would inevitably have led to redundancies, and the player-owners of both orchestras rejected the plan.|$|E
