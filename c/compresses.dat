It is a natural way for representing very highly <b>compressed</b> images, by describing larger parts in terms of smaller (earlier described) ones. For 1 -dimensional strings there exist polynomial-time deterministic algorithms for similar types of compression [2, 6, 8, 9].

5|$|Unless the {{pituitary}} {{damage is}} being {{caused by a}} tumor that overproduces a particular hormone, it {{is the lack of}} pituitary hormones that leads to the symptoms described above, and an excess of a particular hormone would indicate the presence of a tumor. The exception to this rule is prolactin: if a tumor <b>compresses</b> the pituitary stalk, a decreased blood supply means that the lactotrope cells, which produce prolactin, are not receiving dopamine and therefore produce excess prolactin. Hence, mild elevations in prolactin are attributed to stalk compression. Very high prolactin levels, though, point more strongly towards a prolactinoma (prolactin-secreting tumor).|$|E
5|$|Cores {{are often}} drilled {{in areas such}} as Antarctica and central Greenland where the {{temperature}} is almost never warm enough to cause melting, but the summer sun can still alter the snow. In polar areas, the sun is visible day and night during the local summer and invisible all winter. It can make some snow sublimate, leaving the top inch or so less dense. When the sun approaches its lowest point in the sky, the temperature drops and hoar frost forms on the top layer. Buried under the snow of following years, the coarse-grained hoar frost <b>compresses</b> into lighter layers than the winter snow. As a result, alternating bands of lighter and darker ice can be seen in an ice core.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new lossless binary image compression method.

In the quadtree <b>compressing</b> stage, a breadth first traversal (BFT) linear quadtree is used to <b>compress</b> the image. The run length <b>compressing</b> stage uses the run length method to encode the tree list and colour list of the BFT linear quadtree.

5|$|The {{encryption}} {{resembles the}} RSA algorithm. This algorithm encodes data in 3-byte blocks. First, the each byte is permuted through an 8-position permutation, then the bits are {{split into two}} 12-bit integers (by taking the low 4 bits of the second byte and the 8 bits of the first byte as the first 12-bit integer, and the 8 bits of the third byte and the 4 high bits of the second integer as the second 12-bit integer). Each is individually encrypted by taking them to the 3491st power, mod 4097; the bits are then reassembled into 3 bytes. The encrypted text is then stored in a string variable {{as part of the}} program. To shroud the would be visible and noticeable text it is compressed with the simple Lzw before final storage. As the Macintosh Common Lisp compiler <b>compresses</b> the main program code into the executable, this was not that necessary.|$|E
5|$|The {{extent of}} Earth's {{magnetic}} field in space defines the magnetosphere.

Because the velocity of the solar wind {{is greater than the}} speed at which waves propagate through the solar wind, a supersonic bowshock precedes the dayside magnetosphere within the solar wind. Charged particles are contained within the magnetosphere; the plasmasphere is defined by low-energy particles that essentially follow magnetic field lines as Earth rotates; the ring current is defined by medium-energy particles that drift relative to the geomagnetic field, but with paths that are still dominated by the magnetic field, and the Van Allen radiation belt are formed by high-energy particles whose motion is essentially random, but otherwise contained by the magnetosphere.|$|E

5|$|To {{reduce the}} storage {{footprint}} {{of the operating}} system, Windows 10 automatically <b>compresses</b> system files. The system can reduce the storage footprint of Windows by approximately 1.5GB for 32-bit systems and 2.6GB for 64-bit systems. The level of compression used is dependent on a performance assessment performed during installations or by OEMs, which tests how much compression can be used without harming operating system performance. Furthermore, the Refresh and Reset functions use runtime system files instead, making a separate recovery partition redundant, allowing patches and updates to remain installed following the operation, and further {{reducing the amount of}} space required for Windows 10 by up to 12GB. These functions replace the WIMBoot mode introduced on Windows 8.1 Update, which allowed OEMs to configure low-capacity devices with flash-based storage to use Windows system files out of the compressed WIM image typically used for installation and recovery. Windows 10 also includes a function in its Settings app that allows users to view a breakdown of how their device's storage capacity is being used by different types of files, and determine whether certain types of files are saved to internal storage or an SD card by default.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. What kind of {{operations}} can we perform effectively (without full unpacking) with <b>compressed</b> texts? In this paper we consider three fundamental problems: (1) check {{the equality of}} two <b>compressed</b> texts, (2) check whether one <b>compressed</b> text is a substring of another <b>compressed</b> text, and (3) compute the number of different symbols (Hamming distance) between two <b>compressed</b> texts of the same length. We present an algorithm that solves the first problem in O(n 3) time and the second problem in O(n 2 m) time. Here n {{is the size of}} <b>compressed</b> representation (we consider representations by straight-line programs) of the text and m is the size of <b>compressed</b> representation of the pattern. Next, we prove that the third problem is actually #P-complete. Thus, we indicate a pair of similar problems (equivalence checking, Hamming distance computation) that have radically different complexity on <b>compressed</b> texts. Our algorithmic technique used for problems (1) and (2) helps for computing minimal periods and covers of <b>compressed</b> texts. ...|$|R

40|$|Problem statement: One of {{the methods}} used for <b>compressing</b> images and {{especially}} natural images is by benefiting from fractal features of images. Natural images have properties like Self-Similarity {{that can be used in}} image <b>compressing.</b> The basic approach in <b>compressing</b> methods is based on the fractal features and searching the best replacement block for the original image. Approach: In this research with this attitude that the best blocks are the neighborhood blocks, we tried to find the best neighbor blocks; this search process was improved by using genetic algorithms and Schema theory. <b>Compressing</b> images can be considered from three approaches, first the speed of <b>compressing,</b> second: quality of image after Decompressing and the third: <b>Compressing</b> rate. In this research in addition to reducing time for <b>compressing,</b> the desired quality and rate of <b>compressing</b> were also obtained. Results: Totally genetic algorithm increase the speed of convergence for reaching the best block, but using this human knowledge that neighbor blocks always have the best chance to be replaced, were included in genetic algorithms first through neighborhood and then schema theory and this significantly decrease the time for producing a <b>compressed</b> images. Conclusion: Using this algorithms show the improvement in fractal <b>compressing</b> images comparing to other technique in <b>compress</b> ratio, time complexity and quality of final image parameters...|$|R
