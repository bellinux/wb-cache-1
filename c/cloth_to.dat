5|$|The {{scene where}} Sarah {{encounters}} the Fire Gang {{had to be}} altered in post-production {{as it had been}} filmed against black velvet <b>cloth,</b> <b>to</b> disguise the puppeteers, and a new forest background was added behind. Jim Henson was unhappy with the compositing of the finished scene, although he considered the puppetry featured in it worthy of inclusion.|$|E
5|$|For {{that entire}} day the Comanches plundered and burned buildings, draping {{themselves}} grandly in top hats and stolen linens. They tied feather beds {{and bolts of}} <b>cloth</b> <b>to</b> their horses, and dragged them. They herded large numbers of cattle into pens and slaughtered them. One outraged citizen, Judge John Hays, grabbed a gun and waded ashore through the shallow water, and roared at the bemused warriors, but the Indians chose to spare him, believing him mad. He later found that he had waded ashore to face nearly a thousand Indians with an unloaded pistol.|$|E

5|$|Until the mid-18th century, Crompton's textile sector {{had been}} closely linked {{with that of}} Rochdale and Saddleworth {{in the north and}} east; it was a woollen {{manufacturing}} district. However, as the demand for cotton goods increased, Crompton mirrored developments in Oldham and Manchester in the south and southwest, importing raw cotton and making cotton <b>cloth.</b> <b>To</b> ensure that the woollen trade was kept buoyant, a law existed from 1675 to 1814 to encourage Shaw and Crompton's wool production. It required that the deceased were to be buried in woollen garments.|$|E
5|$|Peel {{had gained}} a {{reputation}} for trying new methods within the industry, {{being one of the}} first textile manufacturers to use carding cylinders. He began experimenting at his home with different forms of printing until, according to family tradition, his young daughter Anne brought him a sprig of parsley and begged him {{to use it as a}} pattern. He etched this design onto a pewter plate to allow the printing, which was then finished with an iron by one of the women of the household. There are other versions of the tale, which dispute whether the experiments happened at the farm at Peel Fold or his house in Fish Lane and suggest a poor neighbour, Mrs. Milton, calendered the <b>cloth</b> <b>to</b> finish it.|$|E
5|$|Sponges {{have three}} asexual methods of reproduction: after fragmentation; by budding; and by {{producing}} gemmules. Fragments of sponges may be detached by currents or waves. They use {{the mobility of}} their pinacocytes and choanocytes and reshaping of the mesohyl to re-attach themselves to a suitable surface and then rebuild themselves as small but functional sponges {{over the course of}} several days. The same capabilities enable sponges that have been squeezed through a fine <b>cloth</b> <b>to</b> regenerate. A sponge fragment can only regenerate if it contains both collencytes to produce mesohyl and archeocytes to produce all the other cell types. A very few species reproduce by budding.|$|E

5|$|The coif was {{the main}} symbol of the Order of Serjeants-at-Law, and is where their most {{recognisable}} name (the Order of the Coif) comes from. The coif was white and made of either silk or lawn. A Serjeant was never obliged to take off or cover his coif, {{not even in the}} presence of the King, except as a judge when passing a death sentence. In that situation he would wear a black cap intended to cover the Coif, although it is often confused with the coif itself. When wigs were first introduced for barristers and judges it caused some difficulty for Serjeants, who were not allowed to cover the coif. Wigmakers got around this by adding a small white <b>cloth</b> <b>to</b> the top of the wig, representing the coif.|$|E
5|$|The rules {{regarding}} the correct methods {{to display the}} flag state that when two flags are fully spread out horizontally on a wall behind a podium, their hoists should be towards each other with the saffron stripes uppermost. If the flag is displayed on a short flagpole, this should be mounted {{at an angle to}} the wall with the flag draped tastefully from it. If two national flags are displayed on crossed staffs, the hoists must be towards each other and the flags must be fully spread out. The flag should never be used as a <b>cloth</b> <b>to</b> cover tables, lecterns, podiums or buildings, or be draped from railings.|$|E
5|$|Washington {{ordered that}} the excess baggage {{be taken to}} Burlington where it could be sent to Pennsylvania. The ground had frozen, making it {{possible}} to move the artillery without it sinking into the ground. By midnight, the plan was complete, with the baggage on its way to Burlington and the guns wrapped in heavy <b>cloth</b> <b>to</b> stifle noise and prevent the British from learning of the evacuation. Washington left 500 men behind with two cannon to patrol, keep the fires burning, and to work with picks and shovels to make the British think that they were digging in. Before dawn, these men were to join up with the main army.|$|E

5|$|The {{cities where}} {{emperors}} lived frequently in this period—Milan, Trier, Arles, Sirmium, Serdica, Thessaloniki, Nicomedia and Antioch—were treated as alternate imperial seats, {{to the exclusion}} of Rome and its senatorial elite. A new style of ceremony was developed, emphasizing the distinction of the emperor from all other persons. The quasi-republican ideals of Augustus' primus inter pares were abandoned for all but the tetrarchs themselves. Diocletian took to wearing a gold crown and jewels, and forbade the use of purple <b>cloth</b> <b>to</b> all but the emperors. His subjects were required to prostrate themselves in his presence (adoratio); the most fortunate were allowed the privilege of kissing the hem of his robe (proskynesis, προσκύνησις). Circuses and basilicas were designed to keep the face of the emperor perpetually in view, and always in a seat of authority. The emperor became a figure of transcendent authority, a man beyond the grip of the masses. His every appearance was stage-managed. This style of presentation was not new—many of its elements were first seen in the reigns of Aurelian and Severus—but it was only under the tetrarchs that it was refined into an explicit system.|$|E
5|$|The video {{opens with}} Spears {{and her friends}} in a hotel room, where a tabloid {{reporter}} on television criticizes her for the sexy, revealing outfits she's often seen wearing publicly. Spears and her friends express their disagreement with the report. Spears, determined to be self-sufficient and unaffected by media comments, then makes {{a phone call to}} her bodyguard, and using a <b>cloth</b> <b>to</b> disguise the sound of her voice, coaxes him to leave the area so that her group may sneak out of the hotel and enjoy the day. They run into an elevator and fool around briefly with the security cameras before going up to the main lobby. A strut down the lobby of the hotel and a short dance sequence follows. As they leave the hotel, they follow towards the dance club. However, before they arrive, they're caught in an alley by several paparazzi, and start to perform a dance routine {{in the middle of the}} rain. As they make their entrance, they're dripping wet, an image which makes for more sensationalist fodder for the tabloid reporter.|$|E
5|$|With {{help from}} a peasant named Ratpouch, Diermot manages {{to escape from the}} dungeon and visits Luthern, the blacksmith. Luthern reveals that a girl named Goewin who runs a herb shop has {{recently}} disappeared. Diermot discovers that she had been arrested by the Skorl. With help from Ratpouch, Diermot breaks into the house of Taidgh, the magician, where he creates a potion which disguises him as Selena. He enters the mansion where Goewin is being held and orders the Skorl to free her. Not long after, a man named Mallin gives Diermot a book wrapped in <b>cloth</b> <b>to</b> take to a man named Morkus. In the process of delivering the book, Diermot sees a notice stating that whoever returns the book to its rightful owner will be rewarded. Diermot delivers the book to a man named Toby, who rewards him with a statuette. Toby reveals that the dragon can help Diermot defeat Selena, but that he will need an infusion made of three herbs to wake the dragon up, which Goewin then makes for Diermot.|$|E
50|$|However, Gruffydd {{died while}} {{attempting}} {{to escape from the}} Tower in 1244. He is said to have used an improvised rope made from sheets and <b>cloths</b> <b>to</b> lower himself from his window, but as he was a heavy man, the rope broke and he fell to his death.|$|R
5000|$|Sometimes, {{clothes were}} also treated with sulfur. The cloth was then {{hung on a}} basket woven {{structure}} called a viminea cavea. This structure {{can be seen in}} the figure above. Fullones added sulfur <b>to</b> white <b>cloths</b> <b>to</b> maintain the color, knowing that sulfur was volatile enough to destroy colors.|$|R
50|$|The {{other story}} mode is called “Battle of Gold,” {{in which the}} 12 Gold Saints can be {{selected}} in their God <b>Cloths</b> <b>to</b> play a small, but different story with everyone.

25|$|The cotton mills of Fall River {{had built}} their {{business}} largely on one product: print cloth. About 1910, the city's largest employer, the American Printing Company (APC), employed 6,000 people {{and was the}} largest company printer of cloth in the world. Dozens of other city mills solely produced <b>cloth</b> <b>to</b> be printed at the APC. The city's industry had all its eggs in one, very large basket.|$|E
25|$|At {{the end of}} 1970 Christo and Jeanne-Claude {{began their}} {{preparations}} for the Valley Curtain project. A 400-meter-long cloth was to be stretched across Rifle Gap, a valley in the Rocky Mountains near Rifle, Colorado. The project required 14,000 m2 of <b>cloth</b> <b>to</b> be hung on four steel cables, fastened with iron bars fixed in concrete on each slope, and 200 tons of concrete.|$|E
