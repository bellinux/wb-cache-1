60|$|The {{climbing}} {{plants were}} still Panax or Aralia, Kadsura, Saurauja, Hydrangea, Vines, Smilax, Ampelopsis, Polygona, and, most beautiful of all, Stauntonia, with pendulous racemes of lilac blossoms. Epiphytes were rarer, still I found white and purple Caeloynes, and other Orchids, and a most noble white Rhododendron, whose truly enormous and delicious lemon-scented blossoms strewed the ground. The trees were one half oaks, one quarter Magnolias, and nearly another quarter laurels, amongst which grew Himalayan kinds of birch, alder, maple, holly, bird-cherry, <b>common</b> <b>cherry,</b> and apple. The absence of Leguminosae was most remarkable, {{and the most}} prominent botanical feature in the vegetation of this region: it is too high for the tropical tribes of the warmer elevations, too low for the Alpines, and probably too moist for those of temperate regions; cool, equable, humid climates being generally unfavourable to that order. Clematis was rare, and other Ranunculaceae still more so. Cruciferae were absent, and, what was still more remarkable, I found very few native species of grasses. Both Poa annua and white Dutch clover flourished where accidentally disseminated, but only in artificially cleared spots. Of ferns I collected about sixty species, chiefly of temperate genera. The supremacy of this temperate region consists in the infinite number of forest trees, in the absence (in the usual proportion, at any rate) of such common orders as Compositae, Leguminosae, Cruciferae, and Ranunculaceae, and of Grasses amongst Monocotyledons, and in the predominance of the rarer and more local families, as those of Rhododendron, Camellia, Magnolia, Ivy, Cornel, Honeysuckle, Hydrangea, Begonia, and Epiphytic orchids.|$|E

50|$|Traditionally made of wood, carved signs {{allow for}} the most {{creativity}} in terms of painting, shape, and sculpture. Western red cedar and redwood (Sequoia sempervirens) is most <b>common,</b> although <b>cherry</b> and oak are also used along {{with a range of}} darker tropical woods. Wood requires regular maintenance and repeated coats of varnish or paint. More recently developed synthetic materials, notably high-density urethane (HDU), have been extremely successful, allowing the same quality and craftsmanship coupled with a much greater weather resistance. Carved signs have been a traditional icon of the New England states in the USA, and are frequently also gilded with real gold. Traditional hand carving techniques are still used to create carved signs, although CNC routers are sometimes employed, and some sites exist which allow users to design their own sign prior to having it hand carved.|$|R

It grows to a height of 15 m with trunk diameter up to 35 cm. Leaves are 3-9 cm long, opposite, simple and slightly obovate, tapering at the leaf base. The leaves are dark glossy above, and paler below. White flowers are produced in clusters. The edible fruit is usually magenta, but can be white, pink or purple.|$|R
50|$|The {{native forest}} canopy is mainly oak, redbud, hickory, poplar, tuliptree, pine, and sweetgum, with {{chestnut}} having been common decades before {{in what is}} now considered oak-hickory forest. Traveling from the south, the metro area is generally the first area in which autumn leaf color can be seen, due to the different trees growing at the higher elevation and latitude. Underneath, the flowering dogwood is very <b>common,</b> the black <b>cherry</b> are quite prolific, with mulberry popping up sometimes as well. Sourwood is also in its native range, and is easily identified {{by the fact that it}} turns fiery red in early October, much brighter and weeks earlier than most other trees (which usually peak in early November).|$|R
40|$|Strawberries, plums, {{currants}} and gooseberries can {{be grown}} {{in all parts of}} the state. Red and black raspberries, though equally distributed regionally, are capricious in their reaction to soils, water supply and diseases. They may be a success on one piece of ground and a failure on the one adjoining. Grapes are well adapted to central and southern Iowa and they withstand considerable abuse and still yield some fruit nearly every year. Plums are the most widely adapted and apples the most popular fruits in the home orchard, but only hardy varieties resistant to disease should be planted. They must, along with the rest of the fruit garden, be protected from farm animals and cared for properly after planting, if they are to be successful. The <b>common</b> red <b>cherries</b> and two or three varieties of hardy pears should be included in home orchards in the south half of the state. Peach, nectarine, apricot and quince cannot be recommended as dependable for long life or production in any section, but many people will want to plant a few of them and be satisfied with an occasional crop...|$|R

40|$|The {{integrated}} {{sour cherry}} production in Croatia was monitored over a three year period. It {{was found that}} in the continental Croatia dominates Oblačinska cherry cultivar, followed by Csengőd and Gipsy cultivars, while in the Mediterranean Maraska cherry clones are present. Number of producers and production areas varied depending on purchase possibilities of cherries from the integrated production. The most <b>common</b> integrated sour <b>cherry</b> production in the continental Croatia is in Osijek – Baranja County, while in the Mediterranean area it is in Zadar County. Results {{have shown that the}} majority of cherry producers produce in accordance with prescribed Technical Guidelines for the integrated production. Within the integrated cherry pest management (IPM), control of aphids, was performed by pirimicarb and neonicotinoides. Rhagoletis cerasi was controlled by dimethoate. Diseases Stigmina carpophila and Blumeriella jaapii were commonly controlled by active substances: captan, copper hydroxide – Ca-chloride complex + zinc sulfide and dodine. Monilinia laxa was controlled mainly by the: boscalid, cyprodinil and carbendazim, while copper oxide was the most common substance in controlling Pseudomonas morsprunorum. Weed control included total herbicides application: glyphosate and glufosinate. The occurrence of mentioned harmful organisms was expected due to favorable climate conditions characterized by above – average temperatures and variations of extreme precipitation and droughts...|$|R
40|$|Sicily has {{extensive}} germplasm of diploid {{sweet cherry}} (Prunus avium L.) {{that has not}} been well studied. In this investigation, 39 cherry accessions, selected from collections and farms, were analysed using molecular markers and characterised for various morphological and other agronomic characters such as flesh colour, fruit size, quality and, in some cases, ripening periods. Thirteen Simple Sequence Repeat (SSR) primer pairs, as well as two primer pairs for the incompatibility (S) locus, which amplified across the first intron of the S-RNase gene and across the intron of the SFB gene, were used in three multiplexed reactions to analyse the accessions. The number of alleles per SSR locus ranged from four to 11 (mean 7. 2). Twelve S-alleles were found. Allele S- 4, which has been reported to be <b>common</b> in sweet <b>cherry,</b> was absent from the Sicilian germplasm and alleles S- 16 and S- 22 were frequent, although previously reported largely in wild populations. The accessions were assigned to their incompatibility groups. A UPGMA dendrogram was constructed and revealed possible synonyms. The set of SSR primers amplified unique fingerprints for 27 accessions, while twelve fell into six non-distinguishable groups. This approach could be used for comparing cultivars and wild accessions from other regions, and for establishing a database of this important species for breeding and conservation purposes. Several accessions useful for breeding are reported...|$|R
40|$|Surveys of {{the mold}} flora of frozen {{blueberry}} and cherry pastries were undertaken. Molds were enumerated by preparing pour plates of the blended product and incubating the plates at 0, 5, 10, and 20 C. In this manner, the total fungal {{content of the}} product could be ascertained from the 10 and 20 C plates, and the psychrophilic fungal population was represented by those fungi which grew at 0 and 5 C. The pastry portion, or crust, of the blueberry material was sampled separately from the filling portion. Certain differences in fungal flora were apparent. Aureobasidium pullulans was the dominant fungus in crust at all temperatures of isolation. However, Penicillium thomii {{proved to be the}} most common mesophilic fungus in the filling portion, and A. pullulans was the most common psychrophile in the filling. Aspergilli were quite common in the crust, but, in general, were absent from the fruit filling. Cherry pastries had a much smaller total fungal flora than did the blueberry product. However, A. pullulans again was the most prevalent fungus in cherry pastries at all temperatures of isolation. Certain differences in fungal flora were apparent in the two fruit products. Phoma spp. were almost completely absent in blueberries, but represented the second most <b>common</b> fungus in <b>cherry</b> pastries. Blueberry filling had 440 psychrophilic fungi per gram of sample (at 0 C), blueberry crust had 65 per gram, and cherry pastries had 77 per gram...|$|R
40|$|The cotton {{mealybug}} Phenacoccus solenopsis Tinsley (Hemiptera: Pseudococcidae) is {{native to}} the Neotropical zone, invasive in Pakistan has become the major pest since 2005 and spread very quickly on cotton and reduced the production. No any chemical control is effective to control mealybugs in the country {{as well as in}} the world due to protection of waxy cover on its body. Field and laboratory experiments on biological control of cotton mealybug were carried out at Sindh Agriculture University, Tandojam, Sindh, Pakistan and Benaki Phytopathological Institute, Kifissia-Greece from 2007 - 10. The preliminary field survey for prevalence of natural enemies and host plants of cotton mealybug resulted Brumus suturalis, Menochilus sexmaculatus Fabricius, Scymnus suturalis Thunberg, Scymnus coccivora Ayyar, Hyperaspis trifurcate Schaeffer, 7 -spotted beetle Coccinella septumpunctata, Adalia bipunctata L. (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae), Diadiplosis sp. (Diptera: Cecidomyiidae), big-eyed bug Geocoris punctipes Say. (Heteroptera: Geocoridae), greenlace wing Chrysoperla carnea Stephens (Neuroptera: Chrysopidae) and parasitoid Aenasius bambawalei Hayat (Hymenoptera: Encyrtidae) and also 37 host plants in 17 families were first time documented. Out of 37 host plants preferred host plants were studied for population fluctuation of mealybug and its natural enemies in field. Four host plants belonging to Malvaceae family (cotton Gossypium hirsutum L.,okra Abelmoschus esculentus L.,China rose Hibiscus rosasinensis L. and velvet-leaf Abutilon theophrasti Medik) and three to Solanaceae family (brinjal Solanum melongena L., <b>common</b> winter <b>cherry</b> Withania somnifera L. and thorn apple Dhatura stramonium L.). The mealybug P. solenopsis appeared on cotton after one month of crop sowing (1 st week of June to 2 nd week of November). The mealybug population was maximum on abutilon 5881, cotton 4829, okra 4429 and China rose 3970 followed by thorn apple 603, winter cherry 455 and brinjal 145, throughout the study period. In this study mealybug had positive correlation with temperature. In laboratory, biology of predator C. monrtouzieri pre-mating period for beetles 5. 60 ï¿½ 0. 08 days, preoviposition 9. 90 ï¿½ 0. 19 days and for incubation 5. 30 ï¿½ 0. 07 days were recorded. The oval cylindrical white pale yellowish eggs (capsule shaped) were laid by females singly or in groups in ovisacs of mealybug P. solenopsis. After hatching from eggs the grubs developed through four instars. Grubs hatched from egg as first instar with mean period of 5. 90 ï¿½ 0. 15 days, which were smooth, pale grey and increased gradually in size. Period for 2 nd, 3 rd and 4 th instars 5. 00 ï¿½ 0. 16, 700 ï¿½ 0. 18 and 8. 30 ï¿½ 0. 13, respectively with total 26. 20 ï¿½ 0. 61 days for grub development. The pre-pupal and pupal periods were recorded 2. 90 ï¿½ 0. 07 and 8. 50 ï¿½ 0. 20 days, respectively. Total development period from egg to adult 42. 90 ï¿½ 0. 95 days was observed. The adult longevity for male 80. 90 ï¿½ 0. 89 and female was 84. 40 ï¿½ 0. 90 days. The predator copulation period ranged between 5 - 48 minutes. The male mounted and dismounted over the female body and mated repeatedly throughout their life. The overall oviposition period was 76. 40 ï¿½ 1. 30 days. The fecundity was 486. 90 ï¿½ 1. 41 female- 1. C. montrouzieri was no acclimatized in cotton environment due to temperature and interaction of ants. Effect of heat treatments on C. montrouzieri survival in laboratory at Benaki Phytopathological Institute Kifissia, Greece was tested at five temperatures (35 ï¿½ 0. 5, 38 ï¿½ 0. 5, 40 ï¿½ 0. 5, 42 ï¿½ 0. 5 and 44 ï¿½ 0. 5 oC). C. montrouzieri was treated at 35 ï¿½ 0. 5 oC for 1, 2 and 3 hours survived for 23, 18 and 17 days, at 38 ï¿½ 0. 5 oC for 20 and 16 days, at 40 ï¿½ 0. 5 oC for 12, 7 and 5 days, at 42 ï¿½ 0. 5 oC for 9, 4 days and 44 ï¿½ 0. 5 oC for 4 days, respectively. However, mortality in beetles was observed in treated beetles at 42 ï¿½ 0. 5 oC for 3 hours and 44 ï¿½ 0. 5 oC for 2 hours. Studies on age specific life table of mealybug P. solenopsis indicated that lower mortality was in developing instars due to predation and high mortality in adult stage due to parasitism. Studies on biology of the parasitoid A. bambawalei showed that parasitoid female watched the mealybug adult females with the help of antennae and then inserted ovipositor through ventral side of body. Swelling and lazy movement of mealybugs was observed after 2 - 3 days by turning into light yellowish hard cuticle. These mummies were observed after the period of 5 - 7 days. Dark brown colour of mummy indicted the emergence of parasitoid between 11 - 15 days. Life span of adult parasitoid ranged between 10 - 37 days and fecundity of female 32 - 170. It was also observed that female of parasitoid preferred egg depositing in mature mealybugs. The study on parasitism of mealybug P. solenopsis through parasitoid A. bambawalei on cotton plants in the field indicated that majority of mealybug population aggregated on top portion (growing region) of the plant and minimum numbers scattered on the rest of plant parts. Results also revealed that ten pairs of parasitoid were effective against 1000 mealybugs on 5 plants m- 2. Parasitoid A. Bambalalei had better searching ability and parasitized the mealybug colonies {{as well as in the}} scattered form. It is concluded that cotton mealybug is a serious pest of cotton growing regions. Abutilon is preferred host of mealybug. Indigenous predators can play partial role to control mealybug. The exotic predator C. montrouzieri was not much effective due to their acclimatization in these harsh weather conditions and attack of ants. Mealybug population must be controlled on the host plants for further spread over cotton. The results showed that A bambawalei proved effective against mealybug P solenopsis and is suggested for field release...|$|R
