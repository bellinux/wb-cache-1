The case involved the testimony of Wang Kuang-yu, which marked the first time that any Investigation Bureau director testified in a <b>case</b> <b>under</b> <b>Investigation</b> Bureau jurisdiction. The three were cleared of charges, but Tseng appealed the verdict to the Taiwan High Court. The appeal was submitted in April 2002, and the High Court began its own investigation in November. In December 2003, the High Court reversed the Taipei District Court's decision. All three accusers were fined NT$81,000. Hsieh refused to pay, and was sentenced to three months imprisonment.|$|E

50|$|Yet {{one more}} <b>case</b> <b>under</b> <b>investigation</b> as of spring 2012 {{concerned}} {{the construction of}} a new terminal at Almaty Airport during Khrapunov’s time in office. In the course of 2003, the city of Almaty issued a series of 15 promissory notes with a par value of a million US dollar each. Their collateral consisted of stock in a skeleton enterprise, apparently without any benchmark share price but at the same time the nominal holder of the construction contract for the new terminal of the Almaty international airport. The enterprise’s name was Delamore Trade and Investment, a subsidiary of Delamore Group, which in turn controlled Imstalkom - the main contractor for the terminal. After the terminal was opened by the end of 2004 after two years of delay, its construction bill turned out to amount of the equivalent of 52 million US dollar rather than the $21 million in the budget. Imstalcom was nominally owned by n enterprise called Kazan To, in turn under control of another company called Phoenix, owned by the Khrapunov family, which later changed its name into Swiss Phoenix Holding SA.|$|E

The <b>case</b> <b>under</b> <b>investigation</b> deals with the introduction of private broadcasting in the Netherlands. Several predictions of the advertising expenditures in various media are given which depend on a number of scenarios. These scenarios are used to reduce the discrepancies between behavioural intentions and actual behaviour. The predictions of the most realistic scenario are compared with their realizations, and the differences are analyzed. To this end the prediction error is decomposed into an intention error and a sampling error. This decomposition offers good opportunities to analyze discrepancies between intentions and actual behaviour...|$|E

30|$|The above {{model is}} used to derive upper bounds for a fixed DC bias by {{employing}} pre-equalization and post-equalization schemes. For each <b>case</b> <b>under</b> <b>investigation,</b> CSI {{is assumed to be}} available at the transmitter or at the receiver as per post- or pre-equalization requirements, respectively. Then these fixed biases, denoted by Bpost and Bpre, are employed in finding the optimal criteria for subcarrier selection in both cases. The following two subsections show the analytical models for both cases along with the derivation of conservative bounds for fixed DC biases. In both cases, subcarrier selection is based on maximizing the argument of the Q function in the BER expression, where the Q function is the complementary cumulative distribution function of zero-mean unit-variance Gaussian random variable.|$|E

My study has several advantages over previous investigations on religious mobility. First, the data I analyzed comes from the 1999 – 2009 Taiwan Social Change Surveys (TSCS), which provides both more and recent cases to compare religious mobility over three periods. Second, I explored the pattern of religious retention of adult children (age[*]>[*] 18) rather than teenagers, to which most research on religious transmission pay little attention. Third, I compared fathers’ with mothers’ influence on religious retention of children and presented a gender pattern of continuity of religious affiliation. Fourth, the retentive capacity of each main religious community has been depicted according to data on switching on the collective level. The author read and approved the final manuscript.|$|E
