5|$|After {{crossing}} Highway401, {{at which}} there is an interchange, the route encounters Cornwall Centre Road, onto which it turns east. After following it for a brief distance, the highway turns north onto St. Andrews Road; the <b>Connecting</b> <b>Link</b> agreement ends at this junction.|$|E

40|$|The {{invention}} {{in one embodiment}} is {{a communication}} network including plural non-blocking crossbar nodes, first apparatus for connecting the nodes in a first layer of <b>connecting</b> <b>links,</b> and second apparatus for <b>connecting</b> <b>links</b> independent of the first layer, whereby each layer {{is connected to the}} other layer at each point of the nodes. Preferably, each one of the layers of <b>connecting</b> <b>links</b> corresponds to one recirculating network topology that closes in on itself...|$|R
50|$|Although not {{necessarily}} sharing any general suspension characteristics, these designs all share a certain structural benefit. Because the <b>connecting</b> <b>links</b> are so short, the floating link {{comes in the}} form of a rigid rear triangle big enough to encompass the rear wheel. This allows the rear triangle on both sides of the wheel to be rigidly connected together as one piece, before attaching to the <b>connecting</b> <b>links</b> of the four-bar. This significantly increases lateral and torsional stiffness of the rear, often a weakness of four-bar designs, and reduces the load on the pivots, <b>connecting</b> <b>links</b> and joint between rear axle and frame.|$|R

5|$|The route {{begins at}} 9th Street West, which was Highway2 {{until the late}} 90s, and {{proceeds}} north along {{the western side of}} Cornwall; this section is maintained under a <b>Connecting</b> <b>Link</b> agreement and is locally known as Brookdale Avenue.|$|E
5|$|The highway {{remained}} unchanged {{for over three}} decades, {{with the exception of}} a <b>Connecting</b> <b>Link</b> agreement established between the MTO and the City of Barrie. However, during the late 1990s, the MTO transferred many highways to lower levels of government as a cost-cutting measure. Highway90 was transferred to Simcoe County on January1, 1998.|$|E
5|$|The western {{segment of}} Highway3 {{begins at the}} Ambassador Bridge, which connects Canada with the U.S. state of Michigan over the Detroit River. The five lane highway travels {{southeast}} through Windsor along Huron Church Road, surrounded by residential subdivisions, then curves east to meet {{the western end of}} Highway401. The section through Windsor to Cabana Road is maintained under a <b>Connecting</b> <b>Link</b> agreement.|$|E

50|$|In {{return for}} that {{particular}} road being downloaded, the town or county receives money and assistance in maintaining it, {{and is able to}} still sign and list it as a provincial highway, though not all <b>connecting</b> <b>links</b> are signed as provincial highways. Some <b>connecting</b> <b>links,</b> however, were never provincial highways at all, but rather county or regional roads, or even local streets that the town or city has assistance in maintaining. Conversely, not all roads formerly signed as highways are <b>connecting</b> <b>links.</b> In cases where the former highway terminates in a city and doesn't revert into a provincially maintained route, such as the section of Highway 11 (Yonge Street) through Toronto, highway designations were originally applied for continuity, and subsequently removed.|$|R

There are weekly express trains connecting Coimbatore, Varanasi and Bhubaneswar. Passenger trains ply from Rameswaram to Madurai and Trichy daily, making railways {{as the major}} mode of transportation. The Ramanathapuram – Rameswaram National Highway is the main <b>connecting</b> <b>link</b> from Rameswaram to the mainland. Prior to the 1914 train service linking the mainland with Rameswaram, boats were the only mode of transport to Rameswaram island.|$|E
5|$|Within {{the urban}} portion of Elliot Lake, the highway is locally {{maintained}} under a <b>Connecting</b> <b>Link</b> agreement. It passes the Nuclear Mining Museum and the Mount Dufour ski resort {{before leaving the}} community and crossing {{the eastern end of}} the geographic Elliot Lake. From this point to the northern terminus of the highway, the route provides access to several mines that dot the surrounding areas. Immediately south of Quirke Mine Road, Highway108 becomes Secondary Highway639; the centre lane ends and the pavement quality is visibly reduced.|$|E
5|$|At , Highway420 is the {{shortest}} 400-series highway, travelling through Niagara Falls from Montrose Road to Stanley Avenue, {{on the outskirts of}} the city's tourist district. East of StanleyAvenue (Regional Road102) the highway becomes Niagara Regional Road420 and is known as Falls Avenue and Newman Hill on approach to the Rainbow Bridge. This portion was designated a part of Highway420 until 2000, when it was transferred to the City of Niagara Falls and the Regional Municipality of Niagara, although the Ministry of Transportation of Ontario (MTO) still assists with the maintenance of it under a <b>Connecting</b> <b>Link</b> agreement.|$|E

The <b>connecting</b> <b>link</b> between Central Secretariat and Qutub Minar opened on 3 September 2010.|$|E
5|$|The {{history of}} Highway58 is tumultuous due to various {{relocation}} projects {{resulting from the}} construction of the fourth Welland Canal and Highway406. Prior to 1997, Highway58 was continuous and travelled through the west side of Welland, maintained under a <b>Connecting</b> <b>Link</b> agreement. The route was first established in 1935, though it remained unnumbered on the 1935 and 1936 official road maps. By 1937 it extended from Port Colborne to St. Catharines, though the route it travelled between those places shifted several times over the following 30 years. In the late 1990s, the Ministry of Transportation of Ontario (MTO) transferred several highways or portions of highways throughout the province to lower levels of government. Highway58 was decommissioned through Welland on April1, 1997.|$|E

25|$|The {{single track}} {{extension}} of the Wealden Line from Uckfield to Groombridge was opened on 3 August 1868 and six trains began to run each day between Tunbridge Wells and Brighton. These, plus the four to and from Three Bridges, led to the Groombridge - Tunbridge Wells section being extensively used, and eventually double-tracked by January 1872. On 24 January 1876 a short <b>connecting</b> <b>link</b> between Tunbridge Wells Central and the Hastings Line was opened, allowing through running to that line via Tonbridge. Four trains provided by the South Eastern Railway began to run daily.|$|E

40|$|High {{impedance}} <b>connecting</b> <b>links</b> and cables are modeled at {{low frequency}} {{in terms of}} their impedance to ground and to neigbouring <b>connecting</b> <b>links.</b> The impedance is usually considered to be the parallel combination of a resistance and a capacitance. While this model is adequate at moderate and low frequency, it proved to be not satisfactory at very low frequency, in the fractions of Hz range. Deep characterization was carried out on some samples down to 10 uHz, showing that an additional contribution to capacitance can emerge. A model was developed to explain and account for this additional contribution...|$|R
25|$|Remarking {{on it as}} a {{geological}} {{and physical}} phenomenon, Carruthers continues:he Dzungarian Gate is as unusual {{as that of the}} Jordan depression. They are both examples of a rift-valley caused by the movement of the earth's crust, not by the action of water. This valley once formed the <b>connecting</b> <b>link</b> between the drainage of Dzungaria and that of Southern Siberia. The chain of lakes {{at either end of the}} valley (Balkash, Ala Kul, Ebi Nor, etc.), are the remains of the great Asiatic Mediterranean Sea; if their waters were to rise a few hundred feet they would break through the Gate, flooding the plains to the north and south.|$|E
25|$|The Stratford-upon-Avon Canal was {{conceived}} {{as part of}} a network of canals which would allow coal from the Dudley Canal and the Stourbridge Canal to reach Oxford and London, without having to use the Birmingham canals, the management of which was seen as high-handed. An Act was passed on 28 March 1793 {{for the construction of a}} canal from a junction with the Worcester and Birmingham Canal in Kings Norton to Stratford-upon-Avon. The Canal Company was empowered to raise £120,000 by issuing shares and an additional £60,000 if required. The route would take it close to Warwick and Birmingham Canal at Lapworth, but the act did not include any provision for a direct connection with it, or with the River Avon at Stratford. Negotiations started with the Warwick and Birmingham, and to second act was obtained on 19 May 1795, to allow a <b>connecting</b> <b>link</b> to be built, despite rather unfavourable terms imposed on through traffic by the other company.|$|E
25|$|Neither of {{the river}} navigations to which the canal {{connected}} were satisfactory. In the west, the situation was remedied in 1820, {{with the construction of}} the Gloucester and Sharpness Canal seven years later. On the Thames, there had been a proposal for a canal from Lechlade to Abingdon in 1784, and for a cut from Inglesham to Buscot in 1788, but neither had been built. Some improvements were made to the river after 1786, but the Canal company encouraged the building of bypasses. The Wilts and Berks Canal was one, providing a link to the river at Abingdon, but although it was proposed in 1793, it was not opened until 1810, and the North Wilts Canal, which provided a <b>connecting</b> <b>link</b> from Latton to Swindon was not completed until 1819. Ultimately, most of the Bristol to London trade used the Kennet and Avon Canal after it opened in 1810, as it provided a much shorter route than the Thames and Severn Canal.|$|E
