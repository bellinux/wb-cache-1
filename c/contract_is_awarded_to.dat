5000|$|A {{supplier}} may bid in a {{very competitive}} environment with a customer to build a widget. However, to make the widget, the supplier {{will be required to}} build specialized machinery which cannot be easily redeployed to make other products. Once the <b>contract</b> <b>is</b> <b>awarded</b> <b>to</b> the supplier, the relationship between customer and supplier changes from a competitive environment to a monopoly/monopsony relationship, known as a bilateral monopoly. This means that the customer has greater leverage over the supplier such as when price cuts occur. To avoid these potential costs, [...] "hostages" [...] may be swapped to avoid this event. These hostages could include partial ownership in the widget factory; revenue sharing might be another way.|$|E

We examine and compare two extrema, namely, the case when all players are rational and the case when all players make random selections. Qi Zeng, Bruce R. Davis and Derek Abbot...|$|E

40|$|The {{procurement}} {{of supplies}} is often conducted through the buyer analogue of an auction. Sealed bids are submitted and the <b>contract</b> <b>is</b> <b>awarded</b> <b>to</b> the lowest bidder. Although this method may be an optimal way of selling an object, an additional complication arises {{in the case of}} purchasing a good. When sellers are privately informed {{about the quality of the}} good to be sold, these mechanisms typically result in the provision of the lowest quality object. This paper characterizes optimal mechanisms in environments where sellers are privately informed about quality. It shows that the commonly used auction mechanism is privately or socially optimal in only a small class of environments. In another plausible set of environments the optimal mechanism is simply to order potential supplies and to tender take-it-or-leave-it offers to each sequentially. We use the duality theorem of linear programming to provide a methodology by which necessary and sufficient conditions can be derived to determine when any incentive compatible trading environment maximizes social or private surplus. ...|$|E

40|$|In {{the global}} {{construction}} context, {{the best value}} or most economically advantageous tender is becoming a widespread approach for contractor selection, {{as an alternative to}} other traditional awarding criteria such as the lowest price. In these multi-attribute tenders, the owner or auctioneer solicits proposals containing both a price bid and additional technical features. Once the proposals are received, each bidder’s price bid is given an economic score according to a scoring rule, generally called an economic scoring formula (ESF) and a technical score according to pre-specified criteria. Eventually, the <b>contract</b> <b>is</b> <b>awarded</b> <b>to</b> the bidder with the highest weighted overall score (economic + technical). However, economic scoring formula selection by auctioneers is invariably and paradoxically a highly intuitive process in practice, involving few theoretical or empirical considerations, despite having been considered traditionally and mistakenly as objective, due to its mathematical nature. This paper provides a taxonomic classification {{of a wide variety of}} ESFs and abnormally low bids criteria (ALBC) gathered in several countries with different tendering approaches. Practical implications concern the optimal design of price scoring rules in construction contract tenders, as well as future analyses of the effects of the ESF and ALBC on competitive bidding behaviour...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Federation of Contractor Associations of Nepal (FCAN) {{has asked}} the {{government}} to amend the law so that bidders quoting the average price would be awarded the contract. The competitive bidding process for awarding construction contracts in Nepal {{is based on the}} low bid method. According to this method, the construction firm submitting the lowest bid receives the right to the construction contract. Promoting competition amongst contractors and maintaining transparency are the clear benefits but delays in meeting the contract duration, increment of the final project cost, tendency to compromise quality, and adversarial relationship among contracting parties are the major drawbacks. As alternative of low bid method, some countries are using Average bid method. In this method, <b>contract</b> <b>is</b> <b>awarded</b> <b>to</b> the contractor whose price is closest to the average of all bids submitted. It is assumed that with a fair price they would conform to quality requirements of the project, would complete on time, and would not have adversarial relationships with the consultant of the employer. Awarding tenders to the lowest bidders is the major reason behind lingering construction projects and failure in meeting its standards in Nepal. To avoid such problems, Average bid Award system may be practiced by public agencies for procurement of works in Nepal...|$|E
