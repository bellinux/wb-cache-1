Under this rule, consumers are presumptively made better off by a regime that gives them greater freedom. Telemarketing firms facing higher costs of communication are likely to better screen potential contacts. Consumers having the option of choosing an intermediate price will receive fewer calls, which will be better tailored to their interests, and will be compensated for those calls they do receive. Giving consumers the right to be compensated may also benefit some telemarketers. Once consumers are voluntarily opting to receive telemarketing calls (in return for tailored compensation), it becomes possible to deregulate the telemarketers—lifting current restrictions on the time (no night time calls) and manner (no recorded calls). And faced with increasing caller resistance, we imagine that survey groups, such as the Gallop Poll, might welcome the opportunity to compensate survey respondents so that {{they might be able to}} produce more representative samples...|$|R

40|$|This paper shows why the Federal Reserve Board’s {{proposed}} {{alternatives for}} regulating interchange fees are not “reasonable” and therefore in direct {{violation of the}} statutory mandate that these rules be “reasonable” and “proportional” to the costs incurred by debit card issuers. The Board’s December 16, 2010 proposal is not “reasonable” because {{it would lead to}} a series of “unreasonable” outcomes, which, in significant part, flow from the predictable responses issuers of debit cards would take in response to the proposal. Policy makers cannot reasonably assume that banks in competitive markets will sit idly by while being forced to reduce their <b>current</b> market-determined <b>debit</b> card interchange fees, which comprise much of their debit-card revenues and a material portion of bank profits, by anywhere from 73 to 84 percent. To the contrary, banks will attempt to make up as much of the lost revenue as they can by some combination of higher fees on checking accounts, fees or reductions of benefits for debit card use, or more refusals by issuers to permit consumers to conduct higher-cost types of transactions that impose greater fraud risk. We argue that the Board should find that, in the absence of empirical evidence evaluated using the analytical framework governing two-sided markets proving otherwise, market-set interchange fees are reasonable and proportional to cost. Any other decision would lead to the unreasonable outcomes. ...|$|R
40|$|NEWLY DEVELOPED {{estimates}} {{have been}} introduced in the U. S. international transactions accounts (ITAs) of fines and penalties paid by foreign corporations to the U. S. government and U. S. private purchasers, and of fines and penalties paid by U. S. corporations to foreign governments. The new estimates are a component of unilateral current transfers. Fines and penalties imposed by the U. S. government on foreign corporations are recorded as inward current transfers (credits), reflecting receipts of funds by the U. S. Department of the Treasury {{as a result of}} judgments rendered by the U. S. Department of Justice and other agencies of the U. S. government (ITA table 1, line 37). Receipts from U. S. private class action settlements against foreign corporations are recorded as inward current transfers (credits) in ITA table 1, line 38. Fines and penalties imposed by foreign governments, including the European Commission, are recorded as outward <b>current</b> transfers (<b>debits),</b> reflecting the payment of funds by U. S. corporations to foreign governments (ITA table 1, line 38). A large share of these outward and inward transfers result from the prosecution of international cartels, which are voluntary associations of two or more legal entities—usually large multinational corporations—that conspire to restrict international or domestic trade, fix prices, or allocate market shares with the aim of increasing the profits of their members. International cartels are those with members located in two or more countries. “International cartels tend to be larger, better publicized, more injurious to markets, and geographically more widespread than the many more numerous local cartels. Many international cartels are virtually global in their operations. ”...|$|R
40|$|The {{letter of}} credit {{contract}} and the collection contract The diploma thesis deals with {{the topic of the}} Direct Debit Contract and the Letter of Credit. A Letter of Credit is a special payment instrument issued as a rule by a bank that the principal has undertaken to pay to the person in whose interest the Letter of Credit is open and designated as the authorized amount up to the amount agreed. The Direct Debit is the commitment of the collector of receivables to obtain from the third party a receipt of a sum of money or other Direct <b>Debit.</b> <b>Current</b> legislation, contained in the Civil Code, took over the legal regulation of the Letter of Credit and the Direct Debit from the Commercial Code without any major changes. Both institutes show a number of identical and different elements. From a practical point of view, {{it is not possible to}} look for serious application problems in the Letter of Credit or Direct Debit.

40|$|In modern {{societies}} like Ireland, {{every citizen}} {{needs to have}} appropriate access to a <b>current</b> account, a <b>debit</b> card or credit in order to lead a normal life. However, Ireland has {{the lowest level of}} access to a current account in Western Europe, some of its population relies on moneylenders to access credit, and an increasing number of borrowers are facing overindebtedness. Therefore, financial inclusion is a key social policy issue for a cohesive Ireland. However, it is an extremely complex one as it requires reconciling the interests of low and moderate income people and banks. This paper, Understanding and Combating Financial Exclusion and Overindebtedness in Ireland: a European Perspective, looks at how Ireland could promote financial inclusion. It does this by developing an in-depth analysis of the responses implemented in the United Kingdom, France and Belgium. The paper examines their successes and failures in relation to financial exclusion and assesses what policies would be appropriate in an Irish context. The paper sets out guidelines for an appropriate framework to deal with financial exclusion in Ireland by building on its current strengths while also learning from experiences in other European countries. The guidelines address access to basic banking services and affordable credit as well as appropriate responses to overindebtedness...|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} debit {{and credit}} card networks. Our contribution is to introduce the role of consumer credit into these payment networks, and to assess the way this affects competition and equilibrium fees. We analyze {{a situation in which}} overdrafts are associated with <b>current</b> accounts and <b>debit</b> cards, and larger credit lines with ‘grace’ periods are associated with credit cards. If we just introduce credit cards, we find their merchant fees depend not only on the networks’ cost of funds and the probability of default, but also on the interest rates of overdrafts. Whilst debit card merchant fees do not depend on funding costs or default risk in a debit-card only world, this changes when they start to compete with credit cards. First, debit merchant acceptance increases with the default probability, even though merchant fees increase. Second, an increase in funding costs causes a surprising increase in debit merchant fees. Effectively, the bank offering the debit card benefits from consumers maintaining a positive current account balance, when they use their credit instead of their debit card. As a result, this complementarity may lead to relatively high debit card merchant fees as the bank discourages debit card acceptance at the margin.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} a new electronic payment framework {{that is based}} on the direct debit payment model currently used both of-line and via the Internet. The strength of the direct debit model is its fexibility in allowing customers to defer payments for goods and services until a later date. This fexibility also extends to merchants who can process consumer payments without any customer intervention thus making payment collections a faster and more effient business function. The <b>current</b> direct <b>debit</b> solutions used online are neither secure nor fexible and demand a "leap of faith" from customers who must trust merchants to behave honestly. Unlike its off-line counterparts that always use signed direct debit request (DDR) forms as legally binding contracts, online direct debit systems rarely require signatures (for example when using credit cards). As such, in most cases it is possible for merchants to change the terms of original debit agreements post-fact allowing them to arbitrarily charge customer accounts. Unsigned DDR agreements give merchants unprecedented power over customer accounts with little recourse for dispute. The aim of this thesis is to present a high-level architectural design and a first working prototype of a periodical payment application that addresses issues inherent in Internet direct debit payments. It takes a novel approach for securing electronic payments by using X. 509 restricted proxy certifcates over Secure Socket Layer (SSL) to provide authentication, authorisation and non-repudiation services. To assure success of this proposal only currently available, standards compliant and industry supported technologies were utilised with emphasis placed on Web Services and related technologies such as, eXtensible Markup Language (XML) and Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP). The concept of electronic payments is hardly new and there is a signifcant amount of interest in improving its security model, most notably from Visa and MasterCard. Current applications, however, focus on single payment transactions ignoring the growing trend favouring periodical payments. The framework presented in this thesis attempts to fill a niche by delivering signifcant improvements to an essentially paper-based direct debit payment model that currently does not integrate well into a purely electronic environment...|$|R
