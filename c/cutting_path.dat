50|$|Once again, {{a process}} for {{producing}} flat profiles from sheet or plate metal, however with the introduction of an additional axis of rotation, the cutting head of a CNC Plasma Cutting machine can tilt whilst being taken through a conventional 2 dimensional <b>cutting</b> <b>path.</b> The result of this is cut edges at an angle other than 90 Degrees to the material surface, for example 30-45 Degree angles. This angle is continuous throughout the thickness of the material. This is typically applied in situations where the profile being cut is to be used as part of a welded fabrication as the angled edge forms part of the weld preparation. When the weld preparation is applied during the cnc plasma cutting process, secondary operations such as grinding or machining can be avoided, reducing cost. The angular cutting capability of 3 Dimensional plasma cutting {{can also be used to}} create countersunk holes and chamfer edges of profiled holes.|$|E
5000|$|In wire {{electrical}} {{discharge machining}} (WEDM), also known as wire-cut EDM and wire cutting, a thin single-strand metal wire, usually brass, is fed through the workpiece, submerged in a tank of dielectric fluid, typically deionized water. Wire-cut EDM is typically used to cut plates as thick as 300mm and to make punches, tools, and dies from hard metals that are difficult to machine with other methods. The wire, which is constantly fed from a spool, is held between upper and lower diamond guides. The guides, usually CNC-controlled, move in the x-y plane. On most machines, the upper guide can also move independently in the z-u-v axis, giving rise to the ability to cut tapered and transitioning shapes (circle on the bottom, square at the top for example). The upper guide can control axis movements in x-y-u-v-i-j-k-l-. This allows the wire-cut EDM to be programmed to cut very intricate and delicate shapes. The upper and lower diamond guides are usually accurate to 0.004 mm, and can have a <b>cutting</b> <b>path</b> or kerf as small as 0.021 mm using Ø 0.02 mm wire, though the average cutting kerf that achieves the best economic cost and machining time is 0.335 mm using Ø 0.25 mm brass wire. The reason that the cutting width is greater than the width of the wire is because sparking occurs from the sides of the wire to the work piece, causing erosion. This [...] "overcut" [...] is necessary, for many applications it is adequately predictable and therefore can be compensated for (for instance in micro-EDM this is not often the case). Spools of wire are long — an 8 kg spool of 0.25 mm wire is just over 19 kilometers in length. Wire diameter can be as small as [...] and the geometry precision is not far from ± [...] The wire-cut process uses water as its dielectric fluid, controlling its resistivity and other electrical properties with filters and de-ionizer units. The water flushes the cut debris away from the cutting zone. Flushing {{is an important factor in}} determining the maximum feed rate for a given material thickness.Along with tighter tolerances, multi axis EDM wire-cutting machining centers have added features such as multi heads for cutting two parts at the same time, controls for preventing wire breakage, automatic self-threading features in case of wire breakage, and programmable machining strategies to optimize the operation.Wire-cutting EDM is commonly used when low residual stresses are desired, because it does not require high cutting forces for removal of material. If the energy/power per pulse is relatively low (as in finishing operations), little change in the mechanical properties of a material is expected due to these low residual stresses, although material that hasn't been stress-relieved can distort in the machining process.The work piece may undergo a significant thermal cycle, its severity depending on the technological parameters used. Such thermal cycles may cause formation of a recast layer on the part and residual tensile stresses on the work piece. If machining takes place after heat treatment, dimensional accuracy will not be affected by heat treat distortion.|$|E

Most existing methods use the same triangle mesh for both visualization and collision handling, although the requirements {{for them in the}} interactive simulation are different. We introduce visual-collision binding between high-resolution visual meshes and low-resolution collision meshes, and thus extend the spatially reduced framework to support cutting. There are two phases in our framework: pre-processing and simulation. In the pre-processing phase, the fvisual-collision binding is built based on the computation of geodesic paths. In the simulation phase, the <b>cutting</b> <b>paths</b> are detected on the collision triangles and then mapped to local 2 D coordinates systems in which the intersections between visual mesh and the <b>cutting</b> <b>paths</b> are calculated.

40|$|Vibrations of a tool or a {{workpiece}} in cutting shorten tool life and deteriorate a surface roughness. In this research, we propose {{a method to}} reduce vibrations of the workpiece at a cutting point. An algorithm that generates a <b>cutting</b> <b>path</b> to minimize workpiece displacements at a cutting point is developed. In this algorithm, the <b>cutting</b> <b>path</b> is generated with changing feed directions, tool posture and material removal process by considering workpiece compliance matrices and cutting force vectors.

FEM (Finite Element Method) is used to calculate workpiece compliance matrices. SVD (Singular Value Decomposition) is used to calculate the direction which has the lowest compliance in the workpiece compliance matrices. Minimum workpiece displacement at a cutting point is calculated from these calculated results. The algorithm is applied to the <b>cutting</b> <b>path</b> of end milling for a simple bar and the <b>cutting</b> <b>path</b> is compared with two conventional cutting paths by conducting a simulation and a cutting test.

When modelling a multi-pass machining process, in order to predict distortion, the classical finite element method, using conforming meshes, faces limitations in flexibility and accuracy. Cutting paths cannot match the work-piece mesh before the simulation, since they are defined in the initial geometry {{and not in a}} deformed one. As a result, re-meshing is required between two machining passes.
