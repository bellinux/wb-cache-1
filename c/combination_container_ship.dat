Measured throughput with <b>Container</b> <b>Shipping</b> {{is up to}} seven times greater than with conventional Unix I/O. <b>Container</b> <b>Shipping</b> is an I/O data transfer mechanism composed of six system calls. Implemented {{as a supplement to}} or a replacement of a user-level I/O API, <b>Container</b> <b>Shipping</b> provides copy-free I/O through selective virtual memory remapping. Unlike related efforts, <b>Container</b> <b>Shipping</b> is not limited to one type of device, does not restrict access to data, and does not perform unnecessary memory mappings or copy-on-write operations. <b>Container</b> <b>Shipping</b> unconditionally eliminates copies by moving all data with virtual memory remapping. I/O data (in blocks of memory called Containers) is mapped in and out of process address spaces. Copy elimination provides a large reduction in latency and a corresponding improvement in throughput. <b>Container</b> <b>Shipping</b> also eliminates unnecessary memory mapping operations, by mapping data only as requested by a process, thereby providing additional latency and throughput gains. Because mapping is directed by user request, no expensive page faults are required to access data. Finally, <b>Container</b> <b>Shipping</b> makes possible additional optimizations which exploit the predictable behavior of long-lasting I/O pathways, for further performance gains.
