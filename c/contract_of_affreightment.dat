500|$|The act {{of hiring}} a ship to carry cargo is called chartering. [...] Tankers are hired by {{four types of}} charter agreements: the voyage charter, the time charter, the bareboat charter, and <b>contract</b> <b>of</b> <b>affreightment.</b> In a voyage charter the {{charterer}} rents the vessel from the loading port to the discharge port. In a time charter the vessel is hired for a set period of time, to perform voyages as the charterer directs. In a bareboat charter the charterer acts as the ship's operator and manager, taking on responsibilities such as providing the crew and maintaining the vessel. Finally, in a <b>contract</b> <b>of</b> <b>affreightment</b> or COA, the charterer specifies a total volume of cargo to be carried in a specific time period and in specific sizes, for example a COA could be specified as [...] of JP-5 in a year's time in [...] shipments.

50|$|The law, however, interferes to {{some extent}} in {{regulating}} the effect {{to be given to}} contracts. Certain contracts are forbidden by the law, and being illegal are therefore incapable of enforcement. The most important example of illegality in the case <b>of</b> <b>contracts</b> <b>of</b> <b>affreightment</b> is when the contract involves trading with an enemy.|$|R
50|$|A ship may be let, like a house, to {{a person}} who takes {{possession}} and control of it for a specified term. The person who hires a ship in this way occupies during the specified time the position of ship-owner. The contract under which a ship is so let may be called a charter-party—but it is not, properly speaking, a <b>contract</b> <b>of</b> <b>affreightment,</b> and is mentioned here only to clarify the distinction between a charter-party of this kind, which is sometimes called a demise of the ship, and a charter-party that is a <b>contract</b> <b>of</b> <b>affreightment.</b>|$|E
50|$|A <b>Contract</b> <b>of</b> <b>Affreightment</b> is a {{contract}} {{similar to a}} voyage charter, but ship-owner undertakes to carry a number of cargoes within a specified period of time on a specified route. Agreed frequency of cargoes may require more than one ship.|$|E
50|$|Where {{possession}} of a ship given to a hirer, who appoints his own master and crew, different considerations apply. However, though the contract by which the ship is let may be called a charter-party, it is not truly a <b>contract</b> <b>of</b> <b>affreightment.</b>|$|E

50|$|The owners, {{agents and}} masters of vessels loading in the United States of America are {{forbidden}} by {{an act of}} Congress, commonly called the Harter Act, passed in the year 1893, to insert in their <b>contracts</b> <b>of</b> <b>affreightment</b> any clause exempting the shipowner from liability for the negligence of his servants; but it {{is at the same time}} enacted that, provided all reasonable skill and care has been exercised by the shipowner to make the vessel seaworthy and fit for the voyage at its commencement, the shipowner shall not be liable for any loss caused by the negligence of the master or crew in the navigation of the vessel, or by perils of the sea or certain other causes set forth in the act.|$|R
5000|$|At common law, when {{goods are}} {{carried by sea}} by a “common carrier” (a public carrier), then, if the <b>contract</b> <b>of</b> {{carriage}} does not contain an exception clause relating to seaworthiness, there is an absolute undertaking that the vessel is seaworthy. Liability is “strict”**, meaning the carrier is liable {{even in the absence}} of negligence, as in Liver Alkali v Johnson. This does not mean the vessel need be capable of encountering any peril. The test of seaworthiness may be [...] "that the ship should be in a condition to encounter whatever perils of the sea a ship of that kind, and laden in that way, may be fairly expected to encounter in the voyage to be performed". However, the strict liability at common law is invariably modified in <b>contracts</b> <b>of</b> <b>affreightment.</b> In charter parties the shipowner may negotiate an express clause excluding his liability for unseaworthiness or he may, as it more usual, agree to incorporate the provisions of the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act 1971 into the charter.|$|R
50|$|The {{law with}} regard to the <b>contract</b> <b>of</b> <b>affreightment</b> is a branch of the general law of contract.

40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to critically assess the current status of the legal regime governing the international carriage of goods by sea, with the main focus being on the implied terms which form the foundation of international shipping law in general, and on the doctrine of deviation in particular. This will include a critical review of the rule against unjustified deviation in <b>contracts</b> <b>of</b> <b>affreightment</b> by posing the following questions: (i) Is the rule against unjustified deviation still relevant in the modern context of international carriage of goods by sea? In light of: The development of transport vessels, liberty clauses, different types of charterparties, and held cover clauses? (ii) Should the rule against unjustified deviation be treated any differently from other implied shipping terms? Is the rule against deviation an absolute obligation? Should unjustified deviation amount to fundamental breach <b>of</b> a <b>contract?</b> Should there not be some degree of flexibility in the judicial approach to the law on deviation? (iii) Do we need harmonisation, unification and interpretation of deviation rules? It is hoped that in attempting to answer these questions some light may be shed on this important area of shipping law...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} an effort to {{understand}} how the tramp shipping industry works, which is considered to work close to perfect competition model, where the atomicity, homogeneity and information transparency are evident. Many small shipping companies compete for a volatile and unpredictable demand. Despite there are some entry barriers to the market, these can be easily mitigated by the way this market works. Tramp shipping companies co-operate among them in pools, in order to bid for large <b>contracts</b> <b>of</b> <b>affreightment,</b> which otherwise, shipowners could not perform on their own. Tramp shipping pools raise competition concerns, and under the EU Competition Rules, these agreements shall be assessed on case-by-case basis in order to determine whether an agreement may jeopardise competition within common market. To do so, an assessment under Article 101 TFEU is required. Normally, tramp shipping pools created for the right purposes, do not entail competition restrictions. Conversely, those agreements that have a combined market share considerably high or involve hardcore restrictions, are prohibited under Article 101 (1). These agreements have three options: terminate their agreement; demonstrate that economic efficiencies brought by the agreement outweigh restrictions under Article 101 (3); and lastly and most appealing, try to restructure the agreement creating a full-function joint venture in order to fall under a more certain legal framework, the EC Merger Rules...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the application of}} the doctrine of frustration under the English private law <b>of</b> <b>contracts</b> to situations <b>of</b> capture of merchant ships for ransom by pirates operating according to the model which has developed in recent years off the coast of Somalia. The examination is centred on the question whether and how <b>contracts</b> <b>of</b> <b>affreightment</b> (or carriage <b>of</b> goods by sea) (including time and voyage charters as well as bills of lading) which may have been concluded by a captured ship would be terminated in the event of capture pursuant to the doctrine. The thesis analyses the wording <b>of</b> standard carriage <b>contract</b> forms and clauses, as well as the provisions of relevant international conventions and statutes, which could deal with the standing <b>of</b> <b>contracts</b> following a capture. The outcome of the research is that standard contract and clauses often leave the question of the fate <b>of</b> the <b>contract</b> in the event of capture untouched with the result that the doctrine of frustration may apply by default. The contract will only be terminated, however, if an elaborately long detention of the vessel is anticipated, or the prospects of recovery, either against payment of a ransom or through forceful repossession, are very weak. The thesis equally considers {{the application of the}} concept of self-induced frustration by taking several examples of actions or default by one of the parties to the <b>contract</b> <b>of</b> carriage which may have led to or exacerbated the capture scenario. The main findings are that it will usually be difficult to establish self-induced frustration in the event of capture. An analysis is also made of the application of the concepts of actual and constructive total loss under English marine insurance law to a ship that has been captured by pirates according to the same model of operation. The consequences of termination <b>of</b> the <b>contract</b> are not discussed in this thesis. <br/...|$|R

50|$|The freight market {{consists}} of shipowners, charterers and brokers.

40|$|The {{general area}} of this {{research}} is shipping law, more specifically the law governing the carriage of goods by sea. The research has been narrowed down to the implications <b>of</b> terms into <b>contracts</b> <b>of</b> <b>affreightment,</b> and then further narrowed down to the concept of deviation. The specific research {{question is whether or not}} the concept of deviation is still relevant to the law governing the carriage of goods by sea in the modern era. While this question has been posed before in the academic literature, it has never been discussed in sufficient depth. The researcher was therefore able to identify gaps in the literature through the literature review which the research has attempted to fill. The thesis on which the research is based is that the principle of deviation is a long standing and very important rule of law which form an integral part of the law and practice governing the carriage of goods by sea. However, a multi-jurisdictional review of both primary sources (i. e. conventions, statutes and cases) and secondary sources (academic literature) in relation to deviation indicates that there are many conceptual, legal and practical problems associated with the principle. Adding to this problem is the concept of quasi deviation in some jurisdictions such as the United States where there continues to be conflicting approaches to the concept even within the various federal circuits. Therefore the hypothesis of this study is based on the need for legal reform. Chapters 1 and 2 provide the background to the study as well as the conceptual framework for the research, including the literature review. The main research aims, objectives and research questions are addressed in Chapters 3, 4 and 5. Chapter 6 concludes the research by presenting the findings and recommendations together with an outline of the research contribution...|$|R
40|$|The present work is {{dedicated}} to the problem of cargo liability of P&I Clubs. The main idea is to examine the rules by which P&I Clubs are guided when providing the cover for cargo damages. Thus, through such examination I am trying to present P&I insurers’ legal field of action. Generally P&I insurance provides cover for cargo, more precisely, for liability related to cargo, when it is damaged, lost, delayed or delivered with shortage. On the Thesis’s pages we are taking a closer look at conditions under which the cover is provided, will inquire into background and rational behind them, will pick out and outline the common principles of the conditions of different P&I clubs, will emphasize the essential differences (if any) between these conditions, analyze exclusions from standard rules of cover, examine real situations and cases kindly provided by practicing actors. For practical reasons the present Thesis is based on Scandinavian experience. So, it means that I am going to examine and compare Rules of three Scandinavian P&I Clubs: Norwegian Assuranceforeningen Gard – gjensidig, Assuranceforeningen Skuld (Gjensidig) and Sveriges Ångfartygs Assurans Förening (The Swedish Club) in Sweden. For the sake of consistency we will take Gard’s Rule 34 – Cargo Liablity – as a sample model and follow the wording of this Rule while referring to and making parallels with Skuld’s and The Swedish Club’s Rules whenever needed. In addition to the core line in this Thesis I will touch upon some issues inevitably related to the carriage of goods in general and the carriage of goods by sea in particular, such as: international rules and regimes for cargo liability (e. g. : international conventions), <b>contracts</b> <b>of</b> <b>affreightment</b> (e. g. : charterparties), documents that regulate such carriages (e. g. : Bills of Lading), some actual and topical problems of today existing in this area etc. We will not deepen much and consider these issues too thoroughly as it may lead us far outside the core of the Thesis, but a quick consideration and discussion of the mentioned points is important in order to present the background for P&I clubs’ Rules where they actually stem from and to better understand their implication. Besides the theoretical literature I am going to use some materials from practice to illustrate the application of P&I clubs’ rules related to liability for cargo damage in real situations. These materials are real cases or claims which have been handled by practitioners and they show circumstances which constitute basis for declining the P&I cover by the insurer due to breach of the contractual obligations, non-conformity with clubs’ rules, violation of conventional terms etc...|$|R

40|$|AbstractIf {{there were}} no express {{provisions}} in the charter party as to seaworthiness or a ship owner's obligation to exercise reasonable dispatch, there is an implied obligation in common law. At other times, {{in the absence of}} an express term, the right to nominate a port does not give rise to a correlative warranty on the nomination to a safe port. Likewise, a change of circumstances occurring after the conclusion of the contract may be sufficient to discharge the parties from further performance of their contract. In common law, the shipper has an implied obligation to inform the ship owner on the dangerous nature of the shipped goods. Last but not least, whether the owner of the vessel operates a liner service or a under a charter undertakes that his vessel, while performing its obligations under the contract of carriage, will not deviate from the contract of carriage. Based on theoretical and jurisprudential aspects, this article aims to analyze the consequences of the ship owner's breach of the contract, the implications of express liberty clauses, and where appropriate, the Hague-Visby Rules incorporation effect. In conclusion, the obligations have different meanings depending on the type of the <b>contract</b> <b>of</b> <b>affreightment</b> and the circumstances in which the obligation must be fulfilled or the moment while operating...|$|E
