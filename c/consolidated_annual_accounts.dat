40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to identify, analyse and assess the main {{connections}} and implications of consolidated accounts on enterprise economy. Appearance of consolidated financial statements is intrinsically linked to certain concepts, such as group, control, the perimeter of consolidation, percentages of interests, methods of consolidation, or restatements. For a more complete view regarding <b>consolidated</b> <b>annual</b> <b>accounts,</b> it is necessary to delimit and define these particular elements. This approach targets the presentation of our vision over positioning, place and function of financial consolidated statements in the process of the financial report. The study envisages a summary and comparison of ideas found on this subject in thespecialty literature, the regulations developed by various international bodies. Thus, we think it will facilitate the correct positioning of the consolidated financial statements and the consolidated accounts’ concepts. To achieve the proposed desiderates, we have used a constructive methodology for identifying disagreements, approvals and development of a speech to more efficient and effective management of the mentioned concepts...|$|E
40|$|Cooperativist integration, {{an example}} of the sixth {{cooperative}} principle of inter-cooperation, means the concentration of cooperative enterprises. Of the different means of organization that are covered by the legislation on cooperatives, cooperative groups appear to be a similar concept to that of groups of corporations. However, there are actually {{significant differences between the two}} concepts due to the very nature of cooperative groups in the light of the cooperative formula as an independent entity. This paper analyses, on the one hand, to what degree it would be possible to transfer the principles that govern groups of corporations to the concept of cooperative groups and, on other hand, in what conditions and under what assumptions a cooperative enterprise could be a member of a mixed group consisting of cooperatives and other types of corporation. Our second objective will then be to determine, in this case, the requirements in terms of preparing <b>consolidated</b> <b>annual</b> <b>accounts,</b> if cooperative enterprises could be brought within the scope of consolidation, especially as a result of the new concept of “horizontal groups”, which has arisen as a consequence of the modification of company legislation in Spain prior to its adaptation to international accounting legislation. Cooperativist integration, cooperative groups, accounting consolidation, horizontal groups. ...|$|E

40|$|The {{process of}} {{accounting}} harmonization in Europe has started in 1978 with {{the adoption of}} the Fourth Council Directive 78 / 660 /EEC regarding the annual accounts of limited liability companies. The harmonization process continued with the regulation of the <b>consolidated</b> <b>annual</b> <b>accounts</b> with the enactment of the Seventh Council Directive 83 / 349 /EEC. In 2002 the European Parliament has adopted the EC Regulation No. 1606 / 2002 requiring all listed group entities within EU to apply the International Accounting Standards for their consolidated financial statements starting from 2005. This has led to the use of a dual accounting standardization as listed entities are required to use IAS/IFRS while non-listed entities use the national GAAP harmonized with the 4 th and 7 th directives. The adoption of the new accounting directive 2013 / 34 /EU does not solve this differentiation as it doesn't allow the option for national accounting regulators the use of IFRS for SMEs. Romania, {{as a member of the}} European Union, is no exception from this usage of a dual accounting standard. After the fall of the communist regime, Romania has modernized its accounting system by adopting a French inspired, EU 4 th directive compliant national GAAP. Between 2001 and 2005 there was a strong interest towards the adoption of IAS/IFRS that went beyond the scope of EC Regulation No. 1606 / 2002. This has changed in 2005 when IAS/IFRSs were considered as an option of additional voluntary disclosure. From 2006, Romania has aligned its national legislation to the requirements of EC Regulation No. 1606 / 2002. The application of this dual standard accounting system has been cumbersome especially for the entities that were required to prepare two different annual accounts, one using IAS/IFRS and one using Romanian GAAP. This obstacle has been overcome in 2012 when certain entities were allowed to prepare their financial statements using only IFRS...|$|E

For Romania, the financial audit was not a tradition. Recognized as a top area of the accounting profession, financial audit was legislated in 1999. Statutory audit, audit of annual financial statements or <b>consolidated</b> <b>annual</b> statements have been established 9 years later (Emergency Regulation no. 90 June 24, 2008), by transposing Directive 2006 / 43 /EC of 17 May 2006 of the European Parliament and of Council on statutory audit of <b>annual</b> <b>accounts</b> and <b>consolidated</b> accounts, {{in order to ensure}} oversight of auditors, in the public interest. statutory audit, financial statements, decisions, management, public interest entities, "International Standards on Auditing. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{introduction}} of Ias-Ifrs for italian small and medium size enterprises (SME’s) is very significant and quite complex. In fact, {{the small and}} medium size enterprises, in particular the not-listed companies, may choose between the Ias-based accounting rules and the civil code-based ones in making <b>annual</b> <b>accounts.</b> In case of voluntary adoption of Ias-Ifrs by SME’s some critical matters emerge: the transition to Ias-Ifrs seems to point out various advantages, but also some risks and problems; so, <b>annual</b> <b>accounts</b> will be certainly more comparables in the UE context; otherwise, due to double regulation in Italy – one Ias-based (for listed companies and for companies which can choose this approach), and the other, civil code-based – we’ll probably meet some difficulties in comprehension and comparison of <b>annual</b> <b>accounts.</b> The aim of the paper is to make evident, both by a theoretical and empirical point of view, the main differences, for small and medium size enterprises, between the <b>annual</b> <b>accounts</b> Ias-based and the <b>annual</b> <b>accounts</b> civil code-based; moreover, it aims to explain if these differences will really cause changes not only in accounting rules and policies, but also in cultural approach for companies, financial community and the whole accounting profession...|$|R

Investors have required more information also about how sustainability issues and initiatives are expected to contribute to the long-term growth strategy of a business. This communication, which should be provided by top management, leads toward the convergence of sustainability and financial reporting into a single “narrative. ” Both financial reporting and non-financial reporting together provide all stakeholders with a comprehensive view of the position and performance of a company. This process has also been encouraged by some European regulations.
