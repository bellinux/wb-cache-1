40|$|Consumer risk {{preferences}} over income {{are derived}} from the optimal consumption bundle purchased at each income, via {{the construction of an}} indirect uility function. The paper shows that, even though an individual may exhibit risk averse preferences over a wide income range, consumer theory predicts that the opportunity to acquire high-priced luxury goods can induce a convexity in the indirect utility function at higher income levels. Thus, instead of being an anomaly, variations in risk preferences over income (which can give rise to <b>concurrent</b> <b>insurance</b> and gambling behaviour) appear to stem from straightforward rational utility maximising behaviour when individuals consume the luxuries of life...|$|E
40|$|Most {{cases of}} adult-onset {{tuberculosis}} (TB) result from reactivation of a pre-existing Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection. Mycobacterium tuberculosis usually invades the respiratory tract and most patients develop intrapulmonary TB; however, some patients develop concurrent pulmonary and extra-pulmonary TB. The {{purpose of the}} present study was to identify the demographic and clinical factors associated with an increased risk of concurrent extra-pulmonary diseases in patients with pulmonary TB. We compared patients who had isolated pulmonary TB with patients who had concurrent pulmonary and extra-pulmonary TB. We initially analyzed one-million randomly selected subjects from the population-based Taiwan National Health Insurance database. Based on analysis of 5414 pulmonary TB patients in this database, women were more likely than men to have concurrent extra-pulmonary TB (OR: 1. 30, p =  0. 013). A separate analysis of the Kaohsiung Medical University Hospital database, which relied on sputum culture-proven pulmonary TB, indicated that women were more likely than men to have concurrent extra-pulmonary TB (OR: 1. 62, p =  0. 039). There was no significant gender difference in extra-pulmonary TB for patients younger than 45 years in either database. However, for patients 45 years and older, women were more likely than men to have <b>concurrent</b> extra-pulmonary TB (<b>insurance</b> database: 9. 0 % vs. 6. 8 %, p =  0. 016, OR: 1. 36; hospital database: 27. 3 % vs. 16. 0 %, p =  0. 008, OR =  1. 98). Our results indicate that among patients who have pulmonary TB, older females have an increased risk for concurrent extra-pulmonary TB...|$|R
