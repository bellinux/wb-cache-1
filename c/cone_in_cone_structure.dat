40|$|Based on a High-Resolution 3 D seismic block {{acquired}} in the Gulf of Lion in 2004 – 2005 we investigated fluid pipes and pockmarks {{on the top of}} the interfluve between the Hérault canyon and the Bourcart canyon both created by turbidity currents and gravity flows from the shelf to the deep basin in the north-western Mediterranean Sea. Combining the geometry of the potential fluid pipes with the induced deformation of surrounding sediments leads then to the ability to differentiate between potential fluid sources (root vs source) and to better estimate the triggering mechanisms (allochtonous vs. autochtonous cause). We linked together a set of derived attributes, such as Chaos and RMS amplitude, to a 3 D description of pipes along which fluids may migrate. As previously shown in other basins, the induced deformation, creating <b>cone</b> <b>in</b> <b>cone</b> or V-shaped <b>structures,</b> may develop in response to the fluid pipe propagation in unconsolidated sediments in the near surface. The level at the top of a <b>cone</b> <b>structure</b> is diachronous. It means that stratigraphic levels over this surface are deformed at the end of the migration. They collapse forming a depression called a pockmark. These pipes are the result of repeated cycles of fluid expulsion that might be correlated with rapid sea-level rise instead of sediment loading. The most recent event (MIS 2. 2 stage) has led to the formation of a pockmark on the modern seafloor. It has been used as a reference for calculating the effect of a rapid sea-level rise on fluid expulsion. As all physical and geometrical parameters are constrained, we were able to define that a +[*] 34 [*]m of sea level rise may account for triggering fluid expulsion from a very shallow silty-sandy layer at 9 [*]m below seafloor since the last glacial stage. This value is consistent with a sea level rise of about 102 [*]m during this period. This study shows that the episodic nature of fluid release resulted from hydromechanical processes during sea-level rise due to the interactivity between high pressure regimes and principal in situ stresses...|$|R

40|$|Inherited retinal {{diseases}} {{include a}} number of disorders which typically affect photoreceptor/retinal pigment epithelial function, {{and can lead to}} severe visual impairment. Advances in molecular genetics have allowed the identification of many of the genes responsible for particular conditions, and progress in viral gene transfer technology has enabled the replacement of specific genes into the retina. The first human clinical trial of gene therapy for inherited retinal disease was carried out at Moorfields Eye Hospital and UCL Institute of Ophthalmology, involving 12 patients with RPE 65 deficiency - an early-onset retinal dystrophy. The results from this trial are described and provide evidence for the safe administration of viral vectors in the eye, and also demonstrate improvements in retinal function in {{a number of}} patients. However, the extent and duration of the response did not match that observed in prior animal studies, suggesting improvements in gene expression level may be required in humans. In addition, consideration for future involvement of the foveal region is highlighted, since retinal thinning was observed in a number of patients following subretinal delivery. Achromatopsia is an inherited disorder of congenitally absent cone photoreceptor function. Gene replacement therapy in animal models of achromatopsia has shown evidence of restored cone function, suggesting that this condition may be an appropriate target for gene therapy in humans. Recent studies have suggested that achromatopsia is a progressive condition with deterioration <b>in</b> <b>cone</b> <b>structure</b> with age, implying that the window of opportunity for therapeutic intervention may be narrow. In this study of retinal structure and function (in preparation for a gene therapy trial) in 40 patients with achromatopsia, an age-associated deterioration <b>in</b> <b>cone</b> <b>structure</b> was not identified, suggesting that the age range for potential intervention is wider than recently suggested, and prospective patients should be assessed on an individual basis, irrespective of age...|$|R

30|$|The cone {{condition}} class model {{captured the}} variation of sugar pine cone physical characteristics. Cone length and diameter increase substantially during cone growth (Figure 2). Cone morphology also changes—small, immature cones have a closed structure of imbricate scales forming a dense shell, resulting in higher bulk density.

40|$|The dynamic {{properties}} of the microcircuitry formed by <b>cones</b> and horizontal cells <b>in</b> the isolated goldfish retina were studied. Cones project to horizontal cells and horizontal cells feed back to cones via a relatively slow negative feedback pathway. The time constant of the feedback signal <b>in</b> <b>cones</b> and of the effect this feedback signal had on the responses of second-order neurons was determined using whole-cell patch clamp and intracellular recording techniques. It {{was found that the}} feedback signal <b>in</b> <b>cones</b> had a time constant of around 80 ms, whereas the time constant of the effect this feedback signal had on the second-order neurons ranged from 36 to 116 ms. This range of time constants can be accounted for by the non-linearity of the Ca 2 + current <b>in</b> the <b>cones.</b> <b>In</b> depolarized <b>cones,</b> the feedback-mediated response <b>in</b> second-order neurons had a similar time constant to that of the direct light response of the <b>cone,</b> whereas <b>in</b> hyperpolarized <b>cones,</b> the time constant of the feedback-mediated response in second-order neurons was considerably larger. Further, it was shown that there was no delay in the feedback pathway. This is in contrast to what has been deduced from the response properties of second-order neurons. In one type of horizontal cell, the responses to red light were delayed relative to the responses to green light. This delay in the second-order neurons can be accounted for by the interaction of the direct light response of the medium-wavelength-sensitive cones (M-cones) with the feedback response of the M-cones received from the horizontal cells...|$|R

30|$|Burning {{characteristics}} of sugar pine cones depended on developmental stage {{and degree of}} decomposition, supporting our initial hypothesis. Changes <b>in</b> <b>cone</b> physical <b>structure</b> associated with maturation—increasing cone mass and decreasing cone bulk density—precipitate accompanying changes <b>in</b> how <b>cones</b> function as surface fuels. Bulk density shares an inverse relationship with flame length, burning time, and percent mass loss (Figure 3): as cones mature they become increasingly flammable, consistent with previous work on bulk density (Burgan and Rothermel 1984). The low bulk density and high flammability of mature cones likely results from the open <b>structure</b> of mature <b>cones,</b> which increases the surface area to volume ratio, allowing for more rapid heating and drying during combustion compared to that for aborted juvenile cones.|$|R

At 4 weeks of age, a mouse model of LCA lacking AIPL 1 exhibits complete degeneration of both rod and cone photoreceptors.

The immunocytochemical results demonstrate that in both the Siberian hamster and the pouched mouse all retinal cones contain two visual pigments.
