40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{consists of}} two important research topics from service and health care operations. The topics are linked by their operational importance and by the underlying technical methodology required {{in the analysis of}} each. In {{the first part of the}} dissertation, we study the resource allocation problem of a profit maximizing service firm that dynamically allocates its resources towards acquiring new clients and retaining unsatisfied existing ones. We formulate the problem as a dynamic program in which the firm makes decisions in both acquisition and retention, and characterize the structure of the optimal acquisition and retention strategy. We show that the optimal strategy in each period is determined by several critical numbers, such that when the firm's customer base is small, the firm will primarily spend in acquisition, while shifting gradually towards retention as it grows. Eventually, when large enough, the firm spends less in both acquisition and retention. Our model and results differ from the existing literature because we have a dynamic model and find the existence of a region on which acquisition and retention both decrease. We extend our model in several important directions to show the robustness of our results. The second part of this dissertation examines the recent phenomenon in health care of copay coupons; coupons offered by drug manufacturers intended to be used by those already with prescription drug coverage. There have been claims that such coupons significantly increase insurer costs without much benefit to patients, who incur lower out-of-pocket expenses with coupons but may eventually see higher costs passed to them. In this research, we analyze how copay <b>coupons</b> affect patients, <b>insurance</b> companies, and drug manufacturers, while addressing the question of whether insurance companies always benefit from a copay coupon ban. We find that copay coupons tend to benefit drug manufacturers with large profit margins relative to other manufacturers, while generally, but not always, benefiting patients. While often helping drug manufacturers and increasing insurer costs, we also find scenarios in which copay coupons benefit both patients and insurers. Thus, a blanket ban on copay coupons would not necessarily benefit insurance companies in all cases...|$|R
