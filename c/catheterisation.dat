40|$|Continuous Ambulatory Hemodynamic Monitoring with an ImplantableSystem The Feasibility of a New Technique Åke Ohlsson Patients {{with chronic}} heart failure {{constitute}} an increasingly large group. Despiterecent therapeutic improvements, these patients have a poor prognosis. The diagnosisand the often complex pharma cological treatment are commonly evaluated and guidedby physical examinations and non-invasive measurements, although the relationshipbetween clinical signs and central hemodynamics is less obvious during the chronicphase of the disease. Access to invasive hemodynamic {{information should be}} of importance,but traditional <b>catheterisations</b> only give a snapshot of a supine patient. Long-termmonitoring should be useful but is difficult to achieve with the conventional catheterisationtechniques. The present study was performed to evaluate an implantable hemodynamicmonitoring system, capable of long-term measurements and storage of recorded data. Development of the system was based on available pacemaker technology and the externaldesign was similar to an ordinary pacing system. Sensors for continuous measurementsof oxygen saturation and pressure were incorporated in leads that were connectedto a monitor and memory unit contained within an ordinary pacemaker can. The sensor-carryingleads were positioned in the right ventricle, where mixed venous oxygen saturationcould accurately be measured compared to values obtained from the pulmonary artery. Diastolic pulmonary arterial pressure could be adequately estimated from the rightventricular pressure {{at the time of}} maximum dP/dt. These findings showed that importanthemodynamic parameters could be obtained from a right ventricular lead position avoidingthe pulmonary artery, which may impose a risk of dislodgement during long-term monitoring. A monitoring system with one oxygen sensor and one sensor for relative pressurevalues was implanted in five patients with severe cardio-pulmonary disease duringseven to 16 months. Another system in which the absolute pressures could be recordedwas implanted in 21 patients with severe heart failure. Acceptable recordings wereobtained for at least 12 months from 18 of these 26 systems without any serious monitor-relatedcomplications. The patients accepted the implanted monitors without concern. Recordings from the pressure sensors for absolute values were strongly correlatedto pressure obtained from a Swan Ganz catheter during repeated <b>catheterisations.</b> Directional and magnitudinal changes in pressure were adequately expressed by thesensor for relative values. The oxygen sensor failure rate was unacceptably highalthough the accuracy and long-term stability of the non-failing sensors were adequatecompared with oxygen saturation in blood, sampled from the pulmonary artery. Themonitoring system was capable of recording and storing hemodynamic parameters withvariable resolution, from low to high. During long-term recordings during daily lifethe recorded parameters adequately reflected hemodynamic changes related to everydayactivities. Based on oxygen saturation values from the implantable monitor, cardiacoutput could be "semi-invasively" obtained with a strong correlation withcardiac output determined during conventional <b>catheterisations.</b> Long-term ambulatoryhemodynamic monitoring was feasible and recorded data may be of value in the clinicalmanagement of heart failure.

40|$|Abstract Background Urological {{complications}} are {{the major}} cause of ill health in patients with spina bifida. Urinary sepsis accounted {{for the majority of}} admissions in patients with spina bifida. As the patient grows older, changes occur in the adult bladder, leading to increases in storage pressure and consequent risk of deterioration of renal function, which may occur insidiously. Case presentation A 34 -year-old male spinal bifida patient had been managing neuropathic bladder by penile sheath. Intravenous urography revealed normal kidneys. This patient was advised intermittent <b>catheterisations.</b> But self-catheterisation was not possible because of long, overhanging prepuce and marked spinal curvature. This patient developed repeated urine infections. Five years later, ultrasound examination of urinary tract revealed hydronephrotic right kidney with echogenic debris within the collecting system. There was no evidence of dilatation of the ureter near the vesicoureteric junction. The left kidney appeared normal. There was no evidence of calculus disease seen in either kidney. Indwelling urethral catheter drainage was established. Two years later, MAG- 3 renogram revealed normal uptake and excretion by left kidney. The right kidney showed little functioning tissue. Following a routine change of urethral catheter this patient became unwell. Ultrasound examination revealed hydronephrotic right kidney containing thick hyper-echoic internal septations and debris in the right renal pelvis suspicious of pyonephrosis. Under both ultrasound and fluoroscopic guidance, an 8 French pig tail catheter was inserted into the right renal collecting system. 150 [*]ml of turbid urine was aspirated immediately. This patient developed large left pleural effusion, collapse/consolidation of the left lower lobe, a large fluid collection in the abdomen extending into the pelvis and expired twenty days later because of sepsis and respiratory failure. Conclusion Although penile sheath drainage may be convenient for a spina bifida patient and the carers, hydronephrosis can occur insidiously. With recurrent urine infections, hydronephrotic kidney can become pyonephrosis, which is life-threatening. Therefore, every effort should be made to carry out intermittent <b>catheterisations</b> along with antimuscarinic drug therapy. </p...|$|R

Thirty-five patients were studied both at rest and during supine exercise. In most patients, the relation between oxygen consumption and cardiac output was normal during exercise. The stroke index and right ventricular end-diastolic pressure at rest and on exercise were compared in 34 patients. Seventeen showed a normal response to exercise. In the other 17 patients, right ventricular end-diastolic pressure rose on exercise; in 5 of these the stroke index fell during exercise, indicating abnormal myocardial response.

40|$|Objective: Evaluation of Botulinum Toxin-A (BTX-A) as an {{alternative}} treatment option in patients whom previous treatments were failed. Methods: Between March 2005 and September 2006, a total 19 patients; 16 patients with overactive bladder (5 neurologic, 11 idiopathic), 2 with nocturnal enuresis, 1 with interstitial cystitis, intravesical BTX-A injection was applied. Except one patient, 18 patients with a median age 46 (20 - 80) were registered to the study. Patients were examined at postoperative 3 weeks and 6 months with ICIQ-SF (International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire-Short Form) and satisfaction forms used in our clinic. Results: The median follow-up time was 16 months (6 - 18). When evaluated according to diagnosis, symptoms were improved 100 % in neurologic overactive bladder (5 / 5), 80 % in idiopathic overactivity (8 / 10), 50 % in nocturnal enuresis (1 / 2). In one patient with interstitial cystitis there was no improvement. Median efficiency time of BTX-A treatment was 6 months (1 - 17). At 3 weeks and 6 months after the treatment, ICIQ-SF score was decreased to 3. 6 and 7. 5 respectively from preoperative level of 18. 7. Quality of life scores at preoperative, 3 week and 6 months were 9. 7, 2. 7 and 4. 3 respectively. Except 3 patients with overactive neurologic bladder because of spinal cord injury, symptoms of patients with pollacuria and nocturia decreased at 3. week. Even if these rates increased at 6 months they still were significantly less than preoperative status. The spinal cord injured 3 patients had clean intermittent catheterization per 1 hour and had urinary incontinence between the catheterizations preoperatively, however at 3 weeks and 6 months the intervals of <b>catheterisations</b> was 4 hours and 3 hours respectively and also the urinary incontinance between the <b>catheterisations</b> improved. At patient satisfactions, 78 % of patients declared that they were pleased and underwent the procedure again and will recommend it to their relatives with similar problems.

40|$|The haemodynamic {{effects of}} a new beta 1 -adrenoceptor partial agonist, ICI 118, 587, were studied in 10 {{patients}} with dilated cardiomyopathy and moderate to severe cardiac failure. Simultaneous right and left heart <b>catheterisations</b> were performed. Resting central haemodynamic indices were measured before and 15 min after an intravenous dose of 0. 05 mg/kg and then 15 min after an additional intravenous dose of 0. 15 mg/kg of ICI 118, 587. Left ventricular performance was improved [...] as shown by significant increases in systolic left ventricular pressure, maximum rate of rise in left ventricular pressure (dP/dt max), and cardiac output {{and a decrease in}} left ventricular end diastolic pressure [...] without an undesirable increase in heart rate. The top of the dose response curve was reached after the lower dose. An important unwanted effect was seen in the most severely diseased patient, whose left ventricular systolic pressure, dP/dt max, and cardiac output decreased. This was probably due to the drug's antagonistic property supervening in this patient, who probably had high concentrations of circulating catecholamines.

A medical history of left heart disease, S deflection in V 1 plus R deflection in V 6 in millimetres on ECG, and left atrial dilation or left valvular heart disease that is worse than mild on echocardiography were independent predictors of LHF. The derived risk score system showed good predictive characteristics: R 2 = 0. 66 and area under the curve 0. 93. In patients with a risk score ≥ 72, there is 100 % certainty that the cause of pulmonary hypertension is LHF. Using this risk score system, the number of right heart <b>catheterisations</b> in LHF may be reduced by 20 %.

40|$|Interventional {{cardiology}} is {{a catheter}} based treatment modality for non surgical treatment of certain cardiac defects through venous and arterial access to restore normal or near normal haemodynamics. Before 1980, lesions which required interventions were either surgically palliated or corrected. Although {{the first successful}} paediatric intervention, balloon atrial septostomy by Rashkind and Miller was performed in 1966 1, the era of paediatric intervention really began with pulmonary balloon valvuloplasty by Kan et al in 1982 2. Since then there have been explosive developments in this field {{and it is now}} possible to deal with a multitude of paediatric cardiac lesions through transvenous approach. The goals of such interventions should be safety, effectiveness and wide applicability with clinically acceptable results. More than half of all paediatric <b>catheterisations</b> are now related to interventional procedures and it has become a crucial aspect in the management of children with heart disease. Catheter techniques have become the accepted and preferred curative therapy for many acyanotic congenital heart defects. This tremendous development is mainly due to two reasons. First is the availability of better imaging modalities in the form of echocardiography (transthoracic, transoesophageal, intracardiac). Second is the innovation and refinement of hardware used in interventions such as catheters, guidewires, coils, devices, percutaneous valves and stents. In this respect the efforts made to achieve clinical excellence by clinicians and researchers have gone a long way {{in the development of the}} field.

40|$|PURPOSE: The {{incidence}} of iatrogenic femoral artery pseudoaneurysms {{is reported to}} occur in 1 - 7 % by of all percutaneous <b>catheterisations.</b> These pseudoaneurysms are traditionally treated by ultrasound-guided compression or surgical repair. We report our experience in sealing postcatheterization femoral pseudoaneurysms with percutaneous thrombin injection under colour-Doppler ultrasound guidance. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Since June 2000 we have consecutively treated 31 pseudoaneurysms in 30 patients, (14 males and 16 females, age range 45 to 81 years); in one patient the pseudoaneurysm was bilateral. All patients had a clinical diagnosis of postcatheterization femoral pseudoaneurysm, later confirmed by colour-Doppler ultrasonography. We injected a bovine thrombin solution percutaneously at a concentration of 1000 U/mL using 21 - 22 gauge needles under colour Doppler ultrasound guidance. All patients underwent clinical and colour-Doppler US examination before, during and 24 hours after the procedure and were followed up after 1 and 3 months. RESULTS: The primary success rate was 83. 8 %. Complete and persistent occlusion of the pseudoaneurysm was achieved in less than 20 seconds by administering an average dose of 880 U of thrombin (0. 8 mL of solution). In 5 cases (16. 1 %) reperfusion of the pseudoaneurysm was observed within 24 hours. These patients underwent a repeat procedure. The final result was successful in 96. 7 % of patients (30 of 31 cases). No thromboembolic complication was observed. Only 22. 5 % of patients reported a heat sensation in the treated limb, which resolved spontaneously within minutes. CONCLUSIONS: The percutaneous injection of thrombin under ultrasound colour-Doppler guidance {{should be regarded as}} the first choice treatment for postcatheterization femoral pseudoaneurysms, owing to its simplicity, safety, effectiveness and inexpensiveness...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Children with aortic coarctations (CoA) are {{increasingly}} percutaneously treated. Good visualisation of the CoA is mandatory {{and can be}} obtained with three-dimensional rotational angiography (3 DRA). This study aims to compare the diagnostic and therapeutic additional value of 3 DRA with conventional biplane angiography (CA) in children with a CoA. METHODS: Patients undergoing percutaneous treatment of CoA with balloon angioplasty (BA) or stent between 2003 and 2015, were retrospectively reviewed on success rate, complications, radiation and technical settings. Diagnostic quality of CA and 3 DRA and additional value of 3 DRA were scored. RESULTS: In total, 134 patients underwent 183 <b>catheterisations,</b> 121 CA and 62 3 DRA-guided. Median age was 0. 52 years in the BA group and 11. 19 years in the stent group. 3 DRA was superior to CA in displaying the left ventricle (p = 0. 008), ascending aorta (p < 0. 001), aortic arch (p = 0. 005) and coronary arteries (p < 0. 001). In the BA group, 3 DRA had a significantly higher success rate than CA (100. 0 [*]% versus 68. 9 [*]%, p = 0. 016). All stent interventions were successful. Complication rates did not differ significantly. The median total dose area product did not significantly differ between CA and 3 DRA in the BA (27. 88 μGym(2) /kg versus 15. 81 μGym(2) /kg, p = 0. 275) or stent group (37. 34 μGym(2) /kg versus 45. 24 μGym(2) /kg, p = 0. 090). 3 DRA was of additional value in 96. 8 [*]% of the interventions.

40|$|Case summary A 9 -year male {{neutered}} domestic longhair cat {{was referred}} to our hospital for investigation of recurrent urinary tract obstruction. The clinical signs had started 12 months earlier and the cat had been catheterised on multiple occasions. Clinical examination and abdominal ultrasound of the abdomen was unremarkable but examination of the penis revealed it to be prolapsed and extremely erythematous and friable. A retrograde contrast urethrocystogram was performed, showing extravasation of the contrast medium and establishing the presence of partial leakage or a tear of the urethra. In subsequent radiographs, the contrast was seen being rapidly absorbed into the pelvic and systemic vasculature via the penile veins, internal and external pudendal veins, internal and external iliac veins, and, ultimately, the caudal vena cava. Later, the contrast medium was seen within the renal pelves. Retrograde urethrocystography revealed stenosis and irregularities of the caudal urethral mucosa consistent with strictures. A routine perineal urethrostomy was performed and the cat recovered well. Conclusions and relevance Rapid vascular absorption of extravasated contrast medium has not been reported before. In this case, the increased blood supply to the distal urethra and penis is likely secondary to (chronic) inflammation, {{as demonstrated by the}} urethral strictures and the friable, oedematous nature of the penis. Whether the inflammation was caused by chronic obstruction or repeated iatrogenic trauma, or a combination of these factors, will remain debatable. Nonetheless, this case demonstrates that when a retrograde contrast urethrocystogram is considered, it is imperative that a contrast medium (or other intraurethral medication such as local anaesthesia) is chosen that is safe for intravascular use. Equally, an absolute aseptic technique is essential considering the potential for contaminants to be absorbed quite rapidly into the systemic circulation. Multiple <b>catheterisations</b> should be avoided when there is chronic inflammation, and alternative options should be considered when chronic disease is suspected...|$|R

MethodsMedical trainees were trained in the CAS procedure and randomised to a PTr or FTr of a challenging CAS case (Type-II arch). PTr consisted of 30 min of repeated <b>catheterisations</b> of the common carotid artery (CCA). Thereafter, both groups performed the CAS procedure in a fully functional simulated operating suite (SOS) with an interventional team. Technical performances were assessed using simulator-based metrics and expert ratings. Other aspects of performance were assessed using the Non-Technical Skills for Surgeons (NOTSS) scoring. ResultsTwenty trainees were evenly randomised to either PTr or FTr. No differences in performance were seen except for the total time the embolic protection device (EPD) was deployed (9. 4 min for the PT vs. 8. 1 min for the FT, p= 0. 02). Total time (26. 3 vs. 25. 5 min, p= 0. 94), fluoroscopy time (15. 8 vs. 14. 4 min, p= 0. 68), number of roadmaps (10. 5 vs. 11. 0, p= 0. 54), amount of contrast (53. 5 vs. 58. 0 ml, p= 0. 33), time to deploy the EPD (0. 9 vs. 0. 8 min, p= 0. 31) and time to catheterise the CCA (9. 2 vs. 8. 9 min, p= 0. 94) were similar. Qualitative performances as measured by expert ratings (score 24 vs. 24, p= 0. 49) and NOTSS (p> 0. 05 for all categories) were also comparable.

40|$|Abstract Background: The {{patent ductus arteriosus}} with {{left-to-right shunt}} leads to lung flooding, left {{ventricular}} load, pulmonary arterial hypertension, heart failure and reversal of shunt with Eisenmenger´s reaction. In case of pharmacotherapy failure, percutaneous PDA closure is the first-line therapy for children weighing more than 6 kg. For Children weighing less than 6 kg the miniaturized devices are not approved yet but used as off-label treatment. Objective: To date the guidelines of the interventional PDA closure in premature infants and children less than 6 kg are insufficient. Aim {{of the study is}} to evaluate safety and effectivity of coils and devices as off-label therapy for these children. Methods: In a retrospective data analysis we investigated the data of 68 children weighing less than 6 kg who underwent interventional PDA closure at Deutsches Herzzentrum and Virchow Klinikum Charité Berlin from 2004 to 2013 with a follow-up until the end of 2014. Results: The median age, weight, PDA-diameter and -length have been 89 (15 - 342) d, 3, 95 (2, 21 - 5, 93) kg, 3, 28 (0, 5 - 8) mm and 7, 1 (2, 6 - 15, 0) mm, the median fluoroscopy time and dose-area product takes 7, 05 (0 - 66, 3) min and 676 (0 - 13882) mGy · cm². Ten premature infants, 33 former premature infants and 25 full-term infants got an ADO- or AVP-Device, Nit-Occlud® PDA or Coil implanted. In 62 children interventional PDA closure was successful on first try. In six cases surgical revision was needed. Complications occurred in 25. 0 % (17 / 68) of the patients, including two device-dislocations but no death. 75. 0 % (51 / 68) of the cardiac <b>catheterisations</b> went without any major or minor complications. In a follow-up study 54 patients with primary successful intervention were observed for a mean time of 19. 2 (1. 5 - 96. 2) months. Three patients showed late deaths of different etiology and two had a residual shunt. Discussion: The percutaneous PDA closure of premature infants and full-term infants with a body weight between two and six kilograms is safe and effective, particularly with the ADO II AS. The therapy should be selected individually with consideration of the clinical situation of the child, the experience of the treating physician and surgeon as well as the most recent scientific findings.
