50|$|Filipino <b>community</b> <b>organizers</b> melded Alinsky's {{ideas with}} {{concepts}} from liberation theology, a pro-poor theological {{movement in the}} developing world, and the philosophy of Brazilian educationalist Paulo Freire. They found this community organizing a well-suited method to work among the poor during the martial law era of the dictator Ferdinand Marcos. Unlike the communist guerrillas, <b>community</b> <b>organizers</b> quietly worked to encourage critical thinking about the status quo, facilitate organization and the support the solving of concrete collective problems. Community organizing was thus able {{to lay the groundwork}} for the People Power Revolution of 1986, which nonviolently pushed Marcos out of power.|$|R
50|$|Unlike {{those who}} promote more-consensual <b>community</b> building, <b>community</b> <b>organizers</b> {{generally}} assume that social change necessarily involves conflict and social struggle {{in order to}} generate collective power for the powerless. Community organizing has as a core goal the generation of durable power for an organization representing the community, allowing it to influence key decision-makers {{on a range of}} issues over time. In the ideal, for example, this can get community-organizing groups a place at the table before important decisions are made. <b>Community</b> <b>organizers</b> work with and develop new local leaders, facilitating coalitions and assisting in the development of campaigns.|$|R

Before attending Harvard Law School, Obama decided to visit relatives in Kenya. He recounts part of this experience in the final, emotional third of the book.
