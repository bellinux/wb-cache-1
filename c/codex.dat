5|$|Five single {{sheets of}} bark paper were found {{associated}} with the <b>codex,</b> they had no stucco coating and were brown and water stained. Two of these had adhered to the <b>codex</b> {{and the other three}} may have once been with the <b>codex</b> but had separated. One of these sheets had a painted line in the same red hematite pigment used in the <b>codex</b> itself. A smaller sheet of bark paper was attached to the lined sheet and this smaller piece was submitted for radiocarbon dating. This testing produced a date for the sheet of AD 1230 ± 130; this would date the document {{to the end of the}} Early Postclassic period (c. 950–1200) and would make the <b>codex</b> the oldest known surviving Mesoamerican <b>codex.</b> The lack of incrustations or insect damage to the <b>codex</b> suggests that, if genuine, it was stored inside a container for hundreds of years. The overall damaged state of the <b>codex</b> conflicts with the good preservation of surviving parts; it may be that the damaged <b>codex</b> was deliberately decommissioned as a ritual object, rather than being simply discarded.|$|E
5|$|For {{most of the}} New Testament, <b>Codex</b> Sinaiticus is {{in general}} {{agreement}} with <b>Codex</b> Vaticanus Graecus 1209 and <b>Codex</b> Ephraemi Rescriptus, attesting the Alexandrian text-type.|$|E
5|$|It is a palimpsest, {{the whole}} book {{is known as}} <b>Codex</b> Guelferbytanus 64 Weissenburgensis. The upper text is in Latin, it {{contains}} Isidore of Seville's Origines and his six letters. The lower text of the <b>codex</b> belongs to several much earlier manuscripts, such as <b>Codex</b> Guelferbytanus A, <b>Codex</b> Guelferbytanus B, and <b>Codex</b> Carolinus.|$|E
50|$|<b>Codexes</b> for {{particular}} armies were introduced {{for the second}} edition of the game. The third edition rendered these obsolete, and a new series began, including introducing <b>codexes</b> for battlezones and campaigns. Until superseded by newer versions, the 3rd edition and later <b>codexes</b> remained valid for the newer editions of Warhammer 40,000. Games Workshop no longer produce campaign or battlezone <b>codexes,</b> instead releasing 'expansions'. 'Codex' is now a term solely used for army books.|$|R
50|$|The {{range of}} <b>codexes</b> is {{regularly}} updated with new editions of armies and occasionally new army <b>codexes.</b> However, all <b>codexes</b> prior editions of Warhammer 40,000 are still valid {{in the current}} edition, unless a later version has replaced it. N.B. Upon the launch of 8th Edition, all <b>codexes</b> 7th Edition and prior were invalidated due to a rules overhaul and therefore incompatibility. On launch they were replaced with Indexes to provide compatible rules.|$|R
5000|$|The two event <b>codexes</b> were {{released}} {{in association with}} the 2000 and 2003 Worldwide Campaigns. These <b>codexes</b> provided background and special gaming rules for the event, along with four [...] "supplemental army lists"; variant armies that required access to certain other Codices for use.|$|R
5|$|The <b>codex</b> is an Alexandrian text-type {{manuscript}} {{written in}} the 4th century in uncial letters on parchment. Scholarship considers the <b>Codex</b> Sinaiticus {{to be one of}} the best Greek texts of the New Testament, along with the <b>Codex</b> Vaticanus. Until the discovery by Constantin von Tischendorf of the Sinaiticus text, the <b>Codex</b> Vaticanus was unrivaled.|$|E
5|$|Abbreviations {{are rarely}} {{used in the}} <b>codex.</b> The {{handwriting}} {{is very close to}} that of the Rossano Gospels. The errors of itacism occur, but not so often as in <b>Codex</b> Sinaiticus and <b>Codex</b> Vaticanus. It uses grammatical forms typical of the ancient manuscripts (e.g. ειπαν, ηλθαν, ευραν), which are not used in later medieval manuscripts.|$|E
5|$|B. H. Streeter remarked a great {{agreement}} between the <b>codex</b> and Vulgate of Jerome. According to him, Origen brought to Caesarea the Alexandrian text-type {{that was used in}} this <b>codex,</b> and used by Jerome.|$|E
50|$|Polerio wrote {{a number}} of <b>codexes</b> in which a lively {{international}} chess is described (exchanges of ideas among Italy, Portugal, and Spain).

5|$|<b>Codex</b> Boreelianus, <b>Codex</b> Boreelianus Rheno-Trajectinus (full name), {{designated}} by Fe or 09 in the Gregory-Aland numbering and ε 86 in von Soden numbering, is a 9th (or 10th) century uncial manuscript {{of the four}} Gospels in Greek. The manuscript, written on parchment, is full of lacunae (or gaps), many of which arose between 1751 and 1830. The <b>codex</b> was named Boreelianus after Johannes Boreel (1577–1629), who brought it from the East.|$|E

5|$|English Mayanist J. Eric S. Thompson cast strong doubts {{upon the}} {{authenticity}} of the Grolier <b>Codex</b> in his 1975 article The Grolier <b>Codex,</b> published in volume 27 of the Contributions of the University of California. Thompson argued that the <b>codex</b> was a modern forgery and that the unusual mix of styles in the document was not due to the mixing of cultures but rather due to the hand of a forger. Thompson queried the illustration of all four stations of Venus in the <b>codex,</b> noting that other Mesoamerican codices only illustrated the more spectacular appearance of Venus as morning star. This claim has been refuted more recently, with evidence presented from the <b>Codex</b> Telleriano-Remensis that the god of the morning star also presided over the evening star. The contents of the document have not been copied directly from any of the generally accepted Maya codices, although they do resemble pages 46 to 50 of the Dresden <b>Codex.</b>|$|E
5000|$|It is one {{of fifty}} {{examples}} of Techialoyan <b>codexes</b> that exist.

5|$|In John 1:1–8:38 <b>Codex</b> Sinaiticus {{differs from}} Vaticanus {{and all other}} Alexandrian manuscripts. It is in closer {{agreement}} with <b>Codex</b> Bezae {{in support of the}} Western text-type. For example, in John 1:4 Sinaiticus and <b>Codex</b> Bezae are the only Greek manuscripts with textual variant ἐν αὐτῷ ζωὴ ἐστίν (in him is life) instead of ἐν αὐτῷ ζωὴ ᾓν (in him was life). This variant is supported by Vetus Latina and some Sahidic manuscripts. This portion has a large number of corrections.|$|E

5|$|It was {{the first}} {{manuscript}} of great importance and antiquity of which any extensive use was made by textual critics, but {{the value of the}} <b>codex</b> was differently appreciated by different writers in the past. Wettstein created a modern system of catalogization of the New Testament manuscripts. <b>Codex</b> Alexandrinus received symbol A and opened the list of the NT uncial manuscripts. Wettstein announced in his Prolegomena ad Novi Testamenti Graeci (1730) that <b>Codex</b> A is the oldest and the best manuscript of New Testament, and should be the basis in every reconstruction of the New Testament text. <b>Codex</b> Alexandrinus became a basis for criticizing the Textus Receptus (Wettstein, Woide, Griesbach).|$|E
5|$|Kirsopp Lake {{compared}} {{the text of}} the <b>codex</b> with the text of Stephanus and showed that in the sections comprising Matthew 1-10; Matthew 22–Mark 14; Luke 4-23; John 1-13 and 18, in this <b>codex</b> there are 2243 variants from the Textus Receptus.|$|E
