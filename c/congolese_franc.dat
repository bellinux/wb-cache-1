5|$|Soon {{after the}} arrival of the Belgian {{government}} in exile in London, negotiations began between the Belgians and the British about the role which the Congo would play in the Allied war effort. The British were determined that the Congo should not fall into Axis hands, and planned to invade and occupy the colony if the Belgians did not come to an arrangement. This was particularly because, after the fall of Dutch and British colonies in the Far East to Japan, the Allies were desperate for raw materials like rubber which the Congo could produce in abundance. Eventually, the two parties came to an arrangement in which all the British demands were accepted, including a 30 percent devaluation of the <b>Congolese</b> <b>franc.</b>|$|E

50|$|The franc was the {{currency}} of Katanga between 1960 and 1963 during the Congolese province's brief independence. It replaced the <b>Congolese</b> <b>franc</b> at par and was consequently initially equal to the Belgian franc. This established an exchange rate of 50 francs = 1 U.S. dollar. Just before Katanga was re-annexed by Congo, the exchange rate had fallen to 195 francs = 1 U.S. dollar. The currency was replaced at par by the <b>Congolese</b> <b>franc.</b>|$|E

25|$|On April 12 a {{military}} court in Songo Mboyo, Equateur Province sentenced seven former MLC militia members {{to life in}} prison for crimes against humanity, including the December 2003 mass rape of more than 119 women. This ruling was the first judicial action against military personnel accused of crimes against humanity. The judge also found the transitional government responsible for the acts of the MLC soldiers. He ordered it to pay $10,000 (5.3 million <b>Congolese</b> <b>francs)</b> to the family of each woman who {{died as a result of}} the sexual assaults, $5,000 (2.65 million <b>Congolese</b> <b>francs)</b> to each survivor of sexual assault, and $3,000 (1.59 million <b>Congolese</b> <b>francs)</b> to each business owner whose shop was looted.

50|$|As a renown {{economist}} on secondment {{from the}} World Bank, Dr. Tshiani co-chaired in 1997 the Monetary Reform Commission that designed and launched the <b>Congolese</b> <b>Franc,</b> replacing the much discredited currency {{of what had}} been Zaire. He further advised the President on strengthening the autonomy of the monetary authority, notably by dismantling the central bank board that included seven cabinet members and replacing them with independent technical experts. He is an advocate for independent central banks and believes that a well-functioning financial system is a prerequisite to ensure adequate resource allocation and support economic development. He regularly visits his country and monitors closely its economic, social and political developments and challenges.|$|E
50|$|In 1915 and 1916 in {{the period}} of {{fighting}} in East Africa during World War I a large series of emergency issues of paper money were issued. 1916 also saw a final issue of coins to pay German led troops, including 15 Rupien coins which contained an equivalent amount of gold from the Sekenke Gold Mine to equal 15 German Marks. Later in 1916 German East Africa was occupied by British and Belgian forces. In Tanganyika, the Rupie circulated alongside the East African rupee (to which it was equal) until 1920, when both were replaced by the East African florin at par. In Burundi and Rwanda, the Belgian <b>Congolese</b> <b>franc</b> replaced the Rupie in 1916.|$|E

Growth was negative in 2000 because of the difficulty of meeting the conditions of international donors, continued low prices of key exports, and post-coup instability.Although depreciated, <b>congolese</b> <b>francs</b> have been stable for few years (Ndonda, 2014) ...|$|R
25|$|On June 8, {{authorities}} in Tshikapa, Western Kasai Province arrested Pierre-Sosthene Kambidi, a journalist for radio station Concorde FM, after he allegedly defamed a police commander during a June 7 broadcast by {{accusing him of}} committing police brutality. On June 10, a court convicted Kambidi of defamation and sentenced him to three months in jail. Pending appeal of his conviction, the court released Kambidi on June 14 after he posted $50 (26,500 <b>Congolese</b> <b>francs)</b> bail. Community radio stations throughout the country stopped broadcasting on June 17 to protest the conviction and other press freedom cases. No further information was available at year's end.|$|R
5000|$|The Zaire (French: Zaïre), symbol: [...] "Z", or {{sometimes}} [...] "Ƶ", {{was introduced in}} 1967, replacing the <b>Congolese</b> <b>franc</b> at an exchange rate of 1 zaire = 1000 francs. The zaire was subdivided into 100 makuta (singular: likuta, symbol: [...] "K"), each of 100 sengi (symbol: [...] "s"). However, the sengi was worth very little and the only sengi denominated coin was the 10 sengi coin issued in 1967. Unusually for any currency, it was common practice to write cash amounts with three zeros after the decimal place, even after inflation had greatly devalued the currency. Inflation eventually caused denominations of banknotes up to 5,000,000 zaires to be issued, after which the new zaire was introduced.|$|E

50|$|Education Minister John Mwanakatwe and Alex Shapi visited Mweru constituency. They {{were held}} at gunpoint and manhandled by the Congolese (Katangese) gendarmes after {{crossing}} the Lunchinda River at Chipungu. Despite explaining who they were, they were accused of being in Congolese territory. It {{was not until the}} following day that a senior Congolese official who spoke Chibemba saved them and apologised for their mistreatment. They crossed the Lunchinda in the knowledge that they were still in Zambian territory, as the maps showed. At this time, there was no clinic at Chipungu, so many Zambians sought medical facilities from the Congolese hospital at Mpweto. Even the Belgium <b>Congolese</b> <b>franc</b> was accepted currency in Chipungu area itself, as it was in Pweto. The fact was, Mwanakatwe was legitimately visiting his constituency, as far as the Zambian map showed.|$|E
50|$|Employers {{often did}} not respect {{the minimum wage}} law of $1.00 per day. The average monthly wage did not provide a decent {{standard}} of living for a worker and family in the formal economy. Government salaries remained low, ranging from $50 to $110 (26,500 to 58,300 <b>Congolese</b> <b>francs)</b> per month, and salary arrears were common throughout the public sector. More than 90 percent of laborers worked in subsistence agriculture or informal commerce. Many relied on extended family for support.

25|$|A {{large and}} active private press functioned {{throughout}} the country, {{and a large}} number of daily newspapers were licensed to publish. The transitional government required every newspaper to pay a $500 (265,000 <b>Congolese</b> <b>francs)</b> license fee and complete several administrative requirements before publishing. Many journalists lacked professional training, received little if any salary, and were vulnerable to manipulation by wealthy individuals, government officials, and politicians who provided cash or other benefits to encourage certain types of articles. While many newspapers remained critical of the transitional government, many showed bias toward it or particular political parties. Although there was no official newspaper, the government press agency published the Daily Bulletin, which included news reports, decrees, and official statements.|$|R
25|$|On May 30, the Court of State Security found Patrice Booto, {{the editor}} of Le Journal arrested in November 2005, guilty of {{insulting}} {{the head of state}} and sentenced him to six months in prison and a $500 (265,000 <b>Congolese</b> <b>francs)</b> fine. The charge stemmed from an article that Booto published claiming—without evidence—that the president gave $30 million to Tanzania for its education budget while the transitional government remained in a payment dispute with teachers. On July 27, after Booto paid the fine and spent nine months in jail, an appeals court found him guilty of reporting false information but acquitted him of insulting the head of state, resulting in his release on August 3.|$|R

50|$|The law prohibits {{marriage}} of girls under age 15 and boys under 18; however, marriages of girls younger than 15 sometimes took place, some involving girls under 13. Dowry payments greatly contributed to underage marriage. In some cases parents married off a daughter {{against her will}} to collect a dowry or to finance a dowry for a son to give to his future wife. The newly enacted sexual violence law criminalizes forced marriage. It subjects parents to up to 12 years' hard labor and a fine of $185 (98,050 <b>Congolese</b> <b>francs)</b> for forcing children to marry. The penalty doubles when the victim is a minor. There were no reports of convictions for forced marriage by year's end.|$|R
5000|$|After World War I, Belgian {{businessmen}} came {{to visit}} the present Democratic Republic of the Congo to evaluate the opportunities {{to invest in the}} country. It was understood that the government was interested in producing beer for the local population as the beer produced by the inhabitants themselves caused major health problems. A brewery, which could brew a high quality beer, would be a good substitute for the current situation. The investors decided to set up a brewery {{with the support of the}} “Société Congolaise de Banque”. On 23 October 1923 the “Brasserie de Léopoldville” (as Kinshasa was then known) was established for 4.000.000 <b>Congolese</b> <b>francs.</b> The first beer was produced on 27 December 1926.|$|R
5000|$|On July 13, 2006, {{controversy}} ensued when {{a journalist}} for Kinshasa-based Congo FM, Olivier Komfie Mabwava, was summoned by a Bandundu judge, then promptly arrested with a warrant issued by state prosecutor Kapuba Tshokoyokoyo, for having [...] "deeply offended" [...] Governor Gifuza with remarks {{made by the}} president of the provincial union of doctors in a July 6 interview, accusing the provincial governor of [...] "blocking the salaries of health personnel" [...] and inviting [...] "his colleagues to stage a sit-in outside the governor's office." [...] The arrest was protested by Journalist in Danger (Reporters Without Borders' Congolese affiliate), and Mabwava was released 48 hours later [...] "after paying a compromise fine of 10,000 <b>Congolese</b> <b>francs</b> (23 USD), which resulted in the withdrawal of charges against him".|$|R
5000|$|In {{addition}} to the problems caused by the ongoing conflict, there are other serious threats to women's physical well-being in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Female genital mutilation (FGM), while not widespread, exists among some populations in northern parts of the country; the prevalence of FGM is estimated at about 5% {{of women in the}} country. FGM is now illegal: the law imposes a penalty of two to five years of prison and a fine of 200,000 <b>Congolese</b> <b>francs</b> on any person who violates the [...] "physical or functional integrity" [...] of the genital organs. [...] Maternal mortality rates are high, as access to maternal healthcare is limited. Additionally, a woman can only use contraceptives with the permission of her husband, rendering her unable to prevent herself from contracting AIDS from him.|$|R
5000|$|The mass looting {{died down}} as stocks of {{minerals}} were depleted, and soldiers were encouraged by their commanders {{to take part}} in small-scale looting, which started an [...] "active extraction phase". Natural resources that were not stolen were often purchased with counterfeit <b>Congolese</b> <b>francs,</b> which contributed to inflation. Air transportation companies that once operated in the Congo disappeared and were replaced by companies affiliated with foreign armies. The Congolese government lost tax revenue from natural resources entering or leaving its air fields; air services were controlled by Rwandan and Ugandan troops, who routinely exported coltan from the Congo. The increase in air transportation networks also increased exploitation because of the new transport routes.Coltan is the most profitable mineral export from the Congo, but it is particularly difficult to track because it is often listed as cassiterite, for which export taxes are lower. Coltan had been illegally extracted and sold via Burundi since 1995, three years before the invasion began. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) stated that Burundi has no [...] "gold, diamonds, columbotantalite, copper, cobalt or basic metals" [...] mining operations, but has nonetheless been exporting them since 1998.Likewise, Rwanda and Uganda had no known production sites for many of the minerals they exported at vastly increased rates after they invaded the DRC. [...] "Free zone areas" [...] make diamonds difficult to track because they can be repackaged and [...] "legally" [...] sold as diamonds from that country.The DRC exported few minerals after the invasion because its rural infrastructure was destroyed; mining and agricultural outputs waned. yet the air transportation networks' new transport routes increased exploitation by the invaders.|$|R
