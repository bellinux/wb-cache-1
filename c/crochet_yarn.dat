50|$|In 1897, {{fourteen}} companies {{involved in}} the spinning of sewing cotton combined to form the 'English Sewing Cotton Company Limited' (ESCC)http://www.spinningtheweb.org.uk/web/objects/common/webmedia.php?irn=257. In all cases, the Directors or Proprietors {{of each of the}} individual companies became Directors of ESCC. While some of the individual companies had previously only been involved with the manufacture of sewing cotton, Bagley & Wright had many other interests including yarn for weaving, fishing-net twine, <b>crochet</b> <b>yarn</b> etc. The Bagley & Wright business split into two; one part being subsumed into ESCC with Benjamin and Ralph as Directors, the other part staying independent. In effect, the ESCC was a 'holding company' and each of the fourteen companies within it maintained their own name and style of management.|$|E
5000|$|Doubling of yarn {{where two}} or more stands or ends of yarn are twisted together. There are many {{purposes}} where doubled yarn is used. Sometimes thread is doubled to make warp, and it is invariably used for the manufacture of knitting yarn, <b>crochet</b> <b>yarn</b> and sewing yarn. All these yarns must be smooth and free from knots. In a sewing thread, the treads are doubled in two phases. Two or three strands are twisted together then three of theses threads are twisted together, to form a six or nine cord.The spun yarn is wound onto a bobbin using a doubling winding machine, and {{two or more}} of these bobbins are placed on doubling frame (doubling winding machine). The ends pass through a series of rollers and twisted together onto one bobbin using a spindle and flyer. The process here is similar to that found in one of Arkwrights Water frames, though the size of the ring, spindle and traveller are predictably larger. Alternatively a 'twiner' is used: this is a modified spinning mule and is mainly consigned to the doubling of warp thread High quality doubling depended on keeping the tension correct and feeding the produced thread evenly and tightly on a bobbin or flangeless paper tubes ...|$|E
50|$|Yarn bombing, yarnbombing, yarn storming, guerrilla {{knitting}}, kniffiti, urban knitting or graffiti knitting {{is a type}} of graffiti or street {{art that}} employs colourful displays of knitted or <b>crocheted</b> <b>yarn</b> or fibre rather than paint or chalk.|$|R
5000|$|In 2008, Norville began {{performing}} in infomercials. In addition to commercials for anti-aging cream and lotions, she launched the Deborah Norville Collection of knit and <b>crochet</b> <b>yarns</b> {{in partnership with}} Premier Yarns, a North Carolina-based yarn manufacturer. Norville debuted {{the line at the}} 2009 Craft Hobby Show, the craft industry’s premier convention, where she also served as the Keynote Speaker.

50|$|During the 1940s, the {{rationing}} {{of textiles}} for World War II {{led to the}} manufacturing of handbags made in materials like raffia or <b>crocheted</b> from <b>yarn.</b> Some women <b>crocheted</b> their own small handbags from commercial patterns during this period.|$|R

50|$|The {{division}} between yarn and thread is somewhat arbitrary: crochet thread at its thickest {{is similar in}} diameter and behavior to fine cotton yarn. The largest sizes of thread crochet hooks overlap with the smallest sizes of <b>yarn</b> <b>crochet</b> hooks.|$|R
50|$|In recent times, some tawashs are <b>crocheted</b> from cotton <b>yarn,</b> {{producing}} the eco-friendly tawashi (eko tawashi), which is scratch-free, {{and used for}} dishes and small cleaning jobs. (The prefix eco- (エコ) indicates that it creates less pollution {{because it can be}} used without soap or detergents.|$|R
5000|$|T-shirt yarn is {{the easiest}} and most {{forgiving}} <b>crochet</b> medium. T-shirt <b>yarn</b> {{is also known as}} [...] "tarn" [...] and T-Yarn. It is almost always upcycled from old T shirts. This is because the cotton has been well worn and perfectly soft and still durable, and just slightly stretchy.|$|R
500|$|Olek changed {{materials}} for a joint exhibition with David E. Peterson in New York City; she used thousands of semi-inflated balloons, <b>crocheted</b> like <b>yarn</b> {{to create a}} cave-like structure inside the gallery. The artist noted her love of the ephemeral nature of the medium; the balloons often popped during {{the creation of the}} installation, and required immediate repair to prevent it unraveling entirely. The installation will gradually wither. She said that balloons represent [...] "the happiest moments in life — which are often just as impermanent". Some visitors noted a pungent scent of latex. Olek was inspired by her time as a traveling clown for Health Plus, when she would visit poor New York neighborhoods. She had previously used balloons during her residency in Brazil.|$|R
5000|$|Amigurumi can be knitted, {{though they}} are usually <b>crocheted</b> out of <b>yarn</b> or thread, using the basic {{techniques}} of crochet (such as single crochet stitch (sc), double crochet (db), invisible decrease (inv.dec)). Amigurumi can be worked as one piece or, more usually, in sections which are sewed or crocheted together. In crochet, amigurumi are typically worked in spiral rounds to prevent [...] "striping", a typical feature of joining crochet rounds in a project.|$|R
5000|$|Taylor {{began his}} career as an artist in ceramics. His {{earliest}} series, [...] "Analytical Perspectives" [...] of 1965-66, focused on the vessel format. In the [...] "Libidinous Manifest" [...] series of 1969 Taylor sculpted organic ceramic forms that he placed open-end down on wood pedestals to proclaim their alliance with sculpture. In contradiction to the sensual knobs and bulges of his forms, Taylor painted the sculptures with shiny enamel in eye-popping colors. The addition of hard-edged geometric shapes and stripes painted on the forms further challenged the biomorphic forms while the addition of rayon flocking and in, one case ("Libidinous Manifest #10"),a clinging web of red <b>crocheted</b> <b>yarn</b> placed the works firmly in the era of psychedelic imagery.Also in 1969, Taylor took his first foray into glassblowing. Early works included the [...] "Glass Fabrication" [...] series, in which Taylor combine blown glass forms with grommets, plate glass and automotive products, such as motor oil and anti-freeze. A trip to Scandinavia in 1974 gave Taylor the opportunity to work at the Johansfors Glasbruk in the province of Småland, Sweden where he developed his [...] "Johansfors" [...] series. There he created sculptures by cutting and assembling clear glass forms manufactured by the factory. Upon his return to his Nashville, Tennessee studio Taylor continued his exploration of cut and assembled clear glass forms in his 1975-76 [...] "N-Sequence" [...] series. The artist found that the soda-lime glass that he used to make the forms for this series had impurities in it that caused striations in the glass; these he felt, distracted from the appreciation of the sculptures. In subsequent series of fabricated glass sculptures Taylor created his forms in borosilicate glass, the same substance of which Pyrex laboratory glass is made.|$|R
25|$|The {{earliest}} dated English {{reference to}} garments made of cloth produced by looping yarn with a hook — shepherd's knitting — is in, The Memoirs of a Highland Lady, by Elizabeth Grant (1797–1830). The journal entry, itself, is dated 1812 {{but was not}} recorded in its subsequently published form until some time between 1845 and 1867, and the actual date of publication was first in 1898. Nonetheless, the 1833 volume of Penélopé describes and illustrates a shepherd's hook, and recommends its use for <b>crochet</b> with coarser <b>yarn.</b>|$|R
2500|$|Many major {{metropolitan}} {{cities across the}} US and Europe host annual Yarn Crawls.

[...] Participants of the crawl receive a passport and get their passport stamped at each store they visit along the crawl. [...] Traditionally those that get their passports fully stamped are eligible to win a larger gift basket filled with <b>yarn,</b> knitting and <b>crochet</b> goodies. [...] Some local crawls also provide a Knit-Along (KAL) or Crochet-Along (CAL) where attendees follow a specific pattern prior to the crawl and then proudly wear it during the crawl for others to see.|$|R

2500|$|The early {{instruction}} books make frequent {{reference to}} the alternate use of 'ivory, bone, or wooden hooks' and 'steel needles in a handle', as appropriate to the stitch being made. Taken with the synonymous labeling of shepherd's- and single crochet, and the similar equivalence of French- and double crochet, {{there is a strong}} suggestion that crochet is rooted both in tambour embroidery and shepherd's knitting, leading to thread and <b>yarn</b> <b>crochet</b> respectively; a distinction that is still made. The locus of the fusion of all these elements — the [...] "invention" [...] noted above — has yet to be determined, as does the origin of shepherd's knitting.|$|R
2500|$|Basic {{materials}} {{required for}} crochet are a hook and {{some type of}} material that will be <b>crocheted,</b> most commonly <b>yarn</b> or thread. [...] Yarn, {{one of the most}} commonly used materials for crocheting has varying weights which need to be taken into consideration when following patterns. Additional tools are convenient for keeping stitches counted, measuring crocheted fabric, or making related accessories. Examples include cardboard cutouts, which {{can be used to make}} tassels, fringe, and many other items; a pom-pom circle, used to make pom-poms; a tape measure and a gauge measure, both used for measuring crocheted work and counting stitches; a row counter; and occasionally plastic rings, which are used for special projects.|$|R

50|$|Amigurumi (lit. crocheted or knitted stuffed toy) is the Japanese art of {{knitting}} or <b>crocheting</b> small, stuffed <b>yarn</b> creatures. The word is a portmanteau of the Japanese words ami, meaning crocheted or knitted, and nuigurumi, meaning stuffed doll. In {{the west}} {{they are called}} amigurumi, which are the original phonetics of 編みぐるみ in Japanese language. Amigurumi vary in size {{and there are no}} restrictions about size or look. While the art of amigurumi has been known in Japan for several decades, the craft first started appealing to the masses in other countries, especially in the West, in 2003. By 2006, amigurumi were reported to be {{some of the most popular}} items on Etsy, an online craft marketplace, where they typically sold for $10 to $100. Since then, popularity has continued to increase. Even though amigurumi seem popular online due to their presence on sites such as Etsy, Pinterest and Ravelry, amigurumi is still a developing craft permeated and directly depending on emerging trends and popular culture.|$|R
