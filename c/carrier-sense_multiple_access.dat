40|$|Abstract — Due to the {{difficulty}} of hardware design, the cap-ture effect cannot be realized in the commercial wireless local area networks (WLAN) devices. The status results in a recent emerging pseudo capture effect in high density WLANs (HD WLANs), which is seldom considered before. Existing work has shown that the performance of <b>carrier-sensing</b> <b>multiple</b> <b>access</b> (CSMA) mechanism is severely degraded by this effect in high density WLAN environment. In this paper we present a model to analyze the performance of the effect. Based on the analytical results, a scalable AP-based channel assignment scheme, Lowest Captured Channel (LCC) is proposed, which combats the problem by switching channels of each AP to the channel with the lowest pseudo capture effect. Simulation results illustrate that the proposed scheme increases the system throughput as well as enhances the system fairness compared with the fixed channel assignment. The cost of the scheme is only adding a small overhead for information exchange. I...|$|R

The paper addresses questions that {{do not seem to}} have been studied before in the engineering literature on wireless networks: Under what circumstances is it feasible for a provider, either benevolent or selfish, to operate a network {{in such a way as}} to cover costs? How is the optimal behavior of a benevolent provider different from the optimal behavior of a selfish provider? And, most importantly, how does the medium access control (MAC) technology influence the answers to these questions? To address these questions, we build a general model, and provide analysis and simulations for simplified but typical scenarios; the focus in these scenarios is on the contrast between the outcomes obtained under <b>carrier-sensing</b> <b>multiple</b> <b>access</b> (CSMA) and outcomes obtained under time-division <b>multiple</b> <b>access</b> (TDMA).

40|$|A new {{energy-efficient}} {{scheme for}} data transmission in a {{wireless sensor network}} (WSN) is proposed, having in mind a typical application including a sink, which periodically triggers the WSN, and nodes uniformly distributed over a specified area. Routing, <b>multiple</b> <b>access</b> control (MAC), physical, energy, and propagation aspects are jointly taken into account through simulation; however, the protocol design is based on some analytical considerations reported in the appendix. Information routing {{is based on a}} clustered self-organized structure; a <b>carrier-sensing</b> <b>multiple</b> <b>access</b> (CSMA) protocol is chosen at MAC layer. Two different scenarios are examined, characterized by different channel fading rates. Four versions of our protocol are presented, suitably oriented to the two different scenarios; two of them implement a cross-layer (CL) approach, where MAC parameters influence both the network and physical layers. Performance is measured in terms of network lifetime (related to energy efficiency) and packet loss rate (related to network availability). The paper discusses the rationale behind the selection of MAC protocols for WSNs and provides a complete model characterization spanning from the network layer to the propagation channel. The advantages of the CL approach, with respect to an algorithm which belongs to the well-known class of low-energy adaptive clustering hierarchy (LEACH) protocols, are shown. </p...|$|R

In order to increase useful lifetimes of such battery-powered devices, it is vital to understand the role of <b>carrier-sense</b> based <b>multiple</b> <b>access</b> protocols in controlling the trade-offs between throughput and energy consumption performance. Our focus in this work is the impact of imperfect carrier sensing on this trade-off; accordingly, we present an analysis of the energy efficiency of p-persistent CSMA with carrier sense imperfections.

CAN bus, ALOHAnet, Ethernet, etc., all experience occasional bus contention in normal operation, but use some protocol (such as Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance, <b>carrier-sense</b> <b>multiple</b> <b>access</b> with collision detection, or automatic repeat request) to minimize the times that contention occurs, and to re-send data that was mangled in a packet collision.|$|E
50|$|<b>Carrier-sense</b> <b>multiple</b> <b>access</b> with {{collision}} detection (CSMA/CD) is a {{media access control}} method used most notably in early Ethernet technology for local area networking. It uses a carrier-sensing scheme in which a transmitting station detects collisions by sensing transmissions from other stations while transmitting a frame. When this collision condition is detected, the station stops transmitting that frame, transmits a jam signal, and then waits for a random time interval before trying to resend the frame.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—The {{strength}} of <b>carrier-sense</b> <b>multiple</b> <b>access</b> with collision avoidance (CSMA/CA) {{can be combined}} with that of time-division multiple access (TDMA) to enhance the channel access performance in wireless networks such as the IEEE 802. 15. 4 -based wireless personal area networks (WPANs). In particular, the performance of legacy CSMA/CA-based medium access control (MAC) scheme in congested networks can be enhanced through a hybrid CSMA/CA-TDMA scheme while preserving the scalability property. In this paper, we present distributed and centralized channel access models which follow the transmission strategies based on Markov decision process (MDP) to access both contention period and contention-free period in an intelligent way. The models consider the buffer status {{as an indication of}} congestion provided that the offered traffic does not exceed the channel capacity. We extend the models to consider the hidden node collision problem encountered due to the signal attenuation caused by channel fading. The simulation results show that the MDP-based distributed channel access scheme outperforms the legacy slotted CSMA/CA scheme. This scheme also works efficiently in a network consisting of heterogeneous nodes. The centralized model outperforms the distributed model but requires the global information of the network.

30|$|For {{this type}} of networks, <b>carrier-sense</b> <b>multiple</b> <b>access</b> (CSMA) {{protocols}} are very popular to avoid collisions and improve the network performance. CSMA distinguishes itself with its distributed nature in coordinating the spectrum access. Under CSMA/CA (Carrier sense multiple access with collision avoidance), a transmitter continuously senses the channel state prior to transmitting. If the channel state is idle, the transmitter starts to transmit packets. Otherwise, it waits {{for a while before}} it starts sensing the status. By this way, the network can reduce the interference to achieve a higher probability of successful transmissions and higher network capacity.|$|E
40|$|A multiple-access {{protocol}} for local area networks is described. It {{is basically a}} hybrid of <b>carrier-sense</b> <b>multiple</b> <b>access</b> with collision detection (CSMA/CD) and the broadcast recognizing access method (BRAM). CSMA/CD, which is contention-based, works well under light traffic, but message collisions degrade system performance when the channel becomes heavily loaded. BRAM, which is collision-free, has longer delays at low load, but its efficiency improves as the load increases. Performance models are developed for the hybrid protocol and for the Ethernet protocol, a proven commercial implementation of CSMA/CD-type protocols. It is found that the hybrid protocol gives better performance {{for a wide range}} of scenarios. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E

The two new <b>multiple</b> <b>access</b> systems are Scale-Time-Code Division <b>Multiple</b> <b>Access</b> (STCDMA) and Scale-Code Division <b>Multiple</b> <b>Access</b> (SCDMA).

It was shown that FARA had superior performance when compared with slotted-ALOHA and many other existing contension-based schemes. However, carrier-sensing was not considered in FARA. A fixed assignment retransmission scheme with carrier-sensing capability (FARCS) is developed and analyzed using a Markov model. The performance of FARCS is shown to be superior to <b>carrier-sense</b> <b>multiple</b> <b>access</b> with collision detection (CSMA/CD).

We show via simulations that this multichannel CSMA protocol provides a higher throughput compared to its single channel counterpart by reducing the packet loss due to collisions. We also show that the use of channel reservation provides better performance than multichannel CSMA with purely random idle channel selection. ...|$|E
