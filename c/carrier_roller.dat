40|$|Abstract. The {{purpose of}} this study is to provide a simple method for {{estimating}} the driving resistance of rubber conveyer belts. The driving resistance of a rubber belt running on the <b>carrier</b> <b>roller</b> was estimated by a resistance force acting on a roller moving on the rubber conveyer belt while the belt was fixed on an aluminum channel. Four types of conveyor belts were tested to confirm the present technique is useful for grading rubber conveyer belts from a viewpoint of energy dissipation on the carrier rollers of the conveyer system. The effects of normal force acting on the roller and driving speed of the roller on the resistance force were investigated. Four belts were fabricated with different rubber types of rubber, respectively. It was confirmed from the experiments that the estimated resistance force varied with respect to the rubber characteristics, which was consistent to the experience from the existing belt conveyer systems for energy consumption. The resistance force of the <b>carrier</b> <b>roller</b> increases with an increase of roller speed. It also decreases when a lower damping rubber is used while the belt rigidity does not affect the resistance force when low resistance rubber is used. The proposed method is applicable to estimate the total energy loss of rubber conveyer belts on the carrier rollers...|$|E
40|$|PT Daeyang Rollent Indonesia is {{manufacture}} {{company that}} produce kind of roller conveyor and stand, located in gresik, east java, the problem usually appear and faced by this company are determination of total massage (lot size) of raw {{material that is}} less efficient until the supply of raw material shed become in adequate. This matter also cause process production and cause the company can not reach due date that customer wanted therefore, taking the right capability is done in order reach the efficient and effective hope by company so that can rice profit that is got by company. The purpose {{of this research is}} giving suggestion toward method of taking the dedication of integration between procurement department and production department that?s is known integrated procurement and production in supply chain management. As the result of taking integrated decision being got cost of economical procurement and production that is burdened towards each product <b>carrier</b> <b>roller</b> type CR 400 and CR 450 as being US 72. 79 or 9. 59...|$|E
50|$|The LARC-LX {{was used}} to {{transport}} wheeled and tracked vehicles, including beach preparation equipment and general cargo, from ship-to-shore or to inland transfer points. It was also capable of transporting 40 ft shipping containers, which could be landed from the LARC either by crane, straddle <b>carriers,</b> or <b>rollers.</b> It was the only amphibious vehicle in U.S. Army service capable of landing on a beach through surf. Typically, the LARC-LX was carried as deck cargo on a commercial vessel or heavy lift ship to be transported overseas.|$|R
50|$|Many pouch {{laminators}} {{require the}} use of a carrier. A carrier holds the pouch as it is run through the laminator. This helps prevent the hot glue, some of which leaks from the sides of the pouches during the process, from gumming up the <b>rollers.</b> The <b>carrier</b> prevents the <b>rollers</b> from getting sticky, which helps to prevent the lamination pouch from wrapping around the rollers inside the laminator.|$|R
5000|$|The 660 ST {{structure}} was planned years in advance before Paramount Communications purchased {{the park in}} 1992. [...] However, Paramount took over operations in time to determine the ride's theme {{which was based on}} the Paramount Pictures film Top Gun. They hired John DeCuir Jr., a production designer that worked on the film, to design the ride's loading platform, so that it would resemble the deck of an aircraft <b>carrier.</b> Subsequently, the <b>roller</b> coaster was named Top Gun when it opened in 1993. The ride's queue, where guests wait in line, featured music from the motion picture as well. An aircraft carrier control room exhibit was also a feature that guests would pass through {{on their way to the}} loading platform above. Access to the control room exhibit was blocked off from the line queue several years later, some time before Cedar Fair purchased the park in 2006.|$|R
50|$|The G3A3 (A4) is a selective-fire {{automatic}} weapon that employs a roller-delayed blowback operating system. The two-piece bolt assembly {{consists of a}} breech (bolt head) and bolt carrier. The bolt is held in battery by two sliding cylindrical rollers that engage locking recesses in the barrel extension. The breech is opened when both rollers are compressed inward against camming surfaces driven by the rearward pressure of the expanding gases upon the bolt head. As the rollers move inward, recoil energy is transferred to the locking piece and bolt carrier which begin to withdraw while the bolt head slowly moves rearward {{in relation to the}} bolt carrier. As the bolt <b>carrier</b> clears the <b>rollers,</b> pressure in the bore drops to a safe level, the bolt head is caught by the bolt carrier and moves to the rear as one unit, continuing the operating cycle. The bolt also features an anti-bounce mechanism that prevents the bolt from bouncing off the barrel's breech surface. The spring-powered claw extractor is also contained inside the bolt while the lever ejector is located inside the trigger housing (actuated by the recoiling bolt).|$|R
