5|$|All {{but one of}} the ten gliders {{carrying}} the airborne troops assigned to Group Iron were able to land next to their objective, the bridge at Kanne. Due to a navigation error by the pilots of the transport aircraft towing the gliders, one of the gliders was dropped in the wrong area. The other nine gliders were towed through heavy anti-aircraft fire and released at 05:35. As the gliders began to descend towards their objective, the bridge was destroyed by several demolition explosions set off by the Belgian garrison. Unlike the garrisons of the other two bridges, the Belgian defenders at Kanne had been forewarned, as the German mechanized <b>column</b> <b>heading</b> for the bridge to reinforce Group Iron arrived twenty minutes ahead of schedule. Its appearance ruined any chance of a surprise assault and gave the defenders sufficient time to destroy the bridge. As the gliders came in to land, one was hit by anti-aircraft fire and crashed into the ground killing most of the occupants. The remaining eight landed successfully, and the airborne troops stormed the Belgian positions and eliminated the defenders.|$|E

25|$|On 29 May {{the fledgling}} Israeli Air Force officially formed 101 Squadron, its first fighter squadron. Modi Alon was given {{command of the}} squadron, {{although}} Lou Lenart, a World War II veteran of fighting in the Pacific, was to command it in the air. The squadron had received its first Avia {{on the night of}} 20–21 May 1948, and by 29 May, four aircraft had been secretly assembled in a hangar at Ekron. The IAF had intended to reveal the Israeli acquisition of fighter aircraft with an attack on the Egyptian air base at El Arish, but the desperate situation on the southern front, with an Egyptian <b>column</b> <b>heading</b> towards Tel Aviv, prompted a change of plans. Without their engines having been run before or their guns fired, Lenart, Alon, Ezer Weizman and Eddie Cohen took off late in the afternoon to attack Egyptian forces near Isdud, only about 10 miles away. Each dropped two bombs and strafed the enemy column. The aircraft inflicted only slight damage, losing one Avia S-199 and pilot (Cohen) to ground fire. Alon's aircraft was also damaged upon landing, but the sortie nevertheless bought Israeli forces enough time to halt the Egyptian advance.|$|E

50|$|Morton's list {{of names}} was {{unnumbered}} and untitled in all editions, although their order changed with successive editions. In his original 1669 edition, the columns were placed on two successive pages (15-16) forming six short columns, three columns of seven names each (headed Carver, Samuel Fuller, and Edward Tilley) {{on the first page}} and three columns of seven, seven, and six names each (headed Turner, Priest, and Clarke) on the next page. In the second (1721) and third (1772) editions, the six short columns were joined into three long columns of 14, 14, and 13 names each on a single page (20). The first and fourth short columns were joined into the first long <b>column</b> (<b>headed</b> Carver with Turner halfway down), the second and fifth short columns were joined into the second long <b>column</b> (<b>headed</b> Samuel Fuller with Priest halfway down), and the third and sixth short columns were joined into the third long <b>column</b> (<b>headed</b> Edward Tilley with Clarke halfway down), changing their order. In the fifth (1826) and sixth (1855) editions, the names were also in three long columns of 14, 14, and 13 names each on one page (1826: 38, 1855: 26), but now they were placed in their original 1669 order. The first and second short columns formed the first long <b>column</b> (<b>headed</b> Carver with Samuel Fuller halfway down), the third and fourth short columns formed the second long <b>column</b> (<b>headed</b> Edward Tilley with Turner halfway down), and the fifth and sixth short columns formed the third long <b>column</b> (<b>headed</b> Priest with Clarke halfway down).

2500|$|Götzen rallied 13,500 {{troops at}} Rottweil aiming at {{relieving}} Breisach {{in conjunction with}} Charles of Lorraine whose 5,000 strong army was evading the numerically superior French in the Franche-Comté. On 26 June 1638, Götzen appeared north of Breisach, {{he chose not to}} attack Bernard directly but instead diverted his troops towards Alsace in the hope of taking the local French garrisons. The French refused to crack, forcing Götzen and to fall back to Offenburg where he was joined by Federico Savelli's 2,500 troops. Götzen's army was loading supplies onto barges at Rheinau, when Bernard drew 11,400 men from the siege lines, moving through Kenzingen and Lahr. It was only on 8 August, that Götzen's scouts reported that he was approaching. Götzen placed his artillery on the Schuttern hill, {{with the rest of the}} army holding a ditch between the hill and Friesenheim. The [...] was but a short skirmish, Bernard quickly disengaged after realizing that the terrain did not favor him. Meanwhile, Savelli was leading two thirds of the army along with a supply <b>column</b> <b>heading</b> towards Wittenweiher, failing to take the necessary precautions he was spotted soon after the column emerged from the Kaiserwald forest. Savelli's [...] was disoriented by a combination of musket and cannon fire and cut down by a cavalry charge that followed immediately. Götzen arrived just early enough to ensure prevent a complete collapse of the army. Still the Battle of Breisach proved disastrous, only 3,000 remained under Bavarian colors by time they retreated to Offenburg, the rest being killed, captured or deserting, 3,000 wagons of food and ammunition were also lost to the enemy. Savelli's court connections protected him from a court martial, while the Bavarian morale fell significantly. Charles of Lorraine and Götzen made two more attempts to relieve Breisach on 15 September and 22 November, failing on both occasions due to a lack of coordination on Charles's part. Breisach fell on 19 December 1638, Götzen was scapegoated by Savelli and arrested.|$|E
