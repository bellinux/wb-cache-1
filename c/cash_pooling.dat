Explaining the rise of shadow banking from this angle paints a very different picture than the supply-side angle that views it as a story of banks'' funding preferences and arbitrage. Institutional <b>cash</b> <b>pools</b> prefer to avoid too much unsecured exposure to banks even through insured deposits. Short-term government guaranteed securities are the next best choice, but their supply is insufficient. The shadow banking system arose to fill this vacuum. One way to manage the size of the shadow banking system is by adopting the supply management of Treasury bills as a macroprudential tool.

40|$|<b>Cash</b> <b>pooling</b> is a {{bank service}} that allows {{corporates}} to externalise the intra-group cash management, and thus manage their global liquidity effectively with lower costs. Although {{there is little}} quantitative information on {{the significance of the}} phenomenon, <b>cash</b> <b>pooling</b> appears to have become increasingly popular after the onset of the financial crisis when, in an environment characterised by limited access to capital markets, reduced bank lending, low returns and higher risks on banks' deposits, corporate groups started to maximise their use of internal sources of financing. In particular, <b>cash</b> <b>pooling</b> is currently very relevant in Western and Northern European countries, and is mainly offered in the United Kingdom, France and the Netherlands. This paper first analyses <b>cash</b> <b>pooling</b> agreements with a focus on the aspects that are relevant from a statistical viewpoint. It then addresses their statistical recording in compliance with ESA 2010 and, specifically, the methodological framework of Monetary Financial Institutions (MFI) balance sheet item statistics. It is proposed that positions related to <b>cash</b> <b>pooling</b> shall be recorded on a gross basis vis- 0 -vis the actual beneficiaries and obligors of the corresponding accounts. However, the proposed treatment goes beyond MFI balance sheet statistics and affects other data domains as well, ranging from financial accounts to balance of payments and international investment positions. While the statistical approach may seem straightforward, applying it in practice is more difficult, not least because of the treatment of <b>cash</b> <b>pooling</b> contracts in accounting terms. The analysis is complemented by numerical examples and also includes data for the Netherlands, which show the importance of clarifying the statistical treatment of <b>cash</b> <b>pooling</b> in light of the large impact it may have on macroeconomic aggregates...|$|E

40|$|The shared {{service centre}} (SSC) {{is a concept}} in which a {{business}} organisation consolidates all its administrative functions and in-house services in one place. The SSC promises to save a bulk of money, and provide better services to the company's internal customers. The savings are further strengthened by pooling cash in a central account to offset debit and credit balances. A <b>cash</b> <b>pooling</b> system can optimise the use of excess cash and interest yield, reduce interest expense and costly intra-company transac-tions,and the like. However, the segmental legal and tax regimes and, further,the lagging behind of bank services formulate the periphery of <b>cash</b> <b>pooling</b> in Europe. The benefits of SSC and cash pool depend on the business environment,especially how the changes {{of the number of}} centres affect the quality of support, and how the scale influences the costs. The European integration is likely to lead to increasing centralisation of internal supporting function. Though it does not affect the expected value of the cash flow, <b>cash</b> <b>pooling</b> will reduce the volatility of the cash flow and improve the liquidity situa-tion of the pooling company.
