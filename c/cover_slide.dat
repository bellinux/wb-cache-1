40|$|A novel <b>cover</b> <b>slide</b> is {{reported}} which increases solar cell output {{by reducing the}} reflection {{of light from the}} <b>cover</b> <b>slide</b> surface and by redirecting incident light so that none falls on the collection grids of the cell. The new <b>cover</b> <b>slide</b> is fabricated with a sawtooth surface having a periodicity equal to that of the solar cell grids. This configuration refracts the light so that it is directed onto the semiconductor surface between the grid lines. Conventional grid patterns obstruct 7 - 10 percent of the light incident on the cell; at least half of this loss has been recovered by using the sawtooth <b>cover</b> <b>slide.</b> In addition, surface reflection from the conventional coated <b>cover</b> <b>slide</b> is suppressed by presenting a second surface to any light reflected at the first plane of contact. This double reflection results in a greater reduction of the reflection loss from the <b>cover</b> <b>slide</b> than does an antireflection coating on a flat surface...|$|E

40|$|A {{possible}} explanation for environmentally-induced discharges on geosynchronous satellites exists in the electric fields formed in the cavities between solar cells - the small gaps formed by the <b>cover</b> <b>slides,</b> solar cells, metallic interconnects and insulating substrate. When exposed to a substorm environment, the <b>cover</b> <b>slides</b> become less negatively charged than the spacecraft ground. Hence, {{it is possible for}} metallic surfaces (usually silver mesh) to be at a negative potential in a cavity that has a 'positive' surface above it. If the resultant electric field becomes large enough, then the interconnect could emit electrons (probably by field emission) which could be accelerated to space by the positive voltage on the covers. An experimental study was connected using a small solar array segment in which the interconnect potential was controlled by a power supply while the <b>cover</b> <b>slides</b> were irridated by monoenergetic electrons. It was found that discharges could be triggered when the interconnect potential became at least 500 volts negative with respect to the <b>cover</b> <b>slides.</b> Analytical modeling of satellites exposed to substorm environments indicates that such gradients are possible. Therefore, it appears that this trigger mechanism for discharges is possible. Details of the experiment and modeling study are presented...|$|R

Reproducibility and accuracy of the device has been tested with standardised microbeads as spiking material. In applying counting techniques with different equations for determining absolute abundances, we discovered major anomalies in the calculated results that we interpreted as being due to the effect of convection currents within the device and the usage of elevated <b>cover</b> <b>slides.</b> A modified formula that corrects for the influence of elevated <b>cover</b> <b>slides</b> in random settling experiments is therefore proposed. Although the settling method is more time-consuming than standard smear-slide techniques, additional information is gained about the spatial and temporal distribution of coccoliths.

40|$|The {{motion of}} {{submerged}} magnetic microspheres rolling at a glass-water interface {{has been studied}} using magnetic rotation and optical tweezers combined with bright-field microscopy particle tracking techniques. Individual microspheres of varying surface roughness were magnetically rotated {{both in and out}} of an optical trap to induce rolling, along either plain glass <b>cover</b> <b>slides</b> or glass <b>cover</b> <b>slides</b> functionalized with polyethylene glycol. It has been observed that the manipulated microspheres exhibited nonlinear dynamic rolling-while-slipping motion characterized by two motional regimes: At low rotational frequencies, the speed of microspheres free-rolling along the surface increased proportionately with magnetic rotation rate; however, a further increase in the rotation frequency beyond a certain threshold revealed a sharp transition to a motion in which the microspheres slipped with respect to the external magnetic field resulting in decreased rolling speeds. The effects of surface-microsphere interactions on the position of this threshold frequency are posed and investigated. Similar experiments with microspheres rolling while slipping in an optical trap showed congruent results. Comment: submitted to Journal of Applied Physics, 11 figure...|$|R

30|$|To {{rule out}} the {{possibility}} of non-specific activation of T cells induced by antibody labeling in T cell immunostaining, first of all, we chose 2  % formalin/PBS solution to fix T cells. In the first color labeling, CD 25 molecules were labeled with biotinylated anti-human CD 25 antibody and then with streptavidin-conjugated QD 605. In the second color labeling, CD 4 (or CD 8) were labeled with rabbit anti-human CD 4 (or CD 8) and then with anti-rabbit IgG (H + L)-conjugated QD 655. Finally, the cells were further fixed through using 2  % formalin/PBS solution. Meanwhile, to remove any unbound antibody or QDs in above each labeling step, the cells were washed twice through employing FBS/PBS, in which the size of Ab or streptavidin-conjugated QD was about 25  nm, and the size of CD 4 or CD 8 or CD 25 was about 1 – 5  nm, respectively.

40|$|In this {{research}} we are creating novel materials by decorating samples locally with functional molecules. The used functional molecules are {{different types of}} fluorophores. Fluorophores are used to functionalize SiO features designed as calibration structures for superresolution blink-microscopy with a method called MACE-ID: molecular assembly controlled by electron-beam induced deposition. The role of the height in deposited features has been determined by investigating interference effects on small deposits. In order to establish the best experimental setting for superresolution imaging the relevant parameters concerning sample handling have been investigated including surface activation, {{the role of the}} substrate and the means of storage. The role of reducing and oxidizing molecules in the imaging buffer is investigated in EPI. For the fluorescent ATTO 655 label the best signal-to-noise ratio has been achieved in the absence of oxygen using an oxygen scavenging system. The best blinking parameters for the ATTO 655 label in total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) mode are established using DNA immobilization on a <b>cover</b> <b>slide.</b> Imaging in TIRF mode of nanostructures deposited on a diamond-like carbon (DLC) coated <b>cover</b> <b>slide</b> is achieved resulting in the best achieved signal-to-noise ratio. This signal-to-noise ratio is high enough in order to detect single emitting molecules. However, all imaged nanostructures are too highly labeled, preventing the temporal separation of fluorophores. To pave the way for sub-diffraction limited imaging of nanostructures, appropriate labeling densities can easily be achieved by optimizing the incubation time and concentration of the dye solution or applying non-fluorescent labels. This reproducible method generating samples with high signal-to-noise ratios gives exciting new possiblities for the creation of robust calibration devices for superresolution microscopy. ...|$|E

The device for biofilm formation was a 24 -well-plate with a <b>cover</b> glass <b>slide</b> in each well. Two assays were used to test the efficacy of the LEO against SRB biofilm formation. For the two assays, LEO at MIC, sub-MIC and supra-MIC concentrations was added as follows: (assay 1) LEO added {{at the same time that}} the SRB cells were introduced in the biofilm device; and (assay 2) planktonic SRB cells were incubated with LEO for 24 h and then these pretreated cells were introduced in the biofilm system. A control without LEO was performed in both assays.
