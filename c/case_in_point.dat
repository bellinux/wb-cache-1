5|$|Where {{medicinal}} plants are harvested {{from the wild}} rather than cultivated, {{they are subject to}} both general and specific threats. General threats include climate change and habitat loss to development and agriculture. A specific threat is over-collection to meet rising demand for medicines. A <b>case</b> <b>in</b> <b>point</b> was the pressure on wild populations of the Pacific yew soon after news of taxol's effectiveness became public. The threats could be addressed by cultivation of some {{medicinal plants}}, or by a system of certification to make wild harvesting sustainable.|$|E
5|$|Attribution {{is often}} {{difficult}} with Farsari's photographs because 19th-century photographers frequently acquired each others' images and sold them under their own names. This {{may be due to}} the commonplace exchange of stock and negatives between various commercial photographers, or due to the number of freelance amateurs who sold their work to more than one studio. Thus a photograph identified as by Farsari might actually be by Beato, Stillfried & Andersen or Kusakabe. A <b>case</b> <b>in</b> <b>point</b> is the photograph of an Officer's Daughter, variously attributed to Farsari, Stillfried, Kusakabe or even Suzuki Shin'ichi.|$|E
5|$|Despite its size, {{the common}} {{thresher}} is minimally dangerous to humans {{due to its}} relatively small teeth and timid disposition. It is highly valued by commercial fishers for its meat, fins, hide, and liver oil; large numbers are taken by longline and gillnet fisheries throughout its range. This shark is also esteemed by recreational anglers for the exceptional fight it offers on hook-and-line. The common thresher has a low rate of reproduction and cannot withstand heavy fishing pressure for long, a <b>case</b> <b>in</b> <b>point</b> being the rapid collapse of the thresher shark fishery off California in the 1980s. With commercial exploitation increasing {{in many parts of}} the world, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed this species as Vulnerable.|$|E
50|$|Doukas has {{a section}} of athletics. Many notable Greek athletes have {{transferred}} <b>in</b> Doukas. <b>Cases</b> <b>in</b> <b>point</b> are Niki Bakogianni, Angeliki Tsiolakoudi and Stella Tsikouna.|$|R

50|$|There {{are several}} {{examples}} of classical fields. Classical field theories remain useful wherever quantum properties do not arise, {{and can be}} active areas of research. Elasticity of materials, fluid dynamics and Maxwell's equations are <b>cases</b> <b>in</b> <b>point.</b>|$|R
5|$|Sinclair {{licensed}} the Spectrum {{design to}} Timex Corporation in the United States. An enhanced version with better sound, graphics and other modifications was marketed in the USA by Timex as the Timex Sinclair 2068. Timex's derivatives were largely incompatible with Sinclair systems. Some of the Timex innovations were later adopted by Sinclair Research. A <b>case</b> <b>in</b> <b>point</b> was the abortive Pandora portable Spectrum, whose ULA had the high resolution video mode pioneered in the TS2068. Pandora had a flat-screen monitor and Microdrives and {{was intended to}} be Sinclair's business portable. After Amstrad bought the computer business of Sinclair Research, Sir Clive retained the rights to the Pandora project, and it evolved into the Cambridge Computer Z88, launched in 1987.|$|E
5|$|Capcom {{discovered}} a few business principles through {{their experience with}} development and release of the five. The first was to focus on multi-platform releases. Second, Capcom needed to streamline development. Prior to the five, the company had announced expected losses of US$103 million for fiscal year 2002, largely due to poor sales and extended development times, and ultimately posted over US$163 million in losses. Resident Evil 4 was a <b>case</b> <b>in</b> <b>point,</b> beginning development in 1999 and going through four discarded versions {{by the time of}} its 2005 release. The third lesson was to focus on old franchises rather than create new ones; Resident Evil 4 was the only unmitigated commercial success of the five and also the only game based on an existing property. To wit, Viewtiful Joe 2 started development shortly after the release of Viewtiful Joe and was completed just a year later. However, the brisk schedule meant that the team was not given time to implement all the features they had wanted, including a cooperative gameplay mode. Viewtiful Joe 2 debuted on both GameCube and PlayStation 2 to reach a wider audience and maximize profitability.|$|E
25|$|A <b>case</b> <b>in</b> <b>point</b> was Ikeda's {{conversion}} {{through his}} meeting with Toda. Ikeda was seemingly inspired by the authenticity and clarity of Toda's message, his capacity to employ language and logic to inspire people, and his vision of global citizenship.|$|E
5000|$|Since Japanese bilingual dictionaries, {{which are}} {{available}} for most major world languages, are too numerous to be discussed here, the two <b>cases</b> <b>in</b> <b>point</b> are Ei-Wa jiten (英和辞典) [...] "English-Japanese dictionaries" [...] and Wa-Ei jiten (和英辞典) [...] "Japanese-English dictionaries".|$|R
40|$|Excerpt] There is {{one thing}} professors and {{professionals}} in industrial relations can be absolutely certain of: concepts and techniques recycle. Profit sharing and gainsharing are <b>cases</b> <b>in</b> <b>point.</b> Both possess long histories and the arguments advanced by advocates and skeptics also have a historic ring...|$|R
50|$|Pedro Bordaberry's {{career is}} {{one of a number of}} {{examples}} in Latin American politics of the son of a President of authoritarian tendencies making his mark subsequently while upholding constitutional legitimacy. The careers of Omar Torrijos and Martín Torrijos of Panama are comparable <b>cases</b> <b>in</b> <b>point.</b>|$|R
25|$|Along {{with the}} Stockholm Metro, Montreal pioneered the {{installation}} of public art in the Metro among capitalist countries, a practice that beforehand was mostly found in socialist and communist nations (the Moscow Metro being a <b>case</b> <b>in</b> <b>point).</b> More than fifty stations are decorated with over one hundred works of public art, such as sculpture, stained glass, and murals by noted Quebec artists, including members of the famous art movement, the Automatistes.|$|E
25|$|Linear Programming {{requires}} {{the definition of}} an objective function. The optimal solution to the LP problem {{is considered to be}} the solution which maximizes or minimizes the value of the objective function depending on the <b>case</b> <b>in</b> <b>point.</b> In the case of flux balance analysis, the objective function Z for the LP is often defined as biomass production. Biomass production is simulated by an equation representing a lumped reaction that converts various biomass precursors into one unit of biomass.|$|E
25|$|Blackface {{performances}} are not unusual within the Latino community. A minstrel tradition exists {{throughout most of}} Latin America and Spain, and it has traveled to the United States. As Spanish-speakers from different countries, ethnic, racial, class, and educational blackgrounds settle in the United States, they have to grapple with being re-classified vis-a-vis other American-born and immigrant groups. Blackface performances have, for instance, tried to work through U.S. racial and ethnic classifications in conflict with national identities. A <b>case</b> <b>in</b> <b>point</b> is the representation of Latino and its popular embodiment as a stereotypical Dominican man.|$|E
5000|$|The style {{should not}} be {{confused}} with commercial photography campaigns which highlight a color to draw attention as well as for brand association. <b>Cases</b> <b>in</b> <b>point</b> are Tiffany and Co.'s [...] "blue box" [...] advertising campaign, and The Coca-Cola Company's red and white, originally hand-painted Christmas advertisement campaigns.|$|R
60|$|On another {{occasion}} Dr. B. saw a heavy bonefish hooked. It ran straight off shore, and turning, ran in with such speed {{that it came}} shooting out upon dry land and was easily captured. These two instances are <b>cases</b> <b>in</b> <b>point</b> of the incredible speed and strength of this strange fish.|$|R

25|$|Pitfall traps {{are derived}} from rolled leaves, which evolved several {{independent}} times through convergent evolution. The vascular tissues of Sarracenia is a <b>case</b> <b>in</b> <b>point.</b> The keel along {{the front of the}} trap contains a mixture of leftward- and rightward-facing vascular bundles, as would be predicted from the fusion of the edges of an adaxial (stem-facing) leaf surface. Flypapers also show a simple evolutionary gradient from sticky, non-carnivorous leaves, through passive flypapers to active forms. Molecular data show the Dionaea–Aldrovanda clade is closely related to Drosera, and evolved from active flypaper traps into snap traps.|$|E
25|$|The {{mechanism}} which decides {{which of}} several morphs an individual displays {{is called the}} switch. This switch may be genetic, {{or it may be}} environmental. Taking sex determination as the example, in humans the determination is genetic, by the XY sex-determination system. In Hymenoptera (ants, bees and wasps), sex determination is by haplo-diploidy: the females are all diploid, the males are haploid. However, in some animals an environmental trigger determines the sex: alligators are a famous <b>case</b> <b>in</b> <b>point.</b> In ants the distinction between workers and guards is environmental, by the feeding of the grubs. Polymorphism with an environmental trigger is called polyphenism.|$|E
25|$|How {{permanent}} {{a settlement}} was depended on circumstances. A <b>case</b> <b>in</b> <b>point</b> is Irish immigration to North Hastings County, Canada West, which happened after 1846. Most {{of the immigrants}} were attracted to North Hastings by free land grants beginning in 1856. Three Irish settlements were established in North Hastings: Umfraville, Doyle's Corner, and O'Brien Settlement. The Irish were primarily Roman Catholic. Crop failures in 1867 halted the road program near the Irish settlements, and departing settlers afterward outnumbered new arrivals. By 1870, only the successful settlers, {{most of whom were}} farmers who raised grazing animals, remained.|$|E
40|$|In {{recent years}} {{some of the}} most provocative {{articles}} on economic issues have appeared in Soviet literary rather than economics journals. The articles by Nikolai Shmelev and L. Popkova originally published in >i>Novyi mir>/i> (see >i>Problems of Economics,>/i> February 1988) are <b>cases</b> <b>in</b> <b>point.</b> Our current issue provides some additional illustrations, this time drawn from the journal >i>Znamia. >/i>...|$|R

A greater attention to the territory of instalment, a new conception of the innovation process (represented as a collective and incremental process); a new equilibrium between internal and external labour market are <b>cases</b> <b>in</b> <b>point...</b>|$|R
5000|$|Notes of <b>Cases</b> <b>in</b> <b>points</b> of practice, {{taken in}} the Court of Common Pleas, from M.T. 1732, to H.T. 1756, inclusive. To which is added a {{continuation}} of cases {{to the end of}} the reign of Geo. II. is the title of a collection of nominate reports, by Henry Barnes, of cases decided between approximately 1732 and 1760.|$|R
25|$|Deftly {{traversing}} {{between the}} diverse mediums like painting, video, installation and photography, Rashid Rana {{has emerged as}} one of the leading artist of his generation, making his presence felt globally. His work deals with everyday issues encompassing a wide range of themes from urbanization and popular culture to faith and tradition. He often employs video installations and still photography. A <b>case</b> <b>in</b> <b>point</b> is his series of composite photomontages in which each main image is constructed out of countless smaller photos of diametrically opposite subjects. The viewer confronts a moment of sudden withdrawal after moving closer to the picture when one becomes aware of the several tiny images that constitute the larger one.|$|E
25|$|The Brackenburn near Kilmaurs {{has been}} misnamed as the Garrier by the Ordnance Survey since the 1860s. When burns or rivers join {{it is usually}} the largest that decides the name of the river downstream, unless the name changes completely, such as the Kilmarnock Water forming from the Fenwick and Craufurdland Waters. Occasionally a water course is reduced in volume due to changes upstream, a <b>case</b> <b>in</b> <b>point</b> being the Garrier, which used to drain Buiston Loch near Kilmaurs. This was drained as part of {{agricultural}} improvements and now the Garrier is only seasonal, even though it keeps the name Garrier, even when joined by the Brackenburn and the Lochrig burns that flow all year.|$|E
25|$|He {{continued}} {{experimenting with}} new modes of filming, using different directorial methods and techniques. A <b>case</b> <b>in</b> <b>point</b> is Ten, which was filmed in a moving automobile in which Kiarostami was not present. He gave suggestions to the actors {{about what to}} do, and a camera placed on the dashboard filmed them while they drove around Tehran. The camera was allowed to roll, capturing {{the faces of the}} people involved during their daily routine, using a series of extreme-close shots. Ten was an experiment that used digital cameras to virtually eliminate the director. This new direction towards a digital micro-cinema is defined as a micro-budget filmmaking practice, allied with a digital production basis.|$|E
50|$|<b>Cases</b> <b>in</b> <b>point</b> are {{temporary}} {{select committee}} inquiries into: China’s acquisition of U.S. nuclear weapons information, in 1999; the Iran-Contra affair, in 1987; intelligence agency abuses, in 1975-1976, and the Watergate scandal in 1973-1974. The precedent {{for this kind}} of oversight goes back two centuries: in 1792, a special House committee investigated the defeat of an Army force by confederated Indian tribes.|$|R
40|$|Although {{they would}} yield social benefit, many {{political}} projects are not implemented in democracy. The ongoing debate on reforms {{around the world}} provides prominent examples: the reform of the European labor market or the reduction plans for greenhouse gases are <b>cases</b> <b>in</b> <b>point.</b> We suggest a number of improvements which would make liberal democracy more efficient without altering its founding values...|$|R
5000|$|Trans{{mountain}} railroads are railroads {{that need}} to cross dauntingly high mountain ranges to cross between countries on {{one side to the}} other. The Himalayan Mountains, Andes and the Alps would be <b>cases</b> <b>in</b> <b>point.</b> Because of construction difficulties, some such railways are yet to be built. With globalisation and trade liberalisation, the economic viability of constructing of these railways is improving.|$|R
25|$|The VC and NVA made {{extensive}} use of such international sanctuaries during their conflict, and the complex of trails, way-stations and bases snaking through Laos and Cambodia, the famous Ho Chi Minh Trail, was the logistical lifeline that sustained their forces in the South. Also, the United States funded a revolution in Colombia {{in order to take}} the territory they needed to build the Panama Canal. Another <b>case</b> <b>in</b> <b>point</b> is the Mukti Bahini guerrilleros who fought alongside the Indian Army in the Bangladesh Liberation War in 1971 against Pakistan that resulted {{in the creation of the}} state of Bangladesh. In the post-Vietnam era, the Al Qaeda organization also made effective use of remote territories, such as Afghanistan under the Taliban regime, to plan and execute its operations.|$|E
25|$|Ceylon was a <b>case</b> <b>in</b> <b>point.</b> The Portuguese {{conquered the}} Jaffna kingdom {{in the north}} of the island and kingdom of Kotte in the south. In the process, they caused {{widespread}} destruction, including that of the Koneswaram temple of Trincomalee in 1624 and Ketheeswaram temple, accompanied by an extensive campaign of destruction of 500 Hindu shrines, the Saraswathi Mahal Library, many Buddhist temples and libraries, and forced conversion of Hindus and Buddhists to Roman Catholicism. Phillip II and III of Portugal used forts built from the destroyed temples, including Fort Fredrick in Trincomalee, and others in southern Ceylon such as Colombo and Galle Fort, to fight sea battles with the Dutch, Danish, French, and English. This {{was the beginning of the}} island's loss of sovereignty. Later the Dutch and English succeeded the Portuguese as colonial rulers of the island.|$|E
25|$|A reconstructed martial art {{necessarily}} {{rests on}} historical records, either combat manuals or pictorial representations. Martial arts reconstruction specifically does not claim an unbroken tradition of some historical martial arts. On the contrary, the {{premise is that}} in an unbroken tradition, styles significantly evolve over time. It is not necessary for the tradition to have been interrupted in order to reconstruct an earlier style; a <b>case</b> <b>in</b> <b>point</b> is classical fencing which reconstructs the sport fencing of the 19th century before it evolved into current Olympic fencing, or historical German ringen which over time developed into contemporary styles of folk wrestling. Claims of ancient martial arts which survive unchanged by unbroken tradition (e.g. as suggested by Yehoshua Sofer), do not fall under reconstruction and are by their nature unverifiable, even to the person making the claim.|$|E
30|$|In Chinese, existentials {{not only}} assert the {{existence}} of things, but also that of events. However, it is taken for granted that they are only to express {{the existence of}} things. On the other hand, there are those clause patterns that are formally similar to the existential, but the existents in them are not things but events. The so-called pseudo-existentials (e.g., (3)) are <b>cases</b> <b>in</b> <b>point.</b>|$|R
50|$|In {{many other}} democracies such {{subsidies}} for party activity (in general or just for campaign purposes) {{have been introduced}} decades ago. Public financing for parties and/ or candidates (during election times and beyond) has several permutations and is increasingly common. Germany, Sweden, Israel, Canada, Australia, Austria and Spain are <b>cases</b> <b>in</b> <b>point.</b> More recently among others France, Japan, Mexico, the Netherlands and Poland have followed suit.|$|R
5000|$|According to {{the present}} understanding, there are four {{fundamental}} interactions or forces: gravitation, electromagnetism, the weak interaction, and the strong interaction.
