40|$|The mean linear {{intercept}} (Lm) {{can be used}} {{to estimate}} the surface area for gas exchange in the lung. However, in recent years, it is most commonly used as an index for characterizing the enlargement <b>of</b> <b>airspaces</b> in emphysema and the associated severity of structural destruction in the lung. Specifically, an increase in Lm is thought to result from an increase in airspace sizes. In this paper, we examined how accurately Lm measures the linear dimensions <b>of</b> <b>airspaces</b> from histological sections and a variety of computer-generated test images. To this end, we developed an automated method for measuring linear intercepts from digitized images of tissue sections and calculate Lm as their mean. We examined how the shape <b>of</b> <b>airspaces</b> and the vari-ability of their sizes influence Lm as well as the distribution of linear intercepts. We found that, for a relatively homogeneous enlargement <b>of</b> <b>airspaces,</b> Lm was a reliable index for detecting emphysema. However, in the presence of spatial heterogeneities with a larg...|$|R
40|$|With {{increasing}} {{air traffic}} {{demand in the}} Pan-European airspace {{there is a need}} for optimizing the use <b>of</b> the <b>airspace</b> structure (civilian and military) in a manner that would satisfy the requirements of civil and military users. In the area of Europe with the highest levels of air traffic (Core area) 32 % of the volume <b>of</b> <b>airspace</b> above FL 195 is shared by both civil and military users. Until the introduction of the concept of flexible use <b>of</b> <b>airspace,</b> flexible airspace structures were 24 hours per day unavailable for commercial air transport. Flexible use <b>of</b> <b>airspace</b> concept provides a substantial level <b>of</b> dynamic <b>airspace</b> management by the usage of conditional routes. This paper analyses underutilization <b>of</b> resources, flexible <b>airspace</b> structures in the Pan-European airspace, especially in the south-eastern part of the traffic flows (East South Axis), reducing the efficiency of flight operations, as result of delegating the flexible structures to military users. Based on previous analysis, utilization model for flexible use <b>of</b> <b>airspace</b> is developed (scenarios) with defined airspace structure. The model is based on the temporal, vertical, and modular airspace sectorisation parameters in order to optimize flight efficiency. The presented model brings significant improvement in flight efficiency (in terms of reduced flight distance) for air carriers that planned to fly through the selected flexible airspace structure (LI_RST- 49) ...|$|R

40|$|The {{automation}} {{of various}} aspects of air traffic management has many wide-reaching benefits including: reducing the workload for Air Traffic Controllers; increasing the flexibility of operations (both civil and military) within the airspace system through facilitating automated dynamic changes to en-route flight plans; ensuring safe aircraft separation for a complex mix <b>of</b> <b>airspace</b> users within a highly complex and dynamic airspace management system architecture. These benefits accumulate {{to increase the efficiency}} and flexibility <b>of</b> <b>airspace</b> use(1). Such functions are critical for the anticipated increase in volume of manned and unmanned aircraft traffic.
