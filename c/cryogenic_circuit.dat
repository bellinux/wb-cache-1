40|$|In {{the present}} scenario, the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) is in {{progress}} and efforts are being made to extend ITER to DEMOnstration Power plant (DEMO) with the purpose to harness the fusion energy for peaceful and constructive purposes. ITER uses the sueperconducting magnet systems for trapping and maneuvering plasma inside the giant tokamak machines. Superconductivity only entails under the critical conditions of temperature, magnetic field and current density. If any of these parameters surpass the critical value, the quench ensues in the cable. In the real system scenarios, electromagnetic, radiative & conductive loads are present, which may affect {{the performance of the}} machine. The magnet designer can change the parameters in terms of current and magnetic field to ensure that the critical conditions are met, {{but when it comes to}} temperature, it is really hard to locate the hot spot locations. To envisage such situations, it is essential to study thermal hydraulics and hence system code is needed for the whole superconducting magnet system. For such purposes, <b>Cryogenic</b> <b>Circuit,</b> Conductor and Coil code (4 C) was built, imbibing the thermal hydraulic modeling of the cable in Conduit conductors (including strands) coupled with structures (which give support to the winding pack, wound by conductors) and an external <b>cryogenic</b> <b>circuit.</b> During the thesis work, the pre-existing 4 C code, was modeled for various coils with or without external cooling circuit as required. Henceforth, it was implemented against the wide range of transients, fast transients (~ few seconds) as well as slow transients (~ few days or weeks) to test the flexibility of the code in studying the wide range of physical phenomenon on different time scales. Eventually, the results were validated against the available experimental data to observe the precision of the model in 4 C code. One of the analysis carried out during this dissertation included the cool down of one of the non planar coils (NPC) used in Wendelstein 7 -X, which was an example of slow transient.

40|$|In the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER), {{the nuclear}} {{radiation}} escaping from the vacuum vessel reaches the superconducting Toroidal Field (TF) magnets, {{contributing to the}} reduction of the temperature margin ΔTmar, i. e., of the difference between the current sharing temperature and the operating temperature. The TF magnets are designed to operate at a minimum ΔTmar of 0. 7 K. However, recent design activity on in-vessel components, e. g. the blanket and the in-vessel coils for plasma stability, suggests a potential enhancement of the nuclear heat load on the TF coils.

40|$|Abstract. Forschungszentrum Karlsruhe (FZK) is {{developing}} the cryopumps for the ITER heating neutral beam injectors. The system {{is characterized by}} high gas flows coming from different sources against which the cryopumps must maintain a pressure between 10 - 2 and 10 - 3 Pa in the beam line vessel. In the close arrangement of the beam line {{the size of the}} cryopump is limited to a flat rectangular geometry of 8 m length, 2. 75 m height and a depth of 0. 5 m.

40|$|Two modern {{cryogenic}} {{variants of}} the Pound circuit {{have been devised}} to increase the frequency stability of microwave oscillators that include cryogenic sapphire-filled cavity resonators. The original Pound circuit is a microwave frequency discriminator that provides feedback to stabilize a voltage-controlled microwave oscillator with respect to an associated cavity resonator. In the present <b>cryogenic</b> Pound <b>circuits,</b> the active microwave devices are implemented by use of state-of-the-art commercially available tunnel diodes that exhibit low flicker noise (required for high frequency stability) and function well at low temperatures and at frequencies up to several tens of gigahertz. While tunnel diodes are inherently operable as amplitude detectors and amplitude modulators, they cannot, by themselves, induce significant phase modulation. Therefore, each of the present <b>cryogenic</b> Pound <b>circuits</b> includes passive circuitry that transforms the AM into the required PM. Each circuit also contains an AM detector {{that is used to}} sample the microwave signal at the input terminal of the high-Q resonator for the purpose of verifying the desired AM null at this point.

40|$|The ITER superconducting (SC) magnets {{require the}} forced flow of {{supercritical}} He (SHe) at ~ 4. 5 K and ~ 0. 5 MPa, giving thermal-hydraulics (TH) {{a key role}} in the multi-physics arena of SC magnets. Here we introduce a multi-scale approach to the TH modelling of ITER magnets, based on the fact that the TH relevant space scales range from the 10 - 100 m of magnet size/Cable-In-Conduit Conductors (CICC) length, down to the 10 - 2 m of the transverse size of a CICC, while the relevant TH time scales also cover several orders of magnitude. On the "macro-scale", the entire system (winding + structures + <b>cryogenic</b> <b>circuit)</b> is considered; this requires the treatment of the "meso-scale", where single CICC are treated, weakly thermally coupled inside a winding as needed. The constitutive relations needed by the 1 D meso-scale models, i. e., friction factors and heat transfer coefficients, may in turn be derived analyzing a limited portion of the CICC on the "micro-scale", with detailed 2 D- 3 D Computational thermal-Fluid-Dynamics (CtFD) models. At each scale, the different issues related to code development, benchmarking/validation and application are considered in the paper. The choice of developing a code in-house is compared to the commercial codes and/or freeware. The reciprocal benefits obtained from these codes by the ITER magnet R&D program (which led, e. g., to the realization and test of Model and Insert coils, as well as many short samples), and vice versa, are discussed. Several examples of the multi-scale approach to the TH modelling of SC magnets will be presented in the paper, based on the experience developed during the last 15 years within our group, in collaboration with laboratories in the EU, Japan, Russia, South Korea, and the US. It is argued that the intrinsic modularity of the multi-scale approach leads to significant benefits. It is also argued that the effort towards verification&validation of the existing TH models of the ITER SC magnets has been rather limited so far, sometimes notwithstanding the existence of a significant experimental database; therefore it is recommended to launch a systematic initiative in that direction, with particular attention to the assessment of the predictive capabilities of the existing TH codes. While these capabilities are going to be more and more relevant for the ITER nuclear device, for operation and safety studies in particular, there is at this time hardly any evidence of such predictive capabilities in the published literatur...|$|E
40|$|The {{design of}} a {{suitable}} quench protection system is fundamental for the safe operation of superconducting magnets and in turn requires the accurate simulation of the quench transient. The quench propagation in a toroidal field (TF) coil for the future European fusion reactor (EU DEMO) is analyzed here considering the latest, layer-wound winding pack (WP) design proposed by ENEA. The thermal-hydraulic model of a TF coil implemented in the 4 C code is updated by including the external <b>cryogenic</b> <b>circuits</b> of the WP and of the casing cooling channels and proposing a preliminary layout of the quench lines. Three different locations are considered for the quench initiation: maximum temperature margin in the WP, and minimum and maximum temperature margin on the same turn of the innermost layer. The evolution of the main electrical and thermal-hydraulic parameters is simulated, such as voltage along each layer, quench front propagation both along and across the layers, hot spot temperature, pressurization of the coil and coolant mass flow rate at the coil boundaries, so that the 4 C code provides a reliable (in view of its validation) and detailed virtual monitor of what happens inside the coil during the quench transient.
