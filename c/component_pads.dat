40|$|Many BGA and CSP {{component}} suppliers {{have begun}} shipment of components {{with a variety}} of second generation lead-free solder ball alloys based on the improved mechanical shock resistance. Although in general mechanical performance has been improved, there have been questions raised on how much the mechanical performance of these lead-free solder ball alloys can vary with different board surface finishes such as NiAu and OSP. Mechanical testing was performed on Sn 3. 5 Ag and Sn 1 Ag 0. 5 Cu 676 PBGA components with 1 mm pitch and electrolytic Ni/Au finished <b>component</b> <b>pads.</b> These components were soldered with Sn 3 Ag 0. 5 Cu paste on either electrolytic Ni/Au or high temperature rated OSP board surface finish. The mechanical shock data indicated that among the four board surface finish/BGA component sphere alloy combinations, the Sn 1 Ag 0. 5 Cu (SAC 105) BGA sphere with NiAu board surface finish had the lowest drop test resistance among the combinations evaluated, which was not expected. Failure analysis of this and the other drop test combinations was carried out by dye-pry analysis and cross-sectioning to understand the failure locations on the soldered BGA joints. The results were assessed in terms of Weibull failure distributions, failure modes, failure locations, and microstructural analysis which included IMC thickness measurement and IMC compositional analysis and distribution. This analysis suggested a possible direct or indirect relationship between drop test results and unique IMC spalling of the Sn 1 Ag 0. 5 Cu (SAC 105) BGA sphere with NiAu board finish.

40|$|Printed Wiring Board (PWB) and Printed Circuit Board Assembly (PCBA) testing aims {{to ensure}} an error free board after the etching and the {{assembly}} processes. After the etching process, {{several types of}} errors might occur such as opens and bridges, which are already, showstoppers in Direct Current (DC) applications. Mouse bites, spurs and others such as weak traces, which can be problematic in Radio Frequency (RF) and high-speed signals applications. Loading expensive component on defective boards can be economically catastrophic especially for high volume production. The rule of ten which has been reported by the production experts says that the defect costs ten times when detected in the next testing phase. Bare board {{also needs to be}} tested for the characteristic impedance correctness due to the process variations and the compounding raw material tolerances that can cause characteristic impedance mismatches. Although testing the characteristic impedance is not in interest in some application, sampling the characteristic impedance for a specific design is one way to test the manufacturing process stability for better tuning, otherwise PWBs might differ from each other even within the same batch. In addition to the possibility of defective PWB, the assembly process is never perfect to achieve 100 % of PCBA yield due to the possible errors in the process steps such as paste application, pick and place operations and soldering process which might lead to bridges, opens, wrong or miss oriented components. For low volume production, flying probes test technology is cost efficient as compared to bed-of-nails. The performance of the flying probes system depends on the test algorithm, the mechanical speed and the number of probes. To reduce the initial and maintenance costs of the probing technology and to accelerate the test time, Paper A introduces a new indirect method to test PWB continuity and isolation testing using a single probe for testing both continuity and isolation at the same time. RF signal is injected into the trace under test, instead of a DC current. The phase shift between the incident and the reflected signals is measured as it carries the information about the correctness of the trace when compared with a reference value of the same trace in the correct board. The method shown an important capability for detecting PWB defects such as as opens, DC and RF bridges, exceeded and different width lines. The margin in the measurement between a defective and a correct board, which depends on the type of the defect, is about 7 % to 68 %. Applying this approach to PCBA testing led to significant margins between correct and defective interconnect. The test cases in paper C shown 40 % and 33 %. Moreover, this margin has been proven to be important even for short microstrip line, which intended to connect two typical IC pins. This technique is strongly recommended to be applied to PCBA testing where probing is feasible. The approach {{can be applied to the}} complete layout testing or to boost a test strategy whose test solutions are not covering 100 % of the possible defects. By applying this test solution to bed-of-nails equipment, 50 % of the probes will be reduced, on the other hand, for a given design with NI isolated traces and NA adjacent pairs, employing this solution to flying probes system with two probes, leads to the reduction of the number of tests from (NI+NA) tests to NI tests as isolation and continuity are performed in one go. Flying probes system involves mechanical movements, which dominate the test time, reducing the number of the mechanical movements increases dramatically the test throughput. On the other hand, this method is believed to be extremely fast to test the correctness of the characteristic impedance which is prone to variations due to the instability of the PWB manufacturing process, in the same time one could employ the method to evaluate the process stability by checking after each batch of PWBs. Paper B and D provide insight into the impact of the PWB manufacturing variations on the characteristic impedance. Moreover single probe approach is believed to have a good potential for Sequential Build-Up (SBU) interconnects testing where connections between <b>component</b> <b>pads</b> and the upper layers are often impossible to test with the current test technologies.

40|$|International audienceCompression {{bandages}} are {{a common}} treatment for some lymphatics or venous pathologies. The treatment success directly depends on the pressure which is applied on the external surface of the leg and which is then transmitted to the internal tissues. This interface pressure (between the limb and the bandage) depends mainly on the following parameters:- the bandage <b>components</b> (<b>padding</b> layers, …) - their mechanical properties- the bandage stretch- the application technique (spiral, …) and number of layers (overlap) - patient’s leg morphology- other parameters such as friction between the different bandage layers. Though the efficacy of this treatment is admitted [1], its action mechanism and the pressure it applies on the leg remain poorly understood [2]. For now, the reference method for the computation of interface pressure applied by compression bandage is Laplace’s Law:P = n T / r (1) with P the local pressure, n the number of layers of the bandage, T the bandage tension (i. e. force to stretch the bandage), r the local radius of curvature of the limb. However, this law, which only considers the non-deformed state of the limb, is unable to accurately predict interface pressures [3].

40|$|International audienceElastic {{compression}} bandage is {{a common}} treatment for venous or lymphatic disorders. Even though the efficacy of this treatment is admitted, its mechanism remains poorly understood. The success of the treatment depends on the applied pressure, which depends on the bandage tension and the curvature of the limb (Laplace’s Law), the number of layers of the bandage, its <b>components</b> (<b>padding</b> layer, crepe …) and elastic properties, and the interactions between bandages and leg. To better understand the action of compression bandage, many interface pressure measurements have been done, but those measurements only give local information and for now, the whole pressure distribution on the leg is not known. Also, due to complex leg curvature and to bandage-leg and bandage-bandage interactions, the Laplace’s law {{is not sufficient to}} give a fine description of the pressure fields. Some simulations of the leg compression exist. Most of them are modeling the action of a compression sock on a leg [1][2], whose mechanical properties are more or less complex [3].

40|$|Introduction: Impairment {{of working}} memory in {{children}} with {{attention deficit hyperactivity disorder}} (ADHD) has been well described. If similar impairment in working memory can be demonstrated among their siblings, this could suggest impaired working memory is a genetic component of ADHD. Methods: Fifty-seven subjects were recruited: (1) ADHD group (n= 21); (2) siblings of ADHD children group (n= 15); and (3) non-ADHD children with chronic medical condition as the control group (n= 21). All subjects were aged between 6 and 15 years, and ADHD was diagnosed according to DSM-IV-TR. Those with other comorbidity or IQ< 70 were excluded. Digit Recall was used for assessment of the phonological loop component, Maze Memory test for the visuospatial sketch <b>pad</b> <b>component</b> and Backward Digit Recall for the central executive component of working memory. Results: ADHD children and their siblings showed similar impairment and both differed from the control group on the Maze Memory test.

The Backward Digit Recall score did not show any significant difference between the three groups.

50|$|Early {{mattresses}} {{contained a}} variety of natural materials including straw, feathers or horse hair. In {{the first half of}} the 20th century, a typical mattress sold in North America had an innerspring core and cotton batting or fiberfill. Modern mattresses usually contain either an inner spring core or materials such as latex, viscoelastic or other flexible polyurethane foams. Other fill <b>components</b> include insulator <b>pads</b> over the coils that prevent the bed's upholstery layers from cupping down into the innerspring, as well as polyester fiberfill in the bed's top upholstery layers. In 1899 James Marshall introduced the first individually wrapped pocketed spring coil mattress now commonly known as Marshall coils.|$|R
