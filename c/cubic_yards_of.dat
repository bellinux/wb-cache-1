5|$|Hours after Humberto made landfall, Rick Perry {{declared}} Galveston, Jefferson, and Orange counties as disaster areas, which allocated {{state resources}} {{to assist the}} affected residents. The governor applied for a presidential disaster declaration on September 21. Four Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) teams assessed the hurricane damage in the three most affected counties. Following their assessment, they determined that {{the damage caused by}} Humberto was not significant enough to require a disaster declaration. As such, Governor Rick Perry's request from FEMA was denied. Across the Bolivar Peninsula, an estimated 1,500 <b>cubic</b> <b>yards</b> <b>of</b> structural debris and 3,000 <b>cubic</b> <b>yards</b> <b>of</b> tree limbs were needed to be removed {{in the wake of the}} storm.|$|E
5|$|Planning for {{the lake}} began in 1987. The main {{goal was to}} meet Southern California seasonal, drought and {{emergency}} needs. MWD chose the current site because of its geographic location, and began construction planning in 1993. Construction of the lake in 1995 with construction of the three dams. With over 40 million <b>cubic</b> <b>yards</b> <b>of</b> foundation excavation and 110 million <b>cubic</b> <b>yards</b> <b>of</b> embankment construction, {{the construction of the}} dams was the largest earthworks project in the United States. The shovels, loaders and trucks used on the project were the largest available and established a new standard for earth and rock movement. The two rock processing plants established for the project provided combined production exceeding the capability of any single commercial processing operation in California. Construction of the lake was the largest construction project by the MWD since building the Colorado River Aqueduct.|$|E
25|$|The {{physical}} {{scale of}} the facility alone made the construction project challenging. By the time the “conventional facility” (the shell for the laser) was complete in 2001, more than 210,000 <b>cubic</b> <b>yards</b> <b>of</b> soil had been excavated, more than 73,000 <b>cubic</b> <b>yards</b> <b>of</b> concrete had been poured, 7,600 tons of reinforcing steel rebar had been placed, and more than 5,000 tons of structural steel had been erected. In addition to its sheer size, building NIF presented a number of unique challenges. To isolate the laser system from vibration, the foundation of each laser bay was made independent {{of the rest of}} the structure. Three-foot-thick, 420-foot-long and 80-foot-wide slabs, each containing 3,800 <b>cubic</b> <b>yards</b> <b>of</b> concrete, required continuous concrete pours to achieve their specifications.|$|E

50|$|On average, 10 to 12 {{automobile}} tires {{create one}} <b>cubic</b> <b>yard</b> <b>of</b> Mechanical Concrete and 12,000 tire-derived cylinders create a 12-foot-wide, mile-long lane of roadway and 8000 to cover one acre.|$|R
50|$|The project {{required}} 90,000 <b>cubic</b> <b>yards</b> (70,000 m³) <b>of</b> fill {{as well as}} 30,000 <b>cubic</b> <b>yards</b> (20,000 m³) <b>of</b> {{crushed rock}} to complete the sub-base. The travel surface required 15,000 <b>cubic</b> <b>yards</b> (10,000 m³) <b>of</b> gravel, 19 inches thick before asphalt was applied. Construction equipment and material were stored at a depot Long Gull Pond during the project.|$|R
25|$|Munisport Landfill {{comprises}} some , containing 6.2 million <b>cubic</b> <b>yards</b> <b>of</b> municipal, biohazardous, {{and industrial}} waste. It {{is a registered}} Superfund site.|$|E
25|$|This site {{is being}} {{addressed}} through {{state and local}} funds and is not considered a Superfund clean-up site. The property is contaminated with an undisclosed substance. To clean up the contamination, 1,708 <b>cubic</b> <b>yards</b> <b>of</b> soil was removed. The site is located on Prescott Drive, Block 233 Lot 13.|$|E
25|$|The dam {{will consist}} of a dike of 220 feet high by 1,230 feet wide. It will use 368,000 <b>cubic</b> <b>yards</b> <b>of</b> {{compressed}} concrete. As of 22 March 2009, 88 percent of the concrete work had been completed. Its scheduled completion date is 2013. The total investment is $375 million USD.|$|E
50|$|The dam has a {{total length}} of 32022 ft, almost 6 miles (10 km), of which 22347 ft are in Mexico and 9585 ft in the United States. The center section at the Rio Grande is a {{concrete}} gravity dam 2182 ft long, {{with the remainder}} being earthen embankment. In total, the dam contains 13.5 million <b>cubic</b> <b>yards</b> (10,300,000 m3) <b>of</b> earth, 1.8 million <b>cubic</b> <b>yards</b> (1,400,000 m3) <b>of</b> concrete, 1.76 million <b>cubic</b> <b>yards</b> (1,300,000 m3) <b>of</b> riprap, and 12,500 tons (11,300 metric tons) of steel. The maximum height above the riverbed is 254 ft, and the elevation at the dam crest is 1152.3 ft above sea level. The roadway along the dam crest is 32.8 ft wide.|$|R
5000|$|All roof-holes, {{excepting}} {{those over}} piers, were treated by this formula. The piers, being very irregular {{in shape and}} size, would have exacted much care and time to have located the holes and proportioned the charges to the exact mathematical requirements in each case. One pound {{and a half of}} explosives were assigned, as a rule, to each <b>cubic</b> <b>yard</b> <b>of</b> the piers; it being considered of the first importance to demolish completely these supports of the roof.|$|R
25|$|In {{its early}} years rock-cracking, hard labour and solitary {{confinement}} were the notable features of life at the prison. It was seen that hard worked prisoners would not wish {{to return to the}} prison, with solitary confinement giving them time to reflect on past misdeeds. From inception prisoners main task was the breaking <b>of</b> one <b>cubic</b> <b>yard</b> <b>of</b> rock per day. Until the middle of the 20th century the prisons department's philosophy remained punitive with much reliance on obedience to rules and regulations.|$|R
25|$|The new Memorial Tunnel bypass cost $35 {{million and}} {{required}} years of work. Ten million <b>cubic</b> <b>yards</b> <b>of</b> earth were removed {{and used as}} fill with drainage tiles for Paint Creek. 300,000 tons of coal were extracted. The Bender Bridge was demolished. The former Memorial Tunnel was used for storage until the mid-1990s, when it became a testing center for tunnel-fire suppression for Boston's Big Dig project.|$|E
25|$|Due to the 150 foot {{water depth}} of the narrows, the Tower Pedestals are each {{the size of a}} 20-story office building, with an overall size of 130 x 80 x 225 feet, on which rest the 510 foot towers. They are {{designed}} to withstand daily 7 knot currents and a twice daily 15 foot tidal swing. Each tower pedestal used 34,000 <b>cubic</b> <b>yards</b> <b>of</b> concrete for construction.|$|E
25|$|Construction of {{the bridge}} took place from October 1920 to February 1921. The span is 503ft., with a height of 71ft. in the center; the steel weighs 2,000 tons, and rests on two {{concrete}} piers, each 50ft. high and 70 x 40ft. in cross-section, and each containing 1,500 <b>cubic</b> <b>yards</b> <b>of</b> concrete. The location was chosen, just downstream of a curve, after observing the pattern of ice jams through the preceding three years.|$|E
50|$|Chicago {{specified}} that this ERV {{must meet the}} demanding requirements placed on all of its garbage trucks. This included 60 mile range, a payload capacity of nine tons and 1000 pounds per <b>cubic</b> <b>yard</b> <b>of</b> compaction. These specifications make the ERV capable of use anywhere in Chicago. To supply enough electricity to move the truck and power the hydraulics all day, the ERV is equipped with 200 kilowatt-hours of energy, in ten battery packs. Full charge time is 8 hours using the Motiv Universal Fast Charger.|$|R
500|$|The Croton Dam {{is one of}} the {{earliest}} examples of the use of this technique east of the Mississippi River. The chief advantage of the hydraulic sluicing method was its cost. The total cost of constructing the [...] embankment, which contained [...] of material, was only $7,076, or about 7 cents per <b>cubic</b> <b>yard</b> <b>of</b> material moved. [...] Fargo also used this method to construct a fill of [...] for a highway bridge crossing the Muskegon River immediately downstream from the dam. The fill Fargo built for the highway bridge approach cost roughly the same.|$|R
50|$|Historically and today, {{cooperation}} {{has been}} at the forefront of the community’s mission. Founder Arthur Morgan explained the cooperative element of Celo by employing a metaphor, which he named “human uranium.” Morgan explained that although a <b>cubic</b> <b>yard</b> <b>of</b> granite contains enough uranium to blow up a mountain, the particles have no effect when separated. Only when brought together, in what is called a “critical mass,” can they exercise power. Morgan saw people in the same way: when brought together with common goals and ideals they have great power.|$|R
25|$|In December 2008, the {{collapse}} of an embankment at an impoundment for wet storage of fly ash at the Tennessee Valley Authority's Kingston Fossil Plant caused a major release of 5.4 million <b>cubic</b> <b>yards</b> <b>of</b> coal fly ash, damaging 3 homes and flowing into the Emory River. Cleanup costs may exceed $1.2 billion. This spill was followed {{a few weeks later}} by a smaller TVA-plant spill in Alabama, which contaminated Widows Creek and the Tennessee River.|$|E
25|$|The mining {{has had a}} {{considerable}} environmental impact. In 1920 the Rivers Commission estimated that 300 million <b>cubic</b> <b>yards</b> <b>of</b> material had been moved by mining activity in the Clutha river catchment. At that time an estimated 40 million cubic yards had been washed out to sea with a further 60 million in the river. (The remainder was still on riverbanks). This had resulted in measured aggradation of the river bottom {{of as much as}} 5 metres.|$|E
25|$|In 1978, Congress {{passed the}} Uranium Mill Tailings Radiation Control Act (UMTRCA), a measure {{designed}} {{to assist in}} the cleanup of 22 inactive ore-processing sites throughout the southwest. This also included constructing 19 disposal sites for the tailings, which contain a total of 40 million <b>cubic</b> <b>yards</b> <b>of</b> low-level radioactive material. The Environmental Protection Agency estimates that there are 4000 mines with documented uranium production, and another 15,000 locations with uranium occurrences in 14 western states, most found in the Four Corners area and Wyoming.|$|E
5000|$|The Croton Dam {{is one of}} the {{earliest}} examples of the use of this technique east of the Mississippi River. The chief advantage of the hydraulic sluicing method was its cost. The total cost of constructing the 370 ft embankment, which contained [...] of material, was only $7,076, or about 7 cents per <b>cubic</b> <b>yard</b> <b>of</b> material moved.

40|$|Latex Modified Concrete (LMC) is ordinarily {{used as a}} thin overlay {{to shield}} bridge decks from the {{intensified}} application of deicers and environmental elements {{as well as the}} normal wear and tear due to traffic. LMC is an ideal concrete for bridge overlays due to its low permeability, inherent flexibility, and excellent adhesion. Another important quality for this concrete that can’t be neglected is its lifespan. Currently, the standard is to use 24. 5 gallons of latex for every <b>cubic</b> <b>yard</b> <b>of</b> concrete needed (121 L/m 3). Recognizing that the latex is an expensive ingredient and its cost may dramatically increase when the oil prices are sky rocketing, the immediate objective of this research is to study the impact of reducing the quantity of latex used in a <b>cubic</b> <b>yard</b> <b>of</b> concrete. The goal is to reduce the initial cost of making the LMC by decreasing the amount of latex without affecting its performance and durability. The test results showed that LMC mix design with latex content of 20 gallons/yd 3 (98. 8 L/m 3) has comparable performance to the typical LMC mix design with 24. 5 gallons/yd 3 (121 L/m 3) in terms of compressive and flexural strengths, permeability, and shrinkage. This indicates that the latex cost could be reduced by about 20 % without adverse effect on the major performance characteristics of the LMC overlays...|$|R
5000|$|Another {{contract}} was awarded on December 5, 2001 {{at a total}} of $18,549,091 to construct 2.68 mi of Corridor H from county route 23/8 to the west approach of the Lost River bridge. Grading and drainage required 3.3 million <b>cubic</b> <b>yards</b> (2,500,000 m³) <b>of</b> earthwork, including over 1 million <b>cubic</b> <b>yards</b> (800,000 m³) <b>of</b> [...] "borrow" [...] material and several 60 in pipes to carry small streams underneath the roadway. A three-span fabricated steel girder bridge was constructed to carry the four-lane divided highway over Sauerkraut Run.|$|R
25|$|The {{club was}} started in March 1962, {{by members of the}} former Philadelphia Model Railroad Club, which had been located in the B {{passenger}} station on Chestnut St. in Philadelphia, after the B station was demolished. (Some members of the PMRC also went on to start the East Penn Traction Club several years later.) When first started, the space was an 80' x 35' unfinished crawl space directly under the original 1890's chapel. Finishing the space took weeks, with the removal of 4' of dirt before 20 <b>cubic</b> <b>yards</b> <b>of</b> concrete was used for the new floor.|$|E
25|$|The Uranium Mill Tailings Radiation Control Act is a United States {{environmental}} law that amended the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 {{and gave the}} Environmental Protection Agency the authority to establish health and environmental standards for the stabilization, restoration, and disposal of uranium mill waste. Title 1 of the Act required the EPA to set environmental protection standards consistent with the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, including groundwater protection limits; the Department of Energy to implement EPA standards and provide perpetual care for some sites; and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to review cleanups and license sites to states or the DOE for perpetual care. Title 1 established a uranium mill remedial action program jointly funded {{by the federal government}} and the state. Title 1 of the Act also designated 22 inactive uranium mill sites for remediation, resulting in the containment of 40 million <b>cubic</b> <b>yards</b> <b>of</b> low-level radioactive material in UMTRCA Title 1 holding cells.|$|E
25|$|By the 13th century, the {{wheelbarrow}} proved useful in building construction, mining operations, and agriculture. However, going by surviving documents and illustrations {{the wheelbarrow}} remained a relative rarity until the 15th century. It {{also seemed to}} be limited to England, France, and the Low Countries. Eastward diffusion of the technology was uneven and not especially fast: the wheelbarrow was still unknown in Russia and its neighbors as late as the reign of Peter the Great. The conscript laborers who dug millions of <b>cubic</b> <b>yards</b> <b>of</b> earth to create the city of St. Petersburg--with its extensive system of canals and the levees and embankments required to keep the city dry--carried dirt either in handbaskets or the fronts of their long, tunic-like shirts. On the occasion of Peter's first visit to England, the young tsar and his traveling companions found a wheelbarrow in the garden of the house where they lodged; not knowing its purpose, they used it for drunken wheelbarrow races.|$|E
5000|$|In 1995, BedRoc Limited, LLC {{bought the}} land, and {{continued}} to remove sand and gravel under an interim agreement with the Department of the Interior. Under the agreement, BedRoc Limited had to place money in escrow from the sale <b>of</b> each <b>cubic</b> <b>yard</b> <b>of</b> sand and gravel that the company removed, pending a final resolution. A year later, BedRoc Limited transferred 40 acres of the land to Western Elite, Inc. The Interior Board of Land Appeals upheld {{the decision by the}} BLM in 1997, relying on the legislative history of the Pittman Act and on Congress' intent.|$|R
40|$|Previous testing by BSRI/SRTC/Raytheon {{indicated}} that the CLSM specified for the Tank 20 closure generates about 6 gallons (23 liters) of bleed water per <b>cubic</b> <b>yard</b> <b>of</b> material (0. 76 m 3). 1 This amount to about 10 {{percent of the total}} mixing water. HLWE requested that the CLSM mix be optimized to reduce bleed water while maintaining flow. Elimination of bleed water from the CLSM mix specified for High-Level Waste Tank Closure will result in waste minimization, time savings and cost savings. Over thirty mixes were formulated and evaluated at the on-site Raytheon Test Laboratory. Improved low bleed water CLSM mixes were identified. Results are documented in this report...|$|R
40|$|Ritchie Creek drains 2. 6 {{square miles}} {{before joining the}} Napa River north of Bale, California. A six- foot high dam was built in 1912 on Ritchie Creek to {{facilitate}} water development. The dam interfered with steelhead trout migration upstream to potential spawning habitats and was removed in 1993. Ten years after dam removal, we resurveyed four cross sections and compared them with the cross sections taken in the same location in 1993 just prior to dam removal. Our survey documented sediment erosion <b>of</b> 679 <b>cubic</b> <b>yards</b> upstream <b>of</b> the dam site, which {{is less than the}} probable yearly sediment yield for the watershed basin. Our survey also showed slight sediment aggradation <b>of</b> 99 <b>cubic</b> <b>yards</b> downstream <b>of</b> the dam site.

25|$|The {{straight}} six {{extension of}} the Doomben Racecourse was utilised as a ready made apron for the hangars which were to be built. Initial works were delayed by heavy rain for three weeks converting the ground to a quagmire, {{and as a result}} thousands of feet of ashes and coke breeze were carted from the gasworks and deposited in order to keep trucks moving with borrow material from Nudgee. By 18 February 1942 the construction of one hangar had begun and the SW-NE runway was nearing completion. Shiploads of aircraft components were arriving at the port and had to be transported to Amberley for assembly until Eagle Farm was ready. The Americans advised that the runways were urgently needed for the fighter plane protection of Brisbane, and as a result two ten-hour shifts were organised using 100 trucks which hauled 33,000 <b>cubic</b> <b>yards</b> <b>of</b> fill to complete the section, and on 29 March 1942 a squadron of P-39 aircraft landed.|$|E
25|$|The {{technical}} requirements and exacting standards required of a facility like the Kauffman Center made {{it one of}} the most complex structures in the world to design and build. The building, which took nearly five years to complete, contains 40,000 square feet of glass, 25,000 <b>cubic</b> <b>yards</b> <b>of</b> concrete, and 27 steel cables. The main lobby, Brandmeyer Great Hall, is built of a glass ceiling and sloping glass walls that provide a panoramic view of Kansas City to the south. The twenty-seven steel cables on the south façade are anchored in embeds that weigh approximately one and a half tons, and the embeds are an extension of the foundation and bedrock beneath the building. When the steel cables were pulled taut during the construction process, the entire steel structure shifted two to six inches to the south. This tensioning provides stability to the structure and keeps the glass lobby securely in place. The Kauffman Center covers 13 acres (53,000 m2), including landscaped grounds over the 1,000-space, city-owned Arts District Garage. The cost of the project was approximately $413 million, which includes both a $40 million operating endowment and the city’s $47 million construction of the parking garage. The Kauffman Center was designed by lead architect Moshe Safdie, acoustician Yasuhisa Toyota, theater consultant Theatre Projects Consultants and Richard Pilbrow, and engineering firm Arup. Local firm BNIM was the associate architect. Lead contractor was J.E. Dunn Construction Group of Kansas City.|$|E
500|$|During the construction, 2.2 million <b>cubic</b> <b>yards</b> <b>of</b> {{earthwork}} was used, 350,000 <b>cubic</b> <b>yards</b> <b>of</b> concrete {{was mixed}} on site, and 300,000 {{square feet of}} retaining walls were built. Additionally, [...] 40,000 feet [...] of drilled shafts [...] and 75,000 linear feet of drainage pipe were completed. In addition {{to the construction of}} 43 permanent bridges, six temporary bridges were built, resulting in 2.3 million square feet of bridge deck.|$|E
25|$|The Ciudadela {{is a great}} {{enclosed}} compound {{capable of}} holding 100,000 people. About 700,000 <b>cubic</b> meters (<b>yards)</b> <b>of</b> material was used to construct its buildings.
