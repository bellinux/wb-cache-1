5|$|Sir Randolph Crewe died a <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>years</b> <b>later,</b> {{before the}} end of the First Civil War. His male line died out in 1684, and the hall passed to the Offley family by the {{marriage}} of Sir Randolph's great-granddaughter, Anne Crewe, to John Offley of Madeley Old Manor, Staffordshire. Their eldest son, also John (1681–1749), took the name Crewe in 1708. The Offley–Crewe family was very wealthy at this time: John Offley Crewe's income at his death was estimated at £15,000 per year (£ today). Both John Offley Crewe and his son John Crewe (1709–1752) served as members of parliament for Cheshire.|$|E
5|$|There is circumstantial {{evidence}} that the rules also influenced Australian rules football conceived a <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>years</b> <b>later.</b> The two codes shared the unique feature of lacking the offside rule. There are also similarities in the laws for kicking off, kick outs, throw-ins and the fair catch. Henry Creswick (possibly a relative of Nathaniel Creswick) was born in Sheffield but emigrated to Australia with his brother in 1840 (the town of Creswick is named after them). He moved to Melbourne in 1854 and {{became involved in the}} local cricket scene.

5|$|His injury {{problems}} {{started as}} early as 1980, when he was 15 years old and saw Glentoran's physio Bobby McGregor to resolve a groin strain; Whiteside said that the highly physical massage he was subjected to damaged his pelvis and robbed him of his natural pace. His lack of pace was later seen as the one weakness in his game. Six weeks into his apprenticeship, in July 1981, and an innocuous looking challenge by a Preston North End player in an 'A' team game saw Whiteside requiring an operation on his right knee. Had the injury occurred a <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>years</b> <b>later</b> {{he would have been}} able to have pioneering keyhole surgery, which could potentially have saved his career. After a seven-month lay-off and a further operation to remove cartilage, he returned to fitness in January 1982. He had to adapt his playing style to compensate for his damaged knee and pelvis, and developed well under youth team coach Eric Harrison.|$|E

5|$|The {{species was}} {{originally}} described by American mycologist Charles Horton Peck in 1898. Peck collected the type specimen in Port Jefferson, New York. In 1945, Rolf Singer proposed the variety Boletus auripes var. aureissimus {{as a new}} combination of the name Ceriomyces aureissimus described by William Alphonso Murrill in 1938; this taxon is now regarded as a distinct species under the name Boletus aureissimus. In 1936, Wally Snell reported finding a specimen of Boletus crassipes, another species described by Peck from Mount Gretna, Pennsylvania. Snell suggested that although B.crassipes might be a valid species distinguished from B.auripes by a deeper brown cap color, yellow flesh that does not fade to white, and a stem with a more orange-yellow color and more extensive reticulation, he conceded {{that it was not}} clear that the morphological characteristics between the two did not overlap, and that further collections would be needed to clarify any differences between them. A <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>years</b> <b>later,</b> he was more convinced of his stance and considered the two conspecific.

25|$|The {{transition}} to red grape varieties was slow.

However, white wine grapes continued to dominate the vineyards of Pomerol until the late 19th century when the higher prices of red clarets and the waning Dutch influence made red wine production more enticing. When the region received its full AOC status in 1936, the AOC regulation specifically outlawed the plantings of any white grape varieties in Pomerol.|$|R

50|$|The Mythological Cycle {{dealt with}} the Tuatha Dé Danann, the gods of good, and the Fomorians, gods of {{darkness}} and evil, and giving us, under the apparently early history of the various races that colonised Ireland, really a distorted early Celtic pantheon. According to these accounts, the Nemedians first seized upon the islands and were oppressed by the Fomorians, who are described as African sea-robbers; these races nearly exterminated {{each other at the}} fight round Conand's Tower on Tory Island. Some of the Nemedians escaped to Greece and came back a <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> hundred <b>years</b> <b>later</b> calling themselves Fir Bolg.

Good sagas about both of these battles are preserved, each existing in only a single copy. Nearly all the rest of this most interesting cycle has been lost or is to be found merely in condensed summaries. These mythological pieces dealt with people, dynasties, and probably the struggle between good and evil principles. There is over it all a sense of vagueness and uncertainty.|$|R

40|$|Neanderthals {{are without}} doubt {{one of the}} most studied extinct hominin populations in the world. Questions {{regarding}} their adaptability, survival skills and cognition have been the focus of many researchers for decades. One of the most heavily debated topics however remains that of their extinction. Neanderthals occupied an immense region of Eurasia, stretching from the southern tip of the Iberian Peninsula to the hills of southern Siberia. The chronology of their demise {{and the extent to which}} their disappearance overlapped with the earliest colonization of Eurasia by anatomically modern humans, are key questions in Palaeolithic archaeology. Studying the demise of Neanderthals is important in that aspect as it will provide a better understanding and broader insights of the hominin evolution during the Late Pleistocene. By establishing the exact timing of their demise, archaeologists will be able to answer questions regarding the cause of their disappearance. The Neanderthal demise has been dated numerous times, with the focus on direct and indirect dates. Researchers who previously aimed to date their demise concluded that the Mousterian had ended by 41 - 39 ka cal. BP, claiming that no Neanderthals survived after this time. However, Neanderthal remains have been found to date a <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> thousands <b>of</b> <b>years</b> <b>later.</b> Moreover, it is not unlikely that Neanderthals disappeared from various regions at different times. In this thesis study, I have therefore focused on direct AMS dates obtained from late Neanderthal fossils, as these direct dates best represent the age of the hominin remains. I divided Eurasia in three separate regions, from which different demise patterns were established. In total 11 late Neanderthal sites were obtained, yielding 58 direct AMS dates. Each fossil sample was individually analyzed and evaluated. Results have shown that Neanderthals can be directly dated as late as 35. 7 ka cal. BP in western Europe, 42. 1 ka cal. BP in western Asia and 35. 3 ka cal. BP in central Europe. Over the past few decades, improvements in pre-treatment methods and radiocarbon dating have yielded a vast growth in late Pleistocene chronologies. Databases and publications derived from these chronologies ought to be properly audited and quality standards need to be met, to ensure that research obtained today remains valuable and applicable in the future...|$|R
6000|$|The earlier {{forms of}} Indian {{philosophy}} agreed with those prevalent {{in our own}} times, in supposing {{the existence of a}} permanent reality, or [...] "substance," [...] beneath the shifting series of phenomena, whether of matter or of mind. The substance of the cosmos was [...] "Brahma," [...] that of the individual man [...] "Atman;" [...] and the latter was separated from the former only, if I may so speak, by its phenomenal envelope, by the casing of sensations, thoughts and desires, pleasures and pains, which make up the illusive phantasmagoria of life. This the ignorant take for reality; their [...] "Atman" [...] therefore remains eternally imprisoned in delusions, bound by the fetters of desire and scourged by the whip of misery. But the man who has attained enlightenment sees that the apparent reality is mere illusion, or, as was said a <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> thousand <b>years</b> <b>later,</b> that there is nothing good nor bad but thinking makes it so.

If the karma is modifiable by self-discipline, if its coarser desires, one after another, can be extinguished, the ultimate [64] fundamental desire of self-assertion, or the desire to be, may also be destroyed.

40|$|Rare granulitized eclogites {{exposed in}} the eastern Himalaya provide insight into {{conditions}} and processes deep within the orogen. Sensitive high-resolution ion microprobe (SHRIMP) U-Pb, Ti, and rare earth element (REE) data from zircons in mafic granulitized eclogites located in the upper structural levels of the Greater Himalayan Sequence in Bhutan show that zircon was crystallized under eclogite-facies metamorphic conditions between 15. 3 ± 0. 3 and 14. 4 ± 0. 3 Ma, within a <b>couple</b> million <b>years</b> <b>of</b> the <b>later</b> granulite-facies overprint. In conjunction with pressure estimates of the eclogite- and granulite-facies stages of metamorphism, the age data suggest that initial exhumation occurred at plate-tectonic rates (cm yr – 1). These extremely rapid synconvergence exhumation rates during the later stages of the India-Asia collision require a revision of theories for the transportation and exhumation of crustal materials during continental collisions. In contrast to western Himalayan examples, the eastern Himalayan eclogites cannot be tectonically related to steep subduction of India beneath Asia. Instead, they more likely represent fragments {{from the base of}} the overthickened Tibetan crust. Based on the zircon age and trace-element data, we hypothesize that the protolith of the mafic granulites was middle Miocene mafic intrusions into the lower crust of southern Tibet, linked to Miocene volcanism in the Lhasa block. We suggest that a transient tectonic event—possibly the indenting of a strong Indian crustal ramp into crust under southern Tibet that had been weakened by partial melting—may have promoted exhumation of the eclogitized lower crust under Tibet. The mafic magmatism and volcanism themselves may have been related to the convective thinning of the lithospheric mantle triggered by a reduction in the India-Eurasia convergence rate during the middle Miocene, which in turn could have facilitated the rapid extrusion of the lower crust over the earlier-exhumed middle crust. ...|$|R
