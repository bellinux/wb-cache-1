25|$|South Korea: HSR Electrification Design. SNCF advised Korean Railroads on the {{electrification}} {{of tracks}} between Daegu and Busan and on linking existing conventional tracks {{to the new}} high-speed line. SNCF also assisted in selecting and inspecting high-speed rolling stock and trained 400 senior manager, engineers, and executives in {{a broad range of}} skills, including signalling, <b>catenaries,</b> track, rolling stock maintenance, HSR operation, safety management, marketing, and passenger information systems. Until the end of 2009, SNCF assisted Korea in maintaining its high-speed.|$|E
25|$|The first multi-system TRAXX {{unit that}} could operate under AC and DC {{electrified}} <b>catenaries,</b> SBB Re484001, was introduced {{at the same}} time 185561 was introduced as demonstrator locomotive for the F140AC2 type. In addition to the 15kV/16.7Hz and 25kV/50Hz AC supplies, the new model could also be operated under 3kV DC overhead electrification. Later models also supported a 1.5kV DC supply. This locomotive for SBB was also the first TRAXX variant with individual axle control in place of individual bogie control. The general type name given by Bombardier was TRAXX F140 MS.|$|E
500|$|Another of Gaudí's {{innovations}} {{in the technical}} realm {{was the use of}} a scale model to calculate structures: for the church of the Colònia Güell, he built a 1:10 scale model with a height of [...] in a shed next to the building. There, he set up a model that had strings with small bags full of birdshot hanging from them. On a drawing board that was attached to the ceiling he drew the floor of the church, and he hung the strings (for the <b>catenaries)</b> with the birdshot (for the weight) from the supporting points of the building—columns, intersection of walls. These weights produced a catenary curve in both the arches and vaults. At that point, he took a picture that, when inverted, showed the structure for columns and arches that Gaudí was looking for. Gaudí then painted over these photographs with gouache or pastel. The outline of the church defined, he recorded every single detail of the building: architectural, stylistic and decorative.|$|E

2500|$|Construction of the San Diego Trolley {{proceeded}} incrementally. [...] The initial {{construction of}} new track focused mainly in downtown San Diego. [...] The work on the SD railroad track is best described as ‘rehabilitation’. [...] The MTDB replaced 40% of all ties, cropped and welded the jointed rail, constructed electric <b>catenaries,</b> and installed an absolute block signal system. [...] To control costs, the San Diego Trolley ordered only 14 cars, and did not install ‘mimic’ boards or the on-train location equipment until after the East Line was completed in 1989. [...] No new sidings were initially installed on the SD segment, which had three passing sidings between San Diego and San Ysidro. [...] Service started at 15-minute headways using the rehabilitated single-track line.|$|E

40|$|The <b>catenary</b> {{is one of}} {{the most}} common curves; it is, in fact, the shape assumed by a {{homogeneous}} and inextensible chain, fixed to the extremities, which is subject only to its own weight. The <b>catenary</b> has always fascinated not only mathematicians but also architects and engineers, who have often used it in their works due to its remarkable properties.  In this note, the <b>catenary</b> is introduced by determining its equation and considering its history from Galileo Galilei to the present day, pointing out a historical mistake. Then, some of its applications to architecture and engineering are shown and the <b>catenary</b> is compared to the parabola, a curve that at first sight can look similar to <b>catenary</b> but must not be confused with it.

50|$|This {{is done by}} a <b>catenary</b> curve: <b>Catenary</b> arches are strong, as they {{redirect}} {{the vertical}} force of gravity into compression forces pressing along the arch's curve. In a uniformly loaded <b>catenary</b> arch, the line of thrust runs through its center.|$|R

40|$|Abstract- The resent {{developed}} {{high speed}} train called HEMU- 430 X (Highspeed Electric Multiple Unit- 430 ㎞/h eXperiment) recorded a 421. 4 km/h in Kyoungbu high speed line in Korea. A verity of measurement systems {{are used to}} check the performance between pantograph and <b>catenary</b> system. An innovative measurement system is adopted to check the current of <b>catenary</b> wire in the track side during HEMU- 430 X test running. This paper presents the measurement results of <b>catenary</b> current in kyoungbu high-speed line and describe its utilizing technology in the experimental results of <b>catenary</b> current. In order to analyze field testing results, the current ratio between contact and <b>catenary</b> current have been analyzed by means of Carson-Pollaczek equation. And the current wave forms between <b>catenary</b> and contact wire are presented based on the simulation results...|$|R
2500|$|This {{hyperbolic}} cosine function describes {{the shape of}} a <b>catenary.</b> A chain that supports only its own weight forms a catenary; the chain is purely in tension. Likewise, an inverted <b>catenary</b> arch that supports only its own weight is purely in compression, with no shear. The <b>catenary</b> arch is the stablest of all arches since [...] "the thrust passes down through the legs and is absorbed in the foundations, whereas in other arches, the pressure tends to force the legs apart." [...] The Gateway Arch itself is not a common <b>catenary,</b> but a more general curve of the form y=Acosh (Bx). This makes it an inverted weighted <b>catenary.</b> Saarinen chose a weighted <b>catenary</b> over a normal <b>catenary</b> curve because it looked less pointed and less steep. In 1959, he caused some confusion about the actual shape of the arch when he wrote, [...] "This arch is not a true parabola, as is often stated. Instead it is a <b>catenary</b> curve—the curve of a hanging chain—a curve in which the forces of thrust are continuously kept within the center of the legs of the arch." [...] William V. Thayer, a professor of mathematics at St. Louis Community College, later wrote to the St. Louis Post-Dispatch calling {{attention to the fact that}} the structure was a weighted <b>catenary.</b>|$|R
40|$|With {{the rapid}} {{development}} of computer vision, techniques of machine vision and visual inspection {{have been applied}} into the inspection of <b>catenary</b> on high-speed railways. Visual inspection systems have been developed and super-high-resolution images are captured to check the status of <b>catenary</b> components. Automatic recognition of defects becomes very important since {{the number of images}} is too huge to be manually checked one by one. However, it is not easy for the development of recognition algorithms on <b>catenary</b> components. There are many types of defects to be checked on different kinds of <b>catenary</b> components, but the number of defect images is too small in real world. In this paper, a solution was proposed and implemented. An on-site data acquisition system was designed and developed, and different types of defects were manually made on different <b>catenary</b> components beforehand. Finally, a visual inspection database was successfully constructed, including plenty of different kinds of <b>catenary</b> components, different types of defects, in different inspection conditions. The visual inspection database will be of great use in the development and test of recognition algorithms for <b>catenary...</b>|$|R
