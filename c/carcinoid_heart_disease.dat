40|$|<b>Carcinoid</b> <b>heart</b> <b>disease</b> (CHD) {{is a rare}} form of valvular {{heart disease}} {{characterized}} by right-sided heart valve dysfunction. <b>Carcinoid</b> <b>heart</b> <b>disease</b> occurs most frequently when carcinoid tumour cells metastasize from a primary site in the gut to the liver, so that vasoactive substances produced by the tumour are able to reach the systemic circulation. By contrast, in ovarian carcinoid tumours <b>carcinoid</b> <b>heart</b> <b>disease</b> develops {{in the absence of}} liver metastasis, because vasoactive substances can be released directly into the systemic circulation, bypassing the first-pass metabolism of the liver.

40|$|AbstractObjectives. To {{study the}} {{applicability}} of a newly developed echocardiographic scoring system {{in the assessment of}} <b>carcinoid</b> valvular <b>heart</b> <b>disease.</b> Background. We investigated prospectively the development, progression and regression of <b>carcinoid</b> valvular <b>heart</b> <b>disease</b> in patients with carcinoid syndrome by serial echocardiography, correlating these features with urinary 5 -HIAA levels and clinical data collected during therapy with somatostatin analog. Methods. Twenty-three patients with carcinoid syndrome underwent serial echocardiographic examinations. An echocardiographic <b>carcinoid</b> valvular <b>heart</b> <b>disease</b> (CVHD) % score was determined from points assigned for tricuspid and pulmonary valve structure and function. Results. Fifteen patients had no CVHD at study entry (group 1), while 8 patients had findings of CVHD (group 2). Five patients in group 1 developed new CVHD (1 B), while one demonstrated progression of CVHD (2 B). The remaining patients did not develop (1 A) or had no progression of CVHD (2 B). Despite major declines in 5 -HIAA levels during therapy in most patients, CVHD did not regress. There were significantly lower levels of median baseline 5 -HIAA (98. 8 vs. 256 mg/ 24 h), posttreatment 5 -HIAA (50. 3 vs. 324 mg/ 24 h) and posttreatment 5 -HIAA time integral (37. 3 vs. 192 g/ 24 h∗ days) in group A vs. B (p < 0. 05). However, only posttreatment 5 -HIAA levels independently predicted the development or progression of CVHD by multiple step-wise regression analysis (p < 0. 005), with a threshold observed in the 100 mg/ 24 h range. Conclusions. We designed a new echocardiographic scoring system to evaluate CVHD. Correlating echocardiographic scores with biochemical and clinical markers showed that only posttreatment 5 -HIAA levels independently predicted the development or progression of CVHD. This study strengthens the association between serotonin secretion and CVHD, as well as introducing a new technique for serial follow-up of these patients...|$|R

40|$|In {{the last}} decade, <b>heart</b> <b>disease</b> {{has been the}} leading cause of death all over the world. However, it is among the most {{preventable}} and controllable diseases. The World Health Organization reported that early detection of <b>heart</b> <b>disease</b> reduces progression to severe and costly illness and complications. Early detection of <b>heart</b> <b>disease</b> patients helps in recovering the patientsâ health and decreasing the mortality rate from <b>heart</b> <b>disease.</b> Although <b>heart</b> <b>disease</b> can be detected by several tests, such as electrocardiogram, stress tests, and cardiac angiogram, these tests are expensive and cannot be used as community-level screening tests. The Framingham <b>Heart</b> <b>Disease</b> Risk Evaluation Tool and the Australian Absolute Cardiovascular Risk Calculator are two common <b>heart</b> <b>disease</b> risk evaluation screening tests. However, both tests need prior blood sample investigations, an invasive and relatively costly process, which reduces their usability in other than medical settings. Motivated by the increasing mortality rates of <b>heart</b> <b>disease</b> patients, researchers have been applying different data mining techniques in the diagnosis of <b>heart</b> <b>disease.</b> Research finds that the same data mining technique shows different results across different <b>heart</b> <b>disease</b> datasets indicating that there can be significant attributes for <b>heart</b> <b>disease</b> diagnosis.

40|$|PURPOSE: Metastatic neuroendocrine tumors secrete {{serotonin}} {{and other}} vasoactive substances {{that are responsible}} for carcinoid syndrome and <b>carcinoid</b> <b>heart</b> <b>disease.</b> We sought to evaluate the discriminatory utility of diagnostic biomarkers in determining the presence and severity of <b>carcinoid</b> <b>heart</b> <b>disease</b> in patients with metastatic neuroendocrine tumors. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A cross-sectional study of patients with neuroendocrine tumors with documented liver metastases and/or carcinoid syndrome between April 2009 -October 2012 in 5 tertiary referral centers. Serum was analyzed for Chromogranin A, Chromogranin B and N-terminal pro Brain Natriuretic Peptide (NT-proBNP). Plasma was analyzed for Neurokinin A and 5 -Hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5 HIAA). Echocardiography was used to determine the presence and severity of <b>carcinoid</b> <b>heart</b> <b>disease.</b> Non-parametric receiver operating characteristic curves were constructed for biomarkers, and the area under the curve determined. The severity of cardiac involvement was correlated with the concentration of each biomarker. RESULTS: A total of 187 patients were identified of whom 37 (20 %) had <b>carcinoid</b> <b>heart</b> <b>disease.</b> Significantly higher median values of all biomarkers were found in the patients with cardiac involvement. NT-proBNP and plasma 5 HIAA had the highest areas under the curve for the prediction of <b>carcinoid</b> <b>heart</b> <b>disease</b> [NT-proBNP 0. 82 (95 % confidence interval 0. 74 - 0. 90, p< 0. 0001) and 5 HIAA 0. 85 (95 % confidence interval 0. 78 - 0. 92, p< 0. 0001].

40|$|AbstractObjectives. The {{hypothesis}} was that cardiac surgery for symptomatic <b>carcinoid</b> <b>heart</b> <b>disease</b> {{in conjunction with}} adjunctive therapy could improve the long-term outlook of patients with <b>carcinoid</b> <b>heart</b> <b>disease.</b> Background. Patients with <b>carcinoid</b> <b>heart</b> <b>disease</b> have a dismal prognosis; most die of progressive right heart failure within 1 year after onset of symptoms. Improved therapies for the systemic manifestations of the carcinoid syndrome have resulted in symptomatic improvement and prolonged survival in patients without heart disease. Methods. Twenty-six patients with symptomatic <b>carcinoid</b> <b>heart</b> <b>disease</b> underwent valvular surgery. Preoperative clinical, laboratory, Doppler echocardiographic and hemodynamic factors were evaluated. The survival of the surgical group was {{compared with that of}} a control group of 40 medically treated patients. Results. There were nine perioperative deaths (35 %), primarily from postoperative bleeding and right ventricular failure. Of the 17 surgical survivors, 8 were alive at a mean of 28 months of follow-up. The postoperative functional class of the eight surviving patients was substantially improved. Late deaths were primarily due to hepatic dysfunction caused by metastatic disease. The only predictor of operative mortality (p = 0. 03) was low voltage on preoperative electrocardiography (limb lead voltage ≤ 5 mm). Predictors of late survival included a lower preoperative somatostatin requirement and a lower preoperative urinary 5 -hydroxy-indoleacetic acid level. There was a trend toward increased survival for the surgical group compared with the control group. Conclusions. Because new therapies have improved survival in patients with the malignant carcinoid syndrome, cardiac involvement has become a major cause of morbidity and mortality. Valve surgery is the only definitive treatment. Although cardiac surgery carries a high perioperative mortality, marked symptomatic improvement occurs in survivors.

40|$|A 66 -year-old {{woman was}} {{diagnosed}} with hepatic metastasized carcinoid tumor of the ileocecal junction resulting in elevated plasma chromogranin A levels and urinary 5 -hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5 -HIAA) levels. Further examination showed right-sided heart failure with severe tricuspid valve regurgitation. Carcinoid tumors produce serotonin which leads to flushing, secretory diarrhea, bronchospasm and hypotension, known as carcinoid syndrome. Serotonin is metabolized to 5 -HIAA, which is inactive, in the liver and the lungs. However, hepatic metastases may result in direct exposure of the heart to serotonin, which induces plaque-like deformities on the tricuspid valve, and in turn induces valve regurgitation.
