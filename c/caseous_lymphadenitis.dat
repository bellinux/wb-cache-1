40|$|Trabalho completo: completo restrito, p. 86 – 91 Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis is the {{etiologic}} agent of <b>caseous</b> <b>lymphadenitis,</b> {{which is a}} serious, economically important problem for sheep production. We examined the seroprevalence of infection by C. pseudotuberculosis and possible risk factors associated with <b>caseous</b> <b>lymphadenitis</b> in sheep herds {{of the state of}} Minas Gerais, Brazil. Samples were collected from 642 sheep from 97 farms. Sera of all of the sheep were tested with ELISA for antibodies against C. pseudotuberculosis. A questionnaire was applied to gather data on the farm, the sheep herd, the farmer, and individual animal data (breed, sex and age). This is the first sero-epidemiological survey for <b>caseous</b> <b>lymphadenitis</b> in sheep herds in Minas Gerais. We found a high real prevalence, much higher than that suggested from information obtained with the questionnaire, which points to the scarcity of vaccination against <b>caseous</b> <b>lymphadenitis</b> in the sample evaluated. Only a small proportion of the farmers declared that cases of this disease were present in their flocks. The frequency of seropositive sheep varied significantly with breed (χ 2 test, P = 0. 021).

The prevalence of infection with C. pseudotuberculosis in sheep in the state of Minas Gerais was estimated to be 70. 9 % (95 % confidence interval (CI) : 64. 7 – 77. 0 %) and the prevalence of infected flocks being 95. 9 % (95 % CI: 89. 8 – 98. 9 %).

Imrnunoassays based on the detection of antibodies to a phospholipase D (PLD) exotoxin of Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis, the causative agent of <b>caseous</b> <b>lymphadenitis</b> (CLA), were investigated. A previously cloned recombinant form of PLD (Menzies et al., 1994) was expressed in E. coli, purified and subsequently used in an indirect ELISA and Biacore assay for the detection of antibodies to C. pseudotliberculosis in sheep serum samples. These assays were optimised using a variety of positive and negative controls and were then applied to a range of clinical samples from Irish herds. A previously isolated Am 1 -specific single chain variable fragment (scFv) was converted to a chimeric Fab format by the addition of human constant regions, using PCR assembly methods.

40|$|Several {{enzyme-linked}} immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) {{have been}} developed for the detection of antibodies to Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis, the causative agent of <b>caseous</b> <b>lymphadenitis</b> (CLA). However, none are commercially available in the UK. It was therefore necessary to develop a new, economic ELISA for use in a research project studying the epidemiology of CLA in UK sheep. The ELISA with its diagnostic qualities is presented. The ELISA was developed using sonicated C. pseudotuberculosis and optimised to detect total antibody or IgG class antibody in serum. Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves were obtained and the area under the ROC curve was used to compare the sensitivity and specificity of the two ELISAs. Both versions of the ELISA were evaluated on a panel of 150 positive reference sera and 103 negative reference sera. Using the test at 100...|$|E
40|$|A double {{antibody}} sandwich ELISA {{developed by}} ID-DLO, Lelystad to detect Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis infection was used on 329 sheep from four pedigree Suffolk flocks in which clinical cases of <b>caseous</b> <b>lymphadenitis</b> (CLA) had occurred. At subsequent necropsy, typical CLA lesions {{were seen in}} 133 sheep, and the diagnosis was confirmed on culture. Lesions were most commonly seen in lungs (n = 46), parotid lymph nodes (n = 44), prescapular lymph nodes (n = 38) and mediastinal lymph nodes (n = 31). The sensitivity of the ELISA test for detecting culture-positive sheep was 0. 88, while the specificity of the test was 0. 55. The antibody ELISA detected 87. 5 per cent of sheep that had CLA lesions restricted to internal organs only. It was concluded that the ELISA test has a valuable role in detecting sheep with both clinical and subclinical CLA...|$|E
