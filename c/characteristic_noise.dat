50|$|Other {{shortcomings}} of regenerative receivers are {{the presence of}} a <b>characteristic</b> <b>noise</b> (“mush”) in their audio output, and sensitive and unstable tuning. These problems have the same cause: a regenerative receiver’s gain is greatest when it operates on the verge of oscillation, and in that condition, the circuit behaves chaotically. Simple regenerative receivers lack an RF amplifier between the antenna and the regenerative detectors, so any change with the antenna swaying in the wind, etc. can change the frequency of the detector.|$|E

50|$|The main {{function}} of the Advanced National Seismic System (ANSS) and USArray, is to provide high quality data for earthquake monitoring, source studies and Earth structure research. The utility of seismic data is greatly increased when noise levels, unwanted vibrations, are reduced; however broadband seismograms will always contain {{a certain level of}} noise. The dominant sources of noise are either from the instrumentation itself or from ambient Earth vibrations. Normally, seismometer self noise will be well below the seismic noise level, and every station will have a <b>characteristic</b> <b>noise</b> pattern that can be calculated or observed. Sources of seismic noise within the Earth are caused by any of the following: the actions of human beings at or near the surface of the Earth, objects moved by wind with the movement being transferred to the ground, running water (river flow), surf, volcanic activity, or long period tilt due to thermal instabilities from poor station design.|$|E

5000|$|In his King's England series, Arthur Mee {{refers to}} Cawood as [...] "the Windsor of the North". It {{used to be}} the {{residence}} of the Archbishops of York. The name is believed to come from the <b>characteristic</b> <b>noise</b> made by crows in the nearby woods. Cawood is south of the point where the River Wharfe flows into the River Ouse which subsequently forms the northern border of the village. Cawood Bridge is the only bridge from the village which spans the river. The bridge was opened in 1872: before then the only means of crossing was by use of a ferry. Dick Turpin is said to have forded the river when he escaped to York, which lies ten miles north of Cawood. The River Ouse used to flood the village regularly in winter. Since the floods of January 1982, whose height is marked on the bridgekeeper's cottage, river defences have been raised so that the fields on the northern side (Kelfield Ings) and the former Ferry Boat Inn, also on the Kelfield side, are now the only areas that flood, even at times of exceptionally high waters, such as in November 2000.|$|E

40|$|An {{electrochemically}} integrated multi-electrode array {{namely the}} wire beam electrode (WBE) and noise signatures analysis {{have been applied}} in novel combinations to study crevice corrosion behaviour {{in the presence of}} pits. Characteristic electrochemical noise signatures were found to correlate with characteristic changes in WBE current distribution maps, which indicate corrosion rates distributions, corrosion patterns and the degree of pitting and crevice corrosion. Specifically, two <b>characteristic</b> <b>noise</b> patterns were observed: (i) the <b>characteristic</b> <b>noise</b> pattern of quick potential changes towards more negative direction with no recovery (termed noise signature I) was found to correspond with the initiation and stabilization of the anode inside crevice; and (ii) the <b>characteristic</b> <b>noise</b> pattern of the cyclic potential oscillation at a constant frequency (termed noise signature II) was found to correspond with the stable anodic dissolution in the occluded cavity site in WBE current distribution maps.
