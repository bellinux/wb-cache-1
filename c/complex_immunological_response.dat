40|$|Introduction: Sepsis is a <b>complex</b> <b>immunological</b> <b>response</b> to {{infection}} characterized by early hyper-inflammation followed by severe and protracted immunosuppression, {{suggesting that a}} multi-marker approach has the greatest clinical utility for early detection, within a clinical environment focused on Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (SIRS) differentiation. Pre-clinical research using an equine sepsis model identified a panel of gene expression biomarkers that define the early aberrant immune activation. Thus, the primary objective was to apply these gene expression biomarkers to distinguish patients with sepsis from those who had undergone major open surgery and had clinical outcomes consistent with systemic inflammation due to physical trauma and wound healing...|$|E
40|$|Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada (VKH) {{disease is}} a multisystem {{syndrome}} characterized by ocular (uveitis and retinal detachment), neurological (headache, tinnitus, and meningitis), and integumentary (vitiligo, alopecia, and poliosis) involvement. Although the pathogenesis of VKH disease is not well understood, an autoimmune T-cell response to a melanocyte-associated antigen {{is considered to be}} a cause of VKH disease. The <b>complex</b> <b>immunological</b> <b>response</b> to interferon and ribavirin may induce or exacerbate the autoimmune condition; however, VKH {{disease is a}} very rare complication associated with interferon therapy in chronic hepatitis C. We report a case of VKH disease occurring during pegylated interferon-α 2 b and ribavirin combination therapy for chronic hepatitis C...|$|E
40|$|Inflammation is {{a complex}} and highly {{organised}} immune response to microbes and tissue injury. Recognition of noxious stimuli by pathogen recognition receptor families including Toll-like receptors results in the expression of hundreds of genes that encode cytokines, chemokines, antimicrobials and regulators of inflammation. Regulation of TLR activation responses is controlled by TLR tolerance which induces a global change in the cellular transcriptional expression profile resulting in gene specific suppression and induction of transcription. In this thesis the plasticity of TLR receptor tolerance is investigated using an in vivo, transcriptomics and functional approach to determine the plasticity of TLR tolerance in the regulation of inflammation. Firstly, using mice deficient in the negative regulator of TLR gene transcription, Bcl- 3 (Bcl- 3 -/-) in a model of intestinal inflammation, we investigated the role of Bcl- 3 in the regulation of intestinal inflammatory responses. Our data revealed a novel role for Bcl- 3 in the regulation of epithelial cell proliferation and regeneration during intestinal inflammation. Furthermore this data revealed that increased Bcl- 3 expression contributes {{to the development of}} inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Secondly, we demonstrate that lipopolysaccharide tolerance is transient and recovery from LPS tolerance results in polarisation of macrophages to a previously un-described hybrid state (RM). In addition, we identified that RM cells have a unique transcriptional profile with suppression and induction of genes specific to this polarisation state. Furthermore, using a functional approach to characterise the outcomes of TLR tolerance plasticity, we demonstrate that cytokine transcription is uncoupled from cytokine secretion in macrophages following recovery from LPS tolerance. Here we demonstrate a novel mechanism of regulation of TLR tolerance through suppression of cytokine secretion in macrophages. We show that TNF-α is alternatively trafficked towards a degradative intracellular compartment. These studies demonstrate that TLR tolerance is a <b>complex</b> <b>immunological</b> <b>response</b> with the plasticity of this state playing {{an important role in the}} regulation of inflammation...|$|E

Most studies have used a basic bivariate statistical analysis to assess <b>complex</b> <b>immunological</b> <b>responses</b> in patients with this disorder, hence a more sophisticated multivariate statistical approach might be warranted. Our objective {{was to assess the}} association and correlation between the pro- and anti-inflammatory responses in a cohort of patients with chronic subdural hematoma (n= 57) using an exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis. Thirteen assigned pro-inflammatory (TNF-α, IL- 1 β, IL- 2, IL- 2 R, IL- 6, IL- 7, IL- 12, IL- 15, IL- 17, CCL 2, CXCL 8, CXCL 9 and CXCL 10) and five assigned anti-inflammatory (IL- 1 RA, IL- 4, IL- 5, IL- 10 and IL- 13) cytokines from blood and hematoma fluid samples were examined. Exploratory factor analysis indicated two major underlying immunological processes expressed by the cytokines in both blood and hematoma fluid, but with a different pattern and particularly regarding the cytokines IL- 13, IL- 6, IL- 4 and TNF-α. Scores from confirmatory factor analysis models exhibited a higher correlation between pro- and anti-inflammatory activities in blood (r= 0. 98) than in hematoma fluid samples (r= 0. 92). However, correlations of inflammatory processes between blood and hematoma fluid samples were lower and non-significant. A structural equation model showed a significant association between increased anti-inflammatory activity in hematoma fluid samples and a lower risk of recurrence, but this relationship was not statistically significant in venous blood samples. Moreover, these findings indicate that anti-inflammatory activities in the hematoma {{may play a role in}} the risk of a recurrence of CSDH...|$|R
40|$|Intraperitoneal {{proliferation}} of the metacestode stage of Echinococcus multilocularis in experimentally infected mice {{is followed by}} an impaired host immune response favoring parasite survival. We here demonstrate that infection in chronically infected mice {{was associated with a}} 3 -fold increase of the percentages of CD 4 + and CD 8 + peritoneal T (pT) cells compared to uninfected controls. pT cells of infected mice expressed high levels of IL- 4 mRNA, while only low amounts of IFN-gamma mRNA were detected, suggesting that a Th 2 -biased immune response predominated the late stage of disease. Peritoneal dendritic cells from infected mice (AE-pDCs) expressed high levels of TGF-beta mRNA and very low levels of IL- 10 and IL- 12 (p 40) mRNA, and the expression of surface markers for DC-maturation such as MHC class II (Ia) molecules, CD 80, CD 86 and CD 40 was down-regulated. In contrast to pDCs from non-infected mice, AE-pDCs did not enhance Concanavalin A (ConA) -induced proliferation when added to CD 4 + pT and CD 8 + pT cells of infected and non-infected mice, respectively. In addition, {{in the presence of a}} constant number of pDCs from non-infected mice, the {{proliferation of}} CD 4 + pT cells obtained from infected animals to stimulation with ConA was lower when compared to the responses of CD 4 + pT cells obtained from non-infected mice. This indicated that regulatory T cells (Treg) may interfere in the <b>complex</b> <b>immunological</b> host <b>response</b> to infection. Indeed, a subpopulation of regulatory CD 4 + CD 25 + pT cells isolated from E. multilocularis-infected mice reduced ConA-driven proliferation of CD 4 + pT cells. The high expression levels of Foxp 3 mRNA by CD 4 + and CD 8 + pT cells suggested that subpopulations of regulatory CD 4 + Foxp 3 + and CD 8 + Foxp 3 + T cells were involved in modulating the immune responses within the peritoneal cavity of E. multilocularis-infected mice...|$|R

40|$|Allergic contact {{dermatitis}} is a <b>complex</b> syndrome representing <b>immunological</b> <b>responses</b> to cutaneous exposure to protein-reactive chemicals. Although many contact sensitizers directly can elicit this disorder, others (prohaptens) require activation. Knowledge regarding the activating mechanisms remains limited, but {{one possibility is}} metabolic activation by cytochrome P 450 (CYP) enzymes in the skin. We have, after quantitative reverse transcriptase-PCR studies of the CYP content in 18 human skin samples, developed an enriched skin-like recombinant human (rh) CYP cocktail using CYP 1 A 1, 1 B 1, 2 B 6, 2 E 1, and 3 A 5. To validate the rhCYP cocktail, a prohaptenic conjugated diene ((5 R) - 5 -isopropenyl- 2 -methyl- 1 -methylene- 2 -cyclohexene) was investigated using: the skin-like rhCYP cocktail, a liver-like rhCYP cocktail, single rhCYP enzymes, liver microsomes, keratinocytes, and a dendritic cell (DC) assay. The diene was activated to sensitizing epoxides in all non-cell-based incubations including the skin-like rhCYP cocktail. An exocyclic epoxide metabolite ((7 R) - 7 -isopropenyl- 4 -methyl- 1 -oxaspiro[2. 5]oct- 4 -ene) {{was found to be}} mainly responsible for the allergenic activity of the diene. This epoxide also induced pronounced DC activation indicated by upregulation of IL- 8. The skin-like rhCYP cocktail provides a simplified alternative to using skin tissue preparations in mechanistic studies of CYP-mediated skin metabolism of prohaptens and offers the future possibility of designing in vitro predictive assays for assessment of allergenic activity of prohaptens...|$|R

40|$|This study evaluates clinical, virological and <b>immunological</b> <b>responses</b> to {{antiretroviral}} (ARV) therapy {{based on}} Lopinavir/ritonovir (LPV/r) in previously protease -inhibitor-experienced children. The study included 29 Brazilian children (median age = 5. 91 years) who had failed previous ARV therapy and had begun a regimen based on LPV/r. At 12 months follow-up, a good virological response to LPV/r therapy {{was defined as}} achieving an undetectable viral load or as a decrease in plasma HIV RNA levels to > 1 log. A good <b>immunological</b> <b>response</b> was defined as an increase in CD 4 + cell count from baseline sufficient to attain a better CDC immune stage classification. The number of infectious episodes 12 months before and 12 months after beginning LPV/r was assessed. Sixteen (55. 2 %) and 19 (65. 5 %) of 29 patients exhibited good virological and <b>immunological</b> <b>responses,</b> respectively. Baseline CD 4 + values (> 500) predicted both virological and <b>immunological</b> <b>responses</b> (p< 0. 05). Older children {{were less likely to}} develop an <b>immunological</b> <b>response</b> (p< 0. 001) than younger children. Nine children receiving 3 ARV drugs plus LPV/r showed an <b>immunological</b> <b>response</b> (100 %) compared to 10 / 20 (50 %) children receiving 2 drugs plus LPV/r (p= 0. 01). A lower number (n< 5) of infectious episodes was noted after 12 months follow-up in children using the LPV/r regimen (p= 0. 006). There was a positive correlation between children whose baseline CD 4 + values were greater than 500 cells/mm³ and virological responses. Although virological responses to therapy were seen in about half the children (55. 2 %), the use of HAART containing LPV/r provided clinical and immmunological benefits.

40|$|Background: Transient {{episodes of}} HIV type- 1 {{viraemia}} are frequently observed in patients on suppressive combination antiretroviral therapy (cART). We studied {{the effect of}} such episodes and of treatment interruptions on clinical outcome and <b>immunological</b> <b>response.</b> Methods: A total of 3, 321 patients from the ATHENA cohort had virological suppression (HIV type- 1 RNA 400 copies/ml) viraemia and the outcomes death, AIDS or <b>immunological</b> <b>response</b> (CD 4 (+) T-cell count increase >= 50 % from 24 weeks) was studied with Poisson regression models, including either time-updated cumulative follow-up, time spent per type of episode or modelling episodes as binary status indicators. Results: During 11, 165 person-years of follow-up, 88 patients died, 111 developed AIDS and 2, 019 had an <b>immunological</b> <b>response.</b> Longer follow-up time in treatment interruptions increased the risk of AIDS (relative risk [RR] 8. 07, 95 % confidence interval [CI] 3. 98 - 16. 4 per year longer) and impaired <b>immunological</b> <b>response</b> (RR 0. 22, 95 %) CI 0. 12 - 0. 41). High-level viraemia was only associated with <b>immunological</b> <b>response</b> (RR 0. 55, 95 % CI 0. 40 - 0. 74), whereas low-level viraemia {{was not associated with}} any of the three outcomes. Status indicator models gave similar results. When also including time-updated CD 4 (+) T-cell counts, the observed associations diminished. Conclusions: Treatment interruptions and high-level, but not low-level, viraemia are strongly associated with clinical outcome, mainly via their effect on CD 4 (+) T-cell count...|$|R
