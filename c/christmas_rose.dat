60|$|After the cyclamens the <b>Christmas</b> <b>roses</b> are in bud. It is at {{this season}} that the cacchi are ripe on {{the trees in the}} garden, whole naked trees full of lustrous, orange-yellow, paradisal fruit, gleaming against the wintry blue sky. The monthly roses still blossom frail and pink, there are still crimson and yellow roses. But the vines are bare and the lemon-houses shut. And then, mid-winter, the lowest buds of the <b>Christmas</b> <b>roses</b> appear under the hedges and rocks and by the streams. They are very lovely, these first large, cold, pure buds, like violets, like magnolias, but cold, lit up with the light from the snow.|$|R

60|$|We {{were all}} going to the party at Highclose. I {{happened}} to go into the kitchen about half past seven. The lamp was turned low, and Rebecca sat in the shadows.

60|$|Meanwhile, the <b>Christmas</b> <b>roses</b> become many. They {{rise from}} their budded, intact humbleness near the ground, they rise up, they throw up their crystal, they become handsome, they are heaps of confident, mysterious {{whiteness}} {{in the shadow}} of a rocky stream. It is almost uncanny to see them. They are the flowers of darkness, white and wonderful beyond belief.|$|R
50|$|The {{so-called}} <b>Christmas</b> <b>rose</b> (H. niger), {{a traditional}} cottage garden favourite, bears its pure white flowers (which often age to pink) {{in the depths}} of winter; large-flowered cultivars are available, as are pink-flowered and double-flowered selections.|$|E

60|$|Looking up, out of {{the heavy}} shadow that lay in the cleft, I could see, right in the sky, grey rocks shining transcendent in the pure empyrean. 'Are they so far up?' I thought. I did not dare to say, 'Am I so far down?' But I was uneasy. Nevertheless {{it was a lovely}} place, in the cold shadow, complete; when one forgot the shining rocks far above, it was a complete, shadowless world of shadow. Primroses were {{everywhere}} in nests of pale bloom upon the dark, steep face of the cleft, and tongues of fern hanging out, and here and there under the rods and twigs of bushes were tufts of wrecked <b>Christmas</b> <b>roses,</b> nearly over, but still, in the coldest corners, the lovely buds like handfuls of snow. There had been such crowded sumptuous tufts of <b>Christmas</b> <b>roses</b> everywhere in the stream-gullies, during the shadow of winter, that these few remaining flowers were hardly noticeable.|$|R

60|$|To begin with, {{the place}} was spotlessly clean; the stove, highly polished, gave forth a {{pleasing}} warm glow, even whilst the window, slightly open, allowed a modicum of fresh air to enter the room. In a rough earthenware jug on the table stood a large bunch of <b>Christmas</b> <b>roses,</b> and to the educated nostril the slight scent of perfumes that hovered in the air was doubly pleasing after the fetid air of the narrow streets.|$|R

60|$|We {{went in to}} tea. The yellow shaded lamp shone softly {{over the}} table, where <b>Christmas</b> <b>roses</b> spread wide open among some dark-{{coloured}} leaves; where the china and silver and the coloured dishes shone delightfully.
