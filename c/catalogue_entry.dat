25|$|A {{photograph}} of Metzinger's Le Fumeur {{published in a}} review of the 1914 Salon des Indépendants has confirmed that this painting was indeed exhibited at this Salon. Because of the vagueness of Metzinger's <b>catalogue</b> <b>entry</b> titles, and due to the multiple paintings by the artist showing models smoking pipes or cigarettes, it had been hitherto unknown precisely which of his works had been exhibited at the 1914 Indépendants. Moser, for example, writes in 1985 that a painting titled Le Fumeur (which could have been either Portrait de Max Jacob or Man with Pipe) was exhibited at the 1914 Salon des Indépendants (note 10, p.47).|$|E

[...] According to the <b>catalogue</b> <b>entry</b> for the hotpants at the Performing Arts Collection at the Arts Centre, Melbourne, British artist and photographer Katerina Jebb bought them for fifty pence from a flea market and they were only selected for use in the video the night before the shoot, though Minogue had worn them previously for a website photoshoot. She was surprised by the attention they attracted, commenting [...] "I never imagined what impact a 50p pair of hotpants would have." [...] She also said that the revealing nature of the hotpants made her feel insecure during the shooting, saying [...] "I actually wasn't confident , that's the crazy thing.

[...] The garment {{is often referred to as}} [...] "those hotpants," [...] and have become a symbol for the singer's vitality and youthfulness.

2500|$|Recent {{writers such}} as Nigel Morgan are {{confident}} that all the 13th century illustration was produced in London, although the earlier full-page miniatures are by an itinerant master, which is reflected in Deirdre Jackson's <b>catalogue</b> <b>entry</b> for the British Library's 2011/12 Royal Manuscripts exhibition. [...] However Janet Backhouse, then Curator of Illuminated Manuscripts at the British Library, described the prefatory miniatures as [...] "England, possibly St Albans or Winchester" [...] in a book of 1997, and the BL website used a similar formula in late 2011, though assigning the tinted drawings to [...] "Westminster".

2500|$|In June 2013, it was {{reported}} in the British press that a Scottish researcher, John Paul Floyd, claimed to have identified both the source of the [...] "Speculum" [...] and [...] "Tartar Relation" [...] manuscripts and the particular reproduction of the Andrea Bianco map which was used to create the Vinland Map. Mr. Floyd has found descriptive references in two pre-1957 Spanish publications to a 15th-century manuscript volume that is clearly identifiable as the Yale [...] "Speculum" [...] / [...] "Tartar Relation". The book features in an exhibition catalogue for the 1892-93 Exposición Histórico-Europea in Madrid, Spain (an official commemoration of Columbus, like its sister exhibition, the Exposición Histórico-Americana). According to the catalogue, the volume was one of many items contributed for display by the Archdiocese of Zaragoza. Spanish priest and scholar Cristóbal Pérez Pastor examined the codex, probably while it was on display in Madrid; his description was published posthumously in 1926. Significantly, neither the <b>catalogue</b> <b>entry</b> nor Pérez Pastor's description mentions the presence of a map. It is known that Enzo Ferrajoli, who offered the Vinland manuscript for sale in 1957, was convicted of having stolen manuscripts from the Cathedral Library of La Seo, Zaragoza, in the 1950s. Floyd has also identified details of the Vinland Map which match badly with the original 1436 Bianco map, but correspond more closely with an engraving based on the Bianco map which was printed in 1782.|$|E
