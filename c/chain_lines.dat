50|$|Rees's Cyclopædia {{was printed}} by Andrew Strahan, the King's Printer. It was entirely {{hand-set}} (there being no mechanical means of composition at this date) and printed. At {{the commencement of}} the work Strahan had nine wooden presses and over 20,000 kg of type. By 1809 this had risen to fifteen wooden presses and 36,000 kg of type. Since the Cyclopædia was produced serially, with a few sheets being printed each week, {{only a small part}} of Strahan's men and equipment would have ever been used on it at any one time. The work was printed on demy paper and folded to quarto format, with an uncropped size of 11 ¼ inches by 8 ¾ inches. A limited number were advertised in the prospectus as being produced on royal paper, which when folded gave a format of 12 ¼ inches by 10 inches. The paper is wove, with no <b>chain</b> <b>lines.</b> One watermark in the paper has been noted, with the legend W BALSTON, 1811. The supplier has not been identified, but it may be significant that a J. Dickinson was a member of the publishing syndicate.|$|E
40|$|Watermarks and <b>chain</b> <b>lines</b> are paper {{features}} {{that are used to}} prove the authenticity of etchings. If an artist has printed etchings on paper with the same paper features, then he has used this paper probably in the same period. The aim of the Rembrandtproject is to find automatically paper with similar watermarks and <b>chain</b> <b>lines</b> in a large database. Watermarks and <b>chain</b> <b>lines</b> are made visible by means of X-ray technique. For matching the line patterns among others, they should be extracted from the noisy X-ray images. This paper investigates two line detection filters: an Extended Kuwahara Filter and a Template-Based Filter. These filters are based on a circular analysis for each pixel. To assess the quality of the filters a set of model images with artificial noise is used. Because of a better performance with tracings it is useful to extract the line patterns from X-ray images and to use these patterns for the matching procedure. The aim of the Rembrandt-project is to extract watermarks and <b>chain</b> <b>lines</b> and to search in a large database for papers with similar watermarks and <b>chain</b> <b>lines.</b> To extract these patterns, line detection methods are applied. Because of the absence of a ‘ground truth ’ watermark, synthetic line images are generated to evaluate the quality of the line detection filters automatically.
