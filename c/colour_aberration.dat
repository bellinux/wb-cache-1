Figure  6 b shows significant decrease in the <b>colour</b> <b>aberration</b> of the samples with modified nano-TiO 2. This is due to lower degradation occurred in the polyester/nano-TiO 2 composites. In this case, the nano-TiO 2 {{plays a role in}} shielding UV radiation by absorption and scattering. After 1500 -h ageing, the ΔE of the sample modified with 2.0  wt.% nano-TiO 2 is 2.15, with reduction of 27.6 % compared to a 2.97 ΔE of the sample without nano-TiO 2. Coinciding with the results of gloss retention, the <b>colour</b> <b>aberration</b> of the sample decreases with the concentration of nano-TiO 2.|$|E

Incidental {{observations}} of albinism and melanism in common and grey seals are known from countries surrounding the North Sea. However, observations on <b>colour</b> <b>aberrations</b> have not been systematically recorded. To obtain the frequency of occurrence of these <b>colour</b> <b>aberrations,</b> we analysed data of all seals admitted to our centre over the past 38 years. In the period 1971 - 2008, 3000 common seals (Phoca vitulina) were rehabilitated, as well as 1200 grey seals (Halichoerus grypus). A total of five albinistic common seals and four melanistic grey seals were identified. This results in an estimated incidence of albinism in common seals of approximately 1 / 600, and of melanism in grey seals of approximately 1 / 300. The seals displayed normal behaviour, although in the albinistic animals, a photophobic reaction was observed in daylight. (C) Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden, 2010...|$|R

30|$|The nano-TiO 2 was {{modified}} with aluminate coupling agent by a dry coating method. The FT-IR, contact angle and DLS measurements demonstrated a linkage of organic functional groups to the nano-TiO 2, resulting in improved agglomeration resistance. Then, the modified nano-TiO 2 was {{employed as a}} functional additive to prepare the polyester/nano-TiO 2 composites by melt-blend extrusion method. With a real-time FT-IR study, the nano-TiO 2 exhibited a promoting effect on the crosslinking reaction of polyester with TGIC. Furthermore, the gloss retention, <b>colour</b> <b>aberration</b> and the surface morphologies of the composites during an accelerated UV ageing were investigated. The {{results indicated that the}} nanocomposites exhibited much less degree of ageing degradation, due to a strong UV shielding ability of the nano-TiO 2. Particularly, the polyester/nano-TiO 2 presented an improvement of 42.5 % in the gloss retention and a reduction of 27.6 % in the <b>colour</b> <b>aberration</b> after 1500  h UV ageing. This work proposed a dry modification method for the nano-TiO 2 and its application as functional nanoscale additive, which are highly available for the widespread applications of polyester resin/TiO 2 composites, and would provide considerable insights into the protection of natural and synthetic carbohydrate polymers from the UV irradiation.|$|E

Its coat colour varies geographically, becoming reddish in southern India (Menon 2003). Further, he {{has stated that}} in mammals, the coat colour changes to certain extent due to surrounding environment and ecological conditions and also due to age, sex, nutritional and health status. Menon (2003) has {{also pointed out that}} mammals show individual coat or pelage differences and this is particularly so in the case of genetic <b>colour</b> <b>aberrations</b> such as albinism and melanism. Albinism is characterized by absence of melanin pigment resulting in the total white body with pink limbs, snout and ears. Eyes appear red due to blood capillaries visible through colourless tissue.

40|$|Autonomous navigation, e. g., for mobile robots and vehicle driver assistance, rely on {{intelligent}} {{processing of}} data acquired from different resources such as sensor networks, laser scanners, and video cameras. Due to its low cost and easy installation, video cameras are the most feasible. Thus, {{there is a need}} for robust computer vision algorithms for autonomous navigation. This dissertation investigates the use of multiresolution image analysis and proposes a framework for autonomous navigation. Multiresolution image representation is achieved via complex wavelet transform to benefit from its limited data redundancy, approximately shift invariance and improved directionality. Image enhancement is developed to enhance image features for navigation and other applications. The colour constancy is developed to correct <b>colour</b> <b>aberrations</b> to utilize <b>colour</b> information as a robust feature to identify drivable regions. A novel algorithm which combines multiscale edge information with contextual information through colour similarity is developed for unsupervised image segmentation. The texture analysis is accomplished through a novel multiresolution texture classifier. Each component of the framework is initially evaluated independent of the other components and on various and more general applications. The framework as a whole is applied for drivable region identification and obstacle detection. The drivable regions are identified using the colour information. The obstacle is defined as vehicles on a road and other objects which cannot be part of a road. Multiresolution texture classifier and machine learning algorithms are applied to learn the appearance of vehicles for the purpose of vehicle detection.

30|$|This study {{investigated}} ageing-resistant properties of carboxyl-terminated polyester (polyethylene glycol terephthalate) composites modified with nanoscale titanium dioxide particles (nano-TiO 2). The nano-TiO 2 was pretreated by a dry coating method, with aluminate coupling agent as a functional grafting additive. The agglomeration resistance was evaluated, which exhibited significant improvement for the modified nanoparticles. Then, {{the effects of}} the modified nano-TiO 2 on the crosslinking and ageing-resistant properties of the composites were studied. With a real-time Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) measurement, the nano-TiO 2 displayed promoting effect on the crosslinking of polyester resin with triglycidyl isocyanurate (TGIC) as crosslinking agent. Moreover, the gloss retention, <b>colour</b> <b>aberration</b> and the surface morphologies of the composites during accelerated UV ageing (1500  hours) were investigated. The results demonstrated much less degree of ageing degradation for the nanocomposites, indicating an important role of the nano-TiO 2 in improving the ageing-resistant properties of synthetic polymer composites.|$|E
40|$|Isabellinism {{is a form}} of pigment {{dilution}} {{caused by}} a genetic mutation that results in a reduction in the concentration of eumelanin, the pigment responsible for black, grey and dark brown feathers in birds (Van Grouw 2006). It results in a uniform lightening of dark colouration, which appears greyish-yellow or pale brown (Everitt & Miskelly 2003, Voisin et al. 2002). This <b>colour</b> <b>aberration</b> has sometimes been used interchangeably with leucism, even though it differs from leucism, which is the total lack of eumelanin and phaeomelanin in feathers (Van Grouw 2006).

40|$|Albinism {{has been}} {{recorded}} in many vertebrate taxa (Halls 2004). It is a genetic anomaly in which an autosomal recessive gene causes an absence of the enzyme tyrosinase, {{resulting in a total}} lack of melanin pigment in the skin, scales, hairs, feathers and eyes (van Grouw 2006). The skin and eye colour of albinos is pink because the blood can be seen through the transparent, unpigmented tissues. In birds, it is the most frequently reported <b>colour</b> <b>aberration,</b> although it is the least frequent in occurrence. This is because it is commonly mistaken for the most frequently inheritable aberration in birds, leucism, which is a partial or total lack of melanin in the plumage (sometimes also in the skin) —but not in the eye—due to an inherited disorder of the deposition of these pigments (van Grouw 2006). There are at least 10 other types of inheritable colour aberrations in birds. Albinistic birds are almost never observed, not only because albinism is rare, but also because albinos have low survival rates (van Grou...|$|E

5000|$|Isaac Newton {{built his}} {{reflecting}} telescope as a proof for his theory that white light {{is composed of}} a spectrum of colours. He had concluded that the lens of any refracting telescope would suffer from the dispersion of light into <b>colours</b> (chromatic <b>aberration).</b> The telescope he constructed used mirrors as the objective which bypass that problem. To create the primary mirror Newton used a custom composition of metal consisting of six parts copper to two parts tin, an early composition of speculum metal. He devised means for shaping and grinding the mirror {{and may have been}} the first to use a pitch lap to polish the optical surface. He chose a spherical shape for his mirror instead of a parabola to simplify construction: he had satisfied himself that the chromatic, and not the spherical aberration, formed the chief faults of refracting telescopes. He added to his reflector what is the hallmark of the design of a [...] "Newtonian telescope", a secondary [...] "diagonal" [...] mirror near the primary mirror's focus to reflect the image at 90° angle to an eyepiece mounted {{on the side of the}} telescope. This unique addition allowed the image to be viewed with minimal obstruction of the objective mirror. He also made all the tube, mount, and fittings.|$|R
5|$|From this work, he {{concluded}} that the lens of any refracting telescope would suffer from the dispersion of light into <b>colours</b> (chromatic <b>aberration).</b> As a proof of the concept, he constructed a telescope using reflective mirrors instead of lenses as the objective to bypass that problem. Building the design, the first known functional reflecting telescope, today known as a Newtonian telescope, involved solving the problem of a suitable mirror material and shaping technique. Newton ground his own mirrors out of a custom composition of highly reflective speculum metal, using Newton's rings to judge {{the quality of the}} optics for his telescopes. In late 1668 he was able to produce this first reflecting telescope. It was about eight inches long and it gave a clearer and larger image. In 1671, the Royal Society asked for a demonstration of his reflecting telescope. Their interest encouraged him to publish his notes, Of Colours, which he later expanded into the work Opticks. When Robert Hooke criticised some of Newton's ideas, Newton was so offended that he withdrew from public debate. Newton and Hooke had brief exchanges in 1679–80, when Hooke, appointed to manage the Royal Society's correspondence, opened up a correspondence intended to elicit contributions from Newton to Royal Society transactions, which had the effect of stimulating Newton to work out a proof that the elliptical form of planetary orbits would result from a centripetal force inversely proportional to the square of the radius vector (see Newton's law of universal gravitation– History and De motu corporum in gyrum). But the two men remained generally on poor terms until Hooke's death.|$|R

Materials and methods: The human lung carcinoma cell line SW 1573 was irradiated at high dose-rate (HDR: 0. 8 Gy min(- 1)) or at pulsed low dose-rate (p-LDR: average dose-rate 1 Gy h(- 1)) with or without radiosensitization by bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU). Cell survival was determined by clonogenic assay. Chromosome <b>aberrations</b> (<b>colour</b> junctions) were measured by whole-chromosome FISH of chromosome 2 and 18 and were scored according to the PAINT method.

5000|$|Newton's {{idea for}} a {{reflecting}} telescope was not new. Galileo Galilei and Giovanni Francesco Sagredo had discussed using a mirror as the image forming objective soon after {{the invention of the}} refracting telescope, and others, such as Niccolò Zucchi, claimed to have experimented with the idea as far back as 1616. Newton may even have read James Gregory's 1663 book Optica Promota which described reflecting telescope designs using parabolic mirrors (a telescope Gregory had been trying unsuccessfully to build).Newton built his reflecting telescope because he suspected it could prove his theory that white light is composed of a spectrum of colours. <b>Colour</b> distortion (chromatic <b>aberration)</b> was the primary fault of refracting telescopes of Newton's day, and there were many theories as to what caused it. During the mid-1660s with his work on the theory of colour, Newton concluded this defect was caused by the lens of the refracting telescope behaving the same as prisms he was experimenting with, breaking white light into a rainbow of colours around bright astronomical objects. If this were true, then chromatic aberration could be eliminated by building a telescope which did not use a lens [...] - [...] a reflecting telescope.|$|R
5000|$|Teän was {{the site}} of ground {{breaking}} mark and re-capture population studies of the Common Blue (Polyommatus icarus) butterfly by entomologists E. B. Ford and Prof W. H. Dowdeswell who camped on the island from 26 August to 8 September 1938. They marked each insect with a dot of cellulose paint so {{that it was possible to}} tell the date of first capture and any subsequent recaptures. The Common Blue is not a migratory butterfly and no marked butterflies were captured on the west side of St Martin’s, so additions to the Teän population were likely to be mainly emergences and losses due to death. It was noted that the normal form of the butterfly was found on St Mary’s, Tresco and St Martin’s whilst on Teän there is a separate race, due to isolation. Ford described them as [...] "The females obtained in the summer (I have no knowledge of the spring form) have an extensive scattering of pale silvery-blue scales, so that they are most unlike those found elsewhere, which are neither blackish or else marked with a violet shade. Moreover, the form from Teän is associated with a characteristic variation on the under-side of the hind-wings, which affects both sexes; for in a large proportion of the specimens the two spots placed along the coastal margin are united, forming a short curved line, and other varieties in spotting are frequent. We seem to here a stage in the evolution of an independent sub-species". Recent visits have not found the Common Blue to be significantly different on Teän so Ford’s remarkable form no longer seems to exist; unusual female <b>colour</b> forms and <b>aberrations</b> may just occur more frequently on Scilly than elsewhere.|$|R
60|$|But the Leptalides are not {{the only}} insects who have {{prolonged}} their existence by imitating the great protected group of Heliconidæ;--a genus of quite another family of most lovely small American butterflies, the Erycinidæ, and three genera of diurnal moths, also present species which often mimic the same dominant forms, so that some, as Ithomia ilerdina of St. Paulo, for instance, have flying with them a few individuals of three widely different insects, which are yet disguised with exactly the same form, colour, and markings, so as to be quite undistinguishable when upon the wing. Again, the Heliconidæ {{are not the}} only group that are imitated, although they are the most frequent models. The black and red group of South American Papilios, and the handsome Erycinian genus Stalachtis, have also a few who copy them; but this fact offers no difficulty, since these two groups are almost as dominant as the Heliconidæ. They both fly very slowly, they are both conspicuously coloured, and they both abound in individuals; so that {{there is every reason to}} believe that they possess a protection of a similar kind to the Heliconidæ, and that it is therefore equally an advantage to other insects to be mistaken for them. There is also another extraordinary fact that we are not yet in a position clearly to comprehend: some groups of the Heliconidæ themselves mimic other groups. Species of Heliconia mimic Mechanitis, and every species of Napeogenes mimics some other Heliconideous butterfly. This would seem to indicate that the distasteful secretion is not produced alike by all members of the family, and that where it is deficient protective imitation comes into play. It is this, perhaps, that has caused such a general resemblance among the Heliconidæ, such a uniformity of type with great diversity of <b>colouring,</b> since any <b>aberration</b> causing an insect to cease to look like one of the family would inevitably lead to its being attacked, wounded, and exterminated, even although it was not eatable.|$|R
