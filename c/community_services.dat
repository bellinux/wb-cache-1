Effects increased when studies include more frequent reflection and <b>community</b> <b>service,</b> reflection on academic content, and older adolescents.

Among its 200-odd members today are luminaries of the Chinese business community such as the founder of the Overseas Union Bank, Lien Ying Chow, and United Overseas Bank chairman Wee Cho Yaw.

In response, Gillard and Minister for Families, Housing, <b>Community</b> <b>Services</b> and Indigenous Affairs Jenny Macklin argued that there was not enough support in the House of Representatives for Wilkie's preferred option for it to be passed, and that they had been advised it was technically unfeasible to implement mandatory commitment within the time frame he had specified.|$|E

5|$|Seeing {{that the}} Chinese {{military}} was weaker than the superior Japanese forces, Tan stepped up his anti-Japanese campaign. In 1936, he raised {{enough money for}} the Chinese Air Force to purchase 13 fighter planes. In 1937, the Chinese Relief Fund Committee was set up with Tan chosen by over 800 representatives of the Chinese community as its chairman. In response to the Japanese invasion of China in 1937, the China Salvation Movement was born, with its Southeast Asian headquarters located at the club until 1942, when the Japanese invaded Singapore. Tan fled to Indonesia {{just a few days}} before the fall of Singapore as he knew he would likely face persecution by the Japanese should he choose to remain.

5|$|The Lord Howe Island Board is a NSW Statutory Authority {{established}} {{under the}} Lord Howe Island Act 1953, {{to administer the}} island {{as part of the}} state of New South Wales. It reports directly to the state's Minister for Environment and Heritage, and is responsible for the care, control and management of the island. Its duties include: the protection of World Heritage values; the control of development; the administration of Crown Land, including the island's protected area; provision of <b>community</b> <b>services</b> and infrastructure; and regulating sustainable tourism. In 1981 the Lord Howe Island Amendment Act gave islanders the administrative power of three members on a five-member Board. The Board also manages the Lord Howe Island Kentia Palm Nursery which, together with tourism, provides the island's only sources of external income. Under an amendment bill in 2004 the Board now comprises seven members, four of whom are elected from the islander community, thus giving about 350 permanent residents a high level of autonomy. The remaining three members are appointed by the Minister to represent the interests of business, tourism and conservation. The full Board meets on the island every three months while the day-to-day affairs of the island are managed by the Board's administration, with a permanent staff that had increased to 22 people by 1988.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the <b>community</b> <b>service</b> requirement to determine what could be done to help improve the requirement. Many high schools have a <b>community</b> <b>service</b> requirement which tries to get their students connected to the community through organizations that offer volunteer opportunities or internships. Students have obstacles that make it difficult for them to complete the requirement and teachers are sometimes overwhelmed with curriculum and thus it becomes a difficult task in helping their students connect to <b>community</b> <b>service</b> opportunities. Teachers are looking for ways to help their students and students in turn try to understand the importance of the <b>community</b> <b>service</b> requirement. Most teachers and students do find the <b>community</b> <b>service</b> requirement to be rewarding to the school and community. This evaluative study was conducted at a comprehensive high school with approximately 70 A. V. I. D senior seminar students and six senior government teachers where every senior student is required to complete twenty hours of <b>community</b> <b>service</b> during their senior year in their senior government class. The senior government teachers are responsible for evaluating and connecting students to their <b>community</b> <b>service</b> requirement. The researcher provided the senior government teachers as well as the senior A. V. I. D students an online questionnaire addressing different aspects of the <b>community</b> <b>service</b> requirement. Student and teacher responses provided an opportunity to evaluate the <b>community</b> <b>service</b> requirement and how best to connect students to <b>community</b> <b>service</b> opportunities. This evaluative study helps identify methods of improvement and if the school has an A. V. I. D program, how the A. V. I.
