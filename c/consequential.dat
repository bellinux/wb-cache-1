5|$|The {{law does}} not leave the {{claimant}} without remedy by allowing him to recover the economic losses that are directly <b>consequential</b> upon physical damage.|$|E
5|$|The {{symptoms}} of decompression sickness {{are caused by}} damage from the formation and growth of bubbles of inert gas within the tissues and by blockage of arterial blood supply to tissues by gas bubbles and other emboli <b>consequential</b> to bubble formation and tissue damage.|$|E
5|$|Responsibilities and {{functions}} related to security includes patrolling, continual emergency availability, highway patrolling, sea patrolling, coordination of {{search and rescue}} activities, embassy security and as a body guard service {{for members of the}} government, the royal family and other in need. The crime fighting responsibility is split between preventative measures, such as information, observation and controls, and <b>consequential</b> measures, such as investigation and prosecution. The police further have duties related to civilian court cases, such as writ of execution, evaluation of natural damage, assisting the courts after bankruptcies and functioning as a notary public.|$|E
5|$|This {{series of}} events was <b>consequential</b> to the Indian {{independence}} movement. Though largely subdued {{by the end of}} World War I, it came to be a major factor in reforming the Raj's Indian policy. Similar efforts were made during World War II in Germany and in Japanese-controlled Southeast Asia, where Subhas Chandra Bose formed the Indische Legion and the Indian National Army respectively, and in Italy where Mohammad Iqbal Shedai formed the Battaglione Azad Hindoustan.|$|E
5|$|Wind shear is an {{important}} aspect of a squall line. In low to medium shear environments, mature thunderstorms will contribute modest amounts of downdrafts, enough to help create a leading edge lifting mechanism – the gust front. In high shear environments created by opposing low level jet winds and synoptic winds, updrafts and <b>consequential</b> downdrafts can be much more intense (common in supercell mesocyclones). The cold air outflow leaves the trailing area of the squall line to the mid-level jet, which aids in downdraft processes.|$|E
5|$|Of the six {{divisions}} encamped on {{the western}} side of the Tennessee River in early April, only Lew Wallace's 3rd Division was at Crump's Landing; the remainder were farther south (upriver) at Pittsburg Landing. Grant developed a reputation during the war for being more concerned with his own plans than with those of the enemy. His encampment at Pittsburg Landing displayed his most <b>consequential</b> lack of such concern—his army was spread out in bivouac style, with many of his men surrounding a small, log meetinghouse named Shiloh Church (Shiloh was a biblical city that served as the capital of the Kingdom of Israel), passing the time waiting for Buell's army with drills for his many raw troops without establishing entrenchments or other significant defensive measures.|$|E
5|$|Rh factor, {{also known}} as Rh D antigen, is an antigen found on red blood cells; {{individuals}} that are Rh-positive (Rh+) have this antigen on their red blood cells and individuals that are Rh-negative (Rh–) do not. During normal childbirth, delivery trauma or complications during pregnancy, blood from a fetus can enter the mother's system. In {{the case of an}} Rh-incompatible mother and child, <b>consequential</b> blood mixing may sensitize an Rh- mother to the Rh antigen on the blood cells of the Rh+ child, putting the remainder of the pregnancy, and any subsequent pregnancies, at risk for hemolytic disease of the newborn.|$|E
5|$|The Duma {{approved}} {{construction in}} May 1912, before the design was finalised, and allocated 45.5 million rubles for each ship. However, {{the increase in}} armaments and <b>consequential</b> increase {{in the size of}} the ships raised their estimated cost by seven million rubles each, and some money was diverted from the budget for the s. Orders were placed on 18 September 1912 for a pair of ships each from the New Admiralty Shipyard and the Baltic Works. The first pair was to be ready for trials on 14 July 1916 and the second pair on 14 September 1916.|$|E
5|$|The Wipeout {{games are}} {{a series of}} futuristic racers which involve players {{piloting}} anti-gravity ships through various forms of races. The series is known for its extreme speed, range of electronic dance music soundtracks, and <b>consequential</b> difficulty. Power-ups {{come in the form of}} offensive or defensive weaponry, ranging from machine guns, missiles, rockets, to energy shields, auto pilots, and mines. Power-ups are usually collected by flying over different coloured pads on race tracks. Speed boost pads also feature prominently on race tracks: once flown over, the player receives a short momentous boost. Every ship featured in a game is owned by a different racing corporation (collectively referred to as 'teams' in-game) although the number of teams and ships will vary throughout the games. Every ship has different characteristics, for example each ship will vary in handling, thrust, maximum speed and shield strength. Each ship is equipped with a compulsory shield which absorbs damage sustained during a race; energy is lost whenever the player's ship collides or is hit by weapons fire. If the shield runs out, the ship in question will explode and the player is consequently eliminated from the race.|$|E
5|$|The {{symptoms}} of decompression sickness {{are known to}} be caused by damage resulting from the formation and growth of bubbles of inert gas within the tissues and by blockage of arterial blood supply to tissues by gas bubbles and other emboli <b>consequential</b> to bubble formation and tissue damage. The precise mechanisms of bubble formation and the damage they cause {{has been the subject of}} medical research for a considerable time and several hypotheses have been advanced and tested. Tables and algorithms for predicting the outcome of decompression schedules for specified hyperbaric exposures have been proposed, tested, and used, and usually found to be of some use but not entirely reliable. Decompression remains a procedure with some risk, but this has been reduced and is generally considered to be acceptable for dives within the well-tested range of commercial, military and recreational diving.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{establishment}} of the Irish Free State in December 1922, Irish peers ceased to elect representatives, although those already elected were allowed to serve for life; the last of the temporal peers, The 4th Earl of Kilmorey (a peer from an Ulster family), died in 1961. Disputes then arose as to whether representative peers could still be elected. The Act establishing the Irish Free State was silent on the matter, although the Irish Free State (<b>Consequential</b> Provisions) Act 1922 had abolished the office of Lord Chancellor of Ireland, whose involvement was required in the election process; the office of Clerk of the Crown had also been abolished in Ireland. Various Irish peers petitioned the House of Lords for a restoration of their right to elect representatives. In 1962, the Joint Committee on House of Lords Reform rejected such plans. In the next year, when the Peerage Act 1963 (which, among other things, gave all peers in the Peerage of Scotland the right to sit in the House of Lords) was being considered, an amendment to similarly allow Irish peers to attend was defeated, ninety to eight. Instead, the new Act gave all Irish peers the right to stand for election to the House of Commons, and to vote at parliamentary elections.|$|E
5|$|In the Rogue Cut version, Rogue's role is more <b>consequential,</b> and the {{narrative}} is more complex: When seeing Stryker causes Wolverine's consciousness to phase {{between past and}} future—resulting in his claws being extended, injuring Kitty Pryde—the Professor talks {{about the need for}} Wolverine to have more time back in 1973. Bobby Drake (Iceman) proposes breaking into the heavily guarded remains of Cerebro at the Professor's school, the one place where the Professor's mind can't reach others from the outside, in order to rescue Rogue, who is being held captive there. With the Professor and Magneto, he does so—at the cost of his own life—and Rogue is taken to where the mutants are making their last stand, where she takes over for Kitty in regards to keeping Wolverine's mind in 1973, for the remaining time until the moment history is changed, with a suggestion that Wolverine is aware of the switch as he appears to feel Rogue's presence. The Sentinels were able to find the X-Men through a tracking device inside a Sentinel's hand, which got stuck in the X-Jet after the Sentinel tried to prevent the Professor, Magneto and Rogue from escaping the incinerated remains of the X-Mansion. It also includes a scene where Mystique visits the X-Mansion at night while Charles and Logan are sleeping. She revisits her previous romance with Beast but leaves very early the next morning and breaks Cerebro in order to prevent Charles from finding her.|$|E
5|$|The law {{of large}} numbers predicts that when the {{absolute}} number of copies of the allele is small (e.g., in small populations), the magnitude of drift on allele frequencies per generation is larger. The magnitude of drift {{is large enough to}} overwhelm selection at any allele frequency when the selection coefficient is less than 1 divided by the effective population size. Non-adaptive evolution resulting from the product of mutation and genetic drift is therefore considered to be a <b>consequential</b> mechanism of evolutionary change primarily within small, isolated populations. The mathematics of genetic drift depend on the effective population size, {{but it is not clear}} how this is related to the actual number of individuals in a population. Genetic linkage to other genes that are under selection can reduce the effective population size experienced by a neutral allele. With a higher recombination rate, linkage decreases and with it this local effect on effective population size. This effect is visible in molecular data as a correlation between local recombination rate and genetic diversity, and negative correlation between gene density and diversity at noncoding DNA regions. Stochasticity associated with linkage to other genes that are under selection is not the same as sampling error, and is sometimes known as genetic draft in order to distinguish it from genetic drift.|$|E
5|$|The second epoch saw the reigns of {{the last}} three legendary kings. The second epoch was more <b>consequential</b> than was the first, which was in part due to the {{significant}} degree of territorial expansion which occurred during this period. Regardless of how true these legends were, it is likely that, as the legends suggest, a series of conquests did occur during the late monarchy. As a result of these conquests, it became necessary to determine what was to be done with the conquered people. Often, individuals whose towns had been conquered remained in those towns, while other such individuals came to Rome. To acquire legal and economic standing, these newcomers adopted a condition of dependency toward either a Patrician family, or toward the king. Eventually, the individuals who were dependents of the king were released from their state of dependency, and became the first Plebeians. As Rome grew, it needed more soldiers to continue its conquests. When the Plebeians were released from their dependency, they were released from their Curia. When this occurred, while they were no longer required to serve in the army, they also lost their political and economic standing. To bring these new Plebeians back into the army, the Patricians were forced to make concessions. While it is not known exactly what concessions were made, {{the fact that they were}} not granted any political power set the stage for what history knows as the Conflict of the Orders.|$|E

25|$|The spherical {{harmonics}} have deep and <b>consequential</b> properties under {{the operations of}} spatial inversion (parity) and rotation.|$|E
25|$|Damages may be {{general or}} <b>consequential.</b> General damages are those damages which {{naturally}} flow from {{a breach of}} contract. <b>Consequential</b> damages are those damages which, although not naturally flowing from a breach, are naturally supposed by both parties {{at the time of}} contract formation. An example would be when someone rents a car to get to a business meeting, but when that person arrives to pick up the car, it is not there. General damages would be the cost of renting a different car. <b>Consequential</b> damages would be the lost business if that person was unable to get to the meeting, if both parties knew the reason the party was renting the car. However, there is still a duty to mitigate the losses. The fact that the car was not there does not give the party a right to not attempt to rent another car.|$|E
25|$|They {{are known}} for their <b>consequential</b> effects on {{agriculture}} due to infestation of plants, and efforts to control the pests have proved to be difficult.|$|E
25|$|Compensatory damages, {{which are}} given to the party which was detrimented by the breach of contract. With {{compensatory}} damages, there are two heads of loss, <b>consequential</b> damage and direct damage.|$|E
25|$|A <b>consequential</b> {{amendment}} was also made to Section 139A of the Education Act 1989 {{by removing the}} exemption of parents (who are not school staff) administering corporal punishment to their children at school.|$|E
25|$|Later, more <b>consequential</b> Supreme Court cases {{related to}} the {{politics}} of nuclear power include Metropolitan Edison Co. v. People Against Nuclear Energy (1983), decided the same year, and Silkwood v. Kerr-McGee Corp. (1984).|$|E
25|$|Although public {{response}} at the 1962 Motorcycle show remained encouraging, {{the changes}} to purchase tax meant there was now a much less significant price difference between the Minicar and other small cars and in November production was scaled back with <b>consequential</b> job losses.|$|E
25|$|There are {{a variety}} of tasks that psychologists use to measure spatial memory on adults, {{children}} and animal models. These tasks allow professionals to identify cognitive irregularities in adults and children and allows researchers to administer varying types of drugs and or lesions in participants and measure the <b>consequential</b> effects on spatial memory.|$|E
25|$|This {{enactment}} {{extends the}} legal capacity for marriage for civil purposes to same-sex couples {{in order to}} reflect values of tolerance, respect and equality, consistent with the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. It also makes <b>consequential</b> amendments to other Acts to ensure equal access for same-sex couples to the civil effects of marriage and divorce.|$|E
25|$|Take, for example, a {{computer}} virus {{that disrupts the}} {{distribution of natural gas}} across a region. This could lead to a <b>consequential</b> reduction in electrical power generation, which in turn leads to the forced shutdown of computerized controls and communications. Road traffic, air traffic, and rail transportation might then become affected. Emergency services might also be hampered.|$|E
25|$|The {{injury and}} then {{associated}} back problems recurred {{throughout his career}} (for example in the 1989 Tour Roche retired after banging the problem knee on his handlebars) {{and a series of}} operations appeared to only address direct or <b>consequential</b> symptoms of the core injury. Later non-surgical intervention under Dr.Hans-Wilhelm Müller-Wohlfahrt in Munich made some difference but the injury required constant care.|$|E
25|$|Mr Shaik {{applied for}} {{leave to appeal}} to the Constitutional Court in Johannesburg, against his {{conviction}} and sentence, and <b>consequential</b> steps. In October 2007 the Court dismissed most elements of the application, finding that most of the grounds for appeal submitted by Shaik had no prospect of success. However, it granted leave to appeal against the order for confiscation of his assets.|$|E
25|$|Following the Hatfield accident, {{the rail}} {{infrastructure}} company Railtrack imposed over 1,200 emergency speed restrictions across its network and instigated an extremely costly nationwide track replacement programme. The <b>consequential</b> severe operational disruption {{to the national}} network and the company's spiralling costs set in motion the series of events {{which resulted in the}} ultimate collapse of the company and its replacement with Network Rail, a state-owned, not-for-dividend company.|$|E
25|$|Water {{systems are}} {{affected}} by coal mining. For example, mining affects groundwater and water table levels and acidity. Spills of fly ash, such as the Kingston Fossil Plant coal fly ash slurry spill, can also contaminate land and waterways, and destroy homes. Power stations that burn coal also consume large quantities of water. This can affect the flows of rivers, and has <b>consequential</b> impacts on other land uses.|$|E
25|$|The {{average cost}} of a bTB {{breakdown}} in a cattle herd in England is approximately £30,000. About £20,000 of this is paid by the Government, primarily as compensation for animals compulsorily slaughtered and costs of testing. This leaves approximately £10,000 needing to be paid by farmers {{as a result of}} their <b>consequential</b> losses (loss of earnings e.g. milk sales of culled cows), on-farm costs of testing, and disruption to business through movement restrictions.|$|E
25|$|Airy {{retired in}} 1881, {{living with his}} two married daughters at Croom's Hill near Greenwich. In 1891, he {{suffered}} a fall and an internal injury. He survived the <b>consequential</b> surgery only a few days. His wealth at death was £27,713. Airy {{and his wife and}} three pre-deceased children are buried at St. Mary's Church in Playford, Suffolk. A cottage owned by Airy still stands, adjacent to the church and now in private hands.|$|E
25|$|For 1994, Senna {{was able}} to finally join the Williams team given the {{retirement}} of Prost and was reportedly paid a $20 million salary. With Prost's retirement {{at the end of}} 1993, and Williams's <b>consequential</b> lack of a defending World Champion carrying race number 1 for a second year running, Senna would race in 1994 with number 2 and teammate Damon Hill would race with number 0 {{for the second year in}} a row.|$|E
25|$|People's self-verification strivings {{are apt to}} be most {{influential}} when the relevant identities and behaviors matter to them. Thus, for example, the self-view should be firmly held, the relationship should be enduring, and the behavior itself should be <b>consequential.</b> When these conditions are not met, people will be relatively unconcerned with preserving their self-views and they will instead indulge their desire for self-enhancement. In addition, self-reported emotional reactions favor self-enhancement while more thoughtful processes favor self-verification.|$|E
25|$|In Western Europe, liberal {{parties have}} often cooperated with socialist and social {{democratic}} parties, {{as evidenced by}} the Purple Coalition in the Netherlands during the late 1990s and into the 21st century. The Purple Coalition, one of the most <b>consequential</b> in Dutch history, brought together the progressive left-liberal D66, the economic liberal and centre-right VVD, and the social democratic Labour Party – an unusual combination that ultimately legalised same-sex marriage, euthanasia, and prostitution while also instituting a non-enforcement policy on marijuana.|$|E
25|$|The key {{disadvantages}} {{include the}} relatively low rotational speed with the <b>consequential</b> higher torque and hence higher cost of the drive train, the inherently lower power coefficient, the 360-degree rotation of the aerofoil within the wind flow during each cycle and hence the highly dynamic loading on the blade, the pulsating torque generated by some rotor designs on the drive train, {{and the difficulty of}} modelling the wind flow accurately and hence the challenges of analysing and designing the rotor prior to fabricating a prototype.|$|E
25|$|Porsche AG {{announced}} on May 7, 2007 that the 911 Turbo Cabriolet {{would go on}} sale in September 2007. The Porsche 997 Turbo Cabriolet {{became one of the}} fastest convertible sports cars in production. It is capable of similar top speeds and acceleration to the standard Porsche 997 turbo coupé, a notable feat due to the typical problems associated with convertible variants of hardtop coupés, such as the poor aerodynamics of a soft top, a lack of torsional rigidity, and the <b>consequential</b> weight increase from structural members.|$|E
