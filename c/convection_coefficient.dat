A MOSIS fabricated micro hotplate is simulated using the CAD software CoventorWare. There are three different sized hotplates in one die; viz. small, medium and large.

On the basis of the results presented in this study, the steam chamber can heat reactors to temperature in a tenth of the time sand baths can, can maintain a more stable temperature during pretreatment, and has a <b>convection</b> <b>coefficient</b> one to two magnitudes greater than that of the sand bath.

40|$|As the {{consumer}} demand for smaller, more sophisticated computers grows, the need arises for new air cooling methods {{that will work}} in geometries that mechanical fans cannot. Ionic winds (also known as electrohydrodynamic flows) are flows that are produced by the generation of a gas discharge. These flows do not require moving parts to operate, making them attractive for small form factor devices. However, {{in order to produce}} and sustain a gas discharge in atmospheric air, very large applied voltages are required (~ 5 kV). Through the use of piezoelectric transformers (PTs), it is possible to generate ionic winds in ambient air with significantly smaller voltages (~ 7 V) than otherwise possible. When a moderate voltage is applied to a piezoelectric transformer (PT), discharges can form on the edges of the crystal that produce measureable ionic winds. The impingement cooling properties of these ionic winds jets on a vertical, uniformly-heated metal plate were studied by measuring their induced forced <b>convection</b> <b>coefficients.</b> Using a sharpened piezoelectric crystal, a round, axis symmetric ionic wind jet was formed, and it followed similar heat transfer correlations to that of more conventional jets.

Nonporous and impermeable aluminum, highly porous and permeable Berea sandstone, and minimally porous and permeable graywacke from The Geysers geothermal field.

Nucleation was shown to occur not upon the visible surface of porous materials, but a distance below the surface, within the matrix.

Although matrix boiling beyond fracture wall may apply only to a finite radius around the point of injection, higher values of heat flux and a boiling <b>convection</b> <b>coefficient</b> may be realized with boiling in a porous, rather than nonporous surface bounded fracture...|$|E

40|$|A {{brake disc}} plays an {{important}} role in the automotive industry since it concerns directly with safety. In order to develop proper heat ventilation a wide range of brake discs have been designed. Different types of physical brake disc geometries, as front- and back-vented brake discs, affect the heat ventilation directly. This is a vital factor of the brake’s capability. We recognized the importance of this circumstance and therefore attempted to create a test to investigate the temperature gradient of the brake disc in order to evaluate the <b>coefficients</b> of heat <b>convection.</b> The <b>coefficients</b> were modified by the change of temperature distribution in both brake discs under the forced heat convection in steady state conditions. However, the heat radiation value does not take into account that the heat convection is dominated by the physical geometry of the brake disc. To set up the experimental test for investigating the heat transfer by convection the JASO C 406 standard is adopted. The experimental results in terms of heat <b>convection</b> <b>coefficients</b> are used in the numerical simulation via the finite element method in order to study the temperature diffusion and heat ventilation of front and back-vented brake discs. Conse-quently, the experimental results reveal that the overall heat <b>convection</b> <b>coefficients</b> of the front-vented brake disc are higher than these of the back-vented one. In other words the simulation yields that the front-vented brake disc allows stronger heat ventilation than its compared object, leading to larger temperature differences between outboard and inboard rotors, resulting in more thermal stress. This makes it more susceptible to be damaged during operation. ...|$|R

40|$|Paper {{presented}} at the 7 th International Conference on Heat Transfer, Fluid Mechanics and Thermodynamics, Turkey, 19 - 21 July, 2010. Hydrogen-fuelled internal combustion engines are a possible solution to make transportation more ecological. A thermodynamic model of the engine cycle enables a cheap and fast optimization of engine settings. NO, emission occurs at high loads and is a constraint for power and efficiency optimization. The thermodynamic model has to predict accurately the heat transfer in the engine because the NOx emission {{is influenced by the}} maximum gas temperature. The existing engine heat transfer models in the literature are developed for fossil fuels and they have been cited to be inaccurate for hydrogen. We have measured the heat transfer inside a spark ignited engine with a thermopile to investigate the heat transfer process of hydrogen and to find the differences with fossil fuels. This paper describes the effects of the compression ratio, ignition timing and mixture richness on the heat transfer process. A <b>convection</b> <b>coefficient</b> is introduced to separate the effect of the temperature difference between the gas and the wall from the influence of the gas movement and the combustion process. The paper shows that the <b>convection</b> <b>coefficient</b> gives more insight in the heat transfer process in a combustion engine despite its doubtful definition. The maximum in the heat flux corresponds with the maximum of the temperature difference between the gas and the wall. The initial increase in the heat flux is caused by the combustion flame passage.
