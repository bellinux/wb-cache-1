5000|$|When the {{aircraft}} {{was first introduced}} the standard engine was the [...] 2si 460-F35, with the [...] Rotax 447 optional. In 2009 the standard recommended engine was the Rotax 447, with the [...] Rotax 503 single <b>carburettor</b> <b>engine</b> optional.|$|E
5000|$|Ford of Australia updated the {{crossflow}} {{design in}} mid-1980 {{with a new}} aluminum head casting. The alloy head was used to improve warmup time and reduce fuel consumption and emissions. Until 1982, the engines were fitted with a single-barrel Bendix-Stromberg carburetor, but from March 1982 were fitted with a Weber two-barrel carburetor, which had improved fuel consumption over the single-barrel carb. The Weber <b>carburettored</b> <b>engines</b> were badged Alloy-Head II ...|$|R
5000|$|The Tempra's engine {{range was}} {{similar to that of the}} Tipo. Initially 1.4- and 1.6-litre models had <b>carburettor</b> <b>engines.</b> Both of these models were {{discontinued}} in 1992, due to the new European emission standards, and thus all models from 1992 on had catalytic converters and electronic injection. Transmission was a standard five speed manual, but for the first time a midsize sedan was offered as with a continuously variable transmission which was previously available on the Fiat Uno, Panda, Ritmo and Tipo.|$|R
25|$|Australia made do {{with the}} 910 series, which was facelifted in 1985. New Zealand {{marketing}} for the U11 proclaimed the vehicle as the 'Widetrack Bluebird', to differentiate it from its very similar-looking predecessor. Several Wiri-assembled models including a wagon were offered with 1.6 (base) or two-litre <b>carburettor</b> <b>engines.</b> The alloy head castings all had an unused location for a second spark plug per cylinder, as twin-plug, fuel-injected {{versions of the same}} engines were used in certain markets (US, Japan, Scandinavia) with stricter emission laws.|$|R
50|$|June 1968: {{without any}} formal announcement, a more {{powerful}} twin carburettor version of BMC's 1,275 cc engine is fitted to manual gearbox versions of the MG, Riley, Wolseley and Vanden Plas models: automatic transmission versions retained the single <b>carburettor</b> <b>engine.</b>|$|E
50|$|From August 1934 to 1936 the Gloria range {{included}} ‘Gloria Vitesse’ models (not to {{be confused}} with later Vitesses) which were up-rated, with twin <b>carburettor</b> <b>engine</b> and equipment, versions of the equivalent Gloria and slightly different bodywork in the case of some saloons.|$|E
50|$|The first {{generation}} of the large Farinas was introduced with the Austin A99 Westminster, with the Wolseley 6/99 following shortly after in 1959 to replace the 6/90. It used the same 2.9 L (2912 cc) C-Series straight-6, , twin SU <b>carburettor</b> <b>engine</b> from the Austin-Healey 3000.|$|E
50|$|The Austin Montego, {{like many}} other Austin Rover cars at the time, offered a high luxury model. Sold {{opposite}} the MG, the Montego Vanden Plas was the luxury alternative. The Vanden Plas featured leather seats and door cards (velour in the estate version), powered windows, mirrors, door locks and sunroof. Alloy wheels were offered and later became standard on all cars. An automatic gearbox was also offered. It was available in both saloon and estate bodystyles. All Vanden Plas Montegos were 2.0 litres, either EFi (electronic fuel injection) or standard <b>carburettor</b> <b>engines.</b>|$|R
50|$|During the Battle of France and Battle of Britain in 1940, RAF pilots {{discovered}} {{a serious problem}} in fighter planes with Merlin engines, such as the Hurricane and Spitfire. When the plane went nose-down to begin a dive, the resulting negative g-force would flood the <b>engine's</b> <b>carburettor,</b> causing the <b>engine</b> to stall.|$|R
50|$|The first Morris Oxford used a White and Poppe <b>engine,</b> <b>carburettor,</b> clutch and gearbox.|$|R
50|$|The Proton Saga LMST {{hatchback}} {{was launched}} in 2003. It {{was based on the}} same platform found in the previous models. Nonetheless, it featured a modernized interior and major exterior modifications and improvements. The 1.3-litre Mitsubishi 4G13 <b>carburettor</b> <b>engine</b> was tuned to produce 83 bhp (62 kW). It was only available in two trim lines, limited to the 5-speed manual transmission.|$|E
50|$|Injection engine XCKF1 (85 hp) {{replaced}} by XCKF2, with power increased to 96 hp. XC5 <b>carburettor</b> <b>engine</b> power increased to 76 hp.Thermostable Hydrovac brakes servo-assisted by a mechanical vacuum manufactured by Bendix. The Super Luxe, coupé and convertible get eight-hole wheel covers cells instead of six-hole ones. New seat pads for Grand Touring, with cloth quilted to form longitudinal ridges {{similar to the}} 404 Super Luxe. All models are given reclining front seats.|$|E
50|$|Introduced in {{the same}} year as Jaguar's iconic E-Type, the Mark X {{impressed}} with its technical specification and innovations. Contrary to its predecessors, the car featured integrated, unitary bodywork - the largest in the UK at the time, as well as independent rear suspension, unheard for early 1960s British luxury cars. Combined with the 3.8-litre, triple <b>carburettor</b> <b>engine</b> as fitted to the E-type, it gave Jaguar's flagship a top speed of 120 mph and capable handling at less than half the price of the contemporary Rolls-Royce Silver Cloud.|$|E

5000|$|The E5 1.5-litre SOHC <b>carburettored</b> <b>engine</b> {{that was}} {{optional}} on GL, and standard on Ghia in the KB series {{was replaced with}} the new B6 1.6-litre I4 SOHC. For the first time, electronic fuel injection was available as an option on Ghia models, and was standard on TX3 models. Buyers who ordered automatic transmission with this engine received an electronically controlled four-speed unit, which was quite advanced for a small car in 1985. The B3 I4 SOHC 1.3-litre engine was standard on the [...] "L" [...] (hatchback only, the wagon had a 1.6-litre engine). The 1.6-litre engine was standard on GL, Ghia and TX3, though some early GL models were equipped with a 1.5-litre SOHC carburettored.|$|R
50|$|The {{lightweight}} all aluminum body {{consisted of}} a bonnet riveted to reinforcing copper and brass straps, scuttle on angled steel, seats tub and tail. Both narrow staggered two-seater and single-seater> were constructed by the Works. Sunbeam did not construct new bodies for each event but modified and evolved bodies from one event to another to accommodate change in branding, <b>carburettors,</b> <b>engine</b> type and fuel capacity. The side blisters on the bonnet were modified to accommodate different carburettor configurations; a hatch on scuttle was formed when a 1916 4.9lt engine was used; alternative tails and radiators were used as needed. Flared front offside wing were used during the 1922 IoM T.T. Approximate frontal area without the wing 11 1/2 sq.ft, with wing and riding mechanic 13 1/2 sq.ft.|$|R
50|$|The New Zealand Avenger {{initially}} {{was similar to}} the British line but there was just one engine and trim level to start: the 'Super' (two headlights, vinyl trim, 1.5 L single <b>carburettor</b> <b>engine,</b> manual 4-speed gearbox.). In 1971 Todd's added a unique-to-NZ, sporty, 1.5-litre twin-carburettor 'TC' model with all-black interior trim, dashtop rev counter, side striping, high-back 'tombstone' front seats, special bright paint colours and new wheel trims, among other detail changes. This was loosely based on the UK GT but lacked that car's 'Rostyle' wheels, using locally-made, look-alike pressed aluminium wheel trims instead.|$|E
5000|$|The 650SS was a Norton {{motorcycle}} made by between 1961 and 1967 at Norton’s Bracebridge Street {{works in}} Birmingham. Developed from the Norton Dominator, the Featherbed frame was altered {{so that the}} top rails were closer together to create {{what became known as}} the 'slimline featherbed'. A 650cc twin <b>carburettor</b> <b>engine</b> was installed which was capable of 110 - 115 mph. [...] The 'SS' stood for 'Sports Special' and the 600cc models were discontinued to concentrate on production of the 650SS, which quickly earned a reputation as the best of the Dommies.|$|E
5000|$|The {{final version}} of the Roadster, the 4AD, was officially known as the Singer SM Roadster. First seen at the October 1951 Paris Motor Show it was {{initially}} intended for export only. It used the , 1497 cc engine from the SM1500 saloon fitted to a virtually unchanged chassis and body, retaining the hydraulic/mechanical hybrid braking system. A [...] twin <b>carburettor</b> <b>engine</b> option was offered from 1953. The 4AD can be told apart from a 4AB by its larger, rounder bumpers, as well as bigger taillights mounted on long stalks.|$|E

5000|$|But a Monaco {{was nearly}} double {{the price of a}} Minx. While the Monaco's {{handling}} was much better there was not a lot of difference in performance, the Minx was slightly faster in a straight line. With a Riley [...] "special series" [...] twin <b>carburettor</b> <b>engine</b> you might reach 70 mph or 112 km/h. A 1931 Monaco weighed 916 kg, a 1937 model 1 160 kg. In spite of its standard twin carburettors the 1937 Monaco took half a minute to reach 50 mph and could barely exceed 62 mph or 100 km/h.|$|E
5000|$|Announced 16 October 1956, the 105R and 105S used a high-output, 8.5:1 {{compression}} {{version of}} the 2.6 L engine used in the 90. The higher compression was {{to take advantage of}} the higher octane fuel that had become widely available. This twin-SU <b>carburettor</b> <b>engine</b> produced 108 hp (80 kW). [...] Both 105 models also featured the exterior changes of the rest of the range announced a month earlier. The 105S featured separate front seats, a cigar lighter, chromed wheel trim rings and twin Lucas SFT 576 spotlamps. To minimise the cost of the 105R, these additional items were not standard, however they were provided on the (higher priced) 105R De Luxe.|$|E

500|$|This {{is a list}} of {{representative}} Merlin variants, describing some of the mechanical changes made during development of the Merlin. Engines of the same power output were typically assigned different model numbers based on supercharger or propeller gear ratios, differences in cooling system or <b>carburettors,</b> <b>engine</b> block construction, or arrangement of engine controls. Power ratings quoted are usually maximum [...] "military" [...] power. All but the Merlin 131 and 134 engines were [...] "right-hand tractor", i.e. the propeller rotated clockwise when viewed from the rear. In addition to the mark numbers, Merlin engines were allocated experimental numbers by the Ministry of Supply (MoS) – e.g.: RM 8SM for the Merlin 61 and some variants – while under development; these numbers are noted where possible. Merlin engines used in Spitfires, apart from the Merlin 61, used a propeller reduction ratio of [...]477:1. Merlins used in bombers and other fighters used a ratio of [...]42:1.|$|R
