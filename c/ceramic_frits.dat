40|$|New, clean, {{methods of}} zinc {{sulphide}} synthesis {{were established in}} order to produce small regular particles with comparable luminescence to that of commercial standards in current use. These new methods are optimised for activator and co-activator concentrations, firing conditions and other factors affecting the phosphor synthesis process. Microgels have also been used {{for the first time in}} the zinc sulphide preparation process. The resultant small, regular spherical sized particles have similar luminescent properties to those of the commercial standards available. The potential of tin oxide as a host lattice for the synthesis of phosphors has been studied. It is concluded that tin oxide cannot compete against established host lattices. A tin oxide:europium phosphor was prepared which shows luminescence in the red region of the spectrum but the intensity of this emission is very weak when compared against a commercial red standard phosphor. However the novel preparation techniques utilising microwave technology could prove useful for the synthesis of nano sized tin oxide materials. For any group of chemical materials it is important to examine potential novel uses. The aforementioned has been undertaken by incorporating a phosphor material into a ceramic frit. Different phosphors retained their luminescent properties even after being mixed into <b>ceramic</b> <b>frits</b> in much the same way dye is incorporated and fired. Numerous niche products could result from such a process. Luminescence in the animal kingdom has also been examined; this work is reported in the first part of the appendix.

The aim of this study is conducting a retrospective view of the evolution of particulate matter (PM 10) and heavy metals (As, Cd, Ni and Pb) at different localities in the Spanish cluster ceramic in the period between January 2007 and December 2011. The study area is in the province of Castellón. This province is a strategical area in the framework of European Union Pollution control. Approximately 80 % of European ceramic tiles and <b>ceramic</b> <b>frits</b> manufacturers are concentrated in two areas, forming the so-called “Ceramics Clusters”; one is in Modena (Italy) and the other in Castellón (Spain). In this kind of areas, there are a lot of pollutants from this industry that represent an important contribution to soil contamination so it is necessary to control the air quality in them. These atmospheric particles are deposited in the ground through both dry and wet deposition. Soil is a major sink for heavy metals released into the environment. The level of pollution of soils by heavy metals depends on the retention capacity of the soil, especially on physical-chemical properties (mineralogy, grain size, organic matter) affecting soil particle surfaces and also on the chemical properties of the metal. The most direct consequences on the ground of air pollutants are acidification, salinization and the pollutions that can cause heavy metals as components of suspended particulate matter. For this purpose the levels of PM 10 in ambient air and the corresponding annual and weekly trend were calculated.

The aim of this study is to conduct a retrospective view of the evolution of matter particulate (PM 10) and the heavy metals (Cd, Ni and Pb) at different localities (Alcora, Castellón and Onda) in the Spanish cluster ceramic in a period between January 2007 and December 2011. The study area is in the province of Castellón. This province is a strategic area in the framework of European Union Pollution control. Approximately 80 % of European ceramic tiles and <b>ceramic</b> <b>frits</b> manufacturers are concentrated in two areas, forming the so-called “ceramic clusters”; one is in Modena (Italy) and the other in Castellón (Spain). In these kind of areas, there are a lot of pollutants from this industry that represent an important contribution to soil contamination so it is necessary to control their air quality. In these areas atmospheric particles are deposited in the ground through both dry and wet deposition. Soil is a major sink for heavy metals released into the environment.

The results of the study show that the PM 10 and heavy metal concentrations are below the limit values recommended by European Union Legislation for the protection of human health and ecosystems in the study period. There is an important reduction of them from 2009 in all control stations due to economic crisis and subsequent decrease of industrial activity. The atmospheric seasonal tendency of pollutant concentrations is marked by the rate of industrial activity and additionally by the temperature. Complementarily, a comparative study of heavy metal levels in soils was performed in this area. Soils with low pollution by Ni and Pb were detected, while different pollution by Cd was found depending on the sampling site. Although there is an evident reduction of PM 10 and heavy metal levels, the results show that these pollutants have been accumulated in the soil close to emission sources...|$|E
40|$|The {{relationship}} between specific particulate emission control and ambient levels of some PM 10 components (Zn, As, Pb, Cs, Tl) was evaluated. To this end, the industrial area of Castellón (Eastern Spain) was selected, where around 40 % of the EU glazed ceramic tiles {{and a high}} proportion of EU <b>ceramic</b> <b>frits</b> are produced. The PM 10 emissions from the ceramic processes were calculated over the period 2000 - 2006, taking into account the degree of implementation of corrective measures throughout the study period. Abatement systems were implemented in the majority of the fusion kilns for frit manufacture in the area {{as a result of the}} application of the Directive 1996 / 61 /EC, leading to a marked decrease in PM 10 emissions. By contrast, emissions from tile manufacture remained relatively constant because of the few changes in the implementation of corrective measures. On the other hand, ambient PM 10 levels and composition measurements were carried out from 2002 to 2006. A high correlation between PM 10 emissions from frit manufacture and ambient levels of Zn, As, Pb and Cs (R 2 from 0. 61 to 0. 98) was observed. On the basis of these results, the potential impact of the implementation of corrective measures to reduce emissions from tile manufacture was quantified, resulting in a possible decrease of 3 - 5 μg/m 3 and 2 μg/m 3 in ambient mineral PM 10 (on an annual basis) in urban and suburban areas, respectively. This relatively simple methodology allows us to estimate the direct effect of a reduction in primary particulate emissions on ambient levels of key particulate components, and to make a preliminary quantification of the possibilities of air quality improvement by means of further emission reduction. Therefore, it is a useful tool for developing future air quality plans in the study area and in other industrialised areas. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E

The pate de verre process allows one to cast practically any conceivable form into a glass object. Prior to beginning, however, one should give same consideration to the entire process its possibilities and its limitations. Beginning with making glass frit, the techniques covered include experimentation an combining glass frit with <b>ceramic</b> <b>frits</b> to achieve a variety of surfaces not normally available with one glass formula. The ingredients of the plaster mold used to contain the glass frit as it is fired will change based on different properties of each constituent and the effects each has {{in combination with the}} other materials and on the glass. Individual personal style and experimentation are the best determinant of which plaster formula and method of casting the mold will produce a superior glass casting. The final stage in the pate de verre process is firing the mold which has been packed with frit to a high enough temperature to melt the glass. The kiln is held {{for a period of time}} at the high temperature to allow the frit to fuse completely, flow into and fill the mold. 2 The pate de verre process is flexible, allowing one to sculpt glass into forms not normally achieved with other glass-working processes. The glass casting, once fired, takes en characteristics that evoke other media marble, quartz, stone quite unlike our normal associations with glass. Yet the piece retains that quality of glass I find most fascinating and alluring the ability to capture the light that passes into the glass body and reflect it back out.

30|$|Bonding of {{automotive}} glass is generally performed with 1 C PUR adhesive on a primed <b>ceramic</b> <b>frit</b> or naked glass surface. The {{aim of this}} research was to replace the chemistry of the primer with an atmospheric pressure plasma treatment (APPT) with compressed air for cleaning and activation directly before bonding. Characterization of the glass surface was performed with surface energy through contact angle, XPS, TOF-SIMS and adhesive peel bead test. The results show that APPT treatment can clean the surface, improve the wetting, improve the bonding but reduce the number of non bridging oxygen for the adhesive to bond to. The highest measured spot temperature of the glass during APPT was measured up to 270  °C, but the temperature was depending on process parameters. A reduction in non bridging oxygen was also seen during heating of the reference glass at 100  °C. A further reaction was seen when measured after a 550  °C heating. A modified APPT treatment with deionized water as precursor was used. The results show that the APPT with water does not lower the level of non bridging oxygen and the bonding was further improved.|$|R
30|$|The {{function}} of the windows in a modern car {{is different from the}} one when the windows solely were used for protection against wind and rain. Today, they play a multifunctional role also acting as a stability component in the vehicle. Since the glass and body in white have a difference in coefficient of thermal expansion and the windows are wide there is a need of a flexible adhesives. Therefore, glass bonding in automotive manufacturing is often performed with a 1 C PUR adhesive. The adhesives are flexible moisture curing adhesives that consists of binder, plasticizer, filler, carbon black, additives and catalysts. Some contain silane as adhesion promoter and they are applied in thick triangular beads. When bonded they are compressed to a thickness of approximately 6  mm. The bonding is performed on either the <b>ceramic</b> <b>frit</b> surface or the naked tin or fire side of the glass. To improve the bonding between the glass and adhesive a primer with long open time is applied at the glass manufacturer. The glass is then transferred to the automotive manufacturer with a risk of contamination during transport and handling [5].|$|R

Both glass frits were of similar chemical composition changing SiO 2 by 5 % of B 2 O 3 and both of them were water or dry milled. Glass frit surfaces were characterized by FT-IR, Karl-Fischer (K-F) titration and Inverse Gas Chromatography at Infinite Dilution (IGC-ID). By K-F titration it was observed that water milled frits presented 28 and 26 OH groups for 100 A 2 if they do not contain or contain boron, respectively. These surface changes are also observed by IGC-ID. Thus, the glass frit without boron and dry milled presented the highest dispersive surface energy (44 mJ. m - 2) and the less acidic constant (0. 13 kJ. mol - 1). Both glass frits are amphoteric with acidic and base surface active sites, and that frit without boron presents the higher basicity. Milling process influences in the acid-base surface characteristics of both frits by increasing the basicity for the one without boron and increasing for the other one. This has been assigned to the different location of hydroxyl groups where the higher interaction is the one that does not contain boron and dry milled as K-F results. Se ha estudiado el proceso de molienda en dos fritas de la industria cerámica. Las dos fritas, de composiciones similares pero en una se ha sustituido parte de la sílice por 5 % de óxido de boro, fueron molidas por vía seca o húmeda y se caracterizaron mediante FT-IR, valoración Karl-Fischer e IGC-ID. Mediante valoración se han determinado los contenidos en moléculas de agua e hidroxilos. El mayor contenido en hidroxilos lo posee la frita sin boro seguida de la de boro ambas molidas en húmedo, poseyendo 28 y 26 grupos OH por cada 100 A 2, respectivamente. Estos resultados coinciden con IGC-ID, sin embargo es la frita sin boro molida en seco la de mayor energía superficial (44 mJ. m - 2) y constante ácida (0. 13 kJ. mol - 1).

40|$|Environmental {{pollution}} control {{is one of}} the most important goals in pollution risk assessment today. In this sense, modern and precise tools that allow scientists to evaluate, quantify and predict air pollution are of particular interest. Monitoring atmospheric particulate matter is a challenge faced by the European Union. Specific rules on this subject are being developed (Directive 2004 / 107 /EC, Directive 2008 / 50 /EC) in order to reduce the potential adverse effects on human health caused by air pollution. Air pollution has two sources: natural and anthropogenic. Contributions from natural sources can be assessed but cannot be controlled, while emissions from anthropogenic sources can be controlled; monitoring to reduce this latter type of pollution should therefore be carried out. In this paper, we describe an air quality evaluation in terms of levels of atmospheric particles (PM 10), as outlined by European Union legislation, carried out in an industrialised Spanish coastal area over a five-year period with the purpose of comparing these values with those of other areas in the Mediterranean Basin with different weather conditions from North of Europe. The study area is in the province of Castellón. This province is a strategic area in the frame work of European Union (EU) {{pollution control}}.

Air quality indexes for each pollutant have been established to determine easily and clearly the quality of air breathed. Furthermore, in accordance with Directive 2008 / 50 /EC, an Air Quality Plan is proposed to protect human health, and the environment as a whole, in the study area.

40|$|The European {{ceramic tile}} {{industry}} is mostly concentrated in two clusters, one in Castelló (Spain) {{and another one}} in Modena (Italy). Industrial clusters may have problems to accomplish the EU air quality regulations because of the concentration of some specific pollutants and, hence, the feasibility of the industrial clusters can be jeopardised. The present work assesses the air quality in these ceramic clusters in 2008, when the new EU emission regulations where put into force. PM 10 samples were collected at two sampling sites in the Modena ceramic cluster and one sampling site in the Castelló ceramic cluster. PM 10 annual average concentrations were 12 – 14 μg m− 3 higher in Modena than in Castelló, and were close to or exceeded the European limit. Air quality in Modena was mainly influenced by road traffic and, in a lower degree, the metalmechanical industry, {{as evidenced by the}} high concentrations of Mn, Cu, Zn, Sn and Sb registered. The stagnant weather conditions from Modena hindering dispersion of pollutants also contributed to the relatively high pollution levels. In Castelló, the influence of the ceramic industry is evidenced by the high concentrations of Ti, Se, Tl and Pb, whereas this influence is not seen in Modena. The difference in the impact of the ceramic industry on the air quality in the two areas was attributed to: better abatement systems in the spray-drier facilities in Modena, higher coverage of the areas for storage and handling of dusty raw materials in Modena, presence of two open air quarries in the Castelló region, low degree of abatement systems in the ceramic tile kilns in Castelló, and abundance of <b>ceramic</b> <b>frit,</b> glaze and pigment manufacture in Castelló as opposed to scarce manufacture of these products in Modena. The necessity of additional measures to fulfil the EU air quality requirements in the Modena region is evidenced, despite the high degree of environmental measures implemented in the ceramic industry.

40|$|Srilankite-type {{zirconium}} titanate, {{a promising}} structure for ceramic pigments, was synthesized at 1400 degrees C following three main doping strategies: (a) ZrTi(1 -x) A(x) O(4), (b) ZrTi(1 -x-y) A(x) B(y) O(4) and (c) Zr 1 -xCTiO 4 where A = Co, Cr, Fe, Mn. Ni or V (chromophores), B = Sb or W (counterions) and C = Pr (chromophore); x = y = 0. 05. Powders {{were characterized by}} XRD with Rietveld refinements and DRS in the UV-visible-NIR range; technological properties were appraised in several <b>ceramic</b> matrices (<b>frits,</b> glazes and body). Zirconium titanate can be usefully coloured with first row transition elements, giving green and greenish yellow (Co and Ni); orange-buff (Cr and V); tan-brown hues (Mn and Fe). In industrial-like synthesis conditions, a disordered structure as (Zr,Ti) O- 2, with both Zr and Ti randomly distributed in the octahedral site, is achieved. Doping with chromophores and counterions induces unit cell dimensions variation and causes an oversaturation in zirconium oxide. Optical spectroscopy reveals the occurrence of Co 2 +, Cr 3 +, Fe 3 +, Mn 2 +, Mn 3 +, Ni 2 +, V 3 + and V 4 +. The zirconium titanate pigments fulfil current technological requirements for low-temperature applications, but exhibit a limited chemico-physical stability for higher firing temperature and in chemically aggressive media...|$|R
5|$|Ceramic {{industry}} consumes {{a significant}} amount of zinc oxide, in particular in <b>ceramic</b> glaze and <b>frit</b> compositions. The relatively high heat capacity, thermal conductivity and high temperature stability of ZnO coupled with a comparatively low coefﬁcient of expansion are desirable properties in the production of ceramics. ZnO affects the melting point and optical properties of the glazes, enamels, and ceramic formulations. Zinc oxide as a low expansion, secondary ﬂux improves the elasticity of glazes by reducing the change in viscosity as a function of temperature and helps prevent crazing and shivering. By substituting ZnO for BaO and PbO, the heat capacity is decreased and the thermal conductivity is increased. Zinc in small amounts improves the development of glossy and brilliant surfaces. However, in moderate to high amounts, it produces matte and crystalline surfaces. With regard to color, zinc has a complicated inﬂuence.|$|R
40|$|A {{method for}} {{applying}} a mixed metal oxide catalyst to a metallic substrate {{for the creation}} of a robust, high temperature catalyst system for use in decomposing propellants, particularly hydrogen peroxide propellants, for use in propulsion systems. The method begins by forming a prepared substrate material consisting of a metallic inner substrate and a bound layer of a noble metal intermediate. Alternatively, a bound <b>ceramic</b> coating, or <b>frit,</b> may be introduced between the metallic inner substrate and noble metal intermediate when the metallic substrate is oxidation resistant. A high-activity catalyst slurry is applied to the surface of the prepared substrate and dried to remove the organic solvent. The catalyst layer is then heat treated to bind the catalyst layer to the surface. The bound catalyst layer is then activated using an activation treatment and calcinations to form the high-activity catalyst system...|$|R

40|$|Baked <b>ceramic</b> {{aggregates}} (<b>fritted</b> clay, arcillite) {{have been}} used for plant research both on the ground and in microgravity. Optimal control of water and air within the root zone in any gravity environment depends on physical and hydraulic properties of the aggregate, which were evaluated for 0. 25 - 1 -mm and 1 - 2 -mm particle size distributions. The maximum bulk densities obtained by any packing technique were 0. 68 and 0. 64 g cm- 3 for 0. 25 - 1 -mm and 1 - 2 -mm particles, respectively. Wettable porosity obtained by infiltration with water was approximately 65 %, substantially lower than total porosity of approximately 74 %. Aggregate of both particle sizes exhibited a bimodal pore size distribution consisting of inter-aggregate macropores and intra-aggregate micropores, with the transition from macro- to microporosity beginning at volumetric water content of approximately 36 % to 39 %. For inter-aggregate water contents that support optimal plant growth there is 45 % change in water content that occurs over a relatively small matric suction range of 0 - 20 cm H 2 O for 0. 25 - 1 -mm and 0 to - 10 cm H 2 O for 1 - 2 -mm aggregate. Hysteresis is substantial between draining and wetting aggregate, which results in as much as a approximately 10 % to 20 % difference in volumetric water content for a given matric potential. Hydraulic conductivity was approximately an order of magnitude higher for 1 - 2 -mm than for 0. 25 - 1 -mm aggregate until significant drainage of the inter-aggregate pore space occurred. The large change in water content for a relatively small change in matric potential suggests that significant differences in water retention may be observed in microgravity as compared to earth...|$|R
