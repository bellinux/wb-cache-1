5|$|In January 1908, Sheppard {{published}} {{a report on}} colonial abuses in the American Presbyterian Congo Mission (APCM) newsletter, and both he and Morrison were sued for libel against the Kasai Rubber Company (Compagnie de Kasai), a prominent Belgian rubber contractor in the area. When the case went to court in September 1909, the two missionaries had support from the CRA, American Progressives, and their lawyer, Emile Vandervelde, a prominent Belgian socialist. The judge acquitted Sheppard (Morrison had been acquitted earlier on a technicality) {{on the premise that}} his editorial had not named the major company, but smaller <b>charter</b> <b>companies</b> instead. However, {{it is likely that the}} case was decided in favor of Sheppard as a result of international politics; the U.S., socially in support of the missionaries, had questioned the validity of King Leopold II's rule over the Congo.|$|E
5|$|The Power Pilot Scholarship (PPS) {{program is}} a seven-week course that allows cadets to get their private pilot licence and their Air Cadet Power Pilot Wings. A goal for many cadets within the program is to secure a private pilot licence prior {{to the age of}} 19. Cadets who are aged 17–18 apply and are {{selected}} to write an exam and interview for the prestigious scholarship. The course provides cadets with both ground school training and in-flight instruction at the various flight centres across Canada. Cadets who have been successful within the program have integrated themselves with commercial airlines, the Canadian Forces, various courier and <b>charter</b> <b>companies,</b> and have also gone on to become instructors at various flight schools.

25|$|Some colonies, such as Virginia, {{were founded}} principally as {{business}} ventures. England's success at colonizing {{what would become}} the United States was {{due in large part to}} its use of <b>charter</b> <b>companies.</b> <b>Charter</b> <b>companies</b> were groups of stockholders (usually merchants and wealthy landowners) who sought personal economic gain and, perhaps, wanted also to advance England's national goals. While the private sector financed the companies, the king also provided each project with a charter or grant conferring economic rights as well as political and judicial authority. The colonies did not show profits, however, and the disappointed English investors often turned over their colonial charters to the settlers. The political implications, although not realized at the time, were enormous. The colonists were left to build their own governments and their own economy.|$|E
