5|$|The Beatles' booking agent, Allan Williams, {{decided to}} send the group to Hamburg when another group he managed, Derry and the Seniors, proved {{successful}} there. Having no permanent drummer at the time, they recruited Best {{a few days before}} their departure. After breaking their contract by playing at another club, Harrison was deported for being underaged, and McCartney and Best were arrested and deported for attempted arson (after McCartney or Best had set fire to a condom in their living quarters as a light source to gather their possessions as their host had <b>cut</b> <b>off</b> <b>power</b> to their room).|$|E
5|$|A maximum {{wind gust}} of 158km/h (98mph) was {{recorded}} on Cairn Gorm, Scotland as Katia impacted the region, with a peak gust of 130km/h (81mph) observed at a non-mountain station in Capel Curig, Wales; these observations marked the strongest impact from a tropical cyclone since Hurricane Lili in 1996. Waves up to 15meters (49ft) battered the western coastline of Ireland, and fallen power lines temporarily disrupted DART services. Approximately 4,000 households were left without power across the country. A catering marquee was blown {{into the air}} on a set for the television series Game of Thrones, causing one injury. In County Durham, United Kingdom, a man was killed after a tree fell on the minivan he was driving; the passenger sustained non-life-threatening injuries. A second driver was indirectly killed on the M54 motorway after hazardous weather caused a multi-car accident. Farther south in Bradford, an 11-year-old boy was injured after {{he was hit by}} a portion of a roof blown off a garage. Downed power poles set several fields on fire. The second stage of the Tour of Britain was forcefully canceled after strong winds littered the cycle route with debris. Following the storm, damage estimates in the United Kingdom alone topped £100m ($157 million 2011 USD). The remnants of Katia produced damage as far east as Russia. In St. Petersburg, wind gusts up to 45mph (75km/h) damaged buildings and left roughly 1,500 residents without power. In Estonia, the storm <b>cut</b> <b>off</b> <b>power</b> to approximately 940 households, particularly affecting the island of Hiiumaa and Harju County, with strong winds in coastal areas gusting up to 90km/h (55mph).|$|E
25|$|At {{the moment}} the {{stabilizer}} separated from the aircraft, the plane pitched downwards, headed straight for Belle Harbor. As the pilots struggled to control the aircraft, it went into a flat spin. The resulting aerodynamic loads sheared both engines from the aircraft seconds before impact. The engines landed several blocks north and east of the main wreckage site. Losing the engines <b>cut</b> <b>off</b> <b>power</b> to the FDR at 9:16:00, while the CVR (cockpit voice recorder), utilizing a battery backup, cut off at 9:16:15 moments before impact with the ground. The main impact location was the intersection of Newport Avenue and Beach 131st Street.|$|E

50|$|Electric trams use various {{devices to}} collect power from {{overhead}} lines. The most common device found {{today is the}} pantograph, while some older systems use trolley poles or bow collectors. Ground-level power supply has become a recent innovation. Another new technology uses supercapacitors; when an insulator at a track switch <b>cuts</b> <b>off</b> <b>power</b> from the tram for a short distance along the line, the tram can use energy stored in a large capacitor to drive the tram past {{the gap in the}} power feed. A rather obsolete system for power supply is conduit current collection.|$|R
25|$|Floods from Mindulle's heavy {{rainfall}} submerged a tunnel along the Chūō Expressway in Tokyo. Portions of Naval Air Facility Atsugi, Yokota Air Base, and Camp Zama were flooded, with runways submerged. At Yokota Air Base, the floods <b>cut</b> <b>off</b> <b>power</b> to five housing towers, forcing the occupants to evacuate. Floodwaters covered roads and damaged homes in Hokkaido, {{and a man}} drowned in Kitami, days after floods from Kompasu also killed a man on Hokkaido. A woman in Sagamihara outside Tokyo also drowned during the storm. Nationwide, Mindulle's effects injured 61people. Across southeastern Honshu, 15rivers flooded, and a train line was washed out in western Tokyo, forcing a train of commuters to evacuate. High winds knocked a tree onto a central Tokyo train station, which suspended service on the Tokyo Loop Line. Fallen power lines left over 100,000people without power, mostly in Chiba Prefecture.|$|E
500|$|Clare {{produced}} extensive flooding {{that forced}} {{the closure of}} numerous roads, including part of the North West Coastal Highway. It also triggered torrential rains and flooding in southern areas of the country, including Gascoyne and the South-West Land Division. There, [...] of rain fell in 24 hours. Additionally, the Greenough River surpassed its banks; a sandbagging effort prevented the resultant floods from inundating the town of Walkaway. The storm <b>cut</b> <b>off</b> <b>power</b> and left {{tens of thousands of}} residents without telephone service. Property damage was generally minor, and no casualties or significant injuries from the storm were reported. The name Clare was retired following its usage in 2006.|$|E
500|$|Across eastern China, Fitow left heavy damage due {{to strong}} winds, heavy rainfall, and a {{powerful}} storm surge. Floodwaters covered about 70% of the metropolis of Yuyao, reaching [...] in some areas, which <b>cut</b> <b>off</b> <b>power</b> and water supply. The floods were the worst in a century for the city, covering most roadways, and forcing most schools, health facilities, and factories to close. In the city, about 100,000people were forced to evacuate, with 289temporary shelters opened. Damage in the city alone totaled about ¥20billion (RMB, $3.25billion USD). In Ningbo in eastern Zhejiang, Fitow wrecked 26,180houses and damaged local fish farms, killing 51,000tons of fish. The storm forced 18,134factories to shut down, and there were also power and telecommunication outages.|$|E

500|$|Since 2002, {{the club}} has faced severe {{financial}} difficulties {{as a result of}} various events including the collapse of ITV Digital, relegation from the Championship, and the cost of refurbishing the stadium. In 2006 EDF Energy <b>cut</b> <b>off</b> <b>power</b> to the stadium as a result of unpaid bills of approximately £100,000. By 2008, the club's level of debt had reached approximately £13million, although this was reduced dramatically {{as a result of the}} sale of Priestfield Stadium to a new holding company. [...] In 2011, however, the club bought the stadium back for £1million, considerably less than the £10million for which it was sold in 2008. The club also resolved not to hold any more AGMs or allow any formal discussion on the business of the club.|$|E
500|$|Karlsruhe {{then left}} Kristiansand {{with three of}} the torpedo boats as escorts. The British {{submarine}} [...] was positioned outside the fjord, and when her crew spotted the German ships, she fired a spread of torpedoes. Karlsruhe zig-zagged to evade the torpedoes, but two still hit the ship; one struck her bow and the other hit amidships. They blasted large holes in the hull and allowed {{thousands of tons of}} water to flood the ship. The flooding disabled her engines and electricity generators, which <b>cut</b> <b>off</b> <b>power</b> to the pumps that were trying {{to keep pace with the}} progressively worsening flooding. With the pumps shut off, there was no hope to save Karlsruhe, and so her commander, Friedrich Rieve issued the order to abandon her two hours after the attack. The torpedo boat [...] took off her crew and fired two more torpedoes into the ship to ensure that she sank.|$|E

2500|$|Then on March 6, 1925, UMWA struck again, {{this time}} to win a wage {{increase}} to restore income to its 1922 levels. Twelve thousand miners walked out. BESCO police began terrorizing citizens in mining towns throughout the province, charging even small groups of people on horseback and beating anyone they caught. BESCO, which owned most of the electrical utilities and grocery stores in the mining towns, <b>cut</b> <b>off</b> <b>power</b> and credit. By June, thousands of families {{were on the verge}} of starvation. On June 11, approximately 3,000 men and boys gathered in the town of New Waterford and marched on the city's BESCO-owned power plant, determined to restore water and power service to their homes. The strikers and their supporters were confronted by 100 mounted, armed police. In what became known as the [...] "William Davis Miners' Memorial Day", the police attacked. Several policemen fired into the crowd, hitting three. Gilbert Watson and Michael O'Handley were wounded, but William Davis died from a bullet in the heart.
