50|$|In {{the years}} prior to the 1900s, a problem arose for those who grew Smyrna figs outside of the Mediterranean. Fig wasps were only found in a very small portion of the world and there was no other known way to {{pollinate}} figs. So people perfected a practice known as artificial <b>caprification.</b> In this process, the maturation of the figs is completely reliant on humans, for the fig wasps are entirely absent. They took male figs and broke them open, releasing their pollen. They then took tooth picks and dusted them with the pollen and proceeded to poke them into the female figs, thus artificially pollinating them and allowing them to reach maturity. This process of artificial <b>caprification</b> was vital to the culture of figs in California, until fig wasps were eventually imported into the state from Turkey. In this case, without the close interaction with humans, these figs would have never succeeded {{in this part of the}} world.|$|E
50|$|Unlike Ficus carica, {{which are}} able to {{reproduce}} without pollination, in order for Smyrna figs to reach maturity {{it is important that}} they be pollinated by a fig wasp. Figs and fig wasps have had a symbiotic relationship throughout history. The fig wasps need the figs in order to reproduce, while the figs rely on the wasps to aid them in their pollination. If a fig goes without such pollination, it will fall off of the tree without producing the sweet fruit that gives it its value. To insure that this process occurs, and that they are not left without a crop, those who raise figs around the Mediterranean help in the <b>caprification</b> (the process of fig pollination). They help aid this process by buying male figs, from different towns, that are already filled with fig wasps. They then string these figs together and hang them in their trees. When the fig wasps emerge, they pollinate the figs and allow them to mature. In this way, figs are reliant on human activities, which is representative of their domestication. Without human interference, they would not likely reach maturity.|$|E
40|$|International audienceFigs, when ripe, move {{to their}} final colour and lose radically their firmness, and <b>caprification</b> (artificial pollination) leads to {{increased}} fruit softening during maturity. To identify {{the effects of}} <b>caprification</b> on cell wall amounts and phenolics composition, cell wall material and polyphenols were investigated in five Tunisian figs. Cell walls were isolated as alcohol insoluble solids (AIS) content. AIS yield was not affected by <b>caprification</b> in all cultivars. Pectin polymers decreased as the fruits fulfil their development after being caprified. The pectin in figs exhibited high degree of methylation (> 50 %) which increased more with <b>caprification.</b> Major neutral sugars components of the AIS were glucose, from cellulose, followed by arabinose. <b>Caprification</b> {{had no effect on}} neutral sugars composition of the cell wall. Methanol extraction followed by HPLCâ€“DAD analysis revealed two anthocyanins, three flavonols and one hydroxycinnamic acid. For all varieties the total polyphenols were less in the flesh (up to 1. 27 mg/kg FW) than in the peel (up to 12. 64 mg/kg FW). Anthocyanins were the major compounds described in figs representing more than 98 % of total polyphenols in both dark and white coloured fruit. Textural components and properties of figs are moderately affected by <b>caprification,</b> while anthocyanins biosynthesis appears to be stimulated by pollination with higher concentrations of total polyphenols in caprified fig fruits...|$|E
40|$|Fig. (Ficus carica L.) is a gynodioecious {{species with}} two major sex types: the caprifig (hermaphroditic), which has male flowers and short-styled female flowers, and the fig (female) with only long-styled female flowers. Many fig {{varieties}} require pollen to allow flower fertilization and fruit {{development in a}} process known as <b>caprification.</b> Fig varieties produce one or two crops per year; the first is the breba and the second, the main crop. Puglia is characterized by a wide germplasm of both edible (female) figs and (male) caprifigs. Over 100 different fig genotypes, mainly collected in Puglia, are located in the fig repository at the P. Martucci experimental station, University of Bari 'Aldo Moro'. The tendency towards <b>caprification</b> of the three fig types (Common, Smyrna and San Pedro) is still unclear. To investigate the biological behavior of 24 fig genotypes, both <b>caprification</b> trials and microsatellite analysis were used. Fruit-set of brebas was very variable, whereas fruit-set of main crop was medium-high in the Common type varieties and low in the San Pedro types. Almost all genotypes were physiologically biferous. We compared these results with those obtained from molecular and phylogenetic analyses. Out of 49 SSR markers tested, 39 amplified one or two PCR products, and 31 were polymorphic. Phylogenetic analysis of the 24 fig genotypes revealed a clear distinction between Common and San Pedro type figs. Greater understanding of fig biological <b>caprification</b> is important to distinguish fig types into those requiring <b>caprification</b> and those that do not require <b>caprification...</b>|$|E
