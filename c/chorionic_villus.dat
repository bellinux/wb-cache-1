5|$|It is also {{possible}} to obtain a prenatal diagnosis for an embryo or fetus in the womb, using fetal genetic material acquired through <b>chorionic</b> <b>villus</b> sampling. An amniocentesis can be performed if the pregnancy is further along, within 14–18 weeks. This procedure looks at the amniotic fluid surrounding the baby for indicators of the HD mutation. This, too, can be paired with exclusion testing to avoid disclosure of parental genotype. Prenatal testing can be done when a parent has been diagnosed with HD, when they have had genetic testing showing {{the expansion of the}} HTT gene, or when they have a 50% chance of inheriting the disease. The parents can be counseled on their options, which include termination of pregnancy, and on the difficulties of a child with the identified gene.|$|E
25|$|Amniocentesis and <b>chorionic</b> <b>villus</b> {{sampling}} are procedures {{conducted to}} assess the fetus. A sample of amniotic fluid is obtained by the insertion of a needle through the abdomen and into the uterus. <b>Chorionic</b> <b>villus</b> sampling is a similar procedure {{with a sample of}} tissue removed rather than fluid. These procedures are not associated with pregnancy loss during the second trimester but they are associated with miscarriages and birth defects in the first trimester. Miscarriage caused by invasive prenatal diagnosis (<b>chorionic</b> <b>villus</b> sampling (CVS) and amniocentesis) is rare (about 1%).|$|E
25|$|During pregnancy, testing can be {{performed}} on the placenta (<b>chorionic</b> <b>villus</b> sampling) or the fluid around the fetus (amniocentesis). However, <b>chorionic</b> <b>villus</b> sampling has a risk of fetal death of one in 100 and amniocentesis of one in 200; a recent study has indicated this may be much lower, about one in 1,600.|$|E

25|$|Referral for {{counseling}} in a prenatal genetics clinic to discuss {{risks to the}} pregnancy (advanced maternal age, teratogen exposure, family history of a genetic disease), test results (abnormal maternal serum screen, abnormal ultrasound), and/or options for prenatal diagnosis (typically amniocentesis or <b>chorionic</b> <b>villus</b> sampling).|$|E
25|$|Prenatal diagnosis. If {{both parents}} are {{identified}} as carriers, prenatal genetic testing can determine whether the fetus has inherited a defective gene copy from both parents. <b>Chorionic</b> <b>villus</b> sampling (CVS), {{the most common form}} of prenatal diagnosis, can be performed between 10 and 14 weeks of gestation. Amniocentesis is usually performed at 15–18 weeks. These procedures have risks of miscarriage of 1% or less.|$|E
25|$|Despite the {{excellent}} postnatal prognosis, 99% of Turner-syndrome conceptions {{are thought to}} end in miscarriage or stillbirth, {{and as many as}} 15% of all spontaneous abortions have the 45,X karyotype. Among cases that are detected by routine amniocentesis or <b>chorionic</b> <b>villus</b> sampling, one study found that the prevalence of Turner syndrome among tested pregnancies was 5.58 and 13.3 times higher, respectively, than among live neonates in a similar population.|$|E
25|$|Triple X {{syndrome}} can {{be diagnosed}} prenatally through amniocentesis or <b>chorionic</b> <b>villus</b> sampling. In Denmark, between 1970 and 1984, 76% of the prenatally diagnosed fetuses with triple-X were aborted. Between 1985-1987, this figure dropped to 56%. With improved information, {{the number of}} abortions diminished. In the Netherlands, between 1991 and 2000, 33% (18/54) of the couples that were confronted with a prenatal diagnosis of 47, XXX elected to abort. If balanced information is provided to prospective parents, prenatally, the incidence of voluntary termination (abortion) is reduced.|$|E
25|$|Whether {{the fetus}} is an {{affected}} girl {{can be determined}} by <b>chorionic</b> <b>villus</b> sampling at 9–11 weeks of gestation, or by amniocentesis at 15–18 weeks gestation. In each case the fetal sex can be determined quickly, and if the fetus is a male the dexamethasone can be discontinued. If female, fetal DNA is analyzed {{to see if she}} carries one of the known abnormal alleles of the CYP21 gene. If so, dexamethasone is continued {{for the remainder of the}} pregnancy at a dose of about 1mg daily.|$|E
25|$|Diagnosis {{often can}} be made through {{clinical}} examination and urine tests (excess mucopolysaccharides are excreted in the urine). Enzyme assays (testing a variety of cells or body fluids in culture for enzyme deficiency) are also used to provide definitive diagnosis {{of one of the}} mucopolysaccharidoses. Prenatal diagnosis using amniocentesis and <b>chorionic</b> <b>villus</b> sampling can verify if a fetus either carries a copy of the defective gene or is affected with the disorder. Genetic counseling can help parents who {{have a family history of}} the mucopolysaccharidoses determine if they are carrying the mutated gene that causes the disorders.|$|E
25|$|Prenatal {{and other}} {{diagnostic}} techniques such as immunocytochemistry (ICC) evaluation are usually followed by FISH or Polymerase Chain Reaction to detect chromosomal aneuploidies. Maternal blood sampling for fetal cells, often used to identify risk of trisomies 18 or 21, poses less risk as compared to amniocentesis and chorionic villous sampling (CVS). <b>Chorionic</b> <b>villus</b> sampling utilizes placental tissue to give information about fetal chromosome status and has been used since the 1970s. In addition to CVS, amniocentesis {{can be used to}} obtain fetal karyotype by examining fetal cells in amniotic fluid. It was first performed in 1952 and became standard practice in the 1970s. The odds of having a child with polysomy increases as the age of the mother increases, so pregnant women over the age of 35 are tested.|$|E
25|$|Prenatal diagnosis: Used {{to detect}} {{changes in a}} fetus's genes or {{chromosomes}} before birth. This type of testing is offered to couples with {{an increased risk of}} having a baby with a genetic or chromosomal disorder. In some cases, prenatal testing can lessen a couple's uncertainty or help them decide whether to abort the pregnancy. It cannot identify all possible inherited disorders and birth defects, however. One method of performing a prenatal genetic test involves an amniocentesis, which removes a sample of fluid from the mother’s amniotic sac 15 to 20 or more weeks into pregnancy. The fluid is then tested for chromosomal abnormalities such as Down syndrome (Trisomy 21) and Trisomy 18, which can result in neonatal or fetal death. Test results can be retrieved within 7–14 days after the test is done. This method is 99.4% accurate at detecting and diagnosing fetal chromosome abnormalities. Although there is a risk of miscarriage associated with an amniocentesis, the miscarriage rate is only 1/400. Another method of prenatal testing is <b>Chorionic</b> <b>Villus</b> Sampling (CVS). Chorionic villi are projections from the placenta that carry the same genetic makeup as the baby. During this method of prenatal testing, a sample of chorionic villi is removed from the placenta to be tested. This test is performed 10–13 weeks into pregnancy and results are ready 7–14 days after the test was done. Another test using blood taken from the fetal umbilical cord is percutaneous umbilical cord blood sampling.|$|E

50|$|The most {{invasive}} {{measures are}} <b>chorionic</b> <b>villus</b> sampling (CVS) and amniocentesis, which involve {{testing of the}} <b>chorionic</b> <b>villus</b> (found in the placenta) and amniotic fluid, respectively. Both techniques typically test for chromosomal disorders but can also reveal {{the sex of the}} child and are performed early in the pregnancy. However, they are often more expensive and more dangerous than blood sampling or ultrasonography, so they are seen less frequently than other sex determination techniques.|$|E
50|$|Diagnostic {{prenatal}} testing can {{be performed}} by invasive or non-invasive methods. An invasive method involves probes or needles being inserted into the uterus, e.g. amniocentesis, which can be done from about 14 weeks gestation, and usually up to about 20 weeks, and <b>chorionic</b> <b>villus</b> sampling, which can be done earlier (between 9.5 and 12.5 weeks gestation) but which may be slightly more risky to the fetus. One study comparing transabdominal <b>chorionic</b> <b>villus</b> sampling with second trimester amniocentesis found no signiﬁcant difference in the total pregnancy loss between the two procedures. However, transcervical <b>chorionic</b> <b>villus</b> sampling carries a signiﬁcantly higher risk, compared with a second trimester amniocentesis, of total pregnancy loss (relative risk 1.40; 95% confidence interval 1.09 to 1.81) and spontaneous miscarriage (9.4% risk; relative risk 1.50; 95% confidence interval 1.07 to 2.11).|$|E

5000|$|<b>Chorionic</b> <b>villus</b> {{sampling}} (CVS), {{sometimes called}} [...] "chorionic villous sampling" [...] (as [...] "villous" [...] is the adjectival {{form of the}} word [...] "villus"), {{is a form of}} prenatal diagnosis to determine chromosomal or genetic disorders in the fetus. It entails sampling of the <b>chorionic</b> <b>villus</b> (placental tissue) and testing it for chromosomal abnormalities, usually with FISH or PCR. CVS usually takes place at 10-12 weeks' gestation, earlier than amniocentesis or percutaneous umbilical cord blood sampling. It is the preferred technique before 15 weeks.|$|E
50|$|Confined placental mosaicism (CPM) {{represents}} a {{discrepancy between the}} chromosomal makeup of the cells in the placenta and the cells in the baby. CPM was first described by Kalousek and Dill in 1983. CPM is diagnosed when some trisomic cells are detected on <b>chorionic</b> <b>villus</b> sampling and only normal cells are found on a subsequent prenatal test, such as amniocentesis or fetal blood sampling. In theory, CPM is when the trisomic cells are found only in the placenta. CPM is detected in approximately 1-2% of ongoing pregnancies that are studied by <b>chorionic</b> <b>villus</b> sampling (CVS) at 10 to 12 weeks of pregnancy. <b>Chorionic</b> <b>villus</b> sampling is a prenatal procedure which involves a placental biopsy. Most commonly when CPM is found it {{represents a}} trisomic cell line in the placenta and a normal diploid chromosome complement in the baby. However, the fetus is involved in about 10% of cases.|$|E
50|$|When {{screening}} tests predict {{a high risk}} of Down syndrome, a more invasive diagnostic test (amniocentesis or <b>chorionic</b> <b>villus</b> sampling) is needed to confirm the diagnosis. If Down syndrome occurs in one in 500 pregnancies and the test used has a 5% false-positive rate, this means, of 26 women who test positive on screening, only one will have Down syndrome confirmed. If the screening test has a 2% false-positive rate, this means one of eleven who test positive on screening have a fetus with DS. Amniocentesis and <b>chorionic</b> <b>villus</b> sampling are more reliable tests, but they increase the risk of miscarriage between 0.5 and 1%. The risk of limb problems is increased in the offspring due to the procedure. The risk from the procedure is greater the earlier it is performed, thus amniocentesis is not recommended before 15 weeks gestational age and <b>chorionic</b> <b>villus</b> sampling before 10 weeks gestational age.|$|E
