2500|$|This civic {{republican or}} deliberative {{democratic}} {{conception of the}} good provides both procedural and substantive insights for developing a just allocation of health care resources. Procedurally, it suggests the need for public forums to deliberate about which health services should be considered basic and should be socially guaranteed. Substantively, it suggests services that promote {{the continuation of the}} polity-those that ensure healthy future generations, ensure development of practical reasoning skills, and ensure full and active participation by citizens in public deliberations-are to be socially guaranteed as basic. Conversely, services provided to individuals who are irreversibly prevented from being or becoming participating citizens are not basic and should not be guaranteed. An obvious example is not guaranteeing health services to patients with dementia.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: This study {{aimed to}} {{investigate}} whether staff training improved knowledge about the defining criteria for <b>learning</b> <b>disability,</b> knowledge about the management of challenging behaviour, attributions about challenging behaviour and confidence in working <b>with</b> <b>children</b> <b>with</b> a <b>learning</b> <b>disability</b> and challenging behaviour in teaching staff from mainstream primary school settings. In addition, the study aimed to investigate if staff training improved teaching staff’s attitudes towards the inclusion of <b>children</b> <b>with</b> a <b>learning</b> <b>disability</b> and challenging behaviour in mainstream settings. A further investigation into {{whether the number of}} years experience of teaching <b>children</b> <b>with</b> a <b>learning</b> <b>disability</b> positively affected their levels of confidence in working with and knowledge about <b>children</b> <b>with</b> a <b>learning</b> <b>disability</b> and challenging behaviour. METHOD: A within subjects design was used to investigate the impact of a half-day training event on the above factors in a group of 40 teaching staff from mainstream primary school settings. A questionnaire devised for the purposes of assessing the study’s hypotheses and the Impact of Inclusion Questionnaire (IIQ) were employed in this study and completed by participants prior to training, immediately after training and one-month following training. RESULTS: Staff training was shown to significantly improve knowledge about the defining criteria for <b>learning</b> <b>disability</b> immediately after training and at one-month follow-up. Training, however, did not significantly improve knowledge about challenging behaviour immediately after training although some significant differences were found at follow up. Significant differences in the types of answers provided at each time point were found {{in a number of areas}} related to knowledge about challenging behaviour. Training did not significantly change attitudes towards the inclusion of <b>children</b> <b>with</b> a <b>learning</b> <b>disability</b> and challenging behaviour in mainstream settings and did not significantly improve confidence about working <b>with</b> <b>children</b> <b>with</b> a <b>learning</b> <b>disability</b> and challenging behaviour. No significant relationship was found between experience of teaching <b>children</b> <b>with</b> a <b>learning</b> <b>disability</b> and confidence about working <b>with</b> <b>children</b> <b>with</b> a <b>learning</b> <b>disability</b> and challenging behaviour, knowledge about the defining criteria for <b>learning</b> <b>disability</b> or knowledge about managing challenging behaviour. CONCLUSION: A half-day training event about <b>learning</b> <b>disability</b> and challenging behaviour significantly improved knowledge about the defining criteria for <b>learning</b> <b>disability</b> but had little impact on increasing knowledge about challenging behaviour in a group of mainstream teaching staff. Teaching staff demonstrated very limited knowledge about <b>learning</b> <b>disability</b> prior to training and demonstrated negative attributions about the causes of challenging behaviour in <b>children</b> <b>with</b> a <b>learning</b> <b>disability,</b> the latter of which was not improved by training. Training also failed to improve attitudes towards inclusion and possible reasons for the current study’s significant and non-significant results are discussed. The clinical and ethical implications of the findings are discussed and suggestions for further research are outlined. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
