The {{concept of}} <b>characterizing</b> of partial algebras by many sorted {{signature}} is introduced, i. e. {{we say that}} a signature S <b>characterizes</b> a partial algebra A {{if there is an}} Salgebra whose sorts form a partition of the carrier of algebra A and operations are formed from operations of A by the partition. The main result is that for any partial algebra there is the minimal many sorted signature which <b>characterizes</b> the algebra.
