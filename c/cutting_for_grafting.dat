40|$|Corneal <b>grafts</b> <b>for</b> Descemet's Stripping Automated Endothelial Keratoplasty are {{commonly}} prepared using mechanical microkeratomes. However, the cuts produced in such way render corneal lenticules that are thinner centrally than peripherally, thus inducing a hyperopic shift. Here we describe a novel device for preparing donor corneal grafts, {{in which a}} single low-energy femtosecond laser system is used as both a light source for optical coherence tomography and <b>for</b> <b>cutting</b> the <b>graft</b> illuminating from the endothelial side. The same laser is first utilized to obtain three-dimensional optical coherence tomography images of the donor tissue for guiding the dissection and obtaining grafts of uniform thickness with no applanation or contact. This device allows an optimal procedure for preparing consistently thin posterior <b>grafts</b> <b>for</b> transplantation...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT Araucaria angustifolia (Brazilian Pine or Araucaria) is a {{potential}} native species to Brazilian forestry. However, a number of challenges and technical restraints still persist, making difficult its expansion as a species for forest plantations, among which the lack of cloning technologies evaluation in field conditions. So the present study aimed to evaluate the potential use of Araucaria plants produced by <b>cuttings</b> and <b>grafting</b> <b>for</b> wood production in comparison to those produced by seeds, by assessing field vigor and establishing a form factor for plantations with equivalent age. Plants from cuttings and seeds were planted in a 3 x 3 m spacing, {{being part of the}} last intended to be rootstocks <b>for</b> <b>grafting.</b> The experiment was conducted in a completely randomized design with three treatments and plots of a plant (one tree plot). Plants from cuttings had higher growth in diameter at breast height (7. 4 ± 2. 41 cm) and total height (4. 2 ± 1. 08 m) at 74 months after planting, followed by grafted plants and from seeds, with similar results. We conclude that cuttings and grafting are potential techniques for Araucaria plants formation for wood production, and, in particular, grafting is recommended by the easiness of in its application, besides the fact that it can be used for seed orchards formation and presents volumetric increase and form factor similar to seedlings...|$|R

40|$|Background: Cytomegalovirus(CMV) is a {{risk factor}} for {{rejection}} and mortality soon after renal transplantation. Little is known about its consequences longer after transplantation. We prospectively investigated whether latent CMV infection {{is a risk}} factor <b>for</b> <b>graft</b> failure and mortality long after transplantation. Material/Methods: Our study included 606 renal transplant recipients(RTR) with a functioning <b>graft</b> <b>for</b> > 1 year. CMV serology was determined using ELISA. RTRs were divided into CMV-seronegative and latent CMV (seropositive + seroconverted). Results: We measured CMV IgG at 6. 0 [2. 6 - 11. 4] years post-transplant. During follow-up(7. 0 [6. 2 - 7. 5] years), 54 (9 %) RTRs experienced graft failure and 137 (23 %) RTRs died. Risk <b>for</b> <b>graft</b> failure and mortality was significantly higher in RTRs with latent CMV compared to CMV-seronegative RTRs (HR= 3. 1, P= 0. 005 and HR= 2. 0, P= 0. 002, respectively). After adjustment for potential confounders, latent CMV infection remained an independent risk factor <b>for</b> <b>graft</b> failure(HR= 4. 6, P= 0. 001), but not for mortality(HR= 1. 4, P= 0. 2). Conclusions: Latent CMV is an independent risk factor <b>for</b> <b>graft</b> failure long after renal transplantation and carries a higher risk <b>for</b> <b>graft</b> failure than <b>for</b> mortality. These findings confirm the notion that latent CMV can be harmful in transplanted kidneys...|$|R

40|$|The {{use of a}} {{pneumatic}} tourniquet {{to facilitate}} limb surgery is often complicated by the de-velopment of tourniquet pain. Various methods {{have been used to}} alleviate this pain, but most have proved unsatisfactory [1]. The local anaesthetic cream EMLA (Astra) (a 5 % eutectic mixture of lignocaine and prilocaine) has been used widely to provide cutaneous analgesia for venepuncture [2] and <b>for</b> <b>cutting</b> split-skin <b>grafts</b> [3]. Despite the considerable areas of skin covered in this application, systemic toxicity has not been reported [3]. The present study was designed to evaluate the effect of EMLA in attenuating tourniquet pain. METHOD AND RESULTS Ten healthy male volunteers (aged 24 - 36 yr) were studied in a double-blind, randomized, placebo controlled, crossover trial. Local Ethics Com-mittee approval was obtained and the volunteers gave informed written consent. Subjects who smoked, were more than 125 % ideal body weight or had a history of diabetes, hypertension, sickle cell disease, skin problems or allergy to local anaesthetic agents were excluded. The study sessions for each subject were 1 week apart, with the exception of two subjects who were studied after an interval of 2 weeks. EMLA 50 - 60 g or a visually and cosmetically identical placebo was applied circumferentially to the non-dominant upper arm and covered by an occlusive dressing 2 h before the study.
