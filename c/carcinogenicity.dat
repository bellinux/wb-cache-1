5|$|The most {{stringent}} {{tests are}} reserved for drugs and foodstuffs. For these, a number of tests are performed, lasting {{less than a month}} (acute), one to three months (subchronic), and more than three months (chronic) to test general toxicity (damage to organs), eye and skin irritancy, mutagenicity, <b>carcinogenicity,</b> teratogenicity, and reproductive problems. The cost of the full complement of tests is several million dollars per substance and it may take three or four years to complete.|$|E
5|$|There {{is little}} {{evidence}} that vanadium or vanadium compounds are reproductive toxins or teratogens. Vanadium pentoxide was reported to be carcinogenic in male rats and in male and female mice by inhalation in an NTP study, although the interpretation of the results has recently been disputed. The <b>carcinogenicity</b> of vanadium has not been determined by the United States Environmental Protection Agency.|$|E
5|$|The International Agency for Research on Cancer has {{classified}} cadmium and cadmium compounds as carcinogenic to humans. Although {{occupational exposure}} to cadmium {{is linked to}} lung and prostate cancer, {{there is still a}} substantial controversy about the <b>carcinogenicity</b> of cadmium in low environmental exposure. Recent data from epidemiological studies suggest that intake of cadmium through diet associates to higher risk of endometrial, breast and prostate cancer as well as to osteoporosis in humans. A recent study has demonstrated that endometrial tissue is characterized by higher levels of cadmium in current and former smoking females.|$|E
5|$|While the {{mutagenic}} and genotoxic {{effects of}} TCDD are sometimes disputed and sometimes confirmed it does foster {{the development of}} cancer. Its main action in causing cancer is cancer promotion; it promotes the <b>carcinogenicity</b> initiated by other compounds. Very high doses may, in addition, cause cancer indirectly; one of the proposed mechanisms is oxidative stress and the subsequent oxygen damage to DNA. There are other explanations such as endocrine disruption or altered signal transduction. The endocrine disrupting activities seem {{to be dependent on}} life stage, being anti-estrogenic when estrogen is present (or in high concentration) in the body, and estrogenic in the absence of estrogen.|$|E
5|$|Cancers can {{be induced}} in animals at many sites. At {{sufficiently}} high doses TCDD has caused cancer in all animals tested. The most sensitive is liver cancer in female rats, {{and this has}} long been a basis for risk assessment. Dose-response of TCDD in causing cancer {{does not seem to be}} linear, and there is a threshold below which it seems to cause no cancer. TCDD is not mutagenic or genotoxic, in other words, it is not able to initiate cancer, and the cancer risk is based on promotion of cancer initiated by other compounds or on indirect effects such as disturbing defense mechanisms of the body e.g. by preventing apoptosis or programmed death of altered cells. <b>Carcinogenicity</b> is associated with tissue damage, and it is often viewed now as secondary to tissue damage.|$|E
5|$|Congenital liver abnormalities, such as Caroli's {{syndrome}} (a {{specific type}} of five recognized choledochal cysts), {{have been associated with}} an approximately 15% lifetime risk of developing cholangiocarcinoma. The rare inherited disorders Lynch syndrome II and biliary papillomatosis have also been found to be associated with cholangiocarcinoma. The presence of gallstones (cholelithiasis) is not clearly associated with cholangiocarcinoma. However, intrahepatic stones (called hepatolithiasis), which are rare in the West but common in parts of Asia, have been strongly associated with cholangiocarcinoma. Exposure to Thorotrast, a form of thorium dioxide which was used as a radiologic contrast medium, has been linked to the development of cholangiocarcinoma as late as 30–40 years after exposure; Thorotrast was banned in the United States in the 1950s due to its <b>carcinogenicity.</b>|$|E
25|$|The National Toxicology Program’s 11th Report on Carcinogens categorizes {{trichloroethylene}} as “reasonably anticipated to {{be a human}} carcinogen”, {{based on}} limited evidence of <b>carcinogenicity</b> from studies in humans and sufficient evidence of <b>carcinogenicity</b> from studies in experimental animals.|$|E

The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) has determined that 1,3-dichloropropene is possibly carcinogenic to humans. The EPA has classified 1,3-dichloropropene as a probable human carcinogen.|$|E

25|$|Endosulfan is {{not listed}} as known, probable, or {{possible}} carcinogen by the EPA, IARC, or other agencies. No epidemiological studies link exposure to endosulfan specifically to cancer in humans, but in vitro assays {{have shown that}} endosulfan can promote proliferation of human breast cancer cells. Evidence of <b>carcinogenicity</b> in animals is mixed.|$|E
25|$|British {{scientist}} James W. Black developed propranolol in the 1960s. In 1988, he {{was awarded}} the Nobel Prize in Medicine for this discovery. Propranolol was inspired by the early β-adrenergic antagonists dichloroisoprenaline and pronethalol. The key difference, which was carried through to essentially all subsequent beta blockers, was the inclusion of an oxymethylene group (-O-CH2-) between the aryl and ethanolamine moieties of pronethalol, greatly increasing the potency of the compound. This also apparently eliminated the <b>carcinogenicity</b> found with pronethalol in animal models.|$|E
25|$|Acrolein is a {{pyrolysis}} {{product that is}} abundant in cigarette smoke. It gives smoke an acrid smell and an irritating, lachrymatory effect and is {{a major contributor to}} its <b>carcinogenicity.</b> Like PAH metabolites, acrolein is also an electrophilic alkylating agent and permanently binds to the DNA base guanine, by a conjugate addition followed by cyclization into a hemiaminal. The acrolein-guanine adduct induces mutations during DNA copying and thus causes cancers {{in a manner similar to}} PAHs. However, acrolein is 1000 times more abundant than PAHs in cigarette smoke and is able to react as is, without metabolic activation. Acrolein has been shown to be a mutagen and carcinogen in human cells. The <b>carcinogenicity</b> of acrolein has been difficult to study by animal experimentation, because it has such a toxicity that it tends to kill the animals before they develop cancer. Generally, compounds able to react by conjugate addition as electrophiles (so-called Michael acceptors after Michael reaction) are toxic and carcinogenic, because they can permanently alkylate DNA, similarly to mustard gas or aflatoxin. Acrolein is only one of them present in cigarette smoke; for example, crotonaldehyde has been found in cigarette smoke. Michael acceptors also contribute to the chronic inflammation present in tobacco disease.|$|E
25|$|Reviews {{have found}} no {{association}} between aspartame and cancer. These reviews have looked at numerous <b>carcinogenicity</b> studies in animals, epidemiologic studies in humans, {{as well as in}} vitro genotoxicity studies. These studies {{have found no}} significant evidence that aspartame causes cancer in animals, damages the genome, or causes cancer in humans at doses currently used. This position is supported by multiple regulatory agencies like the FDA and EFSA as well as scientific bodies such as the National Cancer Institute. Aspartame did not show any DNA-damaging properties either.|$|E
25|$|Nickel {{carbonyl}} poisoning {{is characterized}} by a two-stage illness. The first consists of headaches and chest pain lasting a few hours, usually followed by a short remission. The second phase is a chemical pneumonitis which starts after typically 16 hours with symptoms of cough, breathlessness and extreme fatigue. These reach greatest severity after four days, possibly resulting in death from cardiorespiratory or renal failure. Convalescence is often extremely protracted, often complicated by exhaustion, depression and dyspnea on exertion. Permanent respiratory damage is unusual. The <b>carcinogenicity</b> of Ni(CO)4 is a matter of debate.|$|E
25|$|The {{potential}} {{toxicity of}} DMF has received considerable attention. It is not classified as human carcinogen (A4), {{but it is}} thought to cause birth defects. In some sectors of industry, women are banned from working with DMF. For many reactions, it can be replaced with dimethyl sulfoxide. Most manufacturers of DMF list 'Life' or 'Chronic' as a health hazard in their MSDS since DMF is not readily disposed of by the body. According to IARC, DMF is not classified as to its <b>carcinogenicity</b> to humans, and the United States Environmental Protection Agency does not consider it a cancer risk.|$|E
25|$|Although {{there is}} {{insufficient}} evidence to classify nicotine as a carcinogen, {{there is an}} ongoing debate about whether it functions as a tumor promoter. In vitro studies have associated it with cancer, but <b>carcinogenicity</b> has not been demonstrated in vivo. There is inadequate research to demonstrate that nicotine is associated with cancer in humans, but there is evidence indicating possible oral, esophageal, or pancreatic cancer risks. Nicotine {{in the form of}} nicotine replacement products is less of a cancer risk than smoking. Nicotine replacement products have not been shown to be associated with cancer in the real world.|$|E
25|$|Because of the <b>carcinogenicity</b> of its beta {{radiation}} in the thyroid in small doses, I-131 is rarely used primarily or solely for diagnosis (although {{in the past}} this was more common due to this isotope's relative ease of production and low expense). Instead the more purely gamma-emitting radioiodine iodine-123 is used in diagnostic testing (nuclear medicine scan of the thyroid). The longer half-lived iodine-125 is also occasionally used when a longer half-life radioiodine is needed for diagnosis, and in brachytherapy treatment (isotope confined in small seed-like metal capsules), where the low-energy gamma radiation without a beta component makes iodine-125 useful. The other radioisotopes of iodine are never used in brachytherapy.|$|E
25|$|The {{health effects}} of smoking have been {{significant}} {{for the development of}} the science of epidemiology. As the mechanism of <b>carcinogenicity</b> is radiomimetic or radiological, the effects are stochastic. Definite statements can be made only on the relative increased or decreased probabilities of contracting a given disease. For a particular individual, it is impossible to definitively prove a direct causal link between exposure to a radiomimetic poison such as tobacco smoke and the cancer that follows; such statements can only be made at the aggregate population level. Tobacco companies have capitalized on this philosophical objection and exploited the doubts of clinicians, who consider only individual cases, on the causal link in the stochastic expression of the toxicity as actual disease.|$|E
25|$|The BfR {{responded that}} IARC {{reviewed}} only {{a selection of}} what they had reviewed earlier, and argued that other studies, including a cohort study called Agricultural Health Study, do not support the classification. The IARC report did not include unpublished industry-funded studies, including one completed by the IARC panel leader, Aaron Blair, who stated that agency policy required that he not consider this study. The agency's international protocol dictates that only published studies be used in classifications of <b>carcinogenicity,</b> since national regulatory agencies including the EPA have allowed agrochemical corporations to conduct their own unpublished research, which may be biased in support of their profit motives. Monsanto called the IARC report biased and said it wanted it to be retracted. The corporation started a case against California's carcinogen classification in 2016, and lost the suit in March 2017.|$|E
25|$|He {{contributed to}} {{studies on the}} <b>carcinogenicity</b> of 4-nitroquinoline-N-oxide derivatives, the {{production}} of plant tumors by a nitrosamine. He also studied metabolism and protein binding of polynuclears {{and the effect of}} the binding o DNA replication and transcription, testing the effect of various carcinogens on the hatching of shrimp eggs. From the mid-1960s onwards, Bửu Hội increasingly turned his focus to the structural facets of polynuclears which determine their ability to induce microsomal enzyme synthesis, in particular involving zoxazolamine and dicoumarol hydroxylation. Aside from his study of fundamental organic chemistry, chemical carcinogenesis and chemotherapy of leprosy and tuberculosis, Bửu Hội's team also conducted research into {{a wide range of issues}} of biological and therapeutic interest. These included the synthesis and testing anti-inflammatory non-steroid compounds, substituted sex hormones, anti-coagulant substances and their potentiation, antidiabetic agents, treatment of hypertension by methyl-DOPA, antioxidants and the chemophylaxy of aging and the toxicity of dioxine among others.|$|E

This {{is supported by the}} positive results of the NTP bioassays with Ni sub-sulfide and Ni oxide in rats and mice. The human and animal data consistently indicate a lack of <b>carcinogenicity</b> via the oral route of exposure and limit the <b>carcinogenicity</b> of nickel compounds to respiratory tumours after inhalation. Nickel metal is classified as a suspect carcinogen; there is consistency between the absence of increased respiratory cancer risks in workers predominantly exposed to metallic nickel and the lack of respiratory tumours in a rat lifetime inhalation <b>carcinogenicity</b> study with nickel metal powder. In the rodent inhalation studies with various nickel compounds and nickel metal, increased lung inflammations with and without bronchial lymph node hyperplasia or fibrosis were observed. In rat studies, oral ingestion of water soluble nickel salts can trigger perinatal mortality effects in pregnant animals. Whether these effects are relevant to humans is unclear as epidemiological studies of highly exposed female workers have not shown adverse developmental toxicity effects.|$|E
