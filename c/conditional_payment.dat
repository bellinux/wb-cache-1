Either payment orders or <b>conditional</b> <b>payment</b> orders are assumed to be irrevocable unless otherwise stated. Payment orders with conditions may be established after signing of a contract and posting of a letter of credit or other financial instrument with the paying bank but are never put in place prior to contract execution because of the risk that the contract will not materialize.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Conditional e-cash or {{conditional}} e-payments {{have been}} introduced by Shi et al. as the means for enabling electronic payments {{to be based on}} the outcome of a certain condition not known in advance. In this framework, a payer obtains an electronic coin and can transfer it to a payee under a certain condition. Once the outcome of the condition is known, if it was favorable to the payee, the payee can deposit the coin; otherwise, the payer keeps the money. In this work, we formalize <b>conditional</b> <b>payments</b> and give a scheme to achieve conditional e-payments that outperforms the original solution in several respects. ...|$|R

Any significant Medicare lien can dominate settlement negotiations because the Medicare Secondary Payer (MSP) statute grants Medicare a firstpriority right to prompt reimbursement for all pre-settlement <b>conditional</b> <b>payments</b> and wields the threat of double-damages for failing to fully consider Medicare’s interests. If the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) continues the trend of extending the MSP statute’s reach, Medicareeligible recipients of personal injury settlements risk losing much more of their settlement proceeds, not only to satisfy existing Medicare liens, but also to pay for future medical expenses {{that would otherwise be}} covered by Medicare.

40|$|The {{concept of}} {{payments}} for ecosystem services (PES) {{is probably the}} most promising innovation in conservation since Rio 1992, slowly but certainly to expand in the tropics. In a global context of stagnating or even decreasing public funding for biodiversity conservation, PES have the potential both to raise some new funds, and to absorb more efficiently money previously spent otherwise. The most novel and persuasive feature of PES lies in its “businesslike” <b>conditional</b> <b>payment</b> form, which differs from traditional conservation projects. The most promising entry point for international PES transfers for biodiversity interests seems to be to piggyback on the currently revived debate on reducing emissions from deforestation and degradation (REDD). The novel idea here would be to make agreements at the nation-state level, either bilaterally or multilaterally, and either within or outside the Kyoto framework. However, {{to take advantage of this}} opportunity, biodiversity conservation and forest stakeholders would need to be more proactive in the REDD debate than we have seen so far...|$|E

Catalysing Impact Deal Flow in East Africa explores the causes of this constraint and provides recommendations for donors seeking to increase impact investing volumes (deal flow). Top Takeaways Two key challenges are constraining the growth of impact investing in East Africa: 1) The pairing of investors and enterprises ("matching challenge"); and 2) enterprises' lack of readiness to take on investment ("preparation challenge"). Local service providers (consulting and advisory firms) that help enterprises raise capital and build capacity are already addressing both the matching and the preparation challenges. However, these service providers themselves face constraints in scaling their services due to delayed and <b>conditional</b> <b>payment</b> of fees from enterprises resulting from a deferred success fee model.

40|$|Assessing global tendencies and {{impacts of}} <b>conditional</b> <b>payments</b> for {{environmental}} services (PES) programs is challenging {{because of their}} heterogeneity, and scarcity of comparative studies. This meta-study systematizes 55 PES schemes worldwide in a quantitative database. Using categorical principal component analysis to highlight clustering patterns, we reconfirm frequently hypothesized differences {{between public and private}} PES schemes, but also identify diverging patterns between commercial and non-commercial private PES vis-à-vis their service focus, area size, and market orientation. When do these PES schemes likely achieve significant environmental additionality? Using binary logistical regression, we find additionality to be positively influenced by three theoretically recommended PES 'best design' features: spatial targeting, payment differentiation, and strong conditionality, alongside some contextual controls (activity paid for and implementation time elapsed). Our results thus stress the preeminence of customized design over operational characteristics when assessing what determines the outcomes of PES implementation. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|R

40|$|We {{examine how}} mehr, a <b>conditional</b> <b>payment</b> from husbands to wives {{in the event}} of divorce, and dowry, a {{transfer}} from bride families to grooms at the time of marriage, have evolved through natural shocks. We develop a model of marriage market in which dowry acts as a groom price, whereas mehr serves to deter inefficient divorces. Our comparative statics results show that the value of mehr is increasing (decreasing) in shocks that raise (lower) income while the effect of such shocks on dowry is ambiguous; even if dowry increases (decreases), the magnitude will be smaller than the corresponding increase (decrease) in mehr. We then exploit several natural experiments in Bangladesh, that include the Green Revolution around the 1960 s, the Independence War in 1971 and the famine of 1974, to explain fluctuations in the value of mehr and dowry observed in Muslim marriages. Using two household survey datasets in Bangladesh, we find support for our theoretical predictions. To rule out alternative explanations, in particular the effect of legal changes, we exploit another natural experiment from the Indian state of West Bengal that experienced the same natural shocks, but not any of the legal shocks affecting Bangladesh. These results demonstrate that natural shocks may influence the evolution of social institutions...|$|E

40|$|As carbon sinks, forests play a {{critical}} role in helping to mitigate the growing threat from anthropogenic climate change. Forest carbon offsets transacted between GHG emitters in industrialised countries and sellers in developing countries have emerged as a useful climate policy tool. A model is developed that investigates the role of incentives in forestry carbon sequestration contracts. It considers the optimal design of contracts to ensure landowner participation and hence, permanence in forest carbon sinks in a context of uncertain opportunity costs and incomplete contract enforcement. The optimal contract is driven by the quality of the institutional framework in which the contract is executed, in particular, as it relates to contract enforcement. Stronger institutional frameworks tend to distort the seller 2 ̆ 019 s effort upwards away from the full enforcement outcome. This also leads to greater amounts of carbon sequestered and higher <b>conditional</b> <b>payments</b> made to the seller.

However, the use of blockchain in mobile environments is still limited because the mining process consumes too much computing and energy resources on mobile devices. Edge computing offered by the Edge Computing Service Provider can be adopted as a viable solution for offloading the mining tasks from the mobile devices, i. e., miners, in the mobile blockchain environment. However, a mechanism needs to be designed for edge resource allocation to maximize the revenue for the Edge Computing Service Provider and to ensure incentive compatibility and individual rationality is still open. In this paper, we develop an optimal auction based on deep learning for the edge resource allocation. Specifically, we construct a multi-layer neural network architecture based on an analytical solution of the optimal auction. The neural networks first perform monotone transformations of the miners' bids. Then, they calculate allocation and <b>conditional</b> <b>payment</b> rules for the miners. We use valuations of the miners as the data training to adjust parameters of the neural networks so as to optimize the loss function which is the expected, negated revenue of the Edge Computing Service Provider.

30|$|While the {{national}} park service, TANAPA, does maintain some benefit-sharing programmes with surrounding communities, these are neither of the scale nor of the type needed to positively influence neighbouring pastoralists to support ecosystem-scale conservation objectives through the necessary land use choices. For example, Tarangire National Park provided average benefits (usually {{in the form of}} contributions to district or village-level social service or infrastructure projects) to Simanjiro District of $ 30, 470; at this time, the park's annual income from tourism was around $ 1.5 million/year (reaching $ 2.1 million by 2005 and now consistently above $ 2 million/year) (Sachedina and Nelson 2010). This represents an investment - designed explicitly to encourage support for conservation among neighbouring communities - of about 2 % of revenues in what {{is the single most important}} dispersal and breeding area for much of the wildlife found in Tarangire. As Sachedina and Nelson (2010) describe, it is not only the limited amount of funds invested in neighbouring communities, but the way these funds are provided as in effect unconditional donations to development projects that are not in any way tied to local land use decisions or conservation actions, that undermines their impact. By contrast, an investment by a coalition of private tourism operators of a limited amount of funding in a conditional agreement with one village on the Simanjiro plains which agreed not to farm within its traditional grazing area has reinforced local incentives not to convert key wildlife habitat to agriculture (Nelson et al. 2010). In order to protect its own long-term financial interests in wildlife and tourism, it would be advisable for TANAPA to make more targeted investments in supporting pastoralist land uses in areas surrounding its parks and to use <b>conditional</b> <b>payment</b> for ecosystem services agreements to achieve such ends.|$|E
40|$|One of the {{fundamental}} considerations for exporters in international trade transactions is the aspect of payment. In the context of financial risk management, Letters of Credit enable the exporter to substitute the credit risk of the buyer with that of his bank. The Letter of Credit is a <b>conditional</b> <b>payment</b> guarantee, relying on one hundred per cent documentary accuracy to trigger the payment. Less than one hundred per cent compliance means {{the loss of the}} payment guarantee. Non-compliance is a significant problem as, according to the International Chamber of Commerce, worldwide documentary discrepancy rates against Letter of Credit transactions have been estimated to be between sixty to seventy per cent. The mechanics of Letter of Credit transactions comprise a complex web of interactions between banks, traders and their service providers, providing a fertile ground for discrepancies and existing literature acknowledges this world-wide problem. In the UK, in 2000, losses were estimated to be AUD 305 million (£ 113) through non-compliant documents being presented under Letters of Credit – this amount did not include lost opportunities and cash flow problems. In the same year, a separate USA study of Letter of Credit transactions confirmed the high discrepancy rate, but also claimed that as long as buyers want the goods discrepancies did not translate into financial losses. The findings were refuted by others. It is the potential loss of revenue caused by the mismanagement of risk that is foremost in this research. It is estimated that the annual value of Letter of Credit business for manufacturing exports to ASEAN is approximately AUD 3. 5 billion, with losses estimated to be upwards of AUD 920 million. This research aims to assist in greater understanding of the usage of Letters of Credit and the dynamics that underpin these transactions leading to a greater understanding of the interactions between Australian exporters and ASEAN importers...|$|E
40|$|Given that Commercial Law {{tries to}} balance {{considerations}} of certainty and fairness, {{it follows that}} the law relating to letters of credit, as part of the general body of Commercial Law, involves a similar balancing exercise. This thesis argues that this balance should employ five basic principles, namely: (1) party autonomy (freedom and sanctity of contract); (2) certainty; (3) flexibility; (4) fairness; and (5) good faith. The thesis begins with a brief introduction to the objectives of the study. Chapter one introduces readers to the basis of letters of credit and the historical background. The five basic principles and the tensions between them are examined in chapter two. Chapter three discusses briefly how these five basic principles are applied to the law regulating letters of credit. Chapter four focuses on disputes arising between the issuing bank and the beneficiary, evaluating in particular the principle of independency and the fraud exception. The most important doctrine in the law of letters of credit, the doctrine of strict compliance is explored in chapter five. Disputes between the issuing bank and the applicant are examined in chapter six and the standard of compliance governing the reimbursement agreement (whether strict compliance or bifurcated compliance) is evaluated {{in the light of the}} basic principles. Chapter seven, deals with disputes between the applicant (buyer) and the beneficiary (seller), evaluating the law on the nature of payment (whether absolute-conditional) in the light of the basic principles. The concluding chapter draws on the key points of the thesis to put forward an overview as to the adequacy of the law. Essentially, the law founds itself on two cornerstone principles, the independency principle and the doctrine of strict compliance. Whereas the former protects the interests of sellers, the latter protects the interests of buyers. In each case, however, the principle designed for protection (and certainty) can be turned into a principle licensing unfairness-in one case, shielding fraudulent sellers, and in the other case shielding bad faith buyers. In the modern law, the central problem is to find the right way of addressing and balancing these competing considerations. The main proposals offered in the thesis recommend that the qualified strict compliance test be adopted and where actual fraud has taken place or is suspected on reasonable grounds by the bank, the fraud exception should operate. In addition, and with a view to striking the right balance between certainty and fairness, it is suggested that punitive damages be awarded exceptionally in cases where good faith and gross negligence have taken place, that the bifurcated compliance standard should be adopted where the issuer has been considered to have acted in good faith and without harming the customer, and that <b>conditional</b> <b>payment</b> be adopted in relation to payment under documentary credit. It should be emphasised that the position argued for in this thesis is that there should be some marginal adjustment to the ruling doctrines. No modification should be considered, however, where the essential certainty of the law would be jeopardised...|$|E

40|$|Despite recent {{success in}} {{reducing}} forest {{loss in the}} Brazilian Amazon, additional forest conservation efforts, for example, through ‘Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation’ (REDD+), could significantly contribute to global climate-change mitigation. Economic incentives, such as payments for environmental services could promote conservation, but deforestation often occurs on land without crucial tenure-security prerequisites. Improving the enforcement of existing regulatory disincentives thus represents {{an important element of}} Brazil's anti-deforestation action plan. However, conservation law enforcement costs and benefits have been much less studied than for <b>conditional</b> <b>payments.</b> We develop a conceptual framework and a spatially explicit model to analyze field-based regulatory enforcement in the Brazilian Amazon. We validate our model, based on historical deforestation and enforcement mission data from 2003 to 2008. By simulating the current conservation law enforcement practice, we analyze the costs of liability establishment and legal coercion for alternative conservation targets, and evaluate corresponding income impacts. Our findings suggest that spatial patterns of both deforestation and inspection costs markedly influence enforcement patterns and their income effects. Field-based enforcement is a highly cost-effective forest conservation instrument from a regulator's point of view, but comes at high opportunity costs for land users. Payments for environmental services could compensate costs, but will increase budget outlays vis-à-vis a command-and-control dominated strategy. Both legal and institutional challenges have to be overcome to make conservation payments work at a larger scale. Decision-makers may have to innovatively combine incentive and disincentive-based policy instruments in order to make tropical forest conservation both financially viable and socially compatible...|$|R
