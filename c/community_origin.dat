In 1961, reports of nosocomial S. aureus resistant to methicillin, the drug of choice against penicillin-resistant strains, required new alternatives and vancomycin started being used to treat infections caused by methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA).

40|$|Over {{the past}} two decades many {{developing}} countries have implemented comprehensive reforms of their tax administrations in order to increase revenue and curb corruption. This paper examines recent experiences in the fight against corruption in the Uganda Revenue Authority (URA). It argues that the technocratic remedies supported by donors have underplayed the degree to which progress in tax administration depends upon a thorough ‘cultural change’ in the public service. The motives of individual actors are often inextricably tied to the interests of the social groups to which they belong. In the URA patronage runs through networks grounded on ties of kinship and <b>community</b> <b>origin.</b> As such, people recognize the benefits of large extended families and strong kinship ties, even as their social and economic aspirations may be indisputably modern. This implies that such social relations may undermine formal bureaucratic structures and positions. If these problems, which are rooted in social norms and patterns of behaviour rather than administrative features, are overlooked, the result may be to distort incentives. As a consequence, the government’s commitment to reforming the tax administration may also be undermined...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} recent experiences from sub-Saharan Africa {{in combating}} corruption in customs. It argues that integrity reforms {{have been too}} focused on reforming formal institutions, and too {{little attention has been}} paid to the political economy of reforms and the role of informal institutions. In many customs administrations patronage runs through networks grounded on ties of kinship and <b>community</b> <b>origin.</b> Patronage undermines the implementation of policies and rules-of-law more generally. Opportunities for accessing illegal income tend to become institutionalised, leading to the creation of parallel organisations within customs, in which posts are valued essentially on the basis of the illicit gains to which they provide access. In such settings, customs officers are torn between compliance with abstract bureaucratic norms and concrete expectations of their networks of social belonging. Accordingly, policy initiatives should focus more on measures that reduce the possibility or attraction of favouritism versus acting in the general public interest. This calls for anti-corruption efforts based on thorough analysis of the political economy of customs, in order to understand the interests and incentives of key player...|$|E

Sense of Virtual Community, and Virtual <b>Community</b> <b>Origin</b> Computer-mediated community environments need commitment of their members just like the traditional environment, {{based on the fact}} that we understand virtual community to be “a community extended via emerging technologies. ” Among the four elements (membership, influence, integration, and emotional connection) that McMillan & Chavis [1986] regarded as the components of sense of community, membership and influence are considered as common perception factors in both the virtual and traditional communities. Reflecting the unique characteristics of the virtual space, we introduce a new dimension of immersion, using an expanded concept of flow [Csikszentimihalyi, 1975; Hoffman & Novak, 1996]. Thus, sense of virtual community is treated as having three dimensions: (1) membership−people experience feelings of belonging to their virtual community, (2) influence−people influence other members or their community, and (3) immersion−people feel the state of flow during virtual community navigation. We define sense of virtual community as the psychological state of perceiving thre...|$|E

40|$|Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} bacterial pathogens based on its incidence and the severity of its associated infections. In addition, severe MRSA infections can occur in hospitalised patients or healthy individuals from the community. Studies have shown the infiltration of MRSA isolates of <b>community</b> <b>origin</b> into hospitals and variants of hospital-associated MRSA have caused infections in the community. These rapid epidemiological changes represent a challenge for the molecular characterisation of such bacteria as a hospital or community-acquired pathogen. To efficiently control the spread of MRSA, it is important to promptly detect the mecA gene, which is the determinant of methicillin resistance, using a polymerase chain reaction-based test or other rapidly and accurate methods that detect the mecA product penicillin-binding protein (PBP) 2 a or PBP 2 &# 8217;. The recent emergence of MRSA isolates that harbour a mecA allotype, i. e., the mecC gene, infecting animals and humans has raised an additional and significant issue regarding MRSA laboratory detection. Antimicrobial drugs for MRSA therapy are becoming depleted and vancomycin is still the main choice in many cases. In this review, we present an overview of MRSA infections in community and healthcare settings with focus on recent changes in the global epidemiology, with special reference to the MRSA picture in Brazil...|$|E

40|$|Objecitve: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the prevalence of isolates of Staphylococcus aureus in workers at a hospital in Cali. Materials and methods: A descriptive study was conducted with samples of nasal swabs, skin smears to 30 health care workers. Phenotypic characterization of isolates was based on susceptibility antibiogram testing and pcr amplification of the identified mecA and agr genes. The origin of isolates was established by analysis of agr gene, identifying the agr groups. Results: Eleven (26. 7 %) workers were colonized with S. aureus. The frequency of S. aureus was higher in health care personnel who were in the operating room (20 %; OR = 2. 077; P> 0. 05). Four antibiotypes were identified, this feature is compatible with community clones that have proven to be highly diverse with a large capacity to spread in the community. 36. 4 % of the isolates were resistant to cefotaxime and/or oxacillin, suggestive mrsa phenotype in these isolated the mecA gene was identified. Agr i was found primarily among isolates metillicin-sensitive S. aureus (mssa), compatible with <b>community</b> <b>origin,</b> and mrsa isolates belong to agr ii, with hospital waste.

40|$|Background: While methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) {{originally}} {{was associated with}} healthcare, distinct strains later emerged in patients with no prior hospital contact. The epidemiology of MRSA continues to evolve. Methods: To characterize the current epidemiology of MRSA-colonized patients entering a hospital serving both rural and urban communities, we interviewed patients with MRSA-positive admission nasal swabs between August 2009 and March 2010. We applied hospitalization risk factor, antimicrobial resistance phenotype, and multi-locus sequence genotype (MLST) classification schemes to 94 case-patients. Results: By MLST analysis, we identified 15 strains with two dominant clonal complexes (CCs) –CC 5 (51 isolates), historically associated with hospitals, and CC 8 (27 isolates), historically of <b>community</b> <b>origin.</b> Among patients with CC 5 isolates, 43 % reported no history of hospitalization within the past six months; for CC 8, 67 % reported the same. Classification by hospitalization risk factor did not correlate strongly with genotypic classification. Sensitivity of isolates to ciprofloxacin, clindamycin, or amikacin {{was associated with the}} CC 8 genotype; however, among CC 8 strains, 59 % were resistant to ciprofloxacin, 15 % to clindamycin, and 15 % to amikacin. Conclusions: Hospitalization history was not a strong surrogate for the CC 5 genotype. Conversely, patients with a history of hospitalization were identified with the CC 8 genotype.

40|$|In Italy, {{although}} the number of cases of legionellosis notified to the health authorities has significantly increased in recent years, the incidence is still believed to be underestimated. To verify the true frequency and identify the sources of infection, an active clinical-environmental surveillance program was instituted in three hospital facilities in Southern Italy. Between January 2001 and March 2005, a total of 1000 patients admitted to the three hospitals with a diagnosis of pneumonia were enrolled. The urinary antigen and anti-Legionella antibody titre were assayed in each subject, and direct searches for the microorganism were made in biological specimens. Legionellosis was found to be present in 5. 9 % of the patients. For each of the cases of legionellosis, microbiological surveys were made of the water supply in the public and/or private facilities involved. Overall, 197 water samples of hospital origin and 218 of <b>community</b> <b>origin</b> were analysed: Legionella spp was isolated in 44. 2 and 36. 7 % of the cases, respectively. Comparison of our data with those of the routine surveillance system for the same area (only 7 cases during the period 1997 - 2000), showed that the frequency of legionellosis is grossly underestimated in Southern Italy. It is therefore necessary to set up more rigorous controls in both hospital and community facilities, so that timely preventive measures can be taken to avoid any further spread of the disease...|$|E

This study aimed to investigate clinical and transoesophageal echocardiography (TEE) characteristics in predicting embolism and six-month mortality. In this observational cohort study, 216 patients with definite left-sided IE, according to the modified Duke criteria, were prospectively recruited. All patients underwent TEE. 'Any embolism' was defined as embolism before or after initiation of antimicrobial therapy; 'new embolism' included embolism after initiation of antimicrobial therapy. Sixty-two of 216 patients (29 %) experienced any embolism. New embolism occurred in 12 patients (6 %), 7 of which were postoperative. Factors significantly associated with any embolism were <b>community</b> <b>origin</b> of IE and the etiologic microorganism, in particular staphylococci and nonviridans streptococci.

Working along a steep natural gradient of soil fertility in a Costa Rican tropical dry forest, we examined how soil nutrients affect plant–microbe interactions using two complementary approaches. First, we measured mycorrhizal colonization of roots and soil P availability in 18 permanent plots spanning the soil fertility gradient. We measured root production, root colonization by mycorrhizal fungi, phosphatase activity and Bray P {{in each of}} 144 soil cores. Next, in a full-factorial manipulation of soil type and microbial <b>community</b> <b>origin,</b> tree seedlings of Albizia guachapele and Swietenia macrophylla were grown in sterilized high-, intermediate- and low-fertility soils paired with microbial inoculum from each soil type. Seedling growth, biomass allocation and root colonization by mycorrhizas were quantified after 2 mo. In the field, root colonization by mycorrhizal fungi was unrelated to soil phosphorus across a five-fold gradient of P availability. In the shadehouse, inoculation with soil microbes had either neutral or positive effects on plant growth, suggesting that positive effects of mycorrhizal symbionts outweighed negative effects of soil pathogens. The presence of soil microbes had a greater effect on plant biomass than variation in soil nutrient concentrations (although both effects were modest), and plant responses to mycorrhizal inoculation were not dependent on soil nutrients. Taken together, our results emphasize that soil microbial communities can influence plant growth and morphology independently of soil fertility...|$|E

40|$|AbstractEscherichia coli clonal group A (CgA) causes {{disease in}} humans. This {{is the first}} study {{investigating}} the prevalence of CgA among E. coli from non-urine, extraintestinal infections in a northern European country. E. coli blood (n = 196) and paired urine (n = 195) isolates from the same patients with bacteraemia of urinary tract origin were analysed. The isolates were collected from January 2003 through May 2005 at four hospitals in Copenhagen, Denmark. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) patterns, antimicrobial resistance and patient characteristics were determined for all CgA isolates; presence of virulence-associated genes (VAGs) and serotypes were determined for the blood CgA isolates. Thirty blood isolates (15 %) belonged to CgA. CgA blood isolates were associated with female patients and sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim resistance and they harboured a distinctive VAG profile. The blood and urine isolates from each pair {{were found to be}} related in 26 of 27 CgA blood/urine pairs, confirming a urinary tract origin of infection. Furthermore, a relationship between the PFGE patterns of CgA blood/urine isolates and CgA isolates from UTI patients in general practice and a CgA isolate from a community-dwelling human reported previously, was found, suggesting a <b>community</b> <b>origin</b> of CgA. The finding of CgA strains in 15 % of the E. coli bloodstream infections with a urinary tract origin in Denmark suggests that CgA constitutes an important clonal lineage among extraintestinal pathogenic E. coli.

40|$|We {{studied the}} {{evolution}} of resistance to quinolones in Escherichia coli from 1992 to 1997 in Barcelona, Spain. An increasing proportion of quinolone-resistant E. coli (QREC) infections was observed. QREC strains were more common in patients with nosocomial infections but also increased in patients with community-acquired infections (9 % in 1992 to 17 % in 1996). Seventy (12 %) of 572 episodes of E. coli bacteremia were due to QREC. Factors significantly associated with QREC bacteremia were the presence of underlying disease, recent exposure to antibiotics, and bacteremia of unknown origin. In the multivariate analysis, only prior exposure to antimicrobial agents (P < 0. 001; odds ratio [OR] = 2), specifically, to quinolones (P < 0. 001; OR = 14), {{and the presence of}} a urinary catheter (P < 0. 001; OR = 2) were significantly associated with QREC bacteremia. Among 16 QREC isolates from cultures of blood of <b>community</b> <b>origin</b> selected at random, 13 different pulsed-field gel electrophoresis patterns were recognized, showing the genetic diversity of these isolates and in turn indicating the independent emergence of QREC in the community. The prevalence of QREC in the feces of healthy people was unexpectedly high (24 % in adults and 26 % in children). A survey of the prevalence of QREC of avian and porcine origin revealed a very high proportion of QREC in animal feces (up to 90 % of chickens harbored QREC).

40|$|Introduction Infections {{caused by}} methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) present the growing {{problem in the}} whole world. Carriage of MRSA is most {{frequent}} in the nose, and medical students come in contact both with patients and different persons in the community. Therefore, they may be significant for the transmission of MRSA from hospitals to out- of-hospital communities and vice versa. Objective. The {{aim of this study}} was to establish the carriage rate among students of the second, third and fourth year of study at the School of Medicine in Belgrade and to analyze their genotypic and phenotypic characteristics. Methods. In total 533 nasal samples were taken. The samples were incubated in Trypcase-soy broth supplemented with 6. 5 % NaCl, and thereafter the swabs were inoculated on mannitol salt agar supplemented with 2 µg/mL of oxacillin. The presence of nuc, mecA and Panton-Valentine leukocidin genes was examined by PCR. The characteristics of the MRSA strains were determined using: antibiotic susceptibility testing by Vitek 2 System, SCCmec, agr typing and MLST. Results. MRSA was isolated from two of 533 investigated samples (0. 37 %). MRSA were isolated from the students of the second and third year of study. Profiles of strains were: ST 80 (SCCmec type IV, agr type 3) and ST 152 (SCCmec type V, agr type 1). MRSA strains were multiresistant. Conclusion. The nasal carriage rate of MRSA in population of medical students of the first year of study in Belgrade is low.
