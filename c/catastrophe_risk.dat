2500|$|On August 4, the {{government}} of Belize declared a 30-day state of emergency. The government focused their initial disaster response on search and rescue missions, medical care, helping storm victims, cleaning debris from roads, and restoring utilities. The country's Minister of Works sent employees to clear blocked highways, and {{the government}} hired residents to help clean the streets from debris. Workers quickly restored 75% of the power outages within a day of the hurricane's passage, which increased to 99% by August11. All emergency shelters closed on August12, and the remaining displaced families were provided rent-free lodging {{for up to three}} months. The National Relief and Supplies Management Committee provided food, water, cleaning supplies, tarps, and mattresses to affected residents, helping 8,000people by August10. Damage to water systems resulted in decreased water pressure in buildings, possibly contaminating the nation's water supply. As a result, the Health Ministry advised residents to treat drinking water, and officials worked to repair water systems in the week after the storm's passage. The Belize Water Service sent a truck to the Old Northern Highway. About 90% of residents in damaged houses enacted their own repairs, with the help of neighbors. To assist with disaster relief, the European Union donated [...] to Belize through the Disaster Relief Emergency Fund of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies. Taiwan sent US$100,000 to the country. The Inter-American Development Bank provided US$200,000 to Belize to purchase food, medicine, and supplies to rebuild. Belize Telemedia Limited also donated US$50,000 toward disaster relief, and Norwegian Cruise Line donated BZ$100,000. The Belize government received US$261,073 from the Caribbean <b>Catastrophe</b> <b>Risk</b> Insurance Facility, having first bought an excess rainfall policy in June 2016. UNICEF acted as the primary coordinating agency for the United Nations, its first emergency in that capacity.

40|$|This paper proposes an {{integrated}} {{risk management plan}} for <b>catastrophe</b> <b>risks</b> in the European Union, consisting of three layers.

This layer would in turn be supported by the European Group of National Catastrophe Organizations (EUROCAT), a new organization operating {{under the auspices of}} the European Commission. An approach that utilizes a pan-European reinsurance program is proven to be the most efficient solution for minimizing the total cost of <b>catastrophe</b> <b>risks</b> in the European Union. EUROCAT would be a reinsurer of last resort and provide reinsurance to qualified state or regional catastrophe insurance funds. Member-state funds would be required to adopt adequate disaster response and management mechanisms and enforce reasonable building code, land use, and mitigation efforts to minimize the amount of insured losses. As the reinsurance premiums charged by EUROCAT would be risk-based, the pricing mechanism would be used to encourage active development and enforcement of these standards. ...|$|R

40|$|Natural catastrophes attract {{regularly}} {{the attention}} of media and have {{become a source of}} public concern. From a financial viewpoint, natural <b>catastrophes</b> represent idiosyncratic <b>risks,</b> diversifiable at the world level. But for reasons analyzed in this paper reinsurance markets are unable to cope with this risk completely. Insurance-linked securities, such as cat bonds, have been issued to complete the international risk transfer process, but their development is disappointing so far. This paper argues that downside risk aversion and ambiguity aversion explain the limited success of cat bonds. Hybrid cat bonds, combining the transfer of cat risk with protection against a stock market crash, are proposed to complete the market. Using the concept of market modified risk measure, the paper shows that replacing simple cat bonds with hybrid cat bonds would lead to an increase in market volume.

40|$|This article {{analyzed}} {{the impact of}} risk perception, risk attitude, and other farmer personal and farm characteristics on the actual purchase of catastrophe insurance by Dutch dairy and arable farmers. The specific catastrophe insurance types considered were hail–fire–storm insurance for buildings, disability insurance, crop insurance against hail, storm, and brown rot, and insurance against epidemic animal disease outbreaks. The results suggested that risk perception was a significant variable that influenced purchase of catastrophe insurance by dairy and arable farmers, whereas risk attitude was significant only in arable farming. <b>Catastrophe</b> <b>risks</b> {{can be defined as}} events with low probability of occurrence(rare events) leading to major and typically irreversible losses with poten-tially adverse impact on business results (Chichilinsky; Vose). Rarity and severity are typically associated with catastrophe risks: the more severe a risk, the rarer it usually will tend to be, and vice versa (Frohwein, Lambert, and Haimes). Catas-trophic events can thus inflict considerable losses on many stakeholders of private businesses (insurers, re-insurers, banks, etc.) and society (government, tax-payers, households). In agriculture <b>catastrophe</b> <b>risks</b> result in heavy losses for farms. For example, arable farmers are exposed to extreme meteorological events, such as heavy pre-cipitation, excessive heat, drought, hail, storm, and frost, which may result in potential damage to crops (Langeveld et al.). In dairy farming, epidemic diseases, such as FMD (foot-and-mouth disease) and BSE (bovine spongiform encephalopa-thy), cause severe economic losses (Huirne et al.).
