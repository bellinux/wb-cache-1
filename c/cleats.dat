5|$|Dark Forces {{gameplay}} expands on the FPS {{standards set}} by Doom in 1993, and features gameplay elements that are now common in the FPS genre. These include the ability to look up and down, duck, and jump. A variety of power-ups are {{made available to the}} player, including health, shields, weapons and ammunition. The game also features several non-combat items to aid the player. The head lamp illuminates the area in front of the player, but will reveal the player's position to enemies in dark rooms. Ice <b>cleats</b> provide traction in icy areas, and an air mask protects the player from areas with toxic atmosphere.

5|$|Similarly, modern {{equipment}} {{was developed to}} reduce injuries. The football helmet, although a scapegoat for concussions, serves as effective protection against more dangerous injuries like skull fractures. The modern helmet traces its roots back to the leather helmets used by football players in the early 1900s {{to protect themselves from}} head injuries. Helmets later evolved to be made of hard plastic, and a facemask was added to protect players from sustaining facial injuries. Many players also wear mouthguards to prevent injuries to their teeth and tongues; at some levels, such as the NCAA, the use of a mouthguard is mandatory. Football players wear a number of pads to protect themselves – shoulder pads are the most important pads, protecting the shoulder and sternum, but thigh pads, hip pads, tail pads, and knee pads are also used. Many quarterbacks wear flak jackets to protect their ribcage. <b>Cleats</b> come in a number of lengths, with players choosing which cleat to use based on the playing field – on artificial turf, for example, players prefer a shorter cleat to prevent their feet from digging into the ground and risking injury, while longer <b>cleats</b> are generally used on fields that are wet or slippery to provide better traction. Athletic cups are not typically used at the professional level, because athletic cups tend to make it harder to move and there is an unwritten code among players not to target the groin area. Additionally, studies have shown that proper conditioning techniques, fitness routines and exercise routines, as well as high-quality equipment and coaching, can reduce the risk of injury among players.|$|E

40|$|The mechanisms, {{by which}} the coal seams sorb, retain and store gases needs, to be understood. The results {{presented}} in this thesis give an insight into the dynamics of CO 2 and other flue gas components in coal {{that are related to}} operation feasibility of ECBM projects. The main issues relate to the permeability behavior and the flue gas/ CO 2 sorption. The <b>cleat</b> network in coal seams provides the principal source of permeability for fluid flow. Understanding and predicting the <b>cleat</b> attributes is necessary for creating a flow model. A methodology for determining the <b>cleat</b> spacing is proposed, which uses a Gaussian point spread function. Using this method, the <b>cleat</b> apertures were measured with the aid of CT images. In addition, a method to determine the <b>cleat</b> orientation and <b>cleat</b> spacing distribution from CT scans of coal samples was developed. Regarding the <b>cleat</b> orientation and relevant <b>cleat</b> spacing, we observe configuration dependent spacing distributions, which can be used for fracture modeling in coal specimens, up to one cubic foot in size. The method combines these two different techniques, and gives {{a better understanding of the}} <b>cleat</b> framework. Up-scaling to seam size was not investigated. This combined procedure also proves that it is possible to distinguish the face <b>cleat,</b> the butt <b>cleat</b> and the bedding system. However, no measurement can be exact in the sub-pixel level, including the method described above. At best, choosing the right method can reduce the error in the approximations.

Surface joints, infrared photolinears, and Ronchi grating photolinears were investigated as potential estimators of subsurface <b>cleat</b> orientation. <b>Cleat</b> orientations were masured in 18 mines, in the Pittsburgh coalbed in southwestern Pennsylvania and northern West Virginia {{to be used as}} a standard against which prediction techniques would be evaluated. Two <b>cleat</b> systems with a strong geographic segregation were measured in the study area: N 6720 W - N 2820 E (9520 separation) for the north, and N 7620 W - N 1720 E (9320 separation) for the south. Directional data obtained from the three techniques investigated yielded satisfactory regional predictions of <b>cleat</b> orientation. Analysis of surface joints was the only technique considered sufficiently reliable on a local basis. Prediction of <b>cleat</b> orientation is based on the pairing of the principal directional sets into all reasonable combinations of fundamental systems. The system or systems composed of the most dominant sets nearest to 9020 separation are likely to be a reliable prediction of <b>cleat</b> orientation.

40|$|Fluid flow {{characteristics}} of <b>cleat</b> systems in coalbed methane reservoirs are crucial in reservoir management and field development plans. This paper aims {{to evaluate the}} <b>cleat</b> system properties including <b>cleat</b> porosity, permeability, and aperture {{as well as the}} impact of permeability growth on production performance in the Bandanna Coal Formation of the Fairview Field, eastern Queensland. Owing to the presence of bad hole conditions and poor core recovery of the coal intervals, the petrophysical well logs and laboratory measurements cannot be used as a source of information for this purpose. Hence, a new approach is employed that utilises early water production data to measure water in place and absolute permeability of the coal. In addition, micro-computed tomography (CT) scan method is used to investigate the <b>cleat</b> system that is preserved in a core sample and results are compared with the ones obtained by analysis of production data. <b>Cleat</b> system evaluation by analysis of production data and micro-CT scan technique provides a comprehensive approach that brings confidence in measurements and helps to obtain <b>cleat</b> properties at the sufficient scale for reservoir engineering purposes. The necessary information including production data and core samples are collected from a dewatering well and the nearby observation well in the study area. Analysis of early water production data (single-phase flow) indicates that coal permeability is 189 mD and the average <b>cleat</b> porosity is approximately 5 %. High <b>cleat</b> porosity describes the large volume of water produced {{over the life of the}} study well. The 3 D model of the fossilised <b>cleat</b> system constructed by the micro-CT scan method reveals that coal is well-cleated and <b>cleat</b> spacing and mean <b>cleat</b> aperture are 4 and 0. 136 mm, respectively. The average <b>cleat</b> porosity that is measured by the micro-CT scan method is 5. 7 %, which is fairly close to the <b>cleat</b> porosity measured by analysis of production data. Production data analysis indicates that effective permeability to gas starts to grow at the midlife of the well and it strongly controls the shape of the production profile. The results of this study help in future field development and infill drilling programs in the Fairview Field and provide important insights into <b>cleat</b> system of Bandanna Coal Formation. Z.

25|$|Their white jerseys have {{provided}} three basic color combinations, {{two of which}} have been previously alluded to in this article. The last combination consists of both white jerseys and pants. That particular combination surfaced in {{the first game of the}} 2003 season, when the team was coached by Steve Spurrier, during a nationally televised game against the New York Jets, which led many sports fans and Redskins faithful alike to point out that they had never seen that particular combination before. That year the Redskins wore it two more times. That look didn't appear again until midway through the 2005 season when the Redskins wore it in a road game against the St. Louis Rams. The Redskins won six straight games, including one in the playoffs against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, wearing that combination and the local media jokingly pointed out that the reason the Redskins were winning was their use of the white over white combination. In the NFC Divisional Playoff game against the eventual 2005 NFC Champion Seattle Seahawks, the Redskins wore the all-white uniforms, in hopes that they could keep their streak going; however, they lost 20–10. The Redskins continued to wear the white jerseys and white pants into the 2006 preseason. In the 2006 season, the Redskins started wearing black <b>cleats,</b> something that hadn't been done for quite a while. It was a surprise because they wore white <b>cleats</b> during the preseason.

40|$|Connection is an {{important}} element in structural steelwork construction. Eurocode does not provide adequate design information for mechanical properties prediction of top-seat flange <b>cleat</b> connection, especially for thin-walled cold-formed steel structures. Adopting hot-rolled design with neglecting thin-walled behaviour could lead to unsafe or uneconomic design. This research aims to provide accurate mechanical properties prediction for bolted top-seat flange <b>cleat</b> connection in cold-formed steel structures. The scope of work focuses on the effect of various thickness of the flange <b>cleat</b> to the rotational stiffness and strength behaviour of a beam-to-column connection.

Two categories of flange <b>cleat</b> thickness, ranged from 2 mm to 40 mm are studied. From the developed numerical models, it is observed that Eurocode has overestimated the initial rotational stiffness prediction, calculated with component method. The over-estimation would influence the overall stiffness of structures and force distribution within the components.

30|$|Wellbore {{instability}} is a {{key problem}} restricting efficient production of coal-bed methane. In order to perform thorough and systematic research regarding coal-bed wellbore stability problems, a new discrete element model which fully considers the features of <b>cleat</b> coal-beds is established based on the Kirsch equation.

The case studies show the following results: the wellbore collapses (collapse pressure: 4.33 MPa) or fractures (fracture pressure: 12.7 MPa) in certain directions {{as a result of}} swab or surge pressure when the pipe tripping speed is higher than a certain value; the <b>cleat</b> face size has a great influence on wellbore stability, and if the drilling fluid pressure is too low, the wellbore is prone to collapse when the ratio of the face <b>cleat</b> size to butt <b>cleat</b> size is reduced; however, if the drilling fluid pressure is high enough, the butt <b>cleat</b> size has no influence on the wellbore fracture; the factors influencing coal-bed stability include the movement length, pipe size, borehole size.|$|R
