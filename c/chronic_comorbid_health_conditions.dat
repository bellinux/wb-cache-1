The methods used can produce very different results and there is currently no consensus on {{which is the most}} appropriate approach. ObjectiveThe objective of the current study was to compare the accuracy of five different methods within the same dataset. MethodData collected during five Welsh Health Surveys were subgrouped by health status. Mean short-form 6 dimension (SF- 6 D) scores for cohorts with a specific <b>health</b> <b>condition</b> were used to estimate mean SF- 6 D scores for cohorts with comorbid conditions using the additive, multiplicative, and minimum methods, the adjusted decrement estimator (ADE), and a linear regression model. ResultsThe mean SF- 6 D for subgroups with <b>comorbid</b> <b>health</b> <b>conditions</b> ranged from 0. 4648 to 0. 6068. The linear model produced the most accurate scores for the <b>comorbid</b> <b>health</b> <b>conditions</b> with 88 % of values accurate to within the minimum important difference for the SF- 6 D. The additive and minimum methods underestimated or overestimated the actual SF- 6 D scores respectively. The multiplicative and ADE methods both underestimated the majority of scores. However, both methods performed better when estimating scores smaller than 0. 50. Although the range in actual health state utility values (HSUVs) was relatively small, our data covered {{the lower end of the}} index and the majority of previous research has involved actual HSUVs at the upper end of possible ranges.

40|$|We {{sought to}} {{determine}} the <b>comorbid</b> <b>health</b> <b>conditions</b> and inpatient mortality associated with pemphigus in a U. S. inpatient cohort. The 2002 - 2012 Nationwide Inpatient Sample, which contains a representative 20 % stratified sample of all inpatient hospitalizations in the US, was analyzed. Comorbidities were determined through ICD- 9 -CM codes. Survey weighted multivariate logistic regression models controlling for demographic factors were constructed to determine the association of pemphigus with various comorbidities. Multivariate logistic regression models controlling for socio- demographic factors were constructed to determine predictors of mortality. Of 87, 039, 711 hospital discharges captured in the NIS between 2002 - 2012, there were 1, 185 and 5, 221 admissions with a primary or secondary diagnosis of pemphigus. The <b>comorbid</b> <b>health</b> <b>conditions</b> most strongly associated with pemphigus were Cushing syndrome (17. 23 [2. 41 - 122. 90]), adrenal insufficiency (4. 08 [1. 71 - 9. 73]), myasthenia gravis (6. 92 [2. 55 - 18. 79]), fungal infections (4. 03 [3. 60 - 4. 52]), insomnia (18. 02 [2. 46 - 131. 88]), leukemia (1. 56 [1. 08 - 2. 24]), non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (1. 52 [1. 15 - 2. 03]), and diabetes mellitus (1. 30 [1. 20 - 1. 40]). Mean mortality for patients with a primary or secondary diagnosis of pemphigus was 1. 70 % [1. 29 - 1. 91] and 3. 20 % [2. 71 - 3. 69], respectively, while patients without a diagnosis of pemphigus had a mean mortality of 1. 78 % [1. 78 - 1. 78]. Predictors of mortality included Asian race, Medicare or Medicaid insurance status, and increasing number of chronic conditions. The present study found significantly higher odds of comorbidities in US children and adults with pemphigus, including infections, autoimmune, malignancy, cardiovascular and endocrine disorders.

Descriptive statistics and linear modeling were used to examine the associations between age, comorbidity, BMI, intensity and duration of physical activity, and health-related quality of life. Results: The majority of patients (n= 115, 51. 3 %) reported two or more comorbidities. In addition to other musculoskeletal conditions, common comorbidities included depression (n= 41, 18. 3 %), hypertension (n= 40, 17. 9 %), and diabetes (n= 39, 17. 4 %). Approximately one-half of participants (n= 110, 49. 1 %) self-reported insufficient physical activity to meet minimum recommended guidelines and 150 (67. 0 %) were overweight (n= 56, 23. 2 %), obese (n= 64, 28. 6 %), severely obese (n= 16, 7. 1 %), or very severely obese (n= 14, 6. 3 %), with a higher proportion of older patients affected. A generalized linear model indicated that, after adjusting for age, self-reported physical activity was positively associated (z= 4. 22, P< 0. 001), and comorbidities were negatively associated (z=– 2. 67, P< 0. 01) with patients’ health-related quality of life.

40|$|Purpose {{of review}} : Transgender {{individuals}} experience unique health disparities {{but are the}} subject of little focused health research. This manuscript reviews current literature on transgender medical and mental health outcomes and proposes research priorities to address knowledge gaps. Recent findings : Published research in transgender healthcare consists primarily of case reports, retrospective and cross-sectional studies, involving largely European settings. Challenges to US-based transgender health research include a diverse population where no single center has sufficient patient base to conduct clinical research with statistical rigor. Treatment regimens are heterogeneous and warrant study for best practices. Current research suggests increased mortality and depression in transgender individuals not receiving optimal care, and possibly a modest increase in cardiovascular risk related to hormone therapy. Current evidence does not support concerns for hormone-related malignancy risk. The priorities for transgender medical outcomes research should be to determine <b>health</b> disparities and <b>comorbid</b> <b>health</b> <b>conditions</b> over the life span, along with the effects of mental health, medical, and surgical interventions on morbidity and mortality.

40|$|Abstract Background In the US, {{approximately}} 53 % {{of adults}} {{have at least}} one <b>chronic</b> condition. <b>Comorbid</b> physical and mental <b>health</b> <b>conditions</b> often have an incremental negative impact on health-related quality of life (HRQL). Primary study objectives were to quantify the impact on HRQL of a) ≥[*] 1 physical condition, b) ≥[*] 1 <b>comorbid</b> mental <b>health</b> <b>conditions</b> added to a physical one, c) [*]≥[*] 1 mental <b>health</b> <b>condition,</b> and d) [*]≥[*] 1 comorbid physical conditions added to at least one related to mental health. Decrements were based on a “Healthy” reference group reporting no chronic conditions. Methods Participants were sampled (n[*]=[*] 3877) from the US adult population as part of a 2009 normative survey. Demographics, number/ type of chronic conditions, and HRQL data were self-reported. HRQL was defined through SF- 36 v 2 ® Physical Component Summary (PCS) scores and Mental Component Summary (MCS) scores. Participant “morbidity” groupings included Healthy; Physical <b>Health</b> <b>Condition</b> only, Mental <b>Health</b> <b>Condition</b> only, and Physical and Mental <b>Health</b> (<b>Comorbid).</b> PCS and MCS scores were also analyzed by physical disease clusters (e. g., cardiovascular, gastrointestinal). Multivariate regression models were used for all analyses. Results 81 % of participants were Caucasian; 9 % African American. Males and females were about equally represented; 63 % were[*]≥[*] 45 years old. The average number of reported chronic conditions was 2. 4 (SD[*]=[*] 2. 4). Relative to the Healthy group, the Physical Condition group scored 6. 4 (males) and 7. 5 (females) points lower on PCS. The addition of a <b>comorbid</b> mental <b>health</b> <b>condition</b> resulted in a total reduction of 11 points in PCS and 15 points in MCS. Compared to the Healthy group, ≥ 1 mental <b>health</b> <b>conditions</b> was associated with MCS decrements of 11 – 12 points.

This study seeks {{to bridge the gap}} in information that exists about {{psychological distress}} in late life, by exploring the prevalence of psychological distress among a very large sample of older adults to determine the impact of age and gender, and the modifying effect of these factors on the associations between measures of psychological distress and sociodemographic and comorbid conditions. Methods: We analyzed self-reported data from 236, 508 {{men and women in the}} New South Wales 45 and Up Study, to determine the impact of age and gender, and the modifying effects of these factors on associations between psychological distress and sociodemographic and comorbid conditions. Results: Higher education, married status, and higher income were associated with lower risk of psychological distress. Although overall prevalence of psychological distress is lower at older ages, this increases after age 80, and is particularly associated with physical disabilities. Some older people (such as those requiring help because of disability and those with multiple <b>comorbid</b> <b>health</b> <b>conditions)</b> are at increased risk of psychological distress.

From 2000 to 2002, we identified 946 participants with stable cardiovascular disease in San Francisco, California, and followed them prospectively for cardiovascular events (heart failure, myocardial infarction, stroke, or cardiovascular death). We then examined {{the extent to which the}} association was attenuated by adjustment for poor <b>health</b> behaviors, <b>comorbid</b> <b>health</b> <b>conditions,</b> and potential biological mediators. During a median follow-up period of 8. 0 years (through August 24, 2012), 323 sub-jects (34. 1 %) experienced a cardiovascular event. Following adjustment for sociodemographic factors, season of blood measurement, <b>health</b> behaviors, and <b>comorbid</b> <b>conditions,</b> 25 -hydroxyvitamin D levels under 20 ng/mL remained independently associated with cardiovascular events (hazard ratio = 1. 30, 95 % confidence interval: 1. 01, 1. 67). However, after further adjustment for potential biological mediators, the independent association was no longer present (hazard ratio = 1. 11, 95 %confidence interval: 0. 85, 1. 44). Parathyroid hormone, a potentiallymod-ifiable biological factor downstream from 25 -hydroxyvitamin D, was responsible for the majority of this attenuation.

40|$|Purpose and Background/Significance: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) {{and type}} 2 {{diabetes}} mellitus (T 2 DM) are prevalent <b>comorbid</b> <b>health</b> <b>conditions</b> in adults, affecting roughly 65 % of U.

Poor T 2 DM control, depression, and stress are inflammatory processes that are associated with an increased risk of CVD events, including hypertension, myocardial infarction, stroke, and kidney disease. The purpose of this thesis was to test a model of the relationships between T 2 DM control, depression, and stress measures as predictors of CVD risk factors and events in a sample of adults (N= 45) with T 2 DM and depressive symptoms. It was hypothesized that, after controlling for socio-demographic characteristics and clinical characteristics, there would be: (a) a positive association between biological and self-report stress measures with self-reported cardiovascular events and risk factors, and; (b) A 1 c and smoking status would be positively related to biological and self-report distress measures and to self-reported CVD risk factors/events.

Subjects were 81 patients with MDD (mean age 48. 6 years) and 69 matched healthy controls (mean age 51. 2 years). Subjects underwent 1. 5 T magnetic resonance imaging, genotyping for the fat mass and obesity associated (FTO) gene rs 3751812 polymorphism, and measurements for body mass index (BMI). We conducted a whole brain voxelwise analysis using tensor-based morphometry (TBM) to examine the main and interaction effects of diagnosis, BMI and FTO genotype. Significant effects of BMI were observed across widespread brain regions, indicating reductions in predominantly subcortical and white matter areas associated with increased BMI, but there was no influence of MDD or FTO rs 3751812 genotype. There were no significant interaction effects. Within MDD patients, there was no effect of current depressive symptoms; however the use of antidepressant medication was associated with reductions in brain volume in the frontal lobe and cerebellum.

Consideration of a patient's psychological health is therefore important for all nurses providing holistic care.

The cognitive and behavioural risk factors associated with depression and anxiety are also explored, as an understanding of these can help nurses to provide appropriate care...|$|R
40|$|These Guidelines aim {{to provide}} {{alcohol and other}} drug (AOD) workers with {{evidence-based}} information {{to assist with the}} management of co-occurring, or comorbid, AOD and mental <b>health</b> <b>conditions.</b> They represent an update and revision of the first edition of these Guidelines published in 2009. Population estimates indicate that more than one-third of individuals with an AOD use disorder have at least one <b>comorbid</b> mental <b>health</b> disorder; however, the rate is even higher among those in AOD treatment programs. Additionally, there are {{a large number of people}} who present to AOD treatment who display symptoms of disorders while not meeting criteria for a diagnosis of a disorder. The high prevalence of comorbidity means that AOD workers are frequently faced with the need to manage complex psychiatric symptoms that may interfere with their ability to treat clients’ AOD use. Furthermore, clients with <b>comorbid</b> mental <b>health</b> <b>conditions</b> often have a variety of other medical, family, and social problems (e. g., housing, employment, welfare, legal problems). As such, it is important that AOD workers adopt a holistic approach to the management and treatment of comorbidity that is based on treating the person, not the illness (see Chapter B 1). The first step in responding to comorbidity is being able to identify the person’s needs (see Chapters B 2 and B 3). Despite high rates of comorbidity among clients of AOD services, it is not unusual for <b>comorbid</b> mental <b>health</b> <b>conditions</b> to go unnoticed. This is mostly because AOD workers are not routinely looking for them. It is a recommendation of these Guidelines that all clients of AOD treatment services should be screened and assessed for comorbidity as part of routine clinical care. Once identified, symptoms of mental <b>health</b> <b>conditions</b> may be effectively managed while the person is undergoing AOD treatment (see Chapters B 5 and B 6). The goal of management is to allow AOD treatment to continue without mental health symptoms disrupting the treatment process, and to retain clients in treatment who might otherwise discontinue such treatment. Comorbidity is not an insurmountable barrier to treating people with AOD use disorders. Indeed, research has shown that clients with <b>comorbid</b> mental <b>health</b> <b>conditions</b> can benefit just as much as those without comorbid conditions from usual AOD treatment. Some clients with comorbidity may require additional treatment for their mental health problems (see Chapter B 6). Some interventions have been designed for the treatment of specific comorbidities; however, these interventions generally have not been well researched. Where there is an absence of specific research on comorbid disorders, it is recommended that best practice is to use the most effective treatments for each disorder. Both psychosocial and pharmacological interventions have been found to have some benefit in the treatment of many comorbidities. Consideration should also be given to the use of e-health interventions, physical activity, and complementary and alternative therapies, as an adjunct to traditional treatments. In addition to mental health services, AOD workers may need to engage with a range of other services to meet clients’ needs, including housing, employment, education, training, community, justice, and other support services. A broad, multifaceted, and co-ordinated approach is needed in order to address all of these issues effectively, and it is important that AOD services and workers develop links with a range of local services (see Chapter B 4) ...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{determine}} whether the use of medications with possible and definite anticholinergic activity {{increases the risk of}} cognitive impairment and mortality in older people and whether risk is cumulative. DESIGN: A 2 -year longitudinal study of participants enrolled in the Medical Research Council Cognitive Function and Ageing Study between 1991 and 1993. SETTING: Community-dwelling and institutionalized participants. PARTICIPANTS: Thirteen thousand four participants aged 65 and older. MEASUREMENTS: Baseline use of possible or definite anticholinergics determined according to the Anticholinergic Cognitive Burden Scale and cognition determined using the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). The main outcome measure was decline in the MMSE score at 2 years. RESULTS: At baseline, 47 % of the population used a medication with possible anticholinergic properties, and 4 % used a drug with definite anticholinergic properties. After adjusting for age, sex, educational level, social class, number of nonanticholinergic medications, number of <b>comorbid</b> <b>health</b> <b>conditions,</b> and cognitive performance at baseline, use of medication with definite anticholinergic effects was associated with a 0. 33 -point greater decline in MMSE score (95 % confidence interval (CI) = 0. 03 – 0. 64, P=. 03) than not taking anticholinergics, whereas the use of possible anticholinergics at baseline was not associated with further decline (0. 02, 95 % CI=- 0. 14 – 0. 11, P=. 79). Two-year mortality was greater for those taking definite (OR= 1. 68; 95 % CI= 1. 30 – 2. 16; P<. 001) and possible (OR= 1. 56; 95 % CI= 1. 36 – 1. 79; P<. 001) anticholinergics. CONCLUSION: The use of medications with anticholinergic activity increases the cumulative risk of cognitive impairment and mortality...|$|R
40|$|Personality {{disorder}} (PD), {{outcomes of}} diverse <b>comorbid</b> physical <b>health</b> <b>conditions,</b> {{and the associated}} burden on health service resources have seldom been studied at a population level. Consequently, there is limited evidence that might inform a public health approach to managing PD and associated mental and physical disability. A review was conducted of population-based studies examining the prevalence of PD and associations between physical comorbidities and service utilization. The prevalence of any PDs were common (4. 4 % - 21. 5 %) among populations spanning England, Wales, Scotland, Western Europe, Norway, Australia, and the United States. Preliminary evidence supports associations between PDs from Clusters A and B and physical comorbidities, namely cardiovascular diseases and arthritis. PD appears to increase health care utilization, particularly in primary care. In order to facilitate rational population health planning, further population studies are required...|$|R
40|$|Background: Cardiovascular disease, diabetes, {{and obesity}} as single <b>health</b> <b>conditions</b> are rising in prevalence, but {{a growing body}} of {{evidence}} suggests that individuals are increasingly experiencing two or more of these conditions at the same time. Previous research on comorbidity has focused on identifying the most common groupings of illnesses among elderly health-care users by use of hospital administrative data. Using small area estimation techniques, we developed a population-wide dataset of comorbidity of cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and obesity for England at the small area level. Methods: Matching data from the 2011 Health Survey for England and the 2011 Census in England and Wales, we proposed a new global optimisation (GO) survey calibration method for the estimation of small area estimates of comorbidity. Unlike previous small area estimation methods, the GO method is time efficient and always convergent, uses initial weights a priori for the small area distribution, and allows the user to confirm the best solution. Validation of the newly simulated data involved comparison of the fit (as measured by the relative difference of the sum of squared Z-scores, Z 2 rel< 0) of the benchmark constraints and non-benchmark constraints with census data. Findings: Validation revealed a significant fit for the benchmark constraints, age and sex (Z 2 rel< 0). Validation of the simulated non-benchmark constraint (health status) also revealed a significant fit (Z 2 rel< 0). In the absence of small area data on comorbidity, the close fit of both the benchmark and non-benchmark constraints allowed us to assume that the simulated estimates of comorbidity were statistically robust. Interpretation: WHO has identified increased rates of comorbidity as a major challenge for health policy. GO, a new approach to small area estimation, allows the prevalence of cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and obesity as both single and <b>comorbid</b> <b>health</b> <b>conditions</b> to be estimated at the small area level. The newly estimated data have the potential to highlight comorbidity hotspots across England and inform future health policy...|$|R
40|$|Background Studies of work {{disability}} in diabetes {{have examined}} diabetes as a homogeneous disease. We sought to identify subgroups among persons with diabetes based on potential {{risk factors for}} work disability. Methods Participants were 2, 445 employees with diabetes from three prospective cohorts (the Finnish Public Sector study, the GAZEL study, and the Whitehall II study). Work disability was ascertained via linkage to registers of sickness absence and disability pensions during a follow-up of 4 years. Study-specific latent class {{analysis was used to}} identify subgroups according to prevalent comorbid disease and health-risk behaviours. Study-specific associations with work disability at follow-up were pooled using fixed-effects meta-analysis. Results Separate latent class analyses for men and women in each cohort supported a two-class solution with one subgroup (total n = 1, 086; 44. 4 %) having high prevalence of chronic somatic diseases, psychological symptoms, obesity, physical inactivity and abstinence from alcohol and the other subgroup (total n = 1, 359; 55. 6 %) low prevalence of these factors. In the adjusted meta-analyses, participants in the 'high-risk' group had more work disability days (pooled rate ratio = 1. 66, 95 % CI 1. 38 - 1. 99) and more work disability episodes (pooled rate ratio = 1. 33, 95 % CI 1. 21 - 1. 46). These associations were similar in men and women, younger and older participants, and across occupational groups. Conclusions Diabetes is not a homogeneous disease in terms of work disability risk. Approximately half of people with diabetes are assigned to a subgroup characterised by clustering of <b>comorbid</b> <b>health</b> <b>conditions,</b> obesity, physical inactivity, abstinence of alcohol, and associated high risk of work disability; the other half to a subgroup characterised by a more favourable risk profile...|$|R
40|$|Background: Bariatric surgery {{produces}} marked {{weight loss}} and improvement in <b>comorbid</b> <b>health</b> <b>conditions</b> among individuals with Class II or Class III obesity (Class I = 30. 0 ≤ BMI ≤ 34. 9 kg/m 2; Class II = 35. 0 ≤ BMI ≥ 39. 9 kg/m 2; Class III = BMI ≥ 40 kg/m 2). However, suboptimal weight outcomes occur in a significant minority of patients. Evidence suggests that psychological and behavioral factors might affect weight loss, {{but most of the}} literature has focused on preoperative factors, with mixed results. The current study tested the hypothesis that postoperative depressive symptoms, eating behaviors, and lower levels of physical activity would be associated with poorer weight loss outcomes. Method: Preoperative data were obtained from an extant clinical database, and postoperative data were collected via a mail or online questionnaire in a sample of 141 female Roux-en-y gastric bypass (RYGB) patients at an average of 16. 80 (SD= 2. 20) months post-surgery. Self-report measures assessed cognitive-affective and somatic symptoms of depression; binge eating, grazing, night eating, distress about overeating or loss of control over eating; and physical activity. Results: Weight outcome measures were defined as percentage of excess BMI loss (%EBMIL) and successful weight loss (≥ 50 % EBMIL). Higher distress was associated with poorer %EBMIL, and higher level of physical activity was associated with greater %EBMIL. Decreased cognitive-affective symptoms and increased somatic symptoms of depression were associated with a higher probability of successful weight loss. Increased somatic complaints predicted greater %EBMIL unless those symptoms were associated with higher sedentary behavior. Conclusions: Consistent with hypotheses, preoperative depressive symptoms and binge eating disorder did not predict weight loss. Aspects of all three postoperative domains were associated with weight outcomes. Future research should explore the relations among these psychological and behavioral factors and weight loss over a longer follow-up period. Dissertatio...|$|R

40|$|Autism {{spectrum}} {{conditions are}} generally perceived to affect males, {{with the majority}} of studies quoting the ratio of four males being diagnosed with autism for each female. The potential implications of this for women on the spectrum or seeking a diagnosis are wide-ranging, including healthcare professionals’ disbelief in autism in women leading to difficulties obtaining a diagnosis and misdiagnosis of other mental <b>health</b> <b>conditions.</b> In this study, a grounded theory methodology was applied to data from fifteen online blogs to explore the experiences of adult women on the autism spectrum of diagnosis of autism, and of mental health issues. The study yielded two grounded theory models: of diagnosis of autism and of mental health, which are linked through misdiagnosis of and <b>comorbid</b> mental <b>health</b> <b>conditions.</b> The findings suggest {{that there is a need}} for clinicians to be aware of the unique presentation of autism in women, and of the additional mental health issues which women with autism commonly experience.

This single-case study explores the psychotherapeutic process of a middle-aged woman who presented with a history of child sexual abuse (incest) and a long-term adult diagnosis of depression that was treated in public health services. This psychotherapy involved an integrative approach to solution-focused therapy; specifically, the approach proposed by Yvonne Dolan to work with adult survivors of sexual abuse, in conjunction with techniques and strategies from the transtheoretical model. Measures incorporating therapeutic working alliance and outcomes were administered over sessions. Results showed positive outcomes from this therapeutic intervention, which remained at 3 -month and 12 -month follow-ups.

40|$|Stroke is {{the leading}} cause of {{disability}} in adults in westernized societies and it has an important impact on <b>health</b> and economy. <b>Comorbid</b> <b>health</b> <b>conditions</b> such as hypertension, inactive lifestyle, smoking, obesity and diabetes considerably increase the risk of stroke. Moreover, studies have shown an increased probability of stroke occurrence and recurrence in the type 2 diabetes (T 2 D). Stroke leads to neurological deficits like motor impairments, disabilities and poor quality of life. The need of finding a novel treatment that can assure neuroprotective effects is crucial considering that the incidence of T 2 D is increasing around the world. Thrombolytic treatment given within 3 - 4 h from the stroke can assure some protection. Unfortunately, too few patients can benefit of this treatment due to a delayed arrival at the hospital, incorrect diagnoses or other causes. Furthermore, drugs that have shown some neuroprotective effectiveness in the pre-clinical experiments, failed in the clinical trials and today, there is no treatment for stroke based on neuroprotection. Glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP- 1) is a peptide found in L-cells of the small intestine and is secreted after the meal. The activation of its receptor (GLP- 1 R) increases the glucose-dependent insulin secretion and decreases the glucagon secretion. Exendin- 4 (Ex- 4) is a GLP- 1 R agonist that showed efficacy against stroke in diabetes in animal models. Additionally, it has been demonstrated that Ex- 4 is acting through the activation of GLP- 1 R. The aim of the present study was to determine if the receptor itself plays a role in stroke outcome (without Ex- 4) and see if the stroke-induced inflammation is affected by the lack of GLP- 1 R. We compared knockout vs. wild type mice by evaluating the stroke volume and by performing stereological counting of neurons in the striatum and cortex. The results showed no significant differences between the two groups, indicating that the lack of GLP- 1 R plays no role in stroke outcome...|$|R
50|$|The age of {{the patient}} and {{caregiver}} can affect the psychological effect that cancer has on them. However, which age group of caregivers (young adult, middle age or elderly) are more distressed by caregiving is still unconfirmed. Some suggest that younger caregivers suffer from more psychological distress, but others suggest that elderly caregivers are more at risk for distress. This may {{be a function of}} the phase of the cancer trajectory that caregivers are undergoing: studies tend to find high distress amongst younger caregivers in the acute and chronic phases, and high distress amongst elderly caregivers in the resolution (specifically, bereavement) phase of caregiving. Elderly caregivers are also at greater risk for negative effects on their physical health than are younger caregivers. Older caregivers {{are more likely to have}} <b>comorbid</b> <b>health</b> <b>conditions</b> and decreased physical ability. In relation to their psychological health, older caregivers may be at higher risk because of a higher likelihood of social isolation than younger caregivers. However, older caregivers are usually more satisfied with their role than are younger caregivers. Among women, this may be explained by the finding that younger female caregivers tend to perceive demands on their time due to role strain more negatively. Role strain tends to be more severe for later middle age caregivers due to their many responsibilities with family and work. Caregivers in this age group may also be more prone to emotional distress, and ultimately, a decreased quality of life. This is because the caregivers are at higher risk of experiencing social isolation, career interruption, and a lack of time for themselves, their families and their friends. The {{age of the}} cancer patient can also affect the physical and psychological burden on caregivers. Given that the highest percentage of individuals with cancer are older adults, caregiving for older cancer patients can be complicated by other comorbid diseases such as dementia. The spouses of elderly cancer patients are likely to be elderly themselves, which may cause the caregiving to take an even more significant toll on their well being.|$|R
