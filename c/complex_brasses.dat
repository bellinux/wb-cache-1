50|$|During {{the nineteenth}} century, {{a number of}} {{attempts}} were made to mechanise depth sounding. Designs ranged from <b>complex</b> <b>brass</b> machines to relatively simple pulley systems. Navies around the world, particularly the Royal Navy in Britain, were concerned about the reliability of lead and line sounding. The introduction of new machines was understood as a way to introduce standardised practices for sounding in a period in which naval discipline was of great concern.|$|R

40|$|By the mid-twentieth century, musical {{instrument}} manufacturing {{had become an}} increasingly mechanized activity. Craft skills had been displaced in many areas, yet remained a vital source of competitive advantage in local and international markets and were particularly valued by professional musicians. This paper examines the contrasting experiences of two British {{musical instrument}} manufacturers, tracing the unfolding relationship between their pursuit of entrepreneurial opportunities and capability development. Boosey & Hawkes, a large, well-established manufacturing and publishing company, was an early pioneer while Paxman Bros, a small musical retailer, transformed itself {{into one of the}} world's most respected specialist manufacturers. The narrative probes the factors that shaped decision-making in these companies as they developed a series of design innovations for one of the more <b>complex</b> <b>brass</b> instruments, the French horn. It examines how a dynamic interaction between opportunity and capability, coupled with unanticipated contingencies, contributed to divergent outcomes for each company...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{effects of}} Al content on the microstructures and the {{mechanic}} properties of <b>complex</b> <b>brass</b> (Cu- 22. 7 Zn-Al- 1. 0 Ni) in as-cast, hot-rolled and {{cold rolled strip}} were investigated. The results show that Al is able to significantly {{reduce the size of}} α phase and increase the area of β-phase. With the increase of Al content, α phase transforms from block to strip shape and distributes more uniform, and the tensile strength and hardness is improved, however, the elongation is decreased. With the addition of 3. 0 % Al in the alloy, the hardness and tensile strength of cold-rolled plate with the thickness of 0. 2 mm can reach up to the peak, 255 HV and 820 MPa. The proper deformation processing and heat treatment will induce that the hardness and tensile strength of 0. 2 mm thick cold-rolled plate are 20. 3 % and 7. 9 % than that of 0. 4 mm thick cold-rolled plate, respectively...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Using weight-loss method {{combined}} with metallographic to analysis {{the effect of}} annealing temperature (600 ℃, 640 ℃, 680 ℃) on the corrosion resistance of cold rolled strip of <b>complex</b> <b>brass</b> HAl 72 - 2. 5 Al- 1. 0 Ni alloy. Corrosive solutions for testing the corrosion velocity were 3. 5 % of the neutral sodium chloride solution, artificial acid rain (3. 5 % NaCl+H 2 SO 4 solution) and artificial sweat solution. The research {{results show that the}} corrosion of cold rolled strip occurs easily because grains stretched along the direction of deformation and the existence of residual stress. The maximum corrosion depth of cold-rolled strip is 94. 8 µm. Annealing treatment can effectively reduce the corrosion depth of alloy. Corrosion resistance of alloy rises with the increase of annealing temperature, because the recrystallization degree of alloy goes on more sufficient. The corrosion depth of samples annealed at 600 ℃ and 680 ℃ drops from 64. 45 µm to 56. 32 µm respectively. Aluminum content in the alloy also affects the corrosion resistance of the alloy, because oxygen oxidizes aluminum to density Al 2 O 3 film which prevents the further corrosion of the alloy. The corrosion velocity of samples in the solution of artificial acid rain is fastest and lowest in artificial perspiration solution...|$|R
50|$|Harrison's {{original}} construction using brass (pure zinc {{not being}} available then) is more <b>complex</b> since <b>brass</b> does not expand {{as much as}} zinc does. A further set of rods and bridges is needed giving nine rods in all, five iron and four brass. The exact degree of compensation can be adjusted by having {{a section of the}} central rod which is partly brass and partly iron. These overlap (like a sandwich) and are joined by a pin which passes through both metals. A number of holes for the pin are made in both parts and moving the pin up or down the rod changes how much of the combined rod is brass and how much is iron. In the late 19th century the Dent company marketed a further development of the zinc gridiron in which the four outer rods were replaced by two concentric tubes which were linked by a tubular nut which could be screwed up and down to alter the degree of compensation.|$|R
30|$|In his {{contribution}} to the thematic issue, Tom Wilson (Charles Darwin University, Australia) {{highlights the importance of}} employing not just national mortality forecasts, but sub-national mortality forecasts. He also addresses the difficulties involved in transferring sub-national mortality forecasting methods to regions smaller than the state or province level, noting, for example, that the time-series of the input data for these regions may not be as long. More specifically, he evaluated the suitability of different methods for sub-state regional mortality forecasting for practising demographers and forecast users in government and business. He performed such an evaluation for Australia divided into 88 sub-state regions. Drawing on data from 2001 to 2016, he used the 2001 – 2006 data to generate within-sample forecasts for 2006 – 2011 and 2011 – 2016. In addition to assessing the accuracy, plausibility and smoothness of the mortality age profiles, he evaluated the input data requirements, the ease of calculation and the ease of assumption setting and scenario creation. After providing a review of the different approaches to regional mortality forecasting—including the application of models developed for single national populations to every region, coherent mortality models and relational mortality models—he evaluated eight fairly simple sub-national mortality forecasting models that have been implemented by statistical agencies or researchers in recent years. His analysis showed that National Death Rates, SMR Scaling and Rate Ratio Scaling are among the less suitable methods, while the remaining five methods are more suitable. Wilson observed that of these five remaining methods, the Broad Age SMR Scaling and the Broad Age Rate Ratio Scaling are easy to implement, the TOPALS method is more difficult to implement and the more <b>complex</b> <b>Brass</b> Relational method and Mortality Surface method produce the smoothest mortality age profiles and highly plausible death rates. His contribution illustrates the importance of carefully evaluating existing regional mortality forecasting methods in situations in which data for a shorter time period only are available. His research also points to the importance of using criteria in addition to accuracy when evaluating mortality forecasting methods, in line with the recommendation made by Cairns et al. 2011 a.|$|R
40|$|In micro {{injection}} molding, cavities {{with high}} accuracy are required {{in order to}} fulfil the given requirements on precision. The molding inserts are often made of additive manufactured alloys in order to create conformal cooling or heating channels close to the injection molding cavity. Since these materials are usually harder than melting metallurgical alloys of the same composition, Precise Electrochemical Machining (PEM) represents a potential procedure for micro manufacturing of high precision cavities, because mechanical characteristics such as the material’s hardness and the ductility have no influence on the electrochemical machinability. In addition, no mechanical forces nor thermal impact influence the machining result. Due to the missing mechanical contact between the tool electrode and the machined cavity, filigrane structures with high precision can be manufactured even in mechanically hard to machine materials. The dissolution behavior of the work piece material is only influenced by its electrochemical attributes. In this study, precise electrochemical machining of a stainless steel (1. 4301) plate is investigated. A <b>complex</b> shaped <b>brass</b> electrode is applied {{in order to create a}} complicated cavity, which would be difficult to be machined by conventional techniques. For the determination of the precision, the influence of an increasing feed rate on the resulting cross-sectional shape of the cavity as well as on the lateral widening and on the influence of a micro pillar is examined...|$|R
40|$|Phytic acid is an {{environment-friendly}} reagent {{for processing}} metals. The anticorrosion and inhibiting mechanism for phytic acid monolayers self-assembled on a brass (HSn 70 - 1) electrode {{has been investigated}} by using electrochemical and photocurrent response methods. The electrochemical measurements indicate that phytic acid is liable to form surface <b>complexes</b> on the <b>brass</b> electrode, and the self-assembled monolayers (SAM) change {{the structure of the}} electric double-layer and shift the potential of zero charge positively. The photochemical measurement indicates that the brass electrode shows a p-type photoresponse owing to the formation of a Cu 2 O layer on its surface, and the presence of SAM weakens significantly the photoresponse, suggesting an excellent effect on anticorrosion, which is consistent with the EIS and polarization curve measurements. Adsorption of phytic acid was found to be typical of chemisorption, which can be reasonably described {{on the basis of the}} Langmuir isotherm.
