40|$|Knowledge Interchange Format (KIF) is a <b>computer-oriented</b> <b>language</b> for the {{interchange}} {{of knowledge}} among disparate programs. It has declarative semantics (i. e. {{the meaning of}} expressions in the representation can be understood without appeal to an interpreter for manipulating those expressions); it is logically comprehensive (i. e. it provides {{for the expression of}} arbitrary sentences in the first-order predicate calculus); it provides for the representation of knowledge about the representation of knowledge; it provides for the representation of nonmonotonic reasoning rules; and it provides for the definition of objects, functions, and relations. 2 Table of Contents 1.

40|$|The {{construction}} of natural language interfaces to computers {{continues to be}} a major challenge. The need for such interfaces is growing now that speech recognition technology is becoming more readily available, and people cannot speak those <b>computer-oriented</b> formal <b>languages</b> that are frequently used to interact with computer applications. Much of the research related to the design and implementation of natural language interfaces has involved the use of high-level declarative programming languages. This is to be expected as the task is extremely difficult, involving syntactic and semantic analysis of potentially ambiguous input. The use of LISP and Prolog in this area is well documented. However, research involving the relatively new lazy functional programming paradigm is less well known. This paper provides a comprehensive survey of that research...|$|R
