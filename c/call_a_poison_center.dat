40|$|A {{telephone}} survey of residents of metropolitan Baltimore {{was conducted in}} 1981 to assess awareness of the Maryland Poison Center and a program based on the Mr. Yuk poisoning warning symbol. The results of 280 telephone interviews are compared with a similar survey conducted 6 years earlier by the Maryland Poison Center. When faced with a harmful exposure, the most common response in the 1981 survey (32. 9 percent) was to call the poison center. That response was only the fourth most frequent answer (14. 5 percent) in the 1975 survey. Calling a physician or taking the person to a physician was the most frequent response in 1975 (29. 5 percent) but only the fourth most frequent in 1981 (15. 0 percent). Of the respondents who would <b>call</b> <b>a</b> <b>poison</b> <b>center,</b> 55. 7 percent in the 1981 survey knew the center's telephone number or had ready access to it. Public awareness of Mr. Yuk remained at approximately 60 percent in both surveys.

As revealed by many cases worldwide, such a marketing strategy led to unintentional self-poisonings and deaths. FIPs therefore constitute a very serious health and public policy issue.

40|$|CONTEXT AND OBJECTIVE: <b>Poison</b> control <b>centers</b> play <b>an</b> {{essential}} role in caring for poisoned patients, albeit without secure funding for their activities. The aim here was to investigate differences in length of hospital stay among poisoned patients, between those who received remote assistance from <b>a</b> <b>poison</b> control <b>center</b> {{and those who did}} not. DESIGN AND SETTING: A retrospective cohort including all poisoned patients hospitalized at an emergency service in Manaus between 2005 and 2007 was set up, and the local <b>poison</b> control <b>center</b> database was checked to see whether they received such assistance. METHODS: Patients presenting a known toxic agent, with less than 12 hours since exposure and without severe comorbidities, were selected. Their severity of poisoning was evaluated by two independent reviewers and divergences were resolved by another reviewer. RESULTS: One hundred and ninety-eight patients were included. Those who received remote assistance from <b>a</b> <b>poison</b> control <b>center</b> stayed in hospital on average for 3. 43 days less than those without <b>poison</b> control <b>center</b> assistance (95 % confidence interval, CI: - 6. 10 to - 0. 77). Severity was assessed in the cases of 90 patients: there was no statistical difference in severity between the patients with and without <b>poison</b> control <b>center</b> assistance (P > 0. 5). CONCLUSION: Patients with remote assistance from <b>a</b> <b>poison</b> control <b>center</b> had <b>a</b> shorter length of stay then patients without this aid. The <b>poison</b> control <b>center</b> may have reduced the length of stay of the poisoned patient...|$|R

40|$|In a {{study of}} {{occupational}} illness reported to <b>a</b> regional <b>poison</b> control <b>center</b> and to gauge the center's outreach and services, we did follow-up interviews of 301 case contacts over a 6 -month period. We ascertained referral routes, reasons for contacting the <b>poison</b> control <b>center,</b> and awareness of the center's function. For 122 cases a nonphysician was the initial <b>poison</b> control <b>center</b> contact. Of the nonphysician contacts, 41 had already consulted a health care provider and been referred to the <b>poison</b> control <b>center</b> for assistance. Of the 70 persons with exposure, only 21 had been aware before their exposures that <b>poison</b> control <b>center</b> services might include occupational chemical illness consultation. Physicians and nonphysicians expressed similar reasons for contacting the <b>poison</b> control <b>center,</b> with 118 of 301 identifying {{the need for an}} exposure hazard risk assessment.

40|$|Summary: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{identify}} and characterize caretakers who fail to utilize the <b>poison</b> <b>center</b> for unintentional poisonings involving children. We interviewed 210 caretakers of children evaluated for unintentional poisoning in the emergency center of an urban, university-based teaching hospital to determine (1) whether demographic differences exist between those caretakers who contacted <b>a</b> <b>poison</b> <b>center</b> prior to the emergency center visit and those who did not and (2) whether differences exist in prevalence of poison prevention knowledge and behaviors between the two groups. Ninety-six (46 %) of caretakers did not contact the <b>poison</b> <b>center</b> prior to the emergency center visit. Significant differences were found between the two groups for the following caretaker variables: race/ethnicity, language preference, age, level of education, country in which schooling occurred, and type of insurance coverage for the child. When logistic regression was used to control for confounding, the two variables associated with failure to use the <b>poison</b> <b>center</b> were black race and schooled outside the United States (primarily in Mexico). <b>Poison</b> <b>center</b> callers reported <b>a</b> higher prevalence of poison prevention knowledge and behaviors than noncallers.

50|$|<b>A</b> <b>poison</b> control <b>center</b> is <b>a</b> medical {{facility}} that {{is able to}} provide immediate, free, and expert treatment advice and assistance over the telephone in case of exposure to poisonous or hazardous substances. <b>Poison</b> control <b>centers</b> answer questions about potential poisons {{in addition to providing}} treatment management advice about household products, medicines, pesticides, plants, bites and stings, food poisoning, and fumes. More than 72% of poison exposure cases are managed simply by phone, greatly reducing the need for costly emergency room and doctor visits.|$|R
50|$|Deaths {{may occur}} from {{overdose}} with {{this class of}} drugs. Multiple drug ingestion (including alcohol) is common in deliberate TCA overdose.

Signs and symptoms of toxicity develop rapidly after TCA overdose, therefore, hospital monitoring is required as soon as possible.|$|R
