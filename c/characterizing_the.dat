5|$|Other {{scholars}} {{have identified the}} text's tone as satirical and mildly obscene, locating it among a movement of pamphlets influenced by a counter-trend promoting greater sympathy for prostitution. Linda Dowling interprets the pamphlet less a broadside against sodomites, and more as evidence of a strand in rhetoric that valorized Britain's martial past and saw {{lack of respect for}} it as a precondition for vice. Ian Bell considers the causality of this relationship between moral collapse and vice, <b>characterizing</b> <b>the</b> book as part of strand that saw vice as a product, not a cause, of a fundamental collapse in morality in Augustan London.|$|E
5|$|In 1935, Stebbins {{was offered}} a {{genetics}} research position at the University of California, Berkeley working with geneticist E. B. Babcock. Babcock needed assistance with a large Rockefeller-funded project <b>characterizing</b> <b>the</b> genetics and evolutionary processes of plants from the genus Crepis and was interested in developing Crepis into a model plant, to enable genetic investigations similar to those possible in the model insect Drosophila melanogaster. Like the genera that Stebbins had previously studied, Crepis commonly hybridized, displayed polyploidy (chromosome doubling), and could make seed without fertilization (a process known as apomixis). The collaboration between Babcock and Stebbins produced numerous papers and two monographs. The first monograph, published in 1937, resulted in splitting off the Asiatic Crepis species into the genus Youngia. The second, published in 1938, was titled The American Species of Crepis: their interrelationships and distribution as affected by polyploidy and apomixis.|$|E
5|$|Many {{argue that}} the ideas <b>characterizing</b> <b>the</b> Renaissance had their origin in late 13th-century Florence, in {{particular}} with the writings of Dante Alighieri (1265–1321) and Petrarch (1304–1374), {{as well as the}} paintings of Giotto di Bondone (1267–1337). Some writers date the Renaissance quite precisely; one proposed starting point is 1401, when the rival geniuses Lorenzo Ghiberti and Filippo Brunelleschi competed for the contract to build the bronze doors for the Baptistery of the Florence Cathedral (Ghiberti won). Others see more general competition between artists and polymaths such as Brunelleschi, Ghiberti, Donatello, and Masaccio for artistic commissions as sparking the creativity of the Renaissance. Yet it remains much debated why the Renaissance began in Italy, and why it began when it did. Accordingly, several theories have been put forward to explain its origins.|$|E

5|$|Since many {{materials}} can form crystals—such as salts, metals, minerals, semiconductors, {{as well as}} various inorganic, organic, and biological molecules—X-ray crystallography has been fundamental {{in the development of}} many scientific fields. In its first decades of use, this method determined the size of atoms, the lengths and types of chemical bonds, and the atomic-scale differences among various materials, especially minerals and alloys. The method also revealed the structure and function of many biological molecules, including vitamins, drugs, proteins and nucleic acids such as DNA. X-ray crystallography is still the chief method for <b>characterizing</b> <b>the</b> atomic structure of new materials and in discerning materials that appear similar by other experiments. X-ray crystal structures can also account for unusual electronic or elastic properties of a material, shed light on chemical interactions and processes, or {{serve as the basis for}} designing pharmaceuticals against diseases.|$|E

In his run, Peter Milligan managed to put punk ideology in the series, with the protagonist trying to reacquire his former punk self, while also <b>characterizing</b> <b>the</b> Conservative government as a demon infestation with the punk subculture fighting against this supposed subversion and abuse.
