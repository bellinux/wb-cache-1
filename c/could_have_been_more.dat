5|$|Pattle was {{a fighter}} ace {{with a high}} score, and is {{sometimes}} noted as being the highest-scoring British Commonwealth pilot of the war. If all claims made for him are correct, his total <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>more</b> than 51. It can be stated that his final total was at least 40 and could exceed this number. Log-books and semi-official records suggest this figure, while personnel attached to his squadron suspect the figure {{to be closer to}} 60. A total of 26 of Pattle's victims were Italian; 15 were downed with Gloster Gladiators, the rest with Hawker Hurricanes. He is considered to be the highest-scoring ace on both Gladiator and Hurricane (35 victories) fighters.|$|E
5|$|During the 16th century Reformation and Counter-Reformation, Western historians saw the Crusades {{through the}} lens of their own {{religious}} beliefs. Protestants saw them as a manifestation of the evils of the papacy, and Catholics viewed them as forces for good. 18th century Enlightenment historians tended to view the Middle Ages in general, and the Crusades in particular, as the efforts of barbarian cultures driven by fanaticism. These scholars expressed moral outrage at the conduct of the Crusaders and criticised the Crusades' misdirectionthat of the Fourth in particular, which attacked a Christian power (the Byzantine Empire) instead of Islam. The Fourth Crusade had resulted in the sacking of Constantinople, effectively ending any chance of reconciling the East–West Schism and leading to the fall of the Byzantine Empire to the Ottomans. In The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, 18th-century English historian Edward Gibbon wrote that the Crusaders' efforts <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>more</b> profitably directed towards improving their own countries.|$|E
5|$|Critics {{primarily}} found {{fault with}} the game's length, as {{the bulk of}} the game's content can be completed in only a few hours. Will Tuttle of GameSpy questioned whether Harmonix limited the number of songs on release knowing {{that there would be a}} market for the game's downloadable content in the near future. The low number of songs, along with the new themed instrument controllers, were found to make the game an expensive proposition for those new to rhythm games. Due to the limited selection of songs on the disc, some critics questioned the specific inclusion of certain songs or the exclusion of more popular songs. Furthermore, critics claimed that the game's complete dedication to the Beatles, without the option for cross-compatibility with Rock Band or vice versa, can potentially lead to tedious play sessions with minimal variety, hampering the social nature of the game. Justin Haywald of 1UP.com considered that in attaching the Rock Band name to the game's title, there was a certain expectation on an expandable library of songs and interoperability with previous Rock Band titles, which The Beatles: Rock Band failed to meet. Some players coming from previous versions of Rock Band would consider the songs in The Beatles: Rock Band to lack technical challenge. However, the less difficult note tracks were seen to be a welcoming benefit for newcomers to the series as well as those attempting to sing along with the harmony portions of the game. For purist fans, some critics noted that the game purposely avoids certain aspects of the Beatles' history; former band members such as Pete Best or collaborators such as Billy Preston or Eric Clapton are never seen during gameplay. Concerning supplemental content, Hilary Goldstein of IGN felt the extra features <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>more</b> substantial, especially in comparison to the additional material that accompanies the remastered CDs.|$|E

25|$|While lucrative, the {{revenues}} realized {{from the three}} factories should not be overemphasized: while the Medici often had invested more than 7,900 gold florins in the three factories in 1458, for example, the sum invested in banks in 1458 was more than 28,800and that figure is low, for it excludes the Rome branch serving the Pope, the Medici's interest-bearing deposits in their branches, and also omits any accounting of several years' profit which were inaccessible (since the relevant partnerships {{had not yet been}} dissolved; this may seem to be a flaw in the system, but it built up capital in a branch and allowed it to lend out more than it had been incorporated with). Part of the reason for maintaining these factories when the funds <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>more</b> profitably invested in the banks or trade could have been social: it seems to have a bit of a Florentine tradition to run such factories to provide employment for the poora social obligation, as it were.|$|E
25|$|With {{the demise}} of Khan Sevar (r.738–753) the ruling Dulo clan died out and the Khanate fell into a long {{political}} crisis during which the young country {{was on the verge}} of destruction. In just fifteen years seven Khans reigned, and all of them were murdered. The only surviving sources of this period are Byzantine and present only the Byzantine point of view of the ensuing political turmoil in Bulgaria. They describe two factions struggling for powerone that sought peaceful relations with the Empire, which was dominant until 755, and one that favoured war. These sources present the relations with the Byzantine Empire as the main issue in this internal struggle and do not mention the other reasons, which <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>more</b> important for the Bulgarian elite. It is likely that the relationship between the politically dominant Bulgars and the more numerous Slavs was the main issue behind the struggle but there is no evidence about the aims of the rival factions. Zlatarski speculates that the old Bulgar military aristocracy was leaning towards war while other Bulgars supported by the majority of the Slavs were inclined for peace with Byzantium.|$|E
25|$|Midna has {{received}} mostly positive reception {{from both the}} video game press and the public {{for her role in}} Twilight Princess. Game Informer editor Andrew Reiner stated that she, along with Link's wolf transformation, had incredible effects on Twilight Princess gameplay. Fellow Game Informer editor Billy Berghammer stated that he loved Midna, describing her as a cool character due to how she messed with Link throughout the game. 1UP.com editor Jeremy Parish stated that the supporting characters of Twilight Princess make up for Link's laconic nature, Midna more so than others. He described her as being acerbic and thoughtful, as well as an intricate character who moves the plot forward for her own means. While America's Intelligence Wire editor Dave Arey described her as intriguing, he felt that she <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>more</b> so if Nintendo had developed her further. GamesRadar listed her as one of the 25 best new characters of the decade, stating that before Midna, the only characters they could relate to were Link, Princess Zelda, and Ganon. RPGamer editor Matthew Rickert stated that he found nothing intriguing or likable about her, complaining about how much more plot time she receives in spite of this, arguing that she offers little help to Link and that it felt like she had replaced Zelda in Twilight Princess.|$|E

Enjoying the visuals, Jeff Haynes of IGN wrote: [...] "From the cluttered and junk strewn locations to the rusty, chaos filled doppelgangers of the alternate dimensions, everything feels like it's been stripped from one of the other titles and shrunk down to the handheld."

500|$|The last {{parts of}} Ridiculous Fishing {{assembled}} smoothly {{and it was}} released March 14, 2013 for iOS and later that year for Android. It was well received at launch with [...] "near-universal perfect scores" [...] and won both a 2013 Apple Design Award and Apple's iPhone game of the year. While IGN's Justin Davis thought the game's levels <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>more</b> differentiated in theme and art style, he found the [...] "almost cubist design ... absolutely gorgeous".

500|$|The main {{antagonist}} of [...] "Terms of Endearment", Weinsider, is a child-murdering demon. However, {{the episode}} plays against genre archetypes by turning Weinsider into a sympathetic villain. Critics {{have pointed out}} that the character's presentation was not entirely negative. Some have commented that Campbell humanized the character, portraying him in a manner that adds likability to a character who <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>more</b> sinister. By the time Weinsider is defeated, the audience is led to partially identify with him. He ultimately sacrifices himself {{to save the life of}} his wife, showcasing heroic qualities and subverting the way that villains are often portrayed in the genre.|$|E

[...] He {{went on to say that}} the episode <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>more</b> though, due to the fact that the show has used many clever gay jokes in the past. Likewise, Alex Rocha of TV Guide commented, [...] "'Family Gay' fell way short of my expectations. Even with its traditional pop culture references and flashbacks, this week's episode could not simply keep me tuned in. I'll admit, I did manage to laugh at times, but as in previous times, Family Guy simply fell short again." [...] Steve Heisler from The A.V.
