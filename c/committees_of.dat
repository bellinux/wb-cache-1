5|$|A {{struggle}} over {{the power of the}} purse brought Adams back into the political limelight. Traditionally, the Massachusetts House of Representatives paid the salaries of the governor, lieutenant governor, and superior court judges. From the Whig perspective, this arrangement was an important check on executive power, keeping royally appointed officials accountable to democratically elected representatives. In 1772, Massachusetts learned that those officials would henceforth be paid by the British government rather than by the province. To protest this development, Adams and his colleagues devised a system of <b>committees</b> <b>of</b> correspondence in November 1772; the towns of Massachusetts would consult with each other concerning political matters via messages sent through a network of committees that recorded British activities and protested imperial policies. <b>Committees</b> <b>of</b> correspondence soon formed in other colonies, as well.|$|E

Despite the widely accepted practice of determining early statehood from the date of ratification of the United States Constitution, many of the original colonies referred to themselves as states shortly after the Declaration of Independence was signed on 4 July 1776. <b>Committees</b> <b>of</b> political leaders and intellectuals were established by state legislatures to research and propose a seal and coat of arms. Many of these members were signers of the Articles of Confederation, Declaration of Independence, and United States Constitution. Several of the earliest adopted state coats of arms and seals were similar or identical to their colonial counterparts.|$|E
5|$|In August 1792, {{a second}} {{convention}} {{was held in}} Pittsburgh to discuss resistance to the whiskey tax.

A militant group known as the Mingo Creek Association dominated the convention and issued radical demands. As {{some of them had}} done in the American Revolution, they raised liberty poles, formed <b>committees</b> <b>of</b> correspondence, and took control of the local militia. They created an extralegal court and discouraged lawsuits for debt collection and foreclosures.|$|E

Further meetings resulted in the creation of <b>committees</b> <b>of</b> safety, and laid down rules by which to resist attempts by the New York provincial government to establish its authority.

5|$|Requisitioning disincentivised peasants from {{producing}} more grain {{than they could}} personally consume, and thus production slumped. A booming black market supplemented the official state-sanctioned economy, and Lenin called on speculators, black marketeers and looters to be shot. Both the Socialist Revolutionaries and Left Socialist Revolutionaries condemned the armed appropriations of grain at the Fifth All-Russian Congress of Soviets in July 1918. Realising that the <b>Committees</b> <b>of</b> the Poor Peasants were also persecuting peasants who were not kulaks and thus contributing to anti-government feeling among the peasantry, in December 1918 Lenin abolished them.|$|E
