5|$|Australia and New Zealand {{were built}} with a {{different}} arrangement. The spotting top on the main mast was deleted and an armoured spotting tower was built instead into the <b>conning</b> tower where it was better protected, had an improved field of vision and {{direct access to the}} primary <b>conning</b> position. The rear Transmitting Station was also deleted and the forward TS was consequently enlarged. Their 'A' turrets were built with the improvements listed above.|$|E
5|$|The main <b>conning</b> {{tower was}} {{protected}} by 12 inches of armour on its sides {{and it had a}} 4-inch roof. The aft <b>conning</b> tower (sometimes called the torpedo control tower) had 9-inch sides and a 3-inch roof. The communications tube down from each position was 6 inches thick above the upper deck and 2 inches thick below it. Each magazine {{was protected by}} two armour plates on each side as torpedo bulkheads, the first one an inch thick and the second one and a half inches thick.|$|E

5|$|In 2001, the Thanhouser Company Film Preservation {{acquired}} an original 35mm nitrate film print from John <b>Conning.</b> The {{intention was to}} deposit the film in the Library of Congress. The surviving print is 925 feet in length, {{but it is not}} listed as being a whole or partial print.|$|E
5|$|Only Lion was {{completed}} {{to the original}} design, which had the fore funnel placed between the forward superstructure and the tripod foremast. This meant that hot clinkers and flue gases from the boilers made the spotting top on the foremast completely unworkable when the ships were steaming at high speed, that the upper bridge could easily be rendered uninhabitable, depending on the wind, and that the signal flags and halyards were at risk of burning. Both ships were altered to correct this problem, Lion before being commissioned, and Princess Royal as she was fitting out, at a total cost of £68,170. The fore funnel was moved aft, the original fore and mainmasts exchanged position, and the foremast was now just a pole mast, not a tripod. The spotting tower {{at the rear of}} the <b>conning</b> tower was removed, the <b>conning</b> tower enlarged, the nine-foot Argo rangefinder was moved from the foremast spotting top to the roof of the <b>conning</b> tower, and all the funnels were raised to the same height. As part of these modifications, the two 4-inch guns mounted above the forward group of casemates were enclosed in casemates of their own to protect the gun crews from weather and enemy action.|$|E
5|$|The ships {{initially}} {{carried a}} pole mast above the <b>conning</b> tower, though shortly after commissioning, both ships had lattice masts added aft, and in 1910, the forward masts were also replaced with lattice masts.|$|E

5|$|The {{ships were}} {{protected}} with Krupp armor. The deck armor was 40mm (1.57in) thick on the horizontal, and ranged between 140–75–140mm (5.51–2.95–5.51in) in the sloped deck armor. The main armored belt was 250mm (9.8in) thick. The forward <b>conning</b> tower had a 50mm (1.97in) thick roof, while the sides were 300mm (11.8in) thick. The aft <b>conning</b> tower had a roof protected by 30mm (1.2in) of armor plating and 140mm (5.51in) armor on the sides. The ship's citadel was also protected by 140mm of armor. The main battery turrets had 50mm thick roofs and 250mm sides. The secondary battery turrets were protected by 150mm (5.9in) of armor, while the casemated guns had gun shields 70mm (2.75in) thick.|$|E
5|$|Von der Tanns armor {{consisted}} of Krupp cemented and nickel steel. The main belt armor was 80–120mm (3.1–4.7in) thick forward, 250mm(9.8in) thick over the ship's citadel, and was 100mm(3.9in) thick aft. The forward <b>conning</b> tower {{was protected by}} 250mm(9.8in), while the aft <b>conning</b> tower by 200mm(7.9in). The four turrets had 230mm(9.1in) faces, 180mm(7.1in) sides, and 90mm(3.5in) on the roofs. The horizontal armor measured 25mm(0.98in) thick, and the sloping deck armor was 50mm(2.0in) thick. Like the armored cruiser Blücher before her, she was protected by a torpedo bulkhead, 25mm(0.98in) thick. It was set back a distance of 4meters(13ft) from the outer hull skin, the space in between being used to store coal.|$|E
5|$|Beach Hall {{is the new}} {{headquarters}} for the United States Naval Institute which was dedicated on 21 April 1999 (pictured). The facility is named after Captain Edward L. Beach, Sr., {{who served as the}} Institute's secretary-treasurer, and his son, Edward L. Beach, Jr., who commanded Triton during Operation Sandblast. The dive wheel from Tritons <b>conning</b> tower is on display in the lobby of Beach Hall.|$|E

5|$|Full {{ammunition}} loads were 1,440 rounds for the 12-inch guns (120 per gun), 3,600 rounds for the 6-inch (300), 5,600 rounds for the 4-inch (350), and 16 torpedoes {{manufactured by}} Whitehead. To assist the main battery with targeting during a battle, the two ships were equipped with two Barr & Stroud rangefinders that were located above the <b>conning</b> towers.|$|E
5|$|In August 1922, Tosa {{was moved}} to Kure, still incomplete. Fifty {{thousand}} people turned out to watch as the battleship was towed out of the harbor by five tugboats. The barbettes for the 406mm (16inch) guns were in place, but no turrets or weapons had been mounted, so {{the holes in the}} main deck were covered with a mesh-like material. Her hull was finished, and a superstructure deck, bridge deck and <b>conning</b> tower had been fitted, along with a light signal mast directly aft of the second barbette. The <b>conning</b> tower had to be outfitted as a bridge, as there was no other suitable location; compared with those of similar ships, it was much smaller, as it only contained two levels and bridge wings. An exhaust pipe resembling an extremely small funnel was fitted so that heat could be supplied within the ship.|$|E
5|$|In early 1945, {{while under}} repair for combat damage, Mississippi {{received}} a new secondary battery. The old 51-caliber 5-inch guns were removed, and eight {{more of the}} 25-caliber anti-aircraft guns were installed, along with thirteen quadruple Bofors 40 mm mounts and forty 20 mm Oerlikon guns. To compensate for the added weight, the ship's armored <b>conning</b> tower was removed.|$|E

40|$|The {{inhibition}} of adhesion between aggregates and layers of embryonic retinal cells by concanavalin A (<b>Con</b> A) and <b>Con</b> A-mediated rearrangements of <b>Con</b> A receptors on retinal cells were studied. A short incubation of aggregates and layers with 10 /xg/ml <b>Con</b> A substantially reduced aggregate-to-layer adhesion {{in a subsequent}} assay without soluble lectin present. This effect of <b>Con</b> A was dosedependent, temperature-sensitive, involved events subsequent to <b>Con</b> A binding, and was reduced by cytochalasin B. The inhibition produced by succinylated <b>Con</b> A was substantially increased by incubation with antibody to <b>Con</b> A. Visualization of <b>Con</b> A-receptor complexes by fluorescence microscopy revealed that binding of <b>Con</b> A induced clearing of <b>Con</b> A receptors from filopodia, flattened regions of growth cones, and the edges of axons.

5|$|Late {{in their}} careers, {{the class was}} {{identified}} as the A class and the pennant numbers of all the submarines were prefixed with an A, becoming A-2 to A-7. None of the boats, however, ever displayed an A on their <b>conning</b> towers. Havmanden and Thetis were the first two boats taken out of service when they were stricken in April 1928. Havfruen was the last boat removed from service when she was stricken in May 1932.|$|E
5|$|The North Carolinas {{also did}} not have {{sufficient}} space to act as fleet flagships, so the lead ship of the new class was designed with an extra deck on the <b>conning</b> tower specifically for this purpose, although the increase in space and weight from this necessitated removal of two twin 5-in DP mounts.|$|E
5|$|The main armor belt was Krupp {{cemented}} and nineinches (230mm) thick, but {{narrowed to}} six and three inches (150 and 76mm) closer to {{each end of}} the ships. The barbettes were protected by nine-inch armor, while the turret had a twelve-inch (300mm) front, eight-inch (200mm) sides, and a two- to three-inch (51to76mm) top, and the <b>conning</b> tower had twelve-inch armor. The deck armor had multiple decks of one-and-a-half to twoinches (38to51mm), oneinch (25mm), and oneinch.|$|E

5|$|At the {{beginning}} of World War I, U-2 was not operational because she was in drydock awaiting replacement diesel engines. With her new engines and a new <b>conning</b> tower installed by June 1915, U-2 conducted reconnaissance cruises out of Trieste but was declared obsolete in early 1918. U-2 remained in service as a training boat at the submarine base on Brioni, but was at Pola {{at the end of}} the war. She was ceded to Italy as a war reparation in 1920 and scrapped at Pola. U-2 did not sink any ships during the war.|$|E

The squadron was assigned peacekeeping duties in the Adriatic for most of 1919 and Cardiff spent the time visiting various Adriatic ports or in Malta. She became the flagship of Rear-Admiral George Hope on 1 September.|$|E
