The <b>children</b> <b>would</b> regularly help out at the museum and search for archaeological artefacts in fields.|$|E
5|$|Jaime Lannister {{arrives in}} King's Landing bearing Myrcella's body, {{and returns to}} his sister Cersei Lannister. Cersei recounts the prophecy which Maggy the Frog told her as a child, when she was told all her <b>children</b> <b>would</b> die before her {{and she would be}} left with nothing. Jaime {{promises}} that they will have revenge against all who have wronged the Lannisters, heightening the importance of he and Cersei staying close.|$|E

5|$|Long {{galleries}} were {{a feature}} of large 16th- and 17th-century houses and had many purposes, from entertaining to exercising during inclement weather; the Phelips <b>children</b> <b>would</b> lead their ponies up these stairs {{to ride in the}} gallery. Today, it is used by the National Portrait Gallery to display part of its collection.|$|E
5|$|Members of this {{community}} also herd zebu and catch fish in Lake Alaotra. The work of fishing was traditionally subdivided by gender: men were only allowed to fish for eels, while women were tasked to use nets to catch small fish, and children {{were the only ones}} allowed to fish using poles. Men and <b>children</b> <b>would</b> traditionally leave their catch on the shore for women to pick up and take back to the village.|$|E
5|$|Rhea– Featured in a {{flashback}} in God of War II, Rhea is {{the wife of}} Cronos. When Cronos devoured their children {{in an attempt to}} cheat the prophecy that one of his <b>children</b> <b>would</b> become greater than him, Rhea tricked Cronos and ensured the young Zeus was hidden away and protected by Gaia. Rhea's fate is unknown.|$|E
5000|$|On {{the birth}} {{certificate}}, the <b>child's</b> name <b>would</b> be written as [...] "Hasan child of Suparman and Wulandari". The birth certificate of an extramarital <b>child</b> <b>would</b> bear only the mother's name. On a school diploma, the <b>child's</b> name <b>would</b> be written as [...] "Hasan, child of Suparman". On all other official documents (ID card, driver's license, and passport), only the <b>child's</b> name <b>would</b> appear, [...] "Hasan".|$|R
50|$|An {{example of}} a correct answer {{would be if the}} child and the doll were {{situated}} on the complete opposite sides of the mountain model with a tree on the child’s side and a large mountain in the middle acting as a visual barrier. A preoperational <b>child</b> <b>would</b> claim that the doll could see the tree, whereas the concrete operational <b>child</b> <b>would</b> select a photograph without the tree since the mountain is large enough to block the tree from the doll’s view. A concrete operational <b>child</b> <b>would</b> pass the Three Mountain Problem task.|$|R

5|$|The {{civil war}} spawned a {{disastrous}} humanitarian crisis in Angola, internally displacing 4.28million people – one-third of Angola's total population. The United Nations estimated in 2003 that 80% of Angolans lacked access to basic medical care, 60% lacked access to water, and 30% of Angolan <b>children</b> <b>would</b> die {{before the age}} of five, with an overall national life expectancy of less than 40years of age.|$|E
5|$|They {{decide to}} name their new baby Bart, {{as it is}} the first name they could think of that Homer did not think other <b>children</b> <b>would</b> make fun of.

5|$|A second {{emigrant}} ship—the Kennersley Castle, a merchantman docked at Leith, near Edinburgh—was {{hired by}} MacGregor in October 1822, and left Leith on 22 January 1823 with almost 200 emigrants aboard. MacGregor again saw the settlers off, coming aboard {{to see that}} they were well quartered; to their delight, he announced that since this was the maiden emigrant voyage from Scotland to Poyais, all the women and <b>children</b> <b>would</b> sail free of charge. The Cazique was rowed back to shore to rousing cheers from his colonists. The ship's captain Henry Crouch fired a six-gun broadside salute, hoisted the supposed flag of Poyais, then steered the ship out of port.|$|E
5|$|Allen {{was born}} on 31 July 1902 in Bellevue Hill, Sydney, Australia, the second of three {{children}} to Walter Allen, a lawyer, and his wife Marguerite (Pearl), née Lamb, {{the daughter of a}} Queensland Minister of Lands. Later rumours suggested that Allen's real father may have been the Middlesex cricketer Pelham Warner, who supported Allen in his cricket career. Both of Allen's parents had roots in England as well as Australia. In 1909, when Allen was six years old, his family moved to London—hoping that the <b>children</b> <b>would</b> benefit from an English education—where they initially lived in a flat before moving to various country villages. Finding that they enjoyed England, the family abandoned plans to return to Australia.|$|E
5|$|Andriamasinavalona {{established}} {{new rules}} {{to strengthen the}} authority of the tompo-menakely over their subjects. Inhabitants of the fief paid taxes (isam-pangady) to the local lord, and offered him the hindquarters of all slaughtered zebu as tribute. Parents who adopted or disowned a child paid a fee of one silver piastre to the lord, and the property of those who died without <b>children</b> <b>would</b> revert to the king, who would share it with him. The inhabitants of a fief were bound to execute any work or task ordered by the tompo-menakely. The authority of the lord was highly independent and interference of the king was infrequent, in part due to the close kinship ties uniting the king to the Zazamarolahy and Andriamasinavalona sub-castes.|$|E

5|$|Archduke Charles {{traveled}} to Villa Pianore {{and asked for}} Zita’s hand and, on 13 June 1911, their engagement was announced at the Austrian court. Zita in later years recalled that after her engagement she had expressed to Charles her worries {{about the fate of}} the Austrian Empire and the challenges of the monarchy. Charles and Zita were married at the Schwarzau castle on 21 October 1911. Charles's great-uncle, the 81-year-old Emperor Franz Joseph, attended the wedding. He was relieved to see an heir make a suitable marriage, and was in good spirits, even leading the toast at the wedding breakfast. Archduchess Zita soon conceived a son, and Otto was born 20 November 1912. Seven more <b>children</b> <b>would</b> follow in the next decade.|$|E
5|$|Bath Township {{is a small}} {{community}} located ten miles (16km) northeast of Lansing, Michigan which contains the unincorporated village of Bath. The area was primarily agricultural in the early 1920s. In {{the early part of}} the 20th century, many small one-room schools were closed, where different grades shared the same classroom and teacher. Educators of the era believed that <b>children</b> <b>would</b> receive a better and more complete education if students could attend a single school at one location. The grades could be age-divided into classes, and the facilities could be of a higher quality.|$|E
5|$|Between 1945 and 1955, {{the number}} of day schools run by Indian Affairs {{expanded}} from 9,532 to 17,947. The growth in day schools was accompanied by {{an amendment to the}} Indian Act in 1951 that allowed federal officials to establish agreements with provincial and territorial governments and school boards regarding the education of Indigenous students in the public school system. These changes were indicative of the government's shift in policy from assimilation-driven education at residential schools to the integration of Indigenous students into public schools. It was believed that Indigenous <b>children</b> <b>would</b> receive a better education {{as a result of their}} transition into the public school system.|$|E
50|$|On many occasions, Jews {{were accused}} of {{drinking}} the blood of Christian children in mockery of the Christian Eucharist. According to the authors of these so-called blood libels, the 'procedure' for the alleged sacrifice was something like this: a child {{who had not yet}} reached puberty was kidnapped and taken to a hidden place. The <b>child</b> <b>would</b> be tortured by Jews, and a crowd would gather at the place of execution (in some accounts the synagogue itself) and engage in a mock tribunal to try the <b>child.</b> The <b>child</b> <b>would</b> be presented to the tribunal naked and tied and eventually be condemned to death. In the end, the <b>child</b> <b>would</b> be crowned with thorns and tied or nailed to a wooden cross. The cross would be raised, and the blood dripping from the <b>child's</b> wounds <b>would</b> be caught in bowls or glasses and then drunk. Finally, the <b>child</b> <b>would</b> be killed with a thrust through the heart from a spear, sword, or dagger. Its dead body would be removed from the cross and concealed or disposed of, but in some instances rituals of black magic would be performed on it. This method, with some variations, can be found in all the alleged Christian descriptions of ritual murder by Jews.|$|R

5|$|Contrary to {{what many}} outsiders believed, most {{residents}} of the Walled City behaved similarly to other Hong Kong natives. In response to difficult living conditions, the residents formed a tightly knit community, helping one another endure various hardships. Within families, wives often did housekeeping, while grandmothers cared for their grandchildren and other children from surrounding households. The City's rooftops were an important gathering place, especially for residents who lived on upper floors. Parents used them to relax, and <b>children</b> <b>would</b> play or do homework there after school.|$|E
5|$|Dogs {{were tied}} with strings around the belly {{and kept in}} the house where they were raised as a food source {{alongside}} domesticated pigs. Seen as a delicacy, they were served during feasts and to the high chiefs. Dogs were less abundant than pigs in the islands, possibly because they were killed while they were young. European visitors noticed the native women, especially those who lost their own <b>children,</b> <b>would</b> often breastfeed puppies and small pigs.|$|E
5|$|In 2008, Selena's {{brother and}} former {{principal}} record producer A.B.

Their father and manager, Abraham Quintanilla, Jr., told A.B. {{that he did not}} want him to quit music, saying that his dream was that his <b>children</b> <b>would</b> continue in the music industry and never give up. In 2009, after performing to an enthusiastic crowd in Bolivia, A.B. decided to continue recording music.|$|E

5000|$|Mothers {{with a third}} <b>child</b> <b>would</b> get 750 SGD {{in child}} relief (factoring {{historic}} exchange rates, this was about $662 in 2010 US dollars). If a mother had three 'O'-level passes in one sitting, she would qualify for an enhanced child relief rebate (lowered from a threshold of five passes). Having a fourth <b>child</b> <b>would</b> qualify for enhanced child relief of 750 SGD plus 15% of the mother's income, up to 10000 SGD.|$|R
