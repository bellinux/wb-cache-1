However, its continuous capacity fading at elevated temperature is an obstacle to extended cycling in large-scale applications.

40|$|Abstract. Mesoporous {{molecular}} sieves such as MCM- 41 and SBA- 15 have many desirable properties for applications as separations media. Their high surface area (~ 1000 m 2. g- 1) and tuneable uniform pore size of 1. 8 – 40 nm make them ideal for size exclusion separations of proteins and other biological molecules of {{importance in the}} food and pharmaceutical industries. However, the stability of MCM- 41 in aqueous solution is limited.

The fluidized sand bed provided a heterogeneous system to allow rapid nucleation/crystallization on sand surface and result in effective coplating (deposition) of calcium carbonate, metal carbonates and possibly some metal hydroxides on the sand surface through lattice compatibility and crystal sweeping/enmeshment.

The total metal (untiltered) removal efficiency for copper, chromium, nickel and zinc were approximately 81 %, 77 %, 90 % and 74 %, respectively.
