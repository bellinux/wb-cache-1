5000|$|The first {{foreign policy}} crisis of Chamberlain's {{government}} occurred in December 1937 when the Japanese attacked and damaged a British gunboat, HMS Ladybird, on the Yangtze river in China, and injured Sir Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen, British Ambassador to China, by strafing his car. Japanese planes had also sunk an American gunboat, the USS Panay, on the Yangtze. Chamberlain hoped {{to use the}} Panay incident to bring the United States out of isolationism, and instructed the Foreign Secretary Anthony Eden to inform the Americans that Britain was prepared to send 8 or 9 capital ships to the naval base at Singapore, if the Americans were to do likewise, to threaten Japan with a blockade should she refuse to make amends for her attacks. The American refusal of Chamberlain’s offer, and the decision to accept the Japanese apology for sinking the Panay instead did much to disillusion him concerning the prospects of American support if a major war were to occur.

50|$|Although Oklahoma City {{was just}} barely a top-40 Nielsen market at the time, {{the number of}} {{households}} in the 34-county market area that owned at least one television set was not nearly large enough for what were essentially three independent stations; the supply of first-run and acquired programming on the syndication market was also insufficient to completely fill the schedules of KOKH, KGMC and KAUT. In the summer of 1988, Visalia, California-based Pappas Telecasting {{announced that it would}} purchase KOKH from Busse for $3.6 million. A proposal that accompanied the deal would have allowed KOKH to become the market's dominant independent by reducing its competition: Pappas proposed a complex $30-million asset transfer in which it would purchase the programming inventories of Heritage Media-owned KAUT - including its rights to the Fox affiliation - and Seraphim Media/Oklahoma City Broadcasting-owned KGMC and integrate them onto channel 25's schedule. Pappas also planned to change the station's call letters to KOKC-TV (the KOKC calls are now used by a news/talk radio station on 1340 AM). Heritage would donate KAUT's license and transmitter facilities to OETA for $1 million, while Seraphim would sell KGMC to religious broadcaster, which would have resulted in the station carrying a mix of religious programs as well as programming from the Home Shopping Network (HSN) (which the station already carried as overnight filler programming through the Home Shopping Spree service). Pappas would also enter into a 25-year lease with OETA to give the authority permission to operate the KAUT transmitter facility for $1 per year, and offered to contribute an additional $1 million on the pretense that the purchase was successfully completed. OETA planned to help fund the conversion of channel 43 into a non-commercial educational station through start-up grants, including a $75,000 grant donated by KOCO-TV management. The plan was later revised when OETA filed an application with the FCC to purchase KGMC as a <b>contingency</b> <b>measure,</b> with the intent of having Heritage sell KAUT to a religious entity.|$|E
50|$|On April 23, 1991, Heritage Media {{announced}} that it would donate the license, transmitter facilities and master control equipment of Fox affiliate KAUT (channel 43) in Oklahoma City to OETA, in an agreement - under which the donation of the license and equipment was contingent on Heritage completing its purchase of independent station KOKH-TV (channel 25) from Busse Broadcast Communications - that included a two-year option for the authority to purchase KAUT's remaining assets for $1.5 million. OETA had earlier been involved in a 1987 proposal by Visalia, California-based Pappas Telecasting Companies, under which Heritage would have donated the KAUT license to OETA for $1 million in exchange for Pappas acquiring the programming inventories of both KAUT and rival independent KGMC (channel 34, now KOCB), including the rights to channel 43's Fox affiliation, for transfer to channel 25, and entering into a 25-year lease to allow OETA to operate the KAUT transmitter facility for $1 per year; KGMC (then owned by Seraphim Media) was to have become a Home Shopping Network affiliate and acquire some religious programs to fill certain non-HSN timeslots. OETA planned to help fund the conversion of channel 43 into an educational station through start-up grants, including a $75,000 grant awarded by management from ABC affiliate KOCO-TV (channel 5). A later revision to the plan saw OETA file an application with the FCC to purchase KGMC as a <b>contingency</b> <b>measure.</b> OETA's involvement in the earlier plans received disapproval from then-Governor Henry Bellmon, who noted that authority management had earlier claimed it did not have enough funding to operate its existing stations adequately. The state legislature's OETA funding appropriation bill for FY1990 prohibited the authority from using state funds towards expenses for the proposed second educational station, and from proposing the appropriation of additional state funding to finance the acquisition and programming conversion if sufficient private funding was not obtained. Complicating matters further, Governor Bellmon called for a state audit of the Oklahoma Educational Television Authority to address allegations from a former employee that the member network's management had misused public funds, and that station employees were required to attend foundation-related meetings and worked for the foundation's pledge drive on state and additional uncompensated time. Although the deal would receive FCC approval, the Pappas deal was terminated in February 1989 after the company missed its deadline to finalize the KOKH purchase; the three stations continued on as rival commercial stations until the 1991 license donation.|$|E
5000|$|Derrida's {{philosophy}} is chiefly concerned with metaphysics, {{although he does}} not define it rigorously, and takes it to be [...] "the science of presence". In his own words:The history of metaphysics, like {{the history of the}} West, is the history of these metaphors and metonymies. Its matrix—if you will pardon me for demonstrating so little and for being so elliptical in order to bring me more quickly to my principal theme—is the determination of being as presence in all the senses of this word. It would be possible to show that all the names related to fundamentals, to principles, or to the center have always designated the constant of a presence--- eidos, arché, telos, energia, ousia, aletheia, transcendentality, consciousness, or conscience, God, man, and so forth.Derrida finds the root of this metaphysics, which he calls [...] "metaphysics of pure presence", in logos, which is internal to language itself. He calls this [...] "logocentrism", which is a tendency towards definitive truth-values through forced closure of structures. In his belief, it is the structure of language itself that forces us into metaphysics, best represented through truth-values, closures, speech as valorized by Socrates in Phaedrus. In fact, according to Derrida, Logocentrism is so all-pervasive that the mere act of opposing it cannot evade it by any margin. On the other hand, Derrida finds his Nietzschean hope (his own word is [...] "affirmation") in heterogeneity, contradictions, absence etc. To counter the privileged position of the speech (parole) or the phonè, he puts forward a new science of grammé or the unit of writing: grammatology. Unlike structuralists, Derrida does not see language as the one-to-one correspondence between signifier and signified; to him, language is a play of identity and difference, an endless chain of signifiers leading to other signifiers. In spite of all the logocentric tendencies towards closure, and truth-values, language, or text for that matter, always contradicts itself. This critique is inherent in all texts, not through a presence, but an absence of a presence long sought by logocentric visions. Influenced by some aspects of Freudian psycho-analysis, Derrida presents us the strategy of deconstruction, an amalgamation of Heidegger's concept of Destruktion and Levinas's concept of the Other. Deconstruction as a strategy tries to find the most surprising contradictions in texts, unravel it, and built over it. Instead of finding the truth, the closure, the steadfast meaning, it finds absence of presence, loophole, freeplay of meanings etc[...] It is this absence of presence that is termed as 'trace' by Derrida. However, he treats the word cautiously, and uses it only as a <b>contingency</b> <b>measure,</b> because the traditional meaning of the word 'trace' {{is a part of the}} scheme Derrida wants to denude. By the virtue of trace, signifiers always simultaneously differ and defer from the illusive signified. This is something Derrida calls [...] "Differance". According to him, [...] "Differance is the non-full, non-simple [...] "origin"; it is the structured and differing origin of differences". According to Derrida language is labyrinthine, inter-woven and inter-related, and the threads of this labyrinth are the differences, traces. Along with [...] "supplement", trace and difference conveys a picture of what language is to Derrida. All these terms are part of his strategy; he wants to use trace to [...] "indicate a way out of the closure imposed by the system...". Trace is, again, not presence but an empty simulation of it: The trace is not a presence but is rather the simulacrum of a presence that dislocates, displaces, and refers beyond itself. The trace has, properly speaking, no place, for effacement belongs to the very structure of the trace[...] [...] [...] In this way the metaphysical text is understood; it is still readable, and remains read. It is essentially an [...] "antistructuralist gesture", as he felt that the [...] "Structures were to be undone, decomposed, desedimented". Trace, or difference, is also pivotal in jeopardizing strict dichotomies:It has been necessary to analyze, to set to work, within the text of the history of philosophy, as well as within the so-called literary text,..., certain marks, shall we say,... that by analogy (I underline) I have called undecidables, that is, unities of simulacrum, [...] "false" [...] verbal properties (nominal or semantic) that can no longer be included within philosophical (binary) opposition, resisting and disorganizing it, without ever constituting a third term, without ever leaving room for a solution in the form of speculative dialectics.Trace is also not linear or chronological in any sense of the word,"This trace relates no less to what is called the future than what is called the past, and it constitutes what is called the present by the very relation to what it is not, to what it absolutely is not; that is, not even to a past or future considered as a modified present".Trace is a contingent strategy, a bricolage for Derrida that helps him produce a new concept of writing (as opposed to the Socratic or Saussurean speech), where [...] "The interweaving results in each 'element' - phoneme or grapheme - being constituted on the basis of the trace within it of the other elements of the chain or system. This interweaving, this textile, is the text produced only in the transformation of another text".|$|E
