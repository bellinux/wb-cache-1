25|$|Although he {{probably}} never visited the site, {{the existence of}} Topoxte was first reported by Juan Galindo in 1831, in his report to the Society of Antiquaries. Teoberto Maler spent three days at the site in 1904, <b>clearing</b> <b>the</b> <b>site</b> core and describing Building C and recording 9 stela-altar pairs. Sylvanus Morley visited Topoxte in 1914, describing the sculptured stelae of the site, including 2 on Cante Island. In 1933 Cyrus L. Lundell and L. C. Stuart made a new plan of the main plaza and assigned the nomenclature to the structures that is still used today. William R. Bullard carried out excavations at Topoxte from 1958 to 1960 and identified the Postclassic occupation of the site. Further excavations were carried out in 1973 and 1974 by Don and Prudence Rice, on Cante Island.|$|E
500|$|On September 22, 2006, Sound Transit and the Port of Seattle broke {{ground on}} the Airport Link extension, {{beginning}} three years of light rail and roadway construction. The airport's return-to-terminal ramps were closed for demolition in October, <b>clearing</b> <b>the</b> <b>site</b> of the future station. Construction of the SeaTac/Airport light rail station was bid out to Mowat Construction for $35.8 million in July 2007; the initial bid in March was set above Sound Transit's estimates at $95.3 million by Mowat, the sole bidder, and subsequently reduced {{the scope of the}} contract and removed elements of the station to bring costs down. A second contract signed with Mowat in February 2008 brought the total cost of the station's construction to $72 million. The [...] light rail guideway approaching the station would be built by PCL Construction as $38 million addition to their contract to build the guideway in Tukwila.|$|E
500|$|In 2007 a £350 {{million project}} was {{announced}} to develop 2,000 new homes and commercial {{properties in the}} waterfront area. The proposed development included the West Pond reclaimed land {{to the west of}} the number one dock, the South Quay, East Quay and Arno Quay. A £230 million version of the plan was approved in 2011, which included a new road linking the town centre to Barry Island, a school, hotel, restaurants, supermarket and public spaces. The first of two new medical centres had been built by 2008, south of the Barry-Cardiff railway line and opposite Thompson Street and to complement this, by December 2009 a new pedestrian footbridge had been opened, spanning the railway line and linking Thompson Street with the medical centre and Morrisons, other retail outlets and new Waterfront housing. In 2010, work had started on the construction of a new medical centre and pharmacy to become known as Westquay Medical Centre and a new pedestrian ramped access was being cast. The new surgery was opened at the end of October 2010. Like the, by then, Entrepreneurial Centre, already established alongside, the building stood on the site of the former Barry Railway Company's loco works and carriage sheds and on a level above the hydraulic engine house. By February 2012, work had started on <b>clearing</b> <b>the</b> <b>site</b> opposite the old hydraulic engine house in preparation for building a new hotel and inn and by June 2014, was open to the public as the Premier Inn and Brewers Fayre pub and carvery. [...] Further drastic change came by April 2015 when a new ASDA superstore with card-only fuelling facility was opened and this occupied most of land previously bearing the Powell Duffryn oil tank farm and former multiple railway sidings used latterly for storage of withdrawn steam locomotives held by Dai Woodham. The extant structure of the ‘listed’ hydraulic engine house opposite the Premier Inn, partly renovated prior to 2012, was involved in further internal renovation and facial improvements and car parking facilities were being prepared in August 2015. Later, its tapered square chimney was fitted with black vertical lettering on two faces. One facet shows PUMPHOUSE, and one shows TY PWMP, both being backlit during darkness, but initially, the necessary circumflex above the letter Y in the Welsh language, has not been fitted. An Espresso bar had been opened within the main building and the complementary car park, by December 2015.|$|E

2500|$|At {{the time}} the {{condominium}} project was failing, in 2008, CVS Pharmacy proposed a [...] store on Washington Avenue and Schwenk Drive. FOHK and preservationists collected 600 signatures on petitions opposing the development, saying a third chain drugstore in the uptown area would only drive an independent local drugstore on North Front Street out of business and make the city's main western gateway into a commercial strip indistinguishable from others in the country. One city alderman {{tried to stop the}} project with a building moratorium along Washington, which received the support of the Stockade's business association. It was eventually passed, excluding the CVS proposal. The city's Planning Board eventually approved the project, and construction crews began <b>clearing</b> <b>the</b> <b>site</b> in September 2009.|$|E
2500|$|The most {{significant}} {{attack on the}} perimeter of Camp Taji during the OIF II came on 5 June 2004 when two Vehicle Borne Improvised Explosive Devices (VBIED) exploded just outside Castle Gate. [...] The VBIED struck during the morning rush hour, just after 0800. The two vehicles detonated within {{a few seconds of}} each other, one directed against workers attempting to enter Camp Taji through Castle Gate to work at various construction sites, and one directed at a group of Iraqi men who were waiting in line to apply for work at an Iraqi security firm across the street from Camp Taji. Eighteen Iraqis were killed in the attack and approximately forty were wounded. Amazingly no U.S. soldiers were killed in this attack.
