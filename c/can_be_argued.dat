5|$|All {{observation}} involves both {{perception and}} cognition. That is, {{one does not}} make an observation passively, but rather is actively engaged in distinguishing the phenomenon being observed from surrounding sensory data. Therefore, observations are affected by one's underlying understanding {{of the way in}} which the world functions, and that understanding may influence what is perceived, noticed, or deemed worthy of consideration. In this sense, it <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>argued</b> that all observation is theory-laden.|$|E
5|$|The crisis had {{significant}} adverse economic effects and labour market effects, with unemployment rates in Greece and Spain reaching 27%, and was blamed for subdued economic growth, {{not only for}} the entire eurozone, but for the entire European Union. As such, it <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>argued</b> to have had a major political impact on the ruling governments in 10 out of 19 eurozone countries, contributing to power shifts in Greece, Ireland, France, Italy, Portugal, Spain, Slovenia, Slovakia, Belgium and the Netherlands, as well as outside of the eurozone, in the United Kingdom.|$|E
5|$|It <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>argued</b> {{that private}} charity is {{insufficient}} because {{the benefits from}} it accrue to people other than those who make the gifts—... a neighborhood effect. I am distressed {{by the sight of}} poverty; I am benefited by its alleviation; but I am benefited equally whether I or someone else pays for its alleviation; the benefits of other people's charity therefore partly accrue to me. To put it differently, we might all of us be willing to contribute to the relief of poverty, provided everyone else did. We might not be willing to contribute the same amount without such assurance. In small communities, public pressure can suffice to realize the proviso even with private charity. In the large impersonal communities that are increasingly coming to dominate our society, it is much more difficult for it to do so.|$|E

5|$|The {{ancestors}} of the modern Finnhorse were important throughout Finnish history, used as work horses and beasts of burden {{in every aspect of}} life from antiquity well into the 20thcentury. The modern breed's precise line of descent is unclear, but numerous outside influences have been recorded throughout the history of Finland. Linguistics suggest that horse has been in use in Finland in the bronze age, but the earliest archaeological evidence of horses existing in what today is Finland dates to the Finnish Middle Iron Age(400-800CE). The Finnhorse and its progenitors later became an indispensable asset for military forces from the region of Finland during the times of Swedish and Russian rule, and since independence as well. In addition to functionality as military and working horses, the Finnhorse has also been bred for speed in harness racing, and it <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>argued</b> that this sport was the main factor in the survival of the breed after its numbers crashed during the later half of the 20thcentury, from approximately 400,000 animals in the 1950s to 14,000 in the 1980s. In the 21st century, the numbers of the breed have stabilised at approximately 20,000 animals.|$|E
5|$|After {{all that}} has been said and done, {{what are we to}} make of Lloyd George’s legacy as a war leader? On the home front he {{achieved}} varied results in tackling difficult, and in some instances, unprecedented problems. It would be hard to have improved on his dealings with labour and the program to increase homegrown food, but in the sectors of manpower, price control and food distribution he adopted the same approach as his predecessor, taking action only in response to the changing nature of the conflict. In the vital area of national morale, while he did not have the technical advantages of Churchill, his personal conduct damaged his ability to do more to inspire the nation. All things considered, it is unlikely that any of his political contemporaries could have handled matters at home as effectively as he did, although it <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>argued</b> that if someone else had been in charge, the difference would not have been sufficient to change the final outcome. In his conduct of the war he did advance the cause of the Entente significantly in some ways, but in determining strategy, one of the most important tasks for which a prime minister must be responsible, he was undeniably a failure. To sum up, while Lord George's contributions outweighed his mistakes, the margin is too narrow, in my opinion, to include him In the pantheon of Britain's outstanding war leaders.|$|E

25|$|Use {{of gross}} {{domestic}} product or gross national product should be treated with caution as this does not accurately measure a country's ability to provide aid.

25|$|An {{important}} {{movement in}} modern Persian literature {{centered on the}} question of modernization and Westernization and whether these terms are synonymous when describing the evolution of Iranian society. It <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>argued</b> that almost all advocates of modernism in Persian literature, from Akhundzadeh, Kermani, and Malkom Khan to Dehkhoda, Aref, Bahar, and Taqi Rafat, were inspired by developments and changes that had occurred in Western, particularly European, literatures. Such inspirations did not mean blindly copying Western models but, rather, adapting aspects of Western literature and changing them to fit the needs of Iranian culture.|$|E

25|$|Mycorrhizas {{from the}} Miocene exhibit a {{vesicular}} morphology closely resembling that of present Glomerales.

25|$|On September 13, 2012 federal {{prosecutors}} in Manhattan, acting {{on behalf of}} the U.S. government, appealed the judge's permanent injunction. In court papers on September 14, 2012, they also asked the judge to immediately freeze her order until it is taken up by the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New York. More precisely the U.S. government sought both an immediate temporary stay on Judge Forrest's September 12, 2012 ruling so that the matter <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>argued,</b> and a permanent one lasting until higher courts resolve the case.|$|E
25|$|It <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>argued</b> that superheroes, the uniquely American {{contribution}} to comic books, owe their origin to New York, {{despite the fact}} that the first superhero, Superman, was created by two artists from Cleveland, Ohio. Even when not based explicitly in New York, superhero stories often make use of recognizable stand-ins for the city, such as Metropolis or Gotham City (Gotham being a common nickname for New York). The form and narrative conventions of superhero stories frequently dictate New York-sized cities as the settings, even generically.|$|E

25|$|It <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>argued</b> {{that within}} this {{backdrop}} of mostly indistinguishable types, exceptions {{would be far}} more pronounced. Atypical reverses are usually seen during and after periods of war, at which time emperors make various claims of liberation, subjugation, and pacification. Some of these reverse images can clearly be classified as propaganda. An example struck by emperor Philip in 244 features a legend proclaiming the establishment of peace with Persia; in truth, Rome had been forced to pay large sums in tribute to the Persians.|$|E
25|$|Some Japanese {{scholars}} {{interpret the}} Gwanggaeto Stele, erected in 414 by King Jangsu of Goguryeo, as describing a Japanese invasion {{in the southern}} portion of the Korean peninsula. However, Mohan claims that Goguryeo fabricated the Japanese invasion {{in order to justify}} its conquest of Baekje. If this stele was a dedication to a Korean king, it <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>argued</b> that it would logically highlight Korea's conquests and not dedicate it to a strange incident regarding Japan. In any case, because of these various possible interpretations, the circumstances surrounding the stele are still highly debated and inconclusive.|$|E
25|$|As a result, White {{frequently}} championed {{nineteenth century}} evolutionists {{in a search}} for intellectual predecessors unclaimed or denounced by Boasians. This stance can be clearly seen in his views of evolution, which are firmly rooted in the writings of Herbert Spencer, Charles Darwin, and Lewis H. Morgan. While it <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>argued</b> that White's exposition of Morgan and Spencer's was tendentious, it can be safely said that White's concepts of science and evolution were firmly rooted in their work. Advances in population biology and evolutionary theory passed White by and, unlike Steward, his conception of evolution and progress remained firmly rooted in the nineteenth century.|$|E
50|$|The third {{argument}} {{cannot be}} refuted.

These correlations <b>can</b> <b>be</b> (and <b>are)</b> <b>argued</b> in the opposite direction as well, however; the similarities between the Commentariolum and M.
