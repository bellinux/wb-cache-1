25|$|First, {{although}} single crystals of YBCO have a {{very high}} <b>critical</b> <b>current</b> density, polycrystals {{have a very}} low <b>critical</b> <b>current</b> density: only a small current can be passed while maintaining superconductivity. This problem is due to crystal grain boundaries in the material. When the grain boundary angle is greater than about 5°, the supercurrent cannot cross the boundary. The grain boundary problem can be controlled to some extent by preparing thin films via CVD or by texturing the material to align the grain boundaries.|$|E

In this respect epitaxially grown thin films of YBa 2 Cu 3 O 7 -d (YBCO) are proving to be the strongest candidates for many widescale applications that are close to realization. We show that the relation between different defect structures and flux line pinning in these films exhibits universal features which are clearly displayed in a detailed analysis of the temperature-dependent behaviour of local <b>critical</b> <b>currents.</b> This allows us to identify different pinning mechanisms at different temperatures to be responsible for the found <b>critical</b> <b>currents.</b> Additionally, the presence of grain boundaries with very low misorientation angles affects the temperature stability of the <b>critical</b> <b>currents</b> which has important consequences for future applications.

40|$|Maximum entropy {{inference}} {{can be used}} to find equations for the <b>critical</b> <b>currents</b> (Jc) in a type II superconductor as {{a function}} of temperature, applied magnetic field, and angle of the applied field, θ or φ . This approach provides an understanding of how the macroscopic <b>critical</b> <b>currents</b> arise from averaging over different sources of vortex pinning. The dependence of <b>critical</b> <b>currents</b> on temperature and magnetic field can be derived with logarithmic constraints and accord with expressions which have been widely used with empirical justification since the first development of technical superconductors. In this paper we provide a physical interpretation of the constraints leading to the distributions for Jc(T) and Jc(B), and discuss the implications for experimental data analysis. We expand the maximum entropy analysis of angular Jc data to encompass samples which have correlated defects at arbitrary angles to the crystal axes giving both symmetric and asymmetric peaks and samples which show vortex channeling behavior. The distributions for angular data are derived using combinations of first, second or fourth order constraints on cot θ or cot φ . We discuss why these distributions apply whether or not correlated defects are aligned with the crystal axes and thereby provide a unified description of <b>critical</b> <b>currents</b> in superconductors.
