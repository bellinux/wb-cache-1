Control of {{other risk factors}} for cardiovascular disease is required, as risk remains somewhat elevated even when cholesterol levels are controlled. Professional guidelines recommend {{that the decision to}} treat a person with FH with statins should not be based on the usual risk prediction tools (such as those derived from the Framingham Heart Study), as they are likely to underestimate the risk of cardiovascular disease; unlike the rest of the population, FH have had high levels of cholesterol since birth, probably increasing their relative risk. Prior to the introduction of the statins, clofibrate (an older fibrate that often caused gallstones), probucol (especially in large xanthomas) and thyroxine were used to reduce LDL cholesterol levels.|$|E

50|$|Like cholestyramine, <b>colestipol</b> {{works in}} the gut by {{trapping}} bile acids and preventing them from being reabsorbed.

50|$|Bile acid {{sequestrants}} (e.g. cholestyramine, <b>colestipol,</b> etc.): If taken together, {{bile acid}} resins may bind to fenofibrate, {{resulting in a}} decrease in fenofibrate absorption.

50|$|There are {{foods and}} other {{substances}} that {{can interfere with}} absorption of thyroxine. Examples include calcium and iron supplements taken within four hours of levothyroxine, Other substances that reduce absorption are aluminium and magnesium containing antacids, simethicone, sucralfate, cholestyramine, <b>colestipol,</b> and polystyrene sulfonate. Grapefruit juice may delay the absorption of levothyroxine, but based on a study of 10 healthy people aged 20-30 (8 men, 2 women) {{it may not have}} a significant effect on bioavailability in young adults. A study of eight women suggested that coffee may interfere with the intestinal absorption of levothyroxine, though at a level less than eating bran. Certain other substances can cause adverse effects that may be severe. Combination of levothyroxine with ketamine may cause hypertension and tachycardia; and tricyclic and tetracyclic antidepressants increase its toxicity. On the other hand, lithium can cause hyperthyroidism (but most often hypothyroidism) by affecting iodine metabolism of the thyroid itself and thus inhibits synthetic levothyroxine as well.|$|E

40|$|The {{effect of}} the bile acid sequestrant, <b>colestipol</b> hydrochloride, on the {{incidence}} of dimethylhydrazine-induced tumors of the large intestine was determined in male Swiss mice. The subcutaneous administration of dimethylhydrazine (15 mg/kg) produced tumors in approximately 89 % of the animals {{with an average of}} 1. 70 tumors per tumor-bearing animal. When carcinogen-treated animals received dietary <b>colestipol</b> (0. 52 %, w/w) from 4 weeks prior to the first injection of dimethylhydrazine until the time of death, there was {{an increase in the number}} of tumors per tumor-bearing animal to 2. 23. In an attempt to understand the nature of this enhancement, animals were administered dietary <b>colestipol</b> at different times in relation to the administration of the carcinogen. The number of tumors per tumor-bearing animal for the different protocols was: post-initiation <b>colestipol</b> exposure, 1. 70; <b>colestipol</b> exposure concomitant with dimethylhydrazine, 1. 41; pre-initiation <b>colestipol</b> exposure, 2. 23. Thus, <b>colestipol</b> appeared to function both as an anticarcinogen and as a promoter (pre-initiation). Since <b>colestipol</b> has the capacity to bind a number of chemical agents, the different biological effects probably reflect the multifactorial nature of colorectal cancer with the end result dependent on the balance between opposing factors.

40|$|The {{effect of}} oral {{administration}} of the non-absorbable anion-exchange resins cholestyramine and <b>colestipol</b> on the systemic clearance and other pharmacokinetic parameters of intravenously administered ibuprofen (25 mg kg- 1) was studied in rabbits. Single doses of <b>colestipol</b> hydrochloride (0. 4 g kg- 1) or cholestyramine (0. 17 g kg- 1) were given 30 min before ibuprofen administration. In cholestyramine-treated rabbits {{a significant reduction in}} ibuprofen plasma concentration was observed compared with both control (water only) and colestipol-treated rabbits. Cholestyramine treatment resulted in a significant decrease in the terminal elimination half-life and the mean residence time. Furthermore, a 31 % increase in the systemic clearance and 23 % decrease in the area under the plasma concentration-time curve were also observed in cholestyramine-treated rabbits. <b>Colestipol</b> treatment did not change these parameters.

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{equivalent}} hypolipidaemic doses of cholestyramine (8 g) or <b>colestipol</b> (10 g) on the plasma concentrations of propranolol and 4 '-hydroxypropranolol was studied in 12 normal volunteers following the oral administration of 120 mg of normal release propranolol tablets. When two doses of either cholestyramine or <b>colestipol</b> were administered {{prior to the}} propranolol, the peak plasma concentrations and area under the curve for both propranolol and the metabolite 4 '-hydroxypropranolol were reduced significantly (P less than 0. 05). We conclude that the drug interaction between cholestyramine or <b>colestipol</b> and propranolol leads to significant reductions in plasma concentrations of propranolol and 4 '-hydroxypropranolol which may cause a clinically diminished effect for a given dosage.

40|$|Twenty {{subjects}} with familial hypercholesterolemia (12 Type IIa and 8 Type IIb), previously treated with <b>Colestipol</b> for 16 months, {{were subjected to}} therapy with <b>Colestipol</b> (15 g/day) + clofibrate (2 g/day) for 15 months. During the second treatment period these patients continued to follow the isocaloric hypocholesterolemic diet initiated during the original trial. In Type IIa patients, the association of these drugs enhanced the decrease in plasma cholesterol levels. The total mean decrease was - 40 +/- 17 mg/dl (P less than 0. 05). In Type IIb patients, on the other hand, the association of clofibrate with <b>Colestipol</b> induced an increase in plasma cholesterol levels. The total mean increase was + 24 +/- 7 mg/dl (P less than 0. 05). A markedly significant decrease in plasma triglyceride levels was observed in this group (- 107 +/- 30; P less than 0. 01). These results seem to indicate that, in Type IIa, clofibrate increased the resin's hypocholesterolemic effect. In Type IIb, on the other hand, the association of these drugs {{did not seem to}} be indicated since a marked hypotriglyceridemic effect was accompanied by an increase in plasma cholesterol levels.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Small, dense LDL {{particles}} {{are associated with}} coronary artery disease (CAD) and predict angiographic changes in response to lipid-lowering therapy.

Since bile acid sequestering resins {{are often used}} in combination with HMGRIs to enhance cholesterol reduction, this trial was conducted to explore the use of atorvastatin alone and combined with <b>colestipol</b> in patients with primary hyperlipidemia. Metlids and Results: One hundred six patients with low-density lipoprotein (LDL) choles-terol> 4. 1 mM/L (160 mddL) and plasma triglycerides < 3. 9 mh 4 L (350 mg/dL) were ran-domized to treatment consisting of 20 glday <b>colestipol,</b> 10 mg/day atorvastatin, or 10 mg/day atorvastatin plus 20 dday <b>colestipol</b> for 12 weeks.

40|$|Cholesterol is an {{integral}} part of the cell membrane and influences both its fluidity and activity. Furthermore membrane lipids are influenced by plasma lipid levels. In familial hypercholesterolaemia (FH) red cell rheology and platelet aggregation is abnormal. These effects could be due to changes in plasma lipids since they are improved by cholesterol reduction. Section A Fasting lipid profile, membrane cholesterol, red cell ghost and platelet fluidity [using diphenyl hexatriene (DPH) and trimethylamino-diphenyl hexatriene (TMA-DPH) fluorescence anisotropy] and Ca 2 + -Mg 2 + -ATPase activity (using [32 P] ATP hydrolysis) in 30 patients with heterozygous FH and 19 controls were compared before and after treatment with <b>colestipol</b> (10 g), simvastatin (10 mg) and maxepa (10 g). The two groups were generally comparable with respect to age, sex, BMI and blood pressure. In FH plasma cholesterol, membrane cholesterol, TMA-DPH anisotropy and red cell Ca 2 + -Mg 2 + -ATPase were increased whilst platelet Ca 2 + -Mg 2 + -ATPase was reduced (p< 0. 05). <b>Colestipol</b> and simvastatin reversed these changes toward controls. Maxepa increased DPH anisotropy and reduced Ca 2 +-Mg 2 + -ATPase. In FH membrane fluidity and activity is altered and normalised by cholesterol lowering. This may account for the abnormal cell function in this condition. Section B A double blind, randomized, placebo controlled trial in hypercholesterolaemia (cholesterol 6. 5 - 10 mmol/l, triglycerides < 3 mmol/l). After 8 weeks of an AHA step I diet, patients were randomized to A: placebo; B: 5 g <b>colestipol</b> + 10 mg simvastatin; or C: 10 g <b>colestipol</b> + 10 mg simvastatin for 8 weeks. Patients were assessed 4 weekly. 44 patients were screened, 32 completed the study. Groups were generally comparable (group C patients were older p< 0. 02). Active treatment resulted in a 38 % reduction in LDL cholesterol (p 0. 8). Mild gastro-intestinal upset was the commonest adverse event. Low dose combinations are effective and well tolerated. There is no apparent advantage of 10 g over 5 g <b>colestipol</b> when combined with l 0 mg simvastatin. HDL cholesterol and triglycerides were unchanged...|$|E
40|$|Freshly {{isolated}} mononuclear leukocytes {{have been}} reported to show changes in cholesterol synthesis and high-affinity degradation of low-density lipoproteins (LDL) that parallel those that occur in the liver. To examine whether hypolipidemic therapy in patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia influences cholesterol homeostasis in their mononuclear cells we assessed the effects of <b>colestipol</b> and nicotinic acid (alone and in combination) on the rates of high-affinity 125 I-labeled LDL degradation and on the rates of cholesterol and phosphatidylcholine biosynthesis by freshly isolated cells. Rates of 125 I-labeled LDL degradation were lower in mononuclear cells from patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia on no medication (3. 1 ng per 4 X 10 (6) cells per 5 hr) than in cells from normal control subjects (6. 1 ng per 4 X 10 (6) cells per 5 hr) and, in the former patients, the values were not significantly affected by therapy with nicotinic acid. In contrast, freshly isolated mononuclear cells from patients receiving <b>colestipol</b> degraded 125 I-labeled LDL at near-normal rates (5. 0 ng per 4 X 10 (6) cells per 5 hr). The rates of cholesterol synthesis were also higher in mononuclear cells isolated from patients treated with <b>colestipol</b> than in cells from untreated patients or from those receiving nicotinic acid; in contrast the rate of synthesis of phosphatidylcholine did not show any consistent changes. Similar results were obtained in a smaller number of patients studied longitudinally, in which <b>colestipol</b> therapy significantly increased rates of cholesterol synthesis and high-affinity degradation of 125 I-labeled LDL by freshly isolated mononuclear cells. We conclude that previously observed changes in cholesterol homeostasis in the liver of patients treated with bile acid sequestrants are paralleled by similar changes in freshly isolated mononuclear cells and that these cells offer an accessible model for further studies on how diet and pharmacologic agents influence cellular cholesterol homeostasis in humans...|$|E
40|$|The {{functional}} interrelationship between biliary cholesterol secretion, sinusoidal lipoprotein cholesterol secretion and {{bile salt}} synthesis was {{studied in the}} rat. Diosgenin, fructose, and <b>colestipol</b> in the diet were used to, respectively, influence bili-ary cholesterol output, VLDL production and bile salt synthe-sis. In the acute bile fistula rat, biliary cholesterol output was 700 % increased by diosgenin and 50 % decreased by fructose. In the rats fed both diosgenin and fructose, biliary cholesterol secretion was increased only by 200 %, whereas biliary bile salts and phospholipid outputs were unchanged. In the isolated perfused liver, VLDL-cholesterol output was 50 % reduced by diosgenin alone, but was unchanged fol-lowing feeding of diosgenin plus fructose. However, the livers of rats fed diosgenin plus fructose exhibited a 700 % increase in VLDL-triglyceride production and a 200 % increase in VLDL-cholesterol output. A significant reciprocal relationship be-tween VLDL-cholesterol secretion and the coupling ratio of cholesterol to bile salts in bile was observed. <b>Colestipol</b> added to the diet maintained both sinusoidal and biliary cholesterol outputs within the normal range. In the chronic bile fistula rat, <b>colestipol</b> increased bile salt synthesis by 100 % while diosgenin and fructose diets had no effect. Similarly, the addition of fructose to the <b>colestipol</b> diet did not decrease bile salt synthesis. These data suggest a reciprocal relationship between bili-ary cholesterol secretion and hepatic secretion of cholesterol as VLDL particles. The free cholesterol pool used for bile salt synthesis seems functionally unrelated to the pool from which VLDL-cholesterol and biliary cholesterol originate. These findings {{support the idea that}} metabolic compartmentalization of hepatic cholesterol is a major determinant of the quantity of cholesterol available for recruitment by the bile salt-dependent biliary cholesterol secretory mechanism...|$|E
40|$|Patients in the {{original}} Familial Atherosclerosis Treatment Study (FATS) cohort were subgrouped into those with triglyceride levels or = 190 mg/dL (n = 40). Their therapeutic responses to niacin plus <b>colestipol,</b> lovastatin plus <b>colestipol,</b> <b>colestipol</b> alone, or placebo were determined. Therapeutic response was also determined in the same 2 triglyceride subgroups (n = 12 and n = 27, respectively) of patients selected for low levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and coronary artery disease. These triglyceride criteria were chosen to identify patient subgroups with high likelihood of "pattern A" (normal-size low-density lipoprotein [LDL] particles and triglyceride or = 190 mg/dL). Our findings in these small patient subgroups {{are consistent with the}} emerging understanding that coronary artery disease patients presenting with high triglyceride levels have lower HDL-C, smaller less buoyant LDL-C, and greater very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) cholesterol and VLDL apolipoprotein B, and are more responsive to therapy as assessed by an increase in HDL-C and reduction in triglycerides, VLDL-C, and VLDL apolipoprotein B. In the FATS high-triglyceride subgroup with these characteristics, a tendency toward greater therapeutic improvement in coronary stenosis severity was observed among those treated with either of the 2 forms of intensive cholesterol-lowering therapy.

40|$|In {{the present}} work, we studied {{the effect of}} cholesterol/phospholipid (CH/PL) molar ratio on {{aluminum}} accumulation and aluminum-induced alteration of membrane fluidity in rat brain cortex synaptosomes. We observed that sub-acute (daily supply of 1. 00 g of AlCl 3 during 10 days) and chronic (daily supply of 0. 03 g of AlCl 3 during 4 months) exposure to dietary aluminum leads to a synaptosomal aluminum enrichment of 45 and 59 %, respectively. During chronic exposure to AlCl 3, the enhancement of aluminum content was prevented by administration of <b>colestipol</b> (0. 31 g/day), which decreased the synaptosomal membrane CH/PL molar ratio (nmol/nmol) from 1. 2 to 0. 4. Fluorescence anisotropy analysis, using 1, 6 -diphenyl- 1, 3, 5 -hexatriene (DPH) and 1 -(4 -(trimethylamino) phenyl) - 6 -phenylhexa- 1, 3, 5 -triene (TMA-DPH), showed that after treatment with <b>colestipol</b> a decrease in membrane order occurs {{at the level of}} hydrophilic lipid-water surface and deeper hydrophobic region of the synaptosomal membrane. When the rats were exposed to aluminum, it was observed a significant enhancement of membrane fluidity, which was more pronounced {{at the level of the}} membrane hydrophilic regions. Meanwhile, when chronic exposure to dietary AlCl 3 was accompanied by treatment with <b>colestipol,</b> the aluminum-induced decrease in membrane order was negligible when compared to TMA-DPH and DPH anisotropy values measured upon <b>colestipol</b> treatment. In contrast, in vitro incubation of synaptosomes (isolated from control rats) with AlCl 3 induced a concentration-dependent rigidification of this more hydrophilic membrane region. The opposite action of aluminum on synaptosomal membrane fluidity, during in vivo and in vitro experiments, appears to be explained by alteration of synaptosomal CH/PL molar ratio, since a significant reduction (similar to 80 %) of this parameter occurs during in vivo exposure to aluminum. In conclusion, during in vivo exposure to aluminum, fluidification of hydrophilic regions and reduction of CH/PL molar ratio of presynaptic membranes accompany the accumulation of this cation, which appear to restrict aluminum retention in brain cortex nerve terminals.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Lipid-lowering therapy (LL-Rx) reduces {{coronary}} artery disease (CAD) but the response varies amongst individuals. We investigated the contribution of three genetic forms of dyslipidaemia characterized by elevated plasma apo B, familial hypercholesterolaemia (FH), familial combined hyperlipidaemia (FCHL), and elevated Lp(a), to the angiographic response with LL-Rx. METHODS AND RESULTS: Fifty-one men, with premature CAD and elevated plasma apo B, were selected in whom a genetic diagnosis was based on lipid phenotypes in relatives. Subjects received conventional (diet +/- <b>colestipol)</b> or intensive LL-Rx (niacin or lovastatin plus <b>colestipol).</b> Clinical parameters and CAD severity were measured before and after 2 years of treatment. Twenty-seven patients had FCHL, 12 FH and 12 elevated Lp(a). Regression of coronary stenosis was dependent {{on the effect of}} therapy (P < 0. 001), genetic form of dyslipidaemia (P = 0. 004) and the interaction between the two variables (P = 0. 02). Significant regression of coronary stenosis occurred only in FCHL and Lp(a) (P = 0. 03, vs. control groups); CAD progression was only slowed in FH. CONCLUSIONS: Three genetic forms of dyslipidaemia were associated with different angiographic outcomes during intensive LL-Rx. Different forms of dyslipidaemia therefore may require different lipid-lowering strategy. Patients with FH and buoyant LDL require more aggressive reduction of LDL cholesterol whilst those with either FCHL or elevated Lp(a) with dense LDL need LDL cholesterol reduction as well as therapies aimed at reduction of the small, dense LDL particles...|$|E
40|$|Patients with {{heterozygous}} {{familial hypercholesterolemia}} have a 50 % deficiency of receptors for plasma low density lipoproteins (LDL) that induces a marked increase in plasma LDL levels. Two therapeutic measures {{that seem to}} increase the synthesis of LDL receptors are interruption of the enterohepatic circulation of bile acids with either bile-acid sequestrants or the Meal-exclusion operation, and competitive inhibition of 3 -hydroxy- 3 -methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase with mevinolin or compactin. To determine {{the effectiveness of this}} combination and the mechanisms of lowering LDL levels, we measured turnover rates of LDL apoprotein (apo-LDL) before and during treatment with mevinolin and <b>colestipol</b> in eight patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia. Drug therapy reduced LD...|$|E
