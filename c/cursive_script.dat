5|$|More than 99 {{percent of}} the {{population}} speaks Japanese as their first language. Japanese is an agglutinative language distinguished by a system of honorifics reflecting the hierarchical nature of Japanese society, with verb forms and particular vocabulary indicating the relative status of speaker and listener. Japanese writing uses kanji (Chinese characters) and two sets of kana (syllabaries based on <b>cursive</b> <b>script</b> and radical of kanji), as well as the Latin alphabet and Arabic numerals.|$|E
5|$|By the mid-1st {{millennium}} BC, hieroglyphs and hieratic {{were still}} used for royal, monumental, religious, and funerary writings, while a new, even more <b>cursive</b> <b>script</b> {{was used for}} informal, day-to-day writing: Demotic. The final script adopted by the ancient Egyptians was the Coptic alphabet, a revised version of the Greek alphabet. Coptic became the standard in the 4th century AD when Christianity became the state religion throughout the Roman Empire; hieroglyphs were discarded as idolatrous images of a pagan tradition, unfit for writing the Biblical canon.|$|E
5|$|First {{discovered}} in March 1973, the tablets were initially {{thought to be}} wood shavings until one of the excavators found two stuck together and peeled them apart to discover writing on the inside. They {{were taken to the}} epigraphist Richard Wright, but rapid oxygenation of the wood meant that they were black and unreadable {{by the time he was}} able to view them. They were sent to Alison Rutherford at Newcastle University Medical School for multi-spectrum photography, which led to infra-red photographs showing the scripts for researchers for the first time. The results were initially disappointing as the scripts were undecipherable. However, Alan Bowman at Manchester University and David Thomas at Durham University analysed the previously unknown form of <b>cursive</b> <b>script</b> and were able to produce transcriptions.|$|E

5|$|One {{striking}} {{example of}} multilingualism {{as well as}} multiculturalism in the Empire is a 2nd-century epitaph for a woman named Regina, discovered in 1878 near the Roman fort at South Shields, northeast England. The inscription is written in Latin and Palmyrene Aramaic, the language of Regina's husband, Barates, who has been identified with a standardbearer (vexillarius) of that name from Palmyra, Syria. He was most likely in the military stationed along Hadrian's Wall. The Latin, however, is constructed grammatically {{in the manner of}} Greek honorific inscriptions typical of Palmyra, suggesting that Barates was bilingual in Aramaic and Greek, and added Latin as a third language. The Latin portion is larger and longer, and provides most of the information. The Palmyrene is carved in a fluid <b>cursive</b> <b>script,</b> and conveys only the name of Regina and an expression of grief. Since few people in Britain could have read Palmyrene, its use may be Barates' personal statement of his identity and emotions. A fourth linguistic element is the name Regina, which can be either Latin or Celtic. Such names seem often to have been chosen for their deliberate duality. Regina herself is identified as from the British Catuvellauni, a people whose civitas capital was Verulamium, but the Gallo-Brittonic spelling Catuallauna (feminine) is used in the Latin inscription.|$|E

30|$|In {{traditional}} segmentation-based approaches, {{the performance}} of character recognition depended on character segmentation accuracy (Naz et al. 2013 b). As discussed earlier in “Urdu–Nasta’liq script” section, explicit segmentation of <b>cursive</b> Nasta’liq <b>script</b> is difficult and prone to errors (Naz et al. 2015 b). The new trend is diverting towards implicit segmentation as these approaches, especially the ones based on Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), have shown promising results for <b>cursive</b> <b>scripts.</b> In the following text, we discuss the benchmark results based on implicit segmentation for different languages using RNN classifier.|$|R

25|$|Meanwhile, modern <b>cursive</b> <b>script</b> slowly {{emerged from}} the {{clerical}} cursive (zhāngcǎo) script during the Cao Wei to Jin period, {{under the influence of}} both semi-cursive and the newly emerged regular script.

25|$|The {{history of}} {{alphabetic}} writing {{goes back to}} the consonantal writing system used for Semitic languages in the Levant in the 2nd millennium BCE. Most or nearly all alphabetic scripts used throughout the world today ultimately go back to this Semitic proto-alphabet. Its first origins {{can be traced back to}} a Proto-Sinaitic script developed in Ancient Egypt to represent the language of Semitic-speaking workers in Egypt. This script was partly influenced by the older Egyptian hieratic, a <b>cursive</b> <b>script</b> related to Egyptian hieroglyphs.|$|E
25|$|After World War II, Japan also {{simplified}} {{a number}} of Chinese characters (kanji) used in the Japanese language. The new forms are called shinjitai. Compared to Chinese, the Japanese reform was more limited, simplifying {{only a few hundred}} characters, most of which were already in use in <b>cursive</b> <b>script.</b> Further, the list of simplifications was exhaustive, unlike Chinese simplification– thus analogous simplifications of not explicitly simplified characters (extended shinjitai) are not approved, and instead standard practice is to use the traditional forms.|$|E

25|$|The use of <b>cursive</b> <b>script</b> coexisted with kufic, {{but because}} {{in the early stages}} of their {{development}} they lacked discipline and elegance, cursive were usually used for informal purposes. With the rise of Islam, new script was needed to fit the pace of conversions, and a well defined cursive called naskh first appeared in the 10th century. The script is the most ubiquitous among other styles, used in Qur'ans, official decrees, and private correspondence. It became the basis of modern Arabic print.|$|E
25|$|Besides the codical glyphs, {{there existed}} a <b>cursive</b> <b>script</b> of an often dynamic character, found in wall-paintings and on ceramics, and imitated in stone on panels from Palenque (such as the 'Tablet of the 96 glyphs'). Often, written {{captions}} are enclosed in square 'boxes' of various shapes within the representation. Wall paintings may also entirely consist of texts (Ek' Balam, Naj Tunich), or, more rarely, astrological computations (Xultun); sometimes, {{written on a}} white stuccoed surface, and executed with particular care and elegance, these texts are like enlargements of book pages.|$|E
25|$|In {{handwritten}} text, {{the actual}} {{form of the}} extra marking may vary {{from a pair of}} dots to a pair of short vertical bars, to a single horizontal bar, or to a wavy line resembling a tilde. In practice, almost any diacritic situated above the base glyph (for example, á ā ã) would probably be interpreted as a carelessly written pair of dots (ä). However, in computerized character sets, these alternatives are incorrect. The front-vowel counterpart of u using the glyph y rather than ü is carried over from Swedish, and additionally avoids confusion in <b>cursive</b> <b>script</b> with ii, which is common in Finnish.|$|E

25|$|Beach {{appeared}} on {{maps of the}} time, notably that of Abraham Ortelius of 1570 and that of Jan Huygen van Linschoten of 1596, as the northernmost part of the southern continent, the Terra Australis, along with Locach. According to Marco Polo, Locach was a kingdom where gold was “so plentiful that no one who did not see it could believe it”. Beach {{was in fact a}} mistranscription of Locach. Locach was Marco Polo’s name for the southern Thai kingdom of Lavo, or Lop Buri, the “city of Lavo”, (ลพบุรี, after Lavo, the son of Rama in Hindu mythology). In Chinese (Cantonese), Lavo was pronounced “Lo-huk” (羅斛), from which Marco Polo took his rendition of the name. In the German <b>cursive</b> <b>script,</b> “Locach” and “Boeach” look similar, and in the 1532 edition of Marco Polo’s Travels his Locach was changed to Boëach, later shortened to Beach.|$|E
25|$|The {{earliest}} complete Judeo-Arabic copy of Maimonides' Guide for the Perplexed, copied in Yemen in 1380, {{was found}} in the India Office Library and added to the collection of the British Library in 1992. Another manuscript, copied in 1396 on vellum and written in Spanish <b>cursive</b> <b>script,</b> but discovered in Yemen by bibliophile, David Solomon Sassoon, was formerly housed at the Sassoon Library in Letchworth, England, but has since been acquired by Toronto University. The manuscript has an introduction written by Samuel ben Judah ibn Tibbon, and is nearly complete, {{with the exception of a}} lacuna between two of its pages. Containing a total of 496 pages, written in two columns of 23 lines to a column, with 229 illuminations, the manuscript has been described by David Solomon Sassoon in his Descriptive Catalogue of the Hebrew and Samaritan Manuscripts in the Sassoon Library. In the Bodleian Library at Oxford University, England, there are at least fifteen incomplete copies and fragments of the original Arabic text, all described by Dr. A. Neubauer in his Catalogue of Hebrew Manuscripts. Two Leyden manuscripts (cod. 18 and 211) have also the original Arabic texts, as do various manuscripts of the Bibliothèque Nationale in Paris (No. 760, very old; 761 and 758, copied by Rabbi Saadia ibn Danan). A copy of the original Arabic text was also stored at the Berlin Royal Library (now Berlin State Library), under the category Ms. Or. Qu., 579 (105 in Catalogue of Moritz Steinschneider); it is defective in the beginning and at the end. Hebrew translations of the Arabic texts, made by Samuel ibn Tibbon and Judah al-Harizi, albeit, independently of each other, abound in university and state libraries.|$|E
