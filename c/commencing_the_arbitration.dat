5000|$|Cardamone next {{turned to}} the {{statutory}} justification for the proceedings, asking whether it {{could be considered a}} vexatious attempt to multiply proceedings. He reiterated his earlier findings, adding to the record his observation that Shearson's attorney had also told MacMahon in writing that the judge had never considered the issue of the proper forum. In fact, he suggested, it was Shearson who had engaged in underhanded behavior: Shearson's counsel, after agreeing to the form of an order to be submitted to the court directing plaintiffs to <b>commence</b> <b>the</b> <b>arbitration,</b> thereafter attempted to nullify plaintiffs' right of election by commencing arbitration himself in a different forum. Examining appellant's alternatives for preserving his clients' right to choose a forum, we conclude that his choices were limited. One was a return to federal court—where the judge had already refused to rule. Another was to seek relief from state court, pursuant to a New York statute governing <b>arbitration</b> ... Appellant chose <b>the</b> latter course of action. It was perhaps unorthodox, but under the circumstances we do not think it may be characterized either as subterfuge or an attempt to evade the jurisdiction of the federal court. While the state court proceeding necessarily forced the opposing party to expend time, effort and money, that factor alone certainly cannot make it sanctionable so long as it was a good faith attempt to preserve what counsel believed to be his clients' right to choose an arbitral forum. Any action taken on behalf of one's client during litigation generally causes an opposing party to expend time and money ... Moreover, it may fairly be said that Shearson's actions—more than appellants—unreasonably and vexatiously multiplied these proceedings. Shearson, after all, <b>commenced</b> <b>arbitration</b> contrary to <b>the</b> terms of the court order it had agreed upon.|$|R

40|$|Arbitration {{has been}} critiziced for {{becoming}} slower {{and more like}} traditional court procedures. Even though arbitration still has {{an important role to}} play on the international dispute market, it is important to respond to the critique and try to keep up to date. This way arbitration can assure its position as favorable option also in the future. It is also important to keep arbitration as a real alternative to court litigation. The longer a procedure is drawn out, the more unpredictable the costs become. Speed and costs go hand in hand, and a lengthy procedure can produce really unforeseeable costs. The best way of controlling <b>the</b> costs of <b>arbitration</b> is by controlling the speed of the procedure. Besides, the obvious positive effects a speedier procedure can have on the direct costs, speed also has a value in itself. For any business, disputes are troublesome and should be dealt with as soon as possible. In this thesis, I try to respond to the critique aimed at arbitration, and come up with ideas on how it could become more efficient. I also analyze what impact accelerated procedures can have on the due process requirements of <b>arbitration.</b> In <b>the</b> end I also discuss {{whether or not there is}} a real need for more speed, or if expedition is actually overshadowed by a loss in quality. The big question is, can arbitration be accelerated without a drop in quality. A vast majority of the issues related to the speed of an arbitral procedure could be solved by better preparation. Not only should the party's prepare properly for a dispute on their own, they should also try to communicate and cooperate with each other. The preparatory stage, starting with the drafting of <b>the</b> <b>arbitration</b> clause, is as important for the arbitral tribunal and the arbitrators should be very aware of what they are getting in to, before <b>the</b> <b>commencing</b> of <b>the</b> <b>arbitration.</b> <b>The</b> better this clause reflects the actual thoughts and needs of the parties, the more likely it is that <b>the</b> <b>arbitration</b> is <b>commenced</b> in time. Unfortunately, the drafting of <b>the</b> <b>arbitration</b> clause is usually part of the negotiations of the main agreement and thus, not given the attention and time it would need. Too many disputes are drawn out because of ambiguous and unclear <b>arbitration</b> clauses. When <b>the</b> procedure is under way the importance of cooperation between parties and the tribunal is also highlighted. In order to use arbitration to its full potential, all the involved actors should work towards a common goal. <b>The</b> <b>arbitration</b> institutes and <b>the</b> legislator also have a saying in controlling the speed of arbitral proceedings. In this thesis I have come to the conclusion that the law should approach arbitration from a "less is more" perspective, and that the default rule should always be the simpler option. Hence, I suggest that disputes should be settled by a sole arbitrator as a default rule. Parties, who think that their disputes are likely to be to complex for one arbitrator to handle could easily choose to have a panel of three arbitrators instead. Now it is the other way around and most cases could in fact be solved by a sole arbitrator. A change of this rule would surely facilitate the procedure without giving in on its quality. Better cooperation between <b>the</b> <b>arbitration</b> institutions would ensure both speedier and more qualitative procedures. At the moment there is no international coherency and the term "expedited arbitration" has a very different meaning depending on the institute. The expedited rules of one institution offer time limits can for example be the same as the ones offered by another institution in their normal procedure. There are a lot of issues that could be improved in international arbitration. I still think that we should be wary and watch out not to get caught in the fast lane. There is more to <b>arbitration</b> than <b>the</b> speed of it, and the main focus should always be on its quality. That means both the quality of the procedure and that of the award. Sometimes it is good to take a step back and just reflect on things. Speed can, and often does, have a value in itself but without a qualitative award it means preciously little...|$|R
