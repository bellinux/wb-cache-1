40|$|The {{steel sheet}} {{distributor}} studied {{is located in}} Great São Paulo (Brazil) {{and has been in}} operation since 1995. The company trades steel directly purchased from steel plant and resells it to other companies. Up to the beginning of 2003, the company traded only steel sheet. However, after political and economic changes in domestic and international markets, the steel plant chose to export almost all its production. Thus, {{in order to maintain the}} domestic market, the steel plant and the distributor have established an agreement: the distributor returns to the steel plant two tons of scrap for each ton of sheet purchased. On the other side, the distributor made a partnership with its clients to assure a scrap stock. Thus, it was established that for each ton of steel sheet supplied four tons of scrap should be returned to the distributor. Thus, the distributor deals with two types of customers: without scrap exchange and with scrap exchange. With the agreement established, the company had to implement an infrastructure for supply the customers who exchange scraps. In the period of four months, the company invested on producing <b>containers,</b> <b>hiring</b> specialized labor force and purchasing trucks for containers transportation. Once the implementation phase ended, the company started to operate with both costumers. In this paper, the energy diagram for the distributor operation and emergy tables (implementation, maintenance and operation) are presented. The data obtained permit to evaluate and compare the emergy benefits of the new system since its implementation. 1...|$|R
30|$|The ocean {{shipping}} alliances {{have had}} an effect on tightly integrated sailing schedules. Given that container liner shipping has to plan schedules months in advance, high demands are placed on smoothly running port procedures and ships. Any deviation from a schedule plan can cause problems- particularly now that shippers have integrated container transportation chains in their planning procedures and logistics processes. For shipping services to run smoothly it makes sense to run a uniform, homogenous fleet of container ships, with similar container stowage capacity, speed and reliability. The existence of large vessel sharing agreements adds an additional level of complexity; freight rates are offered by each operator on an individual basis for the carriage of cargo booked by them. Partners in alliances with vessel sharing agreements have competitive positions where each of them carries out its own marketing, issues its own bills of lading, performs the carriage in its own or <b>hired</b> <b>containers,</b> and handles its own customer cargo as well as customer or liability claims (Karmelic, 2010). These operational issues become important when procedures must be put into place to handle negotiations with land transport operators where synergies are attempted based on volumes achieved by partners. An increase in ship or port size does not result in profitability unless the asset’s full capacity is utilized at a feasible tariff or freight rate for interconnectivity.|$|R
