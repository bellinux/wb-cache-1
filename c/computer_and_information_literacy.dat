40|$|Abstract Background Previous {{studies have}} shown that there is a complex {{relationship}} between students’ <b>computer</b> <b>and</b> <b>information</b> <b>literacy</b> (CIL) and their use of information and communication technologies (ICT) for both recreational and school use. Methods This study seeks to dig deeper into these complex relations by identifying different patterns of students’ school-related and recreational computer use in the 21 countries participating in the International <b>Computer</b> <b>and</b> <b>Information</b> <b>Literacy</b> Study (ICILS 2013). Results Latent class analysis (LCA) of the student questionnaire and performance data from the ICILS 2013 study, revealed different patterns of use of ICT; these patterns could be related to differences in students’ CIL scores. These analyses support the conclusions of previous studies, which found, in many cases, a ‘hill shape’ in the data, suggesting that both low and extended use of computers may be correlated with lower scores on the CIL scale, while intermediate use is correlated with higher scores. Conclusions The study identifies interesting differences between countries, and, in addition to the hill shape, both a ‘plateau shape’ and a ‘hill-valley shape’ were apparent in the data, raising important questions about differences in contexts...|$|E

This study used the ICILS data to explore whether the achievement test used in this study addressed specific dimensions of CIL and, if so, whether the performances of girls and boys on these subscales differ. We investigated the hypothesis that gender differences in performance on computer literacy items would be slightly in favour of boys, whereas gender differences in performance on information literacy items would be slightly in favour of girls. Furthermore, it was examined whether such differences varied across European countries and if item bias was present. Data was analysed using a confirmative factor analysis model, i. e. a multidimensional item response theory model, for the identification of the subscales, the explorations of gender and national differences, and possible item bias. To a large extent the results support our postulated hypothesis and shed new light on the commonly assumed disadvantaged position of girls and women in modern information society...|$|E
40|$|Search {{engines are}} {{currently}} {{the most popular}} method of information retrieval on the World Wide Web. However, researchers have not thoroughly examined search engines as they are used and judged by novice end-users. Calumet College of St. Joseph (CCSJ) required an investigation of search engine results to reveal how Web search engines supported the information seeking of CCSJ students. This study determined the effectiveness of information gathering through six popular search engines: Excite, Google, Lycos, MSN, Northern Light, and Yahoo!. It included {{an investigation of the}} relevance of search engine results as established by end-user relevance judgments made by novice information seekers, CCSJ students. Students in seven CCSJ English classes participated in this study. A questionnaire gathered demographic data <b>and</b> <b>information</b> about students 2 ̆ 7 computer use, <b>information</b> retrieval experience, <b>and</b> experience with the World Wide Web. Students searched six search engines with search topics and queries of their choice and ranked the first results according to their own relevance judgments (1 was most relevant and 10 was least relevant). The Pearson Product Moment Correlation Coefficient determined what correlation existed between the relevance rankings of the search engines and the rankings of the students. Results showed a low correlation, though a test of significance determined that this correlation is not statistically significant. Therefore, currently popular search engines are not effective in retrieving results for information-seeking CCSJ students though they may be successful some of the time. No search engine outperformed the others in this experiment, though it is also evident that no search engine consistently performed badly enough to indicate that it was the poorest performer. Furthermore, the frequency with which students used the Web, online databases/indexes, and search engines was highly correlated with search success. Two issues surfaced {{during the course of this}} study: some students 2 ̆ 7 lack of <b>computer</b> skills, <b>and</b> some students 2 ̆ 7 inability to construct appropriate search statements.

40|$|Digital {{information}} can bridge age-old gaps in {{access to information}} in traditionally underserved areas of the world. However, for those unfamiliar with abundant e-resources, their early exposure to the digital world can be like “drinking from a fire hose. ” For these audiences, abundant metadata and findability, along with easy-to-use interfaces, are key to their early success and adoption. To hasten the creation of metadata and user interfaces, the authors are experimenting with “crowd cataloging. ” This report documents their experimental and intended work and Maron’s Lo-Fi to Hi-Fi metadata pyramid model guiding a developing metadata initiative being pursued with the eGranary Digital Library, the technology used by Widernet in a global effort to ameliorate information poverty. The work in development, the Lo-Fi to Hi-Fi model, has principles adapted from technical design processes and tried and true methods within metadata creation such as crowdsourcing. It attempts to reconceptualize the metadata modeling paradigm and aligns with research that has shown that community-based librarians are better poised to identify culturally congruent resources, but many require significant training in metadata concepts and skills. The model has amateurs (mostly students) crowdsource “lo-fi ” terms, which domain experts <b>and</b> <b>information</b> professionals can curate and cull in “hi-fi ” to enhance findability of resources within the eGranary while simultaneously honing their own <b>computer,</b> <b>information</b> <b>and</b> metadata <b>literacies.</b> Though the focus here is on Africa, the findings and practices can be universalized to off-line collections around the globe...|$|R

ICILS is the first crossnational study commissioned by the International Association for the Evaluation of Educational Achievement (IEA) to collect student achievement data on computer. ICILS used purpose-designed software for the computer-based student assessment and questionnaire. These instruments were administered primarily by way of USB drives attached to school computers. Although the software could have been delivered via internet, the USB delivery ensured a uniform assessment environment for students regardless of the quality of internet connections in participating schools. Data were either uploaded to a server or delivered to the ICILS research center in that country. ICILS systematically investigated differences among the participating countries in CIL outcomes and how participating countries were providing CIL-related education. The ICILS team also explored differences within and across countries with respect to relationships between CIL education outcomes and student characteristics and school contexts. ICILS was based around four research questions focused on the following: 1. Variations in CIL within and across countries; 2. Aspects of schools, education systems, and teaching associated with student achievement in CIL; 3. The extent to which students’ access to, familiarity with, and self-reported proficiency in using computers is associated with student achievement in CIL; and 4.
