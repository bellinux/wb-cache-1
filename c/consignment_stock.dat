40|$|This paper elaborates on {{why and how}} {{business}} relationships develop {{through an}} indepth study of a world-leading industrial tooling company (ITC). The study of the ITC focuses {{on the development of}} a “preferred supplier ” concept, developed in the UK subsidiary since the mid- 1990 ’s. The aim was to capture business volume at customers through greatly increased embeddedness from a legal, technical and social point of view. In brief, the ITC offers greater productivity at the customer plant through productivity analysis using its network knowledge of cutting, milling and drilling operations and the tools involved. This has been codified in a software package. The ICT also offers automated, real-time <b>stock</b> control and <b>consignment</b> <b>stocks.</b> The case study highlights some important implications of business relationships. It shows that strong ties can be built relatively fast if a working methodology exists and if buyers are willing to give suppliers a greater role. The main driver for the relationship in general, commitment, investments and trust, is the explicit methodology and documentation of achievements in terms of productivity gains and cost savings. It is the network knowledge of the ITC that is exchanged, not the tools themselves but rather the optimization of the activities that they perform. For the ITC, what was previously a fragmented but stable market is becoming a winner-takes-all market, at the customer level. This indicates that increased levels of supplier-customer embeddedness can lead to fierce competition among suppliers...|$|R

This study tested the efficacy of a fish stocking audit procedure in preventing {{the introduction of a}} model hitch-hiking fish (Pseudorasbora parva) within a batch of model native fish (Rutilus rutilus). It was tested in relation to different P. parva contamination levels (1, 5, 10, 20 %), auditor expertise (Expert, Intermediate, Novice) and search effort. There was considerable variability in the detection thresholds among contamination levels, auditor experience and search effort; false-negative recordings reduced as all these parameters increased. Probability of P. parva detection (POD, 0 to 1) showed that at the lowest search effort, POD was greater than 0. 80 for Expert auditors only when contamination levels exceeded 10 %. At the highest search effort, POD was greater than 0. 80 at the 1 % contamination level for Experts, but was at 3 and 8 % contamination for Intermediates and Novices. Thus, while small non-native fishes are at risk of being accidentally introduced owing to their difficulty of detection in <b>stocking</b> <b>consignments,</b> an effective audit procedure using experienced auditors and high search effort reduces this risk.

40|$|Abstract The {{pursuit of}} better {{coordination}} schemes {{is crucial for}} contemporary supply chains {{to survive in a}} highly competitive environment. A supply chain may employ revenue sharing, information sharing and quantity discounts etc. to gain that viable edge.

This paper brings the present literature in with <b>consignment</b> <b>stock</b> closer to real life by introducing the notion of screening defective items. A single-vendor single-buyer supply chain is considered where the vendor ships every production batch in a number of lots to the buyer's warehouse. The buyer withdraws and screens these products while fulfilling the market demand. An analytical model is developed to depict this scenario. The impact of different fractions of defective items, storage costs as well as disposal schemes is also studied. The results indicate that the prominence of the proposed storage scheme over the conventional one remains proportional to the size and number of shipments in a cycle. Besides, the non-financial component of storage costs has a critical impact on the cost of the supply chain...|$|E

40|$|This {{contribution}} {{presents a}} production-inventory {{model for a}} supply chain that incorporates three distinct entities a Vendor, a third-party external Manufacturer and a Buyer. The Vendor purchases raw materials from a supplier and performs preliminary manufacturing operations, the semi-finished goods are sent to a third-party Manufacturer for additional manufacturing operations then the products are {{sent back to the}} Vendor for final operations or assembly with other components and finally they can be sold to the customer. The study of this particular Supply Chain configuration has been inspired by an industrial case observed in the aeronautical sector. The aim of this work is to analyse the performance of different supply chain configurations with third-party processing for operations carried out by the Manufacturer. The first option is to consider a traditional production-inventory system where the Vendor and the Manufacturer follow a centralised traditional agreement policy. The second option involves a centralised Vendor Managed Inventory policy with <b>consignment</b> <b>stock</b> agreement between the Vendor and the Manufacturer. The objective is to determine the optimal lot size policy, i. e. traditional agreement or <b>consignment</b> <b>stock</b> agreement, in order to minimize supply chain total cost.

Previous approaches for the short-term planning task of model sequencing either aim at minimizing work overload (mixed-model sequencing and car sequencing) or leveling part usages (level scheduling). However, at many manufacturers parts are consolidated by a third party logistics provider, who stocks Just-in-Time delivered parts in a consignment warehouse adjacent to the line. The manufacturer issues a complete cargo carrier (e. g. a euro-pallet) whenever his own intermediate storage of parts is depleted. Thus, the manufacturer aims at a model sequence which minimizes his own inventory costs.

30|$|Hoque [15] {{proposed}} {{three models}} for supplying a single-item from a single-vendor to multiple customers under deterministic demand by synchronizing the production flow with equal-sized batch transfer {{in the first}} two and unequal-sized batches transfer in the third. In the first two models, all batches forwarded are of exactly the same size but the timing of their shipment is different. In the first of these, the manufacturer transfers a batch to a customer as soon as its processing is finished, whereas in the second a batch is transferred to a customer as soon as the previously sent batch to the customer is finished. In the third model, the subsequent shipment lot sizes increase by the ratio of production rate and sum of demand rates on all the customers. Zavanella and Zanoni [34] proposed a model for a single-vendor multi-customer system, integrated in a shared management of the customers’ inventory, so as to pursue a reduction or the stability of the holding costs while descending the chain. Hoque [16] transferred the lot from a vendor to multiple customers with l number of unequal-sized batches first; where the next one is a multiple of the previous one by the ratio (k> 1) of the production and the total demand rates, followed by (n-l) number of equal-sized batches. The equal-sized batches are restricted to be {{less than or equal to}} the lth batch (the largest unequal-sized batch) multiplied by k. The models developed were solved by applying Lagrangian Multiplier method. However, in cases of single-vendor single-customer or single-vendor multi-customer or multi-stage production, synchronization of the production flow by transferring the lot with equal and/or unequal-sized batches was found to lead to the least total cost for some numerical problems. Although Hoque [16] served that purpose, he did not cope with the relaxation of the discussed impractical assumptions. Following this trend of synchronization, Hoque [17] developed two generalized single-vendor multi-customer integrated inventory models by accumulating the inventory at the vendor’s and customer’s independently, but with the traditional trend of ignoring the cost of benefit sharing. Transportation of each of the batches incurs a transportation cost. In order to implement the models by taking into account the industry reality, he also incorporates them with the relaxation of the discussed impractical assumptions. Battini [5] developed a single-vendor and multi-customer <b>consignment</b> <b>stock</b> inventory model in which many clients can establish a <b>consignment</b> <b>stock</b> inventory policy with the same vendor.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Kongsberg Automotive (KA), a first- and second-tier {{supplier}} {{to some of}} {{the largest}} automotive manufactures, has acknowledged the need to enhance their competitiveness and to collaborate within the supply chain. In order to do this, KA must improve the current business processes by establishing long term relationships with their suppliers. Today, KA face a high level of inventory, which has resulted substantial amount of tied up capital and inefficient processes. Therefore, this study will evaluate KA’s and three chosen suppliers’ possibilities and the effects that a vendor managed inventory (VMI) partnership will imply. VMI is a concept within supply chain management, where the supplier is fully responsible for managing the customer’s inventory level. To achieve this, the supplier is given access to sensitive information of the customer’s inventory level and demand and can, thereby, replenish the customer’s stock when needed. Although, some firms have embraced the concept with success, others have retreated forcefully. To fulfil the purpose of this study, we have done a broad literature review regarding VMI and performance measurements, as well as, organisational structures and information sharing in collaborative partnerships. Further, to better understand the implementation and effects of VMI, a benchmarking study was made at Volvo Powertrain in Skövde, an early VMI pioneer. In addition to the thorough study of KA’s processes, field visits were made at the suppliers’ to visualize their material and information flow in order to examine in what areas VMI would have an impact. The conclusion {{of this study is that}} a VMI strategy, in supplement with a <b>consignment</b> <b>stock</b> policy, is possible for KA. However, issues concerning responsibilities and ownership have become apparent throughout the study that needs to be agreed upon. Further, the study indicates that the benefits from a VMI implementation will be greater for KA, than for the suppliers. Specifically, a reduction in inventory value can be attained by KA, while the suppliers only can obtain minor improvements within the areas of inventory, production, and order processing. On the other hand, the suppliers will face drawbacks, mainly in their order processing, which will result in increased costs. However, we advice KA to further discuss and test the VMI and <b>consignment</b> <b>stock</b> strategy in a pilot project in order to find the right solution for the company and the suppliers...|$|E

The {{focus is on}} <b>consignment</b> <b>stock</b> (CS), an {{innovative}} collaborative relationship, which can create a win–win situation between the vendor and the buyer. Recently some analytical formulations have been proposed to optimise CS, and the present paper extends these models by considering a new critical factor: a fixed batch production process at the vendor's plant. This kind of production is typical if there are batch processing machines that can hold and simultaneously process {{a finite number of}} items, such as kilns for long heat treatment. Specifically, we consider a deterministic single-vendor single-buyer system. The buyer consumes a single product at a constant rate and is replenished by the vendor who produces in batches and incurs set-up costs. Each batch is dispatched to the buyer in a number of shipments, some of which may take place while production is still running. To minimise total operating costs (that is, manufacturing, replenishment and holding), two alternative production and shipment policies are proposed and analytically formulated as integer optimisation models. A step by step heuristic procedure to obtain the optimal solution is finally presented and demonstrated through numerical examples...|$|E
