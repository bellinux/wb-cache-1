50|$|A {{sediment}} trap is {{a temporary}} device installed on a construction site to capture eroded or disturbed soil that is washed off during rain storms, and protect the water quality of a nearby stream, river, lake, or bay. The trap is basically an embankment built along a waterway or low-lying area on the site. They are typically installed at the perimeter of a site and above storm drain inlets, to keep sediment from entering the drainage system.

Controlling sediment {{movement from}} road systems is a key objective to achieve the goat of reducing the impact of forest management activities. Sediment control systems minimizing sediment travel distances downslope are likely essential to reducing the environmental impact of road systems. The USDA Forest Service Southern Research Sta?ion initiated a study in an attempt to evaluate alternative means of filtering sediment laden road runoff before it reaches the forest floor on the Tuskegee National Forest in Alabama. The effectiveness of four alternative road sediment control treatments: vegetation, riprap, sediment fences, and settling basins (detention ponds), in reducing sediment export to the forest floor were evaluated over a 42 month period. The <b>sediment</b> <b>basin,</b> <b>sediment</b> fence, and vegetation treatments were similar in eff icacyto reduce runoff concentrations with 89, 85, and 66 percent reductions. Riprap was significantly less effective than the <b>sediment</b> <b>basin</b> and <b>sediment</b> fence in reducing concentrations over the study period. The findings suggest that the <b>sediment</b> <b>basin</b> and <b>sediment</b> fence treatments, with concentration reductions greater than 80 percent, may have some applicability as primary sediment control structures on forest road turn-outs.

40|$|ABSTRACT. The {{effectiveness}} of four road turn–out ditch treatments (vegetation, rip–rap, sediment fences, and settling <b>basins)</b> in reducing <b>sediment</b> export {{to the forest}} floor was evaluated. These four runoff control methods are commonly prescribed to control forest road runoff and sediments.

Settling <b>basin,</b> <b>sediment</b> fence, and vegetation treatments had {{no significant differences in}} runoff concentration reductions, which averaged more than 40 %. The rip–rap was significantly less effective at reducing runoff concentration than were either the vegetation or sediment fence.

40|$|Stormwater best {{management}} practice {{is aimed at}} reducing potential downstream impacts on aquatic ecosystem health. <b>Sediment</b> <b>basins,</b> wetlands and ponds are commonly used in subtropical Australia for water-quality improvement; they also {{have the potential to}} enhance aquatic biodiversity in urbanised catchments. Two retrofit field sites in Brisbane, Australia were monitored for water quality and ecosystem health. The Golden Pond "wetland system" treatment train consisted of a <b>sediment</b> <b>basin</b> and two wetlands. The Bridgewater Creek "pond system", consisted of a <b>sediment</b> <b>basin</b> and five ponds. Suspended solids were reduced during wet weather, but increased during dry weather due to resuspension by ducks. NO 3 -N decreased in both wet and dry weather. NH 4 -N increased probably due to ammonification of organic matter. PO 4 -P decreased. The removal of soluble NO 3 and PO 4 is indicative of biological uptake by phytoplankton submerged pond weeds and periphyton attached to aquatic macrophytes. Macroinvertebrate species richness increased, and mosquitoes were not a problem due to predation of larvae by macroinvertebrates. Macrophyte survival was adversely affected by flash flooding and increased inundation. Although water quality objectives were not consistently achieved, both systems were effective in reducing suspended solids and nutrients from stormwater runoff and provided a habitat for aquatic organisms.

40|$|A {{field-scale}} {{data collection}} plan {{to monitor and}} evaluate {{the performance of a}} <b>sediment</b> <b>basin</b> design was developed and implemented using portable automatic stormwater samplers, flow modules, a rain gauge, and inflow weirs. The design configuration consisted of a skimmer as the primary dewatering device, three coir baffles installed inside the basin, polyacrylamide flocculant blocks and ditch checks in the inflow channel. A <b>sediment</b> <b>basin</b> built on a highway construction site in Franklin County, Alabama, U. S. using the aforementioned design configuration was monitored over 16 rainfall events from 15 November 2011 to 6 February 2012. The <b>basin</b> effectively removed <b>sediments</b> during the early stages of construction when the correct type of polyacrylamide flocculant blocks was used, e. g., 97. 9 % of sediment removal after a rainfall event on 16 November 2011. It is difficult and challenging to dose sediment-laden stormwater inflow with an exact amount of flocculating agent across all runoff producing events since rainfall is a stochastic variable. Based upon results from this study, it is recommended that a minimum volume of 251. 9 m 3 /ha of contributing drainage area be used to sufficiently size a basin, which is still significantly under-designed for a 2 -year, 24 -h storm event in the southeast.

40|$|The {{conventional}} best {{management practice}} of sedi-ment basins may create a reservoir for pathogenic bacteria. The fine particles that enter these basins {{have been shown}} to provide protection for bacteria; the small pores of clays and silts minimize predators and block sunlight. Therefore, while these <b>basins</b> de-crease <b>sediment</b> loadings to water bodies downstream, they may introduce harmful levels of pathogenic bac-teria into surface waters. In addition to causing hu-man health risks, high bacteria levels alter natural biological makeup of downstream ecosystems. This paper describes the attachment of Escherichia coli to various particle sizes in construction site <b>sediment</b> <b>basins.</b> Five <b>sediment</b> <b>basins,</b> located in Anderson, South Carolina were sampled after rain events to ex-plore trends that exist between various particle sizes and E. coli densities. Results provide evidence to sug-gest that <b>sediment</b> <b>basins</b> are a reservoir for pa-thogenic bacteria. Data showed that most E. coli attached to smaller particles with diameters less than 0. 004 mm. These particles do not settle out of the water column quickly and are often passed through the basin during intense storms. Consequently, high levels of bacteria are passed to downstream waters. This research provides considerable evidence that the clays and silts within man-made construction basins can cause detrimental effects to South Carolina sur-face waters. With this knowledge, better stormwater management practices may be developed with the goal of remediating impaired surface waters of Sout...|$|R

40|$|To protect {{receiving}} waters from stormwater pollution, stormwater managers {{need to be}} able {{to predict}} the performance of proposed stormwater treatment measures, under variable operating conditions. This paper describes the development of a model, capable of predicting the performance of stormwater wetlands, ponds, vegetated swales, <b>sediment</b> <b>basins</b> and biofilters, with a single algorithm. The model describes two principal processes: (a) water quality behaviour and (b) hydrodynamic behaviour. Water quality is described by a first-order kinetic decay model (named the "k-C*" model, after its two parameters, the decay rate, k, and equilibrium concentration, C*). However, since pollutant removal depends on flow behaviour, the continuously stirred tank reactor (CSTR) concept is used to account for the hydrodynamics within a treatment device. Where the device has a high degree of turbulence or short-circuiting (such as in a <b>sediment</b> <b>basin),</b> the k-C* model is applied through a small number of CSTRs in series, whereas a well-designed wetland with even flow distribution is modelled by a high number of CSTRs.
