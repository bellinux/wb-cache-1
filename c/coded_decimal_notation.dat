The activity approach, content, and format of the materials are described. The teacher's instructional materials, including a manual, are briefly summarized.

30|$|A CDAT {{table is}} {{typically}} used for coding {{two or three}} dialogs depending {{on the length of}} the dialogs. In a classroom, a dialog between a teacher and his/her students typically starts with a question (e.g., q 1 in the example dialog no. 1) and ends with the teacher’s evaluative or corrective feedback with the answer disclosed (e.g., f 1.1), and then, another dialog begins with a new question (e.g., q 2). In this CDAT coding, individual dialogs are differentiated by numbers and the utterances in a dialog is <b>coded</b> with a <b>decimal</b> <b>notation,</b> i.e., 1.1, 1.2, or 1.3, until the dialog ends with a teacher feedback. As shown in example dialog no. 1, a new dialog is determined by a new question that requires a different answer than that in the previous dialog (i.e., q 1, What does that show? and q 2, What happened here?). Then, follow-up questions are often asked to confirm or help students understand or prompt other students’ responses (q 1.2 and q 2.2).|$|R

40|$|Deposited with {{permission}} of the author. © 2004 Dr. Vicki SteinleThis thesis reports on a longitudinal study of students’ understanding of <b>decimal</b> <b>notation.</b> Over 3000 students, from a volunteer sample of 12 schools in Victoria, Australia, completed nearly 10000 tests over a 4 -year period. The number of tests completed by individual students varied from 1 to 7 and the average inter-test time was 8 months.
