50|$|Jade is a {{gemstone}} {{with unique}} symbolic energy {{is known for}} its glossy surface, hardness and translucency. The term jade is commonly used to cover the nephrite, jadeite and <b>chloromelanite</b> groups of minerals, all of which are hard and attractively coloured. Bowenite is called False Jade or Jade look alike and is softer than true jade.|$|E
5000|$|Greenstone is {{a common}} generic term for valuable, green-hued {{minerals}} and metamorphosed igneous rocks and stones which early cultures used in the fashioning of hardstone carvings such as jewelry, statuettes, ritual tools, and various other artefacts. Greenstone artefacts may be made of greenschist, chlorastrolite, serpentine, omphacite, chrysoprase, olivine, nephrite, <b>chloromelanite</b> among other green-hued minerals. [...] The term also includes jade and jadeite, although these are perhaps more frequently identified by these latter terms. The greenish hue of these rocks generally derives from the presence of minerals such as chlorite, hornblende, or epidote.|$|E
5000|$|Jadeite's color {{commonly}} {{ranges from}} white through pale apple green to deep jade green {{but can also}} be blue-green (like the recently rediscovered [...] "Olmec Blue" [...] jade), pink, lavender and a multitude of other rare colors. <b>Chloromelanite</b> is a very dark green to black variety. Color is largely affected {{by the presence of}} trace elements such as chromium and iron. Its translucence varies from opaque to almost clear. Variations in color and translucence are often found even within a single specimen. Jadeite is reported from California, US; Myanmar; New Zealand; Guatemala; Itoigawa, Japan; other localities of jadeite include Kazakhstan; Russia; British Columbia, Canada; Italy and Turkestan.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{compositions}} of sodic pyroxenes from blueschist metabasites in Northwest Turkey were in-vestigated by electronprobe microanalysis. These {{are compared}} with sodic pyroxenes from high-grade blueschist terrains and eclogites with special {{reference to the}} island of Syros in Greece. Pyroxenes from lawsonite zone metabasites in Northwest Turkey are <b>chloromelanites,</b> aegerine augites and aegerine jadeites with the acmite contents ranging from 65 % down to 30 %. Epidote-garnet bearing high-grade blueschist metabasites of Syros {{on the other hand}} contain omphacite with the acmite content less than 30 %. All the analyzed sodic pyroxenes from eclogites and high-grade blueschists in the literature are also omphacites with low acmite contents. It is argued that the acmite content of the sodic pyroxene de-creases with rising temperature of metamorphism. This is almost entirely related to the appearance of epidote as an additional ferric ion bearing phase with an increase in temperature...|$|R
40|$|The St. Marcel {{manganese}} deposit, Val d'Aosta, Italy, {{lies within}} the ophiolite {{sequence of the}} Zermatt-Saas unit of the Piemonte nappe, and formed as a hydrothermal sediment at an oceanic spreading center. Eoalpine metamorphism to eclogite facies was followed by retrogression to lawsonite-glaucophane facies and Lepontine greenschist facies assem-blages. The Mn-rich rocks contain {{a wide variety of}} clinopyroxenes in the Di-Jd-Ac plane. Massive pyroxene-rich rocks (-+a 16 i 1 e aquartz) contain aegirine-jadeite and impure jadeite, zoned via <b>chloromelanite</b> to omphacite. Violet pyroxenes ("violan") in veins and in massive braunite ore are diopside, omphacite or <b>chloromelanite.</b> Di-Ac pyroxenes are breakdown products of omphacite/chloromelanite, or form late veins. Manganacmite substitution reaches 13 % in some violans. X-ray data on 18 samples show that C 2 lc structures extend along the Di-Ac and Dild joins to at least Ac 66; omphacites and an intermediate <b>chloromelanite</b> are of P type. Textural relations suggest that the various pyroxene compositions within each sample formed sequentially (zoning and/or replace-ment) through local changes in bulk composition, and should not be used to define solvi. The spread of all data points for 25 samples is consistent with a solvus between Jd 6 s and Jds 5 on the Di-Jd join, but this gap closes at Ac> 20 Vo...|$|E
40|$|SUMMARY. In {{an attempt}} to {{correlate}} the chemical compositions and cell sizes of omphacites and related pyroxenes, the cell dimensions of fifty-five analysed pyroxenes have been determined, or taken from the literature. Twenty-two f the chemical analyses are new, nineteen of them being done by ~electron microprobe. Approximately two-thirds {{of the total number}} of analyses may be considered first class, the remainder are of doubtful or unknown quality. Cell parameters, determined by X-ray powder diffraction methods, have errors of-i:o- 1 % for the majority of samples, although for some samples taken from the literature rrors are unknown. The majority of methods of recalculating omphacite analyses into their end-member molecules are unsuitable for correlation of cell constants with chemistry, mainly due to the impossibility ofgraphical representation f more than three end-member molecules, and to the non-stoichiometry of these molecules. Using a modification of Tr 6 ger's (1962) method of recalculating <b>chloromelanite</b> analyses the present analyses have been recalculated into the diopside-jadeite-acmite and diopside-jadeite-hedenbergite molecules and compared with their determined cell parameters. Because of the grada-tions in all parameters between these end-member molecules, determination f compositions based on the cell parameters (a, b, c, vol, or/ 3) can only be made within wide limits. However, using a metho...|$|E
40|$|Geological and {{petrographical}} investigations {{were carried}} out {{in the northern part of}} the so-called Adula Nappe, one of the deepest Pennine nappes. The area under consideration lies in the SE of Switzerland, near Vals, S of Ilanz. This area is situated north of the Lepontinic gneiss-region, the deepest part of the Alpine orogen. The rocks of the mapped area fall into four groups, viz gneisses; micaschists; amphibolites and allied rocks; and Mesozoic rocks, either of sedimentary or of igneous origin. The first three of these groups presumably represent metamorphic Hercynian or older rocks. Structurally three unites were distinguished, viz the Valserschuppen, the Fanellalappen and the Zervreilerlappen. The investigations clearly showed the important role of thrusting, isoclinal folding being of minor importance. The fissure-filling and rock-making minerals, a. o., chloritoid, <b>chloromelanite,</b> ferrian phengite, garnet, crossite, glaucophane and ferrohastingsite, are described in chapter III. They are listed on p. 451. A petrographical description of the region is to be found in chapter IV. The four different groups of rocks are treated separately, with a summary at the end of each section. The phengite-gneisses have a blastic structure pointing to a total recrystallization of the original granitoid material. Generally the feldspars do not show alteration. The large orthoclase porphyroclasts in some samples are assumed to represent relics of an older mineral assemblage. The mica-schists show the influence of several different phases of metamorphism as witnessed by, e. g., the chloritization of garnets, the replacement of chloritoid by transverse muscovite, the occurrence of several successive generations of amphibole and the occurrence of biotite fringes around the muscovites. The amphibolites and allied rocks vary in mineralogical composition. The latter comprise, a. o., sodium-pyroxene garnet rocks with occasional glaucophane and rocks rich in albite with subordinate quartz, amphibole and/or garnet. The amphibolites and allied rocks are mainly found between mica-schists and phengite-gneisses. The occurrence of zonal amphiboles and of very narrow veins filled with a different metamorphic mineral assemblage, points to a polyphasic metamorphic history. The mineral assemblage of such a narrow vein is assumed to have originated within a relatively short time and to represent a stable association of approximately contemporaneous minerals. The Mesozoic rocks mainly comprise metamorphic carbonate-bearing sediments and metamorphic ophiolites. These rocks inform us about the age of a large number of metamorphic minerals, since these minerals can only have been produced during metamorphism of Alpine age. A list of such minerals is given on p. 521. The occurrence of zonal amphiboles, the replacement of chloritoid by garnet and that of chloritoid and garnet by chlorite, point to polyphasic metamorphism. Chapter V treats the chemical composition of the various groups of rocks. If the chemical composition of the rock-making minerals is approximately known, the chemical composition of a sample can be calculated from the mode. In this way a number of chemical compositions of samples was added to those obtained by chemical analysis. A theoretical discussion of point counter analysis is given first. The results are summarized on p. 530 — 531. In order to avoid correlation between the measurements it seems advisable to choose as the distance between the points, the diameter of the largest grains that occur in appreciable quantities, or any larger distance. The theory that the grain size is irrelevant in modal analysis, is disproved. In chapter V 26 chemical analyses and 35 calculated analyses of rocks have been used to study the characteristic differences between the various groups by means of statistical methods. Differences in the chemical composition of both groups of rocks strongly suggest that the amphibolites did not derive from ophiolites. In view of their low potassium content it is highly improbable that the amphibolites represent a basic front of the phengitegneisses at their boundaries with the mica-schists. Hence it is the author’s opinion that the amphibolites, the mica-schists and the phengite-gneisses have no genetical relation whatsoever. In chapter VI the results of the mineralogical, petrographical and chemical investigations are combined in order to arrive at a synthesis. The rocks of the northern Adula region are shown to have been influenced by three successive phases of metamorphism of Alpine age. Some rocks even show traces of pre-Alpine metamorphism. The first Alpine metamorphic phase produced, a. o., glaucophane, crossite, sodium-pyroxene, garnet, epidote and chloritoid. The second phase is characterized by the production of, a. o., blue-green amphibole, ferrohastingsite, garnet, albite, epidote and biotite. The third phase produced, a. o., actinolite, chlorite, green biotite, epidote, zoisite and albite. The existence of these three Alpine phases was proved by making use of the following phenomena: (a) the occurrence of armoured relics; (b) the difference between the mineral assemblages of the host-rock and of narrow veins originated during the metamorphism; (c) the zonal habit of amphiboles; (d) the frequency of occurrence of a number of mineral associations in a group of about 300 samples, a result of a quantitative investigation with the aid of an International Business Machines equipment. The amphibolites and allied rocks seem to be metamorphosed mafic igneous rocks of Hercynian or older age. Scanty evidence suggests that the phengite-gneisses are the products of metamorphism of Hercynian igneous rocks. The fact that the amphibolites are nearly always found between micaschists and phengite-gneisses might be explained by assuming a teetonical cause for this association. In chapter VII some general aspects of the results obtained in the Adula region are discussed, as well as the bearing of these results on the geology and petrology of the southern part of the Swiss Alps. The tentative conclusion is reached that the Alpine glaucophane was produced simultaneously with the chloritoid and stilpnomelane of E. Niggli’s different zones, whereas the blue-green amphibole may be contemporaneous with the kyanite and the coarse-flaky brown biotite of Alpine age. Consequently the typical minerals of Niggli’s zones may be of different age. The distribution pattern of glaucophane in the Penninides and their immediate surroundings shows a conspicuous gap south of the Gotthard Massif, more or less coinciding with the area of brown biotite of Alpine age. This phenomenon may be connected with the occurrence of post-Palaeozoic granitoid rocks in the regions of Bellinzona and Tessin. Maps showing the distribution of glaucophane and lawsonite in Europe and in the rest of the world are added, as well as a bibliography giving localities of these minerals...|$|E
