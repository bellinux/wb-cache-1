60|$|Then {{a little}} lead (also weighed) is rolled {{up with the}} flake of silver and the two are melted at a great heat in a small vessel called a <b>cupel,</b> made by {{compressing}} bone ashes into a cup-shape in a steel mold. The base metals oxydize and are absorbed with the lead into the pores of the <b>cupel.</b> A button or globule of perfectly pure gold and silver is left behind, and by weighing it and noting the loss, the assayer knows the proportion of base metal the brick contains. He has to separate the gold from the silver now. The button is hammered out flat and thin, put in the furnace and kept some time at a red heat; after cooling it off it is rolled up like a quill and heated in a glass vessel containing nitric acid; the acid dissolves the silver and leaves the gold pure and ready to be weighed on its own merits. Then salt water is poured into the vessel containing the dissolved silver and the silver returns to palpable form again and sinks to the bottom. Nothing now remains but to weigh it; then the proportions of the several metals contained in the brick are known, and the assayer stamps {{the value of the}} brick upon its surface.|$|E

5000|$|Small scale {{cupellation}} {{is based}} on the same principle as the one done in a cupellation hearth; the main difference lies in the amount of material to be tested or obtained. The minerals have to be crushed, roasted and smelted to concentrate the metallic components in order to separate the noble metals. By the Renaissance the use of the cupellation processes was diverse: assay of ores from the mines, testing the amount of silver in jewels or coins or for experimental purposes. [...] It was carried out in small shallow recipients known as <b>cupels.</b>|$|R
50|$|The primary {{tool for}} small scale {{cupellation}} was the <b>cupel.</b> Cupels were manufactured {{in a very}} careful way. They used to be small vessels shaped {{in the form of}} an inverted truncated cone, made out of bone ashes. According to Georg Agricola, the best material was obtained from burned antlers of deer although fish spines could work as well. Ashes have to be ground into a fine and homogeneous powder and mixed with some sticky substance to mould the cupels. Moulds were made out of brass with no bottoms so that the cupels could be taken off. A shallow depression in the centre of the <b>cupel</b> was made with a rounded pestle. <b>Cupel</b> sizes depend on the amount of material to be assayed. This same shape has been maintained until the present.|$|E
5000|$|As {{the main}} purpose of small scale {{cupellation}} was to assay and test minerals and metals, the matter to be tested has to be carefully weighed. The assays were made in the cupellation or assay furnace, which needs to have windows and bellows to ascertain that the air oxidises the lead, as well as to be sure and prepared to take away the <b>cupel</b> when the process is over. Pure lead has {{to be added to the}} matter being tested to guarantee the further separation of the impurities. After the litharge has been absorbed by the <b>cupel,</b> buttons of silver were formed and settled in the middle of the <b>cupel.</b> [...] If the alloy also contained a certain amount of gold, it settled with the silver and both had to be separated by parting.|$|E

50|$|This book {{deals with}} {{assaying}} techniques. Various designs of furnaces are detailed. Then cupellation, crucibles, scorifiers and muffles are described. The correct {{method of preparation}} of the cupels is covered in detail with beech ashes being preferred. Various other additives and formulae are described, but Agricola does not judge between them. Triangular crucibles and scorifiers are made of fatty clay with a temper of ground-up crucibles or bricks. Agricola then describes in detail which substances should be added as fluxes as well as lead for smelting or assaying. The choice is made by which colour the ore burns out which gives {{an indication of the}} metals present. The lead should be silver-free or be assayed separately. The prepared ore is wrapped in paper, placed on a scorifier and then placed under a muffle covered in burning charcoal in the furnace. The <b>cupel</b> should be heated at the same time. The scorifier is removed and the metal transferred to the <b>cupel.</b> Alternatively the ore can be smelted in a triangular crucible, and then have lead mixed with it when it is added to the <b>cupel.</b> The <b>cupel</b> is placed in the furnace and copper is separated into the lead which forms lithage in the <b>cupel</b> leaving the noble metal. Gold and silver are parted using an aqua which is probably nitric acid. Agricola describes precautions for ensuring the amount of lead is correct and also describes the amalgamation of gold with mercury. Assay techniques for base metals such as tin are described as well as techniques for alloys such as silver tin. The use of a touchstone to assay gold and silver is discussed. Finally detailed arithmetical examples show the calculations needed to give the yield from the assay.|$|E

50|$|Cupellation: {{the lead}} bullets {{are placed in}} porous {{crucibles}} (cupels) of bone ash or magnesium oxide and heated in air to about 1000 °C. This is usually carried out in a 'muffle' furnace, containing a refractory muffle (usually nitride-bonded silicon carbide) heated externally by silicon carbide heating elements. A flow of air through the muffle assists oxidation of the lead, and carries the fumes for safe collection outside the furnace unit. The lead melts and oxidises to lead oxide, which in turn melts and is drawn into the pores of the <b>cupel</b> by capillary attraction. The precious metals remain {{in the base of}} the <b>cupel</b> as a 'prill' which is sent for final analysis of precious metal content.In the bullion fire assay process, a sample from the article is wrapped in a lead foil with copper and silver. The wrapped sample, along with prepared control samples, heated at 1650 F (temperature varies with exact method) in a <b>cupel</b> made of compressed bone ash or magnesium oxide powder. Base metals oxidize and absorb into the <b>cupel.</b> The product of this cupellation (doré) is flattened and treated in nitric acid to remove silver. Precision weighing of metal content of samples and process controls (proofs) at each process stage is the basis of the extreme method precision. European assayers follow bullion traditions based in hallmarking regulations. Reputable North American bullion assayers conform closely to ASTM method E1335-04e1.

60|$|How {{completely}} the analogy holds throughout, becomes yet clearer when we recognise {{the fact that}} the sciences are arts to each other. If, as occurs in almost every case, the fact to be analysed by any science, has first to be prepared--to be disentangled from disturbing facts by the afore discovered methods of other sciences; the other sciences so used, stand in the position of arts. If, in solving a dynamical problem, a parallelogram is drawn, of which the sides and diagonal represent forces, and by putting magnitudes of extension for magnitudes of force a measurable relation is established between quantities not else to be dealt with; it may be fairly said that geometry plays towards mechanics much the same part that the fire of the founder plays towards the metal he is going to cast. If, in analysing the phenomena of the coloured rings surrounding the point of contact between two lenses, a Newton ascertains by calculation the amount of certain interposed spaces, far too minute for actual measurement; he employs the science of number for essentially the same purpose as that for which the watchmaker employs tools. If, before writing down his observation on a star, the astronomer has to separate from it all the errors resulting from atmospheric and optical laws, it is manifest that the refraction-tables, and logarithm-books, and formulæ, which he successively uses, serve him much as retorts, and filters, and <b>cupels</b> serve the assayer who wishes to separate the pure gold from all accompanying ingredients.|$|R
40|$|This thesis aims {{primarily}} at furthering {{our understanding of}} the technologies involved in the metallurgy of precious metals during the Renaissance, by combining a critical evaluation of historical texts with the analytical study of contemporary archaeological remains. In particular, this work focuses on high-temperature processes performed in the fire assay and smelting of ores, by investigating two archaeological case studies from sixteenth-century Austria: the small-scale laboratory of Oberstockstall – the most complete Renaissance laboratory ever recovered –, and the contemporary large-scale gold smelting site of the Angertal. The analytical techniques used are optical microscopy, X-ray fluorescence, and scanning electron microscopy-energy and wavelength dispersive spectrometry. In the Oberstockstall laboratory, the study of high-temperature residues produced in triangular crucibles, scorifiers and <b>cupels</b> allows a detailed examination of fire assay practice. The main technical sequence identified is a three-step fusion-scorification-cupellation process, performed on fahlores for their precious metal content, together with a wider range of experimental chymical activities, testing the properties of new materials and illustrating approaches that would prove fundamental in the development of chemistry and modern science. The analyses of metallurgical remains from the contemporary gold smelting site in the Angertal indicate that silver and gold were extracted from a variety of sulphidic minerals characteristic of the regional mineralisation, employing a very standardised technological sequence. Smelting such ores created lead bullion {{at the bottom of the}} furnace, which collected most of the noble metals, fayalitic slag on top, and matte in between. The significant gold and silver losses in matte, documented through experimental cupellation of archaeological samples, suggest the possibility of matte being re-smelted, while it demonstrates in practice the links that would have existed between small- and large-scale metallurgical processes. The archaeological and historical contextualisation of these reconstructions, and comparison with contemporary technical treatises, allow a detailed insight into early modern gold and silver extraction and highlight the potential of future work. ...|$|R
5000|$|About a {{pound weight}} of {{malleable}} iron, made from magnetic ore, is placed, minutely broken and moistened, in a crucible of refractory clay, together with finely chopped {{pieces of wood}} Cassia auriculata. It is packed without flux. The open pots are then covered with the green leaves of the Asclepias gigantea or the Convolvulus lanifolius, and the tops are coated over with wet clay, which is sun-dried to hardness. Charcoal will not do {{as a substitute for}} the green twigs. Some two dozen of these <b>cupels</b> or crucibles are disposed archways {{at the bottom of a}} furnace, whose blast is managed with bellows of bullock's hide. The fuel is composed mostly of charcoal and of sun-dried brattis or cow-chips. After two or three hours' smelting the cooled crucibles are broken up, when the regulus appears in the shape and size of half an egg. According to Tavernier, the best buttons from about Golconda were as large as a halfpenny roll, and sufficed to make two Sword-blades. These [...] "cops" [...] are converted into bars by exposure for several hours to a charcoal fire not hot enough to melt them. They are then turned over before the blast, and thus the too highly carburised steel is oxidised.According to Professor Oldham, [...] "Wootz" [...] is also worked in the Damudah Valley, at Birbhum, Dyucha, Narayanpur, Damrah, and Goanpiir. In 1852 some thirty furnaces at Dyucha reduced the ore to kachhd or pig-iron, small blooms from Catalan forges; as many more converted it to steel, prepared in furnaces of different kind. The work was done by different castes; the Muslims laboured at the rude metal, the Hindu preferred the refining work. I have read that anciently a large quantity of Wootz found its way westward via Peshawar.When last visiting (April 19, 1876) the Mahabaleshwar Hills near Bombay, I had the pleasure to meet Mr. Joyner, C.E., and with his assistance made personal inquiries into the process. The whole of the Sayhddri range (Western Ghats), and especially the great-Might-of-Shiva mountains, had for many ages supplied Persia with the best steel. Our Government, since 1866, forbade the industry, as it threatened the highlands with disforesting. The ore was worked by the Hill-tribes, of whom the principal are the Dhdnwars, Dravidians now speaking Hindustani. Only the brickwork of their many raised furnaces remained. For fuel they preferred the Jumbul-wood, and the Anjan or iron-wood. They packed the iron and fourteen pounds of charcoal in layers and, after two hours of bellows-working, the metal flowed into the forms. The Kurs' (bloom), five inches in diameter by two and a half deep, was then beaten into tiles or plates. The matrix resembled the Brazilian, a poor yellow-brown limonite striping the mud-coloured clay; and actual testing disproved the common idea that the [...] "watering" [...] of the surface is found in the metal. The Jauhar, ("jewel" [...] or ribboning) of the so-called Damascus blade was produced artificially, mostly by drawing out the steel into thin ribbons which were piled and welded by the hammer. Oral tradition in India maintains that a small piece of either white or black hematite (or old wootz) had to be included in each melt, and that a minimum of these elements must be present in the steel for the proper segregation of the micro carbides to take place.|$|R

50|$|The {{refining}} {{of methods}} during the Medieval and Post Medieval periods {{led to the}} invention of the <b>cupel</b> which resembles a small egg cup, made of ceramic or bone ash which was used to separate base metals from noble metals. This process is known as cupellation. Cupellation started long before the Post Medieval period, however the first vessels made to carry out this process started in the 16th Century (Rehren 2003: p208). Another vessel used for the same process is a scorifier which is similar to a <b>cupel</b> but slightly larger and removes the lead and leaves the noble metals behind. Cupels and scorifiers were mass-produced as after each reduction the vessels would have absorbed all of the lead and become fully saturated. These vessels were also used in the process of Metallurgical Assay where the noble metals are removed from a coin or a weight of metal to determine the amount of the noble metals within the object.|$|E
40|$|This PhD thesis {{has been}} carried out within an {{interdisciplinary}} cooperational project between the Deutsches Bergbau-Museum Bochum and the Goethe-Universität Frankfurt, which is dedicated to ancient Pb-Ag mining and metal production in the hinterland of the municipium Ulpiana in central Kosovo. Geochemical analysis (OM, XRD, EMP, MC-ICP-MS) of ores, metallurgical (by-) products and metal artefacts allowed to reconstruct the local chaîne opératoire and to decipher significant chronological differences between presumably Roman/late antique and medieval/early modern metallurgical processing. Pb isotope provenance studies documented the relevance of local metal production within the Roman Empire and confirmed the actual existence of a Metalla Dardanica district, which until now solely has been suspected on basis of epigraphy. The predominant abundance of the by-products matte (Cu, Pb, Fe and Zn sulphides) and speiss (ferrous speiss: Fe-As compounds; base metal speiss: (Cu,Ni,Fe,Ag) x(Sb,Sn,As) y) at smelting sites with a preliminary Roman/late antique dating points to treatment of complex polymetallic ore. Pb isotope analysis demonstrated that the mining district of Shashkoc-Janjevo (partially) supplied six of the ten investigated metallurgical sites. In this mineralisation, parageneses with elevated Cu, As and Sb abundances comprise significant proportions of particularly tennantite-tetrahedrite minerals, chalcopyrite, arsenopyrite and were generated during the early and main stages of ore formation. Later precipitated ore in contrast is marked by a significantly less versatile mineralogy and consists almost exclusively of galena, sphalerite and pyrite/marcasite. Besides increased Cu, As and Sb contents, ore from the main formation stage also exhibits generally higher Ag abundances, which are mainly hosted by fahlore and locally abundant secondary Cu sulphides (chalcocite, digenite and covellite) and oxidised phases (e. g. malachite, azurite). The higher precious metal grades of this ore type, whose geochemical signature (i. e. higher proportions of Cu, As and Sb) is mirrored by the abundance of the metallurgical by-products matte and speiss (almost exclusively found at potentially Roman/late antique smelting sites; see above), presumably were a pivotal factor leading to its preferential exploitation in earlier times. Matte and base metal-rich speiss contain notable amounts of Ag, which are mainly present in Cu-(Fe) sulphides and particularly antimonides ((Cu,Ni) 2 Sb, Ag 3 Sb), respectively. While the speiss compounds due to their close association with Pb bullion presumably were <b>cupelled</b> automatically, the metallurgical treatment of matte could not have been proven unambiguously, but overall certainly is highly likely. The beneficiated ore (i. e. crushed and sorted, potentially also treated by more lavish techniques such as grinding, sieving or wet-mechanical methods) possibly was partially roasted and subsequently together with fluxes and charcoal submitted to the furnaces. The working temperatures approximately ranged between 1100 and 1400 °C. Slags from all presumably Roman/late antique dated and few of their potentially medieval/early modern analogues were produced from smelting of (partially roasted) ore with charcoal and added siliceous material, thus resulting in fayalite-dominant phase assemblages or rarely observed glassy parageneses. Even though several subtypes of fayalite slags have been established on basis of the abundance of Fe-rich oxide phases (i. e. spinel ss and wüstite), late clinopyroxene and the general solidification sequence of the slags, the process conditions (i. e. temperature, fO 2, added fluxing agents) must have been widely similar; chemical variations could be explained by varying degrees of interaction of the slag melt with charcoal ash and furnace material. The other investigated metallurgical remains indicate employment of a calcareous flux, which led to formation of Ca-rich olivine-, olivine+clinopyroxene-, clinopyroxene- or melilite-type slags. These types as well as glassy slags were generated at more oxidising conditions outside the fayalite stability field (FMQ buffer equilibrium, cf. Lindsley, 1976) than their olivine-dominant analogues. Conclusions on the furnace construction could be drawn on basis of the typology of the slags, which mostly were tapped into a basin located outside the furnace, but partially (at two presumably medieval/early modern sites) also accumulated in a reservoir within the smelter. Lead artefacts excavated in Ulpiana could be isotopically related to ores from mineralisations in its vicinity and demonstrate that the resources were at least utilised for local metal production. However, also ship wreck cargo from Israel - including several lead ingots with the inscription 'MET DARD' (Raban, 1999) - and late antique lead-glazed pottery from Serbia and Romania (Walton & Tite, 2010) could be related to a possible Kosovarian/Serbian provenance of the raw material and thus indicate flourishing trade of metal from the Metalla Dardanica district within the Roman Empire.

40|$|The {{main object}} of this thesis is to {{reassess}} critically {{the nature and}} development of the earliest metallurgy of the Greek mainland in the Late Neolithic and Early Bronze Age periods (c. 4800 - c. 1900), both in its technological and socio-economic context. The aims of the research are thus to: 1) show whether or not the LN finds represent the beginnings of autonomous mainland metallurgy or whether they simply represent artefacts imported from contemporary neighbouring cultures involved in metalworking. Diffusionists regard the development of EBA metallurgy as some revolutionary break. Accumulating evidence should put the Greek mainlandindustries more into line with those from the Aegean; 2) show whether the LN industry was ancestral in some way to that of the EBA or if the development of the EBA industry was due to external influence; 3) make some chronological assessment of the initial progress of technological ability as well as the structure and organisation of metallic mineral acquisition. This will further provide data on the degrees of communication between communities and metalworking sites; and, 4) examine the socio-economic context which permitted the development of metallurgy. To achieve these aims {{it will be necessary to}} demonstrate the potential availability of copper, tin and other minerals and to show clearly through analytical techniques the range of technical skills known and mastered (especially smelting and alloying). Evidence on the relationship between metalwork, settlement, sources and the role of foreign influence will also be required. The first step was to compile a fully up-to-date catalogue of metal finds and evidence for metalworking. This was done from published material, museum collections in Greece and Britain, tracing artefacts referred to in publications but never fully described and obtaining information on artefacts from recent excavations and finds (until end 1986). This work had the effect of doubling the number of artefacts to come under study and justified taking a fresh look at the state of the industry, the range of types and techniques, and, through them, the evidence for foreign or internal relations. This was a necessary preliminary to the analytical study and the study of the contexts of the metals. No single typological study had been devoted specifically to the LN and EBA material and so one was made, devising at the same time a standard typology and comparing previous classification systems. The typological affinities of the artefacts from every sub-phase of the LN-EBA period were then studied and discussed. This study brought out the range of local types, the continuity of some types from the LN to the EBA and the evidence of foreign influence. The next task was to demonstrate that this large collection of metals could have been produced from local sources, the geological evidence for metallic minerals in Greece was reviewed and a visit was made to one of the richest mineral areas in Greece to assess the types of deposits with which we were dealing. It was demonstrated that the copper, arsenic, gold, silver and lead supplies of the mainland were more than adequate to meet the needs of the local industries in the LN and EBA. Tin was not locally availably and so an extensive review of all possible sources was carried out and two potential supply areas were designated -Yugoslavia and north west Anatolia. The analytical programme presented the chemical and lead-isotope results of over seventy mainland artefacts, attempting to interpret these results for both the technological and chronological information which they could give, formed the main part of the programme. The actual analyses were carried out, in the main, by Dr N H Gale (Oxford). To assist the interpretation of the results a review was made of the metallurgical processes used in the manufacture of copper, arsenical copper, tin bronze, lead, silver and gold. The historical background of the metal technology of the Old World was reviewed, in particular the beginnings of melting, smelting and the origins and development of alloying,in order to provide a reference with which to compare the status of the Greek mainland metallurgical industries. A brief review of the analytical techniques used then led to a full interpretation of the results themselves. The results of the lead-isotope programme demonstrated that several sources were used by both the LN and EBA metallurgies three sources were used in the LN and EBA periods - so there was some continuity of tradition. A new source was identified in the lead-isotope diagrams, though it was not geographically located. This source was used only by mainland communities and, on present evidence, it is highly likely that it is a local source. The chemical results for the mainland artefacts demonstrated that all the main techniques current in the Aegean were known and practiced on the mainland. These include smelting, alloying with arsenic tin and even lead, casting in single and double moulds, <b>cupelling</b> silver from lead and smelting lead as well as working gold. The Greek LN metal industry was not simply an offshoot of the Balkan industries and the EBA industry was in no way backward compared with the other industries of the Aegean. Over 200 chemical results mainly from the EBA Aegean were computed in order to obtain some new information regarding the status of the mainland industry and also to attempt a new approach to provenancing. All the computing work was carried out by Dr M Pollard (Oxford). First of all, the character of the mainland industry was assessed and then it was compared, using various computer techniques, with the industries of the Troad, the Cyclades and Crete. The result was that the mainland industry was basically quite distinct from the other three industries, though it did share several common techniques (or possibly sources) with other areas in the Aegean. Provenancing metals by chemical analyses has had little success in the past and so an attempt was made to utilise the vast bulk of chemical results available for the Aegean by devising a new approach to provenancing, employing the results themselves, lead isotope results (where available), computer cluster dendrograms and typological information, While the approach does not claim to be a general panacea for provenancing problems it did, when applied, offer a few insights into the problem and will become more effective when more lead-isotope data becomes available One of the advantages of the approach is that it provides a much needed check on the lead-isotope technique. A study of the temporal, spatial and socio-economic context of metals and the evidence for metalworking during the LN and EBA periods was quite revealing. The dating of artefacts showed that there were two main periods of increased metallurgical activity -the LN and the EBA II. Metalworking started in northern and southern Greece at roughly the same time, though there is more evidence for metals in northern Greece during the LN and in central and south west Greece during the EBA II and III. The relative distribution of different types of metals demonstrated that copper was always the main metal used, though lead and silver were restricted to southern Greece and gold was found mainly in northern Greece. The distribution of different types showed that weapons were most often found in central Greece, tools in northern Greece and tools and jewellery in southern Greece. Both artefacts and the evidence for metalworking tended always to be located on land routes or close to the sea. Most of the finds come from settlement sites, with grave finds being important only in central Greece. Sites with the most metals or with evidence of metalworking tended to be "special feature" sites, that is, sites with architectural evidence for social or political authority, fortifications etc. There is no direct relationship between metalworking sites,or important sites,and sources - that is they are not located close to sources, though there is every reason to believe that quite apart from their prime function as centres concerned with the needs of local agricultural communities, they also had some monopoly over metal supplies. The relationship between general settlement and sources revealed some interesting information. While there was no domination of any source, settlements in good agricultural land had the added advantage of being close to good sources which also bordered the areas of good land, so the relationship between settlement and potential sources was close. As settlement expanded in the later EBA (evidence for southern Greece), the possibility that local sources would have been discovered would increase. Important settlements, centres of high population and sites with evidence for metals and metalworking all had a rather discrete distribution in central and south west Greece (except for Levkas). Foreign influence can be traced in the general assemblage of most of the sites in this area. An attempt was made to explain this phenomena, accepting at the same time that one of the main determinants of settlement growth in the area was the availability of good agricultural land and an extension of the subsistence base to include olives and the vine. The. most viable sea routes between the communities of the mainland and the rest of the Aegean were plotted using new data on winds and seacurrents. The aim was to see if there was any relationship between the sea routes and the distribution of cultural phenomena which suggested social, political or economic advancement (such as the distribution of "special feature" sites). A direct correlation between sea routes and such phenomena was revealed and so the role of trade, exchange and external contact played an important part in stimulating socio-economic change on the mainland and this in turn contributed greatly to the development of metallurgy, though the mainland contributed as much to the "international spirit" of the Aegean at this time as it gained from it. To further demonstrate that local craft specialisation was in a healthy state, an attempt was made to show that the development of the sailing ship could have been local also. The possible ship from Pelikati suggests this. The evidence for population growth and settlement change in the LN and particularly the EBA was not taken for granted, but an attempt was made to account for the settlement distribution patterns of the periods. The emphasis of the research in this section was to see where sites would have been lost. In the process,the contribution of tectonic instability to site loss was brought out and stressed and three areas were looked at in some depth (Corinthia, West Central Euboea and Ionian Sea). The result was that the picture given by the present surveys more or less represents a true picture of settlement distribution. There are areas where settlements have become lost, but this does not change the overall picture and thus the south west Peloponnese and central Greece(Euboea, Copais and Levkas) do stand out as the major EH centres. The overal achievement of this thesis has been to demonstrate that the mainland of Greece (especially the south) was an autonomous centre within the Aegean. </p...|$|R
50|$|A new City of Birmingham was created, {{including}} {{the old city}} and the former borough of Sutton Coldfield in 1974. New arms were granted to Birmingham City Council in 1977, closely based on the old arms. Instead of the ermine fess a cross was introduced, charged with a bishop's mitre. These come from the Sutton Coldfield corporation arms and commemorate Bishop Vesey of Exeter, a native of Sutton, who was {{largely responsible for the}} growth of the town in the 16th century. A Tudor rose was added to the 1889 crest. This was the device of Sutton Coldfield from at least 1619 until 1935. As the College of Arms does not allow two bodies or persons to have identical supporters, they were swapped to opposite sides of the shield. The male figure now holds a <b>cupel,</b> a tool used in the manufacture of jewellery, an important industry in modern Birmingham.|$|E
50|$|Prinsep found a {{position}} as an assay master at the Calcutta mint and reached Calcutta along with his brother Henry Thoby on 15 September 1819. Within a year at Calcutta, he was sent by his superior, the eminent orientalist Horace Hayman Wilson, to work as assay master at the Benares mint. He stayed at Benares until the closure of that mint in 1830. He then moved back to Calcutta as deputy assay master and when Wilson resigned in 1832, he was made assay master (overruling Wilson's nominee for that position, James Atkinson) at the new silver mint designed in Greek revival style by Major W. N. Forbes. He married Harriet Sophia Aubert, elder daughter of Lieutenant-Colonel Jeremiah Aubert (grandson of Alexander Aubert) of the Bengal army and his wife Hannah, at the cathedral in Calcutta on 25 April 1835. They had a daughter Eliza in 1837 who {{was to be the}} only child to survive.His work as assay master led him to conduct many scientific studies. He worked on means for measuring high temperatures in furnaces accurately. The publication of his technique in the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London in 1828 led to his election as a Fellow of the Royal Society. He suggested the possibility of visual pyrometric measurement using a calibrated series of mica plates as well as using the thermal expansion of platinum but considered that a practical approach was to use calibrated combinations of platinum, gold and silver alloys placed in a <b>cupel</b> or crucible and observe their melting. He also described a pyrometer that measured the expansion of a small amount of air held within a gold bulb. In 1833 he called for reforms to Indian weights and measures and advocated a uniform coinage based on the new silver rupee of the East India Company. He also devised a balance so delicate as to measure three-thousandth of a grain (≈0.19 mg).|$|E
