50|$|The {{coatings}} on metals tend to {{fall into}} two categories: thermoplastic or thermoset. A thermoplastic coating does not chemically react when the substrate undergoes drying after the coating process. The drying of thermoplastic coatings is accomplished by evaporation or by applying heat to fuse the material to the metal. Metals with thermoplastic coatings are not resistant to high heat or aggressive solvents. The coating on the metal can re-melt with exposure to heat or strong solvents from the screen-printing process. A thermoset coating cures by a chemical reaction called polymerization and/or crosslinking. The coating is cured by baking the <b>coated</b> <b>metals</b> at high temperatures {{for long periods of}} time. Thermoset coatings tend to be resistant to heat and remelting, and they generally provide excellent solvent and scuff resistance.|$|E

40|$|In daily life, metals {{are used}} in {{everywhere}} {{and they are the}} main parts of technical and mechanical devices. They should be strength enough to endure the conditions in the environment such as pressure, forces, temperature and the hardest one corrosion. Metals have some processes to increase their endurance through such difficulties. One of the easiest ways to increase the metal’s endurance is coating. This method is used in almost all areas such as engineering, ships and electrical devices and even in mechanic industry for protection and endurance. One of the most important areas of metal coating is to inhibit corrosion in metal surface. Metals react with oxygen in daily life. To prevent these oxidation reactions metal coating is used. Zinc, chrome, platinium, etc. Are commonly used in coating metals due to their low oxidation potential they have. In this study, the research was chosen to be “Would endurance for corrosion of different <b>coated</b> <b>metals</b> in salt solution be different?” Zinc, chrome, iron, copper and nickel <b>coated</b> <b>metals,</b> made by same factory and by the same process, was used in the study. Salt solutions prepared and <b>coated</b> <b>metals</b> were sink into these solutions to observe the corrosion or changes. Some changes such as colour change on the metal surfaces and salt solutions were observed {{at the end of the}} experiment. All changes were noted in 5 day interval and after a 30 day period, the metals were compared with each other respect to these changes. It is realised that the best metal which has best endurance to corrosion is chrome. Because, after the 30 day period there is no evidence which shows chrome corrodes. The endurance of metals to corrosion goes from most endurance to less one as copper, nickel, iron, zinc...|$|E

40|$|An {{attempt was}} made to develop a self-dissolution {{assisted}} coating on a pure magnesium metal for potential bone fixation implants. Magnesium phosphate cement (MPC) was coated successfully on the magnesium metal in ammonium dihydrogen phosphate solution. The in vitro degradation behaviour of the MPC <b>coated</b> <b>metal</b> was evaluated using electrochemical techniques. The MPC coating increased the polarisation resistance (RP) of the metal by ~ 150 % after 2 h immersion in simulated body fluid (SBF) and reduced the corrosion current density (icorr) by ~ 80 %. The RP of the MPC <b>coated</b> <b>metal</b> remained relatively high even after 8 h immersion period. However, post-degradation analysis of the MPC <b>coated</b> <b>metal</b> revealed localized attack.
