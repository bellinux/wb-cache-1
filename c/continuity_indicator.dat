40|$|Indicator {{species are}} often used to detect forest with a long {{temporal}} continuity. However, only species restricted to such forests because of their poor dispersal capacity should be used as continuity indicators. The dispersal capacity of one species suggested as a <b>continuity</b> <b>indicator,</b> the lichen Lobaria pulmonaria has been studied recently in southern Sweden. The results of that study suggest that L. pulmonaria has very poor long-range dispersal capacity, and hence would be a suitable indicator of forest continuity. It is important {{to pay attention to}} the dispersal capacity and dispersal strategy of different species when planning for nature conservation. If the focal species are short-distance dispersers, the efforts should be concentrated at protecting and enlarging biotopes where the species is found today...|$|E

40|$|The {{adaptive}} {{finite-element method}} (FEM) is an iterative {{variant of the}} FEM where, in a first step, an initial mesh with few and low-order elements is generated, the corresponding algebraic problem is solved and the error in the solution is estimated in order to add degrees of freedom in those regions of the domain with the biggest error estimation. This process is repeated until an ending condition is reached. The two basic stages in this method are the error indication and the mesh enrichment. In this paper, within the analysis of waveguiding structures, a new error indicator based on the curl recovery is described. In addition, an overview on refinement techniques is presented, and the -refinement employed {{in this study is}} briefly described. Results obtained with the curl-recovery indicator are discussed and compared with the classical nonadaptive FEM and two previously developed error indicators: the residual and flux <b>continuity</b> <b>indicators...</b>|$|R
40|$|Recent {{accelerated}} {{dynamics of}} urbanization produce new spatial entities {{at a new}} scale. These regions feature superior economic output, productivity, workforce, innovation and markets; conceptualized as mega-regions they consist of an extended network of metropolitane centers. The predominantly visible result at regional scale is the growth and convergence of the built environment into a complex network of once separated cities. Recent developments in Earth observation allow analyzing the settlement patterns at unprecedented geometric resolution. This paper presents a method to identify conjugation lines between relevant urban nodes and to evaluate the degree of settlement <b>continuity</b> (as <b>indicator</b> for convergence of cities). For the case of China, it is shown how nodes within the suggested mega-regions (which are usually classified by economic and demographic measures) feature a distinct spatial connectivity of their settlements. Beyond mega-regions, the analysis allows to identify similar settlement continuities across China hinting at new emerging urban networks...|$|R

40|$|Importance {{of forest}} {{continuity}} and fragmentation according to beetles as an indicating taxonomic group Abstract Old-growth forests can provide suitable habitats for certain organisms which can't live in {{another type of}} environment. These organisms {{can be used as}} bioindicators of old-growth forests. Spatial organization of forests affects spatial distribution and population abundance of these organisms. Fragmentation process can negatively influence populations of forest organisms. In particular, the aim of this work was to locate areas with forest continuity within the area of interest and to characterize their spatial arrangement. Long-term continuity of forests was identified using historical maps. Spatial distribution of forests is not equal. In the northern and north-eastern part of the area, there is a large forest complex while in the southern and south-western part of the area, there is lot of forest fragments with surrounding of agriculture fields. Next target was to select beetle group with potential bioindicators of forest continuity. Many beetle species live in forests and the group fulfills requirements for indicating groups. Saproxylic beetles were chosen as a crucial group for a subsequent study. Keywords: <b>continuity,</b> fragmentation, <b>indicator,</b> landscape structure, beetle...|$|R

40|$|Disasters such as {{the recent}} {{parliament}} shooting in Ottawa, Superstorm Sandy, and the Great Japan Sea Earthquake and tsunami are reminders of the roles essential service organizations have in maintaining public health. On a daily basis, organizations are expected to operate under normal conditions, providing goods, services, and community supports. In crisis situations, {{it is critical that}} these organizations continue to operate and contribute to adaptive response and recovery in a community. Business continuity planning focuses on ensuring continued functioning of core operations during a disruption. Inherent to the business continuity field is a prevent-and-protect approach to preparedness activities. Asset-mapping exercises have the potential to balance the predominantly risk-based field by focusing on the strengths and capabilities already present within an organization. To understand the value of asset-mapping activities in business <b>continuity</b> plans (BCPs), <b>indicators</b> for organizational resilience are needed. Indicators have the potential to provide essential service organizations with a way to gauge the value of their BCP activities. In addition, this information can help guide decision-makers when developing BCPs. This research {{is part of a larger}} project at the University of Ottawa focused on building the empirical evidence base for BCPs and organizational resilience. This thesis, as a sub-study within the larger project, explores assets and indicators for organizational resilience to contribute to the effective evaluation and engagement of organizations in business continuity planning efforts. Emergent themes highlight the importance of assets and their contribution to the adaptive capacity of an organization in the event of a disaster. This study also provides an example list of 28 SMARTT organizational resilience indicators directly derived from organizational assets, providing information that researchers and essential service organizations can use to evaluate business continuity planning activities in relation to organizational resilience...|$|R
40|$|We compare multi-wavelength SFR {{indicators}} out to z 3 in GOODS-South. Our analysis uniquely combines U-to- 8 um photometry from FIREWORKS, MIPS 24 um and PACS 70, 100, and 160 um photometry {{from the}} PEP survey, and Ha spectroscopy from the SINS survey. We describe {{a set of}} conversions that lead to a <b>continuity</b> across SFR <b>indicators.</b> A luminosity-independent conversion from 24 um to total infrared luminosity yields estimates of LIR {{that are in the}} median consistent with the LIR derived from PACS photometry, albeit with significant scatter. Dust correction methods perform well at low to intermediate levels of star formation. They fail to recover the total amount of star formation in systems with large SFR_IR/SFR_UV ratios, typically occuring at the highest SFRs (SFR_UV+IR ≳ 100 Msun/yr) and redshifts (z ≳ 2. 5) probed. Finally, we confirm that Ha-based SFRs at 1. 5 <z< 2. 6 are consistent with SFR_SED and SFR_UV+IR provided extra attenuation towards HII regions is taken into account (Av,neb = Av,continuum / 0. 44). With the cross-calibrated SFR indicators in hand, we perform a consistency check on the star formation histories inferred from SED modeling. We compare the observed SFR-M relations and mass functions at a range of redshifts to equivalents that are computed by evolving lower redshift galaxies backwards in time. We find evidence for underestimated stellar ages when no stringent constraints on formation epoch are applied. We demonstrate how resolved SED modeling, or alternatively deep UV data, may help to overcome this bias. The age bias is most severe for galaxies with young stellar populations, and reduces towards older systems. Finally, our analysis suggests that SFHs typically vary on timescales that are long (at least several 100 Myr) compared to the galaxies' dynamical time.

40|$|A 9. 3 -year dataset of low-tide time-exposure {{images from}} Surfers Paradise, Northern Gold Coast, Australia {{was used to}} characterise the state {{dynamics}} of a double sandbar system. The morphology of the nearshore sandbars was described {{by means of the}} sequential bar state classification scheme of Wright and Short [1984. Morphodynamic variability of surf zones and beaches: a synthesis. Marine Geology 56, 93 – 118]. Besides the two end members (the dissipative (D) and the reflective (R) states) and the four intermediate states (longshore bar and trough (LBT), rhythmic bar and beach (RBB), transverse bar and rip (TBR) and low tide terrace (LTT)), we identified two additional intermediate bar states. The erosive transverse bar and rip (eTBR) state related to the dominant oblique angle of wave incidence at the study site and the rhythmic low tide terrace (rLTT) related to the multiple bar setting. Using the alongshore barline variability and alongshore trough <b>continuity</b> as morphological <b>indicators</b> enabled the objective classification of the inner and outer bar states from the images. The outer bar was mostly in the TBR state and generally advanced sequentially through the states LBT–RBB–TBR–eTBR–LBT, with occasional transitions to the D state. Wave events led to abrupt state transitions of the outer bar, but, in contrast to expectations, did not necessarily correspond to upstate transitions. Instead, upstate (downstate) transitions coincided with angles of wave incidence θ larger (smaller) than 30 °. The upstate TBR–eTBR–LBT sequence during high-angle events highlights the role of alongshore currents in bar straightening. The outer bar was found to govern the state of the inner bar to a large extent. Two types of inner bar behaviour were distinguished, based on the outer bar state. For intermediate outer bar states, the alongshore variability of the dominant inner rLTT state (52 % in time) mainly related to that of the outer bar, implying some sort of morphological coupling. For dissipative outer bar states, however, the more upstate inner bar frequently separated from the shoreline and persistently developed rip channels as TBR became the most frequent state (60 % in time) ...|$|R
40|$|Deviating from a {{standard}} career path is increasingly becoming {{an option for}} individuals to combine paid labor with other important life domains. These career detours emerge in diverse labor forms such as part-time jobs, temporary working hour reductions, and labor force time-outs, used to alleviate conflicting time demands throughout careers, especially during the rush hour of working life. Policy makers in various EU countries are constructing life course facilities to accommodate households while optimizing the labor participation of all possible contributors, particularly women and older workers. Yet surprisingly little is known of their possible effects on the careers of individuals over the longer-term. This thesis focuses directly on this information deficit and aims at answering the vital question: How do deviations from {{a standard}} career path affect individual careers? The foundation for the theoretical framework of this thesis is human capital theory, built upon further with theories incorporating the meso-level of organizations using statistical discrimination theory and tournament models. This thesis comprises three empirical studies covering four types of career path detours: part-time work, nonparticipation (voluntary and unemployment) and institutionalized career breaks. It establishes longer-term effects of career deviations on individual careers, using a range {{of social and economic}} indicators to cover diverse career aspects such as labor participation and continuity, the level of socio-economic status and its change over time, the function level, and wage and wage growth. The first empirical study concerns the effects of part-time work and the second study examines nonparticipation (voluntary and unemployment). Both studies use the 1990 - 2001 waves from the Dutch socio-economic panel (SEP). The third empirical study examines the Belgian career break system using three data sets: (1992 - 2002) from the Panel Study on Belgian Households (PSBH), the PSBH Career Module, and the Panel Mobility of Working Age Population (PMWP 1998 - 2002). The multivariate analyses show that part-time work is not conducive to climbing career ladders. This applies to men and women based on the negative effects observed on both socio-economic status and the function level. Part-time jobs are not compatible with higher status and function levels. The findings demonstrate further that the negative effects of labor force exits on women's wages and socio-economic status are resilient even three years after returning to work. Voluntary exits are not without serious repercussions. The Belgian career break system however, adds up to a positive balance. Men experience positive effects on wage and wage growth after temporary hour reductions (part-time breaks), which bring them back up to the wage level prior to the break before dissipating. Women experience a positive effect on their wage and wage growth after using a full-time career break and this effect persists over time. This life course labor market instrument has a positive effect on individual careers. The purpose of this thesis was to make evident the longer-term effects of career deviations on individual careers in terms of labor <b>continuity</b> and job-related <b>indicators.</b> If it is the intention to make deviating from standard careers a viable option for individuals during their working lives, the negative longer-term individual effects as observed and described in this research will first need to be addressed...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to significantly advance the fundamental understanding of the process of metal-core thermal drawing from a preform for the scalable manufacturing of metal micro/nano-particles and wires. Metal micro/nano-wires and particles, with controlled size, aspect ratio and spatial distribution, exhibit unusual mechanical, electrical, magnetic, thermal, and optical properties that are desirable for numerous applications in industry as well as for fundamental research. Thermal fibre drawing from a preform, capable of mass production of continuous and uniform glass and polymer fibers, has emerged as an advanced scalable manufacturing tool for such metal micro/nano-wires and particles. It is of tremendous scientific and technical interest to gain fundamental knowledge through theoretical and experimental studies and to explore and break the fundamental limits of the metal-core thermal drawing process. Throughout this study, material combinations of the metal Tin (Sn) core and thermoplastic Polyethersulfone (PES) cladding are used as a model system. Because the viscosity ratio between molten metal and polymer (or glass) melt is much smaller than one during normal process conditions, results obtained in this study based on Sn/PES system are expected to have useful implications for other metal/glass or metal/polymer combinations as well. Despite the fact that thermal drawing from a preform is capable of the high volume production of continuous metal microwires for numerous applications, no theoretical model can yet satisfactorily provide effective predictions of core diameter and continuity from process parameters and material properties. A long wavelength model is therefore derived aiming to fill this gap and describe the dynamics of a molten metal micro-jet entrained within an immiscible, viscous, nonlinear free-surface extensional flow. The model requires numerical data (e. g. drawing force and cladding profile) be measured in real-time. Examination of the boundary conditions reveals that the diameter control mechanism is essentially volume conservation. The flow rate of molten metal is controlled upstream while the flow velocity is controlled downstream realized by solidification of the molten metal. The dynamics of the molten metal jet is dominated by interfacial tension, stress in the cladding, and pressure in the molten metal. Taylor’s conical fluid interface solution (Taylor 1966) can be considered as a special case in this model. A dimensionless capillary number Ca= 2 Fa/(γA(0)) is suggested to be used as the indicator for the transition from continuous mode (i. e. viscous stress dominating) to dripping mode (i. e. interfacial tension dominating). Experimental results showed the existence of a critical capillary number Ca_cr, above which continuous metal microwires can be produced, providing the first-ever quantitative predictor of the core continuity during preform drawing of metal microwires. With the new understanding obtained through the fundamental studies on single-core preform drawing, experimental design and analysis on thermal drawing of micro metal wires are carried out to optimize the drawing conditions for multi-core preforms. To minimize the experimental cost and time, we made an unreplicated 23 factorial design and evaluated the effects and interactions of drawing parameters (e. g. draw-down ratio, stress at melt front, and aspect ratio) on the capillary instability and core <b>continuity.</b> Two numerical <b>indicators,</b> namely Relative Standard Deviation (RSD) and Deviation from Draw-down Ratio (DDR), were proposed as measures of the extent of growth of capillary instability and the core continuity respectively. The results indicate that all main factors considered significantly affect the RSD and DDR and the interactions between main factors are not negligible. Comparison between models fitted respectively based on RSD and DDR suggests that capillary instability may not be the only cause of core break-up, which led to the discovery of solid-state break-up. Empirical rules for optimizing parameters are derived based on the surface plots of RSD and DDR. At least at microscale domain, maximizing the stress at the melt front is believed to minimize the growth of capillary instability while maximizing the draw-down ratio tends to maximize the chance of obtaining a continuous core, given all other parameters unchanged. While previous studies focus on maintaining the continuity of the metal core during preform drawing, i. e. preventing fluid instabilities, exploratory studies were also conducted to control the wavelength of break-up by electric fields and to harness the fluid instabilities for the production of metal nanoparticles. We conducted a feasibility study on utilizing a radial electric field to control the break-up wavelength of an initially continuous microwire during preform drawing. It was hypothesized that the radial electric field significantly affects the break-up wavelength of the metal core during preform drawing. The result of an unpaired two-sample t-test confirmed the effect thus shed new light on the controlled emulsification of molten metal in a viscous dielectric medium. We then experimentally show the scalable manufacturing of metal Sn nanoparticles (< 100 nm) in Polyethersulfone (PES) fibers. The underlying mechanism for the particle formation is revealed, and a strategy for the particle diameter control is proposed. This process opens a new pathway for scalable manufacturing of metal nanoparticles from liquid state facilitated solely by hydrodynamic forces, which may find exciting photonic, electrical, or energy applications...|$|R
