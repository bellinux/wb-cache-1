The existing consensus holds that courts should exclude from class membership those foreign citizens whose country does not recognize an American class judgment. Our analysis begins by establishing that this consensus is flawed. Rather, to minimize {{the costs associated with}} relitigation in a foreign forum, we must distinguish between foreign claimants who are likely to commence a subsequent foreign proceeding from those who are unlikely to do so; distinguishing between those who come from recognizing and nonrecognizing countries creates needless inefficiency. Using standard tools of economic analysis, we examine the benefits and costs of the <b>consensus</b> <b>rule</b> and compare them to {{the costs and benefits of}} other possible rules. In this comparison, the <b>consensus</b> <b>rule</b> tends to perform poorly. As a matter of theory, the most efficient rule for deciding which foreign citizens to include and exclude is evident, but real-world informational constraints frustrate the application of this rule in practice. Because no rule regarding the inclusion and exclusion of foreign citizens is the most efficient in all situations, we propose that courts use rebuttable presumptions: include foreign citizens with claims that are not individually viable and exclude foreign citizens with claims that are viable...|$|E

The baseline and month 9 MRI studies of 16 patients with a range of MRI activity were used (dual-echo conventional spin-echo sequence, TR 2000, TE 34 and 90 ms, 5 mm contiguous slices, in-plane resolution 1 mm). First, the serial studies were visually analysed for the presence of new and enlarging lesions, on two occasions, by five experienced observers, without adopting any consensus strategy and in isolation. Next, the observers met to identify the common sources of inconsistencies in reporting between observers and formulate <b>consensus</b> <b>rules.</b> Finally, a further independent reading session was performed on the same MRI dataset, this time applying the <b>consensus</b> <b>rules.</b> Agreement between observers was assessed using kappa scores. Without the <b>consensus</b> <b>rules,</b> interobserver kappa scores for the first and second reading sessions for new lesions were only 0. 51 and 0. 39 respectively; agreement for enlarging lesions was even worse. The mean intraobserver kappa score for new lesions was higher at 0. 72, reflecting the fact that the observers were consistently applying their individual assessment strategies. Application of the <b>consensus</b> <b>rules</b> did not lead to a significant improvement in inter observer kappas; the kappa scores adopting the guidelines were 0. 46 and 0. 21 for new and enlarging lesions respectively. Consensus guidelines thus did not improve the reproducibility of visual analysis of serial T 2 -weighted MRI, and the level of agreement between observers remained only moderate. Suboptimal repositioning {{is likely to be a}} major source of residual variability and this suggests a future role for image registration strategies; until then, a single observer, or pair of observers working in consensus, should be used in MS studies...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{defines a}} {{framework}} for artificial reasoning called Subjective Logic, which consists of a belief model called opinion and set of operations for combining opinions. Subjective Logic {{is an extension of}} standard logic that uses continuous uncertainty and belief parameters instead of only discrete truth values. It can also be seen as an extension of classical probability calculus by using a second order probability rep-resentation instead of the standard first order representation. In addition to the standard logical operations, Subjective Logic contains some opera-tions specific for belief theory such as consensus and recommendation. In particular, we show that Dempster’s <b>consensus</b> <b>rule</b> is inconsistent with Bayes ’ rule and therefore is wrong, and provide an alternative rule with a solid mathematical basis. Subjective Logic is directly compatible with traditional mathematical frameworks, but is also suitable for handling ignorance and uncertainty which is required in artificial intelligence. ...|$|E

In the laboratory, we had found consistent support for the speed of making decisions under majority rules, but we subsequently failed to replicate the findings about practicality and quality with three-person groups in the laboratory. We attributed the problem to a lack of conflict experienced in the MR groups that we had attempted to generate but which did not materialize. The literature agreed with us that it was difficult to get debate in three-person groups. In an effort to increase debate among group members in the MR condition, in the present research, we used from three to seven- person groups and the Wason Selection Task.

40|$|The {{study of}} the effects of {{spatially}} uniform fields on the steady-state properties of Axelrod's model has yielded plenty of controversial results. Here we re-examine the impact of this type of field for a selection of parameters such that the field-free steady state of the model is heterogeneous or multicultural. Analyses of both one and two-dimensional versions of Axelrod's model indicate that, contrary to previous claims in the literature, the steady state remains heterogeneous regardless {{of the value of the}} field strength. Turning on the field leads to a discontinuous decrease on the number of cultural domains, which we argue is due to the instability of zero-field heterogeneous absorbing configurations. We find, however, that spatially nonuniform fields that implement a <b>consensus</b> <b>rule</b> among the neighborhood of the agents enforces homogenization. Although the overall effects of the fields are essentially the same irrespective of the dimensionality of the model, we argue that the dimensionality has a significant impact on the stability of the field-free homogeneous steady state...|$|E
40|$|Classification of {{remotely}} sensed multispectral images involves assigning a {{class to}} each pixel which has similar characteristics with known land cover. This {{is the important}} step in remote sensing to extract information about the Earth 2 ̆ 7 s surface. Statistical methods and computational intelligence algorithms such as neural networks are commonly used for classification. However, no single classifier can be good {{for all kinds of}} multispectral images. To obtain consistent and improved results, consensual and hierarchical approaches are applied. The proposed method consists of nonlinear image filtering, different multiple classifiers which use statistical methods or hierarchical neural networks with rejection schemes, and a combining scheme for integrating the results of multiple classifiers by a <b>consensus</b> <b>rule.</b> Nonlinear image filtering is used to reduce variance of homogeneous region and improve spectral separability. ^ Most errors in classification occur with the data which are close to boundaries between classes. To handle these data more effectively, hierarchical structure is applied in classification using neural networks. By successive classifiers which are tuned to reduce remaining error, classification performance increases. This structure includes detection schemes to decide whether successive classifiers are utilized for each input. Rules are developed to determine automatically how many successive classifiers are needed. To obtain more reliable classification result for a given input pattern, multiple classification results for the same input pattern are combined by a <b>consensus</b> <b>rule.</b> Optimal weights for combining multiple classification results are computed in the sense of least squares based on the trained results of single classifiers to be combined. These are used to derive a consensus of multiple classification results. ^ If the classifier is based on neural networks, a classifier with a single algorithm can generate multiple different results by preprocessing input data and varying learning parameters. Since the same learning algorithm can be trained in different ways by preprocessing of the input pattern and varying learning parameters, generated classification results are different from each other with diverse errors as in classification with multiple different types of classifiers. By combining these classification results, classification performance increases. Experimental results with the proposed methods are discussed. ...|$|E
