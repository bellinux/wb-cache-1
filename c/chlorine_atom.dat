5|$|Electronegativity is a {{chemical}} property {{that describes the}} tendency of an atom or a functional group to attract electrons (or electron density) towards itself. If the bond between sodium and chlorine in sodium chloride were covalent, the pair of shared electrons would be attracted to the chlorine because the effective nuclear charge on the outer electrons is +7 in chlorine but is only +1 in sodium. The electron pair is attracted {{so close to the}} <b>chlorine</b> <b>atom</b> that they are practically transferred to the <b>chlorine</b> <b>atom</b> (an ionic bond). However, if the sodium atom was replaced by a lithium atom, the electrons will not be attracted as close to the <b>chlorine</b> <b>atom</b> as before because the lithium atom is smaller, making the electron pair more strongly attracted to the closer effective nuclear charge from lithium. Hence, the larger alkali metal atoms (further down the group) will be less electronegative as the bonding pair is less strongly attracted towards them. As mentioned previously, francium is expected to be an exception.|$|E
5|$|With {{organic acids}} {{inductive}} effects and mesomeric effects affect the pKa values. A simple example {{is provided by}} the effect of replacing the hydrogen atoms in acetic acid by the more electronegative <b>chlorine</b> <b>atom.</b> The electron-withdrawing effect of the substituent makes ionisation easier, so successive pKa values decrease in the series 4.7, 2.8, 1.4, and 0.7 when 0, 1, 2, or 3 chlorine atoms are present. The Hammett equation, provides a general expression for the effect of substituents.|$|E
25|$|As the <b>chlorine</b> <b>atom</b> moves {{further away}} from the acidic O—H bond, its effect diminishes. When the <b>chlorine</b> <b>atom</b> is just one carbon removed from the {{carboxylic}} acid group, the acidity of the compound increases significantly compared to butanoic acid (a.k.a. butyric acid). However, when the <b>chlorine</b> <b>atom</b> is separated by several bonds, the effect is much smaller. Bromine is much more electronegative than either carbon or hydrogen, but not as electronegative as chlorine, so the pKa of 2-bromobutanoic acid is slightly greater than the pKa of 2-chlorobutanoic acid.|$|E
50|$|Uranium pentachloride is an {{inorganic}} chemical compound composed of uranium in the +5 oxidation state and five <b>chlorine</b> <b>atoms.</b> The gaseous form has C4v symmetry. There are two crystalline forms, {{each of which}} has the uranium atom in an octahedral geometry among six <b>chlorine</b> <b>atoms.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The crystal {{structure}} of the dihydrate was partially determined in 1927 by Hendricks and Dickinson and refined in 1934 by Chrobak. [...] The structure is tetragonal P42/mnm (136), Z=2, isostructural with ammonium tetrachoridocuprate(II) (...) 2.2 and rubidium tetrachoridocuprate(II) [...]2. [...] Each copper atom is immediately surrounded by two oxygen <b>atoms</b> and four <b>chlorine</b> <b>atoms</b> forming a hydrated tetrachloridocuprate(II) anion. Two of the <b>chlorine</b> <b>atoms</b> are about 0.75 angstroms further away than the other two. Each potassium atom is surrounded by four oxygen atoms, four copper <b>atoms</b> and eight <b>chlorine</b> <b>atoms.</b>|$|R

25|$|The {{hydroxyl}} group on carboxylic acids may {{be replaced with}} a <b>chlorine</b> <b>atom</b> using thionyl chloride to give acyl chlorides. In nature, carboxylic acids are converted to thioesters.|$|E
25|$|A single <b>chlorine</b> <b>atom</b> is able {{to react}} {{with an average of}} 100,000 ozone {{molecules}} before it is removed from the catalytic cycle. This fact plus the amount of chlorine released into the atmosphere yearly by chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) demonstrates the danger of CFCs and HCFCs to the environment.|$|E
50|$|Melting of sea ice {{releases}} molecular chlorine, which {{reacts with}} sunlight to produce <b>chlorine</b> <b>atoms.</b> Because <b>chlorine</b> <b>atoms</b> are highly reactive, they can expedite {{the degradation of}} methane and tropospheric ozone and the oxidation of mercury to more toxic forms. Cracks in sea ice are causing ozone and mercury uptake in the surrounding environment.|$|R
50|$|The lowest {{states are}} {{correlated}} with ground state xenon and <b>chlorine</b> <b>atoms.</b>|$|R
25|$|The {{toxicity}} of PCDDs {{depends on the}} number and positions of the <b>chlorine</b> <b>atoms.</b> Congeners that have chlorine in the 2, 3, 7, and 8 positions {{have been found to}} be significantly toxic. In fact, 7 congeners have <b>chlorine</b> <b>atoms</b> in the relevant positions which were considered toxic by the World Health Organization toxic equivalent (WHO-TEQ) scheme.|$|R
25|$|The <b>chlorine</b> <b>atom,</b> written {{often as}} Cl., behaves very {{differently}} from the chlorine molecule (Cl2). The radical Cl. is long-lived in the upper atmosphere, where it catalyzes the conversion of ozone into O2. Ozone absorbs UV-B radiation, so its depletion allows more of this high energy radiation to reach the Earth's surface. Bromine atoms are even more efficient catalysts; hence brominated CFCs are also regulated.|$|E
25|$|Cyproterone acetate is a 6-chloro-1,2-methylene {{derivative}} of 17α-acetoxyprogesterone. It shows major antiandrogenic activity together with androgenic activities. Cyproterone acetate displays high affinity for AR in rats which increases when the 1,2-methylene group {{is removed from}} the compound. If the <b>chlorine</b> <b>atom</b> is replaced by a methyl group the binding slightly decreases, whereas further removal of the C6 double bond modifies the binding kinetics, see figure 7.|$|E
25|$|In this {{reaction}} dichloromethyllithium converts the boronic ester into a boronate. A Lewis acid then induces a rearrangement of the alkyl group with {{displacement of the}} chlorine group. Finally an organometallic reagent such as a Grignard reagent displaces the second <b>chlorine</b> <b>atom</b> effectively leading to insertion of an RCH2 group into the C-B bond. Another reaction featuring a boronate alkyl migration is the Petasis reaction.|$|E
50|$|For instance, {{there are}} two main {{isotopes}} of chlorine: chlorine-35 and chlorine-37. In any given sample of chlorine that has not been subjected to mass separation there will be roughly 75% of <b>chlorine</b> <b>atoms</b> which are chlorine-35 and only 25% of <b>chlorine</b> <b>atoms</b> which are chlorine-37. This gives chlorine a relative atomic mass of 35.5 (actually 35.4527 g/mol).|$|R
50|$|The five atoms {{bonded to}} the central atom are not all equivalent, and two {{different}} types of position are defined. For phosphorus pentachloride as an example, the phosphorus atom shares a plane with three <b>chlorine</b> <b>atoms</b> at 120° angles to each other in equatorial positions, and two more <b>chlorine</b> <b>atoms</b> above and below the plane (axial or apical positions).|$|R
50|$|The {{toxicity}} of PCDDs {{depends on the}} number and positions of the <b>chlorine</b> <b>atoms.</b> Congeners that have chlorine in the 2, 3, 7, and 8 positions {{have been found to}} be significantly toxic. In fact, 7 congeners have <b>chlorine</b> <b>atoms</b> in the relevant positions which were considered toxic by the World Health Organization toxic equivalent (WHO-TEQ) scheme.|$|R
25|$|Atomic Radius: With {{increasing}} atomic radius, acidity also increases. For example, HCl and HI, both strong acids, ionize 100% {{in water}} to become their respective ionic constituents. However, HI {{is stronger than}} HCl. This is because the atomic radius of an atom of iodine is much larger {{than that of a}} <b>chlorine</b> <b>atom.</b> As a result, the negative charge over the I− anion is dispersed over a larger electron cloud and its attraction for the proton (H+) is not as strong as the same attraction in HCl. Therefore, HI is ionized (deprotonated) more readily.|$|E
25|$|The OH {{group is}} not a good leaving group in {{nucleophilic}} substitution reactions, so neutral alcohols do not react in such reactions. However, if the oxygen is first protonated to give R−OH2+, the leaving group (water) is much more stable, and the nucleophilic substitution can take place. For instance, tertiary alcohols react with hydrochloric acid to produce tertiary alkyl halides, where the hydroxyl group is replaced by a <b>chlorine</b> <b>atom</b> by unimolecular nucleophilic substitution. If primary or secondary alcohols are to be reacted with hydrochloric acid, an activator such as zinc chloride is needed. In alternative fashion, the conversion may be performed directly using thionyl chloride.|$|E
25|$|Clomipramine is a {{tricyclic}} compound, specifically a dibenzazepine, and possesses three rings fused {{together with}} a side chain attached in its chemical structure. Other dibenzazepine TCAs include imipramine, desipramine, and trimipramine. Clomipramine is a derivative of imipramine with a <b>chlorine</b> <b>atom</b> added to one of its rings and {{is also known as}} 3-chloroimipramine. It is a tertiary amine TCA, with its side chain-demethylated metabolite desmethylclomipramine being a secondary amine. Other tertiary amine TCAs include amitriptyline, imipramine, dosulepin (dothiepin), doxepin, and trimipramine.

500|$|Perchlorates and {{perchloric acid}} (HOClO3) {{are the most}} stable oxo-compounds of {{chlorine}}, {{in keeping with the}} fact that chlorine compounds are most stable when the <b>chlorine</b> <b>atom</b> is in its lowest (−1) or highest (+7) possible oxidation states. Perchloric acid and aqueous perchlorates are vigorous and sometimes violent oxidising agents when heated, in stark contrast to their mostly inactive nature at room temperature due to the high activation energies for these reactions for kinetic reasons. Perchlorates are made by electrolytically oxidising sodium chlorate, and perchloric acid is made by reacting anhydrous sodium perchlorate or barium perchlorate with concentrated hydrochloric acid, filtering away the chloride precipitated and distilling the filtrate to concentrate it. Anhydrous perchloric acid is a colourless mobile liquid that is sensitive to shock that explodes on contact with most organic compounds, sets hydrogen iodide and thionyl chloride on fire and even oxidises silver and gold.

2500|$|Hydrogen {{chloride}} is a diatomic molecule, {{consisting of}} a hydrogen atom H and a <b>chlorine</b> <b>atom</b> Cl connected by a polar covalent bond. The <b>chlorine</b> <b>atom</b> is much more electronegative than the hydrogen atom, which makes this bond polar. Consequently, the molecule has a large dipole moment with a negative partial charge (δ−) at the <b>chlorine</b> <b>atom</b> and a positive partial charge (δ+) at the hydrogen atom. In part because of its high polarity, HCl is very soluble in water (and in other polar solvents). It is polar covalent instead of Ionic because the differences in hydrogen and chlorines electronegativity is small enough that a complete ionic bond doesn't form. Any electronegativity between [...]6 and 1.67 creates a polar covalent bond.|$|E
