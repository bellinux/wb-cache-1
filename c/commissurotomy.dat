40|$|BACKGROUND: Combined mitral and {{aortic valve}} disease {{requiring}} surgery may involve the tricuspid valve as well. Our treatment policy is conservative especially for tricuspid regurgitation which is operated on when severe only. METHODS: A retrospective study was performed at a tertiary and secondary referral center for cardiovascular disease. Over a 15 -year period, 65 consecutive patients underwent aortic and mitral surgery with concomitant tricuspid regurgitation and/or stenosis. Fifty-five/ 65 (85 %) patients were in NYHA class III-IV. Fifty-eight/ 65 (89 %) patients had tricuspid regurgitation secondary to right chamber dilatation and 7 / 65 (11 %) had tricuspid stenosis and/or regurgitation because of previous endocarditis. Twenty-two/ 65 (34 %) tricuspid valves were operated on: 18 / 22 (82 %) de Vega annuloplasty, 2 / 22 (9 %) <b>commissurotomies</b> and 2 / 22 (9 %) prosthetic valves. Mortality and complications were recorded during a mean follow-up of 5. 3 yrs (range, 6 months- 15. 3 yrs). Event-free survivals were determined using the Kaplan-Meier method. RESULTS: Hospital mortality was 6. 2 % (4 / 65) and the complication rate was 18. 5 % (12 / 65). The freedom from late valve related mortality and morbidity at 5, 10 and 15 years was 86 +/- 5. 5 %, 81. 9 +/- 6. 8 %, and 81. 9 +/- 6. 8 % respectively. One valve related complication {{was due to}} the tricuspid valve. At last follow-up, 87 % (47 / 54) of the survivors were in NYHA class I-II. CONCLUSIONS: With a conservative policy of tricuspid valve intervention, functional results of this patient population are good and long-term valve related morbidity and mortality are mainly related to the mitral and aortic valve procedures...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: Rheumatic {{heart disease}} remains a {{significant}} cause of {{morbidity and mortality}} and it {{is the leading cause of}} acquired paediatric cardiac disease in the developing world. The aim of this study was to understand the burden of rheumatic heart disease and to review the surgical management of rheumatic mitral valve disease at our institution. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed 76 consecutive patients who underwent mitral valve surgery for rheumatic heart disease between 1998 and 2010. The results and follow-up were reviewed, where death and reoperation were the primary endpoints. The follow up included a review of the latest information from the patients' medical records and telephonic interviews or home visits. Results: A 91 % follow up was achieved over a median follow up period of 7. 4 years (range 0. 1 - 15. 2 years). The mean age at surgery was 10. 7 years (SD +- 2. 7 years). The females constituted 66 % and males 34 %. Mitral valve repairs were performed in 64 % of patients and of the 64 % repairs, 0. 06 % only had <b>commissurotomies.</b> Replacements were performed in 36 % of patients. All mitral valve replacements were mechanical prostheses. The actuarial freedom from reoperation for repairs was 83 % (+- 2. 2) and 66 % (+- 3. 4) at 5 and 10 years and for replacements was 87 % (+- 4. 8) and 87 %(+- 4. 8) respectively (p= 0. 27). Actuarial freedom from embolic cerebrovascular accidents in the repair group at both 5 and 10 years was 100 %, compared to 90. 2 % (+- 6. 6) and 79 % (+- 12. 0) for the replacement group at 5 and 10 years respectively (p= 0. 02). Actuarial freedom from death at 5 and 10 years for children over 12. 8 years was 77. 7 % (+- 9. 9) and 69. 1 % (+- 12. 0) respectively, compared to 93. 6 % (+- 3. 6) and 93. 6 % (+- 3. 6) for children under 12. 8 years (p= 0. 03). No statistical significant difference was noted in freedom from valve related failure and death between repairs and replacements. Conclusions: There was no significant difference in survival between mitral valve repairs and replacements. There was surprisingly worse survival among children who were above 12. 8 years at time of the surgery...|$|R

5000|$|Further {{research}} had continued by Roger Sperry up {{until his death}} in 1994 and Michael Gazzaniga still is researching the split-brain. Their findings have been rarely critiqued and disputed, however a popular belief that some people are more [...] "right-brained" [...] or [...] "left-brained" [...] has developed. In the mid 1980s Jarre Levy, a psychobiologist at the University of Chicago, had set out and been in the forefront of scientists who wanted to dispel the notion we have two functioning brains. She believes that because each hemisphere has separate functions that they must integrate their abilities instead of separating them. Levy also claims that no human activity uses only one side of the brain. In 1998 a French study by Hommet and Billiard was published that questioned Sperry and Gazzaniga's study that severing the corpus callosum actually divides the hemispheres of the brain. They found that children born without a corpus callosum demonstrated that information was being transmitted between hemispheres, they concluded that subcortical connections must be present in these children with this rare brain malformation. They are unclear about whether these connections are present in split-brain patients though. Another study by Parsons, Gabrieli, Phelps, and Gazzaniga in 1998 demonstrated that split-brain patients may commonly perceive the world differently from the rest of us. Their study suggested that communication between brain hemispheres is necessary for imaging or simulating in your mind the movements of others.

40|$|AbstractFrom 1967 to 1988, 339 {{patients}} with mitral stenosis underwent surgical <b>Commissurotomy,</b> 103 with a closed and 236 {{with an open}} technique. The 1 month and 1, 5, 10 and 20 year overall survival rate was 99. 7 %, 99 %, 95 %, 87 % and 59 %, respectively, and the technique (open versus closed) was not a risk factor. Technique was also not {{a risk factor for}} a second mitral <b>Commissurotomy,</b> subsequent mitral valve replacement, thromboembolism or poor functional status. Risk factors were older age at <b>Commissurotomy,</b> black race, higher pulmonary vascular resistance, mitral leaflet calcification, left ventricular enlargement and postcommissurotomy mitral incompetence. The closed technique was a risk factor for mitral incompetence immediately after <b>Commissurotomy,</b> but important incompetence developed in only 2 of the 103 patients undergoing closed <b>Commissurotomy.</b> Mitral valve replacement was not required within 10 years in 78 % of patients and within 20 years in 47 %.

METHODSWe studied 232 patients who had undergone percutaneous mitral <b>commissurotomy</b> a mean of 16 ± 8 years after surgical <b>commissurotomy.</b> Mean age was 47 ± 14 years; 81 patients (35 %) had valve calcification. All patients had restenosis with bilateral commissural fusion as assessed by echocardiography. Technical failure occurred in 9 patients and the procedure used a single balloon in 7 patients, a double balloon in 95, and the Inoue balloon in 121. RESULTSComplications were death in 1 patient (0. 4 %) and mitral regurgitation > 2 / 4 in 10 (4 %); 191 patients (82 %) had good immediate results (valve area ≥ 1. 5 cm 2 without regurgitation > 2 / 4). Predictors of poor immediate results in multivariate analysis were older age (p < 0. 001), lower initial valve area (p = 0. 01) {{and the use of the}} double-balloon technique (p = 0. 015).

The NHLBI established the multicenter Balloon Valvuloplasty Registry in November 1987 to assess both short-and long-term safety and efficiency of percutaneous balloon mitral <b>commissurotomy.</b> Methods. Between November 1987 and October 1989, 736 patients ≥ 18 years old underwent percutaneous balloon mitral <b>commissurotomy</b> at 23 registry sites in North America.

Eighty percent of the patients were alive and free of mitral surgery or repeat balloon mitral <b>commissurotomy</b> at 1 year. The event-free survival rate was 80 ± 1. 5 % at 1 year, 71 ± 1. 7 % at 2 years, 66 ± 1. 8 % at 3 years and 60 ± 2. 0 % at 4 years. Important univariable predictors of actuarial mortality at 4 years included age > 70 years (51 % survival), New York Heart Association functional class IV (41 % survival) and baseline echocardiographic score > 12 (24 % survival).

ConclusionPTMC for mitral restenosis in patients with prior surgical valvotomy is as effective as in patients with prior PTMC despite older age, higher NYHA class, higher Wilkins score and atrial fibrillation and can be considered in all patients with restenosis irrespective {{of the type of}} past procedures done...|$|E
40|$|AbstractObjectives. The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the immediate and follow-up results of percutaneous transatrial mitral <b>commissurotomy</b> in 600 patients with rheumatic mitral stenosis. Background. Percutaneous transatrial mitral <b>commissurotomy</b> has emerged as an effective nonsurgical technique for patients with symptomatic mitral stenosis. Several studies have shown that the Immediate results are comparable to closed and open mitral valvotomy. Methods. Percutaneous transatrial mitral <b>commissurotomy</b> was performed in 600 patients with rheumatic mitral stenosis by the double-balloon (290 patients [48. 3 %]) and Row-guided inoue balloon (310 patients [51. 7 %]) techniques. There were 154 male (25. 6 %) and 446 female (77. 4 %) patients with a mean [±SD] age of 27 ± 8 years (range 8 to 60). Atrial fibrillation was present in 26 patients (4. 3 %), mitral regurgitation ≤ grade 2 in 62 (10. 3 %) and densely calcific valve in 12 (2 %). All patients had clinical and echocardiographic (two-dimensional, continuous wave Doppler, color flow imaging) follow-up at 3 -month intervals. Results. Percutaneous transatrial mitral <b>commissurotomy</b> was successful in 589 patients (9 S. 1 %), and optimal <b>commissurotomy</b> was achieved in 562 (93. 6 %), with an increase in mitral valve area from (mean ± SD) 0. 75 ± 0. 18 to 2. 2 ± 0. 38 cm 2 (p < 0. 001) and a decrease in transmitral end-diasiolic gradient front 27. 3 ± 6. 1 to 3. 8 ± 4. 2 mm Hg (p < 0. 001). Mitral regurgitation developed or increased in 208 patients (34. 6 %). Six patients (1 %) with mitral régurgitation required mitral valve replacement. Cardiac tarnponade occurred in 8 patients (1. 3 %). Six patients (1 %) died. Restenosis developed in 10 patients (1. 7 %) during a mean follow-up period of 37 ± 8 months (range 6 to 66). Conclusions. Percutaneous transatrial mitral <b>commissurotomy</b> is an effective, safe procedure with gratifying intermediate results. It should be considered the treatment of choice for rheumatic mitral stenosis...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} prior mitral surgical <b>commissurotomy</b> and echocardiographic score {{influence on}} the outcomes and complications of percutaneous mitral balloon valvuloplasty. METHODS: We performed 459 complete mitral valvuloplasty procedures. Four hundred thirteen were primary valvuloplasty and 46 were in patients who had undergone prior surgical <b>commissurotomy.</b> The prior <b>commissurotomy</b> group was older, had higher echo scores, and a tendency toward {{a higher percentage of}} atrial fibrillation. RESULTS: When the groups were compared with each other, no differences were found in pre- and postprocedure mean pulmonary artery pressure, mean mitral gradient, mitral valve area, and mitral regurgitation. Because we found no significant differences, we subdivided the entire group based on echo scores, those with echo scores 8 the mitral valve area being higher in the 8 echo score group. CONCLUSION: Dividing the groups based on echo score revealed that the higher echo score group had smaller mitral valve areas postvalvuloplasty...|$|E
