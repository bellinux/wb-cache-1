500|$|MRNA rescue {{experiments}} {{can often}} restore the wild-type phenotype to the embryos and {{provide evidence for}} the specificity of a Morpholino. In an mRNA rescue, a Morpholino is <b>co-injected</b> with an mRNA that codes for the morphlino's [...] protein. However, the rescue mRNA has a modified 5'-UTR (untranslated region) so that the rescue mRNA contains no target for the Morpholino. The rescue mRNA's coding region encodes the protein of interest. Translation of the rescue mRNA replaces production of the protein that was knocked down by the Morpholino. Since the rescue mRNA would not affect phenotypic changes due to the Morpholino's off-target gene expression modulation, this return to wild-type phenotype is further evidence of Morpholino specificity. [...] In embryos, Morpholinos can be tested in null mutants to check for unexpected RNA interactions, then used in a wild-type embryo to reveal the acute knockdown phenotype (often more extreme than the mutant phenotype, in which effects of losing the null gene can be concealed by genetic compensation).|$|E

Numerous {{studies have shown that}} the technology called steam and gas push (SAGP) is feasible for heavy oil and bitumen. However, most of these studies have focused on shallow heavy oil reservoirs and only a few works have investigated moderate-depth heavy oil reservoirs. In this study, laboratory experiments and numerical simulations were conducted to study shape change, steam chamber expansion, and temperature change after <b>co-injecting</b> NCG with steam into an actual moderate-depth heavy oil reservoir. Results showed that after <b>co-injecting</b> NCG with steam, the transverse expansion rate of the steam chamber accelerated, vertical expansion slowed down, thermal utilization increased, and oil–steam ratio improved. In addition, the injection parameters of SAGP were also optimized via numerical simulation, which indicated that SAGP could effectively improve development effect and recovery for moderate-depth heavy oil reservoirs...|$|R
40|$|In a {{previous}} study {{it was reported that}} fusion proteins composed of the atoxic C-terminal fragment of tetanus toxin (TTC) and green fluorescent protein or beta-galactosidase (GFP-TTC and beta-gal-TTC, respectively) rapidly cluster at motor nerve terminals of the mouse neuromuscular junction (NMJ). Because this traffic involves presynaptic activity, probably via the secretion of active molecules, we examined whether it is affected by brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). Quantitative confocal microscopy and a fluorimetric assay for beta-gal activity revealed that <b>co-injecting</b> BDNF and the fusion proteins significantly increased the kinetics and amount of the proteins' localization at the NMJ and their internalization by motor nerve terminals. The observed increases were independent of synaptic vesicle recycling because BDNF did not affect spontaneous quantal acetylcholine release. In addition, injecting anti-BDNF antibody shortly before injecting GFP-TTC, and before <b>co-injecting</b> GFP-TTC and BDNF, significantly reduced the fusion protein's localization at the NMJ. <b>Co-injecting</b> GFP-TTC with neurotrophin- 4 (NT- 4) or glial-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), but not with nerve growth factor, neurotrophin- 3 or ciliary neurotrophic factor, also significantly increased the fusion protein's localization at the NMJ. Thus, TTC probes may use for their neuronal internalization endocytic pathways normally stimulated by BDNF, NT- 4 and GDNF binding. Different tyrosine kinase receptors with similar signalling pathways are activated by BDNF/NT- 4 and GDNF binding. Thus, activated components of these signalling pathways may be involved in the TTC probes' internalization, perhaps by facilitating localization of receptors of TTC in specific membrane microdomains or by recruiting various factors needed for internalization of TTC...|$|R

To study the aptamer-protein interaction, first oligonucleotides are grafted through formation of thiol Self Assembling Monolayer (SAM) on gold substrate using piezoelectric dispensing system. Thiol groups are introduced on DNA nucleotides by N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS). Target oligonucleotides having a primary amine group at their 59th end are conjugated to HS-C (11)-NHS in phosphate buffer solution at pH 8.0 for one hour at room temperature. Aptamer grafting biosensor is placed on SPRM after rinsing. Then Thrombin is <b>co-injected</b> with excess of cytochrome C for signal specificity. Concentration of free thrombin is determined by calibration curve obtained by plotting initial slope of the signal at the beginning of injection against concentration.

The main research objectives of this simulation and experimental study are to investigate oil recovery mechanisms under SAGD process with different injection fluids, including steam, solvent or steam with solvent. 2 D simulation studies based on typical Athabasca reservoir properties have been performed.
