5|$|The HDMI {{standard}} {{was not designed}} to pass <b>closed</b> <b>caption</b> data (for example, subtitles) to the television for decoding. As such, any <b>closed</b> <b>caption</b> stream must be decoded and included as an image in the video stream(s) prior to transmission over an HDMI cable to be viewed on the DTV. This limits the caption style (even for digital captions) to only that decoded at the source prior to HDMI transmission. This also prevents closed captions when transmission over HDMI is required for upconversion. For example, a DVD player that sends an upscaled 720p/1080i format via HDMI to an HDTV has no way to pass Closed Captioning data so that the HDTV can decode it, {{as there is no}} line 21 VBI in that format.|$|E
5|$|Following its {{cinematic}} {{release in}} theaters, the Region 1 Code widescreen {{edition of the}} film was released on DVD in the United States on March 4, 2014. Special features for the DVD include; a <b>Closed</b> <b>Caption</b> option, The Team - Meet the creative minds assembled by Director Steve McQueen and bring Solomon Northup's journey to life bonus selection, and The Score - Follow film Composer Hans Zimmer creating his dramatic score feature. In supplemental fashion, a widescreen hi-definition Blu-ray Disc version of the film was also released on the same day. Special features include; a historical portrait from Director Steve McQueen's documentary feature, cast and crew interviews, The Team special feature, and The Score selection. An additional viewing option for the film in the media format of Video on demand has been made available as well.|$|E
25|$|Open {{captioning}} {{in a film}} theater can {{be accomplished}} through burned-in captions, projected text or bitmaps, or (rarely) a display located above or below the movie screen.

25|$|DVDs for the U.S. market now {{sometimes}} have three forms of English subtitles: SDH subtitles; English subtitles, helpful for viewers {{who may not}} be hearing impaired but whose first language may not be English (although they are usually an exact transcript and not simplified); and <b>closed</b> <b>caption</b> data that is decoded by the end-user's <b>closed</b> <b>caption</b> decoder. Most anime releases in the U.S. only include as subtitles translations of the original material; therefore, SDH subtitles of English dubs ("dubtitles") are uncommon.|$|E
25|$|QuickTime video {{supports}} raw 608 caption data via proprietary <b>closed</b> <b>caption</b> track, {{which are}} just EIA-608 byte pairs {{wrapped in a}} QuickTime packet container with different IDs for both line 21 fields. These captions can be turned on and off and appear in the same style as TV closed captions, with all the standard formatting (pop-on, roll-up, paint-on), and can be positioned and split anywhere on the video screen. QuickTime <b>closed</b> <b>caption</b> tracks can be viewed in Macintosh or Windows versions of QuickTime Player, iTunes (via QuickTime), iPod Nano, iPod Classic, iPod Touch, iPhone, and iPad.|$|E

50|$|Poynter’s {{main focus}} is {{to fight for}} a higher {{quantity}} and quality of <b>Closed</b> <b>Captioning</b> on YouTube videos. According to Poynter, YouTube’s automatically-generated <b>Closed</b> <b>Captions</b> are often inaccurate, do not make sense {{in the context of the}} video, and/or contain profanity or inappropriate words. Because of this, Poynter encourages YouTube creators to manually enter their own <b>Closed</b> <b>Captions.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Prior to {{the advent}} of e-Captioning, <b>closed</b> <b>captioning</b> was added to a video using a linear deck-to-deck process, which {{required}} {{the use of a}} physical master video tape, two tape decks (play and record), and a hardware <b>closed</b> <b>captioning</b> encoder. [...] Since this equipment is very expensive, it was not practical for most video production facilities to own it on site. Instead, video editors had to first output a video to tape, then mail the tape to a special <b>closed</b> <b>captioning</b> facility. In the process, a second video tape with <b>closed</b> <b>captions</b> would be created, incurring generation loss. [...] Finally, the tape would need to be mailed to its final destination. If the video later required edits or changes, then the producer would have to ship another master tape to the <b>closed</b> <b>captioning</b> facility, repeating the process and possibly incurring additional fees.|$|R
25|$|Many viewers {{find that}} when they acquire a digital {{television}} or set-top box {{they are unable to}} view <b>closed</b> <b>caption</b> (CC) information, even though the broadcaster is sending it and the TV is able to display it.|$|E
25|$|Alternatively, Matrox video systems devised another {{mechanism}} for inserting <b>closed</b> <b>caption</b> data {{by allowing the}} video editor to include CEA-608 and CEA-708 in a discrete audio channel on the video editing timeline. This allows real-time preview of the captions while editing and is compatible with Final Cut Pro 6 and 7.|$|E
25|$|High-definition disc media (HD DVD, Blu-ray Disc) uses SDH {{subtitles}} as {{the sole}} method because technical specifications do not require HD to support line 21 closed captions. Some Blu-ray Discs, however, are said to carry a <b>closed</b> <b>caption</b> stream that only displays through standard-definition connections. Many HDTVs allow the end–user to customize the captions, including the ability to remove the black band.|$|E

25|$|Video CDs do {{not come}} with <b>closed</b> <b>caption</b> (on-screen text to aid viewers with hearing problems). When {{watching}} a film that exceeds 74 minutes (nearly 1¼ hours), which is the maximum video capacity of one disc, a viewer has to change the disc upon reaching halfway (unless the discs are played on a VCD changer that can hold multiple discs and play them automatically in succession), whereas a single VHS can hold 3½ hours of continuous video (though as of 2014, 10-hour VHS tapes are available).|$|E
25|$|In 2010, Vegas Pro, the {{professional}} non-linear editor, was updated to support importing, editing, and delivering CEA-608 closed captions. Vegas Pro 10, released on October 11, 2010, added several enhancements to the closed captioning support. TV-like CEA-608 closed captioning {{can now be}} displayed as an overlay when played back in the Preview and Trimmer windows, {{making it easy to}} check placement, edits, and timing of CC information. CEA708 style Closed Captioning is automatically created when the CEA-608 data is created. Line 21 closed captioning is now supported, as well as HD-SDI closed captioning capture and print from AJA and Blackmagic Design cards. Line 21 support provides a workflow for existing legacy media. Other improvements include increased support for multiple closed captioning file types, as well as the ability to export <b>closed</b> <b>caption</b> data for DVD Architect, YouTube, RealPlayer, QuickTime, and Windows Media Player.|$|E

50|$|There {{have also}} been a few local {{stations}} that have broadcast programming in American Sign Language, accompanied by English <b>closed</b> <b>captioning.</b> Prior {{to the development of}} <b>closed</b> <b>captioning,</b> it was not uncommon for some public television programs to incorporate ASL translations by an on-screen interpreter. An interpreter may still be utilized for the deaf and hard-of-hearing community for on-air emergency broadcasts (such as severe weather alerts given by local governments) as well as televised press conferences by local and state government officials accompanied by <b>closed</b> <b>captioning.</b>|$|R
25|$|Captioning is {{modulated}} {{and stored}} differently in PAL and SECAM 625 line 25 frame countries, where teletext is used {{rather than in}} EIA-608, but the methods of preparation and the line 21 field used are similar. For home Betamax and VHS videotapes, a shift down of this line 21 field must be done due to the greater number of VBI lines used in 625 line PAL countries, though only {{a small minority of}} European PAL VHS machines support this (or any) format for <b>closed</b> <b>caption</b> recording. Like all teletext fields, teletext captions can't be stored by a standard 625 line VHS recorder (due to the lack of field shifting support); they are available on all professional S-VHS recordings due to all fields being recorded. Recorded Teletext caption fields also suffer from a higher number of caption errors due to increased number of bits and a low SNR, especially on low-bandwidth VHS. This is why Teletext captions used to be stored separately on floppy disk to the analogue master tape. DVDs have their own system for subtitles and/or captions that is digitally inserted in the data stream and encoded on playback in video field lines.|$|E
25|$|NTSC DVDs {{may carry}} closed {{captions}} in data packets of the MPEG-2 video streams {{inside of the}} Video-TS folder. Once played out of the analog outputs of a set top DVD player, the caption data is converted to the Line 21 format. They are output by the player to the composite video (or an available RF connector) for a connected TV's built-in decoder or a set-top decoder as usual. They can not be output on S-Video or component video outputs {{due to the lack}} of a colorburst signal on line 21. (Actually, regardless of this, if the DVD player is in interlaced rather than progressive mode, closed captioning will be displayed on the TV over component video input if the TV captioning is turned on and set to CC1.) When viewed on a personal computer, caption data can be viewed by software that can read and decode the caption data packets in the MPEG-2 streams of the DVD-Video disc. Windows Media Player (before Windows 7) in Vista supported only <b>closed</b> <b>caption</b> channels 1 and 2 (not 3 or 4). Apple's DVD Player does not have the ability to read and decode Line 21 caption data which are recorded on a DVD made from an over-the-air broadcast. It can display some movie DVD captions.|$|E
500|$|The video {{begins with}} a <b>closed</b> <b>caption</b> that reads [...] "Britney Spears – Stronger", amidst {{the sound of a}} storm. It then cuts to a close up of Spears looking at her boyfriend, who is smiling with another woman holding him. She realizes she is better without him and walks away, after saying, [...] "Whatever," [...] to the audience. There is a shot of the tower hotel they were in, in an {{apparent}} semi-futuristic world, having a party in the restaurant in the hotel tower at the top, and then the hotel tower explodes and blows up. At the beginning of the first chorus, Spears starts dancing with an Emeco 1006-style chair in front of a black background. The second half of the video finds Spears driving away from the party in a classic Ford Mustang car during a thunderstorm; however, before long, her car goes into a spin out, then stops on {{the very edge of the}} bridge. After recovering from the shock of it, she's forced to continue walking on in the rain. Cuts of her dancing with a cane, transformed from the chair, are also included. The video ends with Spears walking across a bridge. Two versions of the video exist, one in which at the end of video, Spears stands in mid-air above the spinning chair, and in the other a close up of her singing. Nuzhat Naoreen of MTV praised the music video, saying, [...] "few performers can work an entire routine on and around a chair as well as Britney did in 'Stronger'". The music video received a nomination on the 2001 MTV Video Music Awards for Best Pop Video.|$|E

2500|$|This new closed {{captioning}} workflow known as e-Captioning involves making a proxy video from the non-linear system to import into a third-party non-linear {{closed captioning}} software. Once the closed captioning software project is completed, it must export a <b>closed</b> <b>caption</b> file {{compatible with the}} non-linear editing system. In the case of Final Cut Pro 7, three different file formats can be accepted: a [...]SCC file (Scenarist <b>Closed</b> <b>Caption</b> file) for Standard Definition video, a QuickTime 608 <b>closed</b> <b>caption</b> track (a special 608 coded track in the [...]mov file wrapper) for standard-definition video, and finally a QuickTime 708 <b>closed</b> <b>caption</b> track (a special 708 coded track in the [...]mov file wrapper) for high-definition video output.|$|E
2500|$|In mid-2009, Apple {{released}} Final Cut Pro version 7 {{and began}} support for inserting <b>closed</b> <b>caption</b> data into SD and HD tape masters via firewire and compatible video capture cards. [...] Up until this time, {{it was not}} possible for video editors to insert caption data with both CEA-608 and CEA-708 to their tape masters. The typical workflow included first printing the SD or HD video to a tape and sending it to a professional <b>closed</b> <b>caption</b> service company that had a stand-alone <b>closed</b> <b>caption</b> hardware encoder.|$|E
2500|$|Other {{non-linear}} editing systems indirectly support closed captioning only in Standard Definition line-21.
