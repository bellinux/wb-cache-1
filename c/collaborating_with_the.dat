Enlisted gendarmes, meanwhile, were recruited from indigenous Haitians who were paid between $10 and $25 per month.|$|E

The timescale is unclear, but Pausanias may have remained in possession of Byzantium until 470 BC.|$|E

5|$|After 1462 Wallachia {{preserved}} its autonomy {{mainly through}} {{the intervention of}} Stephen the Great of Moldavia. At {{the end of the}} century, however, Radu IV the Great (14951508) became an obedient subject of the sultan and visited Istanbul annually to personally offer the tribute. Even so, he could only stay in power by <b>collaborating</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> powerful Craioveşti family, strongly connected to the Ottomans by trading. In 1512 a member of this family, Neagoe (15121521) rose to throne, but he adopted the dynastic name of Basarab in order to legitimize his rule. He wrote the first original work of Romanian literature, titled Teachings, to his son, Teodosius on moral, political, and military questions.|$|E
5|$|After {{the liberation}} of France, Clouzot and several other {{directors}} were tried in court for <b>collaborating</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Germans.

Clouzot received letters of support from filmmakers and artists Jean Cocteau, René Clair, Marcel Carné and Jean-Paul Sartre, who were against the ruling. Clouzot's sentence was later shortened from life to two years. There is no official document making note of any apology or appeal. During his two-year banishment from filming, Clouzot worked with one of his supporters, Jean-Paul Sartre, who had been one of the first people to defend Le Corbeau.|$|E

5|$|During {{the early}} 1950s, {{a number of}} those convicted for <b>collaborating</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Nazi {{occupiers}} were freed from prison. Sympathetic to their plight, Hergé lent money to some and aided others in getting jobs at Tintin magazine, much to Leblanc's annoyance. For instance, as well as lending him money, Hergé used his connections to secure Raymond de Becker a job in Switzerland as a book shop sales inspector. He also hired those associated with collaboration for his Studios; his new colourist, Josette Baujot, was the wife of a recently assassinated member of the Walloon Legion, and his new secretary, Baudouin van der Branden de Reeth, had served a prison sentence for working at Le Nouveau Journal during the occupation.|$|E
5|$|In July 1676 Carbery {{called for}} a hearing against Morgan {{in front of the}} Assembly of Jamaica, accusing him of <b>collaborating</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> French to attack Spanish interests. Morgan {{admitted}} he had met the French officials, but indicated that that this was diplomatic relations, rather than anything duplicitous. In the summer of 1677 the Lords of Trade said they had yet to come to a decision on the matter and in early 1678 the king and the Privy Council recalled Carbery from Jamaica, leaving Morgan as governor for three months. In July 1678 Charles Howard, 1st Earl of Carlisle was appointed governor.|$|E

During their tour they witnessed fighting between Chetniks and Partisans. Due to their relative freedom of movement, the Americans assumed that the Chetniks controlled the territory they moved through. However, despite the praise that Seitz expressed for Lukačević, the Chetnik leader was <b>collaborating</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Germans {{at the same time}} that he was hosting the visiting Americans.|$|E

After Massoud was killed September 9, 2001 in a Taliban bombing, Raphel's critics accused her of <b>collaborating</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Taliban to advance American commercial interests even as the group gave refuge to Osama bin Laden, Ayman al-Zawahiri and other senior al-Qaeda leaders in the time leading up to the September 11 attacks.|$|E
5|$|Leopold was keen {{to find an}} {{accommodation}} with Germany in 1940, hoping that Belgium would remain as a unified and semi-autonomous state within a German-dominated Europe. As part of this plan, in November 1940, Leopold visited Adolf Hitler, the Führer of Germany, in Berchtesgaden to ask for Belgian prisoners of war to be freed. An agreement was not reached and Leopold returned to Belgium. This fueled the belief that Leopold, who had expressed anti-Semitic views before the war, was <b>collaborating</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Nazis rather than defending his country's interests.|$|E
5|$|Lunars English {{version was}} handled by Working Designs, a small California-based {{publisher}} {{who had previously}} localized smaller games for the TurboGrafx-16 and TurboDuo. Their biggest project yet, the team, headed by company {{vice president and chief}} writer Victor Ireland, took to the project seriously, often <b>collaborating</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> original Japanese team themselves. New gameplay elements were often added at Ireland's request, including new sequences such as playing Alex's harp to awaken Luna {{near the end of the}} game. Working Designs also put extra effort into the game's packaging, giving the instruction booklet embossed lettering, and having seven separate stamps, each with different artwork, produced for the front of the game discs to increase collection value.|$|E
