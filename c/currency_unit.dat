5|$|The {{rates were}} {{determined}} by the Council of the European Union, based on a recommendation from the European Commission based on the market rates on 31 December 1998. They were set so that one European <b>Currency</b> <b>Unit</b> (ECU) would equal one euro. The European <b>Currency</b> <b>Unit</b> was an accounting unit used by the EU, based on the currencies of the member states; {{it was not a}} currency in its own right. They could not be set earlier, because the ECU depended on the closing exchange rate of the non-euro currencies (principally the pound sterling) that day.|$|E
5|$|Monopoly Junior {{was first}} {{published}} in 1990. Kenner Parker Tonka was acquired by Hasbro in 1991. An all-Europe edition was published by Parker Brothers in 1991 for the nations of the then European Communities, using the Ecu (European <b>Currency</b> <b>Unit).</b> After acquisition by Hasbro, publication of Monopoly in the U.S. ceased at the Parker Brothers plant in Salem, Massachusetts in November 1991.|$|E
50|$|For example, if you borrow 10,000,000 <b>units</b> of a <b>currency</b> {{from the}} bank at 10.5% annual {{interest}} {{for a period of}} 10 years (i.e., 120 months), then EMI = <b>Units</b> of <b>currency</b> 10,000,000 * 0.00875 * (1 + 0.00875)^120 / ((1 + 0.00875)^120 - 1) = <b>Units</b> of <b>currency</b> 134,935. i.e., you will have to pay total <b>currency</b> <b>units</b> 134,935 for 120 months to repay the entire loan amount. The total amount payable will be 134,935 * 120 = 16,192,200 <b>currency</b> <b>units</b> that includes <b>currency</b> <b>units</b> 6,192,200 as interest toward the loan.|$|R

50|$|If {{these data}} become {{separated}} from core samples, {{it is generally}} impossible to regain that data. The cost of a coring operation can vary from a few <b>currency</b> <b>units</b> (for a hand-caught core from a soft soil section) to {{tens of millions of}} <b>currency</b> <b>units</b> (for sidewall cores from a remote-area offshore borehole many kilometres deep). Inadequate recording of such basic data has ruined the utility of both types of core.|$|R
5|$|The {{currency}} {{was introduced}} in non-physical form (traveller's cheques, electronic transfers, banking, etc.) at midnight on 1 January 1999, when the national currencies of participating countries (the eurozone) ceased to exist independently. Their exchange rates were locked at fixed rates against each other. The euro thus became the successor to the European <b>Currency</b> <b>Unit</b> (ECU). The notes and coins for the old currencies, however, continued {{to be used as}} legal tender until new euro notes and coins were introduced on 1 January 2002.|$|E
5|$|The name euro {{was officially}} adopted on 16 December 1995 in Madrid. The euro was {{introduced}} to world financial markets as an accounting currency on 1 January 1999, replacing the former European <b>Currency</b> <b>Unit</b> (ECU) {{at a ratio of}} 1:1 (US$1.1743). Physical euro coins and banknotes entered into circulation on 1 January 2002, making it the day-to-day operating currency of its original members, and by May 2002 had completely replaced the former currencies. While the euro dropped subsequently to US$0.8252 within two years (26 October 2000), it has traded above the U.S. dollar since the end of 2002, peaking at US$1.6038 on 18 July 2008. Since late 2009, the euro has been immersed in the European sovereign-debt crisis which has {{led to the creation of}} the European Financial Stability Facility as well as other reforms aimed at stabilising the currency. In July 2012, the euro fell below US$1.21 for the first time in two years, following concerns raised over Greek debt and Spain's troubled banking sector. As of October 2017, the euro–dollar exchange rate stands at ~US$1.18.|$|E
5|$|Following the Smithsonian Agreement, {{member states}} of the European Economic Community adopted a {{narrower}} currency band of 1.125% for exchange rates among their own currencies, creating a smaller scale fixed exchange rate system known as the snake in the tunnel. The snake proved unsustainable as it did not compel EEC countries to coordinate macroeconomic policies. In 1979, the European Monetary System (EMS) phased out the currency snake. The EMS featured two key components: the European <b>Currency</b> <b>Unit</b> (ECU), an artificial weighted average market basket of European Union members' currencies, and the Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM), a procedure for managing exchange rate fluctuations in keeping with a calculated parity grid of currencies' par values. The parity grid was derived from parities each participating country established for its currency with all other currencies in the system, denominated in terms of ECUs. The weights within the ECU changed in response to variances in the values of each currency in its basket. Under the ERM, if an exchange rate reached its upper or lower limit (within a 2.25% band), both nations in that currency pair were obligated to intervene collectively in the foreign exchange market and buy or sell the under- or overvalued currency as necessary to return the exchange rate to its par value according to the parity matrix. The requirement of cooperative market intervention marked a key difference from the Bretton Woods system. Similarly to Bretton Woods however, EMS members could impose capital controls and other monetary policy shifts on countries responsible for exchange rates approaching their bounds, as identified by a divergence indicator which measured deviations from the ECU's value. The central exchange rates of the parity grid could be adjusted in exceptional circumstances, and were modified every eight months on average during the systems' initial four years of operation. During its twenty-year lifespan, these central rates were adjusted over 50 times.|$|E
50|$|Generated bundles {{are packed}} {{together}} to 10-bundles bunch (1000 banknotes) and vacuumized. A cliche print containing bank and branch details {{is applied to}} the plastic package seal.Vacuum banknotes packing is the most reliable and effective way of <b>currency</b> <b>units</b> storing. Vacuum packing enables to prevent negative impact of the environment on the banknotes and coins; vacuumized <b>currency</b> <b>units</b> are effectively protected against ingress of moisture, dust and dirt. One of the vacuum packing benefits is exclusion of undetectable unauthorized package opening possibility, which effectively prevents stealing of banknotes during their transportation or storage. Vacuum packing of the banknotes provides space saving in the box used by CIT guards for cash transportation. <b>Currency</b> <b>units</b> are vacuum packed by means of vacuum sealers.|$|R
