40|$|BACKGROUND L-Ascorbic acid is an {{essential}} part of the human diet and has been associated with a wide range of chronic complex diseases, including cardiovascular outcomes. To date, there are no confirmed genetic correlates of <b>circulating</b> <b>concentrations</b> of L-ascorbic acid. OBJECTIVE We aimed to confirm the existence of an association between common variation at the SLC 23 A 1 gene locus and <b>circulating</b> <b>concentrations</b> of L-ascorbic acid. Design: We used a 2 -stage design, which included a discovery cohort (the British Women's Heart and Health Study), a series of follow-up cohorts, and meta-analysis (totaling 15, 087 participants) to assess the relation between variation at SLC 23 A 1 and <b>circulating</b> <b>concentrations</b> of L-ascorbic acid. RESULTS In the discovery cohort, variation at rs 33972313 was associated with a reduction in <b>circulating</b> <b>concentrations</b> of L-ascorbic acid (- 4. 15 {micro}mol/L; 95 % CI: - 0. 49, - 7. 81 {micro}mol/L; P = 0. 03 reduction per minor allele). Pooled analysis of the relation between rs 33972313 and circulating L-ascorbic acid across all studies confirmed this and showed that each additional rare allele was associated with a reduction in <b>circulating</b> <b>concentrations</b> of L-ascorbic acid of - 5. 98 {micro}mol/L (95 % CI: - 8. 23, - 3. 73 {micro}mol/L; P = 2. 0 x 10 - 7 per minor allele). CONCLUSIONS A genetic variant (rs 33972313) in the SLC 23 A 1 vitamin C active transporter locus was identified that is reliably associated with <b>circulating</b> <b>concentrations</b> of L-ascorbic acid in the general population.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the {{hormonal}} response to acute ethanol ingestion following a bout of heavy resistance exercise in women. Eight resistance trained women completed two identical acute heavy resistance exercise tasks (AHRET). From 10 - 20 minutes post-AHRET, participants consumed either a grain ethanol or a placebo beverage. Blood was collected before (PRE) and immediately after the AHRET (IP) and then every 20 minutes for five hours. Blood collected after beverage ingestion was pooled into 3 batches (phases: 20 - 40 minutes, 60 - 120 minutes, and 140 - 300 minutes post-exercise) and analyzed for serum total testosterone (TT), free testosterone (FT), insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I), human growth hormone (GH), cortisol (COR), and estradiol (E 2) <b>concentrations.</b> <b>Circulating</b> <b>concentrations</b> of TT were significantly greater at P 20 - 40 than at PRE, P 60 - 120, and P 140 - 300. <b>Circulating</b> <b>concentrations</b> of FT were significantly greater at P 20 - 40 than at all other times. <b>Circulating</b> <b>concentrations</b> of GH were significantly greater at IP than at PRE, P 60 - 120, and P 140 - 300. <b>Circulating</b> <b>concentrations</b> of COR were significantly greater at P 20 - 40 than at all other times.

5000|$|The term [...] "HSD2 neurons" [...] {{is used in}} the {{scientific}} literature to refer to a subpopulation of neurons in the NTS which express both the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) [...] and 11-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2 (HSD2). HSD2 is an enzyme that metabolizes cortisol and other glucocorticosteroids, which typically prevent aldosterone from binding to the mineralocorticoid receptor. This pre-receptor mechanism for modifying hormone binding is necessary for cellular sensitivity to aldosterone because, under physiologic conditions, cortisol circulates at 100-1000 times higher concentrations than aldosterone. As both cortisol and aldosterone bind the mineralocorticoid receptor with equal affinity, cortisol effectively crowds out aldosterone in cells without abundant HSD2. In cells with HSD2, however, aldosterone has increased access to the MR, such that increases and decreases in the <b>circulating</b> <b>concentration</b> of this hormone will produce a change in receptor activity. In HSD2 neurons (and all other cells that express both HSD2 and MR), aldosterone binds to MR and translocates it from the cytoplasm to the nucleus, causing transcriptional changes. Unlike aldosterone-sensitive cells in epithelial tissues (e.g. in the kidney), the physiologic effects of aldosterone-MR activation in HSD2 neurons are unknown. It has been suggested, but not proven, that aldosterone promotes the firing activity of these neurons. Aldosterone is not necessary for HSD2 neuron activation because this can be evoked by sodium deprivation even in rats without adrenal glands, which are the exclusive source of circulating aldosterone.|$|E

The {{aim of this}} study was to determine the effect of glucose on follicle number and granulosa levels of Aromatase P 450 and phosphorylated Akt and AMPK. Twelve Ile-de-France ewes were allocated to two groups; one (n= 7) infused with saline and the other (n= 5) with glucose (10 mM/h) for 72 h in the luteal phase. At the end of infusion, ovaries were collected and all follicles > 1 mm in diameter were dissected to recover granulosa cells. Aromatase P 450 and phosphorylated Akt and AMPK were analysed by Western blotting of granulosa cell lysates. Blood plasmas collected before and during the infusions were analysed for progesterone, oestradiol, LH, FSH, glucose, insulin and IGF-I. The infusion of glucose significantly increased follicle number but, significantly reduced Aromatase P 450 and phosphorylated Akt and AMPK in granulosa cells. The <b>circulating</b> <b>concentration</b> of glucose rose significantly 3 h after the start of the glucose infusion and remained elevated until 27 h then fell; the <b>circulating</b> <b>concentration</b> of insulin rose significantly by 3 h and remained elevated. The <b>circulating</b> <b>concentration</b> of oestradiol fell significantly by 32 h and remained low; the circulating concentrations of LH and FSH were unaffected. These data show that short-term infusion of glucose stimulated follicular growth but decreased Aromatase P 450 in granulosa cells. The reduced levels of phosphorylated Akt and AMPK suggest that the phosphatidylinositol 3 -kinase pathway has been inhibited by high concentrations of glucose. These data also suggest that there may be functional cross-talk between FSH and insulin signalling in granulosa cells...|$|E

The aim of the present work was to evaluate the effect of obesity on <b>circulating</b> <b>concentrations</b> and gene expression levels of NAMPT in human peripheral blood cells (PBCs) {{as well as its}} involvement in inflammation, glucose and lipid metabolism. METHODS AND RESULTS: Forty-four serum samples obtained from 14 lean and 30 obese volunteers were used to analyse the <b>circulating</b> <b>concentrations</b> of NAMPT. In addition, PBC, omental adipose tissue (OM) and liver biopsy samples obtained from a subgroup of subjects were used to determine transcript levels of NAMPT by Real-time PCR. Glucose and lipid profile as well as several inflammatory factors and hepatic enzymes were analysed. NAMPT <b>circulating</b> <b>concentrations</b> (P< 0. 01) and gene expression levels in PBC (P< 0. 05) were significantly increased in obese patients as compared to lean subjects. Total-cholesterol (P= 0. 016), HDL-cholesterol (P= 0. 036) and triglycerides (P= 0. 050) were significant and independent determinants of <b>circulating</b> <b>concentrations</b> of NAMPT (P< 0. 01).

The aim {{of the present study was}} to investigate the relationship between prostate cancer risk and <b>circulating</b> <b>concentrations</b> of folate and vitamin B(12) in a large prospective cohort. METHODS: We analyzed <b>circulating</b> <b>concentrations</b> of folate and vitamin B(12) in 869 cases and 1, 174 controls, individually matched on center, age, and date of recruitment, nested within the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition cohort. Relative risks (RR) for prostate cancer were estimated using conditional logistic regression models. RESULTS: Overall, no significant associations were observed for <b>circulating</b> <b>concentrations</b> of folate (P(trend) = 0. 62) or vitamin B(12) (P(trend) = 0. 21) with prostate cancer risk. RRs for a doubling in folate and vitamin B(12) concentrations were 1. 03 [95 % confidence interval (95 % CI), 0. 92 - 1. 16] and 1. 12 (95 % CI, 0. 94 - 1. 35), respectively. In the subgroup of cases diagnosed with advanced stage prostate cancer, elevated concentrations of vitamin B(12) were associated with increased risk (RR for a doubling in concentration, 1. 69; 95 % CI, 1. 05 - 2. 72, P(trend) = 0. 03). No other subgroup analyses resulted in a statistically significant association. CONCLUSION: This study does not provide strong support for an association between prostate cancer risk and <b>circulating</b> <b>concentrations</b> of folate or vitamin B(12).

Crude analyses confirmed the existence of differences in protein levels with race/ethnicity, sex, age, and body size. Reproductive, physical activity, smoking, and diet variables had less consistent effects. In multivariate analyses, IGF-I levels were lower and IGFBP- 3 were higher in females versus males. IGF-I and IGFBP- 3 declined with increasing age in both genders. Women in the highest quartile of body mass index showed depressed IGF-I and IGFBP- 3 levels; in men, height was significantly positively associated with both proteins. In women, alcohol was directly associated with IGFBP- 3. Both proteins were lowest among female Latinos. IGF-I was highest among female African Americans. In men, IGFBP- 3 was lowest among African Americans. Overall, although these factors were statistically significant determinants of IGF-related protein levels, they did not explain much of the variation in these levels.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the effects in Bos indicus calves of intra-testicular injection of either saline (n = 9) or one of two doses of zinc acetate ((ZA 1, 57. 75 mg, n= 10, or ZA 2, 71. 75 mg, n= 10) or surgical castration (n= 9) on <b>circulating</b> <b>concentrations</b> of testostosterone and liveweight. Human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG, 1500 IU) was administered 202 and 525 days after treatment on Day 0 and animals were slaughtered on Day 860. In animals left intact treatment with ZA reduced mean serum concentrations of testosterone (Saline: 5. 58 +/- 0. 79 ng/mL, ZA 1 : 1. 28 +/- 0. 27 ng/mL, ZA 2 : 1. 01 +/- 0. 17 ng/mL; P = 1. 0 ng/mL exhibited greater liveweights throughout most of the study and yielded heavier carcass weights (340. 9 +/- 7. 02 versus 309. 3 +/- 6. 17 kg, P= 0. 002). It is concluded that a single, intra-testicular administration of either 57. 75 mg or 71. 75 mg of ZA was able to similarly reduce <b>circulating</b> <b>concentrations</b> of testosterone without significantly affecting liveweights or carcass weights. Treatment with ZA can result in variation in <b>circulating</b> <b>concentrations</b> of testosterone which could lead to differences in behaviour, liveweights and carcass characteristics...|$|R

Dextromethorphan is the actual therapeutic agent in the combination; quinidine merely serves to inhibit the enzymatic degradation of dextromethorphan and thereby increase its <b>circulating</b> <b>concentrations</b> via inhibition of CYP2D6.|$|R
