25|$|As CS:GOs {{popularity}} as an eSport grew {{with increased}} viewership, there also came {{a desire for}} players to bet and gamble on matches. Outside of the United States, several sites arose to allow users to bet with direct <b>cash</b> <b>funds</b> on the result of matches from games like CS:GO. Cash gambling on sports, including eSports, is banned within 46 American states and in some European countries. However, American case law has determined that use of virtual goods for betting {{on the outcome of}} matches is legal and not covered under gambling laws. Companies like Blizzard Entertainment and Riot Games have made strong delineations between virtual currencies and real-money to stay within these prior rulings while offering betting on matches within their games using strictly-virtual funds.|$|E

2500|$|Beginning {{in early}} 1942, Lecca spearheaded {{extortion}} initiatives. He produced the special decrees requiring all non-deported Jews to contribute special <b>cash</b> <b>funds</b> for social causes benefiting ethnic Romanians. As early as January, he reported to Ion Antonescu that some 20,000 people targeted by this provision lacked {{the money and}} had therefore been prosecuted. Lecca informed that such blind severity defeated the economic purpose. He therefore proposed (successfully so) that {{a grand total of}} 100 million lei be collected from more affluent members of the community, and go directly through the Central Jewish Office. In August, he drafted a project to levy 1.2 billion lei from those Jewish business owners who had been spared [...] "Romanianization", on the pretense that it would help their conscripted coreligionists. The project was endorsed by Lecca's superiors, who raised the bar by a further 800 million lei, half of it diverted to a state-endorsed charity headed by Ion Antonescu's spouse, Maria. Lecca was by then also considering the demolition of synagogues left unused in areas subject to Jewish evictions. He countersigned a plan to recycle the resulting debris, as materials for the Romanian Orthodox church in Bucecea.|$|E

40|$|Inter {{corporate}} asset sales {{provide a}} viable alternative to mergers and acquisitions to create shareholder value for both the buyer and seller companies. Intercorporate asset sales are defined as the sale of autonomous operational assets which does not entail a change in ownership control of the seller. Mergers and acquisitions research found greater value was created by <b>cash</b> <b>funded</b> transactions compared to equity funded transactions. Contrary to mergers and acquisitions, asset sale research found equity funded transactions created greater value compared to <b>cash</b> <b>funded</b> transactions. This research provides {{a deeper understanding of the}} effect the method of payment has on the value created when selling assets, enabling management of acquiring and divesting companies to realise their maximum value creation potential. The population consisted of intercorporate asset sale transactions announced and concluded for the 11 year period from 1 January 2000 to 31 December 2011. The exact population was not known, therefore judgmental sampling was used to identify companies. Only companies listed on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange All Share Index were considered for qualifying asset sale transactions. In total 112 companies were reviewed for asset sales yielding 214 qualifying transactions which were divided in sub samples of 43 equity buyers, 68 cash buyers, 30 equity sellers and 73 cash sellers. Based on the event study methodology the short term metric of abnormal share price returns and the medium term metric of abnormal operating financial performance were used to calculate and compare the value created by equity and <b>cash</b> <b>funded</b> transactions. Both metrics concluded that equity funded asset sales created greater value compared to <b>cash</b> <b>funded</b> asset sales. Inferences were made between asset sales and mergers and acquisitions and the researcher concluded by proposing a model to optimise shareholder value. Based on the accounting performance of the buyer and the intrinsic value of the asset or target, the model is used to select the optimum combination of corporate activity and the method of payment to unlock the optimum shareholder value.
