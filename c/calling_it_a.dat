5|$|A dance-oriented song, it lyrically {{portrays a}} scorned woman seeking revenge on her lover. Police sirens, whispered vocals, {{throbbing}} beats and a dubstep breakdown provide the song with a suspense-filled atmosphere. The song received critical acclaim, most <b>calling</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> {{highlight of the}} album and also the boldest track of the album. Some even hailed {{it as one of}} Madonna's best songs.|$|E
5|$|It is an unseasonably hot Easter at church, {{and no one}} is {{interested}} in Reverend Lovejoy's sermons. When the collection plate is passed around, Homer puts in a chocolate Easter bunny that he found in the dumpster, enraging Reverend Lovejoy, <b>calling</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> wicked idol, and provoking him to read the Bible from the beginning.

5|$|Critical {{reception}} to {{the game}} has been positive. The average score in Metacritic is of 82 out of 100. The Japanese video game magazine Famitsu gave it a score of 36/40, earning the magazine's Platinum award and becoming the highest-ranking review score that week. The reviewers were generally positive about their experience: despite some comments about a lack of polish in environments, the game's character design, aesthetics, gameplay and story all came in for general praise, with multiple reviewers <b>calling</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> worthy part of the Megami Tensei series.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} {{said to be the}} largest non-wax Christmas candle in the country. Although {{conceived}} with the hopes of restoring Easton's pre-20th century reputation for elaborate Christmas decorations, city officials also believed a candle would serve as a symbol of peace for all religions and denominations. Due to its symbolism for peace and its placement over a Civil War monument, the candle has been the site of several anti-war protests over the decades. Some have criticized the Peace Candle, <b>calling</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> symbol of the over-commercialization of Christmas, and condemning the fact that it covers a war monument.|$|E
5|$|Prior to 1903, {{a simple}} wooden cross commemorated the battle site, {{located on the}} {{so-called}} Buchbuhl, a hill overlooking the village, and the plains to the southeast, {{where much of the}} fighting occurred. In 1903, a monument was erected to honor the battle. In 1945, when French troops arrived in the region, they closed the monument; the local pastor encouraged them to reopen it, <b>calling</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> chapel.|$|E

Latham called it the black-cheeked warbler. John Gould called it the yellow-faced honeyeater in 1848, which has become its official name. It is also known as the yellow-gaped honeyeater, or the quitchup, in reference to its call.|$|E
5|$|The Latin {{specific}} name pennanti {{is named for}} Thomas Pennant, who described the fisher in 1771. Buffon had first described the creature in 1765, <b>calling</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> pekan. Pennant examined the same specimen but called it a fisher, unaware of Buffon's earlier description. Other 18th-century scientists gave it similar names, such as Schreber, who named it Mustela canadensis, and Boddaert, who named it Mustela melanorhyncha. The fisher was eventually placed in the genus Martes by Smith in 1843.|$|E
5|$|The {{remnants}} of Arlene {{combined with a}} non-tropical system caused heavy rainfall across New York, with some locations reporting 6 to 7inches (150 to 175mm) of precipitation in a 2-hour period. The rainfall collected into streams and rivers, with some officials <b>calling</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> 1 in 500year flood. The flash flooding caused at least one mudslide, and damaged several roads. The flooding forced at least 20 to evacuate from their homes, and numerous houses were damaged. Strong winds also downed trees and power lines, causing scattered power outages. Damage totaled to $6.5million (2005USD).|$|E

5|$|The {{state is}} {{among the best in}} pre-kindergarten {{education}}, and the National Institute for Early Education Research rated it first in the United States with regard to standards, quality, and access to pre-kindergarten education in 2004, <b>calling</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> model for early childhood schooling. High school dropout rate decreased from 3.1 to 2.5 percent between 2007 and 2008 with Oklahoma ranked among 18 other states with 3 percent or less dropout rate. In 2004, the state ranked 36th in the nation for the relative number of adults with high school diplomas, though at 85.2 percent, it had the highest rate among Southern states.|$|E
5|$|Chris Beveridge's {{review for}} Fandom Post was highly {{positive}} towards the anime series, <b>calling</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> dark horse contender {{as one of}} their top new anime series of the year. Beveridge praised the technical and fundamental aspects of magic in the series for breaking the supernatural approach other works usually take and liked the potential impact it could have on future events. However, while the reviewer liked the series' technicality, they noted it will frustrate certain viewers in that aspect. Richard Eisenbeis, writing for Kotaku, liked the characters, story, the complex and technical magic system, and mysteries. However, Eisenbeis criticized the exposition, citing it to be poorly timed, heavy, and failing to explain things with better clarity. He concluded his review by writing how the anime might have been great if a different director or screenwriting was hired.|$|E
5|$|During Warwick's exile, King Edward {{stripped}} Montagu of the Earldom of Northumberland, {{making him}} Marquis of Montagu instead. John Neville {{appears to have}} seen this as a reduction in rank, and accepted it with poor grace. He seems particularly to have complained {{about the lack of}} landed estate that his new marquisate brought with it, <b>calling</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> 'pie's nest'. When the Earl of Warwick and Clarence returned, they distracted Edward with a rebellion in the north, which the king ordered Montagu to raise troops to repress in the king's name. Montagu, however, having raised a small army, turned against Edward, almost capturing him at Olney, Buckinghamshire; the king, with his other brother Richard, Duke of Gloucester, fled into exile in Burgundy.|$|E

5|$|In November 1934, Butler {{told the}} {{committee}} that one Gerald P. MacGuire told him {{that a group of}} businessmen, supposedly backed by a private army of 500,000 ex-soldiers and others, intended to establish a fascist dictatorship. Butler had been asked to lead it, he said, by MacGuire, who was a bond salesman with Grayson M–P Murphy & Co. The New York Times reported that Butler had told friends that General Hugh S. Johnson, former head of the National Recovery Administration, was to be installed as dictator, and that the J.P. Morgan banking firm was behind the plot. Butler told Congress that MacGuire had told him the attempted coup was backed by three million dollars, and that the 500,000 men were probably to be assembled in Washington, D.C. the following year. All the parties alleged to be involved publicly said there was no truth in the story, <b>calling</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> joke and a fantasy.|$|E
5|$|The {{idea for}} the game came from the producer, Masaru Oyamada, who wanted all Mana games to be playable on modern {{platforms}} for the series' 25th anniversary in 2016. Initially there was some argument at Square Enix about whether the remake {{should be done in}} 2D or 3D; they chose 3D, as it was thought to be easier to control on smartphones and because it {{could be used as a}} base for potential future Mana remakes. The game has received positive reviews, with reviewers giving particular praise to the visuals and the music, and some <b>calling</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> better Final Fantasy Adventure remake than the Game Boy Advance game Sword of Mana had been.|$|E
5|$|Baleen whales {{continue}} to be harvested. However, only three nations take whales: Iceland, Norway, and Japan. All these nations {{are part of the}} IWC, with Norway and Iceland rejecting the moratorium and continuing commercial whaling. Japan, being part of the IWC, whales under the Scientific Permit stated in Article VIII in the Convention for the Regulation of Whaling, which allows the taking of whales for scientific research. Japan has had two main research programs: the Joint Aquatic Resources Permit Application (JARPA) and the Japanese Research Program in the North (JARPN). JARPN is focused in the North Pacific and JARPA around the Antarctic. JARPA mainly caught Antarctic minke whales, catching nearly 7,000; to a far lesser extent, they also caught fin whales. Animal-rights activist groups, such as the Greenpeace, object to Japan's scientific whaling, with some <b>calling</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> substitute for commercial whaling. In 2014, the International Court of Justice (the UN judicial branch) banned the taking of whales for any purpose in the Southern Ocean Whale Sanctuary; however, Japan refuses to stop whaling and has only promised to cut their annual catches by a third (around 300 whales per year).|$|E

5|$|Phantom Blood {{was created}} using a ki-shō-ten-ketsu {{structure}} – introduction (ki), development (shō), twist (ten), and resolution (ketsu) – {{along with the}} rule of rising and falling, in which the hero must grow over time {{in relation to their}} starting point {{in the beginning of the}} story, and not stagnate or regress. Araki did however note that due to the weekly format of the series, Jonathan's initial regression when Dio turns Jonathan's happy life into hardships meant that Jonathan's growth remained in the negative for a few weeks after the series' premiere, leading to a negative feeling that Jonathan always loses. Araki implemented a similar growth curve for Dio, although with him rising towards evil. Despite following the rule of the ever-progressing hero, Araki decided to bend the rule and have Jonathan die to save his wife and child: he acknowledged that dying is as far negative as a hero can go, and called it unthinkable to do such a thing in a shōnen manga, but said that since he wanted to pass down the Joestar family's lineage, he needed Jonathan to die, and for his blood and spirit to be passed to Joseph, the protagonist of Battle Tendency, the second part in the series. While <b>calling</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> gamble, he called this passing of the torch a positive that enables the extreme negative of killing the first protagonist.|$|E
