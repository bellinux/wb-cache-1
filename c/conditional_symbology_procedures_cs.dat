40|$|Electronic charts {{are a new}} {{navigation}} {{aid that}} can provide significant benefits to maritime navigationsafety, and commerce. More than simply a computer graphics display, electronic chart systems combine both geographic and textual data into a readily useful operational tool. Electronic charts are a real-time navigation system that integrates a variety of information that is displayed and interpreted by the mariner. IHO Special Publication 52 (IHO-S- 52) is the IHO Specification for Chart Content and Display of ECDIS. It includes appendices describing the means/process for updating, color and symbol specifications. Electronic charts automate the process of integrating real-time positions with the chart display and allow the navigator to continuously assess the position and safety of the vessel. This paper discussed the key problems, which will provide the theoretical foundation and practical experience. On the bases of analyzing the S- 52 standard, this paper discussed the key technology in the Electronic chart display system, including such follows: Propose a new automatic assignment symbols which consist of points, lines and areas. According to the S- 57 standard and S- 52 standard, it is decided by the objects attribute when a symbol was shown. In {{order to meet the}} mariner’s evolving requirements, it should be designed with enough flexibility. It contains <b>conditional</b> <b>symbology</b> <b>procedures</b> for cases where symbolizing depends on circumstance, such as the mariner can select a safety depth or safety contour. For a safety depth, all soundings {{less than or equal to}} the safety depth are emphasized. For a safety contour, ECDIS highlights this contour over other depth contours.

A comparison of this efficient process to existing processes, as well as the scope and limitation of this approach, will be discussed;Part Three will discuss the use of three different palladium procedures for the allylic vinylation of cyclic alkenes. A variety of electron rich and electron poor vinylic halides, and cyclic alkenes containing 5 - to 8 -membered rings were examined. It has been found that procedure A was effective in the vinylation of cyclopentene, but it provided mixtures of double bond regioisomers when cycloheptene, and 2, 3 -dihydrofuran were employed. Procedure A was not effective in promoting this vinylation reaction with cyclohexene and cyclooctene. Procedure B, on the other hand, was effective in providing the desired allylic product when cyclohexene was employed, and it provided only the desired regioisomer when cycloheptene and 2, 3 -dihydrofuran were used. However, cyclooctene proved to be unreactive. <b>Procedure</b> <b>C</b> proved to be problematic, as it caused symmetrical dimerzation of the vinylic halide;Part Four will discuss the use of the different palladium procedures for the intramolecular vinylation of cyclic alkenes to generate a variety of carbo- and hetero-bicyclic compounds. Procedure A provided high yields of mixtures of double bond regioisomers each time, while procedure B was successful in providing only the desired regioisomer in good to excellent yields. The stereochemistry of the ring juncture has been determined to be cis in all cases.

40|$|Research {{has found}} that {{children}} with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) show significant deficits in receptive language skills (Wiesmer, Lord, 2 ̆ 6 Esler, 2010). One of the primary goals of applied behavior analytic intervention {{is to improve the}} communication skills of children with autism by teaching receptive discriminations. Both receptive discriminations and receptive language entail matching spoken words with corresponding objects, symbols (e. g., pictures or words), actions, people, and so on (Green, 2001). In order to develop receptive language skills, children with autism often undergo discrimination training within the context of discrete trial training. This training entails teaching the learner how to respond differentially to different stimuli (Green, 2001). It is through discrimination training that individuals with autism learn and develop language (Lovaas, 2003). The present study compares three procedures for teaching receptive discriminations: (1) simple/conditional (Procedure A), (2) conditional only (Procedure B), and (3) conditional discrimination of two target cards (<b>Procedure</b> <b>C).</b> Six children, ranging in age from 2 -years-old to 5 -years-old, with an autism diagnosis were taught how to receptively discriminate nine sets of stimuli. Results suggest that the extra training steps included in the simple/conditional and conditional only procedures may not be necessary to teach children with autism how to receptively discriminate. For all participants, <b>Procedure</b> <b>C</b> appeared to be the most efficient and effective procedure for teaching young children with autism receptive discriminations. Response maintenance and generalization probes conducted one-month following the end of training indicate that even though <b>Procedure</b> <b>C</b> resulted in less training sessions overall, no one procedure resulted in better maintenance and generalization than the others. In other words, more training sessions, as evident with the simple/conditional and conditional only procedures, did not facilitate participants’ ability to accurately respond or generalize one-month following training. The present study contributes to the literature on what is the most efficient and effective way to teach receptive discrimination during discrete trial training to children with ASD. These findings are critical as research shows that receptive language skills are predictive of better outcomes and adaptive behaviors in the future. ...|$|R

40|$|Three {{alternative}} extraction {{procedures were}} carried out in order to separate the antioxidant components and isolate an efficient extract from Origanum dictamnus. Procedure A included sequential extractions with petroleum ether (PE), diethyl ether (DE) and ethanol; procedure B sequential extractions with PE and ethyl acetate (EAc); <b>procedure</b> <b>C</b> a single step extraction with ethanol. The most efficient radical scavengers, according to the DPPH method, were isolated in ethanol extract of procedure A (mainly rosmarinic acid), followed by ethanol extract of <b>procedure</b> <b>C.</b> However, both ethanol extracts had low solubility in oil and could not protect it. EAc and DE extracts, containing mainly apigenin and epirosmanol ethyl ether, presented lower radical scavenging activity but were very effective against autoxidation of cottonseed oil (a concentration of 200  ppm was adequate to stabilize it). PE extract protected the oil effectively at concentration of 350  ppm, while being the least active against DPPH. Industrial relevance: This study examines Origanum dictamnus as a potential antioxidant additive for edible oils and fats. Three different extraction procedures of the raw material with non-toxic organic solvents were used to recover {{the sum of the}} extractable compounds and specific fractions respectively. The extraction procedures, accompanied with analytical techniques, led to the characterization of the antioxidant properties and the composition of the plant as well as the isolation of very efficient oil-soluble antioxidant fractions. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.
