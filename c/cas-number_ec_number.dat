50|$|Strictly speaking, <b>EC</b> <b>numbers</b> do {{not specify}} enzymes, but enzyme-catalyzed reactions. If {{different}} enzymes (for instance from different organisms) catalyze the same reaction, then they {{receive the same}} <b>EC</b> <b>number.</b> Furthermore, through convergent evolution, completely different protein folds can catalyze an identical reaction and therefore would be assigned an identical <b>EC</b> <b>number</b> (these are called non-homologous isofunctional enzymes, or NISE).

50|$|The Enzyme Commission <b>number</b> (<b>EC</b> <b>number)</b> is a {{numerical}} classification scheme for enzymes, {{based on the}} chemical reactions they catalyze.As a system of enzyme nomenclature, every <b>EC</b> <b>number</b> {{is associated with a}} recommended name for the respective enzyme.|$|R
40|$|Motivation: The enzyme {{nomenclature}} system, {{commonly known}} as the enzyme commission (<b>EC)</b> <b>number,</b> {{plays a key role in}} classifying and predicting enzymatic reactions. However, numerous reactions have been described in various pathways that do not have an official <b>EC</b> <b>number,</b> and the reactions are not expected to have an <b>EC</b> <b>number</b> assigned because of a lack of articles published on enzyme assays. To predict the <b>EC</b> <b>number</b> of a non-classified enzymatic reaction, we focus on the structural similarity of its substrate and product to the substrate and product of reactions that have been classified. Results: We propose a new method to assign <b>EC</b> <b>numbers</b> using a maximum common substructure algorithm, mutual information and a support vector machine, termed the Enzyme COmmission numbers Handler (ECOH). A jack-knife test shows that the sensitivity, precision and accuracy of the method in predicting the first three digits of the official <b>EC</b> <b>number</b> (i. e. the EC sub-subclass) are 86. 1 %, 87. 4 % and 99. 8 %, respectively. We furthermore demonstrate that, by examining the ranking in the candidate lists of EC sub-subclasses generated by the algorithm, the method can successfully predict the classification of 85 enzymatic reactions that fall into multiple EC sub-subclasses. The better performance of the ECOH as compared with existing methods and its flexibility in predicting <b>EC</b> <b>numbers</b> make it useful for predicting enzyme function...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Understanding of {{secondary}} metabolic pathway in plant {{is essential for}} finding druggable candidate enzymes. However, there are many enzymes whose functions are not yet discovered in organism-specific metabolic pathways. Towards identifying the functions of those enzymes, assignment of <b>EC</b> <b>numbers</b> to the enzymatic reactions they catalyze plays a key role, since <b>EC</b> <b>numbers</b> represent the categorization of enzymes on one hand, and the categorization of enzymatic reactions on the other hand. Results We propose reaction graph kernels for automatically assigning <b>EC</b> <b>numbers</b> to unknown enzymatic reactions in a metabolic network. Reaction graph kernels compute similarity between two chemical reactions considering the similarity of chemical compounds in reaction and their relationships. In computational experiments based on the KEGG/REACTION database, our method successfully predicted the first three digits of the <b>EC</b> <b>number</b> with 83 % accuracy. We also exhaustively predicted missing <b>EC</b> <b>numbers</b> in plant's secondary metabolism pathway. The prediction results of reaction graph kernels on 36 unknown enzymatic reactions are compared with an expert's knowledge. Using the same data for evaluation, we compared our method with E-zyme, and showed its ability to assign more <b>number</b> of accurate <b>EC</b> <b>numbers.</b> Conclusion Reaction graph kernels are a new metric for comparing enzymatic reactions. </p...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Despite {{the current}} {{availability}} of several {{hundreds of thousands}} of amino acid sequences, more than 36 % of the enzyme activities (<b>EC</b> <b>numbers)</b> defined by the Nomenclature Committee of the International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology (NC-IUBMB) are not associated with any amino acid sequence in major public databases. This wide gap separating knowledge of biochemical function and sequence information is found for nearly all classes of enzymes. Thus, there is an urgent need to explore these sequence-less <b>EC</b> <b>numbers,</b> in order to progressively close this gap. Description We designed ORENZA, a PostgreSQL database of ORphan ENZyme Activities, to collate information about the <b>EC</b> <b>numbers</b> defined by the NC-IUBMB with specific emphasis on orphan enzyme activities. Complete lists of all <b>EC</b> <b>numbers</b> and of orphan <b>EC</b> <b>numbers</b> are available and will be periodically updated. ORENZA allows one to browse the complete list of <b>EC</b> <b>numbers</b> or the subset associated with orphan enzymes or to query a specific <b>EC</b> <b>number,</b> an enzyme name or a species name for those interested in particular organisms. It is possible to search ORENZA for the different biochemical properties of the defined enzymes, the metabolic pathways in which they participate, the taxonomic data of the organisms whose genomes encode them, and many other features. The association of an enzyme activity with an amino acid sequence is clearly underlined, making it easy to identify at once the orphan enzyme activities. Interactive publishing of suggestions by the community would provide expert evidence for re-annotation of orphan <b>EC</b> <b>numbers</b> in public databases. Conclusion ORENZA is a Web resource designed to progressively bridge the unwanted gap between function (enzyme activities) and sequence (dataset present in public databases). ORENZA should increase interactions between communities of biochemists and of genomicists. This is expected {{to reduce the number of}} orphan enzyme activities by allocating gene sequences to the relevant enzymes. </p...|$|R
