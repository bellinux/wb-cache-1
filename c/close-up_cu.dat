40|$|<b>Close-up</b> (<b>CU)</b> is a {{photographic}} technique which tightly frames {{a person or}} an object. In movies, it is applied to guide audience attention and to evoke audience emotion. In this paper, we detect face CU, object CU, and lean of movies, which are widely used to romance emotions. A lean consists of shots in a sequence, with a close-up shot as focus. A set of features are extracted by considering movie making techniques and human attention for CU detection. The features are average saliency, color entropy, color variance, face height, skin area, and texture scales. These features are tested through statistical hypothesis test to be significantly discriminating for CUs. Then, Support Vector Machine (SVM) is applied on these features to detect face CU and object CU. Based on the face CU and object CU detection result, lean is further detected by investigating {{the changing of the}} face/object size. Lean detection is of challenge due to the technique of montage. We solve this problem through color similarity estimation and SIFT point matching. Experimental results on four full length movies verify the effectiveness of the proposed method...|$|E
40|$|Negative {{energy balance}} (NEB) {{during the first}} weeks {{postpartum}} is associated with infertility in dairy cows. A meta-analysis approach was used to investigate the association between prepartum energy feeding regimen, productive parameters, health, and reproductive performance. Days to conception (DTC) {{was used as the}} dependent variable to assess reproductive performance. The database was developed from 7 experiments completed in our group from 1993 to 2010. Individual data for 408 cows (354 multiparous and 54 primiparous) were included in the analysis. The net energy for lactation (NEL) intake was determined from each cowâ€™s average dry matter intake (DMI) and calculated dietary NEL density. Treatments were applied prepartum and were classified as either controlled energy (CE) or high energy (HE) diets fed during the far-off (FO) or <b>close-up</b> (<b>CU)</b> dry periods. Cow was the experimental unit. All analyses were carried out using SAS 9. 2 (SAS Institute, Inc.). The Cox proportional hazard model revealed a significant difference in DTC between HE and CE during the CU period (median = 167 and 157 d; hazard ratio (HR) = 0. 696). Cows fed HE diets during the last 4 wk prepartum lost more body condition score (BCS) in the first 6 wk postpartum than those fed C...|$|E
