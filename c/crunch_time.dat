5|$|Numerous {{tensions}} {{within the}} team and from publisher 2K Games continued during the development process. According to LeBreton, Levine was distrustful {{of some of the}} more egotistical newer hires and was often arguing with them to enforce his vision of BioShock. 2K Games was concerned with the growing budget for the title, and told Levine to market the title more as a first-person shooter rather than the first-person shooter/role player game hybrid they set out for. Near the targeted release date, Levine ordered the team into round-the-clock development, creating more strife in the team. Paul Hellquist, the game's lead designer, was often omitted from key design meetings, which he later recounted was due to his contrary nature to Levine, questioning several of his choices; he used his frustration to put into the design efforts for the Medical Pavilion level that {{he was in charge of}} at that time.

Barangay Ginebra then renewed its historic battle with fourth-seeded Alaska Aces in the quarterfinals. This was a rematch between the two teams that tangled in the semifinals of the 2009 Philippine Cup. Alaska took a 2–0 lead. Diamon Simpson powered {{his way to a}} 20–20 game in the first game and Barangay Ginebra as the Aces topped the Kings, 76–72, in the opener of this quarterfinals. In game 2 Alaska showed poise at <b>crunch</b> <b>time.</b> The Aces came up with big plays down the stretch while the Kings could not, enabling the Aces to escape with an 84–82 win.

Eric Menk and import Chris Daniels provided scoring but their backcourt were again invisible, with Mark Caguioa, Willie Miller, Mike Cortez, and Jayjay Helterbrand struggling in the game.

Not one but several Kings heeded the call and resulted in a 91–87 win over the Alaska Aces that kept the Kings' hope for the quarterfinals series. J.C. Intal, who came off the bench exploded for 20 points, delivering what Mark Caguioa and Wille Mller could not while providing both inspiration and boost to the team’s cause of eluding Alaska’s broom. The Kings forced a rubber match when they got balanced scoring from their roster with a 94–90 win over Alaska in Game 4. J.C. Intal and Ronald Tubid hit consecutive three-pointers in the final three minutes while Sunday Salvacion came through with the game-sealing free throws with 2.6 seconds left in Game 4. Ginebra failed to win the quarterfinal series with a heartbreaking 91–93 loss with Aces. In game 5, Tenorio drilled a difficult triple at the buzzer which seemed enough to propel the Aces to a victory and erected a six-point lead, 90–84, with just 2:15 left in the match. Willie Miller scored on a layup off a broken play as Ginebra cut the Alaska lead to four 90–86 with 1:27 to go in the game. Miller then followed up a missed layup by his teammate to push Ginebra even closer, 90–88, with 31 seconds left. Eric Menk then intercepted a long pass by Simpson, grabbing the ball at midcourt then zipped the ball over to an open Jayjay Helterbrand who drilled a three-pointer as the Kings pulled ahead of Alaska, 90–91, with 28 seconds left. But Ginebra, unable to pull a tough defensive play, when Diamon Simpson scored from underneath to push Alaska ahead for good, 92–91, with just 5 seconds left to play.

Cataloged from PDF version of Internship report. Includes bibliographical references (page 48). The principal reason of banks chartered {{by the government and}} the central bank is to make loans to their customers. Banks are expected to support their communities with an adequate supply of credit for all legitimate business and consumer financial needs and to price that credit reasonably in line with competitively determined interest rates. Indeed, making loans is the principal economic function of banks to fund consumption and investment spending by businesses, individuals, and units of government. How well a bank performs its function has {{a great deal to do}} with the economic health of fits region, because banking performance support the growth of new businesses and jobs within the banks trade territory and promote economic vitality. Moreover, bank loans often seem to convey positive information to the marketplace about a borrower’s credit quality, enabling a borrower to obtain more and perhaps somewhat cheaper funds from other sources. Therefore, evaluating BRAC Bank Limited’s financial performance by comparing it with that of the best performing commercial banks of Bangladesh. As the competition is increasing, the commercial Banks are constantly looking for scope to develop credit operation and performance appraisal to the market. However tight control on the part of the Central Bank, Bangladesh Bank restricts the scope for maneuvering in the market with new performance and credit operation. Therefore, bank require finding out untapped market space for growth. Moreover, in these liquidity <b>crunch</b> <b>times,</b> it is crucial for banks to be able to perform efficiently and effectively. If the bank is not being able to perform than the bank might go bankrupt which would have a significant impact on the economy. Mohd Samin MukhterB. Business Administratio...|$|R

40|$|This article {{addresses}} {{issues of}} accommodation and time {{with respect to}} the American worker <b>time</b> <b>crunch</b> problem. On the former issue, I concur in Professor Arnow-Richman 2 ̆ 7 s observation that an accommodation approach to addressing the competing pressures of work and family is prone to resistance from the courts. Experience under the ADA illustrates a judicial reluctance to go beyond a traditional equal treatment view of discrimination to embrace a more affirmative different treatment model of discrimination. But {{this does not mean that}} the ADA 2 ̆ 7 s reasonable accommodation framework has been a failure. To the contrary, while the reasonable accommodation requirement may have fallen somewhat short of expectations on the substantive law front, it has launched a procedural revolution in fostering an interactive process by which employers and employees cooperatively work to identify suitable workplace accommodations. The impact of this procedural device is not as readily noticeable as the courts 2 ̆ 7 substantive law limitations, but it may serve as the ADA 2 ̆ 7 s most significant contribution to this point. Turning to the second issue, American workers, quite simply, do not have enough time to tend to caregiving and other non-work needs. While this is a particularly acute problem for caregivers, the American worker <b>time</b> <b>crunch</b> is a problem of pandemic proportions. American workers of all stripes are required or pressured to spend ever-increasing amounts of time at work. The ADA model represents one possible format for accommodating non-work time demands. The first decade of experience under the ADA suggests that judicial and employer resistance would temper the substantive law advances of such an approach without necessarily conferring the procedural advantages of the ADA 2 ̆ 7 s interactive process. A more specific legislative approach is preferable. Given the pervasive nature of the American worker <b>time</b> <b>crunch</b> problem, a broad legislative solution is in order. This article suggests one possible approach in the form of a proposed amendment to the FMLA that would enable employees to take paid leave for two of FMLA 2 ̆ 7 s twelve-week leave period financed in a manner similar to that used for unemployment compensation purposes. The proposal also would permit employers to opt out of the new mandate by providing a minimum of four weeks of leave per year that may be taken by employees for care, sickness, or personal leave/vacation purposes...|$|R
