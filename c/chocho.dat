Daniel Brinton's classification of 1891 added Matlatzinca and Chichimeca Jonaz to Pimentel's Oto-Pamean group (which wasn't known by that name then), and he reclassified some languages of the previously included languages of the Oaxacan group. In 1920 Walther Lehmann included the Chiapanec–Mangue languages and correctly established the major subgroupings of the Oaxacan group. And in 1926 Schmidt coined the name Otomi–Mangue for a group consisting of the Oto-Pamean languages and Chiapanec–Mangue. The Oto-Pamean group and the Main Oaxacan group were not joined together into one family until Sapir's classification in 1929, where it was included in the Hokam family.|$|E

Therefore, this paper intends to find if <b>chochos</b> production {{have the potential}} to increase farmers revenue and contribute to food security if it replaces maize and soybeans, while assuming three scenarios for <b>chochos</b> production that influence farmers revenue. If so, how would it affect the land use change in terms of food security? A gross margin calculation with three scenarios—current, double and triple revenue—for <b>chochos</b> was compared with maize and soybeans gross margin. Then, a land use analysis throughout yields, crude protein and energy differences. Finally, a narrative literature review to highlight cost-benefits and barriers for <b>chochos.</b> As a result, the current revenue for <b>chochos</b> and if it doubles, demonstrates there would be less income for farmers. However, if revenue triples, farmers would earn more money and contribute towards food security if replacing maize. In contrast, if replacing soybeans, food security is not improved since yield performance for this crop is better than <b>chochos.</b> Even though, <b>chochos</b> would not produce more protein or energy than soybeans in the near future, research has shown that the negative aspects of soybeans such as GM seeds, could give a reason for <b>chochos</b> to become a better alternative for the future.

40|$|Uma pequena porcentagem de frutos sem sementes é comum às plantas de tôdas as variedades de Coffea arabica, parecendo tratar-se de um fenômeno puramente fisiológico. No café Mundo Novo porém, além dêste tipo de plantas, há outras com elevada porcentagem de lojas vazias ("chochos"). Constituindo isto um grave defeito para uma variedade comercial, procurou-se estudar a sua causa. As observações feitas no processo da microsporogênese mostraram irregularidades na distribuição dos cromossômios. Sendo encontradas tanto nas plantas de alta porcentagem como nas de baixa porcentagem de <b>chochos,</b> não deve residir nessas anomalias a causa procurada. Em estudos comparativos dos dois tipos de plantas do Mundo Novo e da variedade bourbon, pôde-se verificar : a) que, em linhas gerais, o processo da formação do saco embrionário e o desenvolvimento do endosperma e do embrião são idênticos, havendo um ligeiro atrazo para as plantas Mundo Novo; b) que nestas últimas existem anormalidades diversas no saco embrionário, em proporção muito mais elevada do que no bourbon. Ocorrendo com igual freqüência nos dois tipos de plantas do café Mundo Novo, estas anormalidades também não devem se relacionar com a formação de <b>chochos.</b> Estudos realizados em frutos de diversas idades, permitiram relacionar a alta freqüência de lojas vazias com o aparecimento de uma estrutura anormal, em forma de disco, encontrada no {{interior}} dos restos de perisperma. Êste "disco" (com cêrca de 3 mm de diâmetro) só apareceu na planta de alta freqüência de <b>chochos,</b> não tendo sido constatado na planta Mundo Novo de baixa freqüência de <b>chochos,</b> nem na planta bourbon. O exame citológico revelou que essa estrutura é constituida de endosperma, contendo um embrião anormal; de côr clara a princípio, torna-se pardacenta à medida que degenera; recebeu a denominação de "endosperma discóide". De oito plantas examinadas a seguir, encontrou-se endosperma discóide nas quatro que produzem alta porcentagem de lojas sem sementes, o que permitiu classificar as plantas Mundo Novo em duas categorias : 1) plantas onde ocorre o "disco"; 2) plantas nas quais o "disco" não ocorre. A alta freqüência de <b>chochos</b> nessa variedade está, pois, condicionada à presença do endosperma discóide. Os autores sugerem uma hipótese genética para explicar êsse novo fenômeno : plantas de alta freqüência de <b>chochos</b> são heterozigotas para um par de fatores, que na condição duplamente recessiva têm ação letal; como conseqüência, há paralização do endosperma no início do seu desenvolvimento, e, em seu lugar, é encontrado o "disco". The {{occurrence of}} {{a small number of}} fruits with empty locules is common for all varieties of Coffea arabica L. and seems to be a physiological phenomenon. Many plants of the Mundo Novo coffee, however, show a high degree of this abnormality. Since this character is undesirable in a commercial variety, a cytological investigation was undertaken to determine its cause. The microsporogenesis in a plant of Mundo Novo coffee with high percentage of empty fruits presented irregularities in the anaphasic distribution of chromosomes; the same irregularities were found in a plant of the same variety that showed low percentage of empty fruits. The frequency of anaphasic disturbances in both was higher, however, than that in a Bourbon plant. A certain degree of abnormalities was present {{in the development of the}} embryo-sac of the same two plants of Mundo Novo. These abnormalities are not commonly found in Bourbon plants. The study of fruits at different ages revealed that in the plant with a high percentage of empty fruits, the increase in the number of these was due to an arrest in the endosperm development at a certain stage, leading to the formation {{of a small}}, disc-shaped endosperm. This "discoid endosperm" did not occur in fruits of the Mundo Novo plant that showed low percentage of empty locules, nor in fruits of the Bourbon plants. The development of the endosperm in four other plants of Mundo Novo coffee that showed high frequency of empty locules and in four plants with low frequency of this abnormality was also compared. Again, the "discs" or the "discoid endosperms" were found only in plants with high frequency of empty locules. Also, they accounted for the excess in number of empty locules when plants of the two groups were compared. The present observations indicate that the high number of empty fruits found in certain plants of Mundo Novo coffee is not an increase in frequency of a phenomenon which normally occurs in coffee. It results from an independent and abnormal process that induces an arrest in the endosperm development at a definite stage and reduces it to a characteristic disc shape. It is suggested that the process leading to the formation of disc-shaped endosperm is genetically controlled by a recessive gene d. Plants that show "discoid endosperm" are heterozygous Dd, and the double recessive condition is lethal. Consequently, the development of endosperm of the condition ddd is arrested in the initial stages and a disc is formed in its place. Normal plants are homozygous DD...|$|R

40|$|Dados já publicados sobre produção de frutos e rendimento em sementes, de progênies do café Mundo Novo, foram reclassificados com base na existência de duas classes distintas de plantas : a) aquelas heterozigotas (Dd), em que há ocorrência de endosperma discóide e conseqüente formação de maior quantidade de frutos chochos; e b) aquelas homozigotas (DD) em que o endosperma é normal e por conseguinte os frutos são normais. Verificou-se que o peso da produção em frutos das plantas Dd é, em média, maior que o das plantas DD. A ocorrência do endosperma discóide, no entanto, acarreta um rendimento menor em sementes, para igual peso de frutos. O resultado final em peso de sementes chega a pender em favor das plantas DD, sem, no entanto, haver uma diferença estatisticamente significativa. A existência de plantas Dd nos cafezais é, portanto, prejudicial, uma vez que, para produzir mais frutos elas retiram maior quantidade de elementos minerais do solo; a maior produção exige maior mão de obra na colheita; e o pêso do produto final, café beneficiado, não é compensador, pois não é {{superior}} ao das plantas DD. As fontes de sementes são várias, atualmente; se o fornecedor não faz qualquer seleção, as plantas com o defeito tendem a diminuir; se o fornecedor, imaginando que faz seleção, escolhe as plantas aparentemente mais produtivas, o defeito aumentará na nova plantação; se o fornecedor das sementes leva em consideração a produtividade e ao mesmo tempo a não ocorrência de frutos <b>chochos,</b> a nova plantação estará pràticamente isenta do defeito. Sómente as sementes certificadas pelo Instituto Agronômico apresentam a garantia de produzir exclusivamente plantas DD. Evidence {{presented in}} previous papers indicated that {{two classes of}} plants are present in ordinary populations of Mundo Novo coffee (Coffea arabica L.) : a) heterozygotes (Dd) in which the occurrence of "discoid endosperm" {{is responsible for the}} increased number of empty fruit locules; b) homozygotes (DD) in which this abnormal type of endosperm doesn't occur and which only rarely form empty fruit locules. Fruit and seed yields, and percentage of empty locules of various progenies of Mundo Novo coffee were reported by others. These data were regrouped by the authors so as to permit a comparison of the fruit and seed yields of the two above-mentioned genetical classes of plants. The mean yield of fruits produced by Dd plants was higher than that given by DD plants. Since, however, those plants had a higher percentage of empty locule, seed yield was reduced and there was actually no statistically significant difference in the net weight of seeds produced by the two groups. The presence of Dd trees in coffee plantings is undesirable because they have to bear more fruit to produce the same amount of seed given by DD plants, thus increasing labor in harvesting and processing. There has been a great demand for Mundo Novo seed in recent years, and many coffee growers have established small plantings to produce seed. In lots planted with random unselected seed there is usually a tendency for reduction in number of plants with high percentage of empty locules (Dd) because of the usual increase in homozygosity of the populations. If, however, seed for the plantings is picked from plants that produced high yields of fruits, the frequency of plants with the defect in the plantings made with such seed will be increased. When fruit and seed yields are taken into account, and seeds from heterozygous plants are discarded, the planting for seed will be practically free of trees bearing fruits with empty locules. The examination of a small number of fruits per tree to detect presence or absence of empty locules with discoid endosperm provides a quick test for heterozygous (Dd) plants. At present only seeds from plantings certified by the Instituto Agronômico de Campinas are guaranteed to be reasonably free from possessing the factors (Dd) responsible for empty locules...|$|R
40|$|Um grupo de 67 conjuntos de cafeeiros procedentes do Departamento de Agricultura dos Estados Unidos foi recebido, em 1953, em Campinas. Destes conjuntos, 8 são oriundos da Etiópia, aí coletados por P. Sylvain, 10 de Tanganica e Quênia, porém de origem etiope, 11 correspondem a seleções da Índia, 24 de Tanganica, 10 de Quênia, 1 da Congo e 3 do Sudão². Em vista do número variável de plantas por conjunto, foram êles plantados em Campinas em dois ensaios comparativos, tendo como testemunhas linhagens selecionadas dos cultivares 'Bourbon Vermelho' 'Bourbon Amarelo' e 'Mundo Novo'. Analisaram-se o desenvolvimento dos cafeeiros, o seu vigor vegetativo, produção total de café cereja em cinco anos, tipos de sementes produzidas, tamanho das sementes do tipo chato e ocorrência de frutos com lojas sem sementes, fazendo-se referência especial aos conjuntos da Etiópia e do Sudão. Notou-se acentuada variabilidade no que {{concerne}} a êstas características nos conjuntos de procedência etiope. Assim, quanto à altura média dos cofeeifos, 8 conjuntos mostraram-se bem crescidos e 10 deram altura mais reduzida e, quanto ao vigor, apenas 5 conjuntos revelaram-se promissores. Dentre êstes, os de melhor aspecto vegetativo são o café 'Harar', 'Amfillo', 'Dalle Mixed' e 'Dilla' e, o pior deles, o 'Ennarea'. Os três conjuntos do Sudão não apresentam bom aspecto vegetativo. Quanto à produção, os conjuntos 'Harar', 'Tafari Kela', 'Gimma Tana, 'Amfillo', 'Dilla & Alghe' mostraram-se produtivos, enquanto o 'Ennarea', 'Mattu', 'Gimma Galla Sidamo', 'Gimma Mbuni' deram as piores produções dos ensaios, indicando a sua falta de adaptação ao nosso meio. Também os cafés do Sudão mostraram-se pouco produtivos. O conjunto 'Harar', além de ter produção comparável ao melhor testemunha do ensaio, encerro algumas plantas com maturação dos frutos tardia, de certo interêsse no plano de melhoramento. Notou-se também acentuada variação no comportamento das seleções do Quênia e Tanganica, mostrando-se algumas promissoras e outras reduzidas. Quase todas as seleções da Índia, ao contrário, comportaram-se mal. As porcentagens de semente do tipo chato revelaram-se abaixo de 80 por cento em 9 dos 18 conjuntos da Etiópia e apenas os cultivares 'Harar', 'Dalle Mixed' e 'Erithean Moca' deram quantidades maiores destas sementes. Os três conjuntos do Sudão deram porcentagem abaixo de 80. As do tipo moca atingiram porcentagens elevadas, acima de 15 por cento, em 14 dos 18 conjuntos, enquanto as do tipo concha são em quantidades normais em 15 conjuntos, sendo mais elevadas no café 'Ennaera' e 'Dilla'. Os três conjuntos do Sudão têm elevada quantidade de sementes do tipo moca e baixa quantidade de sementes do tipo concha. O tamanho dos grãos do tipo chato mostrou-se favorável em cinco conjuntos, sendo que o 'Harar' tem peneira das mais altas. Os dados mostraram que o aproveitamento dêste material da Etiópia poderá ser feito sòmente mediante seleção para tipos de sementes normais. O conjunto da Índia revelaram-se os menos promissores no que se refere às porcentagens de sementes do tipo chato. A constatação da ocorrência de plantas com elevada quantidade de frutos <b>chochos,</b> sem sementes, mostrou que o defeito ocorre em alguns conjuntos da Etiópia, Tanganica, Quênia e particulamente na Índia. A análise morfológica efetuada indicou que os conjuntos 'Harar', 'Gimma Tana', 'Ennaera', 'Tafari Kela', 'Agaro' e 'Gimma Mbuni' devem constituir variedades botânicas novas e que os cafés 'Harar', 'Tafari Kela', 'Amfillo', 'Dilla' e 'Dilla & Alghe' são promissores, podendo de ser utilizados no plano de melhoramentos em execução em Campinas. After a {{very thorough}} quarantine examination, the Plant Introduction Division of U. S. Department of Agriculture sent to Campinas, in 1953, 67 groups of coffee seedlings, developed from seeds obtained in various African coffee regions and from India. Eight {{out of the}} 67 groups of seedlings come directly from Etiópia, where they were collected by Sylvain; 10 from Tanganyka and Kenya but of Ethiopian origin; 16 from selected strains of India, 24 from Tanganyika, 10 from Kenya, 3 from Sudan and 1 from Congo. Two experiments to study the yield variability of these groups, were established with these seedlings in Campinas using selected strains of the cultivars 'Mundo Novo', 'Bourbon Amarelo' and 'Bourbon Vermelho', for yield comparison. The groups from Ethiopia reacted very differently to our condition. From these 18 groups, 8 revealed good average plant height and 10 groups showed very poor development. The groups introduced are not well adapted since only 'Harar', 'Amfillo', 'Dalle Mixed' and 'Dilla' presented good vegetative vigor. The 'Ennarea' group was the weakest. All three groups from Sudan have not developed well in Campinas. The analysis of the total weight of cherries produced {{in the last five}} years pointed out that among the Ethiopian groups 'Harar', 'Tafari Kela', 'Gimma Tana' 'Amfillo' and 'Dilla & Alghe' are good yielders, white the 'Ennarea', 'Mattu', 'Gimma Gallo Sidamo' and 'Gimma Mbuni', had the lowest yields in the experiments. Besides being a high yielder, the 'Harar' group contains a few late maturing plants which are of interest to our coffee breeding program. The group of Sudan gave very poor yield. Considerable variation was also observed among the selections from Tonganyka and Kenya, a few of them being promising due to the high yield. Most of the Indian selections are very poor yielders. Percentages of flat beans lower than 80 per cent, were found in 9 of the 18 Ethiopian groups, the 'Harar', 'Dalle Mixed' and 'Erithreon Moca' being the only groups with a good percentage of these normal beans. Peaberry type of seeds in proportion higher than 15 per cent were observed in 14 of the 18 Ethiopian groups, while the percentage of the abnormal elephant-beans (shell beans) is higher only in the groups 'Ennarea' and 'Dilla'. The three groups from Sudan gave low flat bean percentages and high amount of peaberry type of seeds. The size of the flat beans is considered good in 5 of the 18 groups, the 'Harar' group having large normal flat seeds. The plants of Ethiopion origin must be submitted to an intensive selection for high percentage of large flat beans, before being used in our coffee breeding program. The Indian groups are the least promising ones, having given very low flat bean percentages. The incidence of plants possessing high number of cherries with empty locules indicated the occurrence of this seed defect in coffee plants from Ethiopia, Tanganyika, Kenya and particularly from India. Differences in the morphological characteristics of the Ethiopian coffee pointed out that at least the 'Harar', 'Gimmo Tana', 'Ennarea', 'Tafari Kela', 'Agoro', and 'Gimma Mbuni', may be considered as new botanical varieties of Coffea arabica. The 'Harar', 'Tafari Kela', 'Amfillo', 'Dilla' and 'Dilla & Alghe' are promising material for breeding purposes. Some of their representatives can be used directly in the development of new progenies or in hybridization with coffee strains, which have been selected in Campinas...|$|R
