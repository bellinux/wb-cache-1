The questions at issue were how the <b>County</b> <b>Administrative</b> <b>Court</b> handles the prerequisites regarding 2 § LVU verdicts, how the <b>County</b> <b>Administrative</b> <b>Court</b> proceeds when evaluating evidence in 2 § LVU verdicts, and how the <b>County</b> <b>Administrative</b> <b>Court</b> handles indications of that a child is living in an honor-related context. To answer this, five verdicts have been analyzed. In addition to this, two interviews were made as a complement. In the analysis of the collected material, the authors proceeded from a theory of evidence and used a hermeneutic method for the analysis. Through the study, it has been observed that the court doesn’t seem to use any verified method to evaluate evidence. Further on, the results show that the court, in their verdicts, seems to prefer to assign to the most general prerequisite in the actual paragraph and doesn’t refer or even mention honor in the verdicts. The authors believe these circumstances make it difficult for the parties in the lawsuit to understand how the court has reached its judgement...|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{deals with}} the question of the child´s legal status in legal proceedings concerning its own person. Special problems that may arise in investigations concerning the situation of the child and in decisions on measures to be taken {{in the best interest of}} the child are also examined. The Care of Young Persons Act (1990 : 52) constitutes the framework of this study. According to the Act, the <b>County</b> <b>Administrative</b> <b>Court</b> shall, upon application by the social welfare board, decide whether the conditions for statutory care are fulfilled. The law should act as a means of legal protection for exposed children and young persons. The function of the judicial process is to materialize that protection. The thesis examines this function of the law. Three basic demands according to international conventions and Swedish legislation consitute the startingpoint of the work: the child´s right to legal security, the right to personal integrity and the right to successively increasing autonomy. One of the aims of this work is to examine whether the procedural framework for statutory care proceedings according to the Care of Young Persons Act and the practical application of this framework actually satisfy these three demands. Another aim of the study is to describe, at a more theoretical level, the characteristics and special problems in respect of the child´s role in legal proceedings concerning itself. The Swedish legislation is compared with corresponding regulations in Norway and England. An empiricial study based on 390 judgments from the year 1998 in four County Administrative Courts in Sweden concerning statutory care demonstrates how the rules have been applied in practice...|$|E

40|$|According to Swedish tax legislation, {{investment}} {{funds are}} taxed differently depending on if the are Swedish or foreign. The {{difference between the}} investment funds lies within the taxation of received dividends {{and the opportunity to}} shift the liability of tax of received dividends on to the funds shareholders. This measure is only available to Swedish funds. The question in this thesis is whether this difference is discriminatory against foreign investors and therefore constitutes a forbidden restriction against the free movement of capital stated in article 63 EUF Treaty. The European Court of Justice (ECJ) has given several preliminary rulings on this type of legislation and its compatibility with the principle of free movement of capital. It is not compatible with the free movement according to the court. The reason is that the consequence of the legislation is less attractive for foreign investment funds because the taxation on received dividends, which leads to less dividends to shareholders. This national measure is therefore a forbidden restriction against the free movement of capital. The Swedish legislation has not been under such ruling from the ECJ, but it can be tested based on ECJ other rulings on the matter. The Swedish legislation has been tested in the domestic <b>county</b> <b>administrative</b> <b>court,</b> (Länsrätten i Dalarnas Län), who concluded that the legislation was discriminatory. They based their reasoning on ECJ case law. However it has been stated within the treaty and from ECJ case law, that measures which has the result of a restriction can be justified as long the national rule is not discriminatory. The national rule on received dividends is discriminatory as it hinders investment funds to invest capital were they like and prevents Swedish companies from obtaining foreign capital. Based on ECJ reasoning on the matter of tax upon received dividends for foreign investment funds and the aim of free movement of capital the Swedish legislation constitute a restriction against the free movement of capital. This restriction is discriminatory. On those grounds the legislation is no longer compatible with EU-law and a change in the legislation of taxation on received dividends is necessary in order to obtain the requirements EU has on the member states...|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis is}} about the social services’ {{investigations}} into childrens need of protection and support. The principal purpose is, from a critical perspective, to analyse and discuss how the legally-accorded procedural directives for the execution of an investigation, and therein the integrated support and counselling work, are adapted in the social services’ actual investigation work {{in relation to the}} parents. The issue is illustrated through an in-depth analysis of three case documents as a basis for an application in the <b>county</b> <b>administrative</b> <b>court</b> for compulsory care in 1997. For analytical purposes two elements are distinguished: 1) The investigation as part of a decision process constitutes an argumentation process which affects how the family’s problems and the child’s need of care may be defined. 2) The investigation as part of a counselling process constitutes a social intervention which affects the parents’ capacity to act as parents and individuals. The study is looked at from a socio-constructionist perspective which concerns itself with how the law is applied in the interaction between the executor of the law and the individual in daily reality, as well as an analytical method which considers various social factors’ significance {{in the way in which}} the law is actually applied. The analysis is based on two premises: 1) The investigator is placed in a rhetorical situation and must formulate his/her argumentation in the investigation in such a way as to be able to influence the court to decide in favour of the investigator’s standpoint. 2) The parents are placed at a disadvantage since the investigator has control over both the counselling resources and means for coercion and the investigation’s structure, content and information flow. The analysis demonstrates that the investigator’s power of authority is used repressively against the parents. This may be seen not least in the form of a suppression of the parents’ own definitions of the problem and suggestions for solving this problem, a biased focusing on the negative aspects of the parents as well as, by classifying the parents as either “treatable” or “untreatable”, an exclusion of certain parents from means of support and counselling. The results illustrate the need for a legal reinforcement of the parents’ position in the investigation. Yet the repression is also partly linked to a standardised range of measures which do not allow for tailor-made solutions to the complex cases often involved, and partly insufficient material resources which necessitate a system of priorities wherein the most resource-demanding parents are excluded from the procedural system. Consequently, if the social services are to be able to carry out the investigations according to the legislative aims, then they must also receive the necessary resources...|$|E

Syftet är att med utgångspunkt från socialsekreterare och klienter få fördjupad kunskap om hur den utredande processen vid ansökan om LVM-vård uppfattas, tiden på LVM-institutionen och efter avslutad vistelse. Ett annat syfte är att fokusera på meningsskapande {{processer}} mellan socialsekreterare och klienter i LVM - situationen. I LVM-processen uppstår olika positioner mellan socialsekreterare och klient vilket speglar aktörernas interaktion i den givna situationen. A {{large part}} of the social work with drug abusers is carried out within the social services in Sweden. This is mostly based on voluntary treatment. An important aspect of the work is to motivate the substance abuser to stop the addiction and to change their life situation. In the Swedish welfare system, compulsory treat-ment is used in specific situations in the treatment of substance abusers and is regulated by the Care of Alcoholics and Drug Abuser Act (LVM, 1988 : 870). De-cisions concerning compulsory treatment are to be taken when the substance abuser has a need for care, which cannot be provided by the Social Welfare Act or in any other way. The social services apply to the <b>county</b> <b>administrative</b> <b>court</b> for a care order, and the court decides in accordance with the statutory provi-sions. When the social worker decides to apply for a care order, an investigation is conducted that includes both social and medical aspects. The aim {{of this study is to}} understand and interpret how social workers and substance abusers experience the investigation process for a care order, the time spent at the LVM-institution and after discharge. Another aim is to focus how processes of meaning are shaped within the interaction between social workers and clients. The investigation group consisted of 13 social workers and 10 sub-stance abusers who had been subjected to the process and investigation for applying for a care order. The interview was semi- structured and focused on the different stages in the LVM-process and the relationship between the social worker and the client during the investigation period. All interviews were tape recorded and transcribed to text. The material is analysed by Collins' concept of situation, which also is the main theoretical standpoint. The study shows how the situation is experienced by social workers and substance abusers through the in-vestigation process, being taken in to custody, the stay at the LVM-institution and the different positions taken by the actors during this process. The LVM-situation contains a combination of factors; the addiction, the sub-stance abusers’ life situation, the knowledge that the social services have about the client, the social workers’ values and knowledge and the administrative conditions. How these conditions work together and are assessed will vary depending on the interaction and relationship between social worker and client. The proc-esses of meaning that are created in the relationship between the social worker and client is analysed and theoretically interpreted. These processes create different kinds of meaning for the coercive intervention...|$|E

40|$|In this dissertation, I {{explore a}} quite unique legal situation, namely <b>administrative</b> <b>court</b> {{hearings}} relating to coercive interventions: the Care of Young Persons Act (LVU), Care of Abusers (Special Provisions) Act (LVM), and the Compulsory Psychiatric Care Act (LPT). There are three central participatory {{roles in the}} court hearings: The official party is the authority who files the application for coercive intervention – either a chief psychiatrist or a social welfare board (typically represented by a social worker or sometimes a lawyer assisted by a social worker), whereas the citizen party is the person about whom the application is brought. The citizen party is represented by a legal representative. The professionals represent two different logics: therapeutic and judicial. The purpose of this dissertation has been to study the tension between therapeutic and judicial logic in court hearings relating to compulsory care. With theoretical concepts from Scott (1995) and Wetherell & Potter (1998), {{it is possible to}} say that the therapeutic and judicial logics are built up by institutional elements that are communicated through interpretative repertoires. Three questions are central: 1. How do professional participators handle the different role expectations embedded in therapeutic and judicial logic? In this case, I am particularly interested in role conflicts faced by social workers and psychiatrists. 2. How do different institutional elements (regulative, normative/cognitive) play out in the court hearings? 3. To what extent can these court hearings be considered a scrutinizing order of discourse, where the arguments of official party are subjected to critical examination? In my analysis I am inspired by both critical discourse analysis and organizational theory, more precisely, new institutionalism. These two perspectives provide useful insights and make it possible to combine the micro- and macro levels in the analysis. Data for the analysis consist of 43 court hearings and 31 interviews, gathered from two different <b>county</b> <b>administrative</b> <b>courts</b> in Sweden. All written documents used and produced by the courts are also part of our data. The dissertation consists of five studies that indicate that the court hearings hardly can be described as a scrutinising order of discourse. In spite of this, the court constantly finds that the legal criteria for coercive intervention are satisfied. Neither the official party nor the legal representative argue according to a judicial logic. Instead, therapeutic logic dominates the order of discourse. When the arguments for compulsory care are therapeutic, they are not explicitly related to the criteria in the law. In my interpretation, the reason why the conflict between therapeutic and judicial logic is not realised {{can be found in the}} existence of a logic of normalisation. This ideological logic of normalisation can be found in most of the institutions in the Swedish society and are built on the idea of traditional welfare norms...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the {{question}} of how Swedish society responds when juveniles commit crimes. The concepts “treatment”/”goal-rational decision- making” and “correction”/ “norm-rational decision-making” is used to illustrate either the social services’ or the police/attorneys’ work. The focus of the study is social work co-operating with the legal system and the interaction between these two. The aim {{of this study is to}} make visible and analyse factors, juridical and non-juridical, that affect the choice between treatment and correction of juveniles in an emergency situation, when there is a necessity to choose between immediate preventative custody on the one hand, and detention on the other. This study analyses the selection through outcome patterns, based on different factors. Theoretically this thesis is based on six concepts. At first there are system and practice, and secondly there are treatment and correction. Together they form a model where the actors on this juvenile field can be situated. The strategies of the actors’ decision-making are implied by either norm-rational decision-making or goal-rational decision-making. The actors are the social services, the police and the attorney, and <b>county</b> <b>administrative</b> <b>courts</b> and district courts. Empirical data is studied through records of immediate custody and detention of juveniles aged 15 - 18 years old. The immediate denial of freedom represents, in the Swedish legislation, a process whereby social services and law enforcers meet and decide whether to treat or correct the juvenile. This selection is the focus of the empirical study of this thesis. In 1992, 1998 and 2003 a national overall survey was made of all juveniles aged 15 - 18 years that have been either in immediate custody or in detention or both. The data comprises 526 juveniles and acts. Documentation was obtained from the <b>courts</b> (<b>administrative</b> and public <b>court</b> of law) to form the material of the study. For a more deepened understanding this quantitative study was complemented with a qualitative study of the decisions. The results show that the general denial of freedom of juveniles have increased greatly during the years 1992, 1998 and 2003, and especially from 1998 to 2003. Almost all of the acts concern boys, even though girls are making at break-through in 2003. There are differences between the groups that either have been in detention or in immediate custody in ways of, “survey-year” “ethnic background”, “age” and “categorising of crime”. The differences are found in variables which can be seen as both juridical and non-juridical factors. The major increase in detention during the final year of the survey also shows that with regard to social work and law as separate systems and practices there is no functional interaction, since legislation (as well as social services) advocate immediate custody, when a serious crime is related to a youth. The results show that it is obvious that there are non-juridical factors, such as “ethnic background” that have impact on the selection; this requires further studies. This also invokes legal security on the agenda. This study also shows a large discrepancy between legislation and the legal practice. The results give strong incentive for further studies in this field, and also highlights the need for developing methods within social work, defining the social worker as a law-practising non-juridical profession. This study also emphasises the need of developing a legislative construction that is consistent and useful in the field, since a large discrepancy undermines the legitimacy and the legitimate demands of society...|$|R
