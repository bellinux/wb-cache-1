40|$|Abstract—Public {{interest}} on the thermal comfort of subway cabin is increasing, since more than 90 % of the complaints from passengers are about the thermal discomfort. Some passengers may feel hot, while the others may feel cold even in the same cabin due to the uneven temperature distribution in the cabin. For this reason, the temperature difference in the cabin should be as small as possible. In our present study, the effect of air mixing on <b>the</b> temperature <b>inside</b> <b>the</b> <b>subway</b> cabin during heating was studied by using a climatic chamber. Ambient temperature was set at around – 20 °C, and the heaters of cabin were operated. Thermocouples were installed <b>inside</b> <b>the</b> cabin, and the temperature of each point was monitored.
