2500|$|For a neuron at rest, {{there is}} a high {{concentration}} of sodium and <b>chlorine</b> <b>ions</b> in the extracellular fluid compared to the intracellular fluid while {{there is a}} high concentration of potassium ions in the intracellular fluid compared to the extracellular fluid. This concentration gradient along with potassium leak channels present on the membrane of the neuron causes an [...] of potassium ions making the resting potential close to EK≈–75mV. The depolarization opens both the sodium and potassium channels in the membrane, allowing the ions to flow {{into and out of the}} axon, respectively. [...] If the depolarization is small (say, increasing Vm from −70mV to −60mV), the outward potassium current overwhelms the inward sodium current and the membrane repolarizes back to its normal resting potential around −70mV.However, if the depolarization is large enough, the inward sodium current increases more than the outward potassium current and a runaway condition (positive feedback) results: the more inward current there is, the more Vm increases, which in turn further increases the inward current. A sufficiently strong depolarization (increase in Vm) causes the voltage-sensitive sodium channels to open; the increasing permeability to sodium drives Vm closer to the sodium equilibrium voltage ENa≈ +55mV. [...] The increasing voltage in turn causes even more sodium channels to open, which pushes Vm still further towards ENa. [...] This positive feedback continues until the [...] sodium channels are fully open and Vm is close to ENa. The sharp rise in Vm and sodium permeability correspond to the rising phase of the action potential.|$|E
