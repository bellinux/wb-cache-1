5|$|Solitary and nocturnal, {{the common}} torpedo spends much time {{resting on the}} sea floor, often buried in sediment. It is an ambush {{predator}} that pounces onto prey and stuns them with electricity, the process taking {{only a fraction of}} a second. Once the prey is immobilized, it is manipulated to the mouth with motions of the disc, and swallowed whole. Adults feed almost entirely on small benthic bony fishes, including soles, herring, mullet, gobies, goatfishes, porgies, dragonets, and jack mackerels. Large decapod crustaceans are a minor secondary food source, while very rarely skates may be consumed. Juveniles are less exclusively piscivorous than the adults and feed on a variety of invertebrates as well. The most significant prey species differ between seasons and geographic regions. For example, in the Tyrrhenian Sea, juvenile <b>common</b> <b>sole</b> (Solea solea) are by far the most important prey item in autumn and winter, but in spring and summer they become less available and other fishes figure more prominently in the ray's diet. Known parasites of this species include the tapeworm Phyllobothrium lactuca, and the monogeneans Amphibdella paronaperugiae and Amphibdelloides benhassinae.|$|E
2500|$|As oxygen levels decrease, fish may {{at first}} {{increase}} movements {{in an attempt}} to escape the hypoxic zone, but eventually they greatly reduce their activity levels, thus reducing their energetic (and therefore oxygen) demands. Atlantic herring show this exact pattern. Other examples of fishes that reduce their activity levels under hypoxia include the <b>common</b> <b>sole,</b> the guppy, the small-spotted catshark, and the viviparous eelpout. [...] Some sharks that ram-ventilate their gills may understandably increase their swimming speeds under hypoxia, to bring more water to the gills.|$|E
50|$|Solea aegypitiaca is a dextral {{flatfish}} with on oval {{body shape}} which is brownish grey on the eyed side, with the eyed side pectoral fin being largely coloured black. The left, uneyed, side is white. It {{is very similar}} to the <b>common</b> <b>sole,</b> with which it is sympatric, but the vertebrate count and fin ray count differ. S. aegyptiacus has 39-44 vertebrae to the common sole's 46-52, while the dorsal fin of S. aegyptiacus has 62-87 finrays to the common sole's 69-97 finrays, other finray counts are pectoral fin on eyed side with 7-9 to 9-10, anal finrays 51-72 compared to 53-79. The lateral line of S. aegyptiacus has 106-150 pored scales while that of the <b>common</b> <b>sole</b> has 116-165 pored scales. The eyed side pectoral fin of S.aegyptiaca also has a more extensive black blotch than that of the <b>common</b> <b>sole.</b> It tends to be slightly smaller than the <b>common</b> <b>sole</b> with a maximum length of 65 cm and an average length of 25 cm.|$|E

40|$|While {{environmentally}} extended input-output (IO) {{models are}} commonly used for capturing interactions between ecosystems and economic systems, this kind of modelling cannot reflect interactions within the ecosystem. Isard's (1968) model {{has been the only}} exception. He entered interactions occurring within the ecosystem into IO. Nevertheless, given the linearity of IO, he could only analyze environmental issues in a linear fashion. We propose an alternative that reverses Isard's model types: the economic system is modelled within the ecosystem (not the contrary), as one of the ecosystem's components. To demonstrate its feasibility, we develop an ecological-economic model by integrating conventional economic IO within system dynamics (SD). After describing the methodological issues, we “test” the IO/SD model on ecological and economic data by applying it to the destruction and restoration of the Seine Estuary, France, where <b>Common</b> <b>soles</b> live. Our model brings insight into the consideration of feedback loops in the modelling of interactions between the ecosystem and the economic system. We believe such a tool may be of help to decision makers in mixing economic and environmental issues like, in our application case, fish habitat and harbour development.
