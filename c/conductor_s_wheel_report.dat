Ker je trg vedno bolj zahteven so se v podjetju Struc odločili, da bodo dimenzije plaščev na enoosnem traktorju in pogonski prikolici enake, zato je potrebno spremeniti dimenzije plaščev na enoosnem traktorju. Ker bomo spremenili dimenzije plaščev je bilo potrebno na novo preračunati sinhron in narediti trdnostni preračun valjastih zobnikov. S pomočjo programa AuoCAD sem naredil tehnično in tehnološko dokumentacijo. Na koncu sem sinhron sestavil in naredil opis poteka montaže.

40|$|At the {{beginning}} of his last major work, Galileo tackles an old paradox, Aristotle 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Wheel,</b> in order to produce a model of the continuum that explains (at least to him) how line segments of different length could be put into a one-to-one correspondence. His argument seems like a playful digression. However, it is precisely this type of a one-to-one correspondence that he needs to support his work on free fall. In this article, we investigate how Galileo 2 ̆ 7 s model for the wheel paradox informs his work on free fall. We also examine some of the reasons his results on free fall [...] -results that were grounded in his notion of the continuum [...] -were not readily accepted in his time...|$|R

40|$|There is {{a motion}} {{of a system}} of masses that is as simple as the motion of a point mass on a {{straight}} line. It is the rotation of a rigid body about a fixed axis. For example, we live on a rotating earth, use rotating devices such as a potter 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>wheel</b> or a phonograph turntable, and test our luck with a spinning roulette wheel. All of these are objects whose motion is described by the time dependence of a single variable, the angle of rotation. We shall study the angular equivalent of uniformly accelerated motion for some rotating objects. This module also begins the study of rotational dynamics by introducing the dynamical quantities torque and angular momentum for a point mass moving in a plane...|$|R

We first discuss this approximation as applied to linear composites, i. e., to those materials {{in which there is}} a linear relation between a curl-free electric field and a divergence-free current density. We then describe extensions of this approach to random composites with cubic nonlinearities in addition to a dominant linear term, and to composites in which the components have a fluctuating conductivity (‘conductivity noise’). Finally, we mention one novel application: to conductivity noise in a random composite of normal metal (N) and perfect <b>conductor</b> (<b>S).</b> It is shown that the extension of the EMA leads to a prediction of a frequency range in which the conductivity noise has a 1 /ω frequency dependence, even if the noise in the individual components is frequency independent...|$|R

40|$|The {{success of}} the recent rover {{missions}} to Mars has {{stressed the importance of}} acquiring the maximum amount of geological information with the least amount of data possible.

These sensors, based on the previously designed, flight qualified Mars Environmental Compatibility Assessment (MECA) Electrometer, measure the static electricity (triboelectricity) generated between polymer materials and the Martian regolith during rover transverses. The sensors are capable of detecting physical changes in the soil that may not be detectable by other means, such as texture, size and moisture content. Although triboelectricity is a surface phenomenon, the weight of a rover will undoubtedly protrude the sensors below the dust covered layers, exposing underlying regolith whose properties may not be detectable through other means...|$|R
