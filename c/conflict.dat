5|$|Bertrand-Bocandé became {{involved}} in local African politics during his time as Resident. When an intertribal <b>conflict</b> led to an armed raid of Carabane, he mediated the <b>conflict.</b> In 1850, the island's economic growth was disturbed because of an extensive livestock raid which precipitated further incidents the following year. In response to this <b>conflict</b> with the former owners of Carabane, the residents of Kagnout, Bertrand-Bocandé convinced the governor of Senegal to send a warship to Carabane to frighten off the raiders. This single ship failed to faze the island's opponents, therefore Bertrand-Bocandé requested a detachment of soldiers and several other ships from the governor. When these reinforcements arrived from Gorée, the <b>conflict</b> was successfully ended. A treaty was signed on March 25, establishing the sovereignty of France not only in Casamance, but also in Kagnout and Samatit. For {{his involvement in the}} <b>conflict,</b> Bertrand-Bocandé was accepted into the Légion d'honneur and was given a land concession. Bertrand-Bocandé left the island in 1857 for a leave of absence, but he abandoned his post as Resident in 1860. His tireless activity had a lasting effect on the island.|$|E

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this study is to address the {{relation}} between task and relationship <b>conflicts</b> at work and employee well-being. It seeks to examine psychological detachment from work during off-job time as a moderator in the relation between <b>conflicts</b> and well-being. Design/methodology/approach – In a field study, 291 white-collar employees completed survey measures of task <b>conflicts,</b> relationship <b>conflicts,</b> psychological detachment from work during off-job time, and well-being. Control variables included workload and job control. Findings – Hierarchical regression analyses indicated that employees experiencing high levels of task <b>conflicts</b> and high levels of relationship <b>conflicts</b> report poorer well-being. As predicted, psychological detachment from work mitigated the negative relation between relationship <b>conflicts</b> and well-being. Contrary to expectations, psychological detachment failed to moderate the relation between task <b>conflicts</b> and well-being. Practical implications – The study suggests that employees should be encouraged to disengage mentally from work during leisure time. Originality/value – This study links research on workplace <b>conflicts</b> with research on recovery processes. It tests the moderator effect of psychological detachment from work on the association between workplace <b>conflicts</b> and well-being...|$|R

40|$|The {{main goal}} {{of this study is}} to explore whether the VISSIM {{simulation}} model and Surrogate Safety Assessment Model (SSAM) can be used to provide the reasonable estimates for pedestrian-vehicle <b>conflicts</b> at signalized intersections. Two types of pedestrian-vehicle <b>conflicts</b> are discussed in this study, including vehicle-yield-pedestrian and pedestrian-yield-vehicle. A total of 42 hours videos were recorded at seven signalized intersections for field data collection. The calibrated and validated VISSIM model was used to generate pedestrian-vehicle <b>conflicts</b> and SSAM software was used to extract these <b>conflicts</b> by processing the vehicle trajectory file from the VISSIM model. The mean absolute percent error (MAPE) was used to determine the maximum TTC and PET thresholds for pedestrian-vehicle <b>conflicts.</b> The results showed that there was a best goodness-of-fit between simulated <b>conflicts</b> and observed <b>conflicts</b> when the maximum TTC threshold was set to be 2. 7 and the maximum PET threshold was set to be 8. Moreover, the linear regression was developed to study the relationship between simulated <b>conflicts</b> from the micro-simulation and the observed <b>conflicts</b> from the field. The result indicated that there was a significant statistical relationship between the simulated <b>conflicts</b> and the observed <b>conflicts.</b> However, it was also found that the VISSIM model underestimated the pedestrian-vehicle <b>conflicts.</b> One possible reason was that the VISSIM simulation cannot generate the pedestrian-vehicle <b>conflicts</b> that involved the illegal pedestrian behaviors such as red light violation in the real world...|$|R
