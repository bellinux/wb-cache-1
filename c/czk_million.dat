40|$|The {{ecological}} value {{and the value}} of ecosystem services of the former military area in Čtyři Dvory in České Budějovice was evaluated in this thesis. The expert method of BVM (?Biotope Valuation Method?) and the Replacement Cost method (cost of technological alternative to ecosystem function) according to Seják et al. (2003, 2010) were applied. Four ecosystem services were evaluated: climatic service (evapotranspiration), little water cycle, oxygen production, and the support of biodiversity. For comparison, the sale price of the area and the ?recreation? value calculated by the contingent valuation (CV) method were also evaluated. The estimated sale price was 837 <b>million</b> <b>CZK,</b> which was by twelve-times higher than the {{ecological value}} estimated by the BVM method. Most of the area (57 %) was formed by the biotop XK 4 ? pioneer shrub vegetation of atropogenic noncultivated areas with 13 points per m 2. The most valuable biotop was V 2. 2 ? periodic waters with 44 points per m 2, which formed 1. 5 % of the examined area. The estimated value of ecosystem services was 1 372 <b>millions</b> <b>CZK</b> per year. The realization of all the planned construction projects on the examined area would lead to the depression of the ecological value according to the BVM method by 19. 5 <b>millions</b> <b>CZK</b> and the depression {{of the value of the}} formerly mentioned four ecosystem services by 459 <b>millions</b> <b>CZK...</b>|$|R
