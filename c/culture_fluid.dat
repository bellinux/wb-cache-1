50|$|Broly soon {{takes the}} upper hand and pummels Goten and Trunks. Krillin arrives in time to save Android 18, but they too are defeated. Trunks, however, lures Broly beneath a <b>culture</b> <b>fluid</b> tank and blasts it, {{showering}} Broly in the <b>culture</b> <b>fluid</b> and disintegrating him. With Broly gone, Trunks, Goten, Krillin and Android 18 evacuate the island, but Dr. Collie tells them that the <b>culture</b> <b>fluid,</b> after absorbing Broly, will continue to spread until it covers the entire Earth. However, after seeing Hercule trying to swim away from the fluid, they notice that the fluid turns to stone upon contact with seawater. Goten, Trunks and Krillin each fire a Kamehameha wave {{at the base of}} the island, causing a massive wave of water to flood the island and turn the <b>culture</b> <b>fluid</b> to stone. Just then, Broly suddenly emerges from the sea as a giant, but before he can attack, he too is solidified. Trunks and Goten blast him to smithereens, destroying him once and for all. Hercule then emerges from the sea, asking for help. Android 18 offers, but in exchange for 100 million zeni for all the help she gave him throughout the movie. Fuming, Hercule swims off.|$|E

5000|$|At the lab, Hercule and Jaguar {{come face to}} face {{after many}} years. The semi-tournament is organised, with Android 18, Goten and Trunks asking to take part, posing as Hercule's pupils. Though Trunks and Goten make quick work of the bio-warriors, they notice an old enemy of theirs beside Jaguar: the farcical shaman from Natade Village who they {{encountered}} in Broly - Second Coming. While exploring, Trunks and Goten stumble across a tank inside which appears to be Broly, the legendary Super Saiyan they defeated, apparently having survived again. They confront the shaman, who tells them that after Broly was destroyed, he found a sample of Broly's blood and took it to Jaguar, who used it to create a clone of Broly as one of his bio-warriors. Knowing of Broly's mental instability, Trunks and Goten try to destroy him before he awakens, but Broly notices Goten and his rage erupts, allowing him {{to break out of the}} tank. At the same time, this causes a major leak of a dangerous <b>culture</b> <b>fluid</b> which instantly devours any matter with a different structure to its own and multiplies. Broly is drenched in the <b>culture</b> <b>fluid</b> and deformed horribly, which turns him into the titular [...] "Bio-Broly". Jaguar orders Broly to kill Hercule, and Android 18 comes to his defence (in exchange for more money), but is easily pounded by Broly. Goten and Trunks take on Broly and are only barely able to keep up with him, but the <b>culture</b> <b>fluid</b> begins to consume the entire island, destroying the bio-warriors and killing the shaman and many scientists.|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} <b>culture</b> <b>fluids</b> from mouse {{lymphocytes}} on the antilisterial activity of normal macrophages in vitro was determined. Titers of lysates of macrophages incubated {{with or without}} <b>culture</b> <b>fluids</b> from lymphocytes from control mice had titers of 10 to 270 {{with or without a}} reducing agent, dithiothreitol. Lysates of macrophages after incubation with <b>culture</b> <b>fluids</b> of spleen lymphocytes from BCG-immunized mice had antilisterial titers with and without dithiothreitol of 197, 000 and 810, respectively.

40|$|We {{examined}} the antigenic reactivities and virion associations of glycoproteins that were {{released into the}} <b>culture</b> <b>fluids</b> of cells infected with respiratory syncytial (RS) virus. <b>Culture</b> <b>fluids</b> and cell extracts were obtained from cells 24 to 30 h after they were infected with the Long strain of RS virus. Radioimmune precipitation of [3 H]glucosamine-labelled glycoproteins by large glycoprotein (G) -specific or fusion protein (F) specific monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) revealed that the G, F 1 and F 2 proteins were present in cell extracts but only the G protein was clearly evident in <b>culture</b> <b>fluids.</b> A glycoprotein (Mr 43 K) which may be a precursor or a breakdown product of the G protein was also precipitated by the G-specific MAb from cell extracts and <b>culture</b> <b>fluids.</b> The G protein in <b>culture</b> <b>fluids</b> was slightly smaller (Mr 82 K) than the G protein in cell extracts (Mr 88 K). An abundant or heavily labelled, 18 K glycoprotein in the fluids of virus-infected but not of mock-infected cells was weakly precipitated by the F-specific MAb; this suggested that the 18 K protein shares epitopes with the fusion protein of RS virus. The absence of F 1 and F 2 polypeptides from <b>culture</b> <b>fluids</b> {{is evidence that the}} cells, which contained an abundance of these proteins, were intact...|$|R
40|$|Proteinase {{levels were}} {{assessed}} in organ <b>culture</b> <b>fluids</b> from human neonatal foreskin maintained under growth factor-free conditions {{and in the}} presence of a combination of growth factors (ie, epidermal growth factor, insulin, hydrocortisone, pituitary extract, and all-trans-retinoic acid). Analysis of <b>culture</b> <b>fluids</b> by gelatin zymography revealed the presence of 92 -kd and 72 -kd gelatinases. There was a greater amount of 92 -kd gelatinase activity {{in the presence of}} growth factors whereas the levels of 72 -kd gelatinase were similar in growth factor-free and growth factor-containing media. Experiments with keratinocytes and fibroblasts in monolayer culture and with isolated dermal tissue in organ culture indicated that the epithelial component was responsible for most of the 92 -kd gelatinase activity whereas fibroblasts were primarily responsible for the 72 -kd gelatinase activity. Activation with aminophenyl mercuric acetate, requirement for divalent cations, inhibition with EDTA, and insensitivity to inhibition with phenylmethyl sulfonyl fluoride indicated that both gelatinases were metalloproteinases. In additional studies, <b>culture</b> <b>fluids</b> were examined for the presence of plasminogen activator activity. This was detected in <b>culture</b> <b>fluids</b> from tissues maintained under both conditions but was increased in the growth factor-containing medium. The increased amount seen in the growth factor-containing medium appeared to be due almost entirely to a single factor, ie, all-trans-retinoic acid. In monolayer culture, both keratinocytes and fibroblasts produced plasminogen activator; the level was higher in keratinocyte <b>culture</b> <b>fluids</b> than in <b>culture</b> <b>fluids</b> from fibroblasts...|$|R

50|$|Biomachining is {{performed}} {{in a manner similar}} to chemical milling: the area to be cut is marked out as a negative image with an inert maskant, used to protect the areas that are not to be cut. The part is then dipped into a bath of <b>culture</b> <b>fluid,</b> which is kept at a precise temperature and stirred throughout the process. Laboratory experiments on the subject have determined that the depth of any cuts produced increases as the stirring rate increases; this depth is also affected by the temperature of the process.|$|E

40|$|Infectious tissue <b>culture</b> <b>fluids</b> of the {{majority}} of serotypes of adenovirus at low dilutions detach HeLa or KB cells from glass surfaces within a few hours after inoculation. A reproducible method for testing cell detachment was devised. The factor present in infectious tissue <b>culture</b> <b>fluids</b> and responsible for cell detachment is trypsin-sensitive and non-dialyzable; it is smaller and more resistant to the effect of heat or ultraviolet light than the infectious virus particle. Cell detachment activity was found to be temperature-dependent, and the cell-detaching titer of infectious tissue <b>culture</b> <b>fluids</b> was not affected by repeated exposure to HeLa cells. Inhibition of cell detachment by human or rabbit sera was observed only when other antibodies to adenovirus antigens were also present, but the antibody inhibiting cell detachment could not be correlated quantitatively with complement-fixing or homologous neutralizing antibody...|$|R
50|$|After {{listening}} to a talk by biologist David Baltimore and further stimulation from his virologist colleague, Robert Ting, concerning {{the work of the}} late Howard Temin, Gallo became interested in the study of retroviruses, and made their study the primary activity of his lab. In 1976, Doris Morgan, a first year post-doctoral fellow in Gallo's lab, was asked by Gallo to examine <b>culture</b> <b>fluid</b> of activated lymphocytes for the possible production of growth factors. Soon she was successful in growing T lymphocytes. Gallo, Morgan and Frank Ruscetti, another researcher in Gallo's lab, coauthored a paper in Science describing their method. The Gallo group identified this as T-cell growth factor (TCGF). The name was changed in 1978 to IL-2 (interleukin-2) by the Interlaken cytokine nomenclature committee. Although earlier reports had described soluble molecules with biologic effects, the effects and biochemistry of the factors were not well characterized. One such example was the report by Julius Gordon in 1965, which described blastogenic transformation of lymphocytes in extracellular media. However, cell growth was not demonstrated and the affected cell type was not identified, making the identity of the factor(s) involved unclear and its natural function unknown.|$|E

(Lepidoptera: Pyralidae), were examined after treatment with the <b>culture</b> <b>fluid</b> of the entomopathogenic fungus Nomuraea rileyi SH 1. When isolated hemocytes of G. mellonella were incubated with the conidia of N. rileyi in vitro, the rates of phagocytosis increased at 4 h after incubation but decreased subsequently. On the contrary, the rates of phagocytosis of isolated hemocytes decreased by 80 % after 24 h preincubation with the fungal <b>culture</b> <b>fluid</b> (1 / 200, 1 / 100 dilutions). Levels of inhibition of phagocytic activity by the <b>culture</b> <b>fluid</b> depended on dilutions used. Galleria mellonella larvae showed a peak of nodulation at 4 h after injection with conidia. The percentage of nodules in hemolymph did not decrease by preinjection with the <b>culture</b> <b>fluid,</b> whereas the percentage of nodule-containing conidia decreased, depending on the injected fluid. However, phagocytosis and nodulation in G. mellonella did not change after treatment of the <b>culture</b> <b>fluid</b> with proteinase K, indicating that the <b>culture</b> <b>fluid</b> contained proteinaceous immunosuppressive factors. Electrophoretic analysis of the <b>culture</b> <b>fluid</b> and not the fresh medium without culturing the fungus exhibited protein bands. Therefore, N. rileyi possibly secretes toxic proteins that impair cellular immune responses in G. mellonella larvae...|$|E
40|$|Punch biopsies {{of human}} skin were {{obtained}} 1 day after irradiation with two minimal-erythema doses (MED) from either a UVB light source or a Solar Simulator and incubated in organ culture for 72 h. Organ culture fluids obtained at 24, 48 and 72 h were analyzed for collagenolytic activity and for reactivity with antibodies to matrix metalloproteinase- 1 (MMP- 1; interstitial collagenase) and MMP- 13 (collagenase- 3). High levels of collagenolytic activity {{were seen in}} organ <b>culture</b> <b>fluid</b> from skin exposed to either light source. MMP- 1 was strongly induced in parallel, increasing from less than 100 ng/ml in organ <b>culture</b> <b>fluid</b> from control skin to approximately 1. 1 mg/ml in <b>culture</b> <b>fluid</b> from UV-treated skin. Whereas most of the detectable MMP- 1 in control <b>culture</b> <b>fluid</b> was represented by the latent form of the enzyme, approximately 50 % of the enzyme was present as the active form in organ <b>culture</b> <b>fluid</b> of UV-exposed skin. In contrast, there was no detectable MMP- 13 in control organ <b>culture</b> <b>fluid</b> and very little change after UV exposure (less than 100 ng/ml in both cases). Finally, neutralization studies with a blocking antibody to MMP- 1 removed 95 Â± 4 % of the collagenolytic activity in the organ <b>culture</b> <b>fluid</b> from UV-treated skin.

Ninety percent of host DNA synthesis in HeLa cells is inhibited by <b>culture</b> <b>fluid</b> of 3 -day-old cell cultures of Vero or HeLa cells infected with measles virus. This suppressing activity is not a property of the virion, but is due to nonvirion-associated component which shows none of the activities of measles virus such as hemagglutination, hemolysis, or cell fusion nor does it have the antigenicity of measles virus as tested by complement-fixation or hemagglutination-inhibiting antibody blocking tests.

40|$|This is {{the third}} report in a series on the {{inflammatory}} mediators and modulators released in organ culture from skin lesions of various ages, which were produced in vivo in rabbits by the military vesicant, sulfur mustard (SM). It describes the electrophoretic protein fractions and trypsin-inhibitory capacities of the various <b>culture</b> <b>fluids</b> and the amounts of alpha 1 -proteinase inhibitor and alpha-macroglobulin proteinase inhibitors in these fluids. With one-dimensional electrophoresis, the albumin and beta-globulin fractions of protein in <b>culture</b> <b>fluids</b> varied little with the development and healing of the SM lesions. These fractions proportionally resembled the corresponding fractions found in serum. The alpha 1 -globulin fraction was proportionally smaller than the corresponding fractions of serum as the lesions healed. The alpha 2 -globulin fraction was proportionally smaller than the corresponding fractions of serum at all stages of lesion development and healing. The gamma-globulin fraction was proportionally larger as the lesions healed. With two-dimensional electrophoresis, about 68 %, 46 %, and 35 % of the protein spots in <b>culture</b> <b>fluids</b> from representative 1 -day and 6 -day SM lesions and normal skin, respectively, matched those from serum. In each case, the large, diffuse, serum albumin spot represented {{about two-thirds of the}} protein present. Thus, gravimetrically, in normal skin and in both developing and healing lesions, the extracellular proteins were 80 - 90 % of serum origin. The trypsin-inhibitory capacity (TIC) per milligram protein in the <b>culture</b> <b>fluids</b> of healing lesions was markedly less than the TIC per milligram protein in the fluids of peak lesions. This decrease correlates well with the decrease found in the alpha 1 -globulin fraction, which contains alpha 1 -antiproteinase (alpha 1 -PI) (and alpha 1 -macroglobulin [alpha 1 M] in rabbits). The alpha 1 PI and the alpha 1 M-alpha 2 M proteinase inhibitors were identified in the <b>culture</b> <b>fluids</b> by means of sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, Western blots, specific antibodies, and the immuno-peroxidase technique. The levels of both free and proteinase-complexed alpha 1 PI and alpha M inhibitors in the <b>culture</b> <b>fluids</b> decreased as the lesions healed. In both developing and healing lesions, {{at least half of the}} alpha 1 PI and alpha M inhibitors seemed to be complexed with proteinases.

Culture medium consisted of a serum-free, growth factor-free basal medium containing either 0. 15 mmol/L Ca 2 + or 1. 4 mmol/L Ca 2 +. Some cultures were left as control, whereas others were treated with 3 mumol/L all-trans retinoic acid (RA). In the presence of RA, epidermal cohesion was disrupted and the upper layers separated from the viable epidermis beneath. This effect was observed under both low Ca 2 + and high Ca 2 + conditions. At 2 -day intervals, <b>culture</b> <b>fluids</b> were collected and analyzed for serine and metalloproteinase activities. Serine proteinase activity was detected in the <b>culture</b> <b>fluids</b> and {{virtually all of the}} detected activity was dependent on the presence of plasminogen. Activity was elevated in the RA-treated tissues and this was due to increased amounts of both urokinase-type plasminogen activator (u-PA) and tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA). Elastase and cathepsin G were not detected in either control or RA-treated cultures. Increased plasminogen activator levels were also detected in RA-treated keratinocytes and fibroblasts in monolayer culture. Significant amounts of t-PA (though not u-PA) were found in fibroblast <b>culture</b> <b>fluids,</b> whereas both t-PA and u-PA were detected in <b>culture</b> <b>fluids</b> from keratinocytes. Metalloproteinase activity was also detected in the <b>culture</b> <b>fluids</b> of control and RA-treated tissues but in contrast to plasminogen activator, metalloproteinase activity decreased in the presence of RA. Casein and gelatin zymographic studies indicated the presence of both 92 - and 72 -kd gelatinases and stromelysin- 1 and suggested that the decreased activity was primarily due to reduction in the 92 - and 72 -kd gelatinases. When serine proteinase inhibitors (aprotinin and soybean trypsin inhibitor) were included in the culture medium throughout the incubation period, epidermal discohesion was reduced. A metalloproteinase inhibitor, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase- 2, did not have this effect.

All of the three strains used in this study, appeared efficient in degrading the insecticide especially in co-culturing conditions. These bacteria are promising for detoxifying the insecticide contaminated soils. Key words: Pseudomonas, detoxification, malathion...|$|R
40|$|Three {{methods of}} {{pelleting}}, pelleting followed by Pronase treatment, polyethylene glycol (PEG) -Pronase, and diaflo ultrafiltration (diafiltration) {{were used to}} concen-trate RSV(RAV-I) from tissue <b>culture</b> <b>fluids.</b> Sucrose-gradient fractions containing virus preparations which had been concentrated bydiafiltration or pelleting were heavily contaminated with amorphous debris. This debris was not present in similar, gradient-purified preparations that had been concentrated by the PEG-Pronase or pellet-Pronase methods. Maximum recovery of radiolabelled virus particles and virion-associated RNA-dependent DNA polymerase activity was obtained in gradient fractions containing virus concentrates prepared by the pellet-Pronase and PEG-Pronase methods. Although there were slight differences in recovery by these two methods, {{the advantages of the}} PEG-Pronase method make it the preferred method, especially when large volumes of tissue <b>culture</b> <b>fluids</b> are used...|$|R
