40|$|Concerns {{continue}} to be expressed about cabin air quality and perceived effects on health; this is {{a review of the}} current aviation medical understanding. Cabin Pressurisation Atmospheric pressure reduces with altitude, but normal people can tolerate a reduction in oxygen partial pressure up to around 10, 000 ft; above this, oxygen partial pressure reduces rapidly and impairs brain function. To provide a buffer for those not fully fit, the maximum certified cabin altitude in normal operation is 8, 000 ft. During flight, air is derived from the compression stage of the jet engine or, {{in the case of the}} B 787, from electrically driven <b>compressors.</b> This <b>bleed</b> <b>air</b> is conditioned and filtered, with an exchange of 10 - 15 times per hour with outside air and 20 - 30 times per hour including outside and filtered recirculated air...|$|R

40|$|The {{operational}} {{characteristics of a}} J 57 -P 1 turbojet engine have been investigated at altitudes between 15, 000 and 66, 000 feet in the Lewis altitude wind tunnel. Included {{in this study is}} a discussion of fuel nozzle coking, the altitude operating limits with and without the standard engine control, the compressor surge characteristics, and the engine starting and windmilling characteristics. Severe circumferential turbine outlet temperature gradients which occurred at high altitude as a result of fuel nozzle coking were alleviated by the manufacturer's change in the fuel flow divider schedule and in a nozzle gasket material. <b>Compressor</b> <b>air</b> <b>bleed</b> is required to prevent surge of the outboard compressor in the low engine speed region. The maximum altitude at which the engine was operated without the control was about 66, 000 feet at 0. 8 flight Mach number and at a reduced engine speed to avoid compressor surge; with the engine control in operation, the altitude operating limit is reduced to approximately 59, 000 feet. The maximum altitude at which the engine was started was about 40, 000 feet...|$|R

50|$|Small {{quantities}} of <b>compressor</b> <b>bleed</b> <b>air</b> {{are also used}} to cool the shaft, turbine shrouds, etc.Some air {{is also used to}} keep the temperature of the combustion chamber walls below critical. This is done using primary and secondary airholes which allow a thin layer of air to cover the inner walls of the chamber preventing excessive heating.|$|E
50|$|Accessories {{included}} a Master Control Unit, mounted above the compressors, and an air driven starter on the gearbox. The compound reduction gear had an overall reduction ratio of 15.75:1 and incorporated an airscrew brake to prevent windmilling when {{the engine was}} stopped. Anti-icing for the air intakes was supplied by <b>compressor</b> <b>bleed</b> <b>air.</b> The contra-rotating propeller consisted of two 14 ft three-bladed Aeroproducts propellers fitted to concentric shafts.|$|E
40|$|Researchers are {{constantly}} pursuing technologies {{that will increase}} the performance of gas turbine engines. The aspirated compressor concept discussed here would allow the compression system {{to perform its task}} with about one-half of the compressor blades. To accomplish this, the researchers applied boundary layer control to the blades, casing, and hub. This method of boundary layer control consisted of removing small amounts of air from the main flow path at critical areas of the <b>compressor.</b> This <b>bleed</b> <b>air</b> could be used by other systems such as engine cooling or could be re-injected into lower pressure areas that require air for enhanced performance. This effort was initiated by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in response to a solicitation from the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) who sought to advance research in flow control technology. The NASA Glenn Research Center partnered with MIT (principal investigator), Honeywell Aircraft Engines (cycle analysis, structural analysis, and mechanical design), and Pratt & Whitney (cycle analysis and aero-analysis) to conceptualize, design, analyze, build, and test the aspirated fan stage. The aero-design and aero-analysis of this fan stage were jointly executed by MIT and Glenn to minimize the amount of bleed flow needed and to maintain the highest efficiency possible (ref. 1). Mechanical design issues were complicated by the need to have a shrouded rotor with hollow blades, with rotor stress levels beyond the capabilities of titanium. The high stress issues were addressed by designing a shroud that was filament wound with a carbon fiber/epoxy matrix, resulting in an assembly that was strong enough to handle the high stresses. Both the rotor (preceding photographs) and stator (following photograph) were fabricated in two halves and then bolted together at the hub and tip, permitting the bleed passages to be machined into each half before assembly...|$|R
40|$|During an {{investigation}} of the J 57 -P- 1 turbojet engine in the Lewis altitude wind tunnel, effects of inlet-flow distortion on engine stall characteristics and operating limits were determined. In addition to a uniform inlet-flow profile, the inlet-pressure distortions imposed included two radial, two circumferential, and one combined radial-circumferential profile. Data were obtained over a range of compressor speeds at an altitude of 50, 000 and a flight Mach number of 0. 8; in addition, the high- and low-speed engine operating limits were investigated up to the maximum operable altitude. The effect of changing the <b>compressor</b> <b>bleed</b> position on the stall and operating limits was determined for one of the inlet distortions. The circumferential distortions lowered the compressor stall pressure ratios; this resulted in less fuel-flow margin between steady-state operation and compressor stall. Consequently, the altitude operating Limits with circumferential distortions were reduced compared with the uniform inlet profile. Radial inlet-pressure distortions increased the pressure ratio required for compressor stall over that obtained with uniform inlet flow; this resulted in higher altitude operating limits. Likewise, the stall-limit fuel flows required with the radial inlet-pressure distortions were considerably higher than those obtained with the uniform inlet-pressure profile. A combined radial-circumferential inlet distortion had effects on the engine similar to the circumferential distortion. <b>Bleeding</b> <b>air</b> between the two compressors eliminated the low-speed stall limit and thus permitted higher altitude operation than was possible without <b>compressor</b> <b>bleed...</b>|$|R
50|$|A {{simplifying}} assumption sometimes made {{is for the}} addition of fuel flow to be exactly offset by an overboard <b>compressor</b> <b>bleed,</b> so mass flow remains constant throughout the cycle.|$|R
50|$|The {{principle}} of the jet flap, a type of internally blown flap, was proposed and patented in 1952 by the British National Gas Turbine Establishment (NGTE) and thereafter investigated by the NGTE and the Royal Aircraft Establishment.The concept was first tested at full-scale on the experimental Hunting H.126. It reduced the stall speed to only 32 mi/h km/h, a number most light aircraft cannot match. The jet flap used {{a large percentage of}} the engine exhaust, rather than <b>compressor</b> <b>bleed</b> <b>air,</b> for blowing.|$|E
50|$|Air was {{initially}} compressed (and heated) by the inlet spike and subsequent converging duct between the centerbody and inlet cowl. The shock waves generated slowed {{the air to}} subsonic speeds relative to the engine. The air then entered the engine compressor. Some of this compressor flow (20% at cruise) was removed after the 4th compressor stage and {{went straight to the}} afterburner through six bypass tubes. Air passing through the turbojet was compressed further by the remaining 5 compressor stages and then fuel was added in the combustion chamber. After passing through the turbine the exhaust, together with the <b>compressor</b> <b>bleed</b> <b>air,</b> entered the afterburner.|$|E
50|$|The {{tanks were}} air pressurised, {{the fuel tank}} by engine <b>compressor</b> <b>bleed</b> <b>air</b> and the oxidiser tank by ram air and {{additionally}} by the stored air bottle. Ram air {{was taken from the}} supersonic inlet boundary layer bleeds. A single timer-controlled valve opened the stored air supply which then opened the pneumatic LP cocks. A second valve, after a delay, engaged the turbopump clutch. HP cocks were opened by a single hydraulic piston, driven by fuel pressure controlled through a third timed valve. Both fuel and oxidiser first flowed through a small pilot valve for ignition, before their main valves opened. Correct opening of all four valves was monitored by the timer control, to ensure a safe mixture.|$|E
40|$|A {{ground test}} was {{performed}} {{to determine the effects}} of <b>compressor</b> <b>bleed</b> flow extraction on the performance of F 404 -GE- 400 afterburning turbofan engines. The two engines were installed in the F/A- 18 High Alpha Research Vehicle at the NASA Dryden Flight Research Facility. A specialized bleed ducting system was installed onto the aircraft to control and measure engine bleed airflow while the aircraft was tied down to a thrust measuring stand. The test was conducted on each engine and at various power settings. The <b>bleed</b> <b>air</b> extraction levels analyzed included flow rates above the manufacturer's maximum specification limit. The measured relationship between thrust and bleed flow extraction was shown to be essentially linear at all power settings with an increase in bleed flow causing a corresponding decrease in thrust. A comparison with the F 404 -GE- 400 steady-state engine simulation showed the estimation to be within +/- 1 percent of measured thrust losses for large increases in bleed flow rate...|$|R

A thermodynamic design point study is presented analyzing a configuration with a combustor located concentrically around the engine core receiving pressurized air through an interstage high pressure <b>compressor</b> <b>bleed.</b> A parameter study of the <b>compressor</b> <b>bleed</b> ratio is presented for the configuration.

50|$|Engine <b>bleed</b> <b>air</b> is {{admitted}} through a {{flow control valve}} to a heat exchanger. The cabin temperature is controlled by regulating {{the temperature of the}} pressure <b>bleed</b> <b>air</b> that is routed through the cabin. The <b>bleed</b> <b>air</b> is cooled in the heat exchanger by ram air entering the dorsal fin inlet and passing through the heat exchanger. The amount of <b>bleed</b> <b>air</b> cooling at the heat exchanger can be controlled by the hot air bypass valve (H-valve). The H-valve position can be adjusted by the crew to increase or reduce the amount of <b>bleed</b> <b>air</b> cooling at the heat exchanger.|$|R
50|$|Examples {{of planes}} {{that can be}} fitted with this upgrade include the Boeing 737-200, which {{includes}} a gravel deflector (similar in appearance to a wide ski) mounted to the nose wheel, and vortex dissipators, using <b>compressor</b> <b>bleed</b> <b>air,</b> {{in front of each}} engine. This modification was used by Alaska Airlines for many years, and is still employed by Air Inuit, Canadian North, Air North, Nolinor Aviation and First Air in northern Canada. Some Boeing 727s were also fitted with specific gravel kits on the nose wheel, while the rest were fitted with devices in the form of smaller deflectors than those used on the 737, used on all wheels, to deflect FOD away so as to prevent the rear-mounted engines from ingesting FOD from a runway. Another rear-engined aircraft--the McDonnell Douglas DC-9/MD-80/MD-90 and Boeing 717 series--uses deflectors {{similar to those of the}} conventionally-equipped 727 on all their aircraft's landing gear to prevent FOD structural damage and ingestion.|$|E
5000|$|After {{the initial}} blade fracture, Captain Kevin Hunt had {{disengaged}} the plane's autopilot. When Hunt asked First Officer David McClelland which engine was malfunctioning, McClelland replied: [...] "It's the left.... It's the right one". In previous {{versions of the}} 737, the left air conditioning pack, fed with <b>compressor</b> <b>bleed</b> <b>air</b> from the left (number 1) engine, supplied air to the flight deck, while the right air conditioning pack, fed from the right (number 2) engine supplied air to the cabin. On the 737-400 this division of air is blurred; the left pack feeds the flight deck but also feeds the aft cabin zone, while the right feeds the forward cabin. The pilots {{had been used to}} the older version of the aircraft and did not realise that this aircraft (which had only been flown by British Midland for 520 hours over a two-month period) was different. The captain later claimed that his perception of smoke as coming forward from the cabin led them to assume the fault was in the right engine. The pilots throttled back the working right engine instead of the malfunctioning left engine. They had no way of visually checking the engines from the cockpit, and the cabin crew — who did not hear the commander refer to the right hand engine in his cabin address — did not inform them that smoke and flames had been seen from the left engine.|$|E

40|$|It {{is pointed}} out that in certain {{emergency}} situations it may be desirable to obtain power from a helicopter engine at levels greater than the maximum rating.

The present investigation is concerned with the results of a feasibility study which analytically investigated the maximum possible level of augmentation with constant gas generator turbine stress rupture life as a constraint.

The tests covered {{the orientation of the}} outer panel nozzles, the effects of SWB operation on the performance of leading and trailing edge flaps and the effects of SWB on lateral stability. The trials were run at low speeds and angles of attack from 24 - 45 deg (landing). Both lift and longitudinal stability improved with the SWB, stall and leading edge vortex breakdown were delayed and performance increased with the SWB rate. Lateral stability was degraded below 20 deg angle of attack while instabilities were delayed above 20 deg due to roll damping...|$|E
40|$|The {{suitability}} of cermets for turbine stator blades of a modified turbojet engine was determined {{at an average}} turbine-inlet-gas temperature of 2000 F. Such an increase in temperature would yield a premium in thrust from a service engine. Because the cermet blades require no cooling, all the available <b>compressor</b> <b>bleed</b> <b>air</b> {{could be used to}} cool a turbine made from conventional ductile alloys. Cermet blades were first run in 100 -hour endurance tests at normal gas temperatures in order to evaluate two methods for mounting them. The elevated gas-temperature test was then run using the method of support considered best for high-temperature operation. After 52 hours at 2000 F, one of the group of four cermet blades fractured probably because of end loads resulting from thermal distortion of the spacer band of the nozzle diaphragm. Improved design of a service engine would preclude this cause of premature failure...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} the six-decade use of unfiltered aircraft <b>bleed</b> <b>air,</b> taken from jet engines to supply breathing {{air in the}} flight decks and passenger cabins of commercial and military transport aircraft. During this time, numerous flight safety issues and adverse effects from exposure to contaminated <b>bleed</b> <b>air</b> have been reported. The research undertaken in this thesis examined previous investigations into these matters {{and the consequences of}} using <b>bleed</b> <b>air</b> on flight safety and crew and passenger health. This research examined: (a) health issues reported by aircrew as a consequence of exposure to contaminated <b>bleed</b> <b>air</b> whilst flying by way of several descriptive surveys; (b) various aviation air monitoring studies previously undertaken were reviewed to assess the knowledge base of the chemicals present during contaminated air events; (c) air sampling data were evaluated for their usefulness in determining any potential adverse health effects; (d) a review was undertaken of the frequency of contaminated <b>bleed</b> <b>air</b> events; (e) a review was undertaken of some of the information known by the aviation industry and others about contaminated <b>bleed</b> <b>air.</b> Analysis of the evidence that <b>bleed</b> <b>air,</b> contaminated by synthetic jet engine oils and hydraulic fluids, is a regular and normal occurrence and far more common than previously accepted and is a consequence of the current <b>bleed</b> <b>air</b> system design. There are significant short and longterm health effects being reported {{as a direct result of}} documented exposure events that validate claims of adverse health effects in exposed individuals. The thesis argues that the precautionary principle, occupational health and safety guidelines and aviation regulations are being ignored by the aviation industry, who continue to claim that cabin air is safe. The systemic misuse of available data is widespread, secondary to commercial objectives, and places passenger and crew health and flight safety at serious risk. The thesis concludes that the use of <b>bleed</b> <b>air</b> on commercial aircraft with no form of contaminated air detection or filtration system present should be discontinued. The risk to health and flight safety is no longer acceptable...|$|R
25|$|In some engines, <b>bleed</b> <b>air</b> is also {{tapped to}} provide power for accessories, {{as well as}} a {{mechanical}} shaft drive. <b>Bleed</b> <b>air</b> is particularly useful when a source of compressed air is specifically needed, either to pressurise cabin air, or as a supply of cooling air to other components (to avoid excess heat, this is taken for a low-pressure tapping, or from the LP compressor of a two-shaft engine). One important use for <b>bleed</b> <b>air</b> is for cross-starting of other engines in a multi-engine aircraft.|$|R
40|$|Forebody {{pneumatic}} vortex {{control has}} previously been demonstrated through full-scale flight test to be effective for directional control of aircraft at low Mach number and high angle-of-attack flight conditions. The objective of the present research {{was to investigate the}} suitability of two-axis (wing, and vertical tail) pneumatic vortex lateral/directional control of a current fighter-type aircraft at high Mach number and low angle-of-attack flight conditions. The pneumatic effectors were tested for first augmenting, and then replacing the conventional aileron and rudder on a generic F- 16 XL configuration. Evaluations were conducted on a high fidelity, nonlinear, six degree-of-freedom, non real-time simulation of this aircraft. Results demonstrate that at low blowing coefficient levels and with conventional effector augmentation, aileron and rudder activity and maximum deflections can be reduced. At higher yet realistic and attainable levels of <b>compressor</b> <b>bleed</b> <b>air,</b> aileron and rudder can be completely replaced by pneumatic devices, yet still allow the aircraft to complete aggressive bank-to-bank maneuvers and simulated penetration strike missions...|$|E
40|$|This {{analysis}} {{determines the}} effect of higher overall engine pressure ratios (OPR's), bypass ratios (BPR's), and turbine rotor-inlet temperature on a Mach- 0. 85 transport having a range of 5556 km (3000 nmi) and carrying a payload of 18144 kg (40, 000 lbs- 200 passengers). Sideline noises (jet plus fan) of between 91 and 106 EPNdB (FAR 36) are considered. Takeoff gross weight (TOGW), fuel consumption (kg/pass. km) and direct operating cost (DOC) are used at the figures of merit. Based on predicted 1985 levels of engine technology and a noise goal of 96 EPNdB, the higher-OPR engine results in an airplane that is 18 percent lighter in terms of TOGW, uses 22. 3 percent less fuel, and has a 14. 7 percent lower DOC than a comparable airplane powered by a current turbofan. Cooling the <b>compressor</b> <b>bleed</b> <b>air</b> and lowering the cruise Mach number appear attractive in terms of further improving the figures of merit...|$|E
40|$|The cooling of {{gas turbine}} {{components}} {{was the subject}} of considerable research. The problem is difficult because the available coolant, <b>compressor</b> <b>bleed</b> <b>air,</b> is itself quite hot and has relatively poor thermophysical properties for a coolant.

Injection of a small quantity of cold liquid water into a relatively hot coolant air stream such that evaporation of the liquid is still in process when the coolant contacts the hot component was studied. No approach was found whereby heat transfer characteristics could be confidently predicted for such a case based solely on prior studies. It was not clear whether disequilibrium between phases at the inlet to the hot component section would improve cooling relative to that obtained where equilibrium was established prior to contact with the hot surface...|$|E
