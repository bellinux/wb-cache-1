5000|$|At {{the start}} of World War II, the Mark I Trench Knife was the only knife issued to Marines. It was {{introduced}} during World War I for trench warfare, but its [...] "knuckle duster" [...] hilt was cumbersome and contained nearly 1 lb of brass, making the knife expensive to produce. In addition, the Mark I could not {{be held in the}} [...] "fencing-grip" [...] position, the preferred position for the thrust. The Marine Corps began issuing the KA-BAR, a <b>combination</b> fighting/utility <b>knife,</b> in 1942 due to the inadequacies of the Mark I. The Marine Raiders, however, desired a dagger designed solely for knife fighting, but none were available that met the requirements.|$|R
50|$|According to {{the book}} Weaponry: An Illustrated History, by Chuck Wills, between the late 16th century and the {{advances}} in repeating firearms in the mid 19th century, blades or clubs were often fitted onto guns, because only one shot could be fired from the gun. Without an alternative weapon attachment, they became useless at close range. Some of the first included the German Ax-Pistol, made in the central European region of Silesia. This weapon combined a flintlock pistol with a battleaxe. Later, a Pistol-Sword combination formed in the mid 18th century, which was apparently used mainly by marines and naval officers in boarding engagements at sea. Additionally, Dumonthier & Sons produced several <b>knife</b> pistol <b>combinations.</b> Pocket <b>knives</b> with zip guns inside were made by Unwin & Rodgers, and an Indian gunsmith fitted a percussion cap gun to a mace in the 19th century. Even some shields were fitted with barrels, sometimes designed {{to look like a}} spike, and other times placed in cleverly concealed holes.|$|R
50|$|A case knife {{is a name}} used {{throughout}} the American South {{to refer to a}} table knife, i.e. a knife intended for use at the dining table. The origin of this usage comes from a time when inns did not customarily provide eating utensils with meals. The table fork was relatively new, and was often sold in <b>combination</b> with a <b>knife</b> and, sometimes, a spoon. Thus the term refers to a knife that was sold in a case, as part of a set of utensils intended for use in dining.Case knife is also used to refer to a pocketknife made by W. R. Case & Sons Cutlery Co..|$|R
40|$|In this article, {{we present}} {{the case of}} a 52 -year-old male with a history of parotid carcinosarcoma with initial {{diagnosis}} being 18 months prior. Initial treatment included a <b>combination</b> of gamma <b>knife</b> surgery coupled with high dosage chemotherapy and X-ray radiation therapy. At the time of follow-up, the patient presented with no complaints and had a nearly normal physical exam with the exception of some facial nerve weakness on the same side as the initial surgery. Despite being asymptomatic, the patient had a significant progression of disease that was manifested with intracranial lesions, multiple pathologic fractures, and a dramatic increase in overall tumor burden. Ultimately, the patient decided to pursue comfort measures only and succumbed to the disease peacefully soon thereafter...|$|R
50|$|Type 2 {{is found}} as small grains mixed within basalt rock. The grains are usually 1 to 5 {{millimeters}} in diameter. The grains are usually found individually, separated by the basalt, {{although they are}} sometimes sintered together to form larger aggregates. The larger pieces also contain small amounts of cohenite, ilmenite, pearlite and troilite. Type 2 {{was used by the}} Inuit to make items such as knives and ulus. The basalt was usually crushed in order to release the pea-sized grains, which were them hammered into discs about the size of coins. These flat discs were usually inserted into bone handles so that they slightly overlapped each other, forming an edge that resembled a <b>combination</b> of a <b>knife</b> and a saw (an inverted serrated edge).|$|R
40|$|Micromechanically exfoliated mono- and multilayers of {{molybdenum}} disulfide (MoS 2) are investigated by spectroscopic imaging ellipsometry. In <b>combination</b> with <b>knife</b> edge illumination, MoS 2 flakes {{can be detected}} and classified on arbitrary flat and also transparent substrates with a lateral resolution down to 1 to 2 um. The complex dielectric functions from mono- and trilayer MoS 2 are presented. They are extracted from a multilayer model to fit the measured ellipsometric angles employing an anisotropic and an isotropic fit approach. We find that the energies of the critical points of the optical constants can be treated to be independent of the utilized model, whereas {{the magnitude of the}} optical constants varies with the used model. The anisotropic model suggests a maximum absorbance for a MoS 2 sheet supported by sapphire of about 14 % for monolayer and of 10 % for trilayer MoS 2. Furthermore, the lateral homogeneity of the complex dielectric function for monolayer MoS 2 is investigated with a spatial resolution of 2 um. Only minor fluctuations are observed. No evidence for strain, for a significant amount of disorder or lattice defects {{can be found in the}} wrinkle-free regions of the MoS 2 monolayer from complementary Raman spectroscopy measurements. We assume that the minor lateral variation in the optical constants are caused by lateral modification in the van der Waals interaction presumably caused by the preparation using micromechanical exfoliation and viscoelastic stamping.

5000|$|In the 1920s {{the knife}} {{manufacturer}} introduced stainless steel to its production, and started making collectible character knives, which honored famous {{people such as}} George Washington, Babe Ruth, and Buck Rogers. It also began manufacturing private label products for Sears, Craftsman, Woolworth and many others. During World War II, Camillus shipped more than 13 million knives of various styles to the Allied troops. [...] In 1942, U.S. Marine Corps officers Colonel John M. Davis and Major Howard E. America working in conjunction with cutlery technicians at Camillus developed the [...] KA-BAR Fighting Utility Knife. [...] After extensive trials, the KA-BAR prototype was recommended for adoption, and Camillus was awarded the first contract to produce the KA-BAR for the Marine Corps. [...] Camillus made more KA-BARs than any other knife manufacturer producing the model during World War II. [...] During the war, Camillus also made the M3 fighting knives, the M4 bayonets and many other utility knives for U.S. forces, including machetes, multi-blade utility knives, TL-29 Signal Corps pocket knives for signalmen, electrician's mates, and linesmen, and <b>combination</b> knife/marlinspike pocket <b>knives</b> {{for use by the}} U.S. Navy in cutting and splicing lines.|$|R
40|$|The {{cemetery}} of Putten {{had a close}} {{relation between}} structure and chronology. Even though the cemetery has not been completely excavated in the twenties of the 20 th century, {{it is possible to}} make several assumptions based on the available data. A newer plan has been included in the attachment, showing not earlier published structures of the cemetery. These newly added parts offer a great help with the analysis of structure and chronology. The eldest part of the excavated cemetery can be connected to small circular structures consisting of postholes or ditches, which encircled a cremation. A possible new start of a cemetery seemed to have been made after the cremation burials were no longer in use and a transition was made to inhumation graves. This new start was located more to the east of the cemetery and consisted of rich graves. Here a distinction could be made between graves that belonged to females and males. These graves could have been encircled by either a single or double circular ditch. Finds included weaponry, pottery, brooches, etc. Around this core a younger zone was situated. These graves contained burials joined only by the <b>combination</b> of <b>knives</b> with buckles or necklaces. The amount of finds that was in the older zone has been reduced to the above combination only. A distinction between genders is no longer possible to make. No skeletal material was collected from any inhumation graves, mostly due to the poor condition they were in when they were excavated and an assumption cannot be made on finds alone. This zone and the older zone with the ‘rich’ graves also had postholes around the graves. Other elements were also situated in these two zones, such as: double graves and differently orientated graves. This disappeared over time with the circular ditches and the burial gifts. The outer zone of the excavated cemetery is a zone without any finds...|$|R
50|$|To {{form the}} bale, the {{material}} to be baled, (which is often hay or straw) in the windrow is lifted by tines in the baler's reel. This material is then packed into the bale chamber, which runs the length of {{one side of the}} baler (normally the right hand side when viewed from the front). A <b>combination</b> plunger and <b>knife</b> move {{back and forth in the}} front of this chamber, with the knife closing the door into the bale chamber as it moves backwards. The plunger and knife are attached to a heavy asymmetrical flywheel to provide extra force as they pack the bales. A measuring device—normally a spiked wheel that is turned by the emerging bales—measures the amount of material that is being compressed and, at the appropriate length it triggers the knotters that wrap the twine around the bale and tie it off. As the next bale is formed the tied one is driven out of the rear of the baling chamber onto the ground or onto a special wagon or collecting sled hooked to the rear of the baler. This process continues as long as there is material to be baled, and twine to tie it with. The bales emerge with four sides. The twine runs, in two parallel loops, around the wider sides. Of the two narrower sides, there is a cut side and a dull side, and when stacked for storage or transport the bales are normally positioned with the cut side facing outwards.|$|R
