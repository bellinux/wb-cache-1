50|$|<b>Caroverine</b> -3 - (p-methoxybenzyl) - 1, 2 - hydro{{quinoxaline}}-2-one is a quinoxaline derivative {{developed in}} the 1960s. <b>Caroverine,</b> an N-methyl-D-aspartate and α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptor antagonist together with antioxidant activity, {{has been shown to}} protect the inner ear from excitotoxicity and to be effective in the treatment of tinnitus, sudden hearing loss and speech discrimination disorders in presbyacusis.|$|E
50|$|<b>Caroverine</b> also {{acts as a}} {{reversible}} {{glutamate antagonist}} in afferent cochlear synapse. Theoretical justification for the introduction of <b>caroverine</b> in the pharmacotherapy of tinnitus is that glutamate, as a key neurotransmitter in the central nervous system, {{is the most likely}} transmitter-substance in the afferent cochlear synapse (Ehrenberger-K eta al., 1992; Ehrenberger-K et al., 1995a; Ehrenberger-K et al., 1995b).|$|E
50|$|<b>Caroverine</b> {{has been}} {{demonstrated}} {{to have a high}} rate of efficacy in the treatment of cochlear-synaptic tinnitus.|$|E
50|$|A drug {{closely related}} to the quinoxalinediones, but {{possessing}} a quinazoline-2,4-dione structure instead, is selurampanel. <b>Caroverine</b> is another closely related drug to the above, but instead containing a quinoxaline-2-one structure.|$|E
50|$|In recent years, it is {{on grounds}} of its quinoxline-dione structure, {{glutamate}} antagonism of him excitatory, afferent synapses of the cochlear inner hair cells and its neuroprotective properties that <b>caroverine</b> has been investigated as a new drug in the pharmacological treatment of tinnitus.|$|E
50|$|<b>Caroverine</b> (Spasmium, Spadon, Tinnex) {{is a drug}} used in {{tinnitus}} treatment improves mechanosensitivity and mechanotransduction {{phenomenon and}} otoneuroprotective (inner ear protective) agent in some countries. It acts as an N-type calcium channel blocker, competitive AMPA receptor antagonist, and non-competitive NMDA receptor antagonist. It also has potent antioxidant effects.|$|E
40|$|Tetanus is {{a disease}} that occurs in humans and various animal species worldwide. Tetanus toxin, after binding itself to nerve {{structures}} in the spinal cord, blocking the release of inhibitory transmitors which results in predominance of excitatory transmitors, and this manifestes itself in skeletal muscle spasm. In theory, inhibition of excitatory transmission can try to antagonize a number of ways: by stimulating inhibitory transmission with application inhibitory transmitors, inhibition of excitatory transmission by application of antagonists of excitatory transmitors and combination of antagonists of excitatory transmitors. Bearing this in mind, we attempted to normalize the disorders by tetanus toxin {{with the use of}} <b>caroverine,</b> an antagonist of excitatory transmitors, alone and in combination with aminooxyacetic acid (substance that increases the level of GABA). Experiments were conducted on albino mice of both sexes, weight 20 - 25 g. The experimental tetanus was induced by application of tetanus toxin. The application of <b>caroverine</b> and combination with aminooxyacetic acid was carried out 24 hours after application of tetanus toxin, once per day, until the death. <b>Caroverine,</b> given alone in a dose of 1, 2 mg/kg significantly prolonged the LD 50 period of mice with experimental tetanus, so the obtained results can be said that its application only at this dose proved to be effective. The combination with aminooxyacetic acid was gave an insignificant extension of mice’s dying time with experimental tetanus in the trial, compared to the control group.

40|$|The frog {{spinal cord}} {{was used to}} {{determine}} the characteristics of the actions of <b>caroverine</b> and diltiazem, two organic Ca 2 +-antagonists, on synaptic responses and L-glutamate-induced depolarization. <b>Caroverine</b> and diltiazem (10 (- 4) M) depressed the dorsal root potential (DR-DRP) induced by electrical stimulation of an adjacent dorsal root. Diltiazem also depressed the ventral root potential (DR-VRP), whereas <b>caroverine</b> augmented both the polysynaptic component in the ventral root reflex {{and the size of the}} DR-VRP. The root potentials induced by high frequency stimulation (20 Hz, for 1 s) were markedly depressed by these Ca 2 +-antagonists at a concentration of 10 (- 4) M. When the preparation was perfused with normal medium, the compounds depressed L-glutamate-induced depolarizations in ventral and dorsal roots. In preparations treated with tetrodotoxin (TTX) (2 X 10 (- 7) M), the antagonizing actions of the drugs against L-glutamate-induced depolarizations in the ventral root were markedly reduced or abolished, while significant antagonizing actions on the depolarization in the dorsal root were still observed. The increase in extracellular K+ activity induced by L-glutamate in the TTX-treated preparation was significantly reduced by the compounds. <b>Caroverine</b> and diltiazem had no effect on the presynaptic nerve spike and on the focal synaptic potential induced by a single stimulation of a dorsal root; however, the focal synaptic potential induced by high frequency stimulation (20 Hz, 1 s) was attenuated. Motoneuronal action potentials were abolished by the drugs, while the excitatory postsynaptic potential remained unaffected. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{describes}} two {{simple and}} novel analytical methods by using spectrophotometric technique for {{the determination of}} <b>caroverine</b> a spasmolytic drug in pharmaceutical formulations. The first (A) is a direct method in which analysis of the pure drug was carried out at its λmax 304 nm in ethanol solvent. The method was linear from 0. 5 to 18 μg/ml with correlation coefficient of 0. 999 and molar absorptivity of 5. 55 × 104 Lmole− 1 cm− 1. Limit of detection and limit of quantification were 0. 44 and 1. 47 μg/ml. While the second method (B) {{is based on the}} charge transfer reaction between <b>caroverine</b> as n-electron donor and 7, 7, 8, 8 -tetracyanoquinodimethane (TCNQ) as pi-acceptor resulting in highly colored stable complex, which showed maximum absorption band at wavelength of 525 nm. The thermodynamic parameters were calculated as association constant KCT of 7. 53 × 104 mol− 1 and Gibbs free energy ΔG° of − 6. 72 kJmol− 1. Different variables affecting the charge transfer reaction were carefully studied and optimized. At the optimum reaction conditions, Beer’s law was obeyed in a concentration range of 1 – 35 μgml− 1 with molar absorptivity of 1. 17 × 104 Lmole− 1 cm− 1 and correlation coefficient of 0. 9999. The proposed methods were validated according to ICH guidelines...|$|E
40|$|Tetanus, {{also known}} as lockjaw, is a very {{dangerous}} infectious acute, usually afebrile disease characterized by muscle spasms, affecting humans and various animal species. The causative agent of the disease is bacteria Clostridium tetani. This bacteria produces a specific neurotoxin known as Tetanus toxin, which consists of two components: tetanospasmin and tetanolysin. Light (L) chains of tetanospamin cleavage synaptobrevin, an integral membrane component of the synaptic vesicles, which in turn prevent release of the inhibitory neurotransmitter γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) into the synaptic cleft. The α- motor neurons are, therefore, under no inhibitory control as a result of which they undergo sustained excitatory discharge causing the characteristic motor spasms of tetanus. In this research, we attempted to normalize the disorders caused by tetanus toxin by using ketamine, a non-competitive antagonist of aspartate (at doses of 5, 10, 44 and 100 mg/kg of body weight – b. w.), alone and in combination with indol- 2 -carboxylic acid, a competitive antagonist of aspartate (at a dose of 10 mg/kg b. w.) and <b>caroverine,</b> a non-competitive antagonist of glutamate (at a dose of 1. 2 mg/kg b. w.). Experiments were conducted on the albino mice of both sexes, weighing around 20 - 25 g. Experimental tetanus was induced by application of tetanus toxin. The administration of ketamine, alone and in combination with indol- 2 -carboxylic acid and <b>caroverine</b> was carried out 24 hours after administration of tetanus toxin once per day, until the mice died. It was found that ketamine had an effect only at a dose of 10 mg/kg b. w., which slightly prolonged the LD 50 periodin experimental group of mice, compared to the control group of mice with experimental tetanus. Thus, it can be concluded that administration of ketamine in this dose proved to be only slightly effective. On the other hand, combination of ketamine with indol- 2 -carboxylic acid slightly extended the survival time of mice with experimental tetanus in the trial, as compared to the control group. Lastly, the combination of ketamine with <b>caroverine</b> had no effect whatsoever on the LD 50 period of mice with experimental tetanus...|$|E
