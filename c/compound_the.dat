5|$|After the {{evacuation}} signal was given, the buses began {{to pick up}} passengers and head to the DAO <b>Compound.</b> <b>The</b> system worked so efficiently that the buses {{were able to make}} three return journeys rather than the expected one. The biggest problem occurred when the ARVN guarding the main gate at Tan Son Nhut refused to allow the last convoy of buses into the DAO Compound at about 17:45. As this was happening, a firefight between two ARVN units broke out and caught the rearmost buses in the crossfire, disabling two of the vehicles. Eventually the ARVN commander controlling the gates agreed to permit the remaining buses to enter the compound.

40|$|ON THE ORIGIN OF THE NOUN COMPOUNDS IN OLD PRUSSIAN Summary The article {{deals with}} the origin of <b>the</b> noun <b>compounds</b> of <b>the</b> Elbing Vocabulary and the Third Catechism. It {{establishes}} {{that more than a}} half of <b>the</b> noun <b>compounds</b> of <b>the</b> Elbing Vocabulary and only three noun <b>compounds</b> of <b>the</b> Third Catechism are of Old Prussian origin. <b>The</b> remaining <b>compounds</b> of <b>the</b> Elbing Vocabulary and the majority of those in the Third Catechism are loan translations from German. <b>The</b> noun <b>compounds</b> of <b>the</b> Elbing Vocabulary obviously tend to have simple base words. Except for a few questionable examples, there are no case <b>compounds</b> in <b>the</b> Elbing Vocabulary — all of them may be termed as stem <b>compounds.</b> However <b>the</b> <b>compounds</b> of <b>the</b> Third Catechism follow a clear trend of being comprised of underlying derivatives as well as having a case form for the first constituent. The German influence on <b>the</b> <b>compounds</b> of <b>the</b> Elbing Vocabulary is not very strong — it has impacted it only on the lexical level, while <b>the</b> <b>compounds</b> of <b>the</b> Third Catechism have also undergone more radical changes on the structural level. According to the above-mentioned features, it can be stated that <b>the</b> noun <b>compounds</b> of <b>the</b> Elbing Vocabulary resemble Lithuanian ones, while those of the Third Catechism show similarities with Latvian compounds which are influenced by German to a fairly large extent. </p...|$|R

5|$|Bats {{are natural}} {{reservoirs}} {{for a large}} number of zoonotic pathogens, including rabies, histoplasmosis both directly and in guano, Nipah Hendra viruses, and possibly ebola virus. Their high mobility, broad distribution, long life spans, substantial sympatry, and social behaviour make bats favourable hosts and vectors of disease. Compared to rodents, bats carry more zoonotic viruses per species, and each virus is shared with more species. They seem to be highly resistant to many of the pathogens they carry, suggesting a degree of adaptation to bats' immune systems. Furthermore, their interactions with livestock and pets, including predation by vampire bats, accidental encounters, and the scavenging of bat carcasses, <b>compound</b> <b>the</b> risk of zoonotic transmission.|$|E

5|$|In {{spite of}} the doubts {{highlighted}} {{in relation to the}} construction of a synagogue, the Perushim, confidently in possession of the ambiguous firman, began clearing away the rubble from the Ruin courtyard in September 1836. As the foundations of he-Hasid's original synagogue were revealed, they discovered a few old documents dating from 1579, signed by Israel ben Moses Najara. After much debate, they decided not to rebuild the Ruin, but initially erect a small structure {{on the edge of the}} Ashkenasic <b>compound.</b> <b>The</b> Arab creditors, however, still refused to relinquish the claims they had on the Jews and continued to interfere with the works. Zoref, claiming that the Ashkenazim currently in Jerusalem were not related in any way to those who had borrowed the money at the turn of the 18th century, was forced to appear in court requesting a further ruling cancelling the debts. He mentioned that an injunction had already been passed that absolved the Ashkenazim from repaying the debt and maintained that the Turkish Statute of Limitations cancelled out the debts of Judah heHasid's followers. Although the court ruled in the Ashkenazim's favour, Zoref nevertheless had to appease the Arab instigators with annual bribes in order to allow building to continue. At some point this arrangement ceased and in 1851, he was struck on the head with a sword and died of his wounds three months later. By January 1837 however, the Perushim had dedicated the modest Menachem Zion Synagogue in the northwestern corner of the courtyard. In 1854, a second smaller synagogue was built within the <b>compound.</b> <b>The</b> actual plot upon which he-Hasid's synagogue had stood 130 years earlier, however, remained in ruins.|$|E

5|$|The hospital, built between 1857 and 1859, was {{a crucial}} {{component}} of Fremantle Prison.
