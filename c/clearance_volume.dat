40|$|BACKGROUND: Oesophageal {{clearance}} of {{acid reflux}} {{consists of an}} initial <b>volume</b> <b>clearance</b> followed by neutralisation of the acidified mucosa by swallowed saliva (chemical clearance). Ineffective oesophageal motility (IOM), a frequent finding in patients with gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD), has been claimed to underlie prolonged acid clearance by affecting oesophageal emptying and saliva transport. Intraluminal impedance allows non-radiological monitoring of movement of oesophageal liquids. AIMS: To evaluate the relevance of IOM during oesophageal <b>volume</b> and chemical <b>clearance</b> using combined pH impedance measurements. SUBJECTS: Impedance was validated with fluoroscopy to study <b>volume</b> <b>clearance</b> in three healthy subjects. Acid clearance tests were performed in 10 healthy subjects in the upright and supine positions, before and after oesophageal peristaltic disruption with sildenafil 50 mg. METHODS: After instillation of an acid bolus, simultaneous manometry, pH, and impedance were used to study oesophageal motility, chemical <b>clearance,</b> and <b>volume</b> <b>clearance,</b> respectively. RESULTS: Impedance allowed assessment of <b>volume</b> <b>clearance</b> accurately, showing a strong correlation with fluoroscopy (r(2) = 0. 89). Sildenafil provoked a graded impairment in oesophageal motility in healthy subjects without affecting saliva secretion. In the upright position, <b>volume</b> <b>clearance</b> was slightly prolonged only with severe IOM (> 80 % abnormal peristaltic sequences). In the supine position, severe IOM significantly prolonged chemical and <b>volume</b> <b>clearance.</b> Moderate IOM (30 - 80 % abnormal peristalsis) had no effect. With normal peristalsis and moderate IOM, clearance times were similar in the upright and supine positions. Severe IOM however had {{a greater impact on}} clearance in the supine than in the upright position. CONCLUSION: Ineffective oesophageal motility has little effect on oesophageal clearance during upright acid reflux. With supine reflux, only severe IOM is associated with prolonged oesophageal clearance. status: publishe...|$|R

There was no correlation between indocyanine green <b>clearance</b> and liver <b>volume.</b> These results suggest that in non-medicated subjects some of the difference in antipyrine clearance is due to difference in functional hepatic parenchymal mass and that phenobarbitone increases the drug metabolising capacity per unit of hepatic mass but not total liver size...|$|R

40|$|The rotary {{compressor}} with rolling piston {{is a widely}} used compressor with less <b>clearance</b> <b>volume,</b> while it is minimized from normal scale to meso or micro scale, the input and exit ports dimension is limited by port requirement and lead to a certain <b>clearance</b> <b>volume,</b> therefore, keeping or improving its volume efficiency is an important issue. Although rolling piston compressor {{is a kind of}} compact structure compressor, the existence of the <b>clearance</b> <b>volume</b> is inevitable in a compressor, the more the <b>clearance</b> <b>volume,</b> the lower the volumetric efficiency of compressor. The overflow is a method to improve the volumetric efficiency of a compressor which had been discussed in wankel compressor, in the overflowing process the clearance space with high pressure is connected directly with the space with lower pressure, mostly that is in the moment, one of the chambers in the {{rotary compressor}} {{is at the end of}} the exhaust process, and another chamber is at the sucking stage or the initial compression process. The gas pressure in the <b>clearance</b> <b>volume</b> is visibly higher than that in the compression chamber. The high-pressure gas in the <b>clearance</b> <b>volume</b> flows into the compression cylinder via a certain way; this flow considerably increases the pressure in the compression cylinder and decreases the pressure in the <b>clearance</b> <b>volume.</b> Thus, the intake and exhaust times means to be extended, and the volumetric efficiency and the cooling capacity of the compressor can be substantially enhanced. In this paper, we introduce the effect of input and exit dimensions on the volume efficiency of rolling piston compressor, and the overflow design on a rolling piston compressor that fully uses the high-pressure gas in the <b>clearance</b> <b>volume,</b> and discuss its effect on the performance of a compressor by theoretical analyses. Usually, the coefficient of performance of a vapor refrigeration cycle with the compressor overflow has a certain decrease compared with the conventional compressor, but the volumetric efficiency of the compressor with overflow and the cooling capacity of the thermodynamic cycle recesses are visibly higher than those of the conventional compressor in terms of the same operation and dimension parameters. The overflow has beneficial effect on miniaturizing the compresso...|$|E

One aspect of engine performance is considered in great detail, namely the combustion performance at increased <b>clearance</b> <b>volume.</b> This aspect was of particular interest because variable compression ratio (VCR) systems normally operate by varying the <b>clearance</b> <b>volume.</b> The investigation relied upon results obtained both from experimental and computer simulating models. The experimental tests were carried out using a single-cylinder direct-injection diesel engine, under simulated turbocharged conditions at a reduced compression ratio.

Scavenging the <b>clearance</b> <b>volume</b> by using a valve overlap of 145 degrees and an inlet-air boost pressure of approximately 2 1 / 2 inches of mercury produced a net increase in performance for clear exhaust operation of 33 percent over that obtained with normal valve timing and the same boost pressure.

40|$|AIM: The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to characterize age-related changes in lamivudine pharmacokinetics in children and evaluate lamivudine exposure, followed by dose recommendations for subgroups in which target steady state area under the daily plasma concentration-time curve (AUC 0 - 24 h) is not reached. METHODS: Population pharmacokinetic modelling was performed in NONMEM using data from two model-building datasets and two external datasets [n = 180 (age 0. 4 - 18 years, body weight 3. 4 - 60. 5 kg); 2061 samples (median 12 per child); daily oral dose 60 - 300 mg (3. 9 - 17. 6 mg kg- 1) ]. Steady state AUC 0 - 24 h was calculated per individual (adult target 8. 9 mg. h l- 1). RESULTS: A two-compartment model with sequential zero order and first order absorption best described the data. Apparent <b>clearance</b> and central <b>volume</b> of distribution (% RSE) were 13. 2 l h- 1 (4. 2 %) and 38. 9 l (7. 0 %) for a median individual of 16. 6 kg, respectively. Bodyweight was identified as covariate on apparent <b>clearance</b> and <b>volume</b> of distribution using power functions (exponents 0. 506 (20. 2 %) and 0. 489 (32. 3 %), respectively). The external evaluation supported the predictive ability of the final model. In 94. 5 % and 35. 8 % of the children with a body weight > 14 kg and < 14 kg, respectively, the target AUC 0 - 24 h was reached. CONCLUSION: Bodyweight best predicted the developmental changes in apparent lamivudine <b>clearance</b> and <b>volume</b> of distribution. For children aged 5 months- 18 years with a body weight < 14 kg, the dose should be increased from 8 to 10 mg kg- 1 day- 1 if the adult target for AUC 0 - 24 h is aimed for.
