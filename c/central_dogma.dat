The extent of reduction in effective interface viscosity increases with decreasing temperature and polymer film thickness. Concomitant with the reduction in effective viscosity we also observe apparent divergence of the wave vector dependent hydrodynamic interaction function of these colloids with an anomalous power law exponent of ~ 2 at the lowest temperatures and film thickness studied. Such strong hydrodynamic interactions are not expected for polymeric colloidal motion in polymer melts. We suggest hydrodynamics, especially slip present at the colloid–polymer interface which determines the observed reduction in interface viscosity and presence of strong hydrodynamic interactions...|$|R

40|$|For the {{majority}} of the 20 th century, one of the <b>central</b> <b>dogmas</b> of linguistics was that, {{at the level of the}} lexicon, the relationship between words and meanings is arbitrary: there is nothing about the word ‘dog’ for example that makes it a particularly good label for a dog. However, in recent years it has become increasingly recognized that non-arbitrary associations between words and meanings make up a small, but potentially important portion of the lexicon. This thesis focuses on exploring the effect that non-arbitrary associations between words and meanings have on language learning and the structure of the lexicon. Based on a critical analysis of the existing literature, and the results of a number of experiments presented here, I suggest that the overall prevalence and developmental timing of two forms of non-arbitrariness in the lexicon– systematicity and motivatedness – is shaped by the pressure for languages to be learnable while remaining expressive. The effect of pressures for learnability and expressivity have been recognized to have important implications for the structure of language generally, but have so far not been applied to explain structure at the level of the lexicon. The central claim presented in this dissertation is that features of the perceptual and cognitive organization of humans results in specific types of associations between words and meanings being easier for naïve learners to acquire than others, and that the pressure for languages to be learnable results in lexica that leverage these human biases. Taking advantage of these biases, however, induces constraints on the structure of the lexicon that, left unchecked, might limit its expressivity or penalize subsequent learning. Thus, lexica are structured such that early-acquired words are able to leverage these biases while avoiding the limitations imposed by those biases when they are extended past a certain point...|$|R
40|$|This Article {{addresses}} a curious {{gap in the}} theory of intellectual property. One of the <b>central</b> <b>dogmas</b> in both the legal and economic literatures is that patents, copyrights and trademarks constitute separate forms of protection, each serving different purposes and designed to operate independently of the others. By challenging this dogma, however, this Article shows that certain combinations of intellectual property protection give rise to important synergies. When a patentee can develop brand loyalty among its customers, the existence of trademark protection allows her to extend its protection even after her patent expires, and thereby earn higher profits than would be possible without such leverage. Paradoxically, our model reveals that this patent/trademark leverage is actually efficiency-enhancing: it gives patentees an incentive to price less monopolistically than they would if their protection terminated upon the expiration of the patent. Importantly, this is not a purely theoretical result: several case studies demonstrate that firms actually do combine patent and trademark protection in much the way we describe. We show that the same synergies are at work when trade-secrecy is combined with trademark protection. The unique perspective we develop in the Article has important descriptive, normative, and methodological implications. Descriptively, we show that the deadweight loss of patent and trade secrecy protection is lower than is commonly believed, and that incentives to innovate are higher. Normatively, we call for a reversal of the prevailing judicial hostility to combining patent and trademark protection, and explain how the law can take advantage of leveraged patents to improve the tradeoff between dynamic and static efficiencies in innovation policy. For example, we demonstrate how policymakers can shorten patent protection, while simultaneously increasing incentives to innovate. Moreover, we design a separating mechanism that accomplishes this desirable result without imposing undue informational burdens on policymakers. Finally, we highlight the need for an integrated analysis of intellectual property. When synergies exist, exclusive focus on the parts often leads to an incomplete and distorted perception of the whole...|$|R
