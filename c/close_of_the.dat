In March 1907, the new club was {{admitted}} into the Pennsylvania–Ohio–Maryland League, a Division D league. By the <b>close</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 1907 season, the club had seized the championship of the eight-team P-O-M league. In 1908, Hogan's final season as manager, {{the team was}} christened as the Zanesville Infants and joined the Central League. Further {{research is needed to}} determine the Zanesville Infants' league ranking at the <b>close</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 1908 season, but available information shows that the team neither won the championship nor placed as a runner-up.|$|E

40|$|The project {{deals with}} <b>the</b> <b>closing</b> <b>of</b> a Danish {{military}} barrack in <b>the</b> town <b>of</b> Sønderborg. We analyse <b>the</b> consequences <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>closing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> barrack, in <b>the</b> sense <b>of</b> which sociological impact <b>the</b> <b>closing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> barracks has on <b>the</b> citizens <b>of</b> Sønderborg, because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> huge cultural value and historic meaning <b>of</b> <b>the</b> barracks in the city. In extension of this, {{we have used}} Pierre Bourdieu and Robert D. Putnam and their theories about capital forms, especially symbolic capital and social bridging/bonding. Furthermore the project deals with another significant and important question about <b>the</b> <b>closing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> barracks. It is the question {{about what to do}} with the barrack now, and how you can use it in the future. Therefore we include Richard Florida and his theory about the creative class, and how they create growth and reduce the economical impact associated with <b>the</b> <b>closing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> barrack and ensure the city’s cohesion. The method is a comparative case study that includes a comparative analysis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>closing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> famous barrack in <b>the</b> city <b>of</b> Næstved 10 years ago...|$|R
