5|$|During the arc, Rukia's past is explored. She died as {{an infant}} and was sent to Soul Society with her older sister, Hisana. Though Hisana {{initially}} tried to protect and provide for Rukia, she could not ensure her own survival while <b>caring</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> baby as well, and thus abandoned Rukia. As Rukia grew up, she befriended Renji Abarai, and entered the Soul Reaper academy, where she was adopted into the Kuchiki family. One year prior to the adoption, Hisana died after asking her husband, Byakuya, to find and adopt Rukia as his sister. This remains unknown to Rukia until Byakuya confesses it to her. When she was accepted into the 13th Division, Rukia befriended the lieutenant of her division, Kaien Shiba, and trained under him. During {{the course of a}} mission, Kaien was irreversibly possessed by a hollow and Rukia inadvertently kills him.|$|E

The {{purpose of this study}} is to describe the current status of foster <b>care</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> temporary period and detection the motives that lead people to perform foster <b>care</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> temporary period. The theoretical part focuses on motivation in the beginning.

The practical part includes qualitative research through semi-structured interview. The interviews are focused at mapping the important data of family and personal history of respondents, their motivation and experiences with foster <b>care</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> temporary time and life satisfaction. The results of the research show, that motives can be divided according to whether they are present at the beginning of the foster <b>care</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> temporary period or during foster care. The main motive is present in both cases. The results show that the main motive is to achieve meaningfulness (by helping children), which can have a direct impact on improving the quality of life.

40|$|This brief {{analyzes}} employed parents’ {{access to}} {{five or more}} paid sick days annually to <b>care</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> sick child in 2008. Using data from the 2008 National Study of the Changing Workforce collected by the Families and Work Institute (the most recent data available in the series), authors Kristin Smith and Andrew Schaefer analyze differences in access between employed mothers and fathers by demographic and work-related characteristics. They report that, in 2008, more than one-half— 52 percent—of employed parents lacked access to at least five paid sick days to <b>care</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> sick child, and lower-earning parents had the least access. Although employed mothers and fathers have similar access to paid sick days to <b>care</b> <b>for</b> their sick children, mothers more often miss work to <b>care</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> sick child. Employed parents with paid sick days to <b>care</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> sick child are 1. 9 {{times more likely to}} be very satisfied with their job than those without this access...|$|R

25|$|Various {{improvements}} {{were also}} made {{to health care}} provision and coverage during the social-liberal coalition’s time in office. In 1974, domestic aid during in-patient or in-patient cures was established, sick pay to compensate for wages lost while <b>caring</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> child was introduced, and the time-limit to in-patient care was removed. That same year, the cover of rehabilitation services was increased, together with the cover of dental and orthodontic services. Health insurance coverage was extended to self-employed agricultural workers in 1972, and to students and the disabled in 1975. in 1971, an International Transactions Tax Law was passed.|$|E
25|$|Terence Steven McQueen {{was born}} on March 24, 1930, at St. Francis Hospital in Beech Grove, Indiana, a suburb of Indianapolis. His father, William Terence McQueen, was a stunt pilot for a barnstorming flying circus who left McQueen's mother, Julia Ann (a.k.a. Jullian; née Crawford), six months after meeting her. Julia {{allegedly}} was an alcoholic. Unable to cope with <b>caring</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> small child, she left him with her parents (Victor and Lillian) in Slater, Missouri, in 1933. As the Great Depression set in shortly thereafter, McQueen and his grandparents moved in with Lillian's brother Claude at his farm in Slater. McQueen was raised Catholic.|$|E

25|$|Roman {{women were}} present at most festivals and cult observances. Some rituals {{specifically}} required {{the presence of}} women, but their active participation was limited. As a rule women did not perform animal sacrifice, the central rite of most major public ceremonies. In addition to the public priesthood of the Vestals, some cult practices were reserved for women only. The rites of the Bona Dea excluded men entirely. Because women enter the public record less frequently than men, their religious practices are less known, and even family cults were headed by the paterfamilias. A host of deities, however, are associated with motherhood. Juno, Diana, Lucina, and specialized divine attendants presided over the life-threatening act of giving birth and the perils of <b>caring</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> baby {{at a time when}} the infant mortality rate was as high as 40 percent.|$|E
25|$|One of the {{earliest}} petitions on record dates to 1644. A group of eleven petitioners, not including their children, entreated the Council of New Netherland for freedom, based on the claim {{that it was impossible}} for them to support their growing families under slavery. The Dutch West India Company released these slaves on a plan of half-freedom; this allowed slaves their liberty in exchange for payment of an annual tributary to the company. During early America and the first two decades of the colonial period, slavery had not become a racial caste within the area of Dutch authority. The Dutch West India Company freed many slaves between 1644 and 1664, when they lost control of their colony to England. These early petitioners did not base their claim for freedom on ethnicity but on the monetary realities of living in slavery and <b>caring</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> family. This line of argument quickly faded from the records.|$|E

500|$|It is {{not clear}} whether the baby was Carrie or another baby of Laura's, or what became of the child. William Bittle and Gilbert Geis wrote in 1964 that Laura had been <b>caring</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> baby while in jail, and had the child with her when she was taken from her cell. They quoted a woman who had seen either the lynching or its aftermath, and who said that Laura had placed the baby on the ground: [...] "After they had hung them up, those men just walked off and left that baby lying there. One of my neighbors was there, and she picked the baby up and brought it to town, and we took care of it. It's all grown up now and lives here." ...|$|E

Peter is forced to shoot Broyles, but manages to pull the gun off-center so that the agent is only hit in the shoulder. After Peter crashes the car that both he and Tyler are in, Tyler is brought {{unconscious}} into custody.

She also supported him through his Non-Hodgkin lymphoma diagnosis, and enlisting his support in illegally proving a patient's death through negligence. In the show's tenth series, Maddy also formed a fast respect for the new head of the hospital's Acute Assessment Unit, Linden Cullen (Duncan Pow). Pow ruled out a romance between the two characters, however, stating: [...] "They're protective of each other, but they're more like brother and sister than anything else. I don't think he's ready for the relationship merry-go-round at Holby just yet". He added that: [...] "Any man would be a fool to turn down Maddy, but Linden wants his wife back". Similarly, Lewington has assessed that neither Sam nor Linden are Maddy's ideal man, and instead she is [...] "waiting for a new hunk!" ...|$|E

500|$|The episode's action {{revolves}} around the practical joke involving the cake and, in particular, viewers' attempts to guess what has caused injury, as {{they know that the}} paramedic will be coming. Both Angela and the alcoholic Carol are [...] "ticking time-bomb". Angela is the central character, and is similar to a more anxious version of Sue Brockman, Skinner's character from Outnumbered. She is stressed and obsessive-compulsive, but aspirational, fastidious, and dutiful. The comedy critic Bruce Dessau compared Ashbourne's characterisation of Carol to Elizabeth Taylor's characterisation in Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?; as the episode progresses, Carol becomes increasingly abusive. Commentators variously described Pat as [...] "appalling", [...] "tiresome", an [...] "irritating tit" [...] and [...] "an insufferable booby". For Chris Bennion, writing in The Independent, Pat's character is more complex: [...] "Behind Pat's cheesy jokes and schoolboy tomfoolery lies a desperately sad and dignified man, standing by and <b>caring</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> wife whose love for him has long gone." [...] Pat and Carol, for Pemberton and Shearsmith, have a more honest relationship than Jim and Angela, despite the problems in their relationship.|$|E
500|$|There {{was in any}} case, as art {{historian}} Jeanette Hoorn wryly observed, [...] "no market for post-impressionist painting in outback New South Wales in the 1920s". Rix Nicholas sought to build on her existing success and often focussed on portraits, while her approach to her subject matter became [...] "more and more didactic". Women were frequently portrayed, both as rural workers (as in The Fair Musterer) and in domestic or family scenes (as in On The Hilltop). Several images, such as On the Hilltop and Spring Afternoon, Knockalong portray women <b>caring</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> young son in a rural setting. Her most [...] "stereotypically feminine" [...] work was The Summer House, which shows two of Rix Nicholas's friends with some freshly cut flowers, in a setting that, unlike most of her works of the period, screened out the surrounding landscape. It was a picture about which Rix Nicholas was never convinced and which she never publicly displayed. Yet it {{has become one of}} her best known works, its easy acceptance consistent with the way reviewers in the 1930s pigeon-holed her work in terms of conventional gender roles.|$|E

[...] Caroline was <b>caring</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> young child, William Austin, who was alleged to be her child by another man. [...] The Prince of Wales hoped that what was termed [...] "the Delicate Investigation" [...] would turn up evidence of adultery that would permit him to get a divorce, and forbade Charlotte to see her mother. Charlotte was aware of the investigation. [...] The ten-year-old was deeply hurt when mother and daughter caught sight of each other in the park, and Caroline, obedient to the Prince's command to have no contact with Charlotte, pretended not to see her. [...] To George's bitter disappointment, the investigating committee found no evidence Caroline had had a second child, though it noted that the Princess's behaviour was very much open to misconstruction. [...] The King, who was fond of Caroline, had refused to see her during the investigation, but began to receive her again afterwards. [...] After the conclusion of the Delicate Investigation, the Prince reluctantly allowed Charlotte to see her mother again, with the condition that William Austin not be a playmate.|$|E

500|$|Taylor {{explained}} that Janeway views her holonovel {{as a way}} to experience a life separate from the stress and responsibilities of being a captain. She felt that in Janeway's imagination <b>caring</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> family serves as her primary motivation for assuming the role of Davenport rather than the desire to quench [...] "an intellectual curiosity about a period of history". In her book Hamlet on the Holodeck: The Future of Narrative in Cyberspace, Janet Horowitz Murray contrasted Janeway Lambda one with the holonovels used by the male crew members. Murray noted that Janeway immerses herself in domestic chores and does not pursue a narrative revolving around constant action, while the men find enjoyment in [...] "violent conflict that [...] resolved within a single Star Trek episode". She listed Janeway's appreciation of the gothic novel with Captain Jean-Luc Picard's (Patrick Stewart)'s interest in film noir, Lieutenant Commander Data's (Brent Spiner) identification with Sherlock Holmes, and Dr. Julian Bashir's (Alexander Siddig) preference for James Bond. [...] A. Bowdoin Van Riper, a historian specializing in modern science and technology, wrote that Janeway Lambda one was the only time a holonovel used by a woman was shown on screen, and identified Janeway as [...] "the only Starfleet officer whose fantasies are of home, hearth, and children".|$|E

40|$|Main goal of {{the thesis}} was to map out the {{specifics}} of nursing <b>care</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> patient with a nutritious stoma. Three research questions {{have been identified in}} connection to this goal. First research question was focused on mapping out the nursing <b>care</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> patient prior applying the nutritious stoma. Second research question was focusing on nursing <b>care</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> patient while the nutritious stoma is being applied, and the last third question researches the nursing <b>care</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> patient after applying of the nutritious stoma. The empirical part of the bachelor's thesis was processed through a qualitative research analysis, which was carried out by a form of semi-structured interview. The semi-structured interview was divided into three parts. First part focused on basic identification data, second part focused on percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy and third part on percutaneous endoscopic jejunostomy. Collected data was processed with an open coding method "pencil paper". Research file consists of general nurses working at a neurological, gastroenterological, standard internal department and intensive care department at Hospital České Budějovice and at the department of long term intensive <b>care</b> <b>for</b> patients at Hospital Třebíč. The results of the thesis are divided into a separate categories which are: establishment of nutritious stoma, immediate nursing care about nutritious stoma after establishment, nursing of nutritious stoma, applying of fluids into nutritious stoma, applying of nourishments into nutritious stoma, applying of medicine into nutritious stoma, recording of care into documentation and education of the patient about nutritious stoma. The thesis provides an overview of the problematics of nursing <b>care</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> patient with nutritious stoma.
