The description, interpretation and transformation of types as part of an "imitative" approach to the architectural project is the main subject of an epistemology of practice as suggested by Donald Schön, and supports the exercise of compositional invention. In this perspective, figurative imagination is intertwined with a <b>collective</b> <b>catalogue</b> of paradigmatic works of architecture, which becomes a set of elective constraints progressively incorporated to the practitioner's repertoire...|$|R

40|$|Based on the {{hypothesis}} that the common pattern relating the different libraries of UniversidadNacional de La Plata (UNLP) for the construction of the class signature is the use of Universal Decimal Classification (UDC), and that there is an important dispersion in the elements composing the topographic signature, there was a recounting in the academic libraries to research about the ways to build the topographic signature for the order of the bibliographic material on the shelf. There was a sample of the topographic signatures of the “Roble” <b>collective</b> <b>catalogue.</b> The differences and similarities found were analyzed. There was an interview for the ones responsible for the technical processes of each library to ask about the causes for the differences found. It was proven that, even though most of the libraries use UDC to generate the class signature, they also use different editions with dissimilar use criteria. Also, {{in the formation of the}} topographic signature, the criterion used varies notoriously from one library to the other, making difficult to find coincidence in the assigned topographic signatures.

Sin embargo, en los archivos y bibliotecas de nuestro país existen {{al menos}} 19 manuscritos y 90 obras impresas localizadas (65 de ellos incunables), según el Catálogo Colectivo del Patrimonio Bibliográfico Español.

A través de estas páginas se pone de manifiesto que el número de obras conservadas de Beauvais es importante, pero más el hecho de que su obra y pensamiento, unida a la tradición clásica y cristiana previa, se ha proyectado en multitud de autores hispanos desde el siglo XIII hasta nuestros días.

In order to detect the single journal heads, the team has referred to the bibliographical indexes (such as ISSN, Ulrich, The Italian Periodical publications Catalogue, BNI, CASSI, Serfile) as well as the national <b>collective</b> <b>catalogues</b> (such as ACNP, SBN e PEB). The data collected so far have been input in a database, thus being checked with the co-operation of publishers and librarians. Furthermore, for each single publication, each subject area covered as well as the type of user has been under analysis. Once the body of the Italian journals has been identified, the presence within the most remarkable international databanks of this field and their level of coverage (cover to cover or selective) has been examined. As a result, not even half of the Italian journals has proved to be indexed by the databanks. Indeed, the team has deemed it vital to compare the parameters adopted between the journals indexed and the whole body of the Italian journals and, when necessary, {{on the basis of a}} statistically identified sample. The parameters to be examined are the following ones: • Language (title and abstract in English) • Scientific or editorial commitee (either national or international) • Publisher • Frequency of publication and regularity of a journal • The access to the TOC, abstract and full-text in internet • ISSN The analysis of the above-mentioned parameters allows to identify the journal heads which show adequate standards to be input in the databank, which is the sheer object of the project, and which actually comply to the conditions to share an international visibility.

40|$|Library {{cooperation}} in Germany {{is a tradition}} that predates the emergence of internet. This is explained partly {{by the absence of}} a “classic” National Library, as a single central institution. This absence has been replaced by the three major German libraries, which have distributed among themselves the function of a national library. The other reason for this tradition is the Federal political system and the responsibility of each of the Federal States in cultural matters, including libraries. This meant that at both regional and interregional levels, there has traditionally been a solid cooperation, at least among scientific libraries. Later, the arrival of automation has facilitated the production of <b>collective</b> regional <b>catalogues.</b> With the entrance into the so-called “digital age”, the tendency to cooperation has been intensified, so that today one can talk about an “age of cooperation”. One example of the ease and assiduousness of this cooperation are the new services which, in most cases, supply several libraries together; others are the specialised virtual libraries, the consortium acquisition of digital media user licences, including national licences for certain items, and the cooperative creation of a long term national digital archive...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} about two {{important}} Italian web-resources for document delivery: ACNP (i. e. Archivio Collettivo Nazionale dei Periodici), the <b>collective</b> serials Italian <b>catalogue,</b> and NILDE, a document transmission network based on Internet technologies and standardized operations. Our library {{is part of the}} database of ACNP since 2002, which has allowed us to better exploit our resources and to meet successfully our users’ requests. Results have been progressively improving from the end of 2003, when we joined the NILDE project. Participation in this network has supported the working flow of our activities in the entire DD process – from the request to the delivery of a document – considerably elevating the Document Delivery Service (DDS) management performance. To show you how we can obtain such operative results, we will describe both the structure of the <b>collective</b> serials Italian <b>catalogue</b> (ACNP) and the architecture of the e-mail/web gateway server used for NILDE. ACNP, developed by Italian National Research Council (CNR) and by the University of Bologna, has a Web OPAC where users can retrieve serials from the Italian libraries participating to the project – presently rated to be 2510. Even though ACNP assures by itself an efficient exchange of the documents, NILDE permits further costs reduction, time shortening and simplification of the documents transmission procedure. NILDE is a web-based Document Delivery Service that has been developed by the Research Area of Bologna Central Library in order to experiment the use and to suggest a model of DD service promoting inter-library mutual exchange and cooperation procedure. The high performance of the Network is possible especially because NILDE is accessible through ACNP, allowing the librarian to check which libraries participate to the Network among those that have the document he needs. Once checked the datum, the librarian can find out which library offers the best conditions and finalize his request accordingly, simply clicking on the link to NILDE...|$|R
40|$|One of {{the factors}} {{limiting}} agricultural development in ACP countries is the difficult access to information on research activities and development experiences. The identification of such information sources constitutes the first step towards {{a better understanding of}} agricultural sciences and techniques. Since CTA's prime objective is to facilitate access to agricultural information in ACP countries, it has undertaken the publication of a series of directories on information sources in the field of agriculture and rural development. The first directory dealt with information sources on tropical agriculture in EEC countries. The second which has just been published in English and French, deals with agricultural information sources in ACP countries. Produced with the cooperation of CAB-lnternational in the UK and the International Documentation Centre for Agriculture in Hot Regions (CIDARC) in France, it fulfills two objectives. First, it is a guide for researchers, trainers, extension workers, planners and documentalists engaged in information searches. Second, it helps to promote information exchanges among different ACP countries and between them and EEC countries. It can also help decision-makers to plan their national policies. This directory includes 337 agricultural information services (libraries, documentation centres, bibliographic databases and documentation networks), research institutes, teaching establishments and development organizations in ACP countries. It deals with all agricultural sectors: agronomic research, teaching and extension work, rural sociology and economics, animal and vegetable production, forestry, aquatic sciences and fishing, agricultural equipment, natural resources, food and nutrition sciences and the environment (a classification of these information services by field is given in Table 1). Apart from the directory itself, which is classified by country in alphabetical order, this publication includes an index of the main fields covered by each centre and a list of acronyms. Each entry includes the name of the information service followed by that of its parent organization, its address, date of establishment, and the name and title of the person to contact in addition to the staff numbers. It specifies the field of interest of the centre, its geographical coverage, its documentation resources, its users, the goods and services that it provides, its budget and its documentation cooperation service. The index was inspired primarily by that used by AGROVOC, the multilingual thesaurus of agricultural terminology and the categories used by AGRIS. The detailed analysis of the data contained in this directory reveals the current situation of agricultural documentation in ACP countries. It shows that the first agricultural information services date from the last century. The Jamaican Ministry of Agriculture created its national agricultural library in 1876. Since the 1920 s, the number of such centres has increased rapidly. At the current rate, one can hope to see more than 500 agricultural information sources in ACP countries by the year 2000 A geographical breakdown of this data reveals a strong development in West Africa which hosts more than 36 % of the agricultural information services of ACP countries (see Table 3). Documentation centres appear to be concentrated mainly in the capitals to the detriment of rural areas which would make much-later use of such information. These centres offer traditional services: providing bibliographic searches, summary reviews, lists of documents received, and catalogues of publications and periodicals as well as services for selected diffusion of information and for bibliographic searches. However, the summaries and progress reports receive relatively little attention {{despite the fact that they}} are highly regarded by 'information consumers'. The same is the case for the services of consolidation, evaluation and updating of information. It is true that researchers, teachers and students, who are the main users of these information services, are capable of doing such summaries and analyses themselves. Nevertheless, the demand for summarized information remains high. The dearth of such material is due in part to the lack of competent staff The collections of these information services are, generally speaking, relatively modest. Some centres, however, do have significant documentation resources. On average, each one contains 3217 books, 1534 reports, 375 publications of the parent organization 169 periodical titles and 495 microfiches. As far as equipment is concerned even though ACP countries are the least computerized, it is reassuring to learn that nearly a third of the information services have microcomputers although of many different brands. This diversity of equipment, which also applies to software, is no doubt a result of supply and demand but it creates problems of compatability which makes it difficult to exchange data needed for documentary cooperation. An analysis of such data also reveals that there is a greater reproduction capacity than previously thought. If only 7. 4 % of the information services have their own microfilm reproduction workshops, 55 % of the centres have microfilm or microfiche readers. Finally, the most significant phenomenon in the development of information services in ACP countries over the last decade has been the emergence of documentation networks and the exchange of information and experiences. All of the synergies and economies of scale have been exploited: interlibrary loans development of <b>collective</b> <b>catalogues</b> for periodicals and reference works, standardization of working methods, and promotion of the exploitation of their documentation capital. National sectoral networks have emerged in the Congo (REDICA), Cote d'lvoire (REDACT) and Senegal (REDAS). At regional level, the approach taken has been the establishment of a network reflecting the major socioeconomic and geopolitical concerns. One notes the presence of PADIS, oriented towards socioeconomic development in Africa of POPIN-AFRICA oriented towards the population problems of this continent, and RESADOC in Mali which is primarily concerned with problems related to drought, desertification and environmental protection. At the international level, AGRIS and CARIS remain the main global information systems. The establishment of these networks, no matter what their level, in conjunction with the use of computerized facilities, clearly shows the vitality of the documentation supply in ACP countries. It is certain, however, that these structures remain fragile and do not get sufficient attention or support. A new item must be added to the priorities of these centres: the analysis of agricultural information to provide products that respond better to the real needs of users for summarized documents. In this field, as in many others, the availability of human resources will be the determining factor. For more details, contact: Thiendou Niang. Director Documentation Service CTAOne {{of the factors}} limiting agricultural development in ACP countries is the difficult access to information on research activities and development experiences. The identification of such information sources constitutes the first step towards a [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Mammalian hair {{is readily}} shed and {{transferred}} to persons or objects during contact; this property renders hair {{as one of the}} most ubiquitous and prevalent evidence type encountered in forensic investigations and at ancient burial sites. The durability and stability of hair ensures their survival for millennia; their status as a privileged repository of viable genetic material consolidates their value as a biological substrate. The aims of this thesis are to showcase the wealth, and breadth, of information that may be gleaned from these unique structures and address the current problem regarding the mis-identification of animal hairs. Despite the similar appearance of human and animal hairs, the expertise required to accurately interpret their respective structures requires significantly different skill sets. Chapter Two in this thesis discusses the consequences of mis-identification of hair structures due to lack of competency or adequate training in regards to hair examiners and discusses some of the myths and misconceptions associated with microscopy of hairs. Hairs are resilient structures capable of surviving for millennia as exemplified by extinct megafauna hairs; however, they are not totally immune to deleterious effects of environmental insults or biodegradation. There is a paucity of morphological data available illustrating the deleterious effects of biological agents on hairs. This void is filled through the comprehensive review of biodegradation of hair in Chapter 3 which showcases, for the first time, a <b>collective</b> visual <b>catalogue</b> of the destructive effects caused by an elite group of biological agents. These effects were evident in hairs from prehistoric, ancient and modern human and animal hairs. During the course of this study hair morphologies were observed which challenged current paradigms in relation to their genesis. The results of the present study unequivocally demonstrate that hair structures, previously characterised as genetic in nature, are due to the effects of biodegradation. Furthermore, this body of work is the first to record that morphological characteristics previously ascribed to taphonomy (post-mortem insults), also occur in hairs from the living. The implications of the interpretation of hair structures in forensic investigations are discussed in greater detail in Chapter 3. Chapter four represents the first demonstration of the advantages of adopting a multidisciplinary approach to hair examination. This chapter presents a detailed microscopical audit of extinct megafauna hair that was the remains of a larger hair sample previously consumed in more destructive analyses (molecular analyses and radio carbon dating). One of the most significant morphological finds of this work was the presence of unusual structural features, not previously recorded, that may have been central to the survival of extinct megafauna. Lastly, Chapter Five introduces the concept of Next Generation Sequencing (NGS also referred to as massive parallel sequencing) to investigate the forensic potential of human hairs on the basis of transfer of their respective bacterial ‘profiles or signatures’. Taken together, this body of work presents fresh approaches to the manner in which mammalian hairs could be processed in the future and demonstrates the benefits of multi-disciplinary approaches to their examination. Bacterial DNA profiles, derived from human hair using NGS technologies, may prove to be a valuable future addition to the forensic molecular toolkit. Furthermore, this present study challenges current paradigms regarding the interpretation of microscopic post-mortem artifacts that occur on ancient and modern mammalian hairs...|$|R
