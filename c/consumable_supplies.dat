50|$|Perhaps {{the primary}} outcome of South African {{penetration}} of the Comoran economy during the Abdallah regime was the development of tourism. Although South African investors built or renovated several hotels during the 1980s (with assistance from the South African and Comoran governments), only one resort, the 182-room Galawa Beach on Njazidja, was operating by late 1992. About 100 other hotel rooms were available on the islands. Political instability, a declining South African interest in the islands as the apartheid regime was disassembled and other tropical tourism venues became more welcoming, {{and the need to}} import most construction materials and <b>consumable</b> <b>supplies</b> inhibited the growth of tourism, despite the islands' physical beauty. Nonetheless, in large part thanks to Galawa Beach, which had been closed during 1990, tourism increased from 7,627 visitors in 1990 to 16,942 in 1991. Most of these tourists were Europeans, primarily French (see Historical Setting, this ch.).|$|E
5000|$|Based on {{iconographic}} {{evidence from}} coins, Morrison and Coates {{have determined that}} the Punic triremes in the 5th and early 4th centuries BC were largely similar to their Greek counterparts, most likely including an outrigger. From the mid-4th century, however, at {{about the time the}} quinquereme was introduced in Phoenicia, there is evidence of ships without outriggers. This would have necessitated a different oar arrangement, with the middle level placed more inwards, as well as a different construction of the hull, with side-decks attached to it. From the middle of the 3rd century BC onwards, Carthaginian [...] "fives" [...] display a separate [...] "oar box" [...] that contained the rowers and that was attached to the main hull. This development of the earlier model entailed further modifications, meaning that the rowers would be located above deck, and essentially on the same level. This would allow the hull to be strengthened, and have increased carrying capacity in <b>consumable</b> <b>supplies,</b> as well as improve the ventilation conditions of the rowers, an especially important factor in maintaining their stamina, and thereby improving the ship's maintainable speed.

EVOTECH Endoscope Cleaner and Reprocessor (ECR) is approved for fully automated {{cleaning and disinfection}} whereas AERs require manual cleaning prior to the high-level disinfection procedure. The purpose of this economic evaluation {{was to determine the}} cost-efficiency of the ECR versus AER methods of endoscopy reprocessing in an actual practice setting. Methods A time and motion study was conducted at a Canadian hospital to collect data on the personnel resources and <b>consumable</b> <b>supplies</b> costs {{associated with the use of}} EVOTECH ECR versus manual cleaning followed by AER with Medivators DSD- 201. Reprocessing of all endoscopes was observed and timed for both reprocessor types over three days. Laboratory staff members were interviewed regarding the consumption and cost of all disposable supplies and equipment. Exact Wilcoxon rank sum test was used for assessing differences in total cycle reprocessing time. Results Endoscope reprocessing was significantly shorter with the ECR than with manual cleaning followed by AER. The differences in median time were 12. 46 minutes per colonoscope (p Conclusions The EVOTECH ECR was more efficient and less costly to use for the reprocessing of endoscopes than manual cleaning followed by AER disinfection. Although the cost of <b>consumable</b> <b>supplies</b> required to reprocess endoscopes with EVOTECH ECR was slightly higher, the value of the labour time saved with EVOTECH ECR more than offset the additional consumables cost.

40|$|Background: The study {{examined}} the cost variation across 29 high-volume US hospitals and their affiliated orthopaedic surgeons for delivering a primary total knee arthroplasty without major complicating conditions. The hospitals had similar patient demographics, and more than 80 % of them had statistically-similar Medicare risk-adjusted readmission and complication rates. Methods: Hospital and physician personnel costs were calculated using time-driven activity-based costing. <b>Consumable</b> <b>supply</b> costs, such as the prosthetic implant, were calculated using purchase prices, and postacute care costs were measured using either internal costs or external claims as reported by each hospital. Results: Despite having similar patient demographics and readmission and complication rates, {{the average cost of}} care for total knee arthroplasty across the hospitals varied by a factor of about 2 to 1. Even after adjusting for differences in internal labor cost rates, the hospital at the 90 th percentile of cost spent about twice as much as the one at the 10 th percentile of cost.
