Transport of conservative tracers, ie non-reactive ions, is mostly affected by soil physical heterogeneity that causes differences in mobility of different parts of soil solution. Transport of reactive contaminants is affected by both physical and chemical heterogeneity. The objective {{of this study was to}} observe the effects of soil structure and flow velocity on the transport of reactive calcium and sodium ions. Undisturbed southern chernozem and <b>chestnut</b> <b>soil</b> columns were used to monitor the concurrent chloride, calcium and sodium transport in slow-flow and fast-flow breakthrough experiments. Parameters of the advective-dispersive transport were estimated by fitting the advective-dispersive equation to the reduced break-through data. At low velocities, transport seemed to occur in pores having a wide range of effective diameters. Diffusion and slow transport in fine pores caused slow effluent concentration changes at the late stages of the transport. Creating fast flow resulted in a decrease in the proportion of pore space providing the initial breakthrough and in an increase in the proportion of pore space participating in the diffusion-driven mass exchange as compared with the slow-flow transport. Transport of reactive ions was affected by the flow rates in the same way as the transport of the conservative tracers.

40|$|In isotope Cs- 137 tracing studies, it is a premise to {{determine}} suitable Cs- 137 reference inventory (CRI) plots and the CRI values. Owing to the heterogeneous {{spatial distribution of}} Cs- 137 deposition {{in the ground and}} diverse, or even irregular, operations in sampling and testing procedures, CRI determination is usually faced with many difficulties and uncertainties. In addition, more difficulties occur in an investigation of a large-scale region because of time constraints and measurement cost limitations. In this study, traditional CRI acquiring methods were summarized first, and then a new complex scheme was established, involving seven core steps and coupling the model estimate and sample measurement. The above CRI determination methodology was implemented in the central-eastern Inner Mongolia Plateau.

Soil properties and the activities of four enzymes involved in carbon (C), nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) cycling were measured in both bulk soil and microaggregate, and phospholipid fatty acids (PLFAs) were measured in bulk soil. The results indicated that: 1) in bulk soil, N addition significantly decreased beta- 1, 4 -glucosidase (BG) and leucine aminopeptidase (LAP) activities at the treatment amounts of 224, 392 and 560 kg N ha(- 1) yr(- 1), and obviously suppressed beta- 1, 4 -N-acetylglucosaminidase (NAG) activity at the treatment amount of 560 kg N ha(- 1) yr(- 1). N addition enhanced total PLFAs (totPLFAs) and bacterial PLFAs (bacPLFAs) at the treatment amounts of 392 and 560 kg N ha(- 1) yr(- 1), respectively, but fungal PLFAs showed no response to N addition.

40|$|Phosphorus {{is one of}} {{the primary}} {{elements}} essential for plant growth. Recently, Fried and Dean have proposed the “’A’ value concept” which relates the percentage of phosphorus in the plant from the applied fertilizer to the available phosphorus of the soil. The ‘A’ value concept has been used in connection with both field and green house experiments. Since field experiments are costly as well as time consuming, a greenhouse experiment was conducted to study the available phosphorus in several agricultural soils in Nebraska using this concept. The soils selected included typical Prairie, Chernozem and <b>Chestnut</b> <b>soils</b> as well as some intrazonal and azonal soils in Nebraska. The soils represent a wide range in soil conditions: acid to calcareous, sandy to clayey, and high to low in soluble phosphorus and organic matter. The efficacy of ‘A’ values is not altered by this range in soil properties; whereas, many chemical methods for determining available phosphorus are not equally applicable over this entire range. As a consequence, ‘A’ values should provide an excellent means for the calibration of chemical testing methods over this great diversity of soil conditions. Advisor: R. A. Olso...|$|R

40|$|Applying enzymatic {{biocatalysts}} {{based on}} hexahistidine-containing organophosphorus hydrolase (His 6 -OPH) is suggested for the decomposition of chlorpyrifos, which is actively used in agriculture in many countries. The application conditions were optimized {{and the following}} techniques was suggested to ensure the highest efficiency of the enzyme: first, the soil is alkalinized with hydrated calcitic lime Ca(OH) 2, then the enzyme is introduced into the soil at a concentration of 1000 U/kg soil. Non-equilibrium low temperature plasma (NELTP) -modified zeolite is used for immobilization of the relatively inexpensive polyelectrolyte complexes containing the enzyme His 6 -OPH and a polyanionic polymer: poly-l-glutamic acid (PLE 50) or poly-l-aspartic acid (PLD 50). The soil’s humidity is then increased up to 60 – 80 %, the top layer (10 – 30 cm) of soil is thoroughly stirred, and then exposed for 48 – 72 h. The suggested approach ensures 100 % destruction of the pesticide within 72 h in soils containing as much as 100 mg/kg of chlorpyrifos.

Population density, coefficient of occurrence, and informative connection with six types of soil humidification are given for 53 bird species. The informative estimation of every humidification type is determined for every bird species. Thereby it is definitely a contribution of every gradation of edaphic factor to the structural genesis of dendrophilous bird communities. The strongest informative connection between humidity gradients and the avifauna structure of the wood stands is available in dry edaphotopes for margin representatives and fresh one for typical forest species. These two humidification types play a start function in the structural genesis of some blocks of dendrophilous bird communities per se. It is determined that change of bird species of forest-steppe faunogenetic complex by species from Nemoral complex undergoes in most cases {{on the border of}} the gradient between fresh and humid edaphotopes. For 53 species of birds from dendrophilous complex is was revealed that the importance of different levels of soil moisture has a different impact in shaping of the modern structure dendrophilous avifauna. Dry and especially drily edaphotopes determine the spatial structure of the species that are of forest-steppe origin and belong to the representatives of the optional component of dendrophilous bird communities. Wet edafotopes are involved {{in the formation of the}} spatial structure of species of predominantly immoral origin and relate to the obligate component of representatives of dendrophilous bitd comminities. Gradient wetting of edaphotopes on the verge of ‘linked’/’fresh’ is restructuring for the bird communities. It takes an optional replacement red communists feature to obligate. Stands rather dry and fresh items currently being the most active formation of the spatial structure of bird communities. In relation to the stands for dryish soil compaction observed populations of species that nest there. The fort stands on fresh soil tend to be the emergence of new species for nesting communities. Despite the small area and the uneven spatial arrangement of belts that are caused the effect of irrigation, there are some places of nesting of small belts for species that occur there only because of the increased level of humidity and the presence of open temporary ponds used by waterbirds. These belts have a ‘hunchback’ profile, caused by the constant flooding, and as a result - a tall and dense stands in the center adjustment of reserve stands caused by the age and condition of vegetation diversity management techniques, moreover the "island" effect becomes characteristic is fewer birds – like dendrophilous. Under present conditions, it does not describe the dendrophilous features for the bird communities in general. Only a few species possess the most biocenotical selectively retain the characteristics inherent to the "island”type populations. The biosphere reserve "Askania Nova" represents the diversity loam with varying degrees of moisture and salinity. The most common are dark <b>chestnut</b> <b>soils</b> in the north of the reserve bordering the southern black soils. Most belts representing tree plantation reserve, located in dark <b>chestnut</b> <b>soils</b> with low humus content in loess loam. Also, the composition of the physical and chemical properties of soil contributes to some zoogenic factors. In relation to the spatial distribution of birds in the reserve, one of the leading factors of the spectrum is the nature of hydration. Directly or through the woody vegetation it determines the nature of the spatial distribution of bird dendrophilous complexes. Relatively high diversity was registered due to the variety of types of moisturizing various irrigation methods for soils.
