2500|$|The Mount Keira Ring Track {{provides}} walkers with {{a moderate}} [...] (3–5-hour) round trip. The Ring Track encircles the mountain {{at an average}} height of 250 metres. The walk can be commenced {{from a number of}} locations, including Mount Keira summit, Byarong Park, the Scout Camp and Queen Elizabeth Drive. The Ring Track can also be joined from the Mount Pleasant Track, which starts from Parrish Avenue. From Byarong Park, a picnic area with parking and an information bay, access to the Ring Track is via a short link track that runs from the northern perimeter of the picnic area to the entrance of the Girl Guide Camp road. The link track crosses the Guide Camp road and then ascends a short distance through rainforest, before joining the Ring Track. From the junction, two branches of the Ring Track ascend the mountain. The left branch gently climbs the southern flank of Mount Keira, following Mitchells Road to a saddle located at the junction of Mount Keira Road and Queen Elizabeth Drive. The right branch traverses the mountain's eastern flank, before emerging at Geordies Flat on Mount Keira Road. From Geordies Flat, the northern branch of the Ring Track climbs steadily to the junction of Mount Keira Road and Queen Elizabeth Drive. At this point, walkers <b>can</b> <b>also</b> <b>join</b> <b>the</b> Robertsons Lookout track, a short [...] walk that terminates at a spectacular view that takes in the Scout Camp, Mount Keira and the Illawarra coast. At Geordies Flat, a vehicle width trail leads north to Parrish avenue. Walkers combine this trail with the Ring Track and the Mount Pleasant walking track to complete a loop walk.|$|E

40|$|The polynucleotide ligase {{isolated}} from T 4 -infected Escherichia coli was previously shown {{to bring about}} repair of breaks in the single strands of bihelical DNA. The present work shows that the enzyme <b>can</b> <b>also</b> catalyze <b>the</b> <b>joining</b> of DNA duplexes at their base-paired ends. This novel reaction occurs when the deoxynucleoside at a 5 ′-end carries a phosphate group and the complementary deoxynucleoside opposite to it carries a 3 ′-hydroxyl group. The consequence is the lengthening of the original duplex to form dimers or oligomers depending upon whether one or both ends are base-paired...|$|R

40|$|Abstract-Wireless {{mesh network}} is one the most {{potential}} application network for outdoor communication. In this presented work the security issues are investigated in WMN and {{a solution for}} security issue is designed more specifically for wormhole attack detection and prevention. The issues rise when the nodes are mobile and poor routing techniques allow a user to change or modify the information during data transmission because, during network communication the data is transmitted through the intermediate routers where any node can leave or <b>join</b> <b>the</b> network any time. Thus a malevolent node <b>also</b> <b>can</b> <b>join</b> <b>the</b> network and harm the privacy and security. This given scheme is desired {{to prepare for the}} secure communication route discovery which is able to provide the solution for defending routing based attacks in the network one of the attack is wormhole.
