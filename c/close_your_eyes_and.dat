Chad Hillard of Hillydilly wrote that [...] "the host of visuals—while definitely intriguing—prove {{to be quite}} ironic considering her claim that she's away from those drug things". Writing for Idolator, Bradley Stern described the clip as [...] "a strangely trippy, kaleidoscopic affair with lots of weird camera tricks" [...] and {{said that it was}} a [...] "simple, yet effective treatment". However, Mark Savage of Discopop gave the video a negative review, writing, [...] " [...] It's a crying shame that the video for [...] Not on Drugs, is so undercooked. The weird editing, the weirder haircuts, the cheap effects and cheaper locations are a woeful disservice to the song's gutsy declaration of love". He also called it a [...] "disappointment" [...] and stated that [...] "maybe just <b>close</b> <b>your</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>and</b> enjoy the song".

500|$|The {{opening track}} [...] "Playa Playa" [...] {{features}} basketball metaphors and gospel overtones, which accompany the track's slow funk and jazz vibe. On his bass {{playing in the}} song, Pino Palladino recalled [...] "I was thinking about Stevie Wonder in the choruses and P-Funk in the verses". Rob Evanoff of All About Jazz called the song [...] "an uplifting soul ride", and stated that it evokes an image of [...] "a musical train seen far off in the distance, slowly getting bigger as it gets closer". Evanoff also compared the track's style to the jam-sound of Pink Floyd, and wrote [...] "it surrounds you with a deep thick infectious groove that, at first, shadows and then envelopes your senses {{in such a way}} that is equal bits liberating, intoxicating and hypnotic…you <b>close</b> <b>your</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>and</b> are transported into another dimension". On the song's lyrics, one critic wrote that [...] "D'Angelo disses all neo-soul wannabes by calmly singing 'Bring the drama playa/Give me all U got'". [...] "Devil's Pie" [...] is a funk and hip hop diatribe with a lyrical theme concerning hip hop excess, and it is accompanied by P-Funk style harmonies and low-key singing by D'Angelo. It is a bass-driven track produced by DJ Premier, who contributes to its hip hop texture. The song's theme also incorporates religious imagery into its message of social strife. Questlove has stated that [...] "Devil's Pie" [...] was written to address the issues of [...] "the money hungry jiggafied state of the world we're in".|$|E

On the modernist side, Lovinescu also argued that Buruieni de dragoste was Crevedia's most accomplished work. [...] "Poorly structured" [...] and [...] "embarrassing for those familiar with literary life", it was nonetheless more analytical, and had [...] "a poetic note and vigorous expression".|$|E

Of course there will be many more CGI-based action epics, but never again one this bloated, excessive, incomprehensible, long (149 minutes) or expensive ($200 million)." [...] Ebert would continue to lambast the film (and, sometimes, the Transformers franchise in general) in other movie reviews and responses to letters and emails sent to him. Rolling Stone critic Peter Travers did not give the film any stars, considering that [...] "Revenge of the Fallen has a shot at the title 'Worst Movie of the Decade'."
