40|$|This paper {{introduces}} {{the method of}} the discretization of the <b>gear</b> <b>tooth</b> flank in involute segments for the determination of <b>conjugate</b> <b>gear</b> <b>tooth</b> profiles. Instead of following a point-to-point analytical approach {{to the problem of}} determining the path of contact and the geometry of the generating rack and the mating wheel, the actual tooth flank is considered to be composed of infinitesimal local involutes and therefore a closed solution can be achieved. Due to its simplicity, the method is faster than the standard theory of gearing and this is particularly useful in problems requiring iterative calculations of the tooth geometry such as gear optimization. The method is implemented on modified involute as well as loboid gears used in lobe pumps and it is verified against existing theories. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|A {{development}} {{platform for}} low-frequency magnetic testing techniques, which allows {{a reduction of}} development efforts and costs from prototyping to final solution, has been designed. The specification states the requirements for the development platform. To determine the application capability for flux leakage inspections, different sensors have been evaluated and GMR and Hall sensors have been selected as fundamental magnetic flux sensors. The principle differences between magnetic particle testing and sensor-based flux leakage technique have been identified and a comparison between the different techniques, including their limitations has been provided. When conventional magnetic particle methods are applied, a complete, 100 % coverage of the test area can often not be achieved, for example <b>gear</b> <b>tooth</b> <b>systems.</b> Magnetic particle inspection of <b>gear</b> <b>tooth</b> <b>systems</b> is generally possible but in certain cases leads to the accumulation of the test fluids (wet bath) in {{the root of the}} <b>gear</b> <b>tooth</b> {{in such a way that}} it masks potential flaw (crack) indications. Under these circumstances, automated magnetic particle inspection systems and conventional manual magnetic particle inspection personal are often overburdened, due to the poor visibility (contrast) of the flaw indication. This thesis has demonstrated that the sensor-based magnetic flux leakage technique is applicable for the detection of heat-treatment cracking in <b>gear</b> <b>tooth</b> <b>system</b> parts and components. The sensitivity of the sensor-based magnetic flux leakage technique has been determined experimentally, applying the development platform, as well as numerically. A mathematical interrelation for the computation of detection limits for crack indications relative to crack depth and sensor lift-off was established. To satisfy increasing inspection speeds, required by manufacturing, different scanning techniques have been developed and were implemented into practical applications. Different nondestructive inspection systems have been designed by implementing this development platform. These practical examples have demonstrated that the application potential of the development platform ranges from the inspection for micro-cracking of small surface areas of only a few square millimeters to rather large areas, such as several hundred square meters of prestressed concrete sections for the detection of tension wire cracking...|$|R

40|$|Presented is Tredgold’s Approximation {{for using}} an {{equivalent}} cylindrical <b>gear</b> with spur <b>teeth</b> to “approximate” a bevel <b>gear</b> with straight <b>teeth.</b> This relation is extended to spiral bevel and hypoid gears by utilizing pitch surface curvature {{in the direction}} perpendicular to the <b>gear</b> <b>tooth</b> spiral to establish an equivalent gear. Subsequently, the envelope of a planar <b>gear</b> <b>tooth</b> profile in this perpendicular direction is presented. The envelope of the <b>gear</b> <b>tooth</b> profile is used to determine fully <b>conjugate</b> <b>gear</b> <b>teeth</b> profiles for spatial gear elements. This procedure is valid for any tooth profile along with circular and non-circular gears. To validate the methodology, a virtual model of a bevel gear pair (“presented model”) is created and an unloaded tooth contact analysis is performed. The procedure used to perform the unloaded tooth contact analysis and determine the corresponding unloaded transmission error {{is based on the}} concept of ease-off topography.

This paper provides a summary of these cooperative tests, which were jointly funded by Boeing and DARPA.

The split torque tests were run using 200 N-m (1767 in-lbs) torque input to {{each side of the}} transmission. During tests, two input pinions were slow rolled while in mesh with the two face gears. Two idler gears were also used in the configuration to recombine torque near the output.
