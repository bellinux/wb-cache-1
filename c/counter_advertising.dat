Cunningham {{launched}} an aggressive sales plan that made claims that his tubes were licensed under the Fleming or DeForest patents. His competitors {{on the west coast}} put out <b>counter</b> <b>advertising</b> that his tubes were not licensed. His competitors were legally right, Cunningham's Audio Tron was never a licensed product (that is, it was a bootleg). Later in 1919, the Radio Corporation of America (RCA) took legal action against Cunningham for the violation of the Flemming and DeForest patents. The decision made by the US District Court for Northern California proved quite favorable to Cunningham. The court decision summary was as follows: ...|$|E

40|$|Whereas much {{previous}} {{research focuses on}} the ways consumers strive to gain social approval, consumption that may result in social disapproval must be considered. In order to do so, {{the purpose of this}} paper is to explore consumers' self-concepts within a risky consumption context, namely smoking. Self-concept discrepancies and the resulting emotions and coping strategies are identified. A qualitative methodology based on 30 focus groups conducted across ten European countries is employed. Findings demonstrate self-concept discrepancies between both the actual self and ought/ideal guiding end states, as well as between the 'I' and social selves. Such discrepancies generate negative emotions and result in emotion-focused coping strategies. In addition, the accuracy of smokers' social self-concepts with reference to the actual perceptions of non-smokers is discussed. Important implications for the design of effective anti-smoking advertising are discussed, based on the findings. It is suggested that <b>counter</b> <b>advertising</b> should encourage dialogue between smokers and non-smokers and that message themes should centre on building the self-efficacy of smokers. The reason why the social context should be an integral part of consumer self-concept research is highlighted. Moreover, the importance of moving beyond merely understanding the existence of self-discrepancies, to focus on the emotions that are generated by these discrepancies and the consequent coping strategies employed to resolve them is identified. As such, the potential contributions that may arise by recognising the intersection between two bodies of literature that are often treated separately, namely, consumer coping and the self-concept, are highlighted...|$|E

50|$|The {{foundation}} {{notes that}} {{concern over the}} flow of information goes beyond the desire to protect democratic transparency, freedom of speech or the public's access to the airwaves. Although it supports these causes, the foundation instead situates the battle of the mind at the center of its political agenda. Fighting to <b>counter</b> pro-consumerist <b>advertising</b> is done not as a means to an end, but as the end in itself. This shift in emphasis is a crucial element of mental environmentalism.|$|R
25|$|Anti-smoking groups, {{particularly}} cancer charities, {{along with}} many government health departments have attempted to <b>counter</b> the <b>advertising</b> of tobacco by creating their own advertisements to highlight {{the negative effects of}} smoking. The earliest commercials mainly focused on aiding smoking cessation, the increased risk of lung cancer and the problems associated with passive smoking. However, they have become increasingly hard-hitting over the years, with some campaigns now centered around decreased physical attractiveness and the risk of erectile dysfunction. These are more targeted towards younger smokers than previous campaigns. The British government spent £31 million in 2003 as part of their anti-smoking campaign.|$|R
40|$|In US v. Philip Morris USA Inc. (2006), {{six major}} tobacco {{companies}} {{were ordered to}} provide funding for an extremely large corrective advertising and marketing campaign. The Court ruled that consumers may have been misled and deceived about the (1) health effects of smoking, (2) addictiveness of smoking, (3) lack of health benefit from low tar/light cigarettes, (4) companies’ manipulation of nicotine delivery and cigarette design, and (5) health effects of secondhand smoke. Using print advertising copy test procedures, this research focused on the potential effectiveness of test ads submitted to the Court in impacting these target beliefs. In an initial pilot study, reliable multi-item measures {{for each of these}} belief themes were developed and assessed. These multi-item belief measures were then employed in the subsequent main study, in which the effects of two versions of a print advertisement (submitted to the Court in this litigation) were tested using a mixed experimental design. As hypothesized, results show that corrective ads can {{have a positive effect on}} the belief themes (compared to a control group not exposed to such ads), but there is an interaction demonstrating that some belief themes are more strongly affected by the test ads than are others. Results suggested that the beliefs about light/low tar cigarettes may be substantially affected by such a campaign. The addition to the ad copy of graphic visuals, such as those currently used on cigarette packages in Canada and Australia, had mixed results overall. Contributions of the research include the development of reliable multi-item measures for critical smoking-related beliefs, as well as implications of the copy test findings for this specific case and corrective advertising, tobacco <b>counter</b> <b>advertising,</b> and public policy, in general...|$|E
40|$|Public health {{agencies}} face considerable challenges {{trying to prevent}} overweight and obesity in society, primarily because a person 2 ̆ 7 s own behavior is often {{the root cause of}} the disease. Individuals make personal choices about their diet, exercise, and lifestyle, so disease is often thought of as a matter of personal, not governmental, responsibility. This Commentary shows how law {{can be used as a}} tool to prevent overweight and obesity (see Table). The tools discussed in this article include: - Disclosure - e. g., labels and consumer information - Tort liability - e. g., inadequate disclosure of risks, misleading advertisements, and targeting children - Surveillance - e. g., reporting of glycosylated hemoglobin for diabetes management - Targeting children and adolescents - e. g., restricting food advertising during children 2 ̆ 7 s programs; <b>counter</b> <b>advertising</b> to promote good nutrition and physical activity; limiting the use of cartoon characters; and restricting web-based games and promotions - Taxation of unhealthy food - e. g., 2 ̆ 2 junk food, 2 ̆ 2 2 ̆ 2 snack, 2 ̆ 2 or 2 ̆ 2 Twinkie 2 ̆ 2 tax provides disincentive for purchasing calorie-dense, nutrient-poor foods; tax revenue could also be used to promote healthy nutrition - School policies - e. g., require schools to adhere to dietary guidelines and portion size; increase opportunities for nutrition education and physical activities - Built Environment - e. g., limit fast food restaurants, build recreational parks and bike paths, expand mass transportation, and provide lighting and playgrounds in housing developments - Food Prohibitions - e. g., ban trans fat from restaurants Despite the undoubted political risks, should public {{health agencies}} push for strong measures to control obesity, perhaps even banning hazardous foods? The justification lies with the epidemic rates of overweight and obesity, the preventable morbidity and mortality, and the stark health disparities based on race and socioeconomic status. Although the public dislikes paternalism, it is at least worth considering whether such an approach is ever justified to regulate harms that are apparently self-imposed, but which are deeply socially embedded and pervasively harmful to the public...|$|E
50|$|Together, {{they were}} the first to apply the power of modern {{advertising}} and promotion to fighting cancer. They joined the American Society for the Control of Cancer which at the time was sleepy and ineffectual and transformed it into the American Cancer Society. The Laskers ousted the board of directors. Afterwards, they raised then record amounts of money and directed much of it to research. The American Cancer Society also fought lung cancer through prevention via anti-smoking campaigns. Using TV equal-time provisions, they were able to <b>counter</b> cigarette <b>advertising</b> with their own message. The messages were effective enough that the tobacco companies voluntarily stopped advertising on TV to prevent their broadcast.|$|R

40|$|Advertising {{plays an}} {{enormously}} {{important role in}} our economy and culture, {{and it is important}} to recognize this. However, the extent and nature of advertising is changing dramatically and as asociety, rather than just a market, we need to understand the consequences of the changing nature of advertising and make decisions about what, if anything should be done to <b>counter</b> it. <b>Advertising</b> is the most visible, important and controversial element of promotion placed under the broad category of marketing. It deals not only with goods commodity promotion but also ideas and services that may or may not be of commercial nature. Although most of the advertising is of commercial nature but there exists an impressive role of advertising in promoting message of social relevance.

The incident may have ended up helping Bush by creating doubts about the legitimacy of his detractors.|$|R
40|$|How do {{competitors}} {{react to}} each other's price-promotion and advertising attacks? What {{are the reasons}} for the observed reaction behavior? We answer these questions by performing a large-scale empirical study on the short-run and long-run reactions to promotion and advertising shocks in over 400 consumer product categories over a four-year time span. Our results clearly show that the most predominant form of competitive response is passive in nature. When a reaction does occur, it is usually retaliatory in the same instrument, i. e., promotion attacks are countered with promotions, and <b>advertising</b> attacks are <b>countered</b> with <b>advertising.</b> There are very few long-run consequences of any type of reaction behavior. By linking reaction behavior to both cross- and own-effectiveness, we further demonstrate that passive behavior is often a sound strategy, while firms that do opt to retaliate often use ineffective instruments, resulting in “spoiled arms. ” Accommodating behavior is observed in only a minority of cases, and often results in a missed sales opportunity when promotional support is reduced. The ultimate impact of most promotion and advertising campaigns depends primarily on the nature of consumer response, not the vigilance of competitors. empirical generalizations, advertising and price-promotion effects, competitive strategy, time-series analysis...|$|R
40|$|IntroductionRecent reports show a sharp {{increase}} in smoking rates among girls. We describe prevalence of cigarette smoking and susceptibility to cigarette smoking among female students aged 13 to 15 years in Vietnam and examine the associated factors. MethodsWe used data from female secondary school students aged 13 to 15 years (grades 8 - 10) from the 2007 Global Youth Tobacco Survey that was conducted in 9 provinces in Vietnam. We used multivariate logistic regression analysis to determine associations between independent variables with smoking status and susceptibility to smoking. ResultsPrevalence of cigarette smoking among girls was 1. 2 % (95 % confidence interval [CI], 0. 9 - 1. 5), and 1. 5 % (95 % CI, 1. 2 - 1. 9) of girls were susceptible to smoking. Having friends who smoke was the strongest predictor of both smoking status and susceptibility to smoking. Attendance at school classes that described the harmful effects of smoking had significant effects in reducing cigarette smoking. Girls who were exposed to billboard cigarette advertising {{were more likely to be}} susceptible to smoking than were those who had not seen advertisements. ConclusionOur findings highlight the need for pursuing school-based intervention programs in Vietnam and for <b>countering</b> tobacco <b>advertising</b> and marketing practices that target young women...|$|R
40|$|BackgroundTobacco {{industry}} cigarette {{advertising is}} associated with increased adolescent smoking, while <b>counter</b> tobacco <b>advertising</b> {{is associated with}} reduced smoking. As these campaigns compete for influence, {{there is a need}} to understand their inter-relationship on youth smoking. MethodsThis study reports data from a national population of families (n= 1036) with an oldest child aged 10 – 13 years, identified by random digit dialling. Parent and child dyads completed baseline questionnaires in 2003. Adolescents were resurveyed in 2007 – 2008 (response rate 74 %). Adjusted logistic regression explores associations between receptivity to cigarette and tobacco control advertising and adolescent smoking initiation. ResultsIn 2007 – 2008, 57. 9 % of adolescents reported a favourite tobacco control advertisement and 43. 3 % reported being receptive to cigarette advertisements. Thirty per cent reported receptivity to cigarette and tobacco control advertisements. Among those receptive to cigarette advertising, having a favourite anti-smoking advertisement had a borderline significant association with a 30 % lower smoking rate. Anti-industry tobacco control messages were three times more likely to be favourites of those who were receptive to cigarette advertising than other tobacco control advertising. ConclusionsReceptivity to tobacco control advertising appeared to ameliorate the promotion of initiation from cigarette advertising. Anti-industry advertising appears to be the most effective counter for tobacco control and should be considered for wider use. A larger longitudinal study is needed to confirm these findings...|$|R
40|$|Society places great {{emphasis}} {{on the presence of}} hair. Some degree of hair loss is accepted as a normal part of the aging process, in line with the observation that more than 50 % of men will develop androgenetic alopecia by the age of 50 years. However, it is possible to understand the psychosocial isolation and distress felt by men with a strong familial predisposition to androgenetic alopecia, who tend to display hair loss in their late teens or twenties. There are currently two drugs which have been licensed for the treatment of male androgenetic alopecia: oral finasteride and topical minoxidil solution which are effective to some extent. Furthermore, upon discontinuing treatment, any gain that has been achieved is quickly lost. Added to which there is an entire market of unproven over the <b>counter</b> products: <b>advertised</b> in the electronic media, local hair salons, and various departmental stores. In this review, we highlight the important advances in the management of male androgenetic alopecia with {{emphasis on}} approaches that can lead to more successful and long-term hair restoration for young adults. In particular, we discuss the evidence supporting the use of the follicular unit grafting technique in conjunction with medical treatment before and after the procedure. Moreover, some other alterations of this most popular state of the art hair restoration technique have been mentioned briefly. As a result, patients and physicians seem equally satisfied from this procedure for its naturally looking results which are cosmetically more acceptable and esthetically pleasing for longer period of time...|$|R
60|$|Indeed, it was {{no secret}} that my Aunt Caroline had been a Miss Flaven, of Philadelphia, though {{she would have had}} the fashion of our {{province}} to believe that she belonged to the Governor's set there; and she spoke in terms of easy familiarity of the first families of her native city, deceiving no one save herself, poor lady. How fondly do we believe, with the ostrich, that our body is hidden when our head is tucked under our wing! Not a visitor in Philadelphia but knew Terence Flaven, Mrs. Grafton Carvel's father, who not many years since sold tea and spices and soap and glazed teapots over his own <b>counter,</b> and still <b>advertised</b> his cargoes in the public prints. He was a broad and charitable-minded man enough, and unassuming, but gave way at last to the pressure brought upon him by his wife and daughter, and bought a mansion in Front Street. Terence Flaven never could be got to stay there save to sleep, and preferred to spend his time in his shop, which was grown greatly, chatting with his customers, and bowing the ladies to their chariots. I need hardly say that this worthy man was on far better terms than his family with those personages whose society they strove so hard to attain.|$|R
