40|$|We {{performed}} a seasonal {{study of the}} importance of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) as limitation to the productivity of <b>Caulerpa</b> <b>taxifolia</b> (Vahl) C.

The study presented here indicates that <b>Caulerpa</b> <b>taxifolia</b> did not respond to nutrient enrichment, except for plants collected in April and September 1993, where productivity and alkaline phosphatase activity (APA) of enriched plants varied 0. 5 - to 3 -fold relative to those of control plants. Rates of APA ranged from 9 to 52 mu M PO 4 odw h(- 1), close to those characteristic of P-sufficient macroalgae. Tissue nutrient concentrations were frequently above typical critical levels for species of macroalgae ranging from 1. 36 to 3. 13 % dw, and 0. 16 to 0. 21 % dw, for N and P, respectively.

50|$|It {{has been}} {{proposed}} that Elysia subornata {{could be used as}} a biological control agent against an invasive strain of the alga <b>Caulerpa</b> <b>taxifolia</b> in the northwestern Mediterranean Sea. The high toxicity levels of that alga discourage most of the native herbivorous fauna from consuming it. Elysia subornata, however, preferentially feeds on <b>Caulerpa</b> <b>taxifolia,</b> using the secondary metabolite, Caulerpenyne, for its own defence. It doesn't survive the cool temperature of winter Mediterranean waters, and would therefore need to be raised on a largescale to have any significant effect. Either that; or a hybrid would have to be genetically engineered using DNA from E. timida and/or E. viridis.|$|R
40|$|<b>Caulerpa</b> <b>taxifolia</b> (Vahl) C.

2500|$|Unlike most {{aquarium}} macro algae, C. taxifolia has {{the appearance}} of a vascular plant with [...] "leaves" [...] arranged neatly up stalks, like a fern.

40|$|A {{decrease}} in seagrass cover and a commensurate increase in <b>Caulerpa</b> <b>taxifolia</b> distribution in Moreton Bay have prompted {{concern for the}} impact that habitat change may have on faunal communities. Therefore, {{it is important to}} understand the patterns of habitat use. We examined habitat selection of three common seagrass species: double-ended pipefish (Syngnathoides biaculeatus), eastern trumpeter (Pelates quadrilineatus), and fan-bellied leatherjacket (Monacanthus chinensis) using a mesocosm experiment. Fish were given three possible habitat pairings (1) seagrass and C. taxifolia, (2) seagrass and unvegetated, and (3) C. taxifolia and unvegetated. Observation trials were conducted during the day and night over two days. In all trials, fish preferred vegetated habitat (seagrass or C. taxifolia) over unvegetated habitat (sand). In seagrass and C. taxifolia trials, all species preferred seagrass significantly over C. taxifolia. Habitat use patterns did not differ between day and night trials. <b>Caulerpa</b> <b>taxifolia</b> provides a valuable structured habitat in the absence of seagrass; however, it is unclear if C. taxifolia meadows provide other resource benefits to fishes beyond that of shelter.

25|$|The {{appearance}} off the California coast {{was most}} probably {{caused by an}} aquarium owner improperly dumping the contents, allowing C. taxifolia to flow through a storm sewer into the lagoon where the invasion was discovered.

25|$|<b>Caulerpa</b> <b>taxifolia</b> is {{a species}} of seaweed, an alga of the genus Caulerpa.

The alga has a stem (rhizome) which spreads horizontally just above the seafloor. From this stem grow vertical fern-like pinnae, whose blades are flat {{like those of the}} yew (Taxus), hence the species name taxifolia.|$|R

40|$|The {{intrinsic}} and extrinsic {{toxicity of}} SiO 2 nanoparticles (Aerosil OX 50, ϕ ~ 40 nm) are investigated with a {{comparison to the}} particles in micron size (SiO 2 gel, ϕ ~ 1. 5 μ m).

These nanoparticles can further travel onto the surface and into the bulk of the algae (<b>Caulerpa</b> <b>taxifolia)</b> with a depth of ~ 1 μm while carrying toxic γ-picoline. The integrated intrinsic and extrinsic toxicity of SiO 2 nanoparticles has a significant effect on the growth of the algae.

40|$|We {{discuss the}} use of {{supervised}} neural networks as a metamodelling technique for discrete event stochastic simulation {{in order to reduce}} significantly the computational burden involved by discrete simulations. A sophisticated computer model, coupling a Geographical Information System with a stochastic discrete event simulator, has been developed to anticipate the propagation of the green alga <b>Caulerpa</b> <b>taxifolia</b> in the North-Western Mediterranean sea. The simulation model provides reliable predictions, a couple of years in advance, of: i) the local expansion patterns of the alga, ii) the increase of C. taxifolia biomass and iii), the covered surfaces. However because the algorithmic model accounts for spatial interactions and anthropic dispersion/activities such as eradication, introduction of specific predators etc., simulations are extremely time and memory consuming. Therefore, to reduce the computational burden, a neural network was successfully trained on artificially generated data provided by the simulation runs to provide accurate forecasts 12 years in advance along with associated confidence intervals. The ability of the neural networks to capture the underlying physics of the phenomena is clearly illustrated by several preliminary experiments on a large coastal area. The neural network is able to construct, on this site, estimates of the <b>Caulerpa</b> <b>taxifolia</b> expansion 12 years in advance in good agreement with the simulation trajectories...|$|R
