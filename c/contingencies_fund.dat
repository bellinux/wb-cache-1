50|$|The Constitution of India {{authorized}} the parliament {{to establish a}} <b>contingency</b> <b>fund</b> of India. The <b>Contingency</b> <b>Fund</b> of India is established under Article 267(1)of the Indian Constitution. It is {{in the nature of}} an imprest (money maintained for a specific purpose). Accordingly, Parliament enacted the <b>contingency</b> <b>fund</b> of India Act 1950. The fund is held by the Finance Secretary (Department of Economic Affairs) on behalf of the President of India and it can be operated by executive action.The <b>Contingency</b> <b>Fund</b> of India exists for disasters and related unforeseen expenditures. In 2005, it was raised from 50 to Rs 500 crore. Approval of the Parliament of India for such expenditure and for withdrawal of an equivalent amount from the Consolidated Fund is subsequently obtained to ensure that the corpus of the <b>Contingency</b> <b>Fund</b> remains intact. Similarly, <b>Contingency</b> <b>Fund</b> of each State Government is established under Article 267(2) of the Constitution - this is in the nature of an imprest placed at the disposal of the Governor to enable him/her to make advances to meet urgent unforeseen expenditure, pending authorization by the State Legislature. Approval of the Legislature for such expenditure and for withdrawal of an equivalent amount from the Consolidated Fund is subsequently obtained, whereupon the advances from the <b>Contingency</b> <b>Fund</b> are recouped to the Fund. The corpus varies across states and the quantum is decided by the State legislatures.|$|R

40|$|In 2015, Open Road Alliance {{conducted}} a 400 -respondent survey {{designed to look}} at the frequency of need for <b>contingency</b> <b>funding</b> as reported by Funders and Grantees. The survey was designed to explore the following questions about risk and contingency funding: Frequency: How often do projects need <b>contingency</b> <b>funding?</b> Donor Response: How often are projects granted additional <b>contingency</b> <b>funds?</b> Capacity: What policies and procedures are in place to deal with contingencies? Consequences: What are the consequences of unfunded requests for the project and for the Funder-Grantee relationship? The survey data lead to five key findings: Disruptions requiring additional <b>funds</b> (i. e., <b>contingency</b> <b>funds)</b> are common and expected. Both Grantees and Funders report that about 1 in 5 projects require <b>contingency</b> <b>funding</b> to bring projects in on time and with full impact. It is not a common practice for Funders or Grantees to address these risks before they happen. When <b>contingency</b> <b>funds</b> are needed, most Funders do have the operational and financial capacity to respond. When asked, the majority of Funders do approve additional requests. Grantees are hesitant to communicate with Funders about potential obstacles. Funders' and Grantees' perceptions regarding the effects of their actions on each other are often misaligned. Specifically, grantees believe that asking for additional funds negatively affects the likelihood of being awarded future grants, while the vast majority of Funders claim such requests have no effect on future decision-making...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} impact of aid {{volatility}} in a two-period model where production may occur with either a traditional or a modern technology. Public spending is productive and "time to build" requires expenditure in both periods for the modern technology to be used. The possibility of a poverty trap induced by high aid volatility is first examined in a benchmark case where taxation is absent. The analysis is then extended to account for self insurance (taking {{the form of a}} first-period <b>contingency</b> <b>fund)</b> financed through taxation. An increase in aid volatility is shown to raise the optimal <b>contingency</b> <b>fund.</b> But if future aid also depends {{on the size of the}} <b>contingency</b> <b>fund</b> (as a result of a moral hazard effect on donors' behavior), the optimal policy may entail no self insurance. ...|$|R

50|$|As far as CRF is concerned, {{there are}} no {{unlimited}} funds available with it. In {{the past five years}} Bihar has received only Rs.123.66 Crores in 2000-01, Rs. 129.84 in 2001-02, Rs. 136.33 Crores in 2002-03, Rs. 143.15 Crores in 2003-04 and Rs. 150.30 Crores in 2004-05. GoB is supposed to add 25 per cent more to this sum to claim the Central assistance. One can well imagine the gap that exists between the available small funds to the tune of Rs. 150 Crores against a demand of Rs. 8,000 Crores. Some money may be available through the channels of National Calamity <b>Contingencies</b> <b>Fund</b> (NCCF) but that too is drop in the ocean. The rest will have to be borne by the state Government or by the affected family itself. GoB asserts that it has spent all the money that it had with it (Rs. 850 Crores) to meet the flood disaster this year and it has further spent a sum of Rs. 250 Crores from other sources and has no money left to do any relief any more unless some help pours in from outside. The Chief Minister has requested the Center to allocate funds for that but such requests have a history of getting ignored.|$|E
40|$|Natural {{and human}} induced {{disasters}} {{are a threat}} to food security, economic progress and livelihoods in Uganda. However, we have limited knowledge regarding the putative role {{of the human rights}} dimension to the impact and management of such tragedies. In this article we assessed the present policies, legislation and institutional capabilities to ascertain whether they could assure the right to adequate food during disaster situations in Uganda. Using purposive sampling, 52 duty bearers working in institutions deemed relevant to food security, nutrition and disaster management were interviewed using a semi-structured guide. Relevant provisions from policy, legislation, institutional budgets and records of Parliament provided the context for analysis. The most important concern coming from the analyses of the information retrieved were inadequate preparedness mechanisms and capabilities. Whereas Uganda’s Constitution proclaims the right to adequate food, and the need to establish a <b>contingencies</b> <b>fund</b> and commission responsible for disaster preparedness and management, they had not been instituted. Implementation of relevant policies appeared slow, especially with regard to assuring adequate relief food as a State obligation. Legislation to guarantee funding and institutionalisation of necessary disaster preparedness and management capabilities was not in place. An ambitious 5 -year Uganda Nutrition Action Plan adopted in 2011 had not yet been funded by mid- 2013, implying a reality gap in nutrition programming. Budget architecture and financing to disaster management have in effect fallen short of assuring adequate relief food as a human right. Due to capacity constraints, an approach of humanitarian relief may be entrenched in contradiction of State obligations to respect, protect and fulfil human rights. To stay ahead of the potential threats, the Government with support of the Parliament and relevant partners need to enact legislation to appropriate budget resources needed to institute a mechanism of capabilities to implement the constitutional and policy provisions on the right to adequate food and disaster management...|$|E
