40|$|Our {{research}} group has obtained transgenic strawberry plants expressing antisense sequences of either a pectate lyase (APEL lines) [1] or a polygalacturonase gene (APG lines) [2]. Both genes encode ripening-specific endo-pectinases {{with a common}} target, deesterified homogalacturonans, but each enzyme act by a different mechanism and pH range. Ripe fruits from both transgenic genotypes were significantly firmer than control, being APG fruits on average 25 % firmer than APEL fruits. Cell wall analysis of both transgenic genotypes indicated that pectin fractions extracted with CDTA and sodium carbonate were significantly modified in transgenic fruits [2, 3]. To gain insight {{in the role of}} these pectinases in pectin disassembly during ripening, CDTA and Na 2 CO 3 pectins have been analyzed by atomic force microscopy (AFM). APEL and APG CDTA pectins had similar contour lengths but both were significantly longer than control. Similarly, APG <b>carbonate</b> <b>chains</b> were longer than control, showing APEL <b>carbonate</b> <b>chains</b> an intermediate length. Furthermore, transgenic pectins displayed a more complex branching pattern and a higher number of micellar aggregates, especially in the sodium carbonate fractions of APG samples. Acid hydrolysis of carbonate pectins reduced the number of micellar aggregates. AFM analyses confirm that the inhibition of both pectinases reduces pectin disassembly, and also suggest that each pectinase acts on specific pectin domains. Particularly, polygalacturonase silencing induces more significant pectin modifications, nicely correlated with the firmer phenotype of APG fruits, than the down-regulation of pectate lyase...|$|R

40|$|The {{adsorption}} of CO 2 on CaO(001) is {{investigated by}} density functional theory and infrared reflection absorption spectroscopy (IRAS). The calculations show that isolated CO 2 adsorbates on terraces as monodentate carbonates can freely rotate at room temperature, while rotation within carbonate aggregates has some hindrance. Rotation and other motions {{are important to}} facilitate oxygen atom exchange between the CO 2 adsorbate and CaO lattice. The calculated intrinsic barrier to oxygen scrambling is 114 kJ/mol for an isolated carbonate species and 148 kJ/mol within a long <b>carbonate</b> <b>chain.</b> However, due to the large adsorption energy for CO 2 on a defect-free CaO terrace site, the apparent barrier becomes − 39 kJ/mol for an isolated carbonate. At lower coordinated sites with higher degrees of freedom, the calculated intrinsic barrier to oxygen atom exchange is 80 kJ/mol at filled monatomic step sites and 26. 9 kJ/mol at corner sites. IRAS studies are performed by adsorbing C 18 O 2 on well-ordered Ca 16 O films grown on Mo and Ru substrates. The magnitude and splitting of the red shifts due to isotopic labeling are rationalized when considering oxygen scrambling, such that observed normal modes of surface carbonates involve both 16 O–C and 18 O–C vibrations.

In those structures eptahedra of calcium cations, characterized by ‘a pyramidal part {{on one side and}} a dome part on the other side joining the equatorial oxygen atoms’, form columns through edge sharing; the columns are connected each other, once again through edge sharing, and adjacent columns present the pyramidal apical ligands on opposite sides of the resulting infinite layers. These layers, decorated with wollastonite chains on both sides, build up the ‘complex layers’ which are the basic structural module in all the phases of the tobermorite group (Fig. 1). TLL is a recurrent feature in several natural phases belonging to distinct mineral groups. In the structures of the compounds of the rinkite group the TLL is decorated on both sides by disilicate groups and is accompanied by an infinite ‘octahedral’ layer in building up the structural arrangement. Dovyrenite / 2 / and roumaite / 3 / are closely related to the minerals of the rinkite group and differ only in the way of decoration of the TLL by the disilicate groups. Fukalite / 4 / too presents the TLL, decorated on both sides by four-repeat silicate <b>chains</b> and <b>carbonate</b> groups; tilleyite-type polyhedral layers are also present as distinct modules in building up the structural arrangement. The ubiquitous occurrence of TLL is related to its chemical and structural flexibility: the chemical and geometrical variations of the TLL in the different structures are described and discussed.

40|$|The Bahama Archipelago {{consists}} of an arcuate <b>chain</b> of <b>carbonate</b> platforms. Average water depths on the platform-tops, such as the Great Bahama Bank (GBB), are typically 10 m or less, with coral reef-rimmed margins, thick sediment accumulations, and the frequent occurrence of islands. There are, however, exceptions. For example, Cay Sal Bank (CSB), a little studied detached Bahamian carbonate platform with depths ranging from 30 to 7 m, is only slightly deeper than the GBB, but devoid of islands, lacks platform-margin coral reefs and holds little sediment on the platform-top; the platform is incipiently drowned. CSB is interesting as it is conspicuously larger (6000 sq. km) than other incipiently drowned platforms in the region, such as Serranilla Bank (1100 sq. km) and the Cat Island platform (1500 sq. km). Field and remote sensing data are assembled to {{provide insight into the}} sedimentology and geomorphology of the CSB. The influence of ocean climate, regional hydrodynamics, and Holocene flooding history are investigated to understand why platform-margin coral reef growth on CSB has been unable to keep pace with Holocene sea-level rise. A decade of regional sea-surface temperature data for the Bahamas report CSB to be situated in the same ocean climate regime as GBB. Temperature cannot explain the platform 2 ̆ 7 s different morphologies. The Florida Current has been evoked as a possible reason for the immature development of platform-top processes on the CSB, but numeric modeling suggests its influence to be restricted to the deep flanks of the bank. Further, sediment distribution on CSB, including infill patterns of karst depressions, suggest trade winds (easterlies) to drive platform-top hydrodynamics. By assembling a satellite-derived bathymetry map, it can be shown that CSB flooded earlier and at relatively higher rates of Holocene sea-level rise than its neighboring platforms. Flooding history is identified as the most feasible explanation for the atypical morphology of the CSB. By contrasting the present-day morphology of the CSB and the GBB, the work emphasizes how subtle differences in relative sea-level history can influence the growth of platform-margin coral reefs, features that in turn can conspire to set even closely neighboring carbonate platforms on divergent paths with regard to the development of marine landforms. This insight is relevant to interpreting the morphological diversity of carbonate platforms in the modern ocean and in the rock record...|$|R
40|$|Room {{temperature}} adsorption {{of carbon}} dioxide (CO 2) on monocrystalline CaO(001) thin films grown on a Mo(001) substrate was studied by infrared reflection–absorption spectroscopy (IRAS) and quantum chemical calculations. For comparison, CO 2 adsorption was examined on poorly ordered, nanoparticulate CaO films prepared on Ru(0001). For both systems, CO 2 readily adsorbs on the clean CaO surface. However, additional bands were observable on the CaO/Ru(0001) films compared with CaO/Mo(001), because the stricter IRAS surface selection rules {{do not apply to}} adsorption on the disordered thin films grown on Ru(0001). Spectral evolution with increasing exposure of the IRA bands suggested the presence of several adsorption sites which are consecutively populated by CO 2. Density functional calculations showed that CO 2 adsorption occurs as monodentate surface carbonate (CO 3 2 -) species at monatomic step sites and other low-coordinated sites, followed by formation of carbonates on terraces, which dominate at increasing CO 2 exposure. To explain the coverage-dependent IRAS results, we propose CO 2 surface islanding from the onset, most likely in the form of pairs and other chain-like species, which were calculated as thermodynamically favorable. The calculated adsorption energy for isolated CO 2 on the terrace sites (184 ± 10 kJ mol - 1) is larger than the adsorption energy obtained by temperature programmed desorption (∼ 120 – 140 kJ mol - 1) and heat of adsorption taken from microcalorimetry measurements at low coverage (∼ 125 kJ mol - 1). However, the calculated adsorption energies become less favorable when <b>carbonate</b> <b>chains</b> intersect on CaO terraces, forming kinks. Furthermore, our assignments of the initial stages of CO 2 adsorption are consistent with the observed coverage effect on the CO 2 adsorption energy measured by microcalorimetry and the IRAS results...|$|R
40|$|The Burano Evaporite Formation {{from the}} Secchia River Valley is an up to 2200 m-thick {{sequence}} composed of meter-to decameter-scale interbeds of gypsum-anhydrite and dolostones with minor halite. The deposit has {{been affected by}} a complex array of post-depositional modifications, thermal events and large-scale evaporite dissolution, preventing a satisfactory reconstruction of the environment of deposition. The modifications are intense because these rocks were the main decollement horizon during {{the formation of the}} Northern Apennines <b>chain.</b> The <b>carbonate</b> rocks are massive and-or laminated dolomitic mudstone, wackestone, oolitic packstones and oolitic, peloidal, bioclastic grainstones, which commonly appear as mega-boudins within a sulfate groundmass. The dolostones (delta O- 18 = - 5. 7 to - 3. 7 parts per thousand; delta C- 13 = + 1. 3 to + 3. 0 parts per thousand; PDB) have been affected by Mg-metasomatic replacement by magnesite (delta O- 18 = - 14. 0 to - 2. 6 parts per thousand; delta C- 13 = - 2. 6 to + 1. 4 parts per thousand; PDB) induced by hydrothermal circulation. Total homogenization temperatures of fluid inclusions in hydrothermal magnesite range from 275 to 310 degreesC. The anhydrite rocks are characterized by flow structures such as centimeter-scale pseudo-lamination composed of aligned prismatic crystals with transposed isoclinal folds outlined by dolostones fragments. Homogenization temperatures of fluid inclusions in authigenic quartz incorporated into sulfate rocks range from 260 to 305 degreesC (Emilia) and from 230 to 315 degreesC (Tuscany). The gypsum rocks are composed of xenotopic irregular cloudy crystals and, more rarely, by centimeter-scale idiotopic crystals showing the same structures as the anhydrite rocks. The origin of the gypsum rocks is due to late alteration of anhydrite by migration of sharp hydration fronts. The hydration is a two step process and is revealed by the presence in the gypsum rocks of corroded anhydrite micro-relies and authigenic quartz crystals which include anhydrite. The role of the Burano Evaporites during the Apennines tectogenesis can be depicted as follows: (a) prevalent deposition of gypsum in the Upper Triassic; (b) gypsum dehydration at burial conditions to form anhydrite (Cretaceous?); (c) syn-tectonic flow of anhydrite rocks, brecciation of dolostones; syn-tectonic growth stage of quartz euhedra at deep burial conditions possibly related {{to the development of the}} Oligocene-Miocene greenschist facies Apuane metamorphic complex; (d) hydrothermal deposition of sparry magnesite and partial Mg-metasomatic replacement of dolostones by magnesite; (e) sub-surface dissolution of halite to form thick matrix-supported residual caprock-like anhydrite mega-breccias; (f) complete gypsification of anhydrite at sub-surface conditions; and (g) evaporite dissolution at surface exposure producing dolostone breccias with partial calcitization and removal of most clasts (Calcare cavernoso).

40|$|On {{the basis}} of DEM analysis, we examine the tectonic {{geomorphology}} of the Apennines in central Italy {{to figure out the}} topographic evidence for how Apennines landscape was shaped by its emergence above sea level, in the tectonic context of a growing mountain chain. Geologic and geomorphic data suggest that its topographic growth was slow during the phase of crustal shortening (Miocene-Pliocene), but accelerated at the end of lower Pleistocene, when tectonics was already dominated by extension. Such different uplift rates should influence the development of the resulting landforms. We investigate the topography and the drainage features of a E-W transect across central Italy, focusing on topographic metrics, drainage pattern and stream long profiles. The results indicate that the Apennines topography is characterized by the superimposition of a short wavelength (10 - 30 km wide spacing), linked to local tectonic structures (extensional on the Tyrrhenian side and compressive on the Adriatic side), and a long one that corresponds to a broad topographic bulge 200 - 300 km wide, that records a regional uplift. As a response, the rivers incised the topography of the growing chain mostly the same and, interacting with climate changes, generated at least three major inset alluvial terraces. In particular, on the Tyrrhenian side, the rectangular drainage pattern indicates the strong influence of the extensional tectonics. This is also evident in the stream long profiles, where knickpoints and knickzones correspond with tectonic lineaments and extensional basins respectively. The hydrographic network draining to the Adriatic Sea shows a parallel pattern. The knickpoints of the stream long profiles generally correspond to rock changes and to very deep and narrow gorges, where the rivers incised the compressive structures reaching their cores.
