5|$|In {{the second}} half of the 2nd century in North Africa, a {{distinctive}} type of nozzle tube shape was developed in the tradition of the terracotta tube dome at the Hellenistic era baths of Morgantina, an idea that had been preserved in the use of interlocking terracotta pots for kiln roofs. This tube could be mass-produced on potter's wheels and interlocked to form a permanent <b>centering</b> for concrete domes, avoiding the use of wooden <b>centering</b> altogether. This spread mainly in the western Mediterranean.|$|E
5|$|The {{technique}} of building lightweight domes with interlocking hollow ceramic tubes further developed in North Africa and Italy {{in the late}} 3rd and early 4th centuries. By the 4th century, the thin and lightweight tubed vaulting had become a vaulting technique in its own right, rather than simply serving as a permanent <b>centering</b> for concrete. It was used in early Christian buildings in Italy. Arranging these terracotta tubes in a continuous spiral created a dome that was not strong enough for very large spans, but required only minimal <b>centering</b> and formwork. The later dome of the Baptistry of Neon in Ravenna is an example.|$|E
