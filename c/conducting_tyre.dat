40|$|Abstract — For the {{certification}} of any tyre to be declared legal and safe {{to be used}} on roads it is mandatory that it is tested at an accredited homologation lab. One of the mandatory test for this purpose is the plunger test where the tyre is tested for its strength. Also present in homologation labs is the side door intrusion test which is in use less frequently. This paper deals with the design, fabrication and testing of an adapter assembly by which {{we are able to}} increase the utility of the side door intrusion test facility by using it to <b>conduct</b> the <b>tyre</b> strength test.

40|$|The {{design and}} {{application}} of armour is a science rather than a codified branch of engineering. Whilst all professional engineers follow sound engineering principles and practice, I suspect that some might mistakenly believe that {{the application of the}} engineering process is all that is required for optimised, risk-free armour solutions, like choosing the optimum tyre for a car based upon the <b>conduct</b> of standardised <b>tyre</b> testing. The science of armour materials is a specialised, cross-disciplinary subject not taught within the educational system and most armour technologists, like me, learn on the job. To begin to understand the underpinning science we must first consider the operational environment and then, most importantly, the threat...|$|R
40|$|The study {{presented}} in this article investigated the potential use of tyre derived fuel-diesel blends as an alternative low cost fuel for compression ignition engines. A short review was <b>conducted</b> on waste <b>tyre</b> pyrolysis technology and its benefits in addressing the waste tyre management while providing an alternative usable fuel for diesel engines. Crude oil obtained from slow pyrolysis of waste tyres was distillated and its respective fractions were characterized and blended with low sulphur diesel fuel for fuelling a stationery truck engine linked to a hydraulic dynamometer. The test results revealed that fuel fraction blends with low sulphur diesel can be used to fuel a conventional compression ignition engine, however special attention is required to manage the exhausts emission due to high concentration of sulphur dioxide. There is no doubt that tyre derived fuel has a potential as future alternative fuel for compression ignition engines...|$|R
40|$|Problem statement: Nowadays, the use {{of waste}} tyre in {{concrete}} has become technically feasible and the tyre mixed concrete is light weight and called as rubberized concrete. Still the research is going on to explore basic Engineering Properties such as Transport Properties viz, Acid Absorption Test, Water Absorption Tests, Impact Resistance, Modulus of Elasticity, Dynamic Modulus and so on. In this study, the studies are limited to Acid Absorption Test, Water Absorption Test and Energy Absorbed by Impact. Approach: Experimental Investigations were <b>conducted</b> on <b>tyre</b> fiber specimens with different variables such as Length, Diameter of Holes and percentage of coarse aggregate replacement by tyre fibers. Impact Resistance Test was done by ACI standard and Acid and Water Absorptions Tests were conducted by Indian Standard. Results: In this study, Experimental results based on the water absorption, acid resistance and impact resistance of the rubberized concrete were analyzed. These experiments were conducted on rubberized concrete with tyre fibers mixed in different sizes and proportions by weight with the coarse aggregate. The specimens were immersed in water and in diluted HCL (5 % concentration) acid for 28 days and tested. Conclusion: The results obtained from the tests {{were used to determine}} the optimum size of the tyre fiber specimen {{that could be used in}} the rubberized concrete mixture to give the optimum performance. The rubberized concrete with tyre fiber specimen L 50 -D 5 10 % has shown good transport characteristics and impact resistance...|$|R
40|$|This study {{involves}} {{several aspects}} of environmental research, namely, adsorbent preparation, characterisation and wastewater treatment. Lower ash tyre activated carbon was produced with demineralisation prior to the activation. Detailed physical and chemical characterisations of the produced activated carbon were <b>conducted.</b> The <b>tyre</b> demineralised activation carbons are generally mesoporous with the surface area upto 960 m 2 /g. The adsorption capacity of four dyes, namely, acid dyes (Acid Blue 25, AB 25 and Acid Yellow 117, AY 117) and basic dyes (Methylene Blue, MB and Maxilon Red, MR) and phenol onto the produced carbons for both single and binary component systems was studied. Tyre activated carbon, C 3 has the highest capacity among all of them with maximum capacities of 1. 2 mmol/g of AB 25, 0. 58 mmol/g of AY 117, 1. 17 mmol/g of MB and 0. 7 mmol/g of MR, which {{is higher than the}} literature value for commercial activated carbon F 400. However, in the case of phenol, the microporous F 400 is better. Four single component isotherm equations were tested in this study, namely, Langmuir, Freundlich, Redlich-Peterson and Langmuir-Freundlich. The differences in the SSE values are actually not so significant, so in general, all four models do not show significant differences. The binary component adsorption studies are presented and modelled with various binary component equilibrium isotherm including Extended Langmuir, Extended-Langmuir-Freundlich, Extended-Redlich Peterson, Extended Freundlich, P-factor, Interaction factor, and finally the IAST-Langmuir and IAST-Langmuir-Freundlich. For both acid and basic dye binary systems with the three tyre activated carbon C 5, C 7 and C 9, the Extended Freundlich model was best fitted to the experimental data. This suggests significant non-ideal effects and heterogeneous surfaces of the tyre activated carbons. Overall, none of the predictive binary models can describe the adsorption data well; this means the general assumption of the idea system is not applicable...|$|R
40|$|To {{facilitate}} {{tyre-road noise}} prediction, a computationally efficient high frequency tyre model is needed. Such models {{are always a}} compromise between the desired accuracy {{and the need for}} simplicity. In addition the accuracy of models is often limited by the quality of the input data available. For passenger car or truck tyres, a complete set of input data can be obtained only from the tyre manufacturer. However, this may not always be possible and one has to rely instead on approximate material data obtained from the careful study of experiments <b>conducted</b> on <b>tyres.</b> Although much research is available for passenger car tyres, less attention is paid to truck tyres. The work described in this thesis has the goal to close this gap by an experimental investigation of the vibrational behaviour of a truck tyre exposed to external forces. Driving point mobility and transfer mobility measurements are made to understand the behaviour of truck tyres, to gain insight into what may be the most suitable way to model truck tyres, and to extract material data for this modelling. A methodology was developed, which allows for the calculation of key tyre parameters, such as total bending stiffness and Youngs modulus from driving point mobility. These parameters are used in a 3 -D orthotropic double-plate model based on elastic field equations as developed for passenger tyres. A WFEM model is also used to understand the limitations of modelling a tyre as a structure with homogenous geometry (i. e. thickness and material properties identical over the whole cross section). Results from the 3 -D orthotropic double plate model are compared with measured tyre response functions. One can conclude from these results that the data obtained from measurements, as well as the model, can successfully be used later for simulation of contact forces in the tyre-road noise prediction models. </p...|$|R
40|$|In this thesis, {{the impact}} of staged {{combustion}} on the operation of a precalciner cement kiln, is considered. Mathematical modelling and full-scale experiments at the Norcem cement works in Brevik, Norway, {{is the basis for}} the thesis. The goal of the work was to characterize and explain operational disturbances related to the application of alternative solid fuels in staged combustion, and to take actions to avoid such disturbances. A mass and energy balance of a precalciner cement kiln system, Mebcem, was implemented in Matlab, and used as a tool for analysis of the kiln system, planning of experiments and interpretation of experimental data. The mass balance was calibrated and validated by means of process data collected during tests. Full-scale experiments using plastic as reburning fuel in the kiln inlet proved a NOx reduction potential of about 40 %. However, operational disturbances related to an alteration of the internal material cycles in the kiln system, were also experienced. To be able to analyse the sulphur chemistry at the kiln inlet, a program for the calculation of thermodynamic equilibria, Seacem, was implemented in Matlab. The thermodynamic analysis indicated that contact between fuel, precalcined meal and kiln gas caused the operational disturbances. This was supported by thermogravimetric analyses. Furthermore, CFD calculations conducted with FluentR, and laboratory experiments carried out to determine the entrainment velocity of various alternative fuels, demonstrated that, in the kiln system that was studied, such contact is hard to avoid. Based on these findings, a mechanism explaining the phenomena observed in the experiments was suggested, and a re-location of the feeding point for alternative fuels was prescribed. In subsequent experiments with a new feeding point location where precalcined meal, reburning fuel and kiln gas was not brought into simultaneous contact operational impacts were avoided or strongly reduced. However, the NOx reduction efficiency was at the same time reduced to about 20 %. One trial with so-called lean reburning was <b>conducted.</b> Whole car <b>tyres</b> were fed to the rotary kiln, and a 25 % reduction in NOx emissions was demonstrated by this technique. As part of the experimental program, the distribution of sulphur, sodium, potassium and chlorine all circulating elements in the kiln system, was determined. This was achieved by analysing a large number of meal and gas samples from the process, in combination with a program for the calculation of internal material cycles, Circcem, implemented in Matlab. For S, K and Na, the balance errors were in the interval 5 - 7 %, while the chlorine imbalance was much larger. The very intense circulation of chlorine explains why it is difficult to obtain a material balance for chlorine in a cement kiln system. A procedure for optimizing the degree of sulphatization of the alkalis in the clinker was also developed. By means of this procedure it is possible to control the internal material cycles of the kiln system, and hence have an improved basis for staged combustion...|$|R
