5|$|If two of {{the three}} given circles do not intersect, a center of {{inversion}} can be chosen so that those two given circles become <b>concentric.</b> Under this inversion, the solution circles must fall within the annulus between the two <b>concentric</b> circles. Therefore, they belong to two one-parameter families. In the first family (Figure7), the solutions do not enclose the inner <b>concentric</b> circle, but rather revolve like ball bearings in the annulus. In the second family (Figure8), the solution circles enclose the inner <b>concentric</b> circle. There are generally four solutions for each family, yielding eight possible solutions, consistent with the algebraic solution.|$|E
5|$|Stripes, whirls and <b>concentric</b> circles {{should not}} take up {{a large part of}} the {{television}} screen.|$|E
5|$|The {{design of}} the inner bailey, with its wall studded with {{semi-circular}} projections, is unparalleled. This innovation had two advantages: firstly, the rounded wall absorbed the damage from siege engines much better as it did not provide a perfect angle to aim at; secondly, the arrowslits in the curved wall allowed arrows to be fired at all angles. The inner bailey, which contained the main residential buildings, used the principles of <b>concentric</b> defence. This and the unusual {{design of the}} inner bailey's curtain wall meant that castle was advanced for its age, since it was built before <b>concentric</b> fortification was fully developed in Crusader castles such as Krak des Chevaliers. <b>Concentric</b> castles were widely copied across Europe; for instance when Edward I of England—who had himself been on Crusade—built castles in Wales in the late 13thcentury, four of the eight he founded were <b>concentric.</b>|$|E
5|$|Any initial two {{disjoint}} given circles can {{be rendered}} <b>concentric</b> as follows. The radical {{axis of the}} two given circles is constructed; choosing two arbitrary points P and Q on this radical axis, two circles can be constructed that are centered on P and Q and that intersect the two given circles orthogonally. These two constructed circles intersect each other in two points. Inversion in one such intersection point F renders the constructed circles into straight lines emanating from F and the two given circles into <b>concentric</b> circles, with the third given circle becoming another circle (in general). This follows because the system of circles is equivalent {{to a set of}} Apollonian circles, forming a bipolar coordinate system.|$|E
5|$|Clement also {{introduced}} the pendulum suspension spring in 1671. The <b>concentric</b> minute hand {{was added to}} the clock by Daniel Quare, a London clock-maker, and the Second Hand was introduced.|$|E
5|$|<b>Concentric</b> castles {{were widely}} copied across Europe, for {{instance}} when Edward I of England– who had himself been on Crusade– built castles in Wales {{in the late}} 13thcentury, four of the eight he founded had a <b>concentric</b> design. Not all {{the features of the}} Crusader castles from the 13thcentury were emulated in Europe. For instance, it was common in Crusader castles to have the main gate in the side of a tower and for there to be two turns in the passageway, lengthening the time it took for someone to reach the outer enclosure. It is rare for this bent entrance to be found in Europe.|$|E
5|$|One {{significant}} {{feature on}} Ganymede {{is a dark}} plain named Galileo Regio, which contains a series of <b>concentric</b> grooves, or furrows, likely created {{during a period of}} geologic activity.|$|E
5|$|The Doughnut is {{surrounded}} by car and bicycle parking in <b>concentric</b> rings, guarded by a two-metre metal fence {{and half a dozen}} vehicle checkpoints. The Doughnut is served by an underground road.|$|E
5|$|A {{hologram}}, used on {{the note}} which appears to see the hologram image change between the value and a window or doorway, but in the background, {{it appears to be}} rainbow-coloured <b>concentric</b> circles of micro-letters moving from the centre to the edges of the patch.|$|E
5|$|At {{various places}} along the coast, {{large numbers of}} QZ bunkers were built in groups of three, linked to each other by a {{prefabricated}} concrete tunnel. Elsewhere bunkers were constructed in groupings around strategic points across the country, or in lines across swathes of territory. Tirana was particularly heavily defended, with thousands of bunkers radiating out in fifty <b>concentric</b> circles around the city.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 13thcentury, Crusader castles were mostly built by Military Orders {{including}} the Knights Hospitaller, Knights Templar, and Teutonic Knights. The orders {{were responsible for}} the foundation of sites such as Krak des Chevaliers, Margat, and Belvoir. Design varied not just between orders, but between individual castles, though it was common for those founded in this period to have <b>concentric</b> defences.|$|E
5|$|Kahn {{structured}} {{the library}} in three <b>concentric</b> square rings. The outer ring, which is built of load-bearing brick, includes all four exterior {{walls and the}} library carrel spaces immediately inside them. The middle ring, which is built of reinforced concrete, holds the heavy book stacks. The inner ring is a dramatic atrium with enormous circular openings in its walls that reveal several floors of book stacks.|$|E
5|$|Later famous horologists {{included}} John Arnold {{who made}} the first practical and accurate modern watch by refining Harrison's chronometer, Thomas Earnshaw {{who was the first}} to make these available to the public, Daniel Quare, who invented a repeating watch movement, a portable barometer and introduced the <b>concentric</b> minute hand.|$|E
5|$|Many castles were {{originally}} built from earth and timber, but had their defences replaced later by stone. Early castles often exploited natural defences, lacking {{features such as}} towers and arrowslits and relying on a central keep. In the late 12thand early 13thcenturies, a scientific approach to castle defence emerged. This led to the proliferation of towers, {{with an emphasis on}} flanking fire. Many new castles were polygonal or relied on <b>concentric</b> defence– several stages of defence within each other that could all function {{at the same time to}} maximise the castle's firepower. These changes in defence have been attributed to a mixture of castle technology from the Crusades, such as <b>concentric</b> fortification, and inspiration from earlier defences, such as Roman forts. Not all the elements of castle architecture were military in nature, so that devices such as moats evolved from their original purpose of defence into symbols of power. Some grand castles had long winding approaches intended to impress and dominate their landscape.|$|E
5|$|Most Hippeastrum bulbs are {{tunicate}} (a protective dry {{outer layer}} and fleshy <b>concentric</b> inner scales or leaf bases). The bulbs are generally between 512cm (2"5") {{in diameter and}} produce two to seven long-lasting evergreen or deciduous leaves that are 3090cm (12"36") long and 2.55cm (1"2") wide. The leaves are hysteranthous (develop after flowering), sessile, rarely persistent and subpetiolate.|$|E
5|$|Near {{the end of}} {{the twelfth}} century, the Spanish Muslim {{astronomer}} al-Bitrūjī (Alpetragius) sought to explain the complex motions of the planets without Ptolemy's epicycles and eccentrics, using an Aristotelian framework of purely <b>concentric</b> spheres that moved with differing speeds from east to west. This model was much less accurate as a predictive astronomical model, but it was discussed by later European astronomers and philosophers.|$|E
5|$|Oolitic sand: The {{lake and}} its shores contain oolitic sand, which are small, rounded, or spherical {{grains of sand}} {{made up of a}} nucleus (generally a small mineral grain) and <b>concentric</b> layers of calcium {{carbonate}} (lime) and look similar to very small pearls.|$|E
5|$|Other, unusual {{types of}} MS have been described; these include Devic's disease, Balo <b>concentric</b> sclerosis, Schilder's diffuse sclerosis, and Marburg {{multiple}} sclerosis. There is debate {{on whether they}} are MS variants or different diseases. Multiple sclerosis behaves differently in children, taking more time to reach the progressive stage. Nevertheless, they still reach it at a lower average age than adults usually do.|$|E
5|$|Proposals for {{the route}} first {{arose in the}} 1960s {{as part of the}} London Ringways plan, which would have seen four <b>concentric</b> {{circular}} motorways built in the city, together with radial routes, with the M11 motorway ending on Ringway 1, the innermost Ringway, at Hackney Marsh.|$|E
5|$|Several {{designs for}} new castles emerged that made keeps unnecessary. One such design was the <b>concentric</b> approach, {{involving}} exterior walls guarded with towers, and perhaps supported by further, <b>concentric</b> layered defenses: thus castles such as Framlingham {{never had a}} central keep. Military factors may well have driven this development: R. Brown, for example, suggests that designs with a separate keep and bailey system inherently lacked a co-ordinated and combined defensive system, and that once bailey walls were sophisticated enough, a keep became militarily unnecessary. In England, gatehouses were also growing in size and sophistication until they too challenged {{the need for a}} keep in the same castle. The classic Edwardian gatehouse, with two large, flanking towers and multiple portcullises, designed to be defended from attacks both within and outside the main castle, has been often compared to the earlier Norman keeps: some of the largest gatehouses are called gatehouse keeps for this reason.|$|E
5|$|The American {{architect}} Walter Burley Griffin won {{the contest}} and {{was invited to}} Australia to oversee {{the construction of the}} nation's new capital after the judges' decision was ratified by King O'Malley, the Minister for Home Affairs. Griffin's proposal, which had an abundance of geometric patterns, incorporated <b>concentric</b> hexagonal and octagonal streets emanating from several radii.|$|E
5|$|The {{rock art}} of Soacha-Sibaté, in the {{southwest}} of the Bogotá savanna, has been studied in detail between 1970 and 2006, after initial studies by Triana. In these petrographs certain motives have been described; triangular heads are pictographs of human figures where the heads are painted in a triangular shape. They are applied using red colours and demonstrate various sizes. Similar motives are noted in Mongua, Tenjo and Tibacuy. In most cases of the rock art on the Altiplano, the body extremities, such as hands, are shown in simple shapes. In some cases however, the hands are elaborated with much more detail using spirals, <b>concentric</b> circles and more strokes, identified as complex hands. Apart from Sibaté, these shapes are encountered also in Saboyá and Tibaná in Boyacá. A third class of petrographs has been named radial representations. This motive shows the main figures with <b>concentric</b> square or circular lines drawn around them. The <b>concentric</b> circular drawings have been interpreted as representing the main deities of the Muisca religion; Chía (the Moon) and Sué, her husband the Sun. Rhomboidal motives are found in Sibaté, but their exact purpose {{has not yet been}} concluded. Both in Soacha and in Sibaté a fifth type of petrographs has been identified; winged figures. These motives resemble the birds that are described in tunjos and ceramics of the Altiplano.|$|E
5|$|The same scholar has {{performed}} {{detailed analysis of}} the rock art in Facatativá; the Piedras del Tunjo Archaeological Park. The many petrographs in this location are painted using red, yellow, ochre, blue, black and white colours. The motives show a possible tobacco plant, commonly used by the Muisca, zig-zag patterns, anthropomorphic figures, <b>concentric</b> lines similar to those in Soacha and Sáchica, zoomorphic motives and anthropo-zoomorphic composites in the shape of frogs.|$|E
5|$|Traces {{of onions}} {{recovered}} from Bronze Age settlements in China suggest that onions {{were used as}} far back as 5000 BCE, not only for their flavour, but the bulb's durability to store and transport. Ancient Egyptians revered the onion bulb, viewing its spherical shape and <b>concentric</b> rings as symbols of eternal life. Onions were used in Egyptian burials, as evidenced by onion traces found in the eye sockets of Ramesses IV.|$|E
5|$|A shell {{galaxy is}} a type of {{elliptical}} galaxy where the stars in the galaxy's halo are arranged in <b>concentric</b> shells. About one-tenth of elliptical galaxies have a shell-like structure, which has never been observed in spiral galaxies. The shell-like structures are thought to develop when a larger galaxy absorbs a smaller companion galaxy. As the two galaxy centers approach, the centers start to oscillate around a center point, the oscillation creates gravitational ripples forming the shells of stars, similar to ripples spreading on water. For example, galaxy NGC 3923 has over twenty shells.|$|E
5|$|Angkor Wat, {{located at}} , {{is a unique}} {{combination}} of the temple mountain (the standard design for the empire's state temples) and the later plan of <b>concentric</b> galleries. The temple is a representation of Mount Meru, {{the home of the}} gods: the central quincunx of towers symbolises the five peaks of the mountain, and the walls and moat symbolise the surrounding mountain ranges and ocean. Access to the upper areas of the temple was progressively more exclusive, with the laity being admitted only to the lowest level.|$|E
5|$|Canberra is {{a planned}} {{city and the}} inner-city area was {{originally}} designed by Walter Burley Griffin, a major 20th-century American architect. Within the central area of the city near Lake Burley Griffin, major roads follow a wheel-and-spoke pattern rather than a grid. Griffin's proposal had an abundance of geometric patterns, including <b>concentric</b> hexagonal and octagonal streets emanating from several radii. However, the outer areas of the city, built later, are not laid out geometrically.|$|E
5|$|Even where metal {{objects such}} as bowls and dishes {{do not seem to}} have {{geometric}} decoration, still the designs, such as arabesques, are often set in octagonal compartments or arranged in <b>concentric</b> bands around the object. Both closed designs (which do not repeat) and open or repetitive patterns are used. Patterns such as interlaced six-pointed stars were especially popular from the 12thcentury. Eva Baer notes that while this design was essentially simple, it was elaborated by metalworkers into intricate patterns interlaced with arabesques, sometimes organised around further basic Islamic patterns, such as the hexagonal pattern of six overlapping circles.|$|E
5|$|Eyespots are {{a type of}} automimicry used by some lepidopterans. In butterflies, {{the spots}} are {{composed}} of <b>concentric</b> rings of scales of different colours. The proposed role of the eyespots is to deflect predators' attention. Their resemblance to eyes provokes the predator's instinct to attack these wing patterns. The role of filamentous tails in Lycaenidae has been suggested as confusing predators as to the real location of the head, giving them {{a better chance of}} escaping alive and relatively unscathed.|$|E
5|$|Goodrich Castle was {{probably}} built by Godric of Mappestone after the Norman invasion of England, initially as an earth and wooden fortification. In {{the middle of}} the 12th century the original castle was replaced with a stone keep, and was then expanded significantly during the late 13th century into a <b>concentric</b> structure combining luxurious living quarters with extensive defences. The success of Goodrich's design influenced many other constructions across England over the following years. It became the seat of the powerful Talbot family before falling out of favour as a residence in late Tudor times.|$|E
5|$|His first {{project for}} Webb and Knapp was an {{apartment}} building with funding from the Housing Act of 1949. Pei's design {{was based on a}} circular tower with <b>concentric</b> rings. The areas closest to the supporting pillar handled utilities and circulation; the apartments themselves were located toward the outer edge. Zeckendorf loved the design and even showed it off to Le Corbusier when they met. The cost of such an unusual design was too high, however, and the building never moved beyond the model stage.|$|E
5|$|In 2003, a state ensign {{was created}} {{specifically}} for non-military vessels engaged in non-commercial government service; this defaces the Italian tricolour {{with the national}} coat of arms. Since 1914, the Italian Air Force have also used a roundel of <b>concentric</b> rings in the colours of the tricolor as aircraft marking; substituted, from 1923 to 1943, by encircled fasces. The Frecce Tricolori, officially known as the 313º Gruppo Addestramento Acrobatico, is its aerobatic demonstration team.|$|E
5|$|Inside the {{magnetosphere}} is the plasmasphere, a donut-shaped region containing low-energy charged particles, or plasma. This region {{begins at}} {{a height of}} 60km, extends up to 3 or 4 Earth radii, and includes the ionosphere. This region rotates with the Earth. There are also two <b>concentric</b> tire-shaped regions, called the Van Allen radiation belts, with high-energy ions (energies from 0.1 to 10million electron volts (MeV)). The inner belt is 1–2Earth radii out while the outer belt is at 4–7Earth radii. The plasmasphere and Van Allen belts have partial overlap, with the extent of overlap varying greatly with solar activity.|$|E
5|$|Jahangir's Quadrangle {{occupies}} the northeastern {{corner of the}} fort. Though named for Jahangir, construction on the site began in 1617 or 1618 {{during the reign of}} Akbar, but was completed in 1620 under Jahangir. Akbar's syncretic style is noted in the quadrangle, as it employs column brackets carved in the form of animals. The quadrangle's layout differs from other Mughal quadrangles which are based upon the layout of a Persian paradise garden, and instead is formed by <b>concentric</b> rectangles with a fountain in its centre.|$|E
5|$|Macroolithus is an oogenus (fossil-egg genus) of dinosaur egg {{belonging}} to the oofamily Elongatoolithidae. The type oospecies, M. rugustus, was originally described under the now-defunct oogenus name Oolithes. Three other oospecies are known: M. yaotunensis, M. mutabilis, and M. lashuyuanensis. They are relatively large, elongated eggs with a two-layered eggshell. Their nests consist of large, <b>concentric</b> rings of paired eggs. There is evidence of blue-green pigmentation in its shell, which may have helped camouflage the nests.|$|E
5|$|Madurai {{is built}} around the Meenakshi Amman Temple, which acted as the {{geographic}} and ritual centre of the ancient city of Madurai. The city is divided {{into a number of}} <b>concentric</b> quadrangular streets around the temple. Vishwanatha Nayak (1529–64 CE), the first Madurai Nayak king, redesigned the city in accordance with the principles laid out by Shilpa Shastras (Sanskrit: , also anglicised as silpa sastra meaning rules of architecture) related to urban planning. These squares retain their traditional names of Aadi, Chittirai, Avani-moola and Masi streets, corresponding to the Tamil month names and also to the festivals associated. The temple prakarams (outer precincts of a temple) and streets accommodate an elobrate festival calendar in which dramatic processions circumambulate the shrines at varying distances from the centre. The temple chariots used in processions are progressively larger in size based {{on the size of the}} <b>concentric</b> streets. Ancient Tamil classics record the temple as the centre of the city and the surrounding streets appearing liken a lotus and its petals. The city's axes were aligned with the four quarters of the compass, and the four gateways of the temple provided access to it. The wealthy and higher echelons of the society were placed in streets close to the temple, while the poorest were placed in the fringe streets. With the advent of British rule during the 19th century, Madurai became the headquarters of a large colonial political complex and an industrial town; with urbanisation, the social hierarchical classes became unified.|$|E
