40|$|The {{utilization}} of <b>cajaput</b> <b>tree</b> species for cajuput oil {{production in the}} Wasur National Park (NP) should be supported by accurate data and information. It becomes important because uncontrolled exploitation can lead to disruption of the national park function. This study aims to determine the spatial distribution of three cajuput tree species, i. e Asteromyrtus symphyocarpa, Melaleuca cajuputi and Melalueca viridiflora existed in Wasur NP region. The {{results of this study}} showed that, in general, the distribution of those three cajuput oil species mostly in Yanggandur area. They are mainly concentrated around the Yanggandur village, Mbembi village, Wasur village and Sota village. Those species were mostly found around wamps, especially in the Sermayam, Rawa Buaya and Rawa Biru. The total area of those three species was 103, 011. 75 ha, which was dominated by A. symphyocarpa (8. 30 % of the total area of the NP), followed by M. cajuputi (8. 27 % of the total area of the NP) and M. viridiflora (7. 03 % of the total area of the NP). In general, A. symphyocarpa dominantly grow on type of Kambisol soil, where as M. cajuputi and M. viridi flora dominantly grow on soils type of Kambisol and Gleysol...|$|E
