5|$|The Supreme Court {{held that}} Indian tribes {{have a common}} law <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> <b>action</b> for possessory land claims based upon {{aboriginal}} title, that the Nonintercourse Act did not preempt that <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> <b>action,</b> and that the <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> <b>action</b> was not barred by a statute of limitations, abatement, implicit federal ratification, or nonjusticiability. Four dissenting justices would have held for the counties on the defense of laches, a question which the majority did not reach, but expressed doubts about.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the case}} has not been {{formally}} overruled, two Supreme Court decisions in the 1970s and 1980s have undone its effect by ruling that there is federal subject-matter jurisdiction for a federal common law <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> <b>action</b> for recovering possession based on the common-law doctrine of aboriginal title. Moreover, the New York courts' interpretation of the Nonintercourse Act is no longer good law. Modern federal courts hold that only Congress can ratify a conveyance of aboriginal title, and only with a clear statement, rather than implicitly.|$|E

5|$|In March 2013, {{two studies}} were {{published}} showing that neonicotinoids affect bee long-term and short-term memory, suggesting a <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> <b>action</b> resulting in failure {{to return to}} the hive. In another study done in 2013, scientists reported that experiments suggested that exposure to the neonicotinoid pesticides clothianidin and imidicloprid results in increased levels of a particular protein in bees that inhibits a key molecule involved in the immune response, making the insects more susceptible to attack by harmful viruses.|$|E
5|$|Before {{the passing}} of the 1963 Act, the only {{exceptions}} to the normal statute of limitations (three years after the events that caused the injury, as established by the Law Reform (Limitation of Actions, etc.) Act 1954) were if the claim was being brought for a case of mistake or fraud, in which case the statute of limitations was twelve months from when the claimant could reasonably have been expected to discover the fraud or mistake. In Cartledge v E. Jopling & Sons Ltd the claimant sued Jopling after he developed pneumoconiosis from working in the company's poorly ventilated steel mills. The injuries were sustained in October 1950 but they were not discovered until 1956, and as a result the injured party had no <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> <b>action.</b> Because the injuries had not been discovered until six years after they were caused, and the statute of limitations was three years after the injury itself, Cartledge was not legally allowed to bring a case.|$|E

40|$|The {{recognition}} of the wrongful birth and wrongful life <b>causes</b> <b>of</b> <b>action</b> by the Washington State Supreme Court is supported by both policy rationales and legal theories. Wrongful birth and wrongful life <b>causes</b> <b>of</b> <b>action</b> receive support from traditional tort principles and, more important, further public policy by deterring negligent genetic counseling and negligent preconception medical treatment. This Note describes the legal history of these claims and analyzes several issues not addressed by the Washington court. In addition, this Note criticizes a more recent decision by the court, which limits wrongful conception <b>causes</b> <b>of</b> <b>action,</b> because that decision conflicts with the policy arguments presented in Harbeson...|$|R

25|$|Because the {{misfeasance}} provision reflects <b>causes</b> <b>of</b> <b>action</b> {{vested in}} the company, any money recovered under it is held {{so that it}} will go to pay off creditors in their ordinary order of priority. In Re Anglo-Austrian Printing & Publishing Union this meant that a liquidator who had successfully sued directors for £7000 had to give up the funds to a group of debenture holders, who had not yet been paid in full, so there is no discretion to apply the assets in favour of unsecured creditors. A potential benefit is that because the <b>causes</b> <b>of</b> <b>action</b> are vested in the company, they may be assigned to third parties, who may prefer to take the risk and reward of pursuing litigation over the liquidator or administrator. These features are the reverse for money recovered through the statutory based <b>causes</b> <b>of</b> <b>action</b> <b>of</b> fraudulent and wrongful trading.|$|R
40|$|This Essay {{examines}} {{a specific}} area that Justice Scalia influenced through {{the methods of}} interpretation that he applied—namely, the question of “implied rights <b>of</b> <b>action.</b> ” The idea that federal courts historically applied common law <b>causes</b> <b>of</b> <b>action</b> to remedy federal statutory violations without congressional authorization is a myth. From the first, federal courts heard only those <b>causes</b> <b>of</b> <b>action</b> that Congress had authorized them to hear. And {{there is reason to}} think that early federal courts would not have been understood to have power to define their own <b>causes</b> <b>of</b> <b>action</b> had Congress not provided this authorization from the start. At a minimum, however, historical practice does not establish that early federal courts understood themselves to have power to define and apply common law actions for federal statutory violations absent congressional authorization to do so...|$|R
