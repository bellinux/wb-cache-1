In short, important improvements have occurred in Ethiopia’s <b>cereal</b> <b>marketing</b> system. This is especially important because dysfunctional <b>cereal</b> <b>markets</b> were previously identified as an important cause of food insecurity in the country. status: publishe...|$|R

A well functioning <b>cereal</b> <b>market</b> is a prerequisite for attaining food security, which is of great concern in many African countries. In Burkina Faso, food security is a problem for {{a large part of the}} population. Before discussing in the next section the objectives and research questions analysed in this thesis, I briefly discuss some problems of the <b>cereal</b> <b>market</b> in Burkina Faso first. Although the research concentrates on Burkina Faso, problems in many other developing countries are similar, so that the scope of this research is not restricted to the case of Burkina Faso only. ...|$|R

40|$|Beginning in 1981, the {{government}} of Mali undertook several policy reforms to allow participation of private traders in <b>cereal</b> <b>marketing,</b> which up to that date was officially controlled by a parastatal. These reforms {{can be expected to}} have an impact on the working of the <b>cereals</b> <b>market.</b> One of the main objectives of this study is to assess the performance of the <b>cereal</b> <b>marketing</b> system. The task is to study how different markets are interrelated in terms of price formation, by using wholesale and retail price data and different techniques of analysis. These methods of analysis include bivariate correlations, calculation of margins, and multiple regression techniques. Not only is the research aimed at showing the differences and similarities of the different methods of analysis, but also at showing the strength and weaknesses of different data sets on cereal prices in Mali. Another objective of this paper is to study the price interrelationships across commodities in order to determine the degree of substitutability between the cereals involved.

40|$|Within {{the context}} of {{liberalisation}} experienced by the Malian economy {{since the beginning of}} the 1990 s, spatial integration of <b>cereal</b> <b>markets</b> has been considered as a major tool as to avoid localised shortages due to production shortfalls. However, market dynamic reveals since then new patterns: the diversification of urban consumer demand towards "modern cereals", in particular rice and maize, drives the segmentation of the <b>cereal</b> <b>market.</b> As consumer s are likely to substitute traditional cereals, like millet and sorghum, for other <b>cereal</b> types, new <b>market</b> segments emerge. We account for this evolution with a theoretical model à la Hotelling : the good is considered according to two characteristics, the spatial localisation (local <b>market)</b> and the <b>cereal</b> type. We show that, as far as market integration implies the reduction of transaction, it affects the strategic decisions of sellers. In fact, incentives to invest in product differentiation (and exploit new market segments) rises relatively to the incentives to take advantage of spatial price differentials, as they decrease. Last, we test this analytical proposition on price data collected by the agricultural market information system (SIM/PAM) from 1990 to 2004 on 6 local markets in central and northern Mali. We apply a vector error - correction model, and find evidence for the intensification of spatial co- integration relations during the period. Moreover, we relate this latter dynamics to the evolution towards the segmentation of <b>cereal</b> <b>markets</b> in Mali. Last, the leader markets of this progression are identified as being the central urban markets. product differentiation, co- integration, <b>cereals,</b> Mali, <b>Marketing,...</b>|$|R

40|$|The general {{objective}} {{of the study is}} to evaluate the performance of <b>cereal</b> <b>market</b> and the specific objectives are: to analyze the current status of <b>cereal</b> <b>markets,</b> to identify constraints of the <b>cereal</b> <b>market,</b> to analyze the integration of markets around Mekelle, and to analyze the role of cooperative societies in Tigray in the out put market. The populations of the respondents are 50 traders, 50 consumers and 100 farmers and 25 experts that is, total of 225. The method of sampling is simple random sampling for traders and systematic sampling method for consumers and farmers. This is because there is no list of consumers and farmers coming to the market inaddition the list of the farmers in each tabia is huge that makes the simple random sampling more difficult, so as a solution the systematic random sampling method is chosen. The performance of the <b>cereal</b> <b>market</b> using concentration ratio has shown that the <b>cereal</b> <b>market</b> is competitive that is the market share of the 4 largest traders is 22. 31 %, 19. 12 %, 20. 3 %, 16. 73 %, and 13. 9 % for wheat, tef, sorghum, others and all cereals respectively. In addition the research finds that most markets around Mekelle are integrated and the total gross marketing margin is computed to be 8. 7 % and 9 % for wheat and barley, respectively. This shows that the farmers’ share is high that is 91. 3 % for wheat and 91 % for barley and even it is more than that if it is calculated taking the farmer retailers’ price that is about 93. 37 % and 93 % for wheat and barley, respectively. The identified <b>cereal</b> <b>market</b> problems are: infrastructure problem followed by price related problems, supply problems, lack of proper contract agreement and enforcements and lack of real and timely information, and demand shortage. The recommendations given are: Expand and strengthen the already started market information system of the region, that is, weakly dissemination of price information through the local radio and notice board and the biweekly publishing magazine of market information. Increase the knowledge of farmers and traders through adult education programs and extension services especially that of marketing related extension services. Cooperatives together with government participation in the market can be solutions to the long marketing chain, market failure, to eliminate mal practices, to add value, to reduce costs, to increase satisfaction and generally to improve the market and marketing systems. Financial constraint is still problem of farmers, so needs to strength the saving and credit cooperatives to handle the problem, which will have dual advantage that is solving the capital shortage and reduce food insecurity. Therefore, cooperatives should be given enough technical and financial support...|$|R

As baby boomers aged and consumers showed an increasing interest in nutritious alternatives to the heavily sweetened, child-oriented cereals that had driven growth for two decades, the breakfast <b>cereal</b> <b>market</b> became more complex and segmented. To maintain its lead in the industry, the Kellogg Company had to respond to the gap in the adult <b>cereal</b> <b>market.</b> It positioned Frosted Mini-Wheats as a product with broad-based appeal. The campaign was aimed at adults whose maturity made them concerned about nutrition but whose taste buds still craved flavor. Considered by critics to be a clever and appealing approach, the strategy was quite successful, and led to Frosted Mini-Wheats becoming one of the best-selling cereals in the United States.|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT- Cereals {{present a}} special {{importance}} in the world economy, because of their many usages: food for humans and animals, basic material for different processing industries, where final products necessary for humans are obtained (foods, drinks, starch, pastry, pharmaceutical products, etc). Cereals are cultivated all over the continents and their consumption is increasing, especially in poor countries, where they represent 60 - 75 % (rice) from the structure of rations. With time, the global <b>cereal</b> <b>market</b> has increased significantly and the prospects have shown that in 2015, {{as compared with the}} year 1996, the world cereal trade will increase by 18 % (19 million tons), while the stocks will diminish, resulting in a pressure on the cereal price.
