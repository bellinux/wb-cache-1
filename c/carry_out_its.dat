While this constitutes only 0.000165% of the human genome's approximately 6 billion bases (3 billion base pairs), unrepaired lesions in critical genes (such as tumor suppressor genes) can impede a cell's ability to <b>carry</b> <b>out</b> <b>its</b> function and appreciably increase the likelihood of tumor formation and contribute to tumour heterogeneity.|$|E
5|$|Germany invaded Poland in {{the early}} morning of 1 September 1939. The British Cabinet met late that morning and issued a warning to Germany that unless it withdrew from Polish {{territory}} Britain would <b>carry</b> <b>out</b> <b>its</b> obligations to Poland. When the House of Commons met at 6:00pm, Chamberlain and Labour deputy leader Arthur Greenwood (deputising for the sick Clement Attlee) entered the chamber to loud cheers. Chamberlain spoke emotionally, laying the blame for the conflict on Hitler.|$|E
5|$|Suffren was a wooden-hulled, armored frigate of the , {{built for}} the French Navy {{in the mid to}} late 1860s.

Suffren was one of the French ships assigned to the international squadron gathered to force the Ottoman Empire to <b>carry</b> <b>out</b> <b>its</b> obligations under the Treaty of Berlin in 1880. The ship was paid off in 1895 and discarded two years later.|$|E

5|$|The {{partitioning}} powers (in particular, Russia) {{demanded that}} the Sejm pass further reforms, {{with the intent of}} strengthening their power over the Commonwealth. The original commission was allowed to work till January 1774, extending the Sejm, which was adjourned again. The commission was unable to <b>carry</b> <b>out</b> <b>its</b> changes in that period, and thus it was allowed to extend its deliberations once more; there were ultimately seven such extensions.|$|E
5|$|In {{keeping with}} their history, the Churches of Christ claim the New Testament as their sole rule {{of faith and}} {{practice}} in deciding matters of doctrine and ecclesiastical structure.

They believe that the New Testament demonstrates how a person may become a Christian (and thus a part of the universal Church of Christ) and how a church should be collectively organized and <b>carry</b> <b>out</b> <b>its</b> scriptural purposes.|$|E

5|$|During {{the night}} from December 5 to December 6, Petras Vileišis printed 36,000 {{copies of the}} {{resolution}} for distribution. After the assembly, notorious for its loud, lengthy and intense debates, the delegates returned to their communities and started to <b>carry</b> <b>out</b> <b>its</b> resolutions. The old Russian administrations were replaced in 125 out of the 280 volosts (82 in Kaunas, 33 in Suvalkai, and 10 in Vilnius Governorates). These communities elected their own representatives, organized their own schools where classes were taught in the Lithuanian language, and stopped paying taxes. While the first Russian responses were disorganized and confused, the authorities soon marshaled their armed forces and returned the situation back to normal. The process was relatively peaceful; {{there were only a}} few clashes between armed groups of peasants and Tsarist military forces. Unlike in neighboring Latvia or Estonia, peasants did not rise against their landlords. A number of the most prominent activists of this movement were arrested and sent to Siberia.|$|E
5|$|An {{article in}} The Times on 17 February 1919 by Rudyard Kipling carried the Commission's {{proposal}} {{to a wider}} audience and described what the graves would look like. The article entitled War Graves: Work of Imperial Commission: Mr. Kipling's Survey was quickly republished as an illustrated booklet, Graves of the Fallen. The illustrated booklet was intended to soften the impact of Kenyon's report as it included illustrations of cemeteries with mature trees and shrubs; contrasting the bleak landscapes depicted in published battlefield photos. There was an immediate public outcry following {{the publication of the}} reports, particularly with regards to the decision to not repatriate the bodies of the dead. The reports generated considerable discussion in the press which ultimately led to a heated debate in Parliament on 4 May 1920. Sir James Remnant started the debate, followed by speeches by William Burdett-Coutts in favour of the Commission's principles and Robert Cecil speaking for those desiring repatriation and opposing uniformity of grave markers. Winston Churchill closed the debate and asked that the issue not proceed to a vote. Remnant withdrew his motion, allowing the Commission to <b>carry</b> <b>out</b> <b>its</b> work assured of support for its principles.|$|E
5|$|To prepare aircrew {{for their}} {{rotation}} through No.2 Squadron in Vietnam, No.1OCU {{students participated in}} exercises such as Combat Skyspot in August 1968, which utilised radar controlled by No.30 Squadron, and Strait Kris in September–October 1969, {{in conjunction with the}} Australian Army. The unit lost two more aircrew when a Canberra M.21 on a training flight crashed near Amberley on 23March 1970. From 21March to 25April 1971, four of the unit's aircraft flew 10,000 miles around Australia to conduct seven flying displays as part of the RAAF's Golden Jubilee celebrations. Having completed thirty-six conversion courses in its twelve years of operation, No.1OCU was disbanded on 9June 1971, following the withdrawal of No.2 Squadron from Vietnam. Unit staff were transferred to No.2 Squadron, which continued to operate the Canberra and <b>carry</b> <b>out</b> <b>its</b> own operational conversion until disbanding in June 1982. Ten of No.1 OCU's fifteen Canberras were put into storage and the remainder, including surviving Mk.21 trainers, were taken on by No.2 Squadron. When the F-111C eventually entered service with No.82 Wing in 1973, No.6 Squadron again took responsibility for conversion training, while No.1 Squadron acted as the lead strike unit. Canberra A84-236, which was allocated to No.1OCU in 1968 and 1970 when not in service with No.2 Squadron in Vietnam, went on display at RAAF Museum, Point Cook, Victoria, in 1982.|$|E
