2500|$|Buñuel's {{films were}} {{famous for their}} surreal imagery, [...] {{including}} scenes in which chickens populate nightmares, women grow beards, and aspiring saints are desired by lascivious women. Even in the many movies he made for hire (rather than for his own creative reasons), such as Susana and The Great Madcap, he usually added his trademark of disturbing and surreal images. [...] Some critics {{have pointed out that}} one reason why Buñuel found working in Mexico so congenial was that what might seem unusual or even outlandish in Europe or the United States fit comfortably with elements of Mexican culture and the audience's expectations of national melodrama. [...] As filmmaker Tomás Pérez Turrent has commented, when referring to the apparently incredible features that many critics find in Buñuel's films: [...] "In Mexico, it's believable", while {{one of the founders of}} Surrealism, André Breton, called Mexico, [...] "the most surrealist country in the world." [...] Certainly, running through the more personal films of Buñuel's early and late years is a backbone of surrealism; [...] Buñuel's world is one in which an entire dinner party suddenly finds itself inexplicably unable to leave the room and go home, a bad dream hands a man a letter which he brings to the doctor the next day, and where the devil, if unable to tempt a saint with a pretty girl, will fly him to a disco. An example of a more Dada influence can be found in Cet obscur objet du désir, when Mathieu <b>closes</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>and</b> has his valet spin him around and direct him to a map on the wall.|$|E
60|$|He {{stares at}} his daughter, stares all around him, <b>closes</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes,</b> <b>and</b> lies slumbering on her arm.|$|E
60|$|Now {{the back}} of the tent drops into place, and all is {{darkness}} again--whatever it is is inside the tent with him. He hears it creeping close to him--now it is beside him. He <b>closes</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>and</b> waits for the mighty paw. Upon his upturned face falls the gentle touch of a soft hand groping in the dark, and then a girl's voice in a scarcely audible whisper pronounces his name.|$|E
60|$|Adrian, {{overcome}} by the fearful crash, <b>closed</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>and</b> sighed.|$|R
60|$|Tom <b>closed</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes,</b> <b>and</b> shuddered at the dark, atheistic words.|$|R
60|$|Then Percy Cuthfert <b>closed</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>and</b> {{dropped off}} to sleep.|$|R
60|$|The {{ponderous}} {{woman looked}} through the pattern of falling words at the flowers standing cool, firm, and upright in the earth, with a curious expression. She saw them as a sleeper waking from a heavy sleep sees a brass candlestick reflecting the light in an unfamiliar way, and <b>closes</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>and</b> opens them, and seeing the brass candlestick again, finally starts broad awake {{and stares at the}} candlestick with all his powers. So the heavy woman came to a standstill opposite the oval-shaped flower bed, and ceased even to pretend to listen to what the other woman was saying. She stood there letting the words fall over her, swaying the top part of her body slowly backwards and forwards, looking at the flowers. Then she suggested that they should find a seat and have their tea.|$|E
60|$|LOUIS. That was old Walpole, I know. Don't grieve, Walpole. I'm {{perfectly}} happy. I'm not in pain. I don't want to live. Ive {{escaped from}} myself. I'm in heaven, immortal {{in the heart}} of my beautiful Jennifer. I'm not afraid, and not ashamed. [Reflectively, puzzling it out for himself weakly] I know that in an accidental sort of way, struggling through the unreal part of life, I havnt always been able to live up to my ideal. But in my own real world I have never done anything wrong, never denied my faith, never been untrue to myself. Ive been threatened and blackmailed and insulted and starved. But Ive played the game. Ive fought the good fight. And now it's all over, theres an indescribable peace. [He feebly folds his hands and utters his creed] I believe in Michael Angelo, Velasquez, and Rembrandt; in the might of design, the mystery of color, the redemption of all things by Beauty everlasting, and the message of Art that has made these hands blessed. Amen. Amen. [He <b>closes</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>and</b> lies still].|$|E
50|$|The {{stranger}} hops on a boat, that’s {{being driven}} by the projectionist. The boat is just roaming inside a lake. However the Stranger <b>closes</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>and</b> tells the boatman to take him somewhere far away.|$|E
60|$|Then, hearing Markey {{open the}} door, he <b>closed</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>and</b> feigned sleep.|$|R
60|$|He <b>closed</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes,</b> <b>and</b> {{with a smile}} he fell asleep. Uncle Tom too was free.|$|R
60|$|The detective <b>closed</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes,</b> <b>and</b> smiled <b>his</b> quiet smile again. He opened <b>his</b> <b>eyes,</b> <b>and</b> fixed them on Mrs. Pett.|$|R
5000|$|Bugs {{suggests}} {{a game of}} Russian Roulette and hands Sam a gun. Sam agrees, points the gun at his head, <b>closes</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>and</b> pulls the trigger, and gets the click of an empty barrel. He then hands the gun to Bugs, who points the gun to his head, <b>closes</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes,</b> <b>and</b> pulls the trigger as the [...] "camera" [...] irises into black {{in the center of}} the screen to the sound of a gunshot. An iris opens up on Bugs to the left, showing that he had actually ducked immediately before he fired and now holds a smoking gun as he proclaims, [...] "I missed!" [...] The right side of the screen irises open to reveal a scorched, hatless Sam shot in the head by Bugs' wayward blast, and Sam grumbles: [...] "I hate that rabbit!" ...|$|E
50|$|Alex's father dies unexpectedly, but {{not before}} he tells Alex that he should always believe. Consequently, Alex decides to visit every Tiger home game.

Thanks to Young's rejuvenated play, the Tigers start winning again.|$|E
5000|$|Hyrum Osmond, {{one of the}} film's supervising animators, later {{revealed}} that during the [...] "Love Is an Open Door" [...] musical sequence, a brief moment where Hans, belting out a high note under a waterfall, <b>closes</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>and</b> raises his arm, was a parody of a signature move by Donny Osmond, of whom Hyrum is a nephew.|$|E
60|$|He <b>closed</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes,</b> <b>and</b> {{the boys}} {{thought he was}} going to faint. Chet got some more coffee.|$|R
60|$|He <b>closed</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>and</b> swooned again, as {{the doctor}} stooped to remove the {{temporary}} bandages from his wound.|$|R
60|$|Another spear {{and then}} another touched him. He <b>closed</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>and</b> held <b>his</b> teeth firm set--he would not cry out.|$|R
50|$|Frank forces Bishop to handcuff {{himself to}} a chair. As Frank heads to the subway, Bishop uses a hidden gun to free himself. Bishop corners Frank in a subway car.

As police officers surround the car, Frank <b>closes</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>and</b> goes limp.|$|E
5000|$|Sadly, {{this new}} power {{comes at a}} cost. A disembodied, {{floating}} head (played by Antonio Francis), storms into the performance in a jealous rage, and lasers the boys {{and some of the}} audience members, including the actual Hot Chip members. The rest of audience runs away, screaming wildly. When the stadium is empty, Francis destroys a [...] "Hot Chip" [...] sign, <b>closes</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>and</b> laughs evilly, thus ending the video.|$|E
5000|$|Back in Rome Niccolò {{sits on his}} windowsill {{looking up}} at the sun through a pair of sunglasses. He <b>closes</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>and</b> imagines a science fiction film about a {{spaceship}} moving toward the sun. He recalls telling his nephew about space travel, saying, [...] "The day mankind understands what the sun is made of and its power, perhaps we'll understand the entire universe and the reasons behind so many things." [...] His nephew responds, [...] "And then?" ...|$|E
60|$|Comforting {{himself with}} this assurance, Mr Mantalini <b>closed</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>and</b> waited patiently till {{such time as}} he should wake up.|$|R

60|$|He {{inclined}} <b>his</b> head, <b>closed</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes,</b> <b>and,</b> licking <b>his</b> lips profusely, {{began to}} speak with the voice of the hotel keeper.|$|R
50|$|Fletcher {{finishes}} {{this act}} in a parking lot. Finding that his key will not work in his car door, he looks around and finds that his actual car (parked only two spots away) is an exact match for the one {{he is trying to}} get into.

Fletcher follows his doppelganger home, <b>closes</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes,</b> <b>and</b> becomes this mystery man.|$|E
5000|$|Albin returns but realises Ida is (un)dead too. Albin barely {{manages to}} fight back out of grief but finally kills Ida by {{dropping}} a heavy shelf on her. Albin cries for his girlfriend and his friends, but suddenly there is movement beneath the floorboards. The Vættr herself ascends from the basement and inspects the devastation. However, Albin <b>closes</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>and</b> turns off the lights, rendering the ancient and fragile creature powerless. Albin drops the fridge on the Vættr, crushing it. Albin then leaves the cabin, now having become the [...] "new Gunnar".|$|E
5000|$|The {{ministry}} recipient <b>closes</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>and</b> {{concentrates on}} feeling the emotional pain {{from which he}} is seeking relief. The purpose of focusing on the emotion is to allow his mind to drift back to a related memory. That memory is of a situation that the recipient regards as painful and which he has interpreted to form a belief about himself or his situation. [...] The event that is contained in the memory may have occurred many years ago, for example in the person’s childhood. The emotion provides a bridge to the belief.|$|E

50|$|At Peter Pan's camp, {{one of the}} Lost Boys, Devin, {{starts to}} bully Henry, {{prompting}} Henry to defend himself with a stick. Pan suggests that they use real swords. He tells Henry that Neverland runs on imagination and belief and so if he <b>closes</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>and</b> believes he’s holding a real sword, the stick will indeed become one. When it does, Pan is impressed. Henry uses the sword to cut his opponent's stick and slashes him across the face. He quickly apologizes for giving him the scar, but Pan and the other Lost Boys cheer Henry on.|$|E
5000|$|A key poem is [...] "Vocación". Its first stanza {{is almost}} a {{paraphrase}} of Guillén’s view of poetry as a contemplation of something in the world - saying the right words brings reality alive. The central stanza shows that Salinas questions this approach, which seems to give the poet no role beyond that of a mere spectator. In the final stanza, he gives his own conception of poetry, in which he <b>closes</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>and</b> sees how blurry and incomplete the observed world is until a poet comes along to supply what is lacking to make it something perfect.|$|E
60|$|Here the {{conversation}} lapsed, for Barwell Dawson was still weak. He lay back <b>and</b> <b>closed</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes,</b> <b>and</b> the boys did not disturb him.|$|R
60|$|He {{lay down}} again, pulled {{the edge of}} the robe around his neck and over <b>his</b> ear-flaps, <b>closed</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes,</b> <b>and</b> this time fell asleep.|$|R
60|$|Dick <b>closed</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes,</b> <b>and</b> Andrew saw <b>his</b> fears {{reflected}} in Whitney's look. Dick's face was chalky-white and haggard, and they noted his labored breathing.|$|R
