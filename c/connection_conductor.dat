40|$|Transition {{properties}} of a vertical conductor connecting two semi-infinite microstrip lines at different planes are analyzed by using dynamic solution techniques. This fundamental geometry is encountered in many microwave interconnect and packaging applications, {{and in particular}} when three-dimensional multilayer metallization techniques are employed. In order to compute the reflection and transmission {{properties of}} this three-dimensional discontinuity, a method of moments technique is employed. To this end, the Green's function of the multilayer shielded microstrip geometry is used. The surface current density distributions on the two semi-infinite microstrip lines are {{described in terms of}} the incident, reflected, and transmitted guided fundamental mode wave distributions plus a summation of current pulses in the region of discontinuity. The current on the vertical cylindrical connection line is also described in terms of a superposition of triangular shaped pulses. Application of the boundary conditions on the three conductors leads to a simultaneous linear system of equations by using a method of moments technique. Reflection and transmission coefficients are computed for several connection lines, and numerical results are presented. It is shown that a rather small <b>connection</b> <b>conductor</b> height can induce large reflection phenomena for an incident wave...|$|E

50|$|The <b>connection</b> between <b>conductor</b> Serge Koussevitzsky’s {{foundation}} and the Boston Symphony Orchestra {{led to the}} presumption that he and that orchestra would give the premiere, but Kurt Frederick, conductor of the Albuquerque Civic Symphony Orchestra, had heard about A Survivor from Warsaw and wrote to Schoenberg to ask permission to do the honors, and Schoenberg agreed, stipulating that in lieu of their performance fee the New Mexico musicians should prepare {{a full set of}} choral and orchestral parts and send those to him. The premiere was at first scheduled for Sept. 7, 1948, but was delayed until Nov. 4 of that year. Frederick conducted his orchestra at the University of New Mexico in Albuquerque with Sherman Smith as narrator.

2500|$|In 1985, Fleischmann {{turned to}} André Previn with {{the hopes that}} his {{conducting}} credentials and time spent at Hollywood Studios would add a local flair and enhance the <b>connection</b> between <b>conductor,</b> orchestra, and city. While Previn's tenure was musically satisfactory, other conductors including Kurt Sanderling, Simon Rattle, and Esa-Pekka Salonen, fared better at the box office. Previn clashed frequently with Fleischmann; one such conflict occurred over Fleischmann's failure to consult Previn over the decision to name Salonen as [...] "Principal Guest Conductor", a move mirroring the prior Solti/Mehta controversy. Because of Previn's objections, the position and Japan tour offer made to Salonen were withdrawn; however, shortly thereafter in April 1989, Previn resigned, and four months later, Salonen was named Music Director Designate, officially taking the post in October 1992. Salonen's U.S. conducting debut with the orchestra had been in 1984.|$|R
50|$|Tinsel wire is {{commonly}} connected to equipment with crimped terminal lugs that pierce the insulation {{to make contact}} with the metal ribbons, rather than stripping insulation. Separated from the core, the individual ribbons are relatively fragile, and the core can be damaged by high temperatures. These factors make it difficult or impractical to terminate tinsel wire by soldering during equipment manufacture, although soldering is possible, with some difficulty, to repair a failed <b>connection.</b> However, the <b>conductors</b> tend to break at their junction with the rigid solder.|$|R
40|$|Electric and {{magnetic}} fields produced by transmission systems have received strong interest both for biological effects and for interference with electrical and electronic devices, measuring sets, computers, control systems, etc. A deeper {{attention has been}} more recently devoted to magnetic fields which are difficult to screen and which can be significant when produced by transmission, but also by distribution and utilization systems. This paper proposes a simplified approach {{which seems to be}} useful in the case of lines set up by cables and, in particular, when more cables are connected in parallel, considering currents affected by significant harmonics content. Complete simulation results for several selected cases to analyze the electromagnetic field under quasi-stationary conditions in a multiconductor system are reported and discussed in detail, and the main results are summarized.

40|$|Theoretical {{analysis}} and some experiments {{have demonstrated that}} siliconon- insulator (SOI) 4 -gate transistors the type known as G(exp 4) FETs could be efficiently used for in-plane crossing of signal paths. Much of the effort of designing very-large-scale integrated (VLSI) circuits is focused on area-efficient routing of signals. The main source of difficulty in VLSI signal routing is the requirement to prevent crossing, in the same plane, of wires that {{are meant to be}} kept electrically insulated from each other. Consequently, it often becomes necessary to design and build VLSI circuits in multiple layers with vias (<b>connections</b> between <b>conductors</b> in different layers at selected locations). Suitable devices that would prevent, or at least sufficiently suppress, undesired electrical coupling (cross-talk) between wires crossing in the same plane would enable compact, simpler implementation complex interconnection networks with in-plane crossings that, heretofore, have not been possible in VLSI circuitry. The use of G 4 FETs as in-plane signal-crossing devices or routers, in combination with the use of G(exp 4) FETs as universal programmable logic gates, would create opportunities for reducing complexity in VLSI design...|$|R

50|$|Solder mask or solder stop mask or {{solder resist}} {{is a thin}} lacquer-like layer of polymer that is usually applied to the copper traces of {{a printed circuit board}} (PCB) for {{protection}} against oxidation and to prevent solder bridges from forming between closely spaced solder pads. A solder bridge is an unintended electrical <b>connection</b> between two <b>conductors</b> by means of a small blob of solder. PCBs use solder masks to prevent this from happening. Solder mask is not always used for hand soldered assemblies, but is essential for mass-produced boards that are soldered automatically using reflow or solder bath techniques. Once applied, openings must be made in the solder mask wherever components are soldered, which is accomplished using photolithography. Solder mask is traditionally green but is now available in many colors.|$|R
50|$|Cables {{usually are}} secured with special {{fittings}} where they enter electrical apparatus; {{this may be}} a simple screw clamp for jacketed cables in a dry location, or a polymer-gasketed cable connector that mechanically engages the armour of an armoured cable and provides a water-resistant connection. Special cable fittings may be applied to prevent explosive gases from flowing in the interior of jacketed cables, where the cable passes through areas where flammable gases are present. To prevent loosening of the <b>connections</b> of individual <b>conductors</b> of a cable, cables must be supported near their entrance to devices and at regular intervals along their runs. In tall buildings, special designs are required to support the conductors of vertical runs of cable. Generally, only one cable per fitting is permitted, unless the fitting is rated or listed for multiple cables.|$|R
40|$|The {{regulations}} for construction {{in many countries}} impose the <b>connection</b> of lightning <b>conductors</b> to concrete rebars. In the present work {{the effect of this}} connection on the corrosion of rebars was studied in order to avoid connections that accelerate corrosion. In some cases artificial lightning and radioactive lightning conductors were used. It was found that these connections influence the corrosion rate. It depends on the electrical characteristics of the atmosphere that is, on the season and the weather. In most cases the corrosion is accelerated. In some cases the electron flow is inversed, and protection is found. The overall phenomenon for the whole year is an acceleration of the corrosion from 35 to 70 %. The artificial lightning and the use of radioactive lightning conductors also accelerate the corrosion. It follows that the grounding of lightning conductors must be separately made with a network to divide the charge of lightning and should not be connected to the rebars...|$|R

40|$|Packaging made {{primarily}} of aluminum nitride {{has been developed}} to enclose silicon carbide-based integrated circuits (ICs), including circuits containing SiC-based power diodes, {{that are capable of}} operation under conditions more severe than can be withstood by silicon-based integrated circuits. A major objective of this development was to enable packaged SiC electronic circuits to operate continuously at temperatures up to 500 C. AlN-packaged SiC electronic circuits have commercial potential for incorporation into high-power electronic equipment and into sensors that must withstand high temperatures and/or high pressures in diverse applications that include exploration in outer space, well logging, and monitoring of nuclear power systems.

One or more SiC-based circuit chips are mounted on an aluminum nitride package substrate or sandwiched between two such substrates. Intimate electrical <b>connections</b> between metal <b>conductors</b> on the chip(s) and the metal conductors on external circuits are made by direct bonding to interconnections on the package substrate(s) and/or by use of holes through the package substrate(s).

Moreover, the elimination of wire bonds makes it possible to pack chips more densely than was previously possible...|$|R
40|$|Due to {{increasing}} weight of electrical component and wiring harnesses {{in a vehicle}} contrary to the demand of light constructed vehicles {{as well as the}} constantly increasing and fluctuating price of copper compared to aluminium’s stable and far lower price, the use of aluminium conductors as an alternative have been promoted.   This thesis work lay theoretical research of the available methods used for electrical <b>connection</b> of aluminium <b>conductors</b> in order to increase the knowledge about the available termination techniques.   Due to aluminium’s characteristics such as lower conductivity and strength, tendency to form oxides and relax over time, differences in thermal expansion coefficient and high potential for galvanic corrosion, there is a risk of deterioration and degradation of the connection if the termination of aluminium conductors is not done correctly without being aware of the challenges when it comes to aluminium connection.   The founded solutions are different welding and soldering techniques such as friction welding, ultrasonic welding, resistance welding, plasma soldering and many other modifications of conventional crimp.   A robust termination system that faces all those challenges and ensure a reliable connection during the entire life length of the vehicle and in order to inhibit corrosion different type of sealing of the contact interface will be required.   In order to evaluate the performance of the founded connection method, testing with evaluation of, tensile strength of conductor to contact attachment, tightness demand, corrosion resistance, vibration and heat evolution at the contact attachment have to be conducted...|$|R

These networks include moving loads, different catenary types, and some <b>connections</b> between line <b>conductors</b> may exist, implying a specific research on line models. The results presented were obtained with a new simulation tool which was specifically build for railway networks design. This development was lead in parallel by CEGELY and SEMALY. This tool is composed of three modules: - Mechanical calculations. Speed, position and mechanical power vs. time are calculated, - Electrical calculations. Single or dual AT-feeding systems can be simulated. Contact wire to rail and rail to earth potential and currents in each conductor and at the pantograph of a train are calculated. Some other data such as power factor at the substation are also available. - Thermal calculations. The temperature of the contact wire is calculated. The work presented here deals with the electrical aspect and {{is divided into two}} parts. In the first part, three different line models are compared. The goal of this part is to quantify the error made on the calculated currents and voltages using one of the three models (Carson, Dubanton, Escane). In the second part, the influence of different parameters is studied in order to quantify the results sensitivity to input data variations. Parameters such as earth resistivity, rail to earth impedance value (along the line or at the substation) and rail to earth conductance are studied. These studies were made on the 1 x 25 KV single power supply system. A special attention is given to the rail to earth potential calculation, which must not exceed 50 Volts.

40|$|In {{electrical}} engineering terminal connectors {{are commonly used}} for connecting and releasing electrical conductors. They are sophisticated mass products sufficient for high- and low power transmission or transmitting information. There are various applications for wiring in cars, control- or house installations and electrical power supply systems. Depending on the electrical current to be transmitted and consequently the wire diameter there are several approaches to realize a durable and safe mechanical <b>connection</b> between the <b>conductors.</b> The electrical contact resistance of such systems {{is defined by the}} constriction- and the film resistance. The constriction resistance heavily depends on the contact or load force. If the connection becomes loose, this force decreases or even disappears, which results in an extensive raise of the temperature in the contact area. The current density is locally increasing on certain connection points. The raised temperature may lead to unwanted operational states or even fire. There are a few mechanical solutions to realize a constant or re-adjusting contact force. However, these approaches are mechanically complex and hence cost intensive. In this paper we present the development and experimental investigation of a self-adjusting terminal connector based on shape-memory alloys (SMA) which is far less complex than currently known mechanical solutions. The compensation of the decreasing contact force is realized by a precompressed SMA cylinder, which is located in a drill hole {{at the bottom of the}} terminal connector’s screw. Under normal conditions the terminal works similar to a conventional screw connector. In case of decreasing contact forces, the increasing contact resistance results in a rising temperature. As soon as the austenite start temperature is reached the SMA cylinder starts to expand and resets the contact force. As a result the system cools down and the SMA cylinder keeps a desired contact force. In this paper we present the general design of such a system and ist limitations. Measurement data of the SMA cylinder and the active terminal connector will further show the proof of the concept...|$|R
40|$|A {{new type}} of a {{demountable}} and gas-permeable high voltage insulation was developed for the cable-in-conduit <b>conductor</b> <b>connections</b> of the superconducting Wendelstein 7 -X (W 7 -X) magnet system. These connections are situated within the cryovacuum space of the machine. Normal operation voltages are very low {{so that they do}} not need to be considered separately with respect to electrical insulation. On the other hand, in case of an emergency switch off the maximal voltage between two conductor joints might reach around 3 kV. Again, the normal operation cryovacuum is by far sufficient as an electrical insulator for this voltage too. However, in case of a vacuum failure which might occur simultaneously with or might even trigger a fast coil discharge, the gas pressure could reach the conditions of the 'Paschen minimum' which is characterized by a low breakdown voltage. In the worst case the leak woulder occur for instance between the cryovacuum space and the helium system leading to the minimal helium breakdown voltage of #approx# 160 V even for large electrode distances. The gas-permeable high voltage insulation was tested with regard to dc voltage strength and to gas flow for He below atmospheric pressure. Experiments were performed around the Paschen minimum region at ambient as well as LN_ 2 temperatures. The results show that this type of insulation has sufficient strength for the specified test voltage of 12 kV under all vacuum conditions. The gas flow investigations proved that the flow resistance and the ability to hold helium will hinder neither the pumping of the W 7 -X cryostat nor the leak tests. This work shows the principal applicability of the proposed insulation system. Further investigations would be needed for better physical understanding and for optimization. However, the development is so far advanced that one could start to build an insulation prototype for W 7 -X. A patent application was filed for this gas-permeable and dismountable high voltage insulation which is suitable also for other large superconducting magnets with cable-in-conduit conductors. (orig.)

40|$|The {{main goal}} of the project is to implement, test, and compare a new control scheme for DC-DC {{converters}} such as: boost or buck-boost. The control scheme is designed to optimally handle a load change. A load change in the converter will cause a transient response which includes a rise/fall in the output voltage and inductor current. The transient response may have many implications on the load. The implications may include shut down, overheating and more. The proposed control scheme will offer a solution to these problems. There are two conventional methods for dealing with transients. The “Peak current mode ” method is a linear method. This method is limited by band width. Transient response to load change includes fast changes to the voltage and current and therefore this method is more suitable for steady state rather than transient. The “Time optimal” method is a non-linear control method designed to minimize the overall transient time. In converters that have a direct <b>connection</b> between the <b>conductor</b> and the input and output voltages, minimal response time results in minimal deviation. These converters are called “Direct energy transfer”. But, in “Indirect energy transfer ” converter’s minimal response time will not result in minimal deviation. The proposed control scheme is called “minimal deviation”. The method combines linear and non-linear control methods. By combining {{the properties of the}} two methods we have received a scheme capable of returning to steady state quickly and with minimal deviation. Using these advantages we can lower costs and the area of the converter. During this project an implementation of the "minimal deviation " control scheme was made. The converter chosen was of the type "Buck-Boost", and implemented on a printed circuit board. The control scheme was designed and implemented on a FPGA platform. The control scheme is to be empirically tested and the empirical results will be compared with the theoretical results of the simulations. Furthermore, the empirical test results will be compared with empirical test results of the current commonly used control schemes.
