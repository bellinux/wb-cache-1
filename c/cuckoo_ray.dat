40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results on nine {{of the most important}} elasmobranch fish species of the nine years (2001 - 2009) of the Porcupine bank Spanish surveys. The main species in biomass terms in Porcupine bank bottom trawl survey, in decreasing biomass abundance order, are: blackmouth catshark, birdbeak dogfish, velvet belly, Knifetooth dogfish, lesser spotted dogfish, bluntnose sixgill shark, sandy ray, <b>cuckoo</b> <b>ray</b> and common skate. Many of these species occupy mainly the deep areas covered in the survey, especially birdbeak dogfish, knifetooth dogfish and velvet belly. Less confined to deeper grounds are blackmouth catshark and sandy ray, while lesser spotted dogfish and <b>cuckoo</b> <b>ray</b> inhabit mainly the shallower grounds close to the Irish shelf or the central mound in the bank. Length distributions of these species along the survey series are also presented and discussed. The few available data on siki sharks from the Porcupine bank survey are also summarized.

40|$|The {{present study}} {{is the first to}} provide data on the {{reproductive}} biology of <b>cuckoo</b> <b>ray</b> Leucoraja naevus in Portuguese continental waters. No difference in size at maturity was detected between sexes, which was estimated as 56 cm total length. Spawning occurs all year round, but maximum activity was during winter months. Maximum fecundity is c. 63 eggs female- 1 year- 1. Encapsulated eggs are released in batches, nine in total with a mean number of seven extruded eggs in each batch...|$|E
40|$|Skates and rays {{represent}} one of {{the most}} vulnerable components of fish communities in temperate demersal fisheries such as the Irish Sea. They also tend to be data poor in comparison to commercially exploited teleost fish. Spatial management has been suggested as an important tool to protect these species, but requires an understanding of the abundance distribution, and the relationship the abundance distribution has with the environment at both adult and juvenile life history stages. Here we modelled bottom trawl survey data using delta log-normal boosted regression trees on to derive rays’ spatial abundance, and environmental links. The modelling approach allowed the development of high resolution predictive maps of abundance of four skate and ray species targeted by fishing activity: thornback, spotted, <b>cuckoo</b> and blonde <b>rays.</b> The distributions of these species were driven by a general preference for sand and coarser substrates as well as higher salinities, temperatures and currents speeds. Spatial comparisons between abundance distributions and locations of skate and ray commercial landings indicated that the main hotspots for the investigated species are outside of the main commercial fishing areas and overlap with potential MPAs proposed for wider ecosystem protection. The method offers a useful tool for selecting potential MPA’s to assist the management and conservation of data-poor species...|$|R

40|$|Fisheries for {{the most}} common elasmobranch species landed in the Cantabrian Sea (ICES Division VIIIc) are reviewed. Special {{attention}} is given to small-spotted catshark (Scyliorhinus canicula) and the following Rajidae thornback ray (Raja clavata), spotted ray, (R. montagui) and <b>cuckoo</b> <b>ray</b> (Leucoraja naevus), representing more than the 90 % of ray landings. A market sampling program {{was carried out in}} 2001 to improve the knowledge of species that are frequently landed as a mixed species assemblage, occasionally gutted, {{or in the case of}} rays, "wings " (pectoral fins retained). Commercial length distributions by gear, area and quarter are presented as well. Thirty-five percent of the catches in the trawl fishery are discarded. The estimated annual average of dogfish catch is about 1 500 tons, 80 % of which is discarded. In the case of ray species, the estimated annual catch is 600 tons, ~ 30 % being discarded...|$|E
40|$|Over 50 {{species of}} chondrichthyan fishes are known from waters around the British Isles, of which 26 have been {{recorded}} in The Centre for Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture Science (CEFAS) trawl surveys. The distribution and relative abundance of dogfishes, skates and rays are described from groundfish surveys in the North Sea, English Channel, Irish Sea and Celtic Sea. The contemporary distribution of species {{in relation to their}} biogeography and major changes in the distribution are discussed. Nursery areas of elasmobranchs were typically in shallower water than adult habitats, a pattern evident for blonde (Raja brachyura), thornback (R. clavata), small-eyed (R. microocellata) and spotted ray (R. montagui). In contrast, juvenile <b>cuckoo</b> <b>ray</b> Leucoraja naevus occurred further offshore and were most abundant in the western Irish Sea and northern St George’s Channel. Oviparous species require a suitable substratum for the deposition of eggs, and the distribution of egg-cases is illustrated and important egg-laying substrates identified...|$|E
40|$|This working {{document}} {{presents the results}} on the most significant elasmobranch species of the Porcupine Bank Spanish surveys in 2014 and updates the documents presented in previous years with {{the information in the}} whole historical series from 2001. The main species in biomass terms in this survey were Galeus melastomus (blackmouth catshark), Deania calcea (birdbeak dogfish), Scymnodon ringens (Knifetooth dogfish), Dipturus nidarosiensis (Norwegian skate), Scyliorhinus canicula (lesser spotted dogfish), Etmopterus spinax (velvet belly lantern shark), Hexanchus griseus (bluntnose sixgill shark), Dalatias licha (Kitefin shark), Leucoraja circularis (sandy ray), Dipturus cf. flossada, Leucoraja naevus (<b>cuckoo</b> <b>ray)</b> and Dipturus cf. intermedia (common skate). Biomass, distribution and length ranges were analysed for these species. All the species analysed increased its biomass in 2014, except S. canicula and D. cf. flossada that decreased. D. calcea individuals smaller than 65 cm were captured again in 2014 after not having been captured the previous year, although catches were very low.

40|$|Skates {{are widely}} {{consumed}} across the globe, but many large species {{are subject to}} considerable concern regarding their conservation and management. Within Europe such issues have recently driven policy changes so that, for the first time, reports of skate landings now {{have to be made}} under species-specific names. Total allowable catches have also been established for many groups, which have been set to zero for a number of the most vulnerable species (e. g., Dipturus batis, Raja undulata and Rostoraja alba). Whilst accurate species identification has become an important issue for landings, the sale of skates is still usually made under a blanket term of “skate” or “ray”. The matter of identifying species of skate is further complicated by their morphologically conservative nature {{and the fact that they}} are commercially valued for their wings. Thus, before sale their bodies are usually discarded (i. e., “winged”) and often skinned, making morphological identification impossible. For the first time, DNA barcoding (of the mitochondrial COI gene) was applied to samples of skate wings from retail outlets across the British Isles, providing insight into which species are sold for consumption. A total of 98 wing samples were analysed, revealing that six species were sold; blonde ray (Raja brachyura), spotted ray (Raja montagui), thornback ray (Raja clavata), <b>cuckoo</b> <b>ray</b> (Leucoraja naevus) small-eyed ray (Raja microocellata) and shagreen ray (Leucoraja fullonica). Statistical testing demonstrated that there were significant differences in the species sold in the distinct retail groups which suggests complex drivers behind the patterns of sale in skates. The results also indicate that endangered species are not commonly being passed on to consumers. In addition, the practice of selling skate wings under ambiguous labels is highlighted as it makes it extremely difficult for consumers to exercise a right to avoid species of conservation concern. Interestingly, a single retailer chain labelled their wings as originating from three smaller-growing species (generally to be considered of lower conservation concern); of the six samples analysed from this company a third were mislabelled and originated from the thornback ray (a larger species that is currently undergoing population declines) ...|$|E
40|$|Dissertação de mest., Biologia Marinha, Faculdade de Ciências e Tecnologia, Univ. do Algarve, 2010 Skate populations tend to {{be highly}} {{vulnerable}} to exploitation {{as a result of}} the main life history characteristics (slow growth, late maturity and low fecundity). The <b>cuckoo</b> <b>ray,</b> Leucoraja naevus, one of the skate species landed in Portugal, is mainly a by-catch species from the artisanal mixed-fishery, and for this reason it is very difficult to acquire information about its basic biology. The two main goals of the present work were to estimate the length at first maturity, fecundity and reproductive cycle of the species Leucoraja naevus and to compare the microscopic structure and chemical nature of the secretions produced by the oviducal gland of the species Leucoraja naevus with other skate species taking into account their reproductive strategy. Although the species has been studied in other NE Atlantic geographic areas, namely Celtic Sea, Irish Sea and North Sea, this study is the first to provide information on the reproductive biology of Leucoraja naevus in Southern European waters. Length at first maturity was estimated at 57 cm and 55 cm TL for males and females, respectively. Active females were observed in every months of the year suggesting that reproduction may occur year round, with a reproductive peak during winter months between January and April. Females release follicles in batches of 5. However, it was not possible to determine the number of reproductive episodes realized by a female during a 1 -year period. Leucoraja naevus, Raja brachyura, Raja miraletus, Raja undulata, Raja microocellata and Raja montagui, have similar microscopic structure divided in four zones: club, papillary, baffle and terminal. However, differences were found between Leucoraja naevus and the remaining species in the chemical nature of the secretions produced in the papillary zone, that seems to have a higher content of sulphated acid mucins, and in the terminal zone that, like in Raja microocellata, lacks serous gland tubules. The differences found are related with the reproductive strategy displayed by each species, namely with the capsule and spawning habitats characteristics. Sperm was found in all species as laterally aligned bundles in the deep recessed tubules of the baffle zone, adjacent to the muscle layer, suggesting short-term sperm storage. These results provide essential information on the reproductive biology not only about the species Leucoraja naevus but also about other by-catch species inhabiting Portuguese continental waters and, therefore, constitute an important tool for a proper management plan...|$|E
