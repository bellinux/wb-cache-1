A one-story structure {{was added to}} the building, increasing the number of <b>cribs</b> by eight; four of the added <b>cribs</b> opened directly onto Pleasant Alley, by that time known as Venus Alley. When copper prices went up, the more than 14,000 miners in the city experienced a pay-rise of twenty-five cents and injected an additional $6,000 into Butte's economy. The Dumas also experienced an upswing in patronage. As a result of the added patronage, the brothel added five partitions and a staircase in 1916, and the ground floor, once a grand parlor, was partitioned into <b>cribs.</b>|$|E

The partial <b>cribbing</b> scheme is especially motivated by the additive noise Gaussian MAC, where perfect <b>cribbing</b> results in the degenerated case of full cooperation between the encoders and requires an infinite entropy link. We derive a single-letter characterization of the capacity of the MAC with partial <b>cribbing</b> for the cases of causal and strictly causal <b>cribbing.</b> Several numerical examples, such as those of quantized <b>cribbing,</b> are presented. We further consider and derive the capacity region where the <b>cribbing</b> depends on actions that are functions of the previous <b>cribbed</b> observations.

When the cheval de frise was finished, they began work on the fort. Little soil covered the rocky surface, so men had to haul soil up from the low ground. They were unable to dig the customary ditches or trenches around the fort. The fort was built in the shape of a pentagon with five bastions. The main walls were made of earth, constructed with ravelins with openings for guns from every angle. The fort enclosed a total of three to four acres. The troops built an abbattis around the fort. After the barracks were finished in September, all the troops in the area were placed under the command of Major General William Heath. Washington established his headquarters near the fort.|$|E

5|$|In 1984, actress Jane Seymour {{bought the}} house with her then husband David Flynn for £350,000. After {{spending}} £3 million on refurbishments, they undertook renovation of the house. They brought purchased furniture from Littlecote House, owned by Sir Seton Wills, as he was selling his house and there was little furniture at St Catherine's. Seymour spent summers at the house. After her divorce from Flynn and marriage to American film producer James Keach, Seymour rented out the manor as a film set, recording studio and latterly country house estate/hotel for corporate events and weddings. The English band The Cure recorded their album Wild Mood Swings there in end of 1994 and 1995; they came back {{in the autumn of}} 1998 to record most of their 2000 album Bloodflowers. The rock band Radiohead recorded most of their 1997 album OK Computer there. English Rock/Electronic Band New Order also recorded part of their 2005 album Waiting for the Sirens' Call at St Catherine's Court. The property was also rented by Robbie Williams, as seen in the first episode of MTV <b>Cribs.</b> In May 2007, Seymour was granted a 24-hour alcohol and entertainment licence under new UK regulations, by Bath and North East Somerset council. Neighbours complained the access lane was too narrow and the noise excessive. Seymour won the court battle, but sold the house in November 2007 to an unknown buyer. In 2009 a planning application for a two-storey extension, including a swimming pool was submitted to the local council. This was on the site of a previous orchard from which the trees were transplanted. The house is now available for catered rental and weddings.|$|E

25|$|A bombe run {{involved}} a cryptanalyst first obtaining a crib — {{a section of}} plaintext that was thought to correspond to the ciphertext. Finding <b>cribs</b> {{was not at all}} straightforward; it required considerable familiarity with German military jargon and the communication habits of the operators.

This helped in testing a possible crib against the ciphertext, as it could rule out a number of <b>cribs</b> and positions, where the same letter occurred in the same position in both the plaintext and the ciphertext. This was termed a crash at Bletchley Park.|$|E

The use of <b>cribbing</b> also allows for the use of a lifting device with a limited working range (such as a jack, lifting air bags or hydraulic rescue tools) as the load can be raised to the maximum range of the device, then lowered a short distance onto the <b>cribbing,</b> allowing another platform of <b>cribbing</b> to be built to raise the device and repeat the process.|$|R
