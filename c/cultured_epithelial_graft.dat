40|$|Cell {{therapy is}} an {{emerging}} therapeutic strategy aimed at replacing or repairing severely damaged tissues with cultured cells. Speci fi cally, ocular burns cause depletion of limbal stem cells, {{which leads to}} corneal opaci fi cation and visual loss. Corneal stem cells are segregated in the basal layer of the limbus, which is the transitional zone of the epithelium located between the cornea and the bulbar conjunctiva. Autologous cultured limbal epithelial cells can restore damaged corneas. We sought to establish a culture system that allows preservation of limbal stem cells and preparation of manageable epithelial sheets. We outline some quality criteria, which assure the clinical performance of keratinocyte culture: evaluation {{of the number of}} holoclones within a <b>cultured</b> <b>epithelial</b> <b>graft,</b> proportion of aborting colonies, and percentage of cells expressing high levels of D Np 63 a...|$|E
40|$|Aim: Limbal {{cultures}} {{restore the}} corneal epithelium {{in patients with}} ocular burns. We investigated the biological parameters instrumental for their clinical success. Methods: We report a long-term multicenter prospective study on 152 patients carrying corneal destruction due to severe ocular burns, treated with autologous limbal cells cultured on fibrin and clinical-grade 3 T 3 -J 2 feeder cells. Clinical results were statistically evaluated both by parametric and nonparametric methods. Results: Clinical outcomes were scored as full success, partial success and failure in 66. 05, 19. 14 and 14. 81 % of eyes, respectively. The total number of clonogenic cells, colony size, growth rate and presence of conjunctival cells could not predict clinical results. Instead, the clinical data provided conclusive evidence that graft quality and likelihood of a successful outcome rely on an accurate evaluation {{of the number of}} stem cells detected before transplantation as holoclones expressing high levels of the p 63 transcription factor. No adverse effects related to the feeder layer have been observed and the regenerated epithelium was completely devoid of any 3 T 3 -J 2 contamination. Conclusion: Cultures of limbal stem cells can be safely used to successfully treat massive destruction of the human cornea. We emphasize the importance of a discipline for defining the suitability and the quality of <b>cultured</b> <b>epithelial</b> <b>grafts,</b> which are relevant to the future clinical use of any cultured cell type...|$|R
40|$|The {{biologic}} {{activity of}} <b>cultured</b> <b>epithelial</b> <b>grafts</b> {{is believed to}} diminish with increasing cellular age. Therefore, keratinocytes from young donors are used preferentially {{in the production of}} cultured allografts for wound treatment. However, the impact of biologic age on cytokine gene expression by human keratinocytes has not been previously investigated. In this study, transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-β 1) gene expression in human keratinocytes derived from normal foreskins of males ranging in age from 7 months to 82 years was analyzed. Keratinocytes were harvested from fresh specimens and cultivated in vitro on 3 T 3 fibroblast feeder layers through second passage. The cells were analyzed both qualitatively and semiquantitatively for TGF-β 1 gene expression using three separate techniques: in situ hybridization, Northern hybridization, and competitive polymerase chain reaction. By in situ hybridization, the signal representing TGF-β 1 transcript was detected in cells in all layers of the stratified cultures, and immunohistochemical staining for TGF-β 1 protein was equally intense in all layers. Northern blots of total RNA extracted from the cultivated cells showed no decrease in band density with increasing biologic age. Likewise, no decrease in TGF-β 1 mRNA levels with biologic age was observed using a semiquantitative polymerase chain reaction assay. These results indicate that the potential for TGF-β 1 gene expression in cultured foreskin keratinocytes does not decline with increasing cellular age. The findings imply that the clinical performance of cultured grafts, at least {{as it relates to the}} elaboration of this growth factor, may not be significantly altered by the biologic age of the keratinocyte donor...|$|R
40|$|Sheets of <b>cultured</b> <b>epithelial</b> {{cells have}} been {{successfully}} used as autografts for the permanent coverage of patients with full-thickness burns and as allografts to stimulate the healing of chronic skin ulcers. The basement membrane zone (BMZ), composed of lamina lucida, lamina densa, and anchoring fibrils, plays {{a pivotal role in}} the firm adherence of the epidermis to the dermis. The present study describes the ultrastructural development during various stages of wound healing after resurfacing different wound areas by <b>cultured</b> <b>epithelial</b> <b>grafts.</b> For this purpose, biopsies were obtained from five patients 5 d to 4. 5 years after resurfacing full-thickness burns with cultured autografts, and from five patients at various stages after treatment of excised tattoos and chronic skin ulcers with cultured allografts. One biopsy Was taken from a spontaneously healed burn wound 30 years post-injury. Ultrathin sections were prepared for transmission and immunoelectron microscopy, using monoclonal antibodies against type IV and VII collagen. Findings were compared to controls of age- and site-matched normal skin. Eleven days after grafting, the first BMZ features had regenerated, including lamina lucida, a discontinuous lamina densa, hemidesmosomes, and sparse anchoring fibrils. The process of de novo synthesis of BMZ components had begun, and within 4 to 5 weeks complete reformation of BMZ was observed, including normal distribution of anchoring fibrils. Immunolabeling of type VII collagen was first observed upon the lower part of lamina densa at day 11 and steadily increased, reaching normal values 5 weeks after grafting. In contrast, gold deposition of type IV collagen upon lamina densa was strongly increased at day 19 compared to normal. This high expression reduced a little at 5 weeks, but remained high up to 30 years after injury. Long-term burn scars exhibited pseudopodia-like extensions of all basal cells, abundant anchoring fibrils, and an increased amount of arching anchoring fibrils. These features might compensate for the lack of proper rete ridges...|$|R

40|$|Penetration of {{intestinal}} {{epithelial cells}} {{is an important}} step in the pathogenesis of Salmonella infections. We have characterized a gene, invE, that is necessary for Salmonella invasion of <b>cultured</b> <b>epithelial</b> cells. The predicted amino acid sequence of InvE showed significant homology to the Yersinia outer membrane protein YopN (LcrE). Strains of Salmonella carrying mutations in invE were unable to penetrate Henle- 407 human intestinal cells and Madin-Darby canine kidney cells, although they were fully capable of attaching to the same cells. Unlike wild-type Salmonella typhimurium, invE mutants failed to change the intracellular free calcium levels or the distribution of polymerized actin in <b>cultured</b> <b>epithelial</b> cells; neither did they alter the normal architecture of the microvilli of polarized Madin-Darby canine kidney cells. Wild-type S. typhimurium was able to rescue the invasive phenotype of the invE mutants in simultaneous infections of <b>cultured</b> <b>epithelial</b> cells although it did not rescue the Escherichia coli strain RDEC- 1.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The author {{compares the}} outcome of therapy in {{patients}} with massive burns with or without <b>cultured</b> autologous <b>epithelial</b> autografts. SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: The use of cultured keratinocytes has been controversial because of poor take and fragility. There have been no prospective series comparing {{the use of this}} technology with standard burn wound coverage. METHODS: During a 5 -year period, 22 patients with an average burn size of 71. 8 % were treated with cultured keratinocytes and compared with a group of 42 controls with an average burn size of 61. 6 %. RESULTS: There {{was no significant difference in}} age, sex distribution, or third-degree component of the burn between the two groups. There was a significantly higher incidence of smoke inhalation in the <b>cultured</b> <b>epithelial</b> autograft group. There was a reduction in mortality in the <b>cultured</b> <b>epithelial</b> autograft group compared with controls, from 48 % to 14 % (p < 0. 007).

40|$|The Escherichia coli adhesin {{involved}} in diffuse adherence (AIDA-I) is a multifunctional autotransporter protein that mediates bacterial aggregation and biofilm formation, {{as well as}} adhesion and invasion of <b>cultured</b> <b>epithelial</b> cells. To elucidate the structure-function relationships of AIDA-I, we performed transposon-based linker scanning mutagenesis and constructed mutants with site-directed deletions. Twenty-nine different mutants with insertions that did not affect protein expression were obtained. Eleven mutants were deficient {{for one or two}} but not all of the functions associated with the expression of AIDA-I. Functional characterization of the transposon mutants and of an additional deletion mutant suggested that the N-terminal third of mature AIDA-I is {{involved in}} binding of this protein to <b>cultured</b> <b>epithelial</b> cells. The purified product of the putative domain could bind to <b>cultured</b> <b>epithelial</b> cells, confirming the importance of this region in adhesion. We also identified several different mutants in which invasion and adhesion were changed to different extents and two mutants in which autoaggregation and biofilm formation were also affected differently. These results suggest that although conceptually linked, adhesion and invasion, as well as autoaggregation and biofilm formation, are phenomena that may rely on distinct mechanisms when they are mediated by AIDA-I. This study sheds new light on the workings of a protein belonging to an emerging family of strikingly versatile virulence factors...|$|R

40|$|The radial forearm free flap {{has been}} popular {{in many areas}} of {{reconstructive}} surgery. Despite the many attributes of this flap in maxillofacial reconstruction, one of the disadvantages has been the morbidity of the donor site. Allogeneic cultured epidermis has been successfully applied on large second degree burns and on chronic leg ulcers. Autologous human keratinocytes and fibroblast equivalents can be cultured in-vitro from a small skin sample in order to produce a sufficient amount of epithelial autografts to cover the large defects of third-degree burn wounds. Interestingly, transplanted cultured epidermis retains characteristics of the original donor site. We report a case of a patient who underwent skin replacement by <b>cultured</b> <b>epithelial</b> autograft after wound breakdown occurred in the forearm donor site during the early postoperative period.

The use of different PLA 2 inhibitors revealed that P. aeruginosa-induced arachidonic acid release is mediated by activation of cytosolic PLA 2 (cPLA 2), whereas iPLA 2 or sPLA 2 {{do not seem to be}} involved in the response to P. aeruginosa. Likewise, the cPLA 2 -specific inhibitors MAFP and AACOCF 3 prevented apoptosis of <b>cultured</b> <b>epithelial</b> cells upon P. aeruginosa infection, whereas inhibitors specific for iPLA 2 or sPLA 2 were without effect. The physiological significance of these findings is indicated by an inhibition of apoptosis in tracheal epithelial cells upon in vivo infection with P. aeruginosa.

40|$|Epithelial {{cells are}} one of the {{prominent}} cell types infected by human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) within its host. However, many <b>cultured</b> <b>epithelial</b> cells, such as ARPE- 19 retinal pigmented epithelial cells, are poorly infected by laboratory-adapted strains in cell culture, and {{little is known about the}} viral factors that determine HCMV epithelial cell tropism.

Repair of the mutated UL 131 gene in the AD 169 laboratory strain of HCMV restored its ability to infect both epithelial and endothelial cells while compromising its ability to replicate in fibroblasts. ARPE- 19 epithelial cells support replication of the repaired AD 169 virus as well as clinical isolates of HCMV.

In addition to type 1 fimbriae and glycocalyces, both strains elaborate mannose-resistant nonfimbrial protein hemagglutinins specific for human erythrocytes. Purified agglutinins are aggregates (greater than 4 X 10 (6) daltons) of a single protein subunit of apparent Mr 14, 000 (469 - 3) to 14, 500 (444 - 3). The optimal temperature for expression of the agglutinins is 37 degrees C. Bacteria grown at 22 degrees C, which show 1 % or less of maximal activity, and mutants deficient {{in the ability to}} agglutinate human erythrocytes do not synthesize detectable levels of these surface proteins and, moreover, do not adhere to <b>cultured</b> <b>epithelial</b> cells. Coupled with the observation that purified agglutinins competitively inhibit bacterial adherence to cultured cells, these data indicate that the nonfimbrial surface proteins expressed by strains 444 - 3 and 469 - 3 are essential for adherence both to erythrocytes and to <b>cultured</b> <b>epithelial</b> cells...|$|R

A group of genes, invABC and invD, that allow Salmonella typhimurium to penetrate <b>cultured</b> <b>epithelial</b> cells have previously been characterized (J. E. Galán and R. Curtiss III, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 86 : 6383 - 6387, 1989). The distribution of these genes among Salmonella isolates belonging to 37 different species or serovars was investigated by Southern and colony blot hybridization analyses. Regions of high sequence similarity to the invABC genes were present in all Salonella isolates examined, while regions of sequence similarity to the invD gene were present {{in all but one}} (S. arizonae) of the isolates tested, with little restriction fragment length polymorphism. Sequences similar to these genes were not detected in strains of Escherichia coli, Yersinia spp., or Shigella spp. invA mutants (unable to express the invABC genes) of several Salmonella species or serovars, including S. typhi, were constructed and examined for their ability to penetrate Henle- 407 cells.

40|$|The inv and spa loci of Salmonella typhimurium encode a type III protein {{secretion}} {{system which}} {{is essential for}} the ability of this microorganism to gain access to <b>cultured</b> <b>epithelial</b> cells.

We have carried out a functional analysis of several genes of these loci and have found that two exported proteins encoded in this region, InvJ and SpaO, are required for secretion through the invasion-associated type III secretion system. These findings suggest the existence of a hierarchy in the export process, since mutations in other targets of this secretory system have no effect on protein secretion. We have also shown that the spaO, spaP, spaQ, and spaR genes are required for protein secretion and for the ability of S. typhimurium to gain access to <b>cultured</b> <b>epithelial</b> cells.

40|$|One of the {{earliest}} steps in the pathogenic cycle of the facultative intracellular pathogen Salmonella spp. is {{the invasion of the}} cells of the intestinal epithelium. We have previously identified a genetic locus, inv, that allows Salmonella spp. to enter <b>cultured</b> <b>epithelial</b> cells. invA is a member of this locus, and it is the first gene of an operon consisting of at least two additional invasion genes. We have constructed strains carrying nonpolar mutations in invA and examined the individual contribution of this gene to the invasion phenotype of Salmonella typhimurium. Nonpolar S. typhimurium invA mutants were deficient in invasion of <b>cultured</b> <b>epithelial</b> cells although they were fully capable of attaching to the same cells. In addition, unlike wild-type S. typhimurium, invA mutants did not alter the normal architecture of the microvilli of polarized epithelial cells nor did they cause any alterations in the distribution of actin microfilaments of infected cells. The invasion phenotype of invA mutants was readily rescued by wild-type S. typhimurium when <b>cultured</b> <b>epithelial</b> cells were simultaneously infected with both strains. On the contrary, in a similar experiment, the adherent Escherichia coli strain RDEC- 1 was not internalized into cultured cells when coinfected with wild-type S. typhimurium. The invA locus was found to be located at about 59 min on the Salmonella chromosome, 7 % linked to mutS. The nucleotide sequence of invA showed an open reading frame capable of encoding a polypeptide of 686 amino acids with eight possible membrane-spanning regions and a predicted molecular weight of 75, 974. A protein of this size was visualized when invA was expressed in a bacteriophage T 7 RNA polymerase-based expression system. The predicted sequence of InvA was found to be homologous to Caulobacter crescentus FlbF, Yersinia LcrD, Shigella flexneri VirH, and E. coli FlhA proteins.

Two puromycin aminonucleoside (PAN) excretion products were purified by HPLC from urine of PAN-treated rats and characterized by {{nuclear magnetic resonance}} as N 6 -dimethyl- 3 ′amino- 3 ′deoxyadenosine (DA-Ado) and N 6 -methyl- 3 ′amino- 3 ′deoxy-adenosine (MA-Ado), respectively, the former corresponding to unmodified PAN. DA-Ado was not a substrate for adenosine deaminase (ADA), purine nucleoside phosphorylase (PNP) or xanthine oxidase (XO), while MA-Ado was consecutively converted into hypoxanthine by a mixture of ADA and PNP. A different rate of transformation of DA-Ado and MA-Ado into hypoxanthine by isolated glomeruli was observed and was higher for the monomethylated analogue {{by a factor of}} 3 (79 % vs. 21 %); this was ascribed to the rate-limiting level of a demethylase activity acting on DA-Ado. Furthermore, DA-Ado was not transformed by glomerular epithelial cells in culture, while a little amount of MA-Ado was converted into hypoxanthine after six hours of incubation. In spite of this different metabolic behavior, the same order of cytotoxicity on glomerular epithelial cells in culture was observed for MA-Ado, DA-Ado and commercial PAN. All these molecules induced a dose response inhibition of [3 H]thymidine incorporation into DNA after exposure for two hours and a marked alteration of cell viability which was not inhibited by free radical scavengers and deferoxamine. This study provides the first evidence for a glomerular metabolism of PAN and its urinary metabolite MA-Ado involving their transformation via the purine cycle enzymes. The rate of glomerular transformation of PAN in isolated glomeruli and the lack of its metabolism in <b>cultured</b> <b>epithelial</b> cells implies the presence of demethylase enzymes within the glomerulus and their absence in <b>cultured</b> <b>epithelial</b> cells. However, the similar cytotoxic effect of PAN and MA-Ado on <b>cultured</b> <b>epithelial</b> cells supports the concept that a mechanism which does not involve the purine cycle is responsible for PAN glomerular toxicity in vitro...|$|R

NE is known to stimulate {{the growth of a}} range of bacterial species, and to increase the pathogenicity of Escherichia coli. Aim: To determine the effects of NE on the pathogenic potential of C jejuni in a model system. Methods: C jejuni was grown in iron-replete and iron-limited media in the presence and absence of 100 mM NE. Several virulence-associated characteristics, including motility and cell invasion, were measured. Results: When C jejuni was grown in iron-limited media in the presence of NE, growth rate, motility and invasion of <b>cultured</b> <b>epithelial</b> cells were increased compared with cultures grown in the absence of NE. Bacteria exposed to NE during growth also caused greater subsequent disruption of <b>cultured</b> <b>epithelial</b> cell monolayers, inducing widespread breakdown of tight junctions.

To investigate the influence of keratinocytes on fibroblast proliferation and fibronectin synthesis, we used an in vitro separated co-culture model in which <b>epithelial</b> sheets were <b>cultured</b> above fibroblast monolayers without physical contact. We also investigated the response of fibroblasts to keratinocyte- conditioned medium (KCM) obtained from confluent and subconfluent keratinocyte monolayers. Both <b>cultured</b> <b>epithelial</b> sheets, composed of adherent fully confluent keratinocytes, and their conditioned medium, reduced fibroblast proliferation. However, KCM from subconfluent keratinocytes stimulated fibroblast proliferation at low concentrations while inhibiting it at higher concentrations, indicating that keratinocytes can produce both mitogenic and growth-inhibiting factors for fibroblasts. KCM, but not epithelial sheet co-culture, also inhibited fibroblast fibronectin synthesis. This indicates regulation of fibroblast phenotype by soluble factors released by the keratinocyte and also {{suggests that there is}} a dialogue between keratinocytes and fibroblasts with respect to fibronectin production.

Finally, as far as possible, animal components were systematically removed from the cell culture environment. Today, quality controlled allograft production batches are routine and, due to efficient cryopreservation, stocks are created for off-the-shelf use. These optimisations have significantly increased the performance, usability, quality and safety of our allografts. This paper describes, in detail, our current cryopreserved allograft production process...|$|R
40|$|It is critical, {{both for}} the host and for the {{long-term}} benefit of the bacteria that colonize the gut, that bacterial overgrowth with subsequent bacterial translocation, which may lead to sepsis and death of the host, be avoided. Secretory IgA (sIgA) {{is known to be}} a key factor in this process, agglutinating bacteria and preventing their translocation in a process termed ‘immune exclusion’. To determine whether human sIgA might facilitate the growth of normal enteric bacteria under some conditions, the growth of human enteric bacteria on <b>cultured,</b> fixed human <b>epithelial</b> cells was evaluated in the presence of sIgA or various other proteins. Human sIgA was found to facilitate biofilm formation by normal human gut flora and by Escherichia coli on <b>cultured</b> human <b>epithelial</b> cell surfaces under conditions in which non-adherent bacteria were repeatedly washed away. In addition, the presence of sIgA resulted in a 64 % increase in adherence of E. coli to live <b>cultured</b> <b>epithelial</b> cells over a 45 -min period. Mucin, another defence factor thought to {{play a key role in}} immune exclusion, was found to facilitate biofilm formation by E. coli. Our findings suggest that sIgA may contribute to biofilm formation in the gut...|$|R
40|$|Pranlukast is a {{selective}} cysteinyl leukotriene 1 (cysLT 1) receptor antagonist, {{and is now}} widely used {{in the treatment of}} asthma. The anti-asthmatic effect of pranlukast may be rendered not only by antileukotriene activity, but also by other pharmacological activity. This study was designed to investigate whether pranlukast had inhibitory effects on nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) activation and mucin gene expression in <b>cultured</b> human <b>epithelial</b> cells. Luciferase assay was mainly used for analysis. <b>Cultured</b> <b>epithelial</b> cells were transfected with NF-κB luciferase vector, MUC 2 or MUC 5 AC luciferase vectors. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) significantly increased NF-κB activation in NCI-H 292 cells, which was inhibited by the pretreatment by pranlukast in a dose-dependent manner. Either LTD 4 or pranlukast alone did not increase NF-κB activation in NCI-H 292 cells. Pranlukast also inhibited NF-κB activation induced by phorbol 12 -myristate 13 -acetate (PMA). Pranlukast also significantly inhibited LPS-induced MUC 2 mRNA expression by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis in NCI-H 292 cells. Pranlukast also inhibited LPS-induced MUC 2 gene expression in HM 3 -MUC 2 cells. However, pranlukast did not inhibit MUC 5 AC gene transcription activity induced by lipoteichoic acid (LTA) in NCI-H 292 cells. These results suggest that pranlukast may inhibit NF-κB activation and MUC 2 gene transcription through pathways distinct from cysLT 1 receptor antagonism in <b>cultured</b> human <b>epithelial</b> cells...|$|R
