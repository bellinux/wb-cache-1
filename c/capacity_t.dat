All participants (N = 17) performed two trials of the 20 M Sprint Capacity test with the SmartWheel placed on each side of a wheelchair, provided by the researcher. Results of this research focus on the potential relationships existing between the variables of push length (r =. 650), push frequency (r =. 594), peak force (r =. 540), and speed performance as measured in meters/second by the SmartWheel. The relationships between classification level of the athletes and speed in meters/second suggested a significant relationship (r =. 859). Due to the highly correlated relationship between classification level and speed, athlete classification (i. e., class) was partialed out to control for this relationship. When partial correlations were analyzed, push length and speed were no longer significantly correlated (r =. 175, p =. 532). Push frequency and speed (m/s) remained significantly correlated (r =. 573, p =. 026); however, peak force and speed (m/s) also were no longer significantly correlated (r =. 464, p =. 081).

40|$|Background Versican, a chondroitin {{sulphate}} proteoglycan, {{is one of}} the key components of the provi-sional extracellular matrix expressed after injury. The current study evaluated the hypothe-sis that a versican-rich matrix alters the phenotype of cultured fibroblasts. Methods and Results The full-length cDNA for the V 1 isoform of human versican was cloned and the recombinant proteoglycan was expressed in murine fibroblasts. Versican expression induced a marked change in fibroblast phenotype. Functionally, the versican-expressing fibroblasts prolifer-ated faster and displayed enhanced cell adhesion, but migrated slower than control cells. These changes in cell function were associated with greater N-cadherin and integrin β 1 expression, along with increased FAK phosphorylation. The versican-expressing fibroblasts also displayed expression of smooth muscle α-actin, a marker of myofibroblast differentia-tion.
