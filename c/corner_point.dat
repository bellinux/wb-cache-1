40|$|Abstract. The {{proposed}} technique {{deals with}} jigsaw puzzles and {{takes advantage of}} both geometrical and color features. It is considered that an image is being divided into pieces. The shape of these pieces is not predefined, yet the background’s color is. The whole method concerns a recurrent algorithm, which initially, finds the most important <b>corner</b> <b>points</b> around the contour of a piece, afterwards performs color segmentation with a Kohonen’s SOFM based technique and finally uses a comparing routine. This routine {{is based on the}} <b>corner</b> <b>points</b> found before. It compares a set of angles, the color of the image around the region of the <b>corner</b> <b>points,</b> the color of the contour and finally compares sequences of points by calculating the Euclidean distance of luminance between them. At a final stage the method decides which pieces match. If the result is not satisfying, the algorithm is being repeated with new adaptive modified parameter values as far as the <b>corner</b> <b>points</b> and the color segmentation is concerned. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Detection of {{vascular}} bifurcations is {{a challenging}} task in multimodal retinal image registration. Existing algorithms based on bifurcations usually fail in correctly aligning poor qual-ity retinal image pairs. To solve this problem, we propose a novel highly distinctive local feature descriptor named partial intensity invariant feature descriptor (PIIFD) and describe a robust auto-matic retinal image registration framework named Harris-PIIFD. PIIFD is invariant to image rotation, partially invariant to image intensity, affine transformation, and viewpoint/perspective change. Our Harris-PIIFD framework {{consists of four}} steps. First, <b>corner</b> <b>points</b> are used as control point candidates instead of bifurcations since <b>corner</b> <b>points</b> are sufficient and uniformly distributed across the image domain.
