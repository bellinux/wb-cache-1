40|$|Electric rail {{vehicles}} {{are driven by}} the current collected from the electrical lines of the railway catenary system. For this purpose, trains are equipped with a current collector (the pantograph) that comes {{in contact with the}} wires by means of a pair of <b>carbon</b> <b>strips.</b> The sliding movement along the wires subjects the <b>carbon</b> <b>strips</b> to wear and damage so that frequent inspection is essential to ensure the train and catenary safety. In this paper we describe an automatic visual inspection system, made of a 3 D laser scanner and a 2 D high resolution camera, which is able to automatically determine the health state of the railway contact strips thanks to a sophisticated data processing tool. The system collects color and geometrics information on the <b>carbon</b> <b>strips</b> and performs several automated assessments both on the 3 D and 2 D data. For each test, the system provides an index and decides between three different levels of wear (low, medium, high) to support the human operator in inspection and maintenance decisions.

40|$|When {{graphite}} is ball milled, Raman spectra and X-ray diffractograms of {{the products}} show increasing graphitic structural disorder with 1 % and 10 % cobalt addition. However, if sufficient cobalt (10 % weight for weight) is added, this process is reduced in rate. This process is attributed to the cobalt stabilizing the graphitic structure during ball milling, thus reducing the degree of lattice-disorder. When the mixture is annealed, well-ordered <b>carbon</b> <b>strips</b> encapsulating cobalt nanoparticles are observed {{in the presence of}} cobalt. Annealing reorganizes the disordered structures and 10 % cobalt loading is more effective than a 1 % loading in this process.

40|$|Wheels, {{brake pads}} and {{pantograph}} <b>carbon</b> <b>strips</b> of modern electric trains are three safety critical elements, which are always subject to {{wear and tear}} during normal running and daily operation. Inspection process of the wheel and brake pad wear is extremely labour intensive and time-consuming, due to their large quantity in each train. Moreover, before the manual inspection {{can be carried out}} from the underframe of the train, it is necessary to shunt the train concerned onto the maintenance pit. Thus additional time is required for shunting logistics due to the limited number of pits in depot. On the other hand, to check the wear on <b>carbon</b> <b>strips,</b> manual gauging is the common practice, which requires access to the train roof. Thus it needs a high-level platform and electrical isolation of the overhead power line prior to the examination. It is again no doubt to be a time-consuming process and causes degradation on the efficiency of the regular maintenance. Therefore, to enhance the productivity, an automatic and integrated Vehicle Monitoring System (VMS) utilising laser assisted image processing technology, which comprises three monitoring systems, namely wheel profile, brake pad and pantograph wear monitoring systems, is introduced in the Kowloon-Canton Railway Corporation (KCRC) Tai Wai Depot to automatically monitor the condition of wheels, brake pads and pantograph <b>carbon</b> <b>strips</b> of the Ma On Shan 4 -car Electric Multiple Units (EMUs) and measure their respective wear pattern, when the train passes the train washing plant daily.

In February 1845 he and a business associate, Edward Augustin King (d.1863), set out for England to secure British and French patents for the invention. King described construction and use of a lamp in September 1845, and British patent No. 10,919 was granted to King on November 4, 1845. The patent described two styles of lamp. In one, a platinum strip (or filament) was operated in a glass enclosure, but {{was not in a}} vacuum. In the second type, a <b>carbon</b> <b>strip</b> held between two clamps was enclosed in a vacuum in the space above a column of mercury, in an arrangement similar to a barometer. The mercury column was required because vacuum pumps of the time could not provide the high vacuum needed to operate a carbon emitter for a practical duration.

The company was to make all the equipment necessary to generate and distribute electricity. The distribution of electricity produced by the company was not only for lighting, but for other purposes as well.In 1878, the Electro-Dynamic Light Company demonstrated an electric light that was the invention of Sawyer and Man. An exhibition was set up in New York City on October 29, 1878. The same exhibition was mentioned several weeks later in a newspaper of Princeton, Minnesota, and Bismarck, North Dakota. The lamp was described as a strip of pencil carbon graphite connected with two wires to an electric generator. The <b>carbon</b> <b>strip</b> was in a hermetically sealed glass bulb that was filled with nitrogen gas.
