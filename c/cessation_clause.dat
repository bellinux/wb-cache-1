40|$|The {{dissertation}} investigates South Africa’s {{legal aspects}} pertaining to voluntary repatriation of refugees. The repatriation of Mozambican and Angolan refugees {{was referred to}} in order to examine the loopholes in the process of repatriating them. This study moreover examines whether the application of the <b>cessation</b> <b>clause</b> is in contravention of the principle of non-refoulement, which is intrinsically the cornerstone for voluntariness of repatriation. The analysis of international, regional and South Africa’s refugee protection framework demonstrates that South Africa affords refugees the protection required by international law. This has been compared with states’ practice and case law with regards to refugee protection in countries including Canada and the United Kingdom. Although South Africa, Canada and the United Kingdom have comprehensive legal framework governing refugees’ protection, refugees’ rights have been violated on numerous occasions. The dissertation consequently concludes that notwithstanding the presence of international, regional and domestic legislations, the rights of refugees are violated due to their vulnerability and the repatriation process ignores the principle of voluntariness on several occasions.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} the use by States of the 'changed circumstances' cessation provision in Article IC(5) of the Refugee Convention, {{and the wider}} implications of this practice for international refugee law. It focuses in particular on {{the application of the}} <b>cessation</b> <b>clause</b> to refugees from Iraq and Afghanistan - two countries which, despite changes in country conditions, continue to experience civil conflict and security concerns. A number of important interpretative issues arise in relation to cessation under Article I C(5) of the Convention. These include: the relationship between the criteria for recognition and cessation of refugee status under Articles 1 A(2) and 1 C(5) of the Convention; what is required to constitute a 'change in circumstances' in the country of origin; the applicable burden and standard of proof and the meaning of 'protection'. The interpretation of 'protection' in this context is particular important, not only for elucidation of the cessation criteria, but also more broadly for the meaning of protection under international refugee law. As such the thesis canvasses debates which are pertinent to many other contentious areas of refugee law, including the relationship between the refugee definition and complementary protection, application of the Refugee Convention in situations of armed conflict, and the role of non-state bodies as actors of protection. It also illustrates some of the central problems with {{the way in which the}} 1951 Refugee Convention is implemented domestically in key asylum host states. The arguments put forward in this thesis have particular significance for the return of asylum-seekers and refugees to situations of ongoing conflict and post-conflict situations and is therefore highly pertinent to the future development of international refugee law...|$|E
40|$|Despite the every-day {{prevalence}} {{of the term}} ‘refugee’, fundamental questions often remain unasked. What meanings do actors associate with the label? What intentions might be driving the word's use and/or manipulation? And what implications might the existence of multiple interpretations have for the persons under discussion and the processes within which they sit? Though this is evidently important in popular accounts, where the term's misuse fuels anti-immigration sentiments and societal mistrust, the ramifications of these multiple interpretations for assisting refugees and negotiating durable solutions have lacked critical exploration. Existing approaches to understanding {{the politics of the}} refugee regime have tended to focus on physical sites of contestation, such as refugee camps. This article re-introduces semiotics as a heuristic framework through which to understand how the word ‘refugee’ in itself constitutes a disputed arena, and to explore what impacts this has on negotiations over their future. This approach is used to explain the controversial negotiations surrounding the invocation of the <b>Cessation</b> <b>Clause</b> for Rwandan refugees in Uganda. Extensive resistance to the cancellation of Rwandan refugees’ statuses has not been met by commensurate attempts to explain when, why and how this process unfolded. Through conceptualising the word ‘refugee’ as a sign according to the Saussurean and Barthean models of semiotics, this piece charts the multiple meanings that this label signified alongside its established legal-normative definition, and discusses what implications this had for how durable solutions were negotiated. Disaggregating the label provides a route through which to explore what enables the conceptual and spatial dissonance that plagues certain attempts to conclude protracted refugee situations. The piece concludes by discussing the analytical possibilities that emerge from re-engaging with socio-semiotic approaches, including through proposing greater engagement with the political geographies of words and their meanings...|$|E
40|$|The {{challenges}} {{posed by}} situations of mass influx and protracted refugee emergencies have prompted a reexamination {{of the international}} asylum regime established by the 1951 Convention and subsequent instruments. This has included increasing attention to the <b>cessation</b> <b>clauses</b> of the 1951 Convention and Statute of the Office of the High Commissioner for Refugees. The <b>cessation</b> <b>clauses</b> establish the linkage between the duration of international protection and the basis for recognition of refugee status. To some, the clauses therefore {{appear to be a}} potentially useful method of ensuring that international protection is reserved for those who truly need it...|$|R
40|$|Over {{one hundred}} {{thousand}} Rwandans are currently living abroad as refugees, mostly in the nearby countries of east and central Africa. The Rwandan government, under the authoritarian leadership of President Paul Kagame, is working to convince both its people and the powerful international donor community that Rwanda has recovered, that it has reconciled, {{and that it is}} now safe for refugees to return. In October of 2009 the United Nations’ refugee agency, the UNHCR, issued a recommendation that its “ceased circumstances” <b>cessation</b> clauses—Chapter I(C), <b>clauses</b> (5) and (6) of the organization’s Convention—be invoked with respect to these Rwandan refugees. These provisions allow the UN and refugee asylum countries to determine when the reasons for a particular refugee crisis have ended. In July of this year, all remaining Rwandan refugees will lose their group refugee status and the legal protection and benefits this status carries. Many of them will be forced to repatriate. Citing the crimes of Kagame’s military forces both during and after the 1994 Genocide, as well as the repressive political conditions the country continues to experience today, Rwandan refugees are concerned that a forced return will mean exposure to very real and continued fears and dangers. Confronted by both this possibility and by the entirety of their lives and experiences in exile, these refugees must continually renegotiate their notions of “home” and “belonging. ”honors thesis 201...|$|R
40|$|Asylum and {{refugees}} {{in the light of}} the case law of the European Court of Human Rights The thesis deals with issues of asylum {{and refugees}} in the context of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms and the case law of the European Court of Human Rights. The purpose of the thesis is to show a tight relationship between refugee law and protection of human rights. The text is divided into seven chapters. In the introduction, the terms asylum and refugees are distinguished and a refugee is defined according to the crucial document of international refugee law, the Convention relating to the Status of Refugees. The definition of a refugee is outlined using inclusion, <b>cessation</b> and exclusion <b>clauses.</b> The next chapter is dedicated to the rule of non-refoulement stated in the Article 33 of the Refugee Convention, which prohibits states from expelling and deporting a refugee back to a country, where his life or freedom is threatened. The following part focuses on the European Convention on Human Rights and its surveillance done by the European Court of Human Rights. This part also examines the procedural issues of dealing with complaints on breach of the European Convention on Human Rights. Key chapter six is split into subchapters according to relevant provisions of the [...] ...|$|R
40|$|The {{study of}} urban {{planning}} in post-conflict settlements {{is an area}} of research that has not yet been thoroughly explored. Yet planning occupies a unique position at the interface between communities, the state, and the physical environment, and is strategically located to deal with many common long-term impacts of conflict in societies. As such it deserves greater attention and consideration for the contribution it can make to reconstruction and peace-building. This study interrogates the notion of post-conflict urban planning within the case of Nyagatare, Rwanda, a town that has been almost entirely settled by returned refugees and post-conflict migrants since the 1994 genocide in Rwanda. The town has seen rapid population growth and this year was designated as one of six secondary cities selected for focused investment and further population growth: this post-conflict rise from village to secondary city in less than two decades is unprecedented in Rwanda. Field research was conducted and qualitative data collected through interviews in the field. Further information and analysis came from NGO and government reports, as well as drawing from work by previous researchers. The research found that there are still several lasting impacts from conflict, including disputes over land, weak civil society, weak local democratic process, lack of social cohesion and high rates of social distrust, and suspicious attitudes towards the state. Nyagatare {{is likely to be a}} hotspot for resettlement, voluntary or otherwise, of returning refugees who have lost their protected status under the recent invocation of the refugee <b>Cessation</b> <b>Clause</b> by the Government of Rwanda and the UNHCR. Post-conflict impacts are thus likely to be compounded with ongoing influxes of population, both through refugee resettlement and domestic migration. Yet current spatial planning fails to address these impacts of conflict as well as failing to appropriately anticipate the needs of future populations of the town. This study thus seeks to propose an alternative framework for planning that directly addresses the lasting impacts of conflict. Recommendations for planning include adapting co-production and strategic spatial planning to the local context, incorporating traditional mediation structures to allow for a safe venue for engaging communities. Focused strategic interventions, rather than a master plan, are recommended in order to allow for flexibility and uncertainty as the town grows and society stabilises...|$|E
40|$|Chickens {{launched}} by former immigration minister Philip Ruddock are {{coming home to}} roost in the portfolio of Senator Amanda Vanstone. Peter Mares argues {{that it is time}} to clean up the mess In October 1999, Philip Ruddock created the three-year temporary protection visa (TPV) for refugees who arrived on our shores without authorisation. Prior to this everyone recognised as a refugee in Australia was granted permanent residence, regardless of how they got here. Ruddock’s aim was to deter Middle Eastern asylum seekers who were arriving in increasing numbers by boat from Indonesia by granting them a second-class refugee status, which prevented them from applying for family reunion. The policy not only failed, it had the unintended effect of encouraging more women and children to make the voyage on dangerous boats, since that was the only way to reunite families in Australia. The bulk of the 8912 TPVs issued since temporary visas were introduced have been given to refugees from Afghanistan (3661 visas) and Iraq (4269). Those visas have now expired or will soon expire, which means that the refugees must either return home or prove to the Department of Immigration, Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (DIMIA) that they need on-going protection in Australia. TPV holders generally attempt the latter approach and the department generally turns them down. As of 14 May 2004, DIMIA had made 1192 primary decisions made on TPV holders applying for further protection; in 991 cases the application had been refused. Most of these decisions involved refugees from Afghanistan. The government’s argument - the same argument used when it offered Afghans cash incentives called ‘reintegration packages’ to be repatriated - is that since the fall of the Taliban the refugees are no longer at risk of persecution in their homeland. The refugees have an automatic right of appeal to the Refugee Review Tribunal, however, and the tribunal is proving to be much more sympathetic to the Afghans’ plight. Since the beginning of this financial year, the tribunal has considered the appeals of 271 Afghans who had been told by DIMIA that they were no longer refugees. In 244 of those cases, the tribunal ‘set aside’ the department’s decision, arguing that the applicants in question should be allowed to stay in Australia. In short, the tribunal says immigration department officers got it wrong 90 per cent of the time, when they refused to grant further protection to refugees from Afghanistan whose temporary visas had expired. This is an extraordinary figure, given that on average the tribunal overturns less than 10 percent of all cases. So why are the immigration department and the refugee review tribunal reaching opposite conclusions in TPV cases from Afghanistan? When the question was raised late last month in Senate Estimates, the explanation was that circumstances in Afghanistan had changed between the time decisions were made by DIMIA officers and the time those cases came before the tribunal. In other words, the tribunal was acting on newer, more negative country information than departmental decision makers. But refugee lawyers say this is only part of the picture. Another factor is the interpretation put on that country information. DIMIA has consistently put a positive spin on the situation in Afghanistan (in marked contrast to the dire travel warnings issued by the Department of Foreign Affairs). Most Afghan applicants are from the Hazara ethnic minority and most Hazara are Shia Muslims. In Sunni-majority Afghanistan they have experienced discrimination over generations. The Hazara were a special target for abuse under the former Taliban regime and, in the view of the tribunal, they are still at risk. A summary judgement, printed in the tribunal’s May monthly report, describes the situation in the following terms. The Tribunal noted that progress had been made in eradicating the Taliban and the ethnic and religious persecution of the Hazaras. However it found that the trend to improvement had been influenced by recent deteriorations involving attacks by the Taliban, worsening security, and uncertainty around international support and involvement. In other decisions, the tribunal has found that Taliban supporters are still ‘active and dangerous’ in particular provinces and questioned whether government authorities could provide ‘adequate protection’ for returning refugees. One tribunal member found that ‘there was a discriminatory failure on the part of the Afghan government’ to provide residents of the Hazara area of Kabul with ‘access to law enforcement’. The fact that departmental officers appear to wear rose coloured glasses when viewing country information from Afghanistan goes some way to explaining the discrepancy in decision making between DIMIA and the tribunal. But according to refugee lawyer David Manne, there is another more important factor. Manne is the coordinator of Melbourne’s Refugee and Immigration Legal Centre and sits on the board of the Refugee Council of Australia. He says that when a refugee on a temporary visa seeks further protection in Australia, DIMIA and the tribunal apply completely different legal tests. DIMIA requires applicants to prove their case for refugee status all over again, as if they had just arrived in Australia, whereas the tribunal puts the onus of proof on the authorities to show why the applicant is no longer a refugee. DIMIA’s approach is based the definition of a refugee contained in Article 1 A of the 1951 Refugee Convention - that is, it requires applicants to demonstrate a well founded fear of persecution on the basis of their race, religion, nationality, political opinion or membership of a particular social group. The tribunal’s approach is based Article 1. C (5), known as the <b>cessation</b> <b>clause,</b> which applies when the circumstances under which a person was granted refugee status ‘have ceased to exist’. In applying this test, the tribunal must be convinced that change in the homeland is so fundamental and so durable that the returning refugees are no longer at risk - a difficult case to make in relation to Afghanistan. The courts will eventually decide which approach is correct. In the meantime, the department is setting the bar much higher than its review body. Refugees stumble at the first hurdle but frequently clear the second. This is a waste of public money (this year the Finance Department costed tribunal cases at $ 3500 each) and causes unnecessary suffering to vulnerable people, who may wait months for their cases to be decided. The potential for further waste and further delay is great. There are another 400 Afghan cases awaiting decisions at the tribunal and DIMIA has only just started processing applications from Iraqi refugees whose TPVs have expired and who are seeking further protection. (Processing of Iraqi applicants was frozen for more than a year because of the uncertain political situation in post-war Iraq.) THERE are indications that the immigration minister, Amanda Vanstone, is looking to clean up the TPV mess and come up with a more pragmatic solution. It is understood that she has requested an options paper from her department on how to deal with Iraqi refugees on temporary protection visas. It is to be hoped that this process may produce a sensible outcome, such as a mechanism to convert all temporary protection visas to permanent visas (unless there is strong evidence to indicate that the initial visa was obtained under false pretences). This would also address one of the other iniquities of the convoluted TPV system, which means that some TPV holders may never be eligible for permanent residence in Australia (and so never be able to apply for family reunion or travel outside Australia without giving up all right of return). But refugee advocates and lawyers are not holding their breath. Even if Senator Vanstone comes up with a workable solution, chances are that she will fail to win backing for it in cabinet. After all, this is what happened to her predecessor, Philip Ruddock, when he tried to argue for a special humanitarian visa for asylum seekers from East Timor. The East Timorese cases were frozen for years pending the outcome of protracted legal proceedings. By the time DIMIA began considering the East Timorese cases, Indonesia was no longer occupying East Timor and their chances of being recognised as refugees were slim. When Ruddock failed to secure cabinet approval for a special visa for the East Timorese, what emerged instead was a cumbersome ‘work around’ solution. East Timorese asylum seekers are forced to go through the motions of applying for refugee status with DIMIA, then appealing to the tribunal, even though there is almost no chance of a successful outcome in either case. It is only after jumping through those hoops that the East Timorese can make an individual request to the minister to use her non-compellable discretion to grant a visa on humanitarian grounds. While the minister generally takes a sympathetic view of the East Timorese cases, this is hardly good public policy. Unfortunately, a similar messy outcome is foreseeable in the case of TPV-refugees seeking further protection. But even in Senator Vanstone is unable or unwilling to push for a comprehensive solution, she could at least improve the current TPV shambles by instructing DIMIA officers to apply the same legal test and use the same country information assessment as their colleagues at the Refugee Review Tribunal.
