500|$|It {{had also}} been some time since a Copland piece had been {{appreciated}} widely by audiences. His opera The Tender Land had not fared well, either in its original or revised forms. Choreographer Jerome Robbins never produced Copland's ballet Dance Panels, {{despite the fact that}} he had commissioned it. None of his major orchestral works from the 1960s—Connotations, Music for a Great City, Emblems and Inscape—made much of an impact with audiences. Nor do they fit in either the populist or modernist parts of Copland's compositional output. [...] Copland was aware that dodecaphonism did not hold as high a place as it had previously and writes, [...] "By the sixties, serialism had been around for over fifty years; young composers were not so fascinated with it anymore." [...] Nonetheless, he did not want to be pigeonholed. He told American composer Walter Piston in 1963, [...] "People always want to shove me into the American idea more than I really want. Nobody wants to be an 'American' composer now as they did." [...] He told another friend, [...] "Young composers today wouldn't be <b>caught</b> <b>dead</b> with a folk tune!" [...] He heard a considerable amount of new music through his association with Tanglewood and might not have wanted to be left behind. At the same time, he might not have become totally at home with serialism. He confided to Verna Fine, [...] "I don't feel comfortable with the twelve-tone system, but I don't want to keep repeating myself." ...|$|E

Madonna is Madonna for a reason. And we saw it firsthand Sunday." [...] Chicago Tribune critic Greg Kot called the show an [...] "S party to Ancient Egypt". Along with reminding the audience of her older hits, Madonna had [...] "important career-advancing work to do ... after all, never does anything unless she's got something to sell, and with a new studio album due out in March and a tour to follow, she had plenty on her to-do list". Jon Pareles of The New York Times wrote that although the singer was not as [...] "indefatigable" [...] as she had been, she was a [...] "party girl turned regent: a queen on her throne, a homecoming queen strutting in the bleachers, a church singer fronting a choir". Pareles called Madonna [...] "grown-up", and wrote that she put on a show appropriate for the NFL. Peter Robinson of The Guardian called the performance low-key for the singer, despite the large audience. Robinson wrote that the show's budget would [...] " [...] your average James Cameron effort look like Homes Under the Hammer", and called Madonna's entrance and exit his favorite parts of the show.|$|E

500|$|Ready {{received}} mostly positive {{reviews from}} professional critics, which received an aggregate score of 67 out of 100. The score, indicating [...] "generally favorable reviews" [...] {{was based on}} six reviews from website Metacritic. It received many comparisons {{to the work of}} R artist R.

David Jeffries of Allmusic said that [...] "Even at a whopping 17 like-minded tracks, all-night lovers wouldn't be <b>caught</b> <b>dead</b> complaining about how overly long it all is", commenting that Ready [...] "is as entertaining and frivolous as a one-night stand should be."

[...] Capobianco commended tracks like [...] "Be Where You Are," [...] and [...] "Love Lost", commenting that [...] "tracks like that show that he is indeed ready for the next step." [...] Andrew Rennie of Now said, [...] "slight deviations from R classic formula allow Trey Songz wiggle room to play with his multi-octave voice. This offering sets him apart from other acts and may secure his spot in the canon of bedroom crooners." [...] Glenn Gamboa of Newsday said that after making his name for singing hooks on rap songs, that he [...] "shows his smooth R vocals can hold the spotlight all on their own." [...] Rolling Stone gave the album 3½ out of 5 stars and wrote that Songz [...] "takes cues from R. Kelly, slyly mocking the self-parodying excesses of boudoir R while supplying the utilitarian goods: the sumptuous vocal harmonies and sultry beats upon which long nights beneath ceiling mirrors depend". A writer for USA Today said the album reflects his broad appeal, and that Songz's proves [...] "he's comfortable as a rogue or romantic. Even though the review pointed out that [...] "he occasionally falls back on booty-call clichés," [...] it did point out that [...] "his song craft shines on the edgy [...] "Black Roses" [...] and regretful [...] "Love Lost." [...] Jon Caramanica of The New York Times said, [...] "'Ready' is one of the year’s most promising R albums, and a curious one at that", commenting, [...] "the results are bawdy but never lecherous; sometimes all his enthusiastic bedroom talk has an air of childlike goofiness to it, as if he were thrilled to get away with boasting so freely."

Metheny believes that the main reason why Kenny G has become unpopular and easy to attack by accomplished jazz musicians is due to the [...] "fact that he sells an enormous amount of records while not being anywhere near a really great player in relation to the standards that have been set on his instrument over the past sixty or seventy years". [...] Branford Marsalis once stated in an interview with Jazziz magazine: [...] "When all these jazz guys get in a tizzy over Kenny G, they need to leave Kenny alone. He's not stealing jazz.

David McGrath, emeritus professor of English, College of DuPage, discussed his own decision to attend Chicago State University in the 24 July 2007 Chicago Tribune article, Ode to a fourth-tier college. Of this decision, he noted that, [...] "I qualified for admission elsewhere, but CSU was close to my part-time job, and it was cheap [...] I never required a student loan since I earned enough as a grocery bagger to pay tuition and fees in 1970 that totaled $300 per year. All told, a pretty good value, even for a fourth-tier school." [...] McGrath considered it a [...] "good value," [...] because, [...] "CSU eventually led to a teaching career, and my working alongside professors from Princeton, Northwestern, and the University of Chicago.

[...] He also referenced the 2000 Krueger-Dale study (which compared groups of students who received the same SAT scores, attended both high and low-income schools, and found no difference in post-graduation success rates [...] ) and noted that, [...] "too often, it seems, students choose colleges the way they choose jeans or athletic shoes.
