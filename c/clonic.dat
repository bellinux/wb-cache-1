5|$|There are six main {{types of}} {{generalized}} seizures: tonic-clonic, tonic, <b>clonic,</b> myoclonic, absence, and atonic seizures. They all involve {{loss of consciousness}} and typically happen without warning.|$|E
5|$|A seizure {{underwater}} {{requires that}} the diver {{be brought to the}} surface as soon as practicable. Although for many years the recommendation has been not to raise the diver during the seizure itself, owing to the danger of arterial gas embolism (AGE), {{there is some evidence that}} the glottis does not fully obstruct the airway. This has led to the current recommendation by the Diving Committee of the Undersea and Hyperbaric Medical Society that a diver should be raised during the seizure's <b>clonic</b> (convulsive) phase if the regulator is not in the diver's mouth– as the danger of drowning is then greater than that of AGE– but the ascent should be delayed until the end of the <b>clonic</b> phase otherwise. Rescuers ensure that their own safety is not compromised during the convulsive phase. They then ensure that where the victim's air supply is established it is maintained, and carry out a controlled buoyant lift. Lifting an unconscious body is taught by most diver training agencies. Upon reaching the surface, emergency services are always contacted as there is a possibility of further complications requiring medical attention. The U.S. Navy has procedures for completing the decompression stops where a recompression chamber is not immediately available.|$|E
5|$|Redback spider bites are {{difficult}} to diagnose in pets unless witnessed. Dogs appear to have some resistance. They are at serious risk only if bitten many times, and rarely need antivenom. Cats {{are likely to be}} more susceptible and require antivenom, which can reverse symptoms very quickly. Guinea pigs, horses and camels are very susceptible. As with humans, the symptoms are predominantly autonomic in nature alongside pain at the bite site. Dogs may also suffer vomiting and diarrhoea, muscle tremors or <b>clonic</b> contractions, and abdominal wall rigidity, while cats may salivate excessively, protrude their tongue or be overexcitable.|$|E
5|$|Central {{nervous system}} oxygen {{toxicity}} manifests as {{symptoms such as}} visual changes (especially tunnel vision), ringing in the ears (tinnitus), nausea, twitching (especially of the face), behavioural changes (irritability, anxiety, confusion), and dizziness. This may {{be followed by a}} tonic–clonic seizure consisting of two phases: intense muscle contraction occurs for several seconds (tonic phase); followed by rapid spasms of alternate muscle relaxation and contraction producing convulsive jerking (<b>clonic</b> phase). The seizure ends with a period of unconsciousness (the postictal state). The onset of seizure depends upon the partial pressure of oxygen in the breathing gas and exposure duration. However, exposure time before onset is unpredictable, as tests have shown a wide variation, both amongst individuals, and in the same individual from day to day. In addition, many external factors, such as underwater immersion, exposure to cold, and exercise will decrease the time to onset of central nervous system symptoms. Decrease of tolerance is closely linked to retention of carbon dioxide. Other factors, such as darkness and caffeine, increase tolerance in test animals, but these effects have not been proven in humans.|$|E
25|$|Hemifacial {{sensorimotor}} seizures {{are often}} entirely localised {{in the lower}} lip or spread to the ipsilateral hand. Motor manifestations are sudden, continuous or bursts of <b>clonic</b> contractions, usually lasting from {{a few seconds to}} a minute. Ipsilateral tonic deviation of the mouth is also common. Hemifacial sensory symptoms consist of unilateral numbness mainly {{in the corner of the}} mouth.|$|E

25|$|EEG tracings from volunteers during orgasm {{were first}} {{obtained}} by Mosovich and Tallaferro in 1954. These research workers recorded EEC changes resembling petit mal or the <b>clonic</b> {{phase of a}} grand mal seizure. Further studies in this direction were carried out by Sem-Jacobsen (1968), Heath (1972), Cohen et al. (1976), and others. Sarrel et al. reported a similar observation in 1977. These reports continue to be cited. Unlike them, Craber et al. (1985) failed to find any distinctive EEG changes in four men during masturbation and ejaculation; the authors concluded that {{the case for the}} existence of EEG changes specifically related to sexual arousal and orgasm remained unproven. So disagreement arises as to whether the experiment conducted by Mosovich & Tallaferro casts a new light on the nature of orgasm. In some recent studies, authors tend to adopt the opposite point of view that there are no remarkable EEG changes during ejaculation in humans.|$|E
25|$|At {{the age of}} 2 years, a {{girl had}} an {{autonomic}} status epilepticus during sleep. This was characterized by pallor, progressive impairment of consciousness, and vomiting that lasted 45 minutes. A second episode occurred after 11 months, during sleep, and consisted of impairment of consciousness, hypotonia, deviation of the eyes to the right, hypersalivation, and right-sided <b>clonic</b> convulsions. It was terminated after 45 minutes with rectal diazepam. Treatment with carbamazepine was initiated. After 6 months, she had a third episode similar to the previous ones, but shorter. At the age of 4 years 9 months, during an ambulatory EEG, she had another autonomic seizure with marked ictal EEG abnormalities, but again, the interictal did not show any spikes. Carbamazepine was replaced with phenobarbital. All 12 interictal EEGs during the active seizure period, 6 of them during sleep, were normal. At last follow-up {{at the age of}} 16 years, she was well, a good student, unmedicated, and seizure-free for 11 years.|$|E
500|$|Tonic-clonic {{seizures}} {{occur with}} a contraction of the limbs followed by their extension along with arching {{of the back}} which lasts 10–30seconds (the tonic phase). A cry may be heard due to contraction of the chest muscles, followed by a shaking of the limbs in unison (<b>clonic</b> phase). Tonic seizures produce constant contractions of the muscles. A person often turns blue as breathing is stopped. In <b>clonic</b> seizures there is shaking of the limbs in unison. After the shaking has stopped it may take 10–30minutes for the person to return to normal; this period is called the [...] "postictal state" [...] or [...] "postictal phase." [...] Loss of bowel or bladder control may occur during a seizure. The tongue may be bitten at either the tip or on the sides during a seizure. In tonic-clonic seizure, bites to the sides are more common. Tongue bites are also relatively common in psychogenic non-epileptic seizures.|$|E
500|$|Upon consumption, both {{in humans}} and other species, the {{symptoms}} of poisoning are mainly characterized by generalized seizures. The onset of symptoms following ingestion may be as soon as 15 minutes post ingestion. Initial symptoms reported may include nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, tremors, confusion, weakness, dizziness, and drowsiness; although the rapid onset of seizure activity {{may be the first}} sign presented following poisoning. Seizures are usually described as <b>clonic</b> or tonic–clonic. Complications of ongoing seizure activity include increased body temperature, decreases in the pH of the blood (metabolic acidosis), swelling in the brain, blood coagulation disorders, muscle breakdown (rhabdomyolysis), and kidney failure. Additional neurological symptoms may include hallucinations, delirium, tingling, pricking, or numbness of a person's skin, dilated pupils, [...] and coma. Cardiovascular symptoms include alternating slow or fast heart rate and alternating low and high blood pressure. Other cardiac effects may include ECG abnormalities such as widening of the PR interval, supraventricular tachycardia, and ventricular fibrillation. Symptoms of excess salivation, wheezing, respiratory distress, and absence of breathing have also been reported.|$|E
2500|$|Zonisamide is a {{medication}} {{used to treat}} the symptoms of epilepsy and Parkinson's disease. Chemically it is a sulfonamide. It serves as an anticonvulsant used primarily as an [...] therapy in adults with Parkinson's disease, partial-onset seizures; infantile spasm, mixed seizure types of Lennox–Gastaut syndrome, myoclonic and generalized tonic <b>clonic</b> seizure. Despite this it is also sometimes used as a monotherapy for partial-onset seizures.|$|E
2500|$|A myoclonic seizure (myo [...] "muscle", <b>clonic</b> [...] "jerk") is {{a sudden}} {{involuntary}} contraction of muscle groups. The muscle jerks consist of symmetric, mostly generalized jerks, localized {{in the arms}} and in the shoulders and also simultaneously with a head nod; both the arms may fling out together and simultaneously a head nod may occur. Symptoms have some variability amongst subjects. Sometimes the entire body may jerk, just like a startle response. As {{is the case with}} all generalised seizures, the patient is not conscious during the event but the seizure is so brief that the person appears to remain fully conscious.|$|E
50|$|Because a major {{function}} of the temporal lobe is short-term memory, complex partial seizures and generalised tonic <b>clonic</b> seizures may cause amnesia {{for the period of}} the seizure. As a result, patients with temporal lobe complex partial seizures and generalised tonic <b>clonic</b> seizures may not remember having had a seizure.|$|E
5000|$|Tonic-clonic {{seizures}} (includes variations {{beginning with}} a <b>clonic</b> or myoclonic phase) ...|$|E
5000|$|Absence {{with mild}} <b>clonic</b> {{components}}. Here {{the onset of}} the attack is indistinguishable from the above, but <b>clonic</b> components may occur in the eyelids, {{at the corner of the}} mouth, or in other muscle groups which may vary in severity from almost imperceptible movements to generalised myoclonic jerks. Objects held in the hand may be dropped.|$|E
50|$|A tonic-clonic seizure {{comprises}} two phases, the tonic {{phase and}} the <b>clonic</b> phase.|$|E
5000|$|The {{most common}} ictal lateralizing sign was {{unilateral}} <b>clonic</b> activity in 56 percent ...|$|E
50|$|Generalized {{seizures}} can {{be either}} absence seizures, myoclonic seizures, <b>clonic</b> seizures, tonic-clonic seizures or atonic seizures.|$|E
5000|$|Obvious ictal motor {{activity}} {{was seen in}} 78 percent (Todd's paresis is more common after any <b>clonic</b> seizure activity) ...|$|E
50|$|Seizures which {{begin in}} the {{temporal}} lobe, and then spread to involve the whole brain are known as Secondarily Generalized Tonic-Clonic Seizures (SGTCS). The arms, trunk, and legs stiffen (the tonic phase), in either a flexed or extended position, and then jerk (the <b>clonic</b> phase). Secondarily generalized tonic <b>clonic</b> seizures are known in the vernacular as convulsions or grand mal seizures. The word grand mal comes from the French term, meaning major affliction.|$|E
50|$|He was {{diagnosed}} at age seventeen with Tonic <b>Clonic</b> epilepsy, the absurdities {{of which he}} often talks about in his comedy act.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Clonic</b> {{seizures}} are myoclonus {{that are}} regularly repeating {{at a rate}} typically of 2-3 per second. In some cases, the length varies.|$|E
5000|$|... 1957 Peganone {{was granted}} Food and Drug Administration (FDA) {{approval}} to Abbott Laboratories {{for treatment of}} grand mal (tonic <b>clonic)</b> and partial complex (psychomotor) seizures.|$|E
50|$|There are six main {{types of}} {{generalized}} seizures: tonic-clonic, tonic, <b>clonic,</b> myoclonic, absence, and atonic seizures. They all involve {{loss of consciousness}} and typically happen without warning.|$|E
50|$|There is some {{period of}} {{recovery}} in which neurological function is altered after each of these seizure types. This is the postictal state. The degree and length of postictal impairment directly correlates with {{the severity of the}} seizure type. Simple partial seizures often last less than sixty seconds; complex partial seizures may last up to two minutes; and generalized tonic <b>clonic</b> seizures may last up to three minutes. The postictal state in the case of complex partial seizures and generalised tonic <b>clonic</b> seizures may last much longer than the seizure itself.|$|E
50|$|This area {{does not}} seem to have many motor {{symptoms}} beyond tonic posturing or <b>clonic</b> movements. Contralateral or less commonly ipsilateral head turn and eye deviation are commonly associated with this area as well.|$|E
50|$|These {{movements}} {{most commonly}} {{are associated with}} electrographic seizures. They often involve 1 extremity or 1 side of the body. The rhythm of the <b>clonic</b> movements is usually slow, at 1-3 movements per second.|$|E
50|$|Noncongenital muscular torticollis {{may result}} from {{scarring}} or disease of cervical vertebrae, adenitis, tonsillitis, rheumatism, enlarged cervical glands, retropharyngeal abscess, or cerebellar tumors. It may be spasmodic (<b>clonic)</b> or permanent (tonic). The latter type {{may be due to}} Pott's Disease (tuberculosis of the spine).|$|E
50|$|Many of the {{symptoms}} associated with this area involve the head and digestive tract: swallowing, salivation, mastication and possibly gustatory hallucinations. Preceding the seizure the person is fearful and often has an epigastric aura. There is not much physical movement except <b>clonic</b> facial movements. Speech is often arrested.|$|E
5000|$|Tonic-clonic {{seizures}} involve {{an initial}} contraction {{of the muscles}} (tonic phase) which may involve tongue biting, urinary incontinence {{and the absence of}} breathing. This is followed by rhythmic muscle contractions (<b>clonic</b> phase). This type of seizure is usually what is referred to when the term 'epileptic fit' is used colloquially.|$|E
50|$|If a focal seizure spreads {{from one}} {{hemisphere}} {{to the other}} side of the brain, this will give rise to a secondarily generalised seizure. The person will become unconscious and may well have a tonic <b>clonic</b> seizure. When people have multiple focal seizures they generally have a condition known as temporal lobe epilepsy.|$|E
50|$|Intrahippocampal {{injection}} of 8 µg of cangitoxin in rats has strong behavioral effects, {{leading to a}}kinesia interchanging with facial automatisms and head tremor, salivation, rearing, jumping, barrel-rolling, wet dog shakes and forelimb <b>clonic</b> movements. In addition, convulsions occur which gradually increase in duration, leading to a status epilepticus. The electroencephalogram shows spike-and-wave, which is typically seen during epileptic convulsions.|$|E
50|$|In modern {{practice}} of ECT a therapeutic <b>clonic</b> seizure is induced by electric current via electrodes placed on an anaesthetised, unconscious patient. Despite much research the exact {{mechanism of action}} of ECT is still not known. ECT carries the risk of temporary cognitive deficits (e.g., confusion, memory problems), {{in addition to the}} burden of repeated exposures to general anesthesia.|$|E
50|$|Seizure {{types are}} {{organized}} by whether {{the source of}} the seizure is localized (focal seizures) or distributed (generalized seizures) within the brain. Generalized seizures are divided according to the effect on the body and include tonic-clonic (grand mal), absence (petit mal), myoclonic, <b>clonic,</b> tonic, and atonic seizures. Some seizures such as epileptic spasms are of an unknown type.|$|E
50|$|The {{outcome is}} {{unfavorable}} if generalized tonic-clonic, tonic, or <b>clonic</b> seizures {{appear at the}} onset or occur frequently during the course. Generalized tonic-clonic seizures usually occur during the daytime in this disorder, {{at least in the}} early stages. Nocturnal generalized tonic-clonic seizures, which may develop later, are another unfavorable sign. If tonic seizures appear, prognosis is poor.|$|E
50|$|Clinical {{signs of}} PEM are {{variable}} {{depending on the}} area of the cerebral cortex affected and may include head pressing, dullness, opisthotonos, central blindness, anorexia, muscle tremors, teeth grinding, trismus, salivation, drooling, convulsions, nystagmus, <b>clonic</b> convulsions, and recumbency. Early administration of thiamine may be curative, but if the lesion is more advanced, then surviving animals may remain partially blind and mentally dull.|$|E
