5|$|Written by William Emms. Planned as {{the fourth}} serial of Series 4, The Imps was a four-part story {{concerned}} about a spaceship overrun by Imp-like aliens and aggressive alien vegetation. The script was commissioned on 17 October 1966, and soon had to be rewritten to accommodate new companion Jamie. However, due to sickness {{on the part of}} Emms, this took so long that further rewrites were needed to explain the loss of Ben and Polly and on 4 January 1967 the story was dropped. Emms reused elements of the story in Mission to Venus, a <b>Choose</b> <b>Your</b> Own Adventure-style story featuring the Sixth Doctor.|$|E

500|$|According to Nite, the game's writing style owes {{itself to}} a humorous email {{exchange}} between himself and Johnson that began when the two separated after high school.

500|$|Unlike the {{generally}} positive reviews received by Mulan, critical reception towards the character's romantic relationship with Li Shang {{has been largely}} negative, drawing much speculation from critics who accused Mulan of having [...] "a typical girl-hooks-up-with-boy ending." [...] Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times observed, [...] "The message here is standard feminist empowerment: Defy the matchmaker, dress as a boy, and <b>choose</b> <b>your</b> own career. But Mulan has it both ways, since inevitably Mulan's heart goes pitty-pat over Shang, the handsome young captain she's assigned to serve under. The movie breaks with the tradition in which the male hero rescues the heroine, but is still totally sold on the Western idea of romantic love." [...] The New York Times' Janet Maslin negatively opined, [...] "For all of Mulan's courage and independence in rebelling against the matchmakers, this is still enough of a fairy tale to need Mr. Right." ...|$|E

500|$|... "Boys and Girls" [...] was {{directed}} by Dennie Gordon; {{it was written by}} B. J. Novak, who plays Ryan Howard on the show. The genesis for the episode came from cast members Angela Kinsey and Jenna Fischer. The two originally formulated an idea while spending time together on the set of The Office: [...] "What if Jan came into the office and did a 'Women in the Workplace' seminar, and Michael got all jealous?" [...] They presented their idea to executive producer Greg Daniels, who liked the idea. Daniels subsequently assigned the idea to Novak, who crafted the final episode. Pam's monologue on reading about a girl who lived in a house with a terrace was based on a real book from the <b>Choose</b> <b>Your</b> Own Adventure series, although not specifically identified as such in the episode read by Jenna Fischer when she was a child. When the show's cast and crew appeared at the Paley Center, Fischer related that Novak asked her if she had any personal stories that could relate to what Pam was feeling at the time the episode was being written. She then came up with the storybook idea, which was immediately written and filmed for the episode.|$|E
500|$|In September 2015, Mark Ruffalo, {{who plays}} Bruce Banner / Hulk in the MCU films, stated that his {{character}} was originally in the Civil War script, but was removed {{due to the}} end of Age of Ultron, as Marvel did not [...] "want to reveal where [...] and why" [...] in this film. Markus added that as soon as the Hulk joined a side, the fight would be quickly over, saying, [...] "You've got to kind of <b>choose</b> <b>your</b> roster [...] depending on what kind of fight you want to have." [...] He later explained that he contemplated having the Hulk appear {{at the very end of}} the film, but decided against it, feeling that he was over-stuffing the film with characters, adding, [...] " [...] has clearly gone somewhere at the end of [...] Ultron, and that's a story. Don't blow it off and put it in a little tiny chunk just to put in a little extra filigree on our movie." [...] Additionally, Ross' alter ego, Red Hulk, was also considered for inclusion, but the Russos felt that part of the character would need a proper backstory which they could not afford to give in the already crowded film. They felt that Ross [...] "was there sort of as the government's agenda and not to add another complicated super powered character to the mix." [...] Spider-Man's Iron Spider suit was also considered.|$|E
500|$|While {{writing the}} scene with Meredith and Shepherd fighting, Rater {{explained}} that she was intending to show how they matured, adding: [...] "This is a real grown-up argument. Meredith isn't running away, getting all dark and going to Cristina for help getting out of her marriage. She's staying and fighting." [...] While writing the episode, writers intended {{the theme of the}} episode to be [...] "exposure", but after the episode was filmed, realized it was [...] "ambition". Rater commented on this: [...] "Derek wants to be Chief; Meredith wants to do a procedure that she knows she isn’t ready for; Cristina wants Teddy to stay." [...] In the episode, Oh's character asked her fellow residents if they would choose love or surgery, if need be, with Stevens choosing love and Yang and Meredith choosing surgery. The Grey Anatomy staff offered the insight: [...] "When we were first discussing this story we had a knock down drag out fight in the writers' room – if you had to <b>choose</b> <b>your</b> love or your art, which would you choose? And some of us came down on the Cristina side, and some of us came down on the Izzie side – that in the end love is all that matters." [...] At the conclusion of the episode, Karev ended his marriage to Stevens. Rater expressed that the writers decided to have the fictional couple break-up, because Stevens wasn't sick anymore, and Karev would not have left her when she was.|$|E
