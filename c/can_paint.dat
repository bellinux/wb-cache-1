5|$|Kuhn {{denied that}} it is ever {{possible}} to isolate the hypothesis being tested from {{the influence of the}} theory in which the observations are grounded, and he argued {{that it is}} not possible to evaluate competing paradigms independently. More than one logically consistent construct <b>can</b> <b>paint</b> a usable likeness of the world, but there is no common ground from which to pit two against each other, theory against theory. Each paradigm has its own distinct questions, aims, and interpretations. Neither provides a standard by which the other can be judged, so there is no clear way to measure scientific progress across paradigms.|$|E
25|$|Jean-Pierre Rives met {{his first}} wife, an American model and singer/songwriter Jennifer Taylor, in Paris, {{in the early}} 1980s. The {{marriage}} ended in a divorce. He has since remarried and fathered two sons – Jasper and Kino-Jean. Rives and his wife, Sonia, split their time between Ibiza and St-Tropez, where {{they live in a}} wooden family home that resembles a tree house. The property is located near a local golf course and includes a luscious garden, with a bamboo grove, mimosa bushes, and lemon and fig trees. He loves life on the Mediterranean, where he <b>can</b> <b>paint</b> and sculpt in peace and solitude.|$|E
25|$|Anderson throws four pitches for strikes: a fastball, a curve, a changeup and a slider. His fastball {{sits in the}} 89-92mph {{range and}} he offers a two-seam variety in {{addition}} to the traditional four-seam version. His best pitch is the slider, a two-plane breaking ball he <b>can</b> <b>paint</b> on the corner versus right-handed batters and sweep away from lefties in the 79-81mph range. His low-to-mid 70s curveball is a weapon in any count and his 82-84mph changeup has shown the most improvement as Anderson has fought his way through injuries. Over the course of his career, Anderson's arm slot has lowered slightly, dropping from high three-quarters to true three-quarters. He's athletic and repeats his mechanics, aiding in his ability to command his entire arsenal.|$|E

25|$|On Tatooine, {{there is}} a droid factory that the Galactic Empire has set up, So the {{rebellion}} sends C-3PO and R2-D2 and you, a rebel agent disguised as a Jawa to complete missions leading to the secret droid factory and to reprogram the evil droid army, but first, you must win the trust of your fellow Jawas. To proceed to the droid factory, the player must complete eight training missions and four top-secret missions with task-specific requirements, Such as 'Droid must be magnetic, Droid {{must be able to}} see in the dark, or Droid must weigh less than 100 kilograms. This allows you to complete the mission. Through experiential learning, players learn about and apply the scientific principles of energy, force, light, engineering, and magnetism. In addition, the game encourages players to apply math, logic, and critical thinking skills. The game contains 87 droid parts which can be combined in 25 million different combinations for manufacturing. In the Jawa Droid Workshop, players <b>can</b> <b>paint</b> and name their creations, and make them dance, while a holographic design grid lets players have a 360 degree view of their work in progress. In in-game InDex provided players with encyclopedic explanations on the science used in the game to help players; it could also link to the internet for access to further links.|$|E

[...] "When I say that every major distributor turned it down, this is not an exaggeration", remembers Krantz. [...] "There has never been a project that was received with less enthusiasm. Animation is essentially a dirty word for distributors, who think that only Disney <b>can</b> <b>paint</b> a tree, and in addition to that, Fritz was so far out that there was a failure to understand that we were onto something very important." ...|$|E
2500|$|The 19th century {{brought a}} {{resurgence}} of enthusiasm for Poussin. One of his greatest admirers was Ingres, who studied in Rome and became Director of the French Academy there. Ingres wrote, [...] "Only great painters of history <b>can</b> <b>paint</b> a beautiful landscape. He (Poussin) was the first, and only, to capture the nature of Italy. By the character and taste of his compositions, he proved that such nature belonged to him; {{so much so that}} when facing a beautiful site, one says, and says correctly, that it is [...] "Poussinesque".|$|E
2500|$|Gainsborough's {{enthusiasm for}} landscapes {{is shown in}} the way he merged figures of the portraits with the scenes behind them. He said, [...] "I'm sick of portraits, and wish very much to take my viol-da-gam and walk off to some sweet village, where I <b>can</b> <b>paint</b> landskips (sic) and enjoy the fag end of life in {{quietness}} and ease." [...] His landscapes were often painted at night by candlelight, using a tabletop arrangement of stones, pieces of mirrors, broccoli, and the like as a model. His later work was characterised by a light palette and easy, economical strokes.|$|E

2500|$|Lexington is {{the largest}} and most wealthy town in Kentucky, or indeed west of the Allegheny Mountains; the main street of Lexington has all the {{appearance}} of Market Street in Philadelphia on a busy day... I would suppose it contains about five hundred dwelling houses , many of them elegant and three stories high. About thirty brick buildings were then raising, and I have little doubt but that in a few years it will rival, not only in wealth, but in population, the most populous inland town of the United States... The country around Lexington for many miles in every direction, is equal in beauty and fertility to anything the imagination <b>can</b> <b>paint</b> and is already in a high state of cultivation.Residents have fondly continued to refer to Lexington as [...] "The Athens of the West" [...] since Espy's poem dedicated to the city.|$|E

Islington London Borough Council gave Rosy Wilde an additional month's grace to pay the outstanding debts after they {{had heard of the}} Saatchi's purchase. Vine was [...] "bombarded" [...] with phone calls from galleries wanting to show her work and from art collectors seeking {{to cash in on the}} [...] "Saatchi effect"; within a week she had sold six paintings.

2500|$|The [...] "Pepsi Can" [...] {{paint scheme}} was used on Amtrak Dash 8-32BWH diesel locomotives. The Pepsi <b>Can</b> <b>paint</b> scheme is a {{spin-off}} {{from the standard}} Phase III. On {{the front of the}} engine, the red, white and blue stripes run across the side of the locomotive much like Phase III, except they are wider and spread much more apart. Close {{to the rear of the}} engine, the red and blue stripes make a [...] "turn" [...] and go up the side of the engine after crossing over each other. Because of the Dash 8-32BWH's shape and the paint scheme, the nickname [...] "Pepsi-Can" [...] was given to the engines. Even though the engines have been converted over to Phase IV and V paint, the nickname is still used by many in different variations, such as 'Diet Pepsi' for Phase IV and 'Crystal Pepsi' for Phase V.|$|E

[...] By July 18 he was able to write that he had regained his abilities with the exception of tying [...] "my neck tie in the way that I have done for the past 20 years....Every four or five days I try to do it but....it has been of no use." [...] Although he never completely recovered, Homer was well enough to attempt a major work, and it is probably Right and Left that he referred to {{in a letter to his}} brother Charles dated December 8, 1908: [...] "I am painting when it is light enough on a most surprising picture".|$|E
2500|$|GIMP {{selection}} tools {{include a}} rectangular and circular selection tool, free select tool, and fuzzy select tool (also known as magic wand). More advanced selection tools include the select by color tool for selecting contiguous regions of color—and the scissors select tool, which creates selections semi-automatically between areas of highly contrasting colors. GIMP also supports a quick mask mode where a user {{can use a}} brush to paint the area of a selection. [...] Visibly {{this looks like a}} red colored overlay being added or removed. The foreground select tool is an implementation of Simple Interactive Object Extraction (SIOX) a method used to perform the extraction of foreground elements, such as a person or a tree in focus. The Paths Tool allows a user to create vectors (also known as Bézier curves). Users can use paths to create complex selections, including around natural curves. They <b>can</b> <b>paint</b> (or [...] "stroke") the paths with brushes, patterns, or various line styles. Users can name and save paths for reuse.|$|E
