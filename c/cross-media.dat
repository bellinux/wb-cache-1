5|$|A new {{generation}} of more entertainment-oriented movies coming from the Somali film industry has grown increasingly popular among Somalis both within Somalia and in the diaspora. Referred to as Somaliwood, this upstart cinematic movement has energized the local movie scene, in the process introducing innovative storylines, production techniques and advertising strategies. The latter include <b>cross-media</b> marketing, with tie-in film soundtracks featuring prominent Somali music artists. Popular movies from Somaliwood include the Somali language slasher thriller Xaaskayga Araweelo, the action comedy Rajo, and Warmooge, the first Somali animated film. The young directors Abdisalam Aato of Olol Films and Abdi Malik Isak are {{at the forefront of}} this quiet revolution. In 2010, the Somali director Mo Ali also released Shank, his first feature film set in a futuristic London.|$|E
25|$|In {{the late}} 1980s, STW-9 Perth, {{which opened in}} 1965, became a Nine Network owned-and-operated station when Bond Media {{purchased}} the network. However, in 1989, Bond Media sold the Perth-based station to Sunraysia Television for A$95 million, due to the federal <b>cross-media</b> ownership laws which restricted the level of national reach for media owners.|$|E
25|$|Like Murdoch, Packer's critics saw his ever-expanding <b>cross-media</b> {{holdings}} as {{a potential}} threat to media diversity and freedom of speech. He also repeatedly came under fire for his companies' alleged involvement in tax evasion schemes and for the extremely low amounts of company tax that his corporations are reported to have paid over the years. He fought repeated battles with the Australian Taxation Office over his corporate taxes.|$|E
25|$|Albury/Wodonga is one radio market, thus {{advertisements}} {{are directed}} {{to both sides}} of the border. The Albury/Wodonga market underwent significant change in 2005 when Macquarie Southern Cross Media bought 105.7 The River from RG Capital Radio Network, and 2AY and Star FM from the DMG Radio Australia. Due to <b>cross-media</b> ownership laws preventing the ownership of more than two stations in one market, Macquarie was required to sell one of these stations and in September 2005 sold 2AY to the Ace Radio network. 2AY takes its night time programming from 2UE Sydney.|$|E
25|$|Continuing their {{partnership}} from Fast Five, the Facebook game Car Town by Cie Games and {{the theater}} chain Regal Entertainment Group (REG) collaborated with Universal in a <b>cross-media</b> marketing promotion.

25|$|<b>Cross-media</b> {{ownership}} laws {{introduced in}} 1987 forced Fairfax {{to choose between}} its print and television operations – it chose the former, and later sold off its stations to Qintex Ltd., owned by businessman Christopher Skase. Qintex had previously bought, and subsequently sold off, stations in Brisbane and regional Queensland before {{taking control of the}} network. The next year, another new logo was introduced along with evening soap Home and Away and a relaunched Seven Nightly News, now known as Seven News. The network became truly national in 1988 when Skase bought TVW-7 for $130million. In 1989, the network changed its name to simply the Seven Network, though it had been unofficially using that name for some time before then.|$|E

2500|$|Like for {{business}} companies in general, for media enterprises their core assets and core competencies are decisive {{for the long-term}} success. Core competencies considerably contribute to the perceived customer benefit of a product and ensure the competitive advantage of an enterprise. Competencies which are crucial to successful media management can be classified as technical skills, human skills, conceptual skills, financial skills and marketing skills. Core competencies of media enterprises are, for example, an exceptional editorial ability or <b>cross-media</b> marketing competence. [...] There are six subgroups of core competencies of media enterprises: content-sourcing competence, content-creation competence, product development competence, promotion competence, <b>cross-media</b> utilization competence and technology competence.|$|E

2500|$|Anticipating fan {{interest}} {{and trying to}} keep its audience engrossed, ABC embarked on various <b>cross-media</b> endeavors, often using new media.

2500|$|These changes {{led to a}} {{significant}} concentration of <b>cross-media</b> ownership. By 1960, the Packer family's Consolidated Press group controlled Channels 9 in Melbourne and Sydney (the flagship stations that {{formed the basis of}} the Nine Network), Melbourne's Herald and Weekly Times group owned HSV-7, and the Fairfax newspaper group controlled ATN-7 in Sydney. In the view of some media historians, these arrangements established a pattern of [...] "high-level political allegiances between commercial broadcasters and Liberal-National Party governments" [...] and that, as a result, the [...] ABCB [...] "was left very weak and uncertain in its capacity to control broadcaster conduct and exhibited strong symptoms of regulatory capture, or over-identification with the industry it regulated".|$|E
2500|$|In 1965, Lynchburg Broadcasting {{sold the}} WLVA {{stations}} to the Washington Star Company, which also owned WMAL-AM-FM-TV in Washington. Joe Allbritton purchased a controlling {{interest in the}} Star in 1975. By this time, however, the FCC had tightened its rules on <b>cross-media</b> ownership. Due to {{the manner in which}} Allbritton's purchase of the Star Company was structured, the FCC considered it to be an ownership change. It told Allbritton that he had to sell off either the radio or television stations. Allbritton chose to sell off the company's non-television assets, including WLVA radio, in April 1977. In September 1977 WLVA-TV changed its call letters to the current WSET-TV to coincide with its new branding, [...] "NeWSET-13." [...] The television stations became Allbritton Communications.|$|E
2500|$|The content-sourcing {{competence}} means {{acquisition of}} high-quality information and/or entertainment content for content production. Especially {{the production of}} exclusive content leads to unique competitive advantage. Content-creation competence {{is one of the}} most important core competences in most media enterprises. Media enterprises with content-creation competences are, for example, especially good at realizing social trends and implementing them into their media products, making them highly attractive for the customers. The product development competence is the qualification for a product portfolio with a steady flow of revenues.In order to achieve this, media enterprises have to be able to develop promising media products and to assess their marketability. The promotion competence is specifically relevant for media products belonging to the film, book or music categories as these are individual products. Here a different promotion strategy than promotion of brand identity is needed. Achieving public attention and thus a better market position for media products constitutes the promotion competence. [...] Media enterprises with <b>cross-media</b> utilization competences can provide content to the recipients in a timely manner, in the desired amount and via the right channel. Finally the technology competence refers to the employment of modern information and communication technology for the creation and marketing of content.|$|E

50|$|Murdoch's {{desire for}} {{dominant}} <b>cross-media</b> ownership manifested in early 1961 {{when he bought}} an ailing Australian record label, Festival Records, {{and within a few}} years it had become the leading local recording company. He also bought a television station in Wollongong, New South Wales, hoping to use it to break into the Sydney television market, but found himself frustrated by Australia's <b>cross-media</b> ownership laws, which prevented him from owning both a major newspaper and television station in the same city. Since then he has consistently lobbied, both personally and through his papers, to have these laws changed in his favour. This occurred in 2006 when the Liberal-National Coalition Government, having gained control of both houses of the Australian Parliament, introduced reforms to <b>cross-media</b> ownership and foreign media ownership laws.
