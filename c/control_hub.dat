2500|$|Held between 30 June–29 July 2006, Rim of the Pacific Exercise 2006 (RIMPAC 2006) was {{the twentieth}} {{in a series}} of {{multilateral}} maritime exercises conducted biennially since 1971. It involved naval forces from the Royal Australian Navy, the Canadian Forces Maritime Command, the Chilean Navy, the Peruvian Navy, the Japanese JMSDF, the Republic of Korea Navy, and the Royal Navy. RIMPAC training operations also included the participation of 35 ships, more than 60 aircraft and 18,000 Sailors, Airmen, Marines, Soldiers, and Coast Guardsmen of the U.S. Armed Forces. During the exercise, the carrier Lincoln served as the command and <b>control</b> <b>hub</b> for the multi-national task force (pictured). [...] Destroyer Squadron 9 and helicopter squadrons HS-2 and HSL-47 of conducted anti-submarine warfare and anti-surface warfare training. [...] Carrier Air Wing Two fixed-wing aircraft provided combat air patrol support for the multi-national fleet operation off Guam. The multi-nation task force also participated in four separate sinking exercises involving decommissioned U.S. naval vessels. On 9 July, the carrier Abraham Lincoln hosted a four-member delegation from the Australian Parliament who visited various parts of the ship, including medical spaces, the mess decks and the flight deck. On 29 July, more than 1,000 guests including sailors from each of the participating countries joined a pierside reception on board the Abraham Lincoln as she sailed from Naval Station Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, after the final weekend of RIMPAC 06.|$|E

Here we use novel network analysis algorithms to test the recruitment and integration of large-scale functional neural circuitry during learning. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data acquired from healthy human participants, from initial training through mastery of a simple motor skill, we investigate changes in the architecture of functional connectivity patterns that promote learning. Our results reveal that learning induces an autonomy of sensorimotor systems and that the release of cognitive <b>control</b> <b>hubs</b> in frontal and cingulate cortices predicts individual differences in the rate of learning on other days of practice. Our general statistical approach is applicable across other cognitive domains and provides a key to understanding time-resolved interactions between distributed neural circuits that enable task performance.

40|$|Dermal {{papillae}} (DPs) {{control the}} formation of hair shafts. In clinical settings, colchicine (CLC) induces patients’ hair shedding. Compared to the control, the ex vivo hair fiber elongation of organ cultured vibrissa hair follicles (HFs) declined significantly after seven days of CLC treatment. The cultured DP cells (DPCs) were used as the experimental model to study the influence of CLC on the protein dynamics of DPs. CLC could alter the morphology and down-regulate the expression of alkaline phosphatase (ALP), the marker of DPC activity, and induce IκBα phosphorylation of DPCs. The proteomic results showed that CLC modulated the expression patterns (fold > 2) of 24 identified proteins, seven down-regulated and 17 up-regulated. Most of these proteins were presumably associated with protein turnover, metabolism, structure and signal transduction. Protein-protein interactions (PPI) among these proteins, established by Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes/Proteins (STRING) database, revealed that they participate in protein metabolic process, translation, and energy production. Furthermore, ubiquitin C (UbC) was predicted to be the <b>controlling</b> <b>hub,</b> suggesting the involvement of ubiquitin-proteasome system in modulating the pathogenic effect of CLC on DPC...|$|R

40|$|In many {{instances}} of election, the electorate {{appears to be}} a composite of partisan and independent voters. Given that partisans are not likely to convert to a different party, a main goal for a party could be to mobilize independent voters toward the party with the help of strong leadership, mass media, partisans, and effects of peer-to-peer influence. Based on the exact solution of the classical voter model dynamics in the presence of perfectly partisan voters (i. e., zealots), we propose a computational method to maximize the share of the party in a social network of independent voters by pinning control strategy. The party, corresponding to the controller or zealots, optimizes the nodes to be controlled given the information about the connectivity of independent voters and the set of nodes that the opponent party controls. We show that <b>controlling</b> <b>hubs</b> is generally a good strategy, whereas the optimized strategy is even better. The superiority of the optimized strategy is particularly eminent when the independent voters are connected as directed rather than undirected networks. Comment: 7 figures, 1 tabl...|$|R

40|$|The serine {{threonine}} (ser/thr) protein kinase, Akt, is at {{the central}} hub of signaling pathways that regulates cell growth, differentiation and survival. The reciprocal relation that exists between the two activating phosphorylation sites of Akt, T 308 and S 473, and the two mTOR complexes, C 1 and C 2, forms the central <b>controlling</b> <b>hub</b> that regulates these cellular functions. In our previous review &# 39;PI 3 K-AKT-mTOR and Wnt signaling pathways in cell cycle&# 39; we discussed the reciprocal relation between mTORC 1 and C 2 complexes in regulating cell metabolism and cell cycle progression in cancer cells. We present in this article, a hypothesis that activation of Akt T 308 phosphorylation {{in the presence of}} high ATP: AMP ratio promotes the stability of its phosphorylations and activates mTORC 1 and the energy consuming biosynthetic processes. Depletion of energy leads to inactivation of mTORC 1, activation of AMPK, FoxO, and promotes constitution of mTORC 2 that leads to phosphorylation of Akt S 473. Akt can also be activated independent of PI 3 K; this appears to have an advantage under situations like dietary restrictions, where IIS could be a casualty...|$|R
