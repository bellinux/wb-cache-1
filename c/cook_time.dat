40|$|The present work {{aimed to}} study {{sugarcane}} bagasse fibers pre-treated with fungi and using NaOH/ anthraquinone (AQ) in chemical pulping processes for applications in composite materials. Bagasse was decayed with 250 mg of Ceriporiopsis subvermispora inoculum in a 20 L bioreactor. After that, samples were submitted to similar conditions of decaying without inoculum charge. Decayed and undecayed fibers {{were treated with}} NaOH 12. 5 wt%, 0. 15 of AQ and a 12 : 1 (v/w) liquor:bagasse ratio at 160 °C. Then, all obtained fibers were characterized according to their chemical composition. Dried biotreated (decayed) and control (undecayed) fibers were mixed through an extruder process with polypropylene. Later, composite granulates were injected directly in mold with cavities for tensile, flexural and shear tests. Composite materials with 10 and 20 wt% fibers were submitted to static mechanical standard tests and DMA (Dynamic Mechanical Analysis) to evaluate the effect of biotreatment. Biotreatment, <b>cook</b> <b>time</b> (pulping), and fiber content contributed to improvements in the mechanical properties of the composites. The interface between fiber and matrix was increased with the biotreatment and pulping of fibers. Furthermore, DMA results also showed that fiber incorporation into PP improved the modulus, mainly for biotreated fibers/PP composites. The Tg (tan &# 948; data) from composites was dislocated at lower temperatures with respect to neat PP due {{to the influence of}} fibers on matrix...|$|E

40|$|INTRODUCTION - Cooking {{time and}} sensory quality are two {{important}} traits when selecting dry beans for consumption, but {{have largely been}} overlooked by breeders in favor of yield and other traits. Dry beans are an affordable, nutrient-rich food, but often require long cooking times, particularly without prior soaking. They also display a range of sensory characteristics, with consumers preferring cooked beans that are sweet and soft 1. Increased interest in dry beans to make new products necessitates studies assessing the diversity of sensory traits in beans, which would allow beans to be selected for specific products. In this study, the Andean Diversity Panel 2 (ADP) was assessed for cooking time and sensory characteristics {{in order to identify}} diversity for these traits. MATERIALS AND METHODS - Cooking Time Evaluation: 398 genotypes of the ADP were harvested in Hawassa, Ethiopia in 2015, six months prior to evaluation. Prior to cooking, each sample was soaked for 12 hours in 250 ml distilled water after ensuring moisture content was between 10 - 14 %. Two replicates per genotype of 25 seeds each were cooked in random order in boiling distilled water using the Mattson cooker method for determining cooking time 3. The Mattson cooker uses twentyfive 85 g stainless steel rods with 2 mm diameter pins that pierce beans loaded in wells when sufficiently cooked. For this study, the 50 % and 80 % cooking times were recorded, and the 80 % <b>cook</b> <b>time</b> is regarded as the time required to cook each genotype to completion. The cooking time data was analyzed using the MIXED procedure in SAS with genotype as a fixed effect and rep as a random effect...|$|E
40|$|Toxicological {{studies show}} that oral doses of nickel can cause {{allergic}} contact dermatitis, and routes of exposure, such as nickel leached from stainless steel cookware are not well characterized. In this study, four variables: grade of stainless steel, <b>cook</b> <b>time,</b> stainless steel seasoning or cooking cycles, and commercial tomato sauces, were tested to for their effect on nickel leaching and their possible effects on human health. Two grades of stainless steel, two, six, and 20 hour cooking times, ten cooking cycles, and four commercially obtained tomato sauces were tested. The stainless steel grades tested were equivalent to those typically found in cookware (grade 316 and 304). We found after a single cooking cycle of six hours, depending on grade of stainless steel, nickel concentrations increased 30 to 60 fold. Increased cook times of 20 hours resulted in additional nickel leaching, about 70 fold higher than tomato sauce cooked {{in the absence of}} stainless steel. The first cooking cycle resulted in the largest increase in nickel concentration at 5. 8 mg/kg. However, with sequential cooking cycles, the total amount of nickel leached was less than in the first cycle. There was no change in the amount of nickel leached between the sixth and tenth cooking cycle. Nickel was still leaching into tomato sauce after 10 cooking cycles about 10 fold higher than the original tomato sauce. After 10 cooking cycles, each six hours in duration, an average of 88 μg of nickel was leached per 126 g serving of tomato sauce. In addition to dietary intakes, stainless steel can be an overlooked source of nickel, and the amount of additional exposure is dependent on stainless steel grade, cooking time, and repeated usage...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the effects of non-meat ingredients, blade tenderization and vacuum-tumbling on the textural, visual and sensory characteristics of steaks from Biceps femoris, Supraspinatus, Triceps brachii long head, and Longissimus dorsi muscles packaged in high oxygen, modified atomosphere (MAP) system. United Department of Agriculture (USDA) Select muscles (n= 72) from each cut were obtained from a commercial processor over three processing days. Muscles were aged for five days at 4 ?C. Denuded muscles within a processing day were randomly assigned to one of 24 treatments. This study was a 2 x 4 x 3 factorial arrangement where treatments were control, injection (injected or non-injected), blade tenderization (0, 1, or 2 passes) and vacuum-tumbling (0, 5, 10 or 20 minutes). Injected muscles contained up to 10 % of a brine containing 1. 55 % potassium lactate, 0. 1 % sodium diacetate, 0. 3 % sodium tripolyphosphate blend and 0. 4 % salt in the final product. Muscles were vacuumtumbled and blade tenderized sequentially after injection. Steaks from the muscles were stored in a high oxygen (80 % O 2, 20 % CO 2) MAP system for 0, 3, 7, 10 and 14 days at 2 ?C. Steaks were evaluated for package purge (%), Warner-Bratzler shear force (kg), cook loss (%), <b>cook</b> <b>time</b> (min), pH, CIE L* a* b* color space values and trained color panel scores on each storage day. A trained descriptive attribute sensory panel evaluated steaks on day 1 only. Warner-Bratzler shear force (P< 0. 01) and trained sensory panel results (P< 0. 05) showed that the addition of non-meat ingredients improved tenderness in all four muscles. Sensory detectable connective tissue was lower (P< 0. 01) in injected steaks for all muscles except in Biceps femoris steaks. Injected steaks had higher pH (P< 0. 01) measurements than non-injected treatments in all muscles except the Triceps brachii long head. Neither blade tenderization nor vacuum-tumbling had consistent effects in all four muscles. Vacuum-tumbled Biceps femoris steaks had lower bitter flavor aromatics (P< 0. 05). In conclusion, enhancing beef with non-meat ingredients had the greatest impact on the quality attributes of high connective tissue cuts and Longissimus dorsi steaks...|$|E
