5|$|Any counterattack or {{relief effort}} <b>contemplated</b> by the South Vietnamese was doomed by the {{thousands}} of refugees that took to the roads in order to escape the fighting. Desertion among South Vietnamese units became common, as soldiers began disappearing from the ranks in search of family members. This pattern was to become too common as the offensive continued, not just among the territorial forces, but among the regular troops.|$|E
5|$|Coming off {{his fourth}} championship, the 34-year-old Niedermayer <b>contemplated</b> retirement. Remaining {{undecided}} on his future as the 2007–08 season began, {{he failed to}} report to the team and was suspended by the Ducks as a formality. Pronger replaced him as captain, and Niedermayer remained undecided until early December when he finally chose to return. He appeared in only 48 games that season, scoring 25 points, but played in his fourth All-Star Game.|$|E

In 1896, with Post-Impressionist artists Constantin Artachino, Ștefan Luchian and Nicolae Vermont, he founded Salonul Independenților, the Romanian replica of the French Société des Artistes Indépendants.

5|$|Frustrated {{by what he}} {{felt was}} too much individualism in the game, Schriner <b>contemplated</b> {{retiring}} from professional hockey in favour of taking up a coaching position in Alberta's senior league. He {{had a change of}} heart and returned to the Leafs for the 1942–43 NHL season. Schriner again announced his intention to leave the game in June 1943, this time citing past injuries to his knee and dissatisfaction with Leafs' owner Conn Smythe's contract offer for the following season.|$|E
5|$|Hamilton's {{resignation}} as Secretary of the Treasury in 1795 did {{not remove}} him from public life. With the resumption of his law practice, he remained close to Washington as an advisor and friend. Hamilton influenced Washington {{in the composition of}} his Farewell Address by writing drafts for Washington to compare with the latter's draft, although when Washington <b>contemplated</b> retirement in 1792, he had consulted James Madison for a draft that was used in a similar manner to Hamilton's.|$|E
5|$|Important {{elements}} of traditional Scouting have their origins in Baden-Powell's experiences {{in education and}} military training. He was a 50-year-old retired army general when he founded Scouting, and his revolutionary ideas inspired thousands of young people, {{from all parts of}} society, to get involved in activities that most had never <b>contemplated.</b> Comparable organizations in the English-speaking world are the Boys' Brigade and the non-militaristic Woodcraft Folk; however, they never matched the development and growth of Scouting.|$|E

5|$|In Sweden, as of 2007 {{there are}} ten {{operating}} nuclear reactors that produce about 45% of its electricity. Two other reactors in Barsebäck {{were shut down}} in 1999 and 2005. When these reactors were built, it was expected their nuclear fuel would be reprocessed in a foreign country, and the reprocessing waste would not be returned to Sweden. Later, construction of a domestic reprocessing plant was <b>contemplated,</b> but has not been built.|$|E
5|$|In late 1933, he was {{employed}} at the Sheba Gold Mine at Baberton. He enjoyed the work {{so much he}} <b>contemplated</b> studying for a mining degree.

Consequently, Pattle changed his mind about engineering and opted to find a career as a pilot.|$|E
5|$|In {{spite of}} their rivalry, the two sides {{previously}} <b>contemplated</b> ground-sharing {{as part of the}} SFA's unsuccessful bid to host Euro 2008.

The order would have consisted of 130 cars, valued at , {{to be built}} by a consortium of Bombardier Transportation and the Urban Transportation Development Corporation. Via tested several Amtrak Superliners in revenue service between Edmonton and Winnipeg in 1984–85. Ultimately Via chose to rebuild its Budd cars to use HEP instead of ordering new equipment.|$|E
5|$|King's {{stance on}} Vietnam {{encouraged}} Allard K. Lowenstein, William Sloane Coffin and Norman Thomas, {{with the support}} of anti-war Democrats, to attempt to persuade King to run against President Johnson in the 1968 United States presidential election.

5|$|Nelson visited France in late 1783, {{stayed with}} acquaintances at Saint-Omer, and briefly {{attempted}} to learn French.

5000|$|Before eating, {{residents}} recite {{and reflect}} on five contemplations {{to remind us of}} our motivation for eating:“I <b>contemplate</b> all the causes and conditions and the kindness of others by which I have received this food.I <b>contemplate</b> my own practice, constantly trying to improve it.I <b>contemplate</b> my mind, cautiously guarding it from wrongdoing, greed, and other defilements.I <b>contemplate</b> this food, treating it as wondrous medicine to nourish my body.I <b>contemplate</b> the aim of Buddhahood, accepting and consuming this food in order to accomplish it.”The food is then offered to the Three Jewels before eating. Like breakfast, the meal is eaten until silence until a gong is rang halfway through, to reflect on the five contemplations and that day’s teachings. Lunch is the main meal, as many monastics do not eat in the evening. The Abbey is vegetarian and, following the monastic precepts of the Chinese tradition, avoids onions, garlic, leeks, and radishes. Community members take turns cooking. Guests are welcomed to help too.|$|R

50|$|In {{light of}} this for Sartre, the {{constitution}} of the ego is 'states and actions intended objects we speak of it supports'. This is to say that the material presence of things in turn proves the ontology of the object <b>contemplating</b> them. Ego is then nothing without something in which to <b>contemplate</b> but is reliant on itself and its being. Further, the flexibility of consciousness for Sartre is the ability to <b>contemplate</b> something in its absence, this being special for his idea of reflection.|$|R
5|$|Rundgren <b>contemplated</b> {{recording}} more {{tracks to}} make up a double album in a similar manner, but following an earthquake, he decided to relocate to New York City and hold a live recording session at the Record Plant with session players. The basic idea was to create songs with sing-along choruses. Rundgren did not pre-plan who would play on the sessions, but simply wanted anyone who happened to be in or near the studio to turn up and learn the material.|$|E
5|$|The town of Calais had <b>contemplated</b> a {{historical}} monument for decades when Rodin {{learned of the}} project. He pursued the commission, interested in the medieval motif and patriotic theme. The mayor of Calais was tempted to hire Rodin on the spot upon visiting his studio, and soon the memorial was approved, with Rodin as its architect. It would commemorate the six townspeople of Calais who offered their lives to save their fellow citizens.|$|E
5|$|Without any {{ostensible}} heir, Cosimo <b>contemplated</b> {{restoring the}} Republic of Florence. However, this presented many obstacles. Florence was nominally an Imperial fief, and Siena a Spanish one. The plan {{was about to}} be approved by the powers convened at Geertruidenberg when Cosimo abruptly added that if himself and his two sons predeaceased the Electress Palatine she should succeed and the republic be re-instituted following her death. The proposal sank, and was ultimately put on hold following the Emperor Joseph's death.|$|E
