Such techniques take advantage of the stable and heritable RNAi phenotype in plant stocks. <b>Cotton</b> <b>seeds</b> are rich in dietary protein but naturally contain the toxic terpenoid product gossypol, making them unsuitable for human consumption. RNAi {{has been used}} to produce cotton stocks whose seeds contain reduced levels of delta-cadinene synthase, a key enzyme in gossypol production, without affecting the enzyme's production {{in other parts of the}} plant, where gossypol is itself important in preventing damage from plant pests.

5|$|Archeological {{evidence}} for {{agriculture in the}} Sangam age has been retrieved from sites such as Mangudi, Kodumanal and Perur, which have yielded charred remains of seeds of crops like rice, millets including pearl millets, pulses and cotton. It has been deduced that agriculture most likely involved dry farming, with additional irrigation for cotton and rice; mixed cropping {{seems to have been}} undertaken to replenish the nitrogen in the soil—this also suggests a spread of labour and knowledge of different sowing and harvesting techniques. The presence of <b>cotton</b> <b>seeds</b> indicates the production of a crop aimed at craft production, which is also attested by finds of cotton and spindle whorls at Kodumanal.

The purpose of the seed dealer survey and seed collection was to test the seed, through DNA fingerprinting, for purity and other traits (germination, moisture etc.). The survey was designed by the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) and implemented by Innovative Development Studies (IDS). The sample selection of seed dealers involved three steps: i) identification of markets from where most of the survey households in our sample for the study purchase seeds; ii) preparation of a list of all <b>cotton</b> <b>seed</b> dealers in these identified markets; and iii) selection of five seed dealers in each market and collect samples of three top selling varieties. The household survey identified that nearly 32 percent of the selected <b>cotton</b> growers purchased <b>seeds</b> from markets. These markets were located in 42 tehsils. Keeping in view the representation of all agroecological zones (AEZs) of cotton growing areas, 27 tehsil markets were randomly selected. A list of <b>cotton</b> <b>seed</b> dealers and <b>cotton</b> varieties that they purchased to sell in (kharif) 2015 were prepared in the selected tehsil markets. A <b>cotton</b> <b>seed</b> dealer is defined as a vendor of <b>cotton</b> <b>seed.</b> From the dealer listing, five seed dealers were selected randomly and subsequently top three selling <b>cotton</b> <b>seed</b> varieties per dealer were selected.

25|$|The cotton gin is a {{mechanical}} device that removes the seeds from cotton, {{a process that}} had previously been extremely labor-intensive. The word gin is short for engine.

2500|$|A {{number of}} social activist groups and studies {{proposed}} a link between genetically modified crops and farmer suicides. Bt cotton (Bacillus thuringiensis cotton) was claimed {{to be responsible for}} farmer suicides. The Bt <b>cotton</b> <b>seeds</b> cost nearly twice as much as ordinary ones. The higher costs forced many farmers into taking ever larger loans, often from private moneylenders charging exorbitant interest rates (60% a year). The moneylenders force farmers to sell their cotton to them at a price lower than it fetches on the market. According to activists, this created a source of debt and economic stress, ultimately suicides, among farmers. Increasing costs in farming associated with decreasing yields even with use of BT <b>cotton</b> <b>seeds</b> are often quoted cause of distress among farmers in central India.

Many of the pottery sherds contain Tamil-Brahmic inscriptions on them, which have provided additional evidence for the archaeologist to date them. Archaeologists agree that activities best illustrated in these material records are trade, hunting, agriculture and crafts. These excavations have provided evidence for the existence of the major economic activities mentioned in Sangam literature. Remnants of irrigation structures like reservoirs and ring wells and charred remains of seeds attest to the cultivation of different varieties of crops and knowledge of various agricultural techniques. Spinning whorls, <b>cotton</b> <b>seeds,</b> remains of a woven cotton cloth and dyeing vats provide evidence for the activities of the textile industry. Metallurgy has been supported by the discovery of an ancient blast furnace, along with its base and wall, anvil, slags and crucibles. The remains have indicated that, in addition to iron, the blacksmith may have worked with steel, lead, copper and bronze. The Kodumanal excavation recovered several jewellery items and semi precious stones at different stages of manufacture, suggesting that they were locally manufactured. Remains of import and export articles recovered from Arikamedu indicate the important role it played as an Indo-Roman trading station. Building construction, pearl fishery and painting are other activities that have been supported by findings from these excavations.|$|E

Eight experiment diets were used in achieving this aim during the 8 weeks feeding period. The chicks on the <b>cotton</b> <b>seed</b> cake replacement for soyabean meal had comparable (p> 0. 05) feed intake while the body weight gain and feed to gain ratio values were significantly different (p< 0. 05) to those of the chicks on the control diet.
