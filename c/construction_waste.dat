5|$|Energy {{efficient}} and sustainability features designed {{into the project}} led to a LEED Gold certification from the U.S. Green Building Council. Elements {{that led to this}} include landscaping that reduces runoff from rainwater, lots of natural light, a more efficient HVAC system that is located under the floors, and a location near public transit. Landscaping includes using drought resistant native species to reduce the need for irrigation. The floor-based HVAC system is more energy {{efficient and}} helps keep the temperature of the entire building more even and uses radiant heating and cooling. Additionally, the construction used environmentally friendly sealants, carpets, paints, and adhesives as well as preventing 90% of the <b>construction</b> <b>waste</b> from entering landfills. Also, potable water usage is reduced by 40% due to the use of low-flow sinks, showers, and toilets.

To achieve this high porosity, coarse aggregates are mainly used with a little or no participation of fine aggregates. The present paper comprises an approach to the addition of demolition wastes as substitutes for coarse aggregates in pervious concrete. Initially the chemical compatibility of <b>construction</b> <b>wastes</b> was examined in relation to the requirements of standard EN 12620 for concrete aggregates. The mineralogical analysis of both <b>construction</b> <b>wastes</b> and limestone aggregates was examined through XRD.

40|$|The {{increasing}} {{awareness of}} environmental impacts from <b>construction</b> <b>wastes</b> {{has led to}} the development of waste management as an important function of construction project management. Various approaches for managing <b>construction</b> <b>wastes</b> have been developed in the existing research works and practices, and these works can be grouped largely into three areas: waste classification, waste management strategies (avoiding waste, reducing waste, reusing waste and recycling waste), and waste disposal technologies. Nevertheless, these approaches give less attention to the management of waste handling process on construction sites. In fact, <b>construction</b> <b>wastes</b> pass through a number of processes from generation to final disposal, and proper flow of these processes can improve waste management effectiveness. This paper examines waste handling process during construction through mapping six cases selected in Hong Kong construction, with assistance of free-flow mapping presentation technique. The examination leads to developing a waste management mapping-model (WMMM), which incorporates the good operations embodied in the existing practices. WMMM provides an alterative tool assisting in planning waste management procedures on construction sites.

Thousands of tonnes of solid wastes are {{produced}} every year from construction and demolition activities. Increasing generation of these wastes has caused significant impacts on the environment and aroused growing public concerns. Therefore, the minimization of <b>construction</b> <b>wastes</b> has become a pressing issue. This paper aims to: i) revealing the status of construction wastes; ii) investigating the effectiveness of prefabrication in terms of waste reduction in replacing traditional wet-trade practices; iii) examining the factors that help minimize <b>construction</b> <b>wastes</b> by the adoption of prefabrication; and iv) exploring the current waste reduction situations after adoption of prefabrication by comparing with in-situ <b>construction.</b> It investigates <b>wastes</b> generated from various wet-trade construction activities such as in-situ concreting, timber formwork, bricklaying, plastering, screeding, tiling, rebar fixing and bamboo scaffolding. Six major reasons for the excessive construction wastage are known to be: i) cutting; ii) over ordering; iii) damaging during transportation; iv) losing during installation; v) poor workmanship; and vi) change of design. From the findings of a structured interview survey of thirty-one construction practitioners, "timber formwork" is found to be having the greatest potential for cutting scrap, and wastes from "poor workmanship" can be greatly reduced by adopting prefabrication in construction. Furthermore, after the adoption of prefabrication, wastage generation can be greatly reduced in various wet-trade activities including concreting, rebar fixing, bricklaying, drywall, plastering, screeding and tiling. Especially in plastering, the waste reduction can be reduced by 100 %. It is concluded that prefabrication of building components is one of the effective technologies of waste minimization.

2500|$|The Persian Gulf {{is home to}} over 700 {{species of}} fish, {{most of which are}} native. Of these 700 species, more than 80% are reef associated. These reefs are {{primarily}} rocky, but there are also a few coral reefs. Compared to the Red Sea, the coral reefs in the Persian Gulf are relatively few and far between. This is primarily connected to the influx of major rivers, especially the Shatt al-Arab (Euphrates and Tigris), which carry large amounts of sediment (most reef-building corals require strong light) and causes relatively large variations in temperature and salinity (corals in general are poorly suited to large variations). Nevertheless, coral reefs have been found along sections of coast of all countries in the Gulf. Corals are vital ecosystems that support multitude of marine species, and whose health directly reflects the health of the gulf. Recent years have seen a drastic decline in the coral population in the gulf, partially owing to global warming but majorly due to irresponsible dumping by Arab states like the UAE and Bahrain. Construction garbage such as tires, cement, and chemical by products have found their way to the Persian Gulf in recent years. Aside from direct damage to the coral, the <b>construction</b> <b>waste</b> creates [...] "traps" [...] for marine life in which they are trapped and die. The end result has been a dwindling population of the coral, and as a result a decrease in number of species that rely on the corals for their survival.|$|E

The amount of wastes generated increases yearly due to rapid economic growth worldwide which includes Malaysia. Due to waste generation, one of the major issues faced is the increase of illegal dumpsites. The illegal dumping may caused a risk to human health and environment. Thus, it calls for serious measures to regulate wastes generation. The waste is generated due to various factors throughout construction project life cycle (CPLC). For controlling purpose, {{it is very important to}} identify the generation factors and also to determine the level of risk from each factor. Hence, this study focuses on assessing the risk level of factors causing wastes generation throughout CPLC. Besides, it also proposes mitigation measures for the high risk factors. For assessing the risk level, a total of 33 factors that causes <b>construction</b> <b>wastes</b> generation that have been identified from literature review were considered. The assessment involved 15 experts who are experienced in handling construction projects. This investigation adopted two rounds of Delphi method in determining level of occurrence and severity of each factor in relation with different phases of CPLC.

The result indicated that in the construction phase, majority of the identified factors occurred in this phase are critical due to having high risk level and most of them are categorised in Human Resource/Manpower (HRM) group. It is followed by finishing phase, design phase, and planning phase. However, in planning phase, the chances of wastes generation are minimal with no high risk factors.
