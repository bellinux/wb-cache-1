30|$|After {{the basic}} {{decision}} of bonding all components to the monopiles, two main adhesive routes were implemented {{for the small}} sensors {{on the one hand}} and all other components like <b>cables,</b> <b>protection</b> profiles and recording computer on the other hand. Small sensors were applied by means of thin structural layers of adhesives for best coupling to the structure. This method is state of the art for measuring strains and accelerations in laboratory scale and this is also easily adaptable to larger scales. Thin layers and rigid bonds are necessary to avoid mechanical damping of the layer between sensors and structure, to guarantee correct measurements of dynamic deformation of the structure. All other components including sensor <b>protection,</b> <b>cables,</b> monitoring equipment, etc. were installed using thick layers of semi-structural adhesive on a maximized area to provide elastic bedding with excellent adhesion, high damping factor and low failure growth.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} the 400 kV AC submarine link under the Dardanelles Strait composed of 12 submarine armoured single-core cross-linked polyethylene (XLPE) -insulated cables (plus a back-up power cable). The link {{consists of two}} parallel-operated double-circuit links named Lâpseki–Sütlüce I and Lâpseki–Sütlüce II. The transmissible power is 4000 MW (1000 MW per circuit) and the average length for a single-core cable is about 4. 6 km: the submarine cables are part of overhead lines. This paper gives a wide account of the cable installations and, chiefly, of the <b>cable</b> <b>protections</b> on the seabed: different protection choices were extensively used (i. e., water jetting and mattressing) ...|$|R

50|$|A <b>cable</b> <b>{{protection}}</b> system, or CPS, is {{a system}} used {{for the protection of}} subsea power cables against various factors that negatively impact on the cable lifetime, normally used when entering an offshore structure. When a subsea power cable is laid, there is an area where the cable can be subjected to increased dynamic forces, which the cable is not necessarily designed to survive over the lifetime of the installation.|$|E

40|$|Sheath voltage {{limiters}} (SVL) are {{a critical}} component of an underground <b>cable's</b> <b>protection</b> system. SVLs must be sized such that, under steady state fault conditions, no conduction through the arrester occurs. This could otherwise lead to a catastrophic failure. A SVL failure [1] under steady state fault conditions prompted an investigation into the adequacy of traditional approaches used to model cable sheaths and underground cable networks. Injection tests have demonstrated that the type of sheath used has a large influence over the sheath voltage profile under faulted conditions. This is particularly evident with corrugated sheaths. In this paper, two common types of corrugated sheaths are investigated - the helically corrugated sheath (HCS) and the annularly corrugated sheath (ACS). The paper establishes improved models for each type of sheath and compares these models to sheath voltage profiles obtained from injection tests on three different types of underground cable systems...|$|R
