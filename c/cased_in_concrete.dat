5000|$|Some {{aqueduct}} conduits {{were supported}} across valleys or hollows on arches of masonry, brick or concrete. The Pont du Gard, {{one of the}} most impressive surviving examples of a massive masonry multiple-piered conduit, also served as a road-bridge. Where particularly deep or lengthy depressions had to be crossed, inverted siphons could be used; the conduit fed water into a header tank, which fed it into pipes. The pipes crossed the valley at lower level, supported by a low [...] "venter" [...] bridge, then rose to a receiving tank at a slightly lower elevation. This discharged into another conduit; the overall gradient was maintained. Siphon pipes were usually made of soldered lead, sometimes reinforced by concrete encasements or stone sleeves. Less often, the pipes themselves were stone or ceramic, jointed as male-female and sealed with lead. Vitruvius describes the construction of siphons and the problems of blockage, blow-outs and venting at their lowest levels, where the pressures were greatest. Nonetheless, siphons were versatile and effective if well-built and well-maintained. A horizontal section of high-pressure siphon tubing in the Aqueduct of the Gier was ramped up on bridgework to clear a navigable river, using nine lead pipes in parallel, <b>cased</b> <b>in</b> <b>concrete.</b> Modern hydraulic engineers use similar techniques to enable sewers and water pipes to cross depressions. At Arles, a minor branch of the main aqueduct supplied a local suburb via a lead siphon whose [...] "belly" [...] was laid across a riverbed, eliminating any need for supporting bridgework.|$|E

Furthermore, the case shows how the dynamic of structural and direct competition, because of its “captivating” nature, may prevent local actors from “denaturalizing” or questioning these incoherent practices. This study suggests that any action aimed at promoting alternative organizations requires that top managers and policymakers reflect on the competitive environment in which local actors of alternatives are placed and which can seriously undermine their emancipatory potential...|$|R

[...] School of Computing and Engineering. University of Missouri [...] Kansas City, 2015 Concrete pavement design is currently centered on steel reinforcement. Whether that reinforcement {{be in the}} form of dowel bars, as is the <b>case</b> <b>in</b> jointed plain <b>concrete</b> pavement (JPCP), or {{in the form of}} continuous rebar reinforcement, continuously reinforced concrete pavement (CRCP). The use of steel <b>in</b> <b>concrete</b> pavements presents durability problems due to the corrodibility of steel. This study evaluates the use of polypropylene fibrillated, polypropylene macro, and carbon fiber fibers as primary reinforcement <b>in</b> <b>concrete</b> pavements for the Louisiana DOT. Results showed that fiber reinforcement can be used to improve both the fatigue and toughness performance of concrete. When post-cracked strength or toughness is the concern, concrete containing more fibers and fibers with higher tensile strength are desirable. Carbon fibers maintained greater load-carrying capacity at lower deflections than the steel fibers, which produced the greatest ductility. However, toughness and fatigue performance did not correlate for small deflections, suggesting that polypropylene macro fibers may be adequate for repeated, low stress loading. This study also found that when repeated low deflections are a concern, such as with pavements, there must be sufficient fibers across a crack to maintain a tight crack. Conversely, too many fibers prevent adequate consolidation and aggregate interlock, which negatively influences performance. When considering the pre-cracked fatigue performance of fiber reinforcement, the fibers needed to have sufficient length to reach across the crack and bond with the concrete, and that higher fiber dosages increase the fatigue performance of the concrete. The resulting pavement design, continuously fiber reinforced concrete pavement (CFRCP), will provide an alternative to JPCP and CRCP in highway pavement design that is not susceptible to durability problems associated with corrosion of the reinforcement.
