5|$|In my {{time that}} curious {{railroad}} by the Whitby Moor {{was so much}} the more <b>curious,</b> <b>that</b> you were balanced against a counter-weight of water, and that you did it like Blondin. But in these remote days the one inn of Whitby was up a back-yard, and oyster-shell grottoes were the only view from the best private room.|$|E
5|$|It seems <b>curious</b> <b>that</b> a text so {{obviously}} written {{with the expectation}} that it would be widely copied should exist in only one manuscript and that, apparently, a draft. Treharne has taken this as suggesting that it is not only modern readers who have found the work tedious (Treharne 2000, p.273). Orm, however, says in the preface that he wishes Walter to remove any wording that he finds clumsy or incorrect (quoted in Bennett and Smithers 1982, pp.175–76).|$|E

25|$|It remains {{slightly}} <b>curious</b> <b>that</b> the City of Santa Monica (together {{with the}} canyon, bay, mountains, boulevard, airport and freeway) {{is named for}} a natural feature not actually within its borders. The name for the springs has since reverted to Kuruvungna ("the place {{where we are in}} the sun"), which is what the Tongva People have called them all along. The springs remain sacred to the Tongva People.|$|E
25|$|It was <b>curious</b> <b>that</b> an {{organization}} like the IWW with its revolutionary philosophy and its reputation for violence conducted a major strike {{with so little}} violence.

In all the arrests of strikers for picketing, there is no case where a striker was accused of carrying firearms.|$|E
25|$|With this iniquity of the Romans Salvian {{contrasts}} the chastity of the Vandals, the piety of the Goths, and the ruder {{virtues of}} the Franks, the Saxons, and the other tribes to whom, though heretic Arians or unbelievers, God is giving in reward the inheritance of the empire (vii. 9, II, 21). It is <b>curious</b> <b>that</b> Salvian shows no such hatred of the heterodox barbarians as was rife in Gaul seventy years later. It is difficult to credit the universal wickedness adduced by Salvian, especially in face of the contemporary testimony of Symmachus, Ausonius and Sidonius.|$|E

25|$|It seems <b>curious</b> <b>that</b> up to {{the middle}} of the seventeenth century Leeds had never been {{directly}} represented in Parliament. Many now quite insignificant places in Yorkshire had sent members to the House of Commons from a very early period--Malton, Beverley, Northallerton had returned members as far back as 1298; Otley had had two members for centuries. But it was not until 1654 that Adam Baynes was returned to sit at Westminster; he was returned again two years later with Francis Allanson as a second member. This representation came to an end at the Restoration in 1660, and Leeds had no more members of Parliament until the Reform Act 1832. But in 1661 it received some concession from the Crown which was perhaps of more importance to it—a new Municipal Charter. There had been some readjustment of the old one in 1642, but Charles II's Charter was of a far-reaching nature. It set up a Mayor, twelve Aldermen, twenty-four Assistants or Councillors, a Town Clerk, and a Recorder; it also provided for local election to vacancies. From the Charter of Charles I and that of his son are derived the well-known arms of the town. The owls are the Savile owls famous throughout the county, where the Saviles have been legion; the mullets figured on the arms of Thomas Danby, first Mayor. The dependent sheep typifies the wool trade.|$|E
500|$|When {{remarking}} in her diaries {{on other}} women who shared their affections with great men of the day, Arbuthnot displayed a sharp, ironic wit. Of Wellington's one-time mistress Princess Dorothea Lieven, wife to the Imperial Russian ambassador to London from 1812 to 1834, she wrote [...] "It is <b>curious</b> <b>that</b> the loves and intrigues of a femme galante should have such influence over the affairs of Europe." [...] Arbuthnot obviously failed to realise she was regarded by some in London society as a femme galante {{in a similar situation}} herself.|$|E
500|$|After {{working with}} the cover for the album, {{provisionally}} titled Runaway Train, Levy went on vacation and travelled with Pearl Jam on their 2008 tour. After a concert in Washington D.C., Levy {{came up with the}} idea [...] "to do it all graphic black on black" [...] and sketched what would become the yellow artwork. The record company liked it and requested he do two more in the same style, which became the red and white versions. During the promotional photography sessions, Levy made the deluxe edition art. The tracks on the album did not have much influence on the artwork as Levy had heard [...] "maybe 5 songs at that point", but he found it <b>curious</b> <b>that</b> his artwork fit the title track [...] "Black Ice", which was not among the tracks he had heard. Levy said that since the album had many similarities with Back in Black – [...] "Black" [...] in the title, dark covers, and AC/DC resurfacing with a sound based on the band's early work – the art was [...] "like a time travel, which is why there are so many psychedelic drawings". The artwork's resemblance to a train, echoing lead single [...] "Rock N' Roll Train", was a coincidence, given Levy [...] "never thought of it that way". Atop the image there is a cog with an image of Angus with his fist in the air resembling the statue on Stiff Upper Lip, because Levy [...] "just thought it was great as a continuing icon." [...] The photographs for the booklet and promotional photography were taken by music photographer Guido Karp, in August 2008 in London.|$|E

500|$|A main {{objective}} planned for The King of Fighters '95 was to introduce Iori properly as Kyo's rival. Creators have stated Iori's personality, {{and other aspects}} of his character such as his phrases and unique moves, [...] "broke the mold for characters in fighting games at that time" [...] Like Kyo, several aspects of Iori, including his surname and abilities, were designed to relate him to the Yamata no Orochi legend, which was the inspiration for the plot. After observing fan reactions at initial location testing for King of Fighters '95, several staff members predicted that Iori would be popular on his release. One of them was happy that at an event for The King of Fighters XIII on March 25, 2010, several fans reminded him that it was Iori's birthday according to his official profile. Iori is a berserker due to the Orochi demon blood within him. This version of him, officially named [...] "Orochi Iori", is hinted to have existed before his debut in The King of Fighters '97 as one of the game's mid bosses. This form of Iori was designed specifically to overpower other characters easily. Series' flagship director, Toyohisa Tanabe, states that the staff was initially reluctant to add this version of Iori to the series' roster—worried about fans' reactions—but did so to add more impact to the Orochi saga's climax. He was particularly pleased to see surprised reactions from female fans to this form during KOF '97s location testing. Another minor development of his character was his change of [...] "most valued possession/valued treasure" [...] information. A girlfriend was also listed more than once, specifically in The King of Fighters '95, The King of Fighters '99, and The King of Fighters 2000. However, starting with The King of Fighters 2001 and every entry after, the space is listed as [...] "None". The SNK staff commented that it is <b>curious</b> <b>that</b> he does not have a girlfriend anymore.|$|E
2500|$|The NTAC's {{executive}} director, Vanessa Edwards Foster, criticized Leno's comments as dehumanizing.

[...] "Leno's remarks took an historic recognition for a transgender community leader and summarily diminished it with insensitive humor." [...] The NTAC also criticized Leno for using the male pronoun to refer to Sparks.|$|E

He is supported because he is acting like [...] nationalist, not because he was or is Communist.|$|E

2500|$|Álvaro de Campos, the poet-persona {{who grew}} old with Pessoa {{and held a}} privileged place in his inventor’s hearts. Soares, the {{assistant}} bookkeeper and Campos, the naval engineer never met in the pen-and-paper drama of Pessoa’s heteronyms, who were frequently pitted against one other, but the two writer-characters were spiritual brothers, even if their wordly occupations were at odds. Campos wrote prose, as well as poetry, {{and much of it}} reads at it came, so to speak, from the hand of Soares. Pessoa was often unsure who was writing when he wrote, and it’s <b>curious</b> <b>that</b> the very first item among the more than 25,000 pieces that make up his archives in the National Library of Lisbon bears the heading [...] A. de C. (?) or B. de D. [...] (or something else).|$|E
2500|$|Some authors {{claim that}} the use of a hyphen in early {{published}} versions of the name is an indication that it is a pseudonym. It is argued that fictional descriptive names (such as [...] "Master Shoe-tie" [...] and [...] "Sir Luckless Woo-all") were often hyphenated in plays, and pseudonyms such as [...] "Tom Tell-truth" [...] were also sometimes hyphenated. Kathman argues {{that this is not the}} case, and that real names are as likely to be hyphenated as pseudonyms. He states that the pseudonym [...] "Martin Marprelate" [...] is sometimes hyphenated, but usually not. Robert Waldegrave, who printed the Marprelate tracts, never hyphenated the name, but did hyphenate his own: [...] "If hyphenation was supposed to indicate a pseudonym, it is <b>curious</b> <b>that</b> Waldegrave repeatedly hyphenated his own name while failing to hyphenate an undisputed pseudonym in the same texts." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{first known}} {{use of the}} word [...] "aromatic" [...] as a {{chemical}} term—namely, to apply to compounds that contain the phenyl group—occurs in an article by August Wilhelm Hofmann in 1855. If this is indeed the earliest introduction of the term, it is <b>curious</b> <b>that</b> Hofmann says nothing about why he introduced an adjective indicating olfactory character to apply to a group of chemical substances only some of which have notable aromas. Also, many of the most odoriferous organic substances known are terpenes, which are not aromatic in the chemical sense. But terpenes and benzenoid substances do have a chemical characteristic in common, namely higher unsaturation than many aliphatic compounds, and Hofmann may not have been making a distinction between the two categories. Many of the earliest-known examples of aromatic compounds, such as benzene and toluene, have distinctive pleasant smells. This property led to the term [...] "aromatic" [...] for this class of compounds, and hence the term [...] "aromaticity" [...] for the eventually discovered electronic property.|$|E

2500|$|The king {{knew that}} Paris {{was writing a}} history, and {{wanted it to be}} as exact as possible. In 1257, {{in the course of a}} week's visit to St Albans, Henry kept the chronicler beside him night and day, [...] "and guided my pen," [...] says Paris, [...] "with much {{goodwill}} and diligence." [...] It is <b>curious</b> <b>that</b> the Chronica majora gives so unfavourable an account of the king's policy. [...] Henry Richards Luard supposes that Paris never intended his work to be read in its present form. [...] Many passages of the autograph have written next to them, the note offendiculum, which shows that the writer understood the danger which he ran. On the other hand, unexpurgated copies were made in Paris' lifetime. [...] Although the offending passages are duly omitted or softened in his abridgment of his longer work, the Historia Anglorum (written about 1253), Paris' real feelings must have been an open secret. [...] There is no ground for the old theory that he was an official historiographer.|$|E
2500|$|A popular legend {{that has}} been around since at least 1937 traces the origin of the 1435 mm (4 ft [...] in) gauge even further back than the coalfields of {{northern}} England, pointing to the evidence of rutted roads marked by chariot wheels dating from the Roman Empire. It is <b>curious</b> <b>that</b> the Roman pace or passus was 4.855ft or 1435mm; a thousand such was one Roman mile. Snopes categorized this legend as [...] "false", but commented that [...] "it is perhaps more fairly labelled as 'True, but for trivial and unremarkable reasons. [...] The historical tendency to place the wheels of horse-drawn vehicles approximately [...] apart probably derives from the width needed to fit a carthorse in between the shafts. [...] In addition, while road-traveling vehicles are typically measured from the outermost portions of the wheel rims (and {{there is some evidence that}} the first railroads were measured in this way as well), it became apparent that for vehicles travelling on rails it was better to have the wheel flanges located inside the rails, and thus the distance measured on the inside of the wheels (and, by extension, the inside faces of the rail heads) was the important one.|$|E
2500|$|When {{sending his}} Historical preface and {{corrections}} for the American edition in February, Darwin thanked Asa Gray for his comments, as [...] "a Review from a man, {{who is not}} an entire convert, if fair & [...] moderately favourable, is in all respects {{the best kind of}} Review. About weak points I agree. The eye to this day gives me a cold shudder, but when I think of the fine known gradations, my reason tells me I ought to conquer the cold shudder." [...] In April he continued, [...] "It is <b>curious</b> <b>that</b> I remember well time when the thought of the eye made me cold all over, but I have got over this stage of the complaint, & now small trifling particulars of structure often make me very uncomfortable. The sight of a feather in a peacock's tail, whenever I gaze at it, makes me sick!" [...] A month later Darwin emphasised that he was bewildered by the theological aspects and [...] "had no intention to write atheistically, but could not see, as plainly as others do, & as I shd wish to do, evidence of design & beneficence on all sides of us. There seems to me too much misery in the world. I cannot persuade myself that a beneficent and omnipotent God would have designedly created the Ichneumonidae with the express intention of their feeding within the living bodies of caterpillars" [...] – expressing his particular revulsion at the Ichneumonidae family of parasitic wasps that lay their eggs in the larvae and pupae of other insects so that their parasitoid young have a ready source of food. He therefore could not believe in the necessity of design, but rather than attributing the wonders of the universe to brute force was [...] "inclined to look at everything as resulting from designed laws, with the details, whether good or bad, left to the working out of what we may call chance. Not that this notion at all satisfies me. I feel most deeply that the whole subject is too profound for the human intellect. A dog might as well speculate on the mind of Newton" [...] – referring to Isaac Newton.|$|E
