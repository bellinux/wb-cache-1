The basic Model 35 was mounted in a light gray console that matched the width of the Model 33, while the Model 35 ASR with eight-level mechanical tape punch and reader was installed in a console about twice as wide. The tape reader was mounted separately from the printer-punch mechanism {{on the left side of}} the console and behind it was a tray for storing a manual, sheets of paper, or other miscellanea. To the right of the keyboard was a panel that could optionally house a rotary dial or Touch-Tone pushbuttons for dialing a connection to a network via telephone lines. The printer cover in later units also featured sound deadening materials, making the Model 35 somewhat quieter than the Model 33 while printing and punching paper tapes. All versions of the Model 35 had a <b>copy</b> <b>holder</b> on the printer cover, making it more convenient for the operator when transcribing written material.|$|E

In addition, four different positions of the <b>copy</b> <b>holder</b> were examined in the upright sitting posture. Head posture and muscle activity were continuously measured in each exercise for a duration of 5 min. At the end of each exercise, the subjects were asked how they judged the position of the screen and/or the <b>copy</b> <b>holder</b> in comparison with other positions. The results show that preference is to be given to a screen position in which the vision axis is horizontal or inclined slightly downwards.

5000|$|Experienced <b>copy</b> <b>holders</b> employ various {{codes and}} verbal short-cuts that {{accompany}} their reading. The spoken word digits, for example, {{means that the}} numbers about to be read aren't words spelled out; and in a hole can mean that the upcoming segment of text is within parentheses. Bang means an exclamation point. A thump or screamer made with a finger on the table represents the initial cap, comma, period, or similar obvious attribute being read simultaneously. Thus the line of text: (He said the address was 1234 Central Blvd., and to hurry!) would be read aloud as: [...] "in a hole thump he said the address was digits 1 2 3 4 thump central thump buluhvuhd thump comma and to hurry bang". Mutual understanding is the only guiding principle, so codes evolve as opportunity permits. In the above example, two thumps after buluhvuhd might be acceptable to proofreaders familiar with the text.|$|R

How user innovations become commercial products: a theoretical investigation and case study Carliss Baldwin*, Christoph Hienerth* * and Eric von Hippel*** In this paper we model the pathways commonly traversed as user innovations are transformed into commercial products. First, one or more users recognize a new set of design possibilities and begin to innovate. They then join into communities, motivated by the increased efficiency of collective innovation. User-manufacturers then emerge, using high variable cost / low-capital production methods. Finally, as user innovation slows, the market stabilizes enough for high-capital, low variable cost manufacturing to enter. We test the model against the history of the rodeo kayak industry and find it supported. We discuss implications for âdominant design â theory and for innovation practice...|$|R

Many studies highlight the challenges facing incumbent firms in responding effectively to major technological transitions. While some authors argue that these challenges can be overcome by firms possessing what have been called âdynamic capabilities, â little work has described in detail the critical resources that these capabilities leverage, or the processes through which these resources accumulate and evolve. This paper explores these issues through an in-depth exploratory case study of one firm that has demonstrated consistently strong performance in an industry that is highly dynamic and uncertain. The focus for our study is Microsoft, the leading firm in the software industry. We motivate our focus on Microsoft by providing evidence that the firmâs product performance has been consistently strong {{over a period of time}} in which there have been several major technological transitions â one indicator that a firm possesses dynami...|$|R

Overview This working paper offers a longitudinal and descriptive analysis of the strategies of multinationals from developed countries in developing countries. The central argument is that strategies were shaped by the trade-off between opportunity and risk. Three broad environmental factors determined the trade-off. The first was the prevailing political economy, including the policies of both host and home governments, and the international legal framework. The second was the market and resources of the host country. The third factor was competition from local firms. The impact of these factors on corporate strategies is explored, as shown in Fig. 1, during the three eras in the modern history of globalization from the nineteenth century until the present day. The performance of specific multinationals depended {{on the extent to which}} their internal capabilities enabled them to respond to these external opportunities and threats...|$|R

It discusses the integrated risk management framework, emphasizing the connections between the three fundamental ways a company can implement its risk management objectives: modifying the firmâs operations, adjusting its capital structure, and employing targeted financial instruments. âIntegration â refers both to {{the combination of these}} three risk management techniques, and to the aggregation of all risks faced by the firm. The paper offers a functional analysis of integrated risk management using a wide set of illustrative situations to show how the risk management process influences, and is influenced by, the overall business activities and the strategy of the firm.

H&R Blockâs Refund Anticipation Loan: A Paradox of Profitability?* Some firms comprehend the enormous potential that exists for providing services to the growing low income segment. Operating in the low-income market has numerous complications, such as designing an efficient distribution and servicing system, offering simple and âeasy to consume â products, and training a sales force. In addition, vendors of products for the poor often must enter into a contentious, long-standing and irresolvable debate about appropriate levels of profit and consumer protection. Regardless of the merits of these debates, firms can find themselves bedeviled by complicated interactions with non-customers, including consumer advocates, the press, courts and regulators. The experiences of H&R Block, a $ 4. 2 billion income tax preparation and financial services firm headquartered in Kansas City, Missouri, illustrate some of these costs. Block sells a highly profitable âRefund Anticipation Loan â (RAL...|$|R

Specifically, products are often said to âmirror â the architectures of the organizations from which they come. This dynamic occurs because an organizationâs problem solving routines and normal patterns of communication tend to constrain the space of designs within which it searches for new solutions. Such a link, if confirmed empirically, would be important, given that product architecture {{has been shown to be}} an important predictor of product performance, product variety, process flexibility and industry evolution. We explore this relationship in the software industry by use of a technique called Design Structure Matrices (DSMs), which allows us to visualize the architectures of different software products and to calculate metrics to compare their levels of modularity. Our research takes advantage of a natural experiment in this industry, where product...|$|R

It may not be reproduced without permission of the copyright <b>holder.</b> <b>Copies</b> of working Employees often hold substantial levels of company stock in their defined contribution pension plans, a practice widely-recognized as risky but nonetheless common in hightech firms and blue-chips alike. While one might reason that employees {{willing to take on}} the increased risk should do so, holding company stock is inefficient for all employees, even risk tolerant ones. This paper investigates the extent of company stock ownership within defined contribution pension plans and estimates its cost, finding that employee investors sacrifice an average 42 % of their company stockâs market value by taking on risk that could otherwise have been âdiversified away. â Significant losses occur even at levels of company stock ownership that fall within the newly-proposed legislative limits. By matching with cash rather than stock, firms could reduce that lost value, making both employees and the firm better off. Risk tolerant employees who want to âswing for the fences â should instead diversify their portfolios and lever them to the desired risk levels...|$|R

In particular, designs which are modular in nature are argued to be more âevolvable, â in that these designs facilitate making future adaptations, the nature of which do not have to be specified in advance. In essence, modularity creates âoption value â with respect to new and improved designs, which is particularly important when a system must meet uncertain future demands. Despite the conceptual appeal of this research, empirical work exploring the relationship between modularity and evolution has had limited success. Three major challenges persist: first, it is difficult to measure modularity in a robust and repeatable fashion; second, modularity is a property of individual components, not systems as a whole, hence we must examine these dynamics at the microstructure level; and third, evolution is a temporal phenomenon, in that the conditions at time t affect the nature o...|$|R
