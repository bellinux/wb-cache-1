5|$|The gold {{standard}} for judging imaging methods is contrast venography, which involves injecting a peripheral vein of the affected limb with a <b>contrast</b> <b>agent</b> and taking X-rays, to reveal whether the venous supply has been obstructed. Because of its cost, invasiveness, availability, and other limitations, this test is rarely performed.|$|E
5|$|Some {{ytterbium}} halides {{are used}} as reagents in organic synthesis. For example, ytterbium(III) chloride (YbCl3) is a Lewis acid {{and can be used}} as a catalyst in the Aldol and Diels–Alder reactions. Ytterbium(II) iodide (YbI2) may be used, like samarium(II) iodide, as a reducing agent for coupling reactions. Ytterbium(III) fluoride (YbF3) is used as an inert and non-toxic tooth filling as it continuously releases fluoride ions, which are good for dental health, and is also a good X-ray <b>contrast</b> <b>agent.</b>|$|E
5|$|In some instances, lumbar {{puncture}} {{may be required}} {{if there is a}} suspicion that the symptoms might be caused by other problems (meningitis or subarachnoid hemorrhage). This is the examination of the cerebrospinal fluid that envelops the brain and the spinal cord; the sample is obtained with a needle that is passed under local anesthetic into the spine. In pituitary apoplexy the results are typically normal, although abnormalities may be detected if blood from the pituitary has entered the subarachnoid space. If there is remaining doubt about the possibility of subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), a magnetic resonance angiogram (MRI with a <b>contrast</b> <b>agent)</b> may be required to identify aneurysms of the brain blood vessels, {{the most common cause of}} SAH.|$|E

40|$|Numerous {{macromolecular}} MRI <b>contrast</b> <b>agents</b> prepared employing {{relatively simple}} chemistry may be readily available {{that can provide}} sufficient enhancement for multiple applications. These agents operate using a ~ 100 -fold lower concentration of gadolinium ions {{in comparison to the}} necessary concentration of iodine employed in CT imaging. Herein, we describe some of the general potential directions of macromolecular MRI <b>contrast</b> <b>agents</b> using our recently reported families of dendrimer-based agents as examples. Changes in molecular size altered the route of excretion. Smaller-sized <b>contrast</b> <b>agents</b> less than 60 kDa molecular weight were excreted through the kidney resulting in these agents being potentially suitable as functional renal <b>contrast</b> <b>agents.</b> Hydrophilic and larger-sized <b>contrast</b> <b>agents</b> were found better suited for use as blood pool <b>contrast</b> <b>agents.</b> Hydrophobic variants formed with polypropylenimine diaminobutane dendrimer cores created liver <b>contrast</b> <b>agents.</b> Larger hydrophilic agents are useful for lymphatic imaging.

5|$|Clinical data alone may be {{sufficient}} for {{a diagnosis of}} MS if an individual has had separate episodes of neurological symptoms characteristic of the disease. In those who seek medical attention after only one attack, other testing is needed for the diagnosis. The most commonly used diagnostic tools are neuroimaging, analysis of cerebrospinal fluid and evoked potentials. Magnetic resonance imaging {{of the brain and}} spine may show areas of demyelination (lesions or plaques). Gadolinium can be administered intravenously as a <b>contrast</b> <b>agent</b> to highlight active plaques and, by elimination, demonstrate the existence of historical lesions not associated with symptoms at the moment of the evaluation. Testing of cerebrospinal fluid obtained from a lumbar puncture can provide evidence of chronic inflammation in the central nervous system. The cerebrospinal fluid is tested for oligoclonal bands of IgG on electrophoresis, which are inflammation markers found in 75–85% of people with MS. The nervous system in MS may respond less actively to stimulation of the optic nerve and sensory nerves due to demyelination of such pathways. These brain responses can be examined using visual- and sensory-evoked potentials.|$|E
25|$|Conventional x-rays and {{ultrasonography}} are {{the primary}} tools used to confirm a diagnosis of injuries sustained to the rotator cuff. For extended clinical questions, imaging through Magnetic Resonance with or without intraarticular <b>contrast</b> <b>agent</b> is indicated.|$|E
25|$|Fluoroscopy and {{angiography}} {{are special}} applications of X-ray imaging, {{in which a}} fluorescent screen and image intensifier tube is connected to a closed-circuit television system. This allows real-time imaging of structures in motion or augmented with a radiocontrast agent. Radiocontrast agents are usually administered by swallowing or injecting {{into the body of}} the patient to delineate anatomy and functioning of the blood vessels, the genitourinary system, or the gastrointestinal tract (GI tract). Two radiocontrast agents are presently in common use. Barium sulfate (BaSO4) is given orally or rectally for evaluation of the GI tract. Iodine, in multiple proprietary forms, is given by oral, rectal, intra-arterial or intravenous routes. These radiocontrast agents strongly absorb or scatter X-rays, and in conjunction with the real-time imaging, allow demonstration of dynamic processes, such as peristalsis in the digestive tract or blood flow in arteries and veins. Iodine contrast may also be concentrated in abnormal areas more or less than in normal tissues and make abnormalities (tumors, cysts, inflammation) more conspicuous. Additionally, in specific circumstances, air {{can be used as a}} <b>contrast</b> <b>agent</b> for the gastrointestinal system and carbon dioxide can be used as a <b>contrast</b> <b>agent</b> in the venous system; in these cases, the <b>contrast</b> <b>agent</b> attenuates the X-ray radiation less than the surrounding tissues.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Because {{magnetic}} resonance imaging (MRI) <b>contrast</b> <b>agents</b> {{play a vital role}} in diagnosing diseases, demand for new MRI <b>contrast</b> <b>agents,</b> with an enhanced sensitivity and advanced functionalities, is very high. During the past decade, various inorganic nanoparticles have been used as MRI <b>contrast</b> <b>agents</b> due to their unique properties, such as large surface area, easy surface functionalization, excellent contrasting effect, and other size-dependent properties. This review provides an overview of recent progress in the development of nanoparticle-based T 1 -weighted MRI <b>contrast</b> <b>agents.</b> The chemical synthesis of the nanoparticle-based <b>contrast</b> <b>agents</b> and their potential applications were discussed and summarized. In addition, the recent development in nanoparticle-based multimodal <b>contrast</b> <b>agents</b> including T 1 -weighted MRI/computed X-ray tomography (CT) and T 1 -weighted MRI/optical were also described, since nanoparticles may curtail the shortcomings of single mode <b>contrast</b> <b>agents</b> in diagnostic and clinical settings by synergistically incorporating functionality...|$|R
25|$|The 3D image {{itself can}} be {{overlaid}} colour-coded {{on top of the}} fluoroscopic image. Any change of the angulations of the C-arm will cause the workstation to re-calculate in real-time the view on the 3D image to match exactly the view of the live 2D fluoroscopy image. Without additional <b>contrast</b> <b>agent</b> injection the surgeon can observe device movements simultaneously with the 3D overlay of the vessel contours in the fluoroscopy image.|$|E
25|$|For DSA, {{the same}} {{sequence}} of a projection is acquired without {{and then with}} <b>contrast</b> <b>agent</b> injection through the vessels under investigation. The first image is subtracted from the second to remove background structures such as bones {{as completely as possible}} and show the contrast-filled vessels more clearly. As there is a time lag between the acquisition of the first and the second image, motion correction algorithms are necessary to remove movement artifacts.|$|E
25|$|The {{osmolality}} of the <b>contrast</b> <b>agent</b> {{was previously}} {{believed to be}} an important factor in contrast-induced nephropathy. Today it has become increasingly clear that other physicochemical properties play a greater role, such as viscosity. Attention should be paid to using contrast agents of low viscosity. Moreover, sufficient fluids should be supplied to limit fluid viscosity of urine. Modern iodinated contrast agents are non-ionic, the older ionic types caused more adverse effects, and their use has diminished.|$|E
40|$|Magnetic {{resonance}} imaging is an exclusive imaging method which can distinguish injured tissues from the healthy tissues or organs without using ionizing radiation. Magnetic {{resonance imaging}} {{is able to}} provide quantitative data regarding the anatomical and physiological features of each specific organ. Magnetic resonance imaging is a non-invasive method, but <b>contrast</b> <b>agents</b> are necessary to enhance the visualization of inaccessible organs in some organs such as gastrointestinal (GI) imaging. Various types of <b>contrast</b> <b>agents</b> {{have been used in}} studies including intravascular administration and oral materials.

40|$|Uptake {{value in}} {{quantitative}} PET imaging is biased {{due to the}} presence of CT <b>contrast</b> <b>agents</b> when using CT-based attenuation correction. Our aim was to examine spectral CT imaging to suppress inaccuracy of 511 keV attenuation map in the presence of multiple nanoparticulate <b>contrast</b> <b>agents.</b> Using a simulation study we examined an image-based K-edge ratio method, in which two images acquired from energy windows located above and below the K-edge energy are divided by one another, to identify the exact location of all <b>contrast</b> <b>agents.</b> Multiple computerized phantom studies were conducted using a variety of NP <b>contrast</b> <b>agents</b> with different concentrations. The performance of the proposed methodology was compared to conventional single-kVp and dual-kVp methods using wide range of <b>contrast</b> <b>agents</b> with varying concentrations. The results demonstrate that both single-kVp and dual-kVp energy mapping approaches produce inaccurate attenuation maps at 511 keV in the presence of multiple simultaneous <b>contrast</b> <b>agents.</b> In <b>contrast,</b> the proposed method is capable of handling multiple simultaneous <b>contrast</b> <b>agents,</b> thus allowing suppression of 511 keV attenuation map inaccuracy.

30|$|Iron oxide {{nanoparticles}} (IONPs) {{are used}} in various non-invasive radiological examinations for the observation of clinically relevant biomarkers [24, 25].

25|$|Also, a {{radiological}} {{procedure is}} {{available as a}} reliable and accurate test for SS. A <b>contrast</b> <b>agent</b> is injected into the parotid duct, which opens from the cheek into the vestibule of the mouth opposite {{the neck of the}} upper second molar tooth. Histopathology studies should show focal lymphocytic sialadenitis. Objective evidence of salivary gland involvement is tested through ultrasound examinations, the level of unstimulated whole salivary flow, a parotid sialography or salivary scintigraphy, and autoantibodies against Ro (SSA) and/or La (SSB) antigens.|$|E
25|$|To {{generate}} {{an image of}} the cardiovascular system, including the arteries and veins (angiography) an initial image is taken of the anatomical region of interest. A second image is then taken of the same region after an iodinated <b>contrast</b> <b>agent</b> has been injected into the blood vessels within this area. These two images are then digitally subtracted, leaving an image of only the iodinated contrast outlining the blood vessels. The radiologist or surgeon then compares the image obtained to normal anatomical images to determine whether there is any damage or blockage of the vessel.|$|E
25|$|Rotational {{angiography}} visualizes the bronchial tree in 3D {{during the}} procedure. The air thereby {{serves as a}} ‘natural’ <b>contrast</b> <b>agent,</b> thus the nodules are well visible. On this 3D image, using dedicated software, the nodules can be marked, along with a planned needle path for the biopsy (endobronchially or trans-thoracically). These images can then be overlaid on live fluoroscopy. This gives the pulmonologist improved guidance towards the nodules. Yield rates of 90% in nodules of 1–2cm, and 100% in nodules > 2cm have been reported with this new approach.|$|E
30|$|Air-filled <b>agents,</b> named first-generation <b>contrast</b> <b>agents</b> (for example, SHU 508, Levovist®), can be {{used with}} high {{mechanical}} index intermittent. The microbubbles can be disrupted, releasing a strong, but transient irregular harmonic signal that increases the Doppler signal intensity on colour Doppler sonography. Indeed, such <b>contrast</b> <b>agents</b> are not true <b>contrast</b> <b>agents</b> but rather vascular Doppler signal enhancers. Rupture of the microbubbles due to high pressure is a significant limitation for real-time imaging, so currently these <b>contrast</b> <b>agents</b> are not used in clinical practice.|$|R
40|$|This review {{focuses on}} MRI <b>contrast</b> <b>agents</b> for tumor diagnosis. Several types of low {{molecular}} weight Gd 3 +-based complexes and dextran-coated superparamagnetic iron oxide (SPIO) nanoparticles {{have been used for}} clinical tumor diagnosis as longitudinal relaxation time (T 1) and transverse relaxation time (T 2) MRI <b>contrast</b> <b>agents,</b> respectively. To further improve the sensitivity of MRI, new types of chelates for T 1 MRI <b>contrast</b> <b>agents</b> and combination of {{low molecular weight}} T 1 MRI <b>contrast</b> <b>agents</b> with different types of carriers have been investigated. Different types of materials for forming secure coating layers of SPIO and novel superparamagnetic particles with higher relaxivity values have been explored. Various types of ligands were applied to improve the capability to target tumor for both T 1 and T 2 <b>contrast</b> <b>agents.</b> Furthermore, MRI <b>contrast</b> <b>agents</b> for detection of tumor metabolism were also pursued...|$|R
50|$|Enzyme-activated MR <b>contrast</b> <b>agents</b> are {{compounds}} that cause a detectable change in image intensity {{when in the}} presence of the active form of a certain enzyme.

25|$|Various {{types of}} barium X-ray {{examinations}} {{are used to}} examine {{different parts of the}} gastrointestinal tract.

The barium swallow, barium meal, and barium follow-through are together also called an upper gastrointestinal series (or study), whereas the barium enema is called a lower gastrointestinal series (or study). In upper gastrointestinal series examinations, the barium sulfate is mixed with water and swallowed orally, whereas in the lower gastrointestinal series (barium enema), the barium <b>contrast</b> <b>agent</b> is administered as an enema through a small tube inserted into the rectum.|$|E
25|$|Once the {{diagnosis}} of AKI is made, further testing is often required to determine the underlying cause. It is useful to perform a bladder scan or a post void residual to rule out urinary retention. In post void residual, a catheter is inserted into the urinary tract immediately after urinating to measure fluid still in the bladder. 50–100nbsp&ml suggests neurogenic bladder dysfunction. A kidney ultrasound will demonstrate hydronephrosis if present. A CT scan of the abdomen will also demonstrate bladder distension or hydronephrosis. However, in AKI, the use of IV contrast is contraindicated as the <b>contrast</b> <b>agent</b> used is nephrotoxic.|$|E
25|$|Angiography, {{since the}} 1960s, {{has been the}} {{traditional}} way of evaluating for atheroma. However, angiography is only motion or still images of dye mixed with the blood with the arterial lumen and never show atheroma; the wall of arteries, including atheroma with the arterial wall remain invisible. The limited exception to this rule is that with very advanced atheroma, with extensive calcification within the wall, a halo-like ring of radiodensity {{can be seen in}} most older humans, especially when arterial lumens are visualized end-on. On cine-floro, cardiologists and radiologists typically look for these calcification shadows to recognize arteries before they inject any <b>contrast</b> <b>agent</b> during angiograms.|$|E

25|$|Hydrosalpinx may be {{diagnosed}} using ultrasonography as the fluid filled elongated and distended tubes display their typical echolucent pattern. However, a small hydrosalpinx may be missed by sonography. During an infertility work-up a hysterosalpingogram (HSG), an X-ray procedure {{that uses a}} <b>contrast</b> <b>agent</b> to image the fallopian tubes, shows the retort-like shape of the distended tubes {{and the absence of}} spillage of the dye into the peritoneum. If, however, there is a tubal occlusion at the utero-tubal junction, a hydrosalpinx may go undetected. When a hydrosalpinx is detected by an HSG it is prudent to administer antibiotics {{to reduce the risk of}} reactivation of an inflammatory process.|$|E
25|$|MRI, in general, {{has better}} spatial {{resolution}} than EEG and MEG, {{but not as}} good a resolution as invasive procedures such as single-unit electrodes. While typical resolutions are in the millimeter range, ultra-high-resolution MRI or MR spectroscopy works at a resolution of tens of micrometers. It uses 7T fields, small-bore scanners that can fit small animals such as rats, and external contrast agents such as fine iron oxide. Fitting a human requires larger-bore scanners, which make higher fields strengths harder to achieve, especially if the field has to be uniform; it also requires either internal contrast such as BOLD or a non-toxic external <b>contrast</b> <b>agent</b> unlike iron oxide.|$|E
25|$|VATS (video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery) is a minimally-invasive {{technique}} to resect lung nodules that saves the patient {{the trauma of}} a thoracotomy. Thereby, small ports are used to access the pulmonary lobes and introduce a camera on a thoracoscope, along with the necessary instruments. While this procedure speeds up recovery and potentially reduces complications, the loss of natural vision and tactile sensing {{makes it difficult for}} the surgeon to locate the nodules, especially in cases of non-superficial, ground-glass opaque, and small lesions. The yield rate for nodules < 1nbsp&cm can be below 40% as studies show. As a consequence sometimes more healthy tissue is resected than actually necessary in order to avoid missing (parts of) the lesion. Using advanced intra-operative imaging in the OR helps to precisely locate and resect the lesion in a potentially tissue-sparing and quick fashion. In {{order to be able to}} use image guidance during VATS, rotational angiography has to be performed before the introduction of ports, thus before the lobe in question deflates. This way the lesion is visible through the natural contrast of air. In a second step, hook wires, thread needles, or <b>contrast</b> <b>agent</b> (Lipiodol, Iopamidol) are introduced into or next to the lesion to ensure visibility on the angiogram after lung deflation. Then, the conventional part of VATS starts with the introduction of thoracoscopes. The imaging system is used in fluoroscopic mode now, where both the inserted instruments and the previously marked lesion are well visible. A precise resection is now possible. In case <b>contrast</b> <b>agent</b> has been used to mark the lesion, it will also drain into the regional lymph nodes, which then can be resected within the same procedure.|$|E
