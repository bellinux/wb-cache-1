5000|$|In March 1973 the VH {{range was}} {{superseded}} by the VJ series. The VJ featured {{changes to the}} <b>cowl,</b> <b>grille,</b> lighting and rear quarter feature panel, with notably 7" [...] round headlights replacing the previous rectangular units. Significantly, this new model range saw {{the end of the}} Charger R/T, which pretty much coincided with Chrysler having officially withdrawn from participation in Australian touring car racing {{at the end of the}} 1972 season. However, the essential elements of the Six Pack E37 engine option were carried over into the VJ series, now referred to as the E48 engine option.|$|E
2500|$|Streamliners {{used the}} larger B-body and, {{except for the}} station wagons, used {{fastback}} styling. The 1941 Super models with folding center armrest were known as Chieftains in 1942. All Pontiacs looked lower, heavier and wider. Extension caps on the front doors lengthened the forward fender lines. The hood extended {{back to the front}} doors, eliminating the <b>cowl.</b> The <b>grille,</b> bumper and hood were widened and headlamps were further apart. Long horizontal parking lamps sat just above the vertical side grilles. The horseshoe shaped center grille had horizontal bars and a circular emblem {{in the middle of the}} upper main surround molding. The word Pontiac appeared on the hood side molding of six-cylinder models, while the moldings of the eight-cylinder cars said Pontiac Eight. After December 15, 1941, wartime [...] "blackout" [...] trim was used. All parts previously chrome plated were finished in Duco Gun Metal Grey.|$|R
2500|$|... 1976 models {{featured}} steel {{floor panels}} shielding the catalytic converter exhaust. These steel floor panels weighed {{less than the}} previous fiberglass floor and reduced interior noise levels. Horsepower rose to [...] for the base L-48 engine; [...] for the optional L-82. To further reduce cabin noise levels, cowl induction was dropped {{in favor of the}} air cleaner ducted over the radiator, picking up outside air {{from the front of the}} car, thus reducing wind turbulence at the base of the windshield. The hood was carried over, with its <b>cowl</b> vent <b>grille</b> and induction system opening becoming non-functional. The optional cast aluminum wheels were finally made available, which reduced the unsprung weight of the car by 32pounds. Nearly 15% of the cars were ordered with the new wheels at a cost of $299. A standard steel rim spare was used. This was the last year for optional white striped tires, as 86% of the cars were being delivered with the optional white lettered tires. A new rear nameplate for the rear bumper cover was introduced, eliminating the individual [...] "Corvette" [...] letters used since 1968. An unwelcome change was the [...] "Vega GT" [...] 4-spoke steering wheel, although its smaller diameter did provide extra room and eased entry/exit. The steering wheel, color-keyed to the interior, continued on 1977 through 1979 models, limited to non-tilt wheel cars only. GM's [...] "Freedom" [...] battery, a new sealed and maintenance-free unit, was now installed in all cars. The rear window defroster option was changed from the forced-air type of previous years to the new [...] "Electro-Clear" [...] defogger, an in-glass heated element type. Even without a convertible model, the Corvette still set new sales records.|$|R
