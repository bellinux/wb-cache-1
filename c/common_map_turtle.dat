50|$|The {{northern}} map turtle (Graptemys geographica), or <b>common</b> <b>map</b> <b>turtle,</b> is an aquatic turtle in {{the family}} Emydidae. It is endemic to North America. This turtle is kept as a pet.|$|E
40|$|We studied turtle populations inhabiting a {{canal and}} a lake (both man-made) within a heavily disturbed, urban setting. Six aquatic and {{semi-aquatic}} turtle species {{were collected in}} both habitats: spiny softshell turtle (Apolone spinifera), painted turtle (Chrysemys picta), common snapping turtle (Chelydra serpentina), <b>common</b> <b>map</b> <b>turtle</b> (Graptemys geographica), common musk turtle (Sternotherus odoratus) and red-eared slider (Trachemys scripta). While G. geographica {{was the most common}} species in the canal habitat, T. scripta was most common in the lake habitat. We describe patterns of sexual size dimorphism and sex ratios for the three most abundant species (G. geographica, T. scripta and S. odoralus). We discuss our data in light of problems facing turtle assemblages in urban settings...|$|E
50|$|Throughout the pet trade, Mississippi, <b>common,</b> and Ouachita <b>map</b> <b>turtles</b> were bred and hatched {{out by the}} {{thousands}} in the 1970s. Various other turtles were available, but as the salmonellosis Four-inch Law was established, <b>map</b> <b>turtles</b> and others slowly decreased in popularity. Today, these same three still hold the title for most common among the pet trade. Other species being captive-bred more often include the Texas <b>map</b> <b>turtle,</b> Cagle's <b>map</b> <b>turtle,</b> and the black-knobbed <b>map</b> <b>turtle.</b> Some harder-to-find <b>map</b> <b>turtles</b> include the yellow-blotched <b>map</b> <b>turtle</b> and the Pearl River <b>map</b> <b>turtle.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Ouachita <b>map</b> <b>turtle</b> or Sabine <b>map</b> <b>turtle</b> (Graptemys ouachitensis) is {{a species}} of turtle endemic to the United States.|$|R
50|$|Yellow-blotched <b>map</b> <b>turtles</b> are medium- to small-sized turtles, with males {{ranging from}} 3.5 to 4.5 in (9-11.5 cm) in {{carapace}} length as adults. Adult females are larger, about 5 to 7.5 in (13-19 cm) in carapace length. The yellow-blotched <b>map</b> <b>turtle</b> {{has the highest}} central keel of all <b>map</b> <b>turtles.</b>|$|R
40|$|Our study {{focuses on}} the spatial ecology and {{seasonal}} habitat use of two aquatic turtles {{in order to understand}} the manner in which upland habitat use by humans shapes the aquatic activity, movement, and habitat selection of these species in an urban setting. We used radiotelemetry to follow 15 female Graptemys geographica (<b>common</b> <b>map</b> <b>turtle)</b> and each of ten male and female Trachemys scripta (red-eared slider) living in a man-made canal within a highly urbanized region of Indianapolis, IN, USA. During the active season (between May and September) of 2002, we located 33 of the 35 individuals a total of 934 times and determined the total range of activity, mean movement, and daily movement for each individuals. We also analyzed turtle locations relative to the upland habitat types (commercial, residential, river, road, woodlot, and open) surrounding the canal and determined that the turtles spent a disproportionate amount of time in woodland and commercial habitats and avoided the road-associated portions of the canal. We also located 21 of the turtles during hibernation (February 2003), and determined that an even greater proportion of individuals hibernated in woodland-bordered portions of the canal. Our results clearly indicate that turtle habitat selection is influenced by human activities; sound conservation and management of turtle populations in urban habitats will require the incorporation of spatial ecology and habitat use data...|$|E
50|$|It {{is found}} in the Pascagoula River in the United States. It {{formerly}} included a population in the Pearl River, but in 2010, that population was described as a separate species, the Pearl River <b>map</b> <b>turtle,</b> Graptemys pearlensis. The Pascagoula <b>map</b> <b>turtle</b> shares its range with the yellow-blotched <b>map</b> <b>turtle,</b> G. flavimaculata.|$|R
50|$|Cagle's <b>map</b> <b>turtle</b> has {{intricate}} {{patterns on}} the carapace and plastron, as well as serrated edges on the posterior of the carapace, as is typical of all <b>map</b> <b>turtles.</b> It is smaller than most <b>map</b> <b>turtles,</b> and very sexually dimorphic, with males reaching only 4 in carapace length while females can exceed 7 in in carapace length.|$|R
50|$|The yellow-blotched <b>map</b> <b>turtle</b> (Graptemys flavimaculata), or yellow-blotched sawback, is {{a species}} of turtle in the Emydidae family. It {{is part of the}} narrow-headed group of <b>map</b> <b>turtles,</b> and is endemic to the {{southern}} United States.|$|R
50|$|The Texas <b>map</b> <b>turtle</b> (Graptemys versa) is {{a species}} of emydid turtle endemic to the {{southern}} United States. Texas <b>map</b> <b>turtles</b> are popular in the pet trade. However, they became more common because of captive breeding.|$|R
50|$|<b>Map</b> <b>turtles</b> are {{considered}} habitat specialists {{and may be}} replaced by a more tolerant species when their habitat is altered. Unfortunately the effects of human interference by way boating and recreation on shorelines are likely impeding the <b>map</b> <b>turtle</b> from re-establishing itself in natural areas. Thus, populations of Northern <b>map</b> <b>turtles</b> have probably declined across their entire natural range but they remain widespread and may be abundant in some locations. This species has classified as least concern by the IUCN.|$|R
50|$|The Alabama <b>map</b> <b>turtle</b> (Graptemys pulchra) is {{a species}} of emydid turtle endemic to the {{southern}} United States. Differentiation from other turtle species includes a black stripe running {{down the center of}} its back with knobs extruding from it, but these projections wear down with age. T.H. Bean and L. Kumlen first collected the Alabama <b>map</b> <b>turtle</b> in July 1876 from a lake near Montgomery, Alabama. Type locality for this species is Montgomery County, Alabama. Baur described and named the Alabama <b>map</b> <b>turtle</b> in 1893. The genus Graptemys includes nine species of mostly aquatic turtles.|$|R
50|$|The false <b>map</b> <b>turtle</b> was {{discovered}} locally in 2009.|$|R
50|$|Owning Barbour's <b>map</b> <b>turtles</b> {{is illegal}} in Georgia, Michigan, and Alabama. The limit is two turtles per person in Florida. Like all <b>map</b> <b>turtles,</b> {{they are under}} the {{protection}} of the Salmonellosis Four-inch Regulation, disallowing these turtles to be sold if they are under the length of 4 in (10 cm).|$|R

50|$|Captive {{breeding}} {{has been}} an option for conservation efforts, also. Captive breeding is plausible for increasing population sizes in captivity. However, it remains unclear if captive-bred black-knobbed <b>map</b> <b>turtles</b> can be released into the wild and breed on their own. Black-knobbed <b>map</b> <b>turtles</b> are popular in the pet trade, but became more common because of captive breeding.|$|R
40|$|This study {{assessed}} {{the principles of}} ecosystem management and utilized the Northern <b>Map</b> <b>turtle,</b> a species at risk, as a key indicator species to illustrate the importance of preserving riparian habitats and island complexes on an ecosystem scale. Overall, the study explored the population characteristics and use of habitat of the Northern <b>Map</b> <b>turtle</b> (Graptemys geographica) within a small bay within the Gananoque River system in South Eastern Ontario. Results from field observations showed that the bay population of Northern <b>Map</b> <b>turtles</b> appeared to be female biased. Use of habitat features differed by females, males and juveniles at different times throughout the summer (May-August). Females were frequently observed basking within the bay in May and June while {{males were more frequently}} observed throughout July and August. Nesting by female Northern <b>Map</b> <b>turtles</b> appeared to be concentrated atop small islands scattered throughout the bay. Nest sites were located within narrow bands of soils. The most prominent difference between site conditions at the monitored nests was soil moisture; this was likely the result of different soil materials at each site. Air and soil temperature did not differ significantly between sites. Additional research could be pursued on the bay population of Northern <b>Map</b> <b>turtles</b> looking at the following: movement patterns by females out of the bay post-nesting, genetic linkages to other satellite populations of Northern <b>Map</b> <b>turtles</b> in the Thousand Islands, hatchling success and sex composition, overall species health due to food availability and lastly the effects of anthropogenic stressors...|$|R

50|$|<b>Map</b> <b>turtles</b> {{are more}} {{carnivorous}} {{than most other}} members of the family Emydidae, and the northern <b>map</b> <b>turtle</b> is no exception. Adult females have wide heads and broad alveolar crushing surfaces in their mouths which they use to feed on molluscs, their primary prey, as well as insects and crayfish. Adult males are much smaller and have narrower heads and feed on smaller molluscs and insects. Like most other aquatic turtles, feeding always takes place in the water. In places where invasive molluscs such as zebra mussels and Asian clams (Corbicula fluminea) are abundant, they may become the most important food of female northern <b>map</b> <b>turtles.</b>|$|R
50|$|Average life {{expectancy}} of <b>map</b> <b>turtles</b> ranges from 15 to 100 years, depending on species.|$|R
50|$|In the Midwest, {{the false}} <b>map</b> <b>turtle</b> is {{a species of}} special {{interest}} in Ohio.|$|R
50|$|Until 2010, it was {{included}} in the Pascagoula <b>map</b> <b>turtle</b> (G. gibbonsi), which it resembles.|$|R

50|$|The black-knobbed <b>map</b> <b>turtle</b> (Graptemys nigrinoda), {{formerly}} known as the black-knobbed sawback, is a small to medium-sized aquatic turtle with light gray skin. Some of the most distinguishing characteristics of the black-knobbed <b>map</b> <b>turtle,</b> and the Graptemys genus, are the protruding “spikes” on the turtle’s carapace. This species inhabits mainly the fall lines of rivers in the Mobile Bay drainage, in Alabama and Mississippi.|$|R
40|$|Riverine turtle {{populations are}} declining {{worldwide}} {{and many of}} these species have been extirpated from large areas of their range. In Maryland, the northern <b>map</b> <b>turtle</b> (Graptemys geographica) occurs only in the lower Susquehanna River, which is the eastern edge of its range. The northern <b>map</b> <b>turtle</b> is a Maryland state endangered species and had not been seen in Maryland since the early 1990 &#x 2019;s. The Susquehanna River is divided by a hydroelectric dam and is heavily used for recreational activities, both of which may negatively impact turtles. To determine the status of <b>map</b> <b>turtles</b> in Maryland, we performed visual encounter surveys for basking turtles at 12 sites from April to November 2008. |$|R
50|$|This turtle is dormant around November {{through early}} April {{depending}} on local climactic factors. Northern <b>map</b> <b>turtles</b> spend the winter under water {{and do not}} surface to breathe, especially when ice cover makes this impossible. Adults rest on the bottom or wedged underneath rocks or logs and often hibernate communally with other northern <b>map</b> <b>turtles</b> where they may remain somewhat active. Hibernacula must be well oxygenated because, unlike some other turtle species such as painted <b>turtles,</b> <b>map</b> <b>turtles</b> need to absorb oxygen from the water to survive the winter. They are avid baskers and bask in groups. They are diurnal. They are also very wary animals; at {{the slightest hint of}} danger, they slip into the water and hide.|$|R
