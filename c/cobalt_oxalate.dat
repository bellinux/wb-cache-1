It is anticipated that solid phase catalysts have more practical applications than dissolved catalysts in water treatment. ^ The catalytic reactivity of two model di-carboxylic acids, oxalate and malonate, were compared in a series of laboratory experiments. In-situ attenuated total reflectance infrared spectroscopy indicated that oxalate formed an inner sphere complex and malonate formed an outer sphere complex with cobalt (II) oxide. ^ Catalytic ozonation was evaluated for removal of pCBA, a non-adsorbing model micropollutant that does not react directly with molecular ozone. Cobalt (II) oxide and a mixed metal oxide (copper and zinc oxide with a calcium aluminate binder) either did not change the removal or they inhibited the removal of pCBA in deionized water compared to ozone alone. ^ Alumina supported ruthenium also accelerated the removal of pCBA from a natural water, but it may follow a different catalytic reaction pathway.

40|$|Time-resolved {{investigations}} of condensed matter on an atomic scale level are nowadays indispensable to gain insights {{in the complex}} mechanisms of dynamic processes in physics and chemistry. Most of these processes {{take place at the}} surface of a metal, such as for example layer growth and corrosion phenomena or all catalytic applications. X-ray absorption spectroscopy {{is one of the most}} important investigation tools in this context. It allows resolving the local structure around a selected kind of element in the probed sample within the range of a few Angstroms by using the intense X-ray beams generated at modern synchrotron radiation sources. It is thus perfectly adapted to investigate systems with only a short range order as for example very thin layers or nanoparticles which are especially important for catalytic applications. Prerequisite for X-ray absorption spectroscopy are monochromators with perfect crystals that reflect only a certain energy determined by the incident angle. Time-resolutions of down to a few milliseconds for one spectrum are achievable with quick-scanning X-ray absorption spectroscopy (QEXAFS) using mechanics to rapidly oscillate the monochromator crystals. New technical approaches for the QEXAFS method are presented in this work as for example an angular encoder system to accurately measure the monochromator crystal angle and thus to obtain most accurate energy values for the measured spectra. The design of flexible driving mechanics is introduced and tested. The new mechanics allow arbitrarily adjusting the energy range of the spectra within few seconds leading to a more efficient application of QEXAFS and also new possible experiments. Moreover, a new fast and reliable data acquisition system is presented as well as new user-friendly data analysis software named T-REX to handle the thousands of spectra that are typically collected during each measurement. Several applications in the field of catalysis are presented where new insights in dynamic processes could be obtained using quick-scanning X-ray absorption spectroscopy. The Pd-catalyzed Heck reaction was studied as well as stable oscillations during the catalytic partial oxidation of methane on Pd/Al 2 O 3 catalysts, the oxidation and reduction behaviour of Cu/Al 2 O 3 catalysts at various temperatures and structural oscillations during the extinction of CO oxidation on a Pt/Al 2 O 3 catalyst.

The catalytic performance towards oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is comparatively investigated with electrochemical techniques of cyclic voltammogram, rotating disk electrode and rotating ring-disk electrode.

Among the studied Co-PPy-TsOH/C catalysts, that prepared with cobalt acetate exhibits the best ORR performance. The crystallite/particle size of cobalt and its distribution {{as well as the}} graphitization degree of carbon in the catalyst greatly affects the catalytic performance of Co-PPy-TsOH/C towards ORR.

The catalysts were studied in the steam reforming of ethanol to investigate {{the effect of the}} partial substitution of Co 3 O 4 with Fe 2 O 3 on the catalytic behaviour. The reforming activity over Fe 2 O 3, while initially high, underwent fast deactivation. In comparison, over the Co-Fe catalyst both the H 2 yield and stability were higher than that found over the pure Co 3 O 4 or Fe 2 O 3 catalysts. DRIFTS-MS studies under the reaction feed highlighted that the Co-Fe catalyst had increased amounts of adsorbed OH/water; similar to Fe 2 O 3. Increasing the amount of reactive species (water/OH species) adsorbed on the Co-Fe catalyst surface is proposed to facilitate the steam reforming reaction rather than decomposition reactions reducing by-product formation and providing a higher H 2 yield. © Copyright © 2012, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

40|$|Cobalt {{is a very}} {{important}} metal which is widely applied in various critical areas, however, it is difficult to recover cobalt from minerals since {{there is a lack of}} independent cobalt deposits in nature. This work is to provide a complete process to recover cobalt from cobalt tailings using the moderately thermophilic bioleaching technology and selective sequential extraction. It is found that 96. 51 % Co and 26. 32 % Cu were extracted after bioleaching for four days at 10 % pulp density. The mean compositions of the leach solutions contain 0. 98 g·L− 1 of Co, 6. 52 g·L− 1 of Cu, and 24. 57 g·L− 1 of Fe (III). The copper ion was then recovered by a solvent extraction process and the ferric ions were selectively removed by applying a goethite deironization process. The technological conditions of the above purification procedures were deliberately discussed. Over 98. 6 % of copper and 99. 9 % of ferric ions were eliminated from the leaching liquor. Cobalt was finally produced as <b>cobalt</b> <b>oxalate</b> and its overall recovery during the whole process was greater than 95 %.

LiNi 0. 8 Co 0. 2 O 2 cathodes were prepared using non-aqueous tape casting technique followed by sintering in air. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis of sintered LiNi 1 xCoxO 2 indicated that lithium evaporation occurs during heating. The lithium loss decreases {{with an increase}} of the cobalt content in the mixed oxides. The stability studies showed that dissolution of nickel into the molten carbonate melt is smaller {{in the case of}} LiNi 1 xCoxO 2 cathodes compared to the dissolution values reported in the literature for state-of-the-art NiO. Pore volume analysis of the sintered electrode indicated a mean pore size of 3 mm and a porosity of 40 %.

40|$|The {{important}} {{development of}} biogas plants requires {{the use of}} high performance new sensors to analyze the composition of the gas produced. They must be able to combine rapidity, reliability, and precision with an easy and inexpensive utilization. Such a sensor does not currently exist. Sensors based on the detection of a catalytically induced reaction are {{what seems to be the}} most promising possibility. There are a large number of active phases currently under study. This work focuses on cobalt systems. The active phases that we studied were made by the decomposition of <b>cobalt</b> <b>oxalate</b> in Ar, Ar/H 2 or Ar/O 2, giving us respectively a mix of CoO/Co, metallic Co or Co 3 O 4. The active phase was then put in a flow of methane or carbon dioxide, and the evolution of the composition of the flow was studied by MS measurements. If any change in the composition is observed, it is a proof that an interaction occurs between the active phase and the target gases. CoO/Co and Co 3 O 4 demonstrate such changes, proving that they are able to interact with the gases. They can even be reduced by methane, yielding carbon dioxide. Such a reaction could be the sign that the oxidation of methane on cobalt based catalyst follows a Mars-van Krevelen mechanism. However, we are still facing two difficulties: temperatures needed to evidence a reaction with methane can be quite high, and a good way to place the active phase on a micro-chip sensor is still needed. info:eu-repo/semantics/nonPublishe...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} was to {{synthesise}} and control a nanostructured composite of copper/cobalt. Both the copper and <b>cobalt</b> <b>oxalate</b> exhibit a nanostructure. Attempts to produce nanocomposite particles in the size range of 10 - 70 nm were made via an oxalate co-precipitation route followed by the appropriate thermal treatment to finally obtain the metal nanocomposite. Much attention was focussed on {{the understanding of the}} copper oxalate precipitation and its further transformation into metal before the investigation of the co-precipitation system. One major challenge of this thesis work was to achieve {{a better understanding of the}} copper oxalate precipitation mechanism. This was made by following kinetic parameters in order to shed light on the various steps of the precipitation from a supersaturated solution (nucleation, growth and aggregation of nanocrystals). Following the pH as a function of time and using the thermodynamic solubility data it was possible to propose a kinetic model of copper oxalate precipitation, with the co-precipitation of slight amounts (around 0. 40 % wt) of malachite (CuCO 3 ·Cu(OH) 2). The copper oxalate nanostructured particle growth mechanism, from the self-assembly of nanosized buildings blocks, was confirmed for intermediate precipitation times (1 - 15 minutes). Evidence for such organisation of the particles was shown by a combination of XRD diffraction, SEM and AFM measurements showing the presence of steps at the particle surface with a height that corresponds to a multiple of the mean crystallite size in that particular crystallographic orientation. Further investigations were performed for the early steps of the precipitation by SAXS but either the precipitated volume fraction was too low for detection of the particles or nucleation and growth kinetics were to fast (less than one second) to be followed. The TEM cross-section analyses showed a possible core-shell assembly mechanism. The core showed a random organisation of the crystallites with a size of around 25 nm, while the crystallite in the shell with a size of around 40 nm presented certain order along the 110 axis, particularly towards the particle surface. All these details provided the opportunity to propose a new and more detailed mechanism of the copper oxalate polycrystalline particle formation. In order to master the conditions of the Cu/Cu oxalate decomposition, a good understanding of the simple copper oxalate decomposition was necessary. All along this thesis, much attention was paid to the transformation of the copper oxalate cubic particles into the metal. The objective was thus to conserve the particles cubic macrostructure morphology and their internal nanoscale spatial organisation. To this goaltwo routes were investigated: a direct transformation and another, an indirect one, that required the formation of an oxide. Both the copper oxalate and the oxide showed an anisotropic behaviour during the transformation into the metal. It is shown experimentally that the anisotropy, nanostructure and inhomogeneity of the initial nanocrystallites of both the oxalate and the oxide have an important influence on the mechanism and evolution of transformation into the metal. The particle morphology was shown to be lost for a transformation yield of α> 0. 80 in the case of the direct transformation from the oxalate whereas the morphology was kept up to the metallic state when passing via the oxide. A kinetic model was proposed for both systems using the method of the sudden change in temperature and pressure. The kinetics analysis did not permit a total understanding of the transformations studied, as several stages were shown to have complex and concurrently competing mechanisms. However, a geometrical model was proposed using the ex-situ analysis of the samples as a function of the reaction yield for both routes. For the initial stages of the copper oxide reduction under He/H 2 atmospheres, the kinetic analysis showed hydrogen dissociation as a rate-limiting step. With a view to producing a cobalt/copper composite, preliminary experiments were carried out for the co-precipitation of the Co/Cu oxalate with different cationic ratios. Thermodynamic calculations showed the formation of the two solids was possible independent of the ratio Co/Cu. Experimentally, however a co-precipitation was obtained only for a ratio Co/Cu of 1, whereas for other ration only one single phase (either copper oxalate or <b>cobalt</b> <b>oxalate)</b> was formed. A second route was investigated using <b>cobalt</b> <b>oxalate</b> or cobalt oxide seeds. The amount of the cobalt detected by TEM in the precipitate using either the oxalate or from the oxide seeds was around 3 %wt, which is lower than the value of 10 %wt necessary to provide desired magnetic properties in the resulting precipitate. The exact nature and spatial distribution of the cobalt was not ascertained and further analysis of the nanostructure by TEM needs to be carried out to confirm the premise of the seed route. This thesis has shown that it is possible to get to a deeper understanding of the kinetics and the mechanism of the copper oxalate precipitation using the appropriate techniques. The cubic macrostructure can be conserved from the initial CuO nanoparticles (13 nm) to metallic Cu (42 nm) by a controlled transformation in a reducing atmosphere. Preliminary experiments made on the possible formation of a Co/Cu composite via the use of the cobalt oxide seeds as heterogeneous nuclei for the copper oxalate precipitation seems most promising...|$|E
40|$|The {{understanding}} of material self-assembling and self-organization mechanisms, at mesoscale, {{is crucial for}} nanotechnologies development. Such structures, hierarchically organized in superlattices or colloïdal crystals, are observed in inorganic or organo-metallic precipitates. The classical characterization, using electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction, of a synthesized powder is inadequate to describe the hierarchically organized polycrystalline structure of the final particles. Here, we have highlighted the successive steps {{that lead to the}} spontaneous formation of a <b>cobalt</b> <b>oxalate</b> dihydrate (COD) colloïdal crystals that precipitate in aqueous media. The characterization of the final particles, made by X-ray and electronic diffraction, has allowed us to determine the controversial crystalline phase of the precipitated COD. The β and γ COD phases has been discriminated by comparing experimental results with simulations of X-ray diffractogram and electron diffraction patterns for these both structures. The precipitated COD corresponds to the γ phase indicating that it comes from solid dehydration of <b>cobalt</b> <b>oxalate</b> tetrahydrate. The final powder characterization, performed by X-ray diffraction (XRD), atomic force microscopy (AFM), low voltage high resolution scanning electron microscopy (LVHRSEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM), gives some diverging results about monocrystalline or polycrystalline nature of the precipitates. XRD and AFM analysis show a polycrystalline structure of particles whereas LVHRSEM, TEM and electron diffraction observations indicate a monocrystalline structure. This apparent contradiction has led us to elaborate a new characterization method allowing to follow the growth and the structural evolution of the precipitate as a function of time. The cryo- preparation techniques are well adapted as they allow freezing and direct observation of solid state suspension by electron microscopy. The freeze/drying method has been modified and used for both SEM and TEM, and has allowed us to study the morphological and structural evolution of the COD precipitate from nanoscale to mesoscale. In addition, TEM analysis of samples prepared by classical techniques has been performed to complement cryo-electron microscopy observations. The combination of these two methods show that COD precipitation is a complex multi-step process leading to the formation of a core/shell heterostructure. The anisotropic core is porous and partially crystalline. It is formed by agglomeration of isolated primary particles and agregated ones (15 - 20 nm sized secondary particles). The crystalline shell corresponds to the final particles faces and is made up by the layer by layer self-assembling and alignment of 5 - 7 nm sized crystalline primary particles. These nanoparticles are aligned and perfectly ordered in strings of nanograins in the layer structure. The self-assembling occurs in the last step of growth where we have a lower ionic strength and supersaturation inducing slower kinetics of growth and aggregation. Moreover, the crystalline order in the primary and secondary particles increase with the time of reaction consistent with a continuous process of primary particle nucleation and growth. Our results show that self-assembling occurs layer by layer with terraces, kinks and steps that are present on the faces. This reminds the layer by layer crystalline growth models but in this case, the buiding blocks are colloïdal instead of atomic or molecular. Based on these different results, we propose an original model describing the COD precipitate growth. In addition, we have studied the poly(methacrylic acid-sodium salt) effect on the COD precipitation. This additive (PMMA) appeared {{to be a very good}} growth inhibitor. The PMMA effect on the final particles morphology is dramatic. Its concentration variation in solution slows down the nanoparticles aggregation rates along a [101] preferential direction. The crystal habit can then be controlled and we have synthesized platelets, cubes and rods with tailored length. The use of cryogenic electron microscopy has been shown to be a powerful tool for the {{understanding of}} time dependent aspects of particle growth. The use of such techniques for the study of other systems, where the final precipitate appearance may hide particle substructures, will help to elucidate growth mechanisms and allow finer control of nanostructured materials for many applications. The complex self-assembling and self-organization processes could then be highlighted and studied on a nanometer to micrometer scale...|$|E
40|$|This project {{focused on}} {{addressing}} {{the two main}} problems associated with state of art Molten Carbonate Fuel Cells, namely loss of cathode active material and stainless steel current collector deterioration due to corrosion. We followed a dual approach where {{in the first case}} we developed novel materials to replace the cathode and current collector currently used in molten carbonate fuel cells. In the second case we improved the performance of conventional cathode and current collectors through surface modification. States of art NiO cathode in MCFC undergo dissolution in the cathode melt thereby limiting the lifetime of the cell. To prevent this we deposited cobalt using an electroless deposition process. We also coated perovskite (La{sub 0. 8 }Sr{sub 0. 2 }CoO{sub 3 }) in NiO thorough a sol-gel process. The electrochemical oxidation behavior of Co and perovskites coated electrodes {{is similar to that of}} the bare NiO cathode. Co and perovskite coatings on the surface decrease the dissolution of Ni into the melt and thereby stabilize the cathode. Both, cobalt and provskites coated nickel oxide, show a higher polarization compared to that of nickel oxide, which could be due to the reduced surface area. Cobalt substituted lithium nickel oxide (LiNi{sub 0. 8 }Co{sub 0. 2 }O{sub 2 }) and lithium cobalt oxide were also studied. LiNi{sub x}Co{sub 1 -x}O{sub 2 } was synthesized by solid-state reaction procedure using lithium nitrate, nickel hydroxide and <b>cobalt</b> <b>oxalate</b> precursor. LiNi{sub x}Co{sub 1 -x}O{sub 2 } showed smaller dissolution of nickel than state of art nickel oxide cathode. The performance was comparable to that of nickel oxide. The corrosion of the current collector in the cathode side was also studied. The corrosion characteristics of both SS 304 and SS 304 coated with Co-Ni alloy were studied. This study confirms that surface modification of SS 304 leads to the formation of complex scales with better barrier properties and better electronic conductivity at 650 C. A three phase homogeneous model was developed to simulate the performance of the molten carbonate fuel cell cathode and the complete fuel cell. The homogeneous model is based on volume averaging of different variables in the three phases over a small volume element. This approach can be used to model porous electrodes as it represents the real system much better than the conventional agglomerate model. Using the homogeneous model the polarization characteristics of the MCFC cathode and fuel cell were studied under different operating conditions. Both the cathode and the full cell model give good fits to the experimental data...|$|E
