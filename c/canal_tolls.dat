He graduated from Dartmouth College in 1867 {{and went to work}} as a <b>canal</b> <b>toll</b> collector until 1870. That year, he began managing the Southern Ohio Coal and Iron Company. He became an investor in the National Manufacturing Company in 1882, buying it out with his brother by 1884 to form National Cash Register Company.|$|R
25|$|The Utica and Schenectady Railroad was {{chartered}} April 29, 1833; as {{the railroad}} paralleled the Erie Canal it was prohibited from carrying freight. Revenue service began August 2, 1836, extending {{the line of}} the Albany and Schenectady Railroad west from Schenectady along {{the north side of the}} Mohawk River, opposite the Erie Canal, to Utica. On May 7, 1844 the railroad was authorized to carry freight with some restrictions, and on May 12, 1847 the ban was fully dropped, but the company still had to pay the equivalent in <b>canal</b> <b>tolls</b> to the state.|$|E
25|$|In {{subsequent}} years, Stirling further {{expanded his}} activity and by 1802 {{he was paying}} 75% of the tonnage dues on the canal. Meanwhile, a redistribution of shares resulted in all the shares in the canal Company being {{in the hands of}} the firm of William Stirling & Sons (52) and Andrew Stirling personally (49). Andrew, John and James Stirling had made themselves the sole members of the Committee of Management and John and James—a majority of two votes out of three—increased the <b>canal</b> <b>tolls</b> to the maximum legally allowed. This led to litigation within the family, and also later from William Dixon, who had coal and iron works near the east end of the canal.|$|E
25|$|Railway {{competition}} {{began in}} 1836, when the Cheltenham and Great Western Railway proposed {{a line between}} Swindon and Cheltenham, via Gloucester. The canal company opposed the scheme, and received compensation of £7,500 from the railway company {{over the next four}} and a half years.. The line opened to Kemble in 1841, and the tolls on the carriage of materials for the railway's construction improved the financial position of the canal for a short time. The railway company was then taken over by the Great Western Railway, who built a new tunnel at Sapperton, and opened the railway to Gloucester in 1845. <b>Canal</b> <b>tolls</b> were cut, in an attempt to retain traffic, but toll revenue fell from £11,000 to £2,874 between 1841 and 1855. The Thames Commissioners were also in financial difficulties, and the Thames was nearly unnavigable from Oxford to Lechlade after 1855. In 1866, plans to convert the canal to a railway were rejected by Parliament, but the Thames Commissioners were replaced by the Thames Conservancy, and most of the river was soon returned to a navigable state.|$|E
25|$|With {{competition}} from the railways having taken {{a large share of}} traffic {{in the second half of}} the 19th century, improvements in roads and vehicle technology in the early part of the 20th century meant that the lorry was also becoming a threat to the <b>canals.</b> <b>Tolls</b> had been reduced to compete with the railways, but there was little scope for further reduction. The Regent's Canal and the Grand Junction Canal agreed that amalgamation and modernisation were the only way to remain competitive.|$|R
50|$|A trunk deck ship {{is a type}} of {{merchant}} ship with a hull that was stepped inward in order to obtain more favourable treatment under <b>canal</b> <b>toll</b> rules then in effect. As those tolls were set by net tonnage, a measure of volume, and as the tonnage rules did not account for all of the cargo space of such vessels, trunk deck ships incurred lower tolls than more conventional ships of equivalent capacity. When the measurement rules were changed, the type was no longer built.|$|R
50|$|In May 1874, Congress {{passed a}} bill {{allowing}} the Corps of Engineers to take full control of the canal and authorizing the Treasury {{to pay off the}} bonds for the recent improvements. By 1877, despite the vastly increased use of railroads, traffic on the canal had tripled from any previous level. This was mostly heavy, low-value industrial supplies such as coal, salt, and iron ore. In 1880, under political pressure from upriver producers, Congress removed the <b>canal's</b> <b>tolls</b> entirely, forgoing profit and paying the entirety of its expenses from the Treasury.|$|R
500|$|International Mercantile Marine {{submitted}} {{a bid for}} a ten-year contract for Kroonland and Finland to carry U.S. mail between New York and San Francisco after {{the opening of the}} Panama Canal. By law, only U.S.-flagged ships could carry U.S. mail under contract. It was also anticipated that U.S.-flagged vessels would receive preferential treatment for <b>canal</b> <b>tolls.</b> In a short ceremony aboard the liner in New York Harbor on 27 December 1911, the Belgian flag was lowered and the American flag was raised to the playing of [...] "The Star-Spangled Banner" [...] by the steamer's band, shortly before she sailed for Antwerp.|$|E
500|$|Most of {{the traffic}} along the canal transported coal from the many collieries that existed along its length, such as Outwood Colliery and Ladyshore Colliery. [...] Some of these pits were linked to the canal by road, and some by short tramlines. In the late 19th century as much as [...] of coal and [...] of other {{materials}} including night soil and fruit were transported annually. [...] The canal also enabled the transport of salt from Cheshire to the many bleach and dye works in its area – hence the name of Salt Wharf on the Bolton arm of the <b>canal.</b> <b>Tolls</b> were easily calculated as milestones were placed along the towpath at ¼ mile (400m) intervals. [...] This was important as journeys were often quite short, the collieries being so close to industry along the canal's length.|$|E
500|$|The first {{threat from}} a railway came in 1825, {{when there was}} a {{proposal}} for a line from Framilode Passage to Brimscombe Port. The <b>canal</b> <b>tolls</b> were reduced as a bargaining tool, but the promoters went ahead with their bill. The Stroudwater Company opposed it and it was defeated in Parliament. The Great Western Railway opened a line from Swindon to Gloucester in 1845, which passed through Stroud, but the effects on the canal were rather less than the effects on the Thames and Severn. However, in 1863 the Stonehouse and Nailsworth Railway Act was passed, allowing the construction of a railway from Stonehouse to Dudbridge and Nailsworth that directly competed with the canal. Dividends fell below 5 per cent after 1880 although they did not cease entirely until 1922. Around the same time the connection to the Severn at Framilode became blocked leaving the connection to the Gloucester and Sharpness Canal as the only link between the canal and the River Severn. [...] The last toll was paid in 1941, and most of the canal was formally abandoned by an Act of Parliament granted in 1954. Although this removed the need to maintain the waterway for navigation, the Company of Proprietors was not disbanded, and retained most of their other powers. It consists of those who now own the original shares, although over half of the shares were transferred to a Trust in the 1950s, which prevents hostile takeovers and ensures that the company will always be run {{for the benefit of the}} communities through which the canal passes. After the closure of the canal the canal company continued to generate income for many years through the sale of water and some monies produced by property holdings.|$|E

This paper focuses on the ability of Panama Canal management to extract additional toll revenues from United States grain traversing the Canal and the impact of increased toll rates on export grain flows. Analyses show toll rates established by a revenue-maximizing Canal management would exceed historical and current rates.

2500|$|Despite having {{enjoyed a}} privileged {{position}} for many years, the canal is increasingly facing {{competition from other}} quarters. Because <b>canal</b> <b>tolls</b> have risen as ships have become larger, some critics {{have suggested that the}} Suez Canal is now a viable alternative for cargo en route from Asia to the U.S. East Coast.

2500|$|The canal was 13m (43ft) {{wide and}} carried the Thames sailing barges common on both rivers. It was {{intended}} that the canal {{would be used for}} the transport of hops and other locally grown produce, {{but it was not a}} commercial success. It had locks at each end to protect the water level from tidal change, but the canal walls leaked and the water level dropped between every spring tide. A steam-driven pumping station was built [...] to rectify this. Complaints then came from barge-owners that the tunnel was slow to use, so in 1830 it was shut for two months while an open-air passing place was dug in the middle. This 100-yard long cutting divided the tunnel into a separate Higham tunnel and Strood tunnel. The <b>canal</b> <b>tolls</b> reflected these improvements, but if a boat missed the tide it would have to wait in the canal basin for longer than the journey round Hoo would have taken.|$|E
2500|$|With {{the threat}} of the {{railways}} taking trade from the canals, the Don Navigation Company decided to purchase the Barnsley Canal, and to lease the Dearne and Dove for a year, after which they would buy it. The agreement with the Dearne and Dove went ahead, with the River Don Navigation taking over the canal from 1 January 1846, and paying £210,000 for it on 2 January 1847, but they failed to reach agreement with the Barnsley <b>Canal.</b> <b>Tolls</b> were reduced by 60 per cent in 1846, with free passage for empty boats from 1847, with the result that much of the coal traffic which had previously used the Barnsley Canal now used the Dearne and Dove. The South Yorkshire, Doncaster & Goole Railway Company was authorised in 1847, and the Act of Parliament allowed them to amalgamate with the Don Navigation Company, and hence the Dearne and Dove, once they had raised half of their authorised capital. The amalgamation took place on 19 April 1850. The railway company opened their line from Doncaster to Swinton in November 1849, which was followed by a branch to Elsecar in February 1850, and another branch to Worsbrough in June 1850. At Elsecar, the canal basin was moved, and about [...] of the canal were filled in {{to make way for the}} railway. While the takeover was beneficial to traffic on parts of the Don Navigation, tonnage carried on the Dearne and Dove fell.|$|E
40|$|The Panama Canal {{has become}} a {{constraining}} factor on trade across the Pacific and Atlantic Ocean, {{and the expansion of}} the Canal is expected to have a positive influence on world trade. Our research investigates the competitiveness of the Panama Canal in the container shipping industry and the possible macroeconomic consequences of the canal expansion. We have designed a model that compares costs and earnings for single voyages and round-trips, and with a basis in opportunity cost theory we compare the Panama Canal with alternative routes and analyze the sensitivity of key variables for different scenarios. From our analyses we see that the current bunker price forces vessels to slow-steam to maintain profits. This has led shipowners to prioritize cost savings at the expense of fewer annual voyages. Simultaneously, operators in the container industry are constantly seeking to exploit large-scale advantages and we find strong evidence that the unit cost and the size of vessels are inversely proportional. This has led to a relentless upsizing of container vessels, and our calculations suggest that the expanded Panama Canal will face competition from the Ultra-Large Container Vessel segment. Further, our findings suggest that the current Panama <b>Canal</b> <b>toll</b> system with a constant price per TEU transited will not be applicable when opening for Post- Panamax vessels. Therefore, the Panama <b>Canal</b> <b>toll</b> system should be adjusted to facilitate for economies of scale in order for the Canal to stay competitive with alternative routes. As the world shipping market is still adjusting after the financial crisis in 2008, the expansion comes at an interesting point in time and the possible consequences are multidimensional. Our research suggests that the effects can be both positive and negative for shipowners depending on whether the expansion leads to an increase in tradable volume or a shift in existing trade. nhhma...|$|R
50|$|The link from Newport to Wappenshalll was crossed by a towpath bridge {{immediately}} before the junction. This {{is still in}} situ, and is a grade II listed structure. Nearby is a three-storey dock warehouse, which straddles {{a section of the}} canal. The first floor includes trap doors, which allowed goods to be hoisted up from the canal boats into the warehouse. It is also listed, and was built by George Sutherland-Leveson-Gower, the Earl of Sutherland, rather than the canal company, as was the basin. The Sutherland Estate also built a fine office for the <b>canal</b> <b>toll</b> clerk. It is a two-storey building, constructed of red bricks, with a central half-octagonal bay containing three sets of windows. A small community developed around the junction, as several cottages and the Sutherland Arms public house were built close by.

50|$|When {{the company}} could not pay the judgment, Randel, {{supported}} {{by the state of}} Delaware and especially the authorities of New Castle County, announced that he would attach the <b>canal's</b> <b>tolls.</b> The company had secretly told boat captains that they would pay their tolls either at the company's office in Pennsylvania, which was not legal according to the canal's charter. or at the Maryland end of the canal. This was an obvious subterfuge to avoid Randel attaching the tolls in Delaware, where he had been awarded the judgement. Nevertheless, the captains found themselves having to pay twice, one to the company, and a second time to Randel. Hundreds of the captains who refused to pay Randel's agent, William Linn Brown, were jailed by the local sheriff, and then bailed out by the company. The canal company, using two such captains as proxies, sued Randel, but the Delaware Superior Court found against them.|$|R
