25|$|New {{this year}} was a dual master-cylinder braking system and {{optional}} front disc brakes along with Rally II wheels. Also new for 1967 was an energy-absorbing <b>collapsible</b> <b>steering</b> <b>column.</b> Plus, Pontiac added an 8-track Stereo tape player.|$|E
25|$|One {{important}} {{research objective}} {{which could not}} be achieved with either cadavers or live humans was a means of reducing the injuries caused by impalement on the steering column. By 1964, over a million fatalities resulting from steering wheel impact had been recorded, a significant percentage of all fatalities; the introduction by General Motors in the early 1960s of the <b>collapsible</b> <b>steering</b> <b>column</b> cut the risk of steering-wheel death by fifty percent. The most commonly used animal subjects in cabin-collision studies were pigs, primarily because their internal structure is similar to a human's. Pigs can also be placed in a vehicle in a good approximation of a seated human.|$|E
25|$|The {{bodies are}} {{built around a}} control chassis, {{featuring}} a full roll cage, originally designed by PACE Innovations but which can be made, or partially made, by other accredited builders, including certain race teams. Many safety features are utilised to protect the driver {{in the event of}} a crash. The fuel tank is positioned in front of the rear axle to prevent it from being damaged or ruptured in a rear end impact. The driver is seated towards the centre of the car and extra reinforcement is used on the roll cage on the driver's side to lessen the risk of injury in a side-on collision. The cars also feature a <b>collapsible</b> <b>steering</b> <b>column</b> and a fire extinguisher system.|$|E
50|$|<b>Collapsible</b> <b>steering</b> <b>columns</b> {{were invented}} by Bela Barenyi and were {{introduced}} in the 1959 Mercedes-Benz W111 Fintail, along with crumple zones. This safety feature first appeared on cars built by General Motors after an extensive and very public lobbying campaign enacted by Ralph Nader. Ford started to install <b>collapsible</b> <b>steering</b> <b>columns</b> in 1968.|$|R
50|$|The 1967 Dart, {{along with}} all other 1967 Chrysler products, got a new dual-circuit brake {{hydraulic}} system to ensure loss of pressure in the front brakes would not prevent the rear brakes from working, and vice versa. The system also incorporated a brake system fault telltale on the dashboard. Other changes to comply with new federal safety laws included <b>collapsible</b> <b>steering</b> <b>columns,</b> additional padding on the dashboard and sunvisors. Shoulder belt anchors were also provided for front outboard occupants.|$|R
5000|$|In 1968, the {{precursor}} agency to the US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's first Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards took effect. These required shoulder belts for {{left and right}} front-seat vehicle occupants, side marker lights, <b>collapsible</b> <b>steering</b> <b>columns,</b> and other safety features. 1969 saw the addition of head restraints for front outboard passengers, addressing the problem of whiplash in rear-end collisions. These safety requirements {{did not apply to}} vehicles classified as [...] "commercial," [...] such as light-duty pickup trucks. Thus manufacturers did not always include such hardware in these vehicles, even though many did passenger-car duty.|$|R
25|$|The VAM Javelin saw {{considerable}} aesthetic {{changes with}} only minor technical ones. The VAM models included the same novelties as its AMC counterpart, {{such as new}} headlight bezels and grille, smooth front fender extensions and bumpers without divisions, larger tail lights without wraparound portions and a single central back-up light, larger side marker lights with both light and reflector sections in both amber and red, and new wheel cover designs resembling Magnum 500 wheels. The discontinuation of the central rear reflector {{in favor of the}} back-up light resulted in the addition of a fourth Javelin emblem placed on the right corner of the trunk lid. Two hood designs were available, the one with the Ram Air-type scoops at the front center, and a smoother one with the two rectangular stripped bulges. Despite this, no Ram Air system was ever offered for the car, at least at a factory level. In the interior, a new <b>collapsible</b> <b>steering</b> <b>column</b> with built-in ignition switch and anti-theft lock plus a new simulated two-arm three-spoke sports steering wheel with a central bulls eye emblem were present. A secondary anti-theft mechanism was present {{in the form of the}} floor-mounted shifters being linked to the ignition switch regardless of the transmission type. AMC's new dashboard design included full woodgrain surfaces, complete with a new center console and shifter design for the automatic transmission. However, all three gauges were still the same as in the previous two years. New door panels were also included.|$|E
500|$|The {{redesigned}} LS 400 interior received upgraded features, varying from dual-zone climate {{controls to}} rear cupholders. A newly patented seat cushion design, {{similar to the}} car's suspension, utilized lightweight internal coil springs and stabilizer bars to improve comfort. One of the first in-dash CD changers was offered as an option. Safety enhancements included enlarged crumple zones, three-point seat belts at all positions, and a new <b>collapsible</b> <b>steering</b> <b>column.</b> In Japan, the Toyota Celsior equivalents were offered in the same [...] "A", [...] "B", and top-spec [...] "C" [...] configurations as before, along with an additional selection of exterior colors. Several optional features, such as a compact disc-based Global Positioning System (GPS) navigation system and reclining rear seats, were available only in Japan.|$|E
2500|$|In 1967, the Corvair {{line was}} trimmed to the 500 and Monza Hardtop Coupes and Hardtop Sedans, and the Monza Convertible. This model {{year was the}} first with a <b>collapsible</b> <b>steering</b> <b>column.</b> A dual circuit master {{cylinder}} with warning light, nylon reinforced brake hoses, stronger steel (instead of aluminum) door hinges, [...] "mushroomed" [...] instrument panel knobs and a vinyl-edged day/night mirror were all made standard equipment. Bucket seats in Monza models were now of the same [...] "Astro" [...] style as those on the new-for-1967 Camaro, featuring a new-thin-shell design. [...] Chevrolet introduced a [...] engine warranty on all Chevrolet models including the Corvair. Chevrolet was still actively marketing the Corvair in 1967, including color print ads and an [...] "I Love My Corvair" [...] bumper sticker campaign by dealers, but production and sales continued to fall off drastically. Only 27,253 copies were built.|$|E
50|$|The 1967 {{model was}} {{redesigned}} with enhanced Coke bottle styling that featured Corvette-inspired {{front and rear}} fender bulges. The curves were the most pronounced with the 1967-1968 models. In keeping with federal regulations, safety features were built into Impalas during the 1967 and 1968 model years, including a fully <b>collapsible</b> energy-absorbing <b>steering</b> <b>column,</b> side marker lights, and shoulder belts for closed models. The L72 engine was not available in 1967, but a L36 Turbo-Jet V8 was optional.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Collapsible</b> universally jointed <b>{{steering}}</b> <b>columns,</b> {{along with}} <b>steering</b> wheel airbag. The steering system is mounted {{behind the front}} axle - behind and protected by, the front crumple zone. This reduces the risk and severity of driver impact or even impalement on the column in a frontal crash.|$|R
25|$|The 1967 {{model year}} {{also saw the}} {{addition}} of the new safety standards for passenger cars mandated by the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). The regulations began with seat belts on automobiles produced after March 1, 1967. The 1967 Rambler Americans also included a <b>collapsible,</b> energy-absorbing <b>steering</b> <b>column</b> and <b>steering</b> wheel, more padding on interior surfaces, 4-way hazard flashers, and locking seat back latches for 2-door models. The instrument cluster was changed from the previous rectangular design to round gauges: The speedometer and odometer was center, with twin, smaller fuel and engine temperature gauges, with matching warning-light pods {{on both sides of the}} speedometer.|$|R
2500|$|The 1967 models {{received}} a facelift. Large wraparound taillamps {{went into a}} new rear end with standard backup lights. [...] "What you'll see inside," [...] claimed the sales brochure for the 1967 Chevelle, [...] "will probably bring on a severe compulsion to go driving." [...] Front disc brakes were available on all models, and a new dual master cylinder brake system incorporated a warning light. [...] Chevrolet also added 14" [...] wheels and a three speed automatic transmission to their line of transmissions. New safety equipment became standard, including a <b>collapsible</b> <b>steering</b> <b>column.</b> The SS396 continued as its own series with both sport coupe and convertible body styles. The 375-horsepower 396-cubic-inch V8 was dropped from the options list {{until late in the}} model year and returned with 612 being sold. Seven transmissions were available: two manual three-speeds, two manual four-speeds, an overdrive three-speed, and two automatics. The manual-shift feature of the Turbo Hydra-Matic transmission was featured. Options included Superlift air shock absorbers, Strato-ease headrests, and special instrumentation.|$|E
2500|$|Continuing {{the concept}} of VAM's version of the AMC Rebel, the Mexican Matadors were only {{available}} as a single trim level and in four-door sedan and two-door hardtop forms in their initial year. The hardtop retained the Rambler Classic SST name while the four-door sedan changed from Rambler Classic 770 to Rambler Classic DPL. Both body styles saw the same features as the 1971 AMC Matadors and were almost equal with only few exclusive characteristics for each. Standard equipment consisted of four-wheel manual drum bakes, manual steering, [...] gross at 4600 RPM [...] I6 engine with Carter WCD two-barrel carburetor and 9.5:1 compression ratio, fully synchronized three-speed manual transmission with column shift, 10-inch heavy duty clutch, 3.54:1 rear differential gear ratio with manual transmission, 3.07:1 rear differential gear ratio with automatic transmission, electric two-speed wipers, electric washers, rectangular full-length 200km/h speedometer, electric analog clock, <b>collapsible</b> <b>steering</b> <b>column</b> with built-in ignition switch, luxury custom steering wheel, courtesy lights, cigarette lighter, dashboard ashtray, locking glove box, wide individual front seats (hardtop), front bench seat (sedan), two-point front seatbelts, front and rear side armrests, dual rear ashtrays, single round dome light (sedan), dual C-pillar dome lights (hardtop), dual coat hooks, bright molding package, luxury wheel covers, and driver's side remote mirror. Optional equipment included power drum brakes (standard with automatic transmission), power steering, heavy-duty suspension, automatic transmission, heater with front defroster, vinyl roof, remote-controlled driver's side mirror, passenger's side remote mirror, bumper guards, bumper tubes, and locking gas cap.|$|E
50|$|The <b>collapsible</b> <b>steering</b> <b>column</b> {{has been}} {{designed}} to protect the driver from injuries caused by striking the steering system in a crash. Consisting of two interlocking shafts, the <b>collapsible</b> <b>steering</b> <b>column</b> absorbs energy by collapsing inwards or breaking upon impact.|$|E
5000|$|The 1967 Chevrolet {{full-size}} was redesigned with enhanced Coke bottle styling. Dimensions remained {{roughly the}} same, still on a 119-inch wheelbase, four inches {{longer than the}} mid-size Chevrolet Chevelle. Impala Sport Coupes had a graceful fastback roof line, which flowed in an unbroken line into the rear deck. In keeping with federal regulations, safety features were built into Impalas during the 1967 and 1968 model years, including a fully <b>collapsible</b> energy-absorbing <b>steering</b> <b>column,</b> side marker lights, and shoulder belts for closed models. Most engine offerings were carryover from 1966 including the base 250 cubic-inch Turbo Thrift 6 (155 horsepower) and 283 cubic-inch Turbo Fire V-8 (195 horsepower), and optional 275-horsepower 327 cubic-inch Turbo Fire V-8 and 325-horsepower 396 cubic-inch Turbo Jet V-8, with a 385-horsepower 427 cubic-inch Turbo Jet V-8 now the top offering as the high-performance 425-horsepower version of the 427 offered in 1966 was not listed in the 1967 specifications. The two-speed Powerglide automatic was the only shiftless transmission offered with the 250 6 and 283 V-8, but the three-speed Turbo Hydramatic was now available with the 327 V-8 along with the big-block 396 and 427 V-8s.New options for 1967 included front-disc brakes (standard with the SS-427 option), stereo 8-track player, fiber optic light monitoring system and vacuum power door locks.Cloth-and-vinyl upholstery was standard in most closed body styles, but all-vinyl upholstery was a new option at extra-cost in several colors on all sedan and coupe body styles (heretofore all-vinyl trim was offered as an option on the Sport Coupe and Sport Sedan hardtop body styles in [...] "black" [...] only since 1963), and remained standard equipment on convertible and station wagon models, again in several colors. All Impala models for 1967 also featured upgraded door panels with carpeting on the lower section. A black four-door version of this vehicle, nicknamed [...] "Baby," [...] is featured prominently in the CW television show Supernatural. It is owned by Dean Winchester {{and has been in}} their family for over 40 years.|$|R

50|$|At its {{launch in}} 1972, the Square-body C/K-Series {{introduced}} two firsts in safety advancements concerning full-size pickups, and would later lead a third safety advancement in 1975. The {{first was the}} standard passenger-side sideview mirror, and the second was the energy-absorbing <b>collapsible</b> <b>steering</b> <b>column.</b> Patented by GM and already in use in its cars since 1967, the new energy-absorbing steering column was standard on all C-Series and K-Series models.|$|E
50|$|For the 1965 model year, the {{full-size}} Ford platform {{was given}} a redesign. To improve ride and handling, the rear leaf springs (a design unchanged since the 1949 Ford) were replaced by a three-link coil-spring design. To comply with federal safety mandates, in 1967 the full-size Fords were updated with a padded dashboard, recessed controls, <b>collapsible</b> <b>steering</b> <b>column</b> with padded steering wheel, and 3-point seatbelts; 1968 models gained side marker lights.|$|E
40|$|Several {{parts of}} {{automotive}} <b>steering</b> <b>columns</b> are fixed by both dimensional interference and mechanical-plastic sticking of one part to another. To determine {{the effect of}} these fixing procedures on the joints of <b>steering</b> <b>columns,</b> pull-out tests were performed. Samples with and without sticking were tested. The influence of the sticking and interference procedures on the integrity of the <b>steering</b> <b>columns</b> was experimentally determined by force-distance curves. The results suggested that the sticking increases more than twice the pull-out force and augments about 24 % the absorbed energy in the whole pull-out process. Statistical fitting tests show that pull-out forces obey a log-normal distribution. From these data were possible to estimate the structural reliability of joints of <b>steering</b> <b>columns,</b> which results indicate that the fail probability is close to zero for a minimum pull-out force of 2000 N. This work allows for knowing the importance of the sticking procedure in the fixation of automotive pieces, and establishing new standards for the assembly of <b>steering</b> <b>columns</b> in mechanical and statistical basis...|$|R
