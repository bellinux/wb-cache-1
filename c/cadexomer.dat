50|$|<b>Cadexomer</b> iodine was {{developed}} in the early 1980s in Sweden by Perstorp AB, and given the name Iodosorb. The product was shown to be effective in the treatment of venous ulcers,. More recently, it has been shown in studies in animals and humans that, unlike the iodophor povidone-iodine, Iodosorb causes an acceleration of the healing process in chronic human wounds. This is due to an increase in epidermal regeneration and epithelialization in both partial-thickness and full-thickness wounds. In this way <b>cadexomer</b> iodine acts as a cicatrizant.|$|E

40|$|PURPOSE: To assess vthe {{action of}} iodine <b>cadexomer</b> {{in the healing}} process of {{surgical}} wounds in rats and if cytotoxicity occurs with the systemic absorption of iodine. METHODS: Thirty six Wistar rats were used and performed 53 wounds with surgical punch of 6 mm diameter on them. Two lesions were made diametrically opposed on groups with distilled water (GAD) and sodium chloride (GCS); on the right lesions were used bandage with distilled water and on the left ones dressing with sodium chloride. In <b>cadexomer</b> iodine (GCI) group, a punch injury was made only {{on the left side}} and the dressing was carried out with <b>cadexomer</b> iodine. The groups were divided in two sub-groups according to the day of death (7 and 14). Microscopically was used H&E staining, through which the inflammation could be observed and also the neovascularization. Staining with Masson trichrome studied fibrosis. TSH and free T 4 were used for absorption recognition of iodine, and its toxic potential was performed before death with the animal anesthetized. RESULTS: Microscopic analysis showed more marked intensity of inflammation in group GAD, subgroup 14 days. Neovascularization showed be discrete in GCS sub-group 14 days. Fibrosis was more pronounced in the group GCI. Comparing the types of treatment, there was statistical significance between groups GCI and GCS (p< 0. 013). The TSH and T 4, showed no difference between the control group and GCI in relation to the absorption of iodine. In evaluating the GCI and control groups, within each treatment, statistical significance was found between them (p< 0. 001) when compared the days of observation.

40|$|Diabetic foot ulcers and {{infections are}} common and incur {{substantial}} economic burden for society, patients and families. We performed a comprehensive review, {{on a number}} of databases, of health economic evaluations of a variety of different prevention, diagnostic and treatment strategies in the area of diabetic foot ulcers and infections. We included English-language, peer-reviewed, cost-effectiveness, cost-minimization, cost-utility and cost-benefit studies that evaluated a treatment modality against placebo or comparator (i. e. drug, standard of care), regardless of year. Differences were settled through consensus. The search resulted in 1885 potential citations, of which 20 studies were retained for analysis (3 cost minimization, 13 cost effectiveness and 4 cost utility). Quality scores of studies ranged from 70. 8 % (fair) to 87. 5 % (good); mean_=_ 78. 4 %_+-_ 5. 33 %. In diagnosing osteomyelitis in patients with diabetic foot infection, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed 82 % sensitivity and 80 % specificity. MRI cost less than 3 -phase bone scanning + Indium (In) - 111 /Gallium (Ga) - 67; however, when compared with prolonged antibacterials, MRI cost $US 120 (year 1993 value) more without additional quality-adjusted life-expectancy. Prevention strategies improved life expectancy and QALYs and reduced foot ulcer rates and amputations. Ampicillin/sulbactam and imipenem/cilastatin were both 80 % successful in treating diabetic foot infections but the latter cost $US 2924 more (year 1994 value). Linezolid cure rates were higher (97. 7 %) than vancomycin (86. 0 %) and cost $US 873 less (year 2004 value). Ertapenem costs were significantly lower than piperacillin/tazobactam ($US 356 vs $US 503, respectively; year 2005 values). Becaplermin plus good wound care may be cost effective in specific populations. Bioengineered living-skin equivalents increased ulcer-free months and ulcers healed, but costs varied between countries. Promogran(R) produced more ulcer-free months than wound care alone (3. 75 vs 3. 41 months, respectively). Treatment with <b>cadexomer</b> iodine resulted in higher rates of healed ulcer (29 % vs 11 %) and lower weekly treatment costs (Swedish krona [SEK] 903 vs SEK 1421; year 1993 values) than standard care. Filgrastim decreased hospital stays, time to resolution and costs (36 % lower) compared with usual care. Adjunctive hyperbaric oxygen produced an incremental cost per QALY at year 1 of $US 27 _ 310 and $US 2255 at year 12 (year 2001 values). Overall, preventive strategies were shown to be cost effective and potentially cost saving. Various antibacterial regimens are cost effective but empiric choices should be based on local resistance patterns. MRI was cost effective compared with three-phase bone scanning + In- 111 /Ga- 67 but not against prolonged antibacterial therapy. Other innovations (becaplermin, bioengineered living-skin equivalents, filgrastim, <b>cadexomer</b> iodine ointment, hyperbaric oxygen, Promogran(R)) may be cost effective in this population but more studies are needed to confirm these findings.

40|$|Objectives: To review {{systematically}} {{the evidence}} {{on the performance of}} diagnostic tests used to identify infection in diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs) and of interventions to treat infected DFUs. To use estimates derived from the systematic reviews to create a decision analytic model in order to identify the most effective method of diagnosing and treating infection and to identify areas of research that would lead to large reductions in clinical uncertainty. Data sources: Electronic databases covering period from inception of the database to November 2002. Review methods: Selected studies were assessed against validated criteria and described in a narrative review. The structure of a decision analytic model was derived for two groups of patients in whom diagnostic tests were likely to be used. Results: Three studies that investigated the performance of diagnostic tests for infection on populations including people with DFUs found that {{there was no evidence that}} single items on a clinical examination checklist were reliable in identifying infection in DFUs, that wound swabs perform poorly against wound biopsies, and that semi-quantitative analysis of wound swabs may be a useful alternative to quantitative analysis. However, few people with DFUs were included, so it was not possible to tell whether diagnostic performance differs for DFUs relative to wounds of other aetiologies. Twenty-three studies investigated the effectiveness (n = 23) or cost-effectiveness (n = 2) of antimicrobial agents for DFUs. Eight studied intravenous antibiotics, five oral antibiotics, four different topical agents such as dressings, four subcutaneous granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF), one evaluated oral and topical Ayurvedic preparations and one compared topical sugar versus antibiotics versus standard care. The majority of trials were underpowered and were too dissimilar to be pooled. There was no strong evidence for recommending any particular antimicrobial agent for the prevention of amputation, resolution of infection or ulcer healing. Topical pexiganan cream may be as effective as oral antibiotic treatment with ofloxacin for the resolution of local infection. Ampicillin and sulbactam were less costly than imipenem and cilastatin, a growth factor (G-CSF) was less costly than standard care and <b>cadexomer</b> iodine dressings may be less costly than daily dressings. A decision analytic model was derived for two groups of people, those for whom diagnostic testing would inform treatment people with ulcers which do not appear infected but whose ulcer is not progressing despite optimal concurrent treatment - and those in whom a first course of antibiotics (prescribed empirically) have failed. There was insufficient information from the systematic reviews or interviews with experts to populate the model with transition probabilities for the sensitivity and specificity of diagnosis of infection in DFUs. Similarly, there was insufficient information on the probabilities of healing, amputation or death in the intervention studies for the two populations of interest. Therefore, we were unable to run the model to inform the most effective diagnostic and treatment strategy. Conclusions: The available evidence is too weak to be able to draw reliable implications for practice. This means that, in terms of diagnosis, infection in DFUs cannot be reliably identified using clinical assessment. This has implications for determining which patients need formal diagnostic testing for infection, on whether empirical treatment with antibiotics (before the results of diagnostic tests are available) leads to better outcomes, and on identifying the optimal methods of diagnostic testing. With respect to treatment, it is not known whether treatment with systemic or local antibiotics leads to better outcomes or whether any particular agent is more effective. Limited evidence suggests that both G-CSF and <b>cadexomer</b> iodine dressings may be less expensive than 'standard' care, that ampicillin/ sulbactam may be less costly than imipenem/ cilastatin, and that an unlicensed cream (pexiganan) may be as effective as oral ofloxacin. Further research is needed to ascertain the characteristics of infection in people with DFUs that influence healing and amputation outcomes, to determine whether detecting infection prior to treatment offers any benefit over empirical therapy, and to establish the most effective and cost-effective methods for detecting infection, as well as the relative effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of antimicrobial interventions for DFU infection. ...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Chronic wounds mainly {{affect the}} elderly and those with {{multiple}} health problems. Despite the use of modern dressings, some of these wounds {{take a long time}} to heal, fail to heal, or recur, causing significant pain and discomfort to the person and cost to health services. Topical negative pressure (TNP) is used to promote healing of surgical wounds by using suction to drain excess fluid from wounds. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of TNP on chronic wound healing. SEARCH STRATEGY: For this second update of this review we searched the Cochrane Wounds Group Specialised Register (December 2007), The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) - The Cochrane Library Issue 4, 2007, Ovid MEDLINE - 1950 to November Week 2 2007, Ovid EMBASE - 1982 to 2007 Week 50 and Ovid CINAHL - 1980 to December Week 1 2007. In addition, we contacted authors, companies, manufacturers, and distributors to identify relevant trials and information. SELECTION CRITERIA: All randomised controlled trials which evaluated the effects of TNP on people with chronic wounds. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Selection of the trials, quality assessment, data abstraction, and data synthesis were done by two authors independently. Disagreements were solved by discussion. MAIN RESULTS: Two trials were included in the original review. A further five trials were included in this second update resulting in a total of seven trials involving 205 participants. The seven trials compared TNP with five different comparator treatments. Four trials compared TNP with gauze soaked in either 0. 9 % saline or Ringer's solution. The other three trials compared TNP with hydrocolloid gel plus gauze, a treatment package comprising papain-urea topical treatment, and <b>cadexomer</b> iodine or hydrocolloid, hydrogels, alginate and foam. These data do not show that TNP significantly increases the healing rate of chronic wounds compared with comparators. Data on secondary outcomes such as infection rate, quality of life, oedema, hospitalisation and bacterial load were not reported. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Trials comparing TNP with alternative treatments for chronic wounds have methodological flaws and data do demonstrate a beneficial effect of TNP on wound healing however more, better quality research is neede...|$|E
40|$|Background: Pressure ulcers, {{also known}} as bedsores, decubitus ulcers and {{pressure}} injuries, are localised areas of injury to the skin or the underlying tissue, or both. A range of treatments with antimicrobial properties, including impregnated dressings, are widely used {{in the treatment of}} pressure ulcers. A clear and current overview is required to facilitate decision making regarding use of antiseptic or antibiotic therapies in the treatment of pressure ulcers. This review is one of a suite of Cochrane reviews investigating the use of antiseptics and antibiotics in different types of wounds. It also forms part of a suite of reviews investigating the use of different types of dressings and topical treatments in the treatment of pressure ulcers. Objectives: To assess the effects of systemic and topical antibiotics, and topical antiseptics on the healing of infected and uninfected pressure ulcers being treated in any clinical setting. Search methods: In October 2015 we searched: the Cochrane Wounds Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library), Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid MEDLINE (In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations), Ovid EMBASE, and EBSCOCINAHL Plus. We also searched three clinical trials registries and the references of included studies and relevant systematic reviews. There were no restrictions based on language or date of publication or study setting. Selection criteria: Randomised controlled trials which enrolled adults with pressure ulcers of stage II or above were included in the review. Data collection and analysis: Two review authors independently performed study selection, risk of bias assessment and data extraction. Main results: We included 12 trials (576 participants); 11 had two arms and one had three arms. All assessed topical agents, none looked at systemic antibiotics. The included trials assessed the following antimicrobial agents: povidone iodine, <b>cadexomer</b> iodine, gentian violet, lysozyme, silver dressings, honey, pine resin, polyhexanide, silver sulfadiazine, and nitrofurazone with ethoxy-diaminoacridine. Comparators included a range of other dressings and ointments without antimicrobial properties and alternative antimicrobials. Each comparison had only one trial, participant numbers were low and follow-up times short. The evidence varied from moderate to very low quality. Six trials reported the primary outcome of wound healing. All except one compared an antiseptic with a non-antimicrobial comparator. There was some moderate and low quality evidence that fewer ulcers may heal in the short term when treated with povidone iodine compared with non-antimicrobial alternatives (protease-modulating dressings (risk ratio (RR) 0. 78, 95...|$|E
