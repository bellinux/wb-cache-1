This work studies a {{numerical}} research undertaken {{to investigate the}} dynamic behaviors of porous squeeze film damper mounted a rotor considering longitudinal and transverse roughness effect under nonlinear suspension. The dynamic response of the rotor <b>center</b> and <b>bearing</b> <b>center</b> are studied. The analysis methods employed {{in this study are}} inclusive of the dynamic trajectories of the rotor <b>center</b> and <b>bearing</b> <b>center,</b> Poincaré maps and bifurcation diagrams. The maximum Lyapunov exponent analysis is also used to identify the onset of chaotic motion. The modeling results provide some useful insights into the design and development of rotor-bearing system for rotating machinery that operate in highly rotational speed and highly nonlinear regimes...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} aims {{to study}} a numerical analysis to investigate the dynamic orbits of a rotor supported by two turbulent journal bearings considering longitudinal and transverse roughness effect under nonlinear suspension. The dynamic response of the rotor <b>center</b> and <b>bearing</b> <b>center</b> are studied. The dynamic trajectories of the rotor <b>center</b> and <b>bearing</b> <b>center,</b> Poincaré maps, bifurcation diagrams and the maximum Lyapunov exponent method are employed to analyze dynamic responses in this study. The results show that either the longitudinal and transverse or the values of roughness parameters c 1 would not affect strongly nonlinear rotor-bearing system very much but the difference of dynamic response between considering with roughness effect and without roughness effect are very obvious. The modeling results provide some theoretical references for further researching of rotor-bearing system for rotating machinery that operate in highly rotational speed, especially it considers roughness effect, turbulent flow and nonlinear suspension of bearing system...|$|R

50|$|A {{torsion spring}} {{counterbalance}} system consists {{of one or}} two tightly wound up springs on a steel shaft with cable drums at both ends. The entire apparatus mounts on the header wall above the garage door and has three supports: a <b>center</b> <b>bearing</b> plate with a steel or nylon bearing and two end bearing plates at both ends. The springs themselves consist of the steel wire with a stationary cone at one end and a winding cone at the other end. The stationary cone is attached to the <b>center</b> <b>bearing</b> plate. The winding cone consists of holes every 90 degrees for winding the springs and two set screws to secure the springs to the shaft. Steel counterbalance cables run from the roller brackets at the bottom corners of the door to a notch in the cable drums. When the door is raised, the springs unwind and the stored tension lifts the door by turning the shaft, thus turning the cable drums, wrapping the cables around the grooves on the cable drums. When the door is lowered, the cables unwrap from the drums and the springs are rewound to full tension.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The {{hydrodynamic}} journal bearings-rotor {{system is}} a common machine element that is strongly nonlinear due to oil film forces. In this study, bifurcation of the response of an unbalanced bearings-rotor system with nonlinear suspension is investigated {{based on the assumption}} of an incompressible lubricant to-gether with the short bearing approximation. Theoretical bifurcation analysis of <b>bearing</b> <b>center</b> motion is carried out by means of numerical investigation, the procedure here being numerical integration. The six ma-jor parameters characterizing the theoretical model of the system are considered with nondimensional speed. Jump phenomena, subharmonic and quasi-periodic vibrations of the <b>bearing</b> <b>center</b> trajectory, are found in this system. It is concluded that the <b>bearing</b> <b>center</b> trajectory had undesirable nonsynchronous vibrations.

40|$|The {{design of}} a new {{electrodynamic}} bearing is often based on the intuition and experience of its inventor. This paper proposes general guidelines {{for the design of}} null flux electrodynamic <b>centering</b> <b>bearings</b> based on the interaction between a short circuited winding and permanent magnets. These design guidelines are deduced from an analytical analysis of the magnetic flux and forces in a bearing with a radial magnetic field and an arbitrary winding. Considering that the electromotive force in the winding should cancel when the rotor is centered and should appear as the rotor is off-centered, inducing a current in the winding and therefore a centering force on it, the design guideline is to have q=ppm 1 where q and p are the number of pole pairs of the winding and permanent magnets, respectively. This guideline is validated by FE simulations and some additional comments are made on the phase shift between the induced emf and current which maximizes the centering force on the bearing...|$|R
