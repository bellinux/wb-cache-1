40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} an auto-tuning scheme, {{based on a}} fuzzy logic controller (FLC), for a standardized inter-system cell reselection (IS-CR) algorithm in a multi-radio access technology network. FLC modifies IS-CR parameters {{to reduce the number}} of <b>call</b> <b>redirections</b> between technologies during the admission control stage based on network performance indicators. Experience shows that call establishment delay is thus greatly reduced. To validate the proposed scheme, a dynamic system-level simulator comprising GSM and UMTS radio access technologies has been developed. This simulator includes a joint radio resource management (JRRM) entity, whose parameters are tuned by the FLC. FLC tuning capabilities are checked out in an extreme, albeit realistic, scenario, where most traffic is unevenly distributed in space and technologies. Results show that <b>call</b> <b>redirections</b> in the admission control stage can be significantly reduced, while keeping connection quality almost unaltered at the expense of increasing changes between technologies during the cell reselection process.

Several protocol elements have been introduced to support common features such as <b>call</b> <b>redirection</b> and transfer performed at the endpoints. At the same time, real-world deployments have shown that intermediaries are commonly deployed in the network to provide advanced features. Conflicts between these protocol elements and intermediary application servers may lead to failure of operations and undesirable feature interactions.

The benefits include smooth interoperability of endpoint protocol elements and networkresident applications, and desirable overall service behavior. 1...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—In {{this paper}} we present “Casper, ” a process-based {{asynchronous}} progress solution for MPI one-sided communi-cation on multi- and many-core architectures. Casper uses transparent MPI <b>call</b> <b>redirection</b> through PMPI and MPI- 3 shared-memory windows to map memory from multiple user processes into the address space {{of one or}} more ghost processes, thus allowing for asynchronous progress where needed while allowing native hardware-based communication where available. Unlike traditional thread- and interrupt-based asynchronous progress models, Casper provides the capability to dedicate an arbitrary number of ghost processes for asyn-chronous progress, thus balancing application requirements with the capabilities of the underlying MPI implementation. We present a detailed design of the proposed architecture including several techniques for maintaining correctness per the MPI- 3 standard as well as performance optimizations where possible. We also compare Casper with traditional thread- and interrupt-based asynchronous progress models and demonstrate its performance improvements with a variety of microbenchmarks and a production chemistry application.

40|$|A Redirection Botnet (RBnet) {{is a vast}} {{collection}} of compromised computers (called bots) used as a redirection/proxy infrastructure and {{under the control of}} a botmaster. We present the design, implementation and evaluation of a system <b>called</b> <b>Redirection</b> Botnet Seeker (RB-Seeker) for automatic detection of RBnets by utilizing three cooperating subsystems. Two of the subsystems are used to generate a database of domains participating in redirection: one detects redirection bots by following links embedded in spam emails, and the other detects redirection behavior based on network traces at a large university edge router using sequential hypothesis testing. The database of redirection domains generated by these two subsystems is fed into the final subsystem, which then performs DNS query probing on the domains over time. Based on certain behavioral attributes extracted from the DNS queries, the final subsystem makes use of a 2 -tier detection strategy utilizing hyperplane decision functions. This allows it to quickly identify aggressive RBnets with a low false-positive rate (< 0. 008 %), while also accurately detecting stealthy RBnets (i. e., those mimicking valid DNS behavior, such as CDNs) by monitoring their behavior over time. Using DNS behavior as a means of detecting RBnets, RB-Seeker is impervious to the botmaster’s choice of Command-and-Control (C&C) channel (i. e., how the botmaster communicates and controls the bots) or use of encryption. ...|$|R
40|$|The two key {{resources}} in an IP Telephony network are the Internet Telephony Gateways (ITGs) and the IP network. These resources must be effectively managed to simultaneously provide good QoS to calls and maximize network resource utilization. This paper presents two main contributions. First, we design a call admission policy based on congestion sensitive pricing. As the load increases, this policy preferentially admits users who place a higher value on making a call while simultaneously maintaining a high utilization of network resources. We derive the function mapping congestion to {{price for the}} admission policy that maximizes revenue. Second, we design a <b>call</b> <b>redirection</b> policy to select the best ITG to serve the call. The policy balances load to improve network efficiency and incorporates QoS sensitivity to improve call quality. Simulation results show the following: (i) Congestion pricing based admission control lowers call blocking probability, increases provider revenue, and improves economic efficiency over a static flat-rate admission control scheme. (ii) Congestion sensitivity in the redirection policy balances load across all the ITGs while QoS sensitivity improves call audio quality. (iii) Incorporating price sensitivity in the redirection policy improves the economic efficiency, i. e., ensures that users who pay more get higher QoS. The techniques studied in this paper can be combined into a single resource management solution that can improve network resource utilization, provide differentiated service, and maximize provider revenue...|$|R
40|$|We {{present the}} TSW system (TestSystem Web), a web-based {{environment}} currently {{developed at the}} Rome 1 University, for the delivery of C programming exercises and their automatic correction. The core of the correction system automatically tests the student’s programs by applying unit-tests and/or by comparing the behaviour of the student’s code to a reference implementation. Care is taken to avoid error propagation from a function to other functionally depending procedures by redirecting the failing calls to the corresponding reference implementation. The system “instruments” the student’s code by using a code analyser and rewriter to handle instruction tracing and function <b>calls</b> <b>redirection.</b> The rewriter can be easily extended to develop other analysis instruments. As an example, we have developed: a code coverage tool that reports {{how much of the}} student’s code has been visited during the test, a cyclomatic complexity evaluator to compare the number of different logic paths in the code, a tracker for stack depth usage to check for proper implementation of recursive functions, a function/loop execution counter for the evaluation of the execution complexity. Additional care is taken to capture disruptive errors that would abort the program: “segmentation faults” caused by wrong pointer dereferentiation, and time-out caused by run-away processes. With these tools, the teacher can write rich unit tests that can either compare the behaviour of the function under analysis with a reference implementation (e. g. by generating random input and comparing the results), or by submitting well-crafted special inputs to elicit special cases or by comparing the complexity and/or stack depth counters. Each test applied will then explain to the student what was the problem found. TSW is the core component of a future larger social knowledge project, in which students will cooperatively/competitively participate to the definition and test of each-other’s programs, sharing ideas and learning from each other...|$|R

40|$|In particular, {{this report}} {{identifies}} specific policy decisions that caused state agency FY 2003 budgets {{to be above}} or below what can {{be accounted for by}} inflation and population growth. The budget is a policy document that reflects priorities. By studying changes in the budget, one is able to pinpoint changes in policy priorities. To get at the effect of policy changes on the budget, it is necessary to define a "Baseline" budget. A Baseline budget is defined as a budget that reflects inflation and population growth (i. e., would maintain constant real per capita spending). In other words, a Baseline budget is one that grows as fast as the increase in the cost of living and the increase in the population being served. Thus, in this report, we identify specific policy decisions that caused state agency general fund budgets to be above or below the Baseline. The next section of this report contains a comparison of the budgets for FY 1991 and FY 2003, followed by a short discussion of a budget reform implemented in FY 1997 <b>called</b> "budget <b>redirection.</b> " A FY 2003 Baseline budget is then calculated using FY 1991 as a base year.

5000|$|One of {{the early}} critics of Indigenismo in Mexico was Mexican {{anthropology}} Guillermo Bonfil Batalla (1935-1991).

Along with other Mexican anthropologists Bonfil Batalla criticized Indigenismo's attempt to [...] "incorporate the Indian, that is, de-Indianize him" [...] and {{trying to create a}} mestizo national identity. Instead, Bonfil Batalla called for a pluri-national state of co-existence where diverse cultural groups that can pursue their own goals free of impositions from Western culture. In January 1971, Bonfil Batalla and other anthropologists, including Darcy Ribiero and Stefano Varese, met in Barbados and released a Declaration that <b>called</b> for a <b>redirection</b> of the roles of the government, religious organizations, and anthropologists in their relationships with indigenous groups. The redirection involved a respect for indigenous culture and transferring power and authority over indigenous community development to the indigenous communities.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the late}} seventies, Ed Diener began to express {{dissatisfaction with the}} current deindividuation hypothesis, which he deemed invalid without {{specific}} focus on the psychological processes that yield a deindividuated state. Not only was Zimbardo's model deficient in that respect, but the role of his input variables in causing anti-normative behaviors was not uniform. Consequently, Diener {{took it upon himself}} to refine Zimbardo's model by specifying further the internal processes which lead to deindividuation. In 1980, he argued that paying attention to one's personal values through self-awareness increases the ability of that person to self-regulate. In a group context, when attention is distributed outward (in line with this model) away from the self, the individual loses the ability to plan his actions rationally and substitutes planned behaviors with a heightened responsiveness to environmental cues. Thus, according to Diener, the reduction of self-awareness is the [...] "defining feature of deindividuation". Diener proposed that the strict focus on anonymity as the primary factor of deindividuation had created an empirical obstacle, <b>calling</b> for a <b>redirection</b> of empirical research on the topic.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In this paper, {{we present}} a novel control-oriented model for {{predicting}} wake effects in wind plants, <b>called</b> the FLOw <b>Redirection</b> and Induction Dynamics (FLORIDyn) model. The model predicts the wake locations and the effective flow velocities at each turbine, and the resulting turbine electrical energy productions, {{as a function of}} the control degrees of freedom of the turbines (the axial induction and the yaw angle of the different rotors). The model is an extension of a previously presented static model (FLORIS). It includes the dynamic wake propagation effects that cause time delays between control setting changes and the response of downstream turbines. These delays are associated with a mass of air in the wake taking some time to travel from one turbine to the next, and the delays are dependent on the spatially- and time-varying state of the wake. The extended model has a state-space structure combined with a nonlinear feedback term. While including the control-relevant dynamics of the wind plant, it still has a relatively small amount of parameters, and the computational complexity of the model is small enough such that it has the potential to be used for dynamic optimization of the control reference signals for improved wind plant control. 1...|$|R

30|$|Although BC is {{the most}} {{investigated}} disease site (Hirsch et al. 2013), {{it is also an}} area of research associated with one of the highest rates of drug attrition and trial failure (Begley and Ellis 2012; Hutchinson and Kirk 2011). Presently, anti-angiogenic agent trials (n =  49, 17.5  %) comprise almost a fifth of all ongoing research, and the total number of these trials is comparable the sum of all ET directed research (n =  52, 18.6  %). Clinical testing of anti-angiogenics in BC has been marked by failure to demonstrate clinically significant PFS and survival benefits and an increased risk of serious side effects (Miles et al. 2010; Robert et al. 2011; Hamburg 2011; Barrios et al. 2010; Baselga et al. 2012 d; Mackey et al. 2013). Despite this, as of September 2013, a total of 25, 784 patients were accrued to current anti-angiogenic trials, with planned accrual of an additional 3833 patients across 12 trials. A 2006 survey of leading developers estimates that the cost of enrolling a patient into a phase III trial is $ 26, 000 (lifesciences world 2006; Stewart et al. 2010). Given these figures, the investment directed toward anti-angiogenic research has amounted to a staggering $ 770, 042, 000. As the hope of success continues to entice patients and clinicians alike to fully explore the benefits of a given class of therapy, prudence would <b>call</b> for a <b>redirection</b> of resources towards classes of agents that have demonstrated therapeutic benefit or for which a biomarker is available to guide therapy. This is best exemplified in the recent discovery of the 14 -gene signature to identify immune-enriched patients who preferentially respond to trastuzumab therapy (Perez et al. 2014).|$|R
40|$|Leisure {{shopping}} expanded enormously {{over the}} course of the twentieth and into the twenty-first century, and shopping now monopolises most Western cities and structures the everyday lives of the people that live in them. This development has entrenched consumer capitalism (along with its ethos of exponential growth) as the only viable socio-economic model, even as its chronic problems of environmental, social, and economic unsustainability continue to grow. This thesis approaches this thorny problem from a fresh perspective, that of leisure shopping as a fundamentally embodied practice, and the phenomenological relation between shopper and city that this embodied practice generates. The thesis argues that, while the practice of leisure shopping can certainly arouse a raft of experiential and aesthetic pleasures, insofar as shopping is responsible for environmental degradation and social injustice, its aesthetic pleasures are also ethically compromised. It proposes that this gap between the ethics and aesthetics of shopping can, nevertheless, be bridged, and the aesthetics of shopping redirected to ethical effect. It investigates ways of building this bridge by drawing on the two correspondingly contradictory methodologies of phenomenology and Situationism, and applying them to the practice of leisure shopping. Through these means, it shows how the model of shopping imposed by consumer capitalism can be redirected to generate a sustainable model of shopping. One that both resists and transcends the consumption imperative and, as such, meets key criteria for the three-fold model of environmental, social, and economic sustainability, otherwise known as the ‘three pillars’ model. As arch anti-consumerists with a neo-Marxist agenda, the Situationists were ideologically biased and committed to socio-political change through revolution. Phenomenology, on the other hand, strives to set aside all bias and intention, and concentrate instead on an ideologically impartial study of first person experience. While these two methods approach their respective fields of operation with very different attitudes, they are both self-reflective practices that prioritise first person experience. By drawing them together and weaving them into a hybrid method, this thesis also constructs a self-reflective methodology. In this instance, however, the impartiality of phenomenology constrains the political bias of Situationism to generate a method of ‘checks and balances’. Through this thesis, I detail this method and explain how I applied it to conduct four shopping experiments in Melbourne city’s retail heartland. In the process, I unpack how these experiments enabled me to access leisure shopping in unusual ways and work fruitfully with both its problems and its pleasures. This approach to the research has proceeded on the basis that the two main discourses that have informed the consumption debate to date – the pro-consumption aesthetic pleasures analysis and the anti-consumption neo-Marxist ethical critique – are theoretical extremes that have been locked in a stalemate of mutual oversight and denial for too long. As a result, they have hindered rather than helped the contemporary sustainability discourse in its drive to find practical solutions to the overconsumption that leisure shopping epitomises. By analysing the outcomes of the four experiments through both discourses, and bringing the insights of each to bear critically on the oversights of the other, the thesis overcomes this stalemate and describes, instead, an alternate practice of leisure shopping that is both aesthetically pleasurable and ethically sound. In view of the anti-consumption critique’s cornerstone claim that leisure shopping is, at best, a complete ethical void and, at worst, a deadly aesthetic siren <b>call,</b> this <b>redirection</b> of the aesthetics of shopping to ethical effect is a significant and original outcome of the research...|$|R
