25|$|The G20's {{transparency}} and accountability have been questioned by critics, who <b>call</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> absence of a formal charter {{and the fact that}} the most important G20 meetings are closed-door. In 2001, the economist Frances Stewart proposed an Economic Security Council within the United Nations as an alternative to the G20. In such a council, members would be elected by the General Assembly based on their importance to the world economy, and the contribution they are willing to provide to world economic development.|$|E
25|$|When in 1920 the {{informal}} white-line printmakers' group organized its own exhibition, Weinrich showed a dozen works, including one called Cows Grazing in the Dunes near Provincetown. This print shows greater tendency to abstraction than eitherBroken Fence or the prints made by other Provincetown {{artists of the}} time. The cows and dunes are recognizable but not presented realistically. The white lines serve to emphasize the blocks of muted colors which are the print's main pictorial elements. Weinrich uses {{the texture of the}} wood surface to <b>call</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> two-dimensional plane—the paper on which she made the print—in contrast with the implicit depth of foreground and background of cows, dunes, and sky. While the work is not Cubist, it has a proto-Cubist feel {{in a way that is}} similar to some of the more abstract paintings of Paul Cézanne.|$|E

25|$|There {{were major}} changes {{following}} World War II. In the late 1950s and early 1960s, Harlem {{was the scene}} of a series of rent strikes by neighborhood tenants, led by local activist Jesse Gray, together with the Congress of Racial Equality, Harlem Youth Opportunities Unlimited (HARYOU), and other groups. These groups wanted the city to force landlords {{to improve the quality of}} housing by bringing them up to code, to take action against rats and roaches, to provide heat during the winter, and to keep prices in line with existing rent control regulations. The largest public works projects in Harlem in these years were public housing, with the largest concentration built in East Harlem. Typically, existing structures were torn down and replaced with city-designed and managed properties that would, in theory, present a safer and more pleasant environment than those available from private landlords. Ultimately, community objections halted the construction of new projects. From the mid-20th century, the low quality of education in Harlem has been a source of distress. In the 1960s, about 75% of Harlem students tested under grade levels in reading skills, and 80% tested under grade level in math. In 1964, residents of Harlem staged two school boycotts to <b>call</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> problem. In central Harlem, 92% of students stayed home. In the post-World War II era, Harlem ceased to be home to a majority of the city's blacks, but it remained the cultural and political capital of black New York, and possibly black America.|$|E

500|$|Feminist {{economics}} <b>call</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{importance of}} non-market activities, such as childcare and domestic work, to economic development. This stands {{in sharp contrast}} to neoclassical economics where those forms of labor are unaccounted for as [...] "non-economic" [...] phenomena. Including such labor in economic accounts removes substantial gender bias because women disproportionately perform those tasks. When that labor is unaccounted for in economic models, much work done by women is ignored, literally devaluing their effort.|$|E

500|$|Feminist economists <b>call</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> social {{constructions of}} {{traditional}} economics, questioning {{the extent to}} which it is positive and objective, and showing how its models and methods are biased by an exclusive attention to masculine-associated topics and a one-sided favoring of masculine-associated assumptions and methods. While economics traditionally focused on markets and masculine-associated ideas of autonomy, abstraction and logic, feminist economists call for a fuller exploration of economic life, including such [...] "culturally feminine" [...] topics such as family economics, and examining the importance of connections, concreteness, and emotion in explaining economic phenomena. Inclusion of such topics has helped create policies that have reduced gender, racial, and ethnic discrimination and inequity, satisfying normative goals central to all economics.|$|E
500|$|During the 1920s and 1930s many skyscrapers were {{designed}} in an Art Deco style. This architectural approach typically combined what Carol Willis terms an [...] "aesthetic of simple, sculptural mass" [...] {{with the use}} of rich colour and ornamentation on the surfaces of the buildings. The aim was to <b>call</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> increasingly complex three-dimensional shape of the skyscraper, in contrast to earlier styles which could be critiqued, as historian Larry Ford suggests, as being merely [...] "short buildings made taller with additional stories". Windows were de-emphasised in favour of creating a strong sense of shape and mass, the surrounding walls treated as textured fabric, dressing the building underneath. Skyscrapers of this period typically lost their ornamental horizontal divisions, being broken up by physical changes in their shape as one looked up the building, the whole forming a striking silhouette.|$|E
500|$|Many feminists call {{attention}} to value judgments in economic analysis. This idea {{is contrary to the}} typical conception of economics as a positive science held by many practitioners. For example, Geoff Schneider and Jean Shackelford suggest that [...] "the issues that economists choose to study, the kinds of questions they ask, and the type of analysis undertaken all are a product of a belief system which is influenced by numerous factors, some of them ideological in character." [...] Similarly, Diana Strassmann comments, [...] "All economic statistics are based on an underlying story forming the basis of the definition. In this way, narrative constructions necessarily underlie all definitions of variables and statistics. [...] Therefore, economic research cannot escape being inherently qualitative, regardless of how it is labeled." [...] Feminist economists <b>call</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> value judgements in all aspects economics and criticize its depiction of an objective science.|$|E
