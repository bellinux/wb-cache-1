40|$|Building {{information}} modeling (BIM) {{has been}} used in high-profile and complex projects in several countries such as America, United Kingdom (UK), China, Hong Kong, and Australia. Currently, BIM is also used by Architecture, Engineering and Construction (AEC) industry in Malaysia. It has been introduced to manage <b>construction</b> <b>planning</b> activities such as design, cost estimating and project scheduling. BIM utilization in <b>construction</b> <b>planning</b> can detect any clash analysis during design phase, improves project schedule, cost and quality of project as well as communication between construction players. This paper aims to explore BIM application in <b>construction</b> <b>planning.</b> A literature review explores previous BIM studies on definition of BIM, benefits, importance, barriers and BIM tools in <b>construction</b> <b>planning.</b> Furthermore, a semi-structured interview was made with client of the first Malaysian project using BIM. The interview reveals on necessities and benefits of implementing BIM in <b>construction</b> <b>planning</b> as well as challenges faced by the client in implementing BIM. BIM is necessary to <b>construction</b> <b>planning</b> because BIM can detect problems before and during construction phase. A critical analysis of the literature review and the interview results lead to a solid reason of showing the effectiveness of implementing BIM in <b>construction</b> <b>planning.</b> It also show that BIM in <b>construction</b> <b>planning</b> helps to reduce project delay, risk, cost overrun, clash analysis and disputes between construction players...|$|R

5|$|Before {{settlers}} arrived, {{the land}} that became known as Forest Park was covered by a Douglas-fir forest. By 1851, its acreage had been divided into donation land claims filed by settlers with plans to clear the forest and build upon the property. After logging, the steep slopes and unstable silt loosened by heavy rains caused landslides that defeated <b>construction</b> <b>plans,</b> and claims were defaulted or donated to the city.|$|E
5|$|School resumed on September 5, 1927, and, for the 1927–1928 school year, {{was held}} in the {{community}} hall, township hall, and two retail buildings. Most of the students returned. The board appointed O. M. Brant of Luther, Michigan, to succeed Huyck as superintendent. The Lansing architect Warren Holmes donated <b>construction</b> <b>plans,</b> and the school board approved the contracts for the new building on September 14. On September 15, Michigan's Republican U.S. Senator James J. Couzens presented his personal check for $75,000 (roughly $ in today's money) to the Bath construction fund to build the new school.|$|E
5|$|The {{site was}} {{designed}} in January and February 1943 by engineers from the Peenemünde research facility and the Organisation Todt. On 25 March 1943 the <b>construction</b> <b>plans</b> {{were presented to}} Hitler, who immediately gave the go-ahead for the project to begin. The construction firm Holzman & Polanski was awarded the contract and 6,000 workers from Building Battalion 434 started construction that same month using plans by Franz Xaver Dorsch, Construction Director at the Organisation Todt. It was envisaged that the structure would be ready {{by the end of}} July 1943, though not its wiring and plant, and it was intended that it would be fully operational by 1 November 1943.|$|E

5|$|The {{miniature}} city project involved {{students from}} eighteen Springfield public high schools. The students, who were learning construction and handicraft, built {{the city of}} about 1,200 structures {{under the supervision of}} their teachers. It consisted of 1,000 miniature houses, in several neighborhoods, and 200 other structures. The miniature buildings and houses were built according to standard <b>construction</b> <b>plans,</b> and lumber and building-materials companies donated items for the project. The buildings and homes were landscaped with real grass. Their interiors were furnished and decorated like a full-sized house or building. The buildings were scaled at one-half inch to the foot. Tiny Town, with water mains and electric lights, was laid out on streets like a real city.|$|E
5|$|The {{road was}} {{originally}} designed to carry approximately 9,000 vehicles per day, and the original <b>construction</b> <b>plans</b> provided for subsequent conversion of the road into a four-lane motorway. In 1971, as the road gradually became congested, the plans to build the motorway on the route were approved by the Parliament of the Socialist Republic of Croatia. Unlike the other two motorway plans approved by the Croatian government, ZagrebSplit and ZagrebRijeka, which were cancelled after {{the suppression of the}} Croatian Spring, the ZagrebBelgrade motorway plans remained in place and an expansion of the existing motorway into a dual-carriageway, six-lane motorway with exclusively grade-separated intersections proceeded. The additional carriageway was to be built south of the existing road, which was in turn to be widened to accommodate two traffic lanes and an emergency lane.|$|E
5|$|Campaigning on a {{platform}} of progressive reforms, McCreary defeated Republican Edward C. O'Rear in the general election. During this second term, he became the first inhabitant of the state's second (and current) governor's mansion; he is also the only governor to have inhabited both the old and new mansions. During his second term, he succeeded in convincing the legislature to make women eligible to vote in school board elections, to mandate direct primary elections, to create a state public utilities commission, and to allow the state's counties to hold local option elections {{to decide whether or not}} to adopt prohibition. He also realized substantial increases in education spending and won passage of reforms such as a mandatory school attendance law, but was unable to secure passage of laws restricting lobbying in the legislative chambers and providing for a workers' compensation program. McCreary was one of five commissioners charged with overseeing construction of the new governor's mansion and exerted considerable influence on the <b>construction</b> <b>plans.</b> His term expired in 1915, and he died three years later. McCreary County was formed during McCreary's second term in office and was named in his honor.|$|E

40|$|The {{fact that}} {{traditional}} price/cost models are {{unrelated to the}} construction process renders them largely unsuited to the provision of meaningful price/cost advice. The nature and lengthiness of the <b>construction</b> <b>planning</b> process has precluded its incorporation into price/cost modelling during the pre-tender phase of the traditional building procurement process. The nub of the modelling problem has been how to integrate the complex process of <b>construction</b> <b>planning</b> into the pre-tender price/cost modelling process. In this paper the authors propose the synthesis of artificial intelligence techniques and <b>construction</b> <b>planning</b> techniques, resulting in a conceptual framework for a network-based cost modelling system for use by quantity surveyors in the cost modelling of buildings...|$|R
