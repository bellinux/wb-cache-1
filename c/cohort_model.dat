The second suggests that the culmination of knowledge, experience, and vocabulary with age results in a similar situation where many connections between a diverse vocabulary and diverse knowledge also increases the difficulty of successful retrieval of a word from memory.|$|E

40|$|Cohort {{effects are}} {{important}} factors in determining the evolution of human mortality for certain countries. Extensions of dynamic mortality <b>models</b> with <b>cohort</b> features have been proposed in the literature to account for these factors under the generalised linear modelling framework. In this paper we approach the problem of mortality <b>modelling</b> with <b>cohort</b> factors incorporated through a novel formulation under a state-space methodology. In the process we demonstrate that cohort factors can be formulated naturally under the state-space framework, {{despite the fact that}} cohort factors are indexed according to year-of-birth rather than year. Bayesian inference for <b>cohort</b> <b>models</b> in a state-space formulation is then developed based on an efficient Markov chain Monte Carlo sampler, allowing for the quantification of parameter uncertainty in <b>cohort</b> <b>models</b> and resulting mortality forecasts that are used for life expectancy and life table constructions. The effectiveness of our approach is examined through comprehensive empirical studies involving male and female populations from various countries. Our results show that cohort patterns are present for certain countries that we studied and the inclusion of cohort factors are crucial in capturing these phenomena, thus highlighting the benefits of introducing <b>cohort</b> <b>models</b> in the state-space framework. Forecasting of <b>cohort</b> <b>models</b> is also discussed in light of the projection of cohort factors. Comment: 41 pages, 12 figure...|$|R
5000|$|The <b>cohort</b> <b>model</b> {{is based}} on the concept that {{auditory}} or visual input to the brain stimulates neurons as it enters the brain, rather than {{at the end of a}} word.

[...] Findings such as these led Marslen-Wilson to propose the <b>cohort</b> <b>model</b> in 1987.|$|E

Several algorithms have been proposed for the selection of <b>cohort</b> <b>models</b> to form a background model.

Several normalization methods are also compared.

40|$|A novel {{framework}} for text-independent speaker verification is proposed. The framework {{is based on}} a new interpretation of Universal Background Model. The UBM in our framework actually defines a transform which maps the variable length observation into a fixed dimensional supervector(supervector space). Each speech utterance is then mapped into a point in this supervector space. The similarity measure in this vector space is progressively refined via an iterative <b>cohort</b> <b>modeling</b> scheme. The experiments on NIST 2002 corpus show the effectiveness of this new framework. Overall the EER drops from the baseline system(with T-Norm) 9. 21 % to final improved system(without T-Norm) 8. 07 %. The new framework can effectively reduce the data dependence in the final output score which is clearly indicated in the second sets of experiments. The EER after T-Norm of final system marginally increases by relatively 1. 73 % compared to the EER of baseline system drops 16. 12 % relatively after T-Norm. Also, the relative improvement of DCF after T-Norm is marginal for the final improved system (2. 47 %) compared to 33. 68 % in baseline system. It clear shows that the iterative <b>cohort</b> <b>modeling</b> effectively reduce the data dependence of the final scores, so that T-Norm will not further improve the system performance. Also, the performance of novel frame clearly increases as the iteration grows which suggest that the framework progressively refine the similarity measure on the supervector space with the iterative <b>cohort</b> <b>modeling.</b> Index Terms: speaker verification, utterance transform, iterative <b>cohort</b> <b>modeling...</b>|$|R

40|$|The food {{consumption}} to biomass ratio (C) {{is one of}} the most important population parameters in ecosystem modelling because its quantifies the interactions between predator and prey. Existing models for estimating C in fish populations are per-recruit <b>cohort</b> <b>models</b> or empirical models, valid only for stationary populations. Moreover, empirical models lack theoretical support. Here we develop a theory and derive a general modelling framework to estimate C in fish populations, based on length frequency data and the generalised von Bertalanffy growth function, in which models for stationary populations with a stable-age distributions are special cases. Estimates using our method are compared with estimates from per-recruit <b>cohort</b> <b>models</b> for C using simulated harvested fish populations of different lifespans. The models proposed here are also applied to three fish populations that are targets of commercial fisheries in southern Chile. Uncertainty in the estimation of C was evaluated using a resampling approach. Simulations showed that stationary and non-stationary population models produce different estimates for C and those differences depend on the lifespan, fishing mortality and recruitment variations. Estimates of C using the new model exhibited smoother inter-annual variation in comparison with a per-recruit model estimates and they were also smaller than C predicted by the empirical equations in all population assessed...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{work has}} shown that inequalities between generations are most {{pronounced}} in the conservative European welfare states, and that these trends are less pronounced in social democratic and liberal welfare states (Chauvel and Schroder 2014). However, {{it is likely that}} across all advanced capitalist societies superior earnings opportunities and steady employment are pursued at a later age for recent generations due to several interconnected lifestyle changes. In this paper, I examine the variation in generational inequalities across different regimes, with a focus on recent cohorts. For the analysis, I use data from the Luxembourg Income Study (LIS). The repeated cross-sectional data allow me to trace the generational changes in income opportunities for 8 countries, using both Age-Period-Cohort-Detrended coefficients (APCD) and synthetic <b>cohort</b> <b>models.</b> My results suggest that for most countries, cohorts born after 1970 have experienced fewer earning opportunities, relative to cohorts born between 1950 and 1970. Moreover, these generational inequalities have been more pronounced in the coordinated political economies, and less pronounced in the liberal political economies. However, synthetic <b>cohort</b> <b>models</b> suggest that while recent generations have suffered from successively worse entry positions, they appear to be 'catching up', which suggests that lifelong 'scarring effects' may not be inevitable...|$|R
