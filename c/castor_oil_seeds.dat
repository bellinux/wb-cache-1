Previous studies established that the Class- 1 PEPC (PTPC homotetramer) of <b>castor</b> <b>oil</b> <b>seeds</b> (COS) is activated by phosphorylation at Ser- 11 and inhibited by monoubiquitination at Lys- 628 during endosperm development and germination, respectively. Elimination of photosynthate supply to developing COS by depodding caused the PTPC of the endosperm and cotyledon to be dephosphorylated, and then subsequently monoubiquitinated in vivo. PTPC monoubiquitination rather than phosphorylation is widespread throughout the castor plant {{and appears to be}} the predominant PTM of Class- 1 PEPC that occurs in planta. The distinctive developmental patterns of PTPC phosphorylation versus monoubiquitination indicates that these two PTMs are mutually exclusive. By contrast, the BTPC: (i) is abundant in the inner integument, cotyledon, and endosperm of developing COS, but occurs at low levels in roots and cotyledons of germinated COS, (ii) shows a unique developmental pattern in leaves such that it is present in leaf buds and young expanding leaves, but undetectable in fully expanded leaves, and (iii) tightly interacts with co-expressed PTPC to form the novel and allosterically-desensitized Class- 2 PEPC heteromeric complex.

40|$|Abstract Background Phospho enol {{pyruvate}} carboxylase (PEPC) {{is a critical}} enzyme catalyzing the Î²-carboxylation of phospho enol pyruvate (PEP) to oxaloacetate, a tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle intermediate. PEPC typically exists as a Class- 1 PEPC homotetramer composed of plant-type PEPC (PTPC) polypeptides, {{and two of the}} subunits were reported to be monoubiquitinated in germinating <b>castor</b> <b>oil</b> <b>seeds.</b> By the large-scale purification of ubiquitin (Ub) -related proteins from lily anther, two types of PEPCs, bacterial-type PEPC (BTPC) and plant-type PEPC (PTPC), were identified in our study as candidate Ub-related proteins. Until now, there has been no information about the properties of the PEPCs expressed in male reproductive tissues of higher plants. Results Expression analyses showed that lily BTPC (LlBTPC) and Arabidopsis BTPC (AtBTPC) were significantly expressed in pollen. The fusion protein AtBTPC-Venus localized in the cytoplasm of the vegetative cell (VC). Both LlBTPC and AtBTPC expression initiated after the last mitosis before pollen germination. Lily PTPC (LlPTPC) and monoubiquitinated LlPTPC (Ub-LlPTPC) remained at constant levels during pollen development. In late bicellular pollen of lily, LlBTPC forms a hetero-octameric Class- 2 PEPC complex with LlPTPC to express PEPC activity. Conclusion Our results suggest that an LlBTPC:Ub-LlPTPC:LlPTPC complex is formed in the VC cytoplasm during late pollen development. Both LlBTPC and AtBTPC expression patterns are similar to the patterns of the appearance of storage organelles during pollen development in lily and Arabidopsis, respectively. Therefore, BTPC is thought to accelerate the metabolic flow for the synthesis of storage substances during pollen maturation.

Mass spectrometric analysis of immunopurified COS BTPC indicated that it is subject to in vivo proline-directed phosphorylation at Ser 425. We show that immunoblots probed with phosphorylation site-specific antibodies demonstrated that Ser 425 phosphorylation is promoted during COS development, becoming maximal at stage IX (maturation phase) or in response to depodding. Kinetic analyses of a recombinant, chimaeric Class- 2 PEPC containing phosphomimetic BTPC mutant subunits (S 425 D) indicated that Ser 425 phosphorylation results in significant BTPC inhibition by: (i) increasing its Km(PEP) 3 -fold, (ii) reducing its I 50 (L-malate and L-aspartate) values by 4. 5 - and 2. 5 -fold respectively, while (iii) decreasing its activity within the physiological pH range. The developmental pattern and kinetic influence of Ser 425 BTPC phosphorylation is very distinct from the in vivo phosphorylation/activation of COS Class- 1 PEPC's PTPC subunits at Ser 11.

Although its anaplerotic role and control by allosteric effectors, reversible phosphorylation, and oligomerization have been well documented in the endosperm of developing <b>castor</b> <b>oil</b> <b>seeds</b> (COS), relatively little is known about PEPC in germinating COS. The initial phase of COS germination was accompanied by elevated PEPC activity and accumulation of comparable amounts of pre-existing 107 -kDa and inducible 110 -kDa immunoreactive PEPC polypeptides (p 107 and p 110, respectively). A 440 -kDa PEPC heterotetramer composed of an equivalent ratio of non-phosphorylated p 110 and p 107 subunits was purified from germinated COS. N-terminal microsequencing, mass spectrometry, and immunoblotting revealed that both subunits arose from the same gene (RcPpc 3) that encodes the p 107 subunit of a phosphorylated 410 -kDa PEPC homotetramer in developing COS but that p 110 is a monoubiquitinated form of p 107. Tandem mass spectrometry sequencing of a diglycinated tryptic peptide identified Lys- 628 as p 110 's monoubiquitination site. This residue is conserved in vascular plant PEPCs and is proximal to a PEP-binding/catalytic domain. Incubation with a human deubiquitinating enzyme (USP- 2 core) converted the p 110 :p 107 PEPC heterotetramer into a p 107 homotetramer while significantly reducing the enzyme's Km(PEP) and sensitivity to allosteric activators (hexose-Ps, glycerol- 3 -P) and inhibitors (malate, aspartate).

At the optimal temperature of Jatropha oil, 300 ËC, deoxygenation rate was up to 99. 29 %, C 8 - 16 hydrocarbons of products was up to 77. 36 %; 310 ËC and 320 ËC were respectively optimal temperature of rubber <b>seed</b> <b>oil</b> and <b>castor</b> <b>oil,</b> deoxygenation rate were 99. 15 % and 98. 78 %, C 8 - 16 hydrocarbons were 71. 46 % and 69. 25 %. The products quality of Jatropha oil was better than rubber <b>seed</b> <b>oil</b> and <b>castor</b> <b>oil,</b> and rubber <b>seed</b> <b>oil</b> and <b>castor</b> <b>oil</b> can cause the deactivation of catalyst...|$|R
40|$|Our {{previous}} research characterized two phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) carboxylase (PEPC) isoforms (PEPC 1 and PEPC 2) from developing <b>castor</b> <b>oil</b> <b>seeds</b> (COS). The association {{of a shared}} 107 -kD subunit (p 107) with an immunologically unrelated bacterial PEPC-type 64 -kD polypeptide (p 64) leads to marked physical and kinetic differences between the PEPC 1 p 107 homotetramer and PEPC 2 p 107 /p 64 heterooctamer. Here, we describe the production of antiphosphorylation site-specific antibodies to the conserved p 107 N-terminal serine- 6 phosphorylation site. Immunoblotting established that the serine- 6 of p 107 is phosphorylated in COS PEPC 1 and PEPC 2. This phosphorylation was reversed in vitro following incubation of clarified COS extracts or purified PEPC 1 or PEPC 2 with mammalian protein phosphatase type 2 A and {{is not involved in}} a potential PEPC 1 and PEPC 2 interconversion. Similar to other plant PEPCs examined to date, p 107 phosphorylation increased PEPC 1 activity at pH 7. 3 by decreasing its Km(PEP) and sensitivity to l-malate inhibition, while enhancing glucose- 6 -P activation. By contrast, p 107 phosphorylation increased PEPC 2 's Km(PEP) and sensitivity to malate, glutamic acid, and aspartic acid inhibition. Phosphorylation of p 107 was promoted during COS development (coincident with a > 5 -fold increase in the I 50 [malate] value for total PEPC activity in desalted extracts) but disappeared during COS desiccation. The p 107 of stage VII COS became fully dephosphorylated in planta 48 h following excision of COS pods or following 72 h of dark treatment of intact plants. The in vivo phosphorylation status of p 107 appears to be modulated by photosynthate recently translocated from source leaves into developing COS...|$|E
40|$|Leucoplast {{pyruvate}} kinase (PKp; EC 2. 7. 1. 40) from endosperm of developing <b>castor</b> <b>oil</b> <b>seeds</b> (Ricinus communis L. cv Baker 296) {{appears to be}} highly susceptible to limited degradation by a cysteine endopeptidase during the purification of the enzyme or incubation of clarified homogenates at 4 Â°C. Purified castor seed PKp was previously reported to consist of immunologically related 57. 5 and 44 kilodalton subunits (Plaxton WC, Dennis DT, Knowles VL [1990] Plant Physiol 94 : 1528 - 1534). By contrast, immunoreactive polypeptides of about 63. 5 and 54 kilodaltons were observed when a western blot of an extract prepared under denaturing conditions was probed with affinity purified rabbit anti-(castor seed PKp) immunoglobulin G. Proteolytic activity against PKp was estimated by {{the disappearance of the}} 63. 5 and 54 kilodalton subunits and the concomitant appearance of lower molecular mass immunoreactive degradation products during the incubation of clarified homogenates at 4 Â°C. The presence of 2 millimolar dithiothreitol accelerated the degradation of PKp. The conservation of the 63. 5 and 54 kilodalton subunits was observed after extraction of the enzyme in the presence of 1 millimolar p-hydroxymecuribenzoate, or 1 millimolar NÎ±-p-tosyl-l-lysine chloromethyl ketone, or 10 millimolar iodoacetate. These results reveal that a cysteine endopeptidase was responsible for the in vitro proteolysis of PKp. This endopeptidase is present throughout all stages of endosperm development. Its PKp-degrading activity, however, appears to be most pronounced in preparations from older endosperm. When lysates of purified leucoplasts were incubated at 4 Â°C for up to 21 hours, no degradation of PKp was observed; this indicated an extra-leucoplastic localization for the cysteine endopeptidase. Although the in vivo subunit structure of PKp remains uniform throughout all stages of endosperm development, the large decrease in PK activity that accompanies castor seed maturation coincides with a marked reduction in the concentration of PKp...|$|E
40|$|The kinetic and {{regulatory}} properties of cytosolic pyruvate kinase (PKc) isolated from endosperm of germinating <b>castor</b> <b>oil</b> <b>seeds</b> (Ricinus communis L.) have been studied. Optimal efficiency in substrate utilization (in terms of Vmax/Km for phosphoenolpyruvate or ADP) occurred between pH 6. 7 and 7. 4. Enzyme activity was absolutely {{dependent on the}} presence of a bivalent and a univalent metal cation, with Mg 2 + and K+ fulfilling this requirement. Mg 2 + binding showed positive and negative co-operativity at pH 6. 5 (h = 1. 6) and pH 7. 2 (h = 0. 69) respectively. Hyperbolic saturation kinetics were observed with phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) and K+, whereas ADP acted as a mixed-type inhibitor over 1 mM. Glycerol (10 %, v/v) increased the S 0. 5 (ADP) 2. 3 -fold and altered the pattern of nucleotide binding from hyperbolic (h = 1. 0) to sigmoidal (h = 1. 79) without modifying PEP saturation kinetics. No activators were identified. ATP, AMP, isocitrate, 2 -oxoglutarate, malate, 2 -phosphoglycerate, 2, 3 -bisphosphoglycerate, 3 -phosphoglycerate, glycerol 3 -phosphate and phosphoglycolate were the most effective inhibitors. These metabolites yielded additive inhibition when tested in pairs. ATP and 3 -phosphoglycerate were mixed-type inhibitors with respect to PEP, whereas competitive inhibition was observed for other inhibitors. Inhibition by malate, 2 -oxoglutarate, phosphorylated triose sugars or phosphoglycolate was far more pronounced at pH 7. 2 than at pH 6. 5. Although 32 P-labelling studies revealed that extensive phosphorylation in vivo of soluble endosperm proteins occurred between days 3 and 5 of seed germination, no alteration in the 32 P-labelling pattern of 5 -day-germinated endosperm was observed after 30 min of anaerobiosis. Moreover, no evidence was obtained that PKc was a phosphoprotein in aerobic or anoxic endosperms. It is proposed that endosperm PKc activity of germinating castor seeds is enhanced after anaerobiosis through concerted decreases in ATP levels, cytosolic pH and concentrations of several key inhibitors...|$|E
40|$|Plant {{poisoning}} occurs less commonly in {{dogs and}} cats than in herbivorous livestock, but numerous cases have been documented worldwide, most of them caused by common and internationally widely cultivated ornamental garden and house plants. Few cases of poisoning of cats and dogs {{have been reported in}} southern Africa, but many of the plants that have caused poisoning in these species elsewhere are widely available in the subregion and are briefly reviewed in terms of toxic principles, toxicity, species affected, clinical signs, and prognosis. The list includes Melia azedarach (syringa), Brunfelsia spp. (yesterday, today and tomorrow), Datura stramonium (jimsonweed, stinkblaar), a wide variety of lilies and lily-like plants, cycads, plants that contain soluble oxalates, plants containing cardiac glycosides and other cardiotoxins and euphorbias (Euphorbia pulcherrima, E. tirucalli). Poisoning by plant products such as macadamia nuts, onions and garlic, grapes and raisins, cannabis (marijuana, dagga) or hashish and <b>castor</b> <b>oil</b> <b>seed</b> or seedcake is also discussed. Many of the poisonings are not usually fatal, but others frequently result in death unless rapid action is taken by the owner and the veterinarian, underlining the importance of awareness of the poisonous potential of a number of familiar plants...|$|R
