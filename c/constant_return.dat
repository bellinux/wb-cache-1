His doctor observes that [...] "{{everything}} that enters the body, adds weight, and everything that leaves it is debased." [...] The General's body {{is described as a}} [...] "labyrinth coming to a literal dead end". The labyrinth is also expressed in geographical and architectural imagery. The country's destiny is imagined as a break-up, a folding of north into south. The seas offer the hope of a new life and a new world, but the closer the General is to Colombia, the less chance he has of moving on. García Márquez describes buildings as [...] "daunting, reverberating (if not exactly reiterating) with the echoes of a bloody past". The portrayal of the General's world as a labyrinth is underlined by his <b>constant</b> <b>return</b> to cities and towns he has visited before: each location belongs to the past {{as well as to the}} present. The General in his Labyrinth blurs the lines between perdition in a man-made world and wandering in the natural world.|$|E

However, in an unrelated work, Amartya Sen [2003] claims that Sraffa’s [1960] “analysis does not need any assumption of <b>constant</b> <b>returns</b> to scale. ” In fact, Sraffa’s model cannot satisfy this property because {{it is impossible to}} define <b>constant</b> <b>returns</b> to scale in it.

60|$|At {{the heart}} of the Revolution, like a torrid stream flowing undiscernible amid the waters of a {{tumbling}} sea, is a new way of understanding life. The social changes desired by the various assailants of the old order are only the expression of a deeper change in moral idea, and the drift of the new moral idea is to make life simpler. This in a sense is at the bottom of all great religious and moral movements, and the Revolution emphatically belongs to the latter class. Like such movements in the breast of the individual, those which stir an epoch have their principle in the same craving for disentanglement of life. This impulse to shake off intricacies is the mark of revolutionary generations, and it was the starting-point of all Rousseau's mental habits, and of the work in which they expressed themselves. His mind moved outwards from this centre, and hence the fact that he dealt principally with government and education, the two great agencies which, in an old civilisation with a thousand roots and feelers, surround external life and internal character with complexity. Simplification of religion by clearing away the overgrowth of errors, simplification of social relations by equality, of literature and art by <b>constant</b> <b>return</b> to nature, of manners by industrious homeliness and thrift,--this is the revolutionary process and ideal, and this is the secret of Rousseau's hold over a generation that was lost amid the broken maze of fallen systems.|$|E
60|$|The {{poems of}} Keats mark an epoch in English poetry; for, however often {{we may find}} traces of it in others, in them found its most {{unconscious}} expression that reaction against the barrel-organ style which had been reigning {{by a kind of}} sleepy divine right for half a century. The lowest point was indicated when there was such an utter confounding of the common and the uncommon sense that Dr. Johnson wrote verse and Burke prose. The most profound gospel of criticism was, that nothing was good poetry that could not be translated into good prose, as if one should say that the test of sufficient moonlight was that tallow-candles could be made of it. We find Keats at first going to the other extreme, and endeavoring to extract green cucumbers from the rays of tallow; but we see also incontestable proof of the greatness and purity of his poetic gift in the <b>constant</b> <b>return</b> toward equilibrium and repose in his later poems. And it is a repose always lofty and clear-aired, like that of the eagle balanced in incommunicable sunshine. In him a vigorous understanding developed itself in equal measure with the divine faculty; thought emancipated itself from expression without becoming its tyrant; and music and meaning floated together, accordant as swan and shadow, on the smooth element of his verse. Without losing its sensuousness, his poetry refined itself and grew more inward, and the sensational was elevated into the typical by the control of that finer sense which underlies the senses and is the spirit of them.|$|E

Over a year was to pass before he took my advice and settled for a while in an Aran cottage, and became happy, having escaped at last, as he wrote, [...] "from the squalor of the poor and the nullity of the rich." [...] I almost forget the prose and verse he showed me in Paris, though I read it all through again when after his death I decided, at his written request, what was to be published and what not. Indeed, I have but a vague impression, as of a man trying to look out of a window and blurring all that he sees by breathing upon the window. According to my Lunar parable, {{he was a man of}} the twenty-third Phase, a man whose subjective lives--for a <b>constant</b> <b>return</b> to our life is a part of my dream--were over, who must not pursue an image, but fly from it, all that subjective dreaming, that had once been power and joy, now corrupting within him. He had to take the first plunge into the world beyond himself, the first plunge away from himself that is always pure technique, the delight in doing, not because one would or should, but merely because one can do.|$|E
