25|$|Cotton {{was first}} {{planted in the}} Shire valley by Eugene Sharrer, and the British Central Africa Company {{continued}} to grow cotton on its Chelumbo and Chikwawa estates. From 1903 the company also encouraged cotton cultivation by African smallholders in the Upper Shire District, by distributing cheap Egyptian <b>cotton</b> <b>seed.</b> The company gave instruction on the method of cultivation and agreed to buy the future crop at a guaranteed (but low) price. There was no significant shortage of land for peasant farming in the Upper Shire Valley, as the British Central Africa Company only exploited {{a small proportion of}} its land and, until the 1930s, the company tolerated squatters who did not pay rent on its land. Its tenants had to perform labour thangata or grow cotton for sale to the company, but in general there was plenty of land available for food production. The efforts of the colonial administration to introduce cotton as a peasant cash-crop were largely unsuccessful, as the prices paid to the peasants were low, so they concentrated on growing food. The British Central Africa Company Ltd also had a cotton ginnery for processing its own and smallholder cotton until at least 1961. In 1971, the purchase and processing of smallholder cotton was taken over by a parastatal body.|$|E

Increasing drought resistance of cotton seedlings by accelerating root growth is an important practical implication. The study was conducted on effects of mepiquat chloride (1, 1 -dimetheyl peperidinum chloride) on drought resistance of cotton seedling. The <b>cotton</b> <b>seeds</b> were soaked for night in mepequat chloride solution i. e. 0, 500, 1000, 1500 and 2000 ml L - 1. Water stress was given after thirty days after sowing, for nine days and data were collected for root length, shoot length, fresh weight and dry weight. Firstly, mepiquat chloride seed treated plants were well irrigated and subjected to severe stress. It indicated that petiol length and shoot length decreased, while root length, fresh weight and dry weight increased with high concentration of mepiquat chloride. <b>Cotton</b> <b>seeds</b> treated with high dose of mepiquat chloride may elongate the days taken to emerge first true leaves. With the withdrawal irrigation, mepiquat chloride treated seedlings at all concentration maintained higher root growth, shorter stem length more fresh and dry weight than non-treated seedlings...|$|R
