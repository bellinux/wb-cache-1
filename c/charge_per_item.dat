40|$|Background: Some {{doubt the}} {{desirability}} and cost-effectiveness {{of continuing to}} provide an expanded scope of primary care practice. Additionally, there has been concern about declining reimbursement from Medicaid and Medicare. Although an expanded scope of patient care services are required for training, we wanted to determine whether these services drain resources and time from other primary care activities. Methods: To determine the financial impact of deleting services other than office visits from an urban primary care practice, we tabulated charges, economic case mix, and actual collections during 12 con-secutive months. Using regional and national norms, the practice set charges for hospital services, office visits, and procedures at approximately 50 th percentile as a maximum. Common diagnostic and thera-peutic procedures were tabulated, and gross <b>charges</b> <b>per</b> <b>item</b> <b>per</b> year were tabulated. To validate net collection predictions for a predominately TennCare (Medicaid) practice and compare these with pro-jected net collections from private practice, charges were compared with projected collections using two expectations (40 % net and 80 % net). Overall collections were projected and then compared with actual collection. For hospital services and office procedures, costs were attributed to equipment, training, liability insurance, and lost opportunity for office visits. The setting was an urban family practice teaching program providing hospital services, hospital de...|$|R

40|$|Irrational {{prescribing}} and over-prescription is a world-wide problem. Prescribers often cite patient demand {{as one of}} {{the main}} reasons why they over-prescribe, but the degree to which this is so is unknown. This article describes a study to test the hypothesis that patient demand causes over-prescription. The study occurred within the context of different kinds of nominal user fee for drugs in Nepal, where it was assumed that <b>charging</b> <b>per</b> drug <b>item</b> would deter patient demand, and hence over-prescription, as compared to <b>charging</b> <b>per</b> prescription. Focus group discussions with patients attending rural health facilities explored patient attitudes towards drugs. Patients and health workers were interviewed to gather quantitative data on (1) patient demand, and (2) health worker views of patient demand and their own prescribing habits, and comparing these with the drugs actually prescribed and dispensed to patients. Patients felt they needed more drugs than they were prescribed or dispensed, but stated that they would be happy to accept advice from prescribers for fewer drugs. In all areas of whatever fee type, there was no association between the number of drug items patients felt they needed pre-consultation and the number of drug items that they actually received as observed post-consultation. However, there was a significant association between the average number of drug <b>items</b> <b>per</b> patient that prescribers stated they usually prescribed and the actual number that were prescribed. It was concluded that patient demand was not affected by different kinds of user fee and did not directly influence prescribing behaviour.

40|$|OBJECTIVES [...] To {{assess the}} {{validity}} of the item as a measure of the volume of a drug prescribed; and to investigate the possibility that higher quantities <b>per</b> <b>item</b> are prescribed for patients who are not exempt from the prescription charge. DESIGN [...] Five substudies. For the first, a frequency distribution was derived of the different quantities <b>per</b> <b>item</b> of 10 commonly used drugs prescribed by 20 randomly selected practices in each of five family health service authority areas. For the second, the variation in average quantity <b>per</b> <b>item</b> for the same drugs in the same practices was calculated. For the third and fourth, variation in average quantity <b>per</b> <b>item</b> for 90 commonly used drugs was calculated for all 90 family health service authorities and for all 14 regional health authorities in England. For the fifth, the average quantity <b>per</b> <b>item</b> for each of the 90 drugs was regressed on the percentage of items exempt from the prescription charge, at family health service authority level, and the percentage of variation explained by the regression found. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE [...] Distribution of quantity per item; variation in average quantity <b>per</b> <b>item</b> between the practices, between family health service authorities, and between regions; and percentage of variation between family health service authorities accounted for by exemption from the prescription charge. RESULTS [...] Wide variation was found in the quantities <b>per</b> <b>item</b> prescribed by the practices, and in the average quantity <b>per</b> <b>item</b> between practices and between family health service authorities. No family health service authority was consistently high or low in quantity <b>per</b> <b>item</b> across the 90 drugs. Variation in average quantity <b>per</b> <b>item</b> was less at regional than at family health service authority level, though still high for many of the drugs. The proportion of variation accounted for by exemption from prescription charges ranged from 0 % to 49 % across the 90 drugs. CONCLUSIONS [...] The item is unsuitable as a measure of prescribing volume, even at regional level: a new measure, based on standard daily dosages, is needed. The percentage of the variation in quantity <b>per</b> <b>item</b> accounted for by exemption is inconsistent, and in over half the 90 drugs it was below 20 % [...] therefore it is not a useful predictor...|$|R

50|$|This {{technique}} is often employed {{in a year}} when sales are down from other external factors and the company would report a loss in any event. For example, inventory valued on the books at $100 <b>per</b> <b>item</b> is written down to $50 <b>per</b> <b>item</b> resulting in a net loss of $50 <b>per</b> <b>item</b> in the current year. Note there is no cash impact to this write-down. When that same inventory is sold in later years for $75 <b>per</b> <b>item,</b> the company reports an income of $25 <b>per</b> <b>item</b> in the future period. This process takes an inventory loss and turns it into a ‘profit’. Corporations will often wait until a bad year to employ this ‘big bath’ technique to ‘clean up’ the balance sheet. Although the process is discouraged by auditors, it is still used. In recent times, General Motors and other US Corporations have taken huge write downs on balance sheet assets resulting in massive losses. The same result can be achieved by recording in one year the future cash costs of expected plant closing or employee layoffs. The objective is to take these loses all at once, so future periods can show positive net income.|$|R

Form A, Form B, and Form C, each containing 30 multiple-choice vocabulary test items with five, four, and three options <b>per</b> <b>item,</b> were randomly given to 180 graduate and undergraduate English major university students. The three test forms were linked by means of ten common items using concurrent common item equating.

40|$|The {{purpose was}} to {{determine}} the minimally important clinical difference (MICD) in fatigue as measured by the Profile of Mood States, Schwartz Cancer Fatigue Scale (SCFS), General Fatigue Scale, and a 10 -point single-item fatigue measure. The MICD is the smallest amount of change in a symptom (e. g., fatigue) measure that signifies an important change in that symptom. Subjects rated the degree of change in their fatigue over 2 days on a Global Rating Scale. 103 patients were enrolled on this multisite prospective repeated measures design. MICD was determined following established procedures at two time points. Statistically significant changes were observed for moderate and large changes in fatigue, but not for small changes. The scales were sensitive to increases in fatigue over time. The MICD, presented as mean change, for each scale and <b>per</b> <b>item</b> on each scale is: POMS = 5. 6, <b>per</b> <b>item</b> = 1. 1, SCFS = 5. 0, <b>per</b> <b>item</b> = 0. 8, GFS = 9. 7, <b>per</b> <b>item</b> = 1. 0, and the single item measure of fatigue was 2. 4 points.
