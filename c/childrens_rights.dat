40|$|Aims and objectives: The {{purpose of}} this {{literature}} review was to search for and review, systematically, childrens decision-making competence in {{health care in the}} scientific literature. Findings of both quantitative and qualitative studies were analysed thematically. Background: Most previous research in childrens decision-making competence in health care concerns adults care {{in the best interests of}} the child. It is important to consider decision-making competence from the childs perspective because of <b>childrens</b> own human <b>rights.</b> Methods: Systematic review including database search, manual selection, supplementary searching, management and acquisition of relevant literature, quality appraisal, literature review saturation and thematic review. Results: Six themes emerged: measurable issues, values and beliefs, power, parent-related communication, trust and self-determination. Measurable issues were age, reading ability and memory. Values and beliefs as well as power and parent-related communication were associated with healthcare professionals. Children showed trust and expressed a wish to use self-determination. Conclusions: Age appropriate information and participation were prerequisites for allowing children to have possibilities of making competent decisions about their own care. Childrens decision-making competence is dependent on others, such as parents and healthcare professionals, attitudes and not only on their own capacity. Lack of competence, however, does not exclude children from the human right to have a say. It should be noted that it is a decision to leave the determination to a parent or healthcare professional. Relevance to clinical practice: Future research from the viewpoint of children is important to reach optimal levels of participation, through respecting their integrity and to develop them into potential competent decision makers.

40|$|The {{principle}} of open justice underlies public accessibility to courts and accountability {{of decision making}} through publicity and freedom of information. This is modified in family proceedings, especially where children are involved and we {{shy away from the}} idea of 'trial as a public spectacle'. In the leading early 20 th century case upholding the principle even in matrimonial disputes, matters affecting children were excepted as ?truly private affairs?. However, the law is {{now in the process of}} being reformed to bring family courts more into line with other types of courts in England and Wales. The consultation process that led to the changes included commitments to take the views and interests of children and young people into account. Not only do these commitments remain unmet, but the proposed changes pose a number of new challenges to <b>children?s</b> <b>rights</b> and welfare. In December 2008, the Secretary of State for Justice and Lord Chancellor, Jack Straw, announced to Parliament that court rules would be changed to allow representatives of the media to attend family court proceedings, as of right, which they had previously been unable to do. This announcement coincided with the publication of Family Justice in View: Ministry of Justice Response to Consultation. The decision on media attendance came as some surprise to observers, because it contradicted an earlier decision in June 2007 against allowing the media into any tier of family court as of right. In accordance with the revised policy in December 2008, court rules were subsequently amended, with effect from 27 April 2009, to allow journalists with press cards the right to attend family court hearings unless the court made a specific decision to exclude them. More far-reaching changes are to be included in a Bill to be introduced in the 2009 - 2010 Parliamentary session. This will allow the press and broadcasting media a right to publish details of the evidence given, although in anonymised form and still subject to potential veto by the court. The meaning of these changes will be explored in this article. Initially, the obvious question is: what happened between June 2007 and December 2008 to bring about this volte face? This article will argue that both the premise and the consultation process on these reforms have ignored and infringed a range of <b>children?s</b> <b>rights.</b> The background to the proposed reforms will first be explained, and the relationships between concepts of secrecy, privacy, transparency and openness. Drawing on the literature on moral and legal rights to privacy leads to a question as to whether children are or should be accorded a different level of privacy rights than adults. The development of the law that protects privacy in family courts will be set out, followed by the effects of the changes. Analysing the reform process, and the particular nature of cases heard in family courts, it is concluded that <b>children?s</b> <b>rights</b> have been overridden by adult interests...|$|E

This project examined pupils??? participation in their own assessment from a <b>children???s</b> <b>rights</b> perspective. It demonstrated that when genuine opportunities for participating in and understanding assessment are presented, pupils engage in their learning and focus on their own progress. When policy makers use child-centred methods to consult children directly, children show the motivation and capacity {{to be involved in}} decision-making. CPAL enshrined these principles within its own design and processes. KS 2 and KS 3 pupils advised on ethical informed consent and some of the research methods. They co-researched and co-interpreted aspects of the data. In addition to traditional survey methods, the project developed creative methods for use with pupils and teachers which incorporated E-consultation, focus groups, drawings, and pupils??? digital recordings. The project was designed to take account of the policy context in Northern Ireland, with its focus on pupil profiles and assessment for learning. Findings: (1) Children can be consulted directly by policy-makers on educational issues such as assessment policy and practice.; (2) When teachers??? beliefs and their assessment for learning (AfL) practices come together, pupils benefit; (3) Teachers and parents are generally supportive of children???s rights; and (4) Children can be involved as co-researchers in mainstream research projects in ways that enhance the inquiry and enshrine children???s right. Implications: (1) Methods should be inclusive and adults should listen and respond to children???s views; (2) Teachers need support to create participative classroom cultures based on genuine AfL; (3) There are opportunities for increased awareness of how to apply and evaluate <b>children???s</b> <b>rights</b> in practice; and (4).

When suspiscions arise that a child is exposed to child abuse there are several inquiries that starts at the same time. A social inquiry to see if the child needs protection, a legal inquiry to investigate if a crime is committed, a medical inquiry if the child is sexual or physical abused and a psychiatric inquiry if the child is traumatized. As we can see the child is exposed to many authorities and many different commissioners. To prevent this from happen and to make the already difficult situation for the child better, so called Childrens Advocacy Centers (CAC) have been raised all around Sweden. Between the years of 2006 and 2007 there has also been a national project commissioned by the swedish Government with CAC´s in six cities of Sweden. With this paper I´ve been investigating if abused <b>childrens</b> <b>rights</b> are better taken care of in CAC´s. My conclusion is that the objective of the CAC´s probably will be reached in the future. Today CAC´s are mostely a guarantee for the child not to be forced to meet the different authoroties at different places, even though {{the best interest of the}} child and the legal security of the child come to be more focused on in CAC´s. I´m also discussing the possibility that maybe there is a need for a particular legislation for the children, a Barnbalk...|$|E
40|$|The {{thesis is}} focused on {{facilities}} for children who require immediate help (ZPDVOP) {{as an instrument of}} a socio-legal protection of children in the Czech Republic. The introduction describes the importance of a family, family disorders, fundamental legal instruments on <b>children?s</b> <b>rights</b> and socio-legal protection of children, including the legal framework of facilities for children who require immediate help. The objective of this work was to present basic information on facilities for children who require immediate help in the Czech Republic and to describe the specifics of these facilities that are run by the Fund for Children in Need. Quantitative research, the method of document analysis and the technique of secondary data analysis were applied to prove the hypotheses. The data obtained in the research were processed and diagrammatized. To describe the Children?s Centre of South Bohemia and another facility called Klokánek, in Hostivice, qualitative research, document analysis and secondary data analysis were applied. The method of a questionnaire and the technique of a half standardized interview were used during the visits to these facilities. Two hypotheses were being checked. The first hypothesis, claiming that the number of facilities in particular regions is not equal to the number of citizens, was proved. The other hypothesis, claiming that the organizational structure of the Fund for Children in Need differs from the structure of facilities run by other institutors, was also proved. Two hypotheses arose from the qualitative research: children who stayed in Klokánek were more satisfied than children who stayed in any other facility for children who require immediate help, the work in Klokanek is more demanding than in other facilities, the number of children who return back to their families is higher in facilities that are run as children?s centres than in Klokanek facilities. This thesis can serve as an outline file on facilities for children who require immediate help in the Czech Republic and also as a background for further research in this field...|$|E
40|$|Convention on the Rights of a Child {{came into}} being on November 20, 1989, when it {{was adopted by the}} General Assembly of the United Nations Organisation (UNO). It became to be legally valid on September 2, 1990. On September 30, 1990 the world summit for {{children}} in New York took place and on this occasion, the then Czech and Slovak Federative Republic joined this Convention on the Rights of a Child. This international document in our country came into legal effect on Febr. 6, 1991. The <b>childrens</b> <b>rights</b> committee of UNO criticises the Czech Republic, that it informs insufficiently of the Convention on the Rights of a Child and for this reason the society does not know what rights this document contains. The target of the bachelor thesis is {{to find out if the}} Czech society is really insufficiently informed and if the pedagogues in the elementary school really inform their pupils on their rights sufficiently. The selected methodology was the questionnaire examination which was performed in the form of a questionnaire. 2 types of questionnaires were created, one of them for finding out to what extent the public is informed and the other one for pedagogues. The respondents of 2 towns were selected [...] Blatná and Strakonice, to be able to verify the hypothesis if the citizens of a larger town (Strakonice) are more informed than the citizens of a smaller town (Blatná). To establish if the pedagogues inform, the pedagogues of the Elementary School of Jan Amos Komenský in Blatná were addressed. I think the postulated targets of the thesis were met. The research confirmed all the hypotheses. The public is insufficiently informed. The extent of knowledge is lower in a small town than in a larger town. The pedagogues inform insufficiently the pupils about the Convention on the Rights of a Child. The recommendation following from this thesis is that the state should start to inform more the wide public. For this purpose the public education should be carried out by means of leaflets, talks of parents with their children, television spots and firsts of all the instructions of the rights of children, following from Convention on the Rights of a Child shall be involved obligatory into the teaching in elementary school...|$|E
40|$|Child {{sexual abuse}} is a {{violation}} of <b>children?s</b> <b>rights</b> to be protected from all forms of violence, exploitation and abuse. This is provided for by the Convention on the Rights of a Child (CRC) and the African Charter on the Rights and Welfare of the Child (ACRWC). The CRC in Article 2, specifies that all children are to enjoy the rights provided in the Convention without discrimination on the grounds of sex among other things. 1 Similarly, Article 3 of the ACRWC also provides for non-discrimination in the enjoyment of the rights stipulated in the Charter for all children. 2 It is the reason why this study focuses on the sexual abuse experiences of the boy child, because for such a long time, focus has been on addressing sexual abuse for girls. On the other hand, the study seeks to balance its interrogation of child sexual abuse by looking at it from two angles. It looks at the experiences of boys as victims of sexual abuse and boys who grow into adult perpetrators of child sexual abuse. Various studies on child sexual abuse have concluded that boys constitute {{a very small percentage of}} child sexual abuse victims. They also claim that men make up the largest number of sexual abusers, while women abusers are close to non-existent. This information comes from years of study, and is mostly based on evidence from reported cases of child sexual abuse. However, this study found that there are reasonable grounds to believe that most cases of boy child sexual abuse go unreported. Similarly, most cases of female child abusers either go unreported or undetected due to gender stereotypes. The research also found that there is a possible link between gender stereotypes and the reason behind men being more responsible for the abuse of children. It explored various gender stereotypes that society has accepted as normal and how they possibly impact the psychological development of young boys, leading to them developing negative sexual attitudes as they grow older. By analysing gender stereotypes and interrogating their role in the spread of child sexual abuse, the aim is to highlight them as a threat to human rights. Generally, gender stereotypes cultivate the discrimination of individuals who do not conform to the normative standards that society uses as a yardstick to measure one?s ?appropriateness?. The study gives a brief overview of some of the provisions found in international and regional human rights law on gender stereotypes that can be used to address them. This is with a view to not only eradicate child sexual abuse, but to promote non-discrimination and tolerance among human beings. Mini Dissertation (MPhil) [...] University of Pretoria, 2017.
