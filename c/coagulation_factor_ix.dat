40|$|Tissue factor (TF; {{sometimes}} called thromboplastin) is the protein responsible for triggering blood clotting. It {{is an integral}} membrane protein which must be incorporated into phospholipid vesicles for optimal activity, and furthermore, the vesicles must include some phospholipids whose head groups have a net negative charge. The result [...] TF incorporated into phospholipid vesicles [...] functions by binding and allosterically activating the plasma serine protease, <b>coagulation</b> <b>factor</b> VIIa. The TF:VIIa complex triggers blood clotting by proteolytically activating <b>coagulation</b> <b>factors</b> <b>IX</b> and X, converting them into active serine proteases. The technique described here for incorporating TF into phospholipid vesicles—sometimes termed "relipidation"—uses the dialyzable, non-ionic detergent,n-octyl-beta-D-glucopyranoside (octylglucoside). In this adaptation of the general method of Mimms et al. [1], phospholipids and TF are both dissolved in octylglucoside, forming mixed micelles. Since octylglucoside has a high critical micelle concentration (CMC = 20 to 25 mM), it can readily be removed from solutions by dialysis. As octylglucoside dialyses out, the phospholipids organize into unilamellar vesicles. TF becomes embedded in these vesicles {{by virtue of its}} singl...|$|R

50|$|Impaired {{coordination}} of calcium {{can result in}} serious disorders. Defective calcium binding to <b>coagulation</b> <b>factor</b> <b>IX</b> contributes {{to the development of}} hemophilia B. Individuals afflicted with this hereditary disease tend to develop hemorrhages, potentially leading to life-threatening conditions. The cause of hemophilia B is decreased activity or deficiency of blood <b>coagulation</b> <b>factor</b> <b>IX.</b> Point mutations resulting in decreased affinity of factor IX to calcium are thought to be implicated in this bleeding disorder. On a molecular basis, it appears that hemophilia B can be the result of an impaired ability to localize the Gla module efficiently, as it usually occurs after calcium coordination by the cbEGF module in fully functional factor IX. This defect is thought to impair the biological function of factor IX. A similar problem occurs in patients suffering from hemophilia B and carrying a mutation (Glu78Lys) in factor IX that prevents interaction of the two cbEGF modules with one another. Conversely, in healthy individuals, Glu78 in the first cbEGF-module contacts Arg94 in the second cbEGF module and thereby aligns both modules. Thus, domain-domain interactions (partially facilitated by calcium coordination) are crucial for the catalytic activity of proteins involved in the blood-clotting cascade.|$|E

The {{mechanism by which}} EHEC induces D+HUS has not been fully elucidated. We investigated the effects of EspP on clot formation and lysis in human blood. Human whole blood and plasma were incubated with EspP(WT) at various concentrations and sampled at various time points. Thrombin time (TT), prothrombin time (PT), and {{activated partial thromboplastin time}} (aPTT), <b>coagulation</b> <b>factor</b> activities, and thrombelastgraphy (TEG) were measured. Human whole blood or plasma incubated with EspP(WT) was found to have prolonged PT, aPTT, and TT.

40|$|The {{infusion}} of normal human serum into ani-mals engenders a transient period of hypercoagu-lability characterized by profound shortening {{of the whole}} blood clotting time in both glass and silicone-coated tubes (2).

50|$|In warfarin's {{initial stages}} of action, {{inhibition}} of protein C and Factor VII is stronger than inhibition of the other vitamin K-dependent <b>coagulation</b> <b>factors</b> II, <b>IX</b> and X.

These activation reactions were now studied on the surface of human umbilical vein endothelial cells. The cells were stimulated with endotoxin to express tissue factor. This tissue factor activity was saturable with factor VIIa and could be inhibited by rabbit antibodies against human tissue factor apoprotein. Only stimulated cells supported factor VIIa activity. No difference in the reactivity of factor VII and VIIa was observed in the presence of factor X, due to rapid feedback activation of factor VII by factor Xa. However, the activation of <b>factor</b> <b>IX</b> by <b>factor</b> VII shows a 10 min lag-phase, which reflects that the activation of factor VII by factor IXa is a less efficient process. The kinetic parameters for the factor VIIa dependent activation of <b>factor</b> <b>IX</b> and <b>factor</b> X on the endothelial surface were: Km 0. 09 -mu-M, Vmax 0. 13 pmol/min, and Km 0. 071 -mu-M, Vmax 0. 41 pmol/min, respectively. The same ratio between the Vmax for factor X and <b>factor</b> <b>IX</b> activation was observed as in a cell free system.

40|$|Journal URL: [URL] {{this study}} site-directed {{mutagenesis}} {{was performed on}} <b>coagulation</b> <b>factor</b> <b>IX</b> (fIX) gene and their effect on the protein’s proteolytic activity was studied. Blood <b>coagulation</b> <b>factor</b> <b>IX</b> (fIX) is a vitamin K-dependent plasma serine protease that {{plays a major role}} in coagulation mechanism and haemostasis. It is synthesized in hepatocytes as a precursor protein of 461 amino acids. After several post-translational modifications the mature protein is secreted in the circulation as inactive zymogen. The zymogen is then activated during the coagulation cascade into an active serine protease. A truncated form of fIX gene (rf 9) inserted in a pET 22 b vector was used in our experiments so as to be able to overexpress the protein in prokaryotic cells. Two mutations were induced on this gene. Both of them are described in databases as polymorphisms. The first one (A 21975 G) is on the protein’s activation peptide and causes the substitution of Thr 194 by an Ala residue. The prevalence of this G containing allele in general population is 23 %. However in our previous study we found that in a certain group of thrombophilic patients the prevalence of the G containing allele was 50 %. The second mutation (A 32881 C) is also described as polymorphism and causes the substitution of Thr 461 by a Gly residue and involves the 2 % of the population. Both mutated and native forms of the truncated <b>coagulation</b> <b>factor</b> <b>IX</b> (rf 9) were overexpressed in E. coli BL 21 cells after induction with IPTG. The truncated factor rf 9 lacks its first N-terminal domains; therefore it doesn’t require posttranslational modifications in order to gain activity. Proteolytic activity of rf 9 was studied using an amidolytic assay. Rf 9 was first activated using Russell’s viper venom FX activating protein (RVV-X). The specific tripeptide MSD- Phe-Gly-Arg-pNA was used as a substrate. Proteins were purified from the cytoplasm using a Q-Sepharose ff column.
