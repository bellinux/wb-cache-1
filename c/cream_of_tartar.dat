25|$|Many {{forms of}} baking powder contain sodium {{bicarbonate}} combined with calcium acid phosphate, sodium aluminium phosphate or <b>cream</b> <b>of</b> <b>tartar.</b> Baking soda is alkaline; the acid used in baking powder avoids a metallic taste when the chemical change during baking creates sodium carbonate.|$|E
25|$|Hydrolysis {{breaks the}} glycosidic bond {{converting}} sucrose into glucose and fructose. Hydrolysis is, however, so slow that solutions of sucrose can sit {{for years with}} negligible change. If the enzyme sucrase is added, however, the reaction will proceed rapidly. Hydrolysis can also be accelerated with acids, such as <b>cream</b> <b>of</b> <b>tartar</b> or lemon juice, both weak acids. Likewise, gastric acidity converts sucrose to glucose and fructose during digestion, the bond between them being an acetal bond {{which can be broken}} by an acid.|$|E

25|$|In cooking, sodium bicarbonate, {{referred}} to as baking soda, is primarily used in baking as a leavening agent. It reacts with acidic components in batters, releasing carbon dioxide, which causes expansion of the batter and forms the characteristic texture and grain in pancakes, cakes, quick breads, soda bread, and other baked and fried foods. Acidic compounds that induce this reaction include phosphates, <b>cream</b> <b>of</b> <b>tartar,</b> lemon juice, yogurt, buttermilk, cocoa and vinegar. Baking soda may be used together with sourdough, which is acidic, making a lighter product with a less acid taste.|$|E
25|$|Barrel {{burnishing}} {{is a type}} of barreling {{where no}} cutting action is desired. The goal is to reduce minute irregularities and produce a clean, smooth surface. The parts are usually tumbled against themselves or with steel balls, shot, rounded-end pins, or ballcones to achieve this. It is also usually a wet process that uses water and a lubricant or cleaning agent, such as soap or <b>cream</b> <b>of</b> <b>tartar.</b> The barrel is not loaded more than half full and if media is used then a 2:1 ratio of media to parts is maintained to keep the parts from rubbing.|$|E

Lead acetate was called sugar of lead. However, other names like sugar of lead (lead(II) acetate), butter of antimony (antimony trichloride), oil of vitriol (sulfuric acid), and <b>cream</b> <b>of</b> <b>tartar</b> (potassium bitartrate) borrowed their language from the kitchen.

I never have had hives like these before. I can't understand it. So long as I keep my lamp burning and read I am untroubled.

60|$|My {{sleep that}} night was wretched. Short of sleep from the {{previous}} night, I closed my book and turned my light off early. But scarcely had I dropped into slumber when I was aroused by the recrudescence of my hives. All day they had not bothered me; yet the instant I put out the light and slept, the damnable persistent itching set up. Wada had not yet gone to bed, and from him I got more <b>cream</b> <b>of</b> <b>tartar.</b> It was useless, however, and at midnight, when I heard the watch changing, I partially dressed, slipped into my dressing-gown, and went up on to the poop.|$|E
60|$|But I {{could not}} sleep. I took more <b>cream</b> <b>of</b> <b>tartar.</b> It {{must be the}} heat of the bed-clothes, I decided, that excited my hives. And yet, {{whenever}} I ceased struggling for sleep, and lighted the lamp and read, my skin irritation decreased. But as soon as I turned out the lamp and closed my eyes I was troubled again. So hour after hour passed, through which, between vain attempts to sleep, I managed to wade through many pages of Rosny's Le Termite--a not very cheerful proceeding, I must say, concerned as it is with the microscopic and over-elaborate recital of Noel Servaise's tortured nerves, bodily pains, and intellectual phantasma. At last I tossed the novel aside, damned all analytical Frenchmen, and found some measure of relief in the more genial and cynical Stendhal.|$|E
60|$|A bad night--equally {{bad for the}} Elsinore and for me. She is {{receiving}} a sharp buffeting {{at the hands of}} the wintry North Atlantic. I fell asleep early, exhausted from lack of sleep, and awoke in an hour, frantic with my lumped and burning skin. More <b>cream</b> <b>of</b> <b>tartar,</b> more reading, more vain attempts to sleep, until shortly before five, when the steward brought me my coffee, I wrapped myself in my dressing-gown, and like a being distracted prowled into the cabin. I dozed in a leather chair and was thrown out by a violent roll of the ship. I tried the sofa, sinking to sleep immediately, and immediately thereafter finding myself precipitated to the floor. I am convinced that when Captain West naps on the sofa he is only half asleep. How else can he maintain so precarious a position?--unless, in him, too, the sea and its motion be ingrained.|$|E

50|$|Whipping aids {{improve the}} foaming {{properties}} of albumen, a protein found in egg whites, {{which means a}} firmer foam will be established in a shorter amount of time. <b>Cream</b> <b>of</b> <b>tartar</b> is an acidic salt which adjusts the pH of egg whites so the proteins will be more soluble, as well as reducing protein denaturation during whipping. If <b>cream</b> <b>of</b> <b>tartar</b> is not used the cake may not reach its maximum achievable volume. <b>Cream</b> <b>of</b> <b>tartar</b> also decolorizes the flavone pigments in flour, which gives a final cake that is a bright white color. The whiteness of the cake is also caused by the way <b>cream</b> <b>of</b> <b>tartar</b> creates very small and uniform air bubbles, which gives the cake the appearance of being whiter after baking.|$|E
