50|$|Aluminized steel can be {{made using}} a variety of processes, cladding, hot dipping, {{galvanic}} coating, metallizing, and <b>calorizing,</b> but the most effective process is hot dipping. The process of hot dipping starts by cleaning the steel, then placing the steel in a bath of Al-11%Si at a temperature of 988K and shaken, then pulled out and air dried. The aluminium diffuses into the steel, creating an intermetallic layer above the steel base layer, but below the outside aluminum coating. The aluminium coating is oxidized to help protect the inner steel from corrosion and further aluminium diffusion. The silicon is added to the aluminium bath to create a thinner layer of aluminium on the steel. The hot dipping process is cheaper and more effective to produce aluminized steel than any other process.|$|E
40|$|There {{the purpose}} is to study the {{structure}} formation processes, which take place in the semifinished products with the different sections at the hot plastic deformation and during the following operations of solid strengthening and of surface strengthening. The formation mechanisms of grain structure of large-sized semifinished products have been ascertained. The influence of grain-boundary alpha -phase has been determined. The segregating of aluminium near the phase interface has been detected. The influence of regimes of laser <b>calorizing,</b> of surface plastic deforming on the structure and on the phase composition of surface has been explored. The comprehensive working process of largesized semifinished products has been offered. The regimes of heat pre-treatment of parts with the starting colonial heating of alpha -phase and with the added short-term heating have been developed. The recommendations for the optimization of regimes of laser nitriding have been presentedAvailable from VNTIC / VNTIC - Scientific & Technical Information Centre of RussiaSIGLERURussian Federatio...|$|E
40|$|To {{study the}} {{aluminium}} diffusion coating of copper, pure copper plates were <b>calorized</b> by a conventional pack cementation method using a Fe- 50 %Al alloy powder {{as a source}} of aluminium. A thin layer of α-Cu was formed on the copper substrate, followed by a thick αーCu+γ 2 (Cu 9 Al 4) eutectoid layer with floating α-Cu particles, and γ 2 particlds near the surface of the diffusion layer. The Fe- 50 %Al alloy powders adhere to the sample and are embedded into the diffusion layer. Oxidation test of the <b>calorized</b> copper shows that the aluminium diffusion coating used improves the oxidation resistance of copper, even by a lowest temperature and a shortest time coating studied...|$|R
