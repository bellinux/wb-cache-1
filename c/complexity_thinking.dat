50|$|He {{published}} {{his first book}} in 1990 which was on his experience of doing strategic planning and this was followed in 1991 by {{the first of his}} books, The Chaos Frontier, which sought to explore the implications of the complexity sciences for management and organisations. Then in 1993, he published Strategic Management and Organisational Dynamics, a textbook which located <b>complexity</b> <b>thinking</b> about strategy and organisations in the wider strategy literature. The textbook is now in its 6th edition. The year 1996 saw the publication of his book Complexity and Organisational Creativity. In the meantime he had embarked on the training programme of the Institute of Group Analysis in London, qualifying as a group psychotherapist in 1998 and becoming a member of that Institute and of the Group Analytic Society. He ran clinical therapy groups at a local hospital until about 2004. Also in 1995 he set up a group supervision of PhD students and it was through this activity that he met Patricia Shaw and Doug Griffin as their PhD supervisor. They became friends and colleagues and together they developed the theory of complex responsive processes of relating as a way of understanding human organisations and their management. The collaboration between the three had a major impact on what Stacey was writing so that there is a radical shift in his way of thinking from a systemic approach prior to 2000 to a responsive processes approach in 2000 and thereafter. Together, in 1995, they set up the Complexity and Management Centre as a research centre at Hertfordshire University with Stacey as its director. Also in 2000, Stacey, Griffin and Shaw established the Doctor of Management programme at Hertfordshire Business School and Stacey took the role of its director until 2011 when he was succeeded by Professor Chris Mowles, although he continues his involvement as research supervisor. The programme is still running and has produced 58 graduates from many different countries.|$|E

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} was to explore how <b>complexity</b> <b>thinking</b> might inform social work with families in need of support around early neglect. Complexity theory has begun to be applied to social work practice, but its practical application has been inhibited by the combined pressures of an emphasis on evidence-based practice, a risk dominated discourse which has driven practice down a managerialist route, and a neoliberal political agenda which has driven a case management model. Using ethnographic methods, participant observation and unstructured interviews, the research followed a team of family support practitioners within a voluntary sector project in South Wales working in early-intervention social work whose practice was explicitly informed by <b>complexity</b> <b>thinking.</b> This thesis responds to three questions: how <b>complexity</b> <b>thinking</b> informed team members’ understanding of practice and how they worked with families to foster change; what characteristics impacted their ability to effect change in families and manage turbulence within the team and in what ways <b>complexity</b> <b>thinking</b> impacted their understanding and management of risk. Findings suggest that the strong theoretical base of the team, underpinned by <b>complexity</b> <b>thinking,</b> was instrumental in the creation of an environment conducive to effective practice, and a model of practice that encouraged collaboration, consistency, containment, challenge and contingency, for practitioners as well as for families. In addition it enabled the team to be anti-fragile to the significant churn they experienced, a challenge that will be familiar to many in social work. Using Beck’s theory of a risk society the thesis explores the idea that risk is an inescapable component of a fast-changing, reflexive modernity and argues that the assessment and control of risk is something that can never be definitively accomplished. Where risk is unpredictable, especially in such a contested area as child welfare, the most useful methods are those that encourage creativity and adaptability, and this is facilitated by <b>complexity</b> <b>thinking...</b>|$|E

In the interview study, 80 persons of varied religious orientations (28 high, 25 middle and 27 low orthodoxy participants) as measured by Fullerton and Hunsberger’s (1982) Christian Orthodoxy Scale, were selected from a sample of approximately 700 introductory psychology students. Respondents were asked about religious doubts they had experienced, the perceived causes of these doubts {{as well as their}} resolutions. Responses were coded for <b>complexity</b> of <b>thinking</b> to assess thought patterns related to these doubts. <b>Complexity</b> of <b>thinking</b> about religious doubts was related to experiencing religious doubts for three of four complexity measures with those experiencing more doubts being more complex in their thinking about religious doubts. Attribution biases for perceived causes of these doubts for self and others were also examined. Attributions were predominantly situational with participants making significantly more situational attributions for others’ doubts than for their own. This suggested attributions for others’ doubts are not prone to an actor-observer bias. Additionally, highly orthodox individuals tended to believe others were more like them than they actually were, suggesting support for a self-based false consensus effect. The second (questionnaire) study compared integrative complexity scores for religious and nonreligious content areas for 276 introductory psychology students who reported differing levels of religious doubts. Religious doubts were not correlated with thinking about a nonreligious issue and only weakly correlated with a religious issue. This was consistent with the speculation that <b>complexity</b> of <b>thinking</b> is domain-specific. Religious doubt is moderately related to religious doubts for the religious doubt domain, weakly related for more traditional religious content, and not related for capital punishment (nonreligious domain) ...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the relationships between different elements of morality, and assess them from the viewpoint of professional ethics. James Rest’s (1986) Four Component Model of moral behaviour served as the starting point to this work. According to the model, moral behaviour consists of four psychological processes: moral sensitivity (i. e., interpreting the situation), moral judgment (judging which act is right or wrong), moral motivation (values that guide individual’s behaviour)) and moral character (implementing skills). The model was broadened to include <b>complexity</b> of <b>thinking</b> used in solving moral problems, considerations of procedural justice as reflecting the content of moral judgments, and emotional empathy as a motivating factor in moral behaviour. The special focus was on the relation of value priorities to other components of morality, excluding only the moral character component. This thesis consists of four separate studies with correlational, interventional, and experimental designs. Four university student samples and additionally one literature sample were used. Value priorities were measured by the Schwartz Value Survey, moral judgment by applying Colby and Kohlberg’s (1987) moral judgment scoring to non-Kohlbergian dilemmas, <b>complexity</b> of <b>thinking</b> by using integrative complexity coding system (Suedfeld, Tetlock & Streufert, 1992) and emotional empathy by Mehrabian and Epstein’s Questionnaire Measure of Emotional Empathy. Additionally, a measure for moral sensitivity was developed. In sum, this study provided new evidence of complicated links and interactions among the components of the Rest model. The findings supported the pivotal role of value preferences in individuals moral considerations. The main results showed that the Self-Transcendence values were positively related to the other components of morality (moral sensitivity, <b>complexity</b> of <b>thinking,</b> and emotional empathy). On the other hand, the Self-Enhancement values had negative associations with moral components. It was stressed that to promote ethical development in the becoming professionals, the universities should pay attention to the value system they introduce to the students. Furthermore, to be effective, the professional ethics programmes should cover all the components of morality. Endast sammandrag.

40|$|Sustainable development, {{intended}} as a concept for social modernisation on a global scale, focussing on the triple bottom line of social equity, environmental quality and economic prosperity {{can be seen as}} vague and lacking relevance. The UK Government, aware that the achievement of sustainable development required behaviour change by all sectors of society, saw the voluntary sector, good at changing hearts and minds, as having the potential to encourage behaviour change at a local level. Linear approaches to behaviour change based on control and predictability, are challenged by complex problems like sustainable development, and furthermore, their hierarchal approach may be unattractive to the voluntary sector. Behaviour change for sustainable development may require a new approach to change and <b>complexity</b> <b>thinking,</b> enacted through Communities of Practice, offers a new way of thinking or sense making that overcomes the barriers, builds trust, and encourages shared learning to support behaviour change and innovation. <b>Complexity</b> <b>thinking</b> is a non-hierarchical approach that encourages learning from each other by bringing different stakeholders together to share knowledge.

40|$|With the {{creation}} of the Senior Management Service (SMS) in 2001 a specific attempt was made at professionalising the senior management cadre of the Public Service. An inherent requirement for professionalisation is continuous executive development. The article argues that for executive development to meet the requirements of both the organisation and the senior manager, learning and thinking style preferences should be considered in the design and implementation of continuous professional development interventions. The article uses a mixed method research approach to determine the thinking and learning style preferences of senior managers who participated in the Executive Development Programme (EDP) as part of their professional development. The article provides a theoretical perspective of thinking and learning style preferences based on the work done by Kolb (1973) and Neethling (2000). The findings reveal a specific preference towards left brain thinking and learning which is structured, analytical and processdriven with limited preference towards innovative or imaginative considerations. The article argues that the thinking and learning preferences of senior managers is indicative of an environment in which structure and process (or compliance) are emphasised, yet senior managers are expected to be visionary in dealing with service delivery <b>complexities.</b> <b>Thinking</b> and learning preferences should be considered {{in the manner in which}} professional development is driven as well as designed.

Policing, education and welfare are prime examples of this space. Indeed, Perez (2011) suggests that operational police and their leaders face uniquely complex dilemmas.
