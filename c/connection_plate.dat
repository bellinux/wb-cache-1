40|$|Master's thesis in Offshore TechnologyDue to the {{extension}} of the Gullfaks license, Statoil needs to perform several upgrades to systems to satisfy today’s regulations. Today`s system consist of two large single point moored offloading buoys, SPM 1 and SPM 2. Statoil wishes to replace these with a new type of offloading system. The old system is just too expensive to maintain and will demand a comprehensive upgrade to meet the new regulations. The solution is to replace the existing system with a new system which is less expensive to maintain. The existing offloading system consists roughly of a column from seabed to above sea surface, a <b>connection</b> <b>plate</b> and a subsea base structure. This thesis has focused on investigating necessary subsea structure modifications in order to use the existing base structure as interface for the new offloading system. An investigation of the condition of the existing system has been performed, resulting in evaluations and recommendations regarding how to disconnect the <b>connection</b> <b>plate</b> and column from the base structure, and what measures must be taken in order to install a new system on the existing base. The <b>connection</b> <b>plate</b> and column should be disconnected by a combination of ROV and diver assisted operations. The recommended solution is to use ROV in most cases due to economical and safety aspect of the operation. The disconnection will result in good connection possibilities for the new system, regarding both oil flow and locking mechanism. A riser base must be installed onto the base structure, working as an adapter between the base structure and the new offloading system. The investigation revealed that extra sacrificial anodes need to be installed in order to restore sufficient cathodic protection of the structure. The result of a strength analysis performed in SolidWorks Simulation carried out on possible mounting points was very satisfactory and maximum stresses did not exceed 144, 6 MPa with a safety factor of 1, 5. The yield strength of the material is minimum 310 MPa. The base structure is well suited for connecting a new system to the already existing infra-structure. However, this thesis only covers an investigation of what needs to be done. More detail planning and design and production of custom made tooling will be necessary in order to disconnect the <b>connection</b> <b>plate</b> and column...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: The vortex-induced across-wind {{vibrations}} {{of vertical}} bridge tie rods, often {{dominated by the}} so-called lock-in effect, have been proved as a prominent load factor in the dimensioning of particular arched steel bridges. In order to realistically predict the oscillation amplitudes of the bridge hangers, an improved load model has been developed and validated by means of full scale experiments on an arched bridge in Germany. This model is used to estimate the lifetime of the welded <b>connection</b> <b>plate</b> representing the most sensitive part of the hanger. For that, several realisations of stochastic wind processes are generated as input for the load model, and the calculated lift force is applied on the hanger. Individual realisations are characterised by two parameters: by a mean wind velocity and by an initial oscillation amplitude. The stresses in the <b>connection</b> <b>plate</b> are computed according to the structural stress concept. The damage accumulated during an excitation process can be evaluated by using the Palmgren-Miner accumulation rule applied to an appropriate Woehler-(S/N) -curve of the selected material. Analysing several stochastically equivalent realisations of the wind process, a distribution function of the damage can be established. With this and the Weibull function describing the occurrence-frequency of mean wind velocities, the failure probability of the plate can be estimated. In a previous work, G�alffy et al.

40|$|Abstract. In recent years, {{damages in}} welded {{connections}} plates of vertical tie rods of several arched steel bridges have been reported. These damages {{are due to}} fatigue caused by wind-induced vibrations. In the present study, such phenomena are examined and the corresponding lifetime of a reference bridge in Münster-Hiltrup, Germany, is estimated, based on the actual shape of the <b>connection</b> <b>plate.</b> Also, the results obtained are compared to the expected lifetime of a <b>connection</b> <b>plate,</b> whose geometry has been optimized separately. The structural optimization, focussing on {{the shape of the}} cut at the hanger ends, has been carried out using evolution strategies. The oscillation amplitudes have been computed by means of the Newmark-Wilson time-step method, using an appropriate load model, which has been validated by on-site experiments on the selected reference bridge. Corresponding stress-amplitudes are evaluated by multiplying the oscillation amplitudes with a stress concentration factor. This factor has been computed {{on the basis of a}} finite element model of the system “hanger–welding–connection plate”, applying solid elements, according to the notch stress approach. The damage estimation takes into account the stochastics of the exciting wind process, as well as the stochastics of the material parameters (fatigue strength) given in terms of Woehler-curves. The shape optimization results in a substantial increase of the estimated hanger lifetime. The comparison of the lifetimes of the bulk plate and of the welding revealed that, in the optimized structure, the welding, being the most sensitive part in the original structure, shows much more resistance against potential damages than the bulk material. 1...|$|E

For that purpose, experimental tests and finite elements are carried out. The {{failure of a}} high-strength bolt connector is driven by bending deformations developed in the bolt that deform <b>connection</b> <b>plate</b> and pad openings. In the case of ordinary bolt connectors, stress concentration on the bolt shear surface causes a large shear deformation that finally leads to failure. In the case of self-tapping bolt connectors, the insufficient mechanical bite force of the screw thread yields the bolt misalignment and concentrates shear deformation. As a result, the high-strength bolt connector is the most efficient design solution.

40|$|Cross {{frames are}} {{critical}} members for {{the stability of}} straight and curved steel bridges. Conventional cross frames are often fabricated from steel angles; however these members have relatively poor structural behavior. Because of the low buckling strength, cross frames with angle diagonals are often designed as tension-only systems, therefore increasing the necessary steel. The angles are also connected through one leg resulting in eccentric connections causing bending of the members and potentially reducing the fatigue performance. Improved behavior may result if concentric members are utilized for the cross frames. The increased buckling strength of tubes and double angles results in effective members in both tension and compression, and a single diagonal cross frame can provide effective bracing. Although there are structural advantages of utilizing concentric members, a suitable connection must be developed. Tubes are often connected by slitting the tube {{in the center and}} welding to a <b>connection</b> <b>plate,</b> which requires precise fabrication and relatively poor fatigue behavior. One proposed solution is to use a steel casting designed to connect easily to the beams and to seal the end of the tube (preventing exposure to atmospheric conditions) ...|$|E

40|$|Prior to 1985, it {{was common}} {{practice}} to avoid welding the connection plates to the tension flange of the girders of steel bridges.

40|$|Some of the Iowa Department of Transportation (Iowa DOT) continuous, steel, welded {{plate girder}} bridges have {{developed}} web cracking in the negative moment regions at the diaphragm connection plates. The cracks are due to out-of-plane bending of the web near the top flange of the girder. The out-of-plane bending occurs in the "web-gap", which is {{the portion of the}} girder web between (1) the top of the fillet welds attaching the diaphragm <b>connection</b> <b>plate</b> to the web and (2) the fillet welds attaching the flange to the web. A literature search indicated that four retrofit techniques have been suggested by other researchers to prevent or control this type of cracking. To eliminate the problem in new bridges, AASHTO specifications require a positive attachment between the <b>connection</b> <b>plate</b> and the top (tension) flange. Applying this requirement to existing bridges is expensive and difficult. The Iowa DOT has relied primarily on the hole-drilling technique to prevent crack extension once cracking has occurred; however, the literature indicates that hole-drilling alone may not be entirely effective in preventing crack extension. The objective of this research was to investigate experimentally a method proposed by the Iowa DOT to prevent cracking at the diaphragm/plate girder connection in steel bridges with X-type or K-type diaphragms. The method consists of loosening the bolts at some connections between the diaphragm diagonals and the connection plates. The investigation included selecting and testing five bridges: three with X-type diaphragms and two with K-type diaphragms. During 1996 and 1997, these bridges were instrumented using strain gages and displacement transducers to obtain the response at various locations before and after implementing the method. Bridges were subjected to loaded test trucks traveling in different lanes with speeds varying from crawl speed to 65 mph (104 km/h) to determine the effectiveness of the proposed method. The results of the study show that the effect of out-of-plane loading was confined to widths of approximately 4 in. (100 mm) {{on either side of the}} connection plates. Further, they demonstrate that the stresses in gaps with drilled holes were higher than those in gaps without cracks, implying that the drilling hole technique is not sufficient to prevent crack extension. The behavior of the web gaps in X-type diaphragm bridges was greatly enhanced by the proposed method as the stress range and out-of-plane distortion were reduced by at least 42 % at the exterior girders. For bridges with K-type diaphragms, a similar trend was obtained. However, the stress range increased in one of the web gaps after implementing the proposed method. Other design aspects (wind, stability of compression flange, and lateral distribution of loads) must be considered when deciding whether to adopt the proposed method. Considering the results of this investigation, the proposed method can be implemented for X-type diaphragm bridges. Further research is recommended for K-type diaphragm bridges...|$|E

40|$|Infra-red {{thermography}} {{systems that}} have been developed {{over the last few years}} offer great potential to locate and discover flaws in steel highway bridge structures at a relatively early stage in their development. Under ideal conditions, the use of infra-red instrumentation should allow bridge inspection personnel to rapidly scan the structure and determine if a potential structural problem has developed. If a problem spot is located by the infra-red camera, then the trouble spot can be examined carefully to determine the need for corrective maintenance. The primary purpose of this research study is to evaluate the accuracy and reliability of sensitive infra-red equipment for detecting fatigue cracks in steel highway bridge structures and components. The performance and sensitivity of one particular infra-red system was explored by conducting tests on two different specimen types in the laboratory, followed by a check of the equipment under field conditions. Crack detection sensitivity in the laboratory was evaluated using a center-hole test coupon geometry as well as a welded attachment plate detail. The test samples were subjected to cyclic loading to initiate and propagate a fatigue crack. Control variables for the infra-red system were then varied to evaluate the optimal conditions. The field tests were conducted to assess the equipment limitations and performance under field conditions. The detail inspected involved a vertical plate that was welded to the web of a beam member and used to attach transverse diaphragm cross-frame members; the diaphragm <b>connection</b> <b>plate</b> was selected for inspection because it was known that fatigue cracks had developed at the end of a number of the vertical plates.

Consequently, the crack size that could be reliably and consistently detected was not significantly different from that which could be detected from a careful visual inspection. Moreover, a number of difficulties were encountered when using infra-red inspection in the field. Limitations were encountered in the field related to mobility of the equipment, calibration requirements, operator skill level required, and the variable effects of environmental factors that influence the detection capabilities...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2013 Gusset <b>plate</b> <b>connections</b> are {{commonly}} used to join members in steel truss bridges. Most gusset <b>plate</b> <b>connections</b> were designed to provide sufficient thickness to resist tensile and shear forces as well as compression buckling based on simple approximations. The 2007 collapse of the I- 35 W Bridge in Minnesota necessitated the safety assessment of gusset plates and prompted several studies of gusset plate behavior. The complex geometry and various loading profiles {{make it difficult to}} analyze and estimate maximum stress in gusset plates and its capacity. This research focuses on numerical simulation of steel truss bridge gusset <b>plate</b> <b>connections.</b> A simple but accurate finite element modeling methodology was developed to efficiently simulate gusset <b>plate</b> <b>connection</b> subassemblages. A rapid procedure for assessing gusset plate safety, namely Triage Evaluation Procedure (TEP), was developed to predict the onset of gusset plate yielding. This procedure considers the worst-case scenario for the interaction of stresses generated by connected truss members and conservatively identifies at risk gusset plates. A Refined Evaluation Procedure (REP) was then developed to predict stress distributions at critical sections using simple and idealized approximate stress distribution models. By using these stress distribution models at the critical sections, the location and magnitude of the maximum stress in the gusset <b>plate</b> <b>connections</b> can be estimated. The TEP and REP are two-step evaluation procedures to provide fast and accurate estimate for gusset plate yield capacity. In addition to the gusset plates, rivet shear resistance needs to be considered to evaluate the overall safety of gusset <b>plate</b> <b>connections.</b> Rivet shear strength, rivet ductility, connected member yielding, and the effect of connection length were identified as factors which affect joint strength. The current AASHTO bridge evaluation code does not consider all four factors and yields an overly-conservative estimate of joint shear resistance. A revised equation which considers ``Strong'' and ``Weak" connected elements and produces a more reasonable estimate of joint shear resistance is recommended...|$|R
40|$|Many {{existing}} steel bridges in Japan {{were built}} in high economic growth period {{and the number of}} bridges over 50 years will increase drastically in the upcoming years. Due to the heavy traffic and severe natural environment, the deterioration and damage will increase rapidly. Improvement of technologies related to inspection, diagnosis, repair, reinforcement and appropriate maintenance is needed. Concerning the steel truss bridges, the serious corrosion damage has been reported recently, especially on the diagonal members and the gusset <b>plate</b> <b>connections.</b> The fracture of these members of steel truss bridge is likely to lead the collapse of the entire truss bridge. In this study, the detailed corrosion shape of the two lower gusset <b>plate</b> <b>connections</b> that were cut from the steel truss bridge were measured by using the laser measurement equipment, and the actual corrosion state of the outside and the narrow inside surfaces of the lower chord members and the gusset <b>plate</b> <b>connections</b> were evaluated {{on the basis of the}} corrosion depth distribution of these surfaces．Based on the detailed results of corrosion measurement, the corrosion states and the corrosion characteristics of reinforced and non- reinforced gusset <b>plate</b> <b>connections</b> were clarified. Key word: corrosion, lower chord member, gusset plate, steel truss bridge 1...|$|R
40|$|Design of the {{distance}} of bolts {{to each other and}} design of {{the distance}} of bolts to the edge of <b>connection</b> <b>plates</b> are made based on minimum and maximum boundary values proposed by structural codes. In this study, reliabilities of those distances were investigated. For this purpose, loading types, bolt types and plate thicknesses were taken as variable parameters. Monte Carlo Simulation (MCS) method was used in the reliability computations performed for all combination of those parameters. At the end of study, all reliability index values for all those distances were presented in graphics and tables. Results obtained from this study compared with the values proposed by some structural codes and finally some evaluations were made about those comparisons. Finally, It was emphasized in the end of study that, it would be incorrect of the usage of the same bolt distances in the both traditional designs and the higher reliability level designs. </span...|$|R
