50|$|Thus if athletes do many ladder, hurdle or <b>cone</b> <b>drills,</b> {{they learn}} to drive the knees upward rather than forward. If instead they {{duplicated}} a true cutting action in which the feet {{stay close to the}} ground and the knees are driven forward it could bring about a positive transfer that could improve skill execution. Practicing the cutting action in a drill would be much more productive.|$|R
25|$|An {{internal}} collet {{can be used}} to lock two telescoping tubes together. In {{this case}} the collet {{is in the form of}} a truncated <b>cone</b> <b>drilled</b> and threaded down the centreline. The collet diameter matches the bore of the inner tube, having the larger end slightly greater than the bore while the smaller diameter is slightly less than the bore. A threaded stud, anchored at its other end to the tube, is then used to pull the collet into the tube. The increasing diameter of the collet forces the inner tube to expand and be pushed against the inner wall of the outer tube thus locking the two tubes together. The inner tube is often slotted to facilitate this expansion.|$|R
50|$|However, {{the cutting}} action, {{which is the}} basis for running agility, {{is not a matter of}} fast feet, it is a matter of fast legs. One must be able to move the legs from the hips in order to move quickly or to execute quick cutting actions. In addition, the feet must remain close to the ground {{regardless}} of whether the step being taking is short or long. In other words, as the cut is being executed, the body is lowered and as the athlete pushes off, he steps out with the leg closest to the direction in which he wishes to move. He then takes a step out with the leg and turns the body so he can quickly assume the running position. At times, it is necessary that the athlete have the ability to rotate the hips and/or shoulders a full 90° in order to be more evasive in the cutting action. This allows him to maintain eye contact with his opponent and maintain his shoulders in a front-facing position. In so doing, the opponent does not get any hints that a change in direction is about to take place.Hurdle drills are essentially the same as ladder drills since their execution is basically the same. In these drills, you move in a linear or sideward manner. <b>Cone</b> <b>drills</b> however, are used mainly for side movements. In the drills, you leap sideways over a cone in one direction and then back in the opposite direction. The key to successful execution is for an athlete to bring their knees to their chest to successfully clear the top of the cone. This does not duplicate the cutting action.|$|R

Though voted to the second-team of the Coaches Preseason All-Southeastern Conference (SEC) squad, an honorific roster composed of the second-best players in the SEC, ESPN writers Edward Aschoff and Chris Low ranked Gragg as the best tight end in the conference. In Arkansas' season opener against the Jacksonville State Gamecocks, Gragg accumulated 110 {{yards and two touchdowns}} over 7 catches, a performance for which he earned the John Mackey Tight End of the Week award. On September 9, Gragg suffered a bone bruise in his knee against the Rutgers Scarlet Knights which caused him to miss the next three games; upon return, Gragg reaggravated the injury and missed the rest of the season's matches. He finished his final season at Arkansas with 22 receptions for 289 yards and three touchdowns, while the team ended with a 4–8 record; academically, he graduated with a degree in sports management. After his senior year, Gragg participated in the NFL Scouting Combine, where he ran the fastest 40-yard dash time, the third-fastest 3 <b>cone</b> <b>drill,</b> had the third-longest broad jump, and the second-highest vertical jump of all tight ends in attendance.

40|$|The {{investigation}} of topologically protected waves in classical media has opened unique opportunities to achieve exotic properties like one-way phonon transport, protection from backscattering and immunity to imperfections. Contrary to acoustic and electromagnetic domains, their observation in elastic solids {{has so far}} been elusive due to the presence of both shear and longitudinal modes and their modal conversion at interfaces and free surfaces. Here we report the experimental observation of topologically protected helical edge waves in elastic media. The considered structure consists of an elastic plate patterned according to a Kagome architecture with an accidental degeneracy of two Dirac <b>cones</b> induced by <b>drilling</b> through holes. The careful breaking of symmetries couples the corresponding elastic modes which effectively emulates spin orbital coupling in the quantum spin Hall effect.

40|$|Background: Hematophagy arose {{independently}} {{multiple times}} during metazoan evolution, with several lineages of vampire animals particularly diversified in invertebrates. However, the biochemistry of hematophagy {{has been studied}} in a few species of direct medical interest and is still underdeveloped in most invertebrates, as in general {{is the study of}} venom toxins. In cone snails, leeches, arthropods and snakes, the strong target specificity of venom toxins uniquely aligns them to industrial and academic pursuits (pharmacological applications, pest control etc.) and provides a biochemical tool for studying biological activities including cell signalling and immunological response. Neogastropod snails (<b>cones,</b> oyster <b>drills</b> etc.) are carnivorous and include active predators, scavengers, grazers on sessile invertebrates and hematophagous parasites; most of them use venoms to efficiently feed. It has been hypothesized that trophic innovations were the main drivers of rapid radiation of Neogastropoda in the late Cretaceous. We present here the first molecular characterization of the alimentary secretion of a non-conoidean neogastropod, Colubraria reticulata. Colubrariids successfully feed on the blood of fishes, throughout the secretion into the host of a complex mixture of anaesthetics and anticoagulants. We used a NGS RNA-Seq approach, integrated with differential expression analyses and custom searches for putative secreted feeding-related proteins, to describe in detail the salivary and mid-oesophageal transcriptomes of this Mediterranean vampire snail, with functional and evolutionary insights on major families of bioactive molecules. Results: A remarkably low level of overlap was observed between the gene expression in the two target tissues, which also contained a high percentage of putatively secreted proteins when compared to the whole body. At least 12 families of feeding-related proteins were identified, including: 1) anaesthetics, such as ShK Toxin-containing proteins and turripeptides (ion-channel blockers), Cysteine-rich secretory proteins (CRISPs), Adenosine Deaminase (ADA); 2) inhibitors of primary haemostasis, such as novel vWFA domain-containing proteins, the Ectonucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase family member 5 (ENPP 5) and the wasp Antigen- 5; 3) anticoagulants, such as TFPI-like multiple Kunitz-type protease inhibitors, Peptidases S 1 (PS 1), CAP/ShKT domain-containing proteins, Astacin metalloproteases and Astacin/ShKT domain-containing proteins; 4) additional proteins, such the Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme (ACE: vasopressive) and the cytolytic Porins. Conclusions:Colubraria feeding physiology seems to involve inhibitors of both primary and secondary haemostasis, anaesthetics, a vasoconstrictive enzyme to reduce feeding time and tissue-degrading proteins such as Porins and Astacins. The complexity of Colubraria venomous cocktail and the divergence from the arsenal of the few neogastropods studied to date (mostly conoideans) suggest that biochemical diversification of neogastropods might be largely underestimated and worth of extensive investigation.

40|$|This report {{examines}} {{the most current}} literature and information available on characterization and remediation technologies {{that could be used}} on the Nevada Test Site (NTS) historical hydronuclear test areas. Historical hydronuclear tests use high explosives and a small amount of plutonium. The explosion scatters plutonium within a contained subsurface environment. There is currently a need to characterize these test areas to determine the spatial extent of plutonium in the subsurface and whether geohydrologic processes are transporting the plutonium away from the event site. Three technologies were identified to assist in the characterization of the sites. These technologies are the Pipe Explorer{trademark}, <b>cone</b> penetrometer, and <b>drilling.</b> If the characterization results indicate that remediation is needed, three remediation technologies were identified that should be appropriate, namely: capping or sealing the surface, in situ grouting, and in situ vitrification. Capping the surface would prevent vertical infiltration of water into the soil column, but would not restrict lateral movement of vadose zone water. Both the in situ grouting and vitrification techniques would attempt to immobilize the radioactive contaminants to restrict or prevent leaching of the radioactive contaminants into the groundwater. In situ grouting uses penetrometers or boreholes to inject the soil below the contaminant zone with low permeability grout. In situ vitrification melts the soil containing contaminants into a solid block. This technique would provide a significantly longer contaminant immobilization, but some research and development would be required to re-engineer existing systems for use at deep soil depths. Currently, equipment can only handle shallow depth vitrification. After existing documentation on the historical hydronuclear tests have been reviewed and the sites have been visited, more specific recommendations will be made...|$|R
40|$|Image-to-physical {{registration}} {{based on}} volumetric data like computed tomography {{on the one}} side and intraoperative endoscopic images on the other side is an important method for various surgical applications. In this contribution, we present methods to generate panoramic views from endoscopic recordings for image-to-physical registration of narrow drill holes inside spongy bone. One core application is the registration of drill poses inside the mastoid during minimally invasive cochlear implantations. Besides the development of image processing software for registration, investigations are performed on a miniaturized optical system, achieving 360 ° radial imaging with one shot by extending a conventional, small, rigid, rod lens endoscope. A reflective cone geometry is used to deflect radially incoming light rays into the endoscope optics. Therefore, a cone mirror is mounted in front of a conventional 0 ° endoscope. Furthermore, panoramic images of inner drill hole surfaces in artificial bone material are created. Prior to <b>drilling,</b> <b>cone</b> beam computed tomography data is acquired from this artificial bone and simulated endoscopic views are generated from this data. A qualitative and quantitative image comparison of resulting views in terms of image-to-image registration is performed. First results show that downsizing of panoramic optics to a diameter of 3 mm is possible. Conventional rigid rod lens endoscopes can be extended to produce suitable panoramic one-shot image data. Using unrolling and stitching methods, images of the inner drill hole surface similar to computed tomography image data of the same surface were created. Registration is performed on ten perturbations of the search space and results in target registration errors of (0 : 487 ± 0 : 438) mm at the entry point and (0 : 957 ± 0 : 948) mm at the exit as well as an angular error of (1 : 763 ± 1 : 536) °. The results show suitability of this image data for image-to-image registration. Analysis of the error components in different directions reveals a strong influence of the pattern structure, meaning higher diversity results into smaller errors. © 2017 SPIE...|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} {{validate}} 3 D models of sedimentation in active sedimentary environments, detailed stratigraphic information {{from both the}} land and the sea is indispensable. However, this land-sea-boundary often remains a blank spot, as it presents serious technological challenges. In the present study land- and sea-based shallow geophysics were tested in a tidal estuary environment with the aim to assess the validity, consistency and vertical resolution of each method. The test site is located in the Verdronken land van Saeftinghe, at the southern rim of the Westerschelde estuary, The Netherlands. It consists of some 3000 ha of salt marshes, intertidal mudflats and sandy shoals, cut by numerous creeks and gully systems. The shallow subsurface is made up of alternating sand, clay and peat layers. Data acquisition focussed on the top 10 - 20 m. During high tide marine data were obtained from the major creeks; at low tide land data were obtained from exposed sand bars and salt marshes. Applied techniques included VHR land and marine seismics, geo-electrical & electromagnetic methods (land + marine), CPT and shallow coring on land. Lightweight equipment and small boats provided a fast and effective survey means, crucial in difficult terrain conditions. Marine seismic profiling involved different sources (Parametric Echosounder, Seistec, 3. 5 kHz Echosounder, Boomer). The first two yielded excellent images (vertical resolution 15 - 25 cm); the latter two proved inadequate in very shallow water. Land seismic trials included S- & P-wave vibrator, (sledge-) hammer, and drop weight (geophone spacing 25 cm). DC resistivity tests on land involved inverse Schlumberger and dipoledipole arrays with 1 - 2 m electrode spacing. Transient electromagnetic (TEM) trials were done using 3 different loop sizes were tested (6. 25 - 12. 5 - 25 m). Marine resistivity profiling involved a dipole-dipole array (9 electrodes, 6 m spacing). CPT measurements were carried with a small 50 kN device (36 mm <b>cone).</b> Manual <b>drilling</b> was done using so-called van der Staaij cores. The seismic data provided by far the best subsurface image. Marine profiles revealed the internal structure of lateral accretion surfaces in shifting palaeo-gullies in very high detail. Penetration however was often limited to a few m, probably due to shallow gas. Some gassy patches appeared to shift laterally over time. Land seismic profiles showed different reflectors in the upper 10 m. The best resolution was obtained with the S-wave vibrator (30 - 40 cm). The resistivity methods suffered from the effect of tidal action and (salt/brackish) water intrusion, and mostly did not allow a clear identification of the shallow stratification. Some weak internal layering could be observed on the shallow TEM data, but with a much lower resolution compared to the acoustic data. Furthermore the application of resistivity techniques on land proved very strenuous. Shallow cores and CPT’s revealed a sequence of sandy to clayey deposits and a marked peat layer. Correlation with the shallow seismic reflections was generally very good. The high resolution of the terrestrial S-wave data, and their high sensitivity to small changes in soil type, allowed observation of subtle transitions from sandy to sandy clay. However, the high lateral variability of the sediments (even for distances on mscale) often complicated precise correlation between the different data sets. Nevertheless, these first results indicate that the integrated use of well-tuned acoustic techniques (both marine & land) and strategically located ground-truth information (from cores & CPT) will provide a better understanding of complex estuarine sedimentary environment...|$|R
