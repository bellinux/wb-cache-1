40|$|The goal is {{to measure}} the {{temperature}} of some system. The ability to do so accurately and with the required resolution depends {{on a variety of}} factors. The <b>calibration</b> <b>report</b> from Lake Shore (or any calibration facility) is only the first step in determining the accuracy of the temperature measurement in the end-user’s system. A more quantifiable term than accuracy is total uncertainty of the measurement. This is simply the measurement itself and an estimate of all the errors of the measurement. Smaller errors are considered more accurate. The first step in estimating the errors in a customer system is the calibration itself.

40|$|The ASCAT {{instrument}} onboard MetOp {{is a real}} aperture vertically polarized C-band radar {{with high}} radiometric stability. It has two sets of three fixed fan beam antennas, each set pointing at {{either side of the}} sub-satellite track. Because of the similarities of both the ERS (scatterometer) and ASCAT measurement systems, we have the opportunity to use the ERS geophysical model function (GMF) as a calibration tool for ASCAT. A method, based on the visualization of the 3 -dimensional measurement space, will be used to determine and remove beam-to-beam biases and verify the GMF.

After testing the proper functioning of the sensor, the best materials for the capsule are determined based on acoustic properties. The capsule is designed and built by NPS staff. To predict {{the sensitivity of the}} encapsulated sensor, the characteristic equations are modified to reflect the new medium. In {{order to be able to}} predict the sensitivity of the encapsulated sensor, the performance ratio is determined between the sensitivity in air and the filling fluid of choice. Temperature dependency is introduced in the relevant parameters to be able to model the sensitivity at various operating temperatures. The measured sensitivity from the <b>calibration</b> <b>report</b> is then used to predict its performance in castor oil. The theoretical sensitivity model is verified by experimental data gathered from calibration studies at NUWC. The verified model is then used to analyze the consequences of changing critical operating parameters like the distance between the filaments and the operating temperature. Based on these calculations, recommendations are made for a better performing prototype. Eventually a new design is proposed that increases sensitivity significantly and is better adapted to operate in the filling fluid. Lieutenant Commander, Royal Netherlands Nav...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Sub-Saharan Africa {{contains}} {{the highest number}} of people affected by droughts. Although this can easily be mitigated through the provision of timely, reliable and relevant weather forecasts, the sparse network of weather stations in most of these countries makes this difficult. Rapid development in wireless sensor networks has resulted in weatherboards capable of capturing weather parameters at the micro-level. Although these weatherboards offer a viable solution to Africa’s drought, the acceptability of such data by meteorologists is only possible if these sensors are calibrated and their field readiness scientifically evaluated. This is the contribution of this paper; we present results of a calibration exercise that was carried out to: (1) measure and correct lag, random and systematic errors; (2) determine if Perspex was an ideal material for building sensor boards ’ enclosures; and (3) identify sensor boards’ battery charging and depletion rates. The result is a <b>calibration</b> <b>report</b> detailing actual error and uncertainty values for atmospheric pressure, humidity and temperature sensors, as well as the recharge and discharge curves of the batteries.

40|$|Global {{climate change}} {{is one of the}} major {{challenges}} that all nations are commonly facing. Long-term observations of the Antarctic ice sheet have been playing a critical role in quantitatively estimating and predicting effects resulting from the global changes. The film-based ARGON reconnaissance imagery provides a remarkable data source for studying the Antarctic ice-sheet in 1960 s, thus greatly extending the time period of Antarctica surface observations. To deal with the low-quality images and the unavailability of camera poses, a systematic photogrammetric approach is proposed to reconstruct the interior and exterior orientation information for further glacial mapping applications, including ice flow velocity mapping and mass balance estimation. Some noteworthy details while performing geometric modelling using the ARGON images were introduced, including methods and results for handling specific effects of film deformation, damaged or missing fiducial marks and <b>calibration</b> <b>report,</b> automatic fiducial mark detection, control point selection through Antarctic shadow and ice surface terrain analysis, and others.

This paper intends to evaluate the planimetric accuracy of a PRISM scene, with processing levels 1 B 2 G and 1 B 2 R, acquired on a flat and mountainous area by means of 40 to 47 check points, determined by static relative GPS positioning in lower altitudes (up to 69 meters) and in higher altitude areas (between 102 and 558 meters). The results showed that, in this specific studied area, the displacements observed in the check points, when compared to their homologous positions in the image 1 B 2 G, were {{very close to the}} indicated values by JAXA (Japanese Space Agency) in the second <b>calibration</b> <b>report,</b> in accordance to the PEC (Cartographic Pattern of Accuracy) for the first class of 1 : 50. 000 scale.

40|$|A {{test area}} north of Philadelphia was flown with Vexcel Imaging UltraCamD, UltraCamX and Z/I Imaging DMC digital frame cameras {{as well as}} with the 3 D-CCD-line scanner camera Leica ADS 40 and the {{analogue}} RC 30. The frame images have 60 % overlap in both directions. The object resolution is approximately the same with ~ 5 cm ground sampling distance (GSD). 42 well defined control and check points are available with sufficient accuracy. Even if the nominal GSD is approximately the same, this must not correspond to the effective object resolution. This has been investigated by edge analysis – a sudden change of the grey values in the object space is causing a continuous change of the grey values in the image. A differentiation of the grey value profile leads to the point spread function and from the point spread function the effective resolution can be determined. Corresponding to the information about the modulation transfer function in the <b>calibration</b> <b>report,</b> UltraCam-images have in the corners a lower modulation transfer function. In the case of pan-sharpened UltraCam images in general a loss of up to 30 % of the image quality against original panchromatic images has been seen. The aerial image, scanned with 13 microns, has a factor for the effective resolution of approximately 1. 4; that means it corresponds to an image scanned with 18 microns pixel size. The large size digital frame images are merged from 4 separate panchromatic cameras and the colour cameras.

In the meantime the higher resolution UltraCamX came to the market and the geometry of the other cameras have been improved mainly by changed software modules for merging the sub-images to the homogenous virtual images. For an inspection of the current cameras, test flights with the 3 mentioned cameras {{as well as with the}} analogue RC 30 have been made over the same area. Approximately 70 images have been taken by each camera with a ground sampling distance of ~ 5 cm. The generation of pan-sharpened images may cause slightly different image geometry like the original pan-images. For the DMC beside the pan-images, pan-sharpened colour images and false colour infrared images are available, while the UltraCamX- and the UltraCamD-images are given only as pan-sharpened colour images. Beside the geometric property, the information content of the images is important. The number of pixels per image is only an indication. As shown in the <b>calibration</b> <b>report,</b> especially for UltraCam-images the modulation transfer function is not optimal in the image corners. By edge analysis the effective resolution of the images has been investigated. The lower image quality in the corners is obvious, but in the case of lower sun angle the image quality of UltraCam scenes is reduced in the whole image up to 30 %.

40|$|A major {{objective}} of the grant was to complete the fabrication, test, and evaluation of the atmosphere structure experiment on the Galileo Probe, and to receive, analyze, and interpret data received from the spacecraft. The grantee was competitively selected to be Principal Investigator of Jupiter's atmosphere structure on the Galileo Probe. His primary motivation was {{to learn as much}} as possible about Jupiter's atmosphere by means of a successful atmosphere structure experiment, and to support the needs and schedule of the Galileo Project. After a number of launch delays, the Flight instrument was shipped to Kennedy Space Center 2 years after the start of this collaboration, on April 14, 1989, at which time it was determined from System level tests of the ASI on the Probe that the instrument was in good working order and ready for flight. The spacecraft was launched on October 18, 1989. Data analysis of test and calibration data taken over a period of years of instrument testing was continued in preparation for the encounter. The initial instrument checkout in space was performed on October 26, 1989. The data set received by telemetry was thoroughly analyzed, and a report of the findings was transmitted to the Probe Operations Office on Feb. 28, 1990. Key findings reported were that the accelerometer biases had shifted by less than 1 mg through launch and since calibration at Bell Aerospace in 1983; accelerometer scale factors, evaluated by means of calibration currents, fell on lines of variation with temperature established in laboratory calibrations; pressure sensor offsets, correlated as a function of temperature, fell generally within the limits of several years of ground test data; atmospheric and engineering temperature sensor data were internally consistent within a few tenths of a degree; and the instrument electronics performed all expected functions without any observable fault. Altogether, this checkout was highly encouraging of the prospects of instrument performance, although performed greater than 5 years prior to Jupiter encounter. Capability of decoding the science data from the Experiment Data Record to be provided at encounter was developed and exercised using the tape recording of the first Cruise Checkout data. A team effort was organized to program the selection and combination of data words defining pressure, temperature, acceleration, turbulence, and engineering quantities; to apply decalibration algorithms to convert readings from digital numbers to physical quantities; and to organize the data into a suitable printout. A paper on the Galileo Atmosphere Structure Instrument was written and submitted for publication in a special issue of Space Science Reviews. At the Journal editor's request, the grantee reviewed other Probe instrument papers submitted for this special issue. Calibration data were carefully taken for all experiment sensors and accumulated over a period of 10 years. The data were analyzed, fitted with algorithms, and summarized in a <b>calibration</b> <b>report</b> for use in analyzing and interpreting data returned from Jupiter's atmosphere.

The work has resulted in more than 10 articles published in archive journals, 2 encyclopedia articles, and many working papers. This final report is organized around the four planets on which there was activity, Jupiter, Mars, Venus, and Titan, with a closing section on Miscellaneous Activities. A major objective was to complete the fabrication, test, and evaluation of the atmosphere structure experiment on the Galileo probe, and to receive, analyze and interpret data received from the spacecraft. The instrument was launched on April 14, 1989. Calibration data were taken for all experiment sensors. The data were analyzed, fitted with algorithms, and summarized in a <b>calibration</b> <b>report</b> for use in analyzing and interpreting data returned from Jupiter's atmosphere. The sensors included were the primary science pressure, temperature and acceleration sensors, and the supporting engineering temperature sensors. Computer programs were written to decode the Experiment Data Record and convert the digital numbers to physical quantities, i. e., temperatures, pressures, and accelerations. The project office agreed to obtain telemetry of checkout data from the probe. Work to extend programs written for use on the Pioneer Venus project included: (1) massive heat shield ablation leading to important mass loss during entry; and (2) rapid planet rotation, which introduced terms of motion not needed on Venus. When the Galileo Probe encountered Jupiter, analysis and interpretation of data commenced. The early contributions of the experiment were to define (1) {{the basic structure of}} the deep atmosphere, (2) the stability of the atmosphere, (3) the upper atmospheric profiles of density, pressure, and temperature. The next major task in the Galileo Probe project was to refine, verify and extend the analysis of the data. It was the verified, and corrected data, which indicated a dry abiabatic atmosphere within measurement accuracy. Temperature in the thermosphere was measured at 900 K. Participation in the Mars atmospheric research included: (1) work as a team member of the Mars Atmosphere Working Group, (2) contribution to the Mars Exobiology Instrument workshop, (3) asssistance in planning the Mars global network and (4) assitance in planning the Soviet-French Mars mission in 1994. This included a return to the Viking Lander parachute data to refine and improve the definition of winds between 1. 5 and 4 kilometer altitude at the two entry sites. The variability of the structure of Mars atmosphere was addressed, which is known to vary with season, latitude, hemisphere and dust loading of the atmosphere. This led to work on the Pathfinder project. The probe had a deployable meteorology mast that had three temperature sensors, and a wind sensor {{at the tip of the}} mast. Work on the Titan atmospheric probe was also accomplished. This included developing an experiment proposal to the European Space Agency (ESA), which was not selected. However, as an advisor in the design and preparation of the selected experiment the researcher interacted with scientist on the Huygens Probe Atmosphere Structure Experiment. The researcher also participated in the planning for the Venus Chemical Probe. The science objectives of the probe were to resolve unanswered questions concerning the minor species chemistry of Venus' atmosphere that control cloud formation, greenhouse effectiveness, and the thermal structure. The researcher also reviewed problems with the Pioneer Venus Probe, that caused anomalies which occurred on the Probes at and below 12. 5 km level of the Venus' atmosphere. He convened and participated in a workshop that concluded the most likely hardware cause was insulation failure in the electrical harness outside the Probes' pressure vessels. It was discovered that the shrink tubing material failed at 600 K. This failure could explain the anomalies experienced by the probes.

Calibration {{is the process of}} determining the values of unobservable parameters by constraining model output to replicate observed data. Because there are many approaches for model calibration and little consensus on best practices, we surveyed the literature to catalogue the use and reporting of these methods in cancer simulation models. We conducted a MEDLINE search (1980 through 2006) for articles on cancer-screening models and supplemented search results with articles from our personal reference databases. For each article, two authors independently abstracted pre-determined items using a standard form. Data items included cancer site, model type, methods used for determination of unobservable parameter values and description of any calibration protocol. All authors reached consensus on items of disagreement. Reviews and non-cancer models were excluded. Articles describing analytical models, which estimate parameters with statistical approaches (e. g. maximum likelihood) were catalogued separately. Models that included unobservable parameters were analysed and classified by whether <b>calibration</b> methods were <b>reported</b> and if so, the methods used. The review process yielded 154 articles that met our inclusion criteria and, of these, we concluded that 131 may have used calibration methods to determine model parameters. Although the term 'calibration' was not always used, descriptions of calibration or 'model fitting' were found in 50 % (n[*]-[*] 66) of the articles, with an additional 16 % (n[*]-[*] 21) providing a reference to methods. Calibration target data were identified in nearly all of these articles. Other methodological details, such as the goodness-of-fit metric, were discussed in 54 % (n[*]-[*] 47 of 87) of the articles <b>reporting</b> <b>calibration</b> methods, while few details were provided on the algorithms used to search the parameter space. Our review shows that the use of cancer simulation modelling is increasing, although thorough descriptions of calibration procedures are rare in the published literature for these models. Calibration is a key component of model development and is central to the validity and credibility of subsequent analyses and inferences drawn from model predictions. To aid peer-review and facilitate discussion of modelling methods, we propose a standardized <b>Calibration</b> <b>Reporting</b> Checklist for model documentation. ...|$|R

The various factors influencing {{the determination of the}} efficiency include the I-V measurement system, reference cell <b>calibration,</b> standard <b>reporting</b> conditions, area measurement, light source characteristics, temperature measurement and control, and the measurement procedures. Each of these sources contributes to the precision index and bias limit which is combined to obtain the total uncertainty in the efficiency. These factors are discussed as well as how to minimize differences in the reported AM 0 efficiency of a given PV cell between various laboratories...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In this work, low density {{polyethylene}} (LDPE) was {{grafted with}} trifluoroacetic acid allyl ester using γ-ray irradiation from a Cobalt- 60 source at different adsorbed doses. It {{was found that the}} grafting degree increases with the absorbed doses. The highest grafting degree was obtained at 100 kGy of absorbed dose and with 30 wt % of trifluoroacetic acid allyl ester. The grafting was identified with fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) using a <b>calibration</b> curve <b>reported</b> in literature. Thermal properties of the functional polymers were studied by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and the surface morphology was investigated by scanning electron microscope (SEM) ...|$|R
40|$|Kamil is a 45 m {{diameter}} {{impact crater}} identified in 2008 in southern Egypt. It was {{generated by the}} hypervelocity impact of the Gebel Kamil iron meteorite on a sedimentary target, namely layered sandstones with subhorizontal bedding. We have carried out a petrographic study of samples from the crater wall and ejecta deposits collected during our first geophysical campaign (February 2010) in order to investigate shock effects recorded in these rocks. Ejecta samples reveal {{a wide range of}} shock features common in quartz-rich target rocks. They have been divided into two categories, as a function of their abundance at thin section scale: (1) pervasive shock features (the most abundant), including fracturing, planar deformation features, and impact melt lapilli and bombs, and (2) localized shock features (the least abundant) including high-pressure phases and localized impact melting in the form of intergranular melt, melt veins, and melt films in shatter cones. In particular, Kamil crater is the smallest impact crater where shatter cones, coesite, stishovite, diamond, and melt veins have been reported. Based on experimental <b>calibrations</b> <b>reported</b> in the literature, pervasive shock features suggest that the maximum shock pressure was between 30 and 60 GPa. Using the planar impact approximation, we calculate a vertical component of the impact velocity of at least 3. 5 km s− 1. The wide range of shock features and their freshness make Kamil a natural laboratory for studying impact cratering and shock deformation processes in small impact structures...|$|R
