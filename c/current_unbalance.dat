This paper proposes an improved vector space decomposition current control scheme for dual three-phase permanent magnet (PM) synchronous motors having two sets of three-phase windings spatially shifted by 30 ° electrical degrees. A proportional-integral (PI) and resonant (second) controller is developed for eliminating the <b>current</b> <b>unbalance</b> in αβ subplane, which is effective irrespective {{of the degree of}} <b>current</b> <b>unbalance,</b> while PI plus multifrequency resonant (second and sixth) control is employed to eliminate the <b>current</b> <b>unbalance,</b> fifth and seventh current harmonics in z 1 z 2 subplane. Compared with existing methods only accounting for <b>current</b> <b>unbalance</b> in z 1 z 2 subplane, the proposed method has considered the current unbalances in both z 1 z 2 and αβ subplanes and can eliminate them simultaneously at the steady-state of operation. Consequently, the full compensation of <b>current</b> <b>unbalance</b> can be achieved, by which both the <b>current</b> <b>unbalance</b> between two sets and <b>current</b> <b>unbalance</b> between phase windings in each set are eliminated. Meanwhile, the fifth and seventh current harmonics caused by nonsinusoidal back electromotive force and inverter nonlinearity can also be fully compensated. The effectiveness of proposed method is verified by a set of comparative experiments on a prototype dual three-phase PM machine system. It shows that fully balanced currents without the fifth and seventh current harmonics at the steady state of operation can be achieved...|$|E

40|$|Part 11 : Integration of Power Electronics Systems with ICT - IInternational audienceAn UPQC (Unified Power Quality Conditioner) is an {{equipment}} composed by two active conditioners {{operating in a}} combined way. One of the active conditioners is connected in series with the electrical power system, allowing the compensation of problems in the system voltages. The other active conditioner {{is connected in parallel}} with the electrical system, and allows the compensation of <b>current</b> harmonics, <b>current</b> <b>unbalances</b> and power factor. In three-phase four-wire systems the parallel connected active conditioner also compensates the zero sequence current components, eliminating the neutral wire current. The UPQC operates in an automatic way, adjusting itself dynamically to the variations of the load and of the electrical system, keeping high levels of power quality in the voltages delivered to the load. At the same time, it only consumes from the electrical system the active power necessary to the load operation, in a balanced way through the three phases, and with sinusoidal currents. The compensation capabilities of the UPQC can be very useful to ensure high levels of power quality in the future Smart Grids, which are not characterized as a single technology or device, but rather as a vision of a distributed electrical system, supported by reference technologies, as Power Electronics Devices, Renewable Energy Resources, Energy Storage Systems (ESS), Advanced Metering Infrastructures (AMI), and Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) ...|$|R
