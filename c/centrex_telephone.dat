50|$|On Sunday, June 21, 1970 a new <b>Centrex</b> <b>telephone</b> {{system was}} {{installed}} for advertisers and subscribers {{to use when}} calling. This allowed direct dialing without requiring the person to first contact the switchboard operator.|$|E
50|$|A single wardialing call {{would involve}} calling an unknown number, {{and waiting for}} one or two rings, since {{answering}} computers usually pick up on the first ring. If the phone rings twice, the modem hangs up and tries the next number. If a modem or fax machine answers, the wardialer program makes a note of the number. If a human or answering machine answers, the wardialer program hangs up. Depending on the time of day, wardialing 10,000 numbers in a given area code might annoy dozens or hundreds of people, some who attempt and fail to answer a phone in two rings, and some who succeed, only to hear the wardialing modem's carrier tone and hang up. The repeated incoming calls are especially annoying to businesses that have many consecutively numbered lines in the exchange, such as used with a <b>Centrex</b> <b>telephone</b> system.|$|E
50|$|<b>Centrex</b> <b>telephones</b> added a hook-flash {{button in}} the 1960s after some users {{incorrectly}} attempted the attendant-recall function.|$|R
