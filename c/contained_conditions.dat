A number of approaches have been developed in the literature for construction of the robotic hand-eye coordination. However, several important features within infant developmental procedure have not been introduced into such approaches. This paper proposes a new method for robotic hand-eye coordination by imitating the developmental progress of human infants. The work employs a brain-like neural network system inspired by infant brain structure to learn hand-eye coordination, and adopts a developmental mechanism from psychology to drive the robot. The entire learning procedure is driven by developmental constraint: The robot starts to act under fully constrained conditions, when the robot learning system becomes stable, a new constraint is assigned to the robot. After that, the robot needs to act with this new condition again. When all the <b>contained</b> <b>conditions</b> have been overcome, the robot is able to obtain hand-eye coordination ability. The work is supported by experimental evaluation, which shows that the new approach is able to drive the robot to learn autonomously, and make the robot also exhibit developmental progress similar to human infants. ? 2013 Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg...|$|E

40|$|Transformation of the {{chloroplast}} genome is {{a technique}} that allows {{for the production of}} recombinant proteins in plants. Chloroplast transformation allows the very high expression of a transgene while limiting the gene flow to other species. In addition, multiple genes can be transferred in one transformation event and no gene silencing as been shown so far. Despite these advantages, little work has been directed at assessing the commercial feasibility of using the chloroplast as a means of expressing high-value proteins. In this thesis, a new expression system was developed to allow the very high expression of transgenes in the chloroplast under <b>contained</b> <b>conditions.</b> Tobacco plants were transformed with a tobacco chloroplast vector expressing green fluorescent protein. Cell suspensions were induced from these leaves. Using a bioreactor, I was able to demonstrate that coupling temporary immersion with a hormonal shift triggered the rapid production of plant tissue whilst retaining a high level of expression of green fluorescent protein. Another aspect of this thesis was to assess the potential of several fusion tags to improve the solubility and purification of various target proteins in transformed tobacco chloroplasts. The main proteins studied were a mannanase from coffee, which is involved in the detergent, pulp and, more recently, the bioethanol industry, as well as alpha defensin 1 peptide, which has potential therapeutic value in the treatment of several diseases such as HIV and Herpes. N- and C-terminal constructions were created with oleosin, dehydrin, fibrillin, maltose-binding protein and glutathione-S-transferase as tags. Constructs were first evaluated in Escherichia coli before being integrated into the tobacco plastome. Apart from oleo sin, all fusion proteins were successfully expressed in transplastomic tobacco. My work has identified dehydrin, GST and MBP as promising affinity-tags to be used in chloroplast transformation experiments. Finally, I describe the development of experimental tools and procedures for the transformation of the chloroplast genome of coffee, {{which is one of the}} world's major cash crops.

40|$|Active disease {{resistance}} in plants relies on highly sensitive and specific surveillance systems that enable recognition and restriction {{of growth of}} invading pathogens. Numerous resistance (R) genes have been characterized from various plant species that provide typical gene-for-gene-based resistance {{to a variety of}} different pathogens that carry the matching avirulence (Avr) genes. Because an Avr gene product is not beneficial for the pathogen {{in the presence of the}} matching R gene, the primary function of Avr gene products is expected to be associated with virulence rather than with avirulence (Chapter 1). Indeed, evidence is accumulating that Avr genes encode effector proteins that condition establishment of a compatible interaction between a pathogen and a susceptible host, either by interacting with host-encoded virulence targets to suppress (basal) defence responses or by interfering with activities of pathogenesis-related (PR) proteins or other induced defence responses. Thus, losing an avirulence determinant, in order to overcome R gene-mediated resistance, might carry a virulence penalty for the pathogen. On the introgressed region in tomato plants carrying the Cf- 4 locus (MM-Cf 4 plants), five homologues of Cladosporium fulvum resistance gene Cf- 9 (Hcr 9 - 4 s) are present. In Chapter 2, we demonstrated that homologue Hcr 9 - 4 E confers a similar level of resistance to C. fulvum as homologue Hcr 9 - 4 D, which represents the Cf- 4 gene, through recognition of a novel avirulence determinant, designated AVR 4 E. The Avr 4 E gene encodes a cysteine-rich protein of 121 amino acids that is secreted into the apoplastic space of tomato as a mature protein of 101 amino acids (Chapter 2). The genomic Avr 4 E sequence of C. fulvum race 5 confers avirulence (after transformation) to strains of C. fulvum that are normally virulent on plants carrying Hcr 9 - 4 E, indicating that AVR 4 E is a genuine a race-specific avirulence determinant. Strains of C. fulvum evade Hcr 9 - 4 E- mediated resistance either by lack of Avr 4 E gene expression or by production of a stable AVR 4 E mutant protein that is elicitor-inactive and carries two amino acid substitutions, Phe 62 Leu and Met 73 Thr. Moreover, we demonstrated by site-directed mutagenesis that the single amino acid substitution Phe 62 Leu in AVR 4 E is sufficient to evade Hcr 9 - 4 E- mediated resistance (Chapter 2). Strains of C. fulvum that produce race-specific elicitor AVR 4 induce a hypersensitive response (HR) leading to resistance in tomato plants carrying the Cf- 4 resistance gene. In Chapter 3, the mechanism of AVR 4 perception by Cf- 4 plants is examined by performing binding studies with 125 I-AVR 4 on microsomal membranes fractions (MFs) of MM-Cf 0 (susceptible) and MM-Cf 4 (resistant) tomato plants and non-host plant species. We identified an AVR 4 -high affinity-binding site (HABS) (K D = 0. 05 nM) that exhibited all the characteristics expected for ligand-receptor interactions, such as saturability, reversibility and specificity. Surprisingly, the AVR 4 -HABS present in MFs appeared to originate from fungi present on partially infected tomato plants rather than from the tomato plant itself. This fungus-derived, AVR 4 -specific HABS is heat- and proteinase K-resistant, suggesting that it might be a non- proteinaceous component. Affinity cross-linking demonstrated that AVR 4 specifically binds to a component of about 75 kDa of fungal origin, a phenomenon that is possibly related to the intrinsic function of AVR 4 for C. fulvum. As no AVR 4 -specific HABS could be detected in MFs of tomato plants that were grown under <b>contained</b> <b>conditions,</b> the mechanism of perception of AVR 4 by MM-Cf 4 plants appears to be different from that found for several other fungus-derived peptides and elicitors, including AVR 9, for which a HABS has been identified in MFs of several plant species. The AVR 4 protein of C. fulvum contains 8 cysteine residues, all of which are involved in disulfide bonds. Assignment of the disulfide bond pattern of AVR 4 was partly achieved by a biological analysis using potato virus-X (PVX) -mediated expression of AVR 4 disulfide bond mutants in plants carrying Cf- 4, and subsequently confirmed and completed by partial chemical reduction of AVR 4, followed by mass mapping (Chapter 4). The four disulfide bonds present in AVR 4 were identified as Cys 11 -Cys 41, Cys 21 -Cys 27, Cys 35 -Cys 80 and Cys 57 -Cys 72. The disulfide bond pattern and the spacing of the cysteine residues were subsequently used to carry out a motif-based search, which revealed that AVR 4 contains a chitin-binding domain that is also present in chitin-binding proteins of invertebrates (inv ChBD). Three disulfide bonds in AVR 4 are conserved amongst members of the inv ChBD family and these bonds are required for conformational stability of AVR 4 (Chapter 4). In natural strains of C. fulvum disruption of two of these three conserved disulfide bonds, i. e. between Cys 11 -Cys 41 and Cys 35 -Cys 80, results in lack of AVR 4 recognition by Cf- 4 plants. However, all four disulfide bond mutants of AVR 4 retained the ability to bind to chitin in vitro. Moreover, when bound to chitin, these disulfide bond mutants of AVR 4 are less sensitive to proteolytic breakdown. Thus, while evasion of Cf- 4 - mediated resistance by C. fulvum appears to result from instability and protease sensitivity of AVR 4 mutant proteins present in the apoplast of tomato, AVR 4 mutants retained their putative intrinsic role in protecting the cell wall of C. fulvum against plant chitinases. AVR 4 does not require binding to chitin to induce Cf- 4 - mediated plant defence responses. In Chapter 5, we analyzed whether domains responsible for necrosis-inducing activity (NIA) and chitin-binding ability within AVR 4 can be distinguished. Therefore, we performed a peptide scan (PEPSCAN) analysis using polyclonal antibodies raised against native AVR 4 to identify antigenic domains containing putatively solvent-exposed residues that might condition NIA of AVR 4. This antibody-affinity analysis identified one major (Cys 41 -Cys 57) and two minor antigenic domains in AVR 4 (Ile 17 -Asn 31 and Gln 62 -Asn 76). Selective alanine substitutions were performed on all, except for Cys, Pro and Gly, residues present in the major antigenic domain of AVR 4, as this domain exhibits the highest affinity for AVR 4 polyclonal antibodies. Moreover, to determine which residues in AVR 4 are important for chitin binding, all aromatic residues and two additional residues present in conserved domains of the anticipated chitin-binding domain(s) were individually substituted by alanine. We showed that replacement of single amino acids in the major antigenic domain of AVR 4 does not affect its NIA (Chapter 5). Substitution of aromatic residues Tyr 38 and Trp 63 by Ala, however, reduced the NIA of AVR 4. However, these AVR 4 mutant proteins appeared to be unstable, suggesting that Tyr 38 and Trp 63 contribute to conformational stability rather than to NIA of AVR 4. In this study, no individual amino acid residues could be identified that are essential for binding of AVR 4 to chitin, suggesting that multiple rather than single amino acid residues contribute to chitin-binding ability. It would be beneficial for C. fulvum to evade induction of plant defense responses by modifying the Avr gene products in such way that their avirulence but not their virulence functions are lost (Chapter 6). For most single AVRs, however, no pronounced role in virulence of C. fulvum could be assigned, possibly due to the fact that other proteins compensated for their intrinsic functions, suggesting that AVRs are redundant...|$|E
