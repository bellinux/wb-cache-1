40|$|This study {{evaluated}} the ecotoxicity of five dyes to freshwater organisms {{before and during}} their photo-Fenton degradation. EC 50 (48 h) of the five tested dyes ranged from of 6. 9 to > 1000 mg L- 1 for Daphnia similis. in the chronic tests IC 50 (72 h) varied from 65 to > 100 mg L- 1 for Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata and IC 50 (8 days) from 0. 5 to 410 mg L- 1 for Ceriodaphnia dubia. Toxicity tests revealed that although the applied treatment was effective for decolorization of the dye, the partial mineralization {{may be responsible for}} the presence of degradation products which can be either more toxic than the original dye, as is the case of Vat Green 3 and Reactive Black 5, lead to initially toxic products which may be further degraded to non toxic products (acid Orange 7 and Food Red 17), or generate non toxic products {{as in the case of}} <b>Food</b> <b>Yellow</b> <b>3.</b> the results highlighted the importance of assessing both acute and chronic toxicity tests of treated sample before effluent discharge.

40|$|The at-line {{coupling}} of {{capillary electrophoresis}} (CE) and surface-enhanced resonance Raman spectroscopy (SERRS) was optimized for the separation and subsequent spectroscopic identification of charged analytes (dye compounds). Raman spectra were recorded following deposition of the electropherogram onto a moving substrate. To this end a new interface was developed using {{a stainless steel}} needle as a (grounded) cathode. The outlet end of the CE capillary was inserted into this metal needle; CE buffer touching the needle tip served as the electrical connection for the CE separation. A translation table was used to move the TLC plate at a constant speed during the deposition. The distance between {{the tip of the}} fused silica column and the TLC plate was kept as small as possible in order to establish a constant bridge-flow, while avoiding direct contact. The dyes Basic Red 9 (BR 9), Acid Orange 7 (AO 7) and <b>Food</b> <b>Yellow</b> <b>3</b> (FY 3) were used as test compounds. After CE separation in a 20 mM borate buffer at pH 10, after deposition, concentrated silver colloid was added to each analyte spot, followed by irradiation with 514. 5 nm light from an argon ion laser to record the SERRS signal using a Raman microscope. Different types of silver colloids were tested: Lee-Meisel type (citrate), borate, and gold-coated silver. BR 9 (positively charged) gave much more intense SERRS spectra than the two negatively charged dyes. For BR 9 and AO 7 the citrate-coated Lee-Meisel colloid yielded the most intense SERRS spectra. The CE-SERRS system was used to separate and detect the negatively charged dyes. Silver colloid and nitric acid (to improve adsorption) were added post-deposition. Even though their chemical structures are very similar, AO 7 and FY 3 could be readily distinguished based on their SERRS spectra. The limits of detection (S/N= 3) of the CE-SERRS system ranged from 6. 7 × 1...|$|R
40|$|The {{main goal}} of {{presented}} thesis is {{to study the}} influence of organic dyes structure on its degradation in diaphragm discharge in liquids. Diaphragm discharge {{is a kind of}} non-thermal plasma that can be generated in liquids by the application of high voltage. In plasma channels (so-called streamers), many physical and chemical processes are formed. High electrical field, shock waves and last but not least emission of electromagnetic waves in the range of visible and ultra-violet radiation appear among physical processes. The most important chemical process is generation of active species. These species initiate chemical reactions and could attack molecules of organic compounds contained in water solution. The reason why organic dyes were chosen in this study is its visible destruction, because it is related to its decolouration. Further, UV-VIS spectroscopy for the determination of concentration during the experiment can be used. Organic dyes are good models of organic substance often contained in waste water and for which removal classical biological, chemical and physical methods aren’t sufficient. Selected dyes were mostly from the group of azo-dyes: Acid Red 14, Acid Red 18, Acid Yellow 23, Direct Blue 53, Direct Red 79, Direct Red 80, Direct <b>Yellow</b> 29, <b>Food</b> <b>Yellow</b> <b>3</b> and further, Acid Blue 74 (indigotic dye) and Direct Blue 106 (oxazine dye). Experiments were carried out in a special batch discharge reactor with the anode and the cathode spaces divided by a non-conductive barrier, where the diaphragm with a pin-hole was placed. Measurement showed different removal in the anode and cathode space. We have supposed it was caused by different streamers features and energetic conditions. Dyes were decomposed with higher efficiency in the anode space where the final concentration reached 40 % of the initial concentration while it remained about 90 % in the cathode space. In this thesis the influence of dyes structure on the dye decomposition by electrical discharge was investigated. Dyes consisted of small molecules and dyes with many substitutes bounded on aromatic ring were decomposed more easily than dyes consisted of big molecules. The shift of characteristic wavelength on both directions (to shorter as well as longer wavelength) was observed during the experiments especially when the Direct dyes were decomposed. This phenomenon was probably due to the formation of intermediate product, which have different characteristic wavelength than the primary compound. In general, colourfulness is given by long conjugated systems of double bonds with substitutes bounded on an aromatic ring. Each change in the molecule structure provides the colour change and this could be the possible reason of the shift of characteristic wavelength. The other task was the comparison of degradation process efficiency by the mean of electrolysis and diaphragm discharge. Results showed that electrolysis (30 W) was more convenient for degradation of dyes consisted of small molecules while diaphragm discharge (130170 W) suited for complex molecules. For degradation of small molecules, oxidation on the anode assumed to be the most effective process that is initiated by electrolysis. For degradation of big molecules, attack of active species produced by the discharge is necessary...|$|R
