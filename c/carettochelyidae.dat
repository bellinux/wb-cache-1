5|$|There are {{fourteen}} extant {{families of}} the order Testudines, an order of reptile commonly known as turtles, tortoises and terrapins. The testudines {{are some of the}} most ancient reptiles alive, with only the tuataras considered more primitive. There are approximately 300 extant species and 97 genera of testudines, split into two suborders: the Cryptodirans and the Pleurodirans. The distinction between these two suborders is based on the mode in which they cover their head and neck. The Pleurodirans, also called the side-necked turtles, have long necks, and fold them sideways to align them with the shell. The Pelomedusidae and Chelidae are the only extant families of pleurodires. The Cryptodirans pull their neck straight back to conceal their head within the shell. The <b>Carettochelyidae,</b> Cheloniidae, Chelydridae, Dermatemydidae, Dermochelyidae, Emydidae, Kinosternidae, Testudinidae and Trionychidae are all cryptodires, although the ability to retract the head has been lost in the sea turtles (Cheloniidae and Dermochelyidae). A third order, the Paracryptodirans, are extinct.|$|E
50|$|Carettochelys insculpta is {{the only}} living member of the genus Carettochelys, the {{subfamily}} Carettochelyinae and the family <b>Carettochelyidae,</b> though several extinct carettochelyid species have been described from around the world. Some literature claims two subspecies, but a recent paper rejects this.|$|E
40|$|Fossil turtles {{collected}} from the Sinda Beds of eastern Zaire contain three families. They are Erymnochelys sp. of family Pelomedusidae, gen. et sp. Indet. of family <b>Carettochelyidae,</b> and gen. et sp. indet of family Trionychidae. Among them is the first known occurrence from Africa of carettochelyid, the pig-nosed turtle, Erymnochelys, the bigheaded side necked turtle, while once flourished in African during Tertiary, is restricted to Madagascar, today. All of these are presumed to have had aquatic habitat in rivers and lakes...|$|E
40|$|Turtles of {{the total}} clade Pan-Carettochelys have a {{relatively}} poor fossil record that extends from the Early Cretaceous. The clade is only found in Asia during the Cretaceous, but spreads to Europe and North America during the Eocene. Neogene finds are restricted to Europe, Africa and Australia, whereas the only surviving species, Carettochelys insculpta, lives in New Guinea and the Northern Territories of Australia. The ecology of fossil pan-carettochelyids appears {{similar to that of}} the extant C. insculpta, although more primitive representatives were likely less adapted to brackish water. Current phylogenies only recognize three internested clades: Pan-Carettochelys, <b>Carettochelyidae</b> and Carettochelyinae. A taxonomic review of the group concludes that of 25 named taxa, 13 are nomina valida, 7 are nomina invalida, 3 are nomina dubia, and 2 are nomina nuda...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} examine the {{evolution}} of the phalangeal formula in a diverse clade of turtles, including hyperphalangy as a rare condition in this group, we studied 210 specimens representing all extant genera of Trionychidae and their sister taxon, <b>Carettochelyidae.</b> Both groups consist of highly aquatic species with elongated autopods that are either paddle-like (Trionychidae) or transformed to flippers (<b>Carettochelyidae).</b> Phalangeal formulae were obtained mostly by radiographs of alcohol-preserved or dry specimens, as well as by direct counts from skeletons. All trionychids and Carettochelys are pentadactylous, but their phalangeal formulae differ. Carettochelys exhibits the turtle-plesiomorphic state (manus and pes: 2 - 3 - 3 - 3 - 3), with no variation in adults. Trionychids exhibit intraspecific variation, ranging from 2 - 3 - 3 - 3 - 2 to 2 - 3 - 3 - 6 - 5 for the manus, and from 2 - 3 - 3 - 3 - 2 to 2 - 3 - 3 - 5 - 3 for the pes. The extant Carettochelys as well as the Middle Eocene Allaeochelys crassesculpta are characterized by an elongation of phalanges, whereas trionychids consistently have shorter phalanges. All trionychid genera exhibit some degree of hyperphalangy in digits IV and V, in both the manus and pes. Phalanges of the clawed digits Iâ€“III are very robust compared to phalanges of the non-clawed digits IV and V. The latter contribute significantly to the enlargement of the paddle by their additional phalanges. We hypothesize that this phalangeal pattern is coupled with prolongation of growth processes in the non-clawed digits. The differences in autopod morphology between carettochelyids and trionychids reflect different locomotor patterns related to different natural histories (elongated flippers for high-speed escape in the mainly herbivorous Carettochelys; broad paddles for rapid turns during hunting in the mainly carnivorous trionychids). The autopod of Pelodiscus sinensis is proposed as an experimental model to examine the developmental basis of adult autopod variation...|$|E
40|$|Fossil carettochelyine turtles {{are well}} known from the Paleogene of Europe (Allaeochelys), North America and Asia (Anosteira); however, the {{previously}} known Neogene fossil record is highly fragmentary and was therefore unsuitable for taxonomic analysis. In this work, we present a new carettochelyine taxon, Allaeochelys libyca, from the Middle Miocene (Langhian) of Gebel Zelten (Libya) based on an incomplete skull and disarticulated postcranial elements. The new taxon is diagnosed relative to the extant Carettochelys insculpta based on {{the placement of the}} foramen posterius canalis carotici interni close to the fenestra postotica, the horizontal orientation of the tubercula basioccipitalis, the substantial contribution of the opisthotic {{to the base of the}} tubercula basioccipitalis, the presence of a triangular pterygoid fossa, the arrangement of the mandibular condyles along a plane and the presence of an extremely well-developed fossa at the base of the processus mandibularis. A phylogenetic analysis of pancarettochelyids confirms the monophyly of <b>Carettochelyidae</b> and Carettochelyinae but resulted in a paraphyletic taxon, Allaeochelys. For the sake of nomenclatural stability, we provisionally retain the genus Allaeochelys as paraphyletic relative to the extant Carettochelys insculpta...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{identify}} shape patterns of the shoulder girdle in relation to different functional and environmental behaviours in turtles. The Procrustes method was used to compare the shoulder girdles (scapula and coracoid) of 88 adult extant turtles. The results indicate that four shape patterns can be distinguished. The shoulder girdles of (1) terrestrial (Testudinidae), (2) highly aquatic freshwater (Trionychidae, <b>Carettochelyidae)</b> and (3) marine turtles (Cheloniidae, Dermochelyidae) correspond to three specialized morphological patterns, whereas the shoulder girdle of (4) semi-aquatic freshwater turtles (Bataguridae, Chelidae, Chelydridae, Emydidae, Kinosternidae, Pelomedusidae, Platysternidae, Podocnemididae) is more generalized. In terrestrial turtles, the long scapular prong and the short coracoid are associated with a domed shell and a mode of locomotion in which walking is predominant. By contrast, highly aquatic freshwater turtles share traits with marine turtles. In both, the short scapular prong and the long coracoid are associated with a flat shell, and swimming locomotion. The enlarged attachment sites of the biceps, coracobrachialis magnus, and supracoracoideus also give these strong swimmers a mechanical advantage during adduction and retraction of the arm. Increasing size leads to allometrical shape changes that emphasize mechanical efficiency both in terrestrial and in aquatic turtles...|$|E
