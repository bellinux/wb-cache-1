40|$|ABSTRACT: In this paper, on-line {{training}} of neural networks is investigated {{in the context}} of <b>computer-assisted</b> colonoscopic <b>diagnosis.</b> A memory-based adaptation of the learning rate for the on-line Backpropagation is proposed and used to seed an on-line evolution process that applies a Differential Evolution Strategy to (re-) adapt the neural network to modified environmental conditions.

The proposed hybrid strategy is compared with other standard training methods that have traditionally been used for training neural networks off-line.

40|$|Abstract—In <b>computer-assisted</b> medical <b>diagnosis</b> it {{is often}} hard or even {{impossible}} to obtain a valid set of rules for disease classification by classical knowledge engineering methods. Alternatively, machine learning methods are applied to obtain classifiers from sets of data pre-classified by medical experts. Typically in a medical context, available data sets are imbalanced {{with respect to the}} possible classifications. E. g., in dermatology, there are only few data representing cases of malign melanoma vs. many cases representing benign nevi. Furthermore, there are different missclassification costs assigned to different classes. E. g., it is much more critical (i. e. costly) to erroneously classify a malign melanoma as benign than the other way around. We propose a universally applicable optimization framework that successfully corrects the error-based inductive bias of classifier learning methods on image data. The framework integrates several techniques of common optimization techniques, such as modifying the optimization procedure for inducer-specific parameters, modifying input data by an arcing algorithm, combining classifiers of several classifier learning methods (kNN, SVM and C 4. 5) with different settings according to locally-adaptive, cost-sensitive voting schemes. The framework is designed to make the learning process cost-sensitive and enforcing more balanced missclassification costs between classes.

Clinically, incontinence is a diagnosis with high clinical prevalence and morbidity rate. The search for a method to identify risk patients and to control the success of operations is still a challenging task. The conjunction of magnetic resonance (MR) and 3 D ultrasound (US) image data sets could lead to a new clinical visual representation of the morphology as we show with corresponding data sets of the female anal canal with this paper. Methods We present a feasibility study for a non-rigid registration technique based on a biomechanical model for MR and US image data sets of the female anal canal as a base for a new innovative clinical visual representation. Results It is shown in this case study that the internal and external sphincter region could be registered elastically and the registration partially corrects the compression induced by the ultrasound transducer, so the MR data set showing the native anatomy is used as a frame for the US data set showing the same region with higher resolution but distorted by the transducer Conclusion The morphology is of special interest in the assessment of anal incontinence and the non-rigid registration of normal clinical MR and US image data sets is a new field of the adaptation of this method incorporating the advantages of both technologies. </p...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Diabetic {{retinopathy}} (DR) {{is one of}} {{the most}} serious and most frequent eye diseases in the world and the most common cause of blindness in adults between 20 and 60 years of age. Following 15 years of diabetes, about 2 % of the diabetic patients are blind and 10 % suffer from vision impairment due to DR complications. This paper addresses the automatic detection of microaneurysms (MA) in color fundus images, which plays a key role in <b>computer-assisted</b> early <b>diagnosis</b> of diabetic retinopathy. Materials and Methods: The algorithm can be divided into three main steps. The purpose of the first step or pre-processing is background normalization and contrast enhancement of the images. The second step aims to detect candidates, i. e., all patterns possibly corresponding to MA, which is achieved using a local radon transform, Then, features are extracted, which are used in the last step to automatically classify the candidates into real MA or other objects using the SVM method. A database of 100 annotated images was used to test the algorithm. The algorithm was compared to manually obtained gradings of these images. Results: The sensitivity of diagnosis for DR was 100 %, with specificity of 90 % and the sensitivity of precise MA localization was 97 %, at an average number of 5 false positives per image. Discussion and Conclusion: Sensitivity and specificity of this algorithm make it one of the best methods in this field.

Endoscopically it can be classified as nonerosive {{when there is no}} mucosal erosive lesion on endoscopy. The presence of endoscopic minimal lesions is included in the Los Angeles classification for reflux disease. Virtual chromoendoscopy Fuji Intelligent Color Enhancement (FICE) is an endoscopic technique that enhances detection of small lesions of the digestive tract. Objective- To evaluate whether the use of FICE improves the diagnosis of minimal lesions on endoscopy, and to assess the association of symptoms with minimal lesions in patients with nonerosive reflux disease. Methods – One hundred fifty-five patients were enrolled, 62 with typical reflux symptoms and 93 without esophageal symptoms. The patients had normal esophageal endoscopy or minimal lesions. Each patient was examined initially by conventional video endoscopy and then using FICE. Results- Among 155 patients, 113 had a normal conventional endoscopy and 42 had minimal lesions. Sixty-two patients had typical reflux symptoms, and 93 other symptoms unrelated to reflux. In 104 patients, the esophageal mucosa was normal for both conventional endoscopy and FICE, in 42 patients both techniques showed minimal lesions, in 9 patients conventional endoscopy was normal and minimal lesions were shown by FICE. The height and circumference of minimal lesions were greater using FICE than that measured by conventional endoscopy. There was a significant association of the presence of minimal lesions with male gender, but not with alcoholism, smoking, anti-inflammatory drugs and age. The diagnosis of minimal lesions was observer-dependent, both in conventional endoscopy as using FICE. Conclusions-The use of FICE improves the diagnosis of minimal lesions as compared to conventional videoendoscopy, although this diagnosis remains observer-dependent. There was no association between the presences of minimal lesions with reflux symptoms. HEADINGS- Gastroesophageal reflux. Esophagitis, peptic.

40|$|Medical imaging of {{the spine}} and pelvis is usually {{performed}} by conventional and digital radiography, computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. Radiographic imaging provides two-dimensional (2 D) projection images, while CT and MR imaging provide a series of 2 D cross-sections that are stacked into three-dimensional (3 D) images. Although radiographic imaging is still widely used due to relatively low costs and wide area of application, a paradigm shift {{to the use of}} cross-sectional imaging has occurred due to its sensitivity, specificity, availability and trends in medical practice. In the case of spine and pelvis, 3 D imaging allows the measurement of morphological properties valuable for ascertaining diagnosis, determining prognosis, and guiding treatment decisions. The morphological properties {{of the spine}} and pelvis can be described by a number of parameters that represent anatomical distances or angles. The spinal curvature is described by coronal vertebral inclination (CVI) and sagittal vertebral inclination (SVI), the rotation of a vertebra around its longitudinal axis is described by axial vertebral rotation (AVR), while the sagittal alignment of the pelvis is usually described by pelvic incidence (PI). Quantification of spinal curvature, vertebral rotation and sagittal pelvic alignment is important for {{a better understanding of the}} progression of spinal and pelvic deformities. However, the human capability to quantitatively evaluate morphological parameters from medical images is limited due to our non-systematic search patterns, similar characteristics of normal and pathological conditions, and biological variability of human anatomy. Technical limitations, such as image noise, distinctive characteristics of imaging techniques and variable positioning of the patient during image acquisition, also represent a major source of variability and introduce measurement errors. This thesis concentrates on the evaluation of spinal and pelvic parameters from 3 D medical images. Spinal curvature, vertebral rotation and sagittal pelvic alignment were quantitatively evaluated by existing and novel manual and computerized measurement methods, and the results were analyzed in terms of the variability introduced by methods and observers. Although manual measurements are still widely used, the most established measurement of a specific parameter is not necessarily the best choice in terms of repeatability and reliability. Computerized measurements, which apply image processing and analysis techniques, are considerably faster and less observer-dependent than manual measurements, but currently developed to a point that still requires observer interaction, usually in the form of initialization. The reproducibility and reliability are higher when parameters are evaluated from 3 D than 2 D images, but 3 D images are more demanding in terms of availability, manipulation and interpretation. However, 3 D images help clinicians in making more accurate diagnosis and planning more effective treatment strategies for spinal and pelvic deformities, while methods for <b>computer-assisted</b> and computerized <b>diagnosis</b> are constantly being developed to aid in the interpretation of the increasing amount of medical image information. Quantitative evaluation of spinal and pelvic parameters from 3 D images is a current and active topic in orthopedics and medical imaging that is far from being entirely explored, therefore opportunities for further research still exist and represent challenging tasks...|$|R

CAD analysis {{in the field of}} magnetic resonance (MR) mammography, MR volumetry, Digital X-ray radiogrammetry, and the automatic assessment of the breast tissue composition in X-ray mammography are highlighted. The results show that the absolute volumes of the whole breast (“breast volume”) and of the fibroglandular tissue (“fibroglandular tissue volume”), estimated by CAD, provide reproducible calculations in serial mammograms, however, with limitations if different X-ray units are used. Due to its detailed radiogeometric analysis of hand radiographs, Digital X-ray radiogrammetry is able to differentiate between two osteoporosis entities – amputation-induced osteoporosis and senile demineralization. The computer-aided MR volumetry of the pituitary gland provides accurate and reproducible findings also in such small volumes. After computer-assisted analysis of dynamic signal intensity time curves in MR mammography the detection rate of carcinomas increases for less experienced observers; however, the specificity may decrease in the case of low expertise of the readers. A fully automatic CAD interpretation of MR mammographies can reliably characterize mass-like lesions and correctly classify them with a diagnostic accuracy of 93. 5 %; however, this CAD technique reveals limitations in assessing the response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy with a sensitivity of solely 52. 4 %. The diagnostic performance of CAD systems can be further optimized by implementing new parameters; one innovative parameter is the tumor flow residence time, which shows promising findings in differentiating between malignant and benign breast lesions in MR mammography by using a pharmacokinetic approach.
