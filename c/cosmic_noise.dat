40|$|<b>Cosmic</b> <b>noise</b> at 40  MHz is {{measured}} at Ny-Ålesund (79 ° N, 12 ° E) using a {{relative ionospheric opacity meter}} ("riometer"). A riometer is normally {{used to determine}} the degree to which <b>cosmic</b> <b>noise</b> is absorbed by the intervening ionosphere, giving an indication of ionisation of the atmosphere at altitudes lower than generally monitored by other instruments. The usual course is to determine a "quiet-day" variation, this representing the galactic noise signal itself in the absence of absorption; the current signal is then subtracted from this to arrive at absorption expressed in decibels (dB). By a variety of means and assumptions, it is thereafter possible to estimate electron density profiles in the very lowest reaches of the ionosphere. Here however, the entire signal, i. e. including the <b>cosmic</b> <b>noise</b> itself, will be examined and spectral characteristics identified. It will be seen that distinct spectral subranges are evident which can, in turn, be identified with non-Gaussian processes characterised by generalised Hurst exponents, α.

40|$|Temperature {{measurements}} {{from the}} ALOMAR Weber Na lidar together with <b>cosmic</b> radio <b>noise</b> absorption measurements from IRIS and particle measurements from NOAA 15, 16 and 17 {{are used to}} study effects of geomagnetic activity on the polar winter upper-mesospheric temperature. On 21 – 22 January 2005 we have 14 h of continuous temperature measurement with the Na lidar coinciding with strong geomagnetic activity in the declining phase {{of one of the}} hardest and most energetic Solar Proton Event (SPE) of solar cycle 23. According to measurements by the imaging riometer IRIS in northern Finland, the temperature measurements coincide with two periods of increased <b>cosmic</b> radio <b>noise</b> absorption. Particle measurements from the three satellites, NOAA 15, 16 and 17 that pass through and near our region of interest confirm that the absorption events are probably due to particle precipitation and not due to changes in e. g. the electron recombination coefficient. The measured temperature variation at 85 and 90 km is dominated by a 7. 6 -h wave with downward phase propagation and a vertical wavelength of approximately 10 km. Assuming that the wave is due to a lower altitude source independent of the particle precipitation, we do not find any temperature modification that seems {{to be related to the}} absorption events. The average temperature is larger than expected above 90 km based on MSIS and the monthly mean from falling spheres, which could be due to particle precipitation and Joule heating prior to our measurement period. There is also a possibility that the identified wave phenomenon is an effect of the geomagnetic activity itself. Earlier studies have reported of similar wavelike structures in wind observations made by the EISCAT VHF radar during SPEs, and found it conceivable that the wave could be excited by the effect of energetic particles precipitating into the mesosphere...|$|R

A considerable advantage of this method is that, unlike conventional techniques which rely on imaging faint optical emissions from the airglow layer at ∼ 87 km altitude, riometers remain operative under daylit, moonlit or cloudy conditions. This is particularly important for research into gravity wave forcing of mesospheric temperature at polar latitudes in summer when continuous 24 -hour daylight prevails. An example in which the same wave event is characterized in co-located airglow imager and imaging riometer shows good agreement between the two instruments. ...|$|R
