50|$|The gun fires {{the same}} 152 mm {{ammunition}} types as the 152 mm 2S19 self-propelled artillery system and, more recently, {{a new family}} of separate loading (for example projectile and charge) 152 mm has been introduced. The standard OF45 high-explosive projectile weighs 43.56 kilograms, has a maximum muzzle velocity of 823 meters per second and a maximum range of 24.7 km. The charges include OF72 (long range), OF58 (full charge) and OF73 (reduced charge). The OF45 projectile can be fitted with different rear ends, for example various types of screw-on boat tails, or the OF61 base bleed projectile which weighs 42.86 kilograms, has a maximum muzzle velocity of 828 m/s and a maximum range of 29 km. The OF23 <b>cargo</b> <b>projectile</b> weighs 42.8 kg, has a maximum range of 26 kilometers and contains 42 High-Explosive Anti-Tank (HEAT) bomblets, each of which can penetrate 100 millimeters of conventional steel armour. Other types of projectile include the HS30 jamming round and the Russian 152 mm Krasnopol laser-guided projectile, which is covered in the entry for the 2S19 self-propelled artillery system. A 155 mm version of this system has been developed {{but as far as}} it is known this has not been exported. China has developed a new 155 mm/52 calibre SP artillery system called the PLZ52. This has a turret very similar to the 2S19. In addition to these new 152 mm projectiles the 2A65 can fire all standard types of 152 mm ammunition fired by the older Russian D-20 towed gun-howitzer and the 2S3 self-propelled gun-howitzer.|$|E

50|$|The M795 is a 155mm high {{fragmentation}} steel (HF1) body projectile {{filled with}} 23.8 lb of TNT and weighing approximately 103 lb. The high fragmentation steel body is encircled by a gilding metal rotating band making it compatible with 3W through 8S (M3A1 through M203A1) zone propelling charges across all current 155mm howitzers. The projectile is packaged {{on a metal}} pallet with a shock attenuating lifting plug and flexible rotating band cover. The M795 projectile is ballistically similar to the M483A1 family of <b>cargo</b> <b>projectiles</b> and {{may be used as}} a registration round for the M483A1 family. The M795 projectile provides an increased effectiveness against major ground force threats at greater ranges for anti-personnel and anti-materiel targets when compared to the current M107 projectile.|$|R
