40|$|Experimental {{studies have}} {{demonstrated}} that the neurotrophin brain-derived neutrophic factor (BDNF) is required for the appropriate development of the central respiratory network, a neuronal complex in the brainstem of vital importance to sustaining life. The pontine Kölliker-Fuse nucleus (KFN) is a fundamental component of this circuitry with strong implications in the pre- and postnatal breathing control. This study provides detailed account for the cytoarchitecture, the physiology and the BDNF behaviour of the human KFN in perinatal age. We applied immunohistochemistry in formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded brainstem samples (from 45 fetuses and newborns died of both known and unknown causes), to analyze BDNF, gliosis and apoptosis patterns of manifestation. The KFN showed clear signs of developmental immaturity, prevalently associated to BDNF altered expression, in high percentages of sudden intrauterine unexplained death syndrome (SIUDS) and sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) victims. Our results indicate that BDNF pathway dysfunctions can derange the normal KFN development so preventing the breathing control in the sudden perinatal death.

40|$|International audiencePhox 2 b is {{a master}} {{regulator}} of visceral reflex circuits.

Phox 2 b(27 Ala/+) mice that bear a frequent CCHS-causing mutation do not respond to hypercapnia and die in the first hour after birth from central apnoea. They are therefore a reliable animal model for CCHS.

40|$|Rationale: <b>Central</b> <b>congenital</b> <b>hypoventilation</b> <b>syndrome</b> (CCHS) {{is a rare}} {{autosomal}} dominant syndrome present from birth, and characterized by depressed ventilation during sleep. Heterozygous mutations of the homeobox gene Phox 2 b were recently found in a very high proportion of patients. Objectives: To determine whether newborn mice with heterozygous targeted deletion of the transcription factor Phox 2 b would display sleep-disordered breathing. Methods: We measured breathing pattern using whole-body plethysmography in wild-type and mutant 5 -day-old mice, and we classified sleep–wake states using nuchal EMG and behavioral scores. Results: We found that sleep apnea total time was approximately six times longer (8. 9 � 12 vs. 1. 5 � 2. 2 seconds, p � 0. 0015), and ventilation during active sleep was 21 % lower (18. 4 � 5. 1 vs. 23. 3 � 5. 5 ml/g/second, p � 0. 006) in mutant than in wild-type pups. During wakefulness, apnea time and ventilation {{were not significantly different}} between mutant and wild-type pups. Mutant and wild-type pups showed highly similar sleep–wake states.

40|$|AbstractThe {{functional}} role of retrotrapezoid nucleus (RTN) neurons {{as the central}} chemoreceptors and the potential implications of Phox 2 b expressed in these neurons will be discussed. RTN resides at the ventral medullary surface. RTN lesions reduce central respiratory chemoreception (CRC). RTN neurons are glutamatergic propriobulbar interneurons that selectively innervate the ventral respiratory column and other medullary regions essential to breathing. Their response to CO 2 is presumably intrinsic. RTN neurons uniformly express Phox 2 b, a transcription factor whose mutation in man causes a loss of CRC and central sleep apnea. RTN neurons are activated by stimulation of the carotid bodies, restrained by inhibitory inputs from the central respiratory pattern generator and from lung afferents and their response to CO 2 is sensitized by serotonin and by peptides released by serotonin neurons. The properties of RTN neurons {{are consistent with those}} expected from specialized central respiratory chemoreceptors. These data also suggest that respiratory reflexes operate in part by regulating the activity of central chemoreceptors. RTN neurons and the neurons that relay carotid body inputs to the respiratory centers express Phox 2 b. This peculiarity probably accounts for the loss of CRC associated with Phox 2 b mutations in man (<b>central</b> <b>congenital</b> <b>hypoventilation</b> <b>syndrome)</b> ...|$|R
40|$|Central sleep apnoea (CSA) - the {{temporary}} absence or diminution of ventilatory effort during sleep - {{is seen in}} a variety of forms including periodic breathing in infancy and healthy adults at altitude and Cheyne-Stokes respiration in heart failure. In most circumstances, the cyclic absence of effort is paradoxically a consequence of hypersensitive ventilatory chemoreflex responses to oppose changes in airflow, that is elevated loop gain, leading to overshoot/undershoot ventilatory oscillations. Considerable evidence illustrates overlap between CSA and obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA), including elevated loop gain in patients with OSA and the presence of pharyngeal narrowing during central apnoeas. Indeed, treatment of OSA, whether via continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), tracheostomy or oral appliances, can reveal CSA, an occurrence referred to as complex sleep apnoea. Factors influencing loop gain include increased chemosensitivity (increased controller gain), reduced damping of blood gas levels (increased plant gain) and increased lung to chemoreceptor circulatory delay. Sleep-wake transitions and pharyngeal dilator muscle responses effectively raise the controller gain and therefore also contribute to total loop gain and overall instability. In some circumstances, for example apnoea of infancy and <b>central</b> <b>congenital</b> <b>hypoventilation</b> <b>syndrome,</b> <b>central</b> apnoeas are the consequence of ventilatory depression and defective ventilatory responses, that is low loop gain. The efficacy of available treatments for CSA can be explained in terms of their effects on loop gain, for example CPAP improves lung volume (plant gain), stimulants reduce the alveolar-inspired PCO 2 difference and supplemental oxygen lowers chemosensitivity. Understanding the magnitude of loop gain and the mechanisms contributing to instability may facilitate personalized interventions for CSA...|$|R

40|$|International audienceFoetal {{breathing}} in mice results from prenatal {{activity of the}} two coupled hindbrain oscillators considered {{to be responsible for}} respiratory rhythm generation after birth: the pre-Bötzinger complex (preBötC) is active shortly before the onset of foetal breathing; the parafacial respiratory group (e-pF in embryo) starts activity one day earlier. Transcription factors have been identified that are essential to specify neural progenitors and lineages forming each of these oscillators during early development of the neural tube: Hoxa 1, Egr 2 (Krox 20), Phox 2 b, Lbx 1 and Atoh 1 for the e-pF; Dbx 1 and Evx 1 for the preBötC which eventually grow contralateral axons requiring expression of Robo 3. Inactivation of the genes encoding these factors leads to mis-specification of these neurons and distinct breathing abnormalities: apneic patterns and loss of central chemosensitivity for the e-pF (<b>central</b> <b>congenital</b> <b>hypoventilation</b> <b>syndrome,</b> CCHS, in humans), complete loss of breathing for the preBötC, right-left desynchronized {{breathing in}} Robo 3 mutants. Mutations affecting development in more rostral (pontine) respiratory territories change the shape of the inspiratory drive without affecting the rhythm. Other (primordial) embryonic oscillators start in the mouse three days before the e-pF, to generate low frequency (LF) rhythms that are probably required for activity-dependent development of neurones at embryonic stages; in the foetus, however, they are actively silenced to avoid detrimental interaction with the on-going respiratory rhythm. Altogether, these observations provide a strong support to the previously proposed hypothesis that the functional organization of the respiratory generator is specified at early stages of development and is dual in nature, comprising two serially non-homologous oscillators...|$|R
40|$|Certain motor {{activities}} [...] {{like walking}} or breathing [...] present the interesting property of proceeding either automatically or under voluntary control. In {{the case of}} breathing, brainstem structures located in the medulla {{are in charge of}} the automatic mode, whereas cortico-subcortical brain networks [...] including various frontal lobe areas [...] subtend the voluntary mode. We speculated that the involvement of cortical activity during voluntary breathing could impact both on the "resting state" pattern of cortical-subcortical connectivity, and on the recruitment of executive functions mediated by the frontal lobe. In order to test this prediction we explored a patient suffering from <b>central</b> <b>congenital</b> <b>hypoventilation</b> <b>syndrome</b> (CCHS), a very rare developmental condition secondary to brainstem dysfunction. Typically, CCHS patients demonstrate efficient cortically-controlled breathing while awake, but require mechanically-assisted ventilation during sleep to overcome the inability of brainstem structures to mediate automatic breathing. We used simultaneous EEG-fMRI recordings to compare patterns of brain activity between these two types of ventilation during wakefulness. As compared with spontaneous breathing (SB), mechanical ventilation (MV) restored the default mode network (DMN) associated with self-consciousness, mind-wandering, creativity and introspection in healthy subjects. SB on the other hand resulted in a specific increase of functional connectivity between brainstem and frontal lobe. Behaviorally, the patient was more efficient in cognitive tasks requiring executive control during MV than during SB, in agreement with her subjective reports in everyday life. Taken together our results provide insight into the cognitive and neural costs of spontaneous breathing in one CCHS patient, and suggest that MV during waking periods may free up frontal lobe resources, and make them available for cognitive recruitment. More generally, this study reveals how the active maintenance of cortical control over a continuous motor activity impacts on brain functioning and cognition...|$|R
40|$|Central chemoreception is the {{mechanism}} by which the brain regulates breathing in response to changes in tissue pH/CO 2. It is particularly important during sleep and its disruption {{has been associated with}} certain pathologies, including central sleep apnea and <b>central</b> <b>congenital</b> <b>hypoventilation</b> <b>syndrome.</b> A region of the brainstem called the retrotrapezoid nucleus (RTN) is thought to be an important site of central chemoreception. Recent evidence suggests that RTN chemoreception involves two mechanisms. The first appears to be H+-mediated activation of neurons via inhibition of pH-sensitive potassium channels. More recently, a second sensing mechanism has been identified; paracrine release of ATP in the RTN region that acts on P 2 receptors. It has been postulated that astrocytes in the region release ATP, as they have been found to release ATP in other brain regions in response to various stimuli. However, {{the mechanism}}s by which astrocytes sense CO 2 and/or pH are not known. Astrocytes in many brain regions are known to express Kir 4. 1 and/or Kir 4. 1 -Kir 5. 1 potassium channels, which are highly pH sensitive. In addition, Kir 4. 1 -Kir 5. 1 is expressed in the RTN. I hypothesize that RTN astrocyte sense CO 2 /H+ by inhibition of Kir 4. 1 -Kir 5. 1 channels, which results in membrane depolarization. I also hypothesize that ATP released via connexin hemichannels in response to CO 2 /H+ acts on P 2 -receptors on RTN neurons to increase neuronal action potential firing, and that this purinergic mechanism of chemoreception is restricted to the ventral surface, affecting primarily RTN neurons. The evidence described in this thesis supports four main conclusions; (1) Kir 4. 1 /Kir 5. 1 channels, and the sodium bicarbonate cotratransporter, are the mechanism of RTN astrocyte chemosensitivity, (2) CO 2 -driven purinergic signaling in the RTN is required for complete chemosensation in vivo and in vitro, (3) CO 2 -evoked ATP release is dependent on connexin hemichannels and (4) these purinergic mechanisms are specific to the RTN...|$|R

40|$|Central chemoreception is the {{physiological}} {{process by which}} the brain regulates breathing due to changes in CO 2 /H+ within the tissue. One of the major regions for respiratory control, located in the brainstem, is the retrotrapezoid nucleus (RTN). Severe hypoventilation and the lack of arousal to hypercapnia during sleep links genetic dysfunction of RTN chemoreceptors to several respiratory pathologies, including <b>central</b> <b>congenital</b> <b>hypoventilation</b> <b>syndrome</b> (CCHS). RTN chemoreceptive neurons are sensitive to neuromodulatory inputs from multiple respiratory centers; they serve as a key nexus of respiratory control. The RTN receives extensive serotonergic projections that increase the activity of RTN chemoreceptors and enhance respiratory output. Substantial evidence supports the RTN as a site for central chemoreception. The mechanisms that regulate chemoreceptor function are just becoming unraveled, mainly, repetitive firing behavior and transmitter modulation. Voltage-gated KCNQ channels and hyperpolarization-activated cyclic-nucleotide-gated (HCN) channels are susceptible to neuromodulation. These voltage-gated K+ channels are widely distributed throughout the nervous system and shape neuronal excitability. Suppression of these channels by serotonin and other G-coupled proteins receptors enhances membrane excitability through tonic cellular firing. Both KCNQ and HCN channels are active at resting membrane potentials and therefore, can modulate the repetitive firing behavior of most neurons. Recent discovers implement numerous mutations in Kcnq genes to some forms of pediatric epilepsy, including Benign Familial Neonatal Epilepsy and Ohtahara syndrome. Similarly, recent evidence has shown alterations in HCN channel function can lead to epilepsy and neuropathic pain. Although KCNQ and HCN channels have vast expression throughout the brain, little is known about their specific subunit expression, function, and modulation within brainstem respiratory centers. We hypothesize that these channels contribute to RTN chemoreceptor activity and serve as downstream effectors of serotonergic modulation which in turn can modulate respiratory output. This thesis aims to: 1.) determine the role of KCNQ and HCN channel modulation of RTN chemoreceptor basal activity and 2.) respiratory drive. 3.) Moreover, to identify the means of serotonergic modulation of RTN chemoreceptors...|$|R
40|$|<b>Central</b> <b>congenital</b> <b>hypoventilation</b> <b>syndrome</b> {{is caused}} by {{mutations}} of the gene that encodes the transcription factor Phox 2 b. the syndrome {{is characterized by a}} severe form of sleep apnea attributed to greatly compromised central and peripheral chemoreflexes. in this study, we analyze whether Phox 2 b expression in the brainstem respiratory network is preferentially associated with neurons involved in chemosensory integration in rats. At the very rostral end of the ventral respiratory column (VRC), Phox 2 b was present in many VGlut 2 (vesicular glutamate transporter 2) mRNA-containing neurons. These neurons were functionally identified as the respiratory chemoreceptors of the retrotrapezoid nucleus (RTN). More caudally in the VRC, many fewer neurons expressed Phox 2 b. These cells were not part of the central respiratory pattern generator (CPG), because they were typically cholinergic visceral motor neurons or catecholaminergic neurons (presumed C 1 neurons). Phox 2 b was not detected in serotonergic neurons, in the A 5, A 6, and A 7 noradrenergic cell groups nor within the main cardiorespiratory centers of the dorsolateral pons. Phox 2 b was expressed by many solitary tract nucleus (NTS) neurons including those that relay peripheral chemoreceptor information to the RTN. These and previous observations by others suggest that Phox 2 b is expressed by an uninterrupted chain of neurons involved in the integration of peripheral and central chemoreception (carotid bodies, chemoreceptor afferents, chemoresponsive NTS neurons projecting to VRC, RTN chemoreceptors). the presence of Phox 2 b in this circuit and its apparent absence from the respiratory CPG could explain why Phox 2 b mutations disrupt breathing automaticity during sleep without causing major impairment of respiration during waking.
