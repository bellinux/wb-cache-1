40|$|Generativity, {{defined as}} care and <b>concern</b> {{for future generations}} as {{a legacy of the}} self, has {{typically}} only been studied in midlife samples (Erikson, 1959 / 1969). This research includes two studies that examine the presence of generative <b>concern</b> in early to middle adolescence. The first study examined {{the reliability and validity of}} the Loyola Generativity Scale (LGS; McAdams & de St. Aubin, 1992) as a measure of generative <b>concern,</b> changes in generative <b>concern</b> over time in adolescents (N= 138) from age 14 to 16 years old, and associations of adolescent generative <b>concern</b> with adjustment, attachment style, parenting style, and maternal generative <b>concern.</b> As in studies of non-parent midlife adults, adolescents' generative <b>concern</b> was associated with depressive symptoms and self-esteem, and girls reported higher generative <b>concern</b> than boys. Adolescents' generative <b>concern</b> was also associated with adolescent reports of warm parenting and with maternal generative <b>concern.</b> Although generative <b>concern</b> did not increase over time, higher levels were associated with lower anxious attachment. In addition, inverse associations between attachment anxiety and generative <b>concern</b> were stronger for individuals who reported low avoidant attachment than when avoidance was high. Also, changes in generative <b>concern</b> over time were associated somewhat differently with attachment avoidance for boys than for girls. The second study examined the longitudinal associations between generative <b>concern</b> and caregiving behaviours towards peers in the same early to middle adolescent sample. Results indicated that early caregiving behaviours predicted generative <b>concern</b> one year later, while early generative <b>concern</b> did not predict later caregiving behaviours. Thus evidence suggests that caregiving behaviour with friends promotes the development of generative <b>concern.</b> In conclusion, both studies highlight the importance of studying generative <b>concern</b> in adolescence, and suggest that positive relationships with parents and positive behaviour with peers contribute to early generative <b>concern.</b> That is, both a non-anxious attachment style, as well as the caregiving behaviours appear to promote early generative <b>concern.</b> It is hoped that this research will contribute to promoting and maintaining generativity from adolescence into adulthoo...|$|R

Patient groups {{more likely to report}} <b>concern</b> were those of lower socio-economic status, born outside Australia, or of younger age. Although a small proportion of patients reported very high levels of <b>concern</b> regarding waiting times, the experience of some <b>concern</b> was prevalent. Opportunities for reducing this <b>concern</b> are discussed. Vulnerable groups, such as younger and socio-economically disadvantaged patients, should be the focus of efforts to reduce waiting times and patient <b>concern</b> levels...|$|R
