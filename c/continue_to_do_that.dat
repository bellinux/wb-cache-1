2500|$|United States – The US Department of State {{announced}} limited {{support for}} the PYD in February 2016, although it opposes the unilateral establishment of a federal region in northern Syria.

[...] The USA have usually supported the YPG militia in its fight against ISIL, both with air support in combat and with embedded US Special Forces. During the Northern Raqqa offensive (May 2016), US Special Operation Forces were widely reported and photographed taking part, wearing YPG and YPJ badges on their uniforms. When in June 2016 the Manbij offensive started, the Washington Post reported it under the headline of [...] "Ignoring Turkey, U.S. backs Kurds in drive against ISIS in Syria". On 7 November 2016, when asked about the federalization of Syria, Mark C. Toner, the Deputy Spokesperson for the US Department of State, said [...] "We don’t want to see any kind of ad hoc federalism or federalist system arise. We don’t want to see semi-autonomous zones. The reality is, though, as territory is liberated from Daesh, you got to get some kind of governance back into these areas, but by no means are we condoning or – any kind of, as I said, ad hoc semi-autonomous areas in northern Syria". According to lieutenant general Stephen J. Townsend of the United States Army in an interview on 29 March 2017, the US does not recognize Rojava as a [...] "Kurdish state" [...] but instead sees it as a [...] "multi-cultural, multi-party, multi-ethnic, multi-sectarian Syrian region being liberated from ISIS." ...|$|E
60|$|It {{was the way}} the {{irregular}} life sat upon Bilham and Miss Barrace that was the insidious, the delicate marvel. He was eager to concede that their relation to it was all indirect, for anything else in him would have shown the grossness of bad manners; but the indirectness was none the less consonant--THAT was striking-with a grateful enjoyment of everything that was Chad's. They spoke of him repeatedly, invoking his good name and good nature, and the worst confusion of mind for Strether was that all their mention of him was of a kind to do him honour. They commended his munificence and approved his taste, and in doing so sat down, as it seemed to Strether, in the very soil out of which these things flowered. Our friend's final predicament was that he himself was sitting down, for the time, WITH them, and there was a supreme moment at which, compared with his collapse, Waymarsh's erectness affected him as really high. One thing was certain--he saw he must make up his mind. He must approach Chad, must wait for him, deal with him, master him, but he mustn't dispossess himself of the faculty of seeing things as they were. He must bring him to HIM--not go himself, as it were, so much of the way. He must at any rate be clearer as to what--should he <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> for convenience--he was still condoning. It was on the detail of this quantity--and what could the fact be but mystifying?-that Bilham and Miss Barrace threw so little light. So there they were.|$|E

50|$|Another {{important}} lesson here {{is about how}} Krishna rewards true persons. Krishna did not reward Sudama {{just because he was}} a friend.

We'd go the same way again, but with a different cast we might have attracted an audience. I believe in returning investors' money - and if I could make The Driver again I'd try to rectify it for a commercial market. When you're writing this kind of script... naturally you think of an action lead like Bronson or Eastwood... and certainly Fox wanted a name. But when we got Ryan, I suggested we make changes to suit his character. This is always the director's prerogative.Isabelle Adjani later complained she felt the film hurt her career.
