25|$|Tandem or spider rappelling — Involves two climbers {{descending}} on {{the same}} belay device. This is done in some rescue situations {{when one of the}} climbers is incapacitated or the descent needs to be done quickly. The set-up is similar to a regular rappelling set-up with the first climber is girth hitched off a sling into the descender on the <b>carabiner,</b> and has an auto-block from belay loop of the harness to the rope as a backup. The second rappeller is also girth hitched into the belay device on the <b>carabiner</b> and also anchored into the main rappeller's harness as a back-up.|$|E
25|$|In {{the morning}} the three guides came back, {{traversing}} the face from a hole near the Eigerwand station and risking their lives under incessant avalanches. Toni Kurz was still alive but almost helpless, {{with one hand and}} one arm completely frozen. Kurz hauled himself off the cliff after cutting loose the rope that bound him to his dead teammate below and climbed back onto the face. The guides were not able to pass an unclimbable overhang that separated them from Kurz. They managed to give him a rope long enough to reach them by tying two ropes together. While descending, Kurz could not get the knot to pass through his <b>carabiner.</b> He tried for hours to reach his rescuers who were only a few metres below him. Then he began to lose consciousness. One of the guides, climbing on another's shoulders, was able to touch the tip of Kurz's crampons with his ice-axe but could not reach higher. Kurz was unable to descend further and, completely exhausted, died slowly.|$|E
5000|$|The Garda {{requires}} two similar <b>carabiners,</b> {{and works}} best with two identical oval <b>carabiners.</b> However, identical [...] "D" [...] <b>carabiners</b> will work, {{although there is}} a risk of the [...] "D" [...] <b>carabiners</b> unclipping.|$|R
50|$|<b>Carabiners</b> {{are made}} with many {{different}} types of gates including wire-gate, bent-gate, and straight-gate. The different gates have different strengths and uses. Most locking <b>carabiners</b> utilize a straight-gate. Bent-gate and wire-gate <b>carabiners</b> are usually found on the rope-end of quickdraws, as they facilitate easier rope clipping than straight-gate <b>carabiners.</b>|$|R
50|$|Notable Black Diamond {{products}} include spring-loaded camming devices called Camalot and Magnetron <b>carabiners,</b> auto-locking <b>carabiners</b> {{that use}} magnets in {{the gate and}} a steel insert in the <b>carabiner’s</b> nose for added security.|$|R
2500|$|S.T.A.T. Tourniquet is {{currently}} the only tourniquet that has an automatic counting timer and can be applied in 5 seconds by a person with no experience. S.T.A.T. Tourniquet is designed to keep multiple Tourniquet Preloaded on a <b>carabiner</b> for Mass Casualty situations. [...] S.T.A.T. [...] can occlude blood flow on limbs as small as 20mm making it the most ideal tourniquet for pediatric and K9 use.|$|E
2500|$|A {{descender}} or rappel {{device is}} a friction device or friction hitch that allows rope to be payed {{out in a}} controlled fashion, under load, with a minimal effort by the person controlling it. The speed at which the abseiler descends is controlled by applying greater or lesser force on the rope below the device or altering the angle at which the rope exits the device. Descenders can be task-designed or improvised from other equipment. Mechanical descenders include braking bars, the figure eight, the abseil rack, the [...] "bobbin" [...] (and its self-locking variant the [...] "stop"), the gold tail, and the [...] "sky genie" [...] used by some window-washers and wildfire firefighters. Some improvised descenders include the Munter hitch, a <b>carabiner</b> wrap, the basic crossed-carabiner brake and the piton bar brake (sometimes called the <b>carabiner</b> and piton). There is an older, more uncomfortable, method of wrapping the rope around one's body for friction instead of using a descender, as in the Dulfersitz or Geneva methods used by climbers in the 1960s.|$|E
2500|$|The {{umbilical}} {{contains a}} hose {{to supply the}} breathing gas and usually several other components. These usually include a strength member, {{which may be the}} airline hose or a rope, a communications cable (comms wire), and a [...] hose. When needed, a hot water supply line, helium reclaim line, and/or video camera and lighting cables may be included. These components are neatly twisted into a multistrand cable, and are deployed as a single unit. The diver's end has underwater connectors for the electrical cables, and the air hoses are usually connected to the helmet, band mask, or bailout block by JIC fittings. A screw-gate <b>carabiner</b> or similar connector is provided on the strength member for attachment to the diver's harness, and may be used to lift the diver in an emergency. Similar connections are provided for attachment to the diving bell, if used, or to the surface gas panel and communications equipment.|$|E
50|$|Rescue: Minimum {{breaking}} strength requirements and calculations for rescue <b>carabiners</b> are {{set out in}} National Fire Protection Association standard 1983-2012 edition Fire Service Life Safety Rope and Equipment. The standard defines two classes of rescue <b>carabiners.</b> Technical use rescue <b>carabiners</b> are required to have minimum {{breaking strength}}s of 27 kN gate closed, 7 kN gate open and 7 kN minor axis. General use rescue <b>carabiners</b> are required to have minimum breaking strengths of 40 kN gate closed, 11 kN gate open and 11 kN minor axis. Testing procedures for rescue <b>carabiners</b> are set out in ASTM International standard F 1956 Standard Specification of Rescue <b>Carabiners.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>Carabiners</b> are metal loops with {{spring-loaded}} gates (openings), used as connectors. Once made {{primarily from}} steel, almost all <b>carabiners</b> for recreational climbing are now {{made from a}} light weight aluminum alloy. Steel <b>carabiners</b> are much heavier, but harder wearing, and therefore are often used by instructors when working with groups.|$|R
50|$|The {{traditional}} self-belay system basically {{consists of}} two <b>carabiners</b> operated by the participants. The participants successively unlock/lock the connection of the <b>carabiners</b> on each platform (zone of risk). Mishandling and removal of both <b>carabiners</b> {{at the same time}} will cause complete unlocking. This situation could mean a life-threatening risk and there have been instances of serious accidents and even terminal injuries.|$|R
50|$|The {{friction}} of {{the rope}} against the screw on the <b>carabiner</b> can cause the screw to undo and the <b>carabiner</b> to open, potentially weakening {{the strength of the}} <b>carabiner,</b> or allowing the rope to escape the <b>carabiner</b> completely.|$|E
5000|$|The Bachmann hitch {{requires}} {{the use of}} a <b>carabiner.</b> It does not matter if the <b>carabiner</b> is locking or not. Most importantly, the <b>carabiner</b> must be of round cross section for friction. Grabbing hold of the <b>carabiner</b> will release the friction and allow the hitch to slide freely and thus be moved appropriately. To remove the Bachmann hitch, just unclip the top loop, hold on to the <b>carabiner</b> and pull the cord free.|$|E
5000|$|A quickdraw {{consists}} of two carabiners connected by a semi-rigid material. One <b>carabiner</b> connects to an anchoring device. The other <b>carabiner</b> connects to a rope.|$|E
50|$|A radium release hitch is {{typically}} tied with 10 meters of 8mm rope and two locking <b>carabiners.</b> A reasonable length for the hitch (distance between the 2 <b>carabiners)</b> is 10 to 15 cm.|$|R
50|$|Non-locking <b>carabiners</b> (or snap-links) have a sprung {{swinging}} {{gate that}} accepts a rope, webbing sling, or other hardware. Rock climbers frequently connect two non-locking <b>carabiners</b> {{with a short}} length of nylon web to create a quickdraw.|$|R
50|$|Hog Tie: While {{suspended}} from <b>carabiners</b> by their wrists and feet under a large bamboo pole, players try to shimmy {{their way from}} one end of the pole to the other, grab a key halfway through, then unlock the <b>carabiners</b> with the key, while laying on a platform. Once a player has unlocked the <b>carabiners,</b> he/she can return to the ground, then race back to the beginning side of the pole to ring a gong.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a study on}} the residual strength of <b>carabiners</b> which have sustained impact damage due to accidental dropping during lead climbing. The question answered here is whether damaged quickdraws can be reused for future climbing or whether they should be replaced. Well defined damages were introduced into the main body and the gate of three different types of quickdraw <b>carabiners.</b> The <b>carabiners</b> were visually inspected and tested for functionality before the residual strength was measured following procedures defined in mountaineering standards. Contrary to common perception no micro-cracks were found within the damaged <b>carabiners.</b> In general, the <b>carabiners</b> tested here showed good resistance to impact damage. Impact on the main body does not seem to affect the residual strength. Impact on the wire gate may result in failure of the gate. However, if the gate is still functional, the strength is not affected by an impact...|$|R
50|$|Locking <b>carabiners</b> {{have the}} same general shape as {{non-locking}} <b>carabiners</b> but have an additional mechanism securing the gate. These mechanisms may be either threaded sleeves ("screw-lock"), spring-loaded sleeves ("twist-lock"), magnetic levers ("Magnetron"), other spring loaded unlocking levers or double-gates ("Twin-Gate"),.|$|R
5000|$|The {{permanent}} belay systems {{significantly reduce}} the risk of accident. The two <b>carabiners</b> have a [...] "communicating system” which avoids simultaneous opening of the <b>carabiners</b> and the complete unlocking from the cable. A permanent system with integrated rollers can even be found.|$|R
50|$|However, with {{non-locking}} <b>carabiner</b> it {{is safer}} {{to use the}} knot with <b>carabiner</b> gate opening facing down (opposite to what {{is shown in the}} picture). This decreases the risk of self-unclipping: at maximum, one twist goes off. Otherwise, the whole knot may fail.|$|E
50|$|A Guide Plate, {{also known}} as an auto-blocking belay device, is a metal plate with an {{elongated}} slot for the bight to go through and then a <b>carabiner</b> is attached so that when pull from the climber occurs the <b>carabiner</b> will be pulled to lock off the device.|$|E

50|$|The Sticht {{plate was}} the first {{mechanical}} rope brake, named after its designer, Fritz Sticht. It consists of a small metal plate with a slot that allows a bight of rope to pass through to a locking <b>carabiner</b> and back out.
