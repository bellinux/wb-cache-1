5|$|Like most of Southern California, the {{majority}} of San Diego's current area was originally occupied by <b>chaparral,</b> a plant community made up mostly of drought-resistant shrubs. The endangered Torrey pine has the bulk of its population in San Diego in a stretch of protected <b>chaparral</b> along the coast. The steep and varied topography and proximity to the ocean create {{a number of different}} habitats within the city limits, including tidal marsh and canyons. The <b>chaparral</b> and coastal sage scrub habitats in low elevations along the coast are prone to wildfire, and the rates of fire have increased in the 20th century, due primarily to fires starting near the borders of urban and wild areas.|$|E
5|$|American {{black bears}} have been spotted in the <b>chaparral</b> region, {{usually in the}} fall. The most common birds include titmice and the acorn woodpecker. blue-gray gnatcatchers, lesser goldfinches, and Anna's {{hummingbirds}} have also been seen.|$|E
5|$|<b>Chaparral</b> {{is a type}} of shrubland, {{receiving}} {{very little}} precipitation. Sclerophyllous plants such as manzanita and buckbrush grow in this area, both relying on fire to reproduce. The rare Gentner's fritillary also grows in this region.|$|E

5|$|Murray had {{designed}} {{a car for}} the 1979 season called the BT47 that had a <b>Chaparral</b> 2J-type box rear end with twin variable geometry fans on the rear to maximize ground effect. The car was never built due to the FIA closing the loophole in the regulations for the 1979 season.|$|E
5|$|This sparrow {{is found}} in open oak {{woodlands}} and dry uplands with grassy vegetation and bushes. It is often found near rocky outcroppings. The species is also known from coastal scrublands and <b>chaparral</b> areas. The rufous-crowned sparrow thrives in open areas cleared by burning.|$|E
5|$|Josh Weinstein (born May 5, 1966) is an American {{television}} {{writer and}} producer, {{known for his}} work on the animated comedy series The Simpsons. Weinstein and Bill Oakley became best friends and writing partners at St. Albans High School; Weinstein then attended Stanford University and was editor-in-chief of the Stanford <b>Chaparral.</b> He worked on several short-term media projects, including writing for the variety show Sunday Best, but was then unemployed for a long period.|$|E

5|$|The Cascade Range is {{dramatically}} different in climate from west to east. The west side is heavily forested and features trees such as Douglas firs, western hemlock, Pacific silver firs, and Alaska yellow cedars. East of the Cascades, where Yamsay lies, the climate becomes much drier, even arid. Precipitation significantly declines and vegetation becomes more sparse, with lodgepole pine, white fir, ponderosa pine, and juniper. To the south, <b>chaparral</b> {{plants such as}} beargrass and bitterbrush prevail.|$|E
5|$|The {{geographic}} range of Timema {{is limited to}} mountainous regions of western North America between 30° and 42° N. They are found primarily in California, {{as well as in}} a few other neighboring states (Oregon, Nevada, Arizona) and in northern Mexico. All are herbivores, primarily feeding on host plants found in <b>chaparral.</b>|$|E
5|$|There are sixteen {{prominent}} vegetation {{zones in}} the San Juan watershed, which include riparian vegetation, montane woodlands, coastal sage scrub and <b>chaparral.</b> Riparian vegetation is found {{along the banks}} of free-flowing streams with a measurable flow for at least several months out of the year. These include most of San Juan Creek, upper Trabuco Creek, Cañada Gobernadora, Bell Canyon, and other headwater streams, as well as scattered patches along Oso and El Horno creeks. Forests are present at high elevations, and also occur in close proximity to waterways. Coastal sage scrub is found on south-facing hillsides, while <b>chaparral</b> is found on higher-elevation hillsides and mesas. There are also a number of rare plant communities along rock outcroppings and vernal pools. However, introduced plant species, such as giant reed, castor bean, and tobacco tree, are rapidly spreading along streams. Giant reed has taken over huge areas of wetlands, swamps and riparian zones along the creek and its tributaries, although in recent years the county has taken steps toward eradicating it from San Juan Creek and other nearby streams.|$|E

50|$|The 1967-68 Dallas <b>Chaparrals</b> {{season was}} the first season of the <b>Chaparrals</b> in the American Basketball Association. The Chaps fell to the New Orleans Buccaneers in the Division Finals after beating the Houston Mavericks in the Semifinals. That playoff victory would be their only victory for the <b>Chaparrals</b> as they fell in the Semifinals {{for the next four}} years, before they moved to San Antonio.|$|R
50|$|The 1969-70 Dallas <b>Chaparrals</b> {{season was}} the third season of the <b>Chaparrals</b> in the American Basketball Association. Hagan (who had been player-coach since the team's inception) was fired halfway through the season, and General Manager Max Williams took over as coach. The Chaps once again fell in the ABA Semifinals. After the season, the team {{attempted}} to gain more fans in the state by playing games in Fort Worth and Lubbock, under the moniker of the Texas <b>Chaparrals.</b> This experiment was done for only one season, and the team re-branded back to being the Dallas <b>Chaparrals</b> before the next season started.|$|R
5|$|Four {{overlapping}} ecological regions {{have been}} identified on the Table Rocks, with considerable differences in the variety of wildlife found in each. From the outermost base of the rocks, three regions consisting of oak savanna, <b>chaparral,</b> and mixed woodland surround the relatively flat tops. The andesite cap is covered by the fourth region, mounded prairie. This region formed when the caps were slowly eroded by the freezing and thawing of water that seeped into the ground (ice erosion), which created layers of mounded soil. Vernal pools fill in from October to June in the mounded prairie area due to the andesite's impermeability. The pools support species of plants and animals.|$|E
5|$|Hundreds {{of species}} {{of animals and}} plants {{characterize}} the Santa Ana River's diversity of climates and vegetation zones. There are over ten of these vegetation zones in the watershed—including the sparsely vegetated alpine and subalpine zones in the mountains, mid-elevation forests of pine, lodgepole and oak, <b>chaparral,</b> coastal sage scrub, the increasingly rare riparian forest and marshes along the river bed, lined with trees and rushes, and the thinly vegetated coastal areas virtually flush with sea level. The watershed supports up to 200 bird species, fifty mammal species, 13 reptile species, 7 amphibian species, and 15 fish species, including steelhead trout.|$|E
5|$|More than 70species {{of animals}} {{are known to}} live on the Table Rocks. Lizards such as the western fence lizard, {{southern}} alligator lizard, and western skink have been seen in all four regions of the Table Rocks. Western rattlesnakes and two species of garter snakes also live in all regions. Black-tailed deer, coyotes, and bobcats are some of the mammals that live on the Table Rocks. The rocks are also home to western black-legged ticks, although they are mainly found in the <b>chaparral</b> region. Many species of birds live on the rocks.|$|E
50|$|The 1968-69 Dallas <b>Chaparrals</b> {{season was}} the second season of the <b>Chaparrals</b> in the American Basketball Association. Once again, the Chaps lost to the New Orleans Buccaneers in the playoffs, {{this time in the}} Semifinals.|$|R
50|$|There was a one-game playoff {{for fourth}} {{place in the}} Western Division because the Texas <b>Chaparrals</b> and Denver Rockets had tied with regular season records of 30-54. The game was played on April 1 and the <b>Chaparrals</b> won 115-109.|$|R
25|$|The San Antonio Spurs {{started out}} as the Dallas <b>Chaparrals</b> of the {{original}} version of the American Basketball Association (ABA). Coached by player/coach Cliff Hagan the Dallas <b>Chaparrals</b> were one of 11 teams to take {{the floor in the}} inaugural season of the upstart ABA. The Chaps second season {{was a bit of a}} disappointment, as the team finished in 4th place with a mediocre 41–37 record. In the playoffs the <b>Chaparrals</b> quickly fell to the New Orleans Buccaneers.|$|R
5|$|Oak savanna {{is a type}} of {{grassland}} with scattered oak trees, {{found on}} the lowest slopes of the Table Rocks. The Takelma tribe often set fires in the oak savanna and <b>chaparral</b> regions to prevent brush overgrowth, creating foraging areas for animals such as deer and elk. It also prevented large wildfires. Oregon white oak and ponderosa pine are the most common trees found in the region. Buckbrush, sticky whiteleaf manzanita, Pacific madrone, deerbrush, birchleaf mountain mahogany, and Pacific poison oak are also common.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the 1940s, {{wildfires}} {{burned through}} the Little Applegate River watershed frequently. The United States Forest Service began fire suppression {{efforts in the}} 1920s, and a smokejumper station was built about 20 years later. Species that depend on fire to reproduce—such as ponderosa pine—declined in population, while Douglas-fir and white fir spread. Buckbrush and manzanita, normally <b>chaparral</b> plants, encroached on the oak savanna regions. The vegetation in the watershed continues to grow denser, making it more susceptible to insect infestations and disease.|$|E
5|$|The Trinity River {{watershed}} borders {{several major}} California drainage basins; {{these are the}} Mad River and Redwood Creek to the west, the Salmon River and Scott River (tributaries of the Klamath River) to the north, and Clear Creek and Cottonwood Creek (both tributaries of the Sacramento River) {{to the east and}} south, respectively. Fir, oak, and pine forests cover about 92percent of the watershed. <b>Chaparral</b> and shrubs account for slightly over 5percent, and grassland and barren land each cover approximately 1percent. Riparian zones and wetlands encompass 0.5percent of the watershed. Less than 2percent of the watershed is urbanized.|$|E

5|$|The cottage {{garden in}} France is a {{development}} of the early 20th century. Monet's garden at Giverny is a prominent example, a sprawling garden full of varied plantings, rich colors, and water gardens. In modern times, the term 'cottage garden' is used to describe any number of informal garden styles, using design and plants very different from their traditional English cottage garden origins. Examples include regional variations using a grass prairie scheme (in the American midwest) and California <b>chaparral</b> cottage gardens.|$|E
5|$|The mockingbird's habitat {{varies by}} location, but it prefers open areas with sparse vegetation. In the eastern regions, {{suburban}} and urban {{areas such as}} parks, gardens are frequent residential areas. It has an affinity for mowed lawns with shrubs within proximity for shade and nesting. In western regions, desert scrub, <b>chaparral</b> are among its preferred habitats When foraging for food, it prefers short grass. This bird does not nest in densely forested areas, and generally resides in the same habitats year round.|$|E
5|$|The {{watershed}} {{is covered}} predominantly by temperate coniferous forest, which makes up approximately 64 {{percent of the}} total area. The primary species in these areas are Douglas-fir, ponderosa pine, madrone, and incense-cedar. Buckbrush and manzanita grow in the drier <b>chaparral</b> regions. Several rare plants including Gentner's fritillary, oblongleaf stonecrop, Siskiyou lewisia, clustered lady's slipper, and splithair Indian paintbrush also grow in the watershed. Seven species of noxious weeds have been identified: three species of thistles, medusahead rye, Scotch broom, St. Johns wort, and tansy ragwort.|$|E
