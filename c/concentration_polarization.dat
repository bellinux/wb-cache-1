50|$|In the solution-diffusion model, {{transport}} occurs only by diffusion. The {{component that}} needs to be transported must first be dissolved in the membrane. The general approach of the solution-diffusion model is to assume that the chemical potential of the feed and permeate fluids are in equilibrium with the adjacent membrane surfaces such that appropriate expressions for the chemical potential in the fluid and membrane phases can be equated at the solution-membrane interface. This principle is more important for dense membranes without natural pores such as those used for reverse osmosis and in fuel cells. During the filtration process a boundary layer forms on the membrane. This concentration gradient is created by molecules which cannot pass through the membrane. The effect is referred as <b>concentration</b> <b>polarization</b> and, occurring during the filtration, leads to a reduced trans-membrane flow (flux). <b>Concentration</b> <b>polarization</b> is, in principle, reversible by cleaning the membrane which results in the initial flux being almost totally restored. Using a tangential flow to the membrane (cross-flow filtration) can also minimize <b>concentration</b> <b>polarization.</b>|$|E

Although some of these results could be obtained by other methods, such as Boussinesq’s streamline coordinates, the present approach is based on a simple unifying principle of more general applicability.

5000|$|In {{membrane}} {{science and}} technology, <b>concentration</b> <b>polarization</b> {{refers to the}} emergence of concentration gradients at a membrane/solution interface resulted from selective transfer of some species through the membrane under the effect of transmembrane driving forces. Generally, the cause of <b>concentration</b> <b>polarization</b> is the ability of a membrane to transport some species more readily than the other(s) (which is the membrane permselectivity): the retained species are concentrated at the upstream membrane surface while the concentration of transported species decreases. Thus, <b>concentration</b> <b>polarization</b> phenomenon is inherent to all types of membrane separation processes. In the cases of gas separations, pervaporation, membrane distillation, reverse osmosis, nanofiltration, ultrafiltration, and microfiltration separations, the concentration profile has a higher level of solute nearest to the upstream membrane surface compared with the more or less well mixed bulk fluid far from the membrane surface. In the case of dialysis and electrodialysis, the concentrations of selectively transported dissolved species are reduced at the upstream membrane surface compared to the bulk solution. The emergence of concentration gradients is illustrated in Figs. 1a and 1b. Fig. 1a shows the concentration profile near and within a membrane when an external driving force is just applied to an initially equilibrium system. Concentration gradients have not yet formed. If the membrane is selectively permeable to species 1, its flux (...) within the membrane is higher than that in the solution (...) [...] Higher flux in the membrane causes a decrease in the concentration at the upstream membrane surface (...) and an increase at the downstream surface (...) , Fig. 1b. Thus, the upstream solution becomes depleted and the downstream solution becomes enriched in regard to species 1. The concentration gradients cause additional diffusion fluxes, which contribute to an increase of the total flux in the solutions and to a decrease of the flux in the membrane. As a result, the system reaches a steady state where [...] The greater the external force applied, the lower [...] In electrodialysis, when [...] becomes much lower than the bulk concentration, the resistance of the depleted solution becomes quite elevated.

40|$|As solid {{oxide fuel}} cells (SOFCs) are highly {{nonlinear}} systems, a single linear controller cannot perform satisfactorily {{over a wide}} range of operating conditions of the processes. This work studies multilinear-model predictive control of a tubular SOFC. The objective is to control the fuel cell outlet voltage {{over a wide range}} of operating conditions by manipulating inlet fuel pressure (flow rate). A first-principles model of an ammonia fed-tubular solid oxide fuel cell is used for the controller design. The model accounts for diffusion, inherent impedance, transport (momentum, heat and mass transfer), electrochemical reactions, activation and <b>concentration</b> <b>polarizations,</b> and the ammonia decomposition reaction. The servo and regulatory performances of the multimodel predictive controller (MMPC) are compared with those of a single-model predictive controller (SMPC) and a proportional-integral (PI) controller. For small load changes, the MMPC, SMPC, and PI controller all provide zero offset, and the MMPC yields the best closed-loop performance.

The inhibition performances of Pho 1 and Pho 2 on mild steel corrosion in 0, 5 M H 2 SO 4 solution were studied using the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), weight loss, and Tafel polarization technics.

50|$|There are {{two main}} flow {{configurations}} of membrane processes: cross-flow (or) tangential flow and dead-end filtrations. In cross-flow filtration the feed flow is tangential {{to the surface of}} membrane, retentate is removed from the same side further downstream, whereas the permeate flow is tracked on the other side. In dead-end filtration the direction of the fluid flow is normal to the membrane surface. Both flow geometries offer some advantages and disadvantages. Generally, dead-end filtration is used for feasibility studies on a laboratory scale. The dead-end membranes are relatively easy to fabricate which reduces the cost of the separation process. The dead-end membrane separation process is easy to implement and the process is usually cheaper than cross-flow membrane filtration. The dead-end filtration process is usually a batch-type process, where the filtering solution is loaded (or slowly fed) into the membrane device, which then allows passage of some particles subject to the driving force. The main disadvantage of a dead end filtration is the extensive membrane fouling and <b>concentration</b> <b>polarization.</b> The fouling is usually induced faster at higher driving forces. Membrane fouling and particle retention in a feed solution also builds up a concentration gradients and particle back flow (<b>concentration</b> <b>polarization).</b> The tangential flow devices are more cost and labor-intensive, but they are less susceptible to fouling due to the sweeping effects and high shear rates of the passing flow. The most commonly used synthetic membrane devices (modules) are flat sheets/plates, spiral wounds, and hollow fibers.|$|E
50|$|<b>Concentration</b> <b>polarization</b> {{strongly}} {{affects the}} performance of the separation process. First, concentration changes in the solution reduce the driving force within the membrane, hence, the useful flux/rate of separation. In the case of pressure driven processes, this phenomenon causes an increase of the osmotic pressure gradient in the membrane, which reduces the net driving pressure gradient. In the case of dialysis, the driving concentration gradient in the membrane is reduced. In the case of electromembrane processes, the potential drop in the diffusion boundary layers reduces the gradient of electric potential in the membrane. Lower rate of separation under the same external driving force means increased power consumption.|$|E
50|$|The <b>concentration</b> <b>polarization</b> is {{the result}} of {{practical}} limitations on mass transport within the cell and represents the voltage loss due to spatial variations in reactant concentration at the chemically active sites. This situation can be caused when the reactants are consumed by the electrochemical reaction faster than they can diffuse into the porous electrode, and can also be caused by variation in bulk flow composition. The latter {{is due to the fact}} that the consumption of reacting species in the reactant flows causes a drop in reactant concentration as it travels along the cell, which causes a drop in the local potential near the tail end of the cell.|$|E

Dynamic output voltage, fuel-cell-tube temperature and efficiency responses to step changes in the inlet fuel flow pressure with different values of design parameters are discussed. It is found that among the studied parameters, the inner cell tube diameter has the strongest effect on fuel cell efficiency. On the other hand, the influence of cathodic porosity on fuel cell performance and transient response is {{higher than that of}} the anodic porosity. The transient response with different sizes of micro and macro-structures is studied and it is observed that changing the fuel cell length has the most effect.

40|$|A {{parametric}} equation {{for describing}} polarization in solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC) {{is presented in}} terms of experimentally measurable parameters. The equation explicitly describes activation and <b>concentration</b> <b>polarizations</b> at the two electrodes, and the ohmic loss {{as a function of}} current density. Using the equation and known values of experimentally measured parameters, determined by in-cell and out-of-cell tests, various polarizations are estimated as functions of current density, and the maximum possible performance characteristics are assessed. The parameters used for the calculations of polarization curves include: (a) Charge transfer resistivity as a function of temperature and atmosphere measured using patterned electrodes deposited by micro photolithography. (b) Effective gas phase diffusivities measured using an electrochemical technique or from prior cell performance fitting. (c) Estimated ohmic loss using in-cell and out-of-cell measurements. Polarization curves are calculated for two different microstructures in the functional layers. Then, using the model, prospects for ultra-high power density SOFC at intermediate temperatures (< 800 oC) are examined. The results show that even in thin electrolyte film, anode-supported cells, ohmic contribution can be substantial. The results also show that the electrode particle size has a substantial effect on activation polarization...|$|R
5000|$|Another major {{limitation}} of the electrokinetics process is the decrease the electric potential of the system. Different polarization effects can decrease how the system runs. For instance:Activation polarization can occur during the electrokinetic remediation process removing gas bubbles that form {{on the surface of}} the electrodes during conductivity. Resistance polarization can occur after the electrokinetic remediation process has started a white layer can be observed. Just like in hard water stains this layer may be the insoluble salt and other impurities that inhibit conductivity. <b>Concentration</b> <b>polarization</b> happens when hydrogen ions generated at the anode are attracted to the cathode and the hydroxide ions generated at the cathode are attracted to the anode. If neutralization occurs the potential between the system drops. [...] Local flattening of the electrical potential profile can also cause the difference in migration.|$|E
50|$|In electrochemistry, <b>concentration</b> <b>{{polarization}}</b> {{denotes the}} part of the polarization of an electrolytic cell resulting from changes in the electrolyte concentration due to the passage of current through the electrode/solution interface. Here polarization is understood as the shift of the Electrochemical potential difference across the cell from its equilibrium value. When the term is used in this sense, it is equivalent to “concentration overpotential”. The cause of the changes in concentration (emergence of concentration gradients in the solution adjacent to the electrode surface) is the difference in the rate of electrochemical reaction at the electrode and the rate of ion migration in the solution from/to the surface. When a chemical species participating in an electrochemical electrode reaction is in short supply, the concentration of this species at the surface decreases causing diffusion, which is added to the migration transport towards the surface {{in order to maintain the}} balance of consumption and delivery of that species.|$|E
50|$|When {{filtration}} occurs {{the local}} concentration of rejected material at the membrane surface increases and can become saturated. In UF, increased ion concentration can develop an osmotic {{pressure on the}} feed side of the membrane. This reduces the effective TMP of the system, therefore reducing permeation rate. The increase in concentrated layer at the membrane wall decreases the permeate flux, due to increase in resistance which reduces the driving force for solvent to transport through membrane surface. CP affects almost all the available membrane separation process. In RO, the solutes retained at the membrane layer results in higher osmotic pressure {{in comparison to the}} bulk stream concentration. So the higher pressures are required to overcome this osmotic pressure. Concentration polarisation plays a dominant role in ultrafiltration as compared to microfiltration because of the small pore size membrane. It must be noted that <b>concentration</b> <b>polarization</b> differs from fouling as it has no lasting effects on the membrane itself and can be reversed by relieving the TMP. It does however {{have a significant effect on}} many types of fouling.|$|E
