2500|$|The group {{tried to}} buy an [...] "off-the-peg" [...] single or multiengine {{monoplane}} from Wright Aeronautical, then Travel Air, and finally the newly formed Columbia Aircraft Corporation, but all insisted on selecting the pilot as a <b>condition</b> <b>of</b> <b>sale.</b> Finally the much smaller Ryan Aircraft Company of San Diego agreed to design and build a custom monoplane for $10,580, and on [...] a deal was formally closed.

50|$|It is {{controversial}} whether tickets are goods {{which can be}} privately resold.

50|$|The <b>conditions</b> <b>of</b> <b>sale</b> {{for land}} in the Huron Tract were open to interpretation.

The opposition, the Colborne Clique, had a different opinion and were able to sway a victory in defiance of the Family Compact and Sir John Robinson's position. This issue is one of many that lead to the Rebellion of 1837.

50|$|Thus {{for many}} years, {{the only known}} legally viable means of {{acquiring}} the trackbed, lay in the Liquidator (or later, the Official Receiver) first obtaining an Abandonment Order, before any sale could go through.

In fact this later became a <b>condition</b> <b>of</b> <b>sale,</b> which helped to delay the winding up of the 1922 WHLR Company until 2003.|$|E
