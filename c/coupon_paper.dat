However, RDS faces logistical and theoretical challenges that threaten efficiency and validity in settings worldwide. We present innovative adaptations to conventional RDS to overcome barriers encountered in recruiting a large, {{representative sample of}} {{men who have sex}} with men (MSM) who travel internationally. Novel methodological adaptations for the "International Travel Research to Inform Prevention" or "I-TRIP" study were offering participants a choice between electronic and <b>paper</b> <b>coupons</b> referrals for recruitment and modifying the secondary incentives structure from small cash amounts to raffle entries for periodic large cash prize raffle drawings. Staged referral limit increases from 3 to 10 referrals and progressive addition of 70 seeds were also implemented. There were 501 participants enrolled in up to 13 waves of growth. Among participants with a choice of referral methods, 81 % selected electronic referrals. Of participants who were recruited electronically, 90 % chose to remain with electronic referrals when it was their turn to recruit. The mean number of enrolled referrals was 0. 91 for electronic referrals compared to 0. 56 for <b>paper</b> <b>coupons.</b> Median referral lag time, i. e., the time interval between when recruiters were given their referrals and when a referred individual enrolled in the study, was 20 days (IQR 10 - 40) for electronic referrals, 20 days (IQR 8 - 58) for <b>paper</b> <b>coupons,</b> 20 days (IQR 10 - 41) for raffle entries and 33 days (IQR 16 - 148) for small cash incentives. The recruitment of MSM who travel internationally required maximizing known flexible tools of RDS while at the same time necessitating innovations to increase recruitment efficiency. Electronic referrals emerged as a major advantage in recruiting this hard-to-reach population who are of high socio-economic status, geographically diffuse and highly mobile. These enhancements may improve the performance of RDS in target populations with similar characteristics...|$|R

The work proposes a software architecture consisting of three main components: linked data for e-commerce, cloud-based services, and mobile apps. The three components implement a scenario where a shopping mall is presented as an intelligent environment in which customers use NFC capabilities of their smartphones in order to handle e-coupons produced, suggested, and consumed by the abovesaid environment. The main function of the intelligent environment is to help customers define shopping plans, which minimize the overall shopping cost by looking for best prices, discounts, and <b>coupons.</b> The <b>paper</b> proposes a genetic algorithm to find suboptimal solutions for the shopping plan problem in a highly dynamic context, where the final cost of a product for an individual customer is dependent on his previous purchases.

40|$|The {{researches}} {{were aimed}} at assessing the elastic properties of material with pre-existing corrosion damage. Corrosion {{in the form of}} pitting in certain classes of aluminum alloys, e. g. 7075 -T 6, is considered here. Based on the characteristics of corrosion metrics and micromechanics, the paper describes a mechanical property prediction procedure for corroded aluminum alloy. The model was developed in the framework of micro-mechanics, in combination with the existing corroded coupon tensile test results. The existing data included the weight loss rates of 7075 -T 6 sheet exposed to acid salt spray (fog) for various time periods. Tensile tests were taken for corroded 'dog bone' <b>coupons.</b> The <b>paper</b> describes the test procedures and mechanical test results.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{consists of}} two essays. The first essay is a theoretical study of a dynamic game played between the consumers and a monopolistic seller who can use checkout <b>coupons.</b> The <b>paper</b> shows how checkout coupons can increase the profit of a monopolist, when both the seller and the consumers have private information. Double-sided uncertainty {{is necessary for the}} profitability of checkout coupons, but does not guarantee it. Increase in profit comes at a loss of efficiency: the quantity sold decreases. The second essay is an empirical study of the causes and consequences of current trends in the market for passenger vehicles. During the last 30 years, light trucks have become an increasingly popular substitute for a passenger car. The sales and the share of light trucks in the US vehicle fleet has been increasing. We use accident data to show that light trucks are safer than cars, and that the safety advantage increases with their share in the vehicle fleet. We show that this may be the force that drives the popularity of light trucks. Unfortunately, light trucks impose a significant safety externality on other road users. This external cost is greater than the safety benefit to light truck occupants. We estimate that 2086 fatalities could be avoided during the year 1999 if the share of light trucks was lowered to the level that prevailed in the year 1970...|$|R

40|$|From {{a credit}} risk perspective, {{little is known}} about the {{distress}} factors [...] economy-wide or firm-specific [...] that are important in explaining variations in defaultable <b>coupon</b> yields. This <b>paper</b> proposes and empirically tests a family of credit risk models. Empirically, we find that firm-specific distress factors play a role (beyond treasuries) in explaining defaultable coupon bond yields. Credit risk models that take into consideration leverage and book-to-market are found to reduce out-of-sample yield fitting errors (for the majority of firms). Moreover, the empirical evidence suggests that interest rate risk may be of first-order prominence for pricing and hedging. Measured by both out-of-sample pricing and hedging errors, the credit risk models perform relatively better for high grade bonds. Controlling for credit rating, the model performance is generally superior for longer maturity bonds compared to its shorter maturity counterparts. Using equity as an instrument reduces hedging errors. This paper provides an empirical investigation of credit risk models using observable economic factors. Credit; Risk; Econometric models...|$|R

In aircraft structural design, failure stress is first obtained from coupon tests, which is then used in predicting failure stress of structural element under combined loads.

This <b>paper</b> focuses on identifying the effect of the number of coupon and element tests on the distribution of failure stress of structural element. This paper assumes isotropic properties and the failure stress of structural element is assumed to be predicted by a failure theory (e. g.

Bayesian updating is used to reduce the uncertainties in the initial failure stress distribution by using element tests. The relation between the number of tests and the level of uncertainties is presented for a simple test case. I...|$|R
