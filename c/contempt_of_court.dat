Instead of holding Lincoln in <b>contempt</b> <b>of</b> <b>court</b> as was expected, the judge, a Democrat, reversed his ruling, allowing the evidence and acquitting Harrison.|$|E

Since the <b>Contempt</b> <b>of</b> <b>courts</b> Act 1971, didn't allow the contempt against judiciary and judgement, Mannan issued an apology stating that [...] "I further undertake not to write anything against, the Madras High Court judge in my journal Sigappu Nada in future". Within ten days of this apology he published an article in Sigappu Nada that showed the hollowness of his apology. In that he mentioned the direction given by the court, the wild allegation of corruption in the judiciary and his willingness to prove corruption charges. He stated [...] "Kalai Mannan {{is ready to go}} to Jail".|$|R

5|$|While {{the first}} trial was under way, events outside the {{courtroom}} influenced public perception of communism: the Soviet Union tested its first nuclear weapon, and communists prevailed in the Chinese Civil War. Public opinion was overwhelmingly against the defendants. After a 10 month trial the jury found all 11 defendants guilty and the judge sentenced them to terms of {{up to five years}} in federal prison, further sentencing all five defense attorneys to imprisonment for <b>contempt</b> <b>of</b> <b>court.</b> Two of the attorneys were subsequently disbarred.|$|E

5|$|Following the mistrial in Boston, the {{prosecution}} moved {{to schedule a}} new trial. LaRouche and the other defendants appealed that effort on October 5, 1988, saying that a new trial would create double jeopardy. The appeal was denied four months later. The <b>contempt</b> <b>of</b> <b>court</b> fines were appealed again on January 9, 1989, and affirmed again on March 29. Following the convictions in the Alexandria court, prosecutors moved to dismiss the charges from the Boston court, canceling the retrial. The LaRouche lawyers appealed that decision on March 13, 1989, arguing that they needed the trial to exonerate LaRouche.|$|E

President Grover Cleveland, who Debs had supported in all three of his presidential campaigns, sent the United States Army to enforce the injunction. The entrance of the Army was enough to break the strike. Overall, 30 strikers were killed in the strike, 13 of them in Chicago, and thousands were blacklisted. An estimated $80 million worth of property was damaged, and Debs was found guilty of <b>contempt</b> <b>of</b> <b>court</b> for violating the injunction and sent to federal prison.|$|E

Sneed was charged with <b>contempt</b> <b>of</b> <b>court</b> and fined for refusing {{to turn over the}} records.

However, Appleby dismissed the second-degree murder of Zayd Shakur, as the New Jersey Supreme Court had recently narrowed {{the application of the}} law. Appleby finally sentenced Shakur to 30days in the Middlesex County Workhouse for <b>contempt</b> <b>of</b> <b>court,</b> concurrent with the other sentences, for refusing to rise when he entered the courtroom.

The campaign drew in some high-level supporters, among whom was George Hammond Whalley, a controversial anti-Catholic who was MP for Peterborough. He and Onslow were sometimes incautious in their speeches; after a meeting in St James's Hall, London, on 11 December 1872, each made specific charges against the Attorney General and the Government of trying to pervert the course of justice.
