40|$|AbstractTitanium alloy is {{frequently}} used in aerospace {{applications such as}} load carrying airframe due to their excellent mechanical and corrosion properties in combination with being comparatively light weight. However, it is well-known that titanium alloy is difficult to form at room temperature. So hot stretch bending and <b>creep</b> <b>forming</b> process is used to improve formability and reduce springback in forming titanium alloy profile. The principle of hot stretch bending and <b>creep</b> <b>forming</b> is leading a stress relaxation stage by maintaining the workpiece against the die for a selected dwell time after hot stretch bending stage. This allows the benefits of low residual stress and minimum springback including inexpensive tooling and good repeatability. In the present work, a set of uniaxial tension tests was performed on OT 4 titanium alloy at the temperature ranging from 773 K to 973 K and strain rate from 0. 0025 s- 1 to 0. 01 s- 1. Stress relaxation tests were carried out at the temperature range from 773 K to 973 K. Arrhenius model was employed to characterize the creep behaviour. Finite element model of hot stretch bending and <b>creep</b> <b>forming</b> process was created in ABAQUS. The results of FE simulation indicate that residual stress decreases greatly in stress relaxation stage and low residual stress lead smaller springback. The predicted springback show promising agreement with the corresponding experimental observations...|$|E

CAF is a combined age-hardening and stress-relaxation that are responsible for strengthening and forming, respectively. This paper deals with the experimental investigations of mechanical and springback properties of Al-Zn-Mg Al alloy in <b>creep</b> <b>forming</b> process. <b>Creep</b> <b>forming</b> experiments have been performed at temperatures of 120 ◦C and 180 ◦C for 6 – 72 h. Results indicated that yield stress and hardness of creep age formed specimens increased with increasing forming time and temperature,  simultaneously induced deflection by stress-relaxation increased. Incorporating spring back and mechanical properties, it can be found that the appropriate forming cycle was 180 ◦C/ 24 h among all forming conditions. CAF Time increase to a certain extent increased mechanical properties. This can be attributed to presence of stress in CAF that causes the precipitates be finer because of creation more nucleation sites. Therefor the growth of precipitates, takes place at long time and postpones the decreasing of the yield stres...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Creep age forming (CAF) is a {{combined}} <b>creep</b> <b>forming</b> and age hardening treatment pro-cess. How {{to control the}} springback after forming {{is one of the}} key problems for the process. In this paper, Creep tests were conducted for different stress levels at 160 ℃ for 25 h, which is the suitable parameters for CAF process of aluminum alloy 7050 T 451. Based on experimental results, a set of mechanism-based creep constitutive equations was formulated. The six material constants of the constitutive equations were determined by non-linear least squares fitting methods. The creep age forming process for aluminum alloy 7050 T 451 plate was simulated by using FE software ABAQUS through the subroutine CREEP. The effects of the forming parameters on the springback were ana-lyzed. Finally, experimental research was performed. It is found that the developed numerical simu-lation can be used to simulate the whole process of creep age forming process. The maximum rela-tive error is 6. 9 %...|$|E

40|$|Geomorphic {{features}} such as drifts, sediment waves and channels have been documented in the Upper Cretaceous of north-west Europe. These features are interpreted to result from bottom currents and {{have been used to}} refine chalk depositional models and quantify palaeocirculation patterns. Chalk was first deposited as calcareous nannofossil ooze and geomorphic features are the result of sediment reworking after deposition. There is limited knowledge on the processes that govern nannofossil ooze mobility, thus forcing uncertainty onto numerical models based on sedimentological observations. This article provides an extensive view of the erosional and depositional behaviour of calcareous nannofossil ooze based on experimental work using annular flumes. A fundamental observation of this study is the significant decrease of nannofossil ooze mobility with decreasing bed porosity. Erosion characteristics, labelled as erosion types, vary with total bed porosity (?) and applied shear stress (? 0). High-porosity ooze (? > 80 %) is characterized by constant erosion rates (Em). At ? < 77 %, however, erosion characteristics showed greater variance. Surface erosion was typically followed by transitional erosion (with asymptotically decreasing Em), and stages of erosion with constant, and exponential erosion rates. The estimated erosion thresholds (?c) vary from ca 0 · 05 to 0 · 08 Pa for the onset of surface erosion and up to ca 0 · 19 Pa for the onset of constant erosion (? of 60 to 85 %). Variability of deposition thresholds (?cd) from ca 0 · 04 to 0 · 13 Pa reflects the influence of variable suspended sediment concentration and ? 0 on settling particle size due to the identified potential for chalk ooze aggregation and flocculation. Additionally, deposition thresholds seem to be affected by the size of eroded aggregates whose size correlates with bed porosity. Lastly, slow sediment transport without resuspension occurred in high-porosity ooze as surface <b>creep,</b> <b>forming</b> low-relief sedimentary features resembling ripples. This process represents a previously undescribed mode of fine-grained nannofossil ooze transport...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{describes}} {{the manufacturing process}} for wide chord fan blades (WCFB) and how the production of die sets used for their manufacture can be substantially improved using reverse engineering. Super plastic formed WCFBs are manufactured by diffusion bonding five separate blade pieces under high pressure. The blade is then hot creep formed into the required shape, using pressure to force the blade against the die walls to yield the desired form, blade twist and the honeycomb centre required. Two die sets are required, one for the hot <b>creep</b> <b>forming</b> of the blade billet and the second for the super plastic blade forming process. Their manufacture requires three solid models to be generated from a bespoke ‘Fan Key System’. This calculates the die set geometry required for both hot and cold states. The three solid models comprise the casting model geometry which incorporates the draw angle and shrinkage allowance, the pattern model for {{the top and bottom}} die sets and a die set model used to define the NC part programs for the five axis finish machining process. The machining process has three elements, pre-machining sometimes termed water line or terrace machining, semi-finish and finish machining. Distortion caused by rate of cooling, graphite precipitation and mould dilation cause massive amounts of metal removal in the waterline machining process which can take up to 35 h and is a non-value added process. It often leaves the die wall thin with the resulting effect on performance and life. A reverse engineering solution was used to improve the geometry of the castings by predicting die distortion more accurately. Point cloud models of nine casting sets were imported into reverse engineering software, ‘Surfacer’ which made possible a comparison with the surface geometry representation required. The resulting design information enabled more accurate die set design. Waterline machining had been substantially reduced and die life has been extende...|$|E

40|$|Cold rolled {{thin strip}} {{has a wide}} {{application}} in electronic and instrument industries, and its production has always been of major interest to the manufacturers and researchers {{in the area of}} metal plasticity. Thin strip rolling involves significant metal plasticity to produce a desired product. Iwamoto (2004), Stoughton 2 ̆ 6 Yoon (2004) and Hub et al. (2004) were interested in dealing with the plastic defonnation and plastic yielding of steel, and its micromechanics. With the need for higher quality and productivity in cold strip mill, mathematical models of cold rolling of a strip with a desired shape and dimension, both for mill set-up and for on-line control, have become a key issue in the steel rolling process. One major part of these models concerns the strip and roll def 0 :mation, plastically. efor ed strip shape and profile. The development of the roll deformation model can be diVided mto three groups, which includes simple beam model, slit beam model and finit element analysis model (Ginzburg, 1989). Stone 2 ̆ 6 Gray (1965) modelled the roll deformation as the deflection of a simple beam on an elastic foundation. Shohet 2 ̆ 6 Townsend (1968) proposed a slit beam deflection model, and then Edwards 2 ̆ 6 Spooner (1973), Wang (1986) improved this theory and introduced a matrix method to solve the beam deflection considering strip plastic deformation. It has now been widely used in analysiS of the roll deformation an strip shape and profile. Timoshenko 2 ̆ 6 Goodier (1970), Jiang et al. (2 oo 3 a, b, c), Koman (1998) and Lin 2 ̆ 6 Lee (1997) used finite elem. ent model and numerical methods to analyse the strip rolling and to improve the simulation accuracy of the strip shape and profile. In order {{to improve the quality of}} the produced products, Kim 2 ̆ 6 Oh (2003) used finite element method to analyse grain by-grain deformation by crystal plasticity with couple stress, Simth et al. (2003) conducted a study of the effect of the transverse normal stress on sheet metal formability and Ho et al. (2004) developed integrated numerical techniques to predict springback in <b>creep</b> <b>forming</b> thick aluminum sheet components. Buchheit et a!. (2005) performed simulations of realistic looking 3 -. 0 polycrystalline microstructures generated. The simulation on precipitate induced hardening in crystal plasticity was conducted (Han et aI., 2004). Martin 2 ̆ 6 Smith (2005) investigated the influence of the compressive throughthickness normal stress on sheet metal formability and tried to explore the ways to improve the sheet metal formability. However, the finite element analysis is rather complicated and may have a convergence problem, which is difficult to be used for on-line control of the thin strip rolling. An influence function method analysis considering the strip plastic deformation and roll deformation can be directly used in the control of strip rolling, especially in the control of the shape and profile of strip...|$|E
