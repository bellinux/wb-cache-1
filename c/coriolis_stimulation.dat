40|$|The {{effect of}} gravity on the {{severity}} of the Coriolis-induced motion sickness was investigated in ten individuals subjected to high and low G-force phases of parabolic flight maneuvers using constant level Coriolis, cross-coupled angular acceleration stimulation. Using seven levels of severity in the diagnosis of motion sickness, {{it was found that the}} subjects were less susceptible at 0 G than at + 2 Gz, and that the perceived intensity and provocativeness of <b>Coriolis</b> <b>stimulation</b> decreased in 0 G and increased in + 2 Gz relative to the + 1 Gz baseline values. The changes in the apparent intensity of <b>Coriolis</b> <b>stimulation</b> occur virtually immediately when the background gravitatioinertial force level is varied. These findings explain why the Skylab astronauts were refractory to motion sickness during <b>Coriolis</b> <b>stimulation</b> in-flight...|$|E
40|$|Motion {{sickness}} {{research shows}} {{a lack of}} agreement regarding {{the contribution of the}} autonomic nervous system (ANS). The resolution of this question is exigent for Space Adaptation Syndrome, zero gravity sickness. A case is drawn for the necessity to apply a methodological approach that incorporates: (1) standardization of parameters in relation to the individual differences in variability and prestimulus levels; (2) a concern for patterning of responses; and (3) the physiological association with subjective reports. Vasomotor, heart rate, respiration rate, skin conductance and subjective reports of malaise were collected from 22 subjects while participating in three motion stressors; vertical acceleration, <b>Coriolis</b> <b>stimulation,</b> and combined optokinetic and <b>Coriolis</b> <b>stimulation.</b> The results demonstrate that ANS response patterns can be separated into three mutually exclusive components: (1) a generalized response to motion sickness; (2) a stimulus specific response to the type of stressor being presented; and (3) individualized stereotypical response patterns that are associated with subjective reports of malaise...|$|E
40|$|The {{rotating}} chair test, a novel research {{technique for}} simulating motion sickness, {{is used to}} study the effect of nonsedating oral antihistamines in preventing or forestalling motion sickness. After receiving terfenadine, astemizole, doxepin, or placebo, four groups of male volunteers were rotated at accelerating speed, and they made head movements out of the axis of rotation until they perceived that vomiting would occur if additional head movements were made. Those pretreated with doxepin or terfenadine experienced a statistically significant prophylactic effect, as measured by increased tolerance to <b>Coriolis</b> <b>stimulation.</b> This suggests that selective peripheral H 1 antihistamine action may protect against motion sickness...|$|E
40|$|The goal of {{the present}} {{experiment}} {{was to determine whether}} gravitoinertial force magnitude influences oculomotor and perceptual responses to <b>Coriolis</b> cross-coupling <b>stimulation.</b> Blindfolded subjects who were rotating at constant velocity were asked to make standardized head movements during the free-fall and high-force phases of parabolic flight, and the characteristics of their horizontal nystagmus and the magnitude of their experienced self-motion were measured. Both responses were less intense in the free-fall periods than in the high-force periods. These findings suggest that the response to semicircular canal stimulation depends on the background level of gravitoinertial force...|$|R
40|$|The {{goal of this}} {{investigation}} was to determine whether the vestibular response to vertical, z-axis body rotation in the dark is influenced by the magnitude of gravitoinertial force. The parameters measured were the nystagmus and the duration of illusory self-motion elicited in blindfolded subjects by cessation of such rotation during the free-fall, high, and terrestrial force phases of parabolic flight maneuvers. The pattern of findings is consistent with the responses that were observed earlier to constant levels of <b>Coriolis</b> cross-coupled <b>stimulation</b> during parabolic flight maneuvers both in terms of the mode of nystagmus suppression and the effect of G-level...|$|R

40|$|This study {{evaluated}} {{the efficacy of}} pharmacological doses of phosphatidylcholine (lecithin) in the modulation of motion sickness induced by exposure to <b>coriolis</b> <b>stimulation</b> in a rotating chair. Subjects received daily dietary supplements of 25 grams of lecithin (90 percent phosphatidylcholine) and were tested for their susceptibility to motion sickness after 4 h, 2 d, and 21 d. A small but statistically significant increase in susceptibility (+ 15 percent) was noted 4 h after supplemental phosphatidylcholine, with four of nine subjects demonstrating a marked increase in susceptibility. This finding was attributed to choline's stimulatory action on cholinergic systems, an action which opposes that of the classical antimotion sickness drug scopolamine. Chronic lecithin loading revealed a trend towards reduced susceptibility, possibly indicating the occurrence of adaptive mechanisms such as receptor down-regulation. Withdrawal from lecithin loading, perhaps coupled with anticholinergic treatment, might {{prove to be a}} potent prophylactic regimen and ought to be tested...|$|E
40|$|This study {{evaluated}} {{the time course of}} efficacy of transdermal scopolamine {{in the prevention}} of motion sickness induced by exposure to <b>coriolis</b> <b>stimulation</b> in a rotating chair. We measured levels of efficacy, quantified side effects and symptoms, and determined inter- and intra-subject variability following use of transdermal scopolamine. The response to transdermal scopolamine was highly variable, although overall we recorded a 40 percent improvement in test scores 16 - 72 h after application of the transdermal system. This variability could not be explained solely by the levels of scopolamine present in the blood. The improvement was not due to the artifactual repression by scopolamine of selected symptoms of motion sickness. An unexpectedly high incidence of side effects was reported. It was concluded that the therapeutic use of transdermal scopolamine be evaluated individually and that individuals be cautioned that subsequent usage may not always be effective...|$|E
40|$|Sympathomimetic {{agents are}} {{frequent}} components in antimotion-sickness drug combinations {{because of their}} usefulness in counteracting the sedation caused by stressful motion or resulting from the administration of other antimotion-sickness drugs. The noradrenergic neurochemistry of the brain's arousal-attentional systems prompted us to evaluate the efficacy of five new sympathomimetic drugs and to further define the role of arousal in susceptibility to motion. Subjects were orally administered methamphetamine (20 mg), phenmetrazine (25 mg), phentermine (37. 5 mg), methylphenidate (20 mg), or pemoline (75 mg) 2 h prior to taking a Staircase Profile Test. All of the drugs increased resistance to stressful <b>coriolis</b> <b>stimulation</b> by 80 - 120 percent. Methylphenidate and pemoline showed fewer side effects. These findings, interpreted {{in conjunction with the}} documented inefficacy of most anticholinergic and antihistaminergic drugs tested to date, suggest that sympathomimetic drugs or a generalized state of arosusal can inhibit the development of motion sickness...|$|E
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release, {{distribution}} unlimitedThe use of centrifuges in training aircrew to avoid GLOC is increasing. The {{purpose of this}} study was to record the vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) and subjective sensations to gain insight into reports of asymmetrical disorientation and disturbance during acceleration and deceleration of GLOC training centrifuges. Horizontal and vertical eye movements and post run sensations were recorded from 15 naive male human subjects seated head erect in a 20. 5 -ft radius pendulous chair centrifuge. Centrifuge profile was acceleration from 1 to 3 Gz in 19 s, 5 min of sustained 3 Gz, and deceleration to 1 Gz in 19 s. Tests were repeated up to three times with the subject facing the motion, and three times with the subject's back to the motion. Eye position was recorded in the dark using an ISCAN infrared video system. Six subjects experienced GLOC, and 1 withdrew due to unrelated sickness. Slow phase velocity (SPV) and sensations from the 8 subjects who completed all 6 runs were analyzed. Roll of the chair during acceleration and deceleration produced strong pitch, roll, and yaw sensations and eye movements attributable to vestibular <b>Coriolis</b> <b>stimulation.</b> Subjective pitch amplitude change was consistently greater during deceleration than acceleration, regardless of rotation direction. The SPV magnitude during the first run in a given direction was significantly different than the two subsequent runs. A sustained upbeating ('Lz') nystagmus (1 - 21 deg/ s, mean 8 deg/s at 100 s; 1 - 12 deg/s at 315 s) was observed in 7 of 8 subjects. VOR during centrifugation is composed of interacting transient angular and sustained linear VOR components. Sensation asymmetries are not observed in the VOR. Lz nystagmus magnitude is an individual subject characteristic. Centrifuge, Vestibulo-ocular, Lz nystagmus, Spatial OrientationN...|$|E
