The nucleotide sequences of the ptsI gene, which encodes enzyme I (EC 2. 7. 3. 9), and the <b>corresponding</b> <b>flanking</b> regions were determined. The primary translation product, derived from the nucleotide sequence, consists of 574 amino acids and has a calculated molecular weight of 63, 369.

40|$|One {{of the key}} {{challenges}} in computational genomics is annotating coding genes and identification of regulatory RNAs in complete genomes. An attempt is made in this study which uses the regulatory RNA locations and their conserved flanking genes identified within the genomic backbone of template genome to search for similar RNA locations in query genomes. The search is based on recently reported coexistence of small RNAs and their conserved flanking genes in related genomes. Based on our study, 54 additional sRNA locations and functions of 96 uncharacterized genes are predicted in two draft genomes viz., Serratia marcesens Db 1 and Yersinia enterocolitica 8081. Although most of the identified additional small RNA regions and their <b>corresponding</b> <b>flanking</b> genes are homologous in nature, the proposed anchoring technique could successfully identify four non-homologous small RNA regions in Y. enterocolitica genome also. The KEGG Orthology (KO) based automated functional predictions confirms the predicted functions of 65 flanking genes having defined KO numbers, out of the total 96 predictions made by this method. This coexistence based method shows more sensitivity than controlled vocabularies in locating orthologous gene pairs {{even in the absence}} of defined Orthology numbers. All functional predictions made by this study in Y. enterocolitica 8081 were confirmed by the recently published complete genome sequence and annotations. This study also reports the possible regions of gene rearrangements in these two genomes and further characterization of such RNA regions could shed more light on their possible role in genome evolution...|$|R
40|$|Background: The role of {{long non-coding}} RNAs (lncRNAs) in {{controlling}} gene expression has garnered {{increased interest in}} recent years. Sequencing projects, such as Fantom 3 for mouse and H-InvDB for human, have generated abundant data on transcribed components of mammalian cells, the majority of which appear not to be protein-coding. However, much of the non-protein-coding transcriptome could merely be a consequence of ‘transcription noise’. It is therefore essential to use bioinformatic approaches to identify the likely functional candidates in a high throughput manner. Principal Findings: We derived a scheme for classifying and annotating likely functional lncRNAs in mammals. Using the available experimental full-length cDNA data sets for human and mouse, we identified 78 lncRNAs that are either syntenically conserved between human and mouse, or that originate from the same protein-coding genes. Of these, 11 have significant sequence homology. We found that these lncRNAs exhibit: (i) patterns of codon substitution typical of noncoding transcripts; (ii) preservation of sequences in distant mammals such as dog and cow, (iii) significant sequence conservation relative to their <b>corresponding</b> <b>flanking</b> regions (in 50 % cases, flanking regions do not have homology at all; and in the remaining, the degree of conservation is significantly less); (iv) existence mostly as single-exon forms (8 / 11); and, (v) presence of conserved and stable secondary structure motifs within them. We further identified orthologous proteincoding genes that are contributing to the pool of lncRNAs; of which, genes implicated in carcinogenesis are significantl...|$|R
40|$|The {{androgen}} receptor (AR) {{is a member}} of the nuclear receptor superfamily, and is important for both male and female reproductive health. The receptor is a target for a number of post-translational modifications including phosphorylation, which has been intensively studied in vitro. However, little is known about the phosphorylation status of the receptor in target tissues in vivo. The common marmoset is a useful model for studying human reproductive functions, and comparison of the AR primary sequence from this primate shows high conservation of serines known to be phosphorylated in the human receptor and <b>corresponding</b> <b>flanking</b> amino acids. We have used a panel of phosphospecific antibodies to study AR phosphorylation in the marmoset ovary throughout the follicular phase and after treatment with GNRH antagonist or testosterone propionate. In normal follicular phase ovaries, total AR (both phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated forms) immunopositive staining was observed in several cell types including granulosa cells of developing follicles, theca cells and endothelial cells lining blood vessels. Receptor phosphorylation at serines 81, 308, and 650 was detected primarily in the granulosa cells of developing follicles, surface epithelium, and vessel endothelial cells. Testosterone treatment lead to a modest increase in AR staining in all stages of follicle studied, while GNRH antagonist had no effect. Neither treatment significantly altered the pattern of phosphorylation compared to the control group. These results demonstrate that phosphorylation of the AR occurs, at a subset of serine residues, in a reproductive target tissue in vivo, which appears refractory to hormonal manipulations.

40|$|Members of {{a family}} of repeat-containing surface {{proteins}} of group B streptococci (GBS) defined by the alpha C and Rib proteins exhibit size variability and cross-reactivity and have been studied as potential vaccine components. We report evidence of horizontal DNA transfer with subsequent recombination as a mechanism generating diversity within this antigen family. Alp 2 and Alp 3 are additional members of the alpha C protein family identified in strains of the emerging GBS serotypes V and VIII. Each contains an overall genetic organization highly {{similar to that of the}} alpha C and Rib proteins, including a tandem repeat region and conserved N- and C-terminal regions. Among different strains, protein size varies according to the number of tandem repeats within the corresponding gene. Unlike the alpha C and Rib proteins, however, the newly described alpha-like proteins contain other regions, including one similar to the IgA-binding region of the GBS beta C protein, a nontandem repeat region, and an isolated repeat highly homologous to the alpha C repeat. Sequence analysis of the regions flanking the alpha C protein gene on a 13. 7 -kb insert reveals several ORFs that are likely to be involved in basic metabolic pathways. Analysis of <b>corresponding</b> <b>flanking</b> regions in other GBS strains, including the parent strains of the newly described alpha-like proteins, shows striking conservation among all strains studied. These findings indicate that the alpha-like proteins are encoded by mosaic variants at a single genomic locus and suggest that recombination after horizontal DNA transfer is a means of generating diversity within this protein family...|$|R

40|$|The neural cell {{adhesion}} molecule L 1 {{has been shown to}} function as a homophilic ligand in a variety of dynamic neurological processes. Here we demonstrate that the sixth immunoglobulin-like domain of human L 1 (L 1 -Ig 6) can function as a heterophilic ligand for multiple members of the integrin superfamily including αvβ 3, αvβ 1, α 5 β 1, and αIIbβ 3. The interaction between L 1 -Ig 6 and αIIbβ 3 was found to support the rapid attachment of activated human platelets, whereas a corresponding interaction with αvβ 3 and αvβ 1 supported the adhesion of umbilical vein endothelial cells. Mutation of the single Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) motif in human L 1 -Ig 6 effectively abrogated binding by the aforementioned integrins. A L 1 peptide containing this RGD motif and <b>corresponding</b> <b>flanking</b> amino acids (PSITWRGDGRDLQEL) effectively blocked L 1 integrin interactions and, as an immobilized ligand, supported adhesion via αvβ 3, αvβ 1, α 5 β 1, and αIIbβ 3. Whereas β 3 integrin binding to L 1 -Ig 6 was evident in the presence of either Ca 2 +, Mg 2 +, or Mn 2 +, a corresponding interaction with the β 1 integrins was only observed in the presence of Mn 2 +. Furthermore, such Mn 2 +-dependent binding by α 5 β 1 and αvβ 1 was significantly inhibited by exogenous Ca 2 +. Our findings suggest that physiological levels of calcium will impose a hierarchy of integrin binding to L 1 such that αvβ 3 or active αIIbβ 3 > αvβ 1 > α 5 β 1. Given that L 1 can interact with multiple vascular or platelet integrins it is significant that we also present evidence for de novo L 1 expression on blood vessels associated with certain neoplastic or inflammatory diseases.

40|$|For DNA barcoding {{to succeed}} as a {{scientific}} endeavor an accurate and expeditious query sequence identification method is needed. Although a global multiple-sequence alignment can be generated for some barcoding markers (e. g. COI, rbcL), not all barcoding markers are as structurally conserved (e. g. matK). Thus, algorithms that depend on global multiple-sequence alignments are not universally applicable. Some sequence identification methods that use local pairwise alignments (e. g. BLAST) are unable to accurately differentiate between highly similar sequences and are not designed to cope with hierarchic phylogenetic relationships or within taxon variability. Here, I present a novel alignment-free sequence identification algorithm [...] BRONX [...] that accounts for observed within taxon variability and hierarchic relationships among taxa. BRONX identifies short variable segments and <b>corresponding</b> invariant <b>flanking</b> regions in reference sequences. These flanking regions are used to score variable regions in the query sequence without {{the production of a}} global multiple-sequence alignment. By incorporating observed within taxon variability into the scoring procedure, misidentifications arising from shared alleles/haplotypes are minimized. An explicit treatment of more inclusive terminals allows for separate identifications to be made for each taxonomic level and/or for user-defined terminals. BRONX performs better than all other methods when there is imperfect overlap between query and reference sequences (e. g. mini-barcode queries against a full-length barcode database). BRONX consistently produced better identifications at the genus-level for all query types...|$|R

40|$|Background Bambara {{groundnut}} [Vigna subterranea (L) Verdc. ] is {{an indigenous}} legume crop grown mainly in subsistence and small-scale agriculture in sub-Saharan Africa for its nutritious seeds and its {{tolerance to drought}} and poor soils. Given {{that the lack of}} ex ante sequence is often a bottleneck in marker-assisted crop breeding for minor and underutilised crops, we demonstrate the use of limited genetic information and resources developed within species, but linked to the well characterised common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris) genome sequence and the partially annotated closely related species; adzuki bean (Vigna angularis) and mung bean (Vigna radiata). From these comparisons we identify conserved synteny blocks corresponding to the Linkage Groups (LGs) in bambara groundnut genetic maps and evaluate the potential to identify genes in conserved syntenic locations in a sequenced genome that underlie a QTL position in the underutilised crop genome. Results Two individual intraspecific linkage maps consisting of DArTseq markers were constructed in two bambara groundnut (2 n[*]=[*] 2 x[*]=[*] 22) segregating populations: 1) The genetic map of Population IA was derived from F 2 lines (n[*]=[*] 263; IITA 686 x Ankpa 4) and covered 1, 395. 2 cM across 11 linkage groups; 2) The genetic map of Population TD was derived from F 3 lines (n[*]=[*] 71; Tiga Nicuru x DipC) and covered 1, 376. 7 cM across 11 linkage groups. A total of 96 DArTseq markers from an initial pool of 142 pre-selected common markers were used. These were not only polymorphic in both populations but also each marker could be located using the unique sequence tag (at selected stringency) onto the common bean, adzuki bean and mung bean genomes, thus allowing the sequenced genomes to be used as an initial ‘pseudo’ physical map for bambara groundnut. A good correspondence was observed at the macro synteny level, particularly to the common bean genome. A test using the QTL location of an agronomic trait in one of the bambara groundnut maps allowed the <b>corresponding</b> <b>flanking</b> positions to be identified in common bean, mung bean and adzuki bean, demonstrating the possibility of identifying potential candidate genes underlying traits of interest through the conserved syntenic physical location of QTL in the well annotated genomes of closely related species. Conclusions The approach of adding pre-selected common markers in both populations before genetic map construction has provided a translational framework for potential identification of candidate genes underlying a QTL of trait of interest in bambara groundnut by linking the positions of known genetic effects within the underutilised species to the physical maps of other well-annotated legume species, without the need for an existing whole genome sequence of the study species. Identifying the conserved synteny between underutilised species without complete genome sequences and the genomes of major crops and model species with genetic and trait data is an important step in the translation of resources and information from major crop and model species into the minor crop species. Such minor crops will be required {{to play an important role}} in future agriculture under the effects of climate change...|$|R

The objective {{of this study was to}} search for novel disease-associated mutations in the two human titin-binding proteins myopalladin and its amino-terminal-interacting partner cardiac ankyrin-repeat protein (CARP). In a cohort of 255 cases with familial and sporadic DCM, we analyzed the coding regions and all <b>corresponding</b> intron <b>flanks</b> located in the MYPN and CARP-encoding ANKRD 1 gene. Two heterozygous missense mutations were detected in the MYPN gene (p. R 955 W and p. P 961 L), but neither of these mutations was found in 300 healthy controls. Both mutations were located in the alpha-actinin-binding region of myopalladin. Endomyocardial biopsies from the p. R 955 W carrier showed normal subcellular localization of myopalladin and alpha-actinin in cardiac myocytes, while their regular sarcomeric staining pattern was significantly disrupted in the p. P 961 L carrier, indicating that disturbed myofibrillogenesis and altered sarcomere assembly are the cause of the disease. In the ANKRD 1 gene, we identified synonymous base exchanges (c. 108 T>C and c. - 79 C>T, respectively), but no non-synonymous mutations. In summary, we have identified novel missense mutations in the third immunoglobulin-like domain of myopalladin, which have either no or profound effects on the molecular composition of the sarcomere.

To evaluate factors influencing puma occupancy we used data from 5 sampling campaigns in 3 consecutive years (2005 to 2007) and 2 seasons (wet and dry), at a state park and a private forest reserve. We estimated puma numbers and density for the 2007 sampling data by developing a standardized individual identification method.

Following individual identification we established a capture–recapture history and analyzed it using closed population capture–mark–recapture models. Puma capture probability was influenced by camera placement (roads vs. trails), sampling year, and prey richness.

This is particularly {{visible in the}} epitaxial silicon layer because the current signal in the wafer p++ region is below the detection level of the instrument so we can {{consider that it is}} equal to zero. The causes of degradation may again come from both the measurement process and/or a degradation of the sample. First, as above, there might be an abrasion of the tip coating and also a drift of the AFM laser on the photodetector during measurements. In fact, this can affect sensibly the force applied by the tip on the surface because a cantilever with strong spring constant (48  N/m) was used. Secondly, the degradation of the sample surface can come both from the indentation phenomena which was shown in Fig.  1 and from tip-induced oxidation during the scans. This phenomenon has been discussed by Vetushka et al. [22]. It should be noted that close {{to the edge of the}} sample, the values of current seem to be repeatable. This is due to two reasons: first, the area of contact <b>corresponds</b> to the <b>flank</b> of the tip which is larger and probably less degraded during the scans. Second, this region locally undergoes much less pressure than the flat region. Therefore, it is less degraded and the tip-induced oxidation is probably lower.|$|R

In contrast to soluble scruin, in the acrosomal process, C 837 is completely unreactive while the other cysteines become less reactive. Binding studies of chemically modified scruin correlate the extent of modification at C 837 with the extent of inhibition of actin binding.

Biol. 12 : 157 - 167, 2011. -Living at {{high altitude}} is demanding and thus drives adaptational mechanisms. The Tibetan population {{has had a}} longer evolutionary period to adapt to high altitude than other mountain populations such as Andeans. As a result, some Tibetans living at high altitudes do not show markedly elevated red blood cell production as compared to South American high altitude natives such as Quechuas or Aymaras, thereby avoiding high blood viscosity creating cardiovascular risk. Unexpectedly, the responsible mutation(s) reducing red blood cell production do not involve either the gene encoding the blood hormone erythropoietin (Epo), or the <b>corresponding</b> regulatory sequences <b>flanking</b> the Epo gene. Similarly, functional mutations in the hypoxia-inducible transcription factor 1 α (HIF- 1 α) gene that represents the oxygen-dependent subunit of the HIF- 1 heterodimer, the latter being the main regulator of over 100 hypoxia-inducible genes, have not been described so far. It was not until very recently that three independent groups showed that the gene encoding HIF- 2 α, EPAS- 1 (Wenger et al. 1997), represents a key gene mutated in Tibetan populations adapted to living at high altitudes (Beall et al. 2010, Yi et al. 2010, Simonson et al. 2010). Hypoxia-inducible transcription factors were first identified by the description of HIF- 1 (Semenza et al. 1991, 1992), which was subsequently found to enhance transcription of multiple genes that encode proteins necessary for rescuing from hypoxic exposure, including erythropoietic, angiogenic and glycolytic proteins. Then HIF- 2 was identified (Ema et al. 1997; Flamme et al. 1997; Hogenesch et al. 1997; and Tian et al. 1997) and although it is highly similar to HIF- 1 and {{has the potential to}} bind (Camenisch et al. 2001) and mediate (Mole et al. 2009) many of the same genes as HIF- 1, its biological actions in response to hypoxia are distinct from those of HIF- 1 (reviewed by Loboda et al. 2010). By now, several of these HIF- 2 mediated processes have been implicated in the human response to high altitude exposure including erythropoiesis (Kapitsinou et al. 2010), iron homeostasis (Peyssonnaux et al. 2008), metabolism (Shohet et al. 2007; Tormos et al. 2010; Biswas et al. 2010; Rankin et al. 2009) and vascular permeability (Chen et al. 2009; Tanaka et al. 2005), among others. Clearly, mutation of EPAS- 1 has the potential to bring far more advantage when adapting to high altitude than solely mutating the Epo gene...|$|R
