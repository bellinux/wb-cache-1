30|$|Plantar <b>calcaneal</b> <b>spurs</b> and calcifications {{within the}} PF are {{uncommon}} occurrences {{in patients with}} plantar fasciitis [19, 20]. The significance of <b>calcaneal</b> <b>spurs</b> {{as a cause of}} plantar fasciitis has received considerable attention in the literature [17 – 20], and currently their importance in terms of the diagnosis and prognosis of plantar fasciitis is debatable. <b>Calcaneal</b> <b>spurs</b> associated with plantar fasciitis include those located within the plantar fascia (Fig.  4) [20]. These are however very uncommon, as the most common site of plantar <b>calcaneal</b> <b>spurs</b> is in the abductor hallucis and flexor digitorum brevis origins, deep below the PF (Figs.  3 and 4) [18, 20]. Thus, evidence of <b>calcaneal</b> <b>spurs</b> on conventional radiographs is not a pathognomonic sign of plantar fasciitis.|$|R

Concomitant osteomyelitic changes in bone morphology can also be detected and mainly include lytic lesions, osteopenia, loss of trabecular architecture, new bone apposition and periosteal thickening (Fig.  8) [40].

50|$|Many {{treatment}} options exist, and good results are often observed. Generally, a <b>calcaneal</b> <b>spur</b> develops when proper {{care is not}} given to the foot and heels.

5000|$|<b>Calcaneal</b> <b>spur</b> (heel spur) {{is a small}} {{calcified bone}} {{extension}} (osteophyte) located on the inferior aspect of the calcaneus or {{on the back of}} the heel at the insertion of the Achilles tendon.

30|$|Several pathologies {{involving}} structures {{other than}} the PF may mimic PF disease and {{should be included in}} the differential diagnosis. Achilles tendinopathy may present with symptoms that are similar to those of plantar fasciitis. This may be related to the close anatomic connection between the PF and the paratenon of the Achilles tendon [5, 75]. Thus, both the Achilles tendon and PF should be carefully evaluated using ultrasound or MRI. Further, if MRI reveals marked bone marrow oedema at the calcaneal origin of the PF in patients with plantar fasciitis, a concomitant enthesopathy of the Achilles tendon should be suspected [4]. The presence of plantar <b>calcaneal</b> <b>spurs</b> should also be assessed. Spur genesis has traditionally been attributed to chronic traction of the PF and repetitive microtrauma, which in turn lead to periostitis and calcification [3]. The role of vertical compression of the heel in spur formation has recently been hypothesised and related to older age, osteoarthritis and obesity [76]. As stated above, <b>calcaneal</b> <b>spurs</b> are not specific for plantar fasciitis and are often identified in asymptomatic individuals; however, a strong association between spurs and chronic plantar heel pain has been demonstrated, specifically in cases of concurrent fat pad abnormalities [77]. Finally, entrapment of the first branch of the lateral plantar nerve (Baxter’s neuropathy) [43], stress fractures of the calcaneus [78], vascular disease [79] and heel fat pad atrophy and necrosis [2] may present with nonspecific heel pain and represent all differential diagnoses of PF disease.|$|R

40|$|Background: Adult {{patients}} with nontraumatic plantar heel pain often present to orthopaedic surgeons for evaluation. A thorough history and physical examination are often sufficient for diagnosis, yet radiographs usually are ordered {{during the initial}} evaluation. The {{purpose of this study}} was to evaluate the value and cost-effectiveness of these radiographs. Methods: A retrospective chart and radiographic review of 157 consecutive adults (215 heels) presenting with nontraumatic heel pain was done to evaluate the utility of routine radiographs in the initial evaluation. Results: The most common diagnosis was plantar fasciitis (80. 9 %, 174 of 215). Radiographs were normal in (17. 2 %, 37 of 215), and incidental radiographic findings were observed in 81. 4 % (175 of 215). The most common incidental findings were plantar <b>calcaneal</b> <b>spurs</b> (59. 5 %, 128 of 215) and Achilles spurs (46. 5 %, 100 of 215). Only (2 %, 4 of 215) of all patients had abnormal findings that prompted further evaluation. Conclusions: Routine radiographs are of limited value in the initial evaluation of nontraumatic plantar heel pain in adults and were not necessary in the initial evaluation.

40|$|Chronic plantar heel pain (CPHP) {{is one of}} {{the most}} common soft tissue {{disorders}} of the foot, yet its aetiology is poorly understood. The purpose of this systematic review was to examine the association between CPHP and the various aetiological factors reported in the literature. Seven electronic databases and the reference lists of key articles were searched in August 2005. The resulting list of articles was assessed by two independent reviewers according to pre-determined selection criteria and a final list of articles for review was created. The methodological quality of the included articles was assessed and the evidence presented in each of the articles was descriptively analysed. From the 16 included articles, body mass index in a non-athletic population and the presence of <b>calcaneal</b> <b>spur</b> were the two factors found to have an association with CPHP. Increased weight in a non athletic population, increased age, decreased ankle dorsiflexion, decreased first metatarsophalangeal joint extension and prolonged standing all demonstrated some evidence of an association with CPHP.

40|$|Purpose: To {{assess the}} {{usefulness}} of weight-bearing examination of the ankle performed with a low-field MRI scanner {{in the evaluation of}} plantar fascia in normal healthy volunteers and in patients with a clinical evidence of plantar fasciitis. Methods and Materials: We retrospectively evaluated ankle MR examinations in two groups of 40 patients each, performed between January and July 2008. Spin echo T 1 W, Gradient echo T 2 W, and Short Tau Inversion Recovery (STIR) images were acquired with a 0. 2 T scanner (G-Scan, Esaote Biomedica, Genoa, Italy) in both weight-bearing position and normal conventional supine position. A dedicated extremities transmitter/receiver coil was used. The lesion site and signal intensity changes were evaluated in consensus by three musculoskeletal experienced radiologists. Results: In all healthy volunteers, a normal appearance of plantar fascia was observed in both conventional supine and in weight-bearing positions. In the latter, an increased stretching of plantar fascia fibers was revealed. In patients with clinical evidence of plantar fasciitis, MRI performed in both positions confirmed the diagnosis in 35 / 40 cases. Only in the weight-bearing position a subtle plantar fascia rupture was also detected in 4 / 40 cases. In 5 / 40 cases the plantar fascia was normal in both positions, and there were other causes of heel pain such as Achilles tendinopathy, <b>calcaneal</b> <b>spur,</b> and calcaneal edema without plantar fascia involvement. Conclusion: Imaging the heel in weight-bearing position with a new developed MRI scanner is useful in demonstrating subtle ruptures of plantar fascia, which can be overlooked when imaging the ankle only in supine position...|$|E
40|$|Background: Heel pain is {{a common}} {{clinical}} condition which significantly affects the quality of life. It is frequently associated with <b>calcaneal</b> <b>spur</b> (CS). Despite its high prevalence, the optimal treatment remains unclear. The aim and objective {{of this study is}} to evaluate the extent of CS in heel pain; correlation of CS with some sociodemographic and health-related factors; and outcome of homoeopathic treatment over a period of 6 months. Methodology: It was a retrospective study done at Dr. Anjali Chatterjee Regional Research Institute for Homoeopathy, Kolkata. Samples were selected from the patients referred for ankle X-ray from August 2014 to July 2015 for nontraumatic heel pain. Their files were traced from outpatient department, and treatment records were reviewed over the next 6 months. Results: Totally 92 patients, 70 women and 22 men, had undergone lateral X-ray of ankle for nontraumatic heel pain, of which 76 (82. 6 %) patients had CS. Extent of CS was found to be higher in case of females, older age, overweight, and profession of housemaid or manual labor. Homoeopathic treatment showed positive response in nearly 75 % of the CS patients. The most useful medicines were Calcarea flouricum, Rhus toxicodendron, Ledum palustre, and Aranea diadema.

40|$|Background: Chronic plantar heel pain is {{a common}} and {{potentially}} debilitating condition, often caused by plantar fasciitis. Plantar calcaneal spurs were originally considered the cause of plantar fasciitis but are now regarded as an incidental finding by most authors. We aimed {{to test this hypothesis}} and to investigate predisposing factors for the development of spurs. Methods: We reviewed all lateral ankle X rays taken in our institution over a 6 -month period and identified all X rays demonstrating calcaneal spurs. Then, we identified a similar number of age- and sex-matched controls without spurs. We contacted both groups by telephone and compared symptoms of heel pain, plantar fasciitis, associated comorbidities, and foot and ankle outcome scores (FAOSs). Results: We reviewed the X rays of 1103 consecutive patients and found a spur prevalence of 12. 4 %, more common in women and older patients. Questioning of the spur group and control group found a higher body mass index in the spur group. Patients with spurs were 4 {{times more likely to have}} diabetes mellitus and 10 times more likely to have lower-limb osteoarthritis. Patients with spurs had more foot pain and poorer FAOS than the control group, even when patients with plantar fasciitis were excluded. Conclusion: Our results demonstrate that the presence of a plantar <b>calcaneal</b> <b>spur</b> may be an indicator of foot pain independent of plantar fasciitis. Although spurs may not cause foot pain themselves, they may be an indication of other associated conditions.

40|$|Abstract Background Plantar calcaneal spurs are common, however their {{pathophysiology}} {{is poorly}} understood. This study aimed {{to evaluate the}} prevalence and correlates of plantar calcaneal spurs in a large sample of older people. Methods Weightbearing lateral foot radiographs of 216 people (140 women and 76 men) aged 62 to 94 years (mean age 75. 9, SD 6. 6) were examined for plantar calcaneal and Achilles tendon spurs. Associations between the presence of spurs and sex, body mass index, radiographic measures of foot posture, self-reported co-morbidities and current or previous heel pain were then explored. Results Of the 216 participants, 119 (55 %) {{had at least one}} plantar <b>calcaneal</b> <b>spur</b> and 103 (48 %) had at least one Achilles tendon spur. Those with plantar calcaneal spurs {{were more likely to have}} Achilles tendon spurs (odds ratio [OR] = 2. 0, 95 % confidence interval [CI] 1. 2 to 3. 5). Prevalence of spurs did not differ according to sex. Participants with plantar calcaneal spurs were more likely to be obese (OR = 7. 9, 95 % CI 3. 6 to 17. 0), report osteoarthritis (OR = 2. 6, 95 % CI 1. 6 to 4. 8) and have current or previous heel pain (OR = 4. 6, 95 % CI 2. 3 to 9. 4). No relationship was found between the presence of calcaneal spurs and radiographic measures of foot posture. Conclusion Calcaneal spurs are common in older men and women and are related to obesity, osteoarthritis and current or previous heel pain, but are unrelated to radiographic measurements of foot posture. These findings support the theory that plantar calcaneal spurs may be an adaptive response to vertical compression of the heel rather than longitudinal traction at the calcaneal enthesis. </p...|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE To {{determine}} {{the spectrum of}} magnetic resonance (MR) imaging findings at the calcaneal attachment of the plantar fascia in asymptomatic volunteers. MATERIALS AND METHODS The study {{was approved by the}} institutional review board, and informed consent was obtained from all subjects. MR imaging was performed in 77 asymptomatic volunteers (mean age, 48. 0 years; age range, 23 - 83 years) with use of a 1. 5 -T system. There were 40 women (mean age, 49. 0 years; age range, 24 - 83 years) and 37 men (mean age, 48. 0 years; age range, 23 - 83 years). Signal intensity characteristics and thickness of the medial, central, and lateral fascicles of the plantar fascia were assessed independently by two radiologists. The presence of soft-tissue edema, bone marrow edema, and bone spur formation at the attachment of the plantar fascia was noted. Datasets were analyzed with inferential statistic procedures. RESULTS The mean thickness of the plantar fascia was 0. 6 mm (medial fascicle), 4. 0 mm (central fascicle), and 2. 3 mm (lateral fascicle). Increased signal intensity in the plantar fascia was seen with the T 1 -weighted sequence in 16 of the 77 volunteers (21 %), the T 2 -weighted sequence in six (7. 8 %), and the short inversion time inversion-recovery sequence in six (7. 8 %). Soft-tissue edema was seen deep to the plantar fascia in five of the 77 volunteers (6. 5 %) and superficial to the plantar fascia in 16 (21 %). A <b>calcaneal</b> <b>spur</b> was detected in 15 of the 77 volunteers (19 %). Calcaneal bone marrow edema was present in four volunteers (5. 2 %). CONCLUSION T 1 -weighted signal intensity changes in the plantar fascia, soft-tissue edema superficial to the plantar fascia, and calcaneal spurs are common findings in asymptomatic volunteers and should be used with caution in the diagnosis of plantar fasciitis. Increased signal intensity within the plantar fascia with fluid-sensitive sequences is uncommon in asymptomatic volunteers...|$|E

Division of Ergonomics and Exercise Physiology, Nicolaus Copernicus Univeristy in Toruń, Collegium Medicum in Bydgoszcz, Poland Abstract For aim of this paper and analysis of the treatment methods in question articles from Pumbed basis were used. Pumbed basis, which works under the auspices of US National Library of Medicine and National Institute of Health, helped to analyze the treatment methods for chronic condition of heel spur and plantar fascia. The analytical process was based on bibliographical descript. Results of 1204 numbers were summarized because of specialist criterion. Heel spurs are bony growths growing out of the plantar fascia and other soft tissues lining nearby which conduct to the plantar fascia ignition. The occurrence of these is connected with burdensome feeling of pain that can be felt when making first steps after getting up in the morning. It is a serious condition that applies to more and more people. Being overweight, training sports straining feet are the reasons contributing to this condition. Yet, it is not a general rule for the risk group. Treating methods in this sphere give many opportunities for physical therapist and doctors. The best sustainable method is physical therapy supported by medical aids. However, not every case gives intended results. If the sustainable methods are not enough, the surgical treatment should be introduced. There is no doubt that any method of treatment is individually reclaimed by every patient.
