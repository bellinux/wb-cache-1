25|$|Another {{important}} {{finding is}} a false localizing sign, the so-called Kernohan's notch, which results from compression of the contralateral cerebral crus containing descending corticospinal and some <b>corticobulbar</b> <b>tract</b> fibers. This leads to Ipsilateral hemiparesis {{in reference to the}} herniation and contralateral hemiparesis with reference to the cerebral crus.|$|E
25|$|The {{specific}} pathophysiology {{involved in}} this frequently debilitating condition is still under investigation; the primary pathogenic mechanisms of PBA remain controversial. One hypothesis, established by early researchers such as Wilson and Oppenheim, placed emphasis {{on the role of}} the corticobulbar pathways in modulating emotional expression in a top-down model, and theorized that PBA occurs when bilateral lesions in the descending <b>corticobulbar</b> <b>tract</b> cause failure of voluntary control of emotion, which leads to the disinhibition, or release, of laughing/crying centers in the brainstem. Other theories implicate the prefrontal cortex.|$|E
2500|$|The corticonuclear tract is {{so named}} because it connects the {{cerebral}} cortex to cranial nerve nuclei. (The corticonuclear tract is also called the <b>corticobulbar</b> <b>tract,</b> as the brainstem is sometimes called the [...] "bulb" [...] of the brain.) It is via this pathway that upper motor neurons from the cortex descend from the cortex and synapse on α-MNs of the brainstem. Similarly, UMNs of the cerebral cortex are in direct control of α-MNs of the spinal cord via the lateral and ventral corticospinal tracts.|$|E
50|$|The {{medullary}} pyramids are paired {{white matter}} {{structures of the}} brainstem's medulla oblongata that contain motor fibers of the corticospinal and <b>corticobulbar</b> <b>tracts</b> - known together as the pyramidal tracts.

5000|$|Worster-Drought {{syndrome}} {{is a form}} of congenital suprabulbar paresis that occurs in some children with cerebral palsy.

25|$|The {{pyramidal}} tracts {{include both}} the corticospinal and <b>corticobulbar</b> <b>tracts.</b> These are aggregations of efferent nerve fibers {{from the upper}} motor neurons that travel from the cerebral cortex and terminate either in the brainstem (corticobulbar) or spinal cord (corticospinal) and {{are involved in the}} control of motor functions of the body.|$|R
2500|$|Fibres {{from the}} [...] motor cortex travel with the corticospinal tract through the {{internal}} capsule, but terminate {{in a number}} of locations in the midbrain (cortico-mesencephalic tract), pons (Corticopontine tract), and medulla oblongata (cortico-bulbar tract). [...] The upper motor neurons of the <b>corticobulbar</b> <b>tract</b> synapse with interneurons or directly with the lower motor neurons located in the motor cranial nerve nuclei, namely oculomotor, trochlear, motor nucleus of the trigeminal nerve, abducens, facial nerve and accessory and in the nucleus ambiguus to the hypoglossal, vagus and accessory nerves. [...] These nuclei are supplied by nerves {{from both sides of the}} brain, with the exception of the parts of the facial nerve that control muscles of the lower face. These muscles are only innervated by nerves from the contralateral (opposite) side of the cortex.|$|E

5000|$|In anatomy, the {{extrapyramidal}} {{system is a}} biological neural network {{that is part of}} the motor system causing involuntary actions.

50|$|The {{anterior}} median fissure {{contains a}} fold of pia mater, and extends {{along the length}} of the medulla oblongata. It ends at the lower border of the pons in a small triangular area, termed the foramen cecum. On either side of this fissure are raised areas termed the medullary pyramids. The pyramids house the pyramidal tracts-the corticospinal and the <b>corticobulbar</b> <b>tracts</b> of the nervous system. At the caudal part of the medulla these tracts cross over in the decussation of the pyramids obscuring the fissure at this point. Some other fibers that originate from the anterior median fissure above the decussation of the pyramids and run laterally across the surface of the pons are known as the anterior external arcuate fibers.|$|R

40|$|We present {{four cases}} of the ‘opercular syndrome’ of volitional paresis of the facial, lingual, and {{laryngeal}} muscles (bilateral facio-glosso-pharyngo-masticatory paresis). Case histories and CT brain images are presented, along with {{a review of the}} literature concerning this long-recognized but little-known syndrome. The neuroanatomic basis of the syndrome classically involves bilateral lesions of the frontal operculum. We propose, on the basis of our cases and others, that the identical syndrome can arise from lesions of the <b>corticobulbar</b> <b>tracts,</b> not involving the cortical operculum. Our cases included one with bilateral subcortical lesions, one with a unilateral left opercular lesion and a possible, non-visualized right hemisphere lesion, one with unilateral cortical and unilateral subcortical pathology, and one with bilateral cortical lesions. These lesion localizations suggest that any combination of cortical or subcortical lesions of the operculum or its connections on both sides of the brain can produce a syndrome indistinguishable from the classical opercular syndrome. We propose the new term ‘opercular-subopercular syndrome’ to encompass cases with predominantly or partially subcortical lesions...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Worster-Drought {{syndrome}} (WDS) {{consists of}} a congenital pseudobulbar palsy and is usually associated with spastic tetraplegia, learning impairment, behavioural problems, and epilepsy. Congenital bilateral perisylvian syndrome (CBPS) is characterized by bilateral perisylvian polymicrogyria on imaging. Clark et al, have previously proposed a WDS spectrum that includes CBPS, speculating {{that it may be}} due to malformation of the perisylvian region due to various perinatal or congenital causes, whether demonstrable on imaging, or functional and not visible with current imaging techniques. Worster-Drought suggested that the syndrome is probably a developmental defect of the motor <b>tracts</b> (<b>corticobulbar)</b> which run from {{the lower part of the}} motor (Rolandic) area of the cerebral cortex to the 10 th and 12 th cranial nerve nuclei. Methods: A 12 -year-old boy presented with a long history of spastic tetraplegia, learning impairment, behavioural problems, and epilepsy. The seizures were refractive to several antiepileptic drugs. He also had variable difficulty in moving the tongue, soft palate and lips with weakness of the pharynx and laryngeal muscle. Results: Video-EEG monitoring captured paroxysms of PO in the center-front of both hemispheres, and that project contralaterally. Neuroimaging studies do not revealed abnormalities. Conclusion: Our patient presented the characteristic symptoms of Worster-Drought syndrome (WDS) with mild spastic tetraplegia, learning impairment, and epilepsy. MRI did not show dysplastic cortex in the region of the sylvian fissures, giving normal signal on T 1 - and T 2 -weighted images. Although the white matter had a normal appearance, an abnormality in the <b>corticobulbar</b> <b>tracts</b> cannot be excluded...|$|R
50|$|The {{classical}} {{clinical presentation}} is the progressive development of spastic tetraparesis, pseudobulbar palsy, and emotional lability (pseudobulbar affect), with other more variable neurological features associated with brainstem damage. These {{result from a}} rapid myelinolysis of the <b>corticobulbar</b> and corticospinal <b>tracts</b> in the brainstem.|$|R
40|$|Weber's {{syndrome}} is a distinctive brainstem disease characterized by ipsilateral 3 rd nerve palsy with contralateral hemiplegia and {{is due to}} an intrinsic or extrinsic lesion in the ventral midbrain. To date, there is limited literature concerning Weber's syndrome associated with central facial palsy, but none was demonstrated with comprehensive explanation. We report a rare case presented with Weber’s syndrome and central facial palsy caused by infarction of ventromedial crural region of the mesencephalon. The patient was a 68 -year-old woman who developed central type facial palsy on right side, and complete left 3 rd nerve palsy, right hemiparesis and paresthesia with deep sensory disturbance of right upper and lower extremities. A T 2 weighted cranial MRI showed an acute infarct in the left ventromedial crural region of the mesencephalon and this lesion was presumed to involve both the corticospinal and <b>corticobulbar</b> <b>tracts.</b> This report demonstrates an extremely rare case of crossed hemiplegia with oculomotor and facial nerve palsy due to an infarct in {{the upper part of}} the midbrain as documented by the MRI scan. The other interesting feature to note in our report is that the patient completely recovered six months later. This indicates that some of these patients may have a good prognosis.

50|$|It is {{a region}} of histologically {{disparate}} cells located just dorsal (posterior) to the inferior olivary nucleus in the lateral portion of the upper (rostral) medulla. It receives upper motor neuron innervation directly via the <b>corticobulbar</b> <b>tract.</b>|$|E

40|$|The {{promotion}} of post-ischaemic motor recovery remains {{a major challenge}} in clinical neurology. Recently, plasticity-promoting effects have been described for the growth factor erythropoietin in animal models of neurodegenerative diseases. To elucidate erythropoietin's effects in the post-acute ischaemic brain, we examined how this growth factor influences functional neurological recovery, perilesional tissue remodelling and axonal sprouting of the corticorubral and <b>corticobulbar</b> <b>tracts,</b> when administered intra-cerebroventricularly starting 3 days after 30 min of middle cerebral artery occlusion. Erythropoietin administered at 10 IU/day (but not at 1 IU/day), increased grip strength of the contralesional paretic forelimb and improved motor coordination without influencing spontaneous locomotor activity and exploration behaviour. Neurological recovery by erythropoietin was associated with structural remodelling of ischaemic brain tissue, reflected by enhanced neuronal survival, increased angiogenesis and decreased reactive astrogliosis that resulted in reduced scar formation. Enhanced axonal sprouting from the ipsilesional pyramidal tract into the brainstem was observed in vehicle-treated ischaemic compared with non-ischaemic animals, as shown by injection of dextran amines into both motor cortices. Despite successful remodelling of the perilesional tissue, erythropoietin enhanced axonal sprouting of the contralesional, but not ipsilesional pyramidal tract {{at the level of}} the red and facial nuclei. Moreover, molecular biological and histochemical studies revealed broad anti-inflammatory effects of erythropoietin in both hemispheres together with expression changes of plasticity-related molecules that facilitated contralesional axonal growth. Our study establishes a plasticity-promoting effect of erythropoietin after stroke, indicating that erythropoietin acts via recruitment of contralesional rather than of ipsilesional pyramidal tract projection...|$|R
50|$|The {{medullary}} pyramids contain motor fibers {{that are}} known as the <b>corticobulbar</b> and corticospinal <b>tracts.</b> The corticospinal tracts are on the anterior surface of the pyramids. These tracts transport motor signals that originated in the precentral gyrus and travelled through the internal capsule to the medulla oblongata and pyramids. Extrapyramidal tracts are those motor tracts that do not traverse the medullary pyramids.|$|R
40|$|Intraoperative neurophysiological {{monitoring}} (IOM) {{has established}} itself {{as one of}} the paths by which modern neurosurgery can improve surgical results while minimizing morbidity. IOM consists of both monitoring (continuous "on-line" assessment of the functional integrity of neural pathways) and mapping (functional identification and preservation of anatomically ambiguous nervous tissue) techniques. In posterior-fossa and brainstem surgery, mapping techniques can be used to identify - and therefore preserve - cranial nerves, their motor nuclei and corticospinal or corticobulbar pathways. Similarly, free-running electromyography (EMG) and muscle motor-evoked potential (mMEP) monitoring can continuously assess the functional integrity of these pathways during surgery. Mapping of the corticospinal tract, {{at the level of the}} cerebral peduncle as well as mapping of the VII, IX-X and XII cranial nerve motor nuclei on the floor of the fourth ventricle, is of great value to identify "safe entry-zones" into the brainstem. Mapping techniques allow recognizing anatomical landmarks such as the facial colliculus, the hypoglosseal and glossopharyngeal triangles on the floor of the fourth ventricle, even when normal anatomy is distorted by a tumor. On the basis of neurophysiological mapping, specific patterns of motor cranial nuclei displacement can be recognized. However, brainstem mapping cannot detect injury to the supranuclear tracts originating in the motor cortex and ending on the cranial nerve motor nuclei. Therefore, monitoring techniques should be used. Standard techniques for continuously assessing the functional integrity of motor cranial nerves traditionally rely on the evaluation of spontaneous free-running EMG in muscles innervated by motor cranial nerves. Although several criteria have been proposed to identify those EMG activity patterns that are suspicious for nerve injury, the terminology remains somewhat confusing and convincing data regarding a clinical correlation between EMG activity and clinical outcome are still lacking. Transcranial mMEPs are also currently used during posterior-fossa surgery and principles of MEP monitoring to assess the functional integrity of motor pathways are similar to those used in brain and spinal-cord surgery. Recently, current concepts in muscle MEP monitoring have been extended to the monitoring of motor cranial nerves. So-called "corticobulbar mMEPs" can be used to monitor the functional integrity of <b>corticobulbar</b> <b>tracts</b> from the cortex through the cranial motor nuclei and to the muscle innervated by cranial nerves. Methodology for this purpose has appeared in the literature only recently and mostly with regards to the VII cranial nerve monitoring. Nevertheless, this technique has not yet been standardized and some limitations still exist. In particular, with regards to the preservation of the swallowing and coughing reflexes, available intraoperative techniques are insufficient to provide reliable prognostic data since only the efferent arc of the reflex can be tested...|$|R
