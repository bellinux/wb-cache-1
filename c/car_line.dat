5|$|The {{fountain}} {{is located}} in a highly visible spot on the downtown San Francisco waterfront, in Justin Herman Plaza, where Market Street meets The Embarcadero. The Hyatt Regency Hotel is {{at the edge of the}} plaza, adjacent to the other four highrise towers of the Embarcadero Center. Across The Embarcadero is the Ferry Building, and the eastern end of the California Street cable <b>car</b> <b>line</b> is on the other side of the Hyatt Regency Hotel.|$|E
5|$|Rowland ran wide while de Jong {{reversed}} {{onto the}} run-off area. This {{was caused by}} both drivers not gaining optimum brake temperature. De Jong dropped to fifth while Rowland fell to third after the latter was passed by Sirotkin. Armand spun in the seventh corner, triggering the safety car's second appearance. It remained on the track {{for the next three}} laps. On the restart, Matsushita utilised a tactic of backing the field up before driving away. However some drivers accelerated away after passing the safety <b>car</b> <b>line,</b> while others remained at the pace dictated by Matsushita. This resulted in Malja colliding with the rear-end of Evans's car, removing his front wing, and sending debris from it airborne. Malja then hit Rowland in the first corner. He spun but managed to continue. Gelael was forced to collide with the barrier, causing him to retire. The incident resulted in the safety car's third deployment which remained on track for the next two laps. At the lap 13 restart, Marciello got away faster than Matsushita and drove around the inside of him but locked his tyres. The two made contact when they steered into turn one. The incident allowed Gasly to inherit the lead, with teammate Giovinazzi moving into second.|$|E
25|$|Receiving {{an influx}} of Irish, Italian and other {{immigrants}} in the 1930s, the Castro gradually became an ethnically mixed working-class neighborhood, and it remained so until the mid-1960s. There was originally a cable <b>car</b> <b>line</b> with large double-ended cable cars that ran along Castro Street from Market Street to 29th St., until the tracks were dismantled in 1941 and the cable <b>car</b> <b>line</b> {{was replaced by the}} 24 MUNI bus. The Castro {{is at the end of}} the straight portion of the Market Street thoroughfare, and a mostly residential area follows Market Street as it curves and rises up and around the Twin Peaks mountains.|$|E

25|$|The cable <b>car</b> <b>line</b> {{offers two}} levels of service based on {{different}} cabin designs, branded Standard Cabins and Crystal Cabins. The Crystal Cabins are distinguished by their glass bottoms, and are charged at a premium rate.

25|$|In 1907 Friscoville Avenue was {{developed}} in Arabi. Because of a ban on gambling in the city limits of Orleans Parish, the area gambling center with around 5 gambling halls along the 100 block of Friscoville Avenue. Being just outside the Orleans Parish line, Friscoville {{was at the time}} easily accessible by the Canal Street <b>Car</b> <b>Line.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{line was}} first opened in 1859 {{as a horse}} <b>car</b> <b>line</b> {{operated}} by the Richmond and Schuylkill River Passenger Railway, and electrified in 1895, with extensions in 1902 and 1903. Service was suspended (replaced with buses) in 1992, along with Route 23 (Germantown Avenue-11th and 12th Streets) and Route 56 (Torresdale-Erie Avenues). On September 4, 2005, trolley service was restored.|$|E
25|$|Also in 1945, the DSR {{purchased}} two PCC streetcars {{after finding}} out its existing streetcars were worn out; the cars, numbered #100 and #101, were diverted from an order by the Pittsburgh Railways Company {{and placed in}} service along Woodward, {{which at the time}} was the DSR's most-used <b>car</b> <b>line.</b> More PCC cars would arrive in May 1947 and August 1949.|$|E

25|$|The next cable <b>car</b> <b>line</b> to open was the Sutter Street Railway, which {{converted}} from horse operation in 1877. This line introduced the side grip, and lever operation, both designed by Henry Casebolt {{and his assistant}} Asa Hovey, and patented by Henry Casebolt. This idea was brought about because Casebolt {{did not want to}} pay Hallidie royalties of $50,000 a year for use of his patent. The side grip allowed cable cars to cross at intersections.|$|E
25|$|On May 26, 1942, the California State Railroad Commission {{proposed}} {{an extension of}} the Burbank Line to the Lockheed plant. The proposal called for a double track line from Arden Junction along Glenoaks to San Fernando Blvd and Empire Way, just northeast of Lockheed's main facility. But this extension never materialized and the commission moved on to other projects in the San Fernando Valley. The Red <b>Car</b> <b>line</b> in Burbank was abandoned and the tracks removed in 1956.|$|E
25|$|From 2015, {{the safety}} car is not {{required}} to wait until all backmarkers have caught back up to the queue. When the safety car is ready to leave the circuit, it will turn off its orange lights to indicate that it will enter the pit lane {{at the end of the}} lap. Drivers must continue in formation until they cross the first safety <b>car</b> <b>line,</b> where circuit green lights and flags will indicate they are free to race again.|$|E
50|$|Overall, {{the delay}} {{stemming}} from the Cogan accident lasted over 45 minutes. Only 29 <b>cars</b> <b>lined</b> up for the second start attempt.|$|R
50|$|New York City {{developed}} {{at least seven}} cable <b>car</b> <b>lines.</b> A line in Washington DC ran to Georgetown (where some of the underground cable vaults can still be seen today). Los Angeles also had several cable <b>car</b> <b>lines,</b> including the Second Street Cable Railroad, which operated from 1885 to 1889, and the Temple Street Cable Railway, which operated from 1886 to 1898. The most extensive cable system in the US was in Chicago between 1882 and 1906.|$|R
50|$|Dunedin {{also had}} several Cable <b>Car</b> <b>lines</b> to various suburbs and Wellington {{still has the}} Wellington Cable Car (actually a funicular) to Kelburn.|$|R
25|$|After the war it was {{eventually}} {{decided to build}} a suspended cable <b>car</b> <b>line</b> from a point close to the intended start point of the previously planned rack railway. The line was privately built and owned, opening on 17 July 1930 {{after three years of}} construction. It was built to Professor Benoit's design, using one carrying cable and two traction cables. There were 10 cabins, a maximum of 8 of which could be used at any time, and each cabin carried up to 22 passengers and a conductor.|$|E
25|$|Thus, the AMC Eagle {{came about}} when Jeep's chief {{engineer}} joined a Concord {{body with a}} four-wheel-drive system. Such a vehicle was a logical step for AMC, according to then CEO Gerald C. Meyers, as a second energy crisis had hit in 1979, and sales of AMC's highly profitable truck-based Jeep line dropped, {{due in part to}} their low fuel efficiency, leaving AMC in a precarious financial position. The Eagle provided a low-cost way of bridging the gap between AMC's solid and economical, but aging, passenger <b>car</b> <b>line</b> and its well-regarded, but decidedly off-road-focused, Jeep line, as the Eagle used the existing Concord (and later, Spirit) automobile platform.|$|E
25|$|Streetcar {{congestion}} {{in downtown}} Boston {{led to the}} subways in 1897 and elevated rail in 1901. The Tremont Street Subway was the first rapid transit tunnel in the United States. Grade-separation added capacity and avoided delays caused by cross streets. The first elevated railway and the first rapid transit line in Boston were built three years before the first underground line of the New York City Subway, but 34 {{years after the first}} London Underground lines, and long after the first elevated railway in New York City, its Ninth Avenue El started operations on July 1, 1868 in Manhattan as an elevated cable <b>car</b> <b>line.</b>|$|E

25|$|Early street {{railways}} on Broadway {{included the}} Broadway and Seventh Avenue Railroad's Broadway and University Place Line (1864?) between Union Square (14th Street) and Times Square (42nd Street), the Ninth Avenue Railroad's Ninth and Amsterdam Avenues Line (1884) between 65th Street and 71st Street, the Forty-second Street, Manhattanville and St. Nicholas Avenue Railway's Broadway Branch Line (1885?) between Times Square and 125th Street, and the Kingsbridge Railway's Kingsbridge Line north of 169th Street. The Broadway Surface Railroad's Broadway Line, a cable <b>car</b> <b>line,</b> opened on lower Broadway (below Times Square) in 1893, and soon became {{the core of}} the Metropolitan Street Railway, with two cable branches: the Broadway and Lexington Avenue Line and Broadway and Columbus Avenue Line.|$|E
25|$|By 1850, {{the once}} {{agricultural}} community {{had seen a}} significant change in its population. Only 10% of its heads of household were listed as farmers, while 28% were businessmen and professionals, and another 20% were Irish-born. In an effort to stem the increase in property taxes to support the rapidly urbanizing inner Roxbury area, the owners of the large estates in Jamaica Plain led a successful effort in 1851 to secede from Roxbury and form a new, suburban town of West Roxbury. Meanwhile, growth continued unabated. In 1850, David S. Greenough developed the south end of his family land into four streets, including today's McBride Street. Three years later, he sold land along {{the east side of the}} railroad tracks for the new Jamaica Plain Gas Light Company. In 1857, the new West Roxbury Railroad Company extended their horse rail <b>car</b> <b>line</b> to a depot on South Street, at the site of today's public housing project opposite McBride Street.|$|E
25|$|AMT then, {{through the}} early 1960s, ruled supreme in the promotional (and kit) market rivaled only by Jo-Han. Newcomer MPC (Model Products Corporation) entered the arena in 1964 with their Corvette kit, {{followed}} by 1965 promotionals of the Dodge <b>car</b> <b>line.</b> Plastic model makers like Pyro Plastics Corporation and Premier Products came and went, while other kit makers focused on different vehicles. Lindberg rarely touched the promo market. Monogram focused on custom, hot rod, TV, movie, racing cars, aircraft, and ships. Revell did U.S. vehicles, but focused on European Sports and racing cars. Aurora Plastics Corporation specialized in aircraft, TV, classic Universal Monsters & figure kits. Aurora also made a large range of 1:32 scale and a several 1:25 scale car kits. Palmer Plastics sold a number of American 1:32 scale car models for 98 cents each throughout the 1960s, but these models were poorly detailed and lacked basic features such as clear windows and correct wheel covers.|$|E
