Evidence to support this is from the first documented instance by Davis of V. crabro parasitizing the yellow garden spider Argiope aurantia.

This also follows the trait that is observed in most vespines that as the year progresses, they change their food-seeking techniques from foraging for food to scavenging, especially once the fall season begins. A common scavenging technique in the fall consists of Vespines loitering around a garbage can, which is why they are regarded as pests in some areas.|$|E

40|$|For decades <b>free</b> <b>cutting</b> steels {{have been}} alloyed with lead {{in order to}} improve {{machinability}}. Enhanced machinability is characterised by low tool wear, short breaking chips, high surface quality and low cutting forces. Although the lead content in steels is comparably low, leaded steels are under threat for environmental reasons. The EU-directive on end-of-life vehicles generally prohibits the use of lead for machinability enhancement but currently an exception for steels alloyed with up to 0. 35 % lead exists. Within the present work it was investigated if alternative alloying elements are capable of substituting for lead in terms of machinability. The machinability of different alloyed <b>free</b> <b>cutting,</b> carbon and case carburising steels was analysed. Thereby, it was focussed on dry machining of <b>free</b> <b>cutting</b> steels (grade 11 SMn 30).

50|$|The web of {{the yellow}} garden spider is distinctive: a {{circular}} shape up to 2 feet (60 cm) in diameter, with a dense zigzag of silk, known as a stabilimentum, in the center. The purpose of the stabilimentum is disputed. It is possible that it acts as camouflage for the spider lurking in the web's center, {{but it may also}} attract insect prey, or even warn birds of the presence of the otherwise difficult-to-see web. Only those spiders that are active during the day construct stabilimenta in their webs.To construct the web, several radial lines are stretched among four or five anchor points that can be more than three feet apart. The radial lines meet at a central point. The spider makes a frame with several more radial lines and then fills the center with a spiral of silk, leaving a 5/16 to 3/8 inches (8 to 9.5 mm) gap between the spiral rings, starting with the innermost ring and moving outward in a clockwise motion. To ensure that the web is taut, the spider bends the radial lines slightly together while applying the silk spiral. The female builds a substantially larger web than the male's small zigzag web, often found nearby. The spider occupies the center of the web, usually hanging head-down, waiting for prey to become ensnared in it. If disturbed by a possible predator, she may drop from the web and hide on the ground nearby. The web normally remains in one location for the entire summer, but spiders can change locations usually early in the season, perhaps to find better protection or better hunting.The yellow garden spider can oscillate her web vigorously while she remains firmly attached in the center. This action might prevent predators like wasps and birds from drawing a good bead, and also to fully entangle an insect before it cuts itself loose.However, in a case observed in Georgia, Davis witnessed a Vespa crabro fly into the spider’s web and get tangled up. Upon looking closer it was found that V. crabro was actually <b>cutting</b> <b>free</b> prey that had been caught in the A. aurantia web. In this case, A. aurantia did not interfere or fight with the European hornet probably because it dropped down and hid nearby.|$|E
