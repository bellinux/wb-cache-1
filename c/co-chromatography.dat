40|$|Graduation date: 1967 Achlys triphylla, {{a member}} of a medicinally active family {{containing}} alkaloids, was examined phytochemically to determine its possible value as a source of medicinal agents. Pharmacological testing of the crude ethanol extract exhibited a competitive inhibition of acetylcholine and histamine. Purification of alkaloid 'A' from the crude ethanol extract and subsequent pharmacological testing showed a lack of any biological activity. The alkaloid responded to typical alkaloid reagents and was isolated by means of alumina column chromatography. Preliminary data indicated that the alkaloid's identity was magnoflorine, a quaternary alkaloid commonly occurring in the plants of this family. However, its IR spectrum was different from that of magnoflorine and it could be precipitated from its acidic solution by ammonium hydroxide. Similarly, its iodide salt could not be prepared by the method commonly used for preparing the derivative for quaternary bases. The data suggested the alkaloid may be the tertiary analog of magnoflorine, namely, corytuberine. <b>Co-chromatography</b> and the UV spectrum of alkaloid 'A' and authentic corytuberine showed that the two compounds were not identical. The empirical formula C₁₈H₁₉O₄N was determined for alkaloid 'A' (melting point 243 - 5 °C. decomp.) from elemental analysis and available spectral data. The presence of the simple quaternary base, choline, in the ethanol extract was noted by a characteristic purple coloration with Dragendorff's reagent. This simple base was not isolated, but its identity was established by means of extensive co-spotting experiments. Four different TLC developing systems (three acidic and one alkaline) and four different visualizing reagents were used to identify the choline spots. A carbohydrate was isolated from the ethanol extract. Its identity was concluded to be sucrose from its melting point, its behavior on acidic and enzymatic hydrolysis, and the melting points of its osazone and octa-acetate derivatives.

Tryptic peptides of 35 S-methioninelabeled proteins from these three sources were compared by <b>co-chromatography</b> and electrophoresis and by isoelectric focussing. Fifty-two methionine-containing peptides were resolved in digests of material from infected cells, of which about one-third were also clearly present in digests of the virion capsid proteins. The product formed in response to EMC RNA in cell-free systems from Krebs mouse ascites tumor cells yielded 26 to 29 such peptides. Most of these peptides were shown to behave identically with virus-specific peptides from infected cells, whereas just under half of them appeared to be identical with peptides from the virion capsid proteins. The product formed in response to EMC RNA in the L-cell cell-free system was similar, whereas six additional EMC-specific peptides were detected in mixed Krebs L-cell systems. The {{results indicate that the}} EMC RNA genome is partially translated in the mouse cell-free systems used to yield products containing both virion capsid and virus-specific noncapsid polypeptides...|$|E
40|$|The chrysophycean alga, Ochromonas malhamensis Pringsheim, {{was shown}} to {{synthesize}} cyclic adenosine 3 ′: 5 ′-monophosphate (cAMP) and to release it into the culture medium. Cells contained 3 to 3, 000 picomoles per gram fresh weight; medium contained up to 20 times the amount in the cells. Putative [32 P]cAMP was purified from cultures supplied [32 P]phosphate. The compound was identified as [32 P]cAMP by <b>co-chromatography</b> with authentic cAMP through 10 serial steps; by chemical deamination {{at the same rate}} as authentic cAMP, to a 32 P compound with the chromatographic behavior of cIMP; and by its conversion through the action of cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase to a 32 P compound with the chromatographic behavior of 5 ′-AMP. A two-step procedure involving chromatography on alumina and on Dowex 50 purified the unlabeled compound from cells or medium sufficiently for it to be assayable by competitive inhibition of binding of [3 H]cAMP to cAMP-binding protein (Gilman assay) or by stimulation of cAMP-dependent protein kinase. The activity was destroyed by cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase with the same kinetics as authentic cAMP, provided that an endogenous inhibitor of the phosphodiesterase was first removed by an additional purification step...|$|E
40|$|The {{contents}} of (+) -cis-abscisic acid (ABA) and alkaline-hydrolyzable ABA-conjugate(s) {{were analyzed by}} means of enzyme immunoassay in partially purified extracts of developing and mature sweet orange fruit (Citrus sinensis [L. ] Osbeck cv Washington navel). A relatively small increase in ABA was observed in the fruit exocarp during the natural color transition from green to orange. At the same time, the ABA-conjugate level increased approximately 12 -fold in this tissue. The {{contents of}} ABA and ABA-conjugate equaled 15. 0 ± 0. 7 and 107. 8 ± 2. 1 nanomoles per gram fresh weight, respectively, in the exocarp at harvest. Other tissues also contained considerable quantities of these compounds. Whereas the highest ABA content was observed in the exocarp, the highest ABA-conjugate content was observed in the central vascular axis of the fruit and equaled 187. 0 ± 10. 3 nanomoles per gram fresh weight. The only immunoreactive conjugate found in significant quantity in mature fruit was identified as abscisyl-β-d-glucopyranoside (ABA-GE) based on (a) immunological cross-reactivity, (b) thin layer chromatography <b>co-chromatography</b> with authentic standards in two solvent systems, (c) susceptibility to both chemical and enzymic degradation, and (d) mass spectroscopy...|$|E
40|$|A {{combination}} of silicone rubber extraction and non-target and suspect screening by gas chromatography coupled to high-resolution time-of flight mass spectrometry {{was used for}} the identification of compounds in particulate matter (PM). Tunnel PM is a proxy for local road pollution that constitutes a hazard to the urban environment and human health. The use of silicone rubber for the extraction of PM allowed the pre-concentration {{of a wide range of}} compounds for non-target analysis while minimising the effects of the sample matrix. As expected, polycyclic aromatic compounds (PACs) constituted the major group of compounds identified, but only 5 of 50 PACs identified were amongst those regularly monitored and many of them were alkylated or contained a heteroatom. Urban markers of contamination such as organophosphate flame-retardants, phthalates, benzothiazoles, musk compounds and a plasticiser were also identified. The level of confidence for the identifications was high based on accurate mass, the pattern of fragmentation and retention. The unequivocal identification of 16 compounds, from all groups, was confirmed by <b>co-chromatography</b> with standards and the compounds semi-quantified. Most of the PACs identified are not regularly monitored, and the hazards they pose are therefore unknown. Some of these PACs are known to be more persistent and mobile in the environment than the EPA PAH 16...|$|E
