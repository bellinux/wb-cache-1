Such approaches seldom take into consideration physical process concerns or dynamic system limitations. In the present work, an approach for improving a geometrically feasible tool-path trajectory based on quantifiable process metrics is developed. Two specific measures of toolpath quality are incorporated into the iterative improvement algorithm: instantaneous path curvature and instantaneous <b>cutter</b> <b>engagement.</b> These metrics are motivated {{by a desire to}} minimize acceleration requirements and maintain a stable steady-state cutting process during high-speed machining.

40|$|The {{high cost}} of {{manufacture}} led the aerospace industry to look for high performance machining techniques for difficult-to-cut materials like titanium alloys. Although considerable progress was obtained in the past regarding the machining rate, the results remain behind expectations. The poor cutting performance is mainly caused by the low thermal conductivity and extremely high thermal stability of these materials. In this context, simultaneous five-axis milling offers large technological and economical potential for flexible manufacturing of sculptured surfaces. Due to its specific characteristics such as adjusting constant and favorable tool load by guaranteeing constant <b>cutter</b> <b>engagements</b> and an optimal fit of the milling tool to the contour, low machining times can be realized with high surface qualities. This paper focuses {{on the development of}} these potentials for manufacturing titanium engine blades based on various investigations at the Fraunhofer IPT. Special interest is pointed to the systematic analysis of the correlation between machining parameter and surface integrity properties including the verification of theoretical approaches and FEM simulation...|$|R

Five-axis milling methods are used in industries such as aerospace, automotive and mold for free-form surface machining. In these process, surface quality and material removal rate are of very important. Conservative cutting parameters have been mostly used since {{there was a lack}} of physical models and optimization tools. Part and tool deflections under high cutting forces may result in unacceptable part quality. The extracted <b>cutter</b> workpiece <b>engagements</b> are used as input to a force prediction model.

40|$|Abstract. Five-axis {{ball-end}} milling {{technology is}} widely used in many industries such as aerospace, automotive and die-mold for complex surface machining. Despite recent advances in machining technology, productivity in five-axis ball-end milling is still limited due to the high cutting forces and stability. Moreover, cutting forces in machining is determined by extracting the <b>cutter</b> workpiece <b>engagement</b> (CWE) from the in-process workpiece. A discrete boundary representation method is developed. Cutter is firstly divided into disk elements along the tool axis. And in each disk element, boundary representation based exact Boolean method is introduced for extracting complex cutter-workpiece <b>engagements</b> at every <b>cutter</b> location due to its efficiency and speed over other discrete methods.

40|$|As {{high speed}} {{machining}} {{is becoming more}} and more important in modern machines shops, generating efficient cutter path for high speed machining is highly desirable. For this type of path, it should have the least number of sharp turns as well as the second derivatives along the path is controllable is preferred. Archimedean spirals have no sharp turn, and the step-over between adjacent segments can also be controlled to a predefined value. A clothoid spiral has the property that the second derivative varies linearly with the length of the curve. Therefore, these spiral curves can be used to generate paths with constant <b>cutter</b> <b>engagement</b> values as well as maintain smooth movements while performing cornering and linking movements. In this paper, we will introduce a detailed approach which covers a 2 D region in a very efficient manner by using the combination of Archimedean and clothoid spirals...|$|E
40|$|Multi-axis {{machining}} (especially 5 -axis machining) {{is widely}} used in precision machining for automotive, aerospace and die-mold manufacturing. The goal in precision machining is to increase production while meeting high part quality needs which can be achieved through decision of appropriate process parameters considering machine tool constraints (such as power and torque), chatter-free operations and part quality. In order to predict and decide on optimal process parameters, simulation models are used. In the literature, individual tool geometries for multi-axis machining are examined in detailed with different modeling approaches to simulate cutting forces. In this study, a general numerical model for 5 -axis machining is proposed covering all possible tool geometries.

40|$|AbstractComposite adaptively sampled {{distance}} {{fields are}} {{a new approach to}} shape representation that is well suited for Numerically Controlled (NC) milling simulation. In NC milling, as the milling tool moves along the tool path, it carves out a swept volume and a portion of the workpiece is removed. During the milling tool motion, it is in contact with the workpiece over an instantaneous common surface which is called <b>Cutter</b> Workpiece <b>Engagement</b> (CWE) surface. In order to model the process mechanics and dynamics accurately, {{it is important to have}} a precise geometric representation of the CWE surface. One of the fundamental difficulties has been the accurate and computationally efficient determination of this surface along the tool path for five-axis milling applications. In this paper, we provide a brief introduction to distance fields for swept volumes and describe a new method for determining the CWE surface for general and complex five-axis NC milling. The combination of high simulation speed, high accuracy and modest memory requirements provide significant improvements over existing approaches...|$|R
40|$|This study {{focuses on}} cutting force {{predictions}} with the tool-workpiece inclination angle in bull-nose milling {{based on the}} semimechanistic force model. By analyzing kinematics and mechanics of the bull-nose end mills during cutting, force expressions including lead angle are stated and the model is exerted on each discrete element as oblique cutting with coordinate transformation and numerical integration to obtain the dynamic cutting force components. An improved identification method considering speed variations along the tool axis is applied to calibrate coefficients. Coefficients are regarded as the function of each elemental elevation. Then, a geometry-based method to acquire <b>cutter</b> workpiece <b>engagement</b> (CWE) is proposed. Also acquisition of accurate start and exit angles on each slice is deliberated elaborately for cutters with lead or tilt angle in milling processes. Thereby, to verify {{the validity of the}} force prediction model and start-exit angle acquisition method, experiments with variable lead angles are conducted under different axial immersions. The results reveal that the presented model and approaches can predict cutting forces with high accuracy. Finally, the cutting force components under different cutter postures and conditions are analyzed to provide instructions for parameter selections...|$|R
40|$|Multi-axis milling offers {{increased}} accessibility in milling {{of parts}} having geometrical constraints or free form surfaces, where variety of cutting tools and edge geometries are utilized to improve stability and {{productivity of the}} processes. In order to machine the desired geometries effectively, in conjunction with multi-axis orientations, special tools ranging from taper end mills to process specific form tools are utilized. For such cases, the <b>cutter</b> workpiece <b>engagement</b> boundaries (CWEB) and directional force vector definitions are very complex and cannot be defined analytically. Furthermore, irregular cutting edge geometries, such as variable helix, pitch and serrations introduce multiple time delays between successive cuts where the conventional analytical frequency domain stability solution cannot be used. Prediction of stability diagrams for such variety of tool forms and edge geometries requires both {{the process and the}} tool to be defined in a generalized manner. In this paper, a numerical frequency domain milling stability solution method is proposed. The CWEB for complex multi-axis cases are calculated by the general projective geometry approach, where the cutting tool envelope and the cutting edges are represented as organized point clouds. Zeroth-Order approximation (ZOA) frequency domain method is adapted by introducing a speed average time delay term to encompass regular and irregular tool geometries. The stability limits are predicted by iterative solution of the eigenvalue problem using the ZOA frequency domain with the proposed revision. The effect of the process damping is also introduced into the generalized stability solution in order to predict the increase in the stability limits at low cutting speeds. A previously proposed approach is used to calculate the average process damping coefficients, which are introduced as modifiers to the modal parameters. The proposed generalized methodology is applied on several cases and it is shown that stability limits can be predicted within a reasonable accuracy for wide variety of cutting tools and milling operations...|$|R
40|$|AbstractA milling {{operation}} is inherently an intermittent material removal process where <b>cutter</b> <b>engagement</b> and disengagement is repeated {{until the end}} of the material removal process. During the process, the cutter receives multiple impacts and mechanical and thermal vibrations which eventually damage the cutting edge. The optimum rigidity and damping of the spindle motor for the least tool damage highly depends on the cutter and workpiece material properties and the cutting application. This paper introduces the concept of flexible rotational rigidity control using a high performance Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motor (PMSM) which is used as a direct spindle drive. With the PMSM spindle, the spindle rotational characteristics can be adjusted for optimizing the cutting process in order to prevent tools from unwanted premature damage. Simulation models of the spindle motor drive system are presented, which show that a very stiff spindle can be realized by fully utilizing the potential capability of the PMSM and a spindle with the same dynamic properties of a conventionally used induction motor can be realized with a single PMSM spindle. The system prototype and feasibility studies are also presented in this paper. The experimental results show that the PMSM spindle characteristics behave differently depending on the controller setting, and the spindle motor drive system rotational characteristics greatly affect the cutting process, which confirms the importance of the flexible motor control concept...|$|E
40|$|Micro-milling is {{a rather}} {{complicated}} process to simulate due to the complexities involved, such as the geometrical, mechanical, tribological, thermal and chemical aspects. They all lead to the generation of cutting forces and consequent material removal in micro scale which have some straight difference in respect to macro cutting. So far, not many 3 D FEM have been presented along with their experimental validation results in micro milling. This study discusses the performance of 3 D force prediction of a Finite Element model of micro end-mill cutting on Aluminum 6061 -T 6, implemented in AdvantEdge®. FE shows some important advantages, i. e. can easily deal {{with any kind of}} tool geometry and any side effects affecting chip formation such as thermal aspects and material properties changes. On the other hand, due to the small chip size of micro milling, extremely fine meshes and related automatic remeshing techniques are required thus increasing the computation efforts: the simulation of even a partial <b>cutter</b> <b>engagement</b> requires several hours/days of computation with the available power on to-date computing servers. In order to evaluate whether these efforts are worthy, compared to other modelling techniques, the performance of the FEM prediction were compared with the performance of a state-of-art mechanistic model, capable of including minimum chip thickness aspects as well effective rake angle effects and capable of providing force prediction with less computational time. The simulated cutting forces with the two models are then compared with experimental results and a supporting discussion is provided. Tolerable correlations between the forces profile shapes were observed. In terms of force magnitude, the predictions were overestimating the real values, also considering the results provided by the mechanistic model and to cope with that some further development area of the model are identified...|$|E
40|$|This study {{presents}} a simple method {{to define the}} <b>Cutter</b> Workpiece <b>Engagement</b> (CWE) during sculptured surface machining in five-axis milling. The instantaneous CWE was defined by determining two engagement points, lowermost engagement (LE) -point and uppermost engagement (UE) -point. LE-point was calculated using a method called grazing method. Meanwhile the UE-point was calculated {{using a combination of}} discretization and analytical method. During rough milling and semi-finish milling, the workpiece surface was represented by vertical vector. The method called Toroidal–boundary was employed to obtain the UE-point when it was located on cutting tool at toroidal side. On the other hand, the method called Cylindrical-boundary was used to calculate the UE-point for flat-end cutter and cylindrical side of toroidal cutter. For a free-form workpiece surface, a hybrid method, which is a combination of analytical method and discrete method, was used. All the CWE models proposed in this study were verified and the results proved that the proposed method were accurate. The efficiency of the proposed model in generating CWE was also compared with Z-mapping method. The result confirmed that the proposed model was more efficient in term of computational time. The CWE model was also applied for supporting the method to predict cutting forces. The test results showed that the predicted cutting force has a good agreement with the cutting force generated from the experimental work. La thèse concerne l’usinage à 5 axes de formes complexes. Le but est d’estimer le plus précisément possible les efforts induits par la coupe pour ajuster la vitesse d’avance et gagner en performance. Pour cela, il est nécessaire d’estimer les engagements radial et axial de la fraise à chaque instant.

40|$|Machining {{process with}} a single cutting tool is called {{multi-axis}} machining if more than 3 -axis {{are involved in the}} operation. On the other hand, parallel machining processes where more than one cutting tool simultaneously cut a workpiece is also called multi-axis machining. 5 -axis ball-end milling where a single cutting tool is employed, parallel turning and parallel milling processes with two cutting tools are in the scope of the thesis. Moreover, face-milling process with inserted tools is also modeled. 5 -axis ball-end milling operations are common in several industries such as aerospace, automotive and die/mold for machining of complex sculptured surfaces. Additional two degree of freedoms, namely, lead and tilt angles make it possible to machine complex parts by providing extra flexibility in cutting tool orientation. However, they also complicate the geometry of the process. In these operations, productivity, dimensional tolerance integrity and surface quality are of utmost importance. Part and tool deflections under high cutting forces may result in unacceptable part quality, whereas using conservative cutting parameters results in decreased material removal rate. Process models can be used to determine the proper or optimal milling parameters for required quality with higher productivity. The majority of the existing milling models are for 3 -axis operations, even the ones for ball-end mills. In the thesis, geometry, force and stability models are presented for 5 -axis ball-end milling operations. The effect of lead and tilt angles on the process geometry, <b>cutter</b> and workpiece <b>engagement</b> limits, scallop height, and milling forces are analyzed in detail. In addition, tool deflections/form errors and stability limits are also formulated for 5 -axis ball-end milling. The use of the model for selection of the process parameters such as lead and tilt angles which result in minimum cutting forces or maximum stability limits are demonstrated. The model predictions for cutting forces, form error and stability limits are compared and verified by experimental results. Parallel machining operations are advantageous in terms of productivity since there are more than one cutting tools in operation. Due to the increased number of cutting tools, they have the potential for considerable increase in productivity as a result of higher material removal rate (MRR). However, the dynamic interaction between these parallel tools may create additional stability problems and the advantage of parallel machining may not be utilized to full extent. For that reason, dynamics and stability of parallel machining processes need to be modeled. In the thesis, dynamics of parallel turning and parallel milling operations where two cutting tools cut a common workpiece are modeled. The predicted stability limits for parallel turning are also compared with experimental results where good agreement is demonstrated. Die manufacturing is a very critical part of the overall production chain in many industries. Depending on shape and size of a die, machining time can be very time consuming. Furthermore, since usually one die is manufactured, the chance for testing is very limited. Machining processes in die manufacturing can be limited by many factors. Process models can be used in order to select process conditions which will yield the required quality in the shortest possible time. In this study, force and chatter models are developed for face milling processes with inserted cutters. Using the developed models, process parameters are modified and their effects on productivity are demonstrated...|$|R
