40|$|In America’s {{large and}} {{severely}} congested metropolitan areas, carpools and express bus service could attract many more riders if buses could operate between residential areas and job centers on free-flowing highways that provide premium service opportunities. FAST Miles attempts to eliminate recurring congestion on limited-access highway systems using a potentially more publicly acceptable form of road pricing, {{along with an}} integrated multimodal strategy to encourage shifts of solo-driving commuters to alternative modes. FAST Miles allocates to motorists {{a limited number of}} free miles for use in peak periods on limited-access highways. Every motorist would get a share of free peak-period use of FAST highway facilities “already paid for” through his or her taxes through free FAST Miles credits. Total outstanding credits would be limited to ensure that the metropolitan highway system does not get congested and that express bus services operate faster, providing better levels of service at a lower cost. The concept would include new express bus and carpooling <b>services,</b> improved passenger <b>collection</b> <b>and</b> <b>distribution</b> <b>services</b> at bus transfer stations, free transit trial periods, web-based multimodal trip-planning programs, and individualized marketing of alternative modes at employment centers and in residential areas. Preliminary sketch analysis suggests that FAST Miles could be self-financing. It also would introduce new possibilities for public-private partnerships. 45 Journal of Public Transportation, Vol. 9, No. 1, 200...|$|R

40|$|Municipally owned {{corporations}} (MOCs) {{are increasingly}} utilised to provide local public services, but {{little remains known}} about their efficiency and effectiveness. In this article, we offer a typology of MOCs, explore the variables that affect their behaviour, and perform a systematic review of public administration articles published between 2001 and 2015 on their efficiency and effectiveness. We find that MOCs are often more efficient than local bureaucracies {{in the provision of}} services such as refuse <b>collection,</b> water <b>distribution,</b> <b>and</b> transit <b>services,</b> although they also have high initial failure rates. We conclude that municipally owned corporations are a viable means for delivering some local public services for localities capable of initiating and managing complex contracts. In light of the scarcity of literature on this topic, our conclusions remain tentative, and we encourage additional research into this growing phenomenon...|$|R
