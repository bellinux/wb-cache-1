25|$|On world markets, the <b>Canadian</b> <b>dollar</b> {{historically}} {{tended to}} move {{in tandem with the}} U.S. dollar. An apparently rising <b>Canadian</b> <b>dollar</b> (against the U.S. dollar) was decreasing against other international currencies; however, during the rise of the <b>Canadian</b> <b>dollar</b> since 2002, it has gained value against the U.S. dollar as well as other international currencies. In recent years, dramatic fluctuations {{in the value of the}} <b>Canadian</b> <b>dollar</b> have tended to correlate with shifts in oil prices, reflecting the <b>Canadian</b> <b>dollar's</b> status as a petrocurrency owing to Canada's significant oil exports.|$|R

50|$|A {{number of}} central banks (and {{commercial}} banks) keep <b>Canadian</b> <b>dollars</b> as a reserve currency. In {{the economy of}} the Americas, the <b>Canadian</b> <b>dollar</b> plays a similar role to that played by the Australian dollar (AUD) in the Asia-Pacific region. The <b>Canadian</b> <b>dollar</b> (as a regional reserve currency for banking) has been {{an important part of the}} British, French and Dutch Caribbean states' economies and finance systems since the 1950s. The <b>Canadian</b> <b>dollar</b> is also held by many central banks in Central America and South America.

25|$|By observing how the <b>Canadian</b> <b>dollar</b> behaves {{against the}} U.S. dollar, foreign {{exchange}} economists can indirectly observe internal behaviours and {{patterns in the}} U.S. economy {{that could not be}} seen by direct observation. The <b>Canadian</b> <b>dollar</b> fully evolved into a global reserve currency only since the 1970s, when it was floated against all other world currencies. Some economists have attributed the rise of importance of the <b>Canadian</b> <b>dollar</b> to the long-term effects of the Nixon Shock that effectively ended the Bretton Woods system of global finance.|$|R
50|$|Founded in 1993 by Bud & Vivian Walker, Great <b>Canadian</b> <b>Dollar</b> Store sold {{products}} with a retail price of $1.00.

25|$|Unlike other {{currencies}} in the Bretton Woods system, whose values were fixed, the <b>Canadian</b> <b>dollar</b> {{was allowed to}} float from 1950 to 1962. Between 1952 and 1960, the <b>Canadian</b> <b>dollar</b> traded at a slight premium over the U.S. dollar, reaching a high of US$1.0614 on August 20, 1957.|$|R
40|$|Between 2002 and 2008, the <b>Canadian</b> <b>dollar</b> {{appreciated}} in {{real terms}} against the US dollar by 60 percent. This large change in real exchange rates between such major trading partners as Canada and the US is almost unprecedented. This paper explores the historical background to {{the movement of the}} <b>Canadian</b> <b>dollar</b> during this period, discusses the most accepted explanations for the appreciation, and speculates on the implications for the Canadian economy. The discussion is placed within the framework of recent developments in the theoretical and empirical literature on exchange rates. <b>Canadian</b> <b>Dollar,</b> Exchange Rates, Appreciation...|$|R
50|$|The similar {{situation}} works among currency forwards, {{in which one}} party opens a forward contract {{to buy or sell}} a currency (ex. a contract to buy <b>Canadian</b> <b>dollars)</b> to expire/settle at a future date, as they do not wish to be exposed to exchange rate/currency risk over a period of time. As the exchange rate between U.S. <b>dollars</b> and <b>Canadian</b> <b>dollars</b> fluctuates between the trade date and the earlier of the date at which the contract is closed or the expiration date, one party gains and the counterparty loses as one currency strengthens against the other. Sometimes, the buy forward is opened because the investor will actually need <b>Canadian</b> <b>dollars</b> at a future date such as to pay a debt owed that is denominated in <b>Canadian</b> <b>dollars.</b> Other times, the party opening a forward does so, not because they need <b>Canadian</b> <b>dollars</b> nor because they are hedging currency risk, but because they are speculating on the currency, expecting the exchange rate to move favorably to generate a gain on closing the contract.|$|R

50|$|Saint-Victor had an {{economic}} {{boom in the}} 1990s, when the relative weakness of the <b>Canadian</b> <b>dollar</b> helped local businesses increase exports to the United States. In the mid-2000s, exports declined when the <b>Canadian</b> <b>dollar</b> strengthened and Asian textile quotas ended. But residential construction continues, and the population has been rising every year.|$|R
50|$|The {{currency}} can {{be purchased}} by anyone {{at a number of}} locations at a 1-for-1 rate. Local businesses can agree to accept the currency at par with the <b>Canadian</b> <b>dollar.</b> Merchants are free to exchange Toronto <b>dollars</b> for <b>Canadian</b> <b>dollars</b> twice a month, at the rate of 90 cents to the dollar.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Canadian</b> <b>dollar</b> is {{increasingly}} {{viewed as a}} petrocurrency in the 21st Century. Generally speaking, {{as the price of}} oil rises, oil-related export revenues rise for an oil exporting nation, and thus constitute a larger monetary component of exports. Thus it has been for Canada. As their tar sands oil deposits have been increasingly exploited and sold on the international market, movements of the <b>Canadian</b> <b>dollar</b> have become increasingly correlated with the price of oil. For example, the exchange rate of <b>Canadian</b> <b>dollars</b> for Japanese yen (99% of Japan's oil is imported) is 85% correlated with crude prices. As long as oil exports remain a strong component of Canada’s exports, oil prices will influence the value of the <b>Canadian</b> <b>dollar.</b> If the share of oil and gas exports increases further, the link between oil prices and the exchange rate may become even stronger.|$|R

50|$|Because Canada’s primary foreign-trade {{relationship}} {{is with the}} United States, Canadian consumers, economists, and many businesses primarily define and value the <b>Canadian</b> <b>dollar</b> {{in terms of the}} United States dollar. Thus, by observing how the <b>Canadian</b> <b>dollar</b> floats in terms of the US dollar, foreign-exchange economists can indirectly observe internal behaviours and patterns in the US economy that could not be seen by direct observation. Also, because it is considered a petrodollar, the <b>Canadian</b> <b>dollar</b> has only fully evolved into a global reserve currency since the 1970s, when it was floated against all other world currencies.|$|R
40|$|The authors {{revisit the}} {{relationship}} between energy prices and the <b>Canadian</b> <b>dollar</b> in the Amano and van Norden (1995) equation, which shows a negative relationship such that higher real energy prices lead to a depreciation of the <b>Canadian</b> <b>dollar.</b> Based on structural break tests, the authors find a break point in the sign of this relationship, which changes from negative to positive in the early 1990 s. The break in the effect between energy prices and the <b>Canadian</b> <b>dollar</b> is consistent with major changes in energy-related cross-border trade and in Canada's energy policies.

50|$|The {{weakness}} of the <b>Canadian</b> <b>dollar</b> and high U.S. bank stock prices were commonly cited as obstacles to purchasing assets south of the border.

The strength of the <b>Canadian</b> <b>dollar</b> and the relative {{weakness of}} U.S. bank prices have led commentators to suggest that the big five banks could consider an expansion into the United States.|$|R
