5000|$|Sally Tamarkin, {{writing for}} Slate, praised the episode {{and said that}} it got the viewer hooked on the show. [...] " [...] 'The Wrath of Con' showcases Veronica’s most salient qualities: her fierce loyalty to friends, her {{commitment}} to fairness and justice, and her wisecracking badassedness." [...] The reviewer went on to state that [...] " [...] 'The Wrath of Con' is illustrative of a <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>other</b> <b>things</b> that make the show great. Veronica Mars routinely plumbs emotional depths while avoiding cringey sentimentality. Veronica’s relationship with her dad and her BFF-ship with Wallace are tender but not uncomplicated, and {{the sweetness of the}} moments they share are cut with humor." ...|$|E

[...] He had just broken up with his girlfriend of two years, but still felt [...] "the {{prevailing}} theme kind of worked because while I was kind of down at the moment, it was a different down than I had been before. Like in the past, I’ve been depressed, and just kind of been complacent, and ok with it, but this was a different sad. This was a sad where I was mourning what I didn’t have anymore, with the girl I was dating and a <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>other</b> <b>things,</b> but it wasn’t hopeless. I knew things were going to get better, {{and it was just a}} matter of waiting it out." [...] They later recorded bonus tracks for The Upsides, and one of the songs was about the situation he found himself in upon the album's release.|$|E

He also provided management for other hip hop artists Mind over Matter and Elgen & Johnny Utah; and for a pop music artist, HR King. Also in that year he co-founded an independent record label, I Forget, Sorry!, together with Phatchance and Mind over Matter, to cater for the artists' releases. He explained his plans to Birdie of Beat magazine, [...] "The biggest focus will be this acoustic tour for now {{but we do have}} a <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>other</b> big <b>things</b> that we’ll work on after that. Chance is going to work on his album, which I’m excited about - that will hopefully be late this year or early next year. Then I'm going to be doing my album late next year too. For me the acoustic EP is a sequel to my debut EP The Sound Of Wings with Miriam Waks and a guy from Adelaide called K21 who won the Hilltop Hoods initiative." ...|$|R

5000|$|In the end, with Brainiac finally {{deactivated}} when Luthors body {{goes into}} rigor mortis and the Legion of Super-Villains having fled {{back to the}} future due to Supermans apparent murderous rage at the death of Lana (screaming, [...] "You hurt LANA?!"), Superman realizes that not all of his old foes have yet been accounted for and that the last one, Mxyzptlk, must be the villain behind all of this, as only he could have caused such bizarre events to occur. The extradimensional imp appears, with a darker color scheme and grimmer, more serious smile on his face, and claims credit for orchestrating the attacks, saying he has grown bored with simply being [...] "mischievous" [...] and now wants to see {{what it would be like}} to be [...] "evil" [...] instead. He then reveals his true form ("Did you honestly believe that a 5th Dimensional sorcerer would resemble a funny little man in a derby hat?")—a giant purple, truly five-dimensional (as Lois puts it, “I can’t describe what Mxyzptlk then became. He had height, width, depth, and a <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>other</b> <b>things,</b> too.”), vaguely humanoid shape—and begins stalking Superman through the ruins of his Fortress.|$|E
5000|$|Shortly {{after the}} botched coup attempt of 15 July 2016, the Turkish {{government}} {{claimed that the}} coup attempt had been organized by Gülen and/or his movement. Turkish prime minister Binali Yıldırım in late July 2016 told The Guardian: [...] "Of course, since {{the leader of this}} terrorist organisation is residing in the United States, there are question marks {{in the minds of the}} people whether there is any U.S. involvement or backing. So America from this point on should really think how they will continue to cooperate with Turkey, which is a strategic ally for them in the region and world." [...] Gülen, who denied any involvement in the coup attempt and denounced it, has in turn accused Erdoğan of [...] "turning a failed putsch into a slow-motion coup of his own against constitutional government." [...] On 19 July, the Turkish prime minister stated that an official request had been sent to the U.S. for the extradition of Fethullah Gülen: “We have sent four dossiers to the United States for the extradition of the terrorist chief." [...] On the same day, the White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said that president Obama had earlier in the day had a phone conversation with his Turkish counterpart and the [...] "status of Mr. Gülen was discussed on the call"; he further elaborated on the extradition issue: I can tell you that also earlier this morning, separate from the phone call, there were materials presented by the Turkish government in electronic form to the U.S. government related to Mr. Gülen's status. And the Department of Justice and the Department of State will review those materials, consistent with the requirements of the extradition treaty between the United States and Turkey that's been on the books for more than 30 years now. But the President also made clear a <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>other</b> <b>things.</b> The first is that the United States doesn't support terrorists. The United States doesn't support individuals who conspire to overthrow democratically elected governments. The United States follows the rule of law. And as it relates to Mr. Gülen's status, there is a process that is established in the extradition treaty that we will follow. There also is due process to which people who live in the United States are entitled. And we'll make sure that that due process is followed as well. The decision about Mr. Gülen's status and the decision to extradite him is not a decision that is made by the President of the United States. It is a legal decision that is made pursuant to a legal process, part of which is codified in a longstanding treaty between the United States and Turkey. So that's the process that we'll follow. Again, I can't say definitively at this point that a formal request has been made. We're still reviewing the materials that were submitted by the Turkish government, and we'll do that consistent with the process that's been established both in U.S. law and in the extradition treaty between the United States and Turkey. At the end of July, the Turkish prime minister in his interview with The Wall Street Journal expressed frustration over the perceived lack of support on the part of the U.S. administration regarding the extradition request saying that the evidence against Gülen was [...] "crystal clear". On 4 August 2016, the U.S. State Department said it had received what would amount to a formal extradition request as well as documents purported to be the incriminating evidence and was [...] "in the process of going through those documents". According to senior U.S. officials, the evidence only pertained to certain alleged pre-coup criminal activity. On September 19, Turkish government officials met with retired Army Lt. General Mike Flynn, former CIA Director James Woolsey, and others to discuss legal and potentially illegal ways to take Gülen from the US to Turkey without going through the standard extradition process. In March 2017, Flynn registered as a foreign agent for his 2016 lobbying work on behalf of the government of Turkey.|$|E
