50|$|The ISO large flange {{standard}} {{is known as}} LF, LFB, MF or sometimes just ISO flange. As in KF-flanges, the flanges are joined by a <b>centering</b> <b>ring</b> and an elastomeric o-ring. An extra spring-loaded circular clamp is often used around the large-diameter o-rings {{to prevent them from}} rolling off from the <b>centering</b> <b>ring</b> during mounting.|$|E
50|$|The ISO {{standard}} {{quick release}} flange is {{known by the}} names Quick Flange (QF), Klein Flange (KF) or NW, sometimes also as DN. The KF designation has been adopted by ISO, DIN, and Pneurop. KF flanges are made with a chamfered back surface that are attached with a circular clamp and an elastomeric o-ring that is mounted in a metal <b>centering</b> <b>ring.</b> Standard sizes are indicated by the nominal inner diameter in millimeters for flanges 10 through 50 mm in diameter. Sizes 10, 20 and 32 are less common sizes (see Reynard numbers). Some sizes share their flange dimensions with their respective larger neighbor and use the same clamp size. This means a DN10KF can mate to a DN16KF by using an adaptive <b>centering</b> <b>ring.</b> Same goes for DN20KF to DN25KF and DN32KF to DN40KF.|$|E

Metal gaskets are used in ultra-high vacuum systems where the outgassing of the elastomer could be a significant gas load. A copper ring gasket is used with conflat flanges. Metal wire gaskets made of copper, gold or indium can be used.|$|E

40|$|AbstractMetal to Metal contact (MMC) {{bolted flange}} joint, which appears between gasket <b>centering</b> <b>ring</b> and flange facing, {{is widely used}} in nuclear and {{petrochemical}} industry for severe conditions. Compared to the floating type joints, the gasket outer metal ring is compressed after bolt-up and the stored energy can compensate the loss of residual gasket stress due to internal pressure, bending moment and creep, resulting in a low leakage. As {{it is difficult to}} assess the flanged joint integrity affected by creep analytically, a three-dimensional nonlinear finite element model is developed to highlight the creep behaviour of MMC flanged joint under different load cases at elevated temperature. The results show that MMC flanged joint can reduce the unloading effects due to creep and a suitable preload is recommended...|$|E
40|$|An {{apparatus}} {{has been}} developed to implement an improved method of testing flat-plate specimens of thermal-insulation materials for cryogenic application. The method includes testing under realistic use conditions that could include vacuum and mechanical loading at a pressure up to 70 psi (= 0. 48 MPa). The apparatus can accommodate a rigid or flexible specimen having thickness up to 1. 25 in. (= 3. 2 cm) and diameters between 6 and 10 in. (about 15. 2 and 25. 4 cm, respectively). Typical test conditions include boundary temperatures between 77 K and 373 K and vacuum/interstitial gas filling at a pressure between 10 (exp - 6) torr (= 1. 3 x 10 (exp - 4) Pa) and 760 torr (atmospheric pressure = 0. 1 MPa). The interstitial gas could be N 2, He, CO 2, or any other suitable gas to which the insulation {{is expected to be}} exposed in use. Relative to prior apparatuses and testing methods, this apparatus and the testing method that it implements offer advantages of relative simplicity and ease of use. The basic principle of operation of the apparatus is that of boil-off calorimetry, using liquid nitrogen or any other suitable liquid that boils at a desired temperature below ambient temperature. Comparative rates of flow of heat through the thicknesses of the specimens (heat-leak rates) and apparent-thermal-conductivity values are obtained from tests of specimens. Absolute values of heat-leak rates and apparent thermal conductivities are computed from a combination of (1) the aforementioned comparative values and (2) calibration factors obtained by testing reference specimens of materials that have known thermal-insulation properties. The apparatus includes a full complement of temperature sensors, a vacuum pump and chamber, a monitoring and control system, and tools and fixtures that enable rapid and reliable installation and removal of specimens. A specimen is installed {{at the bottom of the}} vacuum chamber, and a cold-mass assembly that includes a tank is lowered into position above and around the specimen (see figure). A spring-based compensating fixture helps to ensure adequate thermal contact with possibly irregular specimen surfaces. For a high-compression test, the springs can be replaced with spacers. A flat circular load cell at the bottom of the chamber measures the compressive load on the specimen. Once the desired compressive-load, temperature, and vacuum/gas-filling conditions are established, testing begins. During a test, all measurements are recorded by use of a portable data-acquisition system and a computer. The total heat-leak rate is measured and calculated as the boil-off flow rate multiplied by the latent heat of vaporization. The parasitic heat leak (to the side of the specimen and to the top and side of the cold-mass tank) is reduced to a small fraction of the total heat leak by use of a combination of multilayer-insulation (MLI) shield rings, reflective film, a fiberglass/epoxy <b>centering</b> <b>ring,</b> and a bulk fill of aerogel beads. This combination eliminates the need for a cryogenic guard chamber used in a typical prior apparatus to reduce the parasitic heat leak...|$|E

40|$|Underwater {{wireless}} sensor networks (UWSNs) {{represent an}} area of increasing research interest, as data storage, discovery, and query of UWSNs are always challenging issues. In this paper, a data access based on a guide map (DAGM) method is proposed for UWSNs. In DAGM, the metadata describes the abstracts of data content and the storage location. The <b>center</b> <b>ring</b> is composed of nodes according to the shortest average data query path in the network in order to store the metadata, and the data guide map organizes, diffuses and synchronizes the metadata in the <b>center</b> <b>ring,</b> providing the most time-saving and energy-efficient data query service for the user. For this method, firstly the data is stored in the UWSN. The storage node is determined, the data is transmitted from the sensor node (data generation source) to the storage node, and the metadata is generated for it. Then, the metadata {{is sent to the}} <b>center</b> <b>ring</b> node that is the nearest to the storage node and the data guide map organizes the metadata, diffusing and synchronizing it to the other <b>center</b> <b>ring</b> nodes. Finally, when there is query data in any user node, the data guide map will select a <b>center</b> <b>ring</b> node nearest to the user to process the query sentence, and based on the shortest transmission delay and lowest energy consumption, data transmission routing is generated according to the storage location abstract in the metadata. Hence, specific application data transmission from the storage node to the user is completed. The simulation results demonstrate that DAGM has advantages with respect to data access time and network energy consumption...|$|R

40|$|Bent-core mesogens are an {{important}} class of thermotropic liquid crystals as they exhibit unusual properties as well as morphologies distinctly different from rodlike mesogens. Two bent-core mesogens with differing <b>center</b> <b>rings</b> namely benzene and thiophene are considered and investigated using high-resolution oriented solid state C- 13 NMR method in their liquid crystalline phases. The mesogens exhibit different phase sequences with the benzene-based mesogen showing a B- 1 phase, while the one based on thiophene showing nematic and smectic C phases. The 2 -dimensional separated local field (2 D-SLF) NMR method was used to obtain the C- 13 -H- 1 dipolar couplings of carbons in the <b>center</b> <b>ring</b> {{as well as in}} the side-wing phenyl rings. Couplings, characteristic of the type of the <b>center</b> <b>ring,</b> that also provide orientational information on the molecule in the magnetic field were observed. Together with the dipolar couplings of the side-wing phenyl ring carbons from which the local order parameters of the different subunits of the core could be extracted, the bent angle of the mesogenic molecule could be obtained. Accordingly, for the benzene mesogen in its B- 1 phase at 145 degrees C, the <b>center</b> <b>ring</b> methine C- 13 -H- 1 dipolar couplings were found to be significantly larger (9. 5 - 10. 2 kHz) compared to those of the side-wing rings (1. 6 - 2. 1 kHz). From the local order parameter values of the center (0. 68) as well as the side-wing rings (0. 50), a bent-angle of 130. 3 degrees for this mesogen was obtained. Interestingly, for the thiophene mesogen in its smectic C phase at 210 degrees C, the C- 13 -H- 1 dipolar coupling of the <b>center</b> <b>ring</b> methine carbon (2. 11 kHz) is smaller than those of the side-wing phenyl ring carbons (2. 75 - 3. 00 kHz) which is a consequence of the different structures of the thiophene and the benzene rings. These values correspond to local order parameters of 0. 85 for the <b>center</b> thiophene <b>ring</b> and 0. 76 for the first side-wing phenyl ring and a bent-angle of 149. 2 degrees. Thus, the significant differences in the dipolar couplings and the order parameter values between different parts in the rigid core of the mesogens are a direct consequence of the nature of the <b>center</b> <b>ring</b> and the bent structure of the molecule. The present investigation thus highlights the ability of the C- 13 2 D-SLF technique to provide the geometry of the bent-core mesogens in a straightforward manner through the measurement of the C- 13 -H- 1 dipolar couplings...|$|R

5000|$|The 120-cell can be {{partitioned}} into 12 disjoint 10-cell {{great circle}} rings, forming a discrete/quantized Hopf fibration.

Five such 10-cell rings {{can be placed}} adjacent to the original 10-cell ring. Although the outer rings [...] "spiral" [...] around the inner ring (and each other), they actually have no helical torsion. They are all equivalent. The spiraling {{is a result of}} the 3-sphere curvature. The inner ring and the five outer rings now form a six ring, 60-cell solid torus. One can continue adding 10-cell rings adjacent to the previous ones, but it's more instructive to construct a second torus, disjoint from the one above, from the remaining 60 cells, that interlocks with the first. The 120-cell, like the 3-sphere, is the union of these two (Clifford) tori. If the <b>center</b> <b>ring</b> of the first torus is a meridian great circle as defined above, the <b>center</b> <b>ring</b> of the second torus is the equatorial great circle that is centered on the meridian circle.Also note that the spiraling shell of 50 cells around a <b>center</b> <b>ring</b> can be either left handed or right handed.
