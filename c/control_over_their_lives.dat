25|$|However, {{the spread}} of patriarchy is not even. The nature and degree of women’s {{subordination}} vary across classes, regions, and the rural/urban divide. Patriarchal structures are relatively stronger in the rural and tribal setting where local customs establish male authority and power over women's lives. On the other hand, women belonging to the upper and middle classes have increasingly greater access to education and employment opportunities and can assume greater <b>control</b> <b>over</b> <b>their</b> <b>lives.</b>|$|E
25|$|Established uitlanders, {{including}} the mining magnates, wanted political, social, and economic <b>control</b> <b>over</b> <b>their</b> <b>lives.</b> These rights included a stable constitution, a fair franchise law, an independent judiciary, {{and a better}} educational system. The Boers, for their part, recognised that the more concessions they made to the uitlanders the greater the likelihood – with approximately 30,000 white male Boer voters and potentially 60,000 white male uitlanders – that their independent control of the Transvaal would be lost and the territory absorbed into the British Empire.|$|E
25|$|Taíno {{society was}} based on a matrilineal system, meaning that descent was traced through the mother and that women lived {{together}} with other women and their children apart from the men. Because of this Taíno women seem to {{have had a lot of}} <b>control</b> <b>over</b> <b>their</b> <b>lives,</b> their co-villagers and their bodies. Since they lived separately from men, they were able to decide when they wanted to involve in sexual contact. This is in part what shaped the views of conquistadors who came in contact with Taíno culture. They reportedly perceived women as “macho women” who had strong control over the men.|$|E

Survivors from childhood sexual abuse, violent and unsettled home environments have reported to have higher levels of paranormal belief. A study of a random sample of 502 adults revealed paranormal experiences were common in the population which were linked to a history of childhood trauma and dissociative symptoms. Research has also suggested that people who perceive themselves as having little <b>control</b> <b>over</b> <b>their</b> <b>lives</b> may develop paranormal beliefs to help provide an enhanced sense of control.|$|E

During this time the victim often begins to feel the onset of depression, guilt and self-blame, anger and rage, and sleep disturbances, PTSD, numbing, and extreme stress. Under these pressures, the victim can fall into the hopeless mental state of learned helplessness.|$|E
25|$|The {{ability to}} live {{independently}} with CP varies widely, depending {{partly on the}} severity of each person's impairment and partly on the capability of each person to self-manage the logistics of life. Some individuals with CP require personal assistant services for all activities of daily living.

But regardless {{of the severity of}} a person's physical impairment, a person's ability to live independently often depends primarily on the person's capacity to manage the physical realities of his or her life autonomously. In some cases, people with CP recruit, hire, and manage a staff of personal care assistants (PCAs).

5000|$|Solinger {{describes}} the social pressures {{that led to}} this unusual trend, explaining that women who had no <b>control</b> <b>over</b> <b>their</b> reproductive <b>lives</b> were defined by psychological theory as [...] "not-mothers", and that because they had no <b>control</b> <b>over</b> <b>their</b> reproductive <b>lives,</b> they were subject to the ideology of those who watched over them. As such, for unmarried pregnant white girls and women in the pre-Roe era, the main chance for attaining home and marriage rested on their acknowledging their alleged shame and guilt, and this required relinquishing their children, with more than 80% of white unwed mothers in maternity homes acting in essence as [...] "breeders" [...] for white, adoptive parents. According to Ellison, from 1960 to 1970, 27 percent of all births to married {{women between the ages of}} 15 and 29 were conceived premaritally. This problem was thought to be caused by female neurosis, and those who could not procure an abortion, legally or otherwise, were encouraged to put up their children for adoption.|$|R

2500|$|Ruiz’s {{work also}} has {{elements}} of determinism, {{the belief that}} all actions are determined by causes external to human will. Her characters are affected by things out of their control; the Californios face the legal system and Victoriano is crippled by a snowstorm. Though her work does include these events, Ruiz clearly favors the idea that humans do have <b>control</b> <b>over</b> <b>their</b> <b>lives.</b> When William Darrell blames himself for the Don’s death, Clarence comforts him and blames a larger political force. William rejects this, saying he must accept blame and not just shift it on to others who also share in the blame. William’s realization of the error of his ways creates hope for Californios. Another example of her belief that people can control their life is Don’s response to Stanford’s laissez faire business approach towards the railroad terminus. Don argues for a moral capitalism. Building a railroad terminus in San Diego will bring millions and not destroy others’ property interests. Ruiz gives Don this belief in possibility to hopefully instill the same belief in her readers. There {{is an opportunity for}} heroism in economics, and Clarence succeeds in this beneficent capitalism. She ends with Clarence and Mercedes together and the Alamars in San Francisco, showing that “she refuses to capitulate entirely to a deterministic worldview and, in the final pages, strikes a balance between leaving the reader with a bleak picture and offering some hope for the possibility of change." ...|$|E
