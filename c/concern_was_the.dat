5|$|As governor, Wickliffe's primary <b>concern</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> Panic of 1837. He {{advocated}} raising {{property taxes}} to offset spending deficits that had climbed to $42,000 by 1839, but the legislature borrowed money {{to meet the}} current expenses instead. Wickliffe maintained the state's credit by paying the interest due on state securities. The only areas where he called for more spending were improvements in river navigation, preservation of state archives, and public education. Aside from these concerns, he was inundated with requests for clemency.|$|E
5|$|To {{remedy the}} situation, one of McClellan's first orders upon taking command was to greatly expand the {{defenses}} of Washington. At all {{points of the}} compass, forts and entrenchments would be constructed in sufficient strength to defeat any attack. One area of particular <b>concern</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> region of Maryland south of the Anacostia River. Confederate artillery floated across the Potomac in secret and mounted south of the river could threaten the Washington Navy Yard and Washington Arsenal, both of which lay at the junction of the Potomac and Anacostia Rivers.|$|E
5|$|Fauré {{was elected}} to the Institut de France in 1909, after his {{father-in-law}} and Saint-Saëns, both long-established members, had canvassed strongly on his behalf. He won the ballot by a narrow margin, with 18 votes against 16 for the other candidate, Widor. In the same year a group of young composers led by Ravel and Koechlin broke with the Société Nationale de Musique, which under the presidency of Vincent d'Indy had become a reactionary organisation, and formed a new group, the Société Musicale Indépendante. While Fauré accepted the presidency of this society, he also remained a member of the older one and continued on the best of terms with d'Indy; his sole <b>concern</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> fostering of new music. In 1911 he oversaw the Conservatoire's move to new premises in the rue de Madrid. During this time, Fauré developed serious problems with his hearing. Not only did he start to go deaf, but sounds became distorted, so that high and low notes sounded painfully out of tune to him.|$|E

50|$|Computational <b>concerns</b> <b>are</b> {{important}} for evaluating econometric methods and {{for use in}} decision making. Such concerns include mathematical well-posedness: the existence, uniqueness, and stability of any solutions to econometric equations. Another <b>concern</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> numerical efficiency and accuracy of software. A third <b>concern</b> <b>is</b> also <b>the</b> usability of econometric software.|$|R
5|$|MacArthur's primary <b>concern</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> {{capture of}} the port of Manila and the airbase at Clark Field, which were {{required}} to support future operations. He urged his commanders on. On 25 January 1945, he moved his advanced headquarters forward to Hacienda Luisita, closer to the front than Krueger's. He ordered the 1st Cavalry Division to conduct a rapid advance on Manila. It reached the northern outskirts of Manila on 3 February, but, unknown to the Americans, Rear Admiral Sanji Iwabuchi had decided to defend Manila to the death. The Battle of Manila raged {{for the next three}} weeks. To spare the civilian population, MacArthur prohibited the use of air strikes, but thousands of civilians died in the crossfire or Japanese massacres. He also refused to restrict the traffic of civilians who clogged the roads in and out of Manila, placing humanitarian concerns above military ones except in emergencies. For his part in the capture of Manila, MacArthur was awarded his third Distinguished Service Cross.|$|E
5|$|NATO (North Atlantic Treaty Organisation) began {{preparations}} {{for a military}} defence of Western Europe by incorporating most West European nations into a defence pact against alleged Soviet aggression in April 1951. This led to the militarisation of West Germany in 1955 and was met with the militarisation of East Germany soon after and its merger into the Warsaw Pact alliance with the Soviet Union. The purpose of Coastal Command was to help bolster the defence and guard against a potential Soviet naval threat in Atlantic and European waters. For Coastal Command the main <b>concern</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> Atlantic. On 1 March 1950 it had lost the photo reconnaissance units to RAF Bomber Command. The transfer was not complete when North Korea invaded South Korea beginning the Korean War. Handley Page Hastings were hastily modified and ready for operations but were not sent, owing {{to the need for}} ASW aircraft in the Eastern Atlantic.|$|E
5|$|Prior to federation, {{the various}} Australian colonies could, and often did, charge tariffs on goods {{from the other}} colonies, ostensibly for the {{protection}} of their domestic manufacturing industries, mainly based in the larger cities such as Sydney and Melbourne. For a border community such as the southern Riverina, these tariffs were a sore burden, making goods purchased from Melbourne, the closest large city, more expensive and reducing the competitiveness of these towns supplying the Melbourne and Adelaide markets. In addition, crossing the border on the Murray River was a tiresome experience as each border crossing had customs posts inspecting goods and luggage to ensure all duty was paid and to reduce smuggling, a popular activity. Another item of <b>concern</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> lack of adequate river crossings. Along the Riverina the Murray was—and remains—part of New South Wales, who had no interest in assisting border residents to access goods and services in Victoria that may otherwise have been sourced from Sydney.|$|E
5|$|Another {{community}} <b>concern</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> proposed high-rise re-development of the Mungo Scott flour mill.|$|R

5|$|Tests {{were carried}} out {{starting}} in October 1940, and quickly demonstrated a number of minor problems. One of the minor issues is that the crosshairs on the tube that indicated the center would block the spot. A more serious <b>concern</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> lack of range information, which the FIU pilots considered critical. Hanbury Brown {{went to work on}} these issues, and returned an updated version in December. A U-shaped reticle {{in the center of the}} display provided a centre location that left the spot visible. Additionally, the circuitry included a second timebase that produced a longer signal as the fighter approached its target. The output was timed so the line was centred horizontally on the dot. This presented the range in an easily understandable fashion; the line looked like the wings of an aircraft, which naturally grow larger as the fighter approaches it.|$|E
5|$|The {{cause of}} the war stems from the {{increasing}} numbers of English colonists and their demand for land. As more land was purchased from the Native Americans, they were restricted to smaller territories for themselves. Native American leaders such as King Philip resented the loss of land and looked for a means to slow or reverse it. Of specific <b>concern</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> founding {{of the town of}} Swansea, which was located only {{a few miles from the}} Wampanoag capital at Mount Hope. The General Court of Plymouth began using military force to coerce the sale of Wampanoag land to the settlers of the town.|$|E
5|$|Violence again {{broke out}} after the assassination; Isabeau had troops patrol Paris and, to protect the Dauphin Louis, Duke of Guyenne, she again left the city for Melun. In August she staged an entry to Paris for the Dauphin, and early {{in the new year}} Charles signed an {{ordinance}} giving the 13-year-old the power to rule in the Queen's absence. During these years Isabeau's greatest <b>concern</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> Dauphin's safety as she prepared him to take up the duties of the King; she formed alliances to further those aims. At this point the Queen and her influence were still crucial to the power struggle. Physical control of Isabeau and her children became important to both parties and she was frequently forced to change sides, for which she was criticized and called unstable. She joined the Burgundians from 1409 to 1413, and switched sides to form an alliance with the Orléanists from 1413 to 1415.|$|E
25|$|Phosphate rocks contain {{high levels}} of fluoride. Consequently, the {{widespread}} use of phosphate fertilizers has increased soil fluoride concentrations. It has been found that food contamination from fertilizer <b>is</b> of little <b>concern</b> as plants accumulate little fluoride from the soil; of greater <b>concern</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> possibility of fluoride toxicity to livestock that ingest contaminated soils.

5|$|Within Geneva, Calvin's main <b>concern</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> {{creation}} of a collège, an institute {{for the education of}} children. A site for the school was selected on 25 March 1558 and it opened the following year on 5 June 1559. Although the school was a single institution, it was divided into two parts: a grammar school called the collège or schola privata and an advanced school called the académie or schola publica. Calvin tried to recruit two professors for the institute, Mathurin Cordier, his old friend and Latin scholar who was now based in Lausanne, and Emmanuel Tremellius, the former Regius professor of Hebrew in Cambridge. Neither was available, but he succeeded in obtaining Theodore Beza as rector. Within five years there were 1,200 students in the grammar school and 300 in the advanced school. The collège eventually became the Collège Calvin, one of the college preparatory schools of Geneva; the académie became the University of Geneva.|$|E
5|$|Although Sweyn {{had promised}} to leave England, he {{returned}} in spring 1070, raiding along the Humber and East Anglia toward the Isle of Ely, where he joined up with Hereward the Wake, a local thegn. Hereward's forces attacked Peterborough Abbey, which they captured and looted. William was able to secure the departure of Sweyn and his fleet in 1070, allowing {{him to return to}} the continent to deal with troubles in Maine, where the town of Le Mans had revolted in 1069. Another <b>concern</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> death of Count Baldwin VI of Flanders in July 1070, which led to a succession crisis as his widow, Richilde, was ruling for their two young sons, Arnulf and Baldwin. Her rule, however, was contested by Robert, Baldwin's brother. Richilde proposed marriage to William fitzOsbern, who was in Normandy, and fitzOsbern accepted. But after he was killed in February 1071 at the Battle of Cassel, Robert became count. He was opposed to King William's power on the continent, thus the Battle of Cassel upset {{the balance of power in}} northern France in addition to costing William an important supporter.|$|E
5|$|During {{the first}} month of the 2009–10 season, Booth {{sustained}} a concussion after being hit by Philadelphia Flyers forward Mike Richards during a game on October 24, 2009. Skating up to the Flyers' blueline, Booth had shot the puck into the offensive zone when Richards hit him in the head with his shoulder. Rendered unconscious, Booth was taken off the ice on a stretcher and brought to a Philadelphia hospital. In addition to his concussion, he sustained a cut above one eye that required stitches; he was released from hospital the next day. While Richards received a five-minute major penalty for interference and a game misconduct for intent to injure, he was not suspended for the play. The decision not to further penalize Richards proved to be a highly contentious issue. Panthers General Manager Randy Sexton and defenceman Keith Ballard voiced their opinion that Richards' hit was directed at the head while knowing Booth was in a vulnerable position, warranting a suspension. The Flyers captain expressed concern for Booth's health both in the media and to Panthers Head Coach Peter DeBoer personally, but asserted that he was not intending to hurt him. Another <b>concern</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> timing of Richards' hit, as Booth had already released the puck. In response, NHL Vice President Bill Daly explained that the hit was not late enough to justify a suspension.|$|E

25|$|In 1929, the Aird Commission {{on public}} {{broadcasting}} recommended {{the creation of}} a national radio broadcast network. A major <b>concern</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> growing influence of American radio broadcasting as U.S.-based networks began to expand into Canada.|$|E
25|$|However, the {{establishment}} of the funding facility was not without significant incident.
