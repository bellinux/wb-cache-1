40|$|Abstract—We {{consider}} the minimization of the transmission completion {{time with a}} battery limited energy harvesting transmitter in an M-user AWGN broadcast channel where the transmitter is able to harvest energy from the nature, using a finite storage capacity rechargeable battery. The harvested energy is modeled to arrive (be harvested) at the transmitter {{during the course of}} transmissions at arbitrary time instants. The transmitter has fixed number of packets for each receiver. Due to the finite battery capacity, energy may overflow without being utilized for data transmission. We derive the optimal offline transmission policy that minimizes the time by which all of the data packets are delivered to their respective destinations. We analyze the structural properties of the optimal transmission policy using a dual problem. We find the optimal total transmit power sequence by a directional water-filling algorithm. We prove that there exist M − 1 <b>cut-off</b> <b>power</b> levels such that user i is allocated the power between the i− 1 st and the ith <b>cut-off</b> <b>power</b> levels subject to the availability of the allocated total power level. Based on these properties, we propose an algorithm that gives the globally optimal offline policy. The proposed algorithm uses directional water-filling repetitively. Finally, we illustrate the optimal policy and compare its performance with several suboptimal policies under different settings.
