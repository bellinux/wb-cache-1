5000|$|The {{selection}} of the radar for the EFA (now known as the Eurofighter Typhoon) became a major international issue in the early 1990s. Britain, Italy and Spain supported the Ferranti-led ECR-90, while Germany preferred the MSD2000 (a collaboration between Hughes, AEG and GEC). An agreement was reached after UK Defence Secretary Tom King assured his West German counterpart Gerhard Stoltenberg that the British government would underwrite the project and allow GEC to acquire Ferranti Defence Systems from its troubled parent.

5000|$|Once {{the new and}} re-founded cathedrals {{and other}} endowments had been {{provided}} for, the Crown became richer {{to the extent of}} around £150,000 (...) , per year, although around £50,000 (...) of this was initially committed to fund monastic pensions. Cromwell had intended that the bulk of this wealth should serve as regular income of government. However, after Cromwell's fall in 1540, Henry needed money quickly to fund his military ambitions in France and Scotland; and so monastic property was sold off, representing by 1547 an annual value of £90,000 (...) [...] Lands and endowments were not offered for sale, let alone auctioned; instead the government responded to applications for purchase, of which had indeed been a continual flood ever since the process of dissolution got under way. Many applicants had been founders or patrons of the relevant houses, and could expect to be successful subject to paying the standard market rate of twenty years' income. Purchasers were predominantly leading nobles, local magnates and gentry; with no discernible tendency in terms of conservative or reformed religion, other than a determination to maintain and extend their family's position and local status. The landed property of the former monasteries included large numbers of manorial estates, each carrying the right and duty to hold a court for tenants and others. Acquiring such feudal rights was regarded as essential to establish a family in the status and dignity of the late medieval gentry; but for a long period freehold manorial estates had been very rare in the market; and families of all kinds seized on the opportunity now offered to entrench their position in the social scale. Nothing would subsequently induce them to surrender their new acquisitions. The Court of Augmentations retained lands and spiritual income sufficient to meet its <b>continuing</b> <b>obligations</b> to pay annual pensions; but as pensioners died off, or as pensions were extinguished when their holders accepted a royal appointment of higher value, then surplus property became available each year for further disposal. The last surviving monks continued to draw their pensions into the reign of James I (1603-1625), more than 60 years after the dissolution's end.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{critically}} examines Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) in an insolvency context. The {{paper is}} divided into three parts. First, we examine the area of CSR generally. Secondly, we consider directors’ obligations to creditors in both a solvent and insolvent context. Thirdly, we examine directors <b>continuing</b> <b>obligations</b> to stakeholders during a formal insolvency process. This three-pronged analysis allows us to consider whether directors still owe CSR type obligations whilst a company is going through a formal insolvency procedure pursuant to English and Welsh law. It is this crossover between CSR and insolvency which is examined in part three of the paper. It is argued that directors continue to owe duties to creditors during an insolvency procedure but that they may also continue to have obligations towards wider stakeholders, including those that fall under the realm of CSR. It is argued that this continuing CSR responsibility evidences how ingrained CSR concepts now are in English and Welsh law...|$|E

40|$|With {{contaminated}} land, {{it sometimes}} {{makes sense to}} do a partial cleanup, rather than a complete one, and combine the cleanup with land use restrictions and <b>continuing</b> <b>obligations</b> to monitor the land. The Uniform Environmental Covenants Act creates a new state law property interest to make these restrictions and obligations permanent and enforceable. It addresses issues created by traditional common law doctrines that were hostile to permanent land restrictions, {{as well as more}} contemporary problems presented by tax liens, eminent domain, and adverse possession. This Article reviews the Act’s legal infrastructure for creating, enforcing, and modifying the terms of the land use restrictions and monitoring obligations. The Article argues that the Act’s legal infrastructure provides parties with the legal certainty needed to encourage future cleanups, while also protecting against environmental risks that the residual contamination could otherwise pose. These cleanups, often financed as part of the property’s redevelopment, are particularly useful because they are a way to return blighted properties to the stream of commerce. The Act has drawn some criticism, primarily for not going further with its protections, and these are reviewed {{at the end of the}} Article...|$|E
40|$|This article {{addresses}} {{a set of}} issues that arise {{in the context of}} market liberalization for a special and important class of industries, the so-called 2 ̆ 2 network industries, 2 ̆ 2 which include electricity, natural gas, rail transportation and telecommunications. Each of these industries combines activities that are potentially competitive, such as generation of electricity, with ones that are naturally monopolistic, such as transmission of electricity. This combination produces a unique set of challenges to competition law and policy in designing a market structure and regulatory framework which maximize the benefits of liberalization while effectively controlling any tendencies to monopolistic abuse. We analyze 2 ̆ 2 Chicago School 2 ̆ 2 theories that would support negotiated access as an efficient option. After exploring the apparent contradictions between Chicago School predictions and British Gas 2 ̆ 7 s behavior, we analyze the theoretical weaknesses in the Chicago School approach and identify several reasons why voluntary negotiations should not form the basis of government policy. We review the limited experience with negotiated access to electricity transmission in Germany, which confirms our conclusion that negotiated access would deter the development of competition in the European gas and electricity industries. We propose an alternative frame for regulation based on vertical separation of the network and regulated third party access with cost-based pricing. Incumbents may merit compensation for past investments or for <b>continuing</b> <b>obligations</b> such as universal service. However, any such compensation should be provided by transparent and competitively neutral funding mechanisms...|$|E
40|$|Popular {{discussions of}} family life in {{contemporary}} society have provided a rather bleak characterization of a social institution believed to be more fragile and disorganized than in past times. Although continuing personal ties with other family members is under-stood as important in tempering the impact both of role strain and overload and also of adverse life events, it has been maintained that urban life is in-consistent with the maintenance of such family ties. Detailed studies of relations within the modified ex-tended family characteristic of urban society, how-ever, have shown high rates of contact across genera-tions, together with acknowledgement of mutual obligations perceived as important by family mem-bers. Consideration {{of the role of}} adult family life as a factor determining personal adjustment reveals a dual paradox. The first results from the use of psychological formulations concerning the develop-ment of the mother-infant bond as the basis for por-traying relations within the family of adulthood. These psychological formulations stress the impor-tance of attaining personal autonomy and self-reliance for continuing adjustment in ways which are inconsistent with the extent of mutual caring and interdependence actually reported among adults within the family. A second paradox results from the assumption that older family members may feel par-ticularly isolated from continuing family ties. Not only do reports of life within the multi-generation family contradict this assumption but, ironically, the very <b>continuing</b> <b>obligations</b> and responsibilities which are incurred by older family members across adulthood may be experienced as adversely affecting morale after midlife. Indeed, the most important contribution of these family ties to personal adjust-ment across the second half of life may well be sup-port of personal autonomy rather than the inter...|$|E
