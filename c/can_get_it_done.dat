6000|$|And this, my dear friends, {{brings us}} to the very root of the meaning of law. Man has sense to make laws (which animals cannot do), just because he is made in the {{likeness}} of God, and has the sense of right and wrong. [...] Man has the right to enforce laws, to see right done and wrong punished, just because he is made in the likeness of God. The laws of a country, as far as they are just and righteous, are the copy of what the men of that country have found out about right and wrong, and about how much right they can get done, and how much wrong punished. So, just as the men of a country are (in spite of all their sins) made in the likeness of God, so the laws of a country (in spite of all their defects) are a copy of God's will, as to what men should or should not do. And that, and no other, is the true reason why the judge or magistrate has authority over either property, liberty, or life. He is God's servant, the servant of Christ, who is King of this land and of all lands, and of all governments, and all kings and rulers of the earth. He sits there in God's name, to see God's will done, as far as poor fallible human beings <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>it</b> <b>done.</b> And, because he is, not merely as a man, but, by his special authority, in the likeness of God, who has power over life and death, therefore he also, as far as his authority goes, has power over life and death. That is my opinion, and that was the opinion of St. Paul. For what does he say--and say not (remember always) of Christian magistrates in a Christian country, but actually of heathen Roman magistrates? [...] "Let every soul be subject unto the higher powers. For there is no power but of God: the powers that be are ordained of God. [...] Whosoever therefore resisteth the power, resisteth the ordinance of God: [...] and they that resist shall receive to themselves damnation." [...] Thus spoke out the tenderest-hearted, most Christ-like human being, perhaps, who ever trod this earth, who, in his intense longing to save sinners, endured a life of misery and danger, and finished it by martyrdom. But there was no sentimentality, no soft indulgence in him. He knew right from wrong; common sense from cant; duty from public opinion; and divine charity from the mere cowardly dislike of witnessing pain, not so much because it pains the person punished, as because it pains the spectator. [...] He knew that Christ was King of kings, and what Christ's kingdom was like. He had discovered the divine and wonderful order of men and angels. He saw that one part of that order was--"the soul that sinneth, it shall die." ...|$|E

5000|$|It's an {{enormous}} amount of work. What goes into putting together an animated show, it's just staggering ...

You <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>it</b> all <b>done</b> in a couple of months as opposed to a year. Doing an animated show, it's like putting together a little movie every week. Everything is storyboarded with the intricacy of a feature film action sequence. You have to edit with a musical score in mind. And of course, we use an orchestra for each episode. So it's really like putting together a little feature each week and I was just shocked at how much—not to underplay all the work that goes into live-action sitcoms—but my God, it's definitely a much more difficult medium to me.|$|R

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThe Seamless Maritime Concept {{is the need}} to treat awareness, security, defense in a comprehensive, cohesive manner. Continuing discussion of maritime homeland security and defense capability requirements and resources allocation fails to recognize the unique requirements of the maritime domain. Enormous thought and resources have been put towards enhancing maritime homeland security and maritime homeland defense readiness. Unfortunately, the efforts to date treat "defense" and "security" disparately, ignoring the necessity to include all maritime domain partners. The Seamless Maritime Concept suggests that incremental changes to processes, boundaries, and markets have little chance to dramatically improve performance. The Seamless Maritime Concept suggests a new way of addressing the problem. The Coast Guard's motto is "Semper Paratus" or "Always Ready. " It reflects the quality of the people; the people will not let any obstacle prevent them from accomplishing the mission. Admiral Loy's "dull knife" declares the desperate need to re-capitalize the Coast Guard cutter and air craft fleets. And the Coast Guard's long standing record of success all combine to demonstrate that given some resource support that the Coast Guard <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>it</b> (maritime security) <b>done.</b> Conversely, failure to recapitalize will drive the Coast Guard toward obsolescence and preclude an opportunity to enhance the security and defense readiness of the maritime domain.

You are told that there are 8000 human beings in Port of Spain alone without visible means of subsistence, and you congratulate Port of Spain on being such an Elysium that people can live there--not without eating, for every child and most women you pass are eating something or other all day long--but without working.

If a poor man neither steals, begs, nor rebels (and these people do not do the two latter), has he not as much right to be idle as a rich man?
