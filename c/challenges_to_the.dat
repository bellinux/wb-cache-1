5|$|The {{so-called}} 'social revolutions' {{following the}} independence proclamation were <b>challenges</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Dutch-established Indonesian social order, {{and to some}} extent a result of the resentment against Japanese-imposed policies. Across the country, people rose up against traditional aristocrats and village heads and attempted to exert popular ownership of land and other resources. The majority of the social revolutions ended quickly; in most cases the <b>challenges</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> social order were quashed.|$|E

5|$|As CAS, Williams had {{to contend}} with serious <b>challenges</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> RAAF's {{continued}} existence from the Army and Navy in 1929 and 1932, arising from the competing demands for defence funding during the Great Depression. According to Williams, only after 1932 was the independence of the Air Force assured. Williams again handed over the reins of CAS to Goble in 1933 to attend the Imperial Defence College in London, resuming his position in June 1934. His promotion to air vice marshal on 1January 1935 belatedly raised him to the equivalent rank of his fellow Chiefs of Staff in the Army and Navy. He was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath in June that year.|$|E

5|$|Early monasteries {{throughout}} Europe helped preserve Greek and Roman classical civilisation. The Church {{eventually became}} the dominant influence in Western civilisation {{into the modern}} age. Many Renaissance figures were sponsored by the church. The 16th century, however, began to see <b>challenges</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Church, in particular to its religious authority, by figures in the Protestant Reformation, {{as well as in}} the 17th century by secular intellectuals in the Enlightenment. Concurrently, Spanish and Portuguese explorers and missionaries spread the Church's influence through Africa, Asia, and the New World.|$|E
5|$|Following its {{incorporation}} into the Ottoman Empire in 1517, Nablus was designated capital of the Jabal Nablus ("Mount Nablus") district. In 1657, {{after a series of}} upheavals, a number of Arab clans from the northern and eastern Levant were dispatched to the city to reassert Ottoman authority, and loyalty from among these clans staved off <b>challenges</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> empire's authority by rival regional leaders, like Zahir al-Umar in the 18th century, and Muhammad Ali—who briefly ruled Nablus—in the 19th century. When Ottoman rule was firmly reestablished in 1841, Nablus prospered as a center of trade.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} {{the residents}} formed the Vigilance Association {{with the intent}} of protecting their interests during the establishment of the new capital territory. Legal <b>challenges</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> resumption of the land were unsuccessful, but the Vigilance Association did win some concessions: the government agreed to pay for the improvements to the land, and did so at the value when the land was acquired; and the landowners gained the right of first refusal on their old properties when they were put up for lease. As of 2010 all residential land in the ACT is held on a 99-year crown lease.|$|E

5|$|La Grange draws {{attention}} to the notably high tessitura for the sopranos, for soloists and for choral singers. He characterises the alto solos as brief and unremarkable; however, the tenor solo role in PartII is both extensive and demanding, requiring on several occasions {{to be heard over the}} choruses. The wide melodic leaps in the Pater Profundus role present particular <b>challenges</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> bass soloist.|$|E
5|$|On top of {{the failure}} of the franchises to approve the spin-off, a series of {{lawsuits}} complicated the divestiture. Two legal <b>challenges</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> parent company were filed by investors, one in Pillsbury's home state of Minnesota and another in the state where it was incorporated, Delaware, in which the legality of the stock tender plan was questioned. These three events eventually forced Pillsbury to give up its bid to fend off Grand Metropolitan and agree to be acquired in November 1988 for a sum of US$5.7 billion.|$|E
5|$|Preliminary {{reports on}} {{election}} night, November 4, were that Coleman was leading by over 700 votes, {{but by the}} official results, certified on November 18, 2008, Coleman led by only 215 votes. As the two candidates were separated by less than 0.5 {{percent of the votes}} cast, the Minnesota Secretary of State, Mark Ritchie, authorized an automatic recount provided for in Minnesota election law. In the recount, ballots and certifying materials were examined by hand, and candidates could file <b>challenges</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> legality of ballots or materials for inclusion or exclusion In the recount. On January 5, 2009, the Minnesota State Canvassing Board certified the recounted vote totals, with Franken ahead by 225 votes.|$|E

5|$|The {{pipeline}} {{was built}} between 1974 and 1977 after the 1973 oil crisis caused a {{sharp rise in}} oil prices in the United States. This rise made exploration of the Prudhoe Bay oil field economically feasible. Environmental, legal, and political debates followed the discovery of oil at Prudhoe Bay in 1968, and the pipeline was built only after the oil crisis provoked the passage of legislation designed to remove legal <b>challenges</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> project.|$|E

Customizing the colony's supplies, domestic animals and skills are available, but each dwarf's mental and physical attributes are randomly generated. The game describes in detail each dwarf's physical appearance, like hair and facial features. The mental abilities, individual preferences and desires are also randomly generated. Each dwarf's relationships with others and the deities they worship can be viewed.|$|E
5|$|Also in 1947, the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC) subpoenaed ten Hollywood {{directors}} and writers, the Hollywood Ten, intending {{to ask them}} to identify Communists, but the witnesses refused to testify. All were imprisoned for contempt of Congress. The ACLU supported the appeals of several of the artists, but lost on appeal. The Hollywood establishment panicked after the HUAC hearings, and created a blacklist which prohibited anyone with leftist associations from working. The ACLU supported legal <b>challenges</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> blacklist, but those challenges failed. The ACLU was more successful with an education effort; the 1952 report The Judges and the Judged, prepared at the ACLU's direction in response to the blacklisting of actress Jean Muir, described the unfair and unethical actions behind the blacklisting process, and it helped gradually turn public opinion against McCarthyism.|$|E

5|$|As Khalid was the {{architect}} {{of most of the}} early Muslim military doctrines, he was also the pioneer of almost every major tactic that Muslims used during Early Islamic conquests. One of Khalid's major achievements in this context was utilizing the individual skills of Arab Bedouin warriors to a larger scale. He is believed to have developed them into an almost regular unit called Mubarizun ("champions"), who would issue personal <b>challenges</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> enemy officers. These were highly trained and skilled swordsmen, whom Khalid utilized effectively to slay as many enemy officers as possible, giving a psychological blow to enemy morale. The Battle of Ajnadayn is perhaps the best example of this form of psychological warfare. Moreover, his biggest achievement was the conversion of Arab tactical doctrine into a strategic system. Until Khalid, the Arabs were basically raiders and skirmishers. Khalid turned those skirmishing tactics into something that could be used anywhere. Thus he would skirmish the enemy to death: he would bring his army in front of his enemies and wait until the whole battle degenerated into a skirmishing affair between small units. Then, after exhausting the enemy units, he would launch his cavalry at their flanks employing Hammer and Anvil tactics.|$|E
5|$|Collins {{was elected}} {{lieutenant}} governor in 1979, under Governor John Y. Brown, Jr. Brown was frequently {{out of the}} state, leaving Collins as acting governor for more than 500 days of her four-year term. In 1983, she defeated Republican Jim Bunning to become Kentucky's first woman governor. Her administration had two primary focuses: education and economic development. After failing to secure increased funding for education in the 1984 legislative session, she conducted a statewide public awareness campaign in advance of a special legislative session the following year; the modified program was passed in that session. She successfully used economic incentives to bring a Toyota manufacturing plant to Georgetown, Kentucky in 1986. Legal <b>challenges</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> incentives– which would have cost the state the plant and its related economic benefits– were eventually dismissed by the Kentucky Supreme Court. The state experienced record economic growth under Collins' leadership.|$|E
5|$|Goebel's and Beckham's <b>challenges</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{election}} results were {{received by the}} General Assembly on January 2. The following day, the Assembly appointed a contest committee to investigate the allegations contained in the challenges, voter fraud and illegal military intimidation of voters among them. The {{members of the committee}} were drawn at random, although the drawing was likely rigged—only one Republican joined ten Democrats on the committee. (Chance dictated that the committee should have contained four or five Republicans.) The joint committee on the rules recommended that the contest committee report at the pleasure of the General Assembly, that debate was limited once the findings were presented, and that the report be voted on in a joint session of the Assembly. The rules further provided that the speaker of the House would preside over this joint session instead of the lieutenant governor, as was customary. The Republican minority fought these provisions, but the Democratic majority passed them over their opposition.|$|E
