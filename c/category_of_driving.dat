40|$|AbstractOne of {{the most}} common {{definitions}} of Service-Learning (S-L) programs refers to the use of community-based projects to supplement traditional curricula of the students and to enrich “by doing” the subjects covered in the teaching environment. The aim {{of this paper is to}} present a review of the international S-L programs in higher education system (European and international Universities) and to analyze those ideas that could be implemented in Romania. While in most of the SL international programs, the agents involved in the delivery of the SL programs are the teachers, we will especially discuss those SL programs in which the agents are not the teachers, but specific <b>categories</b> <b>of</b> students. Specifically, we performed a case study of the Faculty of Psychology and Sciences of Education (“Babes-Bolyai” University, Romania), which, since 1992, has one {{of the most}} active Student Associations in Romania, i. e. Romanian Association of Psychology Students (RAPS). Also, the Faculty has several successful distance learning programs in Psychology, Special Education and Pedagogy. Thus, the Faculty has these two student-based <b>categories</b> <b>of</b> <b>driving</b> forces in terms of offering themselves SL activities: (1) a very active Association of students and (2) a large number of mature students from the distance learning study programs – most of these students are currently employed and/or have graduated another Faculty (some of them are also holders of PhD titles). Based on the literature review, we discuss here the possibilities to include these two <b>categories</b> <b>of</b> students in the Quality Assurance program of the Faculty, in terms of establishing their role as active agents of the QA process. These strategies should be based on the facts that: (1) the members of the Student Association have the potential to develop themselves as a culture with standards and values in the area QA at Faculty level, and (2) the <b>category</b> <b>of</b> mature (adult) students could bring, in a structured manner, an important insight to the other types of students at levels of career orientation, work-related expectations and humane-abilities development. Most important, the ideas of S-L programs implementation are analyzed from the perspective of internalization strategies of the European standards for internal quality assurance within Romanian higher education system...|$|R

40|$|Reckless {{driving is}} a major {{contributing}} factor to road morbidity and mortality. While further research into the nature and impact <b>of</b> reckless <b>driving,</b> particularly among young people, is urgently needed, the measurement <b>of</b> reckless <b>driving</b> behaviour also requires increased attention. Three major shortcomings apparent in many established measures of driver behaviour are {{that they do not}} target the full range <b>of</b> reckless <b>driving</b> behaviours, they measure characteristics other than driving behaviours, and they fail to categorise and label reckless driver behaviour based on characteristics of the behaviours themselves. To combat these shortcomings, this paper reports the development and preliminary validation of a new measure <b>of</b> reckless <b>driving</b> behaviour for young drivers. Exploratory factor analysis <b>of</b> selfreported <b>driving</b> data revealed four, conceptually distinct <b>categories</b> <b>of</b> reckless <b>driving</b> behaviour: those that increase crash-risk due to a) distractions or deficits in perception, attention or reaction time (labeled "Distracted"), b) driving under the influence of drugs or alcohol (labeled "Substance-use"), c) placing the vehicle in an unsafe environment beyond its design expectations (labeled "Extreme"), and d) speed and positioning of the vehicle relative to other vehicles and objects (labeled "Positioning"). Confirmatory factor analysis of data collected from a separate, community sample confirmed this four-factor structure. Multiple regression analyses found differences in the demographic and psychological variables related to these four factors, suggesting that interventions in one reckless driving domain may not be helpful in others.

40|$|Background: Facilitating and {{enhancing}} interaction between stakeholders {{involved in the}} policymaking process to stimulate collaboration and use of evidence, is important to foster the development of effective Health Enhancing Physical Activity (HEPA) policies. Performing an analysis of real-world policymaking processes will help reveal the complexity {{of a network of}} stakeholders. Therefore, the main objectives were to unravel the stakeholder network in the policy process by conducting three systems analyses, and to increase insight into the similarities and differences in the policy processes of these European country cases. Methods: A systems analysis of the local HEPA policymaking process was performed in three European countries involved in the 'REsearch into POlicy to enhance Physical Activity' (REPOPA) project, resulting in three schematic models showing the main stakeholders and their relationships. The models were used to compare the systems, focusing on implications with respect to collaboration and use of evidence in local HEPA policymaking. Policy documents and relevant webpages were examined and main stakeholders were interviewed. Results: The systems analysis in each country identified the main stakeholders involved and their position and relations in the policymaking process. The Netherlands and Denmark were the most similar and both differed most from Romania, especially at the level of accountability of the local public authorities for local HEPA policymaking. The <b>categories</b> <b>of</b> <b>driving</b> forces underlying the relations between stakeholders were formal relations, informal interaction and knowledge exchange. Conclusions: A systems analysis providing detailed descriptions of positions and relations in the stakeholder network in local level HEPA policymaking is rather unique in this area. The analyses are useful when a need arises for increased interaction, collaboration and use of knowledge between stakeholders in the local HEPA network, as they provide an overview of the stakeholders involved and their mutual relations. This information can be an important starting point to enhance the uptake of evidence and build more effective public health policies...|$|R

40|$|From 19 th January 2013 {{there have}} been changes in the {{operation}} of driver training centres due to the legislation regarding vehicle drivers coming into force. Changes related to the conduct <b>of</b> <b>driving</b> schools concern four major areas. The first one is a new form <b>of</b> enrolment on <b>driving</b> courses by candidates for drivers, which is done by using the so-called Profile of Candidate for Driver (PCD) generated by the county authorities. The second aspect is the new formula of the theoretical state examination. The third issue is the introduction of cash registers for the operators conducting drivers’ education. The fourth feature is the introduction <b>of</b> new <b>categories</b> <b>of</b> the <b>driving</b> license, in particular a category including two-wheeled vehicles. The existing regulations, as well as the huge competition in the market, have contributed {{to the fact that the}} activity of training of candidates for drivers has been dominated by the principle according to which the service must be performed in a cheap and fast way. It automatically translates into the low quality of training and the disregard of procedural steps associated with it. In practice, the lack of adequate control on the part of the state is the reason for the fact that driving has become an arbitrary function based on ruthless marketing and low-cost services. In this situation, ethical dilemmas arise that, in the author’s opinion, will not necessarily be resolved by the new legal standards for drivers...|$|R
40|$|Several hybrid-electric vehicle {{architectures}} {{have been}} commercialized to serve different <b>categories</b> <b>of</b> vehicles and <b>driving</b> conditions. Such architectures can be optimally controlled by switching among driving modes, namely, the power distribution schemes in their planetary gear (PG) transmissions, {{in order to}} operate the vehicle in the most efficient regions of engine and motor maps. This paper proposes a systematic way to identify the optimal architecture for a given vehicle drive cycle, rather than parametrically optimizing one or more pre-selected architectures. An automatic generator <b>of</b> feasible <b>driving</b> modes for a given number of PGs is developed. For a powertrain consisting of one engine, two motors and two PGs, this generator results in 1116 modes. A heuristic search is then proposed to find a near-optimal pair of modes for a given driving cycle and vehicle specification. In a study this process identifies a dual-mode architecture with an 8 % improvement in fuel economy compared to a commercially available architecture over a standard drive cycle. ...|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} introduces novel {{approaches to}} develop a comprehensive model to address situation awareness in the Internet of Cars, called Attention Assist Framework (AAF). The proposed framework utilizes both Low-Level Data Fusion (LLDF), and High-Level Information Fusion (HLIF) to implement traffic entity, situation, and impact assessment, as well as decision making. The Internet of Cars is the convergence of the Internet of Things and Vehicular Ad-hoc Networks (VANETs). In fact, VANETs are the communication platforms that make possible {{the implementation of the}} Internet of Cars, and has {{become an integral part of}} this research field due to its major role to improve vehicle and road safety, traffic efficiency, and convenience as well as comfort to both drivers and passengers. Significant amount of VANETs research work has been focused on specific areas such as safety, routing, broadcasting, Quality of Service (QoS), and security. Among them, road safety issues are deemed one of the most challenging problems of VANETs. Specifically, lack of proper situational awareness of drivers has been shown to be the main cause of road accidents which makes it a major factor in road safety. The traffic entity assessment relies on a LLDF framework that is able to incorporate various multi-sensor data fusion approaches with means of communication links in VANETs. This is used to implement a cooperative localization approach through fusing common data fusion methods, such as Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) and Unscented Transform (UT), and vehicle-to-vehicle communication in VANETs. Furthermore, traffic situation assessment is based on a fuzzy extension to the Multi-Entity Bayesian Networks (MEBNs), which exploit the expressiveness of first-order logic for semantic relations, and the strength of the Fuzzy Bayesian Networks in handling uncertainty, while tackling the inherent vagueness in the soft data created by human entities. Finally, the impact assessment and decision making is realized through incorporating notions of game theory into Fuzzy-MEBNs, and introducing Active Fuzzy-MEBN (ATFY-MEBN), which is capable in hypothesizing future situations by assessing the impact of the current situation upon taking the actions indicated by an optimal strategy. In fact, such strategies are achieved through solving the games that are generated through a novel situation-specific normal form games generation algorithm that aims to create games based on the given context. In general, ATFY-MEBN presents the concepts of players and actions, and includes new game components, along with a 2 -tier architecture, to efficiently model impact assessment and decision making. To demonstrate the capabilities of the proposed framework, a collision warning system simulator is developed, which evaluates the likelihood of a vehicle being in a near-collision situation using a wide variety of both local and global information sources available in the VANETs environment, and suggests an optimal action by assessing the impact of the current situation through generating and solving situation-specific games. Accordingly, first, the entities that highly influence the safety aspect, as well as both their casual and semantic relationships are identified. Next, an ATFY-MEBN-based model is presented, which allows for modeling these entities along with their relationships in specific contexts, assessing the current states of the situations of interest, predicting their future states, and finally suggesting optimal decision. Therefore, if the likelihood of being in a near-collision situation is determined to be high, and if the relevant situation-specific game is generated, then the impact of deciding on different combinations of actions that the game players take are calculated through a pre-fixed payoff function. Finally, the completed game is solved by finding its dominant strategy, that subsequently, results in proposing the optimal action to the driver. Our experimental results are divided into three main sections, through which we evaluate the capabilities of the traffic entity, situation, and impact assessment methods. Accordingly, the performance of the proposed cooperative localization approach is assessed by comparing its results with the ground truth solution and that of the other localization methods in various driving test cases. Moreover, two distinct single-vehicle and multi-vehicles <b>categories</b> <b>of</b> <b>driving</b> scenarios, as well as a novel hybrid MEBN inference, demonstrate the capabilities of the proposed traffic assessment model to efficiently achieve situation and threat assessment on the road. Finally, the impact assessment and decision making models are evaluated through two different scenarios <b>of</b> <b>driving</b> in highway and intersection that are formed with various number of player vehicles, and their actions...|$|R

40|$|Background and objective: Several {{medicines}} {{are known}} to potentially impair patients' driving fitness. Appropriate communication towards patients about this risk can be supported {{by the use of}} package warning labels. The objective was to compare the effectiveness of a standing practice yellow/black label -with written warning- with a newly developed rating model in communicating risk on driving-impairing medicines (DIMs). Furthermore, the added value of a side-text in the rating model was determined. Setting and method: In a cross-sectional study in the Netherlands, patients with a first dispensing of a DIM were asked by their community pharmacists (n = 38) to fill out a written questionnaire to compare each of the three warning labels. A 2 (yellow/black label vs. rating model (pair 1) and rating model with side-text vs. rating model without side-text (pair 2)) × 3 (<b>category</b> <b>of</b> driving-impairment: I = minor risk, II = moderate risk, III = severe risk) design was used. The <b>category</b> <b>of</b> driving-impairment varied per respondent, depending on the DIM the patient collected. Main outcome measures: (1) estimated level <b>of</b> <b>driving</b> risk valued by patients (2) intention to change driving behaviour after seeing the warning label. Results: An estimated number of 992 patients were approached. As 298 questionnaires were analysed, the net response rate was 30 %. With the yellow/ black label, respondents considered DIMs <b>of</b> all three <b>categories</b> <b>of</b> drivingimpairment to equally impair driving fitness, while with the rating model the estimated risk was higher when the category referred to a higher level of driving-impairment. Addition of a side-text to the rating model resulted in a significantly higher estimated level <b>of</b> <b>driving</b> risk and a significant increase in intention to change driving behaviour. Only 8. 0 % of the patients using a category III DIM estimated the level <b>of</b> <b>driving</b> risk correctly when seeing the yellow/black label, while this was 26. 7 % for the rating model and 43. 0 % for the rating model with side-text. Conclusions: The yellow/black label, which is standing practice in the Netherlands, is less effective in terms of estimated risk and intention to change driving behaviour, compared to a newly developed rating model. This model is even more effective when a side-text is added. Implementation of the rating model in clinical practice should be considered...|$|R

The three-dimensional simulation model <b>of</b> <b>driving</b> shaft’s connecting thread has been developed based on the principle of virtual work, Von Mises yield criterion, and contact nonlinear theory. This article has put forward the plan to optimize structure <b>of</b> <b>driving</b> shaft with straight thread based on the design principle of double-shouldered thread; besides, fatigue life <b>of</b> <b>driving</b> shaft with straight thread before and after optimization has been assessed by resorting to the multiaxial fatigue principle and Brown–Miller critical plane rule. In line with research results, mechanical properties <b>of</b> <b>driving</b> shaft with straight thread are superior to those <b>of</b> <b>driving</b> shaft with taper thread. Under the load of axial drill pressure with fluctuation and alternating torque, fatigue life <b>of</b> <b>driving</b> shaft with straight thread after optimization is greatly improved. This article has not only provided basis for optimizing connecting thread <b>of</b> <b>driving</b> shaft but also boasts of high engineering value for improving service life of positive displacement motor...|$|R

40|$|Background Several {{medicines}} {{are known}} to potentially impair patients' driving fitness. Appropriate communication towards patients about this risk can be supported {{by the use of}} package warning labels. Objective To compare the effectiveness of a standing practice yellow/black label-with written warning-with a newly developed rating model in communicating risk on driving-impairing medicines (DIMs). Furthermore, the added value of a side-text in the rating model was determined. Setting Community pharmacies in the Netherlands. Method In a cross-sectional study, patients with a first dispensing of a DIM were asked by their community pharmacists (n = 38) to fill out a written questionnaire to compare each of the three warning labels. A 2 [yellow/black label vs. rating model (pair 1) and rating model with side-text vs. rating model without side-text (pair 2) ] x 3 [category of driving-impairment: I = minor risk, II = moderate risk, III = severe risk] design was used. The <b>category</b> <b>of</b> driving-impairment varied per respondent, depending on the DIM the patient collected. Main outcome measure: (1) estimated level <b>of</b> <b>driving</b> risk valued by patients (2) intention to change driving behaviour after seeing the warning label. Results An estimated number of 992 patients were approached. As 298 questionnaires were analysed, the net response rate was 30 %. With the yellow/black label, respondents considered DIMs <b>of</b> all three <b>categories</b> <b>of</b> driving-impairment to equally impair driving fitness, while with the rating model the estimated risk was higher when the category referred to a higher level of driving-impairment. Addition of a side-text to the rating model resulted in a significantly higher estimated level <b>of</b> <b>driving</b> risk and a significant increase in intention to change driving behaviour. Only 8. 0 % of the patients using a category III DIM estimated the level <b>of</b> <b>driving</b> risk correctly when seeing the yellow/black label, while this was 26. 7 % for the rating model and 43. 0 % for the rating model with side-text. Conclusion The yellow/black label, which is standing practice in the Netherlands, is less effective in terms of estimated risk and intention to change driving behaviour, compared to a newly developed rating model. This model is even more effective when a side-text is added. Implementation of the rating model in clinical practice should be considered...|$|R
40|$|AbstractFundamental {{results of}} Tannaka duality include the {{reconstruction}} of a coalgebra in the <b>category</b> <b>of</b> vector spaces from its <b>category</b> <b>of</b> representations equipped with the forgetful functor, and the characterization <b>of</b> those <b>categories</b> equipped with a functor into the <b>category</b> <b>of</b> vector spaces which are equivalent to the <b>category</b> <b>of</b> representations of some coalgebra. This paper generalizes these results by replacing the <b>category</b> <b>of</b> vector spaces by an arbitrary monoidal category and replacing coalgebras by their several-object analogue. Applications include providing sufficient conditions on a small R-linear category to ensure that its <b>category</b> <b>of</b> presheaves {{is equivalent to the}} <b>category</b> <b>of</b> representations of some R-coalgebra. In particular we construct an R-coalgebra whose <b>category</b> <b>of</b> representations is equivalent to the <b>category</b> <b>of</b> chain complexes over R...|$|R
40|$|Gear {{rattle of}} {{multi-step}} helical gear system is treated. Mesh stiffness variations and higher harmonics <b>of</b> <b>driving</b> torque are {{considered in the}} system. The effects of higher harmonics <b>of</b> <b>driving</b> torque are studied by numerical analysis. As a result, the followings were made clear. (1) In the resonance region of lower mode, when the frequency <b>of</b> <b>driving</b> torque is nearly equal to the one which is the natural frequency of higher mode divided by some integer, the response contains the higher mode and its amplitude of acceleration becomes large. However this phenomenon is not so affected by the higher harmonics <b>of</b> <b>driving</b> torque. (2) First harmonic <b>of</b> <b>driving</b> torque generates higher harmonic resonance and higher harmonic <b>of</b> <b>driving</b> torque generates the main resonance, hence the interaction of these two resonances makes the amplitude of the resonance large. (3) Because of interaction of higher harmonics <b>of</b> <b>driving</b> torque and mesh stiffness variation, resonances like gear noise occur with many side-bands in low frequency region, and {{the region of the}} rattles becomes wide. (4) Gear rattles in the case of small constant torque are almost chaos, and chaos by intermittency is recognized...|$|R
