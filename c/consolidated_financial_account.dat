40|$|Since {{the start}} of 2005 all European Union (EU) firms trading in a {{regulated}} market are required to adopt International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) for their <b>consolidated</b> <b>financial</b> <b>accounts.</b> Many more countries will - soon or later - follow suit and adopt IFRS for all listed firms. Nonetheless, the process of conversion from domestic standards to IFRS can often cause confusion for both preparers and user groups. This study investigates {{the impact of the}} mandatory conversion to IFRS on the Net Income of some of the largest firms in the EU - specifically, the constituents of the FTSEurofirst 80 index. The sample for the present work comprises those 37 constituents of the FTSEurofirst 80 index which: (i) are first time adopters of IFRS and (ii) had, at the sample selection date, voluntarily revealed their 2004 annual Net Income figures under both national standards and IFRS. Our results show that the conversion to IFRS leads to a statistically significant increase in 2004 Net Income and for nearly 75 % of sample firms we find that the increase is material at the 5 % level. Additional analysis reveals that IFRS 3 (Business Combinations) dwarfs all other international standards in terms of driving the observed differences between reported Net Income under domestic GAAP and IFRS for our sample firms. 7 page(s...|$|R

The disclosure and individual fair value accounting exemptions provided in IFRS 5 (AC 142) for subsidiaries acquired exclusively with a view to resale should save costs and effort in the consolidation of these subsidiaries.

40|$|Aggressive tax {{planning}} efforts of highly profitable multinational companies (Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS)) have recently become {{the subject of}} intense public debate. As a response, several international initiatives and parties have called for more transparency in financial reporting, especially {{by means of a}} country-specific reporting of certain tax information (Country-by-Country Reporting (CbCR)). In our paper, we demonstrate that neither <b>consolidated</b> nor individual <b>financial</b> <b>accounts</b> seem to be an appropriate platform to provide such country-specific information and, therefore, that CbCR cannot be based on extended <b>financial</b> <b>accounting</b> standards. Moreover, we argue that even separate CbCR templates do not prevent multinationals from profit shifting, since their common tax minimization strategies are mainly based on the legal exploitation of gaps and loopholes in national and international tax law. In that regard, we show that expected costs for CbCR would exceed expected benefits and therefore contend that CbCR cannot be regarded as a convincing measure to combat international profit shifting. Instead, we argue that tax legislators should limit profit shifting by enforcing national and international tax rules and by closing gaps in tax law. In particular, we call for more tightened and standardized transfer pricing regulations to be adopted at an international level...|$|R

40|$|Financial statementsn# 8217; main {{objective}} is to give information on the financial position, performance and changes in financial position of the reporting entity, which is useful to investors and other users in making economic decisions. In order to be useful, financial information needs to be relevant to the decision-making process of users in general, and investors in particular. Regarding <b>consolidated</b> <b>financial</b> statements, the <b>accounting</b> theory knows four perspectives (theories) on which the preparation of those statements is based, namely, the proprietary theory, the parent company theory, the parent company extension theory and the entity theory (Baxter and Spinney, 1975). Of practical importance are especially the parent company extension perspective and the entity perspective. The IASB and FASB decided (within an ED regarding the Improvement of the Conceptual Framework) that <b>consolidated</b> <b>financial</b> statements should be presented {{from the perspective of}} the group entity, and not {{from the perspective of the}} parent-company. However, this support for the entity theory is to our knowledge not backed by empirical findings in the academic literature. Therefore, in our paper we set to contribute with empirical arguments to finding an actual answer to the question about the superior market value relevance of one of the two concurrent perspectives (theories). We set to carry out an empirical association study on the problem of market value relevance of <b>consolidated</b> <b>financial</b> statements based on the entity theory respectively on the parent company (extension) theory, searching for an answer to the above question. In this sense, we pursued an analysis of market value relevance of consolidated accounting information (based on the two perspectives) of listed entities between 2003 - 2008 on the largest three European Stock Exchanges (London, Paris and Frankfurt). The obtained results showed that a n# 8222;restrainedn# 8221; entity perspective, which would combine elements of entity theory (by focusing on the whole group equity) and elements of parent company extension theory (by focusing on income corresponding to majority interest), would have a superior relevance compared to the classical versions of the two mentioned perspectives...|$|R

Only fully fledged <b>financial</b> <b>accounting</b> and reporting systems guarantee the consolidated information needed by executive and legislative bodies to fulfil their duties in financial management and the supervision of network entities. <b>Consolidated</b> <b>financial</b> statements may serve to increase accountability and transparency towards internal and external stakeholders. The article aims at giving an overview of consolidation approaches in Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries. It will focus on the methods applied and the guiding principles followed to define the perimeter of consolidation. The analysis is carried out through a comparison of legal requirements and standards for consolidation, and the published <b>consolidated</b> <b>financial</b> statements, taking the International Public Sector Accounting Standards as a benchmark. Points for practitioners: The analysis of consolidation practice in Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries reveals that while the use of <b>consolidated</b> <b>financial</b> statements is increasing, there are still significant deviations from the perspective of international accounting standards.

However, to exclude the possibility that macroeconomic effects are driving our results, we include as a control group private firms that release their financial statements under IFRS.
