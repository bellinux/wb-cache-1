40|$|The article {{presents}} a user interface for modelling of textile composites, which combines open XML {{input and output}} formats with scripting for definitions of the reinforcement models under (local) shear, tension and compression deformations.

The scripting <b>command</b> <b>format</b> makes possible automated processing of the information on local reinforcement deformation conditions, and offers itself to be integrated in user software without accessing or knowing internal computational procedures or native data formats of meso-level textile processor. The open output format allows transferring {{the results of the}} meso-level textile processor downstream to meso-level models of the micromechanics or the permeability of a textile composite unit cell.

40|$|Simulation {{programs}} frequently need a {{large amount}} of input data. Code dealing with reading input data and initializing data structures can be very tedious to write, especially if the data are to be defined in graphical interfaces. Quite often, managing input demands much more lines of code than the mathematical calculations involved in the simulations. When using general-purpose frameworks, the idea is that the application code should be short, but this is often difficult because managing input may still require a huge effort. Hence, a tool for simplifying this task is needed such that the application programmer quickly can put together pieces of code that handle all aspects of supplying data to the program. Throughout this thesis, we will describe the use, architecture, design and implementation of the tool that addresses these challenges. The result is a framework called DataPool that can greatly simplify the creation of user interfaces in simulation programs. It is distributed as a ready-to-use, highly configurable Python package with extensive documentation both for users and developers. This package is intended for anyone that needs a framework with support for easy creation of user interfaces to simulation programs. Many types of user interfaces can be automatically generated by a minimum of code: highly interactive web pages, command line options, XML file input, or a plain text <b>command</b> <b>format.</b> Keywords: computational science, data input, Django, menu system, Python, simulation and visualization, user interface, web application...|$|E
40|$|This work {{focuses on}} a {{methodology}} to help bring many of our database artifacts and prototypes to reside {{on the top of}} a common workbench platform that leads to uniformity and removes overlap across different subsystems. A versatile <b>command</b> <b>format</b> has been developed to allow commands belonging to different subsystems to be interleaved in the same batch unambiguously. Through a collaborative effort carried on in parallel, existing GUIs (Graphical User Interfaces) have also been merged into a common, but simple GUI. The GUI executes a batch of commands. Subsystem currently included are: a runner for SQL on a variety of database platforms, a runner for Quilt queries (Quilt is an early version of XQuery and runs on a platform called KWEELT), ElementalDB, an experimental database system used for instruction in a graduate database implementation course, our own XQuery engine which aims at handling data in terabyte range stored in our storage in paginated form using our pagination algorithm, a research prototype for NC 94, an important spatiotemporal data set in agriculture, and a research prototype for a temporal database. The organization of the subsystems follows strict convention for ease of further development and maintenance. XML is used extensively by various subsystems. An XML based framework has been developed for benchmarking subsystems to make experiments completely repeatable at click of a button starting from creation of storage, loading of data sets, execution of commands, collecting performance data in XML-based logs to reporting using XQuery queries on the XML logs. With a very small learning curve, the resulting workbench can be used by students, instructors, developers and researchers alike and managed easily...|$|E
40|$|International Telemetering Conference Proceedings / October 25 - 28, 1999 / Riviera Hotel and Convention Center, Las Vegas, NevadaL- 3 Communications Telemetry & Instrumentation (L- 3 T&I) has {{developed}} an advanced IBM PC-AT Telemetry, Tracking, and Commanding (TT&C) SATCOM system based on the utilization of Field Programmable Gate Array / Digital Signal Processing (FPGA/DSP) microprocessors. This system includes up-link, down-link, and range processing sections. Physically, the system consists of one IF Transceiver and two or more FPGA/DSP microprocessor boards called Advanced Processing Microprocessors (APMs). The form factor of these PWBs is compliant with full length, full height IBM PC PCI bus cards. This paper describes the features and functionality of an advanced Telemetry, Tracking, and Commanding Processing System (TT&CPS) based on the implementation of FPGA and DSP microprocessors. The high-level functional attributes of the TT&CPS are depicted in Figure 1. There are four main functional blocks: the IF Transceiver, the Down-Link Processing Section, the Up-Link Processing Section, and the Range Processor. The analog/IF circuitry in the IF Transceiver card interfaces between the 68 – 72 MHz (70 MHz, nominal) IF I/O signals and the Up-Link and Down-Link Processing Section's DSP equipment. The down-link portion of the IF Transceiver card has two user-selected input ports. From the selected input, the signal is processed through selectable bandwidth limiting, gain control, Doppler correction (optional), quadrature down-conversion to zero hertz (baseband), selectable baseband filtering, and precision Analog-to-Digital (A/D) conversion. The up-link portion of the IF Transceiver card takes I/Q digital data from the APM performing the up-link processing functions. This baseband I/Q digital data is Digital-to-Analog (D/A) converted, filtered, quadrature up-converted to 68 – 72 MHz, up-link Doppler corrected (optional), output level detected and level controlled, and sent to a two-position output selector switch. The down-link portion of the TT&CPS provides main carrier linear PM or BPSK or QPSK demodulation and can also, in composite linear PM demodulation mode, receive and demodulate FSK and/or BPSK subcarriers and ranging signals. The demodulators use symbol timing loops and bit decision circuits (matched filters) to perform the bit synchronization function. Several decoding algorithms, including differential, de-interleaving, Viterbi, and Reed-Solomon, are available for the down-link telemetry. <b>Command</b> <b>format</b> checking and CRC status is also available on FSK-demodulated data. Direct carrier BPSK/QPSK demodulation has decoding and frame synchronization capabilities. Because of the modular construction of the firmware {{and the use of}} FPGAs and DSPs, the system can be loaded with only the functions in use, lowering initial setup time while increasing overall system capability. To support a particular function, the card is downloaded with an “image,” which programs the FPGAs and DSPs at initialization. The user can change configurations by simply downloading a new set of instructions to the FPGA/DSP on the fly to keep the ground station running with minimal downtime. The flexibility of the design minimizes spare board costs, while achieving greater programmability at the end-user location...|$|E

Specifically, we use the convolutional neural network (CNN) to recognize gestures and makes it attainable to identify relatively complex gestures using only one cheap monocular camera. We introduce the Kalman filter to estimate the hand position based on which the mouse cursor control is realized in a stable and smooth way. During the HCI stage, we develop a simple strategy to avoid the false recognition caused by noises - mostly transient, false gestures, and thus to improve the reliability of interaction.
