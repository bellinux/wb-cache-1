40|$|To better {{understand}} the mechanisms of moisture transport in fibrous structures This project was initiated on March 1, 1995, to {{better understand}} the mechanisms of moisture transport in fibrous structures. Techniques are being developed to spatially define the unit cells in textile structures and to measure noninvasively the spatial distribution of moisture content in engineered fibrous structures. The results of preliminary investigations have indicated that nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) imaging can be used to measure moisture distributions in carpet as a function of time and to define the unit cell structure of carpet. Optical microscopy coupled with quantitative sterology is also being used to define the unit cell structure of <b>carpet.</b> <b>Tests</b> are being conducted on an experimental flow-through dryer which was designed in a previous NTC project to measure drying rates for air-steam fluid mixtures over a range of possible compositions and environmental conditions, ranging from ambient humidity to pure super heated steam as the drying medium. The flow-through drying results will be used with the transport mechanisms and unit cells identified in our research to model flow-through drying of carpet...|$|R
40|$|This work {{examines}} how the individual variations of row spacing, {{as well as}} the presence of cushions, carpet and occupants, combine to influence the absorption characteristics of church pews as a function of sample perimeter-to-area (P/A) ratios. Scale models were used to measure the interactive effects of the four test variables on church pew absorption characteristics. The effects of row spacing on frequency-averaged pew absorption coefficients (5002 ̆ 0134 kHz) were generally quite small and were smallest for pews without cushions. The variations of absorption increments with varied row spacing tended to be smallest when the pews were less absorptive, i. e. with less cushions, carpet or occupants, similar to the previously studied model theatre chairs. Resonant absorption effects seem to influence the measured absorption of the model pews in the 125 and 250 Hz octave bands and these effects are expected to be modified by the height of the pew backs and the spacing between pews. The incremental absorption coefficients of adding absorptive materials, such as carpet or cushions, to the pews were different than the absorption characteristics of cushions or <b>carpet</b> <b>tested</b> independent of the pews, and these differences varied with frequency. Using the resulting absorption coefficients calculated for each block of pews in a church as input to a room acoustics computer model is expected to provide the best currently possible predictions of acoustical conditions.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to adapt an {{existing}} methodology, the brine shrimp lethality bioassay, for use in predicting the potential for carpeting to contribute to poor indoor air quality. New carpet has frequently been cited as a source which caused deterioration of the indoor air quality. The volatile organic compounds that off-gas from the carpeting have been thought to be the primary source of this deterioration. To date, several methods have been used to characterized the volatile organic compound emissions from carpeting but, there has only been one bioassay test adapted to evaluate the irritancy or toxic potential of carpeting. A bioassay originally developed for natural product extract toxicity testing which uses brine shrimp as the test organism was investigated for applicability to environmental toxicity testing. The brine shrimp lethality bioassay would provide a second assay that could evaluate the irritancy or toxic potential of carpeting. ^ Representative carpet samples were obtained from areas with occupants experiencing poor indoor air quality and from areas where occupants were not expressing complaints. Residues extracted from <b>carpets</b> were <b>tested</b> for toxicity using the brine shrimp lethality bioassay. A residue was considered to be toxic if the LC 50 was less than 1000 parts per million of residue. Toxicity was found in residues extracted in hexane and ethanol from seven of nine <b>carpet</b> samples <b>tested.</b> The seven <b>carpets</b> that had the brine shrimp active residues were nylons. Five of the seven carpets had been associated with complaints about the indoor air quality that resulted after the carpets were installed. The brine shrimp lethality bioassay was further used to provide direction for the separation and isolation of the brine shrimp active compound from two of the carpet samples. The bioactive compound was isolated from the ethanol residues by means of HPLC separation techniques. The isolated compound was identified as dodecylbenzenesulfonic acid by a series of chemical identification tests which included IR, probe MS, and NMR analyses techniques. Thus, the brine shrimp lethality bioassay was successfully used to determine potential toxicity of carpeting components and to identify one of the components responsible for the toxicity. ...|$|R

It was found that the effects of environmental conditions on sorption were insignificant for the painted drywall due to its weak sink strength as compared to the experimental uncertainty. The effect of relative humidity was generally small on the sorption of most compounds on ceiling tiles and carpet. However, the increase of temperature and air velocity may affect the amount of VOCs adsorbed by the ceiling tiles and carpet...|$|R
40|$|The carpet {{industry}} and their suppliers have noted {{a loss of}} market share in commercial settings such as schools and hospitals {{over the past several}} years. This has occurred most notably in the southeastern U. S. where humidity is high and environmental conditions support the growth of mold and mildew. It was estimated in 1999 that the carpet industry was losing an estimated $ 2 million annually due to the perceived relationship between soft floor coverings and an increase in the presence of mold, mildew and illnesses. The paper serves as a review of the current literature on microorganisms in the indoor environment and the impact of carpet on their presence. Much of the research completed in this area has focused on allergens of dust mites, cockroaches, and pet dander. However, there is limited information on microorganisms cultured from indoor air samples, which is the focus of this review. The information is presented in three sections: 1) a discussion of allergens and pathogens that are linked with allergies, illness and infections, 2) a general overview of microorganisms and antimicrobial chemicals, specifically the finishing of textiles and 3) <b>carpet</b> related <b>testing</b> to reduce the presence of microorganisms in carpets...|$|R

Two questionnaires were developed to obtain the data. One questionnaire was designed to elicit public opinion regarding carpeting in general and its use in specific locations. A second questionnaire was developed to gather information about environmental changes that may have been observed or experienced by people working in carpeted offices. The sample for Questionnaire # 1 included 100 people who visited a suite of offices which were carpeted for this experiment. Questionnaire # 2 involved 32 college employees who had worked in both carpeted and uncarpeted offices. Two laboratory tests were conducted to determine the projected performance of selected characteristics of the <b>test</b> <b>carpeting.</b> Samples were <b>tested</b> for color fastness to light and pile recovery. The results of this study indicated that people liked and approved of the use of carpeting in public buildings in specific locations. These included general offices and school administration offices.

40|$|With the {{increases}} {{of the expected}} properties of textile products, better and advanced new designs are being created. Textiles used in vehicles are increasing, and the current performance of the expectations bar is determined by automobile manufacturers. While meeting the expectations of users in the vehicle mechanically, but also disturbing the user during operation of the mechanical properties of this ratio should be minimized. This study was intended to minimize sound transmission of nonwoven textile components, which are used in cars as silencer parts. For that purpose, four different models were developed in this study. First model consists of three designs for baggage carpets. Second model has six designs for floor coverings. Third model comprises two designs inner dash felt and finally fourth model includes two designs of hood liners. The acoustical absorption coefficients and transmission loss of these <b>carpets</b> were <b>tested</b> and evaluated in the frequency range of 16 - 6300 Hz. The measurements demonstrated that nonwoven layer is a very significant and effective part of a carpet due to its contribution in the sound isolation. With this study, it has been determined which layer has better performance on sound absorption and transmission loss among different carpet types.

40|$|Many dike {{failures}} {{have been}} ignited by damage due to erosion on the landward slopes. This paper investigates how grass covered slopes perform when {{being attacked by}} overtopping flow during storm surges. Based on observations during a number of simulator tests, damage is classified into three types 'head-cut', 'roll-up' and 'collapse' depending on the combination of grass, material components and corresponding layer thickness. To quantitatively predict the potential types, strength ratio and thickness ratio are proposed. Besides, erosion usually starts at weak spots so their spatial distributions are evaluated along dike stretches with various lengths. Finally, the overtopping resistance of a grass turf is presumably represented by critical velocities depending on soil cohesion and apparent cohesion induced by roots. The computed results are comparable to erosion on Bermuda and <b>Carpet</b> grass slopes <b>tested</b> with the simulator. Hydraulic EngineeringCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{offers a}} {{social history of}} Alexander Morton & Company's Donegal carpets [...] their {{production}} and patronage. These nineteenth-century carpets were promoted as artistic products and appealed to upper- and middle-class consumers in Britain, Ireland, North America, Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa. The new carpet industry, based in Ireland, catered to the popular taste for all things Oriental and to the socialist ideals of the Arts and Crafts Movement (1850 - 1920). Donegal carpet designs ranged from Eastern motifs to Arts and Crafts florals to Celtic interlace. Prominent designers in the Arts and Crafts Movement created designs for these carpets which were also accepted {{as part of the}} visual arts of the Celtic Revival in Ireland. The Donegal carpet's success can be explained using Pierre Bourdieu's theory concerning the social formation of taste. In this study of Morton's Donegal <b>carpets,</b> I <b>test</b> the validity of three aspects of Bourdieu's theory: habitus, cultural codes, and symbolic capital. Archival material, press accounts and historical writing reveal several issues involved in this enterprise,' such as ethnicity, gender, class and cultural appropriation, These issues are addressed in an examination of this literature as well as the design transitions endorsed by Morton & Co. Ultimately, this study is an attempt to locate the Donegal carpets within the material and ideological conditions of consumption and production.

[...] The colour and graphic scheme are based on the U.K. version and all stickers have been redrawn as a direct copy of the original artwork. However, the replica differs in several ways from the original. 1) The circular hatch on the original was removable, to allow access to the 9v battery powering the electronics. On the replica, this hatch is fixed shut as the 9v battery is no longer used. 2) The main electronics circuit board is completely different, with surface-mount components and a different processor chip and software. 3) Motor rotation is detected by rotating magnets fitted to the motors, and hall-effect detectors on the circuit board - the original used optical detectors. 4) The original used an incandescent light bulb; the replica uses an LED. 5) The original used 4 x 'D' cell batteries and a 9v PP3 battery; the replica just uses 3 x 'D' cells. Since the initial release of the replica, a second version has been introduced, the differences being in the test program and the power switch. Version 1 has a single-position power switch, either on or off, whereas version 2 has a 3-position power switch, centre off, forward for use on carpets, back for use on smooth floors. This affects the stall-detection in the electronics, as the original version seems to have been designed to run on smooth floors, and easily stalls when attempting to turn on <b>carpet.</b> The <b>test</b> program for version 1 runs the unit forwards, pauses, then runs backwards; in version 2, the model runs forward, then turns 180 degrees, runs forward again, then backs up a little.|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Disturbed {{indoor climate}} may {{in some cases}} be {{associated}} with illness. In the present paper, we report the results from a thorough investigation of office workers in Greenland, who developed skin and/or airway problems after moving into renewed offices. Material and methods: In 2009 {{the office of the}} Bank of Greenland had a total renovation of the building, including new furniture and carpets. Symptoms developed within the first year after moving back into the renewed buildings. After removal of carpets in the building, symptoms significantly improved. Workers were examined in 2009 and re-examined in 2013, including clinical examination, patch test and when relevant also skin prick tests and histamine release test. Isothiazolinones and fumarates, both able to cause airway as well as skin symptoms, were isolated from <b>carpets</b> before <b>testing,</b> and included in the test series. Results: In total, 32 out of 80 workers (40 %) developed symptoms; 27 reported eczema, 20 rhinitis and 4 urticaria. Eczema was located on the hands and/or lower arms in 18 workers, on the face in 10 workers and on legs/trunk in 12 workers. After intervention in the office, 22 workers with eczema reported significant improvement, all cases of hand eczema cleared and 16 workers with rhinitis also improved. Positive patch <b>tests</b> to <b>carpet</b> extracts were found significantly more frequent in the worker cohort than in a control group comprising 47 dermatitis patients (p< 0. 001). Only few workers reacted with a positive response to skin prick test or in the HR test, no obvious pattern in reactions was found, and no conclusions can be made from these reactions. Conclusion: The results indicate that the reported symptoms are related to exposures from the building after renovation in 2009. A specific triggering exposure could not be identified, although chemicals from the glued carpets are suspected. The study {{is an example of a}} work place investigation, and illustrates the diversity of symptoms and exposures involved in “Sick Building” cases...|$|R
40|$|Objectives; We {{previously}} {{developed a}} historical reconstruction model to estimate exposure to airborne {{polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons}} (PAHs) from traffic back to 1960 for use in case–control studies of breast cancer risk. Here we report the results of four exercises to validate and calibrate the model. Methods; Model predictions of benzo[a]pyrene (BaP) concentration in soil and <b>carpet</b> dust were <b>tested</b> against measurements collected at subjects’ homes at interview. In addition, predictions of air intake of BaP were compared with blood PAH–DNA adducts. These same soil, carpet, and blood measurements were used for model optimization. In a separate test of the meteorological dispersion part of the model, predictions of hourly concentrations of carbon monoxide from traffic were compared with data collected at a U. S. Environmental Protection Agency monitoring station. Results; The data for soil, PAH–DNA adducts, and carbon monoxide concentrations were all consistent with model predictions. The carpet dust data were inconsistent, suggesting possible spatial confounding with PAH-containing contamination tracked in from outdoors or unmodeled cooking sources. BaP was found proportional to other PAHs in our soil and dust data, making it reasonable to use BaP historical data as a surrogate for other PAHs. Road intersections contributed 40 – 80 % of both total emissions and average exposures, suggesting that the repertoire of simple markers of exposure, such as traffic counts and/or distance to nearest road, needs to be expanded to include distance to nearest intersectio...|$|R

The amounts of the added cyclis rubber were varied from 10 to 40 phr with range of 10 phr. The rubber carpet compound was produced by using a two roll-mills (Shanghai RMW, model XK- 160, capacity 2 kg). The culcanizate properties of rubber <b>carpet</b> compound were <b>tested</b> base on SNI. 12 - 1000 - 1989 for karpet karet, and ASTM F. 1859 - 2000 for rubber sheet floor covering without backing The results showed that cyclis rubber in the compound was focused as a filler.

40|$|The {{indoor air}} quality (IAQ) of a {{building}} can be significantly affected by the building materials. Porous building materials are not only sources of indoor air pollutants such as volatile organic compounds (VOC) but also strong sinks of those pollutants. The knowledge of VOC transfer mechanisms in these materials {{is an important step}} for controlling the indoor VOC concentration levels, and for determining the optimum ventilation requirements for acceptable IAQ. This study has investigated theoretically VOC source and sink behavior of porous building materials. A novel analytical model was developed based on the fundamental theories of mass transfer mechanisms in porous materials. The proposed model considers both primary and secondary source/sink behavior for the first time. The former refers to the transfer of gas-phase and/or physically adsorbed VOC, while the latter is generation or elimination of VOC within the solid due to chemical reactions like oxidation, hydrolysis, chemical adsorption, etc. The proposed model was assessed with experimental data, namely emission <b>tests</b> of <b>carpets</b> and sorption <b>tests</b> of wood chipboard. It was demonstrated that the proposed analytical model could simultaneously account for the effect of air velocity on both VOC source and sink behavior unlike the existing analytical models. A parametric study was carried out to investigate the effects of air velocity and material properties including diffusion coefficient, sorption partition coefficient, porosity, thickness and length on the primary VOC source/sink behavior, and these effects were quantified. Due to the lack of knowledge on the secondary source/sink behavior, five hypothetical cases were considered, and the model predictions agree with experimental findings on the secondary emissions available in the literature. The validity of four main assumptions imposed on the developed analytical model, was investigated through the development of numerical conjugate mass transfer models. The considered assumptions are (1) constant VOC concentration at the solid-fluid interface along the solid plate length; (2) quasi-steady convection mass transfer in fluid; (3) one-dimensional diffusion in solid; and (4) Henry (linear) sorption isotherm. The limits of the proposed analytical model due to each of the mentioned assumptions were clearly defined hence providing a range for the validity of the novel analytical model...|$|R

Limited information is known about the appearance and behavior of blood or semen stains collected from fire scenes. The {{purpose of this study is}} to observe the effects of high temperatures and flame exposure on blood and semen stains using current traditional presumptive (phenolphthalein, AP Spot test and ALS fluorescence) and confirmatory (ABAcard® Hematrace®, microscopic identification of spermatozoa and RSIDTM-Semen) testing methods. Liquid blood and semen was applied to swatches of denim, synthetic leather and carpet, and allowed to dry. In Part I of this study, the stains were exposed for various amounts of time to 130 °C, 150 °C, 170 °C and 190 °C using a laboratory oven. When bloodstains were exposed to high temperatures,   reaction times using phenolphthalein increased and only bloodstains on denim were undetected within one minute at the most extreme conditions. Scraping was determined to be a better collection method than swabbing to test samples exposed to higher temperatures, and some samples required longer than the typical 10 - 15 second time frame used by most forensic labs to yield a positive reaction. Detection of human hemoglobin using ABAcard® Hematrace® was not possible after 1 hour at 130 °C, making it a less sensitive test for bloodstains exposed to high temperatures than phenolphthalein. Semen stains exhibited fluorescence using an alternate light source after limited exposure to all temperatures, but more successfully on denim and synthetic leather than on <b>carpet.</b> AP Spot <b>test</b> was successful on all semen stains on synthetic leather, and on a number of samples on denim and carpet. Microscopic identification of sperm was most successful on denim but became impossible at higher temperatures and exposure times.

Additionally, as temperature increased, semen stains darkened in color and appeared visually similar to bloodstains. [TRUNCATED...|$|R
40|$|The {{phenomenon}} of wave overtopping during storms was simulated by the Wave Overtopping Simulator on a 1 / 15 grass covered slope. The four 'Wave Overtopping Simulator' tests were done {{within the framework}} of the Research project 'Super sea dike with high safety level and environmental friendly' funded by Viet Nam government. The main objective of these tests was to test the resistance of the gentle slope (steepness of 1 / 15) protected with local grass against wave overtopping with the Wave Overtopping Simulator. The super dike model was built up at the outdoor laboratory of the Viet Nam academy for water resources, in Yen Binh ward, Thach That district, Ha Noi. In June 2012, the super dike slope covered with one year grass mat was tested with the simulator. The front velocity of overtopping flows were estimated at three positions along the slope using digital camcorders. In general, increasing volume generates higher front velocity and it is likely to become larger downward the slope. Under attack of overtopping flows generated by the simulator, the super dike slope covered with Bermuda and Carpet grass was damaged moderately. Damage was in the form of a shallow erosion which took place around the dike crest and toe (geometric transitions). The mechanism is defined as 'roll up' or 'turf set-off', the grass mat of about 5 to 7 cm thick is lifted and rolled up gradually to expose the underneath soil body. Small damaged spots were observed around two obstacles of YB 1 and YB 4 sections therefore, influence of these objects on slope performance was unclear. Man-made eroded spots were introduced at two positions on YB 3 slope by removing the grass turf which was about 10 cm thick of the top layer including most of roots. Applying discharges of 40, 60, 80 and 100 l/s per m with a wave height of 2. 0 m caused a gradual extension of the artificial damage downward while depths and widths remained the same. Apparently, the destructive impact of overtopping flow is most effective in its direction, from crest to toe. The super dike slope was 1 / 15 of inclination and protected by two local grass species, Bermuda and <b>Carpet.</b> When being <b>tested,</b> the grass mats were about one year old. The maximum discharge of the simulator 100 l/s per m was applied for 6 to 10 hours, thus resulting in moderate damage to the grass cover. These damaged spots were limited within 7 to 10 cm under the slope surface and insufficiently significant that might threaten the function of the super dike. The simulator was designed to test the normal sea (river) dike slopes with a steepness of 1 / 3 to 1 / 6 under a mild wave condition, significant wave heights not above 2. 0 m. Therefore, to assess the super dike slope which is unbreachable even in extreme condition, a device with much higher capacity is clearly required.
