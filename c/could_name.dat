25|$|New York was {{the largest}} state in the union, and victory {{there was a real}} possibility. Catt agreed to turn the New York work over to others and to accept the NAWSA {{presidency}} in December, 1915 on the condition that she <b>could</b> <b>name</b> her own executive board, which previously had always been elected by the annual convention. She appointed to the board women of independent means who could work for the movement full-time.|$|E
25|$|In 181, one of Emperor Ling's consorts, Beautiful Lady Wang (王美人), bore him a son, Liu Xie (Emperor Xian). Beautiful Lady Wang was {{subsequently}} poisoned {{to death by}} Emperor Ling's empress, Empress He, so the motherless Liu Xie was raised by his grandmother. Empress Dowager Dong often urged Emperor Ling to designate one of his only two surviving sons, Liu Xie and Liu Bian (born to Empress He), as crown prince. Empress He and Empress Dowager Dong became engaged in a rivalry because they wanted Liu Bian and Liu Xie respectively to be crown prince. Emperor Ling died in 189 before he <b>could</b> <b>name</b> one of them as his successor.|$|E

25|$|Curtiss quickly {{recognized}} Genie's nonverbal communication abilities, recalling several nonverbal interactions Genie {{had with}} strangers during that time. By this time Genie <b>could</b> <b>name</b> {{most of the}} things around her and had an estimated vocabulary of at least a few hundred words, consisting of a few verbs and adjectives and a large number of nouns. She was also extremely eager to expand her vocabulary, frequently grabbing Curtiss' hand and pointing it towards objects for which she wanted to know the word, and if Curtiss could not figure out exactly what Genie was looking for Genie refused to let go until she learned at least one new word. Curtiss noted Genie's focus on objective properties, and especially her knowledge of color words, was very unusual because these require a level of cognitive sophistication not present in young children, suggesting she developed mental mechanisms for categorization during childhood. She had also clearly learned some basic principles of grammar, and understood more than she was producing.|$|E
25|$|When emperor Frederick Barbarossa {{travelled}} to the Netherlands in 1165, {{to settle}} the dispute between the counts of Holland and the bishops of Utrecht over the Frisian territories, he came up with a solution which was virtually guaranteed to keep things as they were. He ruled that the power in the disputed lands should be wielded by both the counts and the bishops in condominium. Count and bishop should together chose a vice-count to rule in their stead. When they could not agree on a candidate, the emperor <b>could</b> <b>name</b> the vice-count himself. Because this system of government could only function when the bishop of Utrecht was a partisan of the count of Holland, usually when a younger brother of the count was named as bishop of Utrecht, usually the status quo remained. When there was a weak bishop the influence of the count in the Frisian territories was greater, but usually still limited to the coastal region opposite Holland and the important trade city of Staveren. When there was a strong bishop the influence of Holland and Utrecht cancelled each other out.|$|E
25|$|The Resurrection Stone {{allows the}} holder {{to bring back}} {{deceased}} loved ones, in a semi-physical form, and communicate with them. The form of Sirius Black generated by the stone tells Harry {{that he and the}} other forms created by the stone are part of him and invisible to others. This seems to suggest that these apparitions are conjured from memories and are not really resurrected people. According to the fairy tale concerning the origin of the Deathly Hallows, using the Resurrection Stone drove the owner to kill himself because he brought his late fiancée back from the dead, and she was very unhappy in the real world for she did not belong there. By the time the stone was seen in Marvolo Gaunt's possession, it had been set into a ring that bore the symbol of the Deathly Hallows, which the ignorant Gaunt believed to be the Peverell coat of arms; he used the ring to boast about his ancestry and blood purity. Both Dumbledore and Grindelwald desired the stone, but for different reasons. While Dumbledore wanted it to communicate with his dead family, Grindelwald allegedly intended to use it to create an army of zombie-like Inferi. Harry said this is the Hallow he would desire most, as like Dumbledore he <b>could</b> <b>name</b> people he would like to communicate with again. Voldemort became aware of the ring's antiquity and eventually used the stone as a Horcrux, a container for part of his soul, being unaware of its additional magical properties.|$|E

25|$|In Jelling, Thorfinn meets some of Thorkell’s men. After being {{pressured}} by the men, Thorfinn {{has no choice}} but to accompany them to meet Thorkell, the Earl of Jelling whose land was received by King Canute. Thorfinn also meets Floki who, unbeknownst to Thorfinn, was the one who ordered Askeladd to kill his father Thors. During their meeting, Thorfinn learns that a group of Jomsvikings led by Vagn is pirating the Baltic Sea to gain fame and name himself as the new chieftain of the Jomsvikings, as the previous chieftain died before he <b>could</b> <b>name</b> a successor. Floki came to Jelling to seek aid from Thorkell in the conflict. Floki cannot become the new chieftain as their order’s code dictates that any warriors 50 years and over must retire, and the candidate Floki has in mind is too young for the order to admit. The candidate is Baldr, Floki’s grandson, as well the son of the former chieftain and grandchild of Sigvaldi, the second Jomsviking chieftain. In case a successor was not named, it’s only appropriate that the next chieftain is based on the prestige of his bloodline. To Floki’s dismay, Thorkell wants Thorfinn to become the next chieftain, as he is also the grandson of Sigvaldi and the son of Thors, the “Troll of Jom”, and currently the strongest and most valid candidate as the next Jomsviking chieftain. Thorfinn refuses the offer and returns to his companions. Thorfinn, knowing the dangers of staying in Jelling, hurries his crew to set sail immediately. All the while, Floki has plans to killing Thorsfinn while away from Thorkell’s lands.|$|E
500|$|The genus name Spongiforma {{refers to}} the sponge-like nature of the fruit body, while the {{specific}} epithet squarepantsii is a Latinisation of the well-known cartoon character SpongeBob SquarePants, whose shape was purported to share a resemblance to the fungus. Additionally, the authors note that the spore-bearing surface (the hymenium), when viewed with scanning electron microscopy, somewhat resembles a [...] "seafloor covered with tube sponges, reminiscent of the fictitious home of SpongeBob". Although the epithet was originally rejected by the editors of Mycologia as [...] "frivolous", Desjardin and colleagues insisted that [...] "we <b>could</b> <b>name</b> it whatever we liked".|$|E

500|$|Nonetheless {{for all of}} {{his wealth}} and {{innovation}} Little's ignominious end ensured he was quickly forgotten, and by the time Edwin Lefèvre published his now-classic Reminiscences of a Stock Operator in 1923 he was virtually unknown. To demonstrate this Lefèvre details asking nine seasoned members of the NYSE whether or not they had ever heard of Jacob Little before; only three of them did, and none <b>could</b> <b>name</b> who he was or what he had done, only knowing of his existence from having heard his name before. Lefèvre provided for this fact by saying [...] "what happened to Jacob was no more than what happens to thousands every year. The difference in degree does not make it more memorable." [...] Though it had once been that [...] "on change his tread was that of a king", today Little has been relegated to obscurity, and survives only as a footnote in histories of the stock market.|$|E
500|$|Munnerlyn {{is active}} with March of Dimes charities, a cause {{close to his}} heart as he was a {{premature}} baby himself. When asked why his name is Captain, Munnerlyn said, [...] "My momma promised my grandmomma that she <b>could</b> <b>name</b> the last child. I was the boy of the family, and she named me Captain. Her great grandfather was named Captain, so I got named after my great-great grandfather. My sisters and brothers have normal names. I got the odd name. In the beginning {{it was kind of}} rough. Kids used to tease me a little, but it fits my personality, because I feel like I'm a leader." [...] Munnerlyn majored in criminal justice while at South Carolina, where he was teammates and roommates with former Viking linebacker Jasper Brinkley. He was named the 2015 Korey Stringer Good Guy Award winner by media covering the Vikings. Munnerlyn is married to Lakisha and has two sons, Captain and Champ, and daughter, Eden. [...] Munnerlyn now serves on the board of his condominium association in alongside Charlotte based truck owner, Jeremy Thomas.|$|E
500|$|Conkling succeeded to {{leadership}} of the conservative wing of New York's Republicans by 1868 as Morgan concentrated more time and effort on national politics, including serving {{as chairman of the}} Republican National Committee. [...] The Conkling machine was solidly behind General Ulysses S. Grant's candidacy for president, and Arthur raised funds for Grant's election in 1868. The opposing Democratic machine in New York City, known as Tammany Hall, worked for Grant's opponent, former New York Governor Horatio Seymour; while Grant was victorious in the national vote, Seymour narrowly carried the state of New York. Arthur began to devote more of his time to politics and less to law, and in 1869 he became counsel to the New York City tax commission, appointed when Republicans controlled the state legislature. He remained at the job until 1870 at a salary of $10,000 a year. Arthur resigned after Democrats controlled by William M. Tweed of Tammany Hall won a legislative majority, which meant they <b>could</b> <b>name</b> their own appointee. [...] In 1871 Grant offered to name Arthur as Commissioner of Internal Revenue, replacing Alfred Pleasonton; Arthur declined the appointment.|$|E

500|$|Wright {{wanted to}} write and direct a cop film because [...] "there isn't really any {{tradition}} of cop films in the UK... We felt that every {{other country in the}} world had its own tradition of great cop action films and we had none." [...] Wright and Pegg spent eighteen months writing the script. The first draft took eight months to develop, and after watching 138 cop-related films for dialogue and plot ideas and conducting over fifty interviews with police officers for research, the script was completed after another nine months. The title was based on the various two-word titles of action films in the 1980s and 1990s. In one interview Wright declared that he [...] "wanted to make a title that really had very little meaning...like Lethal Weapon and Point Break and Executive Decision." [...] In the same interview, Pegg joked that many action films' titles [...] "seem to be generated from two hats filled with adjectives and nouns and you just, 'Okay, that'll do.'" [...] While writing the script, the film's director and writer, Edgar Wright, as well as Pegg, intended to include Frost as the partner for Pegg's character. Frost revealed that he would do the film only if he <b>could</b> <b>name</b> his character, and he chose [...] "Danny Butterman".|$|E
