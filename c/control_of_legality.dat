The review should not only be a <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>legality</b> but it has to be an unlimited merits control. An appeal control should be directed to review fully the facts and to control proportionality of the imposed fines.

40|$|The Peoples' Councils and Local Self-Government System Act of 20 July 1983 {{introduced}} certain new {{elements to}} local administration system. Treating people's councils as organs of local self-government {{was one of}} those elements. People's councils and organs of municipal and rural residents self-government are handled in the new regulation as parts of the same organizational structure (of local self- -government system). It resulted in an increase of weight of decentralization and supervision problems in aspect of local administration. The present article contains a study of regulation pertaining to supervision excercised in three systems: 1. supervision performed upon people's councils, 2. supervision upon organs of municipal and rural self-government and 3. supervision upon administrative organs of people's councils. In the first system, supervision is performed by the Council of State (upon all councils in principle) and by voivodship (district) councils upon municipal, quarter, and rural district councils. The supervision covers <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>legality</b> of decisions and corrective means which cannot violate a principle of independence in activities. The newly introduced obligation of lending assistance to supervised organs is characteristic for a socialist state. The Polish Seym (Diet) is also obliged by the Act to take care of self-government charakter of people's councils, special means are provided for the Council of State to be used in instances of violating independence of people's councils by other organs. Supervision of rural self-government organs is trusted to rural district council and to its presidium, while supervision upon municipal self-government organs is performed by municipal (quarter) council and its presidium. Means of control are not intensive there but also the scope of affairs relegated to that self government is not substantial {{at least as far as}} decisional competence is concerned. In practice, the supervision upon organs of administration of people's councils is of a crucial importance, as those are implementing tasks of people's councils. On the central level, the supervision is divided onto various organs: Council of Ministers, Prime Minister, Minister of Administration and Region-Shaping Economy and branch ministers, what can threaten with inconsistencies in performing that function. On the voivodship level, the supervision is performed by voivodes and heads of departments of voivodship administration upon relevant organs of administration on the level of rural district, city, quarter. Yet, competence of higher level organs is differentiated subject to tasks performed by local organs of administration. In the decentralised sphere (when organs of administration act as executive organs of people's councils), means of exercised influence are those of supervision. But if those organs act in the sphere excluded from the competence of people's councils, the means are close to hierarchical subordination. That latter influence is named governance in the Act. The differentiated influence is effected by a dual role of local organs of administration since a dualistic model of local administration (self- -governmental and governmental) is rejected in the Act.

40|$|Three {{years have}} passed on September 1 st since {{judicial}} review of administrative decisions was returned in Poland as principle of the system. This function is performed by a special court which is the Supreme Administrative Court (SAC). Simultaneously, specific provisions were upheld, by virtue of which review of administrative decisions could be sporadically performed by common courts of law and by district courts of labor and social security, According to the Constitutional principle positioning the Supreme Court as the highest judicial organ supervising judicial decisions of a l l courts, it can: overrule decisions of the Supreme Administrative Court by means of extraordinary appeal against a valid judgement answer legal queries directed to it, as well as resolve guiding principles for the judiciary also {{in the range of}} administrative law. On describing model of the SAC competence, the Polish legislator adopted a principle of enumerating clause specifying 20 categories of most typical cases in relations of administrative organ — citizen in art. 196 § 2 of code of administrative procedure, when final decision' of administrative instances can be appealed against to court. Complaint on no decision given can be also lodged in those cases. The SAC competence is further extended in the other acts eg. in cases of censorship or taxation including. State enterprises and other State organizational units. Frequent doubts can be raised in applying the enumerating clause, as to possibility of judicial action on account of ambivalent or too general definition of categories of cases. Similar doubts appear in the notion of „administrative decision" and legal grounds of giving it. Another problem is the range of judicial review in cases where the legislator left decisiongiving or its contents to the discretion of organ, or when the so-called not precise terms are being used. Three year judicial practice indicates that the Court aims at strengthening the institution of judicial review of administrative decisions as the principle of the system. It is manifested by: — following the principle of presumed admissibility of action in case of doubt (in dubio pro actione), — interpreting the notion of "decision" in a way enabling — a wide range of control of administration and protection of rights of citizens and their organizations. A decision is not excluded from judicial review when it bears a wrong name or is lacking proper external form. On the other hand it is avoided to interfere into a sphere of internal affairs of administration and regulated by not being generally valid provisions, i. e. enacted without a statutory authorisation. Was there any duty imposed on a citizen by decision given on a grounds of these provisions, the SAC would find the decision invalid, — bringing under control all decisions of organizational units which are not organs of State administration in their nature if it is only ascertained that they realize a function of State administration, — complete review of decisions given on grounds of provisions containing not precise terms known also as non clearly defined ones and establishing their judicial interpretation, — review of decisions given at discretion of administration, the Court establishes only whether a case allowed for giving a discretionary decision, or it could be barred at discretion (in refusal). It is also stated whether the procedural regulations were followed, whether substantiation of decision is consistent with the results of proceedings to take evidence, — performing indirect <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>legality</b> of executory acts, refusal to apply any act which is inconsistent with statutory law. The Court attempted at making administration follow the principle that imposing duties upon citizens or refusal to grant them rights or refusing them right to behave according to their will can take place only when organ of administration is authorised to do so by the explicit legal provision. Opposition to give administrative decision on grounds of non statutory provisions (not originating in statutes) helps in avoiding regulating relations administrative organ — citizen on their grounds when individual cases have to be settled with by means of decision. Different opinion of the Supreme Court can be raised in some cases, two year practice of the SAC recognizing that decisions of entering and dissolving labor contracts with nominated employees belong to the category of "matters of employment" and are one of 20 categories of cases being under the cognizance of the SAC was objected by the supreme judicature. Judicial decisions related to establishing a scope of judicial control (review) rouse a vivid interest among legal scholars.

While in regard to the massive-scale top-down approach deviating from a Southern European strategy, compared to federal states such as Germany, interaction between national and subnational levels remains relatively weak with the subnational levels remaining strictly separated from the deconcentrated administration of the central government.

As financial intermediaries, these institutions issue various financial instruments to mobilize and further allocate free financial funds in appropriate financial investments. By performing this function, financial institutions concurrently affect economic activity, economic structure, employment and macroeconomic stability. Due to their importance for economic relations in any country, most countries prescribe very strict requirements that must be fulfilled in order for an organization to perform financial intermediation activities. These conditions are most often related to the specific requirements regarding activities of financial institutions and their establishment, balance sheet, and requirements in terms of capital adequacy.
