40|$|Abstract — Michotte’s {{theory of}} ampliation {{suggests}} that causal relationships are perceived by objects animated under appropriate spatiotemporal conditions. We extend {{the theory of}} ampliation and propose that the immediate perception of complex causal relations is also dependent {{on a set of}} structural and temporal rules. We designed animated representations, based on Michotte’s rules, for showing complex causal relationships or causal semantics. In this paper we describe a set of animations for showing semantics such as causal amplification, causal strength, causal dampening, and causal multiplicity. In a two part study we compared the effectiveness of both the static and animated representations. The first study (N= 44) asked participants to recall passages that were previously displayed using both types of representations. Participants were 8 % more accurate in recalling causal semantics when they were presented using animations instead of static graphs. In the second study (N= 112) we evaluated the intuitiveness of the representations. Our results showed that while users were as accurate with the static graphs as with the animations, they were 9 % faster in matching the correct causal statements in the animated condition. Overall our results show that animated diagrams that are designed based on perceptual rules such as those proposed by Michotte have the potential to facilitate comprehension of complex causal relations.

5000|$|The {{point of}} the koan {{is that for the}} {{ordinary}} person the two conflicting views of causality are between falling into <b>cause</b> and <b>effect</b> or not falling into <b>cause</b> and <b>effect,</b> because they dream of being free from <b>cause</b> and <b>effect</b> as being separate from <b>cause</b> and <b>effect.</b> But when a person awakens to their true nature he/she sees the oneness of <b>cause</b> and <b>effect</b> and therefore that person does not [...] "darken", [...] "obscure", or [...] "ignore" [...] (昧, mei4) the functioning of <b>cause</b> and <b>effect</b> by imagining <b>cause</b> and <b>effect</b> are two separate things, that <b>cause</b> and <b>effect</b> is separate from one's Buddha nature.
