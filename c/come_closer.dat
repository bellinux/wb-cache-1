5|$|Linguistically, {{the text}} of Rawlinson B 512 is similar to Harley 5280, {{especially}} at the beginning; {{and there are also}} innovations in common with the Book of Leinster, showing that the redactor clearly had more than one manuscript at his disposal. In one instance the diction seems to <b>come</b> <b>closer</b> to the form of the original than any other surviving manuscript. An interpolation concerning Cú Roí points to this version's origin in Munster. In spite of some miscomprehension of the story {{on the part of the}} revisionist scribe, the literary style as a whole is somewhat smoother than in the earlier version, which Rudolf Thurneysen points out is of help for the understanding of the tale.|$|E
5|$|Lions {{were kept}} in cramped and squalid {{conditions}} at London Zoo until a larger lion house with roomier cages {{was built in the}} 1870s. Further changes took place in the early twentieth century, when Carl Hagenbeck designed enclosures more closely resembling a natural habitat, with concrete 'rocks', more open space and a moat instead of bars. He designed lion enclosures for both Melbourne Zoo and Sydney's Taronga Zoo, among others, in the early twentieth century. Though his designs were popular, the old bars and cage enclosures prevailed until the 1960s in many zoos. In the later decades of the twentieth century, larger, more natural enclosures and the use of wire mesh or laminated glass instead of lowered dens allowed visitors to <b>come</b> <b>closer</b> than ever to the animals, with some attractions even placing the den on ground higher than visitors, such as the Cat Forest/Lion Overlook of Oklahoma City Zoological Park.|$|E
5|$|Mulder {{investigates the}} airbag on Skinner's car, {{which was the}} one used to hit Sharon. Scully defends Skinner to the Office of Professional Responsibility, but it does no good and he is fired. Mulder {{believes}} this was done to weaken the X-Files. Mulder, {{with the help of}} Agent Pendrell finds a face imprint in the airbag which is not Skinner's. He goes to see the prostitute's boss again but discovers that she has been murdered. The agents hope to use Judy, an employee who saw the man who actually hired the prostitute and use her to set up another meeting with him. They agree to meet at the Ambassador Hotel in an hour. Skinner goes to see his wife, telling her why he could not sign the divorce papers. An alarm on Sharon's vital sign monitor starts sounding, but as Skinner is about to run for help, the old woman once again takes the place of Sharon, beckoning him to <b>come</b> <b>closer.</b> As Skinner leans in, he sees his wife again, now awakened from the coma; she says something inaudible to him.|$|E

5|$|Ny-Ålesund was {{established}} as a mining company town by Kings Bay in 1916. Between 1925 and 1928, four {{attempts were made to}} reach the North Pole by air from Ny-Ålesund. In May 1925, Roald Amundsen used Ny-Ålesund as a base for two flying boats, but the expedition failed to <b>come</b> <b>closer</b> than 88 degrees north. On 9 May 1926, Floyd Bennett and Richard E. Byrd used Ny-Ålesund as both the starting and landing for their expedition. Although they claimed to have reached the pole, there is strong evidence that they could not have accomplished this. On 11 May, Amundsen and Umberto Nobile's airship Norge left Ny-Ålesund and traveled via the North Pole to Alaska. This is regarded as the first successful expedition to the North Pole. After two short skirmishes, Nobile's airship Italia left Ny-Ålesund on 23 May 1928 to reach the North Pole, but crashed on the return.|$|E
5|$|Since gluons carry color charge, they {{themselves}} are able to emit and absorb other gluons. This causes asymptotic freedom: as quarks <b>come</b> <b>closer</b> to each other, the chromodynamic binding force between them weakens. Conversely, as the distance between quarks increases, the binding force strengthens. The color field becomes stressed, much as an elastic band is stressed when stretched, and more gluons of appropriate color are spontaneously created to strengthen the field. Above a certain energy threshold, pairs of quarks and antiquarks are created. These pairs bind with the quarks being separated, causing new hadrons to form. This phenomenon is known as color confinement: quarks never appear in isolation. This process of hadronization occurs before quarks, formed in a high energy collision, are able to interact in any other way. The only exception is the top quark, which may decay before it hadronizes.|$|E

25|$|Thus Bohr's {{assumption}} that angular momentum is quantised means that an electron can only inhabit certain orbits around the nucleus, {{and that it}} can have only certain energies. A consequence of these constraints is that the electron will not crash into the nucleus: it cannot continuously emit energy, and it cannot <b>come</b> <b>closer</b> to the nucleus than a0 (the Bohr radius).|$|E
25|$|Tarkan's last Turkish {{language}} {{album was}} Dudu, in 2003. His first English language work, <b>Come</b> <b>Closer</b> {{did not bring}} satisfactory results {{when compared to the}} sales of his previous albums. It did not even reach gold sales, according to the list published by MÜ-YAP (Turkish Phonographic Institute). After the failure of <b>Come</b> <b>Closer</b> Tarkan decided to release a new, Turkish album and in the beginning of 2007 he declared that he was working on new songs. However, release dates were continuously being postponed. The Turkish daily Hürriyet reported that the album would be released around Ramadan Fest, the three-day celebration after the Islamic fasting month of Ramadan. It was rumoured that the first single would be called Biraz Nezaket (A Little Courtesy), written by Sezen Aksu. Tarkan denied this in an interview given at the Atatürk International Airport in Istanbul, declaring that release was delayed and the Sezen Aksu song was taken off the track list.|$|E

25|$|As a solid {{piece of}} chocolate, the cocoa butter fat {{particles}} {{are in a}} crystalline rigid structure that gives the chocolate its solid appearance.

When the heat is removed, the cocoa butter crystals become rigid again and <b>come</b> <b>closer</b> together, allowing the chocolate to solidify.|$|E

25|$|Although models {{based on}} these and other point {{processes}} <b>come</b> <b>closer</b> to resembling reality in some situations, for example in the configuration of cellular base stations, they often suffer from a loss of tractability while the Poisson process greatly simplifies the mathematics and techniques, explaining its continued use for developing stochastic geometry models of wireless networks.
