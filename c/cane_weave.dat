40|$|Implementation {{of these}} {{recommendations}} {{will result in}} reduced construction cost of $ 91, 418 and annual operating savings of $ 88, 910 if recommendations 1 - 5 and 6 a are implemented at Amarillo and Gatesville. Use of recommendations 1 - 5 and 6 b will increase first cost by $ 22, 592, but annual operating savings also increase to $ 98, 928 while 6 c would provide first cost savings of $ 67, 606 and operating savings of $ 73, 882 annually. Additional maintenance savings will be realized in each case since the fixtures recommended above use tubes with 20, 000 - 24, 000 hour operating lifetimes instead of the 12, 000 hours of the base case tubes. Over 100 tests of potential design modifications for the cell light fixtures used by the Texas Department of Corrections have been conducted. As {{a result of these}} tests, the following recommendations are made: 1. Turn diffuser material so prisms face cell. 2. Enlarge diffuser opening to 16 by 46 inches. 3. Replace 1 / 2 -inch hardware cloth by # 3 stainless <b>cane</b> <b>weave</b> with 2 -inch mesh, painted white. 4. Replace ballasts with Advance R- 2 S 40 -TP Mark III or equivalent. 5. Replace blankets with light colored blankets. 6 a. Use fixture with four 34 watt tubes if no allowance for fixture degradation is deemed acceptable; 6 b. Use fixture with three 40 watt high efficiency tubes and reflector if 10 %- 15 % margin above 20 fc is needed; 6 c. Use fixture with four high efficiency tubes if 20 % margin above 20 fc is considered necessary...|$|E

50|$|In {{the late}} 18th and early 19th centuries, Japan was a pre-industrial society that infused every day objects {{with a sense}} of good design, and where handiwork and {{handcrafts}} were highly valued. While Japanese ceramics became popular in Britain and North America around the middle of the 19th century, {{it was not until the}} 1880s and 1890s that American manufactures, such as Nimura and Sato, began to produce significant quantities of Japanese influenced furniture. Such pieces often contained real or simulated (usually turned-maple) bamboo and <b>woven</b> <b>cane</b> in door panels or tabletops. The Japanese furniture contrasted dramatically with the massive, overstuffed, heavy, dark, and often gaudy Victorian furniture that had been in vogue.|$|R

The Chair best {{represents}} Wegner's design {{philosophy of}} [...] "continuous purification...to cut {{down to the}} simplest possible elements of four legs, a seat, and a combined top rail and armrest" [...] The Chair was a collaboration of Wegner and furniture maker Johannes Hansen (now made by PP Mobler as models PP501/PP503). The construction features 11 pieces of wood joined by 12 mortise and tenons and two large finger joints. The finger joints orient the wood grain as the back rail wraps around the body to maximize material strength. The Chair was offered with a solid upholstered seat, or a seat of airy <b>woven</b> <b>caning.</b> It rose to prominence in the 1961 televised debate between Richard Nixon and John F. Kennedy. Both presidential candidates sat in The Chair during the debate.|$|R
50|$|The William and Mary {{style was}} {{influenced}} by recent French furniture traditions, which in turn were influenced by Italian Baroque furniture designs. William and Mary style furniture emphasized unity, so that all elements contributed to an overall shape or look. It also featured high relief carving, strong curves, and elaborate woodturning. Despite these elements, the style was fairly squat, heavy-looking, and obviously sturdy. Straight lines are common. Paint, stains, or different kind of wood were used to create contrasting colors, which was another element of this style. Japanning, a technique of varnishing which was very popular at the time, was also used on this furniture design. For chairs, <b>woven</b> <b>cane</b> seats and heavily-scrolled backs predominated. Toward {{the end of the}} style, cane-woven seats and backs had given way to leather, and straight or slightly angled backs had given way to serpentine forms.|$|R
50|$|Over time, American {{forms of}} William and Mary {{furniture}} became simplified. Although the Baroque influence was still {{seen in the}} crests, feet, and scrolls, other elements and the overall look of pieces began to shed this influence in favor of plain but strong curves. American chairmakers began using <b>woven</b> <b>cane</b> in the splats of chairs as well. For armchairs, American designers favored seats and splats covered in leather, attached with brass nails. In parts of America like New York and New Jersey, which had a heavy Dutch cultural influence, the kast became popular. The kast was of Dutch origin, and featured a large drawer in the base unit. Atop the base were shelves concealed behind one or two heavy doors. An elaborate cornice usually ran along the upper edges. Influenced by the William and Mary style, the American kast featured removable feet, simplified the cornice, and eliminated the intricate inlays favored by the Dutch.|$|R

5000|$|Hearn {{was able}} to visit the village, and his account {{provided}} very detailed information regarding their dwellings. The Manilamen lived in small houses which were supported above the water by stilts. The palmetto and <b>woven</b> <b>cane</b> {{did not have the}} durability to withstand the violent climate of the bayous. Much of the wood needed to build the houses had to be shipped from various parts of Louisiana, as wood strong enough to support dwellings could not be easily found in the swamps. Since many creatures of all kinds lived in the swamps, the dwellers found it necessary to improvise their houses. They had every window closed with wire netting to protect themselves from mosquitos and other insects and also had to be vigilant for reptiles and other animals abound in the swamps. There was no furniture, no table, no chair and no bed in any of the dwellings. What could have been considered as mattresses were filled with what Hearn called “dry Spanish-beard, commonly known today as Spanish moss which is in fact not a moss but is an epiphytic plant that can be found hanging from trees.” These were laid upon “tiers” of shelves faced against the walls. According to Hearn the fishermen slept at night “among barrels of flour and folded sails and smoked fish.” ...|$|R

50|$|Mound No. 2 {{is located}} on the western side of the plaza. It is 235 ft across from north to south, and 160 ft across east to west. At the time of {{excavation}} it reached 7.5 ft high. Less than one-fifth of the area of the mound was excavated; because of this, {{it is impossible to know}} the number of structures constructed upon it. The mound was raised in four stages. The first level, at the base of the mound, was the original ground surface of the soil. In this layer, archaeologists discovered a fire bed filled with ashes and broken animal bones, indicating that a structure had existed there before the mound was built over top of it. After the house was torn down, the 3 ft high mound was constructed in its place. On the second level there is evidence that at least one building, and probably more, were constructed. The floor of this structure was packed down and layered with stone slabs, much like pavement. A small pile of maize and maize meal were also found. In the southwestern segment of the mound were found the ruins of a structure, named by Myer the “Sacred Image House” because among the items found were the remains of a sacred idol, a shrine, and traces of fire ceremonies. After the buildings were torn down the mound was raised a few more inches for the third construction level. Many items were found on this level, such as a metate and muller, arrowheads, shell tempered pottery, multiple fire beds, and objects made from deer bones. However, the most important was a structure dubbed the “House of Mysteries”. The builbing was an important civic structure, probably used for sacred rites and town gatherings, and had two rooms. Myers described the floor as being made of “black, glossy earth”. The walls and roof of the building were built using the cane matting technique and an arched roof. The <b>woven</b> <b>cane</b> matting was then covered inside and outside with a coating of clay plaster known as wattle and daub. Inside the building was an altar, complete with an oval altar bowl. The bowl, filled with white, powdery ashes, was made of fired red clay. The fire was allowed to burn without being put out. The structure was eventually destroyed by fire. Mound No. 2 was in constant cultivation for at least 85 years, and as a result, only limited structural evidence exists for the final stage. However, numerous postholes indicate that there was a building constructed atop the mound during this phase. It is also important to note that a few burials from the later group of rectangular stone grave people were found close to the surface of Mound No. 2. These were discovered in 1895, when the farmer who owned the land plowed over them and decided to take a closer look.|$|R
