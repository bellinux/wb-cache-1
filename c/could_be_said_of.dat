25|$|In {{the late}} 19th and early 20th century, Manchester gained a {{pioneering}} reputation {{for a city}} at the centre of physics, namely {{in the field of}} nuclear physics. The 'Nuclear Family' was the alias given to a group of scientists who studied nuclear physics in Manchester. 'Family' highlights the consistent development through the generations in nuclear physics, beginning with Thomson in the late 18th century and ending with James Chadwick in the 1930s who discovered the neutron. Ernest Rutherford is often described as the 'father of nuclear physics', equally the same <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>said</b> <b>of</b> J. J. Thomson who discovered the electron and isotopes, and ultimately taught Rutherford who later go on to split the atom. Scientists who were part of the 'nuclear family' in Manchester included J. J.

The main outcome of the gathering was {{the foundation of the}} Red International of Labour Unions, often known as the [...] "Profintern". The aim of this organisation was to seek revolutionary change through industrial action, leading to the overthrow of world capitalism. At home, although she failed to persuade her union, NUDAW, to affiliate to the Profintern, Wilkinson continued to promote Russian achievements, especially its emancipation of women workers. In November 1922, at a meeting celebrating the fifth anniversary of the Russian Revolution, Wilkinson said that the Russian people could look forward with hope, and asked whether the same <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>said</b> <b>of</b> the people condemned to live their lives in the slums of Manchester. However, Wilkinson found herself increasingly at odds with communists in Manchester, over the party's industrial and wider international strategies.|$|E
2500|$|In the Western Theater, {{the most}} fearless, and ruthless, cavalry {{commander}} was Nathan Bedford Forrest, who achieved spectacular results with small forces but was an ineffective {{subordinate to the}} army commanders {{he was supposed to}} support, resulting in poorly coordinated battles. [...] Much of the same issues <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>said</b> <b>of</b> Forrest's counterpart in the Army of Tennessee, John Hunt Morgan. [...] In the Eastern Theater, the Partisan Ranger John Singleton Mosby succeeded in tying down upwards of 40,000 Federal troops defending rail lines and logistical hubs with only 100-150 irregulars.

2500|$|The {{popularity}} of discretionary trusts rose sharply after {{the decision of}} the House of Lords in McPhail v Doulton [...] AC 424 where Lord Wilberforce restated the test for certainty of objects in connection with discretionary trusts. Previously, it had been understood that for the trust to be valid, the trustees {{had to be able to}} draw up a [...] "complete list" [...] of all the possible beneficiaries, and if they could not do so, the trust was void. [...] But Lord Wilberforce held that provided it <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>said</b> <b>of</b> any person whether they were [...] "in or out" [...] of the class, as described by the settlor, the trust would be valid.|$|E

[...] While to an extent this may be true, the same <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>said</b> <b>of</b> most eras until the early 20th century, the Neo-Renaissance {{in the hands of}} provincial architects did develop into a style not always instantly recognisable as a derivative of the Renaissance. In this less obvious guise the Neo-Renaissance was to provide an important undercurrent in totalitarian architecture of various countries, notably in Stalinist architecture of the Soviet Union, as seen in some pavilions of the All-Soviet Exhibition Centre.|$|E
2500|$|At the University, {{with its}} {{atmosphere}} of intellectual freedom and lively debate, Goncharov's spirit thrived. One episode {{proved to be}} especially memorable: when his then idol Alexander Pushkin arrived as a guest lecturer to have a public debate with professor Mikhail T. Katchenovsky on the authenticity of The Tale of Igor's Campaign. [...] "It was as if sunlight lit up the auditorium. I was enchanted by his poetry at the time...it was his genius that formed my aesthetic ideas – although the same, I think, <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>said</b> <b>of</b> all the young people of the time {{who were interested in}} poetry," [...] Goncharov wrote. Unlike Alexander Herzen, Vissarion Belinsky, or Nikolay Ogaryov, his fellow Moscow University students, Goncharov remained indifferent to the ideas of political and social change that were gaining popularity at the time. Reading and translating were his main occupations. In 1832, the Telescope magazine published two chapters of Eugene Sue's novel Atar-Gull (1831), translated by Goncharov. This was his debut publication.|$|E
2500|$|The {{writing is}} generously scaled [...] letter forms vary between 0.3 and 0.4cm in height, lines are spaced {{approximately}} 0.5cm apart, {{and there is}} a margin of 2cm at the top. It can be determined that there were eighteen lines to a page. C. H. Roberts commented: [...] ".. to judge from the spacing {{and the size of the}} text, it is unlikely that the format was affected by considerations of economy". There are no apparent punctuation marks or breathings shown in the fragment; but the diaeresis is applied to an initial iota at both the second line of the recto and the second line of the verso; and possibly too on the first line of the recto. Taken together with the over-scaled writing, this suggests that the manuscript may have been intended for congregational reading. If the original codex did indeed contain the entire text of the canonical Gospel of John, it would have constituted a single quire book of around 130 pages (i.e. 33 large folded papyrus sheets written on both sides); measuring approximately 21 by 20cm when closed. Roberts noted a glued vertical join in the papyrus slightly inside the inner margin and visible on the verso, indicating that the large sheets used for the codex were likely to have been specially prepared for the purpose, each having been constructed from two standard sized sheets measuring approximately 21cm by 16cm, with a central narrower sheet approximately 21cm by 8cm constituting the spine. Roberts describes the handwriting as [...] "heavy, rounded and rather elaborate", but nevertheless not the work of [...] "a practised scribe" [...] (i.e. not a professional bookhand). [...] Roberts notes comments that had recently been made by the editors of the Egerton Gospel (P.Egerton 2); and says similarly it <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>said</b> <b>of</b> 52 that it [...] "has a somewhat informal air about it and with no claims to fine writing is yet a careful piece of work".|$|E
