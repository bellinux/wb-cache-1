500|$|With Spain {{being the}} first race in Western Europe, and a mid-season test <b>coming</b> <b>up</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> race, many teams {{introduced}} their first major car updates for the Grand Prix. Mercedes ran a new front wing with a [...] "more pointy" [...] nose during first free practice. Other changes {{were made to the}} engine cover and the rear wing. McLaren made more significant changes to their MP4-31, most notably on the front wing, which Sky Sports commentator Ted Kravitz called the [...] "most intricate front wing I've ever seen". Force India updated their VJM09 to improve airflow. According to the team, they were looking for improved driveability rather than faster lap times. Renault introduced a new chassis for Jolyon Palmer. More significantly, the French manufacturer debuted a new version of their power unit for both their works team and Red Bull at the two-day test following the race. All other teams except for Sauber also made changes to their cars, with the Swiss team continuing their financial struggles. They also announced that they would be forced to miss the mid-season test, being unable to field a development driver, with regulations demanding that two out of four test days be driven by young driver talents.|$|E

5000|$|It {{has been}} {{reported}} that the 12th U.S. Infantry made the charge, assisted by the 25th Infantry, but it is a recorded fact that the 25th Infantry fought the battle alone, the 12th Infantry <b>coming</b> <b>up</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> firing had nearly ceased. Private T.C. Butler, Company H, 25th Infantry, was the first man to enter the block-house at El Caney, and took possession of the Spanish flag for his regiment. An officer of the 12th Infantry came up while Butler was in the house and ordered him to give up the flag, which he was compelled to do, but not until he had torn a piece off the flag to substantiate his report to his Colonel of the injustice which had been done to him. Thus, by using the authority given him by his shoulder-straps, this officer took for his regiment that which had been won by the hearts' blood of some of the bravest, though black, soldiers of Shafter's army. The charge of El Caney has been little spoken of, but it was quite as great a show of bravery as the famous taking of San Juan Hill.Frank W. Pullen, Jr., Ex-Sergeant-Major 25th U.S. Infantry.

In 1966 - 1999 the ritual disappeared because of changes of people's minds and economic-politic situation. In year 2000 Sawen was conducted again but only for reviving Sasak's tribe customs and traditions which had vanished. The emergence of awig-awig is influenced by conflict in coastal community caused by ecology condition, demography, legal politic condition, market distribution process, means of livelihood, and change of technology. Awig-awig is established through formal and informal phase. It has several rules : 1) Fishing ground which is 3 miles away from shore is only for traditional fishermen; 2) Social unit as right holder is individual; 3) Legal source is by traditional ritual sawen; 4) Awig-awig is strictly up held by NLFS whose sanctions are a maximal Rp 10. 000. 000 fine, burning marine fishing gears, and mistreating by mass {{but it does not}} commit to murder. The problem <b>coming</b> <b>up</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> implementation is a conflict between local fishermen and outsiders using bomb and potassium in fishing activity.

40|$|We {{discuss the}} strong {{interaction}} regime of the nonlinear Landau-Zener problem <b>coming</b> <b>up</b> at coherent photo- and magneto-association of ultracold atoms. We apply a variational approach to an exact third-order nonlinear differential equation for the molecular state probability and construct an accurate approximation describing {{the whole time}} dynamics of the coupled atom-molecular system. The resultant solution improves {{the accuracy of the}} previous approximation by A. Ishkhanyan et al. [J. Phys. A 39, 14887 (2006) ]. The obtained results reveal a remarkable observation that in the strong coupling limit the resonance crossing is mostly governed by the nonlinearity while the coherent atom-molecular oscillations <b>coming</b> <b>up</b> soon <b>after</b> <b>the</b> resonance has been crossed are principally of linear nature. This observation is supposed to be general for all the nonlinear quantum systems having the same generic quadratic nonlinearity, due to the basic attributes of the resonance crossing processes in such systems. The constructed approximation turns out to have a larger applicability range (than it was initially expected) covering the whole moderate coupling regime for which the proposed solution accurately describes all the main characteristics of the system's evolution except the amplitude of the coherent atom-molecule oscillation, which is rather overestimated.

6000|$|Never {{but once}} did I enjoy the {{privilege}} of meeting the author of [...] "Elsie Venner"--Oliver Wendell Holmes. It was at a dinner given by Mr. Lowell, and of conversation with Dr. Holmes I had very little. He struck me as being wonderfully erect, active, and vivacious for his great age. He spoke (perhaps I should not chronicle this impression)--he spoke much, and freely, but rather {{as if he were}} wound up to speak, so to say--wound up, I mean, by a sense of duty to himself and kindness to strangers, who were naturally curious about so well-known a man. In his aspect there was a certain dryness, and, altogether, his vivacity, his ceaselessness, and a kind of equability of tone in his voice, reminded me of what Homer says concerning the old men around Priam, above the gate of Troy, how they [...] "chirped like cicalas on a summer day." [...] About the matter of his talk I remember nothing, only the manner remains with me, and mine may have been a false impression, or the manner may have been accidental, and of the moment: or, again, a manner appropriate for conversation with strangers, each <b>coming</b> <b>up</b> one <b>after</b> <b>the</b> other, to view respectfully so great a lion. Among his friends and intimates he was probably a different man, with a tone other and more reposeful.|$|R

50|$|Recently, aspen {{populations have}} been declining in some areas. This {{may be due}} to several {{different}} factors, such as climate change, which exacerbates drought and modifies precipitation patterns. Recruitment failure from herbivory or grazing prevents new trees from <b>coming</b> <b>up</b> <b>after</b> old trees die. Additionally, successional replacement by conifers due to fire suppression alters forest diversity and creates conditions where aspen may be at less of an advantage. Sudden aspen death is also occurring more often as a result of drought stress.|$|R
