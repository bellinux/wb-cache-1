5|$|Students from Bristol University held {{a protest}} {{march to the}} bus station and the local {{headquarters}} of the TGWU on 1 May, which attracted heckling from bus crews as they passed through the city centre, according to the local press. Local MP Tony Benn contacted then Labour Opposition leader Harold Wilson, who spoke out against the <b>colour</b> <b>bar</b> at an Anti-Apartheid Movement rally in London. On 2 May local Labour Party Alderman Henry Hennessey spoke of the apparent collusion between bus company management and the TGWU over the <b>colour</b> <b>bar.</b> On 3 May, the ruling Labour Group on the city council threatened him with expulsion, despite his honourable service of over forty years.|$|E
5|$|As a young social worker, in 1963 Stephenson led {{a boycott}} of the Bristol Omnibus Company, protesting against its refusal to employ Black or Asian drivers or conductors. After a 60-day boycott {{supported}} by thousands of Bristolians, the company revoked its <b>colour</b> <b>bar</b> in August. In 1964 Stephenson achieved national fame when he refused to leave a public house until he was served, resulting in a trial {{on a charge of}} failing to leave a licensed premises. His campaigns were instrumental in paving the way for the first Race Relations Act, in 1965. Stephenson is a Freeman of the City of Bristol and was awarded an OBE in 2009.|$|E
5|$|As {{with other}} British cities, there was {{immigration}} from various Commonwealth {{countries in the}} post war years, which did lead to some racist tension. In 1963, a <b>colour</b> <b>bar</b> operated by Bristol Omnibus Company, which at that time refused to employ Black or Asian bus crews, was successfully challenged in the Bristol Bus Boycott, which was considered to have been instrumental in the eventual passage of the Race Relations Act 1968. In 1980 a police raid on a cafe in St Paul's sparked the St Pauls riot, which highlighted the alienation of the city's ethnic minorities.|$|E

5|$|Tony Benn, Fenner Brockway {{and former}} cricketer Learie Constantine also {{condemned}} the bus company. Constantine was then serving as High Commissioner for Trinidad and Tobago. Constantine {{wrote letters to}} the bus company and Stephenson and spoke out against the <b>colour</b> <b>bar</b> to reporters when he attended the cricket match between the West Indies and Gloucestershire at the County Ground, which took place from 4 to 7 May. The West Indies team refused to publicly support the boycott, saying that sport and politics did not mix. During the game, local members of the Campaign Against Racial Discrimination (CARD) distributed leaflets urging spectators to support the action.|$|E
5|$|Four young West Indian men, Roy Hackett, Owen Henry, Audley Evans and Prince Brown, {{formed an}} action group, later {{to be called}} the West Indian Development Council. They were unhappy with the lack of {{progress}} in fighting discrimination by the West Indian Association. Owen Henry had met Paul Stephenson, whose father was from West Africa, and who had been to college. The group decided that the articulate Stephenson would be their spokesman. Stephenson set up a test case to prove the <b>colour</b> <b>bar</b> existed by arranging an interview with the bus company for Guy Bailey, a young warehouseman and Boys' Brigade officer. When Stephenson told the company that Bailey was West Indian, the interview was cancelled. Inspired by the refusal of Rosa Parks to give up her seat on a bus in Alabama and the ensuing Montgomery Bus Boycott in the United States in 1955, the activists decided on a bus boycott in Bristol.|$|E

She did not complete her degree, but moved to Johannesburg in 1948, where she lived thereafter. While taking classes in Johannesburg, she continued to write, publishing mostly in local South African magazines. She collected many of these early stories in Face to Face, published in 1949.|$|E

500|$|One {{of their}} {{foremost}} grievances was the <b>colour</b> <b>bar</b> {{operated by the}} Bristol Omnibus Company, which had been a nationalised company owned by the British government since 1950, and operated through the Transport Holding Company. Although there was a reported labour shortage on the buses, black prospective employees were refused work as bus crews, although they were employed in lower paid positions in workshops and canteens. The Bristol Evening Post and the Western Daily Press both ran series on the <b>colour</b> <b>bar,</b> which was blamed by company management on the Transport and General Workers' Union (TGWU), which represented bus workers. Local union officials denied {{that there was any}} <b>colour</b> <b>bar,</b> but in 1955 the Passenger Group of the TGWU had passed a resolution that [...] "coloured" [...] workers should not be employed as bus crews. Andrew Hake, curator of the Bristol Industrial Mission, recalled that [...] "The TGWU in the city had said that if one black man steps on the platform as a conductor, every wheel will stop." ...|$|E
500|$|In the {{following}} months he tabled questions and intervened in debates {{on behalf of}} various progressive causes. For example, on 29 September 1942 he asked the prime minister to [...] "make friendly representations to the American military authorities asking them to instruct their men that the <b>colour</b> <b>bar</b> is not a custom in this country". He continued to write the Hickey column, and used his parliamentary salary to fund a constituency office in Maldon.|$|E
500|$|As MP for Bristol South East, Benn helped organise the 1963 Bristol Bus Boycott {{against the}} <b>colour</b> <b>bar</b> of the Bristol Omnibus Company against {{employing}} Black British and British Asian drivers. Benn {{said that he}} would [...] "stay off the buses, even if I have to find a bike", and Labour leader Harold Wilson also told an anti-apartheid rally in London he was [...] "glad that so many Bristolians are supporting the [...] campaign", adding that he [...] "wish them every success".|$|E
5000|$|As {{noted by}} one historian, [...] "Full employment, in {{combination}} with labour controls, limitations on the free movement and employment of non-whites, {{and the use of}} <b>colour</b> <b>bars</b> at company level, contributed to high levels of disposable income for the white population".|$|R

5000|$|The {{actions taken}} have been {{described}} as [...] "ugly Tory racism" [...] which [...] "killed rational debate about immigration". However, <b>colour</b> <b>bars</b> were then common, preventing non-whites from using facilities. The Labour club in Smethwick operated one, as did the local Sandwell Youth Club, which was run by one of the town's Labour councillors.|$|R
500|$|Several {{members of}} the city's West Indian {{community}} set up an organisation, the West Indian Development Council, to fight discrimination of this sort, aided by Stephenson, who was the city's first black youth officer. In 1963 Stephenson established that the bus company was indeed operating a <b>colour</b> <b>bar</b> and inspired by the example of Rosa Parks' refusal to move off a [...] "whites only" [...] bus seat in Montgomery, Alabama, leading to the Montgomery Bus Boycott, a Bristol bus boycott was organised.|$|E
500|$|The Bristol Bus Boycott of 1963 {{arose from}} the refusal of the Bristol Omnibus Company to employ black or Asian bus crews {{in the city of}} Bristol, England. In common with other British cities, there was {{widespread}} racial discrimination in housing and employment at that time against [...] "coloureds". Led by youth worker Paul Stephenson and the West Indian Development Council, the boycott of the company's buses by Bristolians lasted for four months until the company backed down and overturned the <b>colour</b> <b>bar.</b>|$|E
500|$|For Kenyatta, {{independence}} meant {{not just}} self-rule, but {{an end to}} the <b>colour</b> <b>bar</b> and to the patronising attitudes and racist slang of Kenya's white minority. According to Murray-Brown, Kenyatta's [...] "basic philosophy" [...] throughout his life was that [...] "all men deserved the right to develop peacefully according to their own wishes". Kenyatta expressed this in his statement that [...] "I have stood always for the purposes of human dignity in freedom, and for the values of tolerance and peace." [...] This approach was similar to the Zambian President Kenneth Kaunda's ideology of [...] "African humanism".|$|E

5000|$|Test cards {{typically}} {{contain a}} set of patterns to enable television cameras and receivers to be adjusted to show the picture correctly (See SMPTE color bars). Most modern test cards include {{a set of}} calibrated <b>colour</b> <b>bars</b> which will produce a characteristic pattern of [...] "dot landings" [...] on a vectorscope, allowing chroma and tint to be precisely adjusted between generations of videotape or network feeds. SMPTE bars—and several other test cards—include analog black (a flat waveform at 7.5 IRE, or the NTSC setup level), full white (100 IRE), and a [...] "sub-black", or [...] "blacker-than-black" [...] (at 0 IRE), which represents the lowest low-frequency transmission voltage permissible in NTSC broadcasts (though the negative excursions of the colourburst signal may go below 0 IRE). Between the <b>colour</b> <b>bars</b> and proper adjustment of brightness and contrast controls {{to the limits of}} perception of the first sub-black bar, an analogue receiver (or other equipment such as VTRs) can be adjusted to provide impressive fidelity.|$|R
500|$|Negotiations {{between the}} bus {{company and the}} union {{continued}} for several months until a mass meeting of 500 bus workers agreed on 27 August to end the <b>colour</b> <b>bar.</b> On 28 August 1963 Ian Patey announced {{that there would be}} no more discrimination in employing bus crews. It was on the same day that Martin Luther King made his famous [...] "I Have a Dream" [...] speech at the March on Washington. On 17 September, Raghbir Singh, a Sikh, became Bristol's first non-white bus conductor. A few days later two Jamaican and two Pakistani men joined him.|$|E
500|$|In January 1955 the Passenger group, that is {{the section}} {{representing}} those working in Passenger Transport, of the local branch of the Transport and General Workers Union had passed a resolution that [...] "coloured workers should not be employed as bus crews" [...] by the Bristol Omnibus Company. The Bristol Evening Post ran {{a series of articles}} in 1961 exposing this <b>colour</b> <b>bar.</b> The union publicly denied the bar, but the company general manager, Ian Petey, did admit it. He attempted to justify the company policy by stating in a meeting with the city's Joint Transport Committee that he [...] "had 'factual evidence' that the introduction of coloured crews in other cities downgraded the job, causing existing (white) staff to go elsewhere." ...|$|E
500|$|Having {{turned down}} an offer in 1947 {{to return to his}} old employer, Trinidad Leaseholds, in 1954 Constantine agreed to join the same company as an {{assistant}} legal advisor. Uncertain about going back to Trinidad after living for 25 years in England, he nevertheless believed it was a good time to return, particularly as his daughter was moving there to marry. Before leaving England, he published his book <b>Colour</b> <b>Bar</b> (1954), which addressed race relations in Britain and the racism he had experienced. It also discussed worldwide racial oppression and how the lives of black people could be improved. At the time, according to Peter Mason, this was [...] "an explosive, challenging, hard hitting tome, the more so because it came not from a known black militant but from someone who seemed so charming, so unruffled, so suited to British society". Although not viewed as radical by black audiences, it was aimed at white British readers. The British press gave it mixed reviews and criticised him for unfairness in parts of the book; other critics accused him of communist sympathies.|$|E

In Seoul, one could see <b>colour</b> <b>bars</b> on particular channels of the VHF band used by (North) Korean Central Television. Now jamming with random signals on those channels is not done, but the channels are used for DMB broadcasting. The digital broadcasts provide reliable portable digital television multimedia broadcasts, but cause severe interference with the North Korean analogue signals.|$|R
50|$|Until 1960, Portuguese {{military}} forces serving in Guinea were composed of units led by white officers, with commissioned soldiers (whites), overseas soldiers (African assimilados), and native or indigenous Africans (indigenato) {{serving in the}} enlisted ranks.

2500|$|US Armed Forces {{were still}} racially segregated, and the {{soldiers}} of 1511 Quartermaster Truck were almost entirely black, while {{all but one of}} the officers were white, as were the MPs. Military commanders tended to treat these service units as [...] "dumping grounds" [...] for less competent officers, and leadership in the unit was poor. Racial tensions were exacerbated by the riots in Detroit earlier that week which had led to 34 deaths, including 25 black casualties. The people of Bamber Bridge supported the black troops, and when American commanders demanded a <b>colour</b> <b>bar</b> in the town, all three pubs in the town reportedly posted [...] "Black Troops Only" [...] signs.|$|E

White labour {{is every bit as}} much enslaved as black labour; and is actually enslaved by a method and a model only intended for black labour. We might think it rather odd if the exact regulations about flogging negroes were reproduced as a plan for punishing strikers; or if industrial arbitration issued its reports in the precise terminology of the Fugitive Slave Law. But this is in essentials what has happened; and one could almost fancy some negro orgy of triumph, with the beating of gongs and all the secret violence of Voodoo, crying aloud to some ancestral Mumbo Jumbo that the Poor White Trash was being treated according to its name.|$|E
