25|$|The most {{brilliant}} analysis ever {{done on a}} structural puzzle was surely the solution (1953) of the terramycin problem. It was a problem of great industrial importance, and hence many able chemists had performed {{an enormous amount of}} work trying to determine the structure. There seemed to be too much data to resolve the problem, because a significant number of observations, although experimentally correct, were very misleading. Woodward took a large piece of cardboard, wrote on it all the facts and, by thought alone, deduced the correct structure for terramycin. Nobody else <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>that</b> at the time.|$|E
500|$|Oxford's Foord-Weston {{said the}} {{conditions}} were [...] "pretty grim" [...] but their training at Dorney {{during the week}} running up to the race had prepared them for the [...] "horrible winds". [...] Cambridge's number seven, Emily Day, said [...] "it was pretty windy ... we had the race of our lives ... there's nothing we <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>that</b> we didn't do." ...|$|E
500|$|It {{was some}} {{months before the}} {{department}} was established; in the meantime Howe supervised the War Purchasing Board. Howe worked to persuade many of his business contacts to work for him, or for other government departments. Roberts suggests that no [...] "political minister" [...] <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>that,</b> as many of Howe's recruits were Conservatives. [...] According to historian and author Michael Bliss, [...] "or Howe and other entrepreneurial spirits interested in the creative uses of government power, the war {{was a kind of}} ultimate megaproject, a great development job. Money didn't matter, production did." ...|$|E

500|$|During {{recording}} {{sessions for}} The Slip, Reznor sent the track [...] "Discipline" [...] to radio stations himself on April 22. The track was sent before {{the remainder of}} the album was completed, and less than 24hours after the track had been mastered by Alan Moulder. On the same day, the track was also made available for download at the official Nine Inch Nails website for free, as well as multitrack files of the song for remixing. Reznor reflected on the quick turnaround by saying, [...] "That was fun [...] you never <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>that</b> before", referring to his past career on major record labels. [...] "Discipline" [...] was the first Nine Inch Nails single to be released independently via The Null Corporation.|$|E
500|$|Corgan insisted {{during this}} period that the band would not reform, {{although}} when Zwan broke up he announced, [...] "I think my heart was in Smashing Pumpkins [...] I think it was naive of {{me to think that}} I could find something that would mean as much to me." [...] Corgan said in 2005, [...] "I never wanted to leave the Smashing Pumpkins. That was never the plan." [...] On February 17, 2004, Corgan posted a message on his personal blog calling Wretzky a [...] "mean-spirited drug addict" [...] and blaming Iha for the breakup of the Smashing Pumpkins. On June 3, 2004, he added that [...] "the depth of my hurt [...] is only matched with the depth of my gratitude". Iha responded to Corgan's claims in 2005, saying, [...] "No, I didn't break up the band. The only person who <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>that</b> is Billy." ...|$|E
500|$|Reznor {{returned}} to writing {{soon after the}} release of Ghosts, and after a month of work, The Slip was recorded in three weeks of studio time at Trent Reznor's in-home studio. The album was engineered by Atticus Ross and mixed by Alan Moulder, both of whom co-produced it with Reznor. Originally intended as an EP, in Reznor's own words [...] "it just kept growing legs until it [...] what it is". Some instrumental performances were contributed by NIN live band members Josh Freese, Robin Finck and Alessandro Cortini, though they did not participate in the songwriting process; their contributions were limited to small parts rather than complete song recordings. During recording sessions, Reznor sent the album's first and only single, [...] "Discipline", to radio stations before the remainder of the album was completed, and less than 24hours after the track had been mastered. According to Reznor, the track listing and lyrics were finished on a Wednesday, the final mix and album sequencing on Thursday, the mastering on Friday, artwork on Saturday and the album was released on Sunday, May 5. Reznor reflected on the quick turnaround by saying [...] "that was fun [...] you never <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>that</b> before", referring to the slow and bureaucratic pace of record production, promotion and release he experienced with major record labels.|$|E

2500|$|George Clinton {{produced}} the next album, Freaky Styley (1985). Clinton combined various elements of punk and funk into the band's repertoire, allowing their music to incorporate {{a variety of}} distinct styles. The album featured Maceo Parker and Fred Wesley {{on many of the}} album's tracks. The band often indulged in heavy heroin use while recording the album, which influenced the lyrics and musical direction of the album. The band had a much better relationship with Clinton than with Gill, but Freaky Styley, released on August 16, 1985, also achieved little success, failing to make an impression on any chart. The subsequent tour was also considered unproductive by the band. Despite the lack of success, the band was satisfied with Freaky Styley; Kiedis reflected, that [...] "it so surpassed anything we thought we <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>that</b> we were thinking we were on the road to enormity." [...] The band appeared in the 1986 movie Thrashin' (directed by David Winters and starring Josh Brolin) playing the song [...] "Blackeyed Blonde" [...] from Freaky Styley. During this time the band also appeared in the movie Tough Guys starring Burt Lancaster and Kirk Douglas performing the song [...] "Set It Straight" [...] at a Los Angeles nightclub.|$|E
2500|$|On 22 January 2007, {{the punk}} wave {{magazine}} Side-Line {{broke the story}} the Police would reunite for the Grammys, and would perform [...] "Roxanne". Side-Line also stated the Police were {{to embark on a}} massive world tour. Billboard magazine later confirmed the news, quoting Andy Summers' 2006 statement as to how the band could have continued post-Synchronicity: [...] "The more rational approach would have been, 'OK, Sting, go make a solo record, and let's get back together in two or three years.' I'm certain we <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>that.</b> Of course we could have. We were definitely not in a creative dry space. We could have easily carried on, and we could probably still be there. That wasn't to be our fate. It went in another way. I regret we never paid it off with a last tour." [...] The band opened the 49th Annual Grammy Awards on 11 February 2007 in Los Angeles, announcing, [...] "Ladies and gentlemen, we are the Police, and we're back!" [...] before launching into [...] "Roxanne". After the dissolution of the Police, Sting adamantly refused to reunite with Copeland or Summers for any prolonged period, often commenting [...] "If I ever reform the Police I should be certified insane." [...] However, by 2007, he had a change of heart. When asked what prompted the reunion, Sting said [...] "I'd just done the lute album—Songs from the Labyrinth. I was thinking: 'Well what do I do? What's going to surprise people?' I just had this instinct, this desire to call the guys up and say: 'Let's give this a go.'" [...] Sting added he saw the reunion as [...] "a kind of healing. I think solving problems is an exercise worth doing".|$|E

60|$|During {{the time}} of my illness, we were still in London, where Mrs. Woodcourt had come, on my {{guardian}}'s invitation, to stay with us.
