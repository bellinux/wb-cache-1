5|$|Caesar became consul in 59 BC. His colleague, Marcus Calpurnius Bibulus, was {{an extreme}} aristocrat. Caesar {{submitted}} {{the laws that}} he had promised Pompey to the assemblies. Bibulus attempted to obstruct the enactment of these laws, and so Caesar used violent means to ensure their passage. Caesar was then made governor of three provinces. He facilitated {{the election of the}} former patrician Publius Clodius Pulcher to the tribunate for 58 BC. Clodius set about depriving Caesar's senatorial enemies of two of their more obstinate leaders in Cato and <b>Cicero.</b> Clodius was a bitter opponent of <b>Cicero</b> because <b>Cicero</b> had testified against him in a sacrilege case. Clodius attempted to try <b>Cicero</b> for executing citizens without a trial during the Catiline conspiracy, resulting in <b>Cicero</b> going into self-imposed exile and his house in Rome being burnt down. Clodius also passed a bill that forced Cato to lead the invasion of Cyprus which would keep him away from Rome for some years. Clodius also passed a law to expand the previous partial grain subsidy to a fully free grain dole for citizens.|$|E
5|$|Once the British {{were aware}} of the leak, they were {{concerned}} that <b>Cicero</b> had leaked information that might help crack the British cipher, but that did not occur. Lastly, the intelligence might have made the Germans believe that there was no danger of attack in the Balkans, which may have been the most potentially damaging information gleaned by <b>Cicero</b> for the Germans.|$|E

50|$|<b>Cicero's</b> {{father was}} a well-to-do equestrian (knight) with good {{connections}} in Rome. Though he was a semi-invalid who could not enter public life, he compensated for this by studying extensively. Although {{little is known about}} <b>Cicero's</b> mother, Helvia, it was common for the wives of important Roman citizens to be responsible for the management of the household. <b>Cicero's</b> brother Quintus wrote in a letter that she was a thrifty housewife.|$|R
40|$|We {{propose a}} {{comparison}} between Descartes’ and <b>Cicero’s</b> Ethics. Both started from the doubt, but the first one left the moral philosophy under the doubt while the other projected it to the excellence. We underline that <b>Cicero’s</b> book On the Duties contains –even nowadays– a program for the youth: leadership, social commitment and courage. And we add that <b>Cicero’s</b> ethics lean on the wise man example: the one who dares to remain alone...|$|R
5|$|The only extant {{pieces of}} the Consolatio are fragments, of which seven were {{preserved}} by the early Christian author Lactantius in his work Divinarum Institutionum (The Divine Institutes). In the work, Lactantius used the excerpt from the Consolatio both {{to point out the}} futility of paganism, as well as to argue that pagans actually accept some tenets of Christianity, without them even realizing it. Lactantius criticized what <b>Cicero</b> wrote, but also applauded <b>Cicero</b> for paralleling—albeit coincidentally—what the Bible says at times. However, the quotes preserved by Lactantius have been criticized due to their lack of context. MacKendrick notes that Lactantius was using partial quotations in order to frame what <b>Cicero</b> wrote so that Lactantius could more easily refute his ideas. Other excerpts from the Consolatio were preserved by <b>Cicero</b> himself, of which two sections were quoted by him in his Tusculanae Disputationes.|$|E
5|$|When the <b>Cicero</b> {{documents}} predicted Allied bombing {{missions in}} the Balkans, {{which took place}} on the predicted date, the authenticity of the information was supported and his reputation enhanced. Moyzisch told <b>Cicero</b> {{that at the end of}} the war Hitler intended to give him a villa.|$|E
5|$|A {{reference}} to the Consolatio made by the Christian theologian Jerome in a consolation letter to Heliodorus of Altino concerning the death of St. Nepotian suggests that the work was heavily based on the Greek philosopher Crantor's ancient work De Luctu ("On Grief"). Paul MacKendrick argues that the general outline for the Consolatio can be deduced based both on the structure used by Servius Sulpicius Rufus in a consolation letter sent to <b>Cicero</b> following Tullia's death, {{as well as the}} structure of Cicero's reply. From what little remains of the work, {{it would appear that the}} piece was addressed to <b>Cicero</b> himself. A novel part of the Consolatio seems to be Cicero's idea that Tullia deserves to be deified as a god. <b>Cicero</b> notes that, in order for his plan to work, her assent must both be recognized by the gods, as well as the Roman public. In order to win over the public, he concludes that he will build Tullia a shrine.|$|E

40|$|<b>Cicero's</b> general {{interest}} in Dicaearchus' ethical and political thought {{can be detected}} in his letters to Atticus and De legibus. At present, however, we do not possess a clear and detailed picture of Dicaearchus' influence on <b>Cicero's</b> own ethical and political thought. This chapter argues that, despite these obstacles, we can construct a positive account {{of the nature and}} extent of Dicaearchus' influence that offers new insights into key aspects of <b>Cicero's</b> philosophical thought and practice. First it offers a novel reconstruction of Dicaearchus' argument for the supremacy of the praktikos bios and his relationship with Aristotle and Theophrastus in the Peripatetic tradition. The chapter then considers how Dicaearchus figures in <b>Cicero's</b> political and ethical deliberations by analysing a letter to Atticus in which Dicaearchus is referred to by name. At this point we are in a position to identify the precise nature of Dicaearchus' influence on <b>Cicero's</b> De republica, which is the subject of the final and concluding section. Here the chapter argues that <b>Cicero's</b> vision of philosophy and its role in Roman political culture, as showcased in the preface to De republica, is appropriated in all fundamental respects from Dicaearchu...|$|R

5|$|<b>Cicero</b> {{decided to}} stay with his friend Titus Pomponius Atticus for a time, during which he perused Atticus's library, reading any and all books that dealt with {{overcoming}} grief. Unsatisfied with what he found, he relocated to his villa at Astura, where he composed the Consolatio. It was during this time that he also wrote the famed—and now lost—dialogue Hortensius. <b>Cicero</b> later opined that the Consolatio was written in an attempt not only to heal himself emotionally, but also to benefit others who are mourning or experiencing sadness.|$|E
5|$|<b>Cicero,</b> upon {{becoming}} consul, immediately {{moved to}} strike a deal with his consular colleague Hybrida, who had supported Catiline and his party, and who might join a rebellion against the state. In exchange for what amounted to the sole consulship for <b>Cicero,</b> Hybrida was to receive the rich consular province of Macedonia. Hybrida himself was heavily in debt and was wasteful of his money, and the wealth of Macedonia {{could be used by}} him to restore his lost fortune.|$|E
5|$|In 1988, Ryan White spoke {{before the}} President's Commission on the AIDS Epidemic. Ryan White told the {{commission}} of the discrimination he had faced when he first tried to return to school, but how education about the disease had made him welcome {{in the town of}} <b>Cicero.</b> Ryan White emphasized his differing experiences in Kokomo and <b>Cicero</b> {{as an example of the}} power and importance of AIDS education.|$|E
50|$|Sextus Roscius of Ameria was acquitted. As {{his first}} major case, it was of great benefit to <b>Cicero's</b> reputation, {{especially}} given that he was opposing powerful political interests. Indeed, his success may well have incurred the wrath of Sulla, and perhaps influenced <b>Cicero's</b> decision to travel to Athens the following year. <b>Cicero's</b> oration {{in this case is}} notable for its intense and exhaustive style; something that he would learn to improve on as he matured and learnt new styles of oratory.|$|R
50|$|The son of Q. Valerius Soranus {{is thought}} to have been the Quintus Valerius Orca who was praetor in 57 BC. Orca had worked for <b>Cicero's</b> return to public life and is among <b>Cicero's</b> correspondents in the Epistulae ad familiares (Letters to Friends and Family).|$|R
40|$|<b>Cicero's</b> last {{fight for}} the {{republic}} and against Antony has always attracted interest, philological as well as historical. The modern scholarship on the topic is extensive, however not focused on exploring the underlying motives for <b>Cicero's</b> sudden action in the autumn 44 BC. This author will challenge the provocative and condemnatory view of Sir Ronald Syme, often taken at its face value without further reconsideration, by analysing <b>Cicero's</b> thoughts during 44 of the republic, the conspirators, Antony and Octavian on both a practical and a theoretical level. By tracing these thoughts back to his earlier career a pattern of general notions on the republic and {{the duties of the}} statesman can be discovered and used to explain <b>Cicero's</b> actions in 44 Bc...|$|R
5|$|Marcus Tullius <b>Cicero</b> (January 3, 106 BC – December 7, 43 BC) was an Ancient Roman {{philosopher and}} politician, {{famous for his}} oratory skills. He came from a wealthy {{municipal}} family of the Roman equestrian order, and is widely considered one of Rome's greatest orators, {{and one of the}} premier prose stylists during the Golden Age of Latin. Tullia (August 5, 79 BC or 78 BC – February 45 BC), Cicero's daughter, died in the winter of 45 BC after giving birth to her second son; this caused <b>Cicero</b> to go into a period of deep mourning.|$|E

5|$|A film {{based on}} the book Operation <b>Cicero</b> by Moyzisch was {{released}} by 20th Century Fox in 1952. It was titled 5 Fingers and directed by Joseph L. Mankiewicz. Bazna, renamed Ulysses Diello, was played by James Mason.|$|E
25|$|Among <b>Cicero's</b> admirers were Desiderius Erasmus, Martin Luther, and John Locke.

5|$|After the war ended, the OSS {{conducted}} {{an investigation into}} <b>Cicero,</b> interviewing key German players including Moyzisch. It was postulated that of the intelligence conveyed by <b>Cicero</b> to the Germans, the most notable information came from Knatchbull-Hugessen's notes, particularly regarding diplomatic efforts with the Turkish government. Many of the other documents were considered by Ostuf Schuddekoft, head of the British section of Amt VI , to be {{too old to be}} of much value to the Germans. Moyzisch was aggressively interviewed by the Allies and was a witness at the Nuremberg trials, after which he wrote a book to address rumors and explain his role during the war. He was never charged with a war crime.|$|E
5|$|Another {{well-known}} artefact with {{an astronomical}} use is the Antikythera mechanism. In this case {{analysis of the}} artefact, and reference to the description of similar devices described by <b>Cicero,</b> would indicate a plausible use for the device.

5|$|Archimedes {{died during}} the Siege of Syracuse {{when he was killed}} by a Roman soldier despite orders that he should not be harmed. <b>Cicero</b> {{describes}} visiting the tomb of Archimedes, which was surmounted by a sphere and a cylinder, which Archimedes had requested to be placed on his tomb, representing his mathematical discoveries.|$|E

5000|$|Years later, after Caesar's assassination, Antony and Octavian proscribed {{a number}} of enemies, and <b>Cicero's</b> {{was one of the}} first names Antony put down.

50|$|Both Tullia and Terentia {{protested the}} exile publicly. They wore their hair unkempt {{and put on}} black {{mourning}} clothes.

After <b>Cicero's</b> house on the Palatine Hill was burned down by Clodius' mob, Terentia took refuge in the house of the Vestal Virgins. Although she may have also stayed at the home of Tullia's husband Piso, it is likely that Terentia spent the entire duration of <b>Cicero's</b> exile living with Fabia and the Vestals.|$|R
5|$|In March 2005, British Foreign and Commonwealth Office historians issued The <b>Cicero</b> Papers, an {{analysis}} of the potential consequences of the 'Cicero Affair'.

5|$|Mourning : Trojan and, especially, Troilus' own family's {{mourning}} at {{his death}} seems to have epitomised grief {{at the loss of}} a child in classical civilization. Horace, Callimachus and <b>Cicero</b> all refer to Troilus in this way.|$|E
5|$|Of his written works, {{none have}} survived except as {{fragments}} {{quoted in the}} works of later authors like <b>Cicero,</b> Seneca, Galen, Plutarch, and others.
