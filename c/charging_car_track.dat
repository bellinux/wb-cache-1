40|$|Wireless {{charging}} is {{an important}} issue in wireless sensor networks, since it can provide an emerging and effective solution in the absence of other power supplies. The state-of-the-art methods employ a mobile car and a predefined moving path to charge the sensor nodes in the network. Previous studies only consider a factor of the network (i. e., residual energy of sensor node) as a constraint to design the wireless charging strategy. However, other factors, such as the travelled distance of the mobile car, can also affect the effectiveness of wireless charging strategy. In this work, we study wireless charging strategy based on the analysis of a combination of two factors, including the residual energy of sensor nodes and the travelled distance of the <b>charging</b> <b>car.</b> Firstly, we theoretically analyze the limited size of the sensor network to match the capability of a <b>charging</b> <b>car.</b> Then, the networked factors are selected as the weights of traveling salesman problem (TSP) to design the moving path of the <b>charging</b> <b>car.</b> Thirdly, the <b>charging</b> time of each sensor node is computed based on the linear programming problem for the <b>charging</b> <b>car.</b> Finally, a <b>charging</b> period for the network is studied. The experimental results show that the proposed approach can significantly maximize the lifetime of the wireless sensor network...|$|R

30|$|For {{effective}} <b>car</b> <b>tracking,</b> we utilize multiple video sources including CCTV, drone-mounted cameras, and car dashboard cameras. The role of FD is transferring frames {{from diverse}} video sources to FE for feature extraction. One critical task of this module for accurate <b>car</b> <b>tracking</b> is reliable data transfer. As frames are generated from diverse video devices in real time, the data volume is significant and reliable data transfer is not trivial [32]. In addition, the frames must be processed rapidly, or {{the entire system}} could stop because of buffer overflow. To prevent this, we use a Kafka cluster for frame distribution and storage.|$|R
30|$|Frame Extractor {{extracts}} diverse {{features for}} <b>car</b> <b>tracking</b> from the frames in the Kafka cluster nodes through image and metadata processing.

Although for simplicity, the plate number is used as the only feature of the vehicle in this study; additional features such as color, vehicle type, and moving direction {{can be used for}} more versatile <b>car</b> <b>tracking.</b>|$|R
