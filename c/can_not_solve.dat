50|$|A common {{technique}} {{to deal with}} RFI within the observed frequency bandwidth, is to employ RFI detection in software. Such software can find samples in time, frequency or time-frequency space that are contaminated by an interfering source. These samples are subsequently ignored in further analysis of the observed data. This process {{is often referred to}} as data flagging. Because most transmitters have a small bandwidth and are not continuously present such as lightning or citizens' band (CB) radio devices, most of the data remains available for the astronomical analysis. However, data flagging <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>solve</b> issues with continuous broad-band transmitters, such as windmills, digital video or digital audio transmitters.|$|E
