We aimed here to detect <b>cancer-related</b> <b>gene</b> mutations in routine fecal specimen; dried feces spots (DFS) on a filter paper especially designated for an automated fecal occult blood (FOB) test. DNA was simply extracted from a 3 mm disc of DFS (including around 10 mg feces) with a boiling procedure followed by a cationic surfactant extraction. K-ras common mutations, as the typical <b>cancer-related</b> <b>gene</b> alterations, were detected with a nested allele specific PCR with microfluorometry (ASP/MFL). Adequate DNA was recovered from 363 / 451 (80. 5 %) DFS specimens tested. The K-ras mutations were detected in 2 / 24 (8. 3 %) from patients with colorectal cancer and 13 / 315 (4. 1 %) from screening participants with positive FOB. No mutations were detected in 24 DFS specimens with negative FOB. The results of K-ras mutation frequency were not encouraging to achieve practically a specific dreliable method for colorectal cancer screening. However this report, identifying for the first time a cancer related gene alteration in feces using identical samples with routine FOB test, will be a step to realize a molecular genetic testing for the cancer screening...|$|E

40|$|Over {{the last}} decade, an {{increasing}} number of integrative studies on <b>cancer-related</b> <b>genes</b> have been published. Integrative analyses aim to overcome the limitation of a single data type, and provide a more complete view of carcinogenesis. The vast majority of these studies used sample-matched data of gene expression and copy number to investigate the impact of copy number alteration on gene expression, and to predict and prioritize candidate oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes. However, correlations between genes were neglected in these studies. Our work aimed to evaluate the co-alteration of copy number, methylation and expression, allowing us to identify <b>cancer-related</b> <b>genes</b> and essential functional modules in cancer. We built the Integrated Co-alteration network (ICan) based on multi-omics data, and analyzed the network to uncover <b>cancer-related</b> <b>genes.</b> After comparison with random networks, we identified 155 ovarian <b>cancer-related</b> <b>genes,</b> including well-known (TP 53, BRCA 1, RB 1 and PTEN) and also novel <b>cancer-related</b> <b>genes,</b> such as PDPN and EphA 2. We compared the results with a conventional method: CNAmet, and obtained a significantly better area under the curve value (ICan: 0. 8179, CNAmet: 0. 5183). In this paper, we describe a framework to find <b>cancer-related</b> <b>genes</b> based on an Integrated Co-alteration network.

To {{identify}} novel cervical <b>cancer-related</b> <b>genes</b> {{that are}} regulated by DNA methylation, integrated analyses of genome-wide DNA methylation and RNA expression profiles were performed using the normal and tumor regions of tissues from four patients; two with cervical cancer and two with pre‑invasive cancer.

However, finding a group of interacting genes from thousands of SNPs is challenging. Hence, an efficient and robust algorithm is needed. The genetic algorithm (GA) is useful in searching for the optimal solution from a very large searchable space. In this study, we show that genome-wide interaction analysis using GA and a statistical interaction model can provide a practical method to detect biologically interacting loci. We focus our search on transcriptional regulators by analyzing gene × <b>gene</b> interactions for <b>cancer-related</b> <b>genes.</b> The expression values of three <b>cancer-related</b> <b>genes</b> were selected from the expression data of the Genetic Analysis Workshop 15 Problem 1 data set.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{discusses the}} use of automated natural language processing (NLP) for characterization of biomolecular events in signal transduction pathway databases. I also discuss {{the use of}} a dynamic map engine for efficiently navigating large biomedical document collections and functionally annotating high-throughput genomic data. An application is presented where NLP software, beginning with genomic expression data, automatically identifies and joins disparate experimental observations supporting biochemical interaction relationships between candidate genes in the Wnt signaling pathway. I discuss the need for accurate named entity resolution to the biological sequence databases and how sequence-based approaches can unambiguously link automatically-extracted assertions to their respective biomolecules in a high-speed manner. I then demonstrate a search engine, BioSearch- 2 D, which renders the contents of large biomedical document collections into a single, dynamic map. With this engine, the prostate cancer epigenetics literature is analyzed and I demonstrate that the summarization map closely matches that provided by expert human review articles. Examples include displays which prominently feature genes such as the androgen receptor and glutathione S-transferase P 1 together with the National Library of Medicine’s Medical Subject Heading (MeSH) descriptions which match the roles described for those genes in the human review articles. In a second application of BioSearch- 2 D, I demonstrate the engine’s application as a context-specific functional annotation system for <b>cancer-related</b> <b>gene</b> signatures. Our engine matches the annotation produced by a Gene Ontology-based annotation engine for 6 <b>cancer-related</b> <b>gene</b> signatures. Additionally, it assigns highly-significant MeSH terms as annotation for the gene list which are not produced by the GO-based engine. I find that the BioSearch- 2 D display facilitates both the exploration of large document collections in the biomedical literature as well as provides users with an accurate annotation engine for ad-hoc gene sets.

40|$|Abstract—High-throughput data such as microarrays make it {{possible}} to investigate the molecular-level mechanism of cancer more efficiently. Computational methods boost the microarray analysis by managing large and complex data systematically. However, combinatorial interactions among genes have not been considered as a unit of the analysis since previous methods mainly focus on a whole gene or a single isolated gene. Here, we introduce a molecular evolutionary algorithm called probabilistic library model (PLM). In the PLM, library elements are generated from gene combinations. An evolutionary procedure is adopted to learn the probabilistic distribution of training samples. We apply the PLM to prostate cancer microarray data. The experimental results show that the PLM classifiers perform better than conventional methods such as neural networks and decision trees in accuracy. We also examine the evolved library to find <b>cancer-related</b> <b>gene</b> combinations. Keywords-component; Microarrays; Probabilistic library model; Prostate cancer classificatio...|$|E
40|$|D ow nloaded from 2 It is {{well known}} that many genes implicated in the {{development}} and progression of breast cancer undergo aberrant alternative splicing events to produce proteins with pro-cancer properties. These changes in alternative splicing can arise from mutations or single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within the DNA sequences of <b>cancer-related</b> <b>genes,</b> which can strongly affect the activity of splicing factors and influence the splice site choice. However, {{it is important to note}} that absence of mutations is not sufficient to prevent misleading choices in splice site selection. There is now increasing evidence to demonstrate that the expression profile of ten splicing factors (including SRs and hnRNPs) and eight RNA-binding proteins changes in breast cancer cells compared with normal cells. These modifications strongly influence the alternative splicing pattern of many <b>cancer-related</b> <b>genes</b> despite the absence of any detrimental mutations within their DNA sequences. Thus, a comprehensive assessment of the splicing factor status in breast cancer is important to provide insights into the mechanisms that lead to breast cancer development and metastasis. Whilst most studies focus on mutations that affect alternative splicing in <b>cancer-related</b> <b>genes,</b> this review focuses on splicing factors and RNA-binding proteins that are themselves deregulated in breast cancer and implicated in cancer-related alternative splicing events...|$|R

From a surgical perspective, genomic profiling also provides prognostic and predictive information and closely relates to determination of surgical strategy. Both the genomic analysis technology and the informatics for the cancer genome data base are rapidly developing. In this paper, we have gathered existing information on the thyroid <b>cancer-related</b> <b>genes</b> involved in the initiation and progression of thyroid cancer. Our goal is to assemble a glossary for the current ThyroSeq genomic panel that can help elucidate the role genomics play in thyroid cancer oncogenesis...|$|R
