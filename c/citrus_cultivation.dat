One factor cited in the growth of the export market was the development of steamships {{in the first half of}} the 19th century, which enabled the export of oranges to the European markets in days rather than weeks. Another reason cited for the growth of the industry was the relative lack of European control over the cultivation of oranges compared to cotton, formerly a primary commodity crop of Palestine, but outpaced by the Jaffa orange.|$|E

It took place {{off the coast of}} Vélez-Málaga on August 24, 1704.Vélez-Málaga was {{constituted}} in the neuralgic center of the zone, that still today maintains like capital of the Axarquía. In Torre del Mar most of the vine and <b>citrus</b> <b>cultivations</b> of the region were concentrated and from there they were sold and exported to northern Europe. Other lands were dedicated to the cultivation of cereals, vegetables and sugar cane.During the seventeenth century there was a decline in population, due to the epidemics and wars that affected Spain at the time. The incursions of the Turkish and Berber pirates were constant in this century. The watchtowers on the coast gave alarm to the detachment based in Vélez, which temporarily housed the Captaincy General de la Costa. The municipal Cabildo was monopolized by the oligarchy and even the regiments became private property. From 1640 it had its own corregimiento.Vélez-Málaga supported the Bourbons during the War of Spanish Succession, and witnessed on 23 August 1704 the naval confrontation known as the Battle of Vélez-Málaga, in which a Spanish-French fleet faced an Anglo-Dutch fleet [...] Between them, 146 boats were put and more than 46,000 men in combat, of which they died more than 4,500, without that neither part was clearly seen as victorious. The 18th century was a time of growth in which many churches and public buildings are built or restored.

Since many Sicilian farmers in recent years have decided to abandon conventional lemon orchards, in this paper we have evaluated the financial sustainability of organic lemon production by comparing it with the conventional one. Financial analysis has been carried out in a case study on the northwestern coast of Sicily, considering a 50 -year economic life of an orchard. The results, per hectare of area, showed a clear advantage of organic lemon orchard. This was due to fewer labor requirements and to greater market appreciation for organic products that better ensured a premium price. Moreover, financial indicators of organic lemon orchards and the deployment of environmental-friendly inputs in the production process render these farms competitive and eco-friendly...|$|R

Results, which referred to one hectare area, showed both a higher economic and financial sustainability of organic farming respect to conventional farming.

Despite the fact that the influence of land use practice on Rs has been widely studied, the patterns and drivers on Rs of <b>Citrus</b> reticulata <b>cultivation,</b> a worldwide land use practice are unclear. In this current study, we investigated the influence of long-term <b>cultivation</b> of <b>Citrus</b> reticulata (CO) and of CO intercropped with soybean (CB) on soil nutrients, water availability, and Rs in southern China. Results indicated that after 21 years of cultivation, CO and CB significantly increased total soil carbon (TC), total soil nitrogen (TN), and soil organic matter (OM) at 0 - 20 cm and 20 - 40 cm, both at upslope and downslope compared with bare soil (CK). However, soil moisture (SM), dissolved organic carbon (DOC), and microbial biomass carbon (MBC) decreased under CB. In addition, no significant variation was found in soil pH between CK, CO, and CB. Across incubation time (56 days), Rs decreased exponentially with incubation time and CB showed the highest Rs rate irrespective of soil depth or topography. Linear regression further showed TC and TN as the two major factors influencing Rs upslope, while DOC was the dominant factor in regulating Rs downslope. These findings demonstrated that long-term <b>cultivation</b> of <b>citrus</b> significantly changed soil nutrients, water availability, and Rs rate...|$|R

40|$|Some {{historians and}} {{commentators}} have advanced {{the hypothesis that}} the development of the citrus industry- which also took place in the XIX century- also {{played an important role in}} favoring the emergence of the Sicilian mafia, especially in the area around Palermo. 1 Indeed, the evolution of international demand for citrus fruits resembles that of sulfur, although the time pattern for citrus is less clear than for sulfur and Sicily was never a quasi-monopolist in the market for citrus fruits as it was in the sulfur market. Although <b>citrus</b> fruits <b>cultivations</b> were especially concentrated in the areas areas around Palermo and the surrounding Conca d’Oro where early mafia’s presence was considerable, as reported in the 1885 parliamentary enquiry (Damiani, 1885), the <b>cultivation</b> of <b>citrus</b> was similarly widespread in the eastern part of Sicily, where the mafia remained virtually absent until the second part of the XX century. One possibly insightful way to empirically investigate this rather puzzling issue is to look at the distribution of the inputs employed in citrus cultivation: land and water. While Sicily’s climatic conditions and soil composition are generally favorable to the <b>cultivation</b> of <b>citrus</b> fruits- particularly in coastal areas- such cultivation requires abundant and regular availability of water which, instead, tends to vary substantially across different areas of Sicily.

40|$|BACKGROUND Scurvy {{disease is}} a {{condition}} due to deficiency of ascorbid acid (vitamin C) and it is characterized by weakness, anemia, appearance of mucocutaneous hemorrhages and induration of muscles in the legs. We report {{a case of a}} young man living in the island of Sicily, Italy. CASE REPORT A 17 years old man was admitted to our hospital for the appearance of diffused cutaneous manifestations. Cause the perception of being overweight, he began autonomously a diet and he didn’t take any fruit or vegetables for several months. At admission we observed the presence of severe muscular hypotrophy associated to hematomas subcutaneous of thorax, trunk and legs. Blood examination showed a mild anemia and the reduction of serum proteins. Coagulation patterns and electrocardiography were normal. Tomography showed the presence of pericardial and pelvic effusion. Transthoracic echocardiography revealed the reduction in wall thickness and a moderate anterior and posterior pericardial effusion with normal systolic and diastolic function. The blood level of vitamin C was considerably lower than normal range. Definitive diagnosis was “scurvy disease”. We start treatment with ascorbic acid at maximum dose combined with hypercaloric diet. Cutaneous lesions resolved in two weeks. After five months, with normalization of ascorbic acid level and complete disappearance of cutaneous manifestations, we repeated echocardiography showing a significantly increasing left ventricular wall thickness and the reduction in pericardial effusion. CONCLUSIONS Scurvy disease is extremely rare in Sicily where <b>citrus</b> fruit <b>cultivations</b> are extensive and typical of the island. Scurvy disease is historically linked to the era of great maritime expeditions, but it still occurs in developed countries and re-emerging in Western countries. In this case we observed a combination of cutaneous and cardiac findings probably due to combined malnutrition and vitamin C deficiency...|$|R
