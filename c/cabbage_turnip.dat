25|$|Along {{with the}} Italian queen Bona Sforza (second wife of Sigismund I of Poland) many Italian cooks came to Poland after 1518. Although native {{vegetable}} foods were an ancient and intrinsic {{part of the}} cuisine, this began {{a period in which}} vegetables like lettuce, leeks, celeriac and cabbage were more widely used. Even today, some of those vegetables are referred to in Polish as włoszczyzna, a word derived from Włochy, the Polish name of Italy. During this period the use of spices, which arrived in Poland via Western Asian trade routes, was common among those who could afford them, and dishes considered elegant could be very spicy. However, the idea that Queen Bona was the first to introduce vegetables to Poland is false. While her southern cooks may have helped elevate and expand the role of various vegetables in royal Polish cuisine, records show that the court of King Jagiello (who died in 1434, over 80 years before her reign) enjoyed a variety of vegetables including lettuce, beets, <b>cabbage,</b> <b>turnip,</b> carrots, peas and cauliflower.|$|E
2500|$|The local gastronomy {{results from}} the fusing of the Minho and fishing cookery. The most {{traditional}} ingredients of the local cuisine are locally-grown vegetables, such as collard greens, <b>cabbage,</b> <b>turnip</b> broccoli, potato, onion, tomato, and {{a wide variety of}} fish. The fish used to create the traditional dishes are divided in two categories, the [...] "poor" [...] fish (sardine, ray, mackerel, whiskered sole, and others) and the [...] "wealthy" [...] fish (such as snook, whiting, and alfonsino).|$|E
60|$|Pieces of {{the leaves}} of <b>cabbage,</b> <b>turnip,</b> {{horse-radish}} and onion were left on the pots during 22 days, and were all attacked {{and had to be}} renewed; but during the whole of this time leaves of an Artemisia and of the culinary sage, thyme and mint, mingled with the above leaves, were quite neglected excepting those of the mint, which were occasionally and very slightly nibbled. These latter four kinds of leaves do not differ in texture in a manner which could make them disagreeable to worms; they all have a strong taste, but so have the four first mentioned kinds of leaves; and the wide difference in the result must be attributed to a preference by the worms for one taste over another.|$|E
50|$|Various meats (pork, beef, chicken, mutton), embutidos, {{vegetables}} (<b>cabbage,</b> <b>turnips,</b> parsnips, potatoes, carrots), chickpeas (garbanzos), etc. are simmered in a pot, {{and sometimes}} other ingredients are added at serving time (such as eggs). Due {{to the wide}} regional diversity of the dish, the word cocido is typically followed by the place of origin (e.g. madrileño, maragato, lebaniego, gallego).|$|R
50|$|These {{settlers}} brought many {{of their}} traditional Russian crops with them. The {{most important of these}} crops was rye, but they also brought other grains such as barley, wheat, Buckwheat, and millet along with vegetables like Peas, <b>Cabbage,</b> <b>Turnips,</b> Carrots, Onions, and Garlic. Like the natives of the Kirghiz Khanate before them, all this Russian crop cultivation was done by plough.|$|R
60|$|There {{was still}} a good fire in the stove, and in the pantry Prissy found the dinner in its raw state--a fine roast of fresh pork, potatoes, <b>cabbage,</b> <b>turnips</b> and the {{ingredients}} of a raisin pudding, for Richard Baker was fond of raisin puddings, and could make {{them as well as}} Mrs. Janeway could, if that was anything to boast of.|$|R
6000|$|It may be {{presumed that}} all animals which feed on various {{substances}} possess {{the sense of}} taste, and this is certainly the case with worms. Cabbage-leaves are much liked by worms; {{and it appears that}} they can distinguish between different varieties; but this may perhaps be owing to differences in their texture. On eleven occasions pieces of the fresh leaves of a common green variety and of the red variety used for pickling were given them, and they preferred the green, the red being either wholly neglected or much less gnawed. On two other occasions, however, they seemed to prefer the red. Half-decayed leaves of the red variety and fresh leaves of the green were attacked about equally. When leaves of the cabbage, horse-radish (a favourite food) and of the onion were given together, the latter were always, and manifestly preferred. Leaves of the cabbage, lime-tree, Ampelopsis, parsnip (Pastinaca), and celery (Apium) were likewise given together; and those of the celery were first eaten. But when leaves of <b>cabbage,</b> <b>turnip,</b> beet, celery, wild cherry and carrots were given together, the two latter kinds, especially those of the carrot, were preferred to all the others, including those of celery. It was also manifest after many trials that wild cherry leaves were greatly preferred to those of the lime-tree and hazel (Corylus). [...] According to Mr. Bridgman the half-decayed leaves of Phlox verna are particularly liked by worms. {16} ...|$|E
6000|$|De Candolle (28/12. 'Geographie Botan.' 1855 page 989.) has fully {{discussed}} the antiquity of various races of plants; {{he states that}} the black seeded poppy was known {{in the time of}} Homer, the white-seeded sesamum by the ancient Egyptians, and almonds with sweet and bitter kernels by the Hebrews; but it does not seem improbable that some of these varieties may have been lost and reappeared. One variety of barley and apparently one of wheat, both of which were cultivated at an immensely remote period by the Lake-inhabitants of Switzerland, still exist. It is said (28/13. Pickering 'Races of Man' 1850 page 318.) that [...] "specimens of a small variety of gourd which is still common in the market of Lima were exhumed from an ancient cemetery in Peru." [...] De Candolle remarks that, in the books and drawings of the sixteenth century, the principal races of the <b>cabbage,</b> <b>turnip,</b> and gourd can be recognised: this might have been expected at so late a period, but whether any of these plants are absolutely identical with our present sub-varieties is not certain. It is, however, said that the Brussels sprout, a variety which in some places is liable to degeneration, has remained genuine for more than four centuries in the district where it is believed to have originated.

5000|$|Like in {{the rest}} of North Africa, {{couscous}} is served on all occasions. It is traditionally eaten with lamb, the semolina must be very fine, and the vegetables (carrots, little white <b>cabbages,</b> <b>turnips,</b> chick peas) only lightly cooked. Depending on the season, the vegetables change: there may also be cardoons, cold broad beans, or pumpkin. Unlike Moroccan tajines, a tajine in Tunisia usually refers to a kind of [...] "quiche" [...] made from beaten eggs and grated cheese consisting of meat and/or various vegetable fillings, prepared like a large cake and cooked in the oven.|$|R

Now and then a farmer's red-faced wife trotted along on horseback, with butter and cheese in two large panniers. The people of the village, with country squires, and other visitors from the neighborhood, walked hither and thither, trading, jesting, quarrelling, and making just such a bustle as their fathers and grandfathers had made half a century before.|$|R

All is covered by second layer of dough. It is sprinkled as previously. 10 or 11 such layers are thus composed and form a conspicuous cake sic." ...|$|R
50|$|The Icelandic cow is a {{dairy breed}} {{with a small}} body-size. About 95% are {{naturally}} polled, but the rest are horned. An average cow can produce about 6000 kg of milk per year, with the best animals producing 11000 kg. They are housed for about eight {{months of the year}} and fed largely on hay, supplemented with cereals. They are grazed outside in the summer, and to prolong the growing season, <b>cabbage,</b> <b>turnips,</b> barley, and oats are grown for forage. Fewer than 30,000 cows are on the island and their milk is used to create a mild, butter-flavoured cheese.|$|R

Condiments are likely to include mustard pickles, pickled beets, cranberry sauce, butter, and a thin gravy made from the drippings of the roasted meat.|$|E
50|$|The {{first sign}} of the {{presence}} of the larvae is a delay in plant growth accompanied by the withering of leaves which develop a bluish tinge. The larvae are found on <b>cabbage,</b> <b>turnip,</b> swede, radish, and other cruciferous crops. Sometimes, 300 larvae can be found on one plant, damaging the inner parts of the main root and disrupting the transport of water and nutrients to the stem and leaves causing the death of many plants.|$|E

The growth of damaged plants is slow and {{development}} is poor resulting in a reduced yield. Large scale attacks cause cessation of growth with the plants exhibiting a leaden hue and wilting, subsequently turning yellow and dying. Control measures include the early planting of strong plants, the use of peat-compost pots, the use of additional fertilizer, deep autumn ploughing after the harvesting of cruciferous crops and insecticide treatments.|$|E
50|$|In {{the late}} 17th century, some farmers {{cultivated}} the first vegetable gardens, but growing vegetables {{did not become}} common until the early 19th century, when the Napoleonic Wars resulted in the merchant ships staying away. Resident Danes, who brought the tradition of vegetable gardens with them, were usually the first to start growing vegetables. Popular early garden vegetables included hardy varieties of <b>cabbage,</b> <b>turnip,</b> rutabaga, and potato. They were generally prepared in Iceland as boiled accompaniments to meats and fish, and sometimes mashed with butter.|$|E

40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to evaluate the phytochemical content and allelopathic potential of two cabbages botanical varieties leaves, ie. cauliflower (Brassica oleracea var. botrytis) and <b>cabbage</b> <b>turnip</b> (B. oleracea var. gongylodes). Their aqueous and organic extracts were evaluated on lettuce (Lactuca sativa) {{and one of the most}} dominant weeds in Tunisia, nettle-leaf goosefoot (Chenopodium murale). Field experiments were conducted to evaluate the smothering potential of the two varieties. The total phenolics, flavonoïds, flavonols and flavones, alkaloïds, and proanthocyanidins contents were higher in the aqueous extracts of both varieties. For organic extracts, petroleum ether and methanol cauliflower extracts and chloroform and methanol <b>cabbage</b> <b>turnip</b> extracts were the richest ones. All aqueous and organic extracts had significantly delayed germination, reduced its rate and affected seedling growth.
