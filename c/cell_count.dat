40|$|Manual <b>cell</b> <b>counting</b> is time {{consuming}} and requires {{a high degree}} of skill on behalf of the person performing the count.

Digital holography can provide both quantitative and qualitative phase information from a single hologram. The recently constructed microscope HolomonitorTM M 2 combines digital holography with the benefits of the commonly used phase contrast microscope, allowing us to combine the advantages of light imaging with the possibility of achieving quantitative information on cellular shape, area, confluence and optical thickness. This project aimed at determining the accuracy and repeatability of <b>cell</b> <b>counting</b> measurements using digital holography compared to the conventional manual <b>cell</b> <b>counting</b> method using a haemocytometer.

40|$|Dogs {{were exposed}} to either trichloroethylene(TCL) or 1, 1, 1 -trichloroethane(TCE) in order to {{investigate}} {{the effects of these}} solvents on hematologic parameters. Further-more, because of unusual changes in white blood <b>cell</b> <b>counts</b> following exposure of pregnant dogs to these solvents, investigation of the effects of several hormones given prior to exposure to the solvents was pursued. The results obtained were as follows. 1. White blood <b>cell</b> <b>counts</b> showed a marked decrease immediately after starting exposure to TCL or 1, 1, 1 -TCE, though the decrease was temporary. On the other hand red blood <b>cell</b> <b>counts,</b> hematocrit values and blood platelet counts showed no changes. 2. While each kind of white blood cell decreased in number, the degree was greatest in neutrophils. 3. TCL caused a greater decrease in white blood <b>cell</b> <b>counts</b> than 1, 1, 1 -TCE. 4.

Fortunately, most such particles are significantly attenuated by the shielding provided by the aluminium walls of a spacecraft, and can be further diminished by water containers and other barriers. However, the impact of the cosmic rays upon the shielding produces additional radiation that can affect the crew. Further research will be needed to assess the radiation hazards and determine suitable countermeasures.|$|E

Hence CD 4 + T lymphocyte count {{is the most important}} marker of immune dysfunction in HIV disease progression. The estimation of CD 4 + T <b>cell</b> <b>counts</b> is used to decide the initiation of anti retroviral therapy (ART), to monitor the efficacy of ART and to start treatment for opportunistic infections (OIs).

5|$|The {{diagnosis}} of dengue is typically made clinically, {{on the basis}} of reported symptoms and physical examination; this applies especially in endemic areas. However, early disease can be difficult to differentiate from other viral infections. A probable diagnosis is based on the findings of fever plus two of the following: nausea and vomiting, rash, generalized pains, low white blood <b>cell</b> <b>count,</b> positive tourniquet test, or any warning sign (see table) in someone who lives in an endemic area. Warning signs typically occur before the onset of severe dengue. The tourniquet test, which is particularly useful in settings where no laboratory investigations are readily available, involves the application of a blood pressure cuff at between the diastolic and systolic pressure for five minutes, followed by the counting of any petechial hemorrhages; a higher number makes a {{diagnosis of}} dengue more likely with the cut off being more than 10 to 20 per 1inch2 (6.25cm2).|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} change detectable on laboratory investigations {{is a low}} {{white blood}} <b>cell</b> <b>count,</b> which may then be followed by low platelets and metabolic acidosis. A moderately elevated level of aminotransferase (AST and ALT) from the liver is commonly associated with low platelets and white blood cells. In severe disease, plasma leakage results in hemoconcentration (as indicated by a rising hematocrit) and hypoalbuminemia. Pleural effusions or ascites can be detected by physical examination when large, but the demonstration of fluid on ultrasound may assist in the early identification of dengue shock syndrome. The use of ultrasound is limited by lack of availability in many settings. Dengue shock syndrome is present if pulse pressure drops to ≤20mmHg along with peripheral vascular collapse. Peripheral vascular collapse is determined in children via delayed capillary refill, rapid heart rate, or cold extremities. While warning signs are an important aspect for early detection of potential serious disease, the evidence for any specific clinical or laboratory marker is weak.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Airway {{inflammation}} {{in children}} can be assessed by nonbronchoscopic bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL). Little {{is known about the}} repeatability of <b>cell</b> <b>counts</b> in the BAL obtained. Children (n= 43) attending for elective surgery were studied. <b>Cell</b> <b>counts</b> were obtained following a nonbronchoscopic lavage. Two samples were obtained with either: 1) the catheter wedged in the same position (n= 21) or 2) the catheter reinserted and wedged again (n= 22). Slides (n= 30) from nonbronchoscopic lavage samples were selected at random and two independent observers <b>counted</b> 500 <b>cells</b> on each slide on two occasions. The repeatability of the lavage sampling and <b>cell</b> <b>counting</b> was assessed for different cell types. The inter- and intra-observer repeatability for the differential <b>cell</b> <b>counting</b> demonstrated that there was good repeatability for all cell types except lymphocytes (interobserver: Lin 9 s concordance coefficient 0. 42; repeatability coefficient 0. 66). Quantification of eosinophil (%) was highly repeatable using either method (Lin 9 s concordance coefficient 1) 0. 99, 2) 0. 95; repeatability coefficient 1) 0. 58, 2) 1. 36). Nonbronchoscopic lavage is a repeatable technique for the quantification of eosinophils. Variation in the sampling method can be reduced by taking two separate samples and averaging the differential <b>cell</b> <b>counts.</b> Furthermore, increasing the number of <b>cells</b> <b>counted</b> should ensure accurate quantification of lymphocytes...|$|R
