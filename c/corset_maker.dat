After {{the death of her}} parents, she supported two younger sisters Ida and Karolina by her late mother's trade; that of a corset seamstress.

25|$|Outside the fetish community, {{living history}} re-enactors and {{historic}} costume enthusiasts still wear stays and corsets {{according to their}} original purpose to give the proper shape to the figure when wearing historic fashions. In this case, the corset is underwear rather than outerwear. Skilled <b>corset</b> <b>makers</b> are available to make reproductions of historic corset shapes or to design new styles.|$|R
25|$|The corset {{fell from}} fashion in the 1920s in Europe and North America, {{replaced}} by girdles and elastic brassieres, but survived as {{an article of}} costume. Originally an item of lingerie, the corset has become a popular item of outerwear in the fetish, BDSM and goth subcultures. In the fetish and BDSM literature, there is often much emphasis on tightlacing, and many <b>corset</b> <b>makers</b> cater to the fetish market.|$|R
50|$|At No. 132, John Logie Baird {{made the}} first British {{television}} broadcast in 1929. Just off Long Acre is Langley Street, home of the Pineapple Dance Studios and London Film School, the oldest such school in the world. Just opposite, until 2000, was Paxman, {{one of the leading}} English manufacturers of French horns. It is said that the poet Richard Lovelace spent his final years in Long Acre, in great poverty. As a young man, Thomas Paine worked as a <b>corset</b> <b>maker</b> in Long Acre. In 1896, the Freemason's Arms was built; it still stands on Long Acre. Masonic symbols adorn the façade.|$|E
50|$|A {{study was}} {{published}} in Journal of Strength and Conditioning Research in 1989, showed that participants who wore waist belts when weight lifting had an increase in blood pressure. that when weight lifting, the support belts that the men wore increased their blood pressure. This inspired the popular <b>corset</b> <b>maker</b> and founder of Lucy's Corsetry, Lucy Williams, {{to see if this}} could potentially apply to corsets as well. In a video, she measures her blood pressure {{both in and out of}} the corset, seeing a 10% increase of blood pressure while wearing a corset. This is consistent with the 1989 study which saw a 6-15% increase in blood pressure of the wearers.|$|E

5000|$|Modern steel bones come in {{two basic}} varieties: [...] "flat" [...] steel boning (sometimes called just [...] "enamel" [...] or [...] "rigid" [...] boning) and [...] "spiral" [...] steel boning. Spiral boning is flattish but thicker than flat boning because of the tips {{required}} on the ends. Flat boning bends in only one direction, while spiral steel boning bends easily in two directions. Spiral steel boning may thus be used on curved channels or where a more gentle support is acceptable. Both varieties are rigid lengthwise. Modern <b>corset</b> <b>makers</b> differ greatly in the type and size of modern steel boning that they use. For those unable to procure steel boning, there are several options, depending on {{the style of the}} corset desired. Cable ties (found in 36, 48 and 52 inch lengths) from a hardware store {{can be used in a}} pinch.|$|R
25|$|The {{area where}} the {{district}} is located {{was developed in the}} late 1800s as a commercial area catering to the women's trade, and included businesses such as hairdressers, florists, <b>corset</b> <b>makers,</b> and fashionable clothiers. A number of these women's trade shops were owned by ethnic immigrants. During the 1910s, the area began transforming into a banking and financial center. In the adjoining Randolph Street Commercial Buildings Historic District, the building at 1244 Randolph St. is a rare survivor from the 1840s. The Breitmeyer-Tobin Building on Broadway Avenue, now called Harmonie Centre, opened to African-American tenants in 1936. In the 1950s, ethnic and immigrant-owned shops moved into the area, with some of them still in the districts to the present day. The east necklace of downtown links Grand Circus and the stadium area to Greektown along Broadway. The east neckace contains a sub-district sometimes called the Harmonie Park District in the Broadway Avenue Historic District which has taken on the legacy of Detroit's music from the 1930s through the 1950s and into the present.|$|R
50|$|The {{social aspects}} of {{clothing}} have revolved around traditions regarding certain items of clothing intrinsically suited different gender roles. In different periods, both women's and men's fashions have highlighted one area {{or another of}} the body for attention. In particular, the wearing of skirts and trousers has given rise to common phrases expressing implied restrictions in use and disapproval of offending behaviour. For example, ancient Greeks often considered the wearing of trousers by Persian men as a sign of an effeminate attitude. Women's clothing in Victorian fashion was used as a means of control and admiration. Reactions to the elaborate confections of French fashion led to various calls for reform on the grounds of both beauty (Artistic and Aesthetic dress) and health (dress reform; especially for undergarments and lingerie). Although trousers for women did not become fashionable until the later 20th century, women began wearing men's trousers (suitably altered) for outdoor work a hundred years earlier. In the 1960s, André Courrèges introduced long trousers for women as a fashion item, leading to the era of the pantsuit and designer jeans, and the gradual eroding of the prohibitions against girls and women wearing trousers in schools, the workplace, and fine restaurants. Corsets have long been used for fashion, and body modification, such as waistline reduction. There were, and are, many different styles and types of corsets, varying depending on the intended use, <b>corset</b> <b>maker's</b> style, and the fashions of the era.|$|R
40|$|At first glance, {{the city}} of Worcester is not unique. Like so many other New England cities, the traces of its {{industrial}} past are visible at every turn: from the early high-rise buildings in the downtown area, to the canals which run through the city, to the seemingly endless supply of bulky brick factories and the worker housing which surrounds them. Upon further investigation, however, Worcester, as with all places, is revealed {{to be filled with}} very specific, and indeed unique, histories and memories. Regrettably, in Worcester and so many of these other industrial cities, while many physical remnants remain, the spirit and energy they once provided have disappeared, much like the industries themselves. This disappearance has created a void in the cultural fabric of the area, leveling our experiences within cities and flattening the distinctions between them. Within Worcester, the neighborhood of Main south is indicative of this shift. Home to both universities and <b>corset</b> <b>makers,</b> for decades MainSouth held a singular position in Worcester's civic landscape - a place where higher education and the working classes mixed. After the loss of industry, however, the neighborhood disintegrated and any previous coherence disappeared. By utilizing forces already at work in the site, this thesis will attempt to promote a new understanding of Main south, one that re-establishes the neighborhood's identity as a place where different sectors of society can mix. Working with both existing building typologies and existing programmatic uses, a restructuring of portions of Main Street will be proposed as a new focal point for communal activity in the neighborhood. by Matthew Joseph Simitis.

Are there any flowers in bloom you like--any beautiful heaths--any streets full of <b>Corset</b> <b>Makers?</b> What sort of shoes have you to fit those pretty feet of yours?
