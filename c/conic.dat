In the propositions following Proposition 6 in Section 2 of the Principia, he applies it to specific curves, for example, <b>conic</b> sections. In the case of Proposition 44, it is applied to any orbit, under the action of an arbitrary force directed towards a fixed point, to produce a corresponding revolving orbit.|$|E

40|$|The book {{is devoted}} to the {{properties}} of <b>conics</b> (plane curves of second degree) that can be formulated and proved using only elementary geometry. Starting with the well-known optical properties of <b>conics,</b> the authors move to less trivial results, both classical and contemporary. In particular, the chapter on projective properties of <b>conics</b> contains a detailed analysis of the polar correspondence, pencils of <b>conics,</b> and the Poncelet theorem.

50|$|In a {{projective}} plane defined over an algebraically closed field any two <b>conics</b> meet in {{four points}} (counted with multiplicity) and so, determine the pencil of <b>conics</b> {{based on these}} four points. Furthermore, the four base points determine three line pairs (degenerate <b>conics</b> through the base points, each line of the pair containing exactly two base points) and so each pencil of <b>conics</b> will contain at most three degenerate <b>conics.</b>|$|R
5|$|The {{first step}} was a precise {{characterization}} of the error in the main mirror. Working backwards from images of point sources, astronomers determined that the <b>conic</b> constant of the mirror as built was , instead of the intended −1.00230. The same number was also derived by analyzing the null corrector used by Perkin-Elmer to figure the mirror, {{as well as by}} analyzing interferograms obtained during ground testing of the mirror.|$|E
5|$|Galileo {{showed a}} modern {{appreciation}} for the proper relationship between mathematics, theoretical physics, and experimental physics. He understood the parabola, {{both in terms of}} <b>conic</b> sections {{and in terms of the}} ordinate (y) varying as the square of the abscissa (x). Galilei further asserted that the parabola was the theoretically ideal trajectory of a uniformly accelerated projectile in the absence of air resistance or other disturbances. He conceded that there are limits to the validity of this theory, noting on theoretical grounds that a projectile trajectory of a size comparable to that of the Earth could not possibly be a parabola, but he nevertheless maintained that for distances up to the range of the artillery of his day, the deviation of a projectile's trajectory from a parabola would be only very slight.|$|E
5|$|Velázquez {{uses this}} light {{not only to}} add volume and {{definition}} to each form but also to define the focal points of the painting. As the light streams in from the right it brightly glints on the braid and golden hair of the female dwarf, who is nearest the light source. But because her face is turned from the light, and in shadow, its tonality {{does not make it}} a point of particular interest. Similarly, the light glances obliquely on the cheek of the lady-in-waiting near her, but not on her facial features. Much of her lightly coloured dress is dimmed by shadow. The Infanta, however, stands in full illumination, and with her face turned towards the light source, even though her gaze is not. Her face is framed by the pale gossamer of her hair, setting her apart from everything else in the picture. The light models the volumetric geometry of her form, defining the <b>conic</b> nature of a small torso bound rigidly into a corset and stiffened bodice, and the panniered skirt extending around her like an oval candy-box, casting its own deep shadow which, by its sharp contrast with the bright brocade, both emphasises and locates the small figure as the main point of attention.|$|E
40|$|<b>Conics</b> and Cartesian ovals {{are very}} {{important}} curves in various fields of science. Also aspheric curves based on <b>conics</b> are useful in optics. Superconic curves recently suggested by A. Greynolds are extensions of both <b>conics</b> and Cartesian ovals and have been applied to optics while they are not extensions of aspheric curves based on <b>conics.</b> In this work, we investigate another kind of superconic curves that are extensions of not only <b>conics</b> and Cartesian ovals but also aspheric curves based on <b>conics.</b> Moreover, the superconic curves are represented in explicit form while Greynolds' superconic curves are in implicit form.

5|$|With the {{publication}} of his Principia roughly eighty years later (1687), Isaac Newton provided a physical theory that accounted for all three of Kepler's laws, a theory based on Newton's laws of motion and his law of universal gravitation. In particular, Newton proposed that the gravitational force between any two bodies was a central force F(r) that varied as the inverse square of the distance r between them. Arguing from his laws of motion, Newton showed that the orbit of any particle acted upon by one such force is always a <b>conic</b> section, specifically an ellipse if it does not go to infinity. However, this conclusion holds only when two bodies are present (the two-body problem); the motion of three bodies or more acting under their mutual gravitation (the n-body problem) remained unsolved for centuries after Newton, although solutions to a few special cases were discovered. Newton proposed that the orbits of planets about the Sun are largely elliptical because the Sun's gravitation is dominant; to first approximation, the presence of the other planets can be ignored. By analogy, the elliptical orbit of the Moon about the Earth was dominated by the Earth's gravity; to first approximation, the Sun's gravity and those of other bodies of the Solar System can be neglected. However, Newton stated that the gradual apsidal precession of the planetary and lunar orbits was due to the effects of these neglected interactions; in particular, he stated that the precession of the Moon's orbit was due to the perturbing effects of gravitational interactions with the Sun.|$|E
25|$|A <b>conic</b> {{section is}} a curve {{that results from}} the {{intersection}} of a cone with a plane. There are three primary types of <b>conic</b> sections: ellipses (including circles), parabolas, and hyperbolas. The <b>conic</b> sections are reputed to have been discovered by Menaechmus (c. 380BCE– c. 320BCE) and since dealing with <b>conic</b> sections is equivalent to dealing with their respective equations, they played geometric roles equivalent to cubic equations and other higher order equations.|$|E

25|$|A general <b>conic</b> {{is defined}} by five points: given five points in general position, there is a unique <b>conic</b> passing through them. If three of these points lie on a line, then the <b>conic</b> is reducible, and {{may or may not}} be unique. If no four points are collinear, then five points define a unique <b>conic</b> (degenerate if three points are collinear, but the other two points {{determine}} the unique other line). If four points are collinear, however, then there is not a unique <b>conic</b> passing through them – one line passing through the four points, and the remaining line passes through the other point, but the angle is undefined, leaving 1 parameter free. If all five points are collinear, then the remaining line is free, which leaves 2 parameters free.|$|E

25|$|It is {{sufficient}} to prove the theorem when the <b>conic</b> is a circle, because any (non-degenerate) <b>conic</b> {{can be reduced to}} a circle by a projective transformation. This was realised by Pascal, whose first lemma states the theorem for a circle. His second lemma states that what is true in one plane remains true upon projection to another plane. Degenerate conics follow by continuity (the theorem is true for non-degenerate conics, and thus holds in the limit of degenerate <b>conic).</b>|$|E

25|$|In geometry, a {{degenerate}} <b>conic</b> is a <b>conic</b> (a second-degree plane curve, {{defined by}} a polynomial equation of degree two) that fails to be an irreducible curve.

Finally, Chasles established the correct answer in 1864, and Th. Berner again in (1865) (cf. [4], page 268). The problem has been reworked more recently by Fulton-McPherson [2] and Procesi-De Concini [1].
