25|$|A third type of basin exists along {{convergent}} plate boundaries – {{places where}} one tectonic plate moves under another into the asthenosphere. The subducting plate bends and forms a fore-arc basin {{in front of}} the overriding plate—an elongated, deep asymmetric basin. Fore-arc basins are filled with deep marine deposits and thick sequences of turbidites. Such infill is called flysch. When the convergent movement of the two plates results in continental collision, the basin becomes shallower and develops into a foreland basin. At the same time, tectonic uplift forms a mountain belt in the overriding plate, from which large amounts of material are eroded and transported to the basin. Such erosional material of a growing mountain chain is called molasse and has either a shallow marine or a <b>continental</b> <b>facies.</b>|$|E

50|$|The {{break-up}} of Pangea {{resulted in}} the break-up of the Paleozoic metamorphic basement rock. The basement rock formed half-grabens where eroded sediments from the break-up were then deposited. These sediments created the metasedimentary rocks of the La Quinta formation.

The timing of the Paleogene collision is clearly recorded in the stratigraphy of the Maracaibo basin. There is an abrupt change in sediment type of the late Cretaceous made evident by the thickly deposited, pelagic shale of the Colon formation. This represents the beginnings of the Caribbean arc collision with the South American plate. As the collision continued, this region shifted from the passive margin stage to the foreland basin stage.

40|$|International audienceSeven sections, {{covering}} the upper Albian to lowermost Turonian, have been correlated from full-marine to continental-dominated deposits across a passive margin, along a transect 425 km long, from the present-day Atlantic coast to the ``Pre-African Trough'' between the Anti-Atlas and the High-Atlas. The {{thickness of the}} Cenomanian succession changes from around 500 metres in the fully marine sections to 250 metres in mostly <b>continental</b> <b>facies</b> in the western High-Atlas, about 150 km updip, to a few tens of metres in the Bou Tazoult area. The strata thicken again eastwards into the Pre-African Trough {{where they can be}} traced without major facies changes to the Kem Kem embayment and to the Bechar area in Algeria. Over all this eastern area, <b>continental</b> <b>facies</b> are overlain by the fully-marine shallow-water deposits of the Cenomanian-Turonian boundary interval. A first major conclusion is that fluvial aggradation in high-frequency transgressive-regressive sequences is coeval with the seaward-shift of the shoreline, in accordance with the genetic sequence stratigraphic model of GALLOWAY (1989). Both the flatness of the depositional profile and the corresponding very low energy of the marine environment during the transgressions account for the blanket of red continental clays on top of marine facies in updip depositional sequences, which is then preserved under the marine transgressive surface of the next sequence. A second major conclusion is that the high-frequency transgressive-regressive (T-R) sequences do not look like classical parasequences bounded by transgression surfaces. They usually exhibit a surface created by a sea-level fall within the regressive half-cycle. This is interpreted in the following way: regressions did not operate through a regular seaward-shift of the shoreline, but through stepped sea-level falls. The very low slope of the depositional ramp is thought to have enhanced the sequence stratigraphic record of such stepped regressions. Short-term, high-frequency sequences are organized into medium-frequency T-R sequences (seven in the Cenomanian) which show an overall aggrading and slowly retrograding pattern along the whole transect. Comparisons with other basins show that medium-frequency sequences do not fit the third-order depositional sequences described elsewhere, casting doubts about a eustatic mechanism for their deposition...|$|E

These sediments were deposited within fault-bounded, intermontane basins and represent a variety of <b>continental</b> <b>facies</b> typical of arid or semi-arid areas. A major study of the diagenetic evolution of the Scottish Pcrmo-Triassic reveals that the basins were isochcmical and experienced similar patterns of diagenesis, largely controlled by the climatic aridity of the depositional environment. Depositional pore-waters in the Permo-Triassic sediments of Scotland were well oxygenated and alkaline in nature, allowing the rapid alteration of the unstable mineral assemblage. Ionic complexes r leased as a result ofthis alteration were precipitated as a suite of eodiagenetic minerals with oxygen isotope analysis on the authigenic K-feldspar phase confirming an origin from meteoric watcrs in an arid climate. These eodiagenetic modifications resulted in a major loss of primary porosity. Further burial resulted in minor pressure solution while further depth-related changes have been identified in the authigenic lay mineral suite.

The semi-quantitative analysis of proportions between marine and <b>continental</b> <b>facies</b> for each of 67 time slices produced a detailed curve depicting transgressive and regressive episodes. Five remarkable peaks on this curve are interpreted as the maximum flooding surfaces (MFSs). They are established at the Sinemurian/Pliensbachian boundary (MFS 1), in the upper Pliensbachian (MFS 2), the lower Aalenian (MFS 3), the upper Bajocian (MFS 4) and the lower Tithonian (MFS 5). All surfaces except for MFS 4 occur within typical MFS-marking layers. The Jurassic MFSs of the Greater Caucasus Basin do not match transgression peaks of the 1 st-order cycles of Western Europe and the MFSs of Arabia. Their correspondence to the global eustatic peaks also remains uncertain. The most unexpected event is found in MFS 3, which occurs {{at a time of}} prominent global sea-level fall. Errors in constraints and interpretations as well as influences of regional tectonic activity explain a specificity of the regional MFSs.
