50|$|The Consecration {{of churches}} (Siamidha or Qudash Madhbkha) {{consists}} largely of unctions. The altar is anointed all over, {{and there are}} four <b>consecration</b> <b>crosses</b> on the four interior walls of the sanctuary, and these and the lintel {{of the door and}} various other places are anointed. The oil is not that of the Holy Horn, but fresh olive oil consecrated by the bishop.|$|R
50|$|Originally {{the castle}} chapel was {{clearly on the}} ground floor of the palas next to the later gatekeeper's room. A small Gothic arch window has survived on the {{exterior}} wall. It is possible that the ground floor continued to be used even after the construction of the new chapel as a prayer room. On the remains of the rendering of the round-arched entrance of the small guard's room two <b>consecration</b> <b>crosses</b> are still visible.|$|R
50|$|The {{most common}} and ancient form of four curved arms of equal length within a circle could easily be {{constructed}} by a stonemason using a compass. This shape is also called a rounded cross. Its shape is not unlike the Bolnisi cross, cross pattée, iron cross and Canterbury cross. However the <b>consecration</b> <b>cross</b> exists in other traditional forms, such as the sun cross.|$|E
5000|$|The {{cross vault}} {{dates from the}} {{reconstruction}} in 1876. The pulpit is from 1863. The altarpiece from 1859 contains a plaster cast of Thorvaldsen's Christ. On the north wall of the tower room hangs a <b>consecration</b> <b>cross</b> from the Middle Ages. The granite font is probably from the Romanesque period. It displays a relief of [...] "Luxuria", a woman standing on her head, nurturing a winged dragon and a lion.|$|E
50|$|Consecration crosses are crosses on the {{interior}} walls and exterior architecture of a Christian church or cathedral showing where the bishop has anointed the church with chrism or holy water in order to consecrate it. There is often a place for a candle {{in front of each}} cross which is lit on the anniversary of the consecration. The crosses signify the sanctity of the church. The 13th century Trinity Chapel in Salisbury Cathedral contains a painted <b>consecration</b> <b>cross</b> dating from 30 September 1225.|$|E
5000|$|In 1870 local {{historian}} Samuel Palmer reported [...] "This old and venerable {{church is}} said to be the first Christian place of worship in the county of Middlesex in the eighth or ninth century." [...] Later attempts to prove an early date for the foundation of the church include the claim by J. Carter Rendell (vicar 1912-26) that a medieval altar slab marked with five <b>consecration</b> <b>crosses,</b> found during the 19th-century building works, could be dated to the 6th century.|$|R
2500|$|On the {{south-west}} and north-west buttresses of {{the tower}} are ancient and almost-illegible carvings about [...] across, and about [...] from the ground. They may be <b>consecration</b> <b>crosses,</b> following the tradition in which Anglican bishops have anointed each corner of the church with chrism {{as part of the}} consecration ritual, then commemorative crosses were placed at the same points. At first sight the carvings appear to be Tudor roses or the fleurs-de-lis used by English monarchs from the 14th to 18thcentury, but the raised [...] "petals" [...] may be the gaps between the curved arms of the deeply engraved cross.|$|R
50|$|During the 19th century reconstruction, {{an ancient}} stone altar was {{unearthed}} {{at the end}} of the South aisle, with five <b>consecration</b> <b>crosses</b> representing the five wounds of Christ. The slab was remounted under the East window of the south aisle, serving as an altar for the Lady chapel. Also uncovered during the reconstruction was a stone which had been used as a piscina, but was discovered to be the lid of a child's coffin of early date. The stone is now set in the wall of the south aisle. At the end of the north aisle is a black marble reproduction of The Last Supper.|$|R
50|$|The {{church was}} not {{actually}} consecrated until 1200, by Saint Hugh, Bishop of Lincoln. There is a 13th or 14th century <b>consecration</b> <b>cross</b> consisting of interlaced circles {{cut into the}} western column of the bell tower that is believed to commemorate this. Also in commemoration of the consecration, St Giles' Fair was established. The fair continues to this day, held on the Monday and Tuesday after the Sunday following 1 September, which is St Giles' Day. St Hugh also expanded the St Mary Magdalen's Church to the south in 1194.|$|E
5000|$|There {{has been}} a church on this site since the late 11th century. Between 1305 and 1314 the {{original}} church was either replaced or enhanced; the parts of that church that still stand are the south transept, the south door arch, the holy water stoop and the <b>consecration</b> <b>cross.</b> The tower dates from the late 14th century, and the nave from the late 14th/early 15th century. The north aisle and gallery were added in 1838, and the chancel arch modified at this time. The chancel itself was remodelled in 1878.|$|E
50|$|All {{that now}} remains are {{the tower and}} {{the wall of the}} south aisle, dating from the 15th century, and a {{mortuary}} chapel from the 19th century. The ruins of the tower and aisle wall are constructed in flint and plaster with stone quoins. The tower is supported by three-stage buttresses and it has a doorway with a string course above. In the tower is a two-light Perpendicular window. The bell openings date from the 18th century and they also have two lights. The summit of the tower is battlemented. On the lower stage of the tower is a mutilated <b>consecration</b> <b>cross</b> in knapped flint. The blocked arch to the former nave has octagonal piers. In the aisle wall are two two-light windows. The chapel is constructed in chalk with a tiled roof. It has lancet windows and its interior is vaulted.|$|E
50|$|Of note are {{the ruins}} of the old late Gothic chapel, which {{projects}} bastion-like into the neck ditch. There are still cleaning residues from the original <b>consecration</b> <b>crosses.</b> However, the chapel has been badly affected by the increasing vandalism of the ruins. In early 2005, part of the beautiful external cornice (Kaffgesims) was thrown into the ditch. Some structural damage resulted from a failed attempt by a youth group to renovate the top of the wall in the late 20th century. Around 1980, a human skeleton was unearthed in the chapel during an illegal excavation, suggesting that a tomb or crypt lay under the chapel.|$|R
50|$|The {{decorative}} paintings come rom {{two different}} periods: the Renaissance (1594) and the Rococo (1740). The Renaissance paintings {{are located in}} the choir and the arcades of the two side-aisles, while the Rococo paintings are located on the west arcade and the wooden ceiling. Several <b>consecration</b> <b>crosses</b> survive on the walls. Four oil paintings hang near the entrance to the Fürstenstuhl (previously they were in the south side-aisle), which show St.s Catharine, Dorothea, Barbara, and Margaret on one side and male, largely destroyed figures on the other side. These were probably part of a winged altar from Arnsberg Abbey. The eight-armed bronze chandelier was cast in 1600.|$|R
2500|$|Wade and Wade {{in their}} 1929 book [...] "Somerset" [...] {{described}} it as [...] "a small building with a Perp. W. tower, from the W. face of which project two curious and uncanny carved heads {{of a man and}} beast. The walls of the nave still bear the original 13th cent. <b>consecration</b> <b>crosses.</b> The chancel is modern, and contains a rich modern screen and a good E. window of Munich glass. Note (1) rude Norm. S. doorway filled with Perp. tracery; (2) Norm. font carved with a curious device by some later craftsman. Near the porch in the churchyard is (1) base of ancient cross; (2) tomb of first rector— Robert— bearing an incised cross".|$|R
5000|$|St John's is {{constructed}} in flint rubble, partly rendered, with stone dressings. The rebuilt east wall is in brick, and the roofs are tiled. [...] Its plan {{consists of a}} single rectangular cell 32 ft long by 16 ft long. [...] The north wall contains two original single-light windows about 15 in wide and 3 ft tall. At {{the east end of}} the north wall is part of another window that was cut in half when the east wall was rebuilt. The west wall contains one similar window, as does the south wall which also contains another window cut in half. [...] The east wall contains another similar window, a wider 19th-century copy of the original windows. [...] At each corner of the church is a buttress. Around the rest of the church, other than along the east end, is a moulded string course {{at the level of the}} window sills. In the south wall is a doorway with a pointed arch that was rebuilt in the 20th century. [...] Around the church are nine <b>consecration</b> <b>cross</b> stones. Each of these consists of a circle in which there are five holes which formerly held metal crosses.|$|E
50|$|Remains of wall {{paintings}} were discovered on the North wall in 1963; these {{are believed to}} be 14th and 15th-century in date (some may be as early as the 13th-century). There is evidence that this wall was decorated along its whole length. Directly opposite the entrance is the best preserved of the murals which shows the lower half of St Christopher including his feet, the bottom of his staff, some cliffs and fish darting in a stream. On the right (East) side the banks of the stream can be seen, and on the left is the faint image of the hermit standing in his cell with his lantern to guide the Saint. This painting is late 15th-century in date and the muted colours include red, yellow, grey and black, with a hint of vermilion. Other features include {{what appears to be a}} mermaid and part of a pillar, and these may belong to an earlier 14th-century mural. The upper half of the Saint carrying the infant Christ was accidentally destroyed during the reconstruction of the nave roof in 1881. To its right is a fragment showing a wheel design with figures of mysterious creatures, while to the East of the eastern nave window a hooded human figure can be seen on the window edge close to the pulpit. This latter section may have been part of a Doom Painting, portraying the Last Judgement. A <b>consecration</b> <b>cross</b> of unusual design is visible on the South East face of the stair turret.|$|E
5000|$|The {{church has}} a plain interior. yet {{are a few}} {{extraordinary}} to view. Such is {{the south side of}} the choir the piscina. It is in the wall fitted sink for washing of the stuff that the priest used at the Eucharist. The piscina is at a pointed arch alcove. Above the middle A stone list (the only one in Friesland), where the ampoules could be put on. If the priest rinse the dishes, he let God's water over God's field flowing. In the north wall is also considerable alcove, will be used as storage.

He is recognized by the <b>consecration</b> <b>crosses</b> at the corners and in the middle. The banks are new.|$|R
5000|$|The {{tower is}} a major local {{landmark}} and was built about 1480. It stands 30m (100ft) high with an octagonal stair turret probably housing a beacon at the top to act {{as one of a}} chain between coast and capital. The tower houses a peel of eight bells (read more on the page about the bell ringers) 14th century nave, is very plain and almost all the roof timbers are original. Most of the window stonework was replaced in the 19th century. The stained glass of the south-east window is by Hardman [...]The most interesting feature in the nave is the celure which is unique and once formed a canopy for a rood screen. It was painted in the 1460s on the orders of Sir Thomas St Leger, who married Edward IV’s sister, Anne, and depicted the King’s badge of the Sun in Splendour. This was changed rapidly after the demise of the House of York, following the Wars of the Roses, with the rose of Lancaster.The mediaeval wall paintings and <b>consecration</b> <b>crosses</b> were uncovered in the 1920s following a chance discovery by workmen of a cross {{beneath the surface of the}} south wall. The <b>consecration</b> <b>crosses</b> date from the reconstruction of the nave in the 14th century. In the chancel are the earliest remaining parts of the building in the form of 13th century wall arcading.There are three sedilia and nearby is a 13th-century piscina. By comparison you will also see the newest addition to the chancel, the Millennium Cross, made out of branches of our 1000-year-old yew tree, which can still be seen in the churchyard.Between the chancel and chapel is the arcade, with the two arches nearest the nave dating from the 13th century. The parclose screen inserted into the arcade is a very fine example of 15th century woodwork.. The chapel also houses a particularly fine 14th century oak chest.|$|R
5000|$|At {{the time}} of the Domesday Survey in 1086 it is thought that the Chapel of St.Mary, beside the Whitewater, was one of the two churches within the Manor of Odiham {{mentioned}} in the survey. The church is of Norman origin and was built in the 12th century. Restored in 1870, it still boasts many old features, the most important of which is the early 16th century rood-screen, made of carved oak which before the restoration was used as a men’s gallery with rood loft and circular stairs.  The narrow 13th Century Early English chancel-arch is also a prominent feature and one will also find, on the stonework to the left outside the church door, visible remains of several <b>consecration</b> <b>crosses</b> dating back to the period of the Crusades. Church Cottage, beside the lych-gate on The Street, {{is believed to have been}} originally the priest's lodgings.|$|R
50|$|Before the English Reformation the Church of England {{was part}} of the Roman Catholic Church, and Sheffield's medieval parish church of St. Peter (now the Cathedral Church of Saint Peter and Saint Paul) was the {{principal}} Catholic church in the district. In 1534, during the reign of Henry VIII, the Church of England split from Rome, and Catholic worship was outlawed. Until the 18th century, Catholics faced fines, loss of property and social exclusion, and Catholic Priests were hunted down, imprisoned and martyred. The main landowners in Sheffield were the Dukes of Norfolk, and the Shrewsbury Chapel in the now Anglican parish church remained Catholic until 1933. During the reordering of St Mary's in 1970, at the invitation of the Anglican Cathedral, Mass was celebrated on the altar of the Shrewsbury Chapel once again. The Altar still retains its Catholic <b>consecration</b> <b>crosses,</b> and relics, making this possible. Mass was celebrated in a few houses of gentry in Sheffield, including in a house on Fargate that belonged to the Duke of Norfolk, which had a hidden chapel in its roof.|$|R
2500|$|Greatham Church is a tiny, primitive, unrestored {{building}} {{dating from}} the [...] "Saxo-Norman overlap" [...] period when Anglo-Saxon architecture was giving way to the Norman style. [...] The writer Arthur Mee was once told not to mistake the church for a haystack: set {{in the middle of}} fields and on its own apart from the manor house, it has an extremely basic and modest feel—amplified by its lack of electricity and piped water. [...] The walls, of unequal length and thickness, are principally of ironstone with some chalk, flint, Roman-era masonry and rubble, local (Pulborough) sandstone and Horsham Stone. [...] Ian Nairn described them as having [...] "a wonderful texture". [...] At one corner, the Pulborough sandstone quoins have a set of roughly carved crosses. [...] These are believed to be <b>consecration</b> <b>crosses,</b> which were blessed when the church was completed and consecrated. [...] The building has a single room with no division between the nave and chancel. [...] There is also a slate-hung bell-turret with a small spire. [...] The windows, inserted in the 13th century, are Early English-style lancets. [...] The roof is an old, but not original, king post structure.|$|R
5000|$|The chapel is {{constructed}} in stone rubble with a stone slate roof. [...] It is in two cells, one forming the nave {{and the other}} the chancel, {{each of which is}} of similar width; the chapel is otherwise featureless. [...] A rendered concrete block wall dating from the 1980s stands about 1 m {{to the west of the}} chancel arch. In the north wall of the chancel are two doors, one added in the 20th century, and the other being an original priest's door with a semicircular head. In the north wall are two windows, one being small with a semicircular head, and the other larger with a square head, probably dating from the 17th century. The east wall contains a window with a four-centred head, probably from the early 16th century. In the north wall of the nave is a narrow square-headed window, and in the south wall is a window with a pointed head and a doorway with a semicircular head. The west wall contains two single-light windows at different heights. The fittings still present in the interior are an altar slab with five <b>consecration</b> <b>crosses,</b> and the base of a 19th-century font.|$|R
50|$|The Parisian palatine chapel, {{built to}} house a reliquary, was itself like a {{precious}} reliquary {{turned inside out}} (with the richest decoration on the inside).Although the interior {{is dominated by the}} stained glass (see below), every inch of the remaining wall surface and the vault was also richly coloured and decorated. Analysis of remaining paint fragments reveal that the original colours were much brighter than those favoured by the 19th-century restorers and would have been closer to the colours of the stained glass. The quatrefoils of the dado arcade were painted with scenes of saints and martyrs and inset with painted and gilded glass, emulating Limoges enamels, while rich textiles hangings added to the richness of the interior.Above the dado level, mounted on the clustered shafts that separate the great windows, are 12 larger-than-life-sized sculpted stone figures representing the 12 Apostles (six of these are replicas—the damaged originals are now in the Musée du Moyen Age). Each carries a disk marked with the <b>consecration</b> <b>crosses</b> that were traditionally marked on the pillars of a church at its consecration.Niches on the north and south sides of the chapel are the private oratories of the king and of his mother, Blanche of Castile.|$|R

The tower is in two stages, with diagonal buttresses. Towards {{the top of the}} southeast tower are the carved coat of arms of Fountains Abbey. There are more coats of arms on the southwest buttress. The tower contains a three-light west window, a trefoil-headed niche on the south side, clock faces on the east and west sides, and three-light bell openings on each side. At the summit of the tower is an embattled parapet. The porch contains two <b>consecration</b> <b>crosses.</b> Along the side of the south aisle, and in its west wall, are three-light windows. The south chapel is known as the Lambert Chapel. This has a doorway on the west side and a three-light window on the east side.
