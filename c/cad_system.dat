25|$|If the {{detected}} structures {{have reached}} a certain threshold level, they are highlighted in the image for the radiologist. Depending on the <b>CAD</b> <b>system</b> these markings can be permanently or temporary saved. The latter's advantage is that only the markings which are approved by the radiologist are saved. False hits should not be saved, because an examination {{at a later date}} becomes more difficult then.|$|E
25|$|A correct hit is {{termed a}} True Positive (TP), while the {{incorrect}} marking of healthy sections constitutes a False Positive (FP). The less FPs indicated, {{the higher the}} specificity is. A low specificity reduces {{the acceptance of the}} <b>CAD</b> <b>system</b> because the user has to identify all of these wrong hits. The FP-rate in lung overview examinations (CAD Chest) could be reduced to 2 per examination. In other segments (e.g. CT lung examinations) the FP-rate could be 25 or more. In CAST systems the FP rate must be extremely low (less than 1 per examination) to allow a meaningful study triage.|$|E
2500|$|The routine {{application}} of <b>CAD</b> Chest <b>Systems</b> {{may help to}} detect small changes without initial suspicion. A number of researchers developed <b>CAD</b> <b>systems</b> for detection of lung nodules (round lesions less than 30mm) in chest radiography [...] and CT, and <b>CAD</b> <b>systems</b> for diagnosis (e.g., distinction between malignant and benign) of lung nodules in CT. Philips was the first vendor to present a CAD for early detection of round lung lesions on x-ray images. Virtual dual-energy imaging [...] improved the performance of <b>CAD</b> <b>systems</b> in chest radiography. Observer performance studies demonstrated that <b>CAD</b> <b>systems</b> improved the diagnosticic performance of radiologists in detectoin [...] and diagnosis [...] of lung nodules in CT.|$|R
40|$|Because the {{different}} <b>CAD</b> <b>systems</b> use different concepts, attributes and relations to store data model, {{it is difficult}} to implement semantic interoperability among heterogeneous <b>CAD</b> <b>systems.</b> In this study, the Feature Command Ontology Model (FCOM) which is established, includes a number of Neutral Semantic Feature Commands (NSFCs) corresponding to the basic modeling operations of <b>CAD</b> <b>systems.</b> The FCOM which has explicit ontological semantics, provides the uniform representation of heterogeneous information and helps to shield the heterogeneity of data sources. Meanwhile, it is capable of dealing with modification and deletion operations besides common creation operations. Based on the FCOM, a synchronized collaborative design platform upon heterogeneous <b>CAD</b> <b>systems</b> is built; the real-time data exchange among heterogeneous <b>CAD</b> <b>systems</b> is achieved in a semantic way...|$|R

25|$|Gerber {{is used in}} PCB {{fabrication}} data. PCBs {{are designed}} on a specialized electronic design automation (EDA) or a computer-aided design (<b>CAD)</b> <b>system.</b> The CAD systems output PCB fabrication data to allow fabrication of the board. This data typically contains a Gerber file for each image layer (copper layers, solder mask, legend or silk...). Gerber is also the standard image input format for all bare board fabrication equipment needing image data, such as photoplotters, legend printers, direct imagers or automated optical inspection (AOI) machines and for viewing reference images in different departments. For assembly the fabrication data contains the solder paste layers and the central locations of components to create the stencil and place and bond the components.|$|E
25|$|CAD {{is used in}} {{screening}} mammography (X-ray {{examination of}} the female breast). Screening mammography {{is used for the}} early detection of breast cancer. CAD systems are often utilized to help classify a tumor as malignant or benign. CAD is especially established in US and the Netherlands and is used in addition to human evaluation, usually by a radiologist. The first <b>CAD</b> <b>system</b> for mammography was developed in a research project at the University of Chicago. Today it is commercially offered by iCAD and Hologic. There are currently some non-commercial projects being developed, such as Ashita Project, a gradient-based screening software by Alan Hshieh, as well. However, while achieving high sensitivities, CAD systems tend to have very low specificity and the benefits of using CAD remain uncertain. Some studies suggest a positive impact on mammography screening programs, but others show no improvement. A 2008 systematic review on computer-aided detection in screening mammography concluded that CAD does not {{have a significant effect on}} cancer detection rate, but does undesirably increase recall rate (i.e. the rate of false positives). However, it noted considerable heterogeneity in the impact on recall rate across studies.|$|E
2500|$|The X-ray image, {{called a}} radiograph, {{is sent to}} a {{physician}} who specializes in interpreting these images, called a radiologist. [...] The image may be on plain photographic film or digital mammography on a computer screen; despite the much higher cost of the digital systems, the two methods are generally considered equally effective. [...] The equipment may use a computer-aided diagnosis (<b>CAD)</b> <b>system.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>CAD</b> <b>systems</b> seek to {{highlight}} suspicious structures. Today's <b>CAD</b> <b>systems</b> cannot detect 100% of pathological changes. The hit rate (sensitivity) can {{be up to}} 90% depending on system and application.|$|R

2500|$|While in Hamburg, Atta held several jobs, which {{included}} a part-time position at Plankontor and an urban planning firm from 1992 until mid-1997, when he was laid off. The firm's business had declined, and when it bought a <b>CAD</b> <b>system,</b> [...] "his draughtsmanship was not needed." [...] Atta also worked at a cleaning firm, and he bought and sold cars to earn extra money. After studying in Hamburg, Atta had wanted to return to Cairo to work, but there were few job prospects, as his family {{did not have the}} [...] "right connections."

40|$|Abstract-CAD data {{exchange}} {{is vital to}} industrial engineering innovation.

Because the current ISO 10303 (STEP) {{does not provide a}} mechanism to exchange parametric information among <b>CAD</b> <b>systems,</b> we are trying to solve this problem based on the Macro-Parametrics Approach (MPA). The entire implementation is based on TransCAD, which bridges different <b>CAD</b> <b>systems.</b> Translators of famous <b>CAD</b> <b>systems</b> are also implemented based on TransCAD.

40|$|Abstract: In this paper, {{we develop}} a lung area {{extraction}} technique from X-ray computed tomography (CT) images for computer-aided diagnosis (<b>CAD)</b> <b>systems.</b> In lung cancer cases, pulmonary nodules are typical pathological changes and thus {{they are the}} target to be detected by <b>CAD</b> <b>systems.</b> The isolated nodules can be detected more easily by <b>CAD</b> <b>systems</b> developed previously, while previous <b>CAD</b> <b>systems</b> are often hard to detect non-isolated nodules. The extraction technique can then be used for transforming the non-isolated pulmonary nodules connected to {{the walls of the}} chest into isolated ones. The technique proposed here is based on an active contour model, but such model is often trapped into a local optimum solution. To avoid the local optimum solutions, an essential core of the proposed technique is to select an appropriate initial contour by using an anatomical feature of the lung shape in X-ray CT slices. Some experimental results demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed technique for assisting the <b>CAD</b> <b>systems</b> to detect non-isolated nodules more accurately...|$|R

Finally, a Web service for exchange of procedural CAD models between SolidWorks and Autodesk Mechanical Desktop is realized. ...|$|R
