5|$|On 12 January, one of {{the most}} unusual aerial battles of the Vietnam War took place. Two Soviet-built An-2 Colt biplanes of the North Vietnamese Air Force {{attacked}} Lima Site 85 atop a craggy peak known as Phou Pha Thi. An Air America Bell 205 helicopter, which had taken off to avoid air-dropped 120mm mortar rounds, then began chasing {{one of the}} Colts which had already been struck by ground fire. The aircraft crashed while making evasive maneuvers.

5|$|A {{few years}} later, West {{was the home}} plate umpire during the 1988 playoff game in which pitcher Jay Howell was ejected for having pine tar on his glove. In 1990, he threw pitcher Dennis Cook to the ground while {{attempting}} {{to break up a}} fight. West resigned during the 1999 Major League Umpires Association mass resignation, but was rehired in 2002. Since then, he has umpired throughout MLB. In a 2004 playoff game between the Boston Red Sox and New York Yankees, West's crew made a controversial decision that necessitated police presence to calm the crowd. He served as <b>crew</b> <b>chief</b> for the 2005 World Series, and officiated in the 2009 World Baseball Classic.|$|E
5|$|During {{a game in}} 2013 {{between the}} Houston Astros and Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim, Culbreth, acting as the <b>crew</b> <b>chief</b> for the game, made an {{incorrect}} call in the 7th inning, for which he later received a two-game suspension and a fine. Houston manager Bo Porter made a pitching change, and Los Angeles manager Mike Scioscia called for a pinch-hitter. Porter attempted to make a second pitching change and Scioscia immediately contested it. After discussing the call with his umpiring crew, Culbreth allowed the pitching change, violating the MLB rule 3.05(b). He did not serve his suspension immediately, and he continued working regular games in the weeks following the incident.|$|E

5|$|Jolly Green 67 flew east at first, {{further into}} {{territory}} {{held by the}} North Vietnamese, before it turned southeast for a few kilometers, when a fire {{broke out in the}} left engine. Pieces of the tail rotor struck the main rotor, and the aircraft rolled and crashed on its left side, burning ferociously. No rescue beepers were heard. The entire crew was listed as MIA and presumed killed: Capt. Peter Hayden Chapman II (pilot), Capt. John Henry Call III (co-pilot), TSgt. William Roy Pearson, TSgt. Allen J. Avery (para-rescuemen), TSgt. Roy D. Prater (<b>Crew</b> <b>Chief),</b> and Sgt. James Harold Alley (combat photographer).

5|$|West {{has been}} {{mentioned}} in several polls of MLB players. In 2006, the spring after he was <b>crew</b> <b>chief</b> in the World Series, a Sports Illustrated survey asked 470 MLB players to identify {{the best and worst}} umpires. West was identified as the best MLB umpire by 2 percent of those players, ranking him ninth on that list. With respect to the worst umpire, 6 percent of players in the survey selected West. Only three umpires were named more frequently as worst umpire in the survey. A 2007 review of umpire strike zones by The Hardball Times determined that West was the most consistent umpire in the major leagues.|$|E
5|$|At the Los Angeles International Speedway, McQueen's mind is {{not fully}} set on the race, and he soon falls into last place. He is {{surprised}} to discover that Doc Hudson, who is decked out in his old racing colors, has taken over as his <b>crew</b> <b>chief,</b> along with several other friends from Radiator Springs to help in the pit. Inspired and recalling tricks he learned from Doc and his friends, McQueen quickly emerges to lead the race into the final laps. But at the last minute, Hicks, refusing to come behind Weathers again, side swipes Weathers, and sends him into a dangerous spin, causing him to crash. Seeing this and recalling Doc's fate, McQueen stops just short of the finish line, allowing Hicks to win, and drives back to push Weathers over the finish line. The crowd and media condemn Hicks' victory, but are nonetheless impressed with McQueen's sportsmanship. Though offered the Dinoco sponsorship deal, McQueen declines, insisting on staying with Rusteze as an appreciation of their past support. Later, back at Radiator Springs, McQueen returns and announces that he will be setting up his headquarters there, helping to put Radiator Springs back on the map.|$|E
5000|$|The {{leadership}} roles themselves change each year {{as they are}} given, or [...] "passed down", to younger students.

5|$|At the season-opening Daytona 500, Robinson {{qualified}} in 36th place {{making her}} the second woman {{to start the}} race; she finished 24th despite spinning into the track's infield, and avoided a pit road collision with Bobby Labonte. After the event, Sharp left BAM Racing, and car chief Teddy Brown became Robinson's new <b>crew</b> <b>chief.</b> She struggled during her rookie season, {{and was unable to}} attend most races due to sponsorship issues along with her team hiring new drivers which limited her on track experience. Her rival competitors said it was due to Robinson driving an noncompetitive car rather than her driving skill. Robinson made no further appearances for BAM Racing after the second race at Daytona International Speedway, and was later released by the team. She ended the season 52nd in the Drivers' Championship, and was fourth in the Rookie of the Year standings. Outside racing, Robinson spoke for Women in Sports, and attended meetings of several associations and business groups while taking the time to be with her children. She separated from Jeff Clark in early 2002, but both remained on good terms.|$|E
5|$|In {{the same}} year he {{returned}} to the field, West worked in the ALDS. He also umpired in the 2003 and 2004 ALCS. In game six of the latter series, West's crew ruled Yankees batter Alex Rodriguez out for interference after Rodriguez appeared to swat the ball out of the glove of opposing pitcher Bronson Arroyo on his way to first base. Fans threw debris on the field, Red Sox manager Terry Francona pulled his team off the field, and NYPD officers in riot gear took to the field to calm the crowd. West said fans actually applauded the umpires for the correct call when they came onto the field the following day. West’s first All-Star Game and World Series appearances after his rehire came in 2005; that year he umpired in his second ALDS and his third World Series, serving as World Series <b>crew</b> <b>chief.</b>|$|E
5|$|She {{came close}} to winning her first ARCA race at {{the final round of}} the season, the Georgia Boot 400 at Atlanta Motor Speedway, having led a race-high 66 laps, but was {{overtaken}} by Bob Strait with three laps of the event remaining. Robinson finished sixth in the Drivers' Championship standings, making her the first woman to finish within the top-six final standings in an American national oval track motor sports series. In 2001, Robinson returned to NASCAR to drive the No. 99 Michael Waltrip Racing car for three races in the Busch Series with the objective of obtaining a season-long drive in 2002. The seat materialized when she met Tim Butler and Ken Butler of Aaron's at Atlanta Motor Speedway in the fall of 2000. She later {{received a phone call from}} team owner/driver Michael Waltrip who arranged a three-race agreement, but did not reply being under contact with Kranefuss. Bobby Kennedy acted as Robinson's <b>crew</b> <b>chief.</b> In her three races, she achieved one top-20 finish but did not finish the first two events having been involved in crashes. She continued a strong run in ARCA Series with two top-ten finishes in the season's first two races.|$|E

5|$|The second aircraft's {{commander}} was Major General Curtis LeMay, Chief of Staff of the Strategic Air Forces. First Lieutenant J. Ivan Potts {{served as}} one of the pilots, as did Lieutenant Colonel William C. Kingsbury—the two had been a flight team in the 25th Bombardment Squadron (Very Heavy) of the 58th Bombardment Wing, Very Heavy, based on Tinian, and were good friends. Colonel William H. Blanchard, Chief of Staff of the Twentieth Air Force, joined the crew at Guam after personally inspecting Sapporo Air Base a few days earlier. Others on the crew from the 25th BS included Sergeant Jerome A. School, Sergeant Richard P. Fischer and Sergeant B. T. Freeman, the latter two removed at Guam when LeMay and Blanchard joined. Two men were from the 44th Bomber Squadron: First Lieutenant John C. Eiland and Staff Sergeant Frank Klas Jr. The remainder of the crew was Flight Engineer Captain William W. Townes (45th Bomber Squadron), First Lieutenant Stephen T. Jones (24th Bomber Squadron), Major John F. Wedding (468th Bomb Group) and Captain Theodore R. Finder (40th Bomb Group Headquarters). The <b>crew</b> <b>chief</b> was Master Sergeant Henry J. Rutowski.|$|E
5|$|When {{it became}} {{apparent}} that Yamaha could not develop a dirt track motorcycle capable of competing with the dominant Harley-Davidson dirt track team, the American Yamaha importer, Yamaha USA, offered to send Roberts to Europe in 1978 to compete in the World Championship Grand Prix road racing series, along with Kel Carruthers to act as his mentor and <b>crew</b> <b>chief.</b> Roberts also secured the financial backing of the Goodyear tire company. The team planned to compete in the 250cc world championship as well as the Formula 750 series in order to have more practice time to learn the tracks, but their main focus would be on the 500cc class, considered the premier class at the time. His main competition in the 500cc world championship would come from Suzuki rider Barry Sheene, winner of the two previous titles. Roberts said that he was initially indifferent about competing in Europe, but when he read that Sheene had labeled him as"no threat", he made up his mind to compete. Few observers gave Roberts any chance of winning the championship, citing the reasoning that it would take him at least one season to learn the European circuits.|$|E
5|$|She {{moved to}} BAM Racing in October 2001 and drove her first (and only) {{race in the}} NASCAR Winston West Series (now called K Pro Series West) at Las Vegas Motor Speedway that same month. Robinson {{was sent to a}} driving school to {{familiarize}} herself with the track, and Kranefuss granted her permission to race. She retired due to a car failure while running in third position. Team owner Tony Morgenthau first noticed Robinson at an ARCA race at Pocono Raceway the previous year when she made contact with his driver Matty Mullins who was sent into the wall. He had been impressed with her pace at Las Vegas. He spoke to Robinson after the race and asked her why she had not competed in more events. He later offered her a multi-year contract which she signed in December 2001. Her <b>crew</b> <b>chief</b> was former Busch Series driver Eddie Sharp. She attempted to qualify for 24-races during the 2002 season since her team had no owner points because they were a new operation. Robinson went to Kranefuss to terminate her contract with his team. She ran for the Rookie of the Year award, but was seen by the Chicago Tribune as having little chance of securing the honor.|$|E
