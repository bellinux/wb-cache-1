5000|$|Crystal {{inclusions}} in diamonds {{occurs in}} the form of lines known as graining. Graining {{should not be confused with}} a rough diamonds natural grain lines [...] Graining forms due to the improper crystallization of the diamond or when a diamond is twinned. Twinned diamonds are two diamonds that have grown together and causes <b>cross-grains</b> within the diamond during its growth / crystallization process. Twinning causes natural lines, planes or <b>cross-grains</b> in a diamond. Graining can't be removed during the polishing process of a diamond as it is a natural plane within the diamond. Cross-graining also makes the polishing process extremely difficult for diamond cutters as a diamond only cuts against its natural grain lines and never with the grain. One will always find graining in rough diamonds known as [...] "Macle's". Macles are easily identified by its triangular shape. The graining line on the Macle is a natural cleaving plane where the diamond can easily be split in half. Diamonds with graining will never be graded as Flawless as its maximum grade would only fetch Internally Flawless (IF). Although graining seems like a severe flaw it is not visible with the naked eye and does not impact the overall brilliance or quality of a diamond.|$|E

40|$|AbstractIn this review, we briefly {{introduce}} our in situ atomic-scale mechanical experimental technique (ASMET) for transmission {{electron microscopy}} (TEM), which can observe the atomic-scale deformation dynamics of materials. This in situ mechanical testing technique allows the deformation of TEM samples through a simultaneous double-tilt function, making atomic-scale mechanical microscopy feasible. This methodology is generally applicable to thin films, nanowires (NWs), tubes and regular TEM samples to allow investigation {{of the dynamics of}} mechanically stressed samples at the atomic scale. We show several examples of this technique applied to Pt and Cu single/polycrystalline specimens. The in situ atomic-scale observation revealed that when the feature size of these materials approaches the nano-scale, they often exhibit “unusual” deformation behaviours compared to their bulk counterparts. For example, in Cu single-crystalline NWs, the elastic–plastic transition is size-dependent. An ultra-large elastic strain of 7. 2 %, which approaches the theoretical elasticity limit, can be achieved as the diameter of the NWs decreases to ∼ 6 nm. The crossover plasticity transition from full dislocations to partial dislocations and twins was also discovered as the diameter of the single-crystalline Cu NWs decreased. For Pt nanocrystals (NC), the long-standing uncertainties of atomic-scale plastic deformation mechanisms in NC materials (grain size G less than 15 nm) were clarified. For larger grains with G<∼ 10 nm, we frequently observed movements and interactions of <b>cross-grain</b> full dislocations. For G between 6 and 10 nm, stacking faults resulting from partial dislocations become more frequent. For G<∼ 6 nm, the plasticity mechanism transforms from a mode of <b>cross-grain</b> dislocation to a collective grain rotation mechanism. This grain rotation process is mediated by grain boundary (GB) dislocations with the assistance of GB diffusion and shuffling. These in situ atomic-scale images provide a direct demonstration that grain rotation, through the evolution of the misorientation angle between neighbouring grains, can be quantitatively assessed by the dislocation content within the grain boundaries. In combination with the revolutionary Cs-corrected sub-angstrom imaging technologies developed by Urban et al., the opportunities for experimental mechanics at the atomic scale are emerging...|$|R
40|$|The Gravity Lineations Intraplate Melting Petrologic and Seismic Expedition (GLIMPSE) Experiment {{investigated}} {{the formation of}} a series of non–hot spot, intraplate volcanic ridges in the South Pacific and their relationship to <b>cross-grain</b> gravity lineaments detected by satellite altimetry. Using shipboard gravity measurements and a simple model of surface loading of a thin elastic plate, we estimate effective elastic thicknesses ranging from ? 2 km beneath the Sojourn Ridge to a maximum of 10 km beneath the Southern Cross Seamount. These elastic thicknesses are lower than predicted for the 3 – 9 Ma seafloor on which the volcanoes lie, perhaps due to reheating and thinning of the plate during emplacement. Anomalously low apparent densities estimated for the Matua and Southern Cross seamounts of 2050 and 2250 kg m? 3, respectively, probably are artifacts caused by the assumption of only surface loading, ignoring the presence of subsurface loading in the form of underplated crust and/or low-density mantle. Using satellite free-air gravity and shipboard bathymetry, we calculate the age-detrended, residual mantle Bouguer anomaly (rMBA). The rMBA corrects the free-air anomaly for the direct effects of topography, including the thickening of the crust beneath the seamounts and volcanic ridges due to surface loading of the volcanic edifices. There are broad, negative rMBA anomalies along the Sojourn and Brown ridges and the Hotu Matua seamount chain that extend nearly to the East Pacific Rise. These negative rMBA anomalies connect to negative free-air anomalies {{in the western part of}} the study area that have been recognized previously as the beginnings of the <b>cross-grain</b> gravity lineaments. Subtracting the topographic effects of surface loading by the ridges and seamounts from the observed topography reveals that the ridges are built on broad bands of anomalously elevated seafloor. This swell topography and the negative rMBA anomalies contradict the predictions of lithospheric cracking models for the origin of gravity lineaments and associated volcanic ridges, favoring models with a dynamic mantle component such as small-scale convection or channelized asthenospheric return flow. <br/...|$|R
40|$|Grain {{rotation}} is {{a well-known}} phenomenon during high (homologous) temperature deformation and recrystallization of polycrystalline materials. In recent years, grain rotation has also been proposed as a plasticity mechanism at low temperatures (for example, room temperature for metals), especially for nanocrystalline grains with diameter d less than B 15 nm. Here, in tensile-loaded Pt thin films under a high-resolution transmission electron microscope, we show that the plasticity mechanism transitions from <b>cross-grain</b> dislocation glide in larger grains (d 46 nm) to a mode of coordinated rotation of multiple grains for grains with do 6 nm. The mechanism underlying the grain rotation is dislocation climb at the grain boundary, rather than grain boundary sliding or diffusional creep.

Water {{intrusion}} and subsequent decay around connections can significantly impact shear wall behavior, but these problems are seldom studied. In this study, effects of water intrusion and fungal attack on shear wall capacity were examined using small-scale (610 - x 610 -mm) shear walls that were monitored with time using destructive monotonic tests. Results were compared with tests of dry and water control samples. Although fungal colonization was not successful under the conditions tested, wetting (with or without fungal inoculation) produced interesting effects on shear wall capacity. Wetting alone initially increased shear wall capacity, possibly because of fastener corrosion. Observations and digital image correlation data suggest that tensile forces in the uplift corner of the shear walls governed failure modes, which were primarily nail withdrawal, nail pull-through, flake debonding, and <b>cross-grain</b> tension. Wetting affected rigidity of oriented strandboard and led to more frequent nail pull-through. Although failure loads did not differ between the groups, failure modes and displacement at maximum load suggested decreased performance of wetted shear walls.

There are few studies about sanding in the literature and finding out the relationship between the input parameters (i. e., species of wood, grit size, abrasive) on the output parameters (i. e., roughness, force, pressure) will help to improve this process.
