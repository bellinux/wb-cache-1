5000|$|It was {{realized}} that a large water <b>Čerenkov</b> <b>detector</b> could be an ideal neutrino detector, for several reasons. First, the enormous volume possible in a water <b>Čerenkov</b> <b>detector</b> can overcome {{the problem of the}} very small cross section of the 5-15 MeV solar neutrinos. Second, water Čerenkov detectors offer real time event detection. This meant that Individual neutrino-electron interaction candidate events could be studied on an event-by-event basis, starkly different from the month-to-month observation required in radiochemical experiments. Third, in the neutrino-electron scattering interaction the electron recoils in roughly the direction that the neutrino was travelling (similar to the motion of billiard balls), so the electrons [...] "point back" [...] to the sun. Fourth, neutrino-electron scattering is an elastic process, so the energy distribution of the neutrinos can be studied, further testing the solar model. Fifth, the characteristic [...] "ring" [...] produced by Čerenkov radiation allows discrimination of the signal against backgrounds. Finally, since a water Čerenkov experiment would use a different target, interaction process, detector technology, and location {{it would be a very}} complementary test of Davis's results.|$|E
5000|$|While it is {{now known}} that the {{chlorine}} experiment detected neutrinos, some physicists {{at the time were}} suspicious of the experiment, mainly because they did not trust such radiochemical techniques. Unambiguous detection of solar neutrinos was provided by the Kamiokande-II experiment, a water <b>Cerenkov</b> <b>detector</b> with a low enough energy threshold to detect neutrinos through neutrino-electron elastic scattering. In the elastic scattering interaction the electrons coming out of the point of reaction strongly point in the direction that the neutrino was travelling, away from the Sun. This ability to [...] "point back" [...] at the Sun was the first conclusive evidence that the Sun is powered by nuclear interactions in the core. While the neutrinos observed in Kamiokande-II were clearly from the Sun, the rate of neutrino interactions was again suppressed compared to theory at the time. Even worse, the Kamiokande-II experiment measured about 1/2 the predicted flux, rather than the chlorine experiment's 1/3.|$|E

50|$|The {{first of}} the Kamioka {{experiments}} was named KamiokaNDE for Kamioka Nucleon Decay Experiment. It was a large water <b>Čerenkov</b> <b>detector</b> designed to search for proton decay. To observe the decay of a particle with a lifetime {{as long as a}} proton an experiment must run {{for a long time and}} observe an enormous number of protons. This can be done most cost effectively if the target (the source of the protons) and the detector itself are made of the same material. Water is an ideal candidate because it is inexpensive, easy to purify, stable, and can detect relativistic charged particles through their production of Čerenkov radiation. A proton decay detector must be buried deep underground or in a mountain because the background from cosmic ray muons in such a large detector located on the surface of the Earth would be far too large. The muon rate in the KamiokaNDE experiment was about 0.4 events per second, roughly five orders of magnitude smaller than what it would have been if the detector had been located at the surface.|$|E

40|$|This {{study of}} a water <b>Cerenkov</b> <b>detector</b> is {{motivated}} by the KARMEN neutrino experiment which uses #nu#_#mu#, #nu#_e and anti #nu#_#mu# produced with equal intensity in the #pi#"+-#mu#"+-decay chain at the beam stop target of the ISIS neutron spallation source at the Rutherford Appleton laboratory in England. These neutrimos are detected via neutrino-nucleus interactions, mainly on " 1 " 2 C, in a modular liquid scintillation calorimeter. A second, widely used method for neutrino detection with large volumes is the detection of secondary particles via Cerenkov effect. The {{purpose of this study}} is the investigation of the physical potential of a water <b>Cerenkov</b> <b>detector</b> and its capability to detect interactions of beam stop neutrinos with the detector material water. These #nu#-induced reactions were simulated with special emphasis on #nu#-e"-scattering. It could be shown in detailed simulations that #nu#-e"- scattering observed in a water <b>Cerenkov</b> <b>detector</b> is an excellent tool to test the standard model. The simulation contains the Cerenkov effect, the electromagnetic interaction of e"- in water, the transport of photons in water as well as their detection by photomultipliers. Together with the reconstruction of the event position, time, direction and energy, such a complete treatment provides detailed knowledge about the energy dependent detection efficiency and detector resolution functions. The measurement of the #nu#-e"- scattering interference term of neutral and charged weak current is an ideal way to analyse the structure of weak interactions. It is shown that a large volume water <b>Cerenkov</b> <b>detector</b> at a beam stop neutrino source can investigate an anomal magnetic moment of the neutrino in a range of #mu#_#nu# #approx# 10 "-" 1 " 0 #mu#_B. The low energies of the neutrinos (E_#nu# < 50 MeV) favor such a search. In addition, measuring #nu# nucleus interactions on " 1 " 6 O can be used to search for #nu# oscillations. Results from KARMEN show the importance to identify and suppress background induced by cosmic muons, especially for detectors at sea level. Therefore, also cosmic muons penetrating the <b>Cerenkov</b> <b>detector</b> were simulated. These simulations resulted in precise rates of stopped and throughgoing muons together with reconstruction algorithms for the muon stopping positions using their Cerenkov signals. (orig.)
