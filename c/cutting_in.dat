5|$|Napoli winger Insigne {{opened the}} scoring in the 11th minute by <b>cutting</b> <b>in</b> {{from the left}} and curling a shot past Fiorentina goalkeeper Neto. He doubled the lead six minutes later by {{connecting}} to Higuaín's cross and forcing a deflection off Nenad Tomović. With two goals in the final, he equalled the amount of goals that he had scored in the entire Serie A season. Fiorentina responded in the 28th minute, when Josip Iličić chipped the defence and Juan Vargas volleyed {{the ball into the}} goal. In the last minute of the half, Alberto Aquilani put the ball into Napoli's goal, but it was disallowed for offside.|$|E
5|$|Nearly all Khmer Loeu are animist, {{and their}} cosmologies are {{intertwined}} with the natural world. Some forests {{are believed to be}} inhabited by local spirits, and local taboos forbid <b>cutting</b> <b>in</b> those areas. Within spirit forests, certain natural features such as rock formations, waterfalls, pools, and vegetation are sacred. Major sacrificial festivals in Ratanakiri occur during March and April, when fields are selected and prepared for the new planting season. Christian missionaries are present in the province, and some Khmer Loeu have converted to Christianity. The region's ethnic Khmer are Buddhist. There is also a small Muslim community, consisting mainly of ethnic Cham.|$|E

It is mostly underground, and consists of 7 kilometres of bored tunnels and 1.5 kilometres of cut and cover tunnels, with only 2 kilometres above ground. In the Eastern Suburbs, three tunnels proceed in a westerly direction from Bondi Junction via Edgecliff and Kings Cross; in each of these tunnels there are stations. Between Bondi Junction and Edgecliff there is a short open-air <b>cutting</b> <b>in</b> Woollahra, and between Edgecliff and Kings Cross there is a short viaduct over Rushcutters Bay.|$|E

5|$|Ahead of 2012–13, Charles {{signed a}} new two-year {{contract}} with the club. He started in the club's first match of the season, a 3–1 home win over AFC Wimbledon in the League Cup, playing the whole match at left back. He scored his first goal {{of the season in}} a 1–1 draw against Shrewsbury Town on 1 September 2012, after <b>cutting</b> <b>in</b> from the wing to strike into the top corner to restore parity in the match. It turned out to be his only goal of the season as Charles played most of the season at left back, making 41 appearances during the season. With a year remaining on his current deal, Charles' contract was extended for a further year in June 2013, keeping him contracted to the club until the summer of 2015. He made a goalscoring start to 2013–14, scoring after pouncing on a loose ball in a 4–3 home defeat to Oldham Athletic on the opening day of the season.|$|E
5|$|Kashyap's {{production}} company Anurag Kashyap Films released its first film Udaan (2010)—a critical success that {{earned him the}} Filmfare Award for Best Story and Best Screenplay. He then directed one of the short films in the anthology film Mumbai <b>Cutting.</b> <b>In</b> 2011, he acted in Tigmanshu Dhulia's crime thriller Shagird, portraying {{the role of the}} antagonist. After directing the thriller That Girl in Yellow Boots (2011), the two-part crime film Gangs of Wasseypur (2012) was his next release, which garnered him the Filmfare Award for Best Dialogue. In 2013, he directed a short film on eve teasing titled That Day After Everyday, and directed one segment of the anthology film Bombay Talkies (2013). In 2013, he co-produced The Lunchbox, a film that was nominated for the BAFTA Award for Best Film Not in the English Language, and the biographical drama Shahid. In 2011, Kashyap started another {{production company}} Phantom Films, whose first feature was the period drama Lootera (2013).|$|E
5|$|The viper dogfish feeds {{primarily}} on bony fishes, notably lanternfishes in the genera Benthosema and Diaphus, and also takes crustaceans. Its long jaws and slender teeth are adapted for grasping rather than <b>cutting,</b> <b>in</b> {{contrast to the}} short jaws and saw-like lower teeth of other dogfish sharks that are suited for excising chunks of meat. Prey is seized by a rapid extension of the jaws and swallowed whole; the shark can consume fish close to 40% as long as itself. The viper dogfish is the only dogfish species that lacks a suborbital muscle, which is normally responsible for pulling the jaws forward when biting. Jaw protrusion is instead effected by the hyomandibular bone, which is articulated to the skull {{in a manner that}} allows it to swing down and forward. This unique arrangement serves to increase the distance the shark can protrude its jaws, as well as the size of its gape both vertically and horizontally.|$|E

5|$|Ahead of the 2010–11 season, Bostwick {{scored in}} a {{pre-season}} friendly against Hitchin Town, {{and made his}} first league appearance in the club's 2–2 draw with Macclesfield Town, playing the whole match. He scored his first goal {{of the season in}} the club's first ever Football League victory, in a 3–1 win against Stockport County, scoring with a shot from 30yards to double Stevenage's lead just before the interval. In November 2010, Bostwick provided two assists for Stevenage's goals in the club's 3–0 win away at local rivals Barnet. Bostwick scored his second goal of the 2010–11 season in Stevenage's 3–1 FA Cup win over Newcastle United in January 2011. Bostwick picked up a loose pass and rifled a shot that went in off the post from 25yards out to give Stevenage a two-goal lead. A month later, he scored his third goal of the season in a 4–0 win against Cheltenham Town, <b>cutting</b> <b>in</b> from the right and drilling a low shot across the face of goal and past the goalkeeper. Bostwick played a total of 51 matches during the 2010–11 season, scoring three goals. This included three appearances in the 2010–11 League Two play-offs following Stevenage's sixth-placed finish. Following a 3–0 aggregate victory over Accrington Stanley, Stevenage earned promotion to League One after a 1–0 win against Torquay United at Old Trafford on 28 May 2011, with Bostwick playing the whole match.|$|E

40|$|Delayed {{collapse}} of <b>cuttings</b> <b>in</b> stiff high-plasticity clay {{is known to}} be significantly affected by long-term recovery of pore pressures and progressive failure resulting from brittle material behaviour. Limit equilibrium methods are not well equipped to model these effects, but the increasing use of numerical modelling offers new potential to improve understanding of these failure mechanisms. A series of numerical analyses incorporating brittle material behaviour has been undertaken, specifically considering deep-seated first-time failure of <b>cuttings</b> <b>in</b> weathered London Clay. Because of progressive failure, the average mobilised strength is between the peak bulk strength and the residual strength. In current practice, parameter selection is often based on Chandler and Skempton's back-analysis of several deep-seated failures in the brown weathered London Clay.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this work was to study the {{behaviour}} of Platanus acerifolia Willd. to propagation by cuttings. Over three consecutive years, rooting responses were evaluated <b>in</b> <b>cuttings</b> collected on different dates, treated with indole- 3 -butyric acid (IBA) or naphthaleneacetic acid (NAA) at different concentrations as hydro-alcoholic solutions, powder preparations or potassium salts, and exposed to bottom-heat for different periods of time. A high natural rooting capacity was observed, particularly <b>in</b> <b>cuttings</b> collected <b>in</b> December and January. Auxin treatments at concentrations between 0. 025 - 6 mg ml - 1, applied to <b>cuttings</b> planted <b>in</b> bottom-heated benches, were unsuccessful or had negative effects on the rooting of cuttings, while {{they appeared to be}} positive if applied to <b>cuttings</b> planted <b>in</b> the field.
