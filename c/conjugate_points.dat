Recently, the <b>conjugate</b> <b>point</b> was defined for an extremal problem in R^n. The key of the <b>conjugate</b> <b>point</b> is cooperation of variables.

We call such a set of variables a strict conjugate set. This idea leads us to a cooperative game, which we call a conjugate-set game. The Shapley value is an important value in game theory. It evaluates player 2 ̆ 7 s contribution in the cooperative game. However, its calculation is usually very hard.

40|$|The <b>conjugate</b> <b>point</b> is {{a global}} concept in the {{calculus}} of variations. It {{plays a crucial role}} to guarantee optimality. Recently, a <b>conjugate</b> <b>point</b> theory was proposed for a minimization problem of a smooth function with n variables in [2] and [3], which matches Jacobi 2 ̆ 7 s classical <b>conjugate</b> <b>point</b> theory. In either theory, collaboration of variables is essential. Namely, even when a couple of variables can not improve a solution, collaboration of several variables may find a better solution. If such a set of variables exists, we call it a strict conjugate set. Then a simple question arises. How much does each variable of the strict conjugate set contribute to improve the solution? The aims of this paper are to emphasize a game-theoretic aspect of the <b>conjugate</b> <b>point</b> and to give an answer to the above question. To achieve the aims, we will define a cooperative game based on conjugate sets, which we call the conjugate-set game. Furthermore, we will compute the Shapley value for the conjugate-set game...|$|R
