25|$|Acrolein is a {{pyrolysis}} {{product that is}} abundant in cigarette smoke. It gives smoke an acrid smell and an irritating, lachrymatory effect and is {{a major contributor to}} its carcinogenicity. Like PAH metabolites, acrolein is also an electrophilic alkylating agent and permanently binds to the DNA base guanine, by a conjugate addition followed by cyclization into a hemiaminal. The acrolein-guanine adduct induces mutations during DNA copying and thus causes cancers {{in a manner similar to}} PAHs. However, acrolein is 1000 times more abundant than PAHs in cigarette smoke and is able to react as is, without metabolic activation. Acrolein has been shown to be a mutagen and carcinogen in human cells. The carcinogenicity of acrolein has been difficult to study by animal experimentation, because it has such a toxicity that it tends to kill the animals before they develop cancer. Generally, compounds able to react by conjugate addition as electrophiles (so-called Michael acceptors after Michael reaction) are toxic and carcinogenic, because they can permanently alkylate DNA, similarly to mustard gas or aflatoxin. Acrolein is only one of them present in cigarette smoke; for example, <b>crotonaldehyde</b> has been found in cigarette smoke. Michael acceptors also contribute to the chronic inflammation present in tobacco disease.|$|E

40|$|<b>Crotonaldehyde</b> (2 -butenal) {{adsorption}} over gold sub-nanometer particles, and {{the influence}} of co-adsorbed oxygen, has been systematically investigated by computational methods. Using density functional theory, the adsorption energetics of <b>crotonaldehyde</b> on bare and oxidised gold clusters (Au 13, d = 0. 8 nm) were determined as a function of oxygen coverage and coordination geometry. At low oxygen coverage, sites are available for which <b>crotonaldehyde</b> adsorption is enhanced relative to bare Au clusters by 10 kJ mol− 1. At higher oxygen coverage, <b>crotonaldehyde</b> is forced to adsorb in close proximity to oxygen weakening adsorption by up to 60 kJ mol− 1 relative to bare Au. Bonding geometries, density of states plots and Bader analysis, are used to elucidate <b>crotonaldehyde</b> bonding to gold nanoparticles in terms of partial electron transfer from Au to <b>crotonaldehyde,</b> and note that donation to gold from <b>crotonaldehyde</b> also becomes significant following metal oxidation. At high oxygen coverage we find that all molecular adsorption sites have a neighbouring, destabilising, oxygen adatom so that despite enhanced donation, <b>crotonaldehyde</b> adsorption is always weakened by steric interactions. For a larger cluster (Au 38, d = 1. 1 nm) <b>crotonaldehyde</b> adsorption is destabilized in this way even at a low oxygen coverage. These findings provide a quantitative framework to underpin the experimentally observed influence of oxygen on the selective oxidation of crotyl alcohol to <b>crotonaldehyde</b> over gold and gold–palladium alloys...|$|E
40|$|<b>Crotonaldehyde,</b> {{a highly}} toxic alpha, beta-unsaturated aldehyde, {{is a major}} {{component}} of cigarette smoke and a ubiquitous environmental pollutant. <b>Crotonaldehyde</b> exposure is known to have adverse effects on respiratory health, but the underlying mechanisms remain obscure. To examine the interaction between macrophages and airway epithelial cells after exposure to <b>crotonaldehyde,</b> BEAS- 2 B and A 549 cells were treated with conditioned media from a human monocytic leukemia cell line (THP- 1) cells stimulated with <b>crotonaldehyde.</b> We demonstrate that conditioned media from THP- 1 cells stimulated with <b>crotonaldehyde</b> increased interleukin (IL) - 8 production, enhanced nuclear factor (NF) -kappa B and AP- 1 DNA-binding activity in BEAS- 2 B and A 549 cells. Analysis of these conditioned media revealed marked increases in tumor necrosis factor (TNF) -alpha, IL- 1 beta and IL- 8 levels. Preincubation of conditioned media with either TNF-alpha- or IL- 1 beta-neutralizing antibodies reduced IL- 8 production. Furthermore, BEAS- 2 B and A 549 cells directly treated with <b>crotonaldehyde</b> induced increase in IL- 8 production. These data suggest that <b>crotonaldehyde</b> is capable of directly stimulating the production of IL- 8 in both macrophages and airway epithelial cells. Crotonaldehyde-stimulated macrophages also amplify the inflammatory response by enhancing IL- 8 release from airway epithelial cells mediated by NF-kappa B and AP- 1 pathways through a mechanism involving TNF-alpha and IL- 1 beta. These findings indicate that <b>crotonaldehyde</b> can cause lung inflammatory response via multiple mechanisms, and may contribute to chronic airway inflammation in smokers.

40|$|<b>Crotonaldehyde,</b> {{a highly}} electrophilic alpha, beta-unsaturated aldehyde, is a {{ubiquitous}} environmental pollutant and {{a risk factor}} for multiple respiratory diseases. <b>Crotonaldehyde</b> is highly volatile and hydrophilic, so it is efficiently absorbed in the respiratory tract. Alveolar macrophages are major effector cells of the nonspecific host defence in the lung. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the molecular mechanisms and signaling pathways responsible for cell death of alveolar macrophage induced by <b>crotonaldehyde.</b> Our results show that <b>crotonaldehyde</b> induces apoptosis in alveolar macrophages, as indicated by phosphatidylserine externalization and DNA fragmentation. Pretreatment of alveolar macrophages with N-acetylcysteine, ascorbic acid, alpha-tocopherol, superoxide dismutase inhibited crotonaldehyde-induced apoptosis. Crotonaldehyde-induced apoptosis was characterized by ROS generation, GSH depletion, loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (Delta Psi m), the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria, caspase- 3 / 7 and caspase- 9 activation, elevation of intracellular Ca 2 + concentration and the increase of p 53 expression. Furthermore, pretreatment with either p 53 inhibitor pifithrin-alpha or calcium chelator BAP-TA-AM effectively attenuated apoptosis induced by <b>crotonaldehyde.</b> Taken together, our results showed that <b>crotonaldehyde</b> induce apoptosis in alveolar macrophages through intracellular calcium, mitochondria and p 53 signaling pathways.

40|$|Humans are ubiquitously {{exposed to}} <b>crotonaldehyde</b> to a {{strongly}} varying extent, in particular, via food and alcoholic beverages. Like other,-unsaturated carbonyl compounds, <b>crotonaldehyde</b> forms 1,N 2 -propanodeoxyguanosine adducts and is genotoxic, mutagenic, and carcinogenic. This {{study was designed}} to perform a cancer risk assessment on the basis of TD 50, which was available from a long-term cancer study with F- 344 rats (F. L. Chung et al., Cancer Res., 46 : 1285 – 1289, 1986), and the estimated daily intake via food and beverages. A relatively high cancer risk of 0. 1 – 1 cancer incidence/ 103 humans was extrapolated {{on the basis of the}} TD 50 from the cancer study of Chung et al. for the estimated dietary intake and drinking wine. To compare the 1,N 2 -propanodeoxyguanosine DNA adduct levels of <b>crotonaldehyde</b> with the assessed cancer risk, we synthesized adduct standards and developed a 32 P-postlabeling method for DNA adducts of <b>crotonaldehyde</b> providing a detection limit of 3 adducts/ 109 nucleotides. Repeated gavages of 10 and 1 mg/kg were given to simulate the steady-state situation of the animal cancer study of Chung et al. and to estimate the adduct levels after intake of <b>crotonaldehyde</b> via food. The estimated adduct levels at these <b>crotonaldehyde</b> intakes were in the range of 3 adducts/ 109 nucleotides. The adducts persisted to a certain extent. The persistence is important for considering the steady-state situation after permanent intakes of <b>crotonaldehyde</b> via food. However, the adducts are repaired to some extent; 2 weeks after the last of repeated gavages, only 19 % of the initial amount measured directly after the last gavage is left.
