40|$|<b>Cardiac</b> <b>indices</b> {{estimation}} is {{of great}} importance during identification and diagnosis of cardiac disease in clinical routine. However, estimation of multitype <b>cardiac</b> <b>indices</b> with consistently reliable and high accuracy is still a great challenge due to the high variability of cardiac structures and complexity of temporal dynamics in cardiac MR sequences. While efforts have been devoted into cardiac volumes estimation through feature engineering followed by a independent regression model, these methods suffer from the vulnerable feature representation and incompatible regression model. In this paper, we propose a semi-automated method for multitype <b>cardiac</b> <b>indices</b> estimation. After manual labelling of two landmarks for ROI cropping, an integrated deep neural network Indices-Net is designed to jointly learn the representation and regression models. It comprises two tightly-coupled networks: a deep convolution autoencoder (DCAE) for cardiac image representation, and a multiple output convolution neural network (CNN) for indices regression. Joint learning of the two networks effectively enhances the expressiveness of image representation with respect to <b>cardiac</b> <b>indices,</b> and the compatibility between image representation and indices regression, thus leading to accurate and reliable estimations for all the <b>cardiac</b> <b>indices.</b> When applied with five-fold cross validation on MR images of 145 subjects, Indices-Net achieves consistently low estimation error for LV wall thicknesses (1. 44 ± 0. 71 mm) and areas of cavity and myocardium (204 ± 133 mm^ 2).

We propose a systematic procedure based on nonparametric bootstrap resampling methods to obtain standard errors and confidence intervals for a test. This test detects changes in the statistical distribution of <b>cardiac</b> <b>indices</b> from ICD-stored EGM during VF, due to discrepancies in acquisition and preprocessing conditions. As an application example, significant changes in the distributions of selected spectral indices due to lead configuration were found by comparing measurements obtained from simultaneously recorded unipolar and bipolar EGM during VF.

Structural and functional <b>cardiac</b> <b>indices</b> measured by two dimensional, M mode and Doppler echocardiography. Data were analyzed by ANOVA, post-hoc Tukey and Pearson ´ correlation coefficient at significance level 0. 05. M-mode and two-dimensional measurements of the right and left ventricular cavity and wall were obtained in elite orienteers and sedentary males. For the right ventricle and wall, multiple cross-sections were used and measurements were obtained from the right ventricular inflow and outflow tract. The results indicated that LVDd was significantly greater in the thriathletes compared with the nonathletes (P 0. 05). In the end, the results indicated a close linear correlation between LVM with LVD and PW. [Rasoul HashemKandi Asadi, Mir Hamid Salehian, Jafar Barghi Moghaddam, Mehdi Faramoushi.

5000|$|The Revised <b>Cardiac</b> Risk <b>Index</b> (RCRI) {{is a tool}} used to {{estimate}} a patient's risk of perioperative cardiac complications.

40|$|There are {{currently}} no reported <b>cardiac</b> <b>indices</b> for the Nigerian dog. The {{aim of the}} study was to obtain breed specific echocardiographic indices for Nigerian local dogs.

The result of the study showed that posterior wall thickness in diastole and systole (PWTd, PWTs), septal wall thickness in diastole and systole (SWTd, SWTs), and left ventricular internal diameter in diastole and systole (LVIDd LVIDs) were positively and significantly correlated with body weight. Except PWT and functional indices like ejection fraction (EF) and fractional shortening (FS) whose values were higher than some breeds in literature, all other indices were within the range of values obtained in breeds previously studied.

A total of 106 patients were included (mean age 57 ± 12 years, EF 24 ± 8 %, PCWP 21 ± 7 mmHg, mitral E/Ea 20 ± 12). There was a lack of correlation between mitral E/Ea and PCWP, particularly in those with larger LV volumes, more impaired <b>cardiac</b> <b>indices,</b> and the presence of cardiac resynchronization therapy. Overall, mitral E/Ea was similar among patients with PCWP> and ≤ 18 mmHg, and sensitivity and specificity for mitral E/Ea> 15 to identify a PCWP> 18 mmHg was 66 % and 50 %, respectively. Contrary to prior reports, we did not observe any direct association between changes in PCWP and changes in mitral E/Ea.
