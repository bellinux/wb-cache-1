With this information, the problem {{statement}} can be refined as [...] "how to determine the optimal parenthesization of a product of n matrices?" [...] Checking each possible parenthesization (brute force) would require a run-time that is exponential {{in the number of}} matrices, which is very slow and impractical for large n. A quicker solution to this problem can be achieved by breaking up the problem into a set of related subproblems.

50|$|A common {{approach}} for targeted immunization studies in scale-free networks focuses on targeting {{the highest degree}} nodes for immunization. These nodes are the most highly connected in the network, making them more likely to spread the contagion if infected. Immunizing this segment of the network <b>can</b> <b>drastically</b> <b>reduce</b> {{the impact of the}} disease on the network and requires the immunization of far fewer nodes compared to randomly selecting nodes. However, this strategy relies on knowing the global structure of the network, which may not always be practical.|$|E
