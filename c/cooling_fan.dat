5|$|Three {{independent}} {{hydraulic systems}} are {{installed on the}} 757, one powered by each engine, and the third using electric pumps. A ram air turbine is fitted to provide power for essential controls {{in the event of}} an emergency. A basic form of fly-by-wire facilitates spoiler operation, utilizing electric signaling instead of traditional control cables. The fly-by-wire system, shared with the 767, reduces weight and provides for the independent operation of individual spoilers. When equipped for extended-range operations, the 757 features a backup hydraulic motor generator and an additional <b>cooling</b> <b>fan</b> in the aircraft's electronics bay.|$|E
5|$|The chassis of the C5 {{consists}} of two identical metal pressings which are joined at top and bottom with a closing plate at the rear. It lacks a separate suspension system, instead relying on the chassis structure having enough torsional flex. Its motor was produced in Italy by Polymotor, {{a subsidiary of the}} Dutch company Philips. Although it was later famously said that the C5 was powered by a washing machine motor, the motor was in fact developed from a design produced to drive a truck <b>cooling</b> <b>fan.</b> Lotus provided the gearbox and a rear axle based on a design for car steering columns. The C5's electronics were produced by MetaLab, a Sinclair spin-off. The wheels were assembled from tyres made in Taiwan and wheels from Italy. Oldham Batteries provided a lead-acid battery developed for Sinclair that could manage more than the 300 charge-discharge cycles that had originally been specified.|$|E

25|$|The engine's design {{concentrated}} on the reduction of moving parts. The <b>cooling</b> <b>fan</b> and dynamo were built integrally with the one-piece crankshaft, removing the need for drive belts. The use of gaskets, seen as another potential weak point for failure and leaks, was also kept to a minimum. The cylinder heads are mated to the cylinder barrels by lapped joints with extremely fine tolerances, as are {{the two halves of}} the crankcase and other surface-to-surface joints.|$|E

25|$|A second fire {{incident}} {{took place}} in August 2012 when a Karma caught fire while stopped at a parking lot in Woodside, California. According to Fisker engineers, the area of origin for the fire {{was determined to be}} outside the engine compartment, as the fire was located at the driverâ€™s side front corner of the car. The evidence suggested that the ignition source was not the lithium-ion battery pack, new technology components or unique exhaust routing. The investigation conducted by Fisker engineers and an independent fire expert concluded that the cause of the fire was a low temperature <b>cooling</b> <b>fan</b> located at the left front of the Karma, forward of the wheel. An internal fault caused the fan to fail, overheat and started a slow-burning fire. Fisker announced a voluntary recall on all Karmas sold to replace the faulty fan and install an additional fuse.|$|E
25|$|Both VAM Rebel-based Rambler Classics {{included}} {{almost the}} same equipment between the two body styles {{with only a few}} exceptions. The largest difference was in the front seats. The Classic 770 came with full-width bench seat while the Classic SST had individually adjustable units, even though some of the hardtops came with a front bench. The standard features included flow-through ventilation, front door flip-open air vents, four-wheel drum brakes, rigid four-bladed <b>cooling</b> <b>fan,</b> day-night rearview mirror, two-speed electric wipers, electric washers, luxury steering wheel, electric clock, 200km/h speedometer, cigarette lighter, front ashtray, AM Motorola radio with antenna, locking glove box, courtesy lights, dual rear ashtrays, four side armrests, front two-point seatbelts, dual coat hooks, dual dome lights on C-pillars (except 1969-1970 sedan), single dome light on headliner (1969-1970 sedan only), fold-down armrest integrated to the rear seat back, bright molding package, luxury wheel covers, back-up lights, turn lights, and driver's side remote mirror. Optional equipment for both models included power drum brakes (standard with automatic transmission), power steering, automatic transmission (not available in 1967 and 1968), remote controlled driver and passenger outside mirrors, heater with front defroster, rubber-faced bumper guards, bumper tubes, and a locking gas cap, among others. Sales the two-door hardtop body style declined in 1970.|$|E
500|$|The {{tank was}} {{powered by a}} T-26 [...] flat row 4-cylinder {{air-cooled}} petrol engine, which was a complete Soviet copy of the Armstrong Siddeley engine used in the Vickers 6-Ton. The engine was located in the rear part of the hull. Early Soviet-made tank engines were of bad quality but they became better beginning in 1934. The T-26 (Armstrong Siddeley) engine {{did not have an}} over-speed limiter, which often resulted in overheating and engine valve breakage, especially in summer. A fuel tank for [...] and an oil box for [...] were placed alongside the engine. The engine required top-grade petrol; the use of second-rate petrol could cause damage to the valve units because of engine detonation. From mid-1932, a more capacious fuel tank (290 L instead of 182 L) and a simplified oil box were introduced. An engine <b>cooling</b> <b>fan</b> was mounted over the engine in a special shroud. From early 1932, the exhaust silencer was affixed by three clamps instead of two.|$|E
40|$|Bearings with an {{insufficient}} {{amount of}} lubricant {{can lead to}} early field failures, especially in applications which fail due to lubricant degradation, such as <b>cooling</b> <b>fans</b> used for thermal management of electronics. A reduced amount of lubricant can accelerate the wear process in the bearing, since {{there is not enough}} lubricant film thickness to support the operating load on the bearing. Qualification of bearings in <b>cooling</b> <b>fans</b> is carried out by time-truncated tests, where <b>cooling</b> <b>fans</b> have to operate without failure for a pre-determined period of time. Under-lubricated bearings can survive without failure in these tests leading to the usage of these bearings in the field resulting in field returns and warranty claims.

5000|$|Vents {{are often}} {{found on the}} front, back, top, left side panel, and {{sometimes}} {{on the right side}} panel of the case. Regardless of their placement, their purpose is either to let cool air into the case, or to let hot air out. Larger vents usually allow <b>cooling</b> <b>fans</b> to be mounted via surrounding threaded screw holes. Newer cases include mountings for larger 120mm or 140mm <b>cooling</b> <b>fans</b> for quieter operation than the 80mm fans formerly common.|$|R

2500|$|A further {{change was}} made to the transmission. Rather than risk the {{availability}} of the combined Wilson transmission and steering affecting production, the A13 [...] "crash" [...] gear box was used with epicyclic steering units. This had the knock-on effect of a reduced size of <b>cooling</b> <b>fan</b> for the transmission compartment.|$|E
2500|$|The MP6 {{prototype}} {{had large}} grilles {{on the front}} and rear of the rear fender covering the engine. This was done to allow air in to cool the engine, as the prototype did not have fan cooling. [...] A <b>cooling</b> <b>fan</b> similar to that used on the MP5 [...] "Paperino" [...] prototype was included {{in the design of the}} production Vespa, and the grilles were removed from the fender.|$|E
50|$|Other {{challenges}} {{associated with}} centralized inverters include the space required {{to locate the}} device, as well as heat dissipation requirements. Large central inverters are typically actively <b>cooled.</b> <b>Cooling</b> <b>fans</b> make noise, so location of the inverter relative to offices and occupied areas must be considered. And because <b>cooling</b> <b>fans</b> have moving parts, dirt, dust, and moisture can negatively affect their performance over time. String inverters are quieter but might produce a humming noise in late afternoon when inverter power is low.|$|R

2500|$|The unit did {{not include}} a fan, relying instead on {{convection}} cooling, which made it quiet while in operation. Steve Jobs insisted that the Macintosh ship without a fan, which persisted until the introduction of the Macintosh SE in 1987. This was allegedly a source of many common, costly component failures in the first four Macintosh models. [...] This was enough of a problem to prompt the introduction of a third-party, external <b>cooling</b> <b>fan.</b> This fan unit fitted inside the Macintosh's carrying-handle slot and produced a forced draft through the computer's existing ventilation holes.|$|E
2500|$|The year 1986 saw {{improvements}} in engines {{to match the}} more advanced offerings by Japanese competitors. The [...] "Diesel Turbo" [...] engine was introduced in September, a lightly turbocharged version of the existing 2.5-litre diesel, with several changes to suit the higher power output, including a re-designed crankshaft, teflon-coated pistons and nimonic steel exhaust valves {{to cope with the}} higher internal temperatures. Similarly, an eight-bladed <b>cooling</b> <b>fan</b> was fitted, together with an oil cooler. The changes for the turbo diesel were kept as slight as possible, in the aim of making the car saleable in Land Rover's traditional export markets across the globe.|$|E
2500|$|Shortly {{after its}} introduction, the Corvair faced {{competition}} from the Ford Falcon and Mercury Comet and was plagued by problemsâ€”though according to a 1960 Time report, [...] "many were the minor bugs that often afflict a completely new car." [...] Problems included an engine <b>cooling</b> <b>fan</b> belt that tended to pop off its 2-axis pulleys (unless the fan ran constantly, the air-cooled engine would overheat and seize), carburetor icing and poor fuel mileage [...] "which sometimes runs well under 20 m.p.g." [...] The 1960 model gasoline heater was cited as a problem, which itself could consume up to a quart of gas an hourâ€”with Chevrolet engineers quickly modifying the Corvair's carburetors to improve economy.|$|E
