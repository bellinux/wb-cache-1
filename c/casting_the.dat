5|$|Ancient {{tradition}} {{refers to}} only five likenesses of the Buddha, made during his lifetime; two were in India, two in paradise, {{and the fifth}} is the Mahamuni Buddha image in Myanmar. According to the legend, the Buddha visited the Dhanyawadi city of Arakan in 554 BC. King Sanda Thuriya requested that an image was cast of him. After <b>casting</b> <b>the</b> Great Image, the Buddha breathed upon it, and thereafter the image became the exact likeness of the Mahamuni.|$|E
5|$|Casting {{directors}} Patrick J. Rush and Alyson Silverberg began <b>casting</b> <b>the</b> main roles {{eight to}} ten weeks before filming began, with input from Schwartz, McG and Savage. Rush and Silverberg were later nominated in the Dramatic Pilot category of the Casting Society of America's Artios Awards.|$|E
5|$|<b>Casting</b> <b>the</b> role of Dimitri gave All My Children difficulty. The series' casting director, Judy Blye Wilson, tested between {{fifteen and}} twenty actors, {{and could not}} find the right actor for the job. Wilson then learned that the former Dynasty star, Michael Nader was {{available}} and suggested the show offer him the part.|$|E

5|$|In the 23 February 1859 {{edition of}} the Deseret News, the editors {{announced}} their approval of the two new letters and eventual intention to use them in the newsletter. However, due to the hot metal typesetting technology in use at the time, <b>casting</b> <b>the</b> new letters for use {{would have been a}} considerable expense, so it was never realized.|$|E
5|$|Masaccio's use {{of light}} was also revolutionary. While earlier artists like Giotto had applied a flat, neutral light from an unidentifiable source, Masaccio's light emanated from a {{specific}} location outside the picture, <b>casting</b> <b>the</b> figures in light and shadow. This created a chiaroscuro effect, sculpting the bodies into three-dimensional shapes.|$|E

5|$|After the Second World War, Moore's bronzes took {{on their}} larger scale, which was {{particularly}} suited for public art commissions. As {{a matter of}} practicality, he largely abandoned direct carving, and took on several assistants to help produce the larger forms based on maquettes. By {{the end of the}} 1940s, he produced sculptures increasingly by modelling, working out the shape in clay or plaster before <b>casting</b> <b>the</b> final work in bronze using the lost wax technique. These maquettes often began as small forms shaped by Moore's hands—a process which gives his work an organic feeling. They are from the body.|$|E
5|$|Excavation of {{the site}} began in 1971, and became the largest {{to be carried out}} by modern methods on any European monastic site. It {{revealed}} the foundations and lower parts of the walls of the monastery buildings and the abbey church. Important finds included: a Norman doorway; a finely carved arcade; a floor of mosaic tiles, the largest floor area of this type to be found in any modern excavation; the remains of the kiln where the tiles were fired; a bell casting pit used for <b>casting</b> <b>the</b> bell; and a large medieval statue of SaintChristopher.|$|E
5|$|For voice <b>casting,</b> <b>the</b> {{localization}} {{team was}} sent {{a list of}} people who might fit the roles, along with short reels for each actor. Once the actors had been chosen, Bateman wrote the voice direction, which consisted of short blurbs the voice actors saw next to the line they were supposed to say, so they would know how to perform it. While the North American version of the game allows the user to select either Japanese or English audio tracks, the European version, which was released by Rising Star Games, only features the Japanese audio track.|$|E

5|$|Kulintang gongs {{are made}} using the cire perdue method, a lost-wax process used for <b>casting</b> <b>the</b> {{individual}} gongs. The first phase {{is the creation}} of wax molds of the gongs. In the past, before the availability of standardized wax sheets made specifically for foundry use, the molds were made out of either beeswax (talo) or candle wax (kandilà). The wax mold is covered with a special mixture of finely powdered coal/mud, which is applied on the wax surface using a brush.|$|E
5|$|Many of the film's {{actors were}} unknown {{at the time}} of <b>casting.</b> <b>The</b> film was the acting debut of four cast members; Ken Wahl, Tony Ganios, Erland van Lidth and Michael Wright. It was also the feature film debut of Toni Kalem, who had {{previously}} acted on television. Kaufman intentionally cast unknown actors; Wahl {{was on his way to}} a job in a pizza parlor when someone sent a photograph of him to Rudin, thinking he could play one of the smaller roles in the film. Kaufman felt Wahl was talented so he cast him in the lead role instead.|$|E
5|$|Melanie {{was created}} by {{producer}} Mara Brock Akil. While <b>casting</b> <b>the</b> character, Brock Akil had doubts about whether Mowry {{would be the best}} choice, given her wholesome image from starring as Tia Landry on the sitcom Sister, Sister, but hired the actress based on her strong work ethic and her desire {{to be part of the}} series. Mowry considered the character to be her first adult role and felt it emphasized her individuality and maturity. She identified closely with the part, observing parallels between Melanie's relationship with Derwin and her own marriage to actor Cory Hardrict. She cited The Game as an example of women receiving more lead roles on television.|$|E

5|$|Rocky Balboa gives nods to {{previous}} installments via the <b>casting.</b> <b>The</b> most obvious is {{the return of}} Stallone, Young, and Burtonthe only actors to portray the same characters in all six installments. Tarver's appearance in the film marks the sixth time an active professional boxer {{has appeared in the}} series. Previously, Joe Frazier (Rocky), Pedro Lovell (Rocky), Roberto Durán (Rocky II), Tommy Morrison (Rocky V), and Michael Williams (Rocky V) have appeared in the series. Stallone initially wanted Roy Jones, Jr. to portray Dixon, but after Jones did not return Stallone's phone calls, he tapped Antonio Tarver to fill the role. Tarver accidentally knocked out Stallone during the filming of one of the segments of the fight.|$|E

New main characters have been both written {{in and out of the}} series since, with a core of fifteen to twenty main actors employed on the serial at any given time. In <b>casting</b> <b>the</b> first series, Young sought out actors who were already well known in the television industry, something which has continued throughout the show's history, with cast members including Patsy Kensit, Jane Asher, Robert Powell, Adrian Edmondson, Alex Walkinshaw and Jemma Redgrave.|$|E

5|$|There were {{issues with}} <b>casting</b> <b>the</b> film. Paramount Studios' deal with William Shatner had ended {{and so the}} first draft of the film did not feature Captain Kirk. He was later added as a new {{contract}} was signed. However, Leonard Nimoy dropped out of the film because he was concerned over potential merchandising after his likeness as Spock was used in a Heineken advertisement without either his permission or an arrangement for royalties. He had refused to speak publicly about the issue, but Shatner explained it in an interview. The situation was eventually resolved and Nimoy signed on to appear in Planet of the Titans.|$|E
5|$|Three years later, Isaac, Garet, and Jenna {{join their}} teacher, Kraden, in his {{research}} of Mt. Aleph.

The volcano erupts before they can retrieve the final star, but before escaping they capture Jenna and Kraden as eventual bargaining chips. The guardian of Mt. Aleph, the Wise One, appears before Isaac and Garet and instructs them to prevent Saturos' group from <b>casting</b> <b>the</b> Elemental Stars into their respective Elemental Lighthouses across Weyard; if this happens, Alchemy will be restored and the period of instability will begin anew.|$|E
5|$|When <b>casting</b> <b>the</b> many {{characters}} of Pride and Prejudice, the producer Sue Birtwistle and director Simon Langton {{were looking for}} actors with wit, charm and charisma, who could also play the Regency period. Their choices for the story's protagonists, 20-year-old Elizabeth Bennet and 28-year-old Mr Darcy, determined the other actors cast. Hundreds of actresses between 15 and 28 auditioned, and those with the right presence were screen-tested, performing several prepared scenes in period costumes and makeup in a television studio. Straight offers were made to several established actors.|$|E
