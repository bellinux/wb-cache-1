40|$|Objective Although {{body image}} {{disturbance}} (BID) {{is considered a}} core symptom in anorexia nervosa (AN) and bulimia nervosa (BN), {{little is known about}} its psychopathological correlates. The present study aimed at analysing the correlation of aspects of BID with psychopathological and temperamental characteristics. Method A sample of 1288 patients (538 AN and 750 BN) were assessed through a structured diagnostic interview, the Eating Disorders Inventory and Tridimensional Personality Questionnaire. Cognition of body image distortion, <b>weight</b> <b>checking,</b> fear <b>of</b> <b>weight</b> gain and body dissatisfaction were assessed by specific questions during the interview. Results Various aspects of BID formed similar, but not identical, dimensions in AN and BN. In both groups, anticipatory anxiety and interoceptive awareness were significantly and independently associated with body image distortion, whereas ineffectiveness was associated with weight checking. Discussion Body image disturbance is a multidimensional characteristic linked to psychological features, such as anticipatory anxiety, ineffectiveness and interoceptive awareness. These findings have scientific and treatment implications, and should be considered by clinicians in adopting successful treatment strategies...|$|R

30|$|A human user {{perceives}} reduced heaviness while manipulating {{an object}} with power-assist [5]. The user feed-forwardly estimates the manipulative force (load force, grip force) to manipulate (e.g., lift) the object with the PARS depending on visually perceived <b>weight</b> <b>of</b> the object [18]. Here, the load force reflects human’s intent in manipulation that influences the motion [5]. The haptically perceived weight {{is smaller than}} the visually perceived weight [5], and thus, the applied load force estimated by the user based on the visually perceived weight is incorrect (larger than the load force actually required to lift the object to the desired position successfully) that results in harmful motion (acceleration), poor safety and lack of stability [5, 19]. As a consequence, human–robot interaction (HRI) and overall performance in manipulation become unsatisfactory that also reduce user’s trust in the robot [20, 21]. Furthermore, cognitive workload and fatigue may increase if the user undergoes a careful visual <b>check</b> <b>of</b> the prospective <b>weights</b> before handling objects with power-assist to realize the difference between visually and haptically perceived weights.|$|R
40|$|Drug dosage {{should be}} based on weight rather than age and this study aims at {{highlighting}} the problems of possible over-dosage or under-dosage where the <b>weight</b> <b>of</b> the patient is not considered before prescription is given, as is being practice by clinicians in most developed and developing countries. Drug dosing has always been a vital issue in drug administration over time. For instance, the paediatric clinician encounters several limitations of information in paediatric pharmacotherapy which includes small numbers on patients with rare disease, small size studies and huge inter-patient variability among this population. The physiology, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of medications are highly variable and there is need to simplify this variation as much as possible. Tailoring the therapy for children according to their developmental stage as well as chronological age, w hich include selecting the appropriate dosage regimen and age-specific ways to prevent medication errors and enhanced compliance of paediatric patients are both significant problems to be further addressed in paediatric therapy. The basic principles of management of severe falciparum malaria include, initiating treatment immediately; <b>checking</b> <b>of</b> the <b>weight</b> and blood sugar level of patient; choosing drug regimen and calculation of the drug dosage according to patient’s body weight. Unfortunately, this is usually not done in most developing/ developed countries, during adult administration of artemisinin derivatives (orally), which might most likely lead to under dosage of most adult patients predisposing them to possible drug resistance development...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — This study {{presents}} a modified and conceptually simple step-by-step decoding algorithm for binary cyclic BCH codes. Step-by-step decoding temporarily changes one information bit value {{at a time}} and then <b>checks</b> weather the <b>weight</b> <b>of</b> the error pattern decreases by computing the corresponding syndrome matrix determinant. Based on the channel information, this study propose a modified step-by-step decoding, which locates a test set and <b>checks</b> the <b>weight</b> <b>of</b> the error pattern in the decoding procedure. Rather than testing all information bits, the bit positions listed in the test set are examined in the proposed step-by-step decoding. The error performance of the proposed decoding is very close to that of the conventional step-by-step decoding with a low decoding complexity, as in simulations of a BPSK coherent system over AWGN channels.

40|$|The {{kinematic}} {{analysis of}} human grasping is challenging {{because of the}} high number of degrees of freedom involved. The use of principal component and factorial analyses is proposed in the present study to reduce the hand kinematics dimensionality in the analysis of posture for ergonomic purposes, allowing for a comprehensive study without losing accuracy while also enabling velocity and acceleration analyses to be performed. A laboratory study was designed to analyse the effect <b>of</b> <b>weight</b> and diameter in the grasping posture for cylinders. This study measured the hand posture from six subjects when transporting cylinders <b>of</b> different <b>weights</b> and diameters with precision and power grasps. The hand posture was measured using a Vicon® motion-tracking system, and the principal component analysis was applied to reduce the kinematics dimensionality. Different ANOVAs were performed on the reduced kinematic variables to <b>check</b> the effect <b>of</b> <b>weight</b> and diameter <b>of</b> the cylinders, {{as well as that of}} the subject. The results show that the original twenty-three degrees of freedom of the hand were reduced to five, which were identified as digit arching, closeness, palmar arching, finger adduction and thumb opposition. Both cylinder diameter and weight significantly affected the precision grasping posture: diameter affects closeness, palmar arching and opposition, while weight affects digit arching, palmar arching and closeness. The power-grasping posture was mainly affected by the cylinder diameter, through digit arching, closeness and opposition. The grasping posture was largely affected by the subject factor and this effect couldn't be attributed only to hand size. In conclusion, this kinematic reduction allowed identifying the effect of the diameter and <b>weight</b> <b>of</b> the cylinders in a comprehensive way, being diameter more important than weight.

When reloading a weapon, the character <b>checks</b> the <b>weight</b> <b>of</b> the new magazine and determines if it is heavy (full or close to full) or light (empty or close to empty). The game's first-person cover system allows players to hide behind all objects in the world to avoid gunfire. While in cover, players can peek out to take more accurate shots or fire blindly. However, the shape, size and, composition of the object changes its effectiveness at protecting the player. Smaller objects may not cover the player's entire body, and some may not stop bullets.
