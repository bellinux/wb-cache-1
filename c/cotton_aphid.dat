2500|$|Red {{imported}} {{fire ants}} {{have formed a}} relationship with an invasive mealybug, Phenacoccus solenopsis. Colony growth is known to increase if ants have access to resources produced by P. solenopsis, and the population density of these mealybugs is significantly higher in areas where red imported fire ants are present (the spread of P. solenopsis in areas it is not native is attributed {{to the presence of}} the ants). As well as that, the life expectancy and reproductive rate of P. solenopsis both increase. These mealybugs may even be transported by workers back to their nest. Predation of P. solenopsis decreases due to tending workers interfering with the predation and parasitism by natural enemies. Mealybugs are preyed on by the lady beetle (Menochilus sexmaculatus) and are hosts of two parasites (Aenasius bambawalei and Acerophagus coccois) if there are no ants present, but this is different if ants are present. Lady beetles are less frequently seen on plants with red imported fire ants, and the rate of [...] "mummy" [...] nymphs is significantly lower. This is clearly evident as scientists observed that <b>cotton</b> <b>aphid</b> (Aphis gossypii) populations, and the predation of sentinel bollworm eggs, increased in areas with red imported fire ant presence. Red imported fire ants have developed a mutual relationship with another mealybug (Dysmicoccus morrisoni). The ants promote the colony growth of D. morrisoni through protection, covering the colonies up with debris and collecting the honeydew they secrete.|$|E

40|$|The area of {{aeolian sand}} soil in Xinjiang is 3. 7189 X 10 (7) hm(2) and {{occupies}} 25 % {{of the total}} land area. Traditionally, it is considered that aeolian sand soil has low yield of crops due to its poor retention power of soil moisture and soil fertility. However, the stems of cotton growing on aeolian sand soil are small and their fictile shape is easy to be controlled. Thus, a culture mode of "increasing stems and bolls, double-layer and double-stem" of cotton is developed by scientific irrigation and fertilizer spread as well as artificial control of fictile shape based on the growth laws of cotton and the properties of aeolian sand soil, and a lint yield of over 3, 750 kg/hm(2) has been reaped in successive 3 years. Currently, the cotton culture in Xinjiang is rapidly developed, the proportion of cotton-culture areas occupies 40 similar to 60 %, the cultivating areas of other crops are reduced, the ecosystems are simplified, and the natural enemies in cotton fields are reduced. Alfalfa belts of 8 similar to 10 in in width are planted in the zones affected by shelter forests, the occurrence of Therioaphis maculata (Buckton) in alfalfa belts is 10 similar to 15 days earlier than that of <b>cotton</b> <b>aphids</b> (Aphis gossypii Glover), and in the alfalfa belts the quantity of herioaphis maculata (Buckton), the natural enemies, is 13. 65 times of that in cotton fields when the <b>cotton</b> <b>aphids</b> occur.

50|$|In the {{southern}} {{half of the}} USA, {{as far north as}} Arkansas, sexual reproduction of the <b>cotton</b> <b>aphid</b> is not important. Females continue to produce offspring without mating so long as the weather is favourable for feeding and growth. Further north, the <b>cotton</b> <b>aphid</b> can be holocyclic and involve two host species, with a broadleaved tree such as Catalpa, Rhamnus or Hibiscus acting as the primary host. In Europe it reproduces exclusively by asexual reproduction and can produce nearly fifty generations a year under favourable conditions. In Russia various wild plants are hosts to the overwintering eggs. Winged forms then migrate to secondary host species in the families Rosaceae, Chenopodiaceae, Malvaceae, Cruciferae, Cucurbitaceae, Solanaceae, Compositae and others. Parthenogenesis on these hosts allows large populations of aphids to build up quickly. The life span of a parthenogenic female is about twenty days in which time it can produce up to 85 nymphs. These mature in about twenty days at 10 °C and in about four days at 30 °C. As autumn approaches, the winged forms migrate back to the primary hosts. Here, both males and sexual females are produced, mating takes place and the females lay eggs which overwinter, ready to repeat the life cycle the following year.|$|E
50|$|The {{adults and}} nymphs of the <b>cotton</b> <b>aphid</b> {{feed on the}} {{underside}} of leaves or on the growing tips of shoots, sucking juices from the plant. The foliage may become chlorotic and die prematurely. There is often a great deal of leaf curling and distortion which hinders efficient photosynthesis. Honeydew is excreted by the aphids and this allows sooty moulds to grow, resulting in a decrease in {{the quantity and quality of}} the produce. The aphids are a vector of crinkle, mosaic, rosette, CTV and other virus diseases. The aphids' impact is especially important on vegetable crops such as courgette, melon, cucumber, aubergine and strawberry and on cotton, citrus and mallow.|$|E

50|$|The {{wingless}} female <b>cotton</b> <b>aphid</b> has an ovoid body {{about two}} millimetres long in varying shades of green. The legs are yellow, {{as are the}} antennae which are {{three quarters of the}} length of the body. The apices of the femora, tibia and tarsi are black. The cylindrical black siphunculi are wide at the base and one fifth of the body length. The winged female has a fusiform body. Its head and thorax are black, the abdomen yellowish-green with black lateral spots and the antennae are longer than those of the apterous female. The nymphs vary in colour, being shades of green, tan and gray. They often have a dark head, thorax and wing pads and the distal portion of the abdomen is usually dark green. The body appears dull because it is dusted with wax secretions. The oval eggs are yellow when first laid but soon turn glossy black.|$|E

5000|$|Aphids are {{the main}} vector by which CTV is {{transmit}}ted. Initially the United States only had the melon (<b>cotton</b> <b>aphid)</b> Aphis gossypii, spirea aphid Aphis spiraecola, and black citrus aphid Toxoptera aurantii. [...] These aphids transmit the virus much less efficiently than the brown citrus aphid Toxoptera citricida. Toxoptera citricida {{had been found in}} East Asia and South America, and had slowly made its way up through Central America and the Caribbean Islands. By 1993 it had reached Cuba, and in 1995 it was found in Florida. [...] The aphids require at least 30 to 60 minutes of feeding to acquire the virus, and remain viruliferous for at least 24 hours after. T. citricida is much more efficient than the other aphids, and it can transmit CTV strains causing severe stem pitting or decline that the other aphids cannot vector. Even though A. spiraecola is less efficient, it tends to have higher populations and thus can still transfer the virus fairly well. T. aurantii has been shown to only transmit certain strains of CTV. Of the three lesser efficient aphids, A. gossypii has a 78% transmission efficiency, while A. spiraecola and T. aurantii are between 0-6%. [...] The main cultural practice that increases the severity of the CTV is when the citrus trees are grafted onto the sour orange rootstock. Using CTV infected budwood for grafting can transfer the CTV from the original tree to the new one.|$|E
40|$|Abstract The sesquiterpene, (E) -b-farnesene, {{is used by}} many aphid {{species as}} an alarm {{pheromone}} to warn related individuals of predation. Disturbed <b>cotton</b> <b>aphids,</b> Aphis gossypii Glover, released (E) -b-farnesene into the air as detected by solid phase microextraction and gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC–MS). Solvent extracts of <b>cotton</b> <b>aphids</b> of various life stages and weights also were analyzed by GC–MS for sums of ions 69 and 93, which discriminated (E) -b-farnesene from coeluting compounds. Aphids of all life stages and sizes reared on cotton plants in both an environmental chamber and glasshouse contained (E) -b-farnesene in amounts ranging from 0. 1 to 1. 5 ng per individual. The quantities of (E) -bfarnesene in aphids increased in relation to increasing body weight, and variation in individual weights explained about 82 % {{of the variation in}} alarm pheromone. However, the concentrations (ng/mg fresh weight) declined exponentially with increasing body weight. These findings indicate that aphid nymphs try to compensate for their smaller size by producing relatively more pheromone per weight than adults but still cannot approach an evolutionary optimal load, as assumed in adults with the greatest total amounts. This suggests that young aphids need to balance costs of growth and maturation with costs of producing the alarm pheromone...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: <b>Cotton</b> <b>aphid</b> (Aphis gossypii) {{is a key}} pest {{of cotton}} crop. The {{indiscriminate}} use of insecticides and pesticides during 1930 ’s and latter to control insects pests, developed resistance in <b>cotton</b> <b>aphid</b> against these chemicals resulting in outbreak of this pest. <b>Cotton</b> <b>aphid</b> has {{a major impact on}} quality and yield of cotton which emphasizes the need to manage this notorious pest. The main goal of this review is to highlight various strategies viz., biological, chemical and cultural control for <b>cotton</b> <b>aphid</b> management. The selection of suitable control strategy is made on by viewing the severity of <b>cotton</b> <b>aphid</b> outbreak. Furthermore, the role of transgenic crops in lowering <b>cotton</b> <b>aphid</b> population is also described.

Results revealed that TN. 8 was the most susceptible cultivar, while TN. 9 and C.

40|$|Background: The <b>cotton</b> <b>aphid,</b> Aphis gossypii Glover, is a {{destructive}} insect pest worldwide; it {{directly or indirectly}} damages (virus transmission) 300 species of host plants. Knowledge of their ecologically adaptive mechanisms {{at the molecular level}} may provide an essential and urgent method to effectively control this pest. However, no transcriptome information is available for the <b>cotton</b> <b>aphid</b> and sequence data are scarce. Therefore, we obtained transcriptome data. Results: To facilitate such a study, two <b>cotton</b> <b>aphid</b> transcriptomes at different growth stages of cotton, seedling and summer, were sequenced. A total of 161, 396 and 66, 668 contigs were obtained and assembled into 83, 671 and 42, 438 transcripts, respectively. After combining the raw date for both transcriptomes, the sequences were reassembled into 66, 695 transcripts, and 52, 160 were annotated based on BLASTX analyses. Comparison of the transcriptomes revealed that summer presented less challenges for the cotton aphids than the seedling stage of cotton. In total, 58 putative heat shock protein genes and 66 candidate cytochrome p 450 genes were identified with BLASTX.

Studies were conducted on developmental, reproductive, population, and organophosphate insecticide susceptibility effects of juvenoid insect growth regulators OIGRS) on two homopteran pest insects of cotton: <b>cotton</b> <b>aphid,</b> Aphis gossypii Glover, and silverleaf whitefly, Bemisia sp. Three jIGRs were evaluated: kinoprene, fenoxycarb, and piperonyl butoxide. The goal of this research was to determine if these jIGRs could be used to manage populations of <b>cotton</b> <b>aphid</b> and silverleaf whitefly. In field experiments conducted at Vernon/Chillicothe, Texas all three jIGRs were able to suppress population development and alter the normal population structure of <b>cotton</b> <b>aphid.</b> Fenoxycarb was determined to have the greatest population effects. These experiments indicated that jIGRs cause population structure disturbances in <b>cotton</b> <b>aphid</b> by arresting growth midway through nymphal development and interfering with JHregulated reproductive functions. Cotton aphids were exposed from first instar onward to 100 ppm residues of each of the three jIGRs on cotton leaves maintained on polysaccharide gel media (PGM) plates in the laboratory. In this study, JIGRs were shown to cause an average developmental delay of four to five days from first instar to adult. Silverleaf whitefly were exposed to I oo ppm residues of each of the three jIGRs on cotton leaves maintained on PGM plates in the laboratory. In this study, jIGRs were shown to cause an average developmental delay of two to three days from first instar to adult. Glass vial bioassays with cotton aphids and silverleaf whitefly showed that pre exposure to each of the three jIGRs caused increased sensitivity to the organophosphate insecticide diazinon by an average of ten-fold. Similar effects were seen with greenbugs, Schizaphis graminwn (Rondani). The effects of kinoprene, fenoxycarb, and piperonyl butoxide on development, reproduction, diazinon susceptibility, and population structure of <b>cotton</b> <b>aphid</b> and silverlea 7 L whitefly indicate potential roles for these compounds in future integrated management strategies. The data suggest that these compounds may be highly compatible with an integrated pest management approach to control of <b>cotton</b> <b>aphid</b> and silverleaf whitefly populations...|$|E
40|$|Planting Bt cotton in China since 1997 {{has led to}} {{important}} changes in the natural enemy communities occurring in cotton, however their specific effect on suppressing the cotton aphids (being notorious in conventional cotton ecosystem) has not been fully documented yet. We observed strong evidence for top-down control of the aphid population, e. g. the control efficiency of natural enemies on <b>cotton</b> <b>aphid</b> increased significantly in open field cages compared to exclusion cages, accounted for 60. 2, 87. 2 and 76. 7 % in 2011, 2012 and 2013 season, respectively. The <b>cotton</b> <b>aphid</b> populations peaked in early June to late July (early and middle growth stages) in open field cotton survey from 2011 to 2013. The population densities of cotton aphids and natural enemies were highest on middle growth stage while lowest densities were recorded on late stage for aphids and on early plant stage for natural enemies. Aphid parasitoids (Trioxys spp., Aphidius gifuensis), coccinellids and spiders were key natural enemies of <b>cotton</b> <b>aphid.</b> Briefly, natural enemies can suppress aphid population increase from early to middle plant growth stages by providing biocontrol services in Chinese Bt cotton...|$|E
40|$|The {{coexistence}} of species competing for resources can be facilitated by differential effects of temperature on fitness components. The coexisting <b>cotton</b> <b>aphids</b> Aphis gossypii Glover and Acyrthosiphon gossypii Mordvilko show seasonal differences in abundance in North-Western China, the former reaching higher field abundances and declining {{later in the}} season than the latter. We hypothesized that differences in responses to temperature might be the proximate mechanism driving this difference in population dynamics between the two species. Aphids from laboratory-reared colonies and directly collected from the field in early summer were used to study their development, survival and reproduction under a range of constant temperatures. Life-table parameters suggest that A. gossypii performed better than Ac. gossypii under all temperature treatments tested, and the difference tended to be strongest under high temperatures. These observations are consistent with the higher numbers and the later decline of A. gossypii in the field compared with Ac. gossypii. Our findings help in understanding the seasonal population dynamics of both species, as well as in forecasting pest trends under global warming scenarios...|$|R
40|$|Considered a generalist species {{among the}} coccinellids, the multicolored Asian lady beetle Harmonia axyridis (Pallas) (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae) feeds upon small {{arthropods}} and non-prey plant products, a practice which might enhance {{its ability to}} colonize various ecosystems but carries the potential to expose it to prey quality variation and insecticide use. Thus, we examined the effect of four different diets on the development, reproduction, and response to the insecticide lambda-cyhalothrin in this species. Three groups of larvae received laboratory-reared diets: (i) eggs of Anagasta kuehniella (Zeller) (Ak); (ii) eggs of Sitotroga cerealella (Olivier) (Sc); and (iii) eggs of A. kuehniella + S. cerealella at the proportion 1 : 1; and one group received wild-caught <b>cotton</b> <b>aphids,</b> Aphis gossypii Glover (Ag). Notwithstanding the generalist feeding behavior of H. axyridis, development and reproduction esults were superior with diets of Ag or Ak compared with the diet combining 1 : 1 Ak + Sc or the diet of Sc eggs only. Furthermore, the Sc diet {{did not result in}} satisfactory development and reproduction. Despite this significant variation in biological responses, insecticide susceptibility studies using adults that had been reared on these diets showed no statistically significant differences in susceptibility to the lambda-cyhalothrin. 201...|$|R
40|$|Four {{separate}} but complimentary studies investigated {{the role of}} grain sorghum as a predator source for Southern Rolling Plains cotton in 2001 and 2002. Objectives were to: (1) determine the timing and magnitude of predator movement between crops, (2) test putative causes of movement by manipulating prey levels {{at different stages of}} crop phenology, (3) explore the feeding and reproductive behavior of a common predator colonizing cotton, and (4) examine the effects of grain sorghum and uncultivated areas on cotton predator abundance at an area-wide scale. Rubidium mark-recapture experiments indicated grain sorghum fields produced a net predator gain for adjacent cotton. Analysis suggested two coccinellids, Hippodamia convergens Gu?rin-M?neville and Scymnus loewii Mulsant, were responsible for the overall pattern of predator movement. Predator movement into cotton {{did not appear to be}} concentrated at specific stages of sorghum phenology. Manipulations of aphid levels in field cages were used to determine if prey abundance or phenology influenced the movement of H. convergens into cotton. In both years, more lady beetle adults were collected on cotton during the latest stages of sorghum phenology. In the second year, relatively low aphid densities (15 per plant) appeared to influence the movement of beetles onto caged cotton. Carbon isotope ratios of H. convergens were used to assess adult feeding behavior after colonizing cotton and to determine if prey consumed in sorghum contributed to egg production in <b>cotton.</b> Though <b>aphids</b> were absent 2001, H. convergens adults stayed in cotton, did not produce eggs and apparently consumed few prey. <b>Cotton</b> <b>aphids</b> were present in 2002 and H. convergens isotope ratios changed from prey consumed in cotton. The isotope ratios of egg masses collected in 2002 indicated prey consumed in grain sorghum contributed very little to egg production in cotton. An area-wide pattern analysis suggested the abundance of grain sorghum and uncultivated areas both positively influenced cotton predator levels. While these landscape effects were less important overall than prey levels and cotton planting dates, in some sampling periods landscape composition appeared to be the most important factor in determining cotton predator levels...|$|R
