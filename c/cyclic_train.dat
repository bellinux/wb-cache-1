The model’s objectives are to minimize (1) the cycle length and (2) the total journey time of all trains dispatched during one cycle. The model falls outside {{the framework of the}} well-known periodic event scheduling problem and explicitly considers the minimization of cycle length using linear constraints and a linear objective function. We define the model, propose methods for obtaining bounds on the optimal objective value, and describe preprocessing techniques for reducing the number of variables and constraints. Numerous life-size problem instances are solved to optimality using IBM ILOG CPLEX.

40|$|Substantial {{frost heave}} has been {{observed}} in coarse fills in high-speed railway embankments. These coarse fills have very low water contents, and are located above the groundwater table. In an attempt to explain the unexpected frost heave, it is proposed that <b>cyclic</b> <b>train</b> loads cause the development of excess pore water pressure in the underlying subgrade soil, and hence ‘pump’ up the water table to the frost front, which in turn feeds the formation of ice and results in continuous frost heave. A simple quantitative model is then developed to simulate the pumping-enhanced frost heave. The numerical {{results show that the}} proposed mechanism can indeed provide a rational explanation for the otherwise unexpected frost heave. The engineering implications of this new frost heave mechanism are also discussed, in the context of designing frost heave mitigation measures in seasonally frozen regions...|$|E

40|$|Objective 　To {{observe the}} effect of <b>cyclic</b> <b>training</b> on histomorphology of the {{terminal}} structure of rabbit Achilles tendon, and explore its preventive effect on training-based enthesiopathy. Methods 　Seventy-two Japanese white rabbits {{were randomly assigned to}} four groups: control group, jumping group, running group and <b>cyclic</b> <b>training</b> group, 18 for each. Three rabbits of each group were sacrificed at the 2 nd, 3 rd, 4 th, 6 th, 8 th and 10 th week. The terminal insertion tissues of bilateral Achilles tendons were harvested from these rabbits for observing the pathomorphological changes under light microscope, and pathological scoring and statistical analysis were carried out. Results 　Light microscopy showed that the tendon fibers and fibrocartilage in the Achilles tendon insertion region were severely damaged in the jumping group, and though the tendon fibers were damaged severely, the injury to the fibrocartilage was comparatively less serious in the running group. The injuries to the tendon fibers and fibrocartilage were milder in the <b>cyclic</b> <b>training</b> group than in the jumping group and running group. In the 2 nd, 3 rd, 4 th, 6 th and 8 th week, the histopathology score of insertion of Achilles tendon was 1. 17 ± 0. 12, 2. 19 ± 0. 15, 3. 23 ± 0. 20, 4. 66 ± 0. 16, 4. 71 ± 0. 18, 4. 63 ± 0. 13 respectively in the jumping group, and 1. 16 ± 0. 13, 1. 15 ± 0. 14, 2. 18 ± 0. 12, 2. 99 ± 0. 15, 3. 98 ± 0. 16, 4. 01 ± 0. 12 respectively in the running group. Increase in pathological score appeared earlier in the jumping group than in the running group, and a significant increase began at the 3 rd week. The difference in pathological score between the two groups originated mainly from the changes in the tidemark. In the 2 nd, 3 rd, 4 th, 6 th, 8 th and 10 th week, the pathological score of Achilles tendon insertion was 1. 13 ± 0. 14, 1. 16 ± 0. 17, 1. 15 ± 0. 13, 2. 18 ± 0. 13, 2. 17 ± 0. 12, 2. 92 ± 0. 11 respectively in the <b>cyclic</b> <b>training</b> group, and they showed no significant changes as compared with control group at the early stage, but there was an increase at the late stage of the training (6 weeks later), however the score values were lower than those in the jumping group and running group. These changes in score were originated mainly from pathological changes in the paratenon and tidemark. Conclusions 　Jumping training could lead to severe injury to the fiber tissue and fibrocartilage, while running training might result in severe injury to Achilles tendon insertion structure and lighter injury to the fibrocartilage part. <b>Cyclic</b> <b>training</b> model provides suffcient time for repair and reconstruction of Achilles tendon insertion structure, and decrease the severity of the injury to Achilles tendon insertion region. Therefore, use of <b>cyclic</b> <b>training</b> could not only effectively prevent training-based enthesiopathy, but also accelerate the remodeling of the tissue in the insertion region, thus strengthen the repair ability of Achilles tendon against injury...|$|R

40|$|Gravimetric and {{volumetric}} sampling {{techniques are}} reliable for {{the measurement of}} porosity in fully saturated granular filters. However, both methods require a significant effort to gather and prepare samples, are time intensive to process, and do not capture real-time changes. Portable impedance probes serve as a valuable alternative to these destructive and laborious sampling methods. These probes measure the dielectric properties of the soil-water mixtures from which the porosity of filters may be inferred. This study demonstrates that generalized calibrations can result in large errors for porosity estimation when using diverse and small-scale filter types. By comparing with gravimetric and volumetric based porosity measurements for saturated granular filter porosity, impedance probes with filter-specific calibration offer the reliability and confidence owing to its reduced error in a quick, nondestructive fashion.

40|$|Occurrences of inadequacies of subballast as a {{filtration}} {{layer of}} the ballasted rail tracks would become persistent if inappropriate criteria were still {{being used in the}} design. Traditionally, the subballast is considered mainly to act as a stress dissipation layer, more commonly known as a capping layer. Attention towards its function as a granular filter is proven by the fact that common design practice uses design criteria that are primarily based on steady seepage loading that is common in embankment dams. The seepage hydraulics through porous media is influenced by the cyclic mechanical loading generated by passing trains. Under the influence of <b>cyclic</b> <b>train</b> loading, subballast particles rearrange and attempt to attain a more stable configuration through the process of vertical compression, lateral spreading, and particle degradation.

40|$|Scheduling of trains on {{a single}} line {{involves}} using train priorities for the resolution of conflicts. The mathematical programming model described {{in the first part}} of this paper schedules trains over a single line track when the priority of each train in a conflict depends on an estimate of the remaining crossing and overtaking delay. This priority is used in a branch and bound procedure to allow the determination of optimal solutions quickly. This is demonstrated with the use of an example. Rail operations over a single line track require the existence of a set of sidings at which trains can cross and / or overtake each other. Investment decisions on upgrading the number and location of these sidings can have a significant impact on both customer service and rail profitability. Sidings located at insufficient positions may lead to high operating costs and congestion.

40|$|AbstractRailway ballast is {{a highly}} heterogonous {{material}} consisting of a multitude of stone sizes with varying physical characteristics. It is a critical layer of railroad track structures providing drainage, strength, stability and load distribution. Ballast degrades under <b>cyclic</b> <b>train</b> loads {{and needs to be}} maintained to prevent rail misalignment, settlement and buckling, which may necessitate lower train speeds to prevent derailments. This paper utilizes the Discrete Element Method (DEM) code PFC 2 D to model the behaviour of railroad ballast under cyclic loading. It introduces two innovative approaches to capture stone angularity by fitting circular shapes into each stone shape. One of these methods involves a MATLAB® routine and the other an AutoCAD® routine. Inter-particle contact laws in these agglomerations of circular elements reflect the strength of the stones. The advantage of these two techniques over the conventional clumping technique is that they allow modelling stone breakage which is a leading cause of ballast degradation. Previous studies have implemented techniques to simulate the behaviour of a circular particle idealized as a single aggregate under cyclic loads. Three different techniques are presented in this study to better understand the natural behaviour of ballast under loading. In this paper, particle angularity is being introduced by using another method. This numerical study demonstrated the effect of aggregates particle shape on the overall performance of railroad ballast as measured by permanent deformation and degradation of the ballast...|$|E
40|$|Apart {{from being}} a {{protection}} layer against subgrade attrition, the subballast of ballasted rail tracks is designed mainly {{to act as a}} stress dissipation layer or more commonly known as a capping layer. When considered as a filtration layer, subballast would prove to be inadequate due to the use of design criteria that are primarily based on steady seepage loading common in embankment dams. The seepage hydraulics through porous media would have to be influenced by the cyclic mechanical loading generated by the passing trains. Under the influence of <b>cyclic</b> <b>train</b> loading, subballast particles rearrange and attempt to attain a more stable configuration through the process of vertical settlement, lateral spreading, and particle degradation. The deformability of the pore medium itself would then affect the filter condition due to the changes in porosity and its subsequent impact on permeability. This paper presents a new design method that considers the effectiveness of the subballast as granular filter being dependent on the reduction of its porosity and permeability over time. The main factors that are found to contribute to the reduction in porosity within the subballast layer are (a) the plastic deformation generated by the cyclic load from the passing traffic, and (b) the accumulation of migrating fines trapped within the filter voids. Laboratory test results conducted on a novel cyclic loading permeameter apparatus were used to validate the proposed method. Two worked out examples are provided...|$|E
40|$|Large and {{frequent}} <b>cyclic</b> <b>train</b> loading from heavy haul and passenger trains {{often leads to}} progressive track deterioration. The excessive deformation and degradation of ballast and unacceptable differential settlement of track and/or pumping of underlying soft subgrade soils necessitate frequent and costly track maintenance. A proper understanding of load transfer mechanisms and subsequent deformations in track layers is the key element for safe and economical track design and optimum maintenance procedures. Many simplifi ed analytical and empirical design methods {{have been used to}} estimate the settlement and stress-transfer between the track layers. However, these design methods are based on the linear elastic approach, and often only give crude estimates. Given the complexities of the behaviour of the composite track system consisting of rail, sleeper, ballast, sub-ballast and subgrade subject to repeated traffi c loads in a real track environment, the current track design techniques are overly simplifi ed. The track design should also account for the deterioration of ballast due to breakage and subsequent implications on the track deformations. Considering this, an elasto-plastic constitutive model of a composite multi-layer track system is proposed. Constitutive models and material parameters adopted in this numerical model are discussed. A hardening soil model with a non-associative fl ow rule is introduced to accurately simulate the strain-hardening behaviour of ballast. The breakage of ballast observed in large scale triaxial tests is also simulated based on this model. In conjunction, numerical simulations are also performed using a two-dimensional plane-strain fi nite element analysis (PLAXIS) capturing the effects of ballast breakage and track confi ning pressure. The paper also demonstrates the advantages of the proposed elasto-plastic fi nite element simulations when compared to conventional analytical methods used by practitioners that are primarily based on a linear elastic approach...|$|E

40|$|Excessive {{differential}} tunnel settlements {{have been}} observed in Shanghai metro tunnels {{over the past two}} decades and they become a major concern for the operational authority and the designers since would affect the serviceability and possibly safety of the entire metro system. Although there are a large number of metro tunnels constructed in Shanghai, the principal causes of settlement for metro tunnels in Shanghai soft clay have yet to be fully understood. The objectives of this research are to investigate the fundamental soil properties of Shanghai soft clay and the principal long-term settlement mechanisms of shield tunnels in Shanghai. Three interconnected research methodologies, namely field monitoring, laboratory testing and numerical analysis are adopted in this study. The fundamental soil properties of Shanghai soft clay including small-strain shear stiffness, shear behaviour and long-term secondary compressibility (creep) were investigated by carrying out laboratory tests on intact block samples taken from Shanghai. Measured long-term tunnel settlements along Shanghai Metro Lines 1 and 2 (up to 12. 5 and 7. 5 years, respectively), records of groundwater pumping and subsurface soil deformations at Tangqiao location were carefully interpreted and analysed. Based on field monitoring and laboratory test results, principal causes of large long-term tunnel settlements were investigated. In addition, finite element analyses were carried out to verify the likely principal settlement mechanism. Large non-uniform tunnel settlements were observed along both lines throughout the monitoring period. The maximum tunnel settlements were 289 and 144 mm for Lines 1 and 2, respectively. The angular distortion has continued to increase without showing any sign of reaching a steady value. The largest angular distortion was 0. 22 % resulting in leakage patches observed adjacent to some joints of the shield tunnels. Four possible causes were carefully investigated, including the effects of tunnel construction, <b>cyclic</b> <b>train</b> loading, secondary compression of soft clay and groundwater pumping. Due to horizontal layering structures, intact Shanghai soft clay exhibited stiffness anisotropy. The measured degree of inherent stiffness anisotropy in terms of elastic shear modulus ratio [G 0 (hh) /G 0 (hv) ] was 1. 2. Based on long-term oedometer tests, the coefficients of secondary compression were found to be less than 0. 8 %, which is classified to be very low to medium secondary compressibility, according to the classifications defined by Mesri (1973). This finding basically rules out the possibility observed long-term tunnel settlement was attributed to the secondary compressibility of Shanghai clay, as it is always postulated by many researchers and engineers in China. It is found that the sandy Aquifer IV exhibited considerable secondary compression (creep). The compression of Aquifer IV accounted for about 65 % of the measured total tunnel settlement while the compression of soft clay layers contributed less than 20 % to the total tunnel settlement. Among the four causes considered, excessive groundwater pumping from Aquifer IV was the principal reason for the observed large long-term settlements of shield tunnels in Shanghai...|$|E

Among the many solutions that have been proposed most known is adaptive equalisation where <b>cyclic</b> <b>training</b> signals are used to adapt the equaliser to the variability of the acoustic channel. When the channel is rapidly changing, equaliser coefficients are frequently adapting and effective transmitting rate rapidly decreases. Another approach consists in using a priori information obtained from acoustic propagation models.

50|$|The {{roots of}} periodization come from Hans Selye’s model, {{known as the}} General {{adaptation}} syndromeThe GAS describes three basic stages of response to stress: (a) the Alarm stage, involving the initial shock of the stimulus on the system, (b) the Resistance stage, involving the adaptation to the stimulus by the system, and (c) the Exhaustion stage, in that repairs are inadequate, {{and a decrease in}} system function results. The foundation of periodic training is keeping one's body in the resistance stage without ever going into the exhaustion stage. By adhering to <b>cyclic</b> <b>training</b> the body is given adequate time to recover from significant stress before additional training is undertaken. The response to a new stress is to first respond poorly and the response drops off. For example when the body is first exposed to sun a sunburn might develop. During the resistance stage adaptation improves the response to a higher level, called super compensation, than the previous equilibrium. The example would be that a suntan develops. The exhaustion stage is a continuation of the stimulus at too high a level and the increase gained from adaptation is now offset and all gains are lost. The example would be that wrinkles, spots, or even skin cancer develop. The goal in sports periodization is to reduce the stress {{at the point where the}} resistance stage ends so the body has time to recover. In this way the exhaustion stage does not reduce the gains achieved, the body can recover and remain above the original equilibrium point. The next cycle of increased stimulus now improves the response further and the equilibrium point continues to rise after each cycle.|$|R
40|$|Recovery {{stress in}} shape memory alloys (SMAs), {{also known as}} {{blocking}} stress, is an important property generally obtained during heating under a dimensional constraint as the material undergoes the martensitic phase transformation. This property has been instinctively utilized in most SMA shape-setting procedures, and {{has been used in}} numerous applications such as fastening and joining, rock splitting, safety release mechanisms, reinforced composites, medical devices, and many other applications. The stress generation is also relevant to actuator applications where jamming loads (e. g., in case the actuator gets stuck and is impeded from moving) need to be determined for proper hardware sizing. Recovery stresses in many SMA systems have been shown to reach stresses in the order of 800 MPa, achieved via thermo-mechanical training such as pre-straining, heat treatments or other factors. With the advent of high strength, high temperature SMAs, recovery stress data has been rarely probed, and there is no information pertinent to the magnitudes of these stresses. Thus, the purpose of this work is to investigate the recovery stress capability of a precipitation strengthened, Ni 50. 3 Ti 29. 7 Hf 20 (at.) high temperature SMA in uniaxial tension and compression.

We propose to construct and study a consistently sampled correlation filter with space anisotropic regularization (CSSAR) to solve these two problems simultaneously. Our approach constructs a spatiotemporally consistent sample strategy to alleviate the redundancies in training samples caused by the cyclical shifts, eliminate the inconsistencies between training samples and detection samples, and introduce space anisotropic regularization to constrain the correlation filter for alleviating drift caused by occlusion. Moreover, an optimization strategy based on the Gauss-Seidel method was developed for obtaining robust and efficient online learning. Both qualitative and quantitative evaluations demonstrate that our tracker outperforms state-of-the-art trackers in object tracking benchmarks (OTBs) ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract- In OFDM {{transmission}} over an FIR channel, {{an accepted}} method for combating the resultant IS 1 is via {{addition of a}} cyclic prefix whose length exceeds the the FIR channel duration, to each transmitted data block. This converts the time-domain linear convolution of the FIR channel to cyclic convolution, or effectively, to a multiplicative channel distortion in the frequency domain. The (frequency-domain) multiplicative channel is easily estimated by use of a training sequence thereby greatly reducing channel equalization complexity {{at the cost of}} reduction in spectral efficiency due to the cyclic prefix. This paper explores OFDM systems without <b>cyclic</b> prefix and <b>training</b> sequence. By adopting virtual carriers and exploiting the finite alphabet property of the input symbols, a blind technique for joint estimation of channel and data symbols is developed. While this restores the spectral efficiency, it is achieved at the expense of increased processing complexity at the receiver. 1...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. We present LS-CRF, a {{new method}} for <b>training</b> <b>cyclic</b> Con-ditional Random Fields (CRFs) from large {{datasets}} that {{is inspired by}} classical closed-form expressions for the maximum likelihood parameters of a generative graphical model with tree topology. Training a CRF with LS-CRF requires only solving a set of independent regression problems, each {{of which can be}} solved efficiently in closed form or by an itera-tive solver. This makes LS-CRF orders of magnitude faster than classi-cal CRF training based on probabilistic inference, {{and at the same time}} more flexible and easier to implement than other approximate techniques, such as pseudolikelihood or piecewise training. We apply LS-CRF to the task of semantic image segmentation, showing that it achieves on par accuracy to other training techniques at higher speed, thereby allowing efficient CRF training from very large training sets. For example, train-ing a linearly parameterized pairwise CRF on 150, 000 images requires less than one hour on a modern workstation. ...|$|R
40|$|Railway ballast {{breaks down}} and deteriorates {{progressively}} under <b>train</b> <b>cyclic</b> loading, and soft formation soil fails due to repetitive stress, leading to costly rail track maintenance. Using geosynthetics, track conditions {{can be improved}} and maintenance costs can be reduced. This paper addresses the potential use of geosynthetics for improving the deformation characteristics of rail ballast and formation soil. The prospective use {{of different types of}} geosynthetics was investigated using a large-scale prismoidal triaxial rig, and a plane strain finite element analysis (PLAXIS) of the rig was carried out to obtain the optimum location of geosynthetics in rail track substructure. A large-scale consolidometer was also employed to determine the effect of prefabricated vertical drains (PVDs) in optimising the accelerated primary consolidation of track soft formation. This paper also includes a section where recommendations are made on how to prepare the stability of rail tracks on surface formation soils considerably disturbed/remoulded by the Asian tsunami in Sri Lanka. The research findings reveal that geosynthetics have a good potential for resilient track construction and for reducing the cost of track maintenance...|$|R
40|$|Railway ballast deforms and degrades {{progressively}} {{under heavy}} <b>train</b> (<b>cyclic)</b> loading. Ballast degradation {{is influenced by}} several factors including the amplitude and number of load cycles, density of aggregates, track confining pressure, angularity, and most importantly, the fracture strength of individual grains. The degraded ballast is usually cleaned on track, otherwise fully or partially replaced by fresh ballast, depending on the track settlement and current density. The disposed waste ballast may be cleaned, sieved and re-used in the track. However, due to the breakage of the sharp edges {{and the development of}} micro-cracks during the previous loading cycles, recycled ballast is generally subject to excessive settlement and particle breakage. Therefore, the settlement and degradation aspects of recycled ballast must be carefully examined before recycling to the track. This paper investigates the deformation and degrada tion characteristics of recycled ballast under field-simulated loading conditions. Cyclic triaxial tests were conducted on both fresh and recycled ballast. The potential of recycled ballast as an alternative track construction material has been examined using geosynthetic technology, and the results are discussed in detail...|$|R
