40|$|Chicory (Cichorium intybus L.) seed {{production}} includes sorting to remove foreign materials and non-viable seeds. A machine vision system {{was developed to}} monitor the fluorescence in order to detect the immature chicory seeds. It comprised a monochromatic light source, a highpass filter and a monochromatic CCD camera sensitive to red and infrared. With this device, blue light reflected by the seeds was blocked whilst red fluorescence {{was measured by the}} camera. A segmentation algorithm was designed to estimate separately the fluorescence intensities of the pappus, a crown of scales, and {{the main body of the}} pericarp. Experiments were carried out on five clones of cross-pollinated chicory plants used for {{seed production}}. Two hundred flower heads were labelled at flowering and harvested at different times during the maturation process expressed in "days after flowering " (DAF). Germination tests were performed according to the recommendations of the International Seed Testing Association to measure the germination percentage (GP) and the germination rate (GR), an indicator of seed vigour. Seed chlorophyll content diminished during maturation following a different logistic trend for the pappus and the pericarp. The GP increased from 18 DAF to reach its maximum value at 21 DAF, but the GR remained low until 30 DAF and increased afterwards. The potential of chlorophyll fluorescence to be used as an indicator of <b>chicory</b> <b>seed</b> vigour was the greatest between 21 and 36 DAF.

40|$|An {{opto-electronic}} {{sensor system}} for measuring seed spacing uniformity with {{different types of}} seeds is described in this paper. It consisted of a rectangular photogate block (124 × 92 mm) with 24 phototransistors (diameter, 3 mm) receiving light beams from 24 light emitting diodes (diameter, 3 mm) opposite them, a digital input/output board in a personal computer, and power supplies. The opto-electronic system was tested by comparing seed spacing measurements obtained from the opto-electronic system with measurements of the same seed spacings obtained from a grease belt test stand. The tests were conducted with different types of seeds including regular-pelleted (diameter, 3. 8 – 4. 5 mm), mini-pelleted (diameter, 3. 2 – 4. 0 mm), and medium- encrusted sugar beet seeds (3. 2 - 3. 6 mm in diameter by 1. 8 – 2. 6 mm in thickness), and pelleted <b>chicory</b> <b>seeds</b> (diameter, 2. 8 – 3. 3 mm). Results showed that the adjusted opto-electronic seed spacings {{were not significantly different}} from the same seed spacings measured with the grease belt test stand. The opto-electronic sensor system worked well to obtain 508 seed spacings with regular-pelleted and mini-pelleted sugarbeet <b>seeds</b> and pelleted <b>chicory</b> <b>seeds.</b> The opto-electronic sensor system missed two seeds and detected two “phantom” seeds out of 170 seed spacings with the medium-encrusted sugarbeet seed...|$|R
40|$|Study of the {{potentialities}} {{of machine}} vision used for optical selection of immature <b>seeds</b> of industrial <b>chicory</b> (Cichorium intybus L.). The commercial production of industrial <b>chicory</b> <b>seeds</b> (cypselae) includes the postharvest elimination of non-viable seeds by non-destructive tools. For this purpose, two machine vision methods are described {{for the detection of}} non-viable seeds: color vision and fluorescence imaging. The analysis of color images of 1, 500 seeds of the 'Nausica' variety allows only the recognition of desiccated and undeveloped seeds. This is caused by the large variability of seed color, shape and texture. Fluorescence imaging is set up in order to analyze the repartition of chlorophyll fluorescence, a marker of seed maturity, on different areas of the seed (pericarp, radicle tip and pappus). A very sensitive system is needed due to the low chlorophyll content and the large amount of seeds to be sorted. A fluorescence imaging system is proposed. Its distinctive feature is the possibility to modify the spectrum of the light source (in order to optimize the sensibility of the machine vision system) and to record the evolution of fluorescence repartition with time. The system is functional and delivers images of fluorescence repartition within external cypsela tissues. It could allow to analyze the fluorescence of a large sample of seeds to correlate fluorescence features to germinability and maturity...|$|R

40|$|Witloof <b>chicory</b> <b>seeds</b> (Cichorium intybus L. var. foliosum cv. Flash) were sown in acid-washed {{vermiculite}} in {{a controlled}} environment growth chamber. Plants received a nitrogen poor ("N-poor": 0. 2 mM NH 4 NO 3) but otherwise complete medium, or a nitrogen rich ("N-rich": 2 mM NH 4 NO 3) medium. After 1 month of growth the fructan concentration in the "N-poor" plants was about five times higher and also the activity of sucrose:sucrose 1 -fructosyl transferase (1 -SST; EC 2. 4. 1. 99) was {{twice as high as}} in "N-rich" plants. The activities of the catabolic enzymes fructan 1 -exohydrolase (1 -FEH; EC 3. 2. 1. 80) and acid invertase (EC 3. 2. 1. 26) were higher in the "N-rich" plants where significant energy was invested in root and leaf growth. After one month of growth, part of the "N-poor" plants were switched to the "N-rich" medium. One day after this switch, a sharp decrease in sucrose and glucose concentration was observed in the roots. During the following days, both the activities of 1 -SST and fructan:fructan 1 -fructosyl transferase (1 -FFT; EC 2. 4. 1. 100) decreased and the 1 -FEH and invertase activities increased. These changes were correlated with a decrease in fructan concentration. Ten days after the switch, glucose and sucrose concentrations increased again and fructan synthesis resumed. During this period 1 -SST activity increased and 1 -FEH activity decreased. Apparently 1 -SST, 1 -FFT and 1 -FEH simultaneously control fructan in young chicory roots. The rather unexpected finding that 1 -FEH activity, which was believed to occur only in older material, can be induced in very young roots indicates that this enzyme can be induced at any physiological stage. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|The {{commercial}} production of industrial <b>chicory</b> <b>seeds</b> (cypselae) includes the postharvest elimination of nonviable seeds by non-destructive tools. For this purpose, two machine vision methods {{were set up}} for the detection of nonviable seeds: color vision and fluorescence imaging. In addition, the appropriate criteria to estimate the efficiency of seed sorting were defined using a sorting optimization curve which describe the trade-off between the quality improvement of a seed lot and the loss of material. The analysis of color images of 1, 500 seeds of the ‘Nausica’ variety allows only the recognition of desiccated and undeveloped seeds. This is caused by the large natural variability of seed color, shape and texture. Fluorescence imaging was set up in order to analyze the repartition of chlorophyll fluorescence (CF), a marker of seed maturity, on different areas of the seed (pericarp and pappus). It comprised a monochromatic light source, a highpass filter and a monochromatic CCD camera sensitive to red and infrared. With this device, blue light reflected by the seeds was blocked whilst red fluorescence was measured by the camera. A segmentation algorithm was designed to estimate separately the fluorescence intensities of the pappus, a crown of scales, and {{the main body of the}} pericarp. Experiments were carried out on five clones of cross-pollinated chicory plants used for seed production and four series of 30 plants from 2 common varieties grown in different weather conditions. The flower heads were labelled at flowering and harvested at different times during the maturation process expressed in "days after flowering" (DAF). Germination tests were performed according to the recommendations of the International Seed Testing Association to measure the germination percentage (GP) and the germination rate (GR), an indicator of seed vigour. The dry weight (DW), water content (WC), maturation duration, germination percentage (GP), and germination rate (GR) were measured to estimate seed quality. For all experiments, the chlorophyll fluorescence diminished mainly between 16 and 33 DAF during the filling phase of seed development. The correlations between CF and maturity parameters (DW, WC) were comprised between 0. 25 and 0. 75 in absolute value for seeds that matured 16 to 44 days on the stalk. Sorting simulations were made on the basis of CF alone or in combination with the achene area density (AD) (mg/mm²). The CF was efficient to select seeds produced outdoor or in the greenhouse with the aim of increasing GP or GR but AD was an even better sorting feature. In the greenhouse, where developing seeds were submitted to temperatures higher than 25 °C, the use of CF in combination with AD improved the sorting efficiency...|$|R
40|$|The {{chemical}} {{composition of the}} ethanol extracts of <b>chicory</b> root, peel, <b>seed</b> and leaf has been determined, in particular their inulin and phenolic fractions. The root and peel extracts were characterized by large mass fractions of inulin (60. 1 and 46. 8 g per 100 g of fresh mass, respectively), predominantly with degree of polymerization {{in the range from}} 3 to 10, while phenolics, determined as caffeoylquinic acids, made up 0. 5 and 1. 7 g per 100 g of fresh mass, respectively. The leaf and seed extracts had decidedly lower mass frac-tions of inulin (1. 7 and 3. 2 g per 100 g of fresh mass, respectively) and higher mass frac-tions of phenolics (9. 6 and 4. 22 g per 100 g of fresh mass, respectively) recognized as caffeoylquinic acids, chicoric acid and quercetin glucuronide. The biological properties of a non-inulin fraction from each extract were determined on Wistar rats fed with diets rich in fructose and saturated fat, as a model of metabolic changes related to westernization of human eating habits. The diets contained the same amount of inulin (6 %) with various phenolic fractions. Some changes were noted in the microbial enzymatic activity of the caecum after feeding for 4 weeks with the diet containing the highest mass fraction of phenolics (0. 208 %), derived from the mixture of peel and seed extracts (decreased activit...|$|R
40|$|O objetivo do trabalho foi avaliar a produtividade e a renda bruta da cebolinha e do almeirão, obtidas com o cultivo solteiro e consorciado, com três e quatro linhas por canteiro, visando oferecer aos produtores uma alternativa de manejo mais eficaz para essas culturas, que possa ser mais sustentável e mais rentável. A propagação da cebolinha foi por mudas e a do almeirão por sementes. A colheita foi feita aos 90 dias após o plantio/semeadura, cortando-se as plantas rente ao solo. A média de altura das plantas da cebolinha (28, 4 cm) e do almeirão (32, 1 cm), o número médio de perfilhos da cebolinha (0, 49 milhões ha- 1) e as produções médias de fitomassas fresca e seca da cebolinha (2, 46 t há- 1 e 0, 22 t há- 1, respectivamente) e do almeirão (10, 21 t há,sup>- 1 e 0, 96 t há- 1, respectivamente) não foram influenciadas, significativamente, pelo número de linhas de plantas por canteiro. Na altura da cebolinha, o consórcio induziu ao aumento de 9, 8 cm, em relação ao cultivo solteiro. O número de folhas do almeirão foi maior com três linhas, no cultivo solteiro, e com quatro linhas no consórcio. As razões de área equivalente (RAE), considerando as produtividades de fitomassa fresca das espécies, cultivadas sob os respectivos números de fileiras, foram de 1, 93 para cebolinha sob três linhas e almeirão sob quatro linhas (C 3 Al 4) e de 1, 59 para cebolinha sob quatro linhas e almeirão sob três linhas (C 4 Al 3). Nas condições em que foi conduzido o trabalho, a maior renda bruta para o produtor foi com o consórcio C 3 Al 4, por ter resultado em incrementos monetários de R$ 13. 919, 70 há- 1 e de R$ 7. 068, 15 há- 1 em relação à cebolinha (3 linhas) e ao almeirão (4 linhas), sob cultivos solteirosThe aim of {{this work}} was to {{evaluate}} yield and gross income of bunching onion and chicory obtained from mono-cropping and inter-cropping system, with three and four rows per plot, in order to offer the producer a more efficient management alternative for those cultures, which can be more sustainable and more profitable. The bunching onion propagation was through cuttings and the <b>chicory's</b> through <b>seeds.</b> Harvest was done at 90 days after planting/sowing, when the plants were cut very near the soil. The average height of bunching onion plants was 28. 4 cm and 32. 1 cm for chicory, the bunching onion average number of shoots 0. 49 millions ha- 1 and the average yield of bunching onion fresh and dried phyto-masses 2. 46 t ha- 1 and 0. 22 t ha- 1, respectively; chicory's (10. 21 t ha- 1 and 0. 96 t ha- 1, respectively) were not influenced significantly {{by the number of}} plant rows by plot. The inter-cropping system induced an increase of 9. 8 cm in bunching onion height when compared to mono-cropping system. The greatest number of chicory leaves was with three rows in mono-cropping system and with four rows in inter-cropping system. Land Equivalent Ratio (LER), considering fresh phyto-mass yields of those species cultivated under respective number of rows were 1. 93 for bunching onion under three rows and chicory under four rows (C 3 Al 4) and of 1. 59 for bunching onion under four rows and chicory under three rows (C 4 Al 3). Under the conditions in which the work was carried out, the greatest gross income to the producer was with C 3 Al 4 inter-cropping system, because it resulted in monetary increases of R$ 13, 919. 70 and of R$ 7. 068, 15 when compared to bunching onion (3 rows) and to chicory (4 rows), respectively, under mono-cropping system...|$|R
