"Go Big or Go Home" [...] was {{the first}} {{original}} episode since [...] "Freddy Spaghetti" [...] in May 2010, and executive producer Michael Schur said while he believed it was a strong episode, there were fears the hiatus would hurt {{the momentum of the}} series: [...] "Of course, any time you're not on the air, {{you run the risk of}} people forgetting about you; that's the sad thing about the mid-season show." [...] The week of the third season premiere, Amy Poehler said of the hiatus, [...] "It was an NBC decision and <b>certainly</b> <b>we</b> were confused. But I think, weirdly, there's a momentum that comes from people waiting for us, which is nice." [...] Poehler also said the long hiatus made an ironic sort of sense for the script, since at the beginning the characters have [...] "taken too much time off and we've all gone a little crazy". While Parks and Recreation previously aired on 8:30 p.m. EST on Thursdays, [...] "Go Big or Go Home" [...] marked the first episode in a new 9:30 p.m. Thursday time-slot between the two popular shows The Office and 30 Rock. Poehler said of the time-slot, [...] "'The Office' is such an amazing show and to be behind it is an honor." [...] In anticipation of new viewers due to the Office lead-in, [...] "Go Big and Go Home" [...] included an introductory sequence describing the previous events of the series.|$|E
500|$|However, NBC {{eventually}} {{opted not}} to put the show on the fall schedule, and instead delayed the premiere of the third season {{until the beginning of}} 2011. This allowed for the network to run its new comedy, Outsourced, in two-hour comedy schedule block rather than Parks and Recreation. The schedule change meant that all sixteen episodes from the third season would be filmed before any of them were shown; the rest of the episodes, starting with the seventh, were filmed in the fall of 2010. [...] NBC chief executive officer Jeff Gaspin said this move was not a reflection on Parks and Recreation, and suggested the extended hiatus would not only have no negative effect on the show, but could actually build anticipation for its return. Series co-creator Michael Schur said the schedule changes were frustrating, but said: [...] "It sounds a little corny, maybe even a little community theater-ish, but when we got the bad news our thinking was to just put our heads down and keep making the best show we could." [...] Amy Poehler said of the hiatus, [...] "It was an NBC decision and <b>certainly</b> <b>we</b> were confused. But I think, weirdly, there's a momentum that comes from people waiting for us, which is nice." [...] Poehler also said it gave them the luxury of time to go back and reedit episodes or shoot and add new material.|$|E
2500|$|Yallop {{later said}} he had [...] "mixed emotions" [...] about the tour. [...] "Knowing now {{what it was like}} there, there were certain things they kept from us, certain things we weren't meant to see but did. But {{hindsight}} is a wonderful thing, isn't it? <b>Certainly</b> <b>we</b> enjoyed it while we were there. But reflecting on it, there's mixed emotions. Disappointing thing, politics." ...|$|E

We were more relaxed than we've ever been, more willing and able to be more experimental in the studios, and we took it easy and relaxed. <b>Certainly</b> <b>we</b> felt we had a good product in the making, so it seemed right to put everything we had into it." ...|$|E
2500|$|On July 14, 2010, Ramsey {{said that}} {{states would have}} to deal with {{attempts}} to bring Sharia law to the U.S.: [...] "But you cross the line when they start trying to bring Sharia law into the United States. Now, you could even argue whether being a Muslim is actually a religion, or is it a nationality, way of life, cult, {{whatever you want to call}} it. Now <b>certainly</b> <b>we</b> do protect our religions, but at the same time this is something we are going to have to face." ...|$|E
2500|$|All in Good Time was {{generally}} well {{received by the}} critics. The band toured the United States and Canada {{during the summer of}} 2010, with a leg in the United Kingdom in the fall. When asked about Page's departure, Tyler Stewart said [...] "We don't keep in touch, but we <b>certainly</b> <b>we</b> [...] wish him the best and there's good will there." [...] In October 2010, Page stated that {{he has no plans to}} rejoin the band in the near future, other than a possible one-off performance. He added that it felt strange the band continued to use the same name and perform the songs that he wrote and performed.|$|E

2500|$|Before reciting kiddush, the challah, {{which will}} be the next food item eaten in honor of the Shabbat or holiday, is first covered with a cloth. According to Halakha, the blessing over bread takes {{precedence}} to the blessing over wine. However, in the interests of beginning the meal with kiddush, the challah is covered to [...] "remove" [...] it from the table (some do not have the challah on the table at all during kiddush). Some interpret the covering of the challah allegorically, explaining that if we are supposed to go out of our way to protect even an inanimate object (the bread) from being [...] "insulted" [...] (by the blessing over wine taking precedence), then <b>certainly</b> <b>we</b> must go out of our way to display sensitivity toward the feelings of other people.|$|E
2500|$|Iraq's {{invasion}} of Iran in September 1980 {{was preceded by}} {{a long period of}} tension between the two countries throughout 1979 and 1980, including frequent border skirmishes, calls by Iranian leader Ruhollah Khomeini for the Shia of Iraq to revolt against the Ba'ath Party, and allegations of Iraqi support for ethnic separatists in Iran. On June 18, 1979, U.S. chargé d'affaires Charlie Naas asked Yazdi about the deterioration in relations; Yazdi stated he [...] "does not know what might be bothering Iraq... <b>certainly</b> <b>we</b> have done nothing to bother them." [...] Khomeini had recently condemned Iraq's arrest of Shi'ite leader Muhammad Baqir al-Sadr, but Yazdi claimed this {{had nothing to do with}} any effort to export the Islamic Revolution to Iraq: Iran was merely concerned with protecting the [...] "religious centers in Najaf and Karbala." [...] Nevertheless, in a subsequent conversation between Naas and Entezam it emerged that the latter was unaware of the anti-Iraq broadcasts [...] "Sadegh Ghotbzadeh was sanctioning in his role as managing director of National Iranian Radio and Television." [...] Continuing to seek good relations with Iranian authorities, U.S. officials uncovered considerable evidence of Iraqi support for Kurdish rebels in Iran under the leadership of Jalal Talabani (Fatah contacts told the CIA's Beirut station that [...] "Saddam Hussein himself was directly involved in supervising these operations"); while these rebels were not considered capable of overthrowing the Iranian government militarily, they were undermining Iranian moderates, prompting Precht to broach the possibility of meeting with Iraqi officials to persuade them that Iraq's support for the Kurds was not in its best interest. Throughout this time, Iraq's intentions toward Iran were not entirely clear, as [...] "the Iraqi government was continuing to put out diplomatic feelers, unsuccessfully inviting a delegation led by Bazargan to visit Iraq in July 1979," [...] while the CIA concluded in November (despite Cave's warning the previous month) that Iraq intended [...] "to settle its differences with Iran through negotiations." [...] Muhammed Dosky, [...] "a Kurdistan Democratic Party representative in Washington," [...] also believed [...] "Iraq's overriding goal was to persuade the new government in Tehran to live up to the conditions of the Algiers Accord... Iraq was using Kurdish groups not out of a sense of opportunism, or as a prelude to the coming conflict, but in order to consolidate agreements made with the Shah." [...] Saddam was willing to work with Iranian moderates such as Yazdi, whom he met in Havana in October, but [...] "the mass resignation of the Bazargan government" [...] following the November 4th seizure of the U.S. embassy and initiation of the Iran hostage crisis—and the resulting consolidation of power under Khomeini—"would profoundly change Saddam's decision-making calculus." [...] While the Iraqi archives suggest that Saddam contemplated invading Iran as early as February 1979, he was deterred from doing so until July 1980, at which point [...] "purges and revolutionary chaos" [...] had rendered Iran grossly unprepared for the attack.|$|E
