500|$|In 1925, the spectre of {{deportation}} loomed again, but a Scottish anarchist named James Colton {{offered to}} marry her and provide British citizenship. Although they were only distant acquaintances, she accepted and they were married on June 27, 1925. Her new status gave her peace of mind, and allowed her to travel to France and Canada. Life in London was stressful for Goldman; she wrote to Berkman: [...] "I am awfully tired and so lonely and heartsick. It is a dreadful feeling to <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>here</b> from lectures and find not a kindred soul, no one who cares whether one is dead or alive." [...] She worked on analytical studies of drama, expanding on the work she had published in 1914. But the audiences were [...] "awful," [...] and she never finished her second book on the subject.|$|E
500|$|Arsenal contested {{the final}} against Chelsea on 4 May 2002. Wenger {{recalled}} Seaman in goal {{from the previous}} fixture, in place of Wright while Campbell was paired up with Adams in central defence. For Chelsea, Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink and Graeme Le Saux passed late fitness tests and were named in the first team; John Terry filled the substitutes bench, having woken up with a virus. Chelsea threatened early with goal efforts from Le Saux and midfielder Frank Lampard, before Bergkamp fashioned the first real chance of the match – he headed the ball over the top, which caught goalkeeper Carlo Cudicini off his line. In the 70th minute Arsenal took the lead: Adams found Wiltord in space, who in turn passed the ball towards Parlour – he kicked [...] "from just beyond the arc", which flew into the top right corner. Ten minutes after, Ljungberg increased the lead, running from the half-way line and shrung off a late challenge by Terry to curl the ball past Cudicini. The win meant Arsenal completed one half of an expected double; Wenger {{was pleased with the}} team's performance, adding: [...] "We were very frustrated last year. We have shown a lot of strength to <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>here</b> – beating Liverpool and Newcastle on the way." ...|$|E

500|$|Wenger praised his team's {{character}} and told reporters: [...] "We were very frustrated last year. We {{have shown a}} lot of strength to <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>here</b> – beating Liverpool and Newcastle on the way." [...] He was adamant Arsenal would win the league the following Wednesday: [...] "This team knows how to win. I said {{three or four months}} ago that we will win the championship and the FA Cup. They really want to do it. And we will do it." [...] The goalscorers Parlour and Ljungberg both agreed winning at any cost was most important on the day, after the misery of the 2001 final. Ranieri described the first half as tactical, but admitted once Arsenal had scored, Chelsea struggled to make a comeback. He justified his decision to include Hasselbaink, saying [...] "He is a great striker and a danger to the opposition." [...] Lampard credited Arsenal's mental strength: [...] "They can win when they are not playing particularly well. We need to find that consistency and if we can do that, I believe we will be up there with them soon." [...] He was pleased with his own performance against Vieira and hoped he did enough to be included in England's World Cup squad.|$|E
2500|$|Brad Keselowski staved off a green-white-checker charge by Kyle Busch to win. [...] "I {{think it}} is {{definitely}} good for when we <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>here</b> in September but past success doesn't guarantee future success," [...] he said. [...] "We have to keep working and plugging away. I am {{sure a lot of}} guys will be stronger and hopefully we will be too." ...|$|E
2500|$|On February 13, 2012, his 35th birthday, Moss {{announced}} that he was coming out of retirement and was ready to play again. In a live video chat with his fans via Ustream, Moss stated, [...] "I wanna play football. Your boy is going to <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>here</b> and play some football, so I'm really excited. I had some things I had to adjust in my life." ...|$|E

2500|$|Connally's party bolt left a sour {{taste in}} the mouth of at least one {{prominent}} Texas Democrat who stood with George McGovern in 1972: Bob Bullock, the Hillsboro native who served as Texas secretary of state, comptroller and lieutenant governor: [...] "...I got some ideas on Mr. Connally. He ain't never done nothin' but get shot in Dallas. He got the silver bullet. He needs to <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>here</b> and get hisself [...] shot once every six months. I attack Connally on his vanity. He's terribly bad [...] vain, y'know..." ...|$|E
2500|$|But on 1 November 1886, in a laconic communication, Verdi {{was able}} to proclaim: [...] "DEAR BOITO, It is finished! All honour to us! [...] (and to Him!!). Farewell. G. VERDI".(sic) This left only a few minor tweaks to be done, with Boito {{providing}} two more lines in December and Verdi writing {{to him on the}} 18th saying [...] "I have just consigned to [...] the last acts of Otello! Poor Othello!...He won't <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>here</b> any more!!!" [...] The librettist replied: [...] "The Moor will come back no more to knock {{on the door of the}} Palazzo Doria , but you will go to meet the Moor at La Scala. Otello exists. The great dream has become reality".|$|E
2500|$|O'Neal {{was given}} jersey #6 for the Raptors since his number with the Pacers (#7) was already owned by Andrea Bargnani. While he was {{expected}} to combine with Toronto's three-time All-Star Chris Bosh to form a strong frontcourt and provide greater rebounding and interior defense for the Raptors, O'Neal's arrival was dwarfed by the Elton Brand signing pulled off by division rivals Philadelphia. O'Neal wasted no time in imposing his style on his new team: in the season opener at Philadelphia, he pointed to hecklers in the home crowd after making a dunk; in the team's second game, Toronto's center blocked a dunk from Golden State's Brandan Wright and thereafter waved a finger, as though to say [...] "Don't <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>here</b> again." [...] Even so, it took O'Neal some time to find his offensive game: he reached the 20-point mark just twice in his first 23 games, before notching three straight thereafter. By the All-Star break, injuries had ruled the big man out for almost a quarter of Toronto's games, while Bargnani regained his starting spot with a streak of solid performances. This, coupled with the Raptors entering the break placed 14th in the conference and 13 games under [...]500, Toronto General Manager Bryan Colangelo looked to move O'Neal to bring in a wing player and free up the salary space.|$|E
6000|$|Rob nervously tried again, tearing {{splinters}} {{from the}} fence. [...] "Say, now, I'll tell yeh what I <b>came</b> <b>back</b> <b>here</b> fer t' git married; and if you're willin', I'll do it tonight. Come, now, whaddy y' say?" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Then," [...] said Jordan gravely, [...] "I'm {{not sure}} I'm much obliged to him. But before I go there's {{something}} I want to ask: {{would it be}} a liberty if I <b>came</b> <b>back</b> <b>here</b> with him some day?" ...|$|R
