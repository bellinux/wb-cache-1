40|$|Calculations {{were made}} to {{determine}} the influence of changes in temperature distribution and in elastic material properties on calculated elastic stresses for a typical gas-turbine disk. Severe temperature gradients caused thermal stresses of sufficient magnitude to reduce the operating safety of the disk. Small temperature gradients were found to be desirable because they produced thermal stresses that subtracted from the <b>centrifugal</b> <b>stresses</b> in the region of the rim. The thermal gradients produced a tendency for a severe stress condition to exist near the rim but this stress condition could be shifted away from the region of blade attachment by altering the temperature distribution. The investigation of elastic material properties showed that <b>centrifugal</b> <b>stresses</b> are slightly affected by changes in modulus of elasticity, but that thermal stresses are approximately proportional to modulus of elasticity and to coefficient of thermal expansion...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to present a method of {{material}} design for the weight reduction, the high thermal radiation and the relaxation of in-plane thermal stress and <b>centrifugal</b> <b>stress</b> in a rotating disk without hole composed of functionally graded material (FGM) with arbitrary thermal and mechanical nonhomogeneities in the radial direction. The disk is subjected to an intermittent heating in an annular region near the outer radius and has an arbitrary variation of heat-transfer coefficient along the radial position on the upper and lower surfaces. The transient temperature field is analyzed by modifying Vodicka 2 ̆ 7 s method for one-dimensional boundary value problems in composite regions and the thermal stress and <b>centrifugal</b> <b>stress</b> are respectively obtained by solving approximately the equilibrium equations expressed in terms of the displacement component.

40|$|The {{problem of}} {{structural}} optimization of helicopter rotor blades with integrated dynamic and aerodynamic design considerations is addressed. Results of recent optimization work on rotor blades for minimum weight with constraints on multiple coupled natural flap-lag frequencies, blade autorotational inertia and <b>centrifugal</b> <b>stress</b> has been reviewed. A {{strategy has been}} defined for the ongoing activities in the integrated dynamic/aerodynamic optimization of rotor blades. As a first step, the integrated dynamic/airload optimization problem has been formulated. To calculate system sensitivity derivatives necessary for the optimization recently developed, Global Sensitivity Equations (GSE) are being investigated. A need for multiple objective functions for the integrated optimization problem has been demonstrated and various techniques for solving the multiple objective function optimization are being investigated. The method called the Global Criteria Approach {{has been applied to}} a test problem with the blade in vacuum and the blade weight and the <b>centrifugal</b> <b>stress</b> as the multiple objectives.

40|$|Dunaliella salina accumulates {{large amounts}} of {{intracellular}} glycerol {{in response to the}} increases in salt concentration, thus is a potential source for producing fuel grade glycerol as an alternative to biodiesel-derived crude glycerol. D. salina lacks a cell wall; therefore the mode of harvesting Dunaliella cells is critical to avoid cell disruption caused by extreme engineering conditions. This study explored cell disruption and glycerol leakage of D. salina under various <b>centrifugal</b> <b>stresses</b> during cell harvesting. Results show a centrifugal g-force lower than 5000 g caused little cell disruption, while a g-force higher than 9000 g led to ~ 40 % loss of the intact cells and glycerol yields from the recovered algal pellets.

40|$|Engine {{performance}} {{is better for}} constant outer-spool mechanical-speed operation than for constant inner-spool mechanical-speed operation {{over most of the}} flight range considered. Combustor and afterburner frontal areas are about the same for the two modes. Engine performance for a mode characterized by a constant outer-spool equivalent speed over part of the flight range and a constant outer-spool mechanical speed over the rest of the flight range is better that that for constant outer-spool mechanical speed operation.

5000|$|Another problem arises {{because the}} {{majority}} of the mass of the rotating mechanism is at the periphery rather than at the hub, as it is with a propeller. This leads to very high <b>centrifugal</b> <b>stresses</b> on the mechanism, which must be stronger and heavier than otherwise to withstand them. One common approach to minimise this is to curve the wings into an [...] "egg-beater" [...] shape (this is called a [...] "troposkein" [...] shape, derived from the Greek for [...] "the shape of a spun rope") such that they are self-supporting and do not require such heavy supports and mountings.

50|$|Alternatively, {{adding a}} zero (i.e. front) stage to the compressor, to {{increase}} overall pressure ratio, will require {{an increase in}} shaft speed (to maintain the same blade tip Mach number {{on each of the}} original compressor stages, since the delivery temperature of each of these stages will be higher than datum). The increase in shaft speed raises the <b>centrifugal</b> <b>stresses</b> in both the turbine blade and disc. This together with increases in the hot gas and cooling air(from the compressor) temperatures implies a decrease in component lives and/or an upgrade in component materials. Adding a zero stage also induces more airflow into the engine, thereby increasing net thrust.|$|R
40|$|The {{aerodynamic}} {{design of}} propellers from considerations of centrifugal force is presented. A solution is {{obtained for the}} spanwise distribution of cross-sectional area required to attain constant <b>centrifugal</b> <b>stress</b> {{over most of the}} blade. By applying a constant minimum value of thickness ■"• ratio from root to tip and allowing the distribution of required area to appear in the blade plan form, propellers with good efficiency are realized at high Mach numbers by the method of this paper. Considerations of <b>centrifugal</b> <b>stress</b> show that the blade power-absorbing ability is seriously reduced with increasing flight Mach number. Increasing the design advance ratio is seen to cause a decrease in pro-peller efficiency and power absorption in the Mach'number range from 1. 2 to 2. 4. From a comparison of two propellers at a Mach number of " 0. 9. and an ', advance ratio of 2. 0, both having the same allowable design stress and differing only {{in the manner in which}} the required area variation. was applied, the blade having a constant minimum thickness ratio of 2 percent was found to be 7 percent more efficient than a rectangular propeller having the required area variation applied to thickness ratio with the minimum thickness ratio of 2 percent applied at the tip. • &apos...|$|E

Criticism, Frye explains, is essentially centripetal when it moves inwardly, towards {{the structure of a}} text; it is centrifugal when it moves outwardly, away from the text and towards society and the outer world. Lyric poetry, for instance, like Keats's [...] "Ode on a Grecian Urn", is dominantly centripetal, stressing the sound and movement and imagery of the ordered words. Rhetorical novels, like Uncle Tom's Cabin, are dominantly <b>centrifugal,</b> <b>stressing</b> the thematic connection of the stories and characters to the social order.

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{describes}} {{the development of}} a microgasturbine with a rotor diameter of 20 mm. The target electrical power output lies around 1 kW. The total system fits in a cylinder with a diameter of 95 mm and a length of 120 mm. The system contains the same components as a large gasturbine generator: compressor, recuperator, combustion chamber, turbine, and electrical generator. Major challenges are the high rotational speed (500 000 r/min), high turbine inlet temperature (1200 K), and the efficiencyof the components. Becauseof the small dimensions, theflow through compressor and turbine is characterized by relatively low Reynolds numbers. The higher flow losses and inherently lower efficiency require a higher blade tip speed (524 m/s) than for large turbines (300 – 400 m/s). To minimize wear and frictional losses, the rotor is mounted on aerodynamic bearings. To withstand the high <b>centrifugal</b> <b>stresses,</b> a high-strength steel is used for compressor and shaft.
