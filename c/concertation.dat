40|$|This {{bachelor}} {{thesis is}} focused on study of selected effects on production of both polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA) and extracellular polysaccharides (EPS) by halophile Archae Haloferax mediterranei. Theoretical part deals with a brief characterization of biopolymers and provides overwiev of the relevant microbial producers. The experimental part {{is focused on}} selection of a suitable substrate, concentration of sodium chloride and glucose in culture medium for a optimal production of biopolymers. Effects of light and suitable cultivation temperature were studied as well. UV-VIS spectrophotometry and gravimetry were used for analysis of biomas content. The content of PHA was analysed by gas chromatography with FID detection. PHA produced by H. mediterranei is a copolymer P(3 HB-co- 3 HV), 3 HV content is about 10 %. The mixture of glucose and glycerol {{proved to be the}} most suitable substrate for a production of PHA, with a content od 80, 6 % of PHA. Further, we investigated optimal concetration of NaCl, which was found at 200 g/l. Interestingly, microbial culture responded to various salt <b>concertations</b> by differences in pigment formation. Finally, the last parameter optimalized in this work was temperature of cultivation. The highest content of PHA was obtained at 37 °C, but the culture was capable of PHA accumulation and growing also at 50 °C...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: The aim of {{the study}} was to {{evaluate}} the diagnostic performance, the prognosis factors and the therapeutic impact of 18 F-FDG positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) in the detection of recurrent colorectal cancers. Methods: Sixty PET/CT with 18 F-FDG and CT were performed in 52 patients, at the Paul Papin cancer center between 2003 and 2005, following suspicion of colorectal cancer relapse. The FDG-PET impact on the clinical management was studied by examination of multidisciplinary <b>concertations</b> results. Survival analysis were realized with a mean follow up of 2. 2 Â years. Results: Recurrence was confirmed for 50 explorations by histologic (n = 32), radiologic (n = 14) or clinical (n = 4) findings. Twenty patients died during the time of the study. On a patient based analysis, FDG-PET sensitivity, specificity and overall accuracy were 90, 90, 90 % respectively compared with 74, 50 and 70 % for CT. FDG-PET changed the clinical management in 18 cases (30 %). A positive FDG-PET signal, more than one hepatic lesion, more than two lymph node lesions detected on FDG-PET and more than two hepatic lesions on CT were characterized as bad prognostic factors for survival. Multivariate analysis showed that the only independent bad prognostic factor was the FDG-PET detection of more than two liver lesions. Conclusion: These results confirmed the important impact of FDG-PET in the clinical management of patients with a suspected recurrence of colorectal cancer...|$|R

40|$|Acté en 1998, le Programme décennal de restauration {{hydraulique}} et écologique du Rhône s'est fixé comme objectif principal d'augmenter les débits réservés dans les bras court-circuités du fleuve. Cet objectif était initialement pensé comme une action de restauration écologique de milieux naturels fortement perturbés. Un processus concomitant de <b>concertations</b> a plusieurs fois déplacé l'intérêt initial vers des projets d'élaboration d'un territoire fluvial, puis d'un {{outil de}} gestion contre les crues. L'approche interdisciplinaire appliquée, entre sociologie et écologie, interroge la capacité d'une telle action environnementale à aboutir à des résultats hybrides, relevant à la fois de l'amélioration d'un écosystème fluvial et d'un processus de gouvernance. / A ten-year physical and ecological restoration programme was defined for the Rhone River in 1998. Initially, {{one of its}} main objectives was to increase the minimum flow in several by-passed sections, with the clear goal of improving the fluvial habitat and the general ecological functioning of the river. A complex consultation process which brought together the hydropower industry, regional civil organisations, and local civil representatives was adopted to define more precisely the local measures to be taken. In {{the course of this}} process, the programme underwent a progressive change from purely ecological to more socially motivated outcomes such as improving amenity values and flood defence. We studied how increasing the minimum flow is a topic that can or cannot be discussed by the actors during the consultation process. For example, there is less discussion about the ecological value than about the economic value of the restoration programme between the hydropower industry and the local elected members. But, the various actors readily debate with the scientists about floods and sedimentary transport, linked with local knowledge. We applied a multidisciplinary approach, involving sociology and ecological sciences, to question the restoration programme and to analyse its hybrid results in terms of both the ecological and amenity values {{and at the same time}} to understand the governance process...|$|R
40|$|Tidiani Diarra {{talked to}} Spore s Eyoum Ngangué about the {{metamorphosis}} of Malian farmers organisations. In {{less than half}} a century, they have evolved from a passive statal model to the dynamic bodies that have emerged since the withdrawal of the State. And he explains why farmers still need the State to play its part, if they are to improve their productivity and {{meet the needs of the}} market. What s the state of play with farmers organisations in Mali? Ever since independence, successive governments have sought to organise the rural community, given its demographic weight (80 % of the population). We first saw, from 1960 to 1968, a period of socialist policy with a centralising State: it was the State which pushed the setting up of cooperatives and farmer groups, without farmers having any real wish for this. The limits of this planned approach were soon to be seen. Then from 1968 to 1978, the military regime saw the need to strengthen the farmer groups and set up Rural Development Operations (ODR). Local people were urged to form village associations. They were a sort of pre-cooperative, with no real legal status, deemed to evolve into a cooperative model. Then from 1979 to 1991, the return to civilian rule with the same single party as before saw the establishment of farmers organisations. These so-called village tons (meaning grouping in Bambara and Malinké) were supposed to boost support activities for rural communities. They were based in the village, that s true enough, but their creation was infused with a planned and administrative mindset, imposed from top to bottom. They did not have the desired effect, even if at the local level the development of some economic infrastructure, with the collaboration of external partners, did help some areas to thrive. So was there any change in the way farmers were organised when democracy came in 1991 ? Democratisation ushered in a multitude of organisations, cooperatives and Economic Interest Groups (GIE) set up by the farmers themselves. Rural <b>concertations</b> were organised, and they insisted strongly on professional farmers organisations being endowed with the appropriate status of legal recognition and the capacity to obtain resources. It was after these events that the first master plan for the rural development sector was drawn up, in 1992; this enabled rural communities to engage in viable economic activities. One of the corollaries of the country s democratisation and liberalisation was the withdrawal of the State from certain sectors. In the area of agriculture, the State pulled out of production, processing, marketing and the supply of inputs to farmers. These traditional functions had to be transferred to the private sector and to farmers organisations. This explains the growth in capacity-building programmes with agricultural organisations over the past 10 to 15 years. But are they up to these responsibilities? Look, we only grasped the reality of market prices when the State withdrew, having previously subsidised practically every single chain of production. And when direct State funding was stopped, so too was access to credit. The private banks need guarantees, and farmers organisations do not have enough to be credible. As a result, their support organisations are unable to make any sustainable investments. We have seen measurable progress in intensified production in peri-urban areas and in the cotton sector, but most farmers have stayed stuck in relatively fragile systems of production. And so we have a situation today where farmers have the know-how and the will to improve their production and to be players in national, regional and world markets, but they lack the infrastructure and equipment to meet all the demands that these markets place on them. Do you think that the leaders of farmers organisations are becoming a new elite, getting rich at the expense of the farmer? Farmers today have a better reading of their situation. With the advent of democratisation, grassroots farmers participate in all the decisions that affect them. They have their own organisations and they can express themselves through them. A properly functioning farmers organisation provides services to its members and allows them to express their concerns. It organises its constitutional meetings and assemblies and it operates democratically. On the other hand, when an organisation is not functioning properly, then there is indeed a loss of confidence between it and the farmer. And, let me be clear, in our young democracies there will always be some departures from the norm. But these leadership problems fade into the background against the aspirations of the farmers of Mali. They want to see their opinions on such issues as savings or globalisation taken into account and defended Their representatives now know full well how to get their wishes noticed in international fora. And all this when, let s face it, the farmers of Mali are not playing on a level playing field: in their country, the State was forced to withdraw, whereas in the countries of the North, the State continues to subsidise its agriculture!
