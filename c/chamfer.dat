25|$|The present roof, {{replaced}} in the 1950s is constructed internally of massive tie-beams and a plastered ceiling, though the original {{was most likely}} a principal rafter roof {{similar to that of}} the third Bruton Parish Church. The roof beams are decorated with <b>chamfer</b> and lamb's tongue moldings. The present slate shingles are, of course, not the original roofing material which most likely was cedar shingles or clapboards painted or covered with tar.|$|E

40|$|Generally the {{end mill}} of a <b>chamfering</b> machine {{has been used}} for <b>chamfering</b> the teeth of a gear. 　In the {{previous}} experiment on a rolling gear, a V-grooved collar was used to prevent the sides of the teeth from swelling. 　Now in one of these experiment, the teeth were almost made with a rolling die and the V-grooved collar, when a <b>chamfering</b> die was used in place of the collar so as to generate the part of the teeth to be <b>chamfered</b> in this way, generating and <b>chamfering</b> could be done at the same time. In the orther experiment, the tooth face of a gear, which had been cut roughly with a gear shaper, were finished with a rolling die, and <b>chamfered</b> with a <b>chamfering</b> die at the same time. 　The experimental results showed that the teeth of a gear could be <b>chamfered</b> effcientiy in process of rolling gear...|$|R
25|$|The spindle router is {{positioned}} at the finer {{end of the}} scale of work done by a moulding spindle. That is to say it is able to cut grooves, edge moulding, and <b>chamfer</b> or radius the edge of a piece of wood. It is also possible to use it for cutting some joints. The shape of cut that is created is determined by {{the size and shape of}} the bit (cutter) held in the collet and the depth by the depth adjustment of the sole plate.|$|E
25|$|Most modern solid-carbide bits {{should not}} be used in {{conjunction}} with a spot drill bit or a center drill bit, as solid-carbide bits are specifically designed to start their own hole. Usually, spot drilling will cause premature failure of the solid-carbide bit and a certain loss of hole quality. If it is deemed necessary to <b>chamfer</b> a hole with a spot or center drill bit when a solid-carbide drill bit is used, it is best practice to do so after the hole is drilled.|$|E
25|$|The ceiling {{resembles the}} general {{form of the}} {{original}} but is a reconstruction from numerous repairs, particularly in 1928 and 1939. It is a compass ceiling with two tie beams. The 1706 ceiling was of “hand-riven oak” laid on rafters and collar beams. It {{has been replaced by}} a clapboard ceiling matching the general features of the north wing. The tie beams, that are marked with a lamb’s tongue and <b>chamfer,</b> are original while the roof trusses were replaced in the 1820s. The beam farthest north bears the figures “iiii” and the beam farthest south is a clumsy insertion. The porch trusses may be original. A new shingle roof was installed in 1954.|$|E
50|$|In architecture, {{the base}} of the Taj Mahal is a cube with <b>chamfered</b> corners, thereby {{creating}} an octagonal architectural footprint. Its great gate is formed of <b>chamfered</b> base stones and <b>chamfered</b> corbels for a balcony or equivalent cornice towards the roof.|$|R

Based on such method, the cone grinding wheel <b>chamfering</b> structure is designed. Taken the awl grinding wheel head organization as study object, influences of the grinding wheel structure size and installing position is studied. Model of gear <b>chamfering</b> is established based on the spatial geometry relations.

50|$|The {{sandstone}} memorial sits on {{a double}} stepped sandstone base with smooth faces. Surmounting this is a plinth with rough-cut faces, margined and chiselled around and a <b>chamfered</b> top. At the centre of each face is a smooth-faced sandstone plaque with a triangular top that projects into the <b>chamfered</b> surface. A L PETRIE is carved onto the front <b>chamfered</b> surface.|$|R
25|$|Rotary swaging {{is usually}} a cold working process, used to reduce the diameter, produce a taper, or add a point to a round workpiece. It can also impart {{internal}} shapes in hollow workpieces {{through the use of}} a mandrel (the shape must have a constant cross-section). Swaging a bearing into a housing means either flaring its groove's lips onto the <b>chamfer</b> of the housing, or flaring the housing's material over the edge of the bearing. The flaring is done with a pair of rolls that travel around the hole and are fed down into the part, deforming the metal in a controlled, predicted way. Grease is often used to lubricate this swaging process, which is also called roller swaging.|$|E
25|$|The {{door frame}} for this opening is highly altered {{in almost every}} detail with the {{exception}} of the basic size. The door itself may be original but is almost certainly of old if not of colonial origin. It consists of a pair of narrow, white battened doors opening at the center. Each door has a pair of vertical recessed panels on the top and bottom half, comprising four panels on each door. The brick arch is obviously a replacement, but the wooden door trim consisting of two vertical frames surmounted by a horizontal board bearing a <b>chamfer</b> and lamb’s tongue molding may be of colonial age. The vertical frame members extend beyond the lintel to the bottom of the brick arch. The space between the arch and the top board is filled with flat plaster. The sill is a simple wooden one. In all likelihood, this opening had a pediment of unknown appearance in colonial days. It is the only door in the church that has a lock and key. These are of modern origin.|$|E
500|$|The {{material}} {{of the church}} which remains from the medieval period is primarily Somerset Dundry stone, though Sutton stone and local blue lias also make up the stonework, with the latter constituting most of the stonework done in the post-Reformation period. The work done on the church since World War II is primarily concrete and Pennant sandstone. The roofs, added in the post-war period, are made of Welsh slate and lead. The West front of the cathedral is gabled along its length and contains the grand central doorway, higher in level than {{the floor of the}} nave. It is described as being [...] "double lobed" [...] with an [...] "arched head with continuous <b>chamfer</b> outline, colonnettes and dripmould".|$|E

25|$|Prominent in this {{property}} is the used of a <b>chamfered</b> front entrance gate. This front {{entrance into the}} property follows the <b>chamfered</b> pattern delineated by the city street {{at the corner of}} Salud and Aurora streets. This designed responded to city ordinances which mandated the incorporation of <b>chamfered</b> corners in urban city lots. This design, along {{with the use of a}} mirror-image <b>chamfered</b> design of the front of the house proper, provided the property with a significant amount of frontal garden space, uncommon in city lots just two blocks from Ponce's main Plaza, as is the case of this house.|$|R
40|$|In this paper, an Ultra Wideband (UWB) antenna is presented. The antenna {{radiating}} patch is circular {{in shape}} with coplanar waveguide (CPW) feeding technique. The proposed <b>chamfering</b> {{to the outer}} edges of the ground plane successfully widens the - 10 dB impedance bandwidth of the antenna to cover from 1. 92 GHz up to 15. 16 GHz (correspond to 155 % fractional bandwidth). The antenna gain varies from 2 to 5 dB over the operating band. Parametrical {{studies have been conducted}} for four different conditions of the ground plane; without <b>chamfering,</b> <b>chamfering</b> on the inner edges, <b>chamfering</b> on the outer edges and both <b>chamfering</b> of inner and outer edges. The effects of distinguished <b>chamfering</b> conditions to antenna performance are analyzed. The measured and simulated results for reflection coefficients and radiation patterns (2. 45 GHz, 3. 5 GHz and 5. 8 GHz) are presented. The corresponding realized gains are 2. 14 dB, 2. 85 dB and 3. 4 dB respectively. The measured results satisfactorily agreed with the simulated ones. The antenna is 8 - 37 % wider bandwidth than previous research...|$|R

2500|$|The tooling {{used for}} thread milling can be solid or indexable. For {{internal}} threads, solid cutters are generally limited to holes larger than , and indexable internal thread cutting tools {{are limited to}} holes larger than [...] The advantage {{is that when the}} insert wears out it is easily and more cost effectively replaced. The disadvantage is the cycle time is generally longer than solid tools. Note that solid multiple-form thread cutting tools look similar to taps, but they differ in that the cutting tool does not have a backtaper and there is not a lead-in <b>chamfer.</b> This lack of a lead-in <b>chamfer</b> allows the threads to be formed within one pitch length of the bottom of a blind hole.|$|E

50|$|The chancel, 29 ft by 18 ft, has an east {{window of}} c. 1350, {{and of the}} three cinquefoiled ogee lights with leaf tracery in a two-centred head; the {{internal}} and external labels are <b>chamfered.</b> In the north wall is a Victorian doorway, and further west a two-centred arch of c. 1450 and two hollow <b>chamfered</b> orders; the responds are moulded and shafted, with moulded bases and capitals. In the south wall are two windows; the eastern is of c.1350, partly restored and of two cinquefoiled lights with tracery in a segmental pointed head, under a <b>chamfered</b> label; the western window is Victorian, except the internal splays and hollow <b>chamfered</b> rear arch, which are of the 15th century. Between the windows is a Victorian doorway. There is no chancel arch, but between the chancel and the nave is a <b>chamfered</b> and moulded beam, probably of the 15th century.|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} grand {{entrance to}} the building is accentuated by the <b>chamfered</b> corner of the building’s southwest façade. The effect of the <b>chamfered</b> corner is enhanced by careful placement of three window bays. The three rows of windows outline the <b>chamfered</b> corner with one bay in the center nestled between two remaining window bays. Two grand Ionic order pilasters made of red brick and topped with terra cotta capitals with decorative volutes separate and enrich the corner window bays. On the <b>chamfered</b> corner, a name stone reading “Howes” sits between the windows on {{the third and fourth}} level and a date stone reading “A.D. 1900” sits atop the fourth story window, just under the roof cornice.|$|R
2500|$|The entire {{composition}} is crowned by a cornice which follows the modulation of the facade. A balustered parapet above the cornice completes the composition. In addition, broken-scroll pediments above the parapet accentuate the composition's rhythm {{at the central}} bay of the west facade, the extreme bays of both facades, and the corner <b>chamfer.</b> A [...] "mission-tile" [...] mansard roof completes the composition and accentuates the French influences of the design.|$|E
2500|$|The Macintosh mouse {{was little}} {{changed from the}} {{original}} Lisa version and is completely interchangeable. The case was a slightly darker brown than Lisa's beige coloring and it had less formal lines, with a thick <b>chamfer</b> around its edges to match the Macintosh case. Mechanically, the Lisa's steel ball {{was replaced by a}} rubber covered steel ball, but otherwise connected with the same DE-9 connectors, though updated with a square-shape and standard thumb screws. When the Macintosh Plus debuted in 1986, Apple had made minor revisions to the mouse mechanism and across all product lines, unified the cable connectors and used a more rounded shape. The following year, Apple once again unified its product lines by adopting a uniform [...] "Platinum" [...] gray color for all products. In 1987 this mouse had its final design change, updating both its color to Platinum with contrasting dark gray [...] "Smoke" [...] accents and minor mechanism changes.|$|E
2500|$|The {{investigation}} {{determined that}} some {{years before the}} accident, the bush at Station 143 had been pushed upwards so the <b>chamfer</b> and 0.055-inch (1.40mm) of the parallel-sided portion protruded beyond the upper surface of the boom. [...] The exposed end of the bush was then struck with a conical tool applied to the bore. [...] This action slightly flared the exposed end and left the external diameter 0.0038 inch (0.097mm) oversize. The bush was then pushed upwards {{out of the hole}} and re-inserted from the lower surface. [...] As the bush was being re-inserted its flared end broached the anodised material and a small amount of aluminium from the wall of the hole. [...] This broaching action scored the wall of the hole and left its diameter slightly oversize so the bush was not an interference fit anywhere except at its flared end. [...] Scoring of the wall of the hole and the absence of an interference fit left the inner lower boom vulnerable to developing fatigue cracks at Station 143.|$|E

40|$|The {{segmented}} {{expanding mandrel}} test {{is modified to}} provide additional information on the localized stresses and strains during ramp-hold tests. A <b>chamfered</b> specimen is designed with four flats on the outer diameter {{for the purpose of}} creating sectors of variable wall thickness which establishes a more nearly plane strain state in the thinnest-gauge sections. Ramp-hold tests conducted in 40 MPa of iodine at 32 S’C show that at a measured diametral strain of 0. 88, <b>chamfered</b> specimens fail while regular tubing specimens require diametral strains of 2 % or greater for failure. Calculations made with a two-dimensional, finite elements code show that at a measured diametral strain of 0. 84, the local strains in the clad ID over the segment interfaces are nearly identical for the regular and <b>chamfered</b> samples while the local stress in the <b>chamfered</b> sample is 1. 5 % greater. Results suggest that the smaller diametral failure strain of the <b>chamfered</b> specimen at low measured diametral strains is mainly due to its near plane strain condition and the higher hoop stresses resulting therefrom. 1...|$|R
2500|$|The tall c.13th-century tower arch is of a {{continuous}} triple <b>chamfer</b> leading to triple part-circular shafts terminating in moulded capitals {{at the height}} of the nave clerestory. A hood mould surrounds the arch to the same height of the blocked arches in the north, west and east sides. It finishes at the spring with the same open cusped devices as found on the equivalent internal arches on each side, and that on the external west wall. The plank door to the stair turret is at the north west, and sits within {{a continuous}} surround mould with pointed head. [...] The lower part of the tower arch, behind which is a meeting room, is closed off by a 20th-century wood screen of traceried panels, the central of which are open above a glazed double door. Within the tower, on the north side is a restored arched Hanoverian royal coat of arms. The tower contains one bell by Thomas Newcombe of Leicester (c.1550) and three by Tobias Norris of Stamford (1611; 1622; c.1683). Only three of the bells are used today.|$|E
2500|$|Sometimes a {{loud noise}} or high pitched squeal {{occurs when the}} brakes are applied. Most brake squeal is {{produced}} by vibration (resonance instability) of the brake components, especially the pads and discs (known as force-coupled excitation). This type of squeal should not negatively affect brake stopping performance. Techniques include adding <b>chamfer</b> pads to the contact points between caliper pistons and the pads, the bonding insulators (damping material) to pad backplate, the brake shims between the brake pad and pistons, etc. All should be coated with an extremely high temperature, high solids lubricant to help reduce squeal. This allows the metal to metal parts to move independently {{of each other and}} thereby eliminate the buildup of energy that can create a frequency that is heard as brake squeal, groan, or growl. It is inherent that some pads are going to squeal more given the type of pad and its usage case. Pads typically rated to withstand very high temperatures for extended periods tend to produce high amounts of friction leading to more noise during brake application. [...] Cold weather combined with high early-morning humidity (dew) often worsens brake squeal, although the squeal generally stops when the lining reaches regular operating temperatures. This more strongly affects pads meant to be used at higher temperatures. Dust on the brakes may also cause squeal and commercial brake cleaning products are designed to remove dirt and other contaminants. Pads without a proper amount of transfer material could also squeal, this can be remedied by bedding or re-bedding the brake pads to brake discs.|$|E

5000|$|Many {{city blocks}} in Barcelona, València {{and various other}} cities in Spain, and street corners (curbs) in Ponce, Puerto Rico, are <b>chamfered.</b> The <b>chamfering</b> was {{designed}} as an embellishment and a modernization of urban space in Barcelona's mid-19th century Eixample or Expansion District, where the buildings follow the <b>chamfering</b> of the sidewalks and streets. This pioneering design opens up broader perspectives, provides pleasant pedestrian areas and allows for greater visibility while turning. It might also be considered to allow for turning to be somewhat more comfortable as, supposedly, drivers would not need to slow down as much when making a turn {{as they would have}} to if the corner were a square 90 degrees, though in Barcelona, most <b>chamfered</b> corners are used as parking spaces or loading-unloading zones, leaving the traffic to run as in normal 90-degree street corners.|$|R
