40|$|Competition policy starts by shaping a {{legislative}} framework. This is aimed to establish boundaries for conducting competition and also sets limits of licit and illicit demarcation, for competitive and anticompetitive practices. The Romanian Competition Law has a divalent approach and {{it aims to}} provide specific behavioral conditions in order to stimulate and protect free-market competition, with {{the ultimate goal of}} developing a balanced, efficient and competitive economy. Our country’s Competition policy is based on punishing the behavior. There are three such types of anti-competitive behavior, namely: agreements <b>between</b> <b>undertakings,</b> abuse of dominant position and mergers and other concentrations <b>between</b> <b>undertakings.</b> Recent Practice proved that this “enforcement-conduct-punishment” structure is not necessary the best way to address competition and it is high time for authorities to switch both regulation and enforcement of competition from the “classical perspective” towards concepts like “competition advocacy” and “soft power” and give competition policy a new, reshaped face...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} antecedents and {{consequences}} of <b>collaboration</b> <b>between</b> sales and marketing. The results suggest that collaborative sales and marketing functions have benefits for the organisation in terms of improved business performance. In addition, improvements in <b>collaboration</b> <b>between</b> sales and marketing will positively affect marketing orientation and leading to superior marketing quality. The research began with {{an exploration of the}} interface between sales and marketing through the available literature. The existing research conceptualises the relationship between sales and marketing and highlights the benefits of interfunctional collaborative behaviour. Therefore, a study was designed to not only identify the antecedents of <b>collaboration</b> <b>between</b> sales and marketing so that the relationship between sales and marketing can be assessed and improved to the benefit of the organisation, but also to establish that business performance can be directly influenced by improvements in <b>collaboration</b> <b>between</b> sales and marketing. The research was undertaken through a mixed methodology, utilising exploratory case studies, a large-scale quantitative survey and confirmatory interviews. The data analysis involved four distinct analytical methods: within-case analysis, crosscase analysis, statistical analysis and confirmatory interviews. The large-scale survey was undertaken through a questionnaire that was sent to the Managing Directors/Chief Executives of large, UK-based organisations operating in the business-to-business arena. Through the findings from the survey five antecedents to <b>collaboration</b> <b>between</b> sales and marketing were identified - management attitudes towards co-ordination, conflict of interests, communications, market intelligence and organisational learning - and a revised conceptual framework was developed. The correlation and multiple regression analysis confirmed the weighting of each of the independent variables upon <b>collaboration</b> <b>between</b> sales and marketing and established a number of other relationships between the variables. The second part of the research focused on the consequences of improved <b>collaboration</b> <b>between</b> sales and marketing. It was found through the survey that <b>collaboration</b> <b>between</b> sales and marketing may have a positive effect upon business performance. The research also established that marketing orientation was not an antecedent to <b>collaboration</b> <b>between</b> sales and marketing, but that <b>collaboration</b> <b>between</b> sales and marketing may have a positive influence on marketing orientation. In addition, it was established that <b>collaboration</b> <b>between</b> sales and marketing has a positive effect on business performance. This research identifies some of the antecedents of <b>collaboration</b> <b>between</b> sales and marketing and clarifies the benefits of <b>collaboration</b> <b>between</b> sales and marketing to the organisation.

40|$|Purpose - The study {{seeks to}} explore the antecedents and {{implications}} of <b>collaboration</b> <b>between</b> sales and marketing and further to identify whether there are benefits in terms of business performance of improving <b>collaboration</b> <b>between</b> sales and marketing. Design/methodology/approach - Three exploratory case studies and {{a review of the}} literature are used to examine the antecedents to <b>collaboration</b> <b>between</b> sales and marketing. The case studies allow this fuzzy and undefined area to be clarified and existing theories to be empirically tested. Findings - The study identifies that there are three types of factor influencing <b>collaboration</b> <b>between</b> sales and marketing: integrators, facilitators, and management attitudes towards coordination. The exploratory case studies establish that senior management plays a pivotal role in creating and improving <b>collaboration</b> <b>between</b> sales and marketing, and that there is a positive correlation <b>between</b> <b>collaboration</b> <b>between</b> sales and marketing, and improved business performance. Research limitations/implications - The limitations of this study are that it is qualitative in nature and the conceptual framework needs be tested through a large-scale survey. In addition, the study considers only large UK organisations and, therefore, future research should consider expanding the study to overseas organisations. Practical implications - There appears to be an established relationship between the level of <b>collaboration</b> <b>between</b> sales and marketing and business performance. Further, the attitude of senior managers to improving coordination is critical to influencing <b>collaboration</b> <b>between</b> sales and marketing. Originality/value - This study contends that sales and marketing need to collaborate rather than integrate and uses exploratory case studies to support the development of the framework. ...|$|R
50|$|Under European Union {{competition}} law, some agreements infringing Article 101(1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (formerly Article 81(1) of the EC Treaty) {{are considered}} to be de minimis and therefore accepted. Horizontal agreement, that is one between competitors, will usually be de minimis where the parties' market share is 10% or less, and a vertical agreement, <b>between</b> <b>undertakings</b> operating at different levels of the market, where it is 15% or less.|$|R
40|$|In their {{economic}} activity, undertakings conclude many agreements between them. But agreements <b>between</b> <b>undertakings</b> which can distort the competition -anticompetitive agreements- are prohibited. The Romanian and EU law prohibit &# 39;all agreements <b>between</b> <b>undertakings,</b> decisions by {{associations of undertakings}} and concerted practices which have as their object or effect the prevention, restriction or distortion of competition&# 39;. However, the terms &# 39;agreements&# 39;, &# 39;decisions&# 39; or &# 39;concerted practices&# 39; are nowhere defined in the EU Treaties or in the Romanian law. These terms are key concepts {{in the analysis of}} anticompetitive agreements which can distort the competition. In the lack of a legal definition, these concepts have generated a complex body of jurisprudence, which has to be identified. The analysis of these key concepts necessarily entails the conceptual delimitation of the notions. On this purpose, the relevant legal provisions will be identified in the Romanian and EU law, as well as the decisions of the European Court of Justice in this matter. The present paper intends to present the conceptual evolution of the analysed notions, paying special attention to concerted practices and to parallel behaviour in price fixing on the market...|$|R

40|$|In this study, an {{analysis}} of the spatial characteristics of collaboration in scientific knowledge production in the Netherlands is performed. Within science-based industries, <b>collaboration</b> <b>between</b> governmental, academic and private organizations in scientific knowledge production is an important and growing phenomenon. Based on theoretical insights from the literature of the geography of innovation it was hypothesized that <b>collaborations</b> <b>between</b> organizations with different institutional backgrounds were more regionalized than <b>collaborations</b> <b>between</b> organizations with the same background. Co-publications in scientific subfields that are relevant for technological innovation in semiconductors and biotechnology were used as a proxy for <b>collaboration</b> <b>between</b> organizations. The main finding {{of this study is that}} heterogeneous collaborations are more regionalized than <b>collaborations</b> <b>between</b> the same kinds of organizations. Even after controlling for the spatial distribution of universities and the dominant position of Philips within the semiconductor technology in the Netherlands our hypothesis is confirmed. This can be seen as empirical evidence for the importance of geographical proximity for successful <b>collaboration</b> <b>between</b> organizations with different institutional backgrounds, like universityindustry collaboration. Geographical proximity does not seem to play an important role for <b>collaboration</b> in science <b>between</b> organizations with the same institutional background. Homogeneous collaboration occurs relatively more at the international level, thereby indicating that institutional proximity is more important here than geographical proximity. Also these results illustrate the fact that science takes place in international epistemic communities centred around a global discourse...|$|R
