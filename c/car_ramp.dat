25|$|Meyer Werft had {{constructed}} {{a large number}} of ships for various Viking Line partner companies during the 1970s. Worth noting is the new ship's bow construction, which consisted of an upwards-opening visor and a <b>car</b> <b>ramp</b> that was placed inside the visor when it was closed. An identical bow construction had also been used in Diana II.|$|E
2500|$|On April 5, 2007, {{at around}} 16:00 EEST (13:00 UTC) the ship ran aground on a well-marked {{volcanic}} reef east of Nea Kameni, within the caldera of the Greek island of Santorini, began taking on water, and listed up to 12 degrees to starboard before her watertight doors were reportedly closed (a report which was later refuted when the wreck was examined). The 1,195 passengers, mostly Americans and 60 Canadians, were initially all {{reported to be}} safely evacuated in {{three and a half}} hours, with four injuries. Some passengers, including a group of 77 students from Paisley Magnet School in North Carolina, were evacuated from the <b>car</b> <b>ramp</b> through the former car deck onto boats, but some passengers had to climb down rope ladders from the higher decks. The ship was towed off the rocks, and her list stabilized. Later, it was reported that two French passengers were missing.|$|E

50|$|The pier's three decks {{were used}} for the loading and {{unloading}} of cars, taxis, and trucks, which alleviated congestion on local streets. The ground floor was dedicated to cargo operations, with the central courtyard utilized for the parking and loading of up to 350 trucks simultaneously. The second floor was used for passenger operations, serving taxis picking up arriving passengers, and featuring a furnished waiting room. The roof served as parking for over 700 <b>cars.</b> <b>Ramps</b> connected the three levels.|$|R
50|$|The station {{building}} has {{an area of}} 18,006 square meters, with a total area of 33,528 square meters with the outdoor square. It {{has been designed to}} hold 6,000 waiting passengers. It is served by an elevated footbridge across the lines, arrival and departure <b>car</b> <b>ramps,</b> escalators and central air conditioning, electronic ticketing and an electronic-oriented information inquiry system. The outdoor station square hosts a large replica of the ancient Galloping Horse on a Flying Swallow statue, a symbol of Lanzhou.Lanzhou station has 5 platforms and a total of 12 shared tracks (passenger and freight).|$|R
5000|$|When {{many cars}} {{are to be}} transported, rather than using a {{specialized}} vehicle, a specialized trailer may be used instead, attached to a standard tractor truck or other large vehicle. These [...] "motor carriers" [...] often bring cars from factories to dealers. They typically have two levels that each hold 3-5 <b>cars,</b> <b>ramps</b> for moving the cars from ground to either level, and hook/chain ties and mounts to secure the cars for transport. Their beds, on each level, may have channels or tracks to guide loading and further maintain transport stability.|$|R

50|$|The World Building was {{demolished}} in 1955 for {{the expanded}} <b>car</b> <b>ramp</b> {{entrance to the}} Brooklyn Bridge. A large stained glass window by Otto Heinigke (1850-1915), combining the Statue of Liberty and the New York World banner, which had been installed over the William Street entrance to the building in 1908 (The World had helped raise funds from the public for the statue's pedestal), was bought by a group headed by a Columbia journalism professor when the building was condemned in 1953. The window is now in Room 305 of the Columbia University School of Journalism, where it serves as the backdrop for many events, including the annual presentation of the Pulitzer Prizes.|$|E

Jason spots this, and just as they are about to swap the babies back, Kevin walks in and demands the truth. Jason admits what happened and Kevin goes looking for his son. He finds Jack but warns Rosie to stay away, expressing his disappointment in her. Despite this, Jason is good friends with Kevin and supports him when he wins £200,000 on a scratchcard. When Kevin is almost crushed to death at the garage when his new <b>car</b> <b>ramp</b> malfunctions, Jason joins Rosie and her family at the hospital. Kevin orders Jason to call the ramp manufacturers to find the fault and threaten legal action if necessary. When it's revealed that the ramp was damaged deliberately, Jason is shocked and disgusted that someone would try to kill Kevin.|$|E

50|$|In April 2011, Tommy, Jason Grimshaw (Ryan Thomas) and Tyrone {{agree to}} a bet {{that he could have}} a fling with Sian, so he offers to teach her to drive and tries to kiss her but she refuses and gets out of the car, returns home and tells Sophie. The next day, Sophie goes over to Tommy and demands to know why he tried to kiss Sian when he knew she was a lesbian, he tells her he made a bet with Jason. Sophie's sister, Rosie (Helen Flanagan), hears this and demands answers from Jason, who tries to tell her it was a bet but she dumps him. Rosie, {{attempting}} to show Tommy's true colours, seduces him and tells him to undress and wait for her, in the meantime she calls Jason, who arrived and caught Tommy in his boxer shorts, following this Tommy is forced to roam the streets in his underwear - despite this, he and Jason remain friends. Eventually, following Rosie and Jason's reconciliation, Tommy gets back in the Websters' good books when he rescues Kevin from an accident at the garage, in which he is crushed underneath a car (Tyrone had damaged the <b>car</b> <b>ramp</b> that Kevin was using at the time).|$|E
5000|$|During the American Civil War, Joseph Pulitzer, {{later the}} {{publisher}} of the New York World newspaper, but then a recent immigrant from Hungary who had volunteered to serve in the Union cavalry, was thrown out of the elegant French's Hotel on Chatham Street at Frankfort Street. In 1888, Pulitzer bought the hotel and had it razed in order to build a new headquarters for the World. The New York World Building [...] - [...] also known as the [...] "Pulitzer Building" [...] - [...] designed by George Browne Post, opened in 1890, with the governor and the mayor in attendance to celebrate the 309-foot tallest building in the world, topped by a gilded dome, the first building in the city to be taller than Trinity Church. Pulitzer's own semi-circular office {{was at the top of}} the building and featured frescoes on the ceiling, embossed leather walls, and three large windows. The World folded in 1931, to become part of the New York World Telegram, then the New York World-Telegram & Sun, and, finally, in 1966, the New York World Journal Tribune, which represented the amalgamation of seven previously independent competing newspapers. The World Building became just another office building, which was torn down in 1955 to make way for an expanded <b>car</b> <b>ramp</b> to the Brooklyn Bridge.|$|E
50|$|However, 2011 is worse, not better: {{in early}} January, Kevin attacks Tyrone after {{learning}} that he and Sally spent two nights together and assumes that something happened between them and attacks Tyrone. Then, in February, Tyrone dates Julie Carp (Katy Cavanagh) briefly but break up as they agree {{that they are not}} right together. In March, Tyrone is incensed when Kevin wins £200,000 on a scratchcard, feeling he has no right to it, and tells Sally just before she signs the divorce papers. In return, she buys him a drink in gratitude. His year improves when Jack's grandson, Tommy Duckworth (Chris Fountain), comes looking for Jack: Tyrone tells him that Jack died a few months ago and they become friends and Tommy moves in. However, his life goes downhill in mid-May: on the 19th, Kevin orders a new hydraulic <b>car</b> <b>ramp</b> for the garage but would not let Tyrone use it. The next day, when Tyrone sees Kevin sack Tommy and head off on a call-out, he loses it and attacks the ramp with a 32-inch spanner before going to the Rovers. However, the ramp, due to the damage Tyrone has done, collapses on Kev and crushes him but Tyrone and Tommy pull him out, just as the ambulance arrives. Tyrone, in shock, gets drunk as he realises that he nearly killed Kevin but Kevin blames Tommy, assuming that it was because Kevin sacked him, so Tyrone confesses. Kevin is angry but understands why Tyrone did it and they call a truce. Tyrone agrees but continues to wind Kevin up at every opportunity.|$|E

The large amount of water taken on board led to the ship sinking shortly before 7:00 EEST on April 6, 2007, only a few hundred meters from the shore.Video footage shows that, toward the end, the ship completely inverted before settling stern first onto the sea floor. It was later reported that the tip of the bulbous bow was only 62 meters (203 feet) below sea level, but the stern was in water up to 180 meters (590 feet) deep. It is feared that the wreck would soon slide deeper and sink into the submerged caldera of the volcanic island.It has been speculated that the deep, almost vertical shore of the bathtub-like caldera made it impossible to beach the ship and save her from becoming a total loss.|$|E
