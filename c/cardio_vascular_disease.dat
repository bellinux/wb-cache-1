Univariate and multivariate analysis were carried out to compare individual factor using t-Test, ANOVA and the inter group comparisons were done by using Bon ferroni Post Hoc test. Patients with type 2 diabetes were shown to have higher NTproBNP values (n= 50, 1481. 021 ± 813. 405) than control subjects (n= 50, 23. 562 ± 23. 395) (p < 0. 05).

40|$|Abstract: <b>Cardio</b> <b>Vascular</b> <b>diseases</b> {{have assumed}} {{alarming}} proportions globally {{primarily due to}} life style changes, changing food habits and sedentary habits. Food {{plays an important role}} in regulating body functions and more so the <b>cardio</b> <b>vascular</b> functions. Obesity is a major cause of CVD and is related to nutrition and exercise. Excess fat in body gets deposited in adipose tissue, blood vessels, nerves and joints and often promotes diabetes, hypertension and renal disorders. All these can be regulated to a large extent by taking proper health supplements and regulating nutrition. Functional food rich in protein and fibers and less in calorific value can help in reducing reactive oxygen species and risks of myocardial infraction and improve quality of life. Nutraceuticals offer this possibility. Nutrition therapy focuses on maintaining optimal nutrition, modifying nutritional contents and controlling blood pressure.
