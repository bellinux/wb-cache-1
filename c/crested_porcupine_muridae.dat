50|$|The Indian <b>crested</b> <b>porcupine</b> has {{a stocky}} build {{with a low}} surface area to volume ratio, which aids in heat conservation. It has broad feet with long claws used for burrowing. Like all <b>porcupines,</b> the Indian <b>crested</b> <b>porcupine</b> has {{a good sense of}} smell and sharp, chisel-like incisors.|$|R
40|$|Indian <b>crested</b> <b>porcupine</b> (Hystrix indica) is {{a member}} of the family of Old World porcupines (Hystricidae). Its body is covered with {{multiple}} layers of quills, which serve for warning and attack if animal is threatened. However, the literature data on injuries caused by Indian <b>crested</b> <b>porcupine</b> are absent. We describe pathomorphological lesions in an Indian <b>crested</b> <b>porcupine</b> from the Ljubljana Zoo, which died after a fight with a younger male that caused a perforative quill injury of the thoracic wall, followed by septicaemia.

Forty-two mounting episodes which occurred inside the artificial burrow were recorded by a videocamera and subsequently analysed to describe the sequence of the mounting and copulation behaviour. The <b>crested</b> <b>porcupine</b> has a rather articulate courtship pattern. In this species, as in the Indian <b>crested</b> <b>porcupine,</b> mounting and copulation occurs throughout the year and appears to be independent of the reproductive status...|$|R

50|$|The Indian <b>crested</b> <b>porcupine</b> {{is a large}} rodent, {{weighing}} 11-18 kg. Their body (from {{the nose}} {{to the base of}} the tail) measures between 70-90 cm, with the tail adding an additional 8-10 cm. The lifespan of wild Indian <b>crested</b> <b>porcupines</b> is unknown, but the oldest known captive individual was a female that lived to be 27.1 years old.|$|R

50|$|Most of what {{is known}} about {{reproduction}} in the <b>crested</b> <b>porcupine</b> comes from individuals in captivity. Usually, female <b>crested</b> <b>porcupines</b> have one litter every year. One or two very well developed young are born in a chamber within the burrow that is usually lined with grass, after a 66-day gestation period, on average. The young weigh about 1000 g at birth, which is about 5% of the mother's weight. They leave the den after one week. At this time, the spines begin to harden. <b>Crested</b> <b>porcupines</b> reach adult weight at one to two years and are often sexually mature just before then. Breeding occurs throughout the year.|$|R
50|$|The <b>crested</b> <b>porcupine</b> is a {{terrestrial}} mammal; {{they very}} seldom climb trees, but can swim. They are nocturnal and monogamous. The <b>crested</b> <b>porcupine</b> {{takes care of}} the young {{for a long time and}} small family groups consist of the adult pair and young of various ages. In defense, when disturbed, they raise and fan their quills to make themselves look bigger. If continually bothered, the <b>crested</b> <b>porcupine</b> will stamp its feet, whirr the quills, and charge the disturber back end first trying to stab the enemy with the thicker, shorter quills. These attacks are known to have killed lions, leopards, hyenas, and even humans.|$|R

50|$|The <b>crested</b> <b>porcupine</b> (Hystrix cristata), {{a typical}} {{representative}} of the Old World porcupines, occurs throughout the south of Europe and North and West Africa. It is replaced in southern and central Africa by the Cape porcupine, H. africaeaustralis, and in India by the Malayan porcupine (H. brachyura) and Indian (<b>crested)</b> <b>porcupine</b> (H. indica). The latter also lives throughout the Middle East.|$|R
50|$|The Indian <b>crested</b> <b>porcupine</b> is {{protected}} under the India Schedule IV of the Indian Wildlife Protection Act of 1972, amended up to 2002. Nonetheless, because they are destructive to gardens and agricultural crops, porcupines are widely hunted. A large trade of these porcupines exists for consumption and medicinal use. Despite being considered a pest, Indian <b>crested</b> <b>porcupines</b> {{play an important role}} in spreading seeds and pollen.|$|R

50|$|Indian <b>crested</b> <b>porcupines</b> {{are found}} {{throughout}} southwest and central Asia and {{in parts of}} the Middle East, including Afghanistan, Armenia, Azerbaijan, China, Georgia, India, Iran, Iraq, Israel, Jordan, Kazakhstan,Lebanon, Nepal, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Sri Lanka, Turkey, Turkmenistan, and Yemen. Due to their flexible environmental tolerances, Indian <b>crested</b> <b>porcupines</b> occupy a broad range of habitats. They prefer rocky hillsides, but are also common in tropical and temperate shrublands, grasslands, forests, plantations, and gardens. Their range seems to be limited by seasonal densities of forage and the availability of suitable substrates for digging burrows. More specifically, the northern range of the Indian <b>crested</b> <b>porcupine</b> is limited by minimum summer night duration: they do not occur above latitudes where minimum night duration is less than 7 hours, presumably because of the amount of foraging time required to meet their dietary needs.|$|R
50|$|Rodents noted are the Gambian sun {{squirrel}} (Heliosciurus gambianus), striped ground squirrels (Xerus erythropus)s, nocturnal <b>crested</b> <b>porcupines</b> (Hystrix cristata), mongooses, brush-tailed porcupine, civets and genets.|$|R
50|$|Indian <b>crested</b> <b>porcupines</b> mate in February and March. Gestation lasts {{an average}} of 240 days. A female gives birth to one brood of two to four {{offspring}} per year. Young are born with open eyes and are covered in short, soft quills that harden {{within a few hours}} after birth. Young are fully weaned 13-19 weeks after birth, but remain in the den with parents and siblings until sexual maturity around 2 years of age. The Indian <b>crested</b> <b>porcupine</b> is usually monogamous, and both parents live in the den with their offspring throughout the year.|$|R
