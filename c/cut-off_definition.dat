30|$|Finally, several {{limitations}} should be seriously considered for accurate interpretations of our pooled analyses. First, the estimations {{on the relationship}} between HSP 27 expression and clinicopathological characteristics was only based on 714 NSCLC cases from eight retrospective observational studies. Similarly, the pooled analysis assessing the prognostic roles of HSP 27 was only based on 474 NSCLC cases from five retrospective observational studies. It should be the leading limitation for our meta-analysis with including so small number of the current evidences. The validity and accuracy of all the integrated estimates should be seriously considered in clinical practices. Second, the scarcity of a uniform <b>cut-off</b> <b>definition</b> for positive HSP 27 expression might be the major confounding factor affecting the validity of this meta-analysis. Moreover, different detecting methods supplied by the researchers might cause deviation from the actual value to some extent. Third, a significant heterogeneity was revealed between studies evaluating the prognostic value of HSP 27 for 1 -year OS. But we could not identify its possible origins by further sensitivity analysis. We speculated that the lack of available studies publishing the 1 -year survival outcomes might be the main reason for such a high heterogeneity. We hope we can collect more convincing outcome data by pooling more eligible literatures in the future. Lastly, we found that the majority of enrolled samples come from China. Clinicians should judiciously evaluate the generality of the combined estimates in the clinical settings of their own nations.|$|E

30|$|Baseline {{characteristics}} {{for these}} ten eligible articles were summarized in Table  1. Actually, there were 13 retrospective observational studies reported from these 10 papers, including 8 of them assessing {{the relationship between}} HSP 27 expression and clinicopathological features of NSCLC (Huang et al. 2005; Liu et al. 2016; Wang et al. 2011; Yao et al. 2009; Zhao et al. 2009, 2014 a; Li et al. 2005; Zu and Huang 2005) and 5 of them exploring the prognostic significance of HSP 27 expression for OS of NSCLC patients (Liu et al. 2016; Malusecka et al. 2008; Tsai et al. 2014; Wang et al. 2011; Zhao et al. 2014 a). Totally, 854 patients diagnosed with NSCLC were enrolled from the 13 included studies, and the sample size ranged from 22 to 209. Most researchers prepared paraffin-embedded tissues as the experimental materials (Huang et al. 2005; Wang et al. 2011; Zhao et al. 2014 a; Malusecka et al. 2008; Liu et al. 2016; Li et al. 2005; Zhao et al. 2009; Zu and Huang 2005), except the remaining two studies used the frozen tissues for further analysis (Tsai et al. 2014; Yao et al. 2009).

PD-L 1 expression has shown a positive association with response to PD- 1 inhibition in noncentral nervous system (CNS) tumors, e. g., melanoma or non-small cell lung cancer, and is discussed as a potential predictive biomarker for patient selection in these tumor types. This review summarizes current knowledge and potential clinical implications of PD-L 1 expression in glioblastoma. At present, the following conclusions are drawn: (a) functional data support a role for PD- 1 /PD-L 1 in tumor-associated immunosuppression in glioblastoma; (b) the incidence of PD-L 1 -expressing glioblastomas seems to be relatively high in comparison to other tumor types, however, the reported rates of glioblastomas with PD-L 1 protein expression vary and range from 61 to 88 %; (c) there is considerable variability in the methodology of PD-L 1 assessment in glioblastoma across studies with heterogeneity in utilized antibodies, tissue sampling strategies, immunohistochemical staining protocols, <b>cut-off</b> <b>definitions,</b> and evaluated staining patterns; (d) there are conflicting data on the prognostic role and so far no data on the predictive role of PD-L 1 gene and protein expression in glioblastoma. In summary, the ongoing clinical studies evaluating the activity of PD- 1 /PD-L 1 inhibitors in glioblastoma need to be complemented with well designed and stringently executed studies to understand the influence of PD- 1 /PD-L 1 expression on therapy response or failure and to develop robust means of PD-L 1 assessment for meaningful biomarker development...|$|R
40|$|Research {{has shown}} a modest {{adherence}} of diagnostic test accuracy (DTA) studies in glaucoma to the Standards for Reporting of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (STARD). We have applied the updated 30 -item STARD 2015 checklist {{to a set of}} studies included in a Cochrane DTA systematic review of imaging tools for diagnosing manifest glaucoma. Three pairs of reviewers, including one senior reviewer who assessed all studies, independently checked the adherence of each study to STARD 2015. Adherence was analyzed on an individual-item basis. Logistic regression was used to evaluate the effect of publication year and impact factor on adherence. We included 106 DTA studies, published between 2003 - 2014 in journals with a median impact factor of 2. 6. Overall adherence was 54. 1 % for 3, 286 individual rating across 31 items, with a mean of 16. 8 (SD: 3. 1; range 8 - 23) items per study. Large variability in adherence to reporting standards was detected across individual STARD 2015 items, ranging from 0 to 100 %. Nine items (1 : identification as diagnostic accuracy study in title/abstract; 6 : eligibility criteria; 10 : index test (a) and reference standard (b) definition; 12 : <b>cut-off</b> <b>definitions</b> for index test (a) and reference standard (b); 14 : estimation of diagnostic accuracy measures; 21 a: severity spectrum of diseased; 23 : cross-tabulation of the index and reference standard results) were adequately reported in more than 90 % of the studies.

40|$|A simple two-fluid {{model of}} {{diffusive}} shock acceleration, introduced by Axford, Leer, and Skadron (1977) and Drury and Voelk (1981) is revisited. This theory became a chief instrument {{in the studies}} of shock modification due to particle acceleration. Unfortunately its most intriguing steady state prediction about a significant enhancement of the shock compression and a corresponding increase of the cosmic ray production violates assumptions which are critical for the derivation of this theory. In particular, for strong shocks the spectral flattening makes a <b>cut-off</b> independent <b>definition</b> of pressure and energy density impossible and therefore causes an additional closure problem. Confining ourselves for simplicity {{to the case of}} plane shocks, assuming reacceleration of a pre-existing cosmic-ray population, we argue that also under these circumstances the kinetic solution has a rather simple form. It can be characterised by only a few parameters, in the simplest case by the slope and the magnitude of the momentum distribution at the upper momentum cut-off. We relate these parameters to standard hydrodynamic quantities like the overall shock compression ratio and the downstream cosmic-ray pressure. The two-fluid theory produced in this way has the traditional form but renormalized closure parameters. By solving the renormalized Rankine-Hugoniot equations we show that for the efficient stationary solution, most significant for cosmic ray acceleration, the renormalization is needed in the whole parameter range of astrophysical interest.

The diagnostic spirometric results of 14, 056 adults with respiratory obstruction were analysed. Differences in interpretation between a fixed 0. 70 forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV(1)) /forced vital capacity (FVC) cut-off point and a sex- and age-specific lower limit of normal cut-off point for this ratio were investigated. Of the subjects, 53 % were female and 69 % were current or ex-smokers. The mean post-bronchodilator FEV(1) /FVC was 0. 73 in males and 0. 78 in females. The sensitivity of the fixed relative to the lower limit of normal <b>cut-off</b> point <b>definition</b> was 97. 9 %, with a specificity of 91. 2 %, positive predictive value of 72. 0 % and negative predictive value of 99. 5 %.

The proportion of false positive diagnoses using the fixed cut-off point increased with age. The positive predictive value of pre-bronchodilator airflow obstruction was 74. 7 % among current or ex-smokers aged > or = 50 yrs. The current clinical guideline-recommended fixed 0. 70 forced expiratory volume in one second/forced vital capacity cut-off point leads to substantial overdiagnosis of obstruction in middle-aged and elderly patients in primary care.

40|$|Current {{thresholds}} {{to define}} {{chronic kidney disease}} (CKD) are essentially based on two measures, estimated GFR (eGFR) and albuminuria. The first two stages (stage 1 and 2) are mainly defined {{by the presence of}} abnormal albuminuria (> 30 mg/g creatinine). Conversely, overt CKD (stages 3 – 5) is defined by an eGFR 30 mg/g creatinine) can also be considered ade-quate <b>cut-off</b> values for <b>definition</b> of CKD in advanced age. To examine the relationship between age and kidney measures for CKD definition, two issues should be addressed. The first is represented by the assessment of kidney function in healthy sub-jects in function of age to establish whether eGFR below the threshold value (< 60 mL/min/ 1. 73 m 2) is a process of physiologic senescence or a sign of renal pathology. The second one concerns the evaluation of the interaction between age and eGFR/albumi-nuria thresholds on the risk of death and end-stage renal disease (ESRD). We examined the main studies characterized by high number of participants and/or long-term follow-up that analysed the whole age spectrum including very elderly subjects, in differ-ent study settings, i. e. general population, high-risk patients and CKD patients, including those under nephrology care.

Methods: Data from two multi-centre studies were used in the analysis: in a cross-sectional and a longitudinal fashion. At every assessment, data were collected on SLEDAI- 2000 and treatment. The cross-sectional analysis with receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves was used to examine the appropriate SLEDAI- 2000 score to define active disease and increase in therapy was the reference standard. In the longitudinal analysis, sensitivity to change of SLEDAI- 2000 was assessed with multinomial logistic regression. ROC curves analysis was used to examine possible cut-points in score changes associated with change in therapy, and mean changes were estimated. Results: In the cross-sectional analysis, the most appropriate cut-off scores for active disease were 3 or 4. In the longitudinal analysis, the best model for predicting treatment increase was with the change in SLEDAI- 2000 score and the score from the previous visit as continuous variables. The use of cut-points was less predictive of treatment change than the use of continuous score. The mean difference in the change in SLEDAI- 2000 scores, adjusted for prior score, between patients with treatment increase and those without was 2. 64 (95 % CI 2. 16, 3. 14).

We aimed to study the characteristics of culprit lesions in Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS) patients with low versus high calcium score. Material and methods: A total of 45 patients with ACS underwent 64 -slice CCTA. Group 1 - 19 patients with Ca score below 400 HU, Group 2 - 26 patients with calcium score > 400 HU. In all patients a complex CT analysis of the culprit plaque was performed. Results: There {{were no significant differences}} between the groups at baseline as regard to age, gender, cardiovascular risk factors (p> 0. 2). In patients with high calcium score, culprit lesions presented a significantly larger amount of plaque burden than in patients with low calcium score (82. 8 ml versus 131. 81 ml, p < 0. 0001). This was also true when assessing in a subanalysis different <b>cut-off</b> points for <b>definition</b> of relatively higher calcium score (89. 66 ml versus 137. 93 ml, p < 0. 0001, for calcium score cut off 600 HU, 97. 88 ml versus 137. 57 ml, p< 0. 0001 for calcium score cut-off of 1000 HU).

40|$|Depressive {{symptoms}} {{have become}} the most important global public health issue. Iron {{plays an important role in}} brain function, cognition, and behavior, and its impacts on depressive symptoms may be multifactorial with both positive and negative effects. Previous observational studies focusing on the association between iron status and depressive symptoms showed inconsistent results. Ferritin is a ubiquitous intracellular protein that can store and release iron and is widely used as a clinical biomarker to evaluate iron status. We performed a cross-sectional study to examine the relationship between serum ferritin and depressive symptoms among 3, 839 subjects who were from the Tianjin Chronic Low-grade Systemic Inflammation and Health (TCLSIHealth) cohort. Depressive symptoms were assessed using the Chinese version of 20 -item self-rating Depression Scale (SDS) with 4 cutoffs (40, 45, 48 and 50) to indicate elevated depressive symptoms (40 was the primary cut-off). The prevalence of depressive symptoms was 36. 5 %, 17. 6 %, 11. 0 % and 7. 0 % for SDS ≥ 40, ≥ 45, ≥ 48 and ≥ 50, respectively. With the primary cut-off point of 40, multiple potential confounding factors were adjusted and the odds ratios (95 % confidence interval) of having elevated depressive symptoms by quartiles of serum ferritin concentrations were 1. 00 (reference), 1. 10 (0. 91, 1. 34), 0. 81 (0. 66, 1. 01) and 1. 02 (0. 81, 1. 28) for the first, second, third and fourth quartile, respectively (P for trend = 0. 76).

40|$|Aspirin is {{the most}} {{commonly}} used antiplatelet drug in the secondary prevention of cardiovascular events. Many patients experience thromboembolic events despite daily aspirin therapy. On the basis of clinical and laboratory findings, an issue of concern has emerged, frequently referred to as “aspirin resistance”. The aim of this thesis was to establish the prevalence of laboratory aspirin resistance in patient populations and to elucidate the reasons for aspirin failure. The thesis comprises two independent studies in which I assessed a range of clinical and laboratory measures in patients with peripheral arterial disease (PAD) and patients with acute ischaemic stroke. The effect of in-hospital aspirin administration on platelet response was determined in acute stroke patients. Laboratory tests for platelet and aspirin response were compared with the current gold standard assay of optical platelet aggregometry with arachidonic acid. A <b>cut-off</b> value for <b>definition</b> of incomplete response to aspirin was determined. The current literature is reviewed and discussed. Incomplete aspirin response was found in 18 % of aspirin-treated patients with PAD. There {{were no significant differences in}} any of the measured markers nor in clinical parameters between responders and incomplete responders. The prevalence of incomplete aspirin response in acute ischaemic stroke or TIA was 43 %. However, after observed aspirin administration in hospital, this percentage decreased to 29 %, suggesting incomplete compliance in some patients. On admission, platelets from patients with incomplete response were significantly more sensitive to adenosine diphosphate (ADP) when compared with those from responders. There were no other differences that characterised the incomplete responders to aspirin. The data support the growing body of opinion that true biochemical resistance to aspirin is uncommon. Incomplete adherence to therapy was found to be a major cause of incomplete response to aspirin and therefore amenable to intervention. The problem remains of which laboratory methods should be employed as no single test has emerged as clinically informative. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Staphylococcus aureus {{is one of}} {{the most}} common causes of {{intramammary}} infections in dairy cows at dry off. Reliable identification is important for disease management on herd level and for antimicrobial treatment of infected animals. Our objective was to evaluate the test characteristics of PathoProof ™ Mastitis PCR Assay and bacteriological culture (BC) in diagnosing bovine intramammary infections caused by S. aureus at dry off at different PCR cycle threshold (Ct) -value cut-offs. Methods Sterile quarter samples and non-sterile composite samples from 140 animals in seven herds were collected in connection with the dairy herd improvement (DHI) milk recording. All quarter samples were analyzed using BC whereas all composite samples were analyzed with PathoProof ™ Mastitis PCR Assay. Latent class analysis was used to estimate test properties for PCR and BC in the absence of a perfect reference test. The population was divided into two geographically divided subpopulations and the Hui-Walter 2 -test 2 -populations model applied to estimate Se, Sp for the two tests, and prevalence for the two subpopulations. Results The Se for PCR increased with increasing Ct-value cut-off, accompanied by a small decrease in Sp. For BC the Se decreased and Sp increased with increasing Ct-value cut-off. Most optimal test estimates for the real-time PCR assay were at a Ct-value cut-off of 37; 0. 93 [95 % posterior probability interval (PPI) 0. 60 - 0. 99] for Se and 0. 95 [95 % PPI 0. 95 - 0. 99] for Sp. At the same Ct-value cut-off, Se and Sp for BC were 0. 83 [95 % PPI 0. 66 - 0. 99] and 0. 97 [95 % PPI 0. 91 - 0. 99] respectively. Depending on the chosen PCR Ct-value cut-off, the prevalence in the subpopulations varied; the prevalence increased with increasing PCR Ct-value cut-offs. Conclusion Neither BC nor real-time PCR is a perfect test in detecting IMI in dairy cows at dry off. The changes in sensitivity and prevalence at different Ct-value cut-offs for both PCR and BC may indicate a change in the underlying disease definition. At low PCR Ct-value cut-offs the underlying disease definition may be a truly/heavily infected cow, whereas at higher PCR Ct-value <b>cut-offs</b> the disease <b>definition</b> may be a S. aureus positive cow. </p...|$|R
40|$|Mild {{cognitive}} impairment (MCI) {{is defined as}} an objective impairment in cognitive function which spares everyday functional ability. The syndrome is shrouded in controversy regarding <b>definition,</b> <b>cut-off</b> criteria, and clinical utility. Consequently, it is an uncertain label for the client being diagnosed by their healthcare practitioner. To date, minimal research in New Zealand has focused on MCI within specialist assessment services. Reasons for this paucity of literature will be discussed throughout this thesis. The current research aimed to identify how practitioners deliver and perceive {{cognitive impairment}} diagnosis, and examine how clients respond to receiving this diagnosis. Client experiences were framed within the common sense model (CSM). This theory originates from health psychology, where coping behaviour {{is said to be}} influenced by the cognitive representations that a person has about their condition. Although the framework is previously discussed in relation to chronic illness, international researchers have started to examine the utility of the model in explaining MCI diagnosis response. Given this context, the CSM framework guided the client-focused components of this thesis. In Study One, 57 practitioners who diagnose cognitive impairment completed a questionnaire on labels applied to MCI and beliefs about the value of diagnosis delivery. Responses were analysed using content analysis to gain an impression of professional practice. Cognitive disorder - not otherwise specified (CD-NOS), early dementia, and normal ageing were reported to additionally label the symptoms of MCI in clinical practice. In Study Two, client responses were examined in a small clinical sample (N = 9) diagnosed with MCI and CD-NOS. Participants were interviewed twice within six months of initial diagnosis. Interpretative phenomenological analysis was used to gain insight into how people cope and make sense of their diagnosis over time. Descriptive analyses were also undertaken with a subset of Study Two data to examine changes and differences in coping strategies over time. Findings suggest that participants may not see their diagnosis as an illness or significant health threat {{in the first six months}} following diagnosis. This prompts a question on the suitability of an illness model with reference to diagnosis response. Findings from this research add to the literature by highlighting practice associated with an evolving form of clinical diagnosis in NZ...|$|R

In majority of the studies, age of 45 years is used as <b>cut-off</b> line in <b>definition</b> of the young patients with coronary artery disease or myocardial infarction. Studies have shown that younger population aged less than 40 years represents only 2 - 8 % of all patients with myocardial infarction. Objective. The {{aim of this study}} was to examine the specificities of clinical and angiographic characteristics of the patients recovered from {{acute myocardial infarction}}, younger than 45 years at the moment of attack, by comparing their clinical and angiographic characteristics with those of patients older than 65 years, who recovered from acute myocardial infarction. Method. The study included 78 patients recovered from acute myocardial infarction, 33 patients were younger than 45 years (40. 7 ± 3. 9 years), 25 (75. 7 %) men and eight (24. 2 %) female, and 45 patients were older than 65 years (68. 2 ± 4. 2 years), 32 (71. 3 %) men and 13 women. Detailed history taking, physical examination, permanent ECG monitoring, laboratory analyses, X-ray examination, echocardiography and selective coronarography of all patients were performed. Results. Patients younger than 45 years had a significantly higher incidence of STEMI (p 0. 05) Multivessel disease existed at 54. 5 % under the age of 45 and 77. 8 % older than 65 years (p 0. 05). The disease of left main coronary artery had 6. 1 % of patients younger than 45 and 22. 2 % of patients older than 65 years (p 0. 05) Were without significant coronary artery stenosis Comparing risk factors for coronary artery disease in patients younger than 45 years and older than 65 years, we find: hypertension in 48. 5 % vs. 88. 9 % (p 0. 05), diabetes mellitus in 21. 2 % vs. 55. 5 % (p 0. 05), and stress in 18. 2 % vs. 2. 2 % (p < 0. 01). Conclusion. Patients with myocardial infarction younger than 45 years are predominantly male and have a significantly higher incidence of infarction with ST segment elevation (STEMI), lower and diaphragmatic localization of infarction, significantly higher prevalence of smoking habits, hypertriglyceridemia and stress, as well as significantly lower incidence of three-vessel and multivessel disease and stenosis of the left main coronary artery, compared to patients with myocardial infarction older than 65 years...|$|R
40|$|AbstractBackground: Recent {{innovations}} in the pharmaceutical drug discovery environment have generated new chemical entities {{with the potential}} to become disease modifying drugs for osteoarthritis (DMOAD’s). Regulatory agencies acknowledge that such compounds may be granted a DMOAD indication, providing they demonstrate that they can slow down disease progression; progression would be calibrated by a surrogate for structural change, by measuring joint space narrowing (JSN) on plain X-rays with the caveat that this delayed JSN translate into a clinical benefit for the patient. Recently, new technology has been developed to detect a structural change of the OA joint earlier than conventional X-rays. Objective: The Group for the Respect of Ethics and Excellence in Science (GREES) organized a working party to assess whether these new technologies may be used as surrogates to plain x-rays for assessment of DMOADs. Methods: GREES includes academic scientists, members of regulatory authorities and representatives from the pharmaceutical industry. After an extensive search of the international literature, from 1980 to 2002, two experts meetings were organized to prepare a resource document for regulatory authorities. This document includes recommendations for a possible update of guidelines for the registration of new chemical entities in osteoarthritis. Results: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is now used to measure parameters of cartilage morphology and integrity in OA patients. While some data are encouraging, correlation between short-term changes in cartilage structure observed with MRI and long-term radiographic or clinical changes are needed. Hence, the GREES suggests that MRI maybe used as an outcome in phase II studies, but that further data is needed before accepting MRI as a primary end-point in phase III clinical trials. Biochemical markers of bone and cartilage remodelling are being tested to predict OA and measure disease progression. Recently published data are promising but validation as surrogate end-points for OA disease progression requires additional study. The GREES suggests that biochemical markers remain limited to ‘proof of concept’ studies or as secondary end-points in phase II and III clinical trials. However, the GREES emphasizes the importance of acquiring additional information on biochemical markers in order to help better understand the mode of action of drugs to be used in OA. Regulatory agencies consider that evidence of improvement in clinical outcomes is critical for approval of DMOAD. Time to total joint replacement surgery is probably the most relevant clinical end-point for the evaluation of efficacy of a DMOAD. However, at this time, time to surgery can not be used in clinical trials because of bias by non disease-related factors like patient willingness for surgery or economic factors. At this stage, it appears that DMOAD should demonstrate a significant difference compared to placebo. Benefit should be measured by 3 co-primary end-points: JSN, pain and function. Secondary end-points should include the percentage of patients who are ‘responder’ (or ‘failure’). The definition of a ‘failure’ patient would be someone with progression of JSN> 0. 5 mm over a period of 2 – 3 years or who has a significant worsening in pain and/or function, based on validated <b>cut-off</b> values. The <b>definition</b> of the clinically relevant cut-off points for pain and function must be based on data evaluating the natural history of the disease (epidemiological cohorts or placebo groups from long-term studies). These cut-offs points should reflect a high propensity, for an individual patient, to later require joint replacement.

40|$|Background: Recent {{innovations}} in the pharmaceutical drug discovery environment have generated new chemical entities {{with the potential}} to become disease modifying drugs for osteoarthritis (DMOAD's). Regulatory agencies acknowledge that such compounds may be granted a DMOAD indication, providing they demonstrate that they can slow down disease progression; progression would be calibrated by a surrogate for structural change, by measuring joint space narrowing (JSN) on plain X-rays with the caveat that this delayed JSN translate into a clinical benefit for the patient. Recently, new technology has been developed to detect a structural change of the OA joint earlier than conventional X-rays. Objective: The Group for the Respect of Ethics and Excellence in Science (GREES) organized a working party to assess whether these new technologies may be used as surrogates to plain x-rays for assessment of DMOADs. Methods: GREES includes academic scientists, members of regulatory authorities and representatives from the pharmaceutical industry. After an extensive search of the international literature, from 1980 to 2002, two experts meetings were organized to prepare a resource document for regulatory authorities. This document includes recommendations for a possible update of guidelines for the registration of new chemical entities in osteoarthritis. Results: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is now used to measure parameters of cartilage morphology and integrity in OA patients. While some data are encouraging, correlation between short-term changes in cartilage structure observed with MRI and long-term radiographic or clinical changes are needed. Hence, the GREES suggests that MRI maybe used as an outcome in phase II studies, but that further data is needed before accepting MRI as a primary end-point in phase III clinical trials. Biochemical markers of bone and cartilage remodelling are being tested to predict OA and measure disease progression.
