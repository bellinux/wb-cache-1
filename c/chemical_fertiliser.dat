500|$|A Finnish study {{published}} in 1997 found that bacterial communities under P.sylvestris without mycorrhizae metabolised organic and amino acids, while communities among S.bovinus metabolised mannitol, a sugar alcohol. The mycelia also extended the environment in the soil that the bacteria were able to grow in. An experimental study in Portugal showed that Pinus pinaster trees grew better after being inoculated with [...] mycelium from S.bovinus, Laccaria laccata and Lactarius deterrimus and spores of Pisolithus tinctorius and Scleroderma citrinum. These fungi were proposed as an alternative for <b>chemical</b> <b>fertiliser</b> in arboriculture of pine trees.

40|$|Conventional {{modelling}} {{approaches to}} understand farmers’ adoption preferences tend {{to ignore the}} range of choices farmers face, {{as well as the}} trade-offs among various possibilities to improve crop yield. To address this deficiency, this study employs the choice modelling approach to examine famers’ valuation of various attributes under a Green Revolution package to improve crop yield. It was found that the use of <b>chemical</b> <b>fertilisers</b> and drought-resistant seed varieties was highly valued by farmers in the two regions of Northern Ghana. Information on farmers’ willingness to pay for <b>chemical</b> <b>fertilisers</b> is a useful tool for reducing the current high fertiliser subsidy. Food-insecure farmers, on the other hand, valued organic fertilisers and drought-resistant seeds, while female-headed households among food-secure farmers had a preference for organic fertiliser. Legume intercropping to fix soil fertility has some potential for promotion among farmers, but it was less valued than <b>chemical</b> <b>fertilisers.</b> Farm households {{did not appear to be}} interested in using seed varieties that vary in time to maturation, which have potential benefits in the face of current climate variability and future climate change. More in-depth study is required to better understand these issues...|$|R

30|$|Human {{population}} is increasing worldwide {{giving rise to}} intensive farming system and unsuitable cropland management that ultimately results in reduced soil fertility (Onwudike 2010; Bedada et al. 2014). Extensive use of <b>chemical</b> <b>fertilisers</b> is suggested for replenishment of nutritional deficiencies to increase crop yield. Many disadvantages of widespread use of <b>chemical</b> <b>fertilisers</b> include increase in soil acidity, mineral imbalance and soil degradation (Kang and Juo 1980; Ayoola and Makinde 2008) and even farmers nowadays do not prefer <b>chemical</b> <b>fertilisers</b> (Bedada et al. 2014). In composting, microorganisms decompose organic substrate aerobically into carbon dioxide, water, minerals and stabilised organic matter (Bernal et al. 2009; Kala et al. 2009; Vakili et al. 2015). Compost is added into the soil to improve nutrients and water-holding capacity (Arslan et al. 2008; Vakili et al. 2015). Recently, researchers observed that addition of cow dung to biomass generated from palm oil industries improves the {{physical and chemical properties}} including nutritional composition of compost. Palm oil biomass mixed with cow dung in the ratio of 1 : 3 significantly improved the compost quality with respect to various parameters such as pH, electrical conductivity and C:N ratio (Vakili et al. 2015). Thus, cow dung may not only act as a substitute for <b>chemical</b> <b>fertilisers</b> because it supplements organic matter, but also as a conditioner for soil (Garg and Kaushik 2005; Yadav et al. 2013; Be´langer et al. 2014). Slurry from biogas plant is also a nutrient-rich source but it cannot be used at large scale because of its drawbacks such as eutrophication and leaching of the soil nutrients (Garg et al. 2005; Wachendorf et al. 2005; Islam et al. 2010; Lu et al. 2012; Guo et al. 2014).|$|R

50|$|In early 1881 the NZ Government {{offered a}} bonus for three years to any company that would {{manufacture}} 50 tons of sulphuric acid per year.

The Burnside Chemical Works in Dunedin were the first of their type in New Zealand. Kempthorne Prosser constructed further superphosphate plants in Auckland, Christchurch, and Wanganui. From this stemmed a major <b>chemical</b> <b>fertiliser</b> industry, of national importance to the agricultural and pastoral economy. For almost a century 'K. P.' was to dominate the market.

50|$|During the Eyschen years, Luxembourgish {{agriculture}} {{made great}} progress. The government played {{a large role}} in these developments by improving agricultural education, encouraging improvements in breeding and crop-growing techniques, facilitating the creation of farmers' cooperatives, and encouraging the use of <b>chemical</b> <b>fertiliser.</b> The steel industry gave Luxembourgish farmers a fertiliser that was cheap and efficient: the cinders from the Gilchrist-Thomas process. The government obliged the steel companies to provide the cinders from this procedure to farmers at a discounted rate, and made the attribution of new mining concessions conditional on them doing so. The government also encouraged wine-growers to turn towards producing quality wines. In 1909, a law and a Grand Ducal decree provided a new legal and regulatory framework for wine production. In 1892, the creation of a plant pathology service had already helped combat phylloxera.|$|E

During his tenure there, the government had conducted various experiments in rain fed land, using expensive inputs like hybrid seeds, <b>chemical</b> <b>fertilisers</b> and <b>chemical</b> pesticides which Nammazhwar considered futile as the rain fed farmers were resource poor.
