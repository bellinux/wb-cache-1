25|$|During the 1880s, their boiler {{pressure}} was increased from 130 to 140 psi, and their <b>cylinder</b> <b>bore</b> increased from 16 to 17 inches, with those rebuilt after 1896 being fitted with 17.5 inch cylinders. These changes led to considerably increased tractive effort.|$|E
25|$|Like all {{the members}} of the J-6 Whirlwind family, the R-760 had larger {{cylinders}} than the R-790. The piston stroke of 5.5in (14.0cm) was unchanged, but the <b>cylinder</b> <b>bore</b> was expanded to 5.0in (12.7cm) from the R-790's bore of 4.5in (11.4cm). While the R-790 was naturally aspirated, the R-760, like the other J-6 engines, had a gear-driven supercharger to boost its power output.|$|E
25|$|Riot {{shotguns}} {{are also}} more limited in range than combat shotguns {{by the nature of}} their use. A combat shotgun is considered effective out to 75 yards (70 m) because on average at least 1 pellet of a 9 pellet 00 buckshot load will hit a human sized target at that range. This is enough to degrade the combat effectiveness of an enemy soldier, but {{it is not enough to}} reliably disable an assailant in a defensive situation. For that, there must be multiple hits to the target, enough that one or more pellets will hit a vital region. Generally this is well under 27 yards (25 meters) with a <b>cylinder</b> <b>bore</b> barrel. Beyond this range, slugs and good iron sights are recommended, extending the range to over 109 yards (100 meters).|$|E

500|$|Maunsell's {{modifications}} included {{increasing the}} boiler pressure from [...] to , and {{the reduction of}} the <b>cylinder</b> <b>bore</b> by half an inch. [...] The footplate was also modified for operation on the Southern's new composite loading gauge, and differed from previous batches in having the Ashford-style cab, which was usually fitted to LBSCR locomotives. Unlike the original Drummond cab that was also favoured by Urie, the Ashford-style cab was of an all-steel construction and had a roof that was flush with the cab sides. It was inspired by the standard cab developed in 1904 by R. M. Deeley for the Midland Railway, and was {{one of a number of}} Midland features introduced by Maunsell's chief draughtsman James Clayton, who transferred to Ashford Works in 1914 from the Midland Railway. Variants of this cab became standard for all new Southern Railway locomotives and converted tank engines.|$|E
500|$|The Model 1897 {{was popular}} before World War I, {{but it was}} after the war broke out that sales of the Model 1897 picked up. This was because many were {{produced}} {{to meet the demands of}} the military. When the United States entered World War I, there was a need for more service weapons to be issued to the troops. It became clear to the United States just how brutal trench warfare was, and how great the need was for a large amount of close-range firepower while fighting in a trench, after they had observed the war for the first three years. The Model 1897 Trench grade was an evolution of this idea. The pre-existing Winchester Model 1897 was modified by adding a perforated steel heat shield over the barrel which protected the hand of the user from the barrel when it became over-heated, and an adapter with bayonet lug for affixing an M1917 bayonet. [...] This model was ideal for close combat and was efficient in trench warfare due to its 20-inch <b>cylinder</b> <b>bore</b> barrel. Buckshot ammunition was issued with the trench grade during the war. Each round of this ammunition contained nine 00 (.33-caliber) buckshot pellets. This gave considerable firepower to the individual soldier by each round that was fired. [...] This shorter barrel and large amount of firepower is what made this grade ideal for trench warfare.|$|E

The coating, marketed as Suzuki Composite Electro-chemical Material or SCEM, is nickel-phosphorus-silicon-carbide based, reducing weight (by eliminating a steel liner) and improving heat transfer, allowing for tighter and more efficient piston-to-cylinder clearance.|$|R
