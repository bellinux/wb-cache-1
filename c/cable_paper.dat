40|$|The {{assessment}} of the suitability of cables of 6 – 110 kW with XLPE insulation in comparison with cables of the same voltage but possessing paper-oil insulation has been fulfilled {{on the basis of}} the method of multi-objective optimization that makes it possible to account not only the quantitative characteristics (of reduced costs), but also qualitative ones. As an indicator of the reliability of the cable line the maximum mean time to failure (the value inversely proportional to the parameter of succession of failures), which is an order more for cable lines with XLPE insulation than for <b>cable</b> lines with <b>paper</b> insulation, is adopted. A comprehensive {{assessment of}} the convenience of installation of cable lines revealed that the installation of cable with XLPE insulation features a 1. 2 – 1. 6 times easier installation as compared to three-wire (voltage 10 kW) and 1. 4 times easier installation as compared to single-core oil-filled cables (voltage of 110 kW). The efficacy of the cables 6 – 110 kW with XLPE insulation is proved on the basis on the method of multi-objective optimization, that took into account as the costs for the construction and operation of cable lines and the reliability of its operation, ease of its installation and other quality indicators. If the goals taken into account are considered as equally important, the polyethylene-insulated cables for a voltage of 10 – 110 kW is more efficient as compared to three-wire (voltage 10 kW) and solid (110 kW) <b>cables</b> with <b>paper</b> insulation. Herewith, the cost of the cable with XLPE insulation may exceed the cost of <b>cable</b> with <b>paper</b> insulation up to two times.
