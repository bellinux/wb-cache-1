25|$|In 1995, Andrew Roos {{experimentally}} {{observed that}} the first byte of the keystream is correlated to the first three bytes of the key and the first few bytes of the permutation after the KSA are correlated to some linear combination of the key bytes. These biases remained unexplained until 2007, when Goutam Paul, Siddheshwar Rathi and Subhamoy Maitra proved the keystream-key correlation and in another work Goutam Paul and Subhamoy Maitra proved the permutation-key correlations. The latter work also used the permutation-key correlations to design the first algorithm for <b>complete</b> <b>key</b> reconstruction from the final permutation after the KSA, without any assumption on the key or initialization vector. This algorithm has a constant probability of success in a time which is the square root of the exhaustive key search complexity. Subsequently, many other works have been performed on key reconstruction from RC4 internal states. Subhamoy Maitra and Goutam Paul also showed that the Roos type biases still persist even when one considers nested permutation indices, like S or S. These types of biases are used {{in some of the}} later key reconstruction methods for increasing the success probability.|$|E

500|$|Both {{teams had}} chances during the match with Philadelphia making an {{especially}} intense push {{in the final}} 15 minutes. While both defenses struggled throughout, Frei and MacMath combined {{for a total of}} seven saves (four and three, respectively). Schmid told the press after the final: [...] "From a fans' standpoint, it was probably a very, very entertaining game." [...] A writer for Sports Illustrated quipped that [...] "Schmid's decision not to start Obafemi Martins and Pappa was confusing — and then looked like a stroke of genius", as both were integral to the Sounders offense in the later stages of the game. Schmid told reporters during a post-match interview that Martins did not start due to a muscle strain. The coach also praised the ability of Martins and Dempsey to <b>complete</b> <b>key</b> passes with each other. The Sounders received a $250,000 cash prize for winning the tournament. It was Dempsey's first club trophy of his long career, and he beat Martins in voting to be named the Player of the Round. Yedlin and Frei also received votes. Seattle {{went on to win the}} MLS Supporters' Shield for having the best record in the league before being eliminated from the playoffs. The Open Cup win granted the team a spot in the 2015–16 CONCACAF Champions League.|$|E

Miami was then forced to punt, but caught a break when Donnie Jones' kick bounced off the elbow of Jets linebacker Brad Kassell, and long snapper John Denney recovered at the Jets' 42-yard line.

50|$|Focus IT {{general control}} (ITGC) testing: ITGC are not {{included}} in the definition of entity-level controls under the SEC or PCAOB guidance.

By nature, ITGC enables management to place reliance on fully automated application controls (i.e., those that operate without human intervention) and IT-dependent controls (i.e., those that involve the review of automatically generated reports). Focused ITGC testing is merited to support the control objectives or assertions that fully automated controls have not been changed without authorization and that control reporting generated is both accurate and <b>complete.</b> <b>Key</b> ITGC focus areas therefore likely to be critical include: change management procedures applied to specific financial system implementations during the period; change management procedures sufficient to support a benchmarking strategy; and periodic monitoring of application security, including separation of duties.|$|E
