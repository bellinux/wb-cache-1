40|$|A novel respirometer is {{developed}} for microbial toxicity tests. The respirometer {{is based on}} luminescent quenching of oxygen to measure the concentration of dissolved oxygen in cell vessels and evaluate the toxicity of chemicals by monitoring the effect of toxicants on cell respiration of micro-organisms. The oxygen sensing element is ruthenium complex absorbed {{on the surface of}} silica particles followed by immobilizing on a silicone rubber film. The oxygen sensing film is coated on the inner bottom of a transparent <b>cell</b> <b>vessel.</b> A sensing device scanning under the <b>cell</b> <b>vessel</b> is used for remote monitoring of the oxygen concentration inside the cell vessels so {{that a large number of}} samples can be handled in one batch. The sensing device includes the excitation light sources and an optical cable connected to a filter and a photomultiplier tube for detecting the luminescence in the <b>cell</b> <b>vessel</b> which can then be related to the dissolved oxygen concentration inside the <b>cell</b> <b>vessel.</b> The movement of the sensing device and data acquisition are controlled by a personal computer. The toxicity of heavy metals to activated sludge, soil bacteria and E. coli were tested using the present device.

40|$|Placental {{growth factor}} (PIGF) binds to VEGFR 1 {{and is known}} {{to play a role}} in {{pathological}} angiogenesis, but its mechanism of action remains unclear. Endothelial cell migration in response to angiogenic stimuli requires coordination of adhesive function with VEGFR signalling, and I have studied the intracellular trafficking of integrins and VEGFRs in primary cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). VEGFR 2 and alphavbeta 3 integrin cycled rapidly between the plasma membrane and EEA 1 /Rab 4 -positive early endosomes, whereas VEGFR 1 remained at the plasma membrane and was not subject to rounds of endo- exocytosis. Treatment of HUVECs with PIGF or VEGF-A promoted the rapid and coordinate mobilisation of both VEGFR 2 and alphavbeta 3 from these endosomes to the plasma membrane, via a mechanism that was developed on inactivation of GSK- 3 beta but did not require the activity of PKD 1, nor the tyrosine kinase activity of VEGFRs. Furthermore, RNAi of Rab 4 a and pharmacological inhibition of alphav integrin signalling opposed PIGF-promoted endothelial <b>cell</b> <b>vessel</b> branching and cross-bridge formation in an organotypic tube formation assay.;Taken together these data show that PIGF can influence endothelial cell function by controlling the endocytic recycling of alphavbeta 3 integrin. This recycling pathway is required to induce vessel branching and the formation of a complex endothelial <b>cell</b> <b>vessel</b> network. In addition, regulation of VEGFR 2 recycling by VEGFR 1 represents a novel mechanism for mediating receptor cross talk during angiogenesis. Therefore, I have identified a novel pathway by which PIGF/VEGFR 1 is able to positively influence the angiogenic response...|$|E

Using the same partly neutralized suspension s from the pH measurements, the corresponding yield in g. /coulomb upon electrodeposition was determined. Additional evidence was obtained that clay acts similarly to a weak monobasic acid upon titration, {{and that the}} following hyperbolic relation holds approximately for the yield upon electrodeposition at any pH: milliequivalents NaOH/ 100 g. clay (g. /F) = 105. A simple mathematical explanation of this relation is presented, based upon the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation for the titration of weak acids. The <b>cell</b> <b>vessel</b> used for electrodeposition constituted the metal anode in order to afford an even deposit of cylindrical shape, which could be handled with minimum loss.

40|$|A {{reference}} method is described for {{the determination of}} the substance concentration of ionized calcium in plasma by which ionized calcium (free or unbound) may be reliably determined on the basis of calibration with aqueous solutions with known concentration of ionized calcium. The composition of the calibration solutions is chosen such that the activity coefficient of the calcium ion is assumed to be identical both in the calibration solutions and in "normal" plasma, i. e. by convention, the ionic strength (I-m) is 0. 160 mol/kg. The convention is adopted of reporting ionized calcium measurements as concentration expressed as mmol/l. The proposed {{reference method}} for ionized calcium measurement in plasma is based on the use of a cell consisting of an external reference electrode with a saturated potassium chloride liquid/liquid junction in combination with a calcium ion-selective membrane electrode of defined construction and performance.

The gamma-ray source used was 10000 curie Cobalt- 60,and total irradiation dose was 10 ^ 7 roentgen ï½ž 10 ^ 8 roentgen. The irradiation was carried out at room temperature. The results obtained are summarized as follows : (1) Coloring of the <b>cell</b> <b>vessel</b> due to the gamma-ray irradiation does not deteriorate {{the characteristics of the}} lead sulphide photoconductive cell as a near infrared detector to any appreciable degree. (2) Decrease in dark impedance of the cell due to the gamma-ray irradiation shows only a slight recovery. (3) Value of the activation energy is changed by the gamma-ray irradiation. (4) Dark current is increased, photocurrent is decreased and time constant is also decreased. Increase in dark current is due to the decrease in dark impedance of the cell, and shows little recovery. The cause of the decrease in photocurrent and time constant may be the formation of current carrier recombination centers created by the gamma-ray irradiation. (5) Current noise is increased by the gamma-ray irradiation, but recovers almost completely. Photocurrent and time constant also recover almost completely. (6) The time needed for the complete recovery of the cell photoelectric characteristics seems to be proportional to the irradiation dose. (7) From the results obtained above, it may by concluded that the lead sulphide photoconductive cell is not damaged so easily by the gamma-ray irradiation dose which was used in this experiment...|$|E

Basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), via activation of its receptor, FGFR- 1, has been postulated {{to be an}} important inducer of host stromal response and angiogenesis. To assess the putative role of tumor-associated stromal <b>cells</b> and <b>vessels</b> in tumor progression, we studied non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) from 84 patients, including 51 squamous cell carcinomas and 33 nonsquamous cell carcinomas, by immunohistochemical detection. bFGF and FGFR- 1 immunoreactivity was observed in tumor and in tumor-associated stromal <b>cells</b> and <b>vessels.</b> The expression of bFGF and FGFR- 1 in stromal cells was higher in squamous than in non-squamous cell carcinomas (respectively, P =. 007 and P =. 0004). We found that bFGF and FGFR- 1 expression in tumor and tumor-associated stromal <b>cells</b> and <b>vessels</b> was directly correlated with host stromal response, as assessed by intratumoral extension of stroma, but not with angiogenic response, as assessed by microvessel count. Although FGFR- 1 expression of tumor cells was directly correlated with T-stage (P =. 03), bFGF expressions of tumor-associated stromal <b>cells</b> and <b>vessels</b> were inversely correlated with lymph node metastasis (respectively, P =. 0001 and P =. 0002) and advanced pathological stage (respectively, P =. 03 and P =. 01). These findings suggest that bFGF might mediate host stromal response in NSCLC and that the expression of bFGF in tumor-associated stromal <b>cells</b> and <b>vessels</b> might have an inhibitory role in NSCLC progression.

40|$|The {{interaction}} of endothelial cells and mural cells {{play a critical}} role in the stabilisation and maturation of the embryonic and postnatal vasculature. Several pathological situations exhibit poor and abnormal endothelial and mural cell association. In this study immunohistochemical analysis revealed dysmorphogenic microvessels within atherosclerotic plaques are lacking mural cells. Similar dysmorphogenic mural <b>cell</b> poor <b>vessels</b> were also observed in human myocardium following laser induced myocardial injury. In both cases elevated VEGF was detected associated with the mural <b>cell</b> poor <b>vessels.</b> To gain insight into the mechanisms controlling mural cell recruitment assays were established to examine directly smooth muscle cell migration and adhesion between smooth muscle cells and endothelial cells in culture. These assays were used to study the involvement of the angiopoietin/Tie 2 system in recruitment and retention of mural cells. Ang-l was observed to stimulate endothelial-directed migration of putative mural cell precursors. The ligand also increased adhesion between endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells. To investigate further the possible role of Tie 2 in interaction between endothelial cells and mural cells a mutant form of the receptor found in inherited venous malformations (VM) was studied. The form of VM associated with this mutant receptor is characterised by dysmorphogenic, enlarged mural <b>cell</b> <b>vessels.</b> Surprisingly, mutant Tie 2 did not inhibit endothelial-induced mural cell migration or adhesion between endothelial cells and mural cells. Taken together these data suggest Tie 2 has a role in regulating endothelial:mural cell interaction. Furthermore, the presence of mural <b>cell</b> poor <b>vessels</b> in the atherosclerotic plaque, injured myocardium and inherited VM may reflect escape of these vessels from regression by the presence of survival factors in the case of the plaque and injured myocardium, or constitutive anti-apoptotic signalling from mutant Tie 2 in the case of VM.

Porcine acellular lung matrix is a novel tissue scaffold known to promote cell adherence while minimizing inflammatory reactions. In this study, we evaluate the capacity of porcine acellular lung matrix to sustain cellularization and neovascularization in a rat model of subcutaneous implantation and chronic hernia repair. We hypothesize that, compared to human acellular dermal matrix, porcine acellular lung matrix would promote greater <b>cell</b> infiltration and <b>vessel</b> formation. Following pneumonectomy, porcine lungs were processed and characterized histologically and by scanning electron microscopy to demonstrate efficacy of the decellularization. Using a rat model of subcutaneou implantation, porcine acellular lung matrices (n = 8) and human acellular dermal matrices (n = 8) were incubated in vivo for 6 weeks. To evaluate performance under mechanically stressed conditions, porcine acellular lung matrices (n = 7) and human acellular dermal matrices (n = 7) were implanted in a rat model of chronic ventral incisional hernia repair for 6 weeks. After 6 weeks, tissues were evaluated using hematoxylin and eosin and Massonâ€™s trichrome staining to quantify <b>cell</b> infiltration and <b>vessel</b> formation. Porcine acellular lung matrices were shown to be successfully decellularized. Following subcutaneous implantation, macroscopic vessel formation was evident. Porcine acellular lung matrices demonstrated sufficient incorporation and showed no evidence of mechanical failure after ventral hernia repair. Porcine acellular lung matrices demonstrated significantly greater cellular density and vessel formation when compared to human acellular dermal matrix. Vessel sizes were similar across all groups. <b>Cell</b> infiltration and <b>vessel</b> formation are well-characterized metrics of incorporation associated with improved surgical outcomes. Porcine acellular lung matrices are a novel class of acellular tissue scaffold. The increased <b>cell</b> and <b>vessel</b> density may promote long-term improved incorporation and mechanical properties.

40|$|To {{understand}} and promote vascular health, we must reduce the aggression to the vessel wall {{and enhance the}} physiologic mechanisms leading to restoration of vessel wall function. Three main defense mechanisms are responsible for maintaining cardiovascular homeostasis: the regenerative production of endothelial progenitor <b>cells,</b> <b>vessel</b> wall angiogenesis, and macrophage-mediated reverse cholesterol transport. Endothelial progenitor <b>cells</b> can restore <b>vessel</b> wall function and reduce atherosclerosis. In patients with risk factors, high levels of circulating progenitor cells increase event-free survival from cardiovascular events. Mobilization of progenitor cells includes physical and pharmacological approaches, of which exercise and statin therapy have great potential. Angiogenesis is a pivotal defense mechanism to counteract hypoxia and is needed for plaque regression. However, neovessels are susceptible for intraplaque hemorrhage, particularly in diabetes mellitus. In these patients, the haptoglobin 2 - 2 genotype is the more affected, and may benefit from an antioxidant approach. Finally, the reverse cholesterol transport system is the main mechanism for plaque regression.

In the present study the micronucleus frequency in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells as a function of such parameters as type of radiation, type of cell substrate, changes in cell environment, and time course of the effect were characterized. Observations of the persistence of micronucleus formation in irradiated CHO cells reveal that the number of cells containing micronuclei reaches its maximum within nine hours after irradiation and remain elevated for at least five days. The influence of the cell environment on micronucleus formation in CHO cells was examined by plating cells in preirradiated nutrient medium or on preirradiated <b>cell</b> culture <b>vessels.</b> In all experiments, pre-irradiation of the cell substrate (the culture dish or culture dish filled with medium) led to a significantly higher micronucleus frequency than when cells were plated on un-irradiated substrate.
