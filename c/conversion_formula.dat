40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{present study}} focuses on <b>conversion</b> <b>formulas</b> for {{estimating}} four common statistical-based representative wave heights (i. e. mean wave height, root-mean-square wave height, {{average of the}} highest one-third wave height, and average of the highest one-tenth wave height) from zeroth moment of wave spectrum. The existing <b>conversion</b> <b>formulas</b> are usually derived from given probability density functions of wave heights. There {{seems to be no}} literature that proposes an empirical formula for estimating the representative wave heights from zeroth moment of wave spectrum. Hence, the objective {{of this study is to}} develop an empirical formula for computing the representative wave heights. Based on the existing <b>conversion</b> <b>formulas,</b> the representative wave heights are assumed to be proportional to square root of zeroth moment of wave spectrum. The influence of depth-limited wave breaking is empirically incorporated into the proportional coefficients. The empirical formula is calibrated and examined based on field experiments (13, 456 wave records collected from 4 sources). Reasonable good agreements are obtained between the measured and computed representative wave heights. The applicability of five sets of existing <b>conversion</b> <b>formulas</b> is also examined. The present formula gives better estimation than those of existing <b>conversion</b> <b>formulas...</b>|$|R

30|$|In the Bland–Altman {{analysis}} comparing {{level of}} agreement between Vscan and SonoSite measurements, there was an even spread across the range of disc sizes suggesting no systematic bias. It did find that the Vscan tended to over-estimate ONSD by a small amount (0.33  ±  0.65  mm). We hypothesize {{that this may be}} due to the screen size and resolution of the Vscan as compared to the SonoSite. Since the screen on the Vscan device was smaller than that of the SonoSite, attempts to position, the calipers on the edge of the optic nerve sheath may have lead to an overestimation. Importantly, this strong agreement between ONSD measurements by both devices allows us to create a quadratic <b>conversion</b> <b>formula</b> between the two measures.
