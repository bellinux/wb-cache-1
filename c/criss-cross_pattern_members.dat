50|$|Pbunalikeviruses are nonenveloped, with a {{head and}} tail. The head has a {{diameter}} of about 75 nm. The tail is around 140 nm long displaying a <b>criss-cross</b> <b>pattern,</b> has a small baseplate, and is contractile.|$|R
50|$|Despite the station's {{historic}} designation {{the original}} large green-blue Vitrolite panels and black trim {{on the platform}} walls were replaced by small square dark green tiles in a unique <b>criss-cross</b> <b>pattern</b> with yellow lettering and no trim.|$|R
50|$|The first {{victim was}} 18-year-old Elizabeth Stevens. She had just alighted from {{a bus to}} Langwarrin when she was dragged to nearby Lloyd Park. Her throat was slashed and a <b>criss-cross</b> <b>pattern</b> was carved into her chest.|$|R
50|$|Viruses in Parapoxvirus are enveloped, with ovoid geometries. These viruses {{are about}} 140-170 nm wide and 220-300 nm long, {{and have a}} regular surface structure; tubules with a {{diameter}} of 10-20 nm form a <b>criss-cross</b> <b>pattern.</b> Genomes are linear, around 130-150kb in length.|$|R
5000|$|Within {{a linear}} approximation, the {{parameters}} [...] and [...] {{are the same}} as in thelinear conjugate gradient method but have been obtained with line searches.The conjugate gradient method can follow narrow (ill-conditioned) valleys, where the steepest descent method slows down and follows a <b>criss-cross</b> <b>pattern.</b>|$|R
50|$|Once {{the pastry}} has been rolled out, it {{is placed in}} a pie dish and filled with jam or fruit jelly. The strips of pastry needed for the {{covering}} are generally 3 mm thick, 5 mm wide and 30 centimeters long. They form a <b>criss-cross</b> <b>pattern.</b>|$|R
50|$|Latticework is an {{openwork}} framework {{consisting of}} a <b>criss-crossed</b> <b>pattern</b> of strips of building material, typically wood or metal. The design is created by crossing the strips to form a network. Latticework can be purely ornamental, or {{can be used as}} a truss structure such as a lattice girder bridge.|$|R
5000|$|In plain weave, {{the warp}} and weft are aligned so they form a simple <b>criss-cross</b> <b>pattern.</b> Each weft thread crosses the warp threads by going over one, then under the next, and so on. The next weft thread goes under the warp threads that its {{neighbor}} went over, and vice versa.|$|R
50|$|Lattice pastry is {{a pastry}} {{used in a}} <b>criss-crossing</b> <b>pattern</b> of strips in the {{preparation}} of various foods. Latticed pastry is used as a type of lid on many various tarts and pies. The openings between the lattice allows fruit juices in pie fillings to evaporate during the cooking process, which can caramelize the filling.|$|R

50|$|The Kobo Glo {{shipped in}} 4 colours: Black Night, Pink Sunset, Blue Moon, and Silver Star. The back no longer {{features}} the quilt pattern {{found in most}} of the company's products since its inception; it now has a diamond <b>criss-cross</b> <b>pattern.</b> It is made of the same soft matte plastic used in the Kobo Touch and Kobo Mini.|$|R
50|$|The storeys {{are divided}} by {{projecting}} stone string courses, and at each successive storey, the walls become slightly thinner, creating a step at each string course. The vertical pilaster strips continue up the tower, and are interspersed with stone strip arches at lower level and triangular decoration at upper level, {{in some instances}} resulting in a <b>criss-cross</b> <b>pattern.</b>|$|R
50|$|Viruses in Felixounalikevirus are non-enveloped, with head-tail geometries. The {{diameter}} {{is around}} 73 nm.

In short, what are called ‘disseminations.'" ...|$|R
2500|$|A popular myth {{states that}} Gurkha soldiers, {{fighting}} for Britain, crawled along the ground, feeling the laces {{of the soldiers}} they encountered. British soldiers employed straight- or bar-lacing, while Japanese troops employed a <b>criss-cross</b> <b>pattern.</b> <b>Criss-cross</b> laces could therefore {{mean the difference between}} life and death. The importance of correct lacing was thus emphasized to British troops. [...] Whether true or not, there is an account of Gurkha soldiers checking the boots and laces of soldiers they encounter in the dark to find if they are friend or foe.|$|R
5000|$|In basketweave, {{groups of}} {{warp and weft}} threads are {{interlaced}} so that they form a simple <b>criss-cross</b> <b>pattern.</b> Each group of weft threads crosses {{an equal number of}} warp threads by going over one group, then under the next, and so on. The next group of weft threads goes under the warp threads that its neighbor went over, and vice versa.|$|R
5000|$|The {{operation}} is performed for producing indentations on {{a part of}} a workpiece. Knurling allows hands or fingers to get a better grip on the knurled object than would be provided by the originally smooth metal surface. Occasionally, the knurled pattern is a series of straight ridges or a helix of [...] "straight" [...] ridges rather than the more-usual <b>criss-cross</b> <b>pattern.</b>|$|R
5000|$|More {{common than}} knurl cutting, knurl rolling is usually {{accomplished}} using {{one or more}} very hard rollers that contain the reverse of the pattern to be imposed. It is possible for a [...] "straight" [...] knurl (not criss-crossed) to be pressed with a single roller, however the material needs to be supported adequately to avoid deformation. A <b>criss-cross</b> <b>pattern</b> can be accomplished using any of: ...|$|R
50|$|While in Baku, halva {{is likely}} to mean the Turkish style, tahini-based version, the most famous {{regional}} variant is from Sheki where Şəki halvası halva refers to a layered bakhlava style pastry filled with spiced-nut mix and topped by <b>criss-crossed</b> <b>patterns</b> of a red syrup made from saffron, dried carrot and beetroot. In Qabala it's possible to find şabalıd halvasını, a form of soft halva made from sugar and chestnuts.|$|R
25|$|The tramway has {{a varied}} fleet. The {{standard}} livery introduced on the Flexity 2 trams has purple fronts, with white sides and a purple <b>criss-cross</b> <b>pattern</b> {{on the lower}} sides. The heritage tramcars mostly use the traditional green and cream livery of BTS in various styles from the 1930s to the 1990s, with some older cars using the older red and cream livery and teak and cream livery. Some trams carry colourful all-over advertisements.|$|R
50|$|Virtually {{all modern}} raquets are strung in a <b>criss-cross</b> horizontal-vertical <b>pattern.</b> Various other {{patterns}} {{have been used}} in history with varying success.|$|R
60|$|I {{looked on}} the man. He was as ill-equipped as she. A London tailor must have cut his suit of gray. A single band of linen, soiled by the journey, was wound about his throat, and I {{remember}} oddly the buttons stuck {{on his knees}} and cuffs, and these silk-embroidered in a <b>criss-cross</b> <b>pattern</b> of lighter gray. Some had been torn off. As for his face, 'twas as handsome as ever, for dissipation sat well upon it.|$|R
50|$|When {{re-fitting}} a wheel, {{the nuts}} (or bolts) should be tightened in a <b>criss-cross</b> <b>pattern</b> (to even out the forces) and initially {{should only be}} tightened 'finger tight' on all nuts. In this context 'finger tight' is tight enough to reach the point where free play is taken up and proper tightening is about to begin, say, the tightening force using the lug wrench/wheel brace like a screwdriver. This should be repeated twice, to ensure the wheel is properly centered and restrained by all nuts (as often the first nut(s) that is tightened will be slightly loose after completing the set for the first time), then the wheel should be lowered {{to the ground and}} the <b>criss-cross</b> tightening <b>pattern</b> repeated to modest torque (say few fingers force on the lug wrench/wheel brace arm), and then finally repeated to full hand force.|$|R

It is shaped into either triangles or {{sometimes}} spheres. The dough consists of flour, yeast, milk, eggs, margarine, salt, sugar, and fat. Tajik boortsog are often decorated with a <b>criss-cross</b> <b>pattern</b> by pressing the bottom of a small strainer on the dough before it is fried.|$|R
50|$|Paravaccinia is {{a member}} of the Parapoxvirus family. It has a {{cylindrical}} body about 140 X 310 nm in size, with convex ends covered in a <b>criss-cross</b> <b>pattern</b> of rope like structures. The virus is resistant to cold, dehydration, and temperatures up to 56 °C. Upon injecting a cell with its genome, the virus begins transcription in the cytoplasm using viral RNA polymerase. As the virus progresses through the cell, the host begins to replicate the viral genome between 140 minutes and 48 hours.|$|R
50|$|In Franconia the meat, {{the pork}} rind and the bone are {{scratched}} in a <b>criss-cross</b> <b>pattern,</b> seasoned with salt, pepper and caraway {{and put in}} a casserole dish with diced root vegetables and onions where it is doused with beer and roasted in the oven for about two or three hours. The roast is ready as soon as the meat is easy to separate from the bone and the pork rind is crispy and golden brown. It is then served with various side dishes including gravy, Kartoffelklöße, salad, sauerkraut, red cabbage and savoy cabbage.|$|R
50|$|Most gold lunulae have {{decorative}} patterns {{very much}} resembling beaker pottery from {{roughly the same}} period, using geometrical patterns made up of straight lines, with zig-zags and <b>criss-cross</b> <b>patterns,</b> and many different axes of symmetry. The curving edges of the lunula are generally followed by curving border-lines, often with decoration between them. The decoration is typically most dense at the tips and edges, and the broad lower central area is often undecorated between the borders. The decoration also resembles that on amber and jet spacer necklaces, which {{are thought to be}} slightly later in date.|$|R
50|$|While the mech {{starts with}} a {{standard}} Vulcan Canon, the player can equip it with two upgradable weapons: the Beam and the Laser Shots. The Beam Shot can be upgraded to fire a wide wave of strong beam shots while the Laser Shots form a large <b>criss-crossing</b> <b>pattern</b> capable of striking more nimble enemies. The Zeoth can take {{a certain amount of}} damage before being destroyed (the game has no Lives System). However, the player is offered limitless Continues and a chance to start the Stage over if defeated.|$|R
5000|$|Ganymede City {{is a term}} {{coined by}} Arthur C. Clarke in his science fiction novel, 3001: The Final Odyssey. It refers to two regions, Lagash Sulcus and Memphis Facula, {{on the surface of}} one of Jupiter's moons, Ganymede. When viewed from space these regions have a <b>criss-crossing</b> <b>pattern</b> of what appears to be [...] "streets and avenues". However these [...] "streets and avenues" [...] would be ten {{kilometers}} wide. Clarke said: [...] "To my eyes it appears considerably more artificial than the notorious 'Mars Face' and its surroundings." ...|$|R
40|$|Applying a {{magnetic}} field on an electronic system where levels are quantized {{has the effect of}} lifting angular momentum state degeneracies. If one has access to magnetic fields such that the cyclotron energy beomes comparable to or greater that the inter-level separation in the system, a <b>criss-cross</b> <b>pattern</b> of energy levels in the Energy vs Magnetic field diagram may be observed. For specific magnetic fields, positive angular momentum states of lower levels can become degenerate with negative angular momentum states of higher levels, thus prompting one to expect interesting physical phenomena related to mixing of states.

40|$|The {{structure}} of a turbulent boundary layer due to abruptly applied strong favorable and adverse pressure gradients, leading to relaminarization and separation, respectively, is considered. Digital image enhancement techniques have been applied to laser light sheet smoke flow visualization pictures. A 'local range modification' technique {{has been used to}} extract structural details otherwise lying ill-defined in the fully turbulent core. The cross-stream sections immediately prior to separation, and particularly those shortly after the application of the favorable pressure gradient, are vividly organized; there exists a <b>criss-cross</b> <b>pattern</b> in the spanwise plane with a mean orientation at about +/- 45 deg to the vertical...|$|R

40|$|Magnetization {{reversal}} in nanowire systems, such as alnico-type permanent magnets, slanted columns produced by glancing-angle deposition, and nanowires embedded in alumina templates, is investigated by model calculations. The angular {{dependence of the}} domain-wall propagation is Kondorski-like, reminiscent of Kondorski pinning in bulk materials but with a somewhat different physics and consistent with Kerr hysteresis-loop measurements. <b>Criss-cross</b> <b>patterning</b> of alnicos improves the coercivity but reduces the remanence, with virtually zero net effect on energy product.
