5000|$|Untitled Web Series About a Space Traveler Who Can Also Travel Through Time (UWSAASTWCATTT), {{also known}} as Inspector Spacetime, is an ongoing adventure-sci-fi web series created by Travis Richey, {{and based on the}} {{television}} comedy series Community. The series is based on a fictional series first mentioned during the episode [...] "Biology 101" [...] of <b>Community.</b> <b>Inspector</b> Spacetime is, by itself, a Doctor Who parody. UWSAASTWCATTT follows The Inspector, a character that can travel through time and space by way of a red BOOTH (Bio Organic Omnidirectional Time Helix), a special space/timeship similar in some ways to the TARDIS. [...] Reception for the series has been positive, with USA Today including it in their [...] "Best of TV on the Web in 2012" [...] list. A feature film based on the series, entitled The Inspector Chronicles, is currently in production.|$|E
40|$|This article {{examines}} a public meeting {{at which a}} <b>community</b> <b>inspector</b> from the Metropolitan Police Force (London, UK) addressed an audience of Highgate residents about new arrangements for dealing with crime and anti-social behaviour. The {{article examines}} how the identities of criminals and those who engage in anti-social behavior are constructed in talk. In this regard, it highlights the inferential significance of “age” and “urban geography” in the inspector's discourse. A series of jokes are analyzed which are shown to trade—for their intelligibility—upon the audiences' ability to hear how place name descriptions position persons with respect to criminal activity. The article is a further explication of how public speakers generate rapport with audiences; it also reveals highly divisive aspects of community policing...|$|E

500|$|In a joint {{statement}} released on July 15, 2015, the inspector general of the State Department and the inspector general {{of the intelligence community}} said that their review of the emails found information that was classified when sent, remained so {{at the time of their}} inspection and [...] "never should have been transmitted via an unclassified personal system." [...] They also stated unequivocally that this classified information should never have been stored outside of secure government computer systems. Clinton had said over a period of months that she kept no classified information on the private server that she set up in her house. Government policy, reiterated in the nondisclosure agreement signed by Clinton as part of gaining her security clearance, is that sensitive information can be considered as classified even if not marked as such. After allegations were raised that some of the emails in question fell into the so-called [...] "born classified" [...] category, an FBI probe was initiated regarding how classified information was handled on the Clinton server. The New York Times reported in February 2016 that nearly 2,100 emails stored on Clinton's server were retroactively marked classified by the State Department. Additionally, the intelligence <b>community's</b> <b>inspector</b> general wrote Congress to say that some of the emails [...] "contained classified State Department information when originated." [...] In May 2016, the inspector general of the State Department criticized her use of a private email server while secretary of state, stating that she had not requested permission for this and would not have received it if she had asked.|$|R
5000|$|Inspektor, Swedish for Inspector, is {{the largely}} honorary {{chairmanship}} {{of a student}} nations in Lund and Uppsala universities in Sweden. The Inspector has a supervisory role his/her nation and presides over most important functions. It is a quite prestigious role {{to be invited to}} undertake as it implies the trust and respect of the student <b>community.</b> The <b>inspector</b> may be of either gender and is usually a professor (although any member of the university's teaching staff is acceptable). The position originated in the 17th century as a way for the university administration to keep watch on the student population after both Uppsala and Lund universities realised that they were unable to forbid the nation system outright.|$|R

As part of an FBI probe {{at the request of the}} IC inspector general, Clinton agreed to turn over her email server to the U.S. Department of Justice, as well as thumb drives containing copies of her work-related emails. Other emails were obtained by the United States House Select Committee on Benghazi from other sources, in connection with the committee's inquiry.

40|$|Nepal has {{a history}} of nearly three decades of public health education. Public health {{graduates}} are working under different capacities at governmental and non governmental organizations. If the health system can utilize this human resource, this will contribute to health system strengthening in Nepal. The objective {{of this paper is to}} explore the opportunities for public health graduates in government health system in Nepal. MoHP needs to expand opportuni-ties for public health graduates in different areas within government system. Recruiting district level supervisors from bachelor in public health background would enhance performance because of their knowledge and skills on areas like district health management, research, public health administration, health economics and medical sociology as compared to those with certificate level education on General medicine currently being recruited. In the meantime this will create hundreds of job placements in district health system for job aspirants. Role of <b>community</b> health <b>inspectors</b> needs to be made clear and sanctioned at the district and peripheral level. Also, there is necessity of environmental health technicians, health educators, health economists and other types of health personnel. It is equally necessary to establish environmental health, occupational health, urban health, health care waste management, mental health and oral health units at district level. The other areas where public health graduates can work as health officers are District Development committee, Municipality, Women and Child office and Water and Sanitation Division Office. Th...|$|R
5000|$|The school claims no {{connection}} with the Masonic order of Knights Templar or with The Da Vinci Code [...] - [...] rather, it is named after the chivalrous medieval order of the Knights Templar, who founded Baldock and built the original 12th-century parish church of St. Mary the Virgin in the town. The motto of the Knights Templar School is [...] "Courage and Courtesy".The school opened {{the day after the}} start of the Second World War in 1939 as the Baldock County Council School and within a week of opening had welcomed evacuee children from Stratford in London; in 1944 a photographer from the Ministry of Information took a series of pictures of students at the school to show the positive way that a typical country school was adjusting to life during wartime. These images showed students having medical examinations, taking part in sports and domestic science lessons, cooking over open fires and cultivating the school's playing field to grow food. By 1949 the school was known as Baldock Secondary Modern School, at which time His Majesty's Inspector for Schools (HMI) found it to be flourishing under the 'dynamic personality' of the Headmaster, Mr Frank Hancock MBE, who had created a 'very happy and active school' with overseas trips, school camps, Sports Days and strong links with the local <b>community.</b> However, the <b>inspectors</b> found the syllabuses to be too ambitious with the school moving forward too quickly, with teaching staff confused by arrangements which were complicated and difficult to manage.|$|R
40|$|Correspondence {{issued by}} the Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Recovery Act) was enacted on February 17, 2009, to help stimulate the United States economy by creating new jobs, as well as saving existing ones, and investing in projects that will provide long-term economic benefits. Estimates show that the Recovery Act's combined spending and tax provisions will cost $ 787 billion over 10 years [...] about $ 207 billion in tax reductions plus about $ 580 billion in additional federal spending. These funds are being provided directly to federal agencies and also distributed to states, localities, other entities, and individuals {{through a combination of}} formula and competitive grants and direct assistance. About $ 280 billion of the funds will be administered through state and local governments. The Recovery Act delineates an important set of responsibilities for the accountability <b>community.</b> The <b>inspectors</b> general across government are expected to audit the programs, grants, and projects funded under the Recovery Act, both within their particular agency or department and collectively. To address the collective oversight at the federal level, the Recovery Act established the Recovery Accountability and Transparency Board to help prevent waste, fraud, and abuse. In addition, the Recovery Act requires the Government Accountability Office (GAO) to perform bimonthly reviews of the use of funds by selected states and localities and to comment on estimates of jobs created or retained in the quarterly reports of Recovery Act fund recipients. GAO was asked to report on the activities of the Recovery Accountability and Transparency Board (the Board), as well as on contract-related information collected from the work GAO has completed thus far in 16 states and the District of Columbia. This report provides GAO's observations to date {{on the extent to which}} (1) the Board is monitoring federal agency contract spending on Recovery Act-related contracts and (2) selected states are using competitive procedures in awarding contracts using Recovery Act funds. To determine the actions taken by the Board, GAO met with representatives of the Board to discuss the initiatives they have taken to monitor the number and types of contracts issued by federal agencies for the Recovery Act and their plans to assess the extent to which laws and regulations are being complied with or circumvented. GAO reviewed available documentation related to the Board's initiatives. The agency also reviewed data reported by federal agencies and states through the Federal Procurement Data System-Next Generation and www. recovery. gov (Recovery. gov) related to federal contracts awarded using Recovery Act funds. To provide observations on selected states' use of competitive procedures in awarding contracts for Recovery Act funds, GAO met with state procurement officials to discuss the contract award process for a sample of contracts in 16 states and the District of Columbia. The contracts GAO discussed with state officials GAOre selected based on a combination ofseveral factors [...] such as dollar value, program risk, and project status [...] that varied among the states; therefore, information reported about contracts cannot be generalized. GAO conducted this performance audit from August 2009 through November 2009 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. The standards require that GAO plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for its findings and conclusions based on its audit objectives. GAO believe the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for its findings and conclusions based on its audit objectives. ...|$|R
