5|$|Double cross hybrids {{result from}} the <b>cross</b> <b>between</b> two {{different}} F1 hybrids (i.e., there are four unrelated grandparents).|$|E
5|$|Equine {{species can}} crossbreed with each other. The most common hybrid is the mule, a <b>cross</b> <b>between</b> a male donkey {{and a female}} horse. With rare exceptions, these hybrids are sterile and cannot reproduce. A related hybrid, a hinny, is a <b>cross</b> <b>between</b> a male horse and a female donkey. Other hybrids include the zorse, a <b>cross</b> <b>between</b> a zebra and a horse and a zonkey or zedonk, a hybrid of a zebra and a donkey. In areas where Grévy's zebras are {{sympatric}} with plains zebras, fertile hybrids do occur.|$|E
5|$|Familiar {{examples}} of equid hybrids are the mule, a <b>cross</b> <b>between</b> a female horse and a male donkey, and the hinny, a <b>cross</b> <b>between</b> a female donkey and a male horse. Pairs of complementary types like the mule and hinny are called reciprocal hybrids.|$|E

5|$|Single cross hybrids {{result from}} the <b>cross</b> <b>between</b> two true-breeding organisms which {{produces}} an F1 hybrid (first filial generation). The <b>cross</b> <b>between</b> two different homozygous lines produces an F1 hybrid that is heterozygous; having two alleles, one contributed by each parent and typically one is dominant and the other recessive. Typically, the F1 generation is also phenotypically homogeneous, producing offspring that are all similar to each other.|$|E
5|$|Three-way cross hybrids {{result from}} the <b>cross</b> <b>between</b> an F1 hybrid and an inbred line.|$|E
5|$|In the 1850s, Stonehenge {{recommended}} a <b>cross</b> <b>between</b> a Beagle and a Scottish Terrier as a retriever. He found the crossbreed to {{be a good}} worker, silent and obedient, but it had the drawback that it was small and could barely carry a hare.|$|E

5|$|The {{less common}} tiglon or tigon is a <b>cross</b> <b>between</b> a lioness and a male tiger. In {{contrast}} to ligers, tigons are often relatively small {{in comparison to}} their parents, because of reciprocal gene effects.|$|E
5|$|Among the Wyandots was {{the legend}} of the hooh-strah-dooh. A <b>cross</b> <b>between</b> what current fiction/legends portray as zombies and vampires, the hooh-strah-dooh was an evil spirit that {{inhabited}} recently dead bodies and caused the corpse to rise and devour the living. The redbud was believed to be an effective ward.|$|E
5|$|Apollo Justice: Ace Attorney is, {{like the}} rest of the Ace Attorney series, a <b>cross</b> <b>between</b> the {{adventure}} game and visual novel genres. The player's goal is to defend their clients in four cases, and prove their innocence. The gameplay is separated into two types of situations: Investigations and trials.|$|E

5|$|Queen Mary 2 is a post-Panamax ship. As a result, Queen Mary 2 must {{circumnavigate}} South America to <b>cross</b> <b>between</b> the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. The {{decision not}} to constrain her size to transit the Panama Canal was taken as Queen Elizabeth 2 only transited once a year, during the world cruise. Cunard decided to pass up the convenience of the occasional passage in favour of a greater passenger capacity.|$|E
5|$|The {{concert in}} Cologne was {{recorded}} and released as an album titled Symphonic Odysseys by Dog Ear Records, Nobuo Uematsu's recording label. It was announced {{to be in}} production on October 26, 2011, and released on December 28, 2011. The artwork for the album features a <b>cross</b> <b>between</b> a sword and a violin on a white background, in the vein of the Symphonic Fantasies album, which had a <b>cross</b> <b>between</b> a violin and a game controller. The cover art was produced by German design house Schech, who earlier provided the artwork for the European release of Symphonic Fantasies. Accompanying the CD is a booklet which contains photos of the concert and discusses the arrangers and compositions included in each song. The album contains everything played at the concert, with the Final Fantasy suite split into three tracks, and the album is split at the intermission into two CDs. Its fourteen tracks have a duration of 1:34:56. While Dog Ear Records published the album in Japan, the album was released in Europe through the online music retailer MAZ-Sound.|$|E
5|$|The game {{received}} generally favorable reviews at launch. Reviewers {{noted the}} precision and craft of its game design. Reviewers compared Videoball to other games including the South Asian board game Carrom, and a <b>cross</b> <b>between</b> Asteroids (1979) and Rocket League (2015). GameSpot reviewer wrote that Videoball was the 2016 equivalent of Rocket League, in that both had idiosyncratic concepts and little prior anticipation, but {{simple and fun}} gameplay.|$|E

5|$|The {{two major}} Limousin hybrids are Brahmousin (a <b>cross</b> <b>between</b> Brahman and Limousin cattle)) and Lim-Flex (a <b>cross</b> <b>between</b> Angus and Limousin cattle), which were both {{developed}} before {{the significance of}} the F94L myostatin variant had been quantified. When Limousins homozygous for the F94L myostatin mutation are used in crossbreeding, only one of the mutations will be inherited (that is, progeny will be heterozygous for the mutation), and a high level of phenotypic uniformity and hybrid vigour would be expected in the progeny. However, breeding using heterozygous animals as parents, which could include purebred Limousins of low percentage Full French content, and Lim-Flex and Brahmousin hybrids that have not been bred to a uniform (homozygous) standard over several generations, would produce progeny with inconsistent carcase characteristics and production value depending upon whether or not the F94L mutation was inherited.|$|E
5|$|The unstacked form is {{a nearly}} square planar, {{extended}} conformation. On the other hand, the stacked conformers have two continuous double-helical domains separated by an angle of about 60° in a right-handed direction. Two {{of the four}} strands stay roughly helical, remaining {{within each of the}} two double-helical domains, while the other two <b>cross</b> <b>between</b> the two domains in an antiparallel fashion.|$|E
5|$|Alcelaphus lelwel x cokii: Known as the Kenya Highland {{hartebeest}} or the Laikipia hartebeest. It is a <b>cross</b> <b>between</b> the Lelwel and Coke's hartebeest. This hybrid {{is lighter}} in colour and larger than Coke's hartebeest. It {{is a light}} buff with reddish-tawny upper parts, and the head is longer than in Coke's hartebeest. Both sexes have horns, which are heavier as well as longer {{than those of the}} parents. It was formerly distributed throughout the western Kenyan highlands, between Lake Victoria and Mount Kenya, but is now believed to be restricted to the Lambwe Valley (south-west Kenya) and Laikipia and nearby regions of west-central Kenya.|$|E

5|$|Camel {{hybridisation}} {{began in}} the first millennium BC. For about a thousand years, Bactrian camels and dromedaries have been successfully bred in regions where they are sympatric to form hybrids with either a long, slightly lopsided hump or two humps – one small and one large. These hybrids are larger and stronger than their parents – they can bear greater loads. A <b>cross</b> <b>between</b> a first generation female hybrid and a male Bactrian camel can also produce a hybrid. Hybrids from other combinations tend to be bad-tempered or runts.|$|E
5|$|Earlier, Riesling was {{sometimes}} {{claimed to have}} originated from wild vines of the Rhine region, without much support to back up that claim. More recently, DNA fingerprinting by Ferdinand Regner indicated that one parent of Riesling is Gouais blanc, known to the Germans as Weißer Heunisch, a variety that, while rare today, was widely grown by the French and German peasantry of the Middle Ages. The other parent is a <b>cross</b> <b>between</b> a wild vine and Traminer. It is presumed that the Riesling was born somewhere in {{the valley of the}} Rhine, since both Heunisch and Traminer have a long documented history in Germany, but with parents from either side of the Adriatic the cross could have happened anywhere on the way.|$|E
5|$|Eddie Izzard as {{the voice}} of Reepicheep, a swashbuckling mouse. Over 100 actors auditioned to voice the character. Izzard {{approached}} Reepicheep as less camp and more of a bloodthirsty assassin with a sense of honour (a <b>cross</b> <b>between</b> Mad Max and a Stormtrooper from Star Wars): Izzard interpreted Reepicheep as someone whose family was killed by the Telmarines. The Narnia series were some of the few books Izzard read as a child, and he cherished them. When discussing Reepicheep to the animators, Adamson told them to rent as many Errol Flynn films as possible. Adamson credits Izzard for making the role his own; beforehand, the director was approaching the character similarly to Puss in Boots in Shrek 2.|$|E
