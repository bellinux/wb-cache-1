50|$|Officially {{designated}} a Site of Nature Conservation Importance in an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, {{much of the}} Worth Way forms an important wildlife corridor supporting {{a wide variety of}} fauna and flora. The former railway cuttings and embankments have been progressively colonised by trees, notably silver birch, ash, hazel and sallow, which have developed into mature woodland. In addition, in areas where chalk was used {{in the construction of the}} railway line, chalk-loving plants such as guelder rose, common spotted orchid, twayblade and wild strawberry have flourished. The trees and plants attract in turn a variety of wildlife, including over two hundred species of insect which feed on the sallow. Butterflies are also <b>common,</b> with <b>brimstones</b> in spring, the white admiral and speckled wood from June followed by meadow brown, ringlet and skippers in high summer.|$|R
60|$|I am, however, unwilling without {{distinct}} {{evidence to}} admit that two complex processes of selection, each requiring the transference of new characters to one sex alone, have been carried on with a multitude of species,--that the males have been rendered more brilliant by beating their rivals, and the females more dull-coloured by having escaped from their enemies. The male, for instance, of the <b>common</b> <b>brimstone</b> butterfly (Gonepteryx), is of a far more intense yellow than the female, though she is equally conspicuous; {{and it does not}} seem probable that she specially acquired her pale tints as a protection, though it is probable that the male acquired his bright colours as a sexual attraction. The female of Anthocharis cardamines does not possess the beautiful orange wing-tips of the male; consequently she closely resembles the white butterflies (Pieris) so common in our gardens; but we have no evidence that this resemblance is beneficial to her. As, on the other hand, she resembles both sexes of several other species of the genus inhabiting various quarters of the world, it is probable that she has simply retained to a large extent her primordial colours.|$|E
60|$|Without {{distinct}} evidence, I am {{unwilling to}} admit that a double process of selection has long been going on with a multitude of species,—the males having been rendered more brilliant by beating their rivals; and the females more dull-coloured by having escaped from their enemies. We may take as an instance the <b>common</b> <b>brimstone</b> butterfly (Gonepteryx), which appears early in the spring before any other kind. The male of this species is of a far more intense yellow than the female, though she is almost equally conspicuous; {{and in this case}} it does not seem probable that she specially acquired her pale tints as a protection, though it is probable that the male acquired his bright colours as a sexual attraction. The female of Anthocharis cardamines does not possess the beautiful orange tips to her wings with which the male is ornamented; consequently she closely resembles the white butterflies (Pieris) so common in our gardens; but we have no evidence that this resemblance is beneficial. On the contrary, as she resembles both sexes of several species of the same genus inhabiting various quarters of the world, it is more probable that she has simply retained to a large extent her primordial colours.|$|E
60|$|Although {{the obscure}} tints {{of the upper}} or under surface of many {{butterflies}} no doubt serve to conceal them, yet we cannot possibly extend this view to the brilliant and conspicuous colours of many kinds, such as our admiral and peacock Vanessæ, our white cabbage-butterflies (Pieris), or the great swallow-tail Papilio which haunts the open fens—for these butterflies are thus rendered visible to every living creature. With these species both sexes are alike; but in the <b>common</b> <b>brimstone</b> butterfly (Gonepteryx rhamni), the male is of an intense yellow, whilst the female is much paler; and in the orange-tip (Anthocharis cardamines) the males alone have the bright orange tips to their wings. In these cases the males and females are equally conspicuous, {{and it is not}} credible that their difference in colour stands in any relation to ordinary protection. Nevertheless {{it is possible that the}} conspicuous colours of many species may be in an indirect manner beneficial, as will hereafter be explained, by leading their enemies at once to recognise them as unpalatable. Even in this case it does not certainly follow that their bright colours and beautiful patterns were acquired for this special purpose. In some other remarkable cases, beauty has been gained for the sake of protection, through the imitation of other beautiful species, which inhabit the same district and enjoy an immunity from attack by being in some way offensive to their enemies.|$|E
60|$|Although {{the obscure}} tints {{both of the}} upper and under sides of many {{butterflies}} no doubt serve to conceal them, yet we cannot extend this view to the brilliant and conspicuous colours on the upper surface of such species as our admiral and peacock Vanessae, our white cabbage-butterflies (Pieris), or the great swallow-tail Papilio which haunts the open fens--for these butterflies are thus rendered visible to every living creature. In these species both sexes are alike; but in the <b>common</b> <b>brimstone</b> butterfly (Gonepteryx rhamni), the male is of an intense yellow, whilst the female is much paler; and in the orange-tip (Anthocharis cardamines) the males alone have their wings tipped with bright orange. Both the males and females in these cases are conspicuous, {{and it is not}} credible that their difference in colour should stand in any relation to ordinary protection. Prof. Weismann remarks (9. 'Einfluss der Isolirung auf die Artbildung,' 1872, p. 58.), that the female of one of the Lycaenae expands her brown wings when she settles on the ground, and is then almost invisible; the male, on the other hand, as if aware of the danger incurred from the bright blue of the upper surface of his wings, rests with them closed; and this shows that the blue colour cannot be in any way protective. Nevertheless, it is probable that conspicuous colours are indirectly beneficial to many species, as a warning that they are unpalatable. For in certain other cases, beauty has been gained through the imitation of other beautiful species, which inhabit the same district and enjoy an immunity from attack by being in some way offensive to their enemies; but then we have to account for the beauty of the imitated species.|$|E

40|$|The {{butterflies}} play dual role, firstly as the pollinator, carries pollen {{from one}} flower {{to another and}} secondly their larvae act as the pest, injurious to various crops. Their 21 species were identified belonging to 3 different families from Kohat, Pakistan during September-December 2008. The reported families Namphalidae covered 33 %, Papilionidae 10 %, and Pieridae 57 % biodiversity of butterflies of Kohat. In Namphalidae included: species belonging to subfamily Nymphalinae, Indian fritillary, Argynnis hyperbius Linnaeus; common castor, Ariadne merione (Cramer); painted lady, Cynthia cardui (Linnaeus); peacock pansy, Junonia almanac Linnaeus; blue pansy, J. orithya Linnaeus; common leopard, Phalantha phalantha (Drury); species belonging to subfamily Satyrinae, white edged rock brown, Hipparchia parisatis (Kollar). In Papilionidae included: subfamily Papilioninae, lime butterfly, Papilio demoleus Linnaeus and common mormon, Pa. polytes Linnaeus. In Pieridae included: subfamily Coliaclinae, dark clouded yellow, Colias croceus (Geoffroy); subfamily Coliadinae, lemon emigrant, Catopsilia pomona Fabricius; little orange tip, C. etrida Boisduval; blue spot arab,Colotis protractus Butler; common grass yellow, Eumera hecab (Linnaeus); <b>common</b> <b>brimstone,</b> Gonepteryx rhamni (Linnaeus); yellow orange tip, Ixias pyrene Linnaeus; subfamily Pierinae, pioneer white butterfly, Belenoi aurota Bingham; Murree green-veined white, Pieris ajaka Moore; large cabbage white, P. brassicae Linnaeus; green-veined white, P. napi (Linnaeus); small cabbage white, P. rapae Linnaeus. The wingspan of collected butterflies, minimum was 25 mm of C. etrida which was the smallest butterfly, however, maximum was 100 mm of P. demoleus and P. polytes which were the largest butterflies. A detail study is required for further exploration of butterflies' fauna of Kohat...|$|E
