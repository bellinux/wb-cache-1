40|$|Some of {{the factors}} {{affecting}} colonisation of a <b>colonisation</b> <b>sampler,</b> the Standard Aufwuchs Unit (S. Auf. U.) were investigated, namely immersion period, whether anchored on the bottom or suspended, {{and the influence of}} riffles. It was concluded that a four-week immersion period was best. S. Auf. U. anchored on the bottom collected both more taxa and individuals than suspended ones. Fewer taxa but more individuals colonised S. Auf. U. in the potamon zone compared to the rhithron zone with a consequent reduction in the values of pollution indexes and diversity. It was concluded that a completely different scoring system was necessary for lowland rivers. Macroinvertebrates colonising S. Auf. U. in simulated streams, lowland rivers and the R. Churnet reflected water quality. A variety of pollution and diversity indexes were applied to results from lowland river sites. Instead of these, it was recommended that an abbreviated species - relative abundance list be used to summarise biological data for use in lowland river surveillance. An intensive study of gastropod populations was made in simulated streams. Lynnaea peregra increased in abundance whereas Potamopyrgas jenkinsi decreased with increasing sewage effluent concentration. No clear-cut differences in reproduction were observed. The presence/absence of eight gastropod taxa was compared with concentrations of various pollutants in lowland rivers. On the basis of all field work it appeared that ammonia, nitrite, copper and zinc were the toxicants most likely to be detrimental to gastropods and that P. jenkinsi and Theodoxus fluviatilis were the least tolerant taxa. 96 h acute toxicity tests of P. jenkinsi using ammonia and copper were carried out in a flow-through system after a variety of static range finding tests. P. jenkinsi was intolerant to both toxicants compared to reports on other taxa and the results suggested that these toxicants would affect distribution of this species in the field...|$|E

40|$|Even though {{endophytic}} fungi {{have been}} studied intensively in the past years, {{little attention has been}} payed to endophytic colonisation of a whole plant. The search part of this work is about the differences in diversity and ecology of endophytes within whole plants, whose single parts represent qualitatively different environments for growth of endophytic fungi. The main difference is between the colonisation of systemic endophytes of grasses from family Clavicipitaceae and the colonisation of taxonomically heterogenous group of non-systemic endophytes. A systemic endophyte colonizes all above-ground organs of grass, while a non-systemic endophytes form only local infections, and their species composition in specific plant parts differs. The practical part of this work encompasses the pilot study of species diversity of endophytic fungi from woody parts (branches, stems and roots) of an elm tree (Ulmus laevis). There are differences in the frequency of <b>colonisation</b> among <b>samples</b> cultivated on agar plates, and also in diversity of isolated fungal genera...|$|R

The aim {{of this study was to}} detect bacterial pathogens via direct amplification and sequencing of the 16 S rDNA gene in samples showing negative culture results as alternative diagnostic tools to troubleshoot difficult samples. Twenty-three (7.66  %) positive samples were detected, most of which were monomicrobial infections; 15 of the cases were identified as HAIs, 6 had catheter colonisation, and 2 had <b>sample</b> <b>colonisation.</b> The pathogens identified included Escherichia, Salmonella, Pseudomonas spp., Enterococcus spp. and coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS). The most frequent infections were bacteraemia and urinary tract infection, but meningitis, warm infection and soft tissue infection were also documented. These findings emphasise the efficacy and usefulness of molecular diagnosis, thus 16 S rDNA gene analysis is strongly indicated by HAIs diagnostics.|$|R
40|$|Modified wood {{can provide}} {{protection}} against {{a range of}} wood deteriorating organisms. Several hypotheses have been put forward regarding the protection mechanisms against wood decaying fungi including fungal enzyme inefficiency due to non-recognition, lower micropore size, and insufficient wood moisture content. The {{aim of this study}} was to obtain new insight into the protection manner of furfuryl alcohol (FA) modified Scots pine sapwood (WFA), and to examine biochemical mechanisms and adaptive changes in gene expression utilised by Postia placenta during early <b>colonisation</b> of WFA. <b>Samples</b> were harvested after 2, 4, and 8 weeks of incubation. After 8 weeks, the mass loss (0. 1 %) and wood moisture content (21. 0 %) was lower inWFA, than in non-modified Scots pine sapwood samples (W), 26. 1 % and 46. 1 %, respectively. Microscopy revealed needle-shaped calcium oxalate crystals, at all harvesting points, most prominently present after 4 and 8 weeks, and only in the WFA samples. Among the findings based on gene profiles were indications of a possible shift toward increased expression, or at least no down regulation, of genes related to oxidative metabolism and concomitant reduction of several genes related to the breakdown of polysaccharides in WFA compared to W...|$|R
40|$|The {{prevalence}} of infection with intestinal spirochaetes in chickens in Western Australia {{was assessed by}} selective culture of faecal <b>samples.</b> <b>Colonisation</b> was common, with 35. 1 % of layer flocks and 53. 3 % of broiler breeder flocks being positive. Spirochaetes were recovered significantly more frequently from flocks with diarrhoea or reduced production than from clinically normal flocks. The genetic identity and diversity of 56 selected isolates from Australia, the USA and Europe were examined using multilocus enzyme electrophoresis: these were divided into six diverse genetic groups. Three groups contained isolates previously shown to be pathogenic for chickens: (i) "Serpulina intermedia ", (ii) an unnamed group (not identified in Australia), and (iii) Serpulina pilosicoli. Most pathogenic isolates from Australia were "S. intermedia ". Day-old broiler chicks were infected orally with Australian isolates either of "S. intermedia" (3), a commonly isolated but unnamed group (3), or S. pilosicoli (1). All spirochaetes induced diarrhoea, but this occurred earlier and more birds were colonised with "S. intermedia" and S. pilosicoli strains than with strains from the unnamed group. Infection of laying hens with an "S. intermedia " strain caused wet faeces and reduced egg production...|$|R
40|$|A {{comparison}} of published estimates of mycorrhizal and dark septate endophyte (DSE) colonisation from various ecosystems suggests that DSE {{may be as}} abundant as mycorrhizal fungi as judged by the proportion of host plants colonised in mixed plant communities, or by the extent of <b>colonisation</b> in <b>sampled</b> root systems. While many strides {{have been made in}} understanding the ecological significance of the mycorrhizal fungi, our knowledge about the role of DSE fungi is in its infancy. In order to provide a framework of testable hypotheses, we review and discuss the most likely functions of this poorly understood group of root-associated fungi. We propose that, like mycorrhizal symbioses, DSE-plant symbioses should be considered multifunctional and not limited to nutrient acquisition and resultant positive host growth responses. Admittedly, many mycorrhizal and endophyte functions, (e. g. stress tolerance, pathogen or herbivore deterrence) are likely to be mediated by improved nutritional status and increased fitness of the host. Accordingly, it is pivotal to establish whether or not the DSE fungi are involved in host nutrient acquisition, either from inorganic and readily soluble sources, or from organic and recalcitrant sources. Facilitation by DSE of the use of organic nitrogen, phosphorus and sulphur sources by plants is a topic that warrants further attention and research. Even {{in the absence of a}} clear nutrient uptake function, the extensive DSE colonisation that occurs is likely to pre-emptively or competitively deter pathogens by minimising the carbon available in host rhizosphere environment. The DSEs’ high melanin levels and their potential production of secondary metabolites toxic or inhibitory to herbivores are also likely to be factors influencing host performance. Finally, the broad host ranges speculated for most DSE fungi thus far suggest that they are candidates for controlling plant community dynamics via differential host responses to colonisation. We emphasise the need for simple experiments that allow unravelling of the basic biological functions of DSE fungi when they colonise their hosts...|$|R
40|$|One way {{to protect}} timber in service against {{basidiomycete}} deterioration is by means of acetylation via reaction with acetic anhydride. The reason why acetylated wood (WAc) is resistant against decay fungi is still not exactly understood. The {{aim of this study}} was to contribute to this field of science, and Postia placenta colonisation after 4, 12, 20, 28 and 36 weeks was observed at Three acetylation levels of Pinus spp. sapwood. Mass loss (ML) and wood moisture content (MC) data reflected the acetylation levels. The initial equilibrium MC (EMC) proved to be a good indicator of subsequent ML. Genomic DNA quantification showed P. placenta <b>colonisation</b> in all <b>samples,</b> also in samples where no ML were detectable. The number of expressed gene transcripts was limited, but the findings supported the results of previous studies: WAc seems to have some resistance against oxidative mechanisms, which are part of the metabolism of P. placenta. This leads to a delay in decay initiation, a delay in Expression of genes involved in enzymatic depolymerisation, and a slower decay rate. The magnitudes of these effects are presented for each acetylation level. The data also imply that there is no absolute decay threshold at high acetylation levels, but instead a significant delay of decay initiation and a slower decay rate...|$|R
40|$|A {{dissertation}} {{submitted to}} the Faculty of Science, University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg, in fulfilment of requirements for the degree of Master of Science. Phytoremeditation of mine tailings provides the most cost-effective means of alleviating their pollutant effects. Research has shown that successful revegetation of mine tailings can be optimised by providing appropriate microbial symbionts for the plants. The {{aim of this study}} was to assess the arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) status of trees currently being used for phytoremediation trials of mine tailings in the Welkom gold fields, and to determine the AM fungal diversity of these sites. The Acacia spp. analysed were growing on rehabilitated gold and uranium mine tailings which had undergone different rehabilitation regimes. Planted acacia trees which had been inoculated with crude AM fungal inocula were present on one mine tailing site as compared to the second mine tailing site on which the acacias were naturally colonisers and the site had been ameliorated with garden refuse. Root and slime samples were collected in early spring and half if each initial sample was used immediately for colonisation analysis and to identify AM fungi through molecular analysis of the small subunit rRNS gene sequences; the other half of each sample was used to produce trap cultures which were used later for colonisation and molecular analysis.

40|$|The lack {{of green}} areas in cities {{is caused by}} the {{increase}} in population and the urbanisation process. Therefore, the solution to increase the urban green spaces lies in their inclusion on structures surfaces. However, existent systems present several disadvantages in terms of installation and maintenance costs, low integration with the structure, extra loads, limitations in their use in rehabilitation, and others. This PhD work aims to provide a first approach to the possibility of using a structure’s surface as biological substratum. Bioreceptivity is the term which defines the ability of a material to be colonised by living organisms. Therefore, bioreceptivity of cementitious materials can be modified by adapting the mix design. Three main properties were considered in this work, including both chemical and physical properties, which are the pH, the porosity and the roughness of mortars. For that purpose, different mixtures were designed by modifying the hydraulic binder (Ordinary Portland Cement and Magnesium Phosphate Cement), the aggregates size (0 / 2 mm and 2 / 4 mm), the water to cement ratio (6 different ratios) and the amount of cement paste (6 different contents). After this first stage, the evaluation of the <b>colonisation</b> of those <b>samples</b> was carried out under both laboratory and environmental conditions. Overall, the results of this doctoral research demonstrated the feasibility of using cementitious materials as biological substratum.

40|$|Abstract Background: Streptococcus agalactiae is {{the leading}} {{infectious}} cause of morbidity among neonates. Majority of early onset neonatal infections can be prevented using antimicrobial prophylaxis during labour. Different diagnostic procedures can be employed to detect maternal colonization during pregnancy and labour. In the present study we analysed diagnostic characteristics of two common methods for detection of S. agalactiae. Methods: One hundred and one consecutive vaginal or combined vaginal-rectal swabs were included in this prospective study. All samples were tested with enrichment culture and molecular illumigene GBS assay. Results of repeatedly disconcordant samples were retested and confirmed with a different molecular assay. Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predicted values were determined for both assays. Results: Mean age of women was 33 years. Prevalence of <b>colonisation</b> in the <b>sample</b> was 23, 8 %. Positivity rates using enrichment culture only, illumigene GBS assay only and combination of both assays were 19, 8 %, 22, 7 % and 23, 8 %, respectively. Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values were 83, 3 %, 100 %, 100 % in 95, 1 % for enrichment culture and 95, 8 %, 100 %, 100 % in 98, 7 % for illumigene GBS assay, respectively. Combining both methods 20 % more colonized women were detected compared to enrichment culture alone. Conclusions: With a combination of enrichment culture and illumigene GBS assay we can detect substantially more colonized women compared to currently most frequently used method of enrichment culture. Comprehensive evaluation of current strategies for prevention of S. agalactiae early neonatal infection is warranted in Slovenia.  </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to understand the mechanisms that control spontaneous plant colonisation on severely eroded slopes in a semiarid badland area of East Spain. More specifically, we aimed at (1) determining topographic thresholds for plant colonisation, (2) identifying the soil properties that limit plant establishment and (3) identifying plant traits that enable colonising species to cope with these limitations. We used slope angle and aspect as surrogates of erosion rate and water availability respectively. Since soil erosion and water availability can limit plant establishment and both interact in the landscape, we analysed variations in colonisation success with slope angle and aspect. Vegetation success was measured in terms of total vegetation cover on 156 different slopes. After determining slope angle thresholds for plant <b>colonisation,</b> soil was <b>sampled</b> on slopes just above and just below the threshold values for soil analysis in order to test for differences in soil properties related to plant establishment and development. Plant traits related to plant colonising capacity were analysed in two different groups of species: the group of species colonising the steep slopes near the threshold and the group of noncolonising species present on more gentie slopes but unable to colonise the slopes just below the threshold. The identified slope angle threshold values for plant colonisation clearly decreased from North to South. No differences were found in soil properties neither among slope aspects at the slope angle threshold values nor between slope positions (just below and above the threshold) within slope aspect classes. Long-distance dispersal mechanisms and ability of seeds to segregate mucilage in contact with water were more frequent characteristics in colonising species than in non-colonising ones. It is concluded that water availability for plants which, in turn, is controlled by the solar radiation can explain the differences in the slope angle threshold values for plant colonisation among slope aspect classes. Some important implications of these results in the context of ecological restoration of these severely eroded areas are also discussed. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|As {{international}} travel is rapidly increasing, {{more people are}} being exposed to potentially more antibiotic resistant bacteria, a changed infectious disease epidemiology, and {{an increased risk of}} accidents and crime. Research-based advice is needed to adequately inform travellers about these risks. We studied travellers who sought advice from the Travel Medicine Clinic at the Department of Infectious Diseases, Umeå University Hospital, as well as university students from Umeå, Stockholm, and Gothenburg travelling abroad for study, research, and clinical exchange programs. From retrospective data at the Travel Medicine Clinic, we found that pre-existing health problems were rare among travellers from Umeå seeking pre- travel health advice and vaccinations. In addition, we found that the travel destination and the sex of the traveller affected vaccination levels. Although hepatitis A is endemic to both Thailand and Turkey, compared to travellers to Thailand few travellers to Turkey visited the clinic for hepatitis A vaccination. The data also revealed that more women than men were vaccinated against Japanese encephalitis despite comparable trips. A prospective survey study showed that travellers felt that the pre-travel health advice they received was helpful. Two-thirds of the travellers followed the advice given although they still fell ill to the same extent as those who were not compliant with the advice. Factors outside the control of travellers likely affect the travel-related morbidity. Compared to older travellers, younger travellers were less compliant with advice, fell ill to a greater extent, and took greater risks during travel. In a prospective survey study, we found that healthcare students had higher illness rates and risk exposure when abroad compared to students from other disciplines. This difference was mainly {{due to the fact that}} healthcare students more often travelled to developing regions during their study period abroad. When abroad, half of all students increased their alcohol consumption and this was linked to an increased risk of theft and higher likelihood of meeting a new sex partner. The healthcare students participating in the survey study also submitted stool samples before and after travel. These samples were tested for the presence of antibiotic resistance, both by selective culturing for ESBL-PE (Extended-Spectrum Beta-Lactamase Producing Enterobacteriaceae) as well as by metagenomic sequencing. About one-third (35 %) of the students became colonised by ESBL-PE following their study abroad. The strongest risk factor for colonisation was travel destination; for example, 70 % of students who had travelled to India became colonised. Antibiotic treatment during travel was also a significant risk factor for <b>colonisation.</b> The stool <b>samples</b> from a subset of study subjects were analysed using metagenomic sequencing. From this we learned that although the majority of resistance genes in the gut microbiome remained unchanged following travel, several clinically important resistance genes increased, most prominently genes encoding resistance to sulphonamide, trimethoprim, and beta-lactams. Overall, taxonomic changes associated with travel were small but the proportion of Proteobacteria, which includes several clinically important bacteria (e. g., Enterobacteriaceae), increased in a majority of the study subjects. Clearly, there are risks associated with {{international travel}} and these risks include outside factors as well as the personal behaviour of travellers. We believe our results can be used to develop better pre-travel advice for tourists as well as university students studying abroad resulting in safer travel...|$|R
40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to determine the effect of three different pesticides, three tomato cultivars, and two mustard biofumigants on the establishment and survival of four species of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (Acaulospora capsicula, A. laevis, Funneliformis mosseae and Scutellospora calospora). In vitro spore germination of the four AMF species at standard rates of two fungicides (carbendazim and captan), the insecticide chlorpyrifos, or water (control) was observed weekly for 21 days. After 21 days higher germination was observed for S. calospora spores compared with F. mosseae, A. capsicula and A. laevis, but no differences were observed between the pesticide treatments and the control. The response of the four AMF species to carbendazim applied as a foliar spray, and captan and chlorpyrifos applied as soil drenches, was tested by examining the presence/ absence of colonisation (18 days post application) in tomato roots samples, grown in low P potting mix. Tomato growth responses (shoot height and diameter and root and shoot dry weight) were also measured. Fewer tomato roots treated with carbendazim and captan were colonised compared with chlorpyrifos and non-treatment control. A second experiment observed the response of two AMF species (F. mosseae and S. calospora) to the three pesticides on tomatoes grown in silt loam harvested at 10 and 28 days post application. At the first harvest there were no differences in tomato growth in response to the pesticide treatments, but the plants inoculated with AMF were larger than the non-inoculated controls in all tomato growth measures. Scutellospora calospora root colonisation at the first harvest was negatively affected by carbendazim and chlorpyrifos compared to F. mosseae. At the second harvest growth measures were affected by both AMF species and pesticides, with all showing increased growth in the AMF inoculated tomatoes compared to the control, and most showed increased growth in response to carbendazim and chlorpyrifos compared to captan and the non-treatment control. At the second harvest F. mosseae had fewer colonised roots than S. calospora and the non-inoculated control, and the chlorpyrifos treatment decreased colonisation overall. The effect of the four species of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi on three cultivars of tomato, Moneymaker and Aunt Ruby’s German Green and Sweet 100 was studied by examining growth responses and the presence/ absence of <b>colonisation</b> of root <b>samples</b> after 6 and 9 weeks. AMF had no effect on tomato growth at 6 weeks, but at 9 weeks shoot dry weights were lower for F. mosseae and S. calospora. Root colonisation in Sweet 100 was higher than Moneymaker and Aunt Ruby’s German Green. Two mustards (Caliente 199 and Brassica juncea) were grown in silt loam for 35 days before being mulched and incorporated into the top 100 mm of silt loam in 4 L containers. AMF spores, sealed in micromesh bags, were buried at within the mulch layer (50 mm deep) and below the mulch layer (150 mm deep) for 14 days before being recovered and tested for in vitro germination, their ability to colonise and effect on the growth of Moneymaker tomatoes. Fewer Acaulospora capsicula spores were recovered in the Caliente 199 and mustard treatments compared with the non-treatment control. Germination of A. capsicula spores recovered from below the mulch was higher than for those recovered from within the mulch, whilst the opposite was seen for A. laevis. Spores buried below the mulch in the mustard treatment produced taller tomato plants than spores in the Caliente 199 and non-treatment control; and spores buried within the mulch had taller plants than the spores buried below the mulch in the Caliente 199 treatment, but no other differences in tomato growth were observed. A higher number of roots were colonised by AMF spores recovered after burial within the mulch compared with below the mulch. This study has demonstrated the resilience of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi and mycorrhizal associations to horticultural management practices. Neither the pesticides or biofumigant treatments had any permanent effect on the AMF species, nor did the three cultivars show affiliation for a particular AMF species...|$|R
