25|$|Fully {{autonomous}} only {{appeared in}} the second half of the 20th century. The first digitally operated and programmable robot, the Unimate, was installed in 1961 to lift hot pieces of metal from a die <b>casting</b> <b>machine</b> and stack them. Commercial and industrial robots are widespread today and used to perform jobs more cheaply, more accurately and more reliably, than humans. They are also employed in some jobs which are too dirty, dangerous, or dull to be suitable for humans. Robots are widely used in manufacturing, assembly, packing and packaging, mining, transport, earth and space exploration, surgery, weaponry, laboratory research, safety, and the mass production of consumer and industrial goods.|$|E
500|$|Hot-chamber die casting, {{also known}} as {{gooseneck}} machines, rely upon a pool of molten metal to feed the die. At {{the beginning of the}} cycle the piston of the machine is retracted, which allows the molten metal to fill the [...] "gooseneck". The pneumatic- or hydraulic-powered piston then forces this metal out of the gooseneck into the die. The advantages of this system include fast cycle times (approximately 15 cycles a minute) and the convenience of melting the metal in the <b>casting</b> <b>machine.</b> The disadvantages of this system are that it is limited to use with low-melting point metals and that aluminium cannot be used because it picks up some of the iron while in the molten pool. Therefore, hot-chamber machines are primarily used with zinc-, tin-, and lead-based alloys.|$|E
500|$|Two dies {{are used}} in die casting; one is called the [...] "cover die half" [...] and the other the [...] "ejector die half". Where they meet is called the parting line. The cover die {{contains}} the sprue (for hot-chamber machines) or shot hole (for cold-chamber machines), which allows the molten metal to flow into the dies; this feature matches up with the injector nozzle on the hot-chamber machines or the shot chamber in the cold-chamber machines. The ejector die contains the ejector pins and usually the runner, which is the path from the sprue or shot hole to the mold cavity. The cover die is secured to the stationary, or front, platen of the <b>casting</b> <b>machine,</b> while the ejector die {{is attached to the}} movable platen. The mold cavity is cut into two cavity inserts, which are separate pieces that can be replaced relatively easily and bolt into the die halves.|$|E

50|$|Four single-strand curved mold <b>casting</b> <b>machines</b> <b>cast</b> around 3000 {{tons per}} day. Only two <b>casting</b> <b>machines</b> will {{normally}} <b>cast</b> {{at one time}} and many people questioned the need for four units. McLouth felt that the third caster is there for coordination reasons while the fourth is a reserve for maintenance shutdowns. Ladles are moved by overhead bridge cranes to the <b>casting</b> <b>machines</b> which can handle two at a time.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the Steelmaking and Casting phases of a real {{integrated}} plant. We focus on the scheduling of the <b>casts</b> on the <b>machines</b> {{of the process and}} on the cranes that perform the internal transport. The casting phase is made by Continuous Casting and Ingot <b>Casting</b> <b>machines.</b> A Mixed Integer Linear Programming model is presented for the schedule of operations, with the objective of minimizing the makespan. The model is divided into four sub-models: the steelmaking and casting processes, the cranes, the continuous <b>casting</b> <b>machines</b> and the ingot <b>casting</b> <b>machines.</b> An example is presented to show the application of the proposed model...|$|R
500|$|Gill Sans' {{technical}} production followed Monotype's {{standard method}} of the period. The characters were drawn on paper in large plan diagrams by the experienced drawing office team, led and trained by American engineer Frank Hinman Pierpont and Fritz Steltzer, {{both of whom}} Monotype had recruited from the German printing industry. The drawing staff who executed the design was disproportionately female {{and in many cases}} recruited from the local area and the nearby Reigate art school; they worked out many aspects of the final drawings including adaptations of the letters to different sizes and the spacing. The diagrams were then used as a plan for machining metal punches by pantograph to stamp matrices, which would be loaded into a <b>casting</b> <b>machine</b> to cast type. It was Monotype's standard practice at the time to first engrave a limited number of characters and print proofs (some of which survive) from them to test overall balance of colour and spacing on the page, before completing the remaining characters. Walter Tracy, Rhatigan and Gill's biographer Malcolm Yorke have written that the drawing office's work has not been fully appreciated; Yorke described Gill as [...] "tactless" [...] in his claims that the design was [...] "as much as possible mathematically measurable... as little reliance as possible should be placed on the sensibility of the draughtsmen and others concerned in its machine facture".|$|E

2500|$|The first {{digitally}} operated and programmable robot {{was invented}} by George Devol in 1954 and was ultimately called the Unimate. This ultimately laid {{the foundations of the}} modern robotics industry. Devol sold the first Unimate to General Motors in 1960, and it was installed in 1961 in a plant in Trenton, New Jersey to lift hot pieces of metal from a die <b>casting</b> <b>machine</b> and stack them. [...] Devol's patent for the first digitally operated programmable robotic arm represents the foundation of the modern robotics industry.|$|E

50|$|Molten metal is {{tapped into}} the ladle from furnaces. After {{undergoing}} any ladle treatments, such as alloying and degassing, and {{arriving at the}} correct temperature, the ladle is transported {{to the top of}} the <b>casting</b> <b>machine.</b> Usually the ladle sits in a slot on a rotating turret at the <b>casting</b> <b>machine.</b> One ladle is in the 'on-cast' position (feeding the <b>casting</b> <b>machine)</b> while the other is made ready in the 'off-cast' position, and is switched to the casting position when the first ladle is empty.|$|E
50|$|It is {{here that}} the design of {{continuous}} casting machines may vary. This describes a 'curved apron' casting machine; vertical configurations are also used. In a curved apron <b>casting</b> <b>machine,</b> the strand exits the mold vertically (or on a near vertical curved path) and as it travels through the spray-chamber, the rollers gradually curve the strand towards the horizontal. In a vertical <b>casting</b> <b>machine,</b> the strand stays vertical as it passes through the spray-chamber. Molds in a curved apron <b>casting</b> <b>machine</b> can be straight or curved, depending on the basic design of the machine.|$|E

50|$|Die casting {{technology}} {{was developed in}} the United States in 1920. However, the machines produced there failed to meet the requirements of Bühler. As a result, Bühler started designing and constructing its own die <b>casting</b> <b>machines.</b> A special department was set up for this purpose in 1927. This is where today’s Die Casting business unit originated, which sells cold-chamber die <b>casting</b> <b>machines</b> and systems.|$|R

Type metal, an alloy of lead, tin and antimony (with sometimes traces of copper) is used for casting hand-set type in letterpress printing and hot foil blocking. Traditionally cast in hand jerk moulds now predominantly die cast after the industrialisation of the type foundries.
