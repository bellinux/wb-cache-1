The significant scale of occupational exposure to <b>cytostatics</b> in Poland is confirmed by the data collected in the Central Register of Data on Exposure to Carcinogenic or Mutagenic Substances, Mixtures, Agents or Technological Processes, maintained by the Nofer Institute of Occupational Medicine, Łódź, Poland. The issue of occupational risk assessment of exposure to <b>cytostatics</b> gives raise to numerous concerns. Polish regulations concerning health protection of employees occupationally exposed to <b>cytostatics</b> are not unequivocal, as they are derived from different areas of the law, especially those applying to hazard classification, labeling and preparation of safety data sheets for <b>cytostatics.</b> There are neither binding occupational exposure limits legally set for active compounds of antineoplastic drugs nor methods for monitoring of these substances concentrations in a worker’s breathing zone and biological material. This prevents the employer to carry out the correct assessment of occupational exposure, the results of which are the basis for preparing the proper preventive strategy. In this article the consequences of amendments to the European chemical legislation for employers responsible for adequate protection of health and life of employees exposed to <b>cytostatics,</b> were discussed, as well as some legal changes aimed at a better health and life protection of workers exposed to <b>cytostatics</b> in a workplace were proposed.

25|$|Ciclosporin binds to the cytosolic protein cyclophilin (immunophilin) of lymphocytes, {{especially}} T cells. This {{complex of}} ciclosporin and cyclophilin inhibits calcineurin, which, under normal circumstances, {{is responsible for}} activating the transcription of interleukin 2. In T-cells, activation of the T-cell receptor normally increases intracellular calcium, which acts via calmodulin to activate calcineurin. Calcineurin then dephosphorylates the transcription factor nuclear factor of activated T-cells (NFATc), which moves to {{the nucleus of the}} T-cell and increases the activity of genes coding for IL-2 and related cytokines. Ciclosporin prevents the dephosphorylation of NF-AT by binding to cyclophilin. It also inhibits lymphokine production and interleukin release and, therefore, leads to a reduced function of effector T-cells. It does not affect <b>cytostatic</b> activity.|$|E

The authors propose that miR-1 and miR-133a act to repress isoforms of genes that are not normally expressed in muscle cells.

40|$|Abstract Background DNA {{methylation}} is an epigenetic phenomenon {{known to}} play an important role in the development of cancers, including colorectal cancer (CRC). Aberrant methylation of promoter regions of genes is potentially reversible, and if methylation is important for cancer survival, demethylation should do the opposite. To test this we have addressed the hypothesis that DNA methyltransferase inhibitors (DNMTi), decytabine and zebularine, potentiate inhibitory effects of classical anti-CRC <b>cytostatics,</b> oxaliplatin and 5 -fluorouracil (5 -FU), on survival of CRC cells in vitro. Results Isobole and median effect analysis revealed that decytabine shows potent synergistic interaction with oxaliplatin and 5 -FU and that this is probably not the class effect of DNMTi as zebularine shows strong antagonistic interaction with oxaliplatin. The synergistic combination treatment was also applied to the cultures to investigate their mechanisms of action. We have shown that combinations of decytabine with <b>cytostatics</b> produced dose-dependent growth inhibition and treatment-induced apoptosis. Conclusion The observed synergism between decytabine and <b>cytostatics</b> is most probably related to the augmented apoptotic signal and allowed for significant (both biologically and statistically) reduction of the cytotoxic doses of <b>cytostatics</b> used. </p...|$|R

Cisplatin, as a first substance discovered in this group of <b>cytostatics,</b> was originally registered for the treatment of testicular cancer and ovarian cancer, but it is currently used in many other indications. The limiting factor associated with the administration of cisplatin is represented by adverse effects and the development of resistance in previously sensitive tumor cells.

Concurrently, collagen synthesis was severely impaired, as indicated by sustained decreased hydroxyproline concentrations and content. The lower dose of <b>cytostatics</b> showed essentially similar effects on hydroxyproline parameters, but affected anastomotic strength less dramatically. The data indicate that, while intraperitoneal chemotherapy may show less detrimental systemic toxicity and thus allow higher doses, its application as an adjunct to gastrointestinal surgery may be limited because of its severe effects on anastomotic repair...|$|R
