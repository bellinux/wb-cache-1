5|$|The Open Cup is {{not held}} in as high regard as the MLS Cup, {{but it is}} still an {{important}} achievement. For Philadelphia, it represented their first-ever <b>chance</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> trophy, whereas Seattle had been to the finals five times in the club's six-year history. With a victory, the Sounders would tie the Fire with four overall wins by an MLS team.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the player}} has no direct {{control over the}} patients, they have some {{influence}} over whether to evict them from the hospital and in determining {{what to do with}} them when given a choice by the staff. The player can pick up any staff member in the building and move them (mainly to reassign them to another room or send them to get rest), or dismiss them if they argue about pay or are no longer required. The player may force patients to take a <b>chance</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> cure for their suspected disease before diagnosis is complete (at the risk of killing the patient), and rearrange queues.|$|E
5|$|At Survivor Series, Kane {{tried to}} get Edge to bring Paul Bearer out to them but Edge brought out an empty wheelchair. Kane tried to {{interrogate}} Edge during their fight but in the end, Edge unknowingly double pinned his rival, keeping Kane as World Heavyweight Champion before wheeling Kane into a barricade. On November 26, Edge was offered a <b>chance</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> rematch with Kane for the title if we would let Bearer go free. But Edge did not keep his word. At {{the end of the}} night, Edge lured Kane outside and drove over a dummy of Paul Bearer before driving off with the real one again.|$|E

50|$|To {{increase}} their sons <b>chances</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> successful racing career, the Verhagen family moved form Ridgefield, Connecticut to Mooresville, North Carolina in 2014. The family exchanged the WKA scene for the United States Pro Kart Series.|$|R
5|$|BMC {{came to the}} Giro {{without a}} real overall {{classification}} hopeful. Sporting director Fabio Baldato stated that the team's nine-man squad was designed {{to give them a}} <b>chance</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> stage win every day, with Kristoff for the sprints, Kohler, Wyss, and Zahner for the breakaways, and Tschopp and Frank for the climbs. Rounding out the squad were young Americans Barton, Beyer, and Butler, riding the Giro mainly for experience. They constituted three of the seven Americans in the Giro peloton. The team's preparation for the Giro was also affected by the Mantova investigation, which resulted in the team's banning of Ballan and Santambrogio for the second time, after a previous ban in April 2010. Again just as in 2010, the two were reactivated shortly after the Giro concluded.|$|E
5|$|Chesbro {{met with}} Highlanders owner Frank J. Farrell and new manager Harry Wolverton in February 1912 about {{attempting}} a comeback. Wolverton {{agreed to give}} Chesbro a chance at pitching for the Highlanders. However, before leaving for camp he reconsidered and released Chesbro. Chesbro's request for reinstatement {{as a free agent}} was granted in March, while the Highlanders granted him his unconditional release. Chesbro decided to travel to Hot Springs, Arkansas, where teams participated in spring training, in an attempt to find a team willing to give him a <b>chance</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> comeback. He worked out with Brooklyn and Pittsburgh, but both teams passed on him.|$|E
5|$|In clock-limited sports, games {{often end}} with a team that holds the lead killing the clock rather than {{competing}} aggressively against the opposing team. In contrast, baseball has no clock; a team cannot win without getting the last batter out and rallies are not constrained by time. At almost any turn in any baseball game, the most advantageous strategy is some form of aggressive strategy. In contrast, again, the clock comes into play even {{in the case of}} multi-day Test and first-class cricket: the possibility of a draw often encourages a team that is batting last and well behind to bat defensively, giving up any faint <b>chance</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> win to avoid a loss. Baseball offers no such reward for conservative batting.|$|E
50|$|In 2008, Scirrotto {{committed}} a crucial pass interference penalty {{late in the}} 4th quarter against the University of Iowa that cost Penn State <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>at</b> <b>an</b> undefeated season and a possible birth in the National Championship Game.|$|R

5|$|In {{the police}} station, Lucas offers to bribe Roberts, but is rebuffed. Instead, Roberts offers Lucas a <b>chance</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> shorter jail {{sentence}} if he aids his investigation of dirty cops in the NYPD and Lucas duly provides Roberts with the names. In the end, {{three quarters of}} the New York DEA are arrested and convicted, and a distraught Trupo commits suicide. Roberts, having just passed the bar exam, defends Lucas as his first client. Lucas is sentenced to 70 years in prison, of which he serves 15 years and is released in 1991.|$|E
5|$|Max and Steph become {{attracted}} to each other. Max plunges into grief and remorse for bringing estranged wife Clare Cunningham (Gemma Bissix) {{into the lives}} of the people he cares about. Steph feels sorry for him and invites him out. Max tries to kiss her. Steph and Max began to misread each other and, even as they developed feelings for each other, assume there is no <b>chance</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> relationship. When Max took Tom to the safari park to see an elephant named Romeo, that Steph had sponsored for him, Steph found him and they finally told each other that they liked each other and agreed to get into a relationship. Tom initially disapproves of their relationship, but comes around to the idea.|$|E

50|$|On October 26, 2010, the Giants {{defeated}} the Cowboys in Cowboys Stadium 41-35, leaving the Cowboys <b>at</b> <b>a</b> disappointing 1-5 for the year. This contest is notable for the Giants linebacker Michael Boley driving Tony Romo to the turf and causing Romo {{to break his}} left clavicle and most likely ending the Cowboys <b>chances</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> playoff run.|$|R
25|$|The rival Florida State Seminoles {{defeated}} the Gators 24–21, seemingly ending Florida's <b>chance</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> national title. For {{the first time}} in series history, both squads were an undefeated 10–0. The Seminoles scored 17 straight points in the first quarter and Warrick Dunn rushed for a career-best 185 yards.|$|E
25|$|Keres {{narrowly}} {{missed a}} <b>chance</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> world championship match on five occasions. He won the 1938 AVRO tournament, {{which led to}} negotiations for a title match against champion Alexander Alekhine, but the match never took place due to World War II. After the war Keres was runner-up in the Candidates' Tournament on four consecutive occasions.|$|E
25|$|Estonian and Soviet chess {{grandmaster}} Paul Keres {{was among}} the world's top players from the mid-1930s to the mid-1960s. He narrowly missed a <b>chance</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> World Chess Championship match on five occasions. Estonian Markko Märtin was successful in the World Rally Championship in the early 2000, where he got five wins and 18 podiums, {{as well as a}} third place in the 2004 standings.|$|E
500|$|Texas' narrow win versus Arkansas State in weekone, {{together}} with TCU's victory over Baylor, fueled {{speculation that the}} 2007 Horned Frogs might have <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>at</b> <b>an</b> upset victory over the Longhorns. [...] Texas dropped threeplaces to numberseven in the AP Poll and the Coaches Poll, while TCU moved up threeplaces to numbernineteen.|$|R

However, the U.S. team was disqualified for passing out of the zone, and Sime lost his <b>chance</b> <b>at</b> <b>an</b> Olympic gold medal. During his career, he held world records at 100 yards, 220 yards, and the 220 yd low hurdles.|$|R

25|$|The London Boroughs of Harrow and Brent contain {{significant}} Irish Traveller populations. In {{addition to}} those on various official sites {{there are a number}} who are settled in local authority housing.

They and the children may or may not travel in the summer but remain in close contact with the wider Traveller community.|$|E
25|$|St Kilda made a {{good start}} to the 1999 premiership season after {{progressing}} to the top four in Round 10. Their form, however, then faded and by the season's end conclusion they would finish 10th on the ladder. St Kilda's final home game for premiership points at Waverley Park was the Round 20 match on 14 August 1999, a 25-point loss to North Melbourne which ended their <b>chance</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> third consecutive finals campaign in a row since 1997.|$|E

25|$|Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? smashes these {{conventions}} and shows realistic {{families that are}} far from perfect and possibly ruined. The families of Honey and Martha were dominated by their fathers, there being {{no sign of a}} mother-figure in their lives. George and Martha's <b>chance</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> perfect family was ruined by infertility and George's failure at becoming a prominent figure at the university. Being just a few of many, these examples directly challenge social expectations both within and outside of a family setting.|$|E
25|$|At the 1989 Masters, Norman {{missed a}} 12-foot par putt on the 72nd hole {{which would have}} put him into a playoff with Nick Faldo and Scott Hoch. Norman had another <b>chance</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> major in 1989, this time at the Open Championship at Royal Troon. He played a final-round of 64, {{starting}} his round with six straight birdies, to force his way into a playoff with Mark Calcavecchia and Wayne Grady. Going into the final playoff hole, Norman and Calcavecchia were tied, but two successive bunker shots by Norman gave Calcavecchia the victory.|$|E
25|$|Crosby {{missed a}} 61-yard field goal {{to wind up}} the opening drive for the Buffaloes {{in the second half}} (he had made it when the play {{initially}} went but it was whistled dead because Colorado State had taken a timeout – {{it would have been the}} longest of his career). Colorado State's Jason Smith missed a 34-yard field goal in the fourth quarter. Colorado failed to answer the Rams in the second half. The defense played quite well, recording many sacks and limiting the Rams. The missed field goal and missed <b>chance</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> field goal along with a near perfect performance by Hanie proved costly to the Buffaloes.|$|E
