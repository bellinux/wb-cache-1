40|$|The present {{work has}} {{the merit of}} {{exploring}} an insight into the activation of defence genes of Quercus suber during response to infection by Phytophthora cinnamomi. Thus, cDNA-AFLP methodology was used to identify gene fragments differentially present in the mRNA profiles of host cells of micropropagated Q. suber plantlets roots infected with zoospores of P. cinnamomi at different post challenge time points. Six candidate genes were selected based on their interesting cDNA-AFLP expression patterns and homology to genes known {{to play a role}} in defence. These six genes encode a cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase 2 (QsCAD 2), a protein disulphide isomerase (QsPDI), a CC-NBS-LRR resistance protein (QsRPc), thaumatin-like protein (QsTLP), chitinase (QsCHI) and a 1, 3 -beta glucanase (QsGLU). The current work has been successful in evaluation of the expression of these genes by qRT-PCR. Data analysis revealed that transcript levels of QsRPc, QsCHI, QsCAD 2 and QsPDI increased during the early hours of inoculation, while transcript profiles of thaumatin-like protein showed decreasing. No expression was detected for 1, 3 -beta-glucanase (QsGLU). Furthermore, the choice of suitable reference genes in any new experimental system is absolutely crucial in qRT-PCR; for this reason in this study and for the first time a set of potential reference genes were analyzed and validated for qRT-PCR normalization in the patho-system Phytophthora-Q. suber. Four candidate reference genes polimerase II (QsRPII), eukaryotic translation initiation factor 5 A(QsEIF- 5 A), b-tubulin (QsTUB) and a medium subunit family protein of Clathrin adaptor complexes (QsCACs) were evaluated to determine the most stable internal references in Q. suber. Analysis of stability of genes was carried out using Genex software. Results indicated all these four potential reference genes assumed stable expression. Data analysis revealed that QsRPII and QsCACs were the two most stable genes, while genes QsTUB and QsEIF- 5 A were the third and the fourth most stable gene, respectively. In this study, a plasmid-based quantitative PCR method was developed to measure P. cinnamomi colonization during infection process of Q. suber. Plasmid-based detection of P. cinnamomi showed a gradual accumulation of the pathogen DNA in <b>cork</b> oak root <b>tips</b> up to 24 h post infection. The higher increase in P. cinnamomi/plasmid DNA ratio occurred between 18 and 24 h. One of the primary objectives of this research was to study the effect of cinnamomins (elicitins secreted by P. cinnamomin) on inducing defence mechanism against the pathogen, as recent histological and ultra-structural studies showed that P. cinnamomi was restricted to the outer cortex root fragments pre-treated with capsicien and cryptogein, suggesting that elicitins can stimulate plant defence reactions against P. cinnamomi. To complement these studies and to have a clear view of the nature of the interaction, the role of cinnamomins in the production of the oxidative burst [ROS and ROS scavenging enzymes such as superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and peroxidase (POD) ] and in the defence responses was evaluated. Cork oak seedlings were pretreated with alpha-cinnamomin and then inoculated with P. cinnamomi mycelia. Results showed a significant higher production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) (H 2 O 2 and O 2 •-) in elicitin and non-elicitin treated roots in interaction with P. cinnamomi in comparison to the corresponding control. The plant group inoculated with the pathogen after cinnamomin treatment showed an earlier increase in H 2 O 2 production but this was lower as compared with that group inoculated with P. cinnamomi alone. Also, in elicitin pre-treated group generally, a lower level of O 2 •− production during infection was observed as compared with inoculated roots with P. cinnamomi alone without elicitin treatment. Furthermore, in this study, we evaluated activities of antioxidant enzymes upon challenge with P. cinnamomi, with and without pretreatment with alpha cinnamomin. Results indicated that the activities of defense enzymes POD, SOD and CAT increased after P. cinnamomi inoculation when compared with those in the control group. Also, in the group treated with alpha-cinnamomin followed by P. cinnamomi inoculation, a higher level of enzymatic activities was detected as compared with elicitin non-treated group, which suggest the protective effect of alpha-cinnamomin against the pathogen due to higher elevated levels of defense enzymes POD, SOD and CAT during the infection period. Furthermore, a sensitive qPCR method was applied to measure the pathogen biomass in elicited and non-elicited Q. suber roots challenged with P. cinnamomi to elucidate the effect of cinnamomins on the colonization of P. cinnamomi. Plasmid-based quantification of P. cinnamomi showed a significant decrease in accumulation of the pathogen DNA in cork oak roots after treatment with alpha and beta-cinnamomins which attest the role of cinnamomins in promoting defense responses in cork oak against P. cinnamomi invasion. O presente trabalho tem o mérito de produzir conhecimento sobre a ativação de genes de defesa de Quercus suber durante a resposta à infecção por Phytophthora cinnamomi. Assim, a metodologia de cDNA-AFLP foi usada para identificar os fragmentos de genes diferencialmente presentes nos perfis de mRNA de células hospedeiras das raízes das plântulas micropropagadas de Q. suber infectadas com zoósporos de P. cinnamomi, a diferentes tempos após o contacto com o agente patogénico. Seis genes candidatos foram selecionados com base nos padrões de expressão interessantes revelados por cDNA-AFLP e na homologia com genes conhecidos por desempenharem um papel na defesa. Estes seis genes codificam uma cinamil álcool desidrogenase 2 (QsCAD 2), uma proteína isomerase dissulfureto (QsPDI), uma proteína de resistência CC-NBS-LRR (QsRPc), uma proteína do tipo taumatina (QsTLP), uma quitinase (QsCHI) e uma 1, 3 -beta-glucanase (QsGLU). O presente trabalho foi bem-sucedido na avaliação da expressão destes genes por qRT-PCR. A análise dos dados revelou que os níveis de transcrição de QsRPc, QsCHI, QsCAD 2 e QsPDI aumentaram durante as primeiras horas pós-inoculação, enquanto o perfil de transcrição da proteína tipo-taumatina diminuiu. Não foi detectada a expressão de 1, 3 -beta glucanase (QsGLU). Além disso, a escolha dos genes de referência apropriados é absolutamente crucial em estudos de RT-qPCR envolvendo novos sistemas experimentais. Por esta razão, neste estudo, e pela primeira vez, um conjunto de genes de referência potenciais foi analisado e validado para a normalização de qPCR no sistema Phytophthora-Q. suber. Quatro genes de referência candidatos, polymeraseII (QsRPII), factor de iniciação da tradução eucariótica 5 A (QsEIF- 5 A), b -tubulina (QsTUB) e proteína da família da sob-unidade média dos complexos proteicos adaptadores da Clathrin (QsCACs) foram avaliados para determinar quais funcionavam como referências internas mais estáveis em Q. suber. A análise da estabilidade dos genes foi realizada utilizando o software Normfinder. Os resultados indicaram que estes quatro genes de referência potenciais apresentavam uma expressão estável. A análise dos dados revelou que QsRPII e QsCAC foram os dois genes eram mais estáveis, ao passo que QsTUB e QsEIF- 5 A se situaram em terceiro e quarto lugar em estabilidade, respectivamente. Neste estudo, um método de PCR quantitativo baseado num plasmídeo, foi desenvolvido para quantificar a colonização de P. cinnamomi durante o processo de infecção de Q. suber. A detecção de P. cinnamomi baseada no plasmídeo mostrou uma acumulação gradual de DNA do agente patogénico em pontas das raízes de sobreiro até 24 h após a infecção. O maior aumento no rácio DNA de P. cinnamomi/DNA de plasmídeo ocorreu entre 18 e 24 h. Um dos principais objectivos desta pesquisa foi estudar o efeito das cinnamominas (elicitinas segregadas por P. cinnamomin) no mecanismo de defesa contra o agente patogénico, já que estudos histológicos e ultra-estruturais recentes mostraram que P. cinnamomi se confinou ao córtex externo de fragmentos de raízes pré-tratadas com capsicceína e criptogeína, sugerindo que as elicitinas podem estimular reacções de defesa da planta contra P. cinnamomi. Para complementar os estudos e ter uma visão clara da natureza da interacção, foi avaliado o papel das cinamominas na produção do pico oxidativo [ROS e enzimas de remoção de ROS, tais como superóxido dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) e peroxidase (POD) ] e nas respostas de defesa. Plântulas de sobreiro foram pré-tratadas com alfa-cinnamomina e inoculadas com micélio de P. cinnamomi. Os resultados obtidos mostraram um aumento significativo da produção das espécies reactivas de oxigênio (ROS) (H 2 O 2 e O 2. -) nas raízes tratadas e não tratadas com elicitina em interacção com P. cinnamomi em comparação com o controle correspondente. O grupo de plantas inoculadas com o agente patogénico, após tratamento com a cinnamomina, apresentou um aumento precoce da produção de H 2 O 2 mas em menor grau quando comparado com o grupo inoculado com P. cinnamomi e não pré-tratado com cinamomina. Também, no grupo pré-tratado com a elicitina foi observado geralmente um nível mais baixo de produção de O 2. - durante a infecção em comparação com as raízes inoculadas com P. cinnamomi sem pré-tratamento com a elicitina. Além disso, neste estudo, foram avaliadas as actividades das enzimas antioxidantes durante o contacto de P. cinnamomi com e sem pré-tratamento com alfa-cinnamomin. Os resultados indicaram que a actividade das enzimas POD, SOD e CAT aumentou após inoculação com P. cinnamomi, quando comparada com as dos grupos de controlo. Além disso, no grupo tratado com alfa-cinnamomin, seguido por inoculação de P. cinnamomi, foi detectado um maior nível de actividade enzimática em comparação com o grupo não tratado com a elicitina, sugerindo um efeito protector de alfa-cinnamomin contra o agente patogénico devido aos níveis mais elevados das enzimas de defesa POD, SOD e CAT durante o período de infecção. Foi, ainda, aplicado um método sensível de qPCR para medir a biomassa do agente patogénico em raízes “eliciadas” e não “eliciadas” de Q. suber que foram inoculadas com P. cinnamomi, para elucidar o efeito das cinnamominas na colonização de P. cinnamomi. A quantificação de P. cinnamomi, baseada no uso dum plasmídeo, mostrou uma diminuição significativa da acumulação do DNA do agente patogénico nas raízes de sobreiro tratadas com alfa- e beta-cinnamominas, o que põe uma evidência o papel das cinnamominas na promoção da resposta de defesa contra a invasão P. cinnamomi em sobreiro...|$|R
