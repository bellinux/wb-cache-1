40|$|In a Pulsed Neutron Activation (PNA) flowmeter, {{the water}} in a pipe is bombarded with neutron pulses, which {{introduce}} activity into the pipe. The activity is mixed with the flow, and gamma radiation emitted from the activity is measured with a detector downstream. The average velocity of the water is then calculated using the time-resolved detector signal. In this paper, the effect <b>of</b> <b>collimation</b> <b>of</b> the neutron <b>radiation</b> has been investigated. Such a collimation would increase the accuracy of the measurement, but the use of a collimator requires the distance between the pipe and the neutron source to be increased, with a corresponding loss in count rate.

40|$|A microoptical beam {{transformation}} {{system for}} coupling of {{high power laser}} diode bars into multimode optical fibers is introduced. The key components are a gradient-index (GRIN) cylindrical lens for the <b>collimation</b> <b>Of</b> the fast-axis <b>radiation</b> {{and an array of}} blazed gratings for beam deflection of the single emitter bundles in the slowaxis. Excellent optical performance and high numerical aperture is required for the cylindrical lens. The lenses are fabricated by Ag+/Na+ ion exchange and exhibit diffiraction-limited performance up to N.

Using these elements coupling of more than 60 % of the output power of a 19 emitter high power laser diode bar (Pout = 20 W) into a 200 mm fiber of N. A. = 0. 2 is achieved.

40|$|Aims Three-dimensional {{rotational}} angiography (3 DRA) is {{a promising}} new online tool for 3 D imaging during cardiac ablation procedures. No precise data exist concerning its associated radiation dose. The current study evaluated the effective dose (ED) of cardiac rotational angiography {{and its relation}} to patient properties, imaging system input settings, and quality of reconstructed 3 D images. Methods and results We performed Monte Carlo simulation-based radiation dose calculations in 42 patients referred for ablation of cardiac arrhythmias. Detailed tube setting information from the 3 DRA system (Siemens Axiom Artis dBC with Syngo DynaCT Cardiac software) was used to provide an accurate input for dose calculations in all 248 frames used during image acquisition. Our calculations yielded an overall mean ED of 6. 6 +/- 1. 8 mSv (based on ICRP 103 weighing factors). Manual <b>collimation</b> <b>of</b> the <b>radiation</b> beam can reduce ED by more than 20 %. Image quality did not significantly relate to patient body mass index (BMI), dose per frame setting, or dose-area product (DAP), but was rather explained by contrast filling, cardiac motion reduction, and absence of image reconstruction artefacts. In the system evaluated, DAP values are nearly independent from BMI (R(2) = 0. 30), due to its technical specifications. Therefore, patient BMI showed an unexpected strong inverse relation to ED. Conclusion Three-dimensional rotational angiography can be performed with acceptable patient radiation dose, comparable to cardiac CT. With the 3 DRA system studied (Siemens Axiom), slender patients may currently receive unnecessarily high radiation doses when compared with obese patients, so that further dose reduction seems feasible for many patients. Adequate collimation is imperative to limit patient exposure. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|The {{collision}} of both beams in the HERA storage ring is {{performed by the}} guidance of the electron beam to the proton beam. Thereby synchrotron radiation is generated in the bending and focussing magnets. In order to avoid a deterioration of the data accumulation by the radiation background, the experiments are protected from the synchrotron radiation by collimators which are installed in front of and behind the detectors. Since after the luminosity upgrade, a <b>collimation</b> <b>of</b> the synchrotron <b>radiation</b> in front <b>of</b> the experiments will no longer be possible, the detectors have to be designed such, that the direct synchrotron radiation fan passes through the detectors. The first part of this thesis is concerned with the design of a suitable central beam pipe and collimation system for the Hl detector. The photons on the edge <b>of</b> the <b>radiation</b> fan are emitted by the electrons in the tails of the electron distribution. Therefore the knowledge of the electron distribution in HERA is for the design of the central beam pipe and <b>collimation</b> system <b>of</b> H 1 detector very important. The investigation of the electron tails in HERA is the second topic of this work. For these investigations tail scan experiments were carried out with several optics and with and without the beam-beam- interaction. The core of the electron distribution was always a Gaussian until about six standard deviations, whereas the tails were non Gaussian. The non Gaussian tails {{can be explained by the}} combined effects of scattering processes and nonlinear forces. The influence of the scattering processes on the electron tails was investigated analytically. Simulation programs were used to investigate the influence of the nonlinear forces on the tails...|$|R

The x-rays of the foals and mares were made by the conventional technique, these of the two years old were made by the digital technique. The radiograms were analysed in two different schemes of radiographic criteria. Once in the scheme of BRUNKEN (1986) and once in the categorization from committee of x-ray. For all navicular bones quantity, length and form of the canales sesamoidales were evaluated. Structure and contour of the navicular bone were also evaluated.

40|$|We have {{examined}} the physical conditions in the narrow-line region (NLR) of the Seyfert 2 galaxy Markarian 3, using long-slit spectra obtained with the Hubble Space Telescope/Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph and photoionization models. We find three components of photoionized gas in the NLR. Two of these components, characterized by emission lines such as [Ne V] λ 3426 and [O III] λ 5007, lie within the envelope of the bi-conical region described in our previous kinematic study. A component of lower ionization gas, in which lines such as [O II] λ 3727 arise, is found to lie outside the bi-cone. Each of these components is irradiated by a power-law continuum which is attenuated by intervening gas, presumably closer to the central source. The radiation incident upon the low ionization gas, external to the bi-cone, is much more heavily absorbed. These absorbers {{are similar to the}} intrinsic UV and X-ray absorbers detected in many Seyfert 1 galaxies, which suggests that the <b>collimation</b> <b>of</b> the ionizing <b>radiation</b> occurs in a circumnuclear wind, rather than a thick, molecular torus.

The Seyfert galaxies were selected as presenting 'linear' or cone-like high-excitation emission lines in the optical, most probably arising from the <b>collimation</b> <b>of</b> the <b>radiation</b> <b>of</b> the central source by a dusty molecular torus. Our goal was to look for signatures of this torus, and to investigate the gaseous distribution, excitation and reddening. The strongest emission lines detected are usually He I 1. 083 μm and [S III] λ 9532, followed by Paβ. In some cases, [Fe II] 1. 26 and 1. 64 μm are also seen. [Fe II] 1. 26 μm and H 2 v  1 2 0 S(1) are detected {{in some of the}} higher resolution spectra obtained for five galaxies. The emission lines are spatially extended in most cases, and we have used the [Fe II]/Paβ ratio as a measure of the gaseous excitation in Mrk 573, NGC 1386 and NGC 7582. Values for this ratio between 1. 5 and 6 are found, suggesting excitation of [Fe II] by X-rays or shock waves in some regions. Broad permitted lines are observed in three Seyfert 1 galaxies. Nuclear Paβ in NGC 1365 and possibly nuclear Brγ in Mrk 573 are also broad. From analysis of the spatial distribution of the continuum (J - H)  and (H - K)  colours derived from our spectra, we find redder colours for the nucleus than for the nearby bulge in most of the Seyfert 2 s observed.

40|$|To {{test the}} dust torus model for active galactic nuclei directly, we study {{the extent and}} {{morphology}} of the nuclear dust distribution in the Circinus galaxy using high resolution interferometric observations in the mid-infrared with the MIDI instrument at the Very Large Telescope Interferometer. We find that the dust distribution in the nucleus of Circinus {{can be explained by}} two components, a dense and warm disk-like component of 0. 4 pc size and a slightly cooler, geometrically thick torus component with a size of 2. 0 pc. The disk component is oriented perpendicular to the ionisation cone and outflow and seems to show the silicate feature at 10 micron in emission. It coincides with a nuclear maser disk in orientation and size. From the energy needed to heat the dust, we infer a luminosity of the accretion disk corresponding to 20 % of the Eddington luminosity of the nuclear black hole. We find that the interferometric data are inconsistent with a simple, smooth and axisymmetric dust emission. The irregular behaviour of the visibilities and the shallow decrease of the dust temperature with radius provide strong evidence for a clumpy or filamentary dust structure. We see no evidence for dust reprocessing, as the silicate absorption profile is consistent with that of standard galactic dust. We argue that the <b>collimation</b> <b>of</b> the ionising <b>radiation</b> must originate in the geometrically thick torus component. Our findings confirm the presence of a geometrically thick, torus-like dust distribution in the nucleus of Circinus, as required in unified schemes of Seyfert galaxies.

40|$|Abridged) With {{infrared}} interferometry {{it is possible}} to resolve the nuclear dust distributions that are commonly associated with the dusty torus in active galactic nuclei (AGN). The Circinus galaxy hosts the closest Seyfert 2 nucleus and previous interferometric observations have shown that its nuclear dust emission is well resolved. To better constrain the dust morphology in this active nucleus, extensive new observations were carried out with MIDI at the Very Large Telescope Interferometer. The emission is distributed in two distinct components: a disk-like emission component with a size of 0. 2 × 1. 1 pc and an extended component with a size of 0. 8 × 1. 9 pc. The disk-like component is elongated along PA 46 and oriented perpendicular to the ionisation cone and outflow. The extended component is elongated along PA 107, roughly perpendicular to the disk component and thus in polar direction. It is interpreted as emission from the inner funnel of an extended dust distribution and shows a strong increase in the extinction towards the south-east. We find no evidence of an increase in the temperature of the dust towards the centre. From this we infer that most of the near-infrared emission probably comes from parsec scales as well. We further argue that the disk component alone is not sufficient to provide the necessary obscuration and <b>collimation</b> <b>of</b> the ionising <b>radiation</b> and outflow. The material responsible for this must instead be located on scales of 1 pc, surrounding the disk. The clear separation of the dust emission into a disk-like emitter and a polar elongated source will require an adaptation of our current understanding of the dust emission in AGN. The lack of any evidence of an increase in the dust temperature towards the centre poses a challenge for the picture of a centrally heated dust distribution.

40|$|We {{propose a}} novel {{mechanism}} for the <b>collimation</b> <b>of</b> relativistic outflows emanated from accretion disks via the disk radiation field, itself. In general, winds driven by disk radiation fields diverge, due {{to the effect of}} rotation and the nature <b>of</b> <b>radiation.</b> If, however, the disk is divided into an optically thin hot inner region and an optically thick luminous outer region, the outflow ejected from the inner disk is accelerated and collimated by radiation fields produced by the outer disk. Since this mechanism effectively works on electron-positron pair plasmas, in accretion disk systems with inner hot advection-dominated regions, electron-positron jets easily form on the disk-rotation axis. For pure electron-positron pair plasmas, the terminal speed of collimated jets is about 0. 9 c, which is very close to the jet speed of galactic superluminal sources...|$|R
