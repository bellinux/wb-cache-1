He attended Chaplin School in Gwelo, where he was head prefect, recipient of the Victor Ludorum in athletics, captain of the school teams in cricket, rugby union and tennis, and successful academically. After graduating in 1937, he attended Rhodes University College in Grahamstown, South Africa, which was often attended by Rhodesian students, partly because Rhodesia then had no university of its own. Enrolling {{at the start of}} 1938, Smith read for a Bachelor of Commerce degree. He was about halfway through his <b>course</b> <b>when</b> the Second World War broke out in September 1939.|$|E
5|$|A {{soldier on}} {{vacation}} here said he witnessed a terrible atrocity {{in the occupied}} parts of Poland. He watched as naked Jewish {{men and women were}} placed in front of a long deep ditch and upon the order of the SS were shot by Ukrainians {{in the back of their}} heads and they fell into the ditch. Then the ditch was filled with dirt even as he could still hear screams coming from people still alive in the ditch. These inhuman atrocities were so terrible that some of the Ukrainians, who were used as tools, suffered nervous breakdowns. All the soldiers who had knowledge of these bestial actions of these Nazi sub-humans were of the opinion that the German people should be shaking in their shoes because of the coming retribution. There is no punishment that would be hard enough to be applied to these Nazi beasts. Of <b>course,</b> <b>when</b> the retribution comes, the innocent will have to suffer along with them. But because ninety-nine percent of the German population is guilty, directly or indirectly, for the present situation, we can only say that those who travel together will hang together. , Friedrich Kellner exhibit.

5|$|In {{their last}} year in Minneapolis, the Lakers went 25–50. On January 18, 1960, the team was coming off a loss and {{traveling}} to St. Louis when their plane crash-landed. Snow storms had driven the pilot 150 miles off <b>course</b> <b>when</b> {{he was forced to}} land in a cornfield. No one was hurt. Their record earned them the number two pick in the 1960 NBA draft. The team selected Jerry West from West Virginia University. During the 1960 off-season, the Lakers became the NBA's first West Coast team when owner Bob Short decided to move the team to Los Angeles. Led by Baylor's 34.8ppg and 19.8rpg, Los Angeles won 11 more than the year before in West's first season. On November 15 that season, Baylor set a new NBA scoring record when he scored 71 points in a victory against the New York Knicks while grabbing 25 rebounds. In doing so, Baylor broke his own NBA record of 64 points. Despite a losing record, the Lakers made the playoffs. They came within two points of the NBA Finals when they lost in game seven of their second round series against St. Louis.|$|E
5|$|The MD 198 {{divided highway}} was {{extended}} west from Sweitzer Lane {{to what was}} then US 29 in 1985. That same year, the state highway was expanded to a divided highway from US 1 to the Patuxent River. MD 198 was rebuilt as a divided highway from the Patuxent River to {{just west of the}} Baltimore–Washington Parkway in 1987. The divided highway was extended through the parkway interchange in 1991. As part of the construction, the original five-ramp partial cloverleaf interchange had a loop ramp added from the northbound parkway to westbound MD 198. That same year, MD 198 was extended east from the Little Patuxent River to newly constructed MD 32 in Fort Meade. The state highway's western terminus was relocated from an acute intersection with MD 650 to an orthogonal intersection in 1997. The west leg of the intersection became operational when the extended Norbeck Road, a county highway connecting the ends of MD 28 and MD 198, opened in 2004.

5|$|The highway turns westward along Wirtz Road {{and past}} the {{southern}} terminus of county road F-97 {{in the northern part}} of Gladwin County. Near a crossing with the Cedar River, M-18 turns north along Bard Road and then west again along Renas Road. The highway returns to its northerly <b>course</b> <b>when</b> it turns to run along Clarwin Road, which runs along the Clare–Gladwin county line. The roadway angles to the northwest briefly, cutting across the extreme northeast corner of Clare County as the highway crosses into Roscommon County.

In that community, M-18 turns northeasterly and runs along M-55 along the eastern shore of Houghton Lake. The two highways separate on the eastern edge of town, and M-18 turns northward, intersecting the northern end of M-157. M-18 continues north, parallel to Interstate 75 (I-75) near Higgins Lake; M-18 crosses I-75 at exit239 south of Roscommon.|$|E

25|$|The natural {{esterification}} {{that takes}} place in wines and other alcoholic beverages during the aging process is an example of acid-catalysed esterification. Over time, the acidity of the acetic acid and tannins in an aging wine will catalytically protonate other organic acids (including acetic acid itself), encouraging ethanol to react as a nucleophile. As a result, ethyl acetate – the ester of ethanol and acetic acid—is the most abundant ester in wines. Other combinations of organic alcohols (such as phenol-containing compounds) and organic acids lead to a variety of different esters in wines, contributing to their different flavours, smells and tastes. Of <b>course,</b> <b>when</b> compared to sulfuric acid conditions, the acid conditions in a wine are mild, so yield is low (often in tenths or hundredths of a percentage point by volume) and take years for ester to accumulate.|$|E
