In this paper, we investigate the performance of Pt/SAPO- 11 catalysts for isomerization of n-paraffins by the model compound of n-dodecane.

40|$|The present paper {{demonstrates}} that the exclusive aromatic character of high temperature tar, is not only due to the disappearance, by post-cracking, of the paraffinic fraction of primary tars, but that cracking reactions contribute to form mono- and polycyclic aromatics. Aromatisation of the neutral and acid oil fractions of low temperature tar, was studied. The main pathway to aromatic compounds formation is the Diels-Alder reaction on short chain olefins, mainly butadiene and propene. The olefins are formed by post-cracking reactions of long chain paraffins in the primary tars and of cyclopentadiene, {{which is one of}} the primary <b>cracking</b> <b>products</b> of the phenols. These mechanisms were demonstrated by the cracking of pure compounds to investigate their fate in the post-cracking reactions occurring during coal carbonization. N-decane was chosen as representative of long chain aliphatics and 1, 3 -butadiene, 1 -butene and iso-butene for the short chain olefins. Phenols, labelled in specific position by carbon 14 and tritium, were cracked. Radiochromatography was used to determine the radio-active content of each of the <b>cracking</b> <b>products.</b> Cyclopentadiene and CO are the primary <b>cracking</b> <b>products</b> of phenols. Cyclopentadiene is not stable at phenols' cracking temperatures. Direct formation of naphthalene from cyclopentadiene was observed at temperatures as low as 550 °C.

The {{presence of a}} synergistic effect is observed for mixture samples with a PP composition of >= 30 wt %. Different proportions of PP in LDPE/PP mixtures give different interaction effects. The 70 / 30 LDPE/PP mixture starts to give viscosity-reducing effect and can degrade at lower temperature; the 50 / 50 LDPE/PP mixture gives higher gaseous products yield, specifically, more methane, ethane and propane; and the 30 / 70 LDPE/PP mixture makes more aromatics formed in the liquid products. The synergetic effect of LDPE and PP is related {{not only to the}} mass fraction of PP, but also to the reaction time. The interactions mechanism are related to enhanced intermolecular hydrogen transfer between LDPE/its <b>cracked</b> <b>products</b> and PP/its <b>cracked</b> <b>products,</b> not only in the liquid phase but also in the gas phase, because of the long cracking time in closed-batch reactors, where PP/its <b>cracked</b> <b>products</b> provide more radicals and PE/its <b>cracked</b> <b>products</b> provide more secondary hydrogen for intermolecular hydrogen transfer, and the combination of these factors enhances the chain breakage.

30|$|This {{phenomenon}} can {{be explained}} from the above characterization results. The HZSM- 5 zeolite contains Brønsted acid sites which can supply protons for the FCC reaction. The shifting of proton results {{in the formation of}} carbonium ions which favors the FCC reaction towards the formation of light olefins such as propylene and butylene [37, 38]. It is well know that the FCC reaction is a parallel sequential mechanism. The cracking of the crude oil primarily produce gasoline and diesel oil. However, in the secondary stage, it produces light olefins such as propylene and butylene. As listed in Table  4, the ZC 7300 catalyst with HZSM- 5 improves the selectivity of the reaction to form secondary <b>cracking</b> <b>products,</b> which results in the increase in the yield of light olefin and decrease in the yield of the primary <b>cracking</b> <b>products</b> gasoline. The decrease of the yields of coke may be attributed to the mesopore structure derived from the interspaces of ZSM- 5 crystals that endow the corresponding catalyst with improved accessibility to hydrocarbon molecules and thereafter, lower down the coke selectivity.|$|E

Flow reactor experiments on reduction of NO by phenol, a model compound of tar from updraft biomass gasification, are conducted from fuel lean to rich conditions, covering temperatures of 1173 - 1573 K and equivalence ratio of 0. 34 - 1. 73.

30|$|A {{classical}} hydroisomerisation {{reaction is}} believed to occur over a bifunctional catalyst which contains an appropriate balance between acid and metal sites [1, 6]. When n-C 7 is converted over a catalyst with an incongruity between acid/metals sites, the <b>cracked</b> <b>products</b> ranged between C 3 and C 6, whereas on a catalyst with a balance of metal/acid sites, the <b>cracked</b> <b>products</b> is limited to only C 3 and C 4 [69]. Hence, the range of hydrocracked product obtained in this research may signify that the ratio of metal site to acid sites was not fully optimised. Catalyst here contained both metal-like hydrogenation sites (51  µmol g− 1 from CO adsorption) and Brønsted acid sites (42  µmol g− 1 pyridine retained) giving a ratio of 1.22, which {{is greater than the}} range of 0.03 and 0.17 reported to be indicative of low and high hydrogenating/acid site density ratios, respectively, for hydroisomerisation of n-alkanes over PtHFAU [70]. It had been reported that catalysts {{with a high degree of}} hydrogenation activity and low degree of acidity are best for maximising the extent of hydroisomerisation vs hydrocracking [71] and for avoiding deactivation due to coking [54]. The lack of deactivation through coking (Fig.  6) suggests that the catalyst possessed enough carbide sites in relation to the acid site to minimise build-up of carbonaceous precursors. However, these ratios also fail to distinguish between the relative rates on these sites, and so, the relatively high density of metal-like sites (51  µmol g− 1) compared to Brønsted acid sites (42  µmol g− 1) may not fully explain the low yield of the heptane isomers.|$|R

40|$|The {{influence}} of product shape selectivity on the bifunctional conversion of n-C 7 by zeolite catalysts is investigated. Three different zeolite catalysts with different pore sizes (MFI-type, MEL-type, and BEA-type zeolites) {{have been investigated}} experimentally. For all three catalysts, n-C 7 is isomerized to monobranched isomers which are further isomerized into dibranched isomers, and these dibranched molecules are converted into <b>cracking</b> <b>products.</b> More dibranched isomers and less <b>cracking</b> <b>products</b> are produced by BEA-type zeolite compared to MFI-type and MEL-type zeolites and clear differences are observed {{in the distribution of}} dibranched isomers produced by different catalysts. Molecular simulation is used to compute the adsorption isotherms and free energy barriers for diffusion of dibranched isomers in MFI-type, MEL-type, and BEA-type zeolites. Combining simulation results and experimental observations, it is shown that product shape selectivity can explain the distribution of dibranched molecules while transition state shape selectivity fails to do so. For the medium-pore zeolites (MFI-type and MEL-type zeolites), free energy barriers for diffusion of dibranched molecules are significant. For MFI-type and MEL-type zeolites, the dibranched molecule that has to overcome lower diffusion barrier is produced with a higher yield and the distribution of dimethylpentane molecules is determined by their diffusion rate. It is shown that there is almost no free energy barrier for the diffusion of any of these molecules in BEA-type zeolite. As BEA-type zeolite imposes no free energy barrier for diffusion of any of dibranched isomers, the distribution of dibranched isomers is very close to the equilibrium distribution in the gas phase. Due to the limited mobility of dimethylpentanes within the pores of MFI-type and MEL-type zeolites, most of the dimethylpentane molecules are trapped inside the zeolite and undergo consecutive cracking. Dimethylpentane molecules diffuse sufficiently fast in the large pores of BEA-type zeolite and transfer to the gas phase, before consecutive reaction converts these molecules into <b>cracking</b> <b>products.</b> Moreover, the effect of the MFI-type crystal size on the production of dibranched isomers is investigated.
