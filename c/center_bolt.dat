40|$|The ISTUK deep drill was {{developed}} in 1978 - 1980. The drill is mechanical. The cuttings are sucked from the bits into storage chambers in the drill, and brought to the surface with each core increment (typically 2. 4 m in length). Because the actual drilling time is {{a fraction of the}} total run time, with most of the time spent going {{up and down in the}} drill hole, much emphasis has been placed on reducing the friction in the hole and in reducing the time consumed on the surface. In order to simplify the drilling operation, the steel drill cable uses only one wire with the armour acting as power return. Also, to enhance the reliability of the drilling, most drill control tasks are taken care of by a down borehole processor. The drill was first used during 1979 - 1981 at Dye- 3 in south Greenland, and lately during 1990 - 1992 at Summit, central Greenland. The Summit drill is physically the same as the Dye- 3 drill however, the motor section has been replaced, as have the high-pressure gaskets. The cutters and the core catchers are basically the same, but the angles have been changed slightly. The electronics are new, although the functions performed are unchanged. The winch and the tilting tower are both of new construction and use an electronic variable frequency inverter to drive a standard 3 -phase electrical motor.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} the behaviour of FRP composite bolted connections with one steel bolt exposed to tension load. The experimental analysis {{of three different}} configuration of bolted connection with one bolt has been conducted with the tension test. The distance between {{the center of the}} hole and the loaded edge of the composite plate is the only changing parameter, where the rest are all constant. Additionally, we checked the current equations, which are in use by the company Fiberline to design one bolt FRP connections. The introduction of the thesis discusses the basic of the FRP materials with their composition, mechanical characteristics, production methods together with standards and guidelines for design of structural elements and connections made of FRP materials. This is followed by the detailed description of the specimen and the test setup itself. The distance between the loaded FRP plate edge and the <b>center</b> of the <b>bolt</b> hole with the diameter of d is for the first series of specimens 1. 5 *d, for the second is 3. 5 *d and for the last one is 7 *d. Each series contained 4 specimens. During the experiment conduction the force and the relative displacement of the steel bolt have been recorded. Due to the bearing stress of the bolt the specimens have experienced different failure mechanisms in relationship to the distance between the <b>center</b> of the <b>bolt</b> hole and the loaded edge of the composite plate. As expected, the worst behaviour of the tested connections has shown the connection with the shortest distance (1. 5 *d). This type of connections has no post fracture load bearing capacity after the first recorded damage and represents brittle failure. For the other two configurations of specimens with longer distance between <b>center</b> of the <b>bolt</b> hole and the loaded edge of the FRP plate we observed ductile behaviour and good post fracture behaviour. This shows that we must ensure the minimum adequate distance between <b>center</b> of the <b>bolt</b> hole and loaded FRP plate edge whenever we use this type of connections for structural purposes. We additionally confirmed the failure mechanisms in relationship to the distance between the <b>center</b> of the <b>bolt</b> hole and the loaded FRP plate edge which are stated in the internal design manual of the company Fiberline...|$|R

40|$|This paper covers an {{investigation}} into the feasibility of analyzing bolt preloads by ultrasonic techniques. Various techniques were evaluated and a pulse echo inteferometric method was selected for experimental testing. In agreement with theoretical predictions, the interferometer response was found to be linearly related to tensile stresses oriented parallel to the bolt axis. Under rather idealized conditions, bolt loads can be determined with errors of less than 1 %. The ultimate operational accuracy depends on a number of variables, such as bolt dimensions and geometry, bolt temperature, uniformity of stresses, and bolt materials, but load analyses to within + or - 3 % are readily achievable. Best results are obtained with the ultrasonic transducer contact coupled to a small flat area near the <b>center</b> of the <b>bolt</b> head.

This table also shows that the performance of Eq. (3) over Eq. (2) estimating b distance demonstrates superior in eleven cases, equal in three cases and inferior in only two cases. In addition, the maximum and minimum discrepancies in b distance calculation by Eq. (3) are 11.4 and − 5.3  %, respectively. Corresponding discrepancies obtained using Eq. (2) are 13.8 and − 5.4  %, respectively. However, Eq. (2) is simpler as it uses only one parameter: tension angle thickness.

However, overestimation of the value of b using Eq. (3) may be as high as 11.4  %.

Some early engines have lifter retainer provisions, but utilize the older, non-roller camshaft. 1987 would also be the last year for the LG4 production, however a run of LG4 engines was made to supplement the carry-over production for the 1988 Monte Carlo and the 1988 Chevrolet Caprice.|$|R
50|$|Unlike {{traditional}} bolt actions {{which contain}} {{the firing pin}} <b>centered</b> in the <b>bolt,</b> the Palmer's bolt was machined from a solid block of tubular metal, which had screw type lands and grooves to lock the bolt in place via a short stubby handle.

A tooled, milled slot is visible on the head of the bolt canted toward the right side allows a slight opening for the firing pin atop the hammer to strike the rim-fired cartridge, usually the 56-50 rim fire. The bolt was designed for single shot action, the cartridges were loaded one at a time. The design was quite revolutionary, and was seen at the time as a simple breach modification to weapons of the time period to accept metallic cartridges instead of the traditional powder, ball, wad, ram rod and percussion cap which consumed time during loading procedures. The designer understood that gunsmiths could hopefully modify current percussion rifles from the breach of the gun in the same way flintlocks were modified to percussion using a relatively simple process. The downfall of the rifle was the positioning of the hammer where the firing pin hits the rim of the cartridge, and the small space on the bolt where the two parts meet with the bullet rim when the trigger is pulled.|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to study the {{behaviour}} of bolted steel connections subjected to tension. Quasi-static conditions have been considered. By performing laboratory tests on single bolts and simple T-stub connections the failure modes of the bolts have been examined. Finite element models are created and validated to represent the behaviour observed in the laboratory. Different grip length configurations have been tested for a single bolt and nut assembly subjected to pure tension. Both partially and fully threaded bolts have been considered. It was found that partially threaded bolts with three threads between the unthreaded part of the shank and the bearing surface of the nut experienced thread stripping. This is inconsistent with the recommendations given in NS-EN 1090 - 2, which states that one full thread is sufficient to avoid thread stripping. Finite element models are able to recreate the behaviour of all configurations tested with acceptable accuracy. In addition to the grip length, the material properties and geometry of the threads are identified as the crucial factors for the failure modes of the bolts. Simple T-stub connections with one bolt in each flange have been tested to examine the behaviour of the bolts when they are subjected {{to a combination of}} tension and bending. The center distance between the bolts was varied to examine the behaviour when subjected to increased bending effects. Connections with partially threaded bolts all failed due to thread stripping. The fully threaded bolts experienced both thread stripping and bolt failure. The complexity of the stress distribution when large bending effects are present was difficult to recreate with a simplified finite element model. Acceptable accuracy up to maximum force was possible to achieve for the smallest <b>bolt</b> <b>center</b> distance. The response of the finite element model was very mesh sensitive, and difficult to recreate with limited computational capacity when applying an explicit solution algorithm...|$|R

Females drill through pine bark to deposit eggs, a symbiotic fungus, Amylostereum, and phytotoxic mucus into the tree. In their native range, these insects are not viewed as primary pests because they attack dead or dying trees. Over the last century, this woodwasp has been accidentally introduced into several {{countries in the}} southern hemisphere. Some regions have incurred {{millions of dollars in}} damage to large plantations of the widely planted pine species, radiata pine (Pinus radiata D. Don). Sirex noctilio was discovered in northeastern United States and Canada in 2004. Prior studies have focused on damage done to pine stands in the southern hemisphere and, because those pines are not native, these studies may not be applicable to native pines in the U. S. The southeastern U. S. contains millions of hectares of possibly susceptible pine trees and, thus it is advisable to study the native Arkansas woodwasp, S. nigricornis F., (as a species with similar biology) in preparation for a possible invasion by its exotic counterpart. The objectives of this research were to 1) examine how shortleaf pine (Pinus echinata Mill.) logs (bolts) in moderate drought conditions of Arkansas lose moisture over time, and 2) determine oviposition preferences of Sirex nigricornis females in aging pine bolts. To complete these objectives, shortleaf pines were felled and moisture content was measured over a period of 45 days. Moisture content results were used to create parameters for oviposition choice experiments. After a cross-sectional cut was made, the most moisture loss occurs within 3 - 4 cm of bolt ends while the <b>center</b> of the <b>bolt</b> stays consistent during this time period. Females prefer to oviposit in recently cut bolts. Using these results, trap tree methods can be altered to create more efficient methods of siricid capture and laboratory rearing...|$|R
