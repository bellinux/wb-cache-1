40|$|Surface {{mining and}} mine {{reclamation}} practices have caused significant forest loss and forest fragmentation in Appalachia. <b>Shortleaf</b> <b>pine</b> (Pinus echinata) {{is threatened by}} a variety of stresses, including diseases, pests, poor management, altered fire regimes, and climate change, and the species {{is the subject of a}} widescale restoration effort. Surface mines may present opportunity for <b>shortleaf</b> <b>pine</b> restoration; however, the survival and growth of <b>shortleaf</b> <b>pine</b> on these harsh sites has not been critically evaluated. This paper presents first-year survival and growth of native <b>shortleaf</b> <b>pine</b> planted on a reclaimed surface mine, compared to non-native loblolly pine (Pinus taeda), which has been highly successful in previous mined land reclamation plantings. Pine monoculture plots are also compared to pine-hardwood polyculture plots to evaluate effects of planting mix on tree growth and survival, as well as soil health. Initial survival of <b>shortleaf</b> <b>pine</b> is low (42 %), but height growth is similar to that of loblolly pine. No differences in survival or growth were observed between monoculture and polyculture treatments. Additional surveys in coming years will address longer-term growth and survival patterns of these species, as well as changes to relevant soil health endpoints, such as soil carbon...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The {{frequency}} of mature hybrids, including post-F 1 individuals, between loblolly (Pinus taeda L.) and <b>shortleaf</b> <b>pine</b> (Pinus echinata Mill.), detectable with a codominant nuclear marker, was studied in a sympatric popula-tion from central Arkansas. The direction of introgression was also examined. The marker revealed 10 putative hybrids from the 80 trees sampled. PCR-RFLP {{analysis of their}} rbcL gene showed two of the putative hybrids (HL) share loblolly pine chloroplast DNA, and eight (HS) share the <b>shortleaf</b> <b>pine</b> chloroplast DNA. The two putative HL hybrids were morphologically similar to loblolly pine, and the eight putative HS hybrids were morphologically similar to <b>shortleaf</b> <b>pine.</b> Utilizing microsatellite data, Nei’s measure of genetic identity showed the putative HL hybrids {{to be similar to}} loblolly pine, and the putative HS hybrids as being similar to <b>shortleaf</b> <b>pine.</b> An inferred tree of the individu-als, using simple sequence repeat data and the neighbor-joining method, also suggested that some of the putative hy-brids were not F 1 individuals. Principle component analysis of the morphological characters groups the HL trees with loblolly pine and the HS trees with <b>shortleaf</b> <b>pine.</b> These results suggest bidirectional introgression occurred within the study population, and some of the putative hybrids were likely derived from early-generation backcross(es) with either <b>shortleaf</b> or loblolly <b>pine.</b> Résumé: Les auteurs ont évalué la fréquence des hybrides matures, incluant les individus introgressés, entre le pin à encens (Pinus taeda L.) et le pin à courtes feuilles (Pinus echinata Mill.) tels que détectés à l’aide d’un marqueur nu...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT. —We review {{studies that}} have shown {{reductions}} in the abundance of <b>shortleaf</b> <b>pine</b> (Pinus echinata Mill.) during the last century in the Ozark Highlands. These studies indicate that pine abundance is currently 15 to 53 percent of the pine abundance levels before major logging activity and fi re suppression, activities dating from the mid- to late 19 th century. Evidence of pine loss comes from General Land Offi ce notes, the presence of pine remnants, and historical documentation that described pine forests. Selective removal of pine, followed by intense hardwood competition, reduced <b>shortleaf</b> <b>pine</b> abundance in the Ozarks over the past century. In addition, very short fi re intervals (< 3 years) before and after logging reduced advanced pine regeneration. More recently (1940 - 2006), long fi re intervals caused by fi re suppression have contributed to a long-term decline in pine abundance. Under continuing fi re suppression, vegetation dynamic models predict a decline in abundance that will stabilize in about 200 years. Additional, more recent threats to recruitment and maintenance of <b>shortleaf</b> <b>pine</b> populations may include global warming-induced insect outbreaks...|$|R

40|$|Reliable {{dimensional}} data for old-growth pine-dominated {{forests in the}} Gulf Coastal Plain of Arkansas are hard to find, but sometimes unfortunate circumstances provide good opportunities to acquire this information. On July 11, 2013, a severe thunderstorm with high winds struck the Levi Wilcoxon Demonstration Forest (LWDF) near Hamburg, Arkansas. This storm uprooted or snapped dozens of large pines and hardwoods and provided an opportunity to more closely inspect these rare specimens. For instance, the largest tree killed in this event, a loblolly pine (Pinus taeda), was 105 cm in diameter at breast height, 39. 3 m tall, and if the tree had been sound would have yielded 3, 803 board feet (Doyle log rule) of lumber. Gross board foot volume yield was also estimated from two other recently toppled large pines, an 85 -cm-DBH loblolly and an 86 -cm-DBH <b>shortleaf</b> <b>pine</b> (Pinus echinata), which tallied 2, 430 and 2, 312 board feet Doyle, respectively. A number of the other wind thrown pines on the LWDF were sound enough to count their rings for a reasonable (± 2 - 5 years) estimate of their ages. The stump of the fallen national champion <b>shortleaf</b> <b>pine</b> had 168 rings, and counts from other pines toppled by this storm had from 68 to 198 rings. We also searched for a new champion <b>shortleaf</b> <b>pine</b> using a LiDAR canopy height model of the LWDF to narrow our search. This preliminary assessment produced a number of targets that exceeded 40 m in height; further field checking of the tallest of these trees found that these were loblolly pines up to about 44 m. We eventually found <b>shortleaf</b> <b>pines</b> between 37 and 41 m tall, with diameters of up to 85 cm, indicating that the LWDF could still contain the Arkansas state champion...|$|R
