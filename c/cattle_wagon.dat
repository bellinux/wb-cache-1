50|$|In 1963 it {{was decided}} to take a leaf from the book of the {{engineers}} from the 1930s, when a number of M <b>cattle</b> <b>wagons</b> were converted to MU-type louvre vans. This time around, 89 <b>cattle</b> <b>wagons</b> were converted, picked completely randomly. Numbers were retained with the code altered to MS, and the gaps between planks were covered with internal tarpaulins. The wagons were then used for bagged superphosphate (fertiliser) traffic, loaded and unloaded by hand.|$|R

50|$|A <b>cattle</b> <b>wagon</b> is the {{everyday}} expression for a railway wagon designed to carry livestock. Cattle were {{and are usually}} transported in covered or open goods wagons.|$|E
50|$|This {{code was}} {{discovered}} by Peter J Vincent during research in 1992. It appears that during the 1930s conversion project from screw couplers to automatic couplers resulted in a short-term lack of louvre and box vans; to fill the gap, fifty M cattle wagons were converted from 1932 during their own conversion to autocouplers, with wooden planks and louvres used to cover the gaps over the normal <b>cattle</b> <b>wagon</b> design. The wagons were restored to their M wagon type and identity by 1934.|$|E
50|$|Stock {{cars were}} also used for forced {{settlement}} and population transfer in the Soviet Union in the mid-20th century. Following the end of World War II in Europe, Ethnic Germans were expelled from Czechoslovakia in <b>cattle</b> <b>wagons.</b>|$|R
50|$|Starting in 1897 and {{finishing}} in the 1950s, {{a total of}} 879 M class <b>cattle</b> <b>wagons</b> were constructed. The design was relatively standard, remaining unchanged up to wagon no.779. Wagons 780 to 879 had altered ends and the GY handbrake system.|$|R
50|$|This class {{consisted}} of 15 vehicles, resembling the M <b>cattle</b> <b>wagons</b> though squashed and stretched {{to fit the}} narrower loading gauge while maintaining similar capacity to the broad gauge vehicles. Construction started in 1899, and the last vehicle entered service in 1917.|$|R
50|$|Musa {{was born}} on 20 February 1931 in Uzundza, Balaclava region, Crimea to a {{shepherd}} family. He had five brothers and two sisters. In 1944 Joseph Stalin accused the Crimean Tatars of collaborating with the Nazis. Like thousands of other Crimean Tatars, Musa's family was driven out of its home, they were loaded onto a <b>cattle</b> <b>wagon</b> and deported to Uzbekistan. In exile, the family lived in poverty, and four of Musa’s siblings died of malnutrition. Musa worked in a cotton warehouse and in 1957 he became a machinist and tractor driver.|$|E

50|$|<b>Cattle</b> <b>wagons</b> {{had a large}} {{gap between}} {{the top of the}} sides and the roof, but the ends were similar to vans in that they went right up to the roof. These were for a while built as 'small', 'medium' or 'large' sizes. Later {{construction}} was all to the large size but with a moveable partition that could reduce the capacity if that was what a farmer required; if cattle were left with too much space they would hurt themselves if they fell over when the train was in motion. <b>Cattle</b> <b>wagons</b> were given the telegraphic code 'Mex' for ordinary beasts and 'Beetle' for pedigree cattle that needed to be accompanied by a drover, and could be found in diagrams W1 to W14.|$|R
50|$|During the war, the Nazi {{occupant}} committed severe {{crimes against}} the local Gypsy and Jewish communities. Most {{of them were}} eventually killed or transported by <b>cattle</b> <b>wagons</b> to concentration camps such as Auschwitz for complete extermination. This led to a population drop between 1939 and 1945.|$|R
50|$|In January 1942, the {{extermination}} {{ended with}} the killing of those who remained in Slobodka. From January 12-23, the last 19,582 Jews were transported in <b>cattle</b> <b>wagons</b> to Berezovka from where they were transported to the concentration camps in Golta. Within eighteen months {{almost all of them}} were dead.|$|R

5000|$|Švenk {{was one of}} {{the members}} of the avant-garde Klub zapadlých talentů (German [...] "Klub der ungenützten Talente", [...] "Club of Wasted Talents") in Prague. He {{was one of the}} first artists to be {{deported}} to Terezín on November 24, 1941, and was among the 342 young Jewish men sent to prepare the previously non-Jewish camp for the Jewish artist inmates to follow. In the autumn of 1942 he appeared in passing in the propaganda film Theresienstadt. Ein Dokumentarfilm aus dem jüdischen Siedlungsgebiet, standing with the puppetteer Otto Neumann and the dancer Kamila Rosenbaumová. Svenk was sent to Auschwitz, then briefly to a factory, and later died in a <b>cattle</b> <b>wagon</b> on a subsequent transport to Mauthausen-Gusen concentration camp.|$|E
50|$|Ungar {{was born}} in Sighetu Marmației, Romania to an Orthodox Jewish family. His family spoke Yiddish. After he was educated by his father, a teacher, Ungar {{continued}} studying Talmud. At {{the same time he}} also learned Hungarian language. Ungar continued his high school education in Budapest, Hungary. He also attended rabbinical seminar and studied at the Budapest Faculty of Philosophy. Ungar was fluent in Yiddish, Hebrew, Croatian, Hungarian, Serbian, German and Latin. Upon completing his education Ungar was rabbi in Szekszárd, Hungary. In 1901 he was appointed as the chief rabbi of the Osijek Jewish Community. He was very active in the Osijek Jewish community and actively participated in the Osijek's cultural and social life. In 1942 Ungar was arrested, he died during deportation in the <b>cattle</b> <b>wagon</b> routed to Jasenovac concentration camp.|$|E
50|$|On 1 January 1899 {{eight people}} were injured in a {{collision}} at Witham. At around 7:30 pm the 7:15 pm service from Maldon East collided side-long with a cattle train that was being shunted into a siding. Some of the <b>cattle</b> <b>wagons</b> were derailed, {{and some of the}} sheep aboard were killed. The incident was blamed on signalman error.|$|R
50|$|Around {{the early}} 1960s {{there was a}} {{shortage}} of wagons for carrying superphosphate. Due {{to the lack of}} alternatives, even with over 24,000 wagons running at the time, 70 <b>cattle</b> <b>wagons</b> were lined with tarpaulins on the inside, and loaded by hand. They were reclassed as the MS wagons. By the 1970s they were either scrapped or returned to M wagon status.|$|R
50|$|In 1942 the Germans went to Terlezki's {{school and}} {{drew up a}} list of {{children}} to be sent to the Third Reich as slave labour. Aged 14, {{he was one of the}} youngest on the list. After several weeks in holding camps, he became part of a shipment sent in railway <b>cattle</b> <b>wagons</b> to a slave distribution centre in Austria.|$|R
5000|$|As {{would later}} say {{the founder of}} Arte TV, Michel Anthonioz, {{reporting}} remarks from his mother, Genevieve de Gaulle, one of the friends of Touty at Ravensbrück [...] "She never spoke of the camp, but he was present at every instant of her life." [...] In the <b>cattle</b> <b>wagon</b> that transports the prisoners across Germany, Jacqueline Pery remembers Touty {{was one of the}} few prisoners who had a clear idea of what to expect. Spending most of her youth close to the German border, speaking German language fluently, having read Mein Kampf even before the war had started, having heard and understood the meaning of the speech of Chancellor Hitler, having maintained close connections with anti-Nazi German people after 1940 and having escorted many time persecuted Jews to the Swiss border, she was informed of the hellish universe in which they were about to enter.|$|E
50|$|Natalia and Irina {{were forced}} to move to Petrograd with their mother and their {{half-sister}} Marianne. Worried about her daughters, Olga, {{with the help of}} a few remaining friends, organized Irina and Natalia' escape. In early December the girls left their mother and took a streetcar to the train station of Ochta. After a four-hour trip in a <b>cattle</b> <b>wagon,</b> they jumped into the snow and took a horse-drawn sleigh. Finally, they walked for miles in the frigid night air. After thirty-two hours of traveling they reached Terijoki, the Finnish frontier. On arriving there, they continued their journey to Vyborg. Taken to a sanatorium in Ranha, they anxiously awaited their parents' arrival. Their father never made it. Grand Duke Paul was killed in January 1919, and tossed into a heap along with the bodies of other victims. The following month, Princess Olga joined her daughters in Finland.|$|E
5000|$|In {{railroad}} terminology, a stock car, cattle car or <b>cattle</b> <b>wagon</b> (British English) {{is a type}} {{of rolling}} stock used for carrying livestock (not carcasses) to market. A traditional stock car resembles a boxcar with louvered instead of solid car sides (and sometimes ends) for the purpose of providing ventilation; stock cars can be single-level for large animals such as cattle or horses, or they can have two or three levels for smaller animals such as sheep, pigs, and poultry. Specialized types of stock cars have been built to haul live fish and shellfish and circus animals such as camels and elephants. Until the 1880s, when the Mather Stock Car Company and others introduced [...] "more humane" [...] stock cars, loss rates could be quite high as the animals were hauled over long distances. Improved technology and faster shipping times have greatly reduced losses.|$|E
50|$|Given their {{dimensions}} and features, <b>cattle</b> <b>wagons</b> {{have been used}} as vehicles for forced mass transfer and deportation of people. Holocaust trains were railway transports run by the Deutsche Reichsbahn national railway system under the strict supervision of the German Nazis and their allies, for the purpose of forcible deportation of the Jews, as well as other victims of the Holocaust, to the German Nazi concentration, forced labour, and extermination camps.|$|R
50|$|In 1852, the Battle of Dimawe occurred. Boer farmers {{raided the}} settlement, {{stealing}} <b>cattle,</b> <b>wagons,</b> and women, {{but through the}} command of Sechele, the Bakwena successfully defended their settlement. The raid and the ongoing drought caused unrest among the Bakwena so they left the settlement. Livingstone also left the mission for Cape Town to restock for his future travels further inland while {{his wife and children}} returned to England.|$|R
50|$|The {{deportation}} of the Jewish {{residents to}} their deaths in the East quickened in pace after Kristallnacht. Their property and valuables were taken by the Gestapo before deportation, and they were subjected to extreme violence during transport to the stations for the <b>cattle</b> <b>wagons</b> which carried them east. Most ended up in new ghettoes established by the Nazis such as the Warsaw Ghetto before their murder in camps such as Sobibor, Belzec and Treblinka.|$|R
5000|$|Esther often feels [...] "fouled by her parents´ past". She {{is haunted}} by her dead mother. She is preoccupied with the Holocaust and owns more than 400 books on the subject. Her {{thoughts}} {{about the lives of}} Jews during the Third Reich are again and again woven into the novel. She ponders about medical experiments conducted by Nazi physicians; about the gas chambers in the death camps, implicitly comparing a crowded New York subway with a <b>cattle</b> <b>wagon</b> to Auschwitz; the Nazis making soap with human fat; Pope Pius XII and Roman Catholicism; displaced Jews after World War II; anti-Semitism in general; Neo-Nazis in Germany and Austria; the world population of Jews in 1939 and today and {{the fact that there were}} [...] "no Jews left" [...] in Poland after World War II; business in the DP camps (i.e. bartering with cigarettes), coffee but also Nazi memorabilia; and she considers with disgust a video game on CD-ROM entitled [...] "How to Survive the Holocaust".|$|E
50|$|The {{logistics}} of the Reichsbahn were {{also an important}} factor during the Holocaust. Jews were transported like cattle to the concentration and extermination camps by the Deutsche Reichsbahn in trains of covered goods wagons, so-called Holocaust trains. These movements using <b>cattle</b> <b>wagons,</b> for example, from the goods station of the great Frankfurt Market Hall thus {{played a significant role}} in the genocide within the extermination machinery of the Holocaust. In 1997, the market erected a memorial plaque in recognition of this dark period of history.|$|R
5|$|In 1895 two new {{passenger}} carriages, each accommodating 40 passengers, {{were bought}} by the Oxford & Aylesbury Tramroad Company from the Bristol Wagon & Carriage Works {{as part of the}} programme of improvements in anticipation of the extension to Oxford. On 4 October 1899 the MR loaned the O an eight-wheeled 70seat passenger carriage. Following the takeover of the O by the MR, goods services were operated by a fleet of five eight-wheeled carriages built in 1865–66. Two <b>cattle</b> <b>wagons</b> were added to the line's stock in the 1920s.|$|R
50|$|On 18 January 1945, {{the death}} march began for the prisoners of Auschwitz. On {{the second day}} of the march the group reached Gleiwitz (Gliwice), where they were loaded onto open <b>cattle</b> <b>wagons</b> and sent to Buchenwald {{concentration}} camp. Upon arrival the SS soldiers accompanying the Auschwitz inmates discovered that Buchenwald was full, and could no longer take on any inmates. From Buchenwald they were then sent to Mittelbau-Dora, a new site for the V2 production since bombing raids on the Peenemünde facility threatened to end the project.|$|R
25|$|Most of the synagogues in Frankfurt were {{destroyed}} by the Nazis on Kristallnacht in late 1938, deportation of the Jewish residents to their deaths in the Nazi concentration camps quickening in pace after the event. Their property and valuables were stolen by the Gestapo before deportation, and they were subjected to extreme violence and sadism during transport to the train stations for the <b>cattle</b> <b>wagons</b> which carried them east. Most later deportees (after the war began in 1939) ended up in new ghettoes established by the Nazis such as the Warsaw Ghetto and the Lodz ghetto, before their final transportation and murder in camps such as Sobibor, Belzec and Treblinka.|$|R
50|$|More than 10,000 {{members of}} the 51st (Highland) Division were taken {{prisoner}} at St Valery. They were marched to Germany, via Belgium, following the route over which the Germans had advanced against them. Their destination was Stalag XX-A at Toruń, about 120 mi north-west of Warsaw. Some were loaded into canal barges for part of their journey, but all eventually travelled by train in <b>cattle</b> <b>wagons.</b> There were some notable escapes, mostly {{in the early stages}} of the march. Of the 290 British Army POW escapers who had returned to Britain by the end of June 1941, 134 were {{members of the}} 51st (Highland) Division.|$|R
