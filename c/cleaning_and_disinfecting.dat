Local doctors were commonly using frankincense, myrrh, olive oil, resins from trees, wormwood, bitter herbs in water, and mandrake. Trepanning of the skull was also in use (a technique used since 10000 BC. This was thought to release the ‘bad spirits’ and was used in epilepsy, headaches and head injuries. They used a famous ‘poultice of figs’ to cure boils and the local healers had a concept of <b>cleaning,</b> washing <b>and</b> <b>disinfecting</b> the water. Common diseases in Cyprus were those in every Mediterranean country, namely food poisoning, sun stroke, tuberculosis and polio. Drought affected the water supplies making the water poisonous. Other common diseases were leprosy, skin infections, boils, eye infections (due to dust and flies), fractures and injuries. Epidemics such as bubonic plague were common. Many believed that healing was possible by believing in God, and the healers used special rituals, charms and incantations. The sick were looked after in local sanctuaries, {{under the care of}} priests.|$|R
40|$|Frequently used hand-touch {{surfaces}} in hospital settings have been implicated {{as a vehicle}} of microbial transmission. In this study, we aimed to investigate the overall bacterial population on four frequently used surfaces using a culture-independent Illumina massively parallel sequencing approach of the 16 S rRNA genes. Surface samples were collected from four sites, namely elevator buttons (EB), bank machine keyboard buttons (BMKB), restroom surfaces, and the employee biometric time clock system (EBTCS), in a large public and teaching hospital in Sao Paulo. Taxonomical composition revealed the abundance of Firmicutes phyla, followed by Actinobacteria and Proteobacteria, {{with a total of}} 926 bacterial families and 2832 bacterial genera. Moreover, our analysis revealed the presence of some potential pathogenic bacterial genera, including Salmonella enterica, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Staphylococcus aureus. The presence of these pathogens in frequently used surfaces enhances the risk of exposure to any susceptible individuals. Some of the factors that may contribute to the richness of bacterial diversity on these surfaces are poor personal hygiene and ineffective routine schedules of <b>cleaning,</b> sanitizing, <b>and</b> <b>disinfecting.</b> Strict standards of infection control in hospitals and increased public education about hand hygiene are recommended to decrease the risk of transmission in hospitals among patients...|$|R

25|$|The most {{important}} aspect of treatment is improving denture hygiene, i.e. removing the denture at night, <b>cleaning</b> <b>and</b> <b>disinfecting</b> it, and storing it overnight in an antiseptic solution. This is important as the denture is usually infected with C. albicans which will cause re-infection if it is not removed. Substances which are used include solutions of alkaline peroxides, alkaline hypochlorites (e.g. hypochlorite, which may over time corrode metal components of dental appliances), acids (e.g. benzoic acid), yeast lytic enzymes and proteolytic enzymes (e.g. alcalase protease). The other aspect of treatment involves resolution of the mucosal infection, for which topical antifungal medications are used (e.g. nystatin, amphotericin, miconazole, fluconazole or itraconazole). Often an antimicrobial mouthwash such as chlorhexidine is concurrently prescribed. Possible underlying disease (diabetes, HIV) should be treated where possible.|$|E

40|$|A {{series of}} four field trials were {{conducted}} to evaluate {{the ability of a}} <b>cleaning</b> <b>and</b> disinfection procedure in swine lairage pens to reduce the prevalence of Salmonella enterica in slaughtered pigs. A <b>cleaning</b> <b>and</b> disinfection procedure was applied to lairage pens at a large Midwest abattoir. Each trial consisted of a cleaned (alkaline chloride detergent) <b>and</b> <b>disinfected</b> (H 2 O 2 plus peracetic acid sanitizer) pen (treated) and a control pen, each holding 90 to 95 pigs for 2 to 3 h before slaughter. Ileocecal lymph nodes, cecal contents, and rectal contents were collected from 45 pigs from each study pen at harvest and cultured for S. enterica. In all trials, <b>cleaning</b> <b>and</b> disinfection reduced the prevalence of S. enterica–positive floor swabs in the treated pen (P, 0. 05). However, the postharvest prevalence of S. enterica–positive pigs varied between trials. In trial 1, {{there was no significant difference}} in the prevalence of S. enterica in pigs between treatment and control groups. In trials 2 and 3, the prevalence of S. enterica was higher in pigs from treated pens versus pigs from control pens (91 % versus 40 %, P, 0. 0001, and 91 % versus 24 %, P, 0. 0001, respectively). In trial 4, the prevalence of S. enterica was lower in pigs from treated pens compared with pigs from control pens (5 % versus 42 %, P, 0. 0001). This study indicates that <b>cleaning</b> <b>and</b> disinfection effectively reduces the amount of culturable S. enterica in lairage pens, but the ability of cleaned <b>and</b> <b>disinfected</b> pens to reduce the prevalence of S. enterica in market-weight pigs remains inconclusive...|$|R

40|$|The last {{decades the}} concern {{for the use of}} the “Advanced Oxidation Technologies-AOT” has {{increased}} because of the need of new, alternative to the conventional ones and environmentally friendly technologies. This term involves the technologies whose effectiveness is based on the production of the OH• radicals. The powerful oxidizing ability of the OH• radicals in combination with their non-selectiveness allows not only the oxidation of the various organic pollutants present in water or wastewater, but also the simultaneously destruction and lysis of the cell membrane of various pathogenic microorganisms. Recently it has demonstrated that semiconducting materials mediating photocatalytic oxidation of organic compounds can be an alternative to conventional methods for the removal of organic pollutants from water and air. The illumination of these particles with energy greater than the bandgap energy of the semiconductor (hv>Eg) produces excited high energy states of electron and hole pairs (e-/h+) that can migrate to the surface of the particle and initiate a wide range of chemical redox reactions, which can lead to complete mineralization of the organic pollutants. An advantage of the photocatalytic process is its mild operating conditions and the fact that it can be powered by sunlight, thus reducing significantly the electric power required and therefore the operating cost. A variety of semiconductor powders (oxides, sulphides, etc) acting as photocatalysts has been used. Most attention has been given to TiO 2 because of its high photocatalytic activity, its resistance to photocorrosion, its biological immunity and low cost. Photocatalysts such as TiO 2 can either be used as powders in a slurry form or as supported films. This study aims at the improvement of the heterogeneous photocatalytic method in <b>cleaning</b> <b>and</b> <b>disinfect</b> potable water <b>and</b> effluent wastewater through the use of different types of TiO 2 electrodes and the parallel use of electric field. The use of TiO 2 as supported film is advantageous for catalyst separation, but poses surface area and mass transfer limitations. To counterbalance these, the use of a conducting substrate offers the possibility of enhancing the photocatalytic activity of TiO 2 overlayer by applying a positive bias on the catalyst in an appropriate electrochemical cell, thus drawing the photogenerated electrons away from the catalyst interface and minimizing recombination with photogenerated holes. The objectives of this study were: a) the synthesis of thermal and particulate TiO 2 electrodes under various experimental conditions, b) the morphological and electrochemical/photoelectrochemical characterization of the electrodes and c) the use of the electrodes with the best photoelectrocatalytic properties in electrocatalytic/photocatalytic and photoelectrocatalytic experiments in order to study the effectiveness of the system in the destruction of pollutants which are characterized by great stability in the environment and the disinfection of potable water. Final objective was the construction of a novel photoelectrocatalytic reactor that can work in a recirculation batch mode, under artificial or solar light, for the oxidation of representable pollutants (chlorophenols, pesticides, dyes) in potable water and wastewater. During the photoelectrochemical oxidation a number of parameters were tested (initial concentration of the pollutants and the microorganisms, pH of the solution, applied potential, intensity of the illumination, the influence of the solution’s volume and electrodes’ type) and proved to be crucial to the efficiency of the above systems. In the long term, the realization of this study’s systems can lead to construction of autonomous systems for water <b>cleaning</b> <b>and</b> disinfection through the exploitation of solar energy; these can contribute to the protection of public health in distant areas, settlements, etc. The use of low cost and no toxic catalysts with activated the aid of solar radiation can be beneficial for areas such as Mediterranean countries which are subject to long sunshine periods and lack of water. ...|$|R
