40|$|Within the {{framework}} of concurrent systems, several verification approaches require as a preliminary step the complete derivation of the state space. Partial-order methods are efficient for reducing the state explosion due to the modeling of parallelism by interleaving. In the case of persistent or sleep sets, only a subset of enable transitions is examined, the derived graph is then a subgraph of the whole graph. The resulting sub-graph {{may be used for}} verifying absence of deadlock or more specific properties. The <b>covering</b> <b>step</b> graph (CSG) approach visits all the transitions, but some independent events are put together to build a single transition step, the firing of this transition step is then atomic. In a CSG, steps of independent transitions are substituted as much as possible to the subgraph which would result from the firing of the independent transitions. The potential benefit of such a substitution may be exponential with respect to the number of "merged" independent transitions. This paper investigates the on-the-fly derivation of <b>covering</b> <b>step</b> graphs preserving failure semantics. Testing Equivalence and CSP semantics are considered...|$|E
40|$|We {{show that}} the problem of {{factoring}} a sum-ofproducts representation of a logic function can be transformed into one of multiple-valued prime generation followed by branch-and-bound covering. We give a factorization method that generates potential Boolean factors by generating the primes of a multiple-valued function with an associated don't-care set. A covering problem is solved wherein a set of primes with minimal cost is selected to obtain a Boolean factorization. This method can exploit Boolean identities in factorization such as a 1 a = 0 and a 1 a = a. Common factors across a set of Boolean functions can be identified by using multiple-output prime generation and covering. We show how all the kernels of an expression can be generated by generating the primes of a multiple-valued function. A <b>covering</b> <b>step</b> can be used to arrive at an algebraic factorization. 1 Introduction Multilevel logic synthesis has been an active research area {{in the past two decades}} [4].

40|$|Abstract. In this article, we give {{a way of}} {{constructing}} an unramified Galoiscover of a hyperelliptic curve. The geometric Galois-group is an elementary abelian 2 -group. The construction does not {{make use of the}} embedding of the curve in its Jacobian and it readily displays all subcovers. We show that the cover we construct is isomorphic to the pullback along the multiplication-by- 2 map of an embedding of the curve in its Jacobian. We show that the constructed cover has an abundance of elliptic and hyperelliptic subcovers. This makes this cover especially suited for covering techniques employed for determining the rational points on curves. Especially the hyperelliptic subcovers give a chance for applying the method iteratively, thus creating towers of elementary abelian 2 -covers of hyperelliptic curves. As an application, we determine the rational points on the genus 2 curve arising from the question whether the sum of the first n fourth powers can ever be a square. For this curve, a simple <b>covering</b> <b>step</b> fails, but a second step succeeds. 1...|$|E

40|$|Homology {{is a tool}} in {{topological data}} {{analysis}} which measures {{the shape of the}} data. In many cases, these measurements translate into new insights which are not available by other means. To compute homology, we rely on mathematical constructions which scale exponentially with the size of the data. Therefore, for large point clouds, the computation is infeasible using classical computers. In this paper, we present a quantum annealing pipeline for computation of homology of large point clouds. The pipeline takes as input a graph approximating the given point cloud. It uses quantum annealing to compute a clique covering of the graph and then uses this cover to construct a Mayer-Vietoris complex. The pipeline terminates by performing a simplified homology computation of the Mayer-Vietoris complex. We have introduced three different clique coverings and their quantum annealing formulation. Our pipeline scales polynomially {{in the size of the}} data, once the <b>covering</b> <b>step</b> is solved. To prove correctness of our algorithm, we have also included tests using D-Wave 2 X quantum processor...|$|E

40|$|A lot of {{work has}} been done over the last decade on the logic {{synthesis}} and technology mapping of field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) based on a single size of lookup table (LUT). A significant part of the FPGA market is occupied by devices based on more than one type of lookup tables. Examples of these heterogeneous LUT-based FPGAs are the Xilinx 4000 series devices. The technology mapping for this class of FPGAs has hardly been considered. This thesis covers work on the synthesis for heterogeneous LUT-based FPGAs. The proposed scheme uses the typical steps of graph covering, decomposition, node elimination and Boolean graph simplification. The <b>covering</b> <b>step</b> is based on the concept of flow networks and cut-computation. A theory is devised that reduces the flow network sizes so that a dynamic programming approach can be used to compute the feasible cuts in the network. An iterative selection algorithm can then be used to compute the set cover of the network. For the decomposition, the conventional bin-packing (cube-packing) algorithm has been extended so that it produces two types of bins. It has also been enhanced to explore several packing possibilities and include cube division and cascading of nodes. The classical functional decomposition method is extended to heterogeneous graphs. In particular, variable partitioning is coupled with other decomposition methods and exploits the structure of the functions. Partial collapsing and re-decomposition are used to re-synthesise the graphs. A strategy for eliminating nodes within a heterogeneous graph is developed. A simplification strategy is also derived from logic optimisation techniques. Comparisons of the mapping results on Xilinx devices show an improvement of over 11 % over existing mapping tools for the same devices. </p...|$|E
