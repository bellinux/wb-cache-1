5|$|On the September 14 {{episode of}} Raw, Nikki defended her title against Charlotte, who pinned Brie after the twins had {{switched}} places {{to win the}} match; however, since the title cannot <b>change</b> <b>hands</b> by disqualification, Nikki retained the championship, and in the process, became the new longest reigning Divas Champion in history, surpassing AJ Lee's previous record of 295 days.|$|E
5|$|Rothbard {{accepted}} the Labor theory of property, but rejected the Lockean proviso, arguing {{that if an}} individual mixes his labor with unowned land then he becomes the proper owner eternally, and that after that time it is private property which may <b>change</b> <b>hands</b> only by trade or gift.|$|E
5|$|The fourth {{match was}} between MVP and Kane for the United States Championship. Kane quickly gained control, but MVP had the {{advantage}} after attacking Kane's injured ribs. Kane came back, and targeted MVP's ribs. Kane dominated until MVP rolled outside the ring and was counted out. Kane won the match, and MVP retained his title as a title could not <b>change</b> <b>hands</b> on a countout.|$|E
50|$|During the American Civil War, the Hampshire Guards and Frontier Riflemen {{joined the}} Confederate Army. Although {{there were no}} major battles in Hampshire County, Romney <b>changed</b> <b>hands</b> at least fifty-six times during the war. It was often a case of one army {{evacuating}} the area allowing the opposing army {{to move into the}} town. This places Romney second behind Winchester as the town that <b>changed</b> <b>hands</b> the most during the American Civil War. On June 11, 1861, it <b>changed</b> <b>hands</b> twice in the same day. Some local Hampshire County historians speculate that Romney actually <b>changed</b> <b>hands</b> more than Winchester but there are no surviving records to support the claim.|$|R

5|$|Batista {{was left}} on his own {{as a result of}} The Legacy attacking Shane McMahon, but {{continued}} to challenge Orton for the WWE Championship. Orton and Batista had a match at Judgment Day, but it ended with Orton intentionally slapping the referee to cause a disqualification, which meant that the championship did not <b>change</b> <b>hands.</b> In their rematch, however, which was held inside a steel cage at the Extreme Rules pay-per-view, Batista won the championship.|$|E
5|$|Not {{wanting to}} carry two {{championship}} belts, Ted DiBiase returned the Million Dollar Championship to the WWF, telling an executive {{that he would}} no longer appear with the belt. Money Inc. defended their tag team title against The Natural Disasters at WrestleMania VIII on April 5 and lost the match by countout. Because titles can only <b>change</b> <b>hands</b> via pinfall or submission, Money Inc. retained the belts. Over the next few months, the teams faced each other in rematches on television and at house shows, but Money Inc. managed to retain the title.|$|E
5|$|On the July 27 {{edition of}} SmackDown!, Khali had his Championship Celebration which was {{interrupted}} by Batista. After Khali fled from the ring, Batista {{announced that he had}} challenged Khali to a match for the World Heavyweight Championship match. At SummerSlam, the two faced each other for the World Heavyweight Championship in a match which Batista won by disqualification after Khali hit him with a chair. Since a championship cannot <b>change</b> <b>hands</b> via countout or disqualification, Khali retained the title.|$|E

5|$|The {{main event}} was a {{standard}} wrestling match, in which Kurt Angle defeated WWE Champion John Cena, after Cena used the Championship belt on Angle, {{leading to a}} disqualification. In WWE, a championship cannot <b>change</b> <b>hands</b> via countout or disqualification, as a result, Cena retained the title. Two featured bouts on the undercard was another standard match, in which Shawn Michaels defeated Chris Masters. The other primary match was a steel cage match, where the ring is enclosed by a steel cage, in which Matt Hardy defeated Edge.|$|E
5|$|The next {{match was}} The Undertaker against Batista in a Last Man Standing Match for the World Heavyweight Championship. At one spot, Undertaker leg dropped Batista through an {{announce}} table. Towards the end, the two fought up the entrance ramp, where Batista speared to The Undertaker off the stage. Neither man {{could get to}} their feet before the referee's count of ten; in result, the match ended in a draw. Due to WWE regulations, titles can't <b>change</b> <b>hands</b> in a Last Man Standing match by a draw, so The Undertaker remained champion.|$|E
5|$|The third {{match was}} between Mickie James and Trish Stratus for the WWE Women's Championship. The match had {{escalated}} outside the ring. When Stratus delivered punches to Mickie, {{who was on}} the second turnbuckle, Mickie threw her over the top rope, causing Stratus to land on her right arm. Afterwards, Mickie choked Stratus with a wristband she was wearing that fell off during the match, therefore giving the win to Stratus by disqualification, but per WWE regulations, a title can only <b>change</b> <b>hands</b> via pinfall or submission therefore Mickie retained the Championship.|$|E

He attempted to auction off the Turk, but owing to low bidding ultimately bought it himself for $400. Only when John Kearsley Mitchell from Philadelphia, Edgar Allan Poe's personal physician and an admirer of the Turk, approached Ohl did the Turk <b>change</b> <b>hands</b> again. Mitchell formed a restoration club and went about the business of repairing the Turk for public appearances, completing the restoration in 1840.|$|E
5|$|DiBiase and Schyster, {{managed by}} Hart, {{defeated}} LOD {{at a house}} show on February 7, 1992 in Denver, Colorado, to win the title. This title win was unusual for professional wrestling, as Money Inc. had not yet debuted as a team on WWF television programming. In addition, the decision to give the championship belts to Money Inc. was made in a hurry, as LOD's Hawk had failed a drug test. The wrestlers were unaware until that night that the title would <b>change</b> <b>hands,</b> and Money Inc.'s win was not immediately acknowledged on television, as WWF programming was taped in advance. The Natural Disasters, upset by Hart's assistance to a rival tag team, fired Hart as their manager and turned face, beginning a feud with Money Inc. over the WWF Tag Team Championship.|$|E
5|$|In {{the next}} match, John Cena faced Randy Orton for the WWE Championship. Cena raging entered {{the ring and}} started beating on Orton until Orton struck Cena down. Orton covered Cena, but Cena kicked out at two. Cena angrily lost control and began beating Orton. The referee Mike Chioda tried to stop Cena from {{continuously}} punching Orton, but Cena continued and was disqualified. Therefore, Orton won the match, but not the title, because titles can't <b>change</b> <b>hands</b> by disqualification. In result, John Cena retained the WWE Championship. Outside the ring, Cena put Orton in the STFU while Cena's father kicked Orton in the head the same way Orton had kicked in his head on a previous episode of Raw. After the match, Jonathan Coachman booked Cena in a Last Man Standing match against Orton for the WWE Title at No Mercy.|$|E

5|$|The first {{championship}} {{defense of}} WrestleMania was between Junkyard Dog and the reigning WWF Intercontinental Heavyweight Champion Greg Valentine, who was accompanied {{to the ring}} by his manager Jimmy Hart. Junkyard Dog began the match in the offensive position, performing headbutts and punches on Valentine. As the action went back and forth, Hart climbed on the ring apron, where Valentine accidentally hit him. Later, Valentine pinned Junkyard Dog with {{his feet on the}} ropes for leverage, which is an illegal maneuver. As a result, Tito Santana ran down to the ring and explained to the referee what had happened and the match was restarted. Junkyard Dog eventually won the match by count-out as Valentine failed to re-enter the ring. Valentine, however, kept his title as titles do not <b>change</b> <b>hands</b> through count-out.|$|E
5|$|Three matches were {{promoted}} for the event. The {{main event}} featured Bo Dallas defending the NXT Championship against Adrian Neville in a ladder match. Neville first won a number one contender match (against Sami Zayn) for Dallas' title on the November 27, 2013 episode of NXT. Neville faced Dallas {{for the title}} on the next episode and won by count-out, which meant that the title did not <b>change</b> <b>hands.</b> Two episodes later, Neville faced Dallas again for the title in a lumberjack match, but lost when lumberjack Tyler Breeze interfered. Neville once again became number one contender after Dallas failed to defeat Neville in a beat-the-clock challenge match on the January 22 episode of NXT that arose due to Dallas' boasting. On the February 5 episode of NXT, Triple H announced that the championship match would be a ladder match at NXT Arrival.|$|E
5|$|Allied columns started pouring {{against the}} French right, {{but not at}} the desired speed, so the French were mostly {{successful}} in curbing the attacks. Actually, the Allied deployments were mistaken and poorly timed: cavalry detachments under Liechtenstein on the Allied left flank had to be placed in the right flank and in the process they ran into and slowed down part of the second column of infantry that was advancing towards the French right. At the time, the planners thought this slowing was disastrous, but later on it helped the Allies. Meanwhile, the leading elements of the second column were attacking the village of Sokolnitz, which was defended by the 26th Light Regiment and the Tirailleurs, French skirmishers. Initial Allied assaults proved unsuccessful and General Langeron ordered the bombardment of the village. This deadly barrage forced the French out, and at about the same time, the third column attacked the castle of Sokolnitz. The French, however, counterattacked and regained the village, only to be thrown out again. Conflict in this area ended temporarily when Friant's division (part of III Corps) retook the village. Sokolnitz was perhaps the most fought over area in the battlefield and would <b>change</b> <b>hands</b> several times as the day progressed.|$|E

5|$|Articles 87 through 89 of the Constitution {{deal with}} how the {{presidency}} can <b>change</b> <b>hands</b> in-between election cycles. The President {{has the ability to}} resign from office at any time under Article 87. The letter of resignation is sent to the House of Representatives and is accepted by them. The President has the ability to be removed from office if his physical or mental health is impaired under Article 88. In order for this to happen, a two-thirds majority must be reached in the House of Representatives and the Council of the Republic on the resolution to remove the President. An ad hoc committee is formed and must make the determination about the state of health before any motion can begin. If the President has committed a grave crime, such as treason, one-third of the House must bring charges against the President formally. The investigation of the charges will be conducted by the Council of the Republic. In order to evict the President from office, a two-thirds majority is needed to vote in favor of conviction. The criminal case is further sent to the Supreme Court for review. The actions of either option must occur one month after the resolution is passed or the action will be considered void by the Constitution.|$|E
5|$|As {{part of the}} 2009 WWE Draft on April 13, Maryse {{was drafted}} to the Raw brand, and in the process, the Divas Championship became {{exclusive}} to Raw. She made her first appearance {{as part of the}} brand on April 27, teaming with Beth Phoenix, Rosa Mendes, and Jillian Hall in a loss to Santina Marella, Mickie James, Brie Bella and Kelly Kelly. Maryse then began feuding with Mickie James after she cost James a number one contender's battle royal, which was eventually won by Kelly Kelly, by spraying hairspray in her eyes. The following week, Maryse lost a championship match against Kelly by disqualification, meaning the championship did not <b>change</b> <b>hands,</b> and won a subsequent rematch by pinfall two weeks later on June 8. At Night of Champions on July 26, Maryse lost the Divas Championship to James. Despite being only the second Divas champion, her reign of 216 days remained the longest in the title's history for nearly five years, until AJ Lee surpassed her reign in January 2014.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} the pay-per-view, Punk {{cashed in}} his Money in the Bank {{contract}} to defeat Jeff Hardy for the World Heavyweight Championship. Punk retained his title in a Triple Threat match against both Edge and Hardy eight days later on the June 15 episode of Raw. At The Bash, Punk lost to Hardy by disqualification after kicking the referee; in the storyline Punk injured his eye and said that he could not see the referee. Because titles do not <b>change</b> <b>hands</b> on a disqualification, Punk retained the championship. Hardy called Punk's eye injury into question, believing it to be feigned. Punk turned heel, claiming to be the moral superior of those who support Hardy due to his drug-free lifestyle. At Night of Champions, Punk lost the championship to Hardy. Their feud continued through SummerSlam, where Punk regained the title in a Tables, Ladders, and Chairs match; afterward, Punk was attacked by The Undertaker. On the August 28 episode of SmackDown, Punk concluded his program with Hardy and achieved his booked goal of excising him from WWE, defeating Hardy in a steel cage match wherein the loser agreed to leave the company.|$|E
