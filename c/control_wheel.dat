25|$|The {{recorded}} {{data shows}} that the No. 1 engine reached a minimum torque level of −9% in Beta range, while No. 2 engine reached a minimum of 0%. This thrust asymmetry was coincident with the aircraft commencing a roll to the left (maximum recorded value of 40 degrees bank). It {{is possible that the}} PF may have made a <b>control</b> <b>wheel</b> input to the right in response to the unanticipated left roll. However, without FDR parameters of <b>control</b> <b>wheel</b> or control surface position the Investigation could not determine if such an input was made. The subsequent application of power to commence the go-around, at approximately 100 feet, coincided with the commencement of a rapid roll to the right and loss of control. The roll continued through the vertical, the right wingtip struck the runway and the aircraft inverted.|$|E
25|$|The Filper {{helicopter}} incorporated many innovative features, {{including a}} conventional <b>control</b> <b>wheel</b> {{instead of the}} typical helicopter flight controls, and plush seating {{in an effort to}} project the light helicopter as simple and easy to fly. The advantages of a tandem rotor included low noise levels, improved performance compared to other rotor systems and greater stability. The design was intended to ease the transition from fixed-wing to rotor aircraft.|$|E
50|$|Primary {{flight control}} is {{achieved}} by use of dual <b>control</b> <b>wheels</b> and rudder pedals. The <b>control</b> <b>wheels</b> operate the elevator and ailerons mechanically through a system of cables, pulleys, push-pull tubes and bell cranks.

25|$|The aircraft's design {{placed the}} wing behind {{the cabin and}} allowed easy entry via automobile-like doors {{on each side of}} the cabin. The {{propeller}} is well protected and provides safety on the ground in comparison to tractor configuration aircraft. The airfoil employed is a NACA 4418 giving high lift and a stable stall characteristics. The flaps are two-position and mechanically operated by a flap handle on the cabin floor between the seats. The engine starter is foot-actuated and the nose-wheel steering is connected to the <b>control</b> <b>wheel.</b>|$|E
25|$|For space reasons, Oldsmobile adopted torsion {{bars for}} the Toronado's front {{suspension}} (the first GM passenger car application of torsion bars in the US, but {{still did not}} duplicate Packard's automatic ride leveling system. On a side note, European Opel and Vauxhall divisions used torsion bars in the 1930s and 1940s), with conventional, unequal-length double wishbones. Rear Toronado suspension was a simple beam axle on single leaf springs, unusual only in having dual shock absorbers, one vertical, one horizontal (allowing it {{to act as a}} radius rod to <b>control</b> <b>wheel</b> movement).|$|E
25|$|After the enroute {{navigation}} {{test flight}} was completed, the AAIB's test pilot flew several approaches to Campbeltown Airport {{with the same}} aircraft while investigators monitored its position on the radar equipment that was used {{the night of the}} accident. When the test aircraft flew the approach as indicated on the navigation chart that was found clipped to the pilot's <b>control</b> <b>wheel,</b> there was a small gap in radar coverage when the aircraft was at its most distant point from the airport, beginning at 10.1nm and ending on the return segment at 9.4nm from the MAC VOR. Other trials were conducted at lower altitudes, and in those trials the coverage gap was widened considerably. Investigators tried approaches at low and descending altitudes involving a steeper left turn to 157° (where the heading bug was set on the HSI), and then flying that heading until intercepting the correct course to the MAC VOR. When this track was flown at 1,400 feet, the last radar contact was at 7.9nm from the MAC VOR. The last radar contact with the accident flight was at 8.1nm from the MAC VOR, at an altitude of 1,340 feet. Flying this track with the accident flight's known and projected descent profile brought the test aircraft to within 0.2nm of the crash site at an altitude of 200 feet, which was within the margin of error for the differences in wind {{on the day of the}} accident and on the day of the test flight.|$|E

500|$|The panel used a DC-3 {{aircraft}} with a cockpit {{identical to}} that of VH-AET to carry out four flight tests with the gyroscope caged. [...] When the automatic pilot was engaged the <b>control</b> <b>wheel</b> moved forward so strongly it was torn from the pilot's hands, and regaining control required use of both hands and significant force. [...] Initial tests showed that when the pilot was unprepared, up to 600ft (183m) could be lost before he identified the problem and disengaged the automatic pilot. [...] On the fourth test the pilot restricted the height loss to 300ft (91m). The panel considered the most likely explanation of the accident was inadvertent engagement of the automatic pilot with the gyroscope caged.|$|E
500|$|The second prototype, VX777, flew in September 1953. More {{representative}} of production aircraft, it was lengthened {{to accommodate a}} longer nose undercarriage leg, featured a visual bomb-aiming blister under the cabin and was fitted with Bristol Olympus 100 engines of [...] thrust. At Falk's suggestion, a fighter-style control stick replaced the <b>control</b> <b>wheel.</b> Both prototypes had almost pure delta wings with straight leading edges. During trials in July 1954, VX777 was substantially damaged in a heavy landing at Farnborough. It was repaired and fitted with Olympus 101 engines of [...] thrust before resuming trials in October 1955. While exploring the high speed and high altitude flight envelope, mild buffeting and other undesirable flight characteristics were experienced while approaching the speed of sound, including an alarming tendency to enter an uncontrollable dive, unacceptable to the Aeroplane and Armament Experimental Establishment (A) at Boscombe Down. The solution included the [...] "phase 2" [...] wing, featuring a kinked and drooped leading edge and vortex generators on the upper surface, first tested on 707A WD480. An auto-mach trimmer introduced a nose-up attitude when at high speeds; the control column had to be pushed rather than pulled to maintain level flight.|$|E
500|$|More {{influential}} {{than the}} 707 in the 698's design was wind-tunnel testing {{performed by the}} Royal Aircraft Establishment at Farnborough, which indicated {{the need for a}} wing redesign to avoid the onset of compressibility drag which would have restricted the maximum speed. Painted gloss white, the 698 prototype VX770 flew {{for the first time on}} 30 August 1952 piloted by Roly Falk flying solo. The prototype 698, then fitted with only the first-pilot's ejection seat and a conventional <b>control</b> <b>wheel,</b> was powered by four Rolls-Royce RA.3 Avon engines of [...] thrust; there were no wing fuel tanks, temporary tankage was carried in the bomb bay. VX770 made an appearance at the 1952 Society of British Aircraft Constructors' (SBAC) Farnborough Air Show the next month when Falk demonstrated an almost vertical bank. After its Farnborough appearance, the future name of the Avro 698 was a subject of speculation; Avro had strongly recommended the name Ottawa, in honour of the company's connection with Avro Canada. Weekly magazine Flight suggested Albion after rejecting Avenger, Apollo and Assegai. The chief of the air staff preferred a V-class of bombers, and the Air Council announced the following month that the 698 would be called Vulcan after the Roman god of fire and destruction. In January 1953, VX770 was grounded for the installation of wing fuel tanks, Armstrong Siddeley ASSa.6 Sapphire engines of [...] thrust and other systems; it flew again in July 1953.|$|E

Thus the life of a space mission depends largely on the performance of the attitude <b>control</b> <b>wheels.</b> The common mode of failure in momentum/reaction wheel is mechanical and mostly related to the bearing and lubrication. This paper presents the design and development of a bearing cartridge assembly including the lubrication system for long-term performance of spacecraft attitude <b>control</b> <b>wheels.</b> The results of both theoretical and experimental analysis are presented. The experimental study of the assembly shows that it can perform continuously for a period of 30 years with reduced frictional losses...|$|R
2500|$|The ERCO 310, which {{included}} a fully cowled engine, made its first flight in October 1937 at College Park Airport and was soon renamed the [...] "Ercoupe". The easy-to-fly design included unique design features, including a large glazed canopy for improved visibility. The prototype 310 featured an ERCO-made inverted four-cylinder engine, the ERCO I-L 116, which was quickly dropped due to its high manufacturing cost compared to the new Continental A-65 horizontal. Lacking rudder pedals, the Ercoupe was flown using only the <b>control</b> <b>wheel.</b> A two-control system linked the rudder and aileron systems, which controlled yaw and roll, with the steerable nosewheel. The <b>control</b> <b>wheel</b> controlled the pitch and the steering of the aircraft, both {{on the ground and}} in the air, simplifying control and coordinated turning and eliminating the need for rudder pedals. A completely new category of pilot's license was created by the CAA for Ercoupe pilots who had never used a rudder pedal.|$|E
2500|$|The TWA Boeing 707 and the Eastern Air Lines Constellation {{approached}} Carmel VORTAC at {{the same}} time as the Boeing 707 from the northwest.

The aircraft appeared to be converging rapidly {{at the same}} altitude. Holt shouted, [...] "Look out," [...] placed his hands on the <b>control</b> <b>wheel,</b> and made a rapid application of up elevator simultaneously with Captain White, causing crew members and passengers to be forced down into their seats.|$|E
2500|$|The {{aircraft}} incorporated aerodynamic control principles {{covered by}} patents issued to Fred Weick, an early aeronautical engineer {{who went on}} to design and market the Ercoupe.

2500|$|Meanwhile, {{airspeed}} {{continued to}} decrease, and the autopilot rolled the <b>control</b> <b>wheel</b> {{to the maximum}} left limit of 23 degrees. As the speed decreased even further, the plane began to roll to the right, even though the autopilot was maintaining the maximum left roll limit. [...] By the time the captain disconnected the autopilot, the plane had rolled over 60 degrees {{to the right and}} the nose had begun to drop. Ailerons and flight spoilers were the only means available to the autopilot to keep the wings level as the autopilot does not connect to the rudder during normal flight. To counteract the asymmetrical forces created by the loss of thrust from the No. 4 engine, it was essential for the pilot to manually push on the left rudder. However, the captain failed to use any rudder inputs at all, before or after disconnecting the autopilot. The resulting uncontrolled flight path is depicted in the diagram.|$|E
2500|$|The two {{different}} wings {{known to have}} been fitted to the Parasol both had constant chord and very square tips. [...] They were of fabric covered wood construction. [...] The quite slender fuselage was a mixture of steel tubes and spruce, square sided aft of the cockpits and rounded forwards. [...] The supercharged 226hp (167kW) Armstrong Siddeley Lynx radial engine was smoothly cowled but with its cylinder heads exposed. [...] The observer sat in the front cockpit, allowing him direct access to the dynamometer. [...] This had a <b>control</b> <b>wheel</b> and dial for the force readings, plus a lever with which he could free, read or lock the instrument. [...] The pilot's cockpit, behind and with a view unobstructed by the wing had two unusual controls associated with the measurements. [...] He could engage a pair of dynamometer cams which limited its movement and that of the wings to the 6mm necessary for a force measurement in case of a dynamometer failure. [...] He also controlled an hydraulic brake which was used to stop the engine during measurements and avoid prop wash interference.
