5|$|In 1923, Gellibrand {{founded the}} Remembrance Club in Hobart, {{with the aim}} of {{encouraging}} returned servicemen in business. Savige visited Gellibrand in Hobart during August 1923, and Gellibrand urged him to set up a similar club in Melbourne. Soon after Savige's return to Melbourne, a group of ex-servicemen met to say farewell to one of their number who was about to go to England. Savige used this opportunity to bring up the idea of a club similar to Gellibrand's Remembrance Club. After several informal meetings, the Melbourne club's inaugural meeting was held in Anzac House, Melbourne. Legacy Australia was founded as an ex-servicemen's club, but soon became a <b>charitable</b> <b>organisation</b> focusing on war widows and orphans. For the next 26years, due to his commitment, energy and enthusiasm, Savige's name became inseparable from both the club and the movement.|$|E
5|$|Today {{the clan}} {{is alive and}} lives as the Clan Maclachlan Society and the Lachlan Trust. The Clan Maclachlan Society {{consists}} of eight branches around the world, including Australia, Britain & Ireland, Canada, New Zealand, and the United States of America. The Lachlan Trust is a registered Scottish <b>charitable</b> <b>organisation</b> which takes donations to preserve the heritage of Clan Maclachlan. The trust, in part with Historic Scotland and the Heritage Lottery Fund, helped raise £100,000 {{for the preservation of}} Kilmorie Chapel, the traditional burying place of the chiefs. The project was completed in 2006, as a memorial to the twenty-fourth chief (the present chief's mother). Further funding from Historic Scotland and the Heritage Lottery Fund has since been approved for the conservation of the old castle and {{the construction of a new}} footbridge over the River Lachlan. Work began in the spring of 2013 with the erection of scaffolding around the west corner of the old castle. The plan is to develop the site for the enjoyment of visitors, with improved pathways, a nature trail and information points about the heritage of the area.|$|E

40|$|The Industry Commission has {{recently}} released a wide ranging draft report on <b>charitable</b> <b>organisations.</b> Part of the Inquiry's {{terms of reference}} required the Commission to examine {{the appropriateness of the}} taxation treatment of charities. The findings of the draft report when combined with the recommendations of the Federal Parliament's Follow the Yellow Brick Road Report point to a systematic review by the Australian Tax Office (ATO) of its dealings with <b>charitable</b> <b>organisations.</b> Generally prevention rather than cure is the better strategy in taxation issues. This article raises a number of issues <b>charitable</b> <b>organisations</b> might consider as part of their prevention strategy. As the ATO administers all the taxes discussed in this article and as the tests for exemption are similar, <b>charitable</b> <b>organisations</b> should find that "getting it right" for one tax means that their affairs will be in order for most taxes...|$|R
