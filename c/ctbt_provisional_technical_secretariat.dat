50|$|The Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization (CTBTO) is an {{international}} organization that will be established upon the entry into force of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty, a Convention that outlaws nuclear test explosions. Its seat will be Vienna, Austria. The organization will be tasked with verifying the ban on nuclear tests and will operate therefore a worldwide monitoring system and may conduct on site inspections. The Preparatory Commission for the CTBTO, and its <b>Provisional</b> <b>Technical</b> <b>Secretariat,</b> were established in 1997 and are headquartered in Vienna, Austria.|$|R
40|$|All {{stations}} {{planned for}} the International Monitoring System (IMS) must be certified by the <b>Provisional</b> <b>Technical</b> <b>Secretariat</b> (PTS) prior to acceptance {{to ensure that the}} monitoring stations initially meet the required specifications. Working Group B of the Preparatory Commission for the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty has established requirements for the quality, availability, and surety of data received at the International Data Centre (IDC). These requirements are verified by the PTS during a 3 -component process that includes initial station assessment, testing and evaluation, and certification. Sandia National Laboratories has developed procedures, facilities, and tools {{that can be used to}} assist in evaluating IMS stations for compliance with certification requirements. System evaluation includes station design reviews, component testing, and operational testing of station equipment. Station design is evaluated for security and reliability considerations, and to ensure that operational procedures and documentation are adequate. Components of the station are tested for compliance with technical specifications, such as timing and noise levels of sampled data, and monitoring of tamper detection equipment. Data sent from the station in an IMS-standard format (CD- 1 or IMS- 1) are analyzed for compliance with the specified protocol and to ensure that the station data (sensor and state-of-health) are accurately transmitted. Data availability and authentication statistics are compiled and examined for problems...|$|R
40|$|On-Site Inspection (OSI) Workshop- 6 met 26 - 30 June 2000 in Vienna, {{hosted by}} the <b>Provisional</b> <b>Technical</b> <b>Secretariat</b> (PTS) of the CTBT Organization. The purpose of the {{workshop}} was to provide guidance on OSI Operational Manual (OM) development for Working Group B (WGB) of the CTBT preparatory Commission (PrepCom) in the general areas of equipment and logistics. The two main sessions of this workshop, titled ''OSI Equipment: Development of Functional and Operational Requirements, Specifications and Application Procedures'' and ''OSI Logistics: Continued Work on Standing Arrangements, Status of Inspectors and Support Equipment Issues'' reflected this focus. For this workshop, the schedule of work was divided into two parts: The {{first half of the}} week were sessions with formal paper presentations and discussion; {{the latter half of the}} week used two smaller subgroups to focus on and discuss separately equipment and logistics issues. Drawing heavily on the results of the five previous workshops, these subgroups produced material to be considered by Working Group B. This provisional material is intended to advance the process of equipment definition and procurement and establish procedures for logistics that can be incorporated into the OSI Operational Manual. The participants agreed that using subgroups in this workshop was an especially effective mechanism for discussion of different expert opinion on technical issues, and that having access to material presented at the previous five OSI workshops was particularly valuable...|$|R
40|$|It is {{expected}} that the establishment of new infrasound stations in the global IMS network by the <b>Provisional</b> <b>Technical</b> <b>Secretariat</b> of the CTBTO in Vienna will commence {{in the middle of}} 1998. Thus, decisions on the final operational design for IMS infrasound stations will have to be made within the next 12 months. Though many of the basic design problems have been resolved, it is clear that further work needs to be carried out during the coming year to ensure that IMS infrasound stations will operate with maximum capability in accord with the specifications determined during the May 1997 PrepCom Meeting. Some of the papers presented at the Workshop suggest that {{it may be difficult to}} design a four-element infrasound array station that will reliably detect and locate infrasound signals at all frequencies in the specified range from 0. 02 to 4. 0 Hz in all noise environments. Hence, if the basic design of an infrasound array is restricted to four array elements, the final optimized design may be suited only to the detection and location of signals in a more limited pass-band. Several participants have also noted that the reliable discrimination of infrasound signals could be quite difficult if the detection system leads to signal distortion. Thus, it has been emphasized that the detection system should not, if possible, compromise signal fidelity. This report contains the workshop agenda, a list of participants, and abstracts and viewgraphs from each presentation...|$|R
40|$|The author {{discusses}} {{legal aspects}} of implementing the Chemical Weapons Convention`s (CWC`s) export and import provisions. These implementing measures are universal, applying {{not only to}} the few States Parties that will declare and destroy chemical weapons, but also to the many States Parties that have never had a chemical weapons program. This new need for national measures to implement multilateral arms control agreements has generated unease due to a perception that implementation may be burdensome and at odds with national law. In 1993, concerns arose that the complexity of integrating the treaty with national law would cause each nation to effectuate the Convention without regard to what other nations were doing, thereby engendering significant disparities in implementation steps among States Parties. As a result, the author and his colleagues prepared the Manual for National Implementation of the Chemical Weapons Convention. The Manual tries to increase understanding of the Convention by identifying its obligations and suggesting methods of meeting them. Here the author discusses progress among several States in actually developing implementing measures for the Convention`s transfer requirements. CWC legislation from australia, Germany, Norway, South Africa, and Sweden were available at this writing in English through the <b>Provisional</b> <b>Technical</b> <b>Secretariat.</b> Of course, {{it is important to note}} that this brief survey necessarily omitted examination of the existing background of other, related domestic laws that these signatories might also have adopted that affect CWC implementation...|$|R
40|$|Good day. It is {{an honor}} to address this {{distinguished}} audience. I am grateful to the Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia for hosting this important gathering and to {{the staff of the}} <b>Provisional</b> <b>Technical</b> <b>Secretariat</b> of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (PTS) for sponsoring it. I also want to express my gratitude to the DePaul University Human Rights Law Institute, the Merck Foundation, and Argonne National Laboratory for supporting my participation here. This workshop is an another excellent opportunity {{for all of us to}} learn from each other about how the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) can become a foundation of arms control in Africa and around the world. At this meeting I speak only for myself, neither for the government of the United States of America nor for any other institution. Today, I shall discuss model national implementing legislation under the CWC. Such implementing legislation is likely to be required in every State Party [...] not only to the few States Parties that will declare and destroy chemical weapons, but also to the many States Parties that have never had a chemical weapons programme. This new need for national measures to implement multilateral arms control agreements has generated unease due to a perception that implementation may be burdensome and at odds with existing national law. In 1993, concerns arose that the complexity of integrating the treaty with national law would cause each nation to implement the Convention without regard to what other nations were doing, thereby causing inconsistencies among States Parties in how the Convention would be carried but...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: After the {{detection}} of treaty-relevant radionuclides in filters or air samples, atmospheric backtracking techniques are employed by the <b>Provisional</b> <b>Technical</b> <b>Secretariat</b> (PTS) of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization (CTBTO) to trace back the measured substances to their potential areas of origin. In {{the case of an}} underground nuclear test, potential sources are co-located with the epicentres of seismic events that may have been triggered by the explosions. Previous studies have shown that predictions or analyses of atmospheric transport can be significantly improved by ensemble techniques. Within the CTBT environment it is important to build confidence in the source-receptor sensitivity (SRS) field based backtracking products issued by the PTS {{in the case of the}} occurrence of treaty relevant radionuclides. Therefore the PTS has set up a highly automated response system together with the Regional Specialized Meteorological Centres of the World Meteorological Organization in the field of dispersion modelling. These Centres have committed themselves to provide the PTS with the same standard SRS fields as calculated by their systems for CTBT relevant cases. The SRS field data standard allows for ensemble dispersion modelling. The parametric inter-comparison among ensemble members has been integrated into the decision making software tool WEB-GRAPE (CTBTO Newsletter Spectrum, 7, page 19). In sensitivity studies we varied the choice of LPDM, and the kind and source of wind field utilized to demonstrate the potential of the following two ensemble dispersion modelling (EDM) methods: a) Multi-model EDM in order to improve the accuracy of a global scale source attribution based on joint CTBTO-WMO experiments in January 2005 (Becker et al., 2007) and December 2007 (Wotawa and Becker, 2008). b) Single-model EDM with different lead times of the wind fields utilized in order to estimate the relative error of forecasted source attribution results in comparison to the analyzed ones c) Single-model EDM with different choices of wind field resolutions for the source receptor sensitivity fields of the same station at Schauinsland in order to assess quality of the PTS standard backtracking results based on the rather coarse 1 º× 1 º horizontal resolution...|$|R
40|$|The <b>Provisional</b> <b>Technical</b> <b>Secretariat</b> (PTS) of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization (CTBTO) {{has been}} ramping-up the {{installation}} of the International Monitoring System (IMS) consisting of a network of seismic, hydroacoustic, infrasound, and radionuclide stations, since its inception in March 1997. Data from these networks are automatically processed at the International Data Centre (IDC) to produce, within a few hours, a series of automatic bulletins called the Standard Event Lists (SEL 1, SEL 2, SEL 3). After analyst review and correction as necessary the Reviewed Event Bulletin (REB) is produced. Additional information about characterization of an event as an earthquake or otherwise is also available in the Standard Event Bulletin (SEB) shortly after production of the REB. The overall process was successfully tested on October 9, 2006 when the Democratic People's Republic of Korea announced and conducted a nuclear test. The standard SEL 1 bulletin was routinely produced {{on the day of the}} event with good results. The event was available in the IDC database 1 hour and 46 minutes after its occurrence and consisted of 13 associated stations, all part of the primary seismic network and ranging in distance from 17 degrees to 151 degrees. The origin time of the event was 1 : 35 : 28 UT, the location at 41. 28 North, 129. 01 East, and depth 0 km. Subsequent SEL 2 and SEL 3 processing did not modify the composition or the location of the event. An additional 9 stations contributed to the event in the REB bulletin. The location of the event was moved slightly to 41. 31 North and 129. 02 East, the origin time being moved earlier by 0. 7 seconds. The surface area of the error ellipse was reduced from 2391 km 2 to 880 km 2 after interactive analysis, and the event was not screened out as an earthquake (IDC does not perform discrimination per se but does screen out events with a high probability of being earthquakes.) At the time of the event, and in addition to standard processing, the IDC was also experimenting with SEL 0, a modified version of its processing sequence designed to produce an automati...|$|R
