40|$|Research es on Arctic aeroso l, {{ice cover}} and cloud <b>cover</b> <b>ha</b> ve {{received}} great attention and it {{related to the}} regional even global climate changing. We here study the distributions and the coupling relationships of AOD, cloud cover (CLD) and ice cover (ICE) in the Greenland Sea (20 °W - 10 °E, 70 °N - 80 °N) during 2003 - 2012. Enhanced statistics methods, such as lag regression method and co -integration analysis method are used for correlation and regression analysis. According to the 10 years satellite data, AOD was high in spring, and low in su mmer. Generally, AOD wa s higher down south and lower up north. CLD and AOD mainly had negative correlation s and ICE and AOD had positive correlation s. According to the lag regression analysis by statistical software EV iews, both t he peaks of CLD and peak s of ICE w ere all 1 month earlier than the peak of AOD. The co -integration test suggested that both ICE(- 1) and CLD(- 1) and AOD were all zero -order integration, and there w as no unit root in the residual, so there all had long -run equilibrium relationship s. ICE and AOD we re stationary series, and the residual ha d no unit root, they we re good coupling. The melting of sea ice and decreasing of cloud cover would all result in the increas ing of the AOD content. However, t he relationship between AOD and CLD wa s weaker than the relationship between AOD and ICE, indicating that the aerosol in Arctic mostly came from the sea {{rather than from the}} air.

Some <b>covers</b> <b>have</b> aroused controversy. Small Axe 6 (1999) was considered controversial for its parodying of Edna Manley’s sculpture “Negro Aroused” (1937). In March 2000, Small Axe 7, guest-edited by Faith Smith, {{was rejected by}} the press for being pornographic. This controversy eventually led to the journal’s departure from University of the West Indies Press.|$|R
