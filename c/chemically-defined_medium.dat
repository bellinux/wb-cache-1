40|$|SummaryObjectiveTo {{determine}} whether the functional properties of tissue-engineered constructs cultured in a <b>chemically-defined</b> <b>medium</b> supplemented briefly with TGF-β 3 can be enhanced with the application of dynamic deformational loading. MethodsPrimary immature bovine cells (2 – 3 months old) were encapsulated in agarose hydrogel (2 %, 30 × 106 cells/ml) and cultured in <b>chemically-defined</b> <b>medium</b> supplemented for the first 2 weeks with transforming growth factor beta 3 (TGF-β 3) (10 μg/ml). Physiologic deformational loading (1 Hz, 3 h/day, 10 % unconfined deformation initially and tapering to 2 % peak-to-peak deformation by day 42) was applied either concurrent with or after the period of TGF-β 3 supplementation. Mechanical and biochemical properties were evaluated up to day 56. ResultsDynamic deformational loading applied concurrently with TGF-β 3 supplementation yielded significantly lower (− 90 %) overall mechanical properties when compared to free-swelling controls. In contrast, the same loading protocol applied after the discontinuation of the growth factor resulted in significantly increased (+ 10 %) overall mechanical properties relative to free-swelling controls. Equilibrium modulus values reach 1306 ± 79 kPa and glycosaminoglycan levels reach 8. 7 ± 1. 6 % w. w. during this 8 -week period and are similar to host cartilage properties (994 ± 280 kPa, 6. 3 ± 0. 9 % w. w.).

40|$|SummaryInjury to {{articular}} cartilage leads to degenerative changes {{resulting in a}} loss of mechanical and biochemical properties. In engineered cartilage, the injury response of developing constructs is unclear. ObjectiveTo characterize the cellular response of tissue-engineered constructs cultured in <b>chemically-defined</b> <b>medium</b> after mechanical insult, either by compression-induced cracking, or by cutting, as a function of construct maturity. MethodsPrimary immature bovine articular chondrocytes (4 – 6 weeks) were encapsulated in agarose hydrogel (2 %, 30 millioncells/mL) and cultured in <b>chemically-defined</b> <b>medium</b> supplemented with Transforming growth factor (TGF) -β 3 (10 ng/mL, first 2 weeks). At early (5 days) and late (35 days) times in culture, subsets of constructs were exposed to mechanical overload to produce a crack in the tissue or were exposed to a sharp wound with a perpendicular cut. Constructs were returned to culture and allowed to recover in static conditions. Mechanical and biochemical properties were evaluated at 2 -week intervals to day 70, and cellular viability was assessed at 2 -week intervals to day 85. ResultsConstructs injured early in culture recovered their mechanical stiffness back to control values, regardless of the mode of injury. Later in culture, when constructs exhibited properties similar to those of native cartilage, compression-induced cracking catastrophically damaged the bulk matrix of the tissue and resulted in permanent mechanical failure with persistent cell death. No such detrimental outcomes were observed with cutting. Biochemical content was similar across all groups irrespective of mode or time of injury. ConclusionsUnlike native cartilage, engineered cartilage constructs exhibit a reparative capacity when the bulk integrity of the developing tissue is preserved after injury...|$|E

40|$|A novel metal-inducible and amplifiable {{metallothionein}} (MT) expression system, pNK, was firstly optimised and characterised for {{the production}} of a reporter protein, human growth hormone (hGH) in a suspension CHO cell line grown in a serum-free media. The pNK-based hGH production was demonstrated in cadmium-free condition under various fermentation modes (batch, fed-batch and perfusion) and scales (flask to bench-top bioreactor). Improvement of specific productivity of recombinant protein from pNK was shown to be possible by addition of butyrate or substrate substitution of glutamine by glutamate. Combination of fed-batch and butyrate addition strategies resulted in more than one gram per litre of hGH being obtained from the pNK expression system in a bioreactor. In {{the second part of the}} project, based on a statistical approach suggested by Plackett-Burman (P-B), a <b>chemically-defined</b> and protein-free <b>medium,</b> named Super-CHO protein-free (SPF), was developed to support a Super-CHO cell line, C 2. 8 - 325, to grow as a single-cell suspension culture with comparable growth rate and viable cell number as observed in a commercial medium containing undefined additives. Using Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium/Ham's F 12 1 : 1 mixture (DMEM/F 12) as the basal medium, a P-B design matrix screened 10 nutritional components. Components shown potentially beneficial for cell growth rate and viable cell number were supplemented to DMEM/F 12 to formulate the SPF medium. Finally, the pNK expression system and the Super-CHO cell line were applied simultaneously in an attempt to express a humanised anti-CD 48 monoclonal antibody (MAb), IgG 1 -N 2 A (N 2 A-MAb). This aimed to test C 2. 8 -SPF grown in newly developed SPF medium for transfection, clone development and recombinant protein production.

40|$|Currently, {{mammalian}} cell technology {{has become the}} focus of biopharmaceutical production, with strict regulatory scrutiny of the techniques employed. Major concerns about the presence of animal-derived components in the culture media {{led to the development of}} serum-free (SF) culture processes. However, cell adaptation to SF conditions is still a major challenge and limiting step of process development. Thus, this study aims to assess the impact of SF adaptation on monoclonal antibody production (mAb), identify the most critical steps of cell adaptation to the SF EX-CELL medium, and create basic process guidelines [...] The success of SF adaptation was dependent on critical steps that included: accentuated cell sensitivity to common culture procedures (centrifugation, trypsinization); initial cell concentration; time given at each step of serum-reduction; and, most importantly, medium supplements used to support adaptation. Indeed, only one of the five supplement combinations assessed (rhinsulin, ammonium metavanadate, nickel chloride and stannous chloride) succeeded for the CHO-K 1 cell line used.

40|$|The tumor-initiating cell (TIC) {{frequency}} of bulk tumor cell populations {{is one of}} the criteria used to distinguish malignancies that follow the cancer stem cell model from those that do not. However, tumor-initiating cell frequencies may be influenced by experimental conditions {{and the extent to which}} tumors have progressed, parameters that are not always addressed in studies of these cells. We employed limiting dilution cell transplantation of minimally manipulated tumor cells from mammary tumors of several transgenic mouse models to determine their tumor-initiating cell frequency. We determined whether the tumors that formed following tumor cell transplantation phenocopied the primary tumors from which they were isolated and whether they could be serially transplanted. Finally we investigated whether propagating primary tumor cells in different tissue culture conditions affected their resident tumor-initiating cell frequency.

40|$|Spoilage of {{red wine}} by the yeast species Dekkera bruxellensis is a common problem for the global wine industry. When {{conditions}} are conducive for growth of these yeasts in wine, they efficiently convert non-volatile hydroxycinnamic acids into aroma-active ethylphenols, thereby reducing {{the quality of the}} wine. It has been demonstrated previously that dissolved oxygen is a key factor which stimulates D.  bruxellensis growth in wine. We demonstrate that whereas the presence of oxygen accelerates the growth of this species, oxygen-limited conditions favour 4 -ethylphenol production. Consequently, we evaluated wine spoilage potential of three D.  bruxellensis strains (AWRI 1499, AWRI 1608 and AWRI 1613) under oxygen-limited conditions. Each strain was cultured in a <b>chemically-defined</b> wine <b>medium</b> and the fermentation products were analysed using HPLC and HS-SPME-GC/MS. The strains displayed different growth characteristics but were equally capable of producing ethylphenols. On the other hand, significant differences were observed for 18 of the remaining 33 metabolites analysed and duo-trio sensory analysis indicated significant aroma differences between wines inoculated with AWRI 1499 and AWRI 1613. When these wines were spiked with low concentrations of 4 -ethylphenol and 4 -ethylguaiacol, no sensorial differences could be perceived. Together these data suggest that the three predominant D.  bruxellensis strains previously isolated during a large survey of Australian wineries do not differ substantively in their capacity to grow in, and spoil, a model wine medium.

40|$|SummaryObjectiveAutologous {{chondrocyte}} implantation is a cell-based {{treatment to}} repair articular cartilage defects, {{relying on the}} availability of expanded (de-differentiated) chondrocytes. Unfortunately, the expansion process causes several phenotypical changes, requiring re-establishment of the native chondrogenic phenotype to sustain proper repair. Among other proteins, transforming growth factor-β (TGFβ) is known to influence the chondrogenic re-differentiation of human articular chondrocytes (HACs) and their matrix deposition. Thus we investigated the effects of TGFβ-depletion during the expansion phase. DesignHACs were isolated from articular cartilage and expanded in the canonical serum-supplemented medium [fetal calf serum (FCS) ] or in a <b>chemically-defined</b> (CD) <b>medium,</b> with or without anti-TGFβ antibody administration. The re-differentiation potential of the cells was assessed by pellet cultures, gene expression analysis and histology. ResultsCell proliferation proceeded more rapidly in CD-medium than in FCS-medium; it was not affected by the use of anti-TGFβ antibody but was further increased by addition of exogenous TGFβ 1, via increased p-Smad 1 / 5 / 8. Conversely, in FCS-medium, addition of anti-TGFβ antibody decreased both proliferation and p-Smad 1 / 5 / 8 level. Challenging either FCS- or CD-medium with anti-TGFβ antibody during expansion enhanced chondrogenesis in the subsequent pellet cultures. Moreover, TGFβ-depletion during expansion in CD-medium inhibited mRNA expression of hypertrophic markers, collagen type-X (COL 10) and matrix metalloproteinase- 13 (MMP- 13). Interestingly, the TGFβ 1 level detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent sandwich assay (ELISA) during cell expansion was correlated with COL 10 mRNA expression after re-differentiation. ConclusionTGFβ-depletion during expansion improves the re-differentiation capacity of chondrocytes and inhibits hypertrophy. These results indicate the importance of the expansion medium composition to improve chondrogenic re-differentiation and to inhibit hypertrophy...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{mechanisms}} that govern human neural specification {{are not completely}} characterized. Here we used human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) to study the role of fibroblast growth factor (FGF) -signaling in early human neural specification. Differentiation was obtained by culturing clusters of hESCs in <b>chemically-defined</b> <b>medium.</b> We show that FGF-signaling, which is endogenously active during early differentiation of hESCs, induces early neural specification, while its blockage inhibits neuralization. The early neuralization effect of FGF-signaling is not mediated by promoting the proliferation of existing neural precursors (NPs) or prevention of their apoptosis. The neural instructive effect of FGF-signaling occurs after an initial FGF-independent differentiation into primitive ectoderm-like fate. We further show that FGF-signaling can induce neuralization by a mechanism which is independent of modulating bone morphogenic protein (BMP) -signaling. Still, FGF-signaling is not essential for hESC neuralization which can occur {{in the absence of}} FGF and BMP-signaling. Collectively, our data suggest that human neural induction is instructed by FGF-signaling, though neuralization of hESCs can occur in its absence...|$|E

Cells of K. aeroqenes growing in <b>chemically-defined</b> synthetic <b>medium</b> exhibited a characteristic thermogram (heat output time curve). Oxygen depletion in the growing culture led to increasing fermentation, and growth ceased when the glucose was used up. Subsequently, acidic fermentation products were used as energy sources. Sub-lethal concentrations of penicillin G, carbenicillin, methicillin, nalidixic acid, gentamicin, proflavine and sulphanilamide all decreased {{the rate of growth}} of cells of K. aerogenes; the greater the concentration, the greater the effect. The pattern of the heat evolution of the growing cells was also altered by growth {{in the presence}} of the antibacterials, as compared with drug-free growth. Very pronounced changes in the heat output were observed at high drug concentrations. The results are discussed in terms of changes in metabolic pathways brought about by the presence of the drug. The effects of any given antibacterial was largely reduced when used against cells which had been trained to grow in the presence of that agent. Cells of an R-factor mediated gentamicin-resistant strain of P. aeruginosa growing in synthetic medium exhibited a thermogram which was quite different from those of cells of three other strains of differing sensitivity to gentamicin. Sub-lethal concentrations of gentamicin decreased the rate of growth of cells of P. aeruginosa strains and altered the pattern of heat output. Small exothermic heat changes accompanied bacterial surface/gentamicin interactions. Chemical analysis of whole cells of P. aeruginosa strains revealed differences in lipid, protein, amino acid and polysaccharide content between a very highly gentamicin-resistant strain and other resistant and sensitive strains. <p...|$|R

To identify the polypeptide carrying the antigenic determinant, BALB/c mice were immunized with the enriched isolate and their splenic lymphocytes were fused with mouse plasmacytoma cells. Eight hybrids were cloned and produced MAbs that immunoprecipitated principally a single chain of MW 40, 000 (p 40) as well as minor chains of MW 25, 000 (p 25) and MW 13, 000 (p 13) which were probably degradation products of p 40. On 2 D gels, p 40 was composed of 7 spots with a pI of 6. 1 to 7. 6, which was not altered by neuraminidase digestion. Affinity chromatography with MAb anti-p 40 absorbed p 40 and LAI activity. The bound and recovered fraction was enriched for p 40 and LAI activity. Affinity-purified p 40 contained the previously identified p 25 and p 13 as well as a MW 32, 000 polypeptide (p 32). MAb anti-p 40 was directed to a common framework determinant on p 40 since MAb anti-p 40 bound to cancer cells from other organs.

40|$|Hydrogen sulfide (H 2 S) {{production}} by strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae was compared using bismuth-containing indicator media and fermentations in model grape juice. Discoloration of yeast colonies on indicator media {{resulting from the}} production of H 2 S was essentially independent of nitrogen, sulfite, and glucose levels or the availability of oxygen. Discoloration on bismuth-containing test media did not correlate with H 2 S production in a complete <b>chemically-defined</b> grape juice <b>medium</b> in which only trace amounts of H 2 S were produced. By comparison, discoloration on bismuth-containing test media correlated with H 2 S production developing after nitrogen depletion in a nitrogen-limited liquid medium. It is proposed, therefore, that intensity of discoloration on bismuth-containing indicator media {{is an indication of}} the maximum genetically determined sulfite reductase activity for a given strain. While a high sulfite reductase activity does not necessarily predispose a strain to excessive H 2 S production in complete media, the indicator-media test does appear to predict a high degree of H 2 S production following nitrogen starvation in liquid media. This screening protocol is therefore valid for assigning the H 2 S-producing potential of a strain under permissive conditions.

40|$|AbstractWe {{studied the}} {{metabolism}} of sphingolipids by oligodendrocytes derived from rat spinal cord by providing lipid vesicles with either N-lissamine-rhodaminyl-ceramide (LRh-Cer) or N-(7 -nitrobenz- 2 -oxa- 1, 3 -diazol- 4 -yl) -ceramide (NBD-Cer) to the cells cultured in a <b>chemically-defined</b> <b>medium.</b> With both probes them the fluorescent product {{turned out to}} be sphingomyelin (SM). Most or LRh-SM was not cell-associated but recovered from the culture medium, probably due to back-exchange to the lipid vesicles. The accumulation of LRh-SM, both in the cells and in the medium, was inhibited in the presence of monensin or brefeldin A, whereas the production of NBD-SM was much less affected by these Golgi perturbing drugs. With LRh-Cer as substrate, LRh-labelled fatty acid (FA), galactosyl- and sulfogalactosyl-ceramides (GalCer and SGalCer) were also formed. NBD-Cer, however, was metabolized to glucosylecramide (GlcCer) and GalCer but not to SGalCer or NBD-FA. These data demonstrate that chemical modifications of ceramide alter its metabolism in oligodendrocytes and that the metabolites of LRh-Cer reflect the glycolipid composition of myelin more closely than those of NBD-Cer...|$|E
40|$|This study set out {{to analyse}} C. pseudotuberculosis within an {{environment}} relevant to that which would be encountered within its natural host. The impact {{of the availability of}} iron within the growth environment of numerous bacteria has been widely reported, and an equivalent investigation was conducted to determine whether the same was true of C. pseudotuberculosis. To this end, a novel <b>chemically-defined</b> <b>medium</b> was designed, which supported the growth of C. pseudotuberculosis, but in which the concentration of specific growth factors could be manipulated. Subsequently, iron was shown to be essential for C. pseudotuberculosis growth, and analysis of secreted protein profiles revealed differential expression between low- and high-iron growth conditions. Furthermore, growth experiments conducted in the defined medium revealed that C. pseudotuberculosis is capable of obtaining iron from the host iron-binding proteins, transferrin and lactoferrin. The results presented in this thesis confirm the importance of iron to C. pseudotuberculosis, and reveal the existence of an iron-dependent regulator which is involved in regulating the expression of multiple target genes...|$|E
40|$|Teich{{uronic acid}}s are heteropolymers {{containing}} uronic acid and other carbohydrate residues but little (if any) phosphorus; they {{are present in}} walls of some Gram-positive bacteria. White & Gilvarg (I 977) isolated a teichuronic acid containing glucuronic acid, rhamnose and glucose from walls of Bacillus megaterium ~ 4 6. No teichoic acid was present in these walls, whereas Ghuysen, Leyh-Bouille & Dierickx (I 962) found a teichoic acid as {{a major component of}} walls of B. megaterium KM. Ellwood & Tempest (1972) showed that this polymer was replaced by a teichuronic acid when strain KM was grown with phosphorus-limitation in a chemostat.

40|$|Advancements in {{groundwater}} remediation technologies increasingly rely on {{in situ treatment}} {{approaches and}} reactive nanoparticle materials. Environmental assessments of both trends were conducted for applications where reduced iron media, zero valent iron (ZVI) and iron monosulfide (FeS), are employed. In situ technologies, such as permeable reactive barriers (PRBs), {{eliminate the need for}} energy-intensive plume extraction but require greater material resources. The environmental impacts of a PRB and an ex situ pump-and-treat system were compared using life cycle assessment. While the ZVI PRB has better environmental performance in some categories, an alternative reactive media may give significant improvements in global warming potential. The environmental benefits of PRBs are sensitive to the longevity of the reactive medium. The PRB was preferable in all categories when design-life exceeded ten years. 	Injection of nanosized reactive media can allow installation of PRBs at greater depths than direct emplacement of granular media, but release of engineered nanoparticles may affect soil microbial communities. The effect of nano ZVI (nZVI) on Escherichia coli was investigated under anaerobic conditions in a <b>chemically-defined</b> growth <b>medium</b> buffered at pH 7. E. coli growth was reduced in the presence of 2. 9 E- 05 M to 5. 7 E- 03 M nZVI relative to a negative control, and relative growth was a bimodal function of nZVI concentration. Equilibrium speciation modeling of the growth medium in the presence of nZVI predicts low electron activity and high ferrous iron concentrations, which may be related the reduction in growth. 	FeS nanoparticles are an alternative to nZVI for in situ remediation, and may have similar effects on microorganisms. The effect of FeS on E. coli under anaerobic growth conditions was investigated. E. coli growth was reduced in the presence of 2. 6 E- 05 M to 5. 3 E- 3 M FeS. Below the solubility limit, 6. 0 E- 04 M FeS, relative growth in the presence of FeS was similar to growth in the presence of dissolved sulfide. Relative growth did not decrease with FeS concentration above the solubility. Speciation modeling predicts the formation metal sulfide precipitates as FeS or dissolved sulfide is added, which {{may be related to the}} reduction in growth...|$|R
40|$|Biofilms {{influence}} the transport and fate of heavy metals in aquatic environments both directly by adsorption and complexation reactions and indirectly via interactions with oxides {{of iron and}} manganese. These reactions were investigated by introducing lead into a continuous-flow biofilm reactor {{that was designed to}} simulate conditions in a flowing freshwater aquatic environment. The reactor provided controlled conditions, and use of a <b>chemically-defined</b> growth <b>medium</b> allowed calculation of lead speciation with a chemical equilibrium program (MINEQL). Pseudomonas cepacia was employed as a test cell strain because of its ability to grow and form biofilms in the defined medium. This bacterium affected lead distribution in the reactor by adsorbing lead both to adherent and suspended cells. When the aqueous bulk lead concentration was 1. 4 ± 0. 1 µM and biofilm coverage (measured as chemical oxygen demand, COD) was 50 mequiv COD/m 2, lead adsorption was increased by about a factor of five relative to bare glass. Of the total lead in solution, only 1 % was adsorbed to suspended cells (5 x 107 cells/ml). Lead adsorption to biofilms followed a Langmuir isotherm with a maximum adsorption (Γ max) of 56 µmol Pb/equiv COD and an adsorption equilibrium constant (K) of 0. 64 liter/µmol Pb. Lead complexed with dissolved bacterial exopolymer was below detection limits. Pretreatment of glass slides with colloidal iron also significantly increased lead adsorption relative to bare glass. Lead adsorption to adsorbed iron fit a Langmuir isotherm with Γmax = 50 µmol Pb/mol Fe, and K = 1. 3 liter/µmol Pb. Lead binding to glass coated with both cells and iron was additive, and could be predicted by summing adsorption predicted using isotherms for each constituent. The presence of iron surface coatings increased initial biofilm formation rates, but after reaching steady state conditions, biofilm coverage was similar for slides treated with iron and untreated slides. A concentration of 1 µM lead produced a transient reduction in suspended cell counts. Cell counts recovered to the original cell density over the course of five to ten reactor retention times. With iron present, the magnitude of the reduction in cell concentration in response to the addition of lead was greatly reduced, suggesting that toxic effects of lead may be reduced by iron...|$|R
40|$|Several {{species of}} the {{opportunistic}} fungal pathogen Candida produce an extracellular aspartyl proteinase that may assist the organism to invade and colonize host tissues, evade the host immune response and assimilate nitrogen from proteinaceous sources. Although addition of exogenous proteins, such as bovine serum albumin (BSA), to cultures of C. albicans is known to elicit proteinase production, the precise molecular mechanisms controlling regulation of proteinase induction are unknown. We have examined {{the ability of a}} variety of macromolecules to induce proteinase production using a <b>chemically-defined</b> nitrogen-limited growth <b>medium</b> and a rapid, sensitive microtitre fluorescent assay for proteinase activity in culture supernatants. BSA and the extracellular matrix protein collagen induced proteinase production. Homopolymers of both poly-L- and poly-D-glutamate also induced proteinase activity, whereas polyglycine, heparin sulphate and dextran sulphate did not. Thus, molecular recognition of proteinase-inducing stimuli is not highly stereospecific, but apparently requires both main- and side-chain interactions. Peptides 8 or more residues in length generally induced proteinase production while most shorter peptides did not. These data reveal that internalization of small peptides with less than 7 residues by peptide transport was not the inducing signal for proteinase production, since Candida dipeptide and oligopeptide permeases do not efficiently transport peptides of more than 6 - 7 residues. In addition a tight-binding synthetic inhibitor of Candida proteinase (Ki = 0. 17 m) prevented growth of C. albicans on BSA as a sole nitroge...|$|R
40|$|Abstract The {{effect of}} Chlorhexidine digluconate (CHX) on the uptake and {{catabolism}} of arginine (arg) by Streptococcus sanguis P 4 A 7 was investigated since {{the ability to}} use this amino acid {{may play a role in}} its existence in dental plaque. Organisms were grown glucose-limited in continuous culture in a <b>chemically-defined</b> <b>medium.</b> Washed cells, resuspended in a salt solution, were exposed to various concentrations of CHX prior to the addition of arg. Uptake of arginine and the appearance of its catabolites were monitored by HPLC analysis of cell suspension filtrates. At pH 7. 0 and 5. 5, both uptake and breakdown were progressively reduced by 0. 06 and 0. 12 mM CHX and these effects were even more marked in the presence of 0. 24 mM CHX, which also reduced cell viability. The glycolytic rate was also progressively reduced as the level of CHX was raised from 0. 06 to 0. 24 mM. The arginine deiminase pathway, as well as glycolysis, is thus depressed by sub-inhibitory concentrations of CHX and it is suggested that this could have far-reaching effects on overall plaque metabolism.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to develop a <b>chemically-defined</b> <b>medium</b> that is capable of {{supporting}} and detecting the metabolism of nutritionally-fastidious Lactic Acid Bacteria (LAB). The resultant Kim Menon Sturino (KMS) medium is comprised of only twelve chemically-defined ingredients. In order to increase the bioavailability of hydrophobic chemical additives, such as the isoflavone genistein (4 ', 5, 7 -trihydroxyisoflavone), tween 80 was incorporated into the final medium at high levels (10 % v/v). Furthermore, a commercial redox indicator was supplemented to the final formulation in order to facilitate the indirect assessment of cellular metabolism through the direct measurement of medium coloration. As proof of concept, the KMS medium was used to identify LAB with specific enzyme activities of interest, specifically ?-glycoside hydrolase activity. In this model system, LAB were screened for their capacity to catabolize genistin (Gin^(+)), a glucoside (glycone) of genistein (genistein 7 -O-?-D-glucoside) or its complementary aglycone, genistein (Gen^(+)). Of the fifteen strains screened, none were Gen^(+) while L. pentosus was reproducibly Gin^(+). As a result of this work, we conclude that L. pentosus expresses one or more ?-glycoside hydrolases capable of hydrolyzing the glucose associated with genistin and fermenting it...|$|E
40|$|The Altered Schaedler Flora (ASF) {{is a model}} {{microbial}} community with both in vivo and in vitro relevance. Here we provide the first characterization of the ASF community in vitro, independent of a murine host. We compared the functional genetic content of the ASF to wild murine metagenomes {{and found that the}} ASF functionally represents wild microbiomes better than random consortia of similar taxonomic composition. We developed a <b>chemically-defined</b> <b>medium</b> that supported growth of seven of the eight ASF members. To elucidate the metabolic capabilities of these ASF species—including potential for interactions such as cross feeding—we performed a spent media screen and analyzed the results through dynamic growth measurements and non-targeted metabolic profiling. We found that cross-feeding is relatively rare (32 of 3 570 possible cases), but is enriched between Clostridium ASF 356 and Parabacteroides ASF 519. We identified many cases of emergent metabolism (856 of 3 570 possible cases). These data will inform efforts to understand ASF dynamics and spatial distribution in vivo, to design pre- and probiotics that modulate relative abundances of ASF members, and will be essential for validating computational models of ASF metabolism. Well-characterized, experimentally tractable microbial communities enable research that can translate into more effective microbiome-targeted therapies to improve human health...|$|E
40|$|Here, {{we present}} {{evidence}} that the tumor-like growth of mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) is suppressed by short-term serum-free culture, which is reversed by pharmacological inhibition of Gsk 3 b. Mouse ESCs maintained under standard conditions using fetal bovine serum (FBS) were cultured in a uniquely formulated <b>chemically-defined</b> serum-free (CDSF) <b>medium,</b> namely ESF 7, for three passages before being subcutaneously transplanted into immunocompromised mice. Surprisingly, the mESCs failed to produce teratomas {{for up to six}} months, whereas mESCs maintained under standard conditions generated well-developed teratomas in five weeks. Mouse ESCs cultured under CDSF conditions maintained the expression of Oct 3 / 4, Nanog, Sox 2 and SSEA 1, and differentiated into germ cells in vivo. In addition, when mESCs were cultured under CDSF conditions supplemented with FBS, or when the cells were cultured under CDSF conditions followed by standard culture conditions, they consistently developed into teratomas. Thus, these results validate that the pluripotency of mESCs was not compromised by CDSF conditions. Mouse ESCs cultured under CDSF conditions proliferated significantly more slowly than mESCs cultured under standard conditions, and were reminiscent of Eras-null mESCs. In fact, their slower proliferation was accompanied by the downregulation of Eras and c-Myc, which regulate the tumor-like growth of mESCs. Remarkably, when mESCs were cultured under CDSF conditions supplemented with a pharmacological inhibitor of Gsk 3 b, they efficiently proliferated and developed into teratomas without upregulation of Eras and c-Myc, wherea...|$|R
40|$|The {{interaction}} of high-Mg calcite and aragonite {{with a number}} of different trace metals was studied, in particular with Cu 2 +, Ni 2 + and Co 2 +. Laboratory experiments into the initial sorption of these three metal ions onto the surfaces of artificial aragonite and high-Mg calcite were performed for a pH range of 6. 8 - 8. 2, in buffered solutions saturated with respect to calcite. Below a pH of 8 - 8. 2, substantial dissolution of the unstable polymorph occurred, with little uptake of Co 2 + or Ni 2 +. At a pH of 8. 2, uptake was rapid, reaching a plateau in less than 5 min for all three metals. A higher proportion of the available Cu 2 + was taken up than of the available Co 2 + or Ni 2 +. Two environmental situations were also investigated. Firstly, samples of water, rock and aragonitic speleothems from Bohemia Cave, Mt. Owen, central Nelson, were examined for major and trace element concentrations. Water samples from the area were found to have very low trace metal ion concentrations, and little consistent relationship between the level of interaction with the environment and the trace metal concentration was seen. Concentration factors of trace metals into the speleothems were much larger than concentration factors of minor or major elements. Metal concentrations in the speleothems were lower than in the surrounding rocks, due to the slow deposition rate of the aragonite crystals, and the exclusion of small cations from the lattice of aragonite. Speleothem samples were analysed by electron microscopy, and structures are described. Secondly, uptake of sub-lethal concentrations of Cu 2 +, Ni 2 + and Co 2 + by Corallina officinalis (Corallinales, Rhodophyta) was studied, from a <b>chemically-defined</b> artificial seawater <b>medium.</b> Cu 2 + was found to be toxic at even low levels of contamination. All three metal ions were taken up by the live seaweed, in proportion to the metal concentration of the medium. Partitioning of the metal ions was examined, between the inorganic phase of high-Mg calcite, deposited in the plant's cell walls, and the organic material of the plant. Killed seaweed were also "cultured", and found to contain considerably less metal ion than live seaweed. The presence of an increasing excess of Ni 2 + had a negative effect on the uptake of Cu 2 +, but no interaction was seen between Co 2 + and the other metal ions. Concentration factors were greatest for Co 2 +, followed by Cu 2 + and Ni 2 +.

40|$|Using an {{in vitro}} tritiated {{thymidine}} (3 H-dThd) nuclear labeling followed by autoradiography, {{the effects of}} 17 -beta-estradiol (E 2) or progesterone (Pg) on cell proliferation were studied in 22 human benign breast tumors, i. e. 7 fibroadenomas 8 fibrocystic dysplasias 4 gynecomastias and 3 phyllodas. Small tumor fragments were incubated in a <b>chemically-defined</b> <b>medium</b> without serum and were hormonally stimulated in vitro. The procedure used allowed discrimination between weak labeling, suggestive of DNA repair mechanism, and strong labelling, suggesting a true DNA synthesis (S phase). Taking this into account, our results have shown that both estradiol and progesterone can induce in vitro cell replication of both ER+PgR+ and ER-PgR- human breast fibroadenoma, without affecting those of fibrocystic dysplasia, gynecomastia and phylloda. Progesterone, but not estradiol, might significantly decrease DNA repair mechanism in fibrocystic dysplasia, according to the Pg-induced decrease of nuclear incorporation of small amounts of 3 H-dThd. We have thus characterized a dynamic test of hormone dependence which permits in vitro study of the hormonal sensitivity of human benign breast tumors, {{as well as that}} of any other human neoplasm. This test could be of great value to help clinicians to diagnose and treat hormone-dependent neoplasms properly. Its clinical relevance is now under study. status: publishe...|$|E
