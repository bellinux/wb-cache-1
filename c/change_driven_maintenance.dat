40|$|International audienceThe {{self-healing}} {{behavior of}} radial cracks generated by Vickers indentation in float glass is analyzed when heat treated at 620 degrees C under various atmospheres. Results evidence that two main driving forces influence radial crack evolution: release of residual stresses induced by initial indentation and capillary forces due to surface energy minimization. Depending on the viscosity level, viscous flow allows crack morphological <b>changes</b> <b>driven</b> by capillarity forces or not. Our results evidence that at 620 degrees C, the viscosity {{of the glass}} surrounding cracks can be significantly reduced by water diffusion and glass hydrolysis, or increased by glass des-hydration, {{as a function of}} the humidity level of the furnace atmosphere. Hydration and des-hydration of glass are shown to play a major role in the crack morphology changes during healing, respectively, favoring or impeding morphological <b>changes</b> <b>driven</b> by capillarity forces...|$|R
40|$|Glioblastoma (GBM) are {{aggressive}} and therapy-resistant brain tumours driven by glioma stem-like cells (GSCs). GSC behaviour {{is controlled by}} the microenvironment, or niche, in which the cells reside. It is well-established that the vasculature is a key component of the GSC niche, which <b>drives</b> <b>maintenance</b> in the tumour bulk and invasion at the margin. Emerging evidence now indicates that the specific properties of the vasculature within these two regions impose different functional states on resident GSCs, generating distinct subpopulations. Here, we review these recent findings, focusing on the mechanisms that underlie GSC/vascular communication. We further discuss how plasticity enables GSCs to respond to vascular changes by interconverting bidirectionally between states, and address the therapeutic implications of this dynamic response...|$|R
40|$|Value <b>driven</b> <b>{{maintenance}}</b> (VDM) is {{a fairly}} new maintenance management method based on four maintenance value drivers and to calculate the discounted present value (DPV) of the maintenance strategy. However, the dependability of the engineering assets needs to be assessed {{in order to make}} an estimation of the DPV. Therefore, the European standard EN 15341 has been studied, in order to find the most essential indicators for the four value drivers and for estimation of the DPV. Terminology containing drivers and killers are common in the field of asset management, but definitions are scarce. One section in this paper is therefore dedicated to review these terms.
