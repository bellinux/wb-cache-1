Data recorded from previous studies show rainfall decline since the sixties. The impact of this phenomenon varies from one micro-area to another and has an influence on farming activities.

Rainfall scenarios should be taken into account in <b>crops</b> <b>establishment</b> and its improvement. Constraints such as rainfall variation and unsuitable tools and techniques, give an opportunity to explore new paths and ways of handling agricultural problems and conducting research activities in south Sahelian Africa.

40|$|Rice {{receives}} {{a large amount}} of water during land preparation and the growing period, causing poor crop water productivity and lower net benefits. In wheat, excessive tillage operations delay its sowing, resulting in low yields and net returns. Dry seeding of rice and zero tillage in wheat can be expected to reduce water inputs and tillage costs compared with the conventional system of rice-wheat cultivation. This article considers practices that would sustain higher and more stable yields for the rice-wheat system of the region. Farmer's participatory trials were conducted in the North West India for 3 years to evaluate various tillage and <b>crop</b> <b>establishment</b> systems for their efficiency in labor and water, and economic profitability. Yields of rice in conventional puddled transplanting were higher as compared to, unpuddled transplanting, reduced-till transplanting, and direct-seeding systems.

Laser-aided land leveling had a significant effect on reducing irrigation water use in rice. Dry-direct seeding and zero-tillage rice-wheat system had a savings in labor and machine use.

The studied salinity and pH levels did not affect final germination of L. multiflorum, but in some cultivars they significantly enhanced T 50 and consequently reduced initial root growth.

40|$|<b>Crop</b> <b>establishment</b> is a {{major factor}} {{determining}} crop productivity in the field and is strongly controlled by soil temperature and soil moisture. Fast leaf expansion and dry matter accumulation during <b>crop</b> <b>establishment</b> are required for an adequate establishment. Leaf area expansion and accumulation of dry matter during the establishment of broad bean (Vicia faba L.) and sorghum (Sorghum vulgare L.) were studied at different soil temperatures and soil moisture contents in a Vertisol (Lisboa) and a Luvisol (Évora) from November 1993 to November 1996. Soil temperature was measured at 2 and 4 cm depth with thermocouples, air temperature was measured with a ventilated psychrometer and soil moisture was measured using the gravimetric method. Leaf area was estimated non-destructively. Above ground seedling dry matter was weighed after oven drying at 65 ºC. Data analysis was based on the thermal time concept. For each crop {{no significant differences were found}} on leaf area at establishment in both soils under favourable water conditions, but significant differences were found on seedling dry matter. In moist soils, leaf area of both species increased linearly with accumulated temperature and dry matter increased exponentially with accumulated temperature. Low soil water during establishment reduced leaf expansion and dry matter accumulation of both crops, mainly if it occurred before seedling emergence.

Eight treatments were imposed within each <b>crop</b> <b>establishment</b> option and received maize stover mulch applied at 0 % or 30 % cover before planting  maize (Zea mays) or cowpea (Vigna unguiculata) as test crops.

Results indicated that both weed biomass and diversity were influenced more by fertilization than method of <b>crop</b> <b>establishment.</b> On treatments under high fertilizer application rates, or previously planted to cowpea weed biomass ranged between 220 and 400 g·m− 2 under mulch and 370 – 510 g·m− 2 (no mulch).
