In the EB of these patients, hydrogen peroxide {{is present in the}} vapour phase together with water, thus one of the approaches of monitoring hydrogen peroxide in the EB is to condense it and then to perform the hydrogen peroxide measurement in the condensate. Earlier, a hydrogen peroxide sensor based on an Electrolyte Metal Oxide Semiconductor Field-Effect Transistor, EMOSFET, has been investigated. The sensor shows the possibility to measure hydrogen peroxide at a concentration of micro-molar level. Due to its miniaturizability, the sensor is able to detect hydrogen peroxide in a small solution volume, especially suitable for monitoring of hydrogen peroxide in the EB.

40|$|The Galactic halo {{contains}} in many directions {{clouds of}} neutral hydrogen with high radial velocities 1. These high-velocity clouds mostly have motions towards the Galactic plane {{but do not}} follow the rotational movement of the disc. Since distance information for high-velocity clouds is sparse 2, 3 and the kinematics cannot be fixed from just the radial velocites, a closed theory {{about the origin of}} high-velocity clouds is not available today.

40|$|Abstract: During {{temperature}} cycles, metallic alloys {{for high}} temperature applications are usually oxidized with forma-tion of an external protective oxide scale, but they loose {{it during the}} cooling. This problem of oxide spallation can be studied by specific tests of cyclic oxidation but first indications can be provided by analyzing the cooling parts of thermo-gravimetry curves. This possibility was studied in this work for simple {Co or Fe} – 30 wt. % Cr alloys containing be-tween 0 and 0. 8 wt. % of carbon, and for two of these alloys after addition of about 5 wt. % of tantalum. These alloys, elaborated by foundry process, were exposed to oxidation at 1000, 1100 or 1200 °C for 50 hours, with recording of their mass gain during heating, isothermal dwell and cooling. The analysis of the <b>cooling</b> <b>part</b> of the thermogravimetry files al-lowed specifying several data characterizing the spallation of the external oxide, such as the temperature at which the phenomenon begins and the rate with which the mass decreases because {{of the loss of}} oxide. Metallographic data about oxidation and spallation were obtained by examination of cross-sections of the oxidized samples. Oxide spallation, char-acterized by its beginning’s temperature and its corresponding mass loss rate, was obviously more severe for the cobalt al-loys than for the iron ones, for the carbon-free alloys than for carbides-containing ones and for tantalum-containing alloys than for the tantalum-free ones.

40|$|Formation and {{structure}} of glycinin gels were studied in relation to protein conformation for two pH values and three ionic strengths. While at I= 0. 03 the gels {{were found to be}} fine stranded, gel coarseness increased when the ionic strength was higher. At I= 0. 03 finer gel network structures were formed at pH 3. 8 than at pH 7. 6, whereas for I= 0. 2 and 0. 5 the reverse was found. The observed differences in gel stiffness (rheological dynamical measurements) did not correspond to coarseness of the gels. It was found that the nature of the primary network particles was different at pH 7. 6 compared to pH 3. 8, since at pH 7. 6 only 51 – 69 % of total protein was incorporated in the gel network (predominantly basic polypeptides), while at pH 3. 8 all protein was present in the network. The higher water holding capacities observed at pH 7. 6 compared to pH 3. 8 support the idea that at pH 7. 6 the non-network protein resides in the pores. At all conditions studied denaturation coincides with the induction of ß-sheet at a secondary level (IR measurements), and with gel formation (except for I= 0. 03). The largest increase in gel stiffness did not take place directly after denaturation but during the <b>cooling</b> <b>part</b> of the temperature cycle used. This increase in gel stiffness could not be related to changes in secondary structure...|$|E

40|$|Detailed {{studies to}} {{characterize}} the microstructural development and mechanical properties of eutectic Sn-Ag solder joints were carried out on samples reflow soldered on copper under various processing conditions. Some samples were reflow soldered at 30 ∘C above the melting point and then solidified at different cooling rates. Analysis of these samples showed that increasing the cooling rate increased the volume fraction of primary Sn-dendrites, decreased the amount of η(Cu 6 Sn 5) intermetallics in the bulk solder, and resulted in finer microstructures with higher hardnesses. Subsequent isothermal annealing {{of some of these}} reflow soldered joints at 125 ∘C resulted in an initially fairly rapid decrease in hardness to a given level for each cooling rate studied. However, the cooling rate had little or no effect on the shear strength of the solder joints. Studies of the effect of Cu substrate dissolution on the microstructure of solder joints were carried out using samples reflow soldered isothermally at various temperatures and times. Analysis of some of these samples showed that the Cu concentration, the volume fraction of primary Sn-dendrites and η(Cu 6 Sn 5) intermetallics in the solder increased with reflow temperature and time as a result of Cu dissolution. The isothermal growth kinetics were analyzed using the Nernst-Brunner equation and a numerical method based on it was proposed to predict the amount of Cu dissolution into molten solder for non-isothermal reflow conditions. Isothermal growth of the intermetallic layer between the solder and Cu substrate was investigated, and it was found that layer thickening with time could be described by a power law. A numerical method to predict the layer thickness for non-isothermal reflow was developed which utilized the experimental power law thickening and Nernst-Brunner dissolution kinetic parameters. The method also took into account the additional increase in layer thickness caused by precipitation of dissolved Cu during the <b>cooling</b> <b>part</b> of the reflow process. The intermetallic layer growth resulting from non-isothermal solid state aging was also examined for samples reflow soldered at three different cooling rates and then cycled from ambient to 125 ∘C.

40|$|The Asian summer Monsoon {{circulation}} {{is driven}} by differential thermal heating, primarily associated with the localized latent heat release from enhanced precipitation over the India sub-continent. Although this heating is of limited zonal extent, it drives a time-averaged, upper level anticylone which is of global extent, extending from {{the western edge of}} the bulge of Africa, to the east of the Asian continent. The current theory (originally proposed by Gill (1980)) for explaining this zonally asymmetric component of the tropical circulation is unsatisfactory because it is based on the linear theory of damped equatorial waves while it is known that, at least for the upper level flow near the tropopause, the dynamics are strongly nonlinear. An alternative explanation, which is consistent with the nonlinear nature of the flows, involves the shedding of vortices from the directly forced monsoon anticyclone. The vortices, or eddies, are capable of drifting to the far field to establish a circulation which extends far beyond the local forcing. This thesis provides a dynamical explanation for the generation of eddies near the center of a divergent anticyclone, which, through their westward drift are responsible for the establishment of the global scale of the Asian summer Monsoon. The thesis consists of two parts, one numerical and one observational. The numerical study systematically investigates localized thermally driven circulations by using a shallow water model. This part of the thesis is theoretical in nature, and seeks to understand how non-axisymmetric elements such as a beta effect, or an external uniform flow, affects the dynamics of a divergent anticyclone for which, in the absence of non-axisymmetric elements, there exists an analytical axisymmetric solution. Control parameters which determine the dynamical regime of the flow are identified and explained. For the midlatitude beta plane experiment, the control parameter, pO, is the ratio between the free drift speed of an axisymmetric vortex on a beta plane, OL, and the strength of the forced localized divergent flow (ux) where L is the size of the axisymmetric circulation. For the uniform flow experiments, the control parameter is the strength of the uniform flow, Urn, and the divergent flow, ux. Each control parameter measures the relative importance of two competing effects, one which tries to displace the anticyclone westward (for the midlatitude beta plane experiments), or downstream (for the uniform flow experiments) and one tries to keep the forced vortex anchored. For each series of experiments, a critical value which separates the different long-time flow behavior is found. When the circulation is below the critical value, the circulation is persistent and localized. When the control parameter is above the critical parameter, a material filament with low potential vorticity is drawn from the divergent center, rolls up due to shear instability and is soon shed away by detaching itself from the main vortex. In the time-mean vorticity budget, the transient eddies have the effect of dissipating the time-mean flow. The dissipation effect by transient eddies can be grossly parameterized as a linear damping term in the linear version of the model. Another series of experiments, extending the midlatitude beta plane to the equatorial beta plane, with an equator within the reach of the forced perturbation, is conducted in which equatorial waves can be generated. The shedding behavior begins when the value of the control parameter is of order unity in the midlatitude beta plane experiments, and continues to exist for values of order 10 in the equatorial beta plane experiments. When the control parameter takes on values of order 100 and larger, the shedding behavior disappears and is replaced by linear wave solutions. In these experiments, another non-dimensional parameter (q), which measures the non-dimensional distance from the thermal forcing center to the equator, is found to affect the stability characteristics of the forced vortex. This series of experiments also allows equatorial waves to co-exist with the nonlinear vortex and to be excited by the broad thermal cooling, whose magnitude and location are determined by the internal dynamics of the nonlinear forced vortex. This linear part of the response is similar to the solution predicted by Gill (1980), but is of opposite sign, since it is the response to the resulting broad thermal <b>cooling</b> <b>part</b> of the thermal forcing, and not the small localized imposed thermal heating as Gill would have it. In the second part of the thesis, the theory is confirmed by discovering eddy shedding from the analysis of observational data. The potential vorticity on the isentropic surfaces are analyzed from 17 isobaric level NCEP-reanalysis data over the region of the Asian summer Monsoon. Two episodes of eddy shedding are found in July of 1990. The shedding events in the potential vorticity field are observed at the levels of isentropic surfaces from 360 K to 380 K. The induced geopotential perturbation penetrates deeper to 400 mb. The technique of Contour Advection with Surgery, a technique that allows to discriminate between adiabatic and diabatic effects, is used to recapture the shedding events, and confirm that the eddy shedding is indeed due to the essentially inviscid process identified in the idealized shallow water model. by Chia-hui Juno Hsu.

40|$|The {{trend in}} the {{electronic}} and electrical equipment industry towards denser and more powerful product requires {{a higher level of}} performance from cooling devices. In this context, passive cooling techniques such as latent heat storage systems have attracted considerable attention in recent years. Phase change materials (PCMs) {{have turned out to be}} extremely advantageous in this regard as they absorb high amount of latent heat without much rise of temperature. But unfortunately, nearly all phase change materials (PCMs) with high latent heat storage capacity have unacceptably low thermal conductivity, which makes heating and cooling processes slow during melting and solidification of PCMs. Augmentation of heat transfer in a PCM is achieved by inserting a high thermal conductivity material, known as thermal conductivity enhancer (TCE), into the PCM. The conglomeration of PCM and TCE is known as a thermal storage unit (TSU). In this thesis, detailed and systematic analyses are presented on the thermal performance of TSUs subjected to two types of thermal loading- (a) constant power loading in which a constant power level is supplied to the chip (heater) for a limited duration of time, and (b) cyclic loading. Eicosane is used as the PCM, while aluminium pin or plate fins are used as TCEs. First, a 1 -D analytical model is developed to obtain a closed-form temperature distribution for a simple PCM domain (without TCE) heated uniformly from the bottom. The entire heating process is divided into three stages, viz. (a) sensible heating period before melting, during which heat is stored in the solid PCM in the form of specific heat, (b) melting period, during which a melt front progresses from the bottom to the top layer of the PCM and heat is stored in latent as well as in sensible forms, and (c) post melting period, during which energy is stored again in the form of sensible heat. For each stage, conduction energy equation is solved with a set of initial and boundary conditions. Subsequently, a resistance capacitance model of phase change process is developed for further analysis. For transient performance under constant thermal loading, experimental investigations are carried out for TSUs with different percentages of TCE. A numerical model is developed to interpret the experimental results. The thermal performance of a TSU is found to depend on a number of geometrical parameters and boundary conditions. Hence, a systematic approach is desirable for finding the best TSU design for which the chip can be operated for a longer period of time before it reaches a critical temperature (defined as the temperature above which the chip starts malfunctioning). As a first step of the approach, it is required to identify the parameters which can affect the transient process. It is found that the convective heat transfer coefficient, ‘h’ and the exposed area for heat transfer have little effect on the chip temperature during the constant power operation. A randomized search technique, Genetic Algorithm (GA), is coupled with the CFD code to find an optimum combination of geometrical parameters of TSUs based on the design criteria. First, the optimization is carried out without considering melt convection within the PCM. It is found that the optimum half-fin width remains fixed for a given heat flux and temperature difference. Assuming a quasi steady process, the results of optimization are then explained by constructing and analyzing a resistance network model. The resistance network model is then extended to include the effect of melt convection, and it is shown that the optimum pitch changes with the strength of convection. Accordingly, numerical analysis is carried out by considering the effect of melt convection, and a correlation for optimum pitch is developed. Having established the role of melt convection on the thermal performance of TSUs, rigorous computational and experimental studies are performed in order to develop correlations among different non-dimensional numbers, such as Nusselt number, Rayleigh number, Stefan number and Fourier number, based on a characteristic length scale for convection. The enclosures are classified into three types, depending on the aspect ratio of cavity, viz. shallow, rectangular and tall enclosures. For a shallow enclosure, the characteristic length is the height of cavity whereas for a tall enclosure, the characteristic length is the fin pitch. In case of rectangular enclosure, both pitch and height are the important characteristic lengths. For cyclic operation, it is required that the fraction of the PCM melting during the heating cycle should completely solidify back during the cooling period, in order that that TSU can be operated for an unlimited number of cycles. If solidification is not complete during the cooling period, the TSU temperature will tend to rise with every cycle, thus making it un-operational after some cycles. It is found that the solidification process during the cooling period depends strongly on the heat transfer coefficient and the cooling surface area. However, heat transfer coefficient does not play any significant role during the heating period; hence a TSU optimized for transient operation may not be ideal for cyclic loading. Accordingly, studies are carried out to find the parameters which could influence the behaviour of PCM under cyclic loading. A number of parameters are identified in the process, viz. cycle period and heat transfer coefficient. It is found that the required heat transfer coefficient for infinite cyclic operation is very high and unrealistic with air cooling from the surface of the TSU. Otherwise, the required cooling period for complete re-solidification will be very high, which may not be suitable for most applications. In an effort to bring down the cooling period to a duration that is comparable to the heating period, a new design is proposed where both ‘h’ and area exposed to heat transfer can be controlled. In this new design, the gaps between the fins in a plate-fin TSU are alternately filled with PCM, such that only one side of a fin is in contact with PCM and the other side is exposed to the coolant (air). In this arrangement, the same heat flow path through the fin which is used for heating the PCM (during the heating stage) can also be used for cooling and solidifying the PCM during the <b>cooling</b> <b>part</b> of the cycle. Natural or forced air cooling through the passages can be introduced to provide a wide range of heat transfer coefficient which can satisfy the cooling requirements. With this arrangement, the enhanced area provided for cooling keeps the ‘h’ requirement within a realistic limit. This cooling method developed is categorized as a combination of active and passive cooling techniques. Analytical and numerical investigations are carried out to evaluate the thermal performance of this modified PCM-based heat sink in comparison to the ones with conventional designs. It is found that, the performance of new PCM-based heat sink is superior to that of the conventional one. Experiments are performed on both the conventional and the new PCM-based heat sinks to validate the new findings...|$|E
