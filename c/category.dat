5|$|Although most {{tropical}} cyclones {{that become}} extratropical quickly dissipate or are absorbed by another weather system, {{they can still}} retain winds of hurricane or gale force. In 1954, Hurricane Hazel became extratropical over North Carolina as a strong <b>Category</b> 3 storm. The Columbus Day Storm of 1962, which evolved from the remains of Typhoon Freda, caused heavy damage in Oregon and Washington, with widespread damage equivalent to at least a <b>Category</b> 3. In 2005, Hurricane Wilma began to lose tropical characteristics while still sporting <b>Category</b> 3-force winds (and became fully extratropical as a <b>Category</b> 1 storm).|$|E

5|$|In 2012, the NHC {{expanded}} the windspeed range for <b>Category</b> 4 by 1mph in both directions, to 130–156mph, with corresponding {{changes in the}} other units (113–136 kn, 209–251km/h), instead of 131–155mph (114–135 kn, 210–249km/h). The NHC and the Central Pacific Hurricane Center assign tropical cyclone intensities in 5 knot increments, and then convert to mph and km/h with a similar rounding for other reports. So an intensity of 115 knots is rated <b>Category</b> 4, but the conversion to miles per hour (132.3mph) would round down to 130mph, making it {{appear to be a}} <b>Category</b> 3 storm. Likewise, an intensity of 135 knots (~155mph, and thus <b>Category</b> 4) is 250.02km/h, which according to the definition used before the change would be <b>Category</b> 5. To resolve these issues, the NHC had been obliged to incorrectly report storms with wind speeds of 115 kn as 135mph, and 135 kn as 245km/h. The change in definition allows storms of 115 kn to be correctly rounded down to 130mph, and storms of 135 kn to be correctly reported as 250km/h, and still qualify as <b>Category</b> 4. Since the NHC had previously rounded incorrectly to keep storms in <b>Category</b> 4 in each unit of measure, the change does not affect the classification of storms from previous years. The new scale became operational on May 15, 2012.|$|E
