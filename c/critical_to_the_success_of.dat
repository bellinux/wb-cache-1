25|$|The {{methods of}} the new Long Range Penetration force in 1944 {{differed}} from those of 1943.

In an imaginative move prompted by Colonel Philip Cochran's assurance that he could transport both troops and supplies by glider, Wingate arranged for the bulk of the force to enter Burma by air, greatly accelerating the force's ability to reach its target objectives. Advance units would land in gliders in preselected open fields in Burma, and prepare them for large-scale landings by transport aircraft.

25|$|The {{open circuit}} scuba set is usually stored and often transported as {{separate}} major components - harness, cylinder(s) and regulator(s), and usually buoyancy compensator, and assembled shortly before use. The scuba set is {{life support equipment}} and correct assembly and function is <b>critical</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>success</b> <b>of</b> the dive, {{and in some cases}} to the survival of the user. The equipment is robust and reliable, is easily tested for correct function, and assembly is simple enough for the user after basic instruction and some practice. Some service providers will assemble scuba sets for their clients, particularly if it is rental equipment, but all certification agencies require the diver to be competent to assemble their own set. Scuba assembly generally entails mounting the cylinder(s) on the harness, connecting the regulator(s) to the cylinder valves, ensuring an uncontaminated and pressure-tight seal, and connecting the low pressure hose to the buoyancy compensator inflation valve. These operations usually require no tools, or at most a wrench, used to bolt twin cylinders to a backplate. Validating the function of the regulator and inflation valve is usually considered part of scuba assembly, but may also be considered part of pre-dive checks, {{and if there is a}} significant interval between assembly and use, is commonly done twice.|$|E

Excessive magnesium concentrations also stabilize double stranded DNA and prevent complete denaturation of the DNA during PCR reducing the product yield. Inadequate thawing of MgCl2 may result in the formation of concentration gradients within the magnesium chloride solution supplied with the DNA polymerase and also contributes to many failed experiments [...]|$|E

2500|$|Following the July 1999 {{murder of}} Army Pfc. Barry Winchell, {{apparently}} motivated by anti-gay bias, President Clinton issued {{an executive order}} modifying the Uniform Code of Military Justice to permit evidence of a hate crime to be admitted during the sentencing phase of a trial. In December, Secretary of Defense William Cohen ordered a review of DADT {{to determine if the}} policy's anti-gay harassment component was being observed. When that review found anti-gay sentiments were widely expressed and tolerated in the military, the DOD adopted a new anti-harassment policy in July 2000, though its effectiveness was disputed. On December 7, 1999, Hillary Clinton told an audience of gay supporters that [...] "Gays and lesbians already serve with distinction in our nation's armed forces and should not face discrimination. Fitness to serve should be based on an individual's conduct, not their sexual orientation." [...] Later that month, retired Gen. Carl E. Mundy defended the implementation of DADT against what he called the [...] "politicization" [...] of the issue by both Clintons. He cited discharge statistics for the Marines for the past 5 years that showed 75% were based on [...] "voluntary admission of homosexuality" [...] and 49% occurred during the first 6 months of service, when new recruits were most likely to reevaluate their decision to enlist. He also argued against any change in the policy, writing in the New York Times: [...] "Conduct that is widely rejected by a majority of Americans can undermine the trust that is essential to creating and maintaining the sense of unity that is <b>critical</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>success</b> <b>of</b> a military organization operating under the very different and difficult demands of combat." [...] The conviction of Winchell's murderer, according to the New York Times, [...] "galvanized opposition" [...] to DADT, an issue that had [...] "largely vanished from public debate". Opponents of the policy focused on punishing harassment in the military rather than the policy itself, which Sen.
