40|$|Includes bibliographical references. Keeping {{generators}} {{available on-line}} {{is a major}} factor in achieving maximum productivity in power generation. During operation, generator components are continuously exposed to thermal, electrical, mechanical and environmental stresses. The complex interactions of these stresses degrade the components resulting in a reduction of useful life. An integral part of satisfactory operation of high voltage (HV) electrical rotating plant relies upon the integrity of the electrical HV insulation of both the rotor and stator. The combined effect of the above mentioned stresses results in ageing of the insulation, which if not detected, results in premature failure in service. Deterioration of the stator <b>bar</b> <b>insulation</b> is a leading factor for determining the serviceability of hydro generators. Unexpected and expected stator bar failure can result in forced outages and costly emergency repairs. This research will deal with the deterioration of stator <b>bar</b> <b>insulation</b> in air-cooled hydro generators only...|$|R

There remain unclear issues {{in the formation of}} the potential and temperature distributions along the stress grading system of coils. In this paper, the potential distributions on the stress grading system of the model <b>coil</b> <b>bar</b> are measured under the application of 1 kHz square wave voltages of 10 kV in peak to peak value with/without 5 kV DC biased voltage. It turns out that DC bias voltage has little effect on potential distribution on a coil surface...|$|R

40|$|Direct Flame Impingement {{involves}} the use of an array of very high-velocity flame jets impinging on a work piece to rapidly heat the work piece. The predominant mode of heat transfer is convection. Because of the locally high rate of heat transfer at the surface of the work piece, the refractory walls and exhaust gases of a DFI furnace are significantly cooler than in conventional radiant heating furnaces, resulting in high thermal efficiency and low NOx emissions. A DFI furnace is composed of a successive arrangement of heating modules through or by which the work piece is conveyed, and can be configured for square, round, flat, and curved metal shapes (e. g., billets, tubes, flat <b>bars,</b> and <b>coiled</b> <b>bars)</b> in single- or multi-stranded applications...|$|R
40|$|The shape {{analysis}} of the Phase Resolved Partial Discharge (PRPD) patterns is proposed to assess {{the conditions of the}} insulation systems of ac rotating machines. By using this methods, it is possible to get consistent and comparable results even if tests are performed using different PD instruments or couplers. To be effective, this method requires a clear definition of the PRPD patters relevant to the different defect typologies that can affect the insulation system taking also into account the different insulation technologies. Due to the empiric approach, rules that allow to manage the uncertainty in the association patterns/defects, are also proposed. Some experimental results obtained testing off-line <b>coils,</b> <b>bars</b> and complete machines provided by different insulation systems, are discussed to show the validity of the method...|$|R

To {{solve the problem of}} the bars's rotation, parallel roller collocation scheme of hot rolled deformed bars with high speed and no scratches is presented. Based on the theory of elastoplasticity large deformation, elastic recovery torque variety during the setting out of <b>coiled</b> <b>bars</b> is analyzed in accordance with the triple-roller equal curvature rotation blocking straightening system. The mechanical model of bars in triple-roller is established and rotation blocking mechanism of the triple-roller equal curvature rotation blocking straightening system is researched. The results indicate that the system has the effect of consistent original curvature and rotation blocking toguarantee straightening precision and supply the demand of operation...|$|R
5000|$|In 1946 {{steel plate}} rolling ended. In 1953 the 11 in {{continuous}} bar mill was completed, {{which was to}} roll both straight and <b>coiled</b> <b>bar.</b> In 1963 the new site covered some 370 acre and the Roundwood site, beside the Midland Main Line north of the main works, and covering another 220 acre was starting production. The plant then included two mechanically-charged blast furnaces feeding 10 open hearth steel making furnaces which, in turn, fed two primary mills for rolling blooms and billets and six finishing mills rolling {{a wide range of}} blooms, billets, slabs, sections, bars and strip. The Roundwood site had an 11" [...] continuous bar mill and a narrow hot strip mill. Capacity at the time was about 425,000 tons of carbon, low alloy, and free-cutting steel and ingots.|$|R

40|$|The paper {{exhibits}} {{the examination}} of life quality evaluation of helical coil springs in the railway industry as it impacts {{the safety of the}} transportation of goods and people. The types of spring considered are: the external spring, internal spring and stabiliser spring. Statistical process control was utilised as the fundamental instrument in the investigation. Measurements were performed using a measuring tape, dynamic actuators and the vernier caliper. The purpose of this research was to examine the usability of old helical springs found in a railway environment. The goal of the experiment was to obtain factual statistical information to determine the life quality of the helical springs used in the railroad transportation environment. Six sigma advocacies were additionally used as a part of this paper.

40|$|In {{order to}} detect the {{degradation}} of high voltage machine insulation, partial discharge (PD) measure-ments are often used. While certain defects can be identified by PD measurements a correlation between PD activity and remaining insulation life or immanent insulation failure has {{so far not been}} convincingly demonstrated. As former investigations show, the main electrical degradation process of generator bars is electrical treeing. The electrical treeing and the PD generated thereby have therefore been investigated on generator <b>bar</b> <b>insulations.</b> The results show that treeing mainly causes delamination within the material. Dis-charges in such delaminations lead to a rise in apparent charge, maximum apparent charge and cumulated charge. The measured apparent charge could be calcu-lated from the size of deterioration structures as ob-served in micrographs. The cumulated charge shows a characteristic bend that occurs by a change from lower to higher PD. Higher PD values are usually caused by serious material degradation. The bend in the curve of cumulated charge depends on the material and takes place between 4 % and 41 % of the total time to breakdown. It may be used as a criterion for paying more attention to the survey of the material or for consideration of repair work...|$|R

40|$|A {{model for}} {{predicting}} temperature evolution for automatic controling systems in manufacturing processes requiring the <b>coiling</b> of <b>bars</b> in the transfer table is presented. Although {{the method is}} of a general nature, the presentation in this work refers to the manufacturing of steel plates in hot rolling mills. The predicting strategy {{is based on a}} mathematical model of the evolution of temperature in a <b>coiling</b> and uncoiling <b>bar</b> and is presented {{in the form of a}} parabolic partial differential equation for a shape changing domain. The mathematical model is solved numerically by a space discretization via geometrically adaptive finite elements which accomodate the change in shape of the domain, using a computationally novel treatment of the resulting thermal contact problem due to coiling. Time is discretized according to a Crank-Nicolson scheme. Since the actual physical process takes less time than the time required by the process controlling computer to solve the full mathematical model, a special predictive device was developed, in the form of a set of least squares polynomials, based on the off-line numerical solution of the mathematical model...|$|R

5000|$|The Remington {{company was}} founded in 1816. Eliphalet Remington II (1793 - 1861) {{believed}} he could build a better gun than he could buy. Farming communities in the region were famous for their diverse skills and self-sufficiency, and the winter seasons were used for crafts that provided goods for self-use and also for sale. Remington's father was a blacksmith, and wanted to expand his business into rifle barrel production. Local residents often built their own rifles to save on costs, but purchased the barrel. Remington's father sent him to a well-known barrel maker in a major city to purchase a barrel, with the mission of observing the barrel-making technique. At the time, the method was to heat and wrap long flat bars of iron around a metal rod of the caliber desired. By heating and hammering the <b>coiled</b> <b>bars</b> around the central rod, the barrel metal became fused into a solid cylinder, {{at which point the}} rod was pressed out. After the young man returned home, his family added a successful barrel making operation to his father's forge, in Ilion Gorge, New York. [...] Remington began designing and building a flintlock rifle for himself. At age 23 (in the fall of 1816), he entered a shooting match; though he only finished second, his well-made gun impressed other shooters. Before Remington left the field that day, he had received so many orders from other competitors that he was now officially in the gunsmithing business. By 1828, the operation moved to nearby Ilion, New York, at the same site which is used by the modern Remington firearms plant.|$|R

50|$|Contrary to {{what was}} {{thought at the time}} that these domains flip {{continuously}} one by one, Barkhausen found that clusters of domains flipped in small discrete steps. By coiling a secondary <b>coil</b> around the <b>bar</b> connected to a speaker or detector, when a cluster of domains change alignment a change in flux occurs, this disrupts the current in the secondary coil and hence causes a signal output. When played out loud, this is referred to as Barkhausen noise, the magnetisation of the magnet increases in discrete steps {{as a function of the}} flux density.|$|R

50|$|Research {{into the}} study of small {{perturbations}} within a large domains {{began in the late}} 1910s when Heinrich Barkhausen investigated how the domains, or dipoles, within a ferromagnetic material changed under the influence of an external electric field.

By applying an external electric field by <b>coiling</b> an iron <b>bar</b> with wire and passing a current through a force perpendicular to the coil is produced (Fleming’s right hand rule for a coil), this causes the dipoles within the magnet to align to the external field.|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} some options of how {{electromagnetic}} forming (EMF) can assist {{to expand the}} capabilities of conventional forming and joining technologies are discussed. Three different areas where EMF {{has the potential for}} a significant expansion of capabilities of traditional technologies are reviewed: 1) restrike operation to fill sharp corners of automotive panels; 2) low energy method of springback calibration; 3) joining of closed frames with an openable coil. Each of these applications was demonstrated in laboratory conditions and the description of the tooling is provided in the paper. Suggested design of a flat concentrator collecting induced electric currents from a flat coil was demonstrated for a corner filling operation and a springback calibration. An efficient technique of fabricating the flat coil from a flat plate by using water jetting technology enables a cost effective coil design, which can be reinforced by a system of non-conductive <b>bars.</b> The <b>insulation</b> of the coil is produced from the flat sheet of insulation material. Suggested design allows the coil to be repaired if a shortcut or fracture of insulation strips happens.
