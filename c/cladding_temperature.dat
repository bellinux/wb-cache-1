40|$|A dynamic Bayesian network (DBN) {{model is}} used in {{conjunction}} with the alternating conditional expectation (ACE) regression method to analyze the risk associated with the loss of feedwater accident coupled with a subsequent initiation of the feed and bleed operation in the Zion- 1 nuclear power plant. The use of the DBN allows the joint probability distribution to be factorized, enabling the analysis to be done on many simpler network structures rather than on one complicated structure. The construction of the DBN model assumes conditional independence relations among certain key reactor parameters. The choice of parameter to model is based on considerations of the macroscopic balance statements governing the behavior of the reactor under a quasi-static assumption. The DBN is used to relate the peak <b>clad</b> <b>temperature</b> to a set of independent variables that are known to be important in determining the success of the feed and bleed operation. A simple linear relationship is then used to relate the <b>clad</b> <b>temperature</b> to the core damage probability. 	To obtain a quantitative relationship among different nodes in the DBN, surrogates of the RELAP 5 reactor transient analysis code are used. These surrogates are generated by applying the ACE algorithm to output data obtained from about 50 RELAP 5 cases covering a wide range of the selected independent variables. These surrogates allow important safety parameters such as the fuel <b>clad</b> <b>temperature</b> to be expressed as a function of key reactor parameters such as the coolant temperature and pressure together with important independent variables such as the scram delay time. The time-dependent core damage probability is calculated by sampling the independent variables from their probability distributions and propagate the information up through the Bayesian network to give the <b>clad</b> <b>temperature.</b> With the knowledge of the <b>clad</b> <b>temperature</b> and the assumption that the core damage probability has a one-to-one relationship to it, we have calculated the core damage probably as a function of transient time.

40|$|An {{investigation}} of SPERT I reactor reactivity feedback mechanisms {{has been made}} using the modular code AUS. Feedback terms so obtained {{have been used in}} the transient analysis code ZAPP to calculate transient behaviour for step and ramp reactivity additions. A simple model of coolant boiling has been used to analyse transients for which <b>cladding</b> <b>temperatures</b> exceed the saturation temperature of water. The generally good agreement obtained with experimental data supports the case that core only temperature coefficients are much larger than those obtained by heating core and reflector...|$|R
40|$|An updated TRAC 80 % large-break loss-of-coolant {{accident}} (LBLOCA) {{has been}} {{calculated for the}} Westinghouse AP 600 advanced reactor design, The updated calculation incorporates major code error corrections, model corrections, and plant design changes. The 80 % break size was calculated by Westinghouse {{to be the most}} severe large-break size for the AP 600 design. The LBLOCA transient was calculated to 144 s. Peak <b>cladding</b> <b>temperatures</b> (PCTS) were well below the Appendix K limit of 1, 478 K (2, 200 F), but very near the <b>cladding</b> oxidation <b>temperature</b> of 1, 200 K (1, 700 F). Transient event times and PCT for the TRAC calculation were in reasonable agreement with those calculated by Westinghouse using their {und W}COBRA/TRAC code. However, there were significant differences in the detailed phenomena calculated by the two codes, particularly during the blowdown phase. The reasons for these differences are still being investigated. Additional break sizes and break locations need to be analyzed to confirm the most severe break postulated by Westinghouse...|$|R
