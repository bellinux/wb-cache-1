40|$|This {{paper will}} show the {{similarities}} in the overall perspective of the Polysem-ployee’s psychological contract with both their employing organisation and their client organisations, although in favour of the employing organisation. Over 100 IT employees active in client engagements from project implementations to support <b>and</b> <b>outsourcing</b> of varying periods of time were surveyed with a cross-sectional questionnaire to identify differences in psychological contracts and attitudes towards their client and employing organisations. We {{found that there were}} very few differences in the way the psychological contract is perceived {{from the perspective of the}} employee in the triangular relationship although marginally in favour of the employing organisation. Additionally we found that there was a significant relationship between the tenure with the employing organisation and tenure with the client organisation and that there were further indications that this was linked to an issue of life stage. We also conclude that generally the psychological contract of Polysem-ployee’s in the IT industry can be considered flexible or unstable, broad in scope, tangible and more relational in nature. The findings have implications for HR management practices of IT <b>consultancies</b> <b>and</b> <b>outsourcing</b> organisations operating in environments with unacceptably high rates of turnover.

40|$|While {{concentration}} {{measures are}} a good indicator of market structure, the link with competitiveness {{is more complex than}} often assumed. In particular, the modern theory of industrial organisation makes no clear statement regarding the impact of concentration on competition - the focus of this paper is concentration and no inferences are made about competitive aspects of the market. The extent and nature of concentration within the UK listed company audit market as at April 2002 and, pro forma, after the collapse of Andersens is documented and analysed in detail (by firm, market segment and industry sector). The largest four firms held 90 % of the market (based on audit fees) in 2002, rising to 96 % with the demise of Andersens. A single firm, PricewaterhouseCoopers, held 70 % or more of the share of six out of 38 industry sectors, with a share of 50 % up to 70 % in a further seven sectors. The provision of non-audit services (NAS) by incumbent auditors is also considered. As at April 2002 the average ratio of non-audit fees (paid to auditor) to audit fees was 208 %, and exceeded 300 % in seven sectors. It is likely, however, that recent disposals by firms of their management <b>consultancy</b> <b>and</b> <b>outsource</b> firms, combined with the impact of the Smith Report on audit committees will serve to reduce these ratios. Another finding is that audit firms with expertise in a particular sector appeared to earn significantly higher non-audit fees from their audit clients in that sector. The paper thus provides a solid empirical basis for debate. The subsequent discussion considers the implications for companies and audit firms of the high level of concentration in the current regulatory climate, where no direct regulatory intervention is planned...|$|R
40|$|The {{outsourcing}} of HR {{activities is}} a management strategy {{that may be}} adopted {{in response to a}} number of pressures that an organization is faced with. It is one aspect of business process outsourcing that is increasingly deployed by firms in order to enhance their organizational competitiveness. HR outsourcing can be defined as ‘placing responsibility for various elements of the HR function with a third-party provider’ (Turnbull, 2002, p. 11). In spite of the perceived benefits of HR <b>outsourcing</b> <b>and</b> its growth predicted by <b>consultancy</b> firms <b>and</b> HR <b>outsourcing</b> market leaders, the growth of <b>outsourcing</b> remains cautious <b>and</b> the benefits of doing so prove limited. This paper provides an overview of reasons why firms outsource their HR activities, its growth trends, organizational change that may be triggered by the <b>outsourcing</b> decision, <b>and</b> the challenges that are presented to the HR function and professionals as a result. The paper argues that a number of conceptual ambiguities and operational pitfalls may dampen the effectiveness of HR outsourcing for user organizations...|$|R

40|$|Data {{journalism is}} a rather new format of {{reporting}} news stories online, which utilizes open data {{as the basis of}} stories and illustrates findings visually. The data journalism creation process and the way the information is being presented are very different to that of traditional print journalism. The objectives of this research are to identify current data journalism creation processes, forecast the future process outlook and to discuss journalists' role in the process. There has been very little academic research conducted in the field of data journalism previously. Therefore, the literature review within this thesis has a wide scope and is explorative in nature while the findings {{serve as the basis for}} creating a future model for data journalism creation processes. The viability of the created future model has been tested by interviewing three Finnish data journalism professionals. Suggested streamlined process model for the future of data journalism proposes that in the future the two most work-intensive data journalism creation phases, data manipulation and story visualization, will be outsourced to organizations specialized in these phases. This model is generally accepted as a viable future scenario by the professionals interviewed. However, there is some concern about communication between journalists and the institution to which the data journalism creation process is being outsourced to. This notion of the importance of communication prompted the creation of two more models that take communication more into consideration: (1) data journalism <b>consultancy</b> model <b>and</b> (2) <b>outsourced</b> chain model for data journalism. Together these two models suggest four approaches for producing data journalism in the future, these are: (a) an in-house data journalism team,(b) partner up with an organization specialized in creating data journalism <b>and</b> <b>outsource</b> the whole data journalism creation process except story creation to it, (c) outsource each phase to a separate phase provider and (d) a hybrid model of the first and last mentioned approach. The role that journalists will have in the data journalism creation process of the future will alter according to which model media organization decides to adopt...|$|R
