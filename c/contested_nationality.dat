[...] The Dispatch allowed consuls to keep on granting Portuguese transit visas, but established {{that in the case}} of [...] "Foreigners of indefinite or <b>contested</b> <b>nationality,</b> the Stateless, Russian Citizens, Holders of a Nansen passport, or Jews expelled from their countries and those alleging to embark from a Portuguese port without a consular visa for their country of destination, or air or sea tickets, or an Embarkation Guarantee from the respective companies, the consuls needed to ask permission in advance to the Foreign Ministry head office in Lisbon." [...] With Europe at war this meant that refugees fleeing from Nazism would have serious difficulties.|$|E

Until late 1942, immigration was very restricted. In cases in which refugees were suspected to desire not simply to pass through Portugal in transit to their destination, but rather intended {{to remain in the}} country, the consulates needed to get a previous authorization from Lisbon. This was frequently the case with foreigners of indefinite or <b>contested</b> <b>nationality,</b> stateless individuals, Russians, and Jews expelled from their countries of origin. Other refugees {{on their way to the}} Americas were allowed to use the country as an escape route. The list of famous people that used Portugal as an escape route in this way is quite extensive and includes names such as Menachem Mendel Schneerson, Peggy Guggenheim, Max Ernst, Marc Chagall, Arthur Koestler, Calouste Gulbenkian, Otto von Habsburg, etc. The novel The Night In Libson by Erich Maria Remarque is a fictionalized description of the experience of European political refugees seeking escape from Nazism via Portugal in this era and the plot focuses heavily on the difficulty many had of obtaining the documents and money they needed to leave.|$|E
