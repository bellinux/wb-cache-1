5|$|Among the {{perquisites}} of the Times appointment were a <b>company</b> <b>car</b> and a {{large and}} splendid office at the paper's building in Printing House Square, London. Levin accepted neither; he could not drive and he hated to be isolated. He commandeered a desk in the anteroom to the editor's office, a location that kept him closely {{in touch with the}} daily affairs of the paper. It also gave him ready access to the editor, William Rees Mogg, with whom he developed a good friendship. Levin's brief was to write two columns a week (later three) on any subject that he wished. His range was prodigious; he published nine volumes of his selected journalism of which the first, Taking Sides, covered subjects as diverse as the death watch beetle, Field Marshal Montgomery, Wagner, homophobia, censorship, Eldridge Cleaver, arachniphobia, theatrical nudity, and the North Thames Gas Board.|$|E
5|$|The UK {{government}} established several {{incentives for}} E85 flex-fuel vehicles. These include a fuel duty rebate on E85 fuel of 20 p per liter, until 2010; a £ 10 to 15 {{reduction in the}} vehicle excise duty (VED); and a 2% annual <b>company</b> <b>car</b> tax discount for flex-fuel cars. Despite {{the small number of}} E85 pump stations available, limited to the Morrisons supermarket chain stations, most automakers offer the same models in the UK that are available in the European market. In 2005 the Ford Focus Flexi-Fuel became the first flexible-fuel car sold in the UK, though E85 pumps were not opened until 2006. Volvo now offers its flexifuel models S80, S40, C30, V50 and V70. Other models available in the UK are the Ford C-Max Flexi-Fuel, and the Saab models 9-5 and 9-3 Flex-Fuel Biopower, and the new Saab Aero X BioPower E100 bioethanol.|$|E

30|$|Important {{questions}} arise regarding the safety implications of <b>company</b> <b>cars.</b> It {{is well known}} that traveling by passenger car is less safe than using modes of public transportation (see, for example, [20]). Therefore, the encouragement of passenger car usage engendered by providing <b>company</b> <b>cars</b> should be evaluated. Additionally, certain relevant questions need to be answered: Are the safety features installed in <b>company</b> <b>cars</b> different from those in privately sold cars? Do drivers of <b>company</b> <b>cars</b> exhibit different driving behavior from drivers of private cars with regard to energy use and, in particular, safety? These questions should be of concern, especially in a country like Israel, which has experienced a massive growth in the proportion of <b>company</b> <b>cars</b> in recent years.|$|R

40|$|Barriers {{exist for}} {{improvement}} of energy efficiency, of which the principal-agent problem is considered an important one. The principal-agent problem is a potential barrier for energy policies based on economic instruments, as the decision maker may be partially insulated from the price signal given by such policies. We estimate the size {{and the impact of}} the principal-agent problem for <b>cars</b> provided by <b>companies</b> as a benefit to employees in the Netherlands. Of all passenger cars in the Netherlands, 11 % is classified as <b>company</b> <b>cars,</b> which consume 21 % of the total energy consumption by passenger <b>cars.</b> As <b>company</b> <b>cars</b> are newer, operate more diesel engines, but are also larger, the fuel efficiency is slightly worse than that of private <b>cars.</b> <b>Company</b> <b>cars</b> seem to drive longer distances for commuting than the national average of private cars. Together, this might result in a net 1 - 7 % increase of all fuel use of passenger cars in the Netherlands. This indicates that there is potential to reduce energy consumption of <b>company</b> <b>cars</b> and a need for policies aimed at improving energy efficiency of <b>company</b> <b>cars.</b> Barrier Energy efficiency Transport...|$|R

25|$|By the {{beginning}} of the 1960s Japan's economy was gearing up; wages were rising and the idea of family motoring was taking off. Central Japan Heavy-Industries, now known as Shin Mitsubishi Heavy-Industries, had already re-established an automotive department in its headquarters in 1953. Now it was ready to introduce the Mitsubishi 500, a mass market sedan, to meet the new demand from consumers. It followed this in 1962 with the Minica kei car and the Colt 1000, the first of its Colt line of family cars, in 1963. In 1964, Mitsubishi introduced its largest passenger sedan, the Mitsubishi Debonair as a luxury car primarily for the Japanese market, and was used by senior Mitsubishi executives as a <b>company</b> <b>car.</b>|$|E

Then, he worked for two years under Arthur Eve, the Deputy Speaker of the New York State Assembly.
