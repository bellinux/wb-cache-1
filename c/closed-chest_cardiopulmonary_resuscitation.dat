40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{objective}} of vasopressor therapy during <b>closed-chest</b> <b>cardiopulmonary</b> <b>resuscitation</b> (CPR) is to augment coronary perfusion pressure so that spontaneous circulation can be reestablished. Epinephrine, an endogenous catecholamine {{with both a}} 1 pha- and beta-adrenergic activity, is the vasopressor of choice for use during CPR. Epinephrine's potent alpha,- and alpha. -adrenergic effects improve cerebral and myocardial blood flow by preventing arterial collapse and by increasing peripheral vasoconstriction. The optimal dose of epinephrine in humans during closed-chest CPR is unknown. Studies suggest that the dose of epinephrine currently recommended during CPR may be five to ten times lower than the dose required to produce the beneficial pharmacologic effects observed in animal models of closed-chest CPR. Data from patients with prehospital cardiac arrest indicate that a 5 -mg dose of epinephrine {{may be required to}} increase diastolic blood pressure above 30 mm Hg. Until additional data ar...|$|E

ABSTRACT To determine whether expansion of blood volume improves vital organ perfusion pressures and blood flow during <b>closed-chest</b> <b>cardiopulmonary</b> <b>resuscitation</b> in dogs, we recorded intracranial and high-fidelity ascending aortic and right atrial pressures and measured total and regional blood flow with radioactive microspheres during cardiopulmonary resuscitation {{before and after}} rapid infusion of 1 liter of saline or dextran in 12 animals. Volume loading increased total forward blood flow from 327. 1 50. 9 to 692. 7 + 105. 9 ml/min (p <. 01). However, {{blood flow to the}} cerebral hemispheres, cerebellum, brainstem, and ventricular myocardium all decreased significantly. For example, blood flow to the left cerebral hemisphere fell from 16. 5 + 2. 4 to 5. 5 + 1. 7 ml/min/ 100 g (p <. 001), while left ventricular myocardial blood flow fell from 12. 0 + 3. 1 to 4. 1 + 0. 8 ml/min/ 100 g (p <. 05). These changes in critical regional flow were accompanied by disproportionate increases in right atrial and intracranial pressures (relative to aortic pressure), which reduced the average pressure differences generated across the coronary and cerebral circulations from 1 l. 0 + 2. 5 to 3. 7 + 1. 3 mm Hg (p <. 01) and from 16. 1 ± 2. 3 to 10. 5 + 1. 5 mm Hg (p <. 01), respectively. The overall rise in forward flow was associated with a marked increase in extracranial, brachiocephalic blood flow. These findings suggest that large increments in blood volume can reduce vital organ perfusion during cardiopulmonary resuscitation despite an increase in total forward blood flow...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Despite {{advances}} in medical care, survival to discharge and full neurologic recovery after cardiac arrest remains less than 20 % after <b>cardiopulmonary</b> <b>resuscitation.</b> An alternate approach to traditional <b>cardiopulmonary</b> <b>resuscitation</b> is extracorporeal <b>cardiopulmonary</b> <b>resuscitation,</b> which places patients on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation during <b>cardiopulmonary</b> <b>resuscitation</b> and provides immediate cardiopulmonary support when traditional resuscitation has been unsuccessful. We report {{the results from}} extracorporeal <b>cardiopulmonary</b> <b>resuscitation</b> at the Thomas Jefferson University. METHODS: Between 2010 and June 2014, 107 adult extracorporeal membrane oxygenation procedures were performed at the Thomas Jefferson University. Patient demographics, survival to discharge, and neurologic recovery of patients who underwent extracorporeal <b>cardiopulmonary</b> <b>resuscitation</b> were retrospectively analyzed with institutional review board approval. RESULTS: A total of 23 patients (15 male and 8 female; mean age, 46 ± 12 years) underwent extracorporeal <b>cardiopulmonary</b> <b>resuscitation.</b> All patients who met criteria were placed on 24 -hour hypothermia protocol (target temperature 33 °C) with initiation of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. The mean duration of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support was 6. 2 ± 5. 5 days. Nine patients died while on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation from the following causes: anoxic brain injury (4), stroke (4), and bowel necrosis (1). Two patients with anoxic brain injury on extracorporeal <b>cardiopulmonary</b> <b>resuscitation</b> donated multiple organs for transplant. The survival to discharge was 30 % (7 / 23 patients) with approximately 100 % full neurologic recovery. CONCLUSIONS: The extracorporeal <b>cardiopulmonary</b> <b>resuscitation</b> procedure provided reasonable patient recovery. Extracorporeal <b>cardiopulmonary</b> <b>resuscitation</b> also allowed for neurologic recovery and made multiorgan procurement possible. On {{the basis of the}} survival, extracorporeal <b>cardiopulmonary</b> <b>resuscitation</b> should be considered when determining the optimal treatment path for patients who need <b>cardiopulmonary</b> <b>resuscitation.</b> The proper use of extracorporeal <b>cardiopulmonary</b> <b>resuscitation</b> improved the hospital outcomes for patients with in-hospital cardiac arrest...|$|R

Therefore, the present study was conducted with the aim of “ 24 Hour Survival Rate and it’s determinants in patients with Successful <b>Cardiopulmonary</b> <b>Resuscitation</b> in Ghaem Hospital of Mashhad”. Materials and Methods In this descriptive and analytical study, 80 cases of CPR were selected by convenience sampling in Ghaem hospital of Mashhad. After confirming of cardiac arrest by a resident physician in the wards and declaration of code 99, were performed <b>cardiopulmonary</b> <b>resuscitation</b> by CPR team. Rate of 24 hour survival was determined in patients that had return of spontaneous circulation by form the researcher’s observations. Data were collected and analyzed using of descriptive statistics (frequency, mean, standard deviation) and inferential statistics (Fishers, Chi-square, logistic regression) and SPSS software version of 16. Results Mean and standard deviation of age patients was 67. 3 ± 1. 5 year. In 45 patients (56. 2 %), was achieved return of spontaneous circulation. The rate of 24 hour survival was in 30 patients that <b>cardiopulmonary</b> <b>resuscitation</b> on them was successful.

40|$|Background. There are two {{competing}} {{theories of the}} mechanism of blood flow during <b>cardiopulmonary</b> <b>resuscitation.</b> The "cardiac pump " theory postulates that blood flows because the heart is squeezed between the sternum and the spine. The "thoracic pump " theory postulates that blood flows from the thorax because intrathoracic pressure exceeds extrathoracic vascular pressure and that flow is restricted to the venous-to-arterial direction because of venous valves that prevent retrograde flow at the thoracic inlet. To determine which mechanism is operative during actual <b>cardiopulmonary</b> <b>resuscitation,</b> 20 patients were imaged with transesophageal echocardiography during resuscitation. Methods and Results. Transesophageal two-dimensional and pulse Doppler echocardiography was begun within 7 minutes of initiation of <b>cardiopulmonary</b> <b>resuscitation.</b> In the 18 patients who could be analyzed, the mitral valve opened during the release phase (diastole) and closed during the compression phase (systole) of <b>cardiopulmonary</b> <b>resuscitation.</b> Mitral velocity-time integral measured 8 ± 3 cm during diastole. There was compression of right and left ventricular cavities with significant reduction in measured left ventricular volume during <b>cardiopulmonary</b> <b>resuscitation.</b> In five patients, mitral regurgi-tation was present. Conclusions. Transesophageal echocardiography performed during actual cardiopulmonary resuscita-tion showing mitral valve opening during cardiac release, reduction of ventricular cavity size with compression, and atrioventricular regurgitation support the cardiac pump theory of <b>cardiopulmonary</b> <b>resuscitation.</b> This study demonstrates the feasibility and usefulness of transesophageal echocardiography during <b>cardiopulmonary</b> <b>resuscitation.</b> (Circulation 1993; 88 : 534 - 542...|$|R

30|$|According to International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation, use of ECMO {{should be}} {{considered}} in children with cardiac arrest refractory to conventional <b>cardiopulmonary</b> <b>resuscitation,</b> if cardiac arrest occurred in a highly monitored setting and the necessary support equipment and expertise are available to implement the technique rapidly [126]. In a series of 682 patients with a median age of 3  months (ELSO registry) treated with extracorporeal <b>cardiopulmonary</b> <b>resuscitation</b> [127], the survival rate after discharge was 38  %. This study suggests that a pH <  6.9 prior to ECMO is significantly associated with death within 72  h or a poor neurological prognosis. The meta-analysis performed by Tajik and Cardarelli [128] of 37 studies (288 patients) including case reports and observational pediatric studies on patients with cardiac arrest treated with extracorporeal <b>cardiopulmonary</b> <b>resuscitation,</b> showed that survival rate was very variable: It ranged from 0 to 100  % in small centers that had low numbers of patients and from 6 to 79  % for the larger cohorts. Matos et al. [116] demonstrated that morbidity and mortality increase if <b>cardiopulmonary</b> <b>resuscitation</b> lasts > 15  min and that conventional resuscitation reaches its limits with a likelihood of survival of 41  % for <b>cardiopulmonary</b> <b>resuscitation</b> lasting 1 – 15  min, but only 12  % if <b>cardiopulmonary</b> <b>resuscitation</b> lasts > 35  min. The neurological prognosis of survivors is good and reaches 70  % when <b>cardiopulmonary</b> <b>resuscitation</b> lasts < 15  min and 60  % if CPR lasts < 35  min. The survival of children undergoing cardiac surgery is 38.5  % if <b>cardiopulmonary</b> <b>resuscitation</b> lasts > 35  min and ECMO is used, but drops to 16.7  % if ECMO is not used (p <  0.0001). Turek et al. [120] reported that if ECMO was implemented within 40  min using a previously prepared circuit, neurological complications were decreased by 52  % (p <  0.04) compared with the conventional method (> 40  min). However, no decrease in the mortality rate was observed. In a series of 42 children treated with extracorporeal <b>cardiopulmonary</b> <b>resuscitation,</b> Delmo-Walter et al. [112] showed a difference of mortality depending on the duration of <b>cardiopulmonary</b> <b>resuscitation</b> prior to implementation of ECMO: 30  ±  1.3  min vs. 46  ±  4.2  min (p =  0.003).

MethodsWe reviewed all patients who required extracorporeal <b>cardiopulmonary</b> <b>resuscitation</b> from 2000 to 2005. Multivariable regression analysis determined {{factors associated with}} favorable outcome and time-related survival. ResultsEighty children, median age 150 days (range: 1 day– 17. 6 years), required venoarterial extracorporeal <b>cardiopulmonary</b> <b>resuscitation.</b> There were several categories of disease among the patients: postcardiotomy (n = 39), unoperated congenital heart disease (n = 17), cardiomyopathy (n = 12), respiratory failure (n = 9), or myocarditis (n = 3). Cannulation sites were neck (n = 45) or chest (n = 36). Median duration of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation was 4 days (range: 1 – 22). Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation was successfully discontinued in 42 (54 %) patients: wean (n = 35), heart transplantation (n = 7). Survival till hospital discharge was 27 (34 %) patients. Most common {{cause of death was}} ischemic brain injury (n = 17). Twenty-four (30 %) patients had a favorable outcome. Median duration of <b>cardiopulmonary</b> <b>resuscitation</b> for patients with favorable versus unfavorable outcome was 46 minutes (range: 14 – 95; interquartile range: 29 – 55) versus 41 minutes (range: 19 – 110; interquartile range: 30 – 55), P =. 916.

40|$|AbstractObjectives. The {{purpose of}} this study was to test the {{hypothesis}} that active compression-decompression would improve resuscitation success in human subjects after cardiac arrest. Background. Active compression-decompression <b>cardiopulmonary</b> <b>resuscitation</b> is a new method that improves cardiopulmonary hemodynamic function in animal models and humans after cardiac arrest. Methods. We conducted a prospective randomized clinical trial in patients with in-hospital cardiac arrest. Patients were assigned to receive standard manual or active compression-decompression <b>cardiopulmonary</b> <b>resuscitation.</b> The primary study end points were spontaneous return of circulation, 24 -h survival and survival to hospital discharge. Results. Fifty-three consecutive patients after cardiac arrest undergoing 64 resuscitation attempts were studied (30 women, 23 men; mean [± SD] age 71 ± 13 years, range 38 to 96). Spontaneous return of circulation was observed in 24 (47 %) of 53 patients and was increased in patients receiving active compression-decompression compared with those receiving standard manual <b>cardiopulmonary</b> <b>resuscitation</b> (15 [60 %] of 25 vs. 9 [32 %] of 28, respectively, p = 0. 042); 24 -h survival was increased (12 [48 %] of 25 vs. 6 [21 %] of 28, respectively, p = 0. 041); and there was a trend toward improved survival to hospital discharge (6 [24 %]of 25 vs. 3 [11 %]of 28, respectively, p = 0. 198) when active compression-decompression was compared with standard manual <b>cardiopulmonary</b> <b>resuscitation.</b> Conclusions. Active compression-decompression <b>cardiopulmonary</b> <b>resuscitation</b> improves return of spontaneous circulation and 24 -h survival after in-hospital cardiac arrest. Active compression-decompression <b>cardiopulmonary</b> <b>resuscitation</b> appears to be a beneficial adjunct to standard manual <b>cardiopulmonary</b> <b>resuscitation...</b>|$|R

The aim {{of this research was}} to design a manikin that offers high anatomical and physiological fidelity and has a cardiac and respiratory system along with integrated flow sensors to monitor cardiac output and air displacement in response to <b>cardiopulmonary</b> <b>resuscitation.</b> This manikin was designed in accordance with anatomical dimensions using a polyoxymethylene rib cage connected to a vertebral column from an anatomical female model. The respiratory system was composed of silicon-coated memory foam mimicking lungs, a polyvinylchloride bronchus and a latex trachea. The cardiovascular system was composed of two sets of latex tubing representing the pulmonary and aortic arteries which were connected to latex balloons mimicking the ventricles and lumped abdominal volumes, respectively. These balloons were filled with Life/form simulation blood and placed inside polyether foam. The respiratory and cardiovascular systems were equipped with flow sensors to gather data in response to chest compressions. Three non-medical professionals performed chest compressions on this manikin yielding data corresponding to force–displacement while the flow sensors provided feedback. The force–displacement tests on this manikin show a desirable nonlinear behaviour mimicking chest compressions during <b>cardiopulmonary</b> <b>resuscitation</b> in humans. In addition, the flow sensors provide valuable data on the internal effects of <b>cardiopulmonary</b> <b>resuscitation.</b> In conclusion, scientifically designed and anatomically high-fidelity designs of <b>cardiopulmonary</b> <b>resuscitation</b> manikins that embed flow sensors can improve physiological fidelity and provide useful feedback data. 3 ̆cbr/ 3 ̆...|$|R
40|$|The {{theme of}} this work is acute as {{the most common cause}} of death in most Western European {{countries}} is a cardiac arrest. Mortality after an arrest outside hospital is around 65 - 95 % and 40 - 50 % after an cardiac arrest in hospital. The prognosis is uncertain, but it could be improved by early and effective <b>cardiopulmonary</b> <b>resuscitation.</b> As everyone can encounter a situation in which they should be able to use parts of <b>cardiopulmonary</b> <b>resuscitation,</b> it is therefore necessary to know its basic principles and to be able to help a person in life-threatening situations. Early and proper first aid is usually life-saving, and therefore laic and professional knowledge of resuscitation is crucial. The emphasis, which is based on the results of many studies, shifts to the fastest and most effective action on the site of the accident. The importance of <b>cardiopulmonary</b> <b>resuscitation</b> and nursing care for the patient during this phase led to the elaboration of the theoretical work Nursing Care of Patients after <b>Cardiopulmonary</b> <b>Resuscitation.</b> The first chapter of this thesis deals with the basic characteristics of <b>cardiopulmonary</b> <b>resuscitation,</b> in the second chapter describes compact nursing care. Therefore, the third chapter of this thesis deals with the ethical and legal aspects of the decision making about <b>cardiopulmonary</b> <b>resuscitation.</b> As it is a psychological burden that threatens medical staff with stress and burnout, the last chapter is devoted to the mental stress of nurses who take care of patients after <b>cardiopulmonary</b> <b>resuscitation.</b> The first objective of this theoretical bachelor thesis was, based on the literature sources, to map comprehensively the care of patients after <b>cardiopulmonary</b> <b>resuscitation.</b> This includes mapping techniques of <b>cardiopulmonary</b> <b>resuscitation</b> according to the latest recommendations, and then mapping the complex nursing care of the patient after successfully restored blood circulation. Given that death has become unacceptable in today's society and is perceived as a failure of medicine, the medical personnel are faced with a difficult situation. Still more and more progress and achievements in the treatment give the public the feeling that medicine is omnipotent. But keep in mind the possible downsides of the success in the treatment, sometimes at the expense of the quality of the patient's life. Therefore, the second aim of this study was to map comprehensively the ethical and legal aspects of the decision to start <b>cardiopulmonary</b> <b>resuscitation.</b> For the theoretical part of the thesis, the method of design and demonstrations was chosen. To obtain the awareness of the latest recommendations in <b>cardiopulmonary</b> <b>resuscitation,</b> the subsequent comprehensive care of the patient after the restoration of spontaneous circulation, and ethical and legal aspects of the decision to start <b>cardiopulmonary</b> <b>resuscitation,</b> which is captured in the following pages, was necessary to study bibliographic publications from experts in the field of anesthesia, resuscitation, law and ethics, as well as Czech and foreign professional journals and articles. Through the detailed study of the professional literature, it has been attempted to give a relevant statement about the ascertained facts. The information obtained is further elaborated in the individual chapters. The study is theoretical and is intended primarily for healthcare professionals in the care of patients after <b>cardiopulmonary</b> <b>resuscitation.</b> Finally, the thesis contains the area of mental health and struggle with stress and burnout. The theme of <b>cardiopulmonary</b> <b>resuscitation</b> is still acute, since today's modern society is full of lifestyle diseases, full of stress and haste, which can threaten individuals with a sudden loss of vital functions; whatever the cause of the problems is...|$|R
