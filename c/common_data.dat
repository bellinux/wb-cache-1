5|$|After the Square Enix merger, {{however, the}} {{individual}} teams still continued to program and customize their own tools for each game, which would eventually {{go to waste}} as only their respective creators {{knew how to use}} them. With the amount of assets and tools required by the in-development Final Fantasy XII and the impending advent of the seventh console generation, a <b>common</b> <b>data</b> format for the company was proposed in 2004. It was to be developed in-house and replace general-purpose formats such as FBX and COLLADA. Realizing the goal of an engine with a common set of tools proved to be difficult, as many production teams wanted to further their own interests rather than those of the company as a whole. Select staff members from different company divisions teamed up to work on the project on a voluntary basis, but their loose organizational structure failed to yield results. Nevertheless, Murata considered this group effort a first step in the right direction. In 2005, he was appointed general manager of the newly formed Technology Division. Although this enabled Murata and his subordinates to talk about a company-wide engine more extensively, the lack of manpower again prevented any significant achievements.|$|E

A game theoretic model demonstrates that when common property goods are complementary to private inputs in production, {{an increase in}} wealth inequality {{can lead to a}} decrease in exploitation of the <b>commons.</b> <b>Data</b> from 350 Mexican common properties show that as inequality increases, those on {{the lower end of the}} land distribution are less likely to use the <b>commons.</b> The <b>data</b> also show a negative correlation between inequality and poverty.

25|$|The {{programmer}} is free {{to choose}} which semantics are more appropriate for each data structure in the application. Larger structures like windows would be defined as classes, allowing them to be passed around as pointers. Smaller structures, like a 2D point, {{can be defined as}} structs, which will be pass-by-value and allow direct access to their internal data with no dereference. The performance improvement inherent to the pass-by-value concept is such that Swift uses these types for almost all <b>common</b> <b>data</b> types, including Int and Double, and types normally represented by objects, like String and Array. Using value types can result in significant performance improvements in user applications also.|$|E
25|$|The gap {{in income}} {{between rich and}} poor is greater in the United States than in any other {{developed}} country. Starting in the 1980s relative poverty rates have consistently exceeded those of other wealthy nations, though analyses using a <b>common</b> <b>data</b> set for comparisons tend to find that the U.S. has a lower absolute poverty rate by market income than most other wealthy nations. Extreme poverty in the United States, meaning households living on less than $2 per day before government benefits, doubled from 1996 levels to 1.5 million households in 2011, including 2.8 million children. In 2013, child poverty reached record high levels, with 16.7 million children living in food insecure households, about 35% more than 2007 levels. As of 2015, 44 percent of children in the United States live with low-income families.|$|E

Some are based upon text input fields and are intended to input and validate specific <b>common</b> <b>data.</b> These include email to enter email addresses, tel for telephone numbers, number for numeric values. There are additional attributes to specify required fields, fields that should have keyboard focus when the web page containing the form is loaded, and placeholder text that is displayed within the field but is not user input (such as the 'Search' text displayed in many search input fields before a search term is entered.) These tasks used to be handled with JavaScript, but had become so common that support for them {{was added to the}} standard.

2500|$|On 22 June 2007, U.S. News & World Report editor Robert Morse {{issued a}} {{response}} {{in which he}} argued, [...] "in terms of the peer assessment survey, we at U.S. News firmly believe the survey has significant value because {{it allows us to}} measure the [...] "intangibles" [...] of a college that we can't measure through statistical data. Plus, the reputation of a school can help get that all-important first job and plays a key part in which grad school someone {{will be able to get}} into. The peer survey is by nature subjective, but the technique of asking industry leaders to rate their competitors is a commonly accepted practice.
