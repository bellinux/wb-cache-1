5|$|The {{entry of}} both the Czech Republic and Poland to the European Union in May 2004, and {{especially}} the entry of the countries to the EU's passport-free Schengen zone in late 2007, reduced the significance of territorial disputes, ending systematic controls {{on the border between}} the countries. Signs prohibiting passage across the state border were removed, with people now allowed to <b>cross</b> <b>the</b> <b>border</b> freely at any point of their choosing.|$|E
5|$|Thereafter, {{operations}} moved towards {{securing the}} borders with Kenya {{in the provinces}} of Afmadow and Badhadhe in the Lower Juba region. Ethiopian aircraft and attack helicopters struck the town of Doble (Dhoobley) in Afmadow province, {{not far from the}} Kenyan border. The strikes were presumably to hit ICU elements attempting to <b>cross</b> <b>the</b> <b>border.</b> Fighting tailed off after midnight.|$|E
5|$|With {{medical and}} other non combat units, the force totalled around 2,000 men. Intelligence {{gathered}} supported {{the theory that}} Dinar was going to invade Sudan, so in March 1916 Wingate ordered Kelly to <b>cross</b> <b>the</b> <b>border</b> and occupy Jebel el Hella and Um Shanga. The two villages offered the only permanent water supplies {{that were on the}} road to El Fasher, Dinar's capital.|$|E

5|$|From {{the time}} of the invasion, {{significant}} numbers of Belgian men had attempted to flee the occupied territories to join the Belgian army on the Yser front, via the Netherlands which were neutral. In order to stop this, the Germans began work on a barbed wire and electric fence across the length of the border. The fence, dubbed the Wire of Death (Dodendraad), was also guarded by German sentries. Between 2,000 and 3,000 civilians are believed to have been killed attempting to <b>cross</b> <b>the</b> <b>border</b> during the conflict.|$|E
5|$|In February 1916, Wilson enlisted as {{a private}} in the Maryland National Guard and was posted to Company H, 5th Maryland Infantry. This unit was called to active duty at Laurel, Maryland in June 1916 for service on the Mexican border. It was based at Eagle Pass, Texas, and, like most National Guard units, {{supported}} but did not directly participate in the Pancho Villa Expedition, although it did occasionally <b>cross</b> <b>the</b> <b>border</b> into Mexico. Wilson was soon promoted to corporal, and later sergeant. The 5th Maryland Regiment returned to Maryland in February 1917.|$|E

5|$|On 14 October 1920, Finland and Soviet Russia {{signed the}} Treaty of Tartu, {{confirming}} the new Finnish-Soviet border {{as the old}} border between the autonomous Grand Duchy of Finland and Imperial Russia proper. In addition, Finland received Petsamo, with its ice-free harbour on the Arctic Ocean. The treaty did not prevent the Finnish government from allowing volunteers to <b>cross</b> <b>the</b> <b>border</b> to support the East-Karelian Uprising in 1921 however, nor expatriate Finnish communists from causing disturbances in Finland. In 1923 both countries signed the Border Peace Agreement, which normalized the border.|$|E
5|$|The Kosovo {{conflict}} escalated {{over the}} summer of 1998, and the KLA increasingly took to smuggling weapons and supplies from Albania {{across the border into}} Kosovo. In September, Yugoslav officials stated that 90 militants had been killed while attempting to illegally <b>cross</b> <b>the</b> <b>border</b> since January of that year. The Yugoslav Defense Ministry reported that 947 rifles, 161 light machine guns, 33 mortars, 55 mines, 3,295 hand grenades, and almost 350,000 rounds of ammunition had been confiscated over the same period.|$|E

CIA officers at the base were involved in the coordination, targeting and surveillance of drone strikes aimed at the Afghan Taliban, the Haqqani network, the Pakistani Taliban and al-Qaeda. At the time of the attack, they were conducting an aggressive campaign against the Haqqani network, a radical group run by Jalaluddin Haqqani and his son, Sirajuddin Haqqani.|$|E

While waiting for the sergeants to arrive, Princip and Grabež had a falling out with Čabrinović over Čabrinović's {{repeated}} violations of operational security. Čabrinović handed over the weapons he was carrying to Princip and Grabež. Princip told Čabrinović to go alone to Zvornik, make an official crossing there using Grabež's ID card and then go on to Tuzla and link back up.|$|E
5|$|About half {{of those}} {{who lost their lives}} on the Wall were killed in the first five years after it was {{originally}} installed. Death rates fell from then on, and took a particularly dramatic downturn after 1976. Nearly 86% of the Wall's victims, 120 people, died between 1961 and 1975; between 1976 and 1989 only 19 died. Several factors account for this reduction. The Wall became even more impregnable owing to technical improvements carried out in the mid-1970s and more restrictions were put on the area adjoining the Wall, making it more difficult to reach in the first place. The signing of the Helsinki Accords in 1975 led to new opportunities to <b>cross</b> <b>the</b> <b>border</b> legally, resulting in a rise in emigration applications and a corresponding fall in escape attempts.|$|E
5|$|After the Polish {{units were}} {{defeated}} by the Russians at Šiauliai, Gen. Chłapowski decided to <b>cross</b> <b>the</b> <b>border</b> into Prussia and become interned there. Plater vocally criticized that decision, refused to follow orders and instead {{decided to try to}} break through to Warsaw and continue the struggle. However, soon after separating from the main force, accompanied by only two others, including her cousin (or uncle, sources vary), Cezary Plater, she became seriously ill. She never recovered, and she died in a manor of the Abłamowicz family in Justinavas on 23 December 1831. She was buried in the small village of Kapčiamiestis near Lazdijai. After the defeat of the uprising, her estate was confiscated by the Russian authorities.|$|E

5|$|Because he and {{his father}} held strong anti-communist beliefs, Koubek decided to flee Czechoslovakia after the Communist coup d'état of February 1948. He tried to <b>cross</b> <b>the</b> <b>border</b> into the American Zone of Occupation of Allied-occupied Germany, and failed. A second attempt in July succeeded. Koubek emigrated to the United Kingdom in October 1948, where he worked in a brickyard, as a {{draftsman}} for the city of Gloucester and county of Gloucestershire, a draftsman for the Ministry of Works, and announcer for the Czech language news service of the BBC. He encountered his future wife, Eva, in a bookstore in London. Eva was born in Prague, the daughter of a Czech Army officer. Her brother, whom she later rescued, was imprisoned in a concentration camp in Nazi Germany during World War II.|$|E
5|$|In {{the years}} after Trafalgar, Gibraltar became a major supply base for {{supporting}} the Spanish uprising against Napoleon. The French invasion of Spain in 1808 prompted Gibraltar's British garrison to <b>cross</b> <b>the</b> <b>border</b> and destroy the ring of Spanish fortresses around the bay, {{as well as the}} old Spanish fortified lines on the isthmus, to deny the French the ability to besiege Gibraltar or control the bay from shore batteries. French forces reached as far as San Roque, just north of Gibraltar, but did not attempt to target Gibraltar itself as they believed that it was impregnable. The French besieged Tarifa, further down the coast, in 1811–12 but gave up after a month. Gibraltar faced no further military threat for a century.|$|E
5|$|The new route turned {{west from}} Muong May, at the {{southern}} end of Laos, and paralleled the Kong River into Cambodia. Eventually, this network extended past Siem Prang and reached the Mekong River near Stung Treng. The next step was the seizure of the town of Kratie, in east central Cambodia, on 5 May. The 470th cleared the population out of the Mekong River town and turned it into its administrative headquarters. PAVN Base Areas to the east were fed by Kratie while men and supplies headed for the Mekong Delta region of South Vietnam were now circled westward, around Phanom Penh, through the foothills of the Cardamom Mountains and then east again to <b>cross</b> <b>the</b> <b>border.</b>|$|E

5|$|The {{successor}} of von Diebitsch as Commander in Chief of Russian {{forces in}} Poland, Count Ivan Paskevich, {{decided to wait}} for the Polish forces on other fronts to be defeated before he resumed his march on Warsaw. In June 1831 General Antoni Giełgud's attack on Wilno failed, and his corps was forced to <b>cross</b> <b>the</b> <b>border</b> with Prussia to avoid complete destruction. Only a small detachment under General Henryk Dembiński managed to rejoin the main Polish force. This secured Paskevich's northern flank and allowed his forces to devise a new plan of attack. Instead of attacking the city directly and risking yet another defeat, he intended to surround Warsaw, cut it off from other Polish-controlled areas, and force it into submission.|$|E
5|$|The tercentenary of {{the capture}} of Gibraltar was celebrated in the {{territory}} in August 2004 but attracted criticism from some in Spain. In September 2006, tripartite talks between Spain, Gibraltar and the UK resulted in a deal (known as the Cordoba Agreement) {{to make it easier}} to <b>cross</b> <b>the</b> <b>border</b> and to improve transport and communications links between Spain and Gibraltar. Among the changes was an agreement to lift restrictions on Gibraltar's airport to enable airlines operating from Spain to land there and to facilitate use of the airport by Spanish residents. It did not address the vexed issue of sovereignty, but this time the government of Gibraltar supported it. A new Constitution Order was promulgated in the same year, which was approved by a majority of 60.24% in a referendum held in November 2006.|$|E
5|$|West Germans {{were able}} to <b>cross</b> <b>the</b> <b>border</b> {{relatively}} freely to visit relatives, but {{had to go through}} numerous bureaucratic formalities. East Germans were subjected to far stricter restrictions. It was not until November 1964 that they were allowed to visit the West at all, and even then only pensioners were allowed. This gave rise to a joke that only in East Germany did people look forward to old age. Younger East Germans were not allowed to travel to the West until 1972, though few did so until the mid-1980s. They had to apply for an exit visa and passport, pay a substantial fee, obtain permission from their employer and undergo an interrogation from the police.|$|E
