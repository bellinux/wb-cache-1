For policymakers, {{it is important to}} know (1) the obstacles faced by high growth firms are and (2) the obstacles faced by firms with the potential to achieve high growth, but which are yet to achieve this. This investigates these issues using the UK Small Business Survey.

The data were obtained from two of the first phases of the schemes, comprising of seven individual health centres with a total capital cost of approximately £ 26 million. The research was qualitative in nature and assessed the complete process of procurement from bidding and negotiation through to completion. The analysis highlighted difficulties in demonstrating value for money and concludes that the bidding process can be an unequal struggle between large consortia and inexperienced clients that may result in a wasted opportunity to obtain the optimum design and price. In terms of governance, the procurement process was extended to later phases before full evaluations of the schemes had been undertaken. Findings further show the additional <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>premises</b> procured in the above manner and the ability of the scheme to meet the government’s objectives in the later phases...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an economic analysis {{the use of}} an IP-PBX for premises telephony. The analysis estimates the impact of installing an IP-PBX on the <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>premises,</b> local and long distance calling. Results show that an IP-PBX is more expensive than traditional Centrex when only premises telephony costs are considered. This is largely due to the current high costs of gateway equipment to interface an IP-PBX to the Public Switched Telephone Network. As an immature product, IP Telephony equipment costs are high, but are projected to decline sharply in the future. The higher costs of an IP-PBX can be offset by savings in toll calls, particularly for medium and large firms. These savings are largely obtained on intra-corporate calls, which are assumed to travel entirely as IP between IP-PBXs at each end. Internet Telephony Interexchange Carriers (ITXCs) currently provide low cost toll services. They realize cost savings through the avoidance of access charges paid by traditional IXCs. Both Centrex and IP-PBX users may make use of an ITXC to lower toll calling costs. However, an IP-PBX user, by delivering calls already in packet form, enables the ITXC to avoid incoming gatewa...|$|E
40|$|Summary. This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the movement of manufacturing industry between GB counties during the period 1972 - 81. After discussing the nature of movement data, the inter-regional and inter-county movement of manufacturing establishments is examined for the period 1972 - 81. The main focus of the paper, however, lies {{in the development of a}} model of industrial movement based upon a stock-adjustment approach distinguishing between actual and optimal moves and leading to an empirical test of various explanations of industrial movement via a binomial probability model. The main findings are that inter-county differences in industrial rates and in the <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>premises</b> had a significant effect on movement during the period 1972 - 81. Distance, as expected, also played a critical role in explaining the geographical pattern of movement though labour availability and labour costs were found to be unrelated to this pattern. Finally, the impact of regional financial incentives is found to be negligible but this result may be due to the spatially restricted nature of certain data items which limit the subsequent application of the model. The spatial pattern and dynamics of industrial transferred to another location (as shown in location have proved to be of continuing interest to Figure 1). The spatial pattern of economic activity both academics and policymakers over a long period can therefore change for a combination of reasons, of time. The primary reason for this interest is that one of these being the movement of industry changes in the spatial pattern of industrial location between geographical areas. If changes in the spatia...|$|E

It is endemic in Malaysia, with an annual average of 35, 403 reported dengue cases from 2001 to 2010. The economic burden of dengue for Malaysia in 2009 was MYR 359. 79 million (US 102. 2 million) but these estimates are incomplete because the public sector <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> disease control had not been considered. This study estimated the <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> dengue control and prevention in Malaysia and measured the overall economic impact of dengue in the country. It also examined the variations in dengue vector control costs and resources consumption between the District Health Departments (DHDs) and Local Authorities (LAs) to assist informed decision making as to the future roles of these agencies {{in the delivery of}} dengue vector control services in Malaysia. Data were collected from representative vector control units of DHDs, State Health Departments (SHDs) and Federal Health Department (FHD) from Ministry of Health Malaysia and the corresponding LAs at the sampled districts. The costs and resources consumption by capital and recurrent items in 2010 were captured. The data was recorded by level in a matrix by line items and functions. Line items consist of human personnel, buildings, vehicles, equipment, pesticides, personal protective equipment (PPE) and outsourcing of fogging services to private pest control companies.

To a large extent this arises {{from the fact that}} in the industrial sphere it is generally possible to assess the potential results of contemplated projects with greater accuracy than in most other sectors of the economy. The intelligent entrepreneur would, for instance, undertake a survey of the potential or existing level of demand for the article which he plans to produce, he would determine the cost of raw materials and the sources of supply, the cost of power, the availability of labour of the right caliber, the <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>premises,</b> marketing costs, and so on. In the majority of instances these factors can be accurately gauged. From this data the industrialist is able to determine the price at which he would have to sell his product in order to yield an acceptable margin of profit and to demonstrate whether or not he will be able to compete successfully with other manufacturers or comparable imported goods. Armed with this information he is in a position to make serious approaches to the various available sources of finance and to persuade them of the feasibility of his project, provided always that he can also satisfy them that he will have the necessary expertise and equipment to deliver a good quality article. In the agricultural, mining and even in the commercial fields the unknown and, therefore, the risk factors, which are almost invariably of material importance, are more numerous and all too often there are some unanswered questions which tend to make investors hesitate...|$|E

A recent Supreme Court of Canada judgement directly addressing aspects of quality of care, combined with related government policy, provides an impetus for a review of research on quality as it affects <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> care. Our <b>premise</b> is that quality problems may not be the result of financing constraints but rather quality issues are a significant contributor to funding pressures. Theoretical and empirical evidence is reviewed and the implications for decision makers are discussed. A managerial focus on cost minimisation strategies makes implementing priority setting processes challenging because it calls for behaviours that typically counter professional self-interest. We suggest that a focus on quality would ultimately provide an effective strategy to contain costs, not to mention having a positive impact on patient well-being.

Evidence, drawn from fifteen selected labour halls, illuminates a diverse range of themes, including the role of political and industrial organisations; the provision of leisure and working class education; the representation of women and the nature of gender-specific organisation; the increasing non-political usage <b>of</b> the <b>premises</b> and the diverse range of associations which using the halls. Furthermore, financial necessity precipitated a certain degree of pragmatism in the management of the halls, as evidenced by the hiring of rooms to organisations such as the Communist Party of Great Britain and the frequent sale of alcohol on the premises. Comparative studies centred upon Cambridge, Sheffield and Newport, South Wales, established that there was no indication of a specific and unique "Greater London Labour Hall" identity. The reasons for the decline of the 15 halls were more complex and extensive than the existing literature on the post-war Labour Party implies.
