40|$|To tide {{over the}} recent global {{economic}} slump, China has modified their growth policy. To bring up their domestic demand, Chinese government is enormously financing their domestic markets and expedites reforming their labor markets by alleviating the HUKOU system, which has restricted migration of labor forces. This paper analysis {{the effects of}} the recently altered policies about domestic demand expansion and labor market reform, using the Dynamic General Equilibrium Model. The analysis shows that the domestic demand expansion policy will lead increase in disposable income of households, GDP and interest rate, which attracts foreign directed investments; increase in demands will cause increase in price level, which ill-affects the terms of trade. As a matter of fact, the trade surplus of China will likely be diminished. Furthermore, according to the analysis, relaxing restrictions about migration of labor forces will help the domestic demand expansion policy to accelerate economic growth. Therefore, the Republic of Korea should establish careful exportation strategies which aim the rapidly growing <b>Chinese</b> <b>domestic</b> <b>demand</b> markets...|$|E
40|$|Chinese inflation, {{particularly}} non-food inflation, {{has been}} surprisingly modest in recent years. We find that supply factors, including those captured through upstream foreign commodity and producer prices, {{have been important}} drivers of non-food inflation, as has foreign <b>demand</b> for <b>Chinese</b> goods. <b>Domestic</b> <b>demand</b> and monetary conditions seem less important, possibly reflecting a large domestic output gap generated by many years of high investment. Inflation varies systemically within China, with richer (and urban) provinces having lower, more stable, inflation, but this urban inflation also influence that in lower-income provinces.

In this research, we provide a simple empirical characterisation of recent transitions in China's market for refined petroleum products.

30|$|Many {{commodity}} {{prices in the}} <b>Chinese</b> <b>domestic</b> market are higher than those in other countries or regions. This is due to Chinese companies’ high pricing strategies resulting from the market structure, or due to excess demand stemming from absurd consumption behavior in the domestic market, or even possibly due to high indirect taxes. The value-added tax, the consumption tax, the business tax, and various tariffs (including the export tax rebate) altogether accounted for 69.75  % of national tax revenues in 2011. Value-added taxes {{in most parts of}} the Asia Pacific region are 5  % or 10  %. The 17  % base rate of the value-added tax in China is therefore much higher than average. The scope of the consumption tax is also broader and so is the tax rate. The indirect tax structure has intrinsically determined a high ratio of tax to price for commodities. The sum total of Chinese taxes (at a great degree via tax transfer) acted together to increase {{commodity prices}} and led to consumption outflows, which in turn affected policies meant to spur <b>domestic</b> <b>demand.</b> In order to further increase <b>domestic</b> <b>demand,</b> China must adjust the current system, which is based on indirect taxation.|$|R

40|$|This study {{examines}} Granger causality among exports, <b>domestic</b> <b>demand,</b> {{and economic growth}} in China using time-series data over the period from 1978 to 2002. This study uses three measures for <b>domestic</b> <b>demand,</b> namely household consumption, government consumption, and investment. The results show bidirectional Granger causality among these variables, namely exports, <b>domestic</b> <b>demand,</b> and economic growth. Thus, there is a dynamic relationship among exports, <b>domestic</b> <b>demand,</b> and economic growth. Exports and <b>domestic</b> <b>demand</b> are both important for economic growth in China.

40|$|Sources of {{economic}} growth can be explained both from supply-side and demand-side. Supplyside explanation, firstly, calculates contribution of input growth to output growth, and then remaining part of the output growth is admitted as growth rate of technology. Similarly, after calculating contributions of <b>domestic</b> <b>demand</b> and foreign demand, growth rate of technology which is motivated by <b>domestic</b> and foreign <b>demand</b> growth can be calculated. In this study, sources of growth from demand-side are calculated for China for 1972 and 2012. According to the results, growth is completely stemmed from <b>domestic</b> <b>demand</b> growth and technological progress, which is motivated by <b>domestic</b> <b>demand.</b> Since economic growth is motivated by <b>domestic</b> <b>demand,</b> then, macroeconomic policy should focus on <b>domestic</b> <b>demand...</b>|$|R

40|$|Fundamental {{relationships}} between different macroeconomic variables may follow certain common theories but local preferences are also decisive in determining their behavior since, macro economy of every country {{is unique and}} they need to be treated after considering their peculiarities. In this regard, looking into domestic demand-growth nexus and export-growth nexus are, therefore, needed in order to understand the long -run economic stance and to capture the short-run dynamics in the national economy as well as to find evidence about the source of economic growth. However, the causal relationship between exports, <b>domestic</b> <b>demand</b> and economic growth in Ethiopia has not received adequate attention. Therefore, the aim of this study is to find a causal relationship between export, <b>domestic</b> <b>demand</b> and economic growth in Ethiopia using time series data over the period 1960161 - 201011 I. This study uses two measures for <b>domestic</b> <b>demand,</b> namely household consumption and government consumption. Granger causality and Johansen co integration test are employed in the empirical analysis. Result of Johansen cointegration test indicates the existence of long run relationship among the variables. The result of Granger causality test shows that there is a dynamic relationship between export and economic growth and between <b>domestic</b> <b>demand</b> and economic growth. Export and <b>domestic</b> <b>demand</b> are important for economic growth as well as, economic growth have an impact on export and <b>domestic</b> <b>demand</b> in Ethiopia. A successful and sustained economic growth requires growth in both export and <b>domestic</b> <b>demand.</b> Nevertheless, a balance emphasis should be to <b>domestic</b> <b>demand</b> to push the economy towards higher growth path.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} reasons behind the {{resilience}} of China's economy to the global financial tsunami. China's economy is lowly leveraged in its banking, household, public and external sectors and, therefore, is less plagued by the global deleveraging than most developed economies. <b>Chinese</b> <b>domestic</b> sectors have improved significantly over the past decade, giving them larger capacity to cope with external shocks than during the Asian financial crisis a decade ago. Contrary to {{the conventional wisdom that}} China's economic growth is highly dependent on exports, we find that the main growth engine for China is <b>domestic</b> <b>demand.</b> Destocking, rather than falling exports, was the main cause of the sharp economic slowdown in China in late 2008 and early 2009. Therefore, the global economic slowdown should have limited impact on China's economy. We forecast a sustained economic recovery in China in 2009 - 2011, with real GDP growth exceeding 10 percent in 2010.

Hub carriers are able to charge higher prices to premium class passengers and non-hub carriers benefit from the “umbrella effects” of hub premiums. However, hub carriers are not able to translate their airport dominance to pricing power in the economy class market, whereas non-hub carriers even have to reduce the prices as their market shares at major airports increase. This study contributes to the literature by explicitly segmenting the market into economy and premium classes.

The impact on UK output and inflation depends on the nature of the shock that drives global rebalancing. An increase in <b>domestic</b> <b>demand</b> in the ROW would raise UK exports and output, but would also contribute to increased inflationary pressure in the United Kingdom. Further weakness in US <b>domestic</b> <b>demand</b> is likely to weigh on UK output and inflation.
