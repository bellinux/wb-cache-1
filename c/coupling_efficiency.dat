The Nova design was then modified into a smaller 10-beam design that added frequency conversion to 351nm light, which would increase <b>coupling</b> <b>efficiency.</b> In operation, Nova was able to deliver about 30kJ of UV laser energy, about half of what was initially expected, primarily due to limits set by optical damage to the final focusing optics. Even at those levels, it was clear that the predictions for fusion production were still wrong; even at the limited powers available, fusion yields were far below predictions.|$|E
2500|$|A horn {{loudspeaker}} is a loudspeaker or loudspeaker element which uses an acoustic horn {{to increase the}} overall efficiency of the driving element(s). A common form (right) consists of a compression driver which produces sound waves with a small metal diaphragm vibrated by an electromagnet, attached to a horn, a flaring duct to conduct the sound waves to the open air. Another type is a woofer driver mounted in a loudspeaker enclosure which is divided by internal partitions to form a zigzag flaring duct which functions as a horn; this type is called a folded horn speaker. The horn serves to improve the <b>coupling</b> <b>efficiency</b> between the speaker driver and the air. The horn {{can be thought of}} as an [...] "acoustic transformer" [...] that provides impedance matching between the relatively dense diaphragm material and the less-dense air.

40|$|We make a {{thorough}} analysis of heralded single photon sources regarding how {{factors such as}} the detector gate-period, the photon rates, the fiber <b>coupling</b> <b>efficiencies,</b> and the system losses affect the performance of the source. In the course of this we give a detailed description of how to determine fiber <b>coupling</b> <b>efficiencies</b> from experimentally measurable quantities. We show that asynchronous sources perform, under most conditions, better than synchronous sources with respect to multiphoton events, but only for nearly perfect <b>coupling</b> <b>efficiencies.</b> We apply the theory to an asynchronous source of heralded single photons based on spontaneous parametric downconversion in a periodically poled, bulk, KTiOPO 4 crystal. The source generates light with highly non-degenerate wavelengths of 810 nm and 1550 nm, where the 810 nm photons are used to announce the presence of the 1550 nm photons inside a single-mode optical fiber. For our setup we find the probability of having a 1550 nm photon present in the single-mode fiber, as announced by the 810 nm photon, to be 48 %. The probability of multiphoton events is strongly suppressed compared to a Poissonian light source, giving highly sub-Poisson photon statistics. Comment: 9 pages, 9 figures, ReVTeX...|$|R

This {{article is}} {{published}} with open access at Springerlink. com Abstract CYP 102 A 1, originating from Bacillus megaterium, {{is a highly}} active enzyme which has attracted much attention because of its potential applicability as a biocatalyst for oxidative reactions. Previously we developed drug-metabolizing mutant CYP 102 A 1 M 11 {{by a combination of}} site-directed and random mutagenesis. CYP 102 A 1 M 11 contains eight mutations, when compared with wild-type CYP 102 A 1, and is able to produce humanrelevant metabolites of several pharmaceuticals. In this study, active-site residue 87 of drug-metabolizing mutant CYP 102 A 1 M 11 was mutated to all possible natural amino acids to investigate its role in substrate selectivity and regioselectivity. With alkoxyresorufins as substrates, large differences in substrate selectivities and <b>coupling</b> <b>efficiencies</b> were found, dependent on the nature of residue 87. For all combinations of alkoxyresorufins and mutants, extremely fast rates of NADPH oxidation were observed (up to 6, 000 min- 1).

Today, a large breakthrough is compromised by high coupling losses between the chip and the outside world (optical fiber). Grating couplers, when made in a high vertical index-contrast material system, can achieve high <b>coupling</b> <b>efficiencies</b> to fiber and still be very compact (10 µm). However, the InP-material system, needed for active optical functions (e. g. lasers), has a low index contrast. In this paper, we describe the design and fabrication of compact and efficient grating couplers in InP. A high vertical index-contrast is achieved by wafer bonding. First (simple) components were fabricated, and <b>coupling</b> <b>efficiencies</b> to fiber of 30 % were measured. More complex structures show theoretical efficiencies above 80 %.
