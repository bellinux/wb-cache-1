40|$|This study {{examined}} relationship of organizational politics {{and support to}} job satisfaction, turnover intent, organizational commitment (affective dan normative), job performance and OCB; and to investigated whether politics <b>could</b> <b>explained</b> incremental variance in dependent variable beyond be explained by support, or vice versa. The sample was accountant staff those working at 15 Public Accountant Offices in Surabaya. The result show that politics were negatively related to job satisfaction, affective and normative commitment, job performance; positively related to turnover intent. Support {{was positively related to}} job satisfaction, affective and normative commitment; negatively related to turnover intent. Politics and support <b>could</b> <b>explained</b> incremental variance beyond each other...|$|R

5|$|Amenemhat {{may have}} died without a male heir, which <b>could</b> <b>explain</b> {{why he was}} succeeded by Sobekneferu. However, some egyptologists, such as Aidan Dodson and Kim Ryholt, have {{proposed}} that the first two rulers of the 13th Dynasty, Sobekhotep I and Amenemhat Sonbef, were his sons. Amenenmhat IV may have been Sobeknefru's spouse, but no evidence currently substantiates this hypothesis.|$|E
5|$|At first, Napoleon was {{not totally}} {{confident}} of victory. In {{a letter written}} to Minister of Foreign Affairs Talleyrand, Napoleon requested Talleyrand not tell anyone about the upcoming battle {{because he did not}} want to disturb Empress Joséphine.

5|$|Dalton also {{believed}} atomic theory <b>could</b> <b>explain</b> why water absorbs different gases in different proportions. For example, {{he found that}} water absorbs carbon dioxide far better than it absorbs nitrogen. Dalton hypothesized {{this was due to}} the differences between the masses and configurations of the gases' respective particles, and carbon dioxide molecules (CO2) are heavier and larger than nitrogen molecules (N2).|$|E

5|$|A myth {{which is}} trait-based, though genetically impossible, {{is the idea}} that the modern Maine Coon descended from {{ancestors}} of semi-feral domestic cats and raccoons. This myth is likely based on the common color of the breed (brown tabby) and its bushy tail. Another idea is that the Maine Coon originated from the matings of domestic cats and wild bobcats, which <b>could</b> <b>explain</b> the tufts of hair that are so commonly seen on the tips of the ears.|$|E
5|$|Habermas {{argues that}} his ethical theory is an {{improvement}} on Kant's ethics. He rejects the dualistic framework of Kant's ethics. Kant distinguished between the phenomena world, {{which can be}} sensed and experienced by humans, and the noumena, or spiritual world, which is inaccessible to humans. This dichotomy was necessary for Kant because it <b>could</b> <b>explain</b> the autonomy of a human agent: although a human is bound in the phenomenal world, their actions are free in the intelligible world. For Habermas, morality arises from discourse, which is made necessary by their rationality and needs, rather than their freedom.|$|E

An {{alliance with}} Donnchad <b>could</b> <b>explain</b> Echmarcach's success in seizing the kingship from Sitriuc. Although Donnchad and Sitriuc were maternal half-brothersas both descended from Gormlaith ingen Murchada (died 1030)Donnchad's hostility towards Sitriuc {{is demonstrated by}} the record of a successful attack he led upon the Dubliners in 1026.|$|E

Gladwell replied, disputing Pinker's {{comments about the}} importance of IQ on teaching performance and by analogy, the effect, if any, of draft order on quarterback performance in the National Football League. Advanced NFL Stats addressed the issue statistically, siding with Pinker and showing that differences in methodology <b>could</b> <b>explain</b> the two men's differing opinions.|$|E
5|$|In 2013, Dwayne Heard at the University of Leeds {{suggested}} that quantum mechanical tunneling <b>could</b> <b>explain</b> a reaction his group observed taking place, at {{a significantly higher}} than expected rate, between cold (around 63 kelvins) hydroxyl and methanol molecules, apparently bypassing intramolecular energy barriers which {{would have to be}} overcome by thermal energy or ionization events for the same rate to exist at warmer temperatures. The proposed tunneling mechanism may help explain the common observation of fairly complex molecules (up to tens of atoms) in interstellar space.|$|E

5|$|In the 19th century, Belgian {{physicist}} Joseph Plateau examined soap films, {{leading him}} to formulate {{the concept of}} a minimal surface. German biologist and artist Ernst Haeckel painted hundreds of marine organisms to emphasise their symmetry. Scottish biologist D'Arcy Thompson pioneered the study of growth patterns in both plants and animals, showing that simple equations <b>could</b> <b>explain</b> spiral growth. In the 20th century, British mathematician Alan Turing predicted mechanisms of morphogenesis which give rise to patterns of spots and stripes. Hungarian biologist Aristid Lindenmayer and French American mathematician Benoît Mandelbrot showed how the mathematics of fractals could create plant growth patterns.|$|E
5|$|It is {{conceivable}} that Ímar received some form of support from Knútr's son and successor in Britain, Haraldr Knútsson, King of England (died 1040). The latter was certainly in power when Ímar replaced Echmarcach, and an association between Ímar and Haraldr <b>could</b> <b>explain</b> why the Annals of Ulster reports the latter's death two years later. Ímar's reign lasted about eight years, {{and one of his}} first royal acts appears to have been the invasion of Rathlin Island within the year. The fact that he proceeded to campaign in the North Channel could indicate that Echmarcach had held power in this region before his acquisition of Mann and Dublin.|$|E
5|$|Newton died in {{his sleep}} in London on 20 March 1727 (OS 20 March 1726; NS 31 March 1727) and was buried in Westminster Abbey. Voltaire may have been present at his funeral. A bachelor, he had {{divested}} much of his estate to relatives during his last years, and died intestate. His papers went to John Conduitt and Catherine Barton. After his death, Newton's hair was examined and found to contain mercury, probably resulting from his alchemical pursuits. Mercury poisoning <b>could</b> <b>explain</b> Newton's eccentricity in late life.|$|E

30|$|TPBT was {{associated}} with longer duration of mechanical ventilation and ICU stay. No significant difference in ICU mortality was found, but hospital mortality was higher {{in the group of}} patients with moderate-to-large TPBT. The latter finding <b>could</b> be <b>explained</b> by a poorer condition after longer mechanical ventilation and ICU stay. Septic shock, which was more frequent in patients with moderate-to-large TPBT in our study, <b>could</b> also <b>explain</b> these findings.|$|R
5|$|The Venusian {{atmosphere}} {{has been}} found to be sufficiently out of equilibrium as to require further investigation. Analysis of data from the Venera, Pioneer, and Magellan missions has found the chemicals hydrogen sulfide (H2S) and sulfur dioxide (SO2) together in the upper atmosphere, as well as carbonyl sulfide (OCS). The first two gases react with each other, implying that something must produce them. Carbonyl sulfide is difficult to produce inorganically, but it is present in the Venusian atmosphere. However, the planet's volcanism <b>could</b> <b>explain</b> the presence of carbonyl sulfide. In addition, one of the early Venera probes detected large amounts of toxic chlorine just below the Venusian cloud deck.|$|E
5|$|While the Beagle {{surveyed}} {{the coasts of}} South America from February 1832 to September 1835, Darwin made several trips inland and found extensive evidence that the continent was gradually rising. After witnessing an erupting volcano from the ship, he experienced the 1835 Concepción earthquake. In the following months he speculated that as the land was uplifted, {{large areas of the}} ocean bed subsided. It struck him that this <b>could</b> <b>explain</b> the formation of atolls.|$|E
5|$|A second {{scenario}} considers pressure increases during decompression {{that reduce}} bubble diameters. This can allow bubbles {{trapped in the}} lung during a normal decompression to suddenly pass through the capillaries and become responsible for Type II DCS symptoms. This <b>could</b> <b>explain</b> the difference in outcomes of in-water decompression versus surface decompression. Data collected in the North Sea have shown that if the overall incidence rate of the two diving methods is about the same, that surface decompression tends to produce ten times more type II DCS than in-water decompression. It is assumed that when the diver ascends to the surface, bubbles are produced that are trapped by the lung capillaries, and on recompression of the diver in the deck chamber, these bubbles are reduced in diameter and pass to the arterial side, later causing neurological symptoms. The same scenario was proposed for type II DCS recorded after sawtooth diving profiles or multiple repetitive dives.|$|E
