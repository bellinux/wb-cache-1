A drop of sediment is placed into an 8 ml Hettich <b>cytocentrifuge</b> chamber prefilled with 2 ml of CytoRich Yellow (TriPath Imaging, Inc), a proprietary Saccomanno-like fixative that prevents dehydration and collapse of 3-dimensional structures when slides are air-dried, and then spun onto adhesive-coated slides. Advantages include batch processing and reusability of its funnel assembly, which decreases the bulk of disposable plastic that can significantly impact the environment as well as add {{to the cost of}} individual tests.|$|E
40|$|To {{facilitate}} {{the diagnosis of}} Pneumocystis carinii from bronchoalveolar lavage and sputum specimens, we have defined conditions for optimal use of the <b>cytocentrifuge</b> for this purpose.

40|$|The RMZ {{cell line}} was {{established}} from {{a bone marrow}} metastasis of a human alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma. Since {{the beginning of the}} in vitro culture, RMZ cells showed differentiation-related morphological heterogeneity: actively proliferating polygonal or spindle-shaped cells were observed along with a few multinucleated myotube-like structures and giant cells, frequently multinucleated. All these cell types were still present after over 40 passages. A set of clonal derivatives has been obtained from the second in vitro subculture. All the clones showed the same morphological heterogeneity of the parental cells, but differed from one another in the degree of differentiation. Multinucleated myotube-like structures were strongly stained by anti-desmin antibody; most mononuclear cells were weakly stained. About 80 % of RMZ and cloned cells were scored as desmin-positive in <b>cytocentrifuged</b> preparations. The expression of embryonic myosin heavy chain, specifically recognized by the monoclonal antibody BF-G 6, was found in RMZ cell line and was localised in the myotube-like structures. Only a few giant cells and rare mononucleated polygonal cells were stained. The average proportion of BF-G 6 positive cells in <b>cytocentrifuged</b> preparations was of about 6 % of the total RMZ cells.

The results of staining 145 cervical biopsy specimens with OKT 9 showed widespread staining in all malignant epithelia and most severely dysplastic epithelia.

40|$|An assay was {{developed}} {{for the detection of}} cytomegalovirus (CMV) antigens in blood leukocytes and evaluated for its diagnostic significance in six heart transplant recipients. Slides of <b>cytocentrifuged</b> blood leukocytes were prepared at regular intervals during the posttransplantation period and stained with CMV-specific monoclonal antibodies, a procedure that took 3 hours. CMV-antigen-positive leukocytes were detected in all five patients with active CMV infection but not in the patient without CMV infection.

However, the chemiluminescent response of breast cells was negligible, apparently the result of quenching secondary to fat present in the milk; preincubation of human blood leukocytes with the fatty layer of breast milk produced similar inhibition in the chemiluminescence assay.

40|$|The {{smear of}} a {{clinical}} specimen provides essential laboratory {{information that is}} used to make therapeutic decisions. For this study, smears were made by centrifugation in a Beckman Microfuge 11 (Beckman Instruments, Palo Alto, Calif.) and in parallel by using a Cytospin 2 apparatus (Shandon Inc., Pittsburgh, Pa.). Of 350 consecutive body fluid specimens examined, 50 (14. 0 %) grew bacteria. Both methods were culture and smear positive for 24 (6. 9 %) specimens; 18 (5. 1 %) specimens were <b>cytocentrifuge</b> smear positive, culture positive, and high-speed centrifugation (HSC) negative; 3 (0. 8 %) were culture negative and positive by both smear methods; and 1 (0. 2 %) was HSC smear positive, culture positive, and <b>cytocentrifuge</b> negative. Seven (2. 0 %) specimens were culture positive and negative by both smear methods. Clinically, <b>cytocentrifuge</b> preparations showed greater sensitivity for culture-positive specimens and a closer correlation with the CFU per milliliter than HSC did, resulting in a greater ability to treat patients with specific therapies. In addition, analysts needed to examine only a 6 -mm-diameter area on the slide, cells and microbes were somewhat larger and more regular in appearance, and smears stained more uniformly.

In an experimental study, 63 BALB/c mice received morphine. tramadol or saline intraperitoneally. On days 3, 5, and 10, the peritoneal phagocytes were incubated with an equal number of SRBCs.

Methods: Human mast cells were grown in serum-free culture condition from cord blood mononuclear cells with suplatast tosilate.

The acid alpha-naphthyl acetate esterase (ANAE) staining {{was used as}} marker for T cells. The distribution of the ANAE marker-carrying lymphocytes closely followed the percentual distribution of T cells in spleen and lymph node. Electrophoresis analysis demonstrated that while more than 95 % of resting spleen and lymph node T cells carried the ANAE marker, only less than 5 % of the B cells were ANAE positive. The B cells (surface-bound Ig-carrying small lymphocytes) were identified by anti-Ig serum followed by rosetting of the B cells with Staphylococcus aureus strain Cowan 1 (StaCw).

Ninety to 100 % of Con A-activated blasts expressed the ANAE marker but only 60 - 85 % of PHA and MLC-activated blasts were positive.

The percentage of gamma/delta T lymphocytes in the peripheral blood of tuberculin positive and tuberculin negative patients with Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection and healthy controls was compared. METHODS: Thirty six patients infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis and 11 healthy controls were studied. Lymphocytes were separated, <b>cytocentrifuged</b> onto glass microscope slides, and reacted with anti-gamma/delta monoclonal antibody. The percentage of gamma/delta positive cells was determined by microscopic counting of 300 lymphocytes. RESULTS: No difference was found in {{the percentage}} of gamma/delta T lymphocytes between patients and controls. However, when the patients were divided into two groups according to reactivity or non-reactivity in the Mantoux skin reaction a higher percentage of gamma/delta T lymphocytes {{was found in the}} peripheral blood of patients with tuberculin anergy than in tuberculin positive patients or controls. CONCLUSIONS: Higher gamma/delta T cell counts are found in tuberculin negative patients with tuberculosis than in tuberculin positive patients or tuberculin positive controls.

The levels of C 1 q, mannose-binding lectin (MBL) and C 3 were measured by ELISA in the cervicovaginal lavage (CVL) from gynaecological patients and controls. No significant differences were observed in the levels of these proteins in the three study groups. Immunofluorescence analysis of the clue cells and Candida hyphae from BV and VVC patients for surface-bound complement components showed the presence of C 3, while C 1 q was undetectable.

Binding of MBL to Candida, grown or <b>cytocentrifuged</b> from the CVL of VVC patients, {{was found to be}} pH dependent and occurred between pH 4 Â· 5 and pH 5 Â· 5. In conclusion, we demonstrated that MBL and C 3 present in the vaginal cavity act as recognition molecules for infectious agents that colonize the cervicovaginal mucosa. Our finding that MBL, but not C 1 q, binds to bacteria and fungi in vagina suggests that the lectin and classical pathways of complement activation may play a different role in immune defence in the female genital tract...|$|R
