25|$|The most {{sensitive}} pigment, rhodopsin, has a peak response at 500nm. Small {{changes to the}} genes coding for this protein can tweak the peak response by a few nm; pigments in the lens can also filter incoming light, changing the peak response. Many organisms are unable to discriminate between colours, seeing instead in shades of grey; colour vision necessitates a range of pigment cells which are primarily sensitive to smaller ranges of the spectrum. In primates, geckos, and other organisms, these {{take the form of}} cone cells, from which the more sensitive rod cells evolved. Even if organisms are physically capable of discriminating different colours, this {{does not necessarily mean that}} they can perceive the different colours; only with behavioural tests <b>can</b> <b>this</b> <b>be</b> deduced.|$|E
25|$|How <b>can</b> <b>this</b> <b>be</b> {{rational}} {{for both}} investors? The {{answer lies in}} the fact that the investors do not have to invest the full 100,000 US dollars. Max Return is content to invest only 10,000 US dollars for now. After all, Max Return may rationalize the outcome by thinking that maybe tomorrow there will be new opportunities available to invest the remaining 90,000 US dollars the bank is willing to lend Max Return, at even higher IRRs. Even if only seven more projects come along which are identical to Small-Is-Beautiful, Max Return would be able to match the NPV of Big-Is-Best, on a total investment of only 80,000 US dollars, with 20,000 US dollars left in the budget to spare for truly unmissable opportunities. Max Value is also happy, because she has filled her capital budget straight away, and decides she can take the rest of the year off investing.|$|E

In 1931 he again spent time in Berlin, writing to Aino in May 1931 that [...] "the symphony is advancing with rapid strides".

[...] In May 1933, as he {{continued to}} deny Koussevitzky, Sibelius wrote in his diary that he was deeply immersed in composition: [...] "It is as if I had come home... I'm taking everything in another way, more deeply. A gypsy within me. Romantic." [...] Later that summer he informed a journalist that his new symphony was nearly complete: [...] "It will be the reckoning of my whole existence – sixty-eight years. It will probably be my last.

[...] "How <b>can</b> <b>this</b> <b>be</b> right?" [...] He also added, [...] "There's class warfare, all right, but it's my class, the rich class, that's making war, and we're winning."

For example, Ted Sider is the same today as he was when he was born—he just changed. But how <b>can</b> <b>this</b> <b>be</b> if many parts of Ted today did not exist when Ted was just born?

2500|$|Holmes was {{partially}} modelled on his former university teacher Joseph Bell.

[...] Robert Louis Stevenson was able, even in faraway Samoa, to recognise the strong similarity between Joseph Bell and Sherlock Holmes: [...] "My compliments on your very ingenious and very interesting adventures of Sherlock Holmes.... <b>can</b> <b>this</b> <b>be</b> my old friend Joe Bell?" [...] Other authors sometimes suggest additional influences—for instance, the famous Edgar Allan Poe character C. Auguste Dupin. Dr. (John) Watson owes his surname, but not any other obvious characteristic, to a Portsmouth medical colleague of Doyle's, Dr James Watson.|$|E
