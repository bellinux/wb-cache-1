5|$|Alcatraz cellhouse had a {{corridor}} naming system named after major American streets and landmarks. Michigan Avenue was {{the corridor to}} the side of A-Block, and Broadway was the central corridor in which the inmates would assemble as they massed through Times Square (an area with a <b>clock</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall),</b> before entering the dining hall for their meals. Broadway separated Block-B and Block-C and prisoners kept along it had the least privacy in the prison. The corridor between Block-C and the library was called Park Avenue. The corridor in D-Block was named Sunset Strip. Gun galleries lay {{at the end of each}} block, including the West and East Gun Galleries.|$|E
500|$|A 12-6 elbow, {{referred}} to in commentary as a [...] "twelve to six elbow" [...] and officially [...] "downward elbow strikes", is a strike used in the combat sport of mixed martial arts (MMA). The name of the 12-6 elbow {{is based on the}} concept of a <b>clock</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> with the bringing of an elbow from straight up (12 o'clock) to straight down (6 o'clock).|$|E
500|$|The most {{commonly}} accepted {{definition of a}} 12-6 elbow was originally based on a principle by referee John McCarthy of a <b>clock</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall.</b> This came about after {{it was felt that}} the official definition of the foul was too broad. A 12-6 elbow was defined as bringing the elbow from [...] "twelve o'clock" [...] to [...] "six o'clock", which is where the name comes from. Similar elbow movements from a fighter on their back does not count as a 12-6 elbow, because as explained by McCarthy, [...] "the clock doesn't move". McCarthy's definition became accepted as the official definition of 12-6 elbows under the Unified Rules and MMA referees were encouraged to use this definition when making judgments on elbow strikes.|$|E

5000|$|The Westmoreland Building is a {{building}} typical {{of college and}} university campuses, while the Bullocks Wilshire Building is a fully restored art deco landmark that pays tribute to its history in many ways.

60|$|Larry laughed. He put <b>the</b> <b>clock</b> back <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> and gingerly {{removed his}} thumb. When Doris wasn't looking he {{examined}} his thumb.|$|R

60|$|There was utter silence, {{broken only}} by the ticking of the <b>clock</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall.</b> Dave looked at Gus Plum and Nat Poole, but neither budged.|$|E
60|$|The minutes dragged. A big <b>clock</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> ticked with {{an ominous}} sound. Kauffman drew out {{his watch and}} {{compared}} it with the clock. He appeared to grow restless.|$|E

60|$|After {{a glance}} at the <b>clock</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> opposite, he went into Number Four. The sound of the closing door was heard, the sound of the turning lock {{followed}} it. Then the dead silence fell over the house once more.|$|E
60|$|I {{walked to}} and fro, {{tried to read}} an old gazetteer, listened to the awful noises: looked at faces, scenes, and figures in the fire. At length, the steady ticking of the {{undisturbed}} <b>clock</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> tormented me to that degree that I resolved to go to bed.|$|E

60|$|A white-faced <b>clock</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> {{ticked off}} the seconds one by one.

50|$|The {{tower is}} in the Perpendicular style and, {{according}} to Hartwell and Pevsner, is similar to many North Lancashire church towers. It is 70 ft high and has square, angled buttresses and a crenellated parapet. The belfry louvres each have two trefoiled lights with tracery.

50|$|One of the {{features}} of the church is an early electric clock and the first in England to have a striking mechanism. It was controlled from a master clock in the nearby house. The clock mechanism was taken to the Science Museum in London for restoration in 1984. It was made by Charles Shepherd who also made the Shepherd Gate <b>Clock</b> mounted <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> outside <b>the</b> gate of the Royal Greenwich Observatory.|$|R
6000|$|There was a <b>clock</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> just {{opposite}} to Ned's desk, which that young gentleman {{was in the}} habit of consulting frequently--very frequently--and comparing with his watch, as if he doubted its veracity. This was very unreasonable, for he always found that the two timepieces told the truth; at least, that they agreed with each other. Nevertheless, in his own private heart, Ned Hooper thought that clock-- and sometimes called it--"the slowest piece of ancient furniture he had ever seen." ...|$|E
60|$|Nothing {{moved in}} the parlour till Mrs Verloc raised her head slowly {{and looked at the}} clock with inquiring mistrust. She had become aware of a ticking sound in the room. It grew upon her ear, while she remembered clearly that the <b>clock</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> was silent, had no audible tick. What did it mean by {{beginning}} to tick so loudly all of a sudden? Its face indicated ten minutes to nine. Mrs Verloc cared nothing for time, and the ticking went on. She concluded it could not be the clock, and her sullen gaze moved along the walls, wavered, and became vague, while she strained her hearing to locate the sound. Tic, tic, tic.|$|E
6000|$|Wilson {{stopped and}} stood silent. Inattention dies {{a quick and}} sure death when a speaker does that. The stillness gives warning that {{something}} is coming. All palms and finger balls went down now, all slouching forms straightened, all heads came up, all eyes were fastened upon Wilson's face. He waited yet one, two, three moments, to let his pause complete and perfect its spell upon the house; then, when through the profound hush {{he could hear the}} ticking of the <b>clock</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall,</b> he put out his hand and took the Indian knife by the blade and held it aloft where all could see the sinister spots upon its ivory handle; then he said, in a level and passionless voice: ...|$|E

In 1911, France adopted Paris Mean Time delayed 9 minutes 21 seconds, Greenwich Mean Time without mentioning Greenwich. At the same time, slow railway station clocks were eliminated.|$|R

60|$|No sooner was breakfast over (and it {{was over}} almost {{as quickly as it}} takes to tell), than the tired heads began to nod and droop, and in five minutes half of us were sound asleep. There were no signs of our being dismissed, while there were unmistakable signs of {{preparation}} for a meeting.

6000|$|Mrs. Roberts, with rapturous {{admiration of}} him: [...] "Well, Edward, {{you have got}} a brain! I declare, the cook had utterly gone out of my mind. Forgetting that plush bag makes me forget everything. I've got a splendid one--a perfect treasure. She won't do any of the wash, and we'll have to put that out; and she's been used to having a kitchen-maid; but she said we were such a small family that she could shell the pease herself. She's the most respectable-looking old thing you ever saw; and she's been having ten dollars a week from the last family she was in; but she'll come the summer with us for six. I was very {{fortunate}} to get her; all the good girls are snapped up for the sea-side in May, and they won't go into the country for love or money. It was the greatest chance! She's such a neat, quiet, lady-like person, and all the better for being Irish and a Catholic: Catholics do give so much more of a flavor; and I never could associate that Nova Scotia, sunken-cheeked leanness of Maria's with a cook. This one's name is--well, I forget what her name is; Bridget, or Norah, or something like that--and she's a perfect little butter-ball. She's coming {{to go out on the}} same train with us; and she'll get the dinner to-night; and I sha'n't have the mortification of sitting down to a pickup meal with Amy Campbell, the first time she has visited us; she's conceited enough about her house-keeping as it is, I'm sure, and I wouldn't have her patronizing and pitying me for worlds. The cook will be here at half-past three precisely; I had to pretend the train started a little earlier than it does so as to make her punctual; they are such uncertain things! and I don't suppose I shall be back by that time, quite, Edward, and so you must receive her. Let me see!" [...] She glances up at the <b>clock</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall.</b> [...] "It's just quarter-past now, and our train goes at ten minutes to four--My goodness! I'll have to hurry." ...|$|E

50|$|The {{church is}} a stone {{building}} of the early english and late perpendicular style.
