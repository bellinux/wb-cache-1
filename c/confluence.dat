5|$|Born in glaciers {{and flowing}} through a rugged {{landscape}} of mountains and valleys, the river drains an isolated and sparsely populated {{region of the}} Pacific Northwest. From its highest headwaters to its <b>confluence</b> with the Columbia River, the Kootenay falls more than two kilometers in elevation. Although comparable in length, watershed and discharge to the Columbia above the <b>confluence,</b> the Kootenay is of a notably different character; its much steeper gradient results {{in the formation of}} many rapids.|$|E

40|$|River <b>confluences</b> {{are common}} {{features}} of the landscape {{as a result of}} the dendritic nature of river catchments. Much of the research to date has investigated flow at lowland <b>confluences,</b> whereas the most dynamic river <b>confluences</b> are likely to be found in upland areas. Therefore, in order to improve the understanding of the flow, sediment transport and morphological processes at river <b>confluences,</b> it is necessary to investigate the applicability of the findings from lowland <b>confluences</b> to their upland counterparts. This thesis uses field and numerical modelling experiments to increase the understanding of the dynamics of these upland river <b>confluences.</b> Flow and particle tracking data have been obtained from two different field sites: the more stable upland river <b>confluences</b> of Moor House National Nature Reserve and the steeper <b>confluences</b> of the Borgne d’Arolla braid plain. These data have been used to test two new numerical modelling developments. The first is the application of an explicit free surface model within a Computational Fluid Dynamics framework to enable the simulation of flow in natural rivers with steep water surface slopes. The second is the development of a new, reduced-complexity Discrete Particle Model that uses the three-dimensional flow data to simulate individual particle trajectories and the Generalised Likelihood Uncertainty Estimation method to estimate the uncertainty in these trajectories. There are three main findings in this thesis. Firstly, at upland <b>confluences</b> changes in the flow direction over the less well-defined banks have the greatest impact on individual particle trajectories and thus the morphological evolution of these <b>confluences.</b> Secondly, as water surface slopes increase, topographic features have less impact on the flow field than undulations in the water surface. Finally, turbulent flow structures and helical flow cells are found to be less important for the dynamics of these upland river <b>confluences.</b> ...|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of a subterranean drainage system depends {{on the way in}} which subterranean <b>confluences</b> between different rivers can be formed. Different from surface, in which <b>confluences</b> are determined by processes related to the surface runoff of water, in subterranean karst <b>confluences</b> have a random pattern and are related to certain circumstances independent of the underground flow. These conditions are: pre-existence of circulation ways and the way they are distributed in space. At these the peculiar processes of subterranean karst flow determined by the flow under pressure, the only one that can explain the systematic appearance of <b>confluences,</b> have to be added. In function of these parameters a morphogenetic classification of subterranean <b>confluences</b> is given...|$|R
5|$|Shortly {{downstream}} of the <b>confluence</b> of Catawissa Creek with Messers Run, the pH of Catawissa Creek ranges between 4.1 and 6.2, with {{an average}} of 4.5. Further downstream, at Davis Run, the pH changes to 4.5 to 4.9, and averages 4.64. After picking up Rattling Run, Dark Run, and Little Catawissa Creek, but before picking up Tomhicken Creek, Catawissa Creek's pH ranges from 3.2 to 6.4 and averages 4.96. After the <b>confluence</b> with Tomhicken Creek, Catawissa Creek's pH ranges from 4.7 to 5.4.|$|E
5|$|The Dzong {{is located}} at the <b>confluence</b> of the Pho Chhu (father) and Mo Chhu (mother) rivers in the PunakhaWangdue valley. The source of the Mo chu river is in the {{northern}} hills of Lighsi and Laya in Bhutan, and in Tibet. The Po Chu River is fed by glaciers in the Lunana region of the Punakha valley. After the <b>confluence</b> of these two rivers, the main river is known as Puna Tsang chu or Sankosh River and flows down through Wangdue Phodrang, crosses the BhutanIndia border at Kalikhola and eventually meets the Brahmaputra River.|$|E

40|$|Stream <b>confluences</b> are {{important}} hotspots of aquatic ecological processes. Water mixing dynamics at stream <b>confluences</b> influence physio-chemical {{characteristics of the}} stream as well as sediment mobilisation and pollutant dispersal. In this study, we investigated the potential for handheld thermal infrared (TIR) imagery to provide rapid information on stream water mixing dynamics at small scales. In-situ visualisation of water mixing patterns can help reduce analytical errors related to stream water sampling locations and improve {{our understanding of how}} <b>confluences</b> and tributaries influence aquatic ecological communities. We compared TIR-inferred stream temperature distributions with water electrical conductivity and temperature (measured with a submerged probe) data from cross-channel transects. We show that the use of a portable TIR camera can enhance the visualisation of mixing dynamics taking place at stream <b>confluences,</b> identify the location of the mixing front between two different water sources and the degree of mixing. Interpretation of handheld TIR observations also provided information on how stream morphology and discharge can influence mixing dynamics in small streams. Overall, this study shows that TIR imagery is a valuable support technique for eco-hydrological investigation at small stream <b>confluences.</b> </p...|$|R

5|$|The Kootenay rises on the {{northeast}} slopes of the Beaverfoot Range of southeastern British Columbia, and flows initially southeast through the valleys of Kootenay National Park.

The river becomes significantly enlarged as it reaches the <b>confluence</b> with the Vermilion River, which is actually the larger of the two where they meet near the settlement of Kootenay Crossing. It continues southeast, receiving the Palliser River from the left, and swings southwards into a gorge at the <b>confluence</b> with the White River.|$|E
