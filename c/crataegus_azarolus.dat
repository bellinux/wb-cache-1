40|$|Objective. Plant {{cell culture}} is an {{innovative}} technology {{to produce a}} variety of substances. Numerous plants synthesize among their secondary metabolites phenolic compounds which possess antioxidant and antimicrobial effects. Hawthorn (Crataegus) {{is one of these}} plants which has long been used in folk medicine and is widely utilized in pharmaceutical preparations mainly in neuro- and cardiosedative actions. Methods and Results. The production of polyphenol by fifty-two-week-old <b>Crataegus</b> <b>azarolus</b> var. aronia calli was studied in relation to growth variation and antioxidant and antimicrobial capacity within a subcultured period. The DPPH and ABTS+ assays were used to characterize the antioxidant actions of the callus cultures. Antimicrobial activity was tested by using disc diffusion and dilution assays for the determination of the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) and the minimal bactericidal concentration (MBC) values of each active extract. High TEACDPPH, TEACABTS, and antimicrobial activity was observed when maximal growth was reached. An optimum of total phenol, proanthocyanidins, flavonoid, (−) -epicatechin, procyanidin B 2, chlorogenic acid, and hyperoside was produced during this period. Conclusion. Antioxidant and antimicrobial activities were strongly correlated with total phenols and total flavonoids. <b>Crataegus</b> <b>azarolus</b> var. aronia cells culture represents an important alternative source of natural antioxidants and antimicrobials...|$|E

Twenty one plant samples were collected from different Jordanian locations and used for antioxidant evaluation. The level of antioxidant activity was determined by DPPH and ABTS assays in relation to the total phenolic contents of the medically used parts. The most frequently used plant parts as medicines were fruit, shoot and leaves. The total phenolic contents of methanol and aqueous extracts, from plants parts, ranged from 6. 6 to 103. 0 and 3. 0 to 98. 6 GAE mg g - 1 of plant part dry weight, respectively. DPPH-TEAC of the methanol extracts of plants parts were varied from 4. 1 to 365. 0 mg g - 1 of plant dry weight versus 0. 6 to 267. 0 mg g - 1 in aqueous extracts. Moreover, the mean values of ABTS • – (IC 50) varied from 6. 9 to 400. 0 µg dry weight mL - 1 ABTS in methanol extracts versus 9. 8 to 580. 5 µg mL - 1 in aqueous extracts. According to their antioxidant capacity, the plants were divided into three categories: high (DPPH-TEAC >= 80 mg g - 1), (i. e., Punica granatum peel, Quercus calliprinos leave, Quercus calliprinos fruit, Cinchona ledgeriana and Juniperus communis leave), moderate (DPPH-TEAC range 20 - 80 mg g - 1) (i. e., Salvia fruticosa shoot, <b>Crataegus</b> <b>azarolus</b> stem, <b>Crataegus</b> <b>azarolus</b> leave, Varthemia iphionoides shoot, Artemisia herba-alba shoot, Thymus capitatus shoot, Morus nigra leaves and Arum palaestinum leaves) and low antioxidant plants (DPPH-TEAC< 20 mg g - 1), (i. e., Matricaria aurea shoot, Artemisia judaica shoot, Teucrium polium shoot, Pinus halepenss pollen grains, Sarcopoterium spinosum root, <b>Crataegus</b> <b>azarolus</b> fruit, Inula viscose shoot and Achillea fragrantissima shoot).

40|$|Background: Hawthorn species {{decreases}} {{blood pressure}} and relaxes precontracted vessels. This study aimed at examining the antihypertensive effect and related mechanisms of hydroalcoholic extract of <b>Crataegus</b> <b>azarolus</b> subspecies aronia fruit in rats with renovascular hypertension. Methods: Six groups of male Sprague-Dawley rats, each containing 6 to 8 rats, were studied. The groups comprised of one sham group and 5 renal artery-clipped groups. The sham group received vehicle (distilled water 0. 5 ml/day) and the renal artery-clipped groups received vehicle or the extract at 5, 10, 20 or 30 mg/kg/day. Oral vehicle or extract was administered daily for 4 weeks following sham-operation or induction of hypertension. Systolic {{blood pressure and}} heart rate were measured weekly. Isolated aorta study was performed by last week and serum superoxide dismutase and glutathione reductase were measured. The findings were analyzed using {{one-way analysis of variance}} and Duncan’s multiple range tests at P≤ 0. 05 using SigmaStat software. Results: The data obtained after 4 weeks of treatment showed that the renal artery-clipped group receiving vehicle had significantly higher systolic blood pressure (P= 0. 002) and phenylephrine maximal response (P= 0. 01); and lower acetylcholine maximal response (P= 0. 01), serum superoxide dismutase (P= 0. 006) and serum glutathione reductase (P= 0. 006) than those of the sham group.

40|$|A {{field survey}} {{was carried out}} to record plant species climbed by Ephedra alte {{in certain parts of}} Jordan during 2008 – 2010. Forty species of shrubs, ornamental, fruit, and forest trees {{belonging}} to 24 plant families suffered from the climbing habit of E. alte. Growth of host plants was adversely affected by E. alte growth that extended over their vegetation. In addition to its possible competition for water and nutrients, the extensive growth it forms over host species prevents photosynthesis, smothers growth and makes plants die underneath the extensive cover. However, E. alte did not climb all plant species, indicating a host preference range. Damaged fruit trees included Amygdalus communis, Citrus aurantifolia, Ficus carica, Olea europaea, Opuntia ficus-indica, and Punica granatum. Forestry species that were adversely affected included Acacia cyanophylla, Ceratonia siliqua, <b>Crataegus</b> <b>azarolus,</b> Cupressus sempervirens, Pinus halepensis, Pistacia atlantica, Pistacia palaestina, Quercus coccifera, Quercus infectoria, Retama raetam, Rhamnus palaestina, Rhus tripartita, and Zizyphus spina-christi.

Old trees still survive as sparse plants in parks and gardens, near farmhouses or in abandoned fields. Erosion of genetic variability and loss of folk knowledge are consequences of this decline. Exploration started within the EU project GENRES 29 and continued thereafter in different areas of Italy, with the aims of identification, characterization and evaluation of accessions and collection of information about traditional and present use. A good amount of variability in pomological traits and fruit composition of azarole and service tree was found in Emilia Romagna and in the southernregions of Italy. Azarole accessions were clearly differentiated by sugars and organic acid profiles. Service tree fruits revealed a high content of fructose and a decrease of organic acids and polyphenols during ripening and bletting. These changes enablethe processing into different products (cider in the unripe stage, and jams, liqueurs, schnaps in the bletted stage).
