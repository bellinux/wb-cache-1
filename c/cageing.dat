To analyze the influence of the <b>cage</b> type, we compared “closed” box titanium <b>cages</b> with “open” box titanium <b>cages.</b> This study included 40 patients with 80 implanted <b>cages.</b> After pedicle screw fixation, 23 patients were treated with a “closed box” <b>cage</b> and 17 patients with an “open box” <b>cage.</b> The follow-up period averaged 25  months. Twenty <b>cages</b> (25 %) showed a migration into one vertebral endplate of < 3  mm and four <b>cages</b> (5 %) showed a migration of ≥ 3  mm. <b>Cage</b> migration was highest in the medio-medial position (84. 6 %), followed by the postero-lateral (42. 9 %), and the postero-medial (16 %) <b>cage</b> position.

In the well understood case of two-fingered manipulators, the squeezing/stretching <b>caging</b> characterization implies that all <b>cages</b> are indeed pregrasping <b>cages</b> and, as a consequence, are useful waypoints to grasp an object.

One thousand and thirty six 25 wk old Isa Brown layers, at the beginning of laying period, were used in experiment. Two <b>cage</b> bateries which were parallel to the long axis were selected as the study material. <b>Cage</b> densities were four, and five birds per <b>cage,</b> respectively. Different egg production and egg quality parameters were measured for different hen age, <b>cage</b> position and densities for 11 weeks. Egg samples were collected from the <b>cages</b> to define the egg quality characteristics once a week. Indoor environmental conditions such as temperature and humidity were fairly affected by <b>cage</b> density (P< 0. 01). However, they did not differ among <b>cage</b> positions. Hen age had a significant effect on hen-day egg production (HDEP), feed consumption (FCS), feed conversion (FCV), and egg quality characteristics (P< 0. 01). The weekly observations showed that <b>cage</b> position and <b>cage</b> density did not have major influence on HDEP, FCS and FCV. On the other hand, HDEP and FCS were higher for four birds per <b>cage</b> on the window side. No egg quality characteristics were impacted by <b>cage</b> position and <b>cage</b> density.

One hundred ninety-two 1 -d-old non-beak-trimmed Hy-Line W- 36 White Leghorn chicks were reared using standard management practices in raised wire <b>cages.</b> At 19 wk of age, the birds were randomly assigned into battery <b>cages</b> or furnished <b>cages.</b> The battery <b>cages</b> were commercial wire <b>cages</b> containing 6 birds per <b>cage,</b> providing 645 cm 2 of floor space per birds. The furnished <b>cages</b> had wire floors and solid metal walls, with perches, a dustbathing area, scratch pads, and a nestbox area with a concealment curtain. Based on the company recommendations, 10 birds were housed per <b>cage,</b> providing a stocking den-sity of 610 cm 2 of floor space per bird. Behavioral ob-servations were conducted using the Noldus Observer software package. The birds were observed at 5 -min intervals for the entire light period. The birds housed in battery <b>cages</b> had higher posture and behavioral transi-tions and increased time spent walking and perform-ing exploratory behavior (P < 0. 05, 0. 01, respective-ly), which may indicate they were stressed, resulting in restlessness, whereas the birds housed in furnished <b>cages</b> had higher levels of preening (P < 0. 05).

40|$|In the European Union, {{conventional}} <b>cages</b> for {{laying hens}} will be faded {{out at the}} beginning of 2012. The rationale behind this is a public concern over animal welfare in egg production. As alternatives to conventional <b>cages,</b> the European Union Council Directive 1999 / 74 / EC allows non-cage systems and enriched (furnished) <b>cages.</b> Layer performance, behavior, and welfare in differently sized furnished <b>cages</b> have been investigated quite widely during recent decades, but nutrition of hens in this production system has received less attention. This thesis aims to compare production and feed intake of laying hens in furnished and conventional <b>cages</b> and to study the effects of different dietary treatments in these production systems, thus contributing to the general knowledge of furnished <b>cages</b> as an egg production system. A furnished <b>cage</b> model for 8 hens was compared with a 3 -hen conventional <b>cage.</b> Three consecutive experiments each studied one aspect of layer diet: The first experiment investigated the effects of dietary protein/energy ratio, the second dietary energy levels, and the third the effects of extra limestone supplementation. In addition, a fourth experiment evaluated the effects of perches on feed consumption and behavior of hens in furnished <b>cages.</b> The dietary treatments in experiments 1 – 3 generally had similar effects in the two <b>cage</b> types. Thus, there was no evidence supporting a change in nutrient requirements for laying hens when conventional <b>cages</b> are replaced with small-group furnished <b>cages.</b> Moreover, the results from nutritional experiments conducted in conventional <b>cages</b> can be applied to smallgroup furnished <b>cage</b> systems. These results support the view that production performance comparable with conventional <b>cages</b> can be achieved in furnished <b>cages.</b> All of the advantages of <b>cages</b> for bird welfare are sustained in the smallgroup furnished <b>cages</b> used here. In addition, frequent use of perches and nests implies a wider behavioral repertoire in furnished <b>cages</b> than in conventional <b>cages.</b> The increase observed in bone ash content may improve bird welfare in furnished <b>cages.</b> The presence of perches diminished feed consumption during the prelaying period and enhanced the feed conversion ratio during the early laying period in furnished <b>cages.</b> However, as {{the presence or absence of}} perches in furnished <b>cages</b> had no significant effect on feed consumption after the prelaying period, the lower feed consumption observed in furnished <b>cages</b> than in conventional <b>cages</b> could be attributed to other factors, such as the presence of wood shavings or a nest box. The wider feed trough space per hen in conventional than in furnished <b>cages</b> may partly explain the higher feed consumption observed in conventional <b>cages.</b> ...|$|R

The effects of field <b>cage</b> colour and supplementary shade on mating behaviour are discussed. We recommend that Q-fly field <b>cage</b> tests should be conducted in <b>cages</b> with a light coloured mesh, and that supplementary shading should only be applied if {{there is a need to}} adjust temperature and light within the <b>cage.</b> 6 page(s...|$|R
50|$|A {{barbed wire}} steel <b>cage</b> match {{is one of}} any number of matches that uses strands of barbed wire in some capacity. Simply using barbed wire in an {{otherwise}} regular steel <b>cage</b> match {{does not make the}} match a barbed wire steel <b>cage</b> match; the barbed wire must be part of the match's design. Another variations are the Razor Wire Steel <b>Cage</b> Match, a similar concept to that of the barbed wire <b>cage</b> match, however the barbed wire is replaced by razor wire and is wrapped around the top, corners, and walls of the <b>cage,</b> and Barbed wire Razor wire Steel <b>Cage</b> match {{is the same as the}} barbed wire <b>cage</b> match, however the top, corners, and walls of the <b>cage</b> are covered with barbed wire, further covered with razor wire.|$|R
40|$|AbstractA new <b>caged</b> proton, 1 -(2 -nitrophenyl) ethyl sulfate (<b>caged</b> sulfate), is {{characterized}} by infrared spectroscopy and compared with a known <b>caged,</b> proton 2 -hydroxyphenyl 1 -(2 -nitrophenyl) ethyl phosphate (<b>caged</b> HPP). In contrast to <b>caged</b> HPP, <b>caged</b> sulfate can induce large pH jumps and protonate groups that have pK values as low as 2. 2. The photolysis mechanism of <b>caged</b> sulfate is analogous to that of P 3 -[1 -(2 -nitrophenyl) ethyl] ATP (<b>caged</b> ATP), and the photolysis efficiency is similar. The utility of this new <b>caged</b> compound for biological studies was demonstrated by its ability to drive the acid-induced conformational change of metmyoglobin. This transition from the native conformation to a partially unfolded form takes place near pH 4 and was monitored by near-UV absorption spectroscopy...|$|R
40|$|By synthesizing {{derivatives}} of a trans- 1, 2 -diaminocyclohexane precursor, {{three new}} functionalized porous organic <b>cages</b> were prepared with different chemical functionalities on the <b>cage</b> periphery. The introduction of twelve methyl groups (CC 16) resulted in frustration of the <b>cage</b> packing mode, {{which more than}} doubled the surface area compared to the parent <b>cage,</b> CC 3. The analogous installation of twelve hydroxyl groups provided an imine <b>cage</b> (CC 17) that combines permanent porosity {{with the potential for}} post-synthetic modification of the <b>cage</b> exterior. Finally, the incorporation of bulky dihydroethanoanthracene groups was found to direct self-assembly towards the formation of a larger [8 + 12] <b>cage,</b> rather than the expected [4 + 6], <b>cage</b> molecule (CC 18). However, CC 18 was found to be non-porous, most likely due to <b>cage</b> collapse upon desolvation...|$|R
