50|$|NTFS can {{compress}} files using LZNT1 algorithm (a {{variant of}} LZ77) Files are compressed in 16 cluster chunks. With 4 kB clusters, files are compressed in 64 kB chunks. The compression algorithms in NTFS {{are designed to}} support cluster sizes of up to 4 kB. When the cluster size is greater than 4 kB on an NTFS volume, NTFS compression is not available. If the compression reduces 64 kB of data to 60 kB or less, NTFS treats the unneeded 4 kB pages like empty sparse file clusters—they are not written. This allows for reasonable random-access times as the OS just has to follow the chain of fragments. However, large compressible files become highly fragmented since every chunk < 64KB becomes a fragment. According to Microsoft's NTFS Development team's research, 50-60 GB is a reasonable maximum size for a compressed file on an NTFS volume with a 4 kB (default) <b>cluster</b> (<b>block)</b> size. This reasonable maximum size decreases sharply for volumes with smaller cluster sizes. Single-user systems with limited hard disk space can benefit from NTFS compression for small files, from 4 kB to 64 kB or more, depending on compressibility. Files smaller than approximately 900 bytes are stored within the directory entry at the MFT.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Advances in {{wireless}} {{networks and}} positioning technologies (e. g., GPS) have enabled new data management applications that monitor moving objects. In such new applications, realtime data analysis such as clustering analysis is {{becoming one of}} the most important requirements. In this paper, we present the problem of clustering moving objects in spatial networks and propose a unified framework to address this problem. Due to the innate feature of continuously changing positions of moving objects, the clustering results dynamically change. By exploiting the unique features of road networks, our framework first introduces a notion of <b>cluster</b> <b>block</b> (CB) as the underlying clustering unit. We then divide the clustering process into the continuous maintenance of CBs and periodical construction of clusters with different criteria based on CBs. The algorithms for efficiently maintaining and organizing the CBs to construct clusters are proposed. Extensive experimental results show that our clustering framework achieves high efficiency for clustering moving objects in real road networks...|$|E

40|$|We {{propose a}} novel method for {{multiple}} clustering that assumes a co-clustering structure (partitions in both rows and columns {{of the data}} matrix) in each view.

We simultaneously model different distribution families, such as Gaussian, Poisson, and multinomial distributions in each <b>cluster</b> <b>block.</b> This makes our method applicable to datasets consisting of both numerical and categorical variables, which biomedical data typically do. Clustering solutions are based on variational inference with mean field approximation. We apply the proposed method to synthetic and real data, and show that our method outperforms other multiple clustering methods both in recovering true cluster structures and in computation time.

Our method is based on nonparametric Bayesian mixture models in which features are automatically partitioned (into views) for each clustering solution.

To make our method applicable to high-dimensional data, a co-clustering structure is newly introduced for each view.

40|$|Apart {{from the}} main content blocks, almost all web pages on the Internet contain such blocks as navigation, {{copyright}} information, privacy notices, and advertisements, which {{are not related to}} the topic of the web page. We call these blocks noisy blocks, and call the main content blocks informative blocks. The information contained in the noisy blocks can seriously harm Web mining and searching. So discriminating informative blocks from the noisy blocks and then extracting the information contained in the informative blocks is an important task. In this paper, we propose a method that utilizes both the visual features and semantic information to extract topic information. We first partition a web page into semantic blocks using improved vision-based page segmentation. The visual and the semantic information are extracted to form the feature-vector of the block. Secondly the blocks with similar content structures and spatial structures are clustered by means of similarity computation. After <b>clustering</b> <b>blocks</b> with similar structures, our algorithm identifies informative <b>clusters.</b> The <b>blocks</b> contained in the <b>cluster</b> are informative <b>blocks.</b> Finally we show that a kNN classifier, taking into account the proposed method, clearly outperforms the same classifier using extract informative block arithmetic...|$|R

Since machines in general have three degrees of freedom of lateral motion, good science and logic suggest that data from all three axes will provide more information, if we can analyze it properly. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to demonstrate the improved diagnostic capability provided by collecting triaxial data compared to single axis radial data mixed with some axial data. The three orthogonal axes are designated axial, radial and tangential. As indicated by the term, The axial is the direction in line with, or parallel to, the shaft. Radial and tangential are the two perpendicular axes in the plane of rotation. Generally, radial is vertical for a horizontal machine while tangential is in the transverse direction. For a vertical machine, radial and tangential are both horizontal axes such that radial is toward the center of the shaft and tangential is as the name implies.

40|$|During {{the past}} few decades, meat has {{increasingly}} become a subject of controversies relating to health and safety, environment, and animal welfare. Even though these changes in perceptions of meat are not yet visible in aggregate consumption figures, they {{can be observed in}} individual consumption patterns and as intentions to change the consumption. In this study, we examine changes in meat consumption among the Finnish consumers taking into account both stated changes in the past and intended changes in the future. Based on these changes, we identify consumer segments and investigate in which ways these segments differ from each other socio-demographically and with respect to current meat consumption and the stated reasons for the change. The latent class analysis based on representative Internet survey data revealed nine consumer clusters that formed three cluster blocks. The results showed {{that a large number of}} people, over 40 %, had stabile consumption patterns. A <b>cluster</b> <b>block</b> of 14 % of consumers had already shifted their consumer patterns to contain more vegetables and less meat. One third of the consumers were identified to be in the middle of the change with a general tendency to decrease the use of meat and increase the use of vegetables.

40|$|We are {{investigating}} membrane-based sorting processes in polarized epithelial MDCK cells, which most likely involves membrane microdomains. We have postulated that proteins contained in these microdomains, cluster, {{and to prove}} this, we have internalized differently fluorophore labeled pIgA-R ligands in MDCK cells, stably transfected with polymeric IgA receptors (pIgA-R), from opposite plasma membranes. Our previous work showed that these receptor-ligand complexes colocalize in the apical recycling endosome (ARE), underneath the apical plasma membrane. Quantitative one-photon confocal and 2 -photon (2 -P) FRET microscopy allowed us to calculate energy transfer efficiency (E%). Unquenched donor levels where established based on a novel algorithm, which corrects the FRET contamination of acceptor bleed-through and donor crosstalk. Using different emission filters also confirmed the veracity of the algorithm. 2 -P FRET allows {{the selection of a}} specific donor wavelength, which does not precipitate acceptor bleed-through, a clear advantage over 1 -P confocal microscopy. Results show that E% is independent of acceptor levels, an indication of a clustered distribution, as in random distribution E% rises with increasing acceptor levels. However, E% decreases with increasing donor and donor:acceptor ratio levels, which we have termed donor geometric exclusion, where some donors in a <b>cluster</b> <b>block</b> others from interacting with an acceptor. We submit that this is a second indicator for a clustered pattern, because in a random, dispersed situation donors {{are not likely to be}} in close proximity to have such an effect.

40|$|We {{introduce}} the K-way Thermal Chip Clustering (KT 2 C) algorithm; a VLSI chip partitioning algorithm {{that is used}} to reduce the chip’s temperature and prevent the formation of hotspots. The clustering algorithm is integrated in the design flow between the stages of binding and floor-planning. KT 2 C uses power and area information from a component library to identify the components that will most probably result in hotspots. These components are labeled as thermal centers which then form independent clusters. The rest of the components are distributed among these clusters with the goal of reducing the center's temperature. The algorithm then iterates attempting to produce a uniform temperature distribution among clusters while reducing wire-length. Upon convergence, the components undergo two stages of floor-planning. At the intra-cluster floor-planning stage, the positions of the components inside each cluster are determined, whereas in the inter-cluster floor-planning stage the position of each <b>cluster</b> <b>block</b> on the chip is determined. The temperature profile of the resulting chip is calculated using the thermal simulator “Hotspot” and is compared to the temperature profile of a design achieved using a regular design flow. The results show significant reduction in both average and peak temperatures at the cost of a small increase in area. Furthermore, when optimizing for wire-length, KT 2 C produced a remarkable reduction in total wire-length which surpassed the reduction achieved by the non-clustering solution. Finally, a parallel design of the KT 2 C design flow was proposed and the conducted timing analysis showed that large speedups could be achieved if parallelism was implemented.
