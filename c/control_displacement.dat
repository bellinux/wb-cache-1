50|$|For most helicopters, it {{is usually}} not {{necessary}} to determine the lateral CG for normal flight instruction and passenger flights. This is because helicopter cabins are relatively narrow and most optional equipment is located near the center line. However, some helicopter manuals specify the seat from which solo flight must be conducted. In addition, {{if there is an}} unusual situation, such as a heavy pilot and a full load of fuel {{on one side of the}} helicopter, which could affect the lateral CG, its position should be checked against the CG envelope.

The reason lies in the electrostatic adsorption reaction between the cationic gel particle and the anion residual polymer on the rock surface, which larges the grain diameter of cationic gel particle.

40|$|A solid-type {{piezoelectric}} actuator {{generates a}} large force, but the generated displacement is significantly small. In particular, the actuator {{has a large}} hysteresis between a control voltage and the <b>control</b> <b>displacement.</b> Hence {{the application of the}} actuator has been limited to some special areas. This paper presents a linear piezoelectric actuator without hysteresis. The actuator presented has linearization control circuits and a displacement enlargement mechanism made of elastic hinges, so that the generated displacement is in the range of displacements required for vibration control of machines. To control the actuator, a displacement sensor is used in general, but one of the ends of the sensor must be fixed to a wall. This implies that the application of the actuator is limited. Hence in this paper, an acceleration sensor is used instead of the displacement sensor. This enables us to use the actuator as a conventional linear actuator.

A biomechanical study assessed {{the effect of the}} position of the bone-block with its attached conjoint tendon on anterior and inferior stabilization of the humeral head. Materials and methodsThe Bristow-Latarjet procedure was performed on 8 fresh cadaveric shoulders. The bone-block size was systematically at 2. 5 × 1 × 1 cm. Anterior translation of the humeral head was stress induced under 30 -N traction, in maximum external rotation at 0 ° and at 90 ° abduction: respectively, adduction and external rotation (ADER), and abduction and external rotation (ABER). Under radiological <b>control,</b> <b>displacement</b> of the center of the humeral head was compared with the glenoid surface at the 3, 4 and 5 o’clock (medial, antero-inferior and inferior) positions for the 2 bone-block positionings. ResultsThe lying position at 4 o’clock substantially decreased anterior and inferior displacement of the humeral head respectively in ADER and ABER; and in ABER it also tended to decrease anterior translation, but not significantly. The standing bone-block position did not affect translation. ConclusionsPositioning the bone-block so that it lies on the anterior aspect of the glenoid {{in the middle of the}} antero-inferior quarter of the rim at 4 o’clock can decrease anterior displacement of the humeral head and inferior glenohumeral translation, especially in ADER for anterior displacement and in ABER for inferior displacement.

Methods: An aortic model was constructed from a 22 -mm-diameter Plexiglas tube with 6 -mm polytetrafluoroethylene inlays to mimic the renal arteries. Six tantalum markers {{were placed in the}} wall of the aortic tube proximal to the renal arteries. Another 6 markers were added to a Gianturco stent, which was cast in Plexiglas and placed inside the aorta and fixed to a micromanipulator to precisely <b>control</b> <b>displacement</b> of the stent along the longitudinal axis. Sixteen migrations were analyzed with RSA software and compared to the micromanipulator. Thirty-two migrations were measured by 3 observers from CT images acquired with 16 × 0. 5 -mm beam collimation and reconstructed with a 0. 5 -mm slice thickness and a 0. 4 -mm reconstruc-tion interval. Measurements were made with Vitrea postprocessing software using a standard clinical protocol and central lumen line reconstruction. Results of CT were also compared to the micromanipulator. Results: The mean RSA measurement error compared to the micromanipulator was 0. 002 ± 0. 044 mm, and the maximum error was 0. 10 mm. There was no statistically significant interobserver variability for CT (p= 0. 17). The pooled mean (maximum) measurement error of CT was 0. 14 ± 0. 29 (1. 00) mm, which was significantly different from the RSA measurement error (p< 0. 0001).

40|$|In {{the past}} decades, base {{isolation}} techniques {{have become increasingly}} popular for seismic protection of civil structures owing to its capability of decoupling buildings from harmful ground motion. However, it has been recognised recently the traditional passive base isolation technique could encounter a serious problem during earthquakes due its incapability in adjusting the isolation frequency {{to cope with the}} unpredictability and diversity of earthquakes. To address this challenge, a great deal of research efforts have been conducted to improve traditional base isolation systems, most of which focused on hybrid supplementary devices (passive, active and semi-active types) for the isolators to <b>control</b> <b>displacement</b> or to dissipate seismic energy. On the other hand, the most effective approach to address the aforementioned challenge should lay on varying isolator stiffness in real-time to achieve real-time spontaneous decoupling. A recent advance of the development of an adaptive magneto-rheological elastomer (MRE) base isolator has brought such idea to reality as the new MRE base isolator is capable to alter its stiffness significantly in real-time. In this paper, an innovative smart base isolation system employing such MRE isolator is proposed and a novel frequency control algorithm is developed to shift the fundamental frequency of the structure away from the dominant frequency range of earthquakes. Such design enables the building to avoid resonant state in real-time according to the on-coming spectrum of the earthquakes. Extensive simulation has been conducted using a 5 -storey benchmark model with the isolation system and testing results indicate that the proposed control system is able to significantly suppress both the floor accelerations and inter-storey drifts simultaneously under different earthquakes...|$|E

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this paper is to fit Coffin-Manson {{equation}} of Sn- 4. 0 Ag- 0. 5 Cu lead free solder joint by using results of solders joint reliability test and finite element analysis. Also to present a novel device for solder joint reliability test. Design/methodology/approach: Two-points bending test of Sn- 4. 0 Ag- 0. 5 Cu lead free solder joint was carried out at three deflection levels by using a special bending tester that can <b>control</b> <b>displacement</b> exactly by a cam system. The failure criterion was defined as resistance of solder joint getting 10 percent increase. The X-section was done for all failure samples to observe crack initiation and propagation in solder joint. Finite element analysis was presented with ANSYS for obtaining shear strain range, analyzing distribution of stress and strain and supporting experimental results. Findings: The experimental results indicate that the fatigue life decreased obviously with the displacement increased. By using optical microscope and SEM photographs, two kinds of failure mode were found in solder joint. The majority failure mode took place at the bottom corner of solder joint under the termination of resistor initially, and propagated into the solder matrix. Another failure mode was delamination. It appeared at the interface between the termination of resistor and its ceramic body. The distribution status of stress and strain in solder joint and the calculation results of shear strain range at different deflection levels were obtained from simulation result. The Coffin-Manson equation of Sn- 4. 0 Ag- 0. 5 Cu lead free solder joint was fitted by combining experimental data with result of finite element analysis.

40|$|Abstract: Sellers {{and buyers}} of illicit goods and {{services}} (e. g., drugs, sex, stolen merchandise, stolen and illegal firearms) must find ways of meeting each other and making exchanges {{in order to get}} the rewards they seek. However, they also risk having their money or illicit goods stolen by others or being apprehended by the police. There are two strategies that participants in illicit markets can use to balance risks and rewards. First, they can sell only to people they know or to people who know people they know. This substantially reduces the risk of being arrested or ripped-off, but it restricts sales and buying opportunities. Second, they can sell to strangers. For the seller, this approach provides access to more customers. For the buyer, this approach allows shopping. Nevertheless, it increases participants ' risks of arrest and rip-off. The two strategies to marketing illicit {{goods and services}} result in very different geographical patterns of retail marketplaces, the types of places used and the relationship of illicit retailing to licit routine activities. The general model of the geography of illicit retail market places explains these two strategies and why they give rise to very different results.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the main features}} of a six-degree-of-freedom (6 DOF) flight simulation laboratory operated by the authors at the University of Naples. The aim of the flight simulator is twofold: serving as a research tool for model characterization and for the investigation of flying qualities of very-light and ultra-light aircraft; and offering a training options to the pilots of such airplanes. For these reasons the simulator cockpit has been conceived and set up as a generic cabin of a general aviation aircraft. The software suite that guides the various components {{of the system is}} based mainly on the features of FlightGear, an open-source flight simulation software. The simulation of aircraft motion, the cockpit instrument panel and flight controls, the outside scenery are all managed by a number of instances of FlightGear. All FlightGear instances are appropriately executed on different machines and communicate with each other via net protocols. Simulations are also supported by two other software modules. The first one controls the 6 DOF motion of the cockpit. The second module implements a force reproduction system on the cockpit controls. An overview of all these modules is given in the paper, along with the discussion of the advantages and potentialities given by the source code accessibility and the high configurability of FlightGear. The force feedback model is particularly important to the purposes that this flight simulation facility has being designed for. To obtain an enhanced realism in piloting efforts, particular care has been taken to implement hinge moment equations in the simulation software. The result is a reliable closed-loop force-feedback system on all aircraft commands. Two useful and noteworthy generalizations have been implemented in this context: the effect of the mechanical linkage dynamics on the control surface motion and the effects on the <b>control</b> <b>displacement</b> due to the mechanical friction and to the presence of springs. The geometric, mass, inertia characteristics of each control surface and the hinge moment coefficients are managed by the control loading software.

40|$|This PHD {{project has}} been based on 100 % studio practice; the {{original}} title for the research programme was Between Reality and Fiction and aimed at exploring the construction of reality and truth in our society, a society strictly controlled by the mass media. Whilst developing the first project within this body of research - Isolation (an attempt to contrast a real life experience of a visit to a prison with existing institutional information obtained through second and third hand sources - readings, media, films [...] .), a range of other more pertinent concepts arose, causing a shift from those initial ideas to ones incorporating <b>control,</b> <b>displacement</b> and space, understanding this, not only as a physical entity, but also as a socio-political construction. Based on the different projects that form the basis of my research, I explored the concept of control and how that is exercised on individuals in free/democratic societies- from spatial control (access/no access), economical, cultural (oneself/others), medical/technological, or media control (the creation of public opinion). This research attempts to question/reflect public awareness of these control measures, in order to assess their limitations, whilst investigating any existing gaps in the system which could potentially subvert it. What has been particularly relevant has been the exploration of issues relating to space, understood not only as a physical entity, but also as a socio-political construction, how space is organised, divided and controlled in an era of globalisation, and whether, or why access to certain ‘spaces’ is either severely restricted or completely denied. Work developed during the PhD has consisted of: Practical studio research (mainly installations, video and photography), site specific visits/trips relevant to particular themes within the project (HMP Winchester, Strait of Gibraltar, Canary Islands, container depots, airports [...] .); related readings; compilation of explicit news reportage; and the construction of an extensive archive that includes all printed and digital matter tracking the entire research process and its methodology.

40|$|Accurate {{quantification}} of defects (scratches and impacts) {{is vital}} to the certification of flight hardware and other critical components. The amount of damage to a particular component contributes to the performance, reliability, and safety of a system, which ultimately affects {{the success or failure of}} a mission or test. The launch-commit criteria on a Space Shuttle Orbiter window are governed by the depth of the defects that are identified by a visual inspection. This measurement of a defect is not easy to obtain given the environment, size of the defect, and location of the window(s). The determination of depth has typically been performed by taking a mold impression and measuring the impression with an optical profiling instrument. Another method of obtaining an estimate of the depth is by using a refocus microscope. To use a refocus microscope, the surface of the glass and bottom of the defect are, in turn, brought into focus by the operator. The amount of movement between the two points corresponds to the depth of the defect. The refocus microscope requires a skilled operator and has been proven to be unreliable when used on Orbiter windows. White light interferometry was chosen as a candidate to replace the refocus microscope. The White Light Interferometer (WLI) was developed to replace the refocus microscope as the instrument used for measuring the depth of defects in Orbiter windows. The WLI consists of a broadband illumination source, interferometer, detector, motion <b>control,</b> <b>displacement</b> sensor, mechanical housing, and support electronics. The illumination source for the WLI is typically a visible light emitting diode (LED) or a near-infrared superluminescent diode (SLD) with power levels of less than a milliwatt. The interferometer is a Michelson configuration consisting of a 1 -in. (2. 5 -cm) cube beam splitter, a 0. 5 -in. (1. 3 -cm) optical window as a movable leg (used to closely match the return intensity of the fixed leg from the window), and a mirrored prism to fold the optics into the mechanical housing. The detector may be one of many C-mount CCD (charge-coupled device) cameras. Motion is provided by a commercial nanostepping motor with a serial interface. The displacement sensor is a custom device specifically designed for this application. The mechanical housing and support electronics were designed to integrate the various components into an instrument that could be physically handled by a technician and easily transported...|$|E

40|$|Models of {{universal}} quantum computation {{in which the}} required interactions between register (computational) qubits are mediated by some ancillary system are highly relevant to experimental realisations of a quantum computer. We introduce such a universal model that employs a $d$-dimensional ancillary qudit. The ancilla-register interactions {{take the form of}} <b>controlled</b> <b>displacements</b> operators, with a displacement operator defined on the periodic and discrete lattice phase space of a qudit. We show that these interactions can implement controlled phase gates on the register by utilising geometric phases that are created when closed loops are traversed in this phase space. The extra degrees of freedom of the ancilla can be harnessed {{to reduce the number of}} operations required for certain gate sequences. In particular, we see that the computational advantages of the quantum bus (qubus) architecture, which employs a field-mode ancilla, are also applicable to this model. We then explore an alternative ancilla-mediated model which employs a spin-ensemble as the ancillary system and again the interactions with the register qubits are via <b>controlled</b> <b>displacement</b> operators, with a displacement operator defined on the Bloch sphere phase space of the spin coherent states of the ensemble. We discuss the computational advantages of this model and its relationship with the qubus architecture. Comment: Minor typos and errors correcte...|$|R
