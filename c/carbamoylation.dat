Hydroxylation of C-6 in the structure occurs by VioQ, N-acylation of α-amino group using β-lysine, VioO, and VioM, and <b>carbamoylation</b> of the β-amino group, producing β-ureidoalanine (β-Uda) by the carbamoyltransferase homologue VioL.|$|E

50|$|Geldanamycin was {{originally}} {{discovered in the}} organism Streptomyces hygroscopicus. It is a macrocyclic polyketide that is synthesized by a Type I polyketide synthase. The genes gelA, gelB, and gelC encode for the polyketide synthase. The PKS is first loaded with 3-amino-5-hydroxybenzoic acid (AHBA). It then utilizes malonyl-CoA, methylmalonyl-CoA, and methoxymalonyl-CoA to synthesize the precursor molecule Progeldanamycin. This precursor is subjected to several enzymatic and non-enzymatic tailoring steps to produce the active molecule Geldanamycin, which include hydroxylation, o-methylation, <b>carbamoylation,</b> and oxidation.|$|E
40|$|Protein <b>carbamoylation</b> is a non-enzymatic post-translational {{modification}} that binds isocyanic acid, {{which can be}} derived from the dissociation of urea or from the myeloperoxidase-mediated catabolism of thiocyanate, to the free amino groups of a multitude of proteins. Although the term 'carbamoylation' is usually replaced by the term "carbamylation" in the literature, carbamylation refers to a different chemical reaction (the reversible interaction of CO 2 with α and ε-amino groups of proteins). Depending on the altered molecule (for example, collagen, erythropoietin, haemoglobin, low-density lipoprotein or high-density lipoprotein), <b>carbamoylation</b> can have different pathophysiological effects. Carbamoylated proteins have been linked to atherosclerosis, lipid metabolism, immune system dysfunction (such as inhibition of the classical complement pathway, inhibition of complement-dependent rituximab cytotoxicity, reduced oxidative neutrophil burst, and the formation of anti-carbamoylated protein antibodies) and renal fibrosis. In this Review, we discuss the <b>carbamoylation</b> process and evaluate the available biomarkers of <b>carbamoylation</b> (for example, homocitrulline, the percentage of carbamoylated albumin, carbamoylated haemoglobin, and carbamoylated low-density lipoprotein). We also discuss the relationship between <b>carbamoylation</b> and the occurrence of cardiovascular events and mortality in patients with chronic kidney disease and assess the effects of strategies to lower the <b>carbamoylation</b> load...|$|E
30|$|The <b>carbamoylation</b> {{reaction}} of various aliphatic amines and aniline with dimethyl carbonate was investigated {{and the study}} of the activity of five catalysts in the described process presented. The <b>carbamoylation</b> of linear primary aliphatic amines occurred with relatively high yields while non-linear primary aliphatic amines and secondary aliphatic amines are less active in reaction with DMC.|$|E
40|$|The <b>carbamoylation</b> {{reaction}} of poly-L-lysine(PLL) {{and its influence}} on the helix-coil transition of the product polymer were studied. The rate constant decreased with increasingconcentrations of PLL and cyanate ions. At lower concentrations, the rate constants were in agreement with theoretical values obtained by the Bronsted theory and Manning's theory on polyelectrolytes. The free energy, enthalpy and entropy of activation of the reaction at 40 °C were 18. 4 Kcal/mol, 0. 2 Kcal/mol and — 58 e. u., respectively. From the ORD measurements the <b>carbamoylation</b> raised the helix content (fH) at lower pH and lowered fH at higher pH. This tendency was accounted for in termsof two factors: The charge neutralization by the <b>carbamoylation,</b> which may facilitate the helix formation at lower pH and the steric hindrance effect of introduced carbamoyl groups which destroys partly the orderliness of the molecule. The viscosity-pH profile was {{in accord with the}} interpretation. Finally, the denaturation of proteins was suggested to be at least partly due to <b>carbamoylation</b> of amino groups...|$|E
40|$|The {{characteristics}} of the <b>carbamoylation</b> of pig brain tubulin were examined by using the modification conditions with cyanate described previously [Mellado, Slebe + Maccioni (1980) Biochem. Int. I, 584 [...] 590]. The <b>carbamoylation</b> reaction resulted in an inhibition of microtubule assembly, which was dependent on the concentration of the modifying agent. This tubulin modification appears to inhibit the growth of microtubules. The presence of GTP did not protect tubulin against this inhibition. Electron microscopy showed a marked {{decrease in the number}} of tubules after <b>carbamoylation,</b> but no alterations were observed in the microtubule morphology. The incorporation of KN 14 CO into alpha- and beta-subunits with similar kinetics was also shown, and the carbamoylated residues were identified as epsilon-N-carbamoyl-lysine residues...|$|E
40|$|<b>Carbamoylation</b> of {{amino acids}} and {{proteins}} in uremia. Cyanate spontaneously transformed from urea increases as renal function decreased. Acting {{as a potential}} toxin, the active form of cyanate, isocyanic acid, carbamoylates amino acids, proteins, and other molecules, changing their structure, charge, and function. The resulting in vivo <b>carbamoylation</b> can modify the molecular activity of enzymes, cofactors, hormones, low-density lipoproteins, antibodies, receptors, and transport proteins. Antibodies specific for ε-amino-carbamoyl-lysine (homocitrulline) located carbamoylated proteins in situ in neutrophils, monocytes, and erythrocytes. Carbamoylated proteins were found in renal tissue from uremic patients but not in normal transplanted kidneys. The irreversible reaction with cyanate converts free amino acids (F-AAs) to carbamoyl-amino acids (C-AAs). The <b>Carbamoylation</b> Index (CI), C-AA/F-AA, quantifies the decrease of the F-AA pool for each essential amino acid. C-AAs contribute, in part, to malnutrition of uremia. C-AAs interfered with protein synthesis to lower 14 C hemoglobin synthesis in human reticulocytes and osteocalcin synthesis in rat osteosarcoma-derived tissue culture. Insulin-sensitive glucose uptake was decreased 33 % in cultured rat adipocytes by α-amino-carbamoyl-asparagine. ε-Amino <b>carbamoylation</b> occurs primarily in F-AA, while e-amino <b>carbamoylation</b> of lysine in protein occurs continuously during the protein life span. Protein catabolism releases ε-amino-carbamoyl-lysine. Quantitation of α versus ε <b>carbamoylation</b> may yield a more sensitive measurement of protein intake versus protein catabolism, and could be useful in decisions concerning the time to initiate dialysis or subsequent changes in dialysis prescription. Carbamoylated molecules can block, enhance, or be excluded from metabolic pathways, thereby influencing the fate of noncarbamoylated molecules. Although not an “all-or-none” phenomenon, urea-derived cyanate and its actions are contributing causes of toxicity in uremia...|$|E
40|$|One {{possible}} {{route to}} cataract formation may be via the <b>carbamoylation</b> of lens proteins {{due to increased}} concentrations of cyanate in the body resulting from uraemia associated with renal failure and with severe diarrhoea. <b>Carbamoylation</b> of gamma-II-crystallin, which {{is found in the}} lens core, could alter the surface charge network of the molecules, resulting in aggregation, increased light-scattering and hence cataract. We have attempted to locate the site(s) of <b>carbamoylation</b> in gamma-II-crystallin. gamma-II-Crystallin was isolated by gel chromatography and ion-exchange chromatography. gamma-II-Crystallin was then carbamoylated by incubation with potassium [14 C]cyanate, followed by citraconylation and digestion with trypsin to give peptides that were separated by high-resolution ion-exchange chromatography. The amino acid compositions of the radioactive peptides were compared with the expected peptide composition for gamma-II-crystallin. The radioactive peptide compositions, which agreed with the theoretical peptides, all matched with the N-terminal region of gamma-II-crystallin and had in common the presence of the N-terminal glycine residue. It appears that the alpha-amino group of the N-terminal glycine was the main site of <b>carbamoylation.</b> This site forms part of the charge network on the surface of gamma-II-crystallin...|$|E
30|$|The <b>carbamoylation</b> {{reaction}} [Eq.(1)] {{has recently}} attracted considerable attention {{because it provides}} a non-phosgene route to N-alkyl carbamate [8]. Dimethyl carbonate (DMC) is a safe, clean and green carbamoylating agent with lower negative environmental impact [9 - 11]. However, the described reaction requires a suitable catalyst to promote the specific process at acceptable conversion rate and with satisfactory selectivity to carbamates. Many catalytic systems {{have been developed for}} <b>carbamoylation</b> of amines with DMC. These include enzymes [12], ionic liquids [13, 14], organic bases [15] and metal derivatives [16 - 22].|$|E

However, few examples of <b>carbamoylation</b> of aniline in continuous-flow apparatus have been reported. In this work, we report a high-yielding, dimethyl carbonate (DMC) -mediated <b>carbamoylation</b> of aniline in a fixed-bed continuously fed reactor employing basic zinc carbonate as catalyst.

40|$|SummaryCarbamoylation {{is one of}} the post-PKS {{modifications}} in ansamitocin biosynthesis. A novel ansamitocinoside with carbamoyl substitution at the C- 4 hydroxyl group of the N-β-D-glucosyl moiety was identified from the ansamitocin producer, Actinosynnema pretiosum. Through biotransformation, the carbamoyltransferase gene asm 21 was suggested to be responsible for the <b>carbamoylation</b> of the glucosyl moiety. Three new derivatives without the backbone carbamoyl group were isolated from an asm 21 mutant and characterized by NMR spectroscopy. Among them, 18 -O-methyl- 19 -chloroproansamitocin was the major product and the preferred substrate for macrolactam C- 7 <b>carbamoylation</b> by Asm 21. However, Asm 21 exhibited higher catalytic efficiency toward the glucosyl moiety. Furthermore, the dual carbamoylations and N-glycosylation were precisely demonstrated in vivo.

40|$|A {{series of}} bis-[(m-hydroxyphenyl) trimethylammonium iodide] esters of polymethylenedicarbamic acids {{and a number}} of (m-hydroxyphenyl) trimethylammonium iodide esters of {{straight-chain}} N-alkylcarbamic acids have been examined as inhibitors of acetylcholinesterase from fly head. Evidence is presented suggesting that inhibition of acetylcholinesterase by the bis-carbamates is due to <b>carbamoylation</b> of the enzyme, as is generally thought to be the case with esters of N-alkylcarbamic acids. Inhibition is irreversible. The (m-hydroxyphenyl) trimethylammonium iodide ester of N-hexylcarbamic acid also inhibits fly head acetylcholinesterase irreversibly. There is therefore no need to implicate a second functional group in bis-carbamate esters to explain the irreversible inhibition of the enzyme. An unusual feature of the inhibition is that inhibition lines do not pass through 100 % enzyme activity at t= 0, except for rather low concentrations of inhibitor (< 10 μm for the octamethylene compound). Also, inhibition lines tend towards a maximum slope as inhibitor concentration is increased. The first observation indicates complex-formation, even in the presence of high concentrations of substrate, and by using measurements of inhibition at relatively high inhibitor concentrations, affinity constants K′a have been calculated. K′a varies from 0. 1 μm for the dodecamethylene compound to 10 μm for the tetramethylene compound, in the presence of 3. 75 mm-acetylthiocholine, indicating high affinity for the enzyme. The second observation shows that, owing to this high affinity, the enzyme becomes saturated with inhibitor under the experimental conditions employed, and from the limiting slope values of the <b>carbamoylation</b> rate constant (k 2) have been calculated. k 2 varies from 0. 15 min− 1 for the tetramethylene compound to 1 min− 1 for the decamethylene compound. Variations of potency in this series are therefore mainly due to changes in affinity (100 -fold) rather than in <b>carbamoylation</b> rate (sevenfold).

40|$|The pseudo-reverse {{reaction}} of Pseudomonas aeruginosa catabolic ornithine carbamoyltransferase in which arsenate is first coupled to citrulline followed by elimination of carbamylarsenate has been studied. Arsenate and citrulline saturation curves are sigmoidal. The different responsiveness of the transcarbamoylase to isosteric and allosteric ligands was examined {{both in the}} forward reaction, the <b>carbamoylation</b> of ornithine, and in the pseudo-reverse reaction, the arsenolytic cleavage of citrulline. Nucleoside monophosphates and polyamines that act as allosteric activators and inhibitors, respectively, on the <b>carbamoylation</b> reaction {{have the same effect}} on the rate of the arsenolytic cleavage of citrulline. ATP and other nucleoside triphosphates were found to stimulate enzyme activity at low carbamoylphosphate concentration with little influence on the carbamoylphosphate concentration at half-maximum velocity {{as well as on the}} cooperative index. When measuring the initial rate of the reverse reaction, the arsenolytic cleavage of citrulline, ATP was found to be a weak inhibitor, whereas CTP still stimulates the reaction and UTP was without influence. This unidirectional inhibition or activation phenomenon is likely apparent since initial studies were conducted and no consideration was given to equilibrium conditions. Regulation of catabolic OTCase by nucleoside triphosphates is without physiological meaning. In contrast, stimulation by nucleoside monophosphates may indicate that energy limitation could promote the synthesis and activity of the catabolic enzyme.
