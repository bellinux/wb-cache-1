6000|$|It {{was best}} {{presented}} perhaps by the distinguished doctor {{who wrote the}} article on these matters in that <b>composite</b> <b>book</b> which Mr. Wells edited, and called [...] "The Great State." [...] He said the doctor should {{no longer be a}} mere plasterer of paltry maladies, but should be, in his own words, [...] "the health adviser of the community." [...] The same can be expressed with even more point and simplicity in the proverb that prevention is better than cure. Commenting on this, I said that it amounted to treating all people who are well as if they were ill. This the writer admitted to be true, only adding that everyone is ill. To which I rejoin that if everyone is ill the health adviser is ill too, and therefore cannot know how to cure that minimum of illness. This is the fundamental fallacy in the whole business of preventive medicine. Prevention is not better than cure. Cutting off a man's head is not better than curing his headache; it is not even better than failing to cure it. And it is the same if a man is in revolt, even a morbid revolt. Taking the heart out of him by slavery is not better than leaving the heart in him, even if you leave it a broken heart. Prevention is not only not better than cure; prevention is even worse than disease. Prevention means being an invalid for life, with the extra exasperation of being quite well. I will ask God, but certainly not man, to prevent me in all my doings. But the decisive and discussable form of this is well summed up in that phrase about the health adviser of society. I am sure that those who speak thus have something in their minds larger and more illuminating than the other two propositions we have considered. They do not mean that all citizens should decide, which would mean merely the present vague and dubious balance. They do not mean that all medical men should decide, which would mean a much more unbalanced balance. They mean that a few men might be found who had a consistent scheme and vision of a healthy nation, as Napoleon had a consistent scheme and vision of an army. It is cold anarchy to say that all men are to meddle in all men's marriages. It is cold anarchy to say that any doctor may seize and segregate anyone he likes. But it is not anarchy to say that a few great hygienists might enclose or limit the life of all citizens, as nurses do with a family of children. It is not anarchy, it is tyranny; but tyranny is a workable thing. When we ask by what process such men could be certainly chosen, we are back again on the old dilemma of despotism, which means a man, or democracy which means men, or aristocracy which means favouritism. But as a vision the thing is plausible and even rational. It is rational, and it is wrong.|$|E
40|$|The paper {{argues in}} favor of {{creative}} methodologies as tool for relevant academic praxis. It provides the analysis of a concrete {{case in which a}} non-academic text - a <b>composite</b> <b>book</b> made of a participant’s introduction, an ethnographic novel, 21 graphic illustrations and a political essay - allowed for a meaningful re-appropriation of a fieldwork with homeless people in Italy. Such re-appropriation is understood and theorized as a research-activist 'mode of existence', namely as a way to use creative methodologies to pursue active and emancipatory engagement with vulnerable groups. The paper analyses this 'mode of existence' as a process made of several 'translations', or orientation toward the same interests, and it clearly shows the role of non-human agencies in their unfolding. Through its more-than-human narrative, the paper provided an innovative contribution to debates on research-activism and a new reflection on how to engage meaningfully with vulnerable groups. The conclusion highlights areas of improvement to further strengthen the activist-research mode of existence presented in the paper...|$|E
40|$|Universities of the Third Age (U 3 A) serve a {{specific}} {{task in the}} area of education or if you like life-study. They are adherent to universities and open to wider public and its educational needs. They provide general, special-interest and non-professional education on university level. The history of an establishment of education of senior people in programs of the University of the Third Age in the Czech Republic starts in 1980 s. The first University of the Third Age was established at the Palacky University in Olomouc in 1987, other two at the Charles University in Prague and at the Faculty of Medicine in Pilsner. In 1992 U 3 A was established at the University of South Bohemia in České Budějovice. The University of South Bohemia has been offering 33 educational programs, modules and courses to 1125 senior people. It provides them with the opportunity of further education, learning and use, it gives chance to implement interests, opens possibilities of new contacts, including intergenerational ones. The Bachelors Thesis presents a draft history of the University of the Third Age at the University of South Bohemia in České Budějovice in the period from 1992 to 2010. The Thesis specifies priorities of development in the time of implementation of comprehensive educational programs, interprets results of an assessment of attendants of the selected educational programs implemented in the academic year of 2009 / 2010. The offer of educational programs, modules and courses for the academic year 2009 / 2010 it documents in an appendix. The Bachelors Thesis and its results are available to students, research workers {{in the area of}} education of later age people as well as specialists community.

40|$|The thesis {{deals with}} {{the crisis in the}} public {{broadcaster}} - Czech television during the years 2000 and 2001, when the employees of the TV refused to cooperate with a newly elected director Jiří Hodač. The main question the thesis deals with is the interpretation of the crisis. Are there any alternative explanations of the crisis and its causes - different from those still being accepted today? Therefore it also discusses the possibility of the crisis being prepared by Čtyřkoalice or even by the employees of the TV. Comparing & contrasting the statements of the crisis actors the thesis shows that there is no simple interpretation. The thesis illuminates the roles of particular bodies that are important for the TV operation, it also analyses the news services of both antagonized teams and explains the role of particular actors during the crisis.

5000|$|Since 1980s Ksenevich {{has been}} {{collecting}} rare and miniature books. He owns {{one of the}} most interesting collections of miniature books in Belarus. These are books of the early 19th century, pocket-sized, containing most ¬variable subjects, including those published in different languages in Belarus and many other countries all over the world: <b>composite</b> <b>books</b> containing works of classics of Belarusian, Russian and world poetry, selected prose, reference books and encyclopedias, researches in the branch of history and art history, comic editions and children's books, books of the Bible and Christian literature, as well as cook, chess and philosophy books. Evgeny Ksenevich considers a miniature book to be a high-water mark of printing art. Publishing of such books requires delicate cooperation of highly professional artists, print workers, designers. In the interview he pointed out the following: [...] "miniature books are a trademark of the country's printing industry. And Belarus is famous for its books. First books were published pocket-sized in Minsk in 1833. And this tradition has existed ever since: many publishing houses issue wonderful miniature books, which win awards at international competitions". Evgeny Ksenevich more than once organized exhibitions of miniature books from his collection. The most significant exhibitions are: Exhibition in the Petrus Brovka State Literary Museum (2009); exhibition of miniature books in the State Museum of the History of Belarusian Literature, commemorating the 520th birthday of Francisk Skorina (2010).|$|R
40|$|In {{my paper}} I propose to analyse the recent trend in {{contemporary}} fiction of producing composite or fragmented texts {{in order to}} join together the perspectives, stories and lives of different, previously or ostensibly unrelated, individuals. Books of this kind are, for instance, David Mitchell’s Cloud Atlas (2004), Rachel Cusk’s Arlington Park (2006), Colum McCann’s Let the Great World Spin (2009), Ali Smith’s There but for the (2011), Zadie Smith’s NW (2012), Donal Ryan’s, The Spinning Heart (2013), and Simon Van Booij, The Illusion of Separateness (2013). I {{will look at the}} different ways these contemporary texts have been approached by critics and the different labels they have received – networked novel, short story cycle, novel-in-stories – and the different perspectives these labels imply. I will make a case for recognizing the influence of the short story on these composite works and argue that they deserve to be considered {{within the context of the}} tradition of the short story cycle. I will also investigate whether it’s useful to make a firm distinction between the short story composite and composite novel in the case of these texts and whether they can indeed be distinguished in terms of the different poetics they operate: a poetics of collection vs. a poetics of diffraction (cf. René Audet 2013). Finally, I will focus on the thematic import of these fragmented or <b>composite</b> <b>books</b> and, in particular, on the question of human connection and community which these texts raise. This contemporary concern will also be placed in the context of the short story cycle’s particular aptitude for representing community, as witnessed by many late-nineteenth- andstatus: publishe...|$|R
