40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the influence of alumina increase on the functioning of <b>casting</b> <b>powder</b> during continuous casting. Two aspects of the powder's performance were experimentally measured, namely the influence of alumina on the viscosity and the crystallisation behaviour. These two aspects were then related to the in-mould functioning of the <b>casting</b> <b>powder</b> with the aid of literature references. Casting slag must provide lubrication between the mould surface and the thin steel shell. Alumina increase will cause viscosity increase in casting slags and will hinder lubrication when the inflow of casting slag into the mould/strand gap deteriorates. Heat transfer across the gap is determined by the amount of solid casting slag and the form (glass or crystalline) thereof. Heat transfer across a crystalline material may be up to seven times lower than that across a glass phase. The increased alumina will serve to increase the ratio of glassy phase to crystalline phase in the gap, so increasing the heat transfer. To determine the true extent of alumina increase with modern clean steel practice, samples were taken from the moulds of both the VI and V 2 continuous casters at ISCOR Vanderbijlpark. The influence of this alumina increase on the viscosity and the crystallisation behaviour of the casting slag were experimentally measured. Viscosity measurements were done with a rotating bob viscometer (in a vertical tube furnace) on two commercial casting powders (with increasing AI 2 O 3 content). Viscosity prediction models were evaluated with the data from the measured viscosity values. Crystallisation measurements were done by quench experiments with the aid of the hot thermocouple technique. Crystallisation behaviour after a specified heat cycle was presented as the percentage opaque material (crystalline) to vitreous material (glassy) measured with an optical microscope. For the seven sequence casts during which samples were collected from the mould, it was found that the alumina content of the casting slag reached a steady-state value within the first ladle (first 40 minutes) with an increase of 3 to 4 mass %. The influence of a 4 mass % alumina increase on the measured viscosity is small enough that proper lubrication function of the slag will not be negatively affected. Viscosity prediction models vary in their accuracy and are limited with respect to the composition range of the <b>casting</b> <b>powder</b> and the temperature range for which they are valid. The increased alumina content was found to have a strong influence on the percentage crystalline material present. After the sample was heated to 1300 °C, kept there for 10 s, and then quenched, the crystalline material will decrease from 60 % to 30 % for 5 mass % alumina added. This decreased crystalline material present may notably increase heat transfer. Full crystallisation does not occur at a single temperature, and crystallisation occurs over a temperature interval (of up to 200 °C). This means that crystallisation temperature values quoted by <b>casting</b> <b>powder</b> manufacturers depend on the heat cycle and the technique used during crystallisation measurements. Several crystalline phases are usually present in solidified casting slag and these crystalline phases are strongly influenced by the alumina content: the stable crystalline phases may change as alumina content increases. For the current alumina increase in casting powders the effect on viscosity is small, while crystallisation behaviour may be influenced to a greater extent.

The {{effects of}} high energy milling on tin bronze with the {{composition}} Cu- 24. 6 wtSn {{have been examined}} using hardness testing, optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy and x-ray diffraction. High energy milling has caused mechanical alloying of an elemental copper and tin powder blend, and mechanical milling of a <b>cast</b> <b>powder</b> and a melt quenched powder. Nanocrystalline grains with a size between 5 nm and 50 nm have been directly observed in the final milled powder. The powder consist of the a phase and 8 phase and is partially amorphous. An extension of the solid solution solubility has also been detected due to milling. The formation of the metastable tin-rich 11 phase has been observed in the intermediate stage of mechanical alloying of the elemental powder blend due to the higher diffusivity of tin in copper over copper in tin. The formation of the 11 phase during mechanical alloying of tin bronze with the composition Cu- 24. 6 wtSn has not been reported before. The morphological development of the three initial powders has proceeded by different mechanisms during milling due to the different hardness and toughness of the starting powders. Milling of the elemental powder blend and the <b>cast</b> <b>powder</b> proceeds via classic mechanisms for milling of ductile powders and brittle powders respectively, while milling of the tougher melt quenched powder proceeds via {{a combination of the}} two mechanisms. An attempt to process the milled powder into a bulk state using various thermomechanical techniques while still retaining a nanocrystalline grain size has not succeeded. The high diffusivity of the material at elevated temperatures has led to grain growth into the micrometer range even at relatively low thermo-mechanical processing temperatures.

Emphasize have been on understanding the types of inclusions formed and developed through the casting process and {{on the development of}} already existing inclusions carried over from the ladle during casting. Industrial experiments carried on at Uddeholm Tooling together with laboratory work and Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations. Ingots of 5. 8 tons have been sampled and the types of inclusions together with their distribution within the ingot have been characterized. Two new types of inclusions have been found. Type C 1 is found originated from <b>casting</b> <b>powder</b> and in the size from a few μm to 30 μm. Type C 2 is of macro inclusion type sizing up to 70 μm. The presence of C 2 inclusions are few but very detrimental for the quality of the steel. Both types, C 1 and C 2 consist of alumina, indicating that reoxidation is the main reason for their existence. The protecting argon shroud has been studied by the use of a 1 : 1 scaled 2 D model. Both flow pattern and oxygen measurement have been carried out. CFD has also been used as an auxiliary tool. It has been found that the oxygen pickup through argon gas shroud depends mostly on the distance between the ladle and the collar placed on top of runner. Further increase of gas flow rate above 2. 5 m 3. h- 1 had very little effect on the oxygen distribution since both the flushing effect and the entraining effect with respect to oxygen are enhanced by further increase of inert gas flow rate. In the case of dual gas inlet, the flow in the shroud was found much less diffused compared with either vertical or horizontal injection system. The oxygen content in this arrangement was also greatly reduced. Studies of the runner after casting revealed a sparse non-metallic network structure around the periphery of the steel rod remained in the runner. The surface of the refractory had been severely attacked by the mechanical force from the streaming steel. The erosions of the centre stone and the end stone were on the other hand negligible. CFD calculations showed that the flow at those locations is almost stagnant. The surface of the refractory in contact with the steel was found to have an increased content of alumina. The source for the alumina could come from either exchange reaction of dissolved aluminium replaces the silica or reoxidation products origin from oxygen pick up during the transfer from the ladle to the vertical runner. Inclusions were also found entrapped in the steel refractory interface. It was also found that a formation of a liquid slag film as early as possible during casting would increase the possibility to remove inclusions and especially inclusions generated by the <b>casting</b> <b>powder.</b> QC 2010061...|$|E

In this work the influence of the carbon content in the steel on the interfacial tension was studied. For this purpose a steel with 0. 411 % of mass fraction of carbon and a steel with 2. 64 % of carbon were used.

The main objective {{of this paper is to}} estimate the damping ratio of aluminium manufactured through powder metallurgy (P/M) process and compare it with the commercially available <b>Cast</b> aluminium. Aluminium <b>powder</b> is compacted, sintered and then it is extruded to the required geometry. Cantilever beams of required size and shape are prepared for experimental purpose and the damping ratio is investigated. Damping ratio is determined by sweep sine test using half power bandwidth method. Free vibration tests also confirmed the damping ratios obtained by sweep sine method. It is observed that damping ratio is higher for sintered aluminium than cast aluminium which may be attributed to increased porosity...|$|R
