The use of ground based stations make this system more accurate than satellite based GPS systems.|$|E
5000|$|The European grid is a proposed, {{multipurpose}} Pan-European mapping standard. [...] It {{is based}} on the ETRS89 Lambert Azimuthal Equal-Area projection <b>coordinate</b> <b>reference</b> <b>system,</b> with the centre of the projection at the point 52o N, 10o E and false easting: x0 = 4321000 m, false northing: y0 = 3210000 m (CRS identifier in Inspire: ETRS89-LAEA).|$|E
5000|$|The default <b>coordinate</b> <b>reference</b> <b>system</b> (CRS) used is the World Geodetic System 1984 (WGS-84), for planet Earth {{although}} other CRS, once defined, may be specified, using the [...] "crs" [...] URI parameter, also {{separated by a}} semicolon.

GeoRSS-Simple {{is a very}} lightweight format that supports basic geometries (point, line, box, polygon) and covers the typical use cases when encoding locations.

Some of them were unspecified in oldest WKT 1 specifications (for example the [...] unit), which has led to different interpretations by different software. Those units of measurement have been clarified in the 2001 update and the WKT 2 specification is consistent with that clarification. But not all software have followed the 2001 clarification.|$|R
