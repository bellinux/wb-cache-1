However, marketers need to be alert to <b>channel</b> <b>switching</b> because of its potential to erode market share. Evidence of <b>channel</b> <b>switching</b> can suggest that disruptive forces are at play, and that consumer behaviour is undergoing fundamental changes. A consumer may be prompted to switch channels when the product or service can be found cheaper, when superior models become available, when a wider range is offered, or simply {{because it is more}} convenient to shop through a different channel (e.g. online or one-stop shopping). As a hedge against market share losses due to switching behaviour, some retailers engage in multi-channel retailing.|$|E

25|$|Channel-switching (not to be {{confused}} with zapping or channel surfing on TV) is the action of consumers switching to a different purchasing environment (or distribution channel) to purchase goods, such as switching from brick-and-mortar stores to online catalogues, or the internet. A number of factors have led to an increase in <b>channel</b> <b>switching</b> behaviour; the growth of e-commerce, the globalization of markets, the advent of Category killers (such as Officeworks and Kids 'R Us) as well as changes in the legal/ statutory environment. For instance, in Australia and New Zealand, following a relaxation of laws prohibiting supermarkets from selling therapeutic goods, consumers are gradually switching away from pharmacies and towards supermarkets for the purchase of minor analgesics, cough and cold preparations and complementary medicines such as vitamins and herbal remedies.|$|E
30|$|<b>Channel</b> <b>Switch</b> Overhead: When an SU adjusts his access {{strategy}} and <b>switches</b> to other <b>channels,</b> it is unavoidable for the <b>channel</b> <b>switch</b> {{to result in}} extra system overhead, such as rendezvous, synchronization, etc. When designing the spectrum sensing and access scheme with the overhead consideration, {{it is necessary to}} reduce as many times of <b>channel</b> <b>switch</b> as possible.|$|R

2500|$|Around {{the same}} time as the release of the JVM, Marshall also {{released}} an amp called the Vintage Modern, which is designed to be much simpler, with a single channel and designed to be controlled more by the player's style and guitar than by <b>channel</b> <b>switching</b> or multiple settings, reminiscent of the vintage [...] "Plexi" [...] and JCM800 range, but with modern conveniences such as foot-switchable dynamic ranges (distortion levels), effects loop and reverb. The Vintage Modern series consists of the 2466 100-watt head and 2266 50-watt head with matching combos and a matching cabinet loaded with G12C 25-watt Greenbacks. The Vintage Modern is the first Marshall since the late 1960s to be powered by KT66s, a European version of the 6L6 tube.|$|E

40|$|Wireless {{mesh network}} the <b>channel</b> <b>switch</b> is not {{triggered}} even with overloaded data traffic and the link quality decreases significantly as the channel is overloaded. When the link capacity is under-estimated, the link is under-utilized. Moreover, when link traffic load increases {{from time to}} time, <b>channel</b> <b>switch</b> occurs frequently. Such frequent <b>channel</b> <b>switches</b> increase latency and degrade throughput, and can even cause network wide channel oscillations. In this paper, we propose a novel threshold-based control system, called balanced control system (BCS). The proposed threshold-based control policy consists of deciding, according to the real time traffic load and interference, whether to <b>switch</b> to another <b>channel,</b> which <b>channel</b> should be <b>switched</b> to and how to perform the switch. Our control model {{is based on a}} fuzzy logic control. The threshold which assists to make the <b>channel</b> <b>switch</b> decisions, could be deduced dynamically according to the real-time traffic of each node. We also design a novel dynamic channel assignment scheme,which is used for the selection of the new <b>channel.</b> The <b>channel</b> <b>switch</b> scheduler is provided to perform channel-switch processing for sender and receiver over enhanced routing protocols. We implement our system in NS 2, and the simulation results show that with our proposed system, the performance improves by 12. 3 %– 72. 8 % in throughput and reduces 23. 2 %– 52. 3 % in latency. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.
