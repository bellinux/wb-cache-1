25|$|Greek cuisine is {{characteristic}} of the healthy Mediterranean diet, which is epitomized by dishes of Crete. Greek cuisine incorporates fresh ingredients {{into a variety of}} local dishes such as moussaka, pastitsio, classic Greek salad, fasolada, spanakopita and souvlaki. Some dishes {{can be traced back to}} ancient Greece like skordalia (a thick purée of walnuts, almonds, crushed garlic and olive oil), lentil soup, retsina (white or rosé wine sealed with pine resin) and pasteli (<b>candy</b> <b>bar</b> with sesame seeds baked with honey). Throughout Greece people often enjoy eating from small dishes such as meze with various dips such as tzatziki, grilled octopus and small fish, feta cheese, dolmades (rice, currants and pine kernels wrapped in vine leaves), various pulses, olives and cheese. Olive oil is added to almost every dish.|$|E
25|$|In 1945, the {{specific}} heating {{effect of a}} high-power microwave beam was accidentally discovered by Percy Spencer, an American self-taught engineer from Howland, Maine. Employed by Raytheon at the time, he noticed that microwaves from an active radar set {{he was working on}} started to melt a <b>candy</b> <b>bar</b> he had in his pocket. The first food deliberately cooked with Spencer's microwave was popcorn, and the second was an egg, which exploded in the face of one of the experimenters. To verify his finding, Spencer created a high density electromagnetic field by feeding microwave power from a magnetron into a metal box from which it had no way to escape. When food was placed in the box with the microwave energy, the temperature of the food rose rapidly. On 8 October 1945, Raytheon filed a United States patent application for Spencer's microwave cooking process, and an oven that heated food using microwave energy from a magnetron was soon placed in a Boston restaurant for testing.|$|E

25|$|Shortly {{after the}} rabbit starred {{in a series}} of twenty-six black and white {{animated}} silent shorts between 1927 and 1928, he became the first Disney character to successfully sell merchandise: a chocolate-covered marshmallow <b>candy</b> <b>bar,</b> a stencil set, and a pin-backed button. However, Disney lost the rights to Oswald shortly thereafter and the production of merchandise was put to a halt. Not long before Disney regained the rights to Oswald, Universal started marketing the character actively overseas. Disney slowly reintroduced him with merchandise such as shirts, figurines and a DVD of his original cartoons. In 2004 and 2005, shortly before the return of the character to Disney and still in Universal's hands, Oswald products became popular in Japan, and were primarily made available as prizes in UFO catchers and as official merchandise in Universal Studios Japan, where he was featured as part of the Woody Woodpecker cast of characters line-up. Typically manufactured by Taito and/or Medicom, these products included puppets, inflatable dolls, keyrings, and watches. They were generally based on a navy-blue version with yellow shorts of the original Disney/Iwerks character, and due to Disney's popularity in Japan, he was marketed as a Walt Disney creation. Oswald made his first Disneyland appearance at Tokyo Disneyland on March 31, 2010 as an Easter float. At the Magic Kingdom in Walt Disney World, a poster of Oswald can be seen at the Town Square Theater where Mickey Mouse is available for meet and greets. Also inside Mickey's meeting area, a doodle of Oswald and Mickey can be seen. Clothing products are also available at Disneyland Paris in Walt Disney Studios Park. As of October 4, 2017, Oswald now has a Service Station at Disney California Adventure that sells Oswald merchandise including Oswald ears, shirts, coats, mugs and key-chains.|$|E

500|$|One {{long-term}} {{survivor of}} the craze over Ruth may be the Baby Ruth <b>candy</b> <b>bar.</b> The original company to market the confectionery, the Curtis Candy Company, maintained that the bar was named after Ruth Cleveland, daughter of former president Grover Cleveland. [...] She died in 1904 and the bar was first marketed in 1921, {{at the height of}} the craze over the slugger. The slugger later sought to market candy bearing his name; he was refused a trademark because of the Baby Ruth bar. Corporate files from 1921 are no longer extant; the brand has changed hands several times and is now owned by the Nestlé company. The Ruth estate licensed his likeness for use in an advertising campaign for Baby Ruth in 1995. Due to a marketing arrangement, in 2005, the Baby Ruth bar became the official <b>candy</b> <b>bar</b> of Major League Baseball.|$|E

500|$|The Seven Up Bar was a <b>candy</b> <b>bar</b> {{comprising}} {{seven different}} chocolate [...] "pillows", each {{filled with a}} different flavor.

The ad was ninth in the USA Today ad survey, and according to a Masterfoods publicist, not intended to harm anyone.|$|E

5000|$|Bings {{were sold}} singly until the 1960s, when a second bar was added, likely in 1969, {{according}} to Marty Palmer. As {{the cost of}} ingredients rose, candy companies initially reduced the sizes of their <b>candy</b> <b>bars,</b> then later increased the price, formerly a nickel, to a dime. With the higher price, the Palmer Company decided to {{increase the size of}} Bing <b>candy</b> <b>bars.</b> However, a larger single Bing would have been problematic in vending machines, because of the <b>candy</b> <b>bar's</b> unusual shape. Palmer said of the name change and additional Bing, [...] "Some clever person here, I don't know who, {{came up with the idea}} you could put two together and make it a twin", and that the name change was [...] "natural". The altered name also had an effect of increasing interest.|$|R
