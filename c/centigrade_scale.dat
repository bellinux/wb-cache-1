500|$|When, in 1948 the CGPM {{was charged}} with {{producing}} a coherent system of units of measure, definitions relating to temperature had to be clarified. At the 9th CGPM, the <b>centigrade</b> temperature <b>scale</b> was renamed the Celsius temperature scale and the scale itself was fixed by defining the triple point of water as 0.01°C, though the CGPM left the formal definition of absolute zero until the 10th CGPM when the name [...] "Kelvin" [...] {{was assigned to the}} absolute temperature scale and triple point of water was defined as being 273.16°K.

25|$|Temperature is a {{physical}} quantity expressing the subjective perceptions of hot and cold. Temperature is measured with a thermometer, historically calibrated in various temperature scales and units of measurement. The most commonly used scales are the Celsius scale, denoted in °C (informally, degrees <b>centigrade),</b> the Fahrenheit <b>scale</b> (°F), and the Kelvin scale. The kelvin (K) is the unit of temperature in the International System of Units (SI), in which temperature {{is one of the}} seven fundamental base units.|$|R
50|$|Olof Celsius's nephew Anders Celsius was an {{astronomer}} who invented a temperature scale where 100 represented the freezing point {{of water and}} 0 represented the boiling point.

5000|$|Celsius was {{the first}} to perform and publish careful {{experiments}} aiming at the definition of an international temperature scale on scientific grounds. In his Swedish paper [...] "Observations of two persistent degrees on a thermometer" [...] he reports on experiments to check that the freezing point is independent of latitude (and of atmospheric pressure). He determined the dependence of the boiling of water with atmospheric pressure which was accurate even by modern-day standards. He further gave a rule for the determination of the boiling point if the barometric pressure deviates from a certain standard pressure. He proposed the Celsius temperature scale in a paper to the Royal Society of Sciences in Uppsala, the oldest Swedish scientific society, founded in 1710. His thermometer was calibrated with a value of 100° for the freezing point of water and 0° for the boiling point. In 1745, a year after Celsius death, the scale was reversed by Carl Linnaeus to facilitate more practical measurement. Celsius originally called his <b>scale</b> <b>centigrade</b> derived from the Latin for [...] "hundred steps". For years it was simply referred to as the Swedish thermometer.Celsius conducted many geographical measurements for the Swedish General map, and was one of earliest to note that much of Scandinavia is slowly rising above sea level, a continuous process which has been occurring since the melting of the ice from the latest ice age. However, he wrongly posed the notion that the water was evaporating.|$|R
50|$|Prominent Dutch mathematician, {{astronomer}} and physicist Christiaan Huygens {{created a}} clinical thermometer in 1665, {{to which he}} added an early form of the <b>centigrade</b> <b>scale</b> by setting the scale to the freezing and boiling points of water. By 1742 Swedish astronomer Anders Celsius created the Celsius temperature scale that was the reverse of the modern scale, in that 0 was the boiling point of water, while 100 was freezing. It would later be reversed by Swedish botanist Carolus Linnaeus (1707-1778) in 1744.|$|E
5000|$|... 1744: Coincident {{with the}} death of Anders Celsius, the famous {{botanist}} Carl Linnaeus (1707-1778) effectively reversed Celsius's scale upon receipt of his first thermometer featuring a scale where zero represented the melting point of ice and 100 represented water's boiling point. The custom-made linnaeus-thermometer, for use in his greenhouses, was made by Daniel Ekström, Sweden's leading maker of scientific instruments at the time. For the next 204 years, the scientific and thermometry communities worldwide referred to this scale as the <b>centigrade</b> <b>scale.</b> Temperatures on the <b>centigrade</b> <b>scale</b> were often reported simply as degrees or, when greater specificity was desired, degrees centigrade.

50|$|The Celsius scale, {{also known}} as the <b>centigrade</b> <b>scale,</b> is an SI scale and unit of {{measurement}} for temperature. As an SI derived unit, it is used by most countries in the world. It is named after the Swedish astronomer Anders Celsius (1701-1744), who developed a similar temperature scale. The degree Celsius (symbol: °C) can refer to a specific temperature on the Celsius scale as well as a unit to indicate a temperature interval, a difference between two temperatures or an uncertainty. Before being renamed to honour Anders Celsius in 1948, the unit was called centigrade, from the Latin centum, which means 100, and gradus, which means steps.|$|E
