2500|$|Flashback {{sequences}} {{became an}} important element in two episodes this season, [...] "Lineage" [...] and [...] "Suspect". Greg Beeman, who directed [...] "Lineage", worked off the same inspiration as Ken Biller, who used John Sayles’ Lone Star when writing the flashback sequences for the episode. Beeman tried to visually shift from the present to past without any effects shots; this included changing night to day in the same shot, and removing/inserting actors from shots when they were out of the view of the camera. In his directorial debut, Ken Biller was met with the challenge of creating flashbacks for all the scenes that retold the event of the attack on Lionel. Biller had already seen Beeman’s take on flashback scenes from his work on [...] "Lineage", but Biller wanted to do something different. Alongside director of photography Glen Winter, Biller opted to shoot all the flashback sequences on 16mm <b>color</b> <b>reversal</b> <b>film,</b> which would give the flashbacks a [...] "grainy, dirty look" [...] that Biller thought gave an interesting quality to the flashback scenes.|$|E

5000|$|ChromogenicChromogenic dye color {{processes}} include Type [...] "R" [...] {{and process}} RA-4 (also known as [...] "type C prints"), process C-41 color negatives. and process E-6 <b>color</b> <b>reversal</b> (Ektachrome) <b>film.</b> Chromogenic processes yield organic dyes {{that are less}} stable than silver, and can also leave unreacted dye couplers behind during developing. Both factors may lead to color changes over time. The three dyes (cyan, magenta, and yellow) which make up the print may fade at different rates, causing a color shift in the print. Modern chromogenic papers such as Kodak Endura have achieved excellent stability, however, and are rated for 100 years in home display.|$|R
5000|$|Cinematographer Shawn Maurer shot Black Dynamite on Super 16 <b>Color</b> <b>Reversal</b> Kodak <b>film</b> {{stock to}} get the high {{contrast}} and saturated look common in many low-budget Blaxploitation films of the 1970s. [...] The film was then converted to digital for editing. The filmmakers supplemented their shoot with period stock footage from Sony Pictures Stock Footage, using films such as Missing in Action, Charlie's Angels, and Police Woman. [...] Black Dynamite {{was shot in the}} Leimert Park and Angeles Vista sections of Los Angeles over twenty days, with several green-screen days and one reshoot day. The film had such a low budget that they had to [...] "think in the same ways that they had to think" [...] in the classic blaxploitation movies. Sanders and White had a difficult time keeping the modern world out of the movie. Sanders was worried about anything modern that could destroy [...] "the whole illusion."

5000|$|Ektachrome, {{initially}} {{developed in}} the early 1940s, allowed professionals and amateurs alike to process their own films.

50|$|The Zone System {{can be used}} {{in digital}} {{photography}} just as in film photography; Adams (1981, xiii) himself anticipated the digital image. As with <b>color</b> <b>reversal</b> <b>film,</b> the normal procedure is to expose for the highlights and process for the shadows.|$|E
50|$|The {{introduction}} of Kodachrome <b>color</b> <b>reversal</b> <b>film</b> for 16 mm in 1935, and for 8 mm in 1936, facilitated home color cinematography. The availability of reversal film, both black-and-white and Kodachrome, {{was very important}} to the economics of home movie-making because it avoided the expense of separate negatives and positive prints.|$|E
50|$|This process became {{especially}} important for {{the new generation of}} high detective quantum efficiency, fine-grained (but slow) plates Eastman Kodak had developed in the late 1960s. In 1974, researchers at Eastman Kodak announced that plates treated in pure hydrogen after nitrogen treatment were more sensitive at all exposure times than untreated plates, and this was quickly adopted by many observatories, some of whom used non-explosive forming gas (a 4-8% mixture of hydrogen in nitrogen) for reasons of safety. The optimum gas-phase processes combine the effects of heating and de-gassing with reduction sensitization by pure hydrogen to give a sensitivity gain of about 30 times for an hour-long exposure. This worked very well with fine-grain, high resolution emulsions on film, typified by Eastman Kodak's Tech Pan Film. They were also effective with negative and <b>reversal</b> <b>color</b> <b>film,</b> but were unpredictable and could produce difficult-to-correct shifts in color balance.|$|R

This study presents a method for revealing the presence of interimage effects in a <b>reversal</b> <b>film</b> 2 ̆ 7 s Modulation Transfer Function. Utilizing filtering techniques, two dyes of a three color transparency are eliminated from the final image by exposure and development. The remaining single dye image at a specified level is then compared to the corresponding layer and image in a colorimetrically specified neutral. The edge gradient analysis method is used to calculate the Modulation Transfer Functions. MTF results indicate the desirability of using colorimetry for the specification of a visual neutral. MTF values are indicative of a significant effect on the Modulation Transfer Function by interimage effects...|$|R
50|$|Exposure autobracketing is most {{commonly}} used with <b>color</b> <b>reversal</b> <b>film</b> (slide film) because of its small exposure latitude compared with print film (which has a wide exposure latitude) and digital cameras (which enable the photographer to review the captured image).In digital photography, autobracketing is convenient to shoot pictures for high dynamic range imaging.|$|E
