The British government believed that a more efficient <b>customs</b> system was necessary because many colonial American merchants had been smuggling. Smugglers violated the Navigation Acts by trading with ports outside of the British Empire and avoiding import taxes.

5|$|In contrast, in Fong Thin Choo, the High Court {{expressed}} {{the view that}} under regulation 12(6) of the <b>Customs</b> Regulations 1979, the fact that goods had not been exported from Singapore was a precedent fact to the <b>customs</b> officer's power to require {{the owner of the}} goods to pay <b>customs</b> duty.

40|$|International audienceThe application-specific {{instruction}} set processors (ASIPs) have received {{more and more}} attention in recent years. ASIPs make trade-offs between flexibility and performance by extending the base {{instruction set}} of a general-purpose processor with <b>custom</b> functional units (CFUs). <b>Custom</b> instructions, executed on CFUs, {{make it possible to}} improve performance and achieve flexibility for extensible processors. The <b>custom</b> instruction synthesis flow involves two essential issues: <b>custom</b> instruction enumeration (subgraph enumeration) and <b>custom</b> instruction selection (subgraph selection). However, both enumerating all possible <b>custom</b> instructions of a given data-flow graph and selecting the most profitable <b>custom</b> instructions from the enumerated <b>custom</b> instructions are computationally difficult problems. In this paper, we propose efficient algorithms for <b>custom</b> instruction enumeration and <b>custom</b> instruction selection. Compared with previously proposed well-known enumeration algorithms, our approach can achieve a significant speedup while generating the identical set of all possible <b>custom</b> instructions or only connected <b>custom</b> instructions. Experimental results also show that a code size reduction rate up to 76 % can be achieved for a set of computational intensive programs, and the speed-up achieved is up to 8. 2 ×...|$|R
5|$|The commissioners of the <b>Customs</b> Board {{found that}} {{they were unable to}} enforce trade {{regulations}} in Boston, so they requested military assistance.

The situation exploded on June 10, when <b>customs</b> officials seized the Liberty, a sloop owned by John Hancock—a leading critic of the <b>Customs</b> Board—for alleged <b>customs</b> violations. Sailors and marines came ashore from the Romney to tow away the Liberty, and a riot broke out. Things calmed down in the following days, but fearful <b>customs</b> officials packed up their families and fled for protection to the Romney and eventually to Castle William, an island fort in the harbor.|$|E
