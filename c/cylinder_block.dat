25|$|The {{most common}} type is an {{electric}} heating element in the <b>cylinder</b> <b>block,</b> connected through a power cord often routed through the vehicle's grille. The block heater may replace one of the engine's core plugs. In this fashion, the heater element is immersed in the engine's coolant, which then keeps most of the engine warm. This type of heater does not come with a pump. They may also be installed in line {{with one of the}} radiator or heater hoses. Some heaters pump and circulate the engine coolant while heating, others only heat the still coolant in the reservoir.|$|E
25|$|Pre-cooling {{air before}} {{it enters the}} cylinders, {{injection}} of any substance other than air and fuel into the cylinders, variable-geometry intake and exhaust systems, and variable valve timing were forbidden. Each cylinder could have only one fuel injector and a single plug spark ignition. Separate starting devices were used to start engines in the pits and on the grid. The crankcase and <b>cylinder</b> <b>block</b> {{had to be made}} of cast or wrought aluminium alloys. The crankshaft and camshafts had to be made from an iron alloy, pistons from an aluminium alloy and valves from alloys based on iron, nickel, cobalt or titanium. These restrictions were in place to reduce development costs on the engines.|$|E
25|$|When introduced, the block-mounted {{oil filter}} check valve was {{eliminated}} on the 4.0 (along with the 2.5 and 4.2s manufactured after September 1986) when AMC engineers standardized their oil filters. The pre-1987 engines had an oil filter adapter with 3/4 (<b>cylinder</b> <b>block</b> end) and 13/16 threads (which used a GM oil filter common to Buick, Oldsmobile, Pontiac, and Cadillac V8 engines) while the 1987-06 engines were originally {{fitted with a}} 20mm metric thread filter (later revised in 1991 for the common 3/4 threaded Mopar and Ford V8 oil filter; the oil filter adapter was redesigned where the oil filter is positioned 90 degrees offset adjacent to the starter motor - a Ford V8 oil filter {{can be used in}} place of the short filter increasing oiling capacity).|$|E

25|$|The PT Cruiser GT (also {{known as}} the GT Cruiser) is a high output {{turbocharged}} hot hatch variant of the PT Cruiser introduced as a 2003 model. Much like the Dodge Neon SRT-4 sedan, the PT Cruiser GT uses the same 2.4L turbocharged I4 engine. The engine is upgraded over the standard PT with improved cooling, oiling, an aluminum <b>cylinder</b> <b>block</b> with steel sleeves, and forged internals. The PT Cruiser GT is much {{more powerful than the}} standard model and has the potential to make significantly more power with available and relatively simple performance upgrades. Upgrades such as MOPAR Stage 1 and supporting turbo components are common. Most performance parts from the Dodge Neon SRT-4 are compatible with the PT Cruiser GT.|$|E
25|$|The M-34 began {{development}} in 1928 {{as a replacement}} for the Mikulin M-17, a license-built copy of the BMW VI. It had similar dimensions and attachment points, but was otherwise an entirely new design. It was a direct-drive, block-type engine with the <b>cylinder</b> <b>block</b> connected by long internal studs with centrally coupled articulated connecting rods. The development of the engine process was prolonged, with the engineering drawings not completed until April 1931. The first engine was delivered to TsIAM (Tsentralniy Institut Aviatsionnogo Motorostroeniya, Russian: Центральный Институт Авиационного Моторостроения) on 21 September 1931 for bench testing with imported carburetors and magnetos. It began state testing in November 1931, but failed. It was submitted again a year later with Soviet-designed K-34 carburetors, but was again rejected. It was resubmitted in January 1933, but again failed. It was flight-tested in a Tupolev TB-3 in October 1933.|$|E
25|$|Holmes Foundry, Ltd. – AMC's block-casting foundry {{was a major}} AMC factory {{which is}} now {{completely}} obliterated. Holmes had its main office and foundry at 200 Exmouth Street, Sarnia, Ontario, Canada. Holmes was established in 1918, by Mr. J. S. Blunt, and was called Holmes Blunt Limited. In the early years, Ford Motor Company contracted the plant for {{a steady supply of}} engine casting blocks. This factory had a reputation locally as a dirty, dangerous place to work. The company had three divisions, all operating on one site at the edge of Sarnia. Beginning in 1962, AMC contracted with Holmes Foundry to supply AMC with <b>cylinder</b> <b>block</b> castings. American Motors acquired 25% interest in the foundry in January 1966. In July 1970, AMC acquired 100% of Holmes Foundry through an exchange of shares, making it a wholly owned subsidiary. However, it was not until October 1981 that Holmes Foundry finally became a Division of American Motors, Canada. As part of its acquisition of AMC in 1987, Chrysler Corporation took ownership of the Holmes facility and its manufacturing business, but closed the operation on September 16, 1988. The industrial facilities were cleaned of their environmental contaminants in 2005, in preparation for a new highway interchange to be built on the site.|$|E

25|$|Following lengthy {{periods in}} store at Fratton, Stratford, Preston Park, Tyseley and York, {{it was again}} {{overhauled}} in the early 1980s on the Mid Hants Railway and returned to steam in 1983. However, because of the steep gradients on the Mid Hants, it moved to the Swanage Railway in 1991 and remained there until its boiler certificate expired in 1993. It then moved to the Bluebell Railway, where it remained as a static exhibit on public display and under cover, until 1 February 2008. It then moved to the Bodmin and Wenford Railway, and was returned to steam in August 2010 following a heavy overhaul including repairs to the <b>cylinder</b> <b>block</b> at the Flour Mill Workshop in the Forest of Dean. It has been repainted in early British Railways lined black colour scheme and is regularly used on passenger trains at Bodmin. From June to December 2015, the locomotive was again loaned to the Swanage Railway and had guested at the Mid Hants Railway in February 2016 before returning to Bodmin. By December 2016 the locomotive had been transferred to the Battlefield Line in Leicestershire on hire from the Bodmin and Wenford Railway {{to be one of}} two locomotives working the passenger services on this railway.|$|E
500|$|The i has a [...] "rear-midship" [...] {{engine mounted}} {{just ahead of}} the rear axle, a highly unusual {{configuration}} in a small car where front-engine design has dominated since the 1970s. The 3B20 three-cylinder powerplant has an aluminium <b>cylinder</b> <b>block,</b> a displacement of 659cubic centimetres, and incorporates double overhead camshafts with MIVEC variable valve timing in the cylinder head. Initially only an intercooled and turbocharged engine was offered, until a naturally aspirated version was introduced for 2007. A four-speed automatic gearbox transmits power to the rear or all four wheels, depending on specification.|$|E
500|$|Seeing {{little sign}} of an {{increase}} in production capacity at Ashford, Maunsell decided to construct the prototype N1 locomotive from parts intended for use on the next Nclass locomotive in the batch, No.822. The outside cylinders were exchanged for the N1 type, which had been machined at the GWR's Swindon railway works following casting at Ashford to quicken construction once the Nclass frames were modified to accept the new design of <b>cylinder</b> <b>block.</b> This produced a robust chassis capable of supporting both sets of Walschaerts and the Holcroft conjugated valve gear. The latter was provided with grease-gun lubrication points to ease maintenance.|$|E
50|$|The Napier company decided {{first to}} develop a large 24 {{cylinder}} liquid-cooled engine, capable of producing at least 2,000 hp (1,491 kW) in late 1935. Although the company continued with the opposed H layout of the Dagger, this new design positioned the <b>cylinder</b> <b>blocks</b> horizontally and it was to use sleeve valves. All of the accessories were grouped conveniently {{above and below the}} <b>cylinder</b> <b>blocks,</b> rather than being at the front and rear of the engine, in most contemporary designs.|$|R

500|$|The XJ220's engine had a bore {{and stroke}} of , dry sump lubrication, Zytek multi point fuel {{injection}} with dual injectors and Zytek electronic engine management. The engine was manufactured with an aluminium <b>cylinder</b> <b>block,</b> aluminium cylinder heads with steel connecting rods and crankshaft, and in the standard state of tune, it produced a maximum power of [...] at 7200rpm and torque of [...] at 4500rpm. The XJ220 can accelerate from 0–60miles per hour in 3.6 seconds and reach {{a top speed of}} 212.3miles per hour. Road & Track tested a top speed of 210.5mph, 0-60mph in 4.8 seconds and 12.4 seconds for the standing quarter mile.|$|E
500|$|Another issue {{concerned}} {{the strength of}} the locomotive frames around the cylinders. Taking inspiration from the 3-cylinder locomotives designed by Vincent Raven for the North Eastern Railway, Holcroft suggested that all three cylinders and associated steam passages should be cast in a single block, with rectangular holes cut into the frames to enable the outside cylinders to project through them. [...] However, the SECR’s established practice of using outside steam chests on locomotives with outside cylinders prevented this, and the design team resorted to cutting a gap in the frames to accommodate the outside cylinders, which were then secured in place with a bolted splice plate. Production limitations at the Ashford works foundry also prevented the manufacture of a single casting that incorporated all three cylinders. [...] This meant that the cylinder castings were split into two sections, with the left and inside cylinders forming a single unit that would be bolted onto a separate right-hand cylinder casting. Holcroft’s new <b>cylinder</b> <b>block</b> design also incorporated a separate saddle casting, a configuration that allowed the N1 cylinder patterns to be used with any diameter of smokebox, creating a standard component with potential applications on future locomotive designs.|$|E
500|$|Holcroft’s {{valve gear}} design {{was also an}} attempt to address the {{problems}} associated with Gresley’s conjugated valve gear, which was prone to variations in valve events caused by heat expansion of the valve spindles within the pistons. The design utilised the motion of the outside valve rods (the rods transmitting the motion of the driving axles to the valves, such as the combination lever) instead, although the restricted space between the back of the outside cylinders and the front driving wheels made it impossible to locate the rocking arms controlling the conjugating mechanism in the vicinity. Holcroft’s solution was to move the mechanism to a position above the pony truck and ahead of the cylinders and link it to the outside valve rods with extension levers, which had to be accommodated within the strict SECR loading gauge tolerances. This necessitated a new design of <b>cylinder</b> <b>block</b> whereby the outside steam chests were set inwards {{and the size of the}} cylinders reduced to [...] stroke and diameter. [...] The sides of the outside cylinders consequently sloped inwards towards the top in a configuration similar to GWR 2-cylinder locomotives, thus providing ample space in which to accommodate the extension levers. The inside cylinder and conjugation assembly were set at an incline of 1 in 8 to clear the front pony truck, leaving space for a third set of independent Walschaerts valve gear between the frames should Holcroft’s conjugation mechanism prove unreliable in service.|$|E

The company was established in December 1978, and designs and produces <b>cylinder</b> <b>blocks,</b> <b>cylinder</b> heads, exhaust manifolds, drive shafts, camshafts and other components for automobiles and commercial vehicles.|$|R
50|$|Several {{activities}} {{can be done with}} the <b>cylinder</b> <b>blocks.</b> The main activity involves removing the <b>cylinders</b> from the <b>block</b> and replacing them again in the spot that one got them from.
