On {{the basis}} of {{analyzing}} the structure of planetary gear reducer, this paper points out that it’s necessary {{to make use of}} optimization design method to improve the design level of the planetary gear reducer. The optimization model of planet carrier is established and the process of optimization design is studied. Taking the XJB 80 single arm planet carrier as an example, whose optimization design is performed by using ANSYS software. The spacing of <b>connecting</b> <b>panel,</b> thickness of sidewall, the inner radius of the <b>connecting</b> <b>panel</b> and some other parameters are selected as design variables, the yield strength and structural deformation limitation of planet carrier material are selected as state variables and the total volume is selected as objective function. The optimal structure size of the planet carrier is obtained, result shows that the corresponding volume is reduced by 21 %, thus the manufacturing cost can be reduced. The study result has already been used by planetary gear reducer enterprise...|$|E
40|$|Profiled Steel Sheeting Dry Board (PSSDB) {{floor panel}} is a {{composite}} of dry board and profiled steel sheeting screwed together by means of self-tapping, self-drilling shear connectors. The system has been successfully implemented in many Malaysian construction projects. Recently, the PSSDB system has been expanded {{to be an easy}} to assemble prefabricated floor for rural school cabin construction. An innovative prefabricated panel consists of three PSSDB parts which are then screwed together on site to form a semicontinuous panel has been proposed. This paper describes the three distinct parts of the panel, their assembly and the experiment to study the bending behavior of the panel. The semi-continuous panel performance was also compared to that of a continuous panel. All together, six 3. 0 m span samples were tested under a uniformly distributed load until failure. The semi-continuous panels showed a two-phase behavior whilst the continuous panels showed a threephase behavior under loading which were related to the time of cracking of the dry board and the buckling of the profiled steel sheeting. The mid span deflections were recorded and used to determine the stiffness of the panels. Results showed that the stiffness of the semi-continuous panels were half of that of the continuous panels. It can be concluded that the discontinued spanning of the profiled steel sheeting has severely reduced the overall semicontinuous panel stiffness. The 25 screws used in the 0. 6 m middle <b>connecting</b> <b>panel</b> had shown to be quite insufficient to hold the whole semi continuous panel together. Therefore, the addition of screws with closer spacing is recommended to increase the panel stiffness...|$|E

Three (3) <b>connected</b> PLFP <b>panels</b> were cast using foamed concrete as the wythe and polystyrene as the core layer. Each <b>connected</b> <b>panel</b> were cast from two single <b>panels</b> <b>connected</b> using L-bar connection. The panels were strengthened with steel bar reinforcement embedded in both wythes which were connected to each other by the steel shear truss connectors. The <b>connected</b> PLFP <b>panels</b> were tested under flexural load. A single PLFP panel was cast as a control panel and tested under axial load. The results were analysed in term of the panel’s ultimate load, crack pattern and mode of failure. Results showed that the two <b>connected</b> PLFP <b>panels</b> were able to sustain slightly lower ultimate load compared to single PLFP panel.

40|$|The {{structural}} behaviour of FRP-composite (E-glass/polyester) {{sheet pile}} panels subjected to uniform pressure load was investigated. Single, connected and concrete-filled 2. 13 m panels were tested to failure {{with the objective}} of determining their moment capacity and failure mechanism. As the uniform load test procedure utilized in this study allowed for the prevention of premature local crushing behaviour within the span, the average moment capacity obtained in this study was more than double that found in prior studies of FRP sheet pile panels, averaging 11. 15 kN. m in single panel tests and 9. 32 kN. m in <b>connected</b> <b>panel</b> tests. Single panels exhibited little difference in moment capacity whether tested in the upright or inverted orientation and there was no apparent reduction in capacity when a single panel was subjected to repeated load cycles. Failure of both single and <b>connected</b> <b>panels</b> was generally attributable to local buckling and invariably occurred at a deflection of about 50 mm, indicating that deflection limits may govern design. No joint failure was observed in <b>connected</b> <b>panels.</b> (Abstract shortened by UMI. ...|$|R

Due to this variety, many researchers have developed a model to predict {{the performance of the}} CLT panel (Okabe et al. [4], Oh et al. [5]). Also because there are very varied connections, several models to predict the shear performance of CLT shear wall connection have been developed. Filiatrault and Folz [6] applied a kinematic model for seismic design of wood frame building. FPInnovations and Binational Softwood Lumber Council [7] described a kinematic model, in which the performance of the CLT wall could be predicted by the properties of connection under the assumption that the CLT panel is a rigid body. Gavric et al. [8] developed an analytical model and analyzed the CLT wall made of two horizontally <b>connected</b> <b>panels.</b> Yasumura [9] formulated the CLT wall connected by horizontally <b>connected</b> <b>panels</b> and validated the formula.

40|$|Traditional cast in situ {{construction}} {{has been a}} common practice adopted by building industry in this country. This process could not meet the huge demand on affordable housing which is the major issue now because it requires large number of workers, massive casting and erection work, and longer construction time. As a solution to this, a precast system needs to be innovated {{as an alternative to}} this traditional system. Current research has been focusing on precast panel system made of conventional concrete. Therefore, this research investigated the structural behaviour of single and two connected Sandwiched Precast Foamed Concrete Panel (PLFP). Eight single PLFP and three sets of <b>connected</b> PLFP <b>panels</b> were cast using foamed concrete as the wythe and polystyrene as the core layer. The panels were strengthened with steel bar reinforcement embedded in both wythes which were connected to each other by the steel shear truss connectors. Single PLFP panels were tested under axial load while <b>connected</b> PLFP <b>panels</b> were tested under flexural load test. The results were analyzed in term of the panel’s ultimate load, crack pattern and mode of failure, load-deflection and load-strain profiles. It was found that the ultimate load recorded in single PLFP panels from experiment showed good agreement with the values from previous research. <b>Connected</b> PLFP <b>panels</b> were able to sustain slightly lower ultimate load compared to single PLFP panel. The percentage difference between these ultimate load values is about 14 %. The value of ultimate load recorded for single and <b>connected</b> PLFP <b>panels</b> were 171 kN and 147 kN, respectively. For both single and <b>connected</b> PLFP <b>panels,</b> it was observed that ultimate load, crack pattern and failure mode, load-deflection and load-strain profiles were significantly influenced by the panel’s slenderness ratio. Finite element analysis using LUSAS software is also carried out to study the effect of slenderness ratio on ultimate load. It was observed that the difference value between FEM and Experimental for single and <b>connected</b> PLFP <b>panels</b> are in a good agreement which recorded 4. 5 % and 5. 8 %, respectively...|$|R
