With the liberation after the war, the Soviet Union investigated the accident.

Miners' relatives rushed to the site but were denied entry by a cordon of Japanese guards who erected electric fences to keep them out. In an attempt to curtail the fire underground, the Japanese shut off the ventilation and sealed the pit head.

30|$|A good mine {{ventilation}} design should maintain adequate airflow through mine working areas all {{the time}} even in case of emergency. It does not only conform to the safety and health standards and federal regulations, {{as defined by the}} Mine Safety and Health (MSHA), but also lower the cost of air supply (U.S. Code of Federal Regulations 2014).Providing continuous fresh air to the mine dilutes and removes noxious gas and dust. It also adjusts the climate in the underground mine workings, and consequently establishing a good working environment (Sui et al. 2011). Mining accidents may have a variety of causes, including leakage of poisonous gases (such as hydrogen sulfide) or explosive natural gases, especially firedamp or methane, or gas outburst or gas explosion, dust explosions, collapsing of minestopes, mining-induced seismicity, flooding, or common mechanical errors from improperly used or malfunctioning mining equipment (safety lamps or electrical equipment). The improper use of explosives underground can also cause methane and <b>coal-dust</b> <b>explosions</b> (Terazawa et al. 1985; Kucuker 2006).|$|R

40|$|The {{electronic}} charging of mine dust {{can cause}} <b>coal-dust</b> <b>explosion</b> {{and increase the}} risk of pneumoconiosis, so it is necessary to take more attention to the study of its electronic charging properties. The mechanism of electronic charging of coal mine dust was investigated in this paper. It was found that the formation and polarity of dust are determined by the energy band structure and of the two contacting sides; then a mathematical model of work function is established in mesoscopic level. The experiments conclude that the work function decreases with the particle size for the dust with same properties, moreover large particles are positively charged and small particles are negatively charged. Finally, the experimental verification of the main particles charged model drive unipolar and bipolar charged modes and confirm the correctness of microstructure and mesoscopic analyses, which furthermore lay the foundation for further research. </p...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{parameters}} of explosive {{characteristics of the}} coal-dust are assessed systematically with the test device of minimum ignition temperature of dust clouds and 20 L sphere explosion test units. The minimum ignition temperature of dust is a main safety index when handling combustible dusts in industrial production, and while hazard evaluation, the maximum explosion pressure and the explosion index are key parameters. Five kinds of coal-dust with different particle diameters were tested {{in order to determine}} the temperature sensitivity and the ferocity under the given conditions, which can be used as the criteria to classify dust explosion hazards. The experiment results indicate that the minimum ignition temperature of coal-dust cloud reduces with the decrease of particle diameter under temperature of (293 ± 5) K and powder spraying pressure of 0. 08 MPa, and when the particle size reduces to (25 - 48) μm, the minimum ignition temperature is between (793 - 803) K; Besides that, the results can also show that minimum explosive concentration of coal-dust cloud is between 20 gám- 3 and 30 gám- 3 under temperature of (293 ± 5) K, powder spraying pressure of 2 MPa and ignition energy of 10 kJ, the maximum explosion pressure is 0. 45 MPa and the maximum explosion index is 11. 14 MPaámás- 1, which classifies <b>coal-dust</b> <b>explosion</b> hazards to Level I. The conclusions drawn from the experimental results are of great significance to the safe application of these combustible substances...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} study the {{environmental}} impact of coal mining, took Expanding and Improving Project on Xihe Coal Mine (EIPXCM) as an example to investigate and study. Firstly, investigated its coal bed structure and coal quality and summed up its features and scale. The results show that the located stratum is mantle fold with intensive cracking activities. The coal bed is thin and uniclinal with a dip angle of 35 °. So long wall retreating mining method along the strike will be adopted. Sulfur and phosphorous in the coal are low as 0. 25 ～ 0. 35 % and 0. 001 ～ 0. 007 % respectively. A key winding inclined shaft and another inclined shaft for workers and air return will be built. Production capability of the mine is 60 000 t/a with 1. 9 years of workable period. Secondly, water cycling, equilibrium, treatment, flying ash pollution, coal mine safety and entironmental influence are analyzed. The results are that the relative gushing amounts of CH 4 and CO are 2. 5 m 3 /t and 0. 34 m 3 /t respectively. <b>Coal-dust</b> <b>explosion</b> index is more than 40 %. It indicates a low explosion possibility. The project will inevitably lead to surface subsidence and collapse resulting in further soil erosion to some extent. Finally, some precaution measures are also proponed. This will lay a sound foundation for later entironmental influence assessment. 1...|$|E
40|$|Coal dust {{is highly}} {{explosive}} and caused dozens of victims in Colombia. In this research {{the most important}} and direct influence on coal dust, especially those that cause combustion and explosion inside the mine factors were analyzed; is important to discuss the characteristics of each coal mined and processed, for actions that do not compromise the integrity of the staff or facilities. Four (4) channel samples of coal exploitation faces with High Volatile Bituminous C from Cerrejón Formation were collected and analyzed: Proximal (moisture, ash, volatile matter, fixed carbon, total sulfur and calorific value); petrographic (maceral counting and vitrinite reflectance) and Hardgrove mill index. The samples were crushed to obtain fractions corresponding to meshes 200, 270 and 325 considering those sizes could give greater risks of explosion. The analysis showed that there is a direct relationship between the results of the Hardgrove mill index and the degree of explosiveness in the fraction corresponding to 200 mesh, meaning that a higher rate of milling the greater the degree of explosiveness; a direct relationship between calorific inertinite content range and also observed. The 325 mesh fraction for all samples showed the same degree of explosiveness, which indicates that the grain size and the type of coal maceral not influence the content and coal rank. The flash point decreased for finer grains for all samples. Thus, the size of carbon particle is very important as an indicator in the <b>coal-dust</b> <b>explosion</b> factor: finer particles have greater the likelihood of explosion. The percentage of inertinites has a close relationship with the explosivity index, the higher the content of this maceral, coupled with the fine grain, coal dust behaves like a highly explosive element and generate risks in mining operations. Coal rank is an important factor regard to self combustion and explosion of particles with grain sizes greater 200 mesh. If a low rank coal has susceptible and unstable at high temperature elements and this is combined with high volatile matter and some other influential environmental parameters, such as blow air, dust concentration, humidity, and pressure, among others, the ideal combustion and then a likely violent explosion may affect a large portion of mine...|$|E
