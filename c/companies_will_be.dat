5|$|Omaha {{was divided}} into ten sectors, codenamed (from west to east): Charlie, Dog Green, Dog White, Dog Red, Easy Green, Easy White, Easy Red, Fox Green, Fox White, and Fox Red. The initial assault was {{to be made by}} two Regimental Combat Teams (RCT), {{supported}} by two tank battalions, with two battalions of Rangers also attached. The infantry regiments were organized into three battalions each of around 1,000 men. Each battalion was organized as three rifle companies each of up to 240 men, and a support company of up to 190 men. Infantry companies A through D belonged to the 1st battalion of a regiment, E through H to the 2nd, I through M to the 3rd; the letter ‘J’ was not used. (Individual <b>companies</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> referred to in this article by company and regiment, e.g. Company A of the 116th RCT will be 'A/116'). In addition, each battalion had a headquarters company of up to 180 men. The tank battalions consisted of three companies, A through C, each of 16 tanks, while the Ranger battalions were organized into six companies, A through F, of around 65 men per company. V Corps' 56th Signal Battalion was responsible for communications on Omaha with the fleet offshore, especially routing requests for naval gunfire support to the destroyers and USS Arkansas.|$|E

25|$|Economic {{freedom in}} terms of technoliberalism {{involves}} small scale capitalism, that is capitalism for small and medium-sized businesses, rather than corporate organizations created by major interest groups. Ideally, localized systems and community ties will {{pave the way for}} a new capitalist economy, undoing the power of global capitalism. Implemented trust regulations will compliment this, meaning more rules for big companies to create better competition, whereas smaller <b>companies</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> enforced with fewer rules. Technoliberalism places an emphasis on these small and medium-sized businesses because it can help boost economic growth. Money spent by local authorities with small firms is re-spent into the local economy, compared to that spent with large businesses in the same area. Doing business this way then, is better value for money.|$|E

2500|$|A {{variety of}} {{companies}} may be incorporated under the Companies Act 2006. The {{people interested in}} starting the enterprise - the prospective directors, employees and shareholders - may choose, firstly, an unlimited or a limited company. [...] "Unlimited" [...] will mean the incorporators will be liable for all losses and debts under the general principles of private law. The option of a limited company leads to a second choice. A company can be [...] "limited by guarantee", meaning that if the company owes more debts than it can pay, the guarantors' liability {{will be limited to}} the extent of the money they elect to guarantee. Or a company may choose to be [...] "limited by shares", meaning capital investors' liability is limited to the amount they subscribe for in share capital. A third choice is whether a company limited by shares will be public or private. Both kinds of companies must display (partly as a warning) the endings [...] "plc" [...] or [...] "Ltd" [...] following the company name. Most new businesses will opt for a private company limited by shares, while unlimited companies and companies limited by guarantee are typically chosen by either charities, risky ventures or mutual funds wanting to signal they will not leave debts unpaid. Charitable ventures also have the option to become a community interest company. Public companies are the predominant business vehicle in the UK economy. While far less numerous than private companies, they employ the overwhelming mass of British workers and turn over the greatest share of wealth. Public companies can offer shares to the public, must have a minimum capital of £50,000, must allow free transferability of its shares, and typically (as most big public <b>companies</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> listed) will follow requirements of the London Stock Exchange or a similar securities market. Businesses may also elect to incorporate under the European Company Statute as a Societas Europaea. An [...] "SE" [...] will be treated in every European Union member state {{as if it were a}} public company formed in accordance with the law of that state, and may opt in or out of employee involvement.|$|E

60|$|Among all the sufferers by that {{accident}} few suffered so severely--with the exception: of course, {{of those}} who lost their lives--as the Grand National Trunk Railway itself. In {{the course of the}} trials that followed, it was clearly shown that the company had run the train much more with the view of gratifying the public than of enriching their coffers, {{from the fact that the}} utmost possible sum which they could hope to draw by it was 17 pounds, for which sum they had carried 600 passengers upwards of twenty miles. The accident took place in consequence of circumstances over which the company had no control, and the results were--that twenty persons were killed and about two hundred wounded! that one hundred and sixty claims were made for compensation-- one hundred and forty of which, being deemed exorbitant or fraudulent, were defended in court; and that, eventually, the company had to pay from seventy to eighty thousand pounds! out of which the highest sum paid to one individual was 6750 pounds! The risks that are thus run by railway <b>companies</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> seen to be excessive, especially when it is considered that excursion trains afford but slight remuneration, while many of them convey enormous numbers of passengers. On the occasion of the first excursion from Oxford to London, in 1851, fifty-two of the broad-gauge carriages of the Great Western were employed, and the excursionists numbered upwards of three thousand five hundred--a very town on wheels! Truly the risks of railway companies are great, and their punishments severe.|$|E
6000|$|We {{may even}} hazard some details about these special roads. For example, {{they will be}} very {{different}} from macadamized roads; they will be used only by soft-tired conveyances; the battering horseshoes, the perpetual filth of horse traffic, and the clumsy wheels of laden carts will never wear them. It may be that they will have a surface like that of some cycle-racing tracks, though since they will be open to wind and weather, it is perhaps more probable they will be made of very good asphalt sloped to drain, and still more probable that they will be of some quite new substance altogether--whether hard or resilient is beyond my foretelling. They will have to be very wide--they will be just as wide as the courage of their promoters goes--and if the first made are too narrow there will be no question of gauge to limit the later ones. Their traffic in opposite directions will probably be strictly separated, and it will no doubt habitually disregard complicated and fussy regulations imposed under the initiative of the Railway Interest by such official bodies as the Board of Trade. The promoters will doubtless take a hint from suburban railway traffic and from the current difficulty of the Metropolitan police, and where their ways branch the streams of traffic will not cross at a level but by bridges. It is easily conceivable that once these tracks are in existence, cyclists and motors other than those of the constructing <b>companies</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> able to make use of them. And, moreover, once they exist {{it will be possible to}} experiment with vehicles of a size and power quite beyond the dimensions prescribed by our ordinary roads--roads whose width has been entirely determined by the size of a cart a horse can pull.[8] ...|$|E
