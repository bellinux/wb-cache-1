50|$|The {{telescopic}} sight propriety mount is adjustable for {{tension on the}} SVD rifle's side rail. This side rail is a Warsaw Pact rail (a type of dovetail rail). The side rail mount is an offset mounting that positions the PSO-1 {{telescopic sight}} axis {{to the left side}} in relation to the receiver center axis. The mount has a <b>castle</b> <b>nut</b> that screws {{into the bottom of the}} locking lever. The spring-loaded portion of the clamp has to be pressed down to tighten or loosen the <b>castle</b> <b>nut</b> as needed.|$|E
5000|$|A {{castellated}} nut, {{also called}} a <b>castle</b> <b>nut</b> or slotted nut, is a nut with slots (notches) cut into one end. [...] The {{name comes from}} the nut’s resemblance to the crenellated parapet of a medieval castle.|$|E
50|$|The LPS {{telescopic}} sight propriety mount is adjustable for {{tension on the}} LPS rifle's side rail. This side rail is a Warsaw Pact rail similar in design to the mounting used for Russian SVD rifles and PSO-1 optical sights and positions the {{telescopic sight}} axis {{to the left side}} in relation to the receiver and bore center axis.The Warsaw Pact mount has a <b>castle</b> <b>nut</b> that screws {{into the bottom of the}} locking lever. The spring-loaded portion of the clamp has to be pressed down to tighten or loosen the <b>castle</b> <b>nut</b> as needed.The scope can be easily removed from the receiver of the rifle by swinging the locking lever open, then sliding the scope mount to the rear. This allows easy access to the receiver cover which needs to be removed for cleaning.Due to the offset to the left and the relative height of the mounting, the PSL iron sights can be used with a LPS scope mounted, though the positioning of the scope’s optical center axis may not be comfortable to all shooters.|$|E
40|$|Purpose. One of key {{requirements}} for rolling stock of next generation is essential increase of warranty period or running between maintenance depots and in periods between programming repair works. This {{will lead to}} a reduction of costs to maintenance and repair during service life of rolling stock. In this regard, the industry aspires to use (during construction, repairs, modernization of rolling stock) a modern screw joints in structures for fixing parts. These screw joints could provide a high reliability under the action of vibration load. FS-hexagon all-metal self-lock nuts of multiple use, Flaig + Hommel GmbH company meets these requirements. Therefore, there is the need to consider the results of tests to confirm the reliability of FS-nuts in the new environment. Methodology. Test complex of developed programs and methods was carried out on railway rolling stock for functional demonstration of screw joints with FS-nuts. These tests include: 1) proof test and locking moment test as specified in ISO 2320 under normal climatic conditions and after low temperatures impact; 2) running test for rolling stock, secured the most load condition and according to supervised operation of next generation cars on the railway. Findings. Results of the tests testify that FS-all-metal self-lock nuts meet the requirements of international standards and confirm the reliability of the next generation rolling stock during its operation on the railway of 1520 mm gauge. Namely, locking moment and tightening torque is maintained in screw joints both on spring-suspended and unspring parts of freight car bogies by the action of vibration load under multiple use of FS-nuts. Originality. The developed software and methods was improved by conducting additional tests after exposure of screw joints with FS-nuts to low temperatures, as well as by control operations for assessing the condition of screw joints with FS-nuts, in the conditions of controlled operation of rolling stock. It fully allows confirming the reliability of the FS-nuts on the rolling stock of 1520 mm gauge railways. Practical value. Application of FS-nuts makes it possible to stop using secondary members in screw joints of railway rolling stock of 1520 mm gauge. These secondary members are used for reaction to slacking under vibration and consist of <b>castle</b> <b>nuts,</b> retaining washers, locking washers, serrated washers, check plates, disposable clamps. Using FS-nuts allow providing the rating rules for next generation of rolling stock. Besides the modern technologies of FS-nuts production provide their prolonged running time under the conditions of pollution, humidity, differential temperature and other adverse factors...|$|R
5000|$|William <b>Castle</b> simply went <b>nuts.</b> He {{came up with}} [...] "Coward's Corner," [...] {{a yellow}} {{cardboard}} booth, manned by a bewildered theater employee in the lobby.

A voice-over advised {{the audience of}} the time remaining {{in which they could}} leave the theater and receive a full refund if they were too frightened to see the remainder of the film. To ensure the more wily patrons did not simply stay for a second showing and leave during the finale, Castle had different color tickets printed for each show. About 1% of patrons still demanded refunds, and in response:William <b>Castle</b> simply went <b>nuts.</b> He came up with [...] "Coward's Corner," [...] a yellow cardboard booth, manned by a bewildered theater employee in the lobby.

[...] Very, very few were masochistic enough to endure this. The one percent refund dribbled away to a zero percent, and I'm sure that in many cities a plant had to be paid to go through this torture. No wonder theater owners balked at booking a William Castle film. It was all just too complicated.|$|R
