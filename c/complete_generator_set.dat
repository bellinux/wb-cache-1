An unknown crack in blade roots or blade attachments {{can lead to}} a serious failure of the <b>complete</b> turbo <b>generator</b> <b>set.</b> Due to the high demand of power energy worldwide there is a strong demand to extend the calculated life of turbo <b>generator</b> <b>sets.</b> The extended operation cycle of turbines leads to the demand of advanced NDT methods, especially for highly stressed areas of turbine and generator rotors. The most critical ranges of a turbine rotor are the turbine blade roots as well as the turbine blade attachment grooves. The individual design of the turbine manufacturer require separate NDT methods for each blade root or blade attachment to be inspected. Phased Array Ultrasonic Inspection offers a reliable inspection without dismantling the parts for inspection. This paper describes examples of development of new Phased Array probes and the qualification of the inspection techniques for selected application in steam turbine field-service. 1...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. A {{new method}} for {{estimating}} {{the moment of}} inertia of engine <b>generator</b> <b>set</b> was proposed in this paper, which was defined as Governor Sensitivity Test Method (GSTM). In this method, the moment of inertia of engine <b>generator</b> <b>set</b> was estimated by means of measure transient speed change of engine <b>generator</b> <b>set</b> when the engine load increases suddenly. In the present, {{there have been some}} methods for estimating the moment of inertia of engine, such as, Additional Mass Method, Running Down Test Method and Accelerating- Decelerating Method Under No Load. These methods for estimating the moment of inertia of engine <b>generator</b> <b>set</b> all have shortcomings on accuracy or operability. These shortcomings have been overcome by using the GSTM method proposed in this paper. It is easy to operate, and the factors affecting estimation errors are small. In this paper, the basic principle of the GSTM method was discussed. The factors affecting estimation errors ware analyzed. An example of calculating the moment of inertia of an engine <b>generator</b> <b>set</b> using the GSTM method was presented. The result of calculating the moment of inertia of engine <b>generator</b> <b>set</b> was used to simulate the transient speed response of an engine <b>generator</b> <b>set.</b> The GSTM method was verified to be practical by comparing the results of simulation and experiment...|$|R
