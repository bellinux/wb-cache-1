5|$|The International Union for <b>Conservation</b> <b>of</b> Nature (IUCN) {{estimates}} {{the population of}} the fulvous whistling duck to be from 1.3–1.5million individuals. This may be an underestimate since regional assessments suggest 1million birds in the Americas, 1.1million in Africa and at least 20,000 in South Asia. Although the population appear to be declining, the decrease is not rapid enough to trigger the vulnerability criteria. The large numbers and huge breeding range mean that this duck is classified by the IUCN as being of Least Concern. It is one of the species to which the Agreement on the <b>Conservation</b> <b>of</b> African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds (AEWA) applies.|$|E

This allows us to generalize essentially the procedure of finding potential symmetries for the systems with multidimensional spaces <b>of</b> <b>conservation</b> laws. A class of variable coefficient (1 + 1) -dimensional nonlinear diffusion-convection equations of general form f(x) u_t=(g(x) A(u) u_x) _x+h(x) B(u) u_x is investigated. Using the most direct method, we carry out two classifications <b>of</b> local <b>conservation</b> laws up to equivalence relations generated by both usual and enhanced equivalence groups. Equivalence with respect to Ĝ^∼ and correct choice of gauge coefficients of equations play the major role for simple and clear formulation of the final results. The notion <b>of</b> contractions <b>of</b> <b>conservation</b> laws and one <b>of</b> characteristics <b>of</b> <b>conservation</b> laws are introduced and contractions <b>of</b> <b>conservation</b> laws <b>of</b> diffusion-convection equations are found.
