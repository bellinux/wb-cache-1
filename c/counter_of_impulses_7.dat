40|$|Background: Osteochondral autografts and allografts require {{mechanical}} force for proper graft placement into the defect site; however, impaction compromises the tissue. This study aimed {{to determine the}} effect of impaction force and number of hits to seat the graft on cartilage integrity. Hypothesis: Under constant impulse conditions, higher impaction load magnitudes are more detrimental to cell viability, matrix integrity, and collagen network organization and will result in proteoglycan loss and nitric oxide release. Study Design: Controlled laboratory study. Methods: Osteochondral explants, harvested from fresh bovine trochleae, were exposed to a series of consistent impact loads delivered by a pneumatically driven device. Each plug received the same overall <b>impulse</b> <b>of</b> <b>7</b> Ns, reflecting the mean of 23 clin...|$|R
30|$|In {{this paper}} we study {{nonlinear}} differential equations subject to random impulses occurring at random moments. Randomness is introduced both through {{the time between}} impulses, which is distributed exponentially, and through the amount <b>of</b> <b>impulses.</b> The p-moment exponential stability of the solution is studied by employing appropriate generalized Lyapunov’s functions. In the literature many authors study the stability of impulsive systems with deterministic moments <b>of</b> <b>impulses</b> (see [1, 2, 4] and the references cited therein), the exponential stability of impulsive delay differential equations with deterministic moments <b>of</b> <b>impulses</b> [12 – 15] and the p-moment stability of stochastic differential equations with or without <b>impulses</b> [6, <b>7,</b> 16, 17]. The behavior of solutions of stochastic equations is totally different from the behavior of ordinary differential equations, so the study of stability properties of differential equations with impulses occurring at random moments is important.|$|R

Solutions giving zero residual vibration are formulated {{in terms of a}} quadratic cost function and constructed by iterative operations on measured sets of inputoutput data. The versatility of the approach is demonstrated by simulated test cases involving (1) amplitude optimization <b>of</b> <b>impulses</b> with fixed timings, (2) timing optimization <b>of</b> <b>impulses</b> with fixed amplitudes and (3) combined timing and amplitude optimization. The approach is model-free and directly applicable to multi-mode systems. Moreover, fast adaptation within a single rest-to-rest maneuver can be achieved. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|In the {{following}} work, the effect <b>of</b> shock <b>impulses</b> (2. 5 – 10. 0 mPa * s) on lipid bilayer membranes consisting of POPC (1 -palmitoyl- 2 -oleoyl-sn-glycero- 3 -phoshocholine) and varying amounts of cholesterol (10 % and 50 %) {{has been studied}} using molecular dynamics. Both models were equilibrated for 7 nanoseconds in an NPT ensemble at 310 K and 1 atm. After equilibration, the 50 % cholesterol model showed a larger average membrane thickness and an increased average deuterium order parameter (SCD) of carbons in lipid tails {{when compared to the}} 10 % model. In addition, values such as the total area per lipid and area per POPC were reduced in the 50 % model when compared to the 10 % cholesterol model. ^ After application <b>of</b> similar shock <b>impulses</b> to the 50 % and 10 % cholesterol models, the structural effects on each respective bilayer model were compared. The change in bilayer thickness due to shock impulse was measured for both models at all impulses tested. These values were used to calculate the percent decrease in bilayer thickness of both models. On average, the 50 % cholesterol model showed a 1 - 2 % lesser reduction in bilayer thickness then the 10 % cholesterol model at the shock impulses tested. After application <b>of</b> shock <b>impulses</b> to both models, the temporal change of the instantaneous averaged order parameter SCDi of the upper and lower monolayers of both models was calculated at shock <b>impulses</b> <b>of</b> <b>7.</b> 5 mPa * s and 10. mPa. * s. In both models, regardless <b>of</b> shock <b>impulse,</b> the SCDi value of the upper monolayer decreased followed by a decrease in the SCDi. parameter of the lower monolayer. These effects can be linked to the collapse phase of the lipid bilayer due to shockwave. Once the shockwave has fully traveled through the lipid bilayer, the SCDi parameter of the lower monolayer begins to increase which indicates beginning of the rebound phase. Finally, the increased fluidity of the lipid bilayer models was examined through calculation of the lateral displacement of the lipids in both models during the shockwave impulse ranges tested. The 50 % model showed a slightly higher later displacement at the shock impulse ranges tested but not significantly higher to make any conclusions. ^ In addition, the efficiency <b>of</b> the shock <b>impulse</b> based on the distance of the shock water slab from the lipid bilayer was analyzed. The right boundary of the shock slab was placed 1 Å´ and 10 Å´ away from the lipid bilayer and similar shock <b>impulses</b> <b>of</b> 2. 5, 5. 0, 7. 5 and 10 mPa * s were applied. It was shown that placement of the shock slab 10 Å´ away from the lipid bilayer causes a greater decrease in average bilayer thickness and slight increases in kinetic energy, temperature and pressure of the system. This could be owed to better momentum transfer among molecules achieved when the water slab is placed 10 Å´ away rather than 1 Å´ away. ...|$|R
