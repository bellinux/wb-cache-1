5|$|Models of the {{evolution}} of the planet's orbit over time suggest that heating resulting from this tidal locking may {{play a major role in}} the planet's geology. Models proposed by scientists predict that tidal heating <b>could</b> <b>yield</b> a surface heat flux about three times greater than the Jupiter's moon Io's, which could result in major geological activity such as volcanoes and plate tectonics.|$|E
5|$|It is {{believed}} that further archaeological digs <b>could</b> <b>yield</b> substantial rewards, considering that {{the remains of the}} original city are still preserved under hundreds of years of rubbish. Some archaeological excavations have taken place, the paths of streets are still visible, and some buildings have been partially reconstructed to waist-height. But the site is difficult and dangerous to access because of the nearby slums. However, some artifacts that have been recovered so far can be seen in Cairo's Museum of Islamic Art.|$|E

5|$|The tulip was {{different}} from every other flower known to Europe at that time, with a saturated intense petal color that no other plant had. The appearance of the nonpareil tulip as a status symbol at this time coincides {{with the rise of}} newly independent Holland's trade fortunes. No longer the Spanish Netherlands, its economic resources could now be channeled into commerce and the country embarked on its Golden Age. Amsterdam merchants were {{at the center of the}} lucrative East Indies trade, where one voyage <b>could</b> <b>yield</b> profits of 400%.|$|E
5|$|After the {{southern}} campaign, the Commonwealth {{had to deal}} with a threat from the north, as the armistice, ending the Polish–Swedish War (1600–1629) was expiring. The majority of Polish nobles preferred to solve the problem through negotiations, unwilling to pay taxes for a new war, provided that Sweden was open to negotiations and concessions (in particular, to retreat from the occupied Polish coastal territories). Władysław himself was hoping for a war, which <b>could</b> <b>yield</b> some more significant territorial gains, and even managed to gather a sizeable army, with navy elements, near the disputed territories. Sweden, weakened by involvement in the Thirty Years' War, was however open to a peaceful solution. Władysław could not go against the decision of the Sejm and Senate, and agreed to support the treaty. Thus both sides agreed to sign the Armistice of Stuhmsdorf (Sztumska Wieś) on 12 September 1635, favourable to the Commonwealth, which regained the Prussian territories, and called for a reduction of the Swedish tolls on the maritime trade.|$|E
5|$|In 1966, Joel E. Goldmacher and Joseph A. Castellano, {{research}} chemists in Heilmeier {{group at}} RCA, discovered that mixtures made exclusively of nematic compounds that differed {{only in the}} number of carbon atoms in the terminal side chains <b>could</b> <b>yield</b> room-temperature nematic liquid crystals. A ternary mixture of Schiff base compounds resulted in a material that had a nematic range of 22–105°C. Operation at room temperature enabled the first practical display device to be made. The team then proceeded to prepare numerous mixtures of nematic compounds many of which had much lower melting points. This technique of mixing nematic compounds to obtain wide operating temperature range eventually became the industry standard and is used to this very day to tailor materials to meet specific applications.|$|E

Also, we will show that we have a semantic situation which no syntactical logical system could support that. In the end, we propose a claim as a question.

5|$|Other Spanish ports {{were also}} {{blockaded}} {{with the intention}} of limiting Spanish trade and movement and intercepting treasure convoys from the colonies of New Spain and South America. Vast quantities of gold, silver and valuable trade goods crossed the Atlantic in regular armed frigate convoys. To intercept and seize these shipments the Royal Navy dispatched their own frigates to patrol the Spanish coast. To encourage their sailors, the Royal Navy distributed prize money to the value of the ships and material captured and the seizure of a Spanish treasure fleet <b>could</b> <b>yield</b> spectacular amounts of money: particularly large sums had been captured during previous wars in 1656, 1744 and 1762, but during {{the first three years of}} conflict between Great Britain and Spain only one treasure convoy had been intercepted, near Cádiz at the Action of 26 April 1797, and on that occasion the treasure was smuggled ashore before the convoy was seized.|$|E
5|$|The Hungarian {{physicist}} Leó Szilárd, who {{was living}} in the United States at the time, realized that the neutron-driven fission of heavy atoms could be used to create a nuclear chain reaction that <b>could</b> <b>yield</b> vast amounts of energy for electric power generation or atomic bombs. Such a reaction using neutrons was an idea he had first formulated in 1933, upon reading Ernest Rutherford's disparaging remarks about generating power from his team's 1932 experiment using protons to split lithium. However, Szilárd {{had not been able to}} achieve a neutron-driven chain reaction with neutron-rich light atoms. In theory, if in a neutron-driven chain reaction the number of secondary neutrons produced was greater than one, then each such reaction could trigger multiple additional reactions, producing an exponentially increasing number of reactions.|$|E

40|$|Alfalfa can be {{produced}} with less water, but less water <b>could</b> reduce <b>yields.</b> Yield {{is directly related to}} crop evapotranspiration, and less water could decrease evapotranspiration. Maximum <b>yield</b> <b>could</b> be obtained with less water by increasing irrigation efficiency through better irrigation scheduling and improved irrigation systems. In some cases, however, regulated deficit irrigation of alfalfa might improve profit during those times when yield per unit of applied water is low compared to continuous irrigation. Regulated deficit irrigation involves reducing or terminating irrigations during those times...|$|R

25|$|Yet another {{attractive}} {{alternative is}} {{the increased use}} of seaweed. Seaweed provides essential minerals and vitamins for growing organisms. It offers the advantage of providing natural amounts of dietary fiber and having a lower glycemic load than grain-based fish meal. In the best-case scenario, widespread use of seaweed <b>could</b> <b>yield</b> a future in aquaculture that eliminates the need for land, freshwater, or fertilizer to raise fish.|$|E

25|$|Many {{experts have}} {{suggested}} that establishing mechanisms to coordinate care for the dual-eligibles <b>could</b> <b>yield</b> substantial savings in the Medicare program, mostly by reducing hospitalizations.

The general ethos of these proposals is to “treat the patient, not the condition,” and maintain health while avoiding costly treatments.|$|E
25|$|Higher lift allows greater airflow; {{although}} even {{by allowing}} a larger volume of air to pass thru the larger opening, the brevity {{of the typical}} duration with a higher lift cam results in less airflow than with a cam with lower lift but more duration, all else being equal.

Notably though, higher lift has more potential problems than increased duration, in particular as valve train rpm rises which can result in less efficient running or loss of torque.|$|E
