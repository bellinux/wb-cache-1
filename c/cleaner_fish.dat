5|$|Cleaning {{symbiosis}} is {{a mutually}} beneficial association between individuals of two species, where one (the cleaner) removes and eats parasites {{and other materials}} {{from the surface of}} the other (the client). Cleaning symbiosis is well-known among marine fish, where some small species of <b>cleaner</b> <b>fish,</b> notably wrasses but also species in other genera, are specialised to feed almost exclusively by cleaning larger fish and other marine animals. Other cleaning symbioses exist between birds and mammals, and in other groups.|$|E
5|$|Mimicry of mutualistic {{species is}} seen in coral reef fish, where the models, certain <b>cleaner</b> <b>fish,</b> are greatly {{disadvantaged}} {{by the presence of}} the mimic. <b>Cleaner</b> <b>fish</b> are the allies of many other species, which allow them to eat their parasites and dead skin in a mutually beneficial cleaning symbiosis. Some allow the cleaner to venture inside their mouths and gill cavities to hunt these parasites. However, one species of cleaner, the bluestreak cleaner wrasse (Labroides dimidiatus), is the unknowing model of a mimetic species, the sabre-toothed blenny (Aspidontus taeniatus). This wrasse, shown in the image cleaning a grouper of the genus Epinephelus, resides in coral reefs in the Indian and the Pacific Oceans, and is recognized by other fishes who then allow it to clean them. Its imposter, a species of blenny, lives in the Indian Ocean and not only looks like it in terms of size and coloration, but even mimics the cleaner's 'dance'. Having fooled its prey into letting its guard down, it then bites it, tearing off scales or a piece of fin before fleeing the scene. Fish grazed upon in this fashion soon learn to distinguish mimic from model, but because the similarity is close between the two they become much more cautious of the model as well, such that both are affected. Due to victims' ability to discriminate between foe and helper, the blennies have evolved close similarity, right down to the regional level.|$|E

40|$|Cleaning {{behaviour}} by fishes {{has been}} described to be either facultative or specialised.

Moreover, they were significantly more abundant in atolls presenting a large number of sedentary fish species, few predators and few fishes living in large groups.

40|$|Intraspecific {{cooperation}} and interspecific mutualism often feature an asymmetry in the scope for exploitation.

We show that when actors vary in state over time, in a manner that influences the potential gains from exploitation, an equilibrium is possible at which recipients avoid actors whom they have observed exploiting others in the past, and actors help when the potential gains from exploitation are low but choose to exploit when the potential gains are high. In this context, helping is favoured not because it elicits reciprocal altruism (‘help so that you may be helped’), but because it facilitates profitable exploitation (‘help so that you may gain the opportunity to harm’). The cost of helping one recipient is thereby recouped through exploitation of another. Indirect reciprocity is thus possible even in asymmetric interactions in which one party cannot directly ‘punish’ exploitation or ‘reward’ helping by the other...|$|R

40|$|Cleaning {{symbiosis}} {{has been}} documented extensively in the marine environment over the past 50 years. We estimate global cleaner diversity comprises 208 fish species from 106 genera representing 36 families and 51 shrimp species from 11 genera representing six families. Cleaning symbiosis as originally defined is amended to highlight communication between client and cleaner as the catalyst for cooperation and to separate cleaning symbiosis from incidental cleaning, which is a separate mutualism preceded by no communication. Moreover, we propose the term 2 ̆ 7 dedicated 2 ̆ 7 to replace 2 ̆ 7 obligate 2 ̆ 7 to describe a committed cleaning lifestyle. Marine <b>cleaner</b> <b>fishes</b> have dominated the cleaning symbiosis literature, with comparatively little focus given to shrimp. The engagement of shrimp in cleaning activities has been considered contentious because there is little empirical evidence.

Caution is expressed in the use of grey literature and anecdotal observations to generate data on cleaning interactions, due to the presence of species complexes. Interest in cleaning organisms as biological controls in aquaculture is increasing due to their value as an alternative to various chemical ectoparasite controls. Reports of the importance of cleaner organisms in maintaining a healthy reef ecosystem has also been increasing and we review the current biological knowledge on cleaner organisms, highlighting areas that are understudied...|$|R

40|$|Abstract The {{preferences}} {{exhibited by}} <b>cleaner</b> <b>fishes</b> for particular client species {{and the high}} variability in rates at which various clients visit cleaning stations have remained largely unexplained. In this study, we assessed {{the relative importance of}} client ectoparasite load and mucus characteristics for the behaviour of cleaning gob-ies, Elacatinus spp, and their fish clients on a Barbadian fringing reef. Client species with high ectoparasite loads visited cleaning stations more often than less parasitised species. This effect was independent of body size. Fre-quency of visits to cleaning stations was not related to client mucus characteristics. These results suggest that the main motivation for clients to interact with cleaners is ectoparasite removal. Cleaners did not preferentially clean clients with higher ectoparasite load or better mu-cus, nor did they spend more time inspecting such cli-ents. The interests of cleaners and clients therefore ap-pear to be inconsistent. This {{may be due to the}} generally low rate of ectoparasitism on Barbadian fish compared to fish of other regions. Cleaning gobies fed at a lower rate on client species with higher loads of gnathiid isopod larvae, which may be explained if cleaners switch from eating ectoparasites to other items, such as mucus, on clients with few ectoparasites. Our estimates of caloric and protein content of fish mucus suggest that it may be as valuable a food source per unit weight as ectopara-sites. However, no data are available to compare the val-ue of each item per unit feeding time. The fact that cli-ents with few ectoparasites still visit cleaners, albeit at a low rate, suggests that the cost of mucus removal may be low, compared to the benefit of incidental parasite re-moval. Thus, the outcome of cleaning interactions may remain positive, even in areas characterised by naturally low parasitism on clients...|$|R
40|$|The blood-feeding {{juvenile}} {{stages of}} gnathiid isopods are important ectoparasites of marine fishes on the Great Barrier Reef (GBR), {{and are a}} major component of the diet of <b>cleaner</b> <b>fishes.</b> We report here that these gnathiids have undergone evolutionary diversification, both geographically and temporally (into diurnally and nocturnally active taxa), which has been accompanied by changes in their morphology and behaviour. To perform this analysis, we sequenced a portion of the nuclear ribosomal ITS 2 for 47 gnathiids collected from 29 host fishes of 11 species at three locales spanning 2000 km on the GBR. Maximum parsimony and Bayesian phylogenetic analyses both revealed four major clades. There was some degree of geographical structuring in these clades, but there was no evidence supporting host fish specialization, as gnathiids collected from the skin of different teleost taxa did not resolve into distinct clades. The topology of the phylogeny also implied some structuring that was dependent upon collection time (day or night), so we investigated whether there were also behavioural and morphological differences between taxa active at these different times. Nocturnal gnathiids had significantly longer antennules and larger eyes than diurnal gnathiids – two traits presumably adaptive for nocturnal activity. Behavioural tests showed that both nocturnal and diurnal gnathiids use olfaction and vision while foraging, but that nocturnal gnathiids used olfaction more often in dark conditions, and {{that they were able to}} perceive movement under extremely low levels of light. Diurnal gnathiids used vision more effectively when there was some ambient light. Our results thus suggest that both phenotypic and genotypic divergence in gnathiids may be influenced by natural selection acting on ecological traits, such as predator avoidance and host detection. © 2008 The Linnean Society of London, Biological Journal of the Linnean Society, 2008, 94, 569 – 587.
