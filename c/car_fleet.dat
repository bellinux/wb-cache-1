5|$|The {{importance}} {{to build the}} infrastructure necessary to support electric vehicles {{is illustrated by the}} decision of Car2Go in San Diego, California, that due to insufficient charging infrastructure decided to replace all of its all-electric <b>car</b> <b>fleet</b> with gasoline-powered cars starting on 1 May 2016. When the carsharing service started in 2011, Car2Go expected 1,000 charging stations to be deployed around the city, but only 400 were in place by early 2016. As a result, an average of 20% of the carsharing fleet is unavailable at any given time because the cars are either being charged or because they don’t have enough electricity in them to be driven. Also, many of the company’s 40,000 San Diego members say they often worry their Car2Go will run out of charge before they finish their trip.|$|E

40|$|International audienceCorporate <b>car</b> <b>fleets</b> {{account for}} 16 % of all {{light-duty}} vehicles in France, and about 25 % {{of their total}} CO 2 emissions. They also account for 40 % of new light-duty vehicle sales, and close to 50 % of new battery-electric vehicle sales. Yet, the environmental performance of corporate vehicles differs widely between passenger cars and light commercial vehicles. The former are heavily taxed based on their CO 2 emissions under both, the ‘malus’ scheme (environmental penalty upon initial registration) and the TVS scheme (annual circulation tax), whereas the latter are exempt from all CO 2 -based taxes. On the other hand, both passenger cars and light commercial vehicles in corporate <b>car</b> <b>fleets</b> are eligible to the ‘bonus’ scheme (environmental incentive upon initial registration), and to the registration tax rebates for alternative-fuel vehicles. This paper discusses the influence of tax policy on the CO 2 emission levels of, and demand for alternative-fuel vehicles by, corporate <b>car</b> <b>fleets</b> in France. We present the main tax schemes that have a probable influence on the choices of corporations {{with regards to the}} CO 2 emission levels and drivetrain technology of the vehicles they purchase and use (past and present terms and conditions: scope, tax base, etc.), based on a historical review of tax policies. Besides, we provide a preliminary assessment of the expected effectiveness of the various tax schemes listed, based on the magnitude of the costs (or benefits) they impose on corporations, using a TCO (total costs of ownership) approach. Finally, we discuss the similarities and differences in the terms and conditions of the schemes reviewed, and the relative strength of their incentive effects on corporate <b>car</b> <b>fleets.</b> Through unravelling the complexity of the tax policy framework, we highlight several challenges pertaining to the lack of legibility and/or consistency among tax schemes, and the existence of inertia, which hinder the effectiveness of tax policy in fostering the uptake of low-emission vehicles by corporate <b>car</b> <b>fleets.</b> We argue for an overhaul of the tax policy framework that applies to corporate <b>car</b> <b>fleets,</b> which would provide an opportunity to clarify the objectives of policy-makers with regards to the environmental impacts of fleets, and to design more efficient policies (tax or otherwise) ...|$|R

25|$|As of 2011, {{most of the}} U.S. <b>car</b> <b>fleet</b> {{was able}} to run on blends of up to 10% ethanol, and motor vehicle {{manufacturers}} produced vehicles designed to run on more concentrated blends. As of 2015, seven states – Missouri, Minnesota, Louisiana, Montana, Oregon, Pennsylvania, and Washington – required ethanol to be blended with gasoline in motor fuels. These states, particularly Minnesota, had more ethanol usage, and {{according to a source}} at Washington University, these states accumulated substantial environmental and economic benefits as a result. Florida required ethanol blends as of the end of 2010, but has since repealed it. Many cities had separate ethanol requirements due to non-attainment of federal air quality standards. In 2007, Portland, Oregon, became the first U.S. city to require all gasoline sold within city limits to contain at least 10% ethanol. Chicago has proposed the idea of mandating E15 in the city limits, while some area gas stations have already begun offering it.|$|E

500|$|WMATA {{first became}} aware of a rail car {{shortage}} in 1988. Generally, rail cars were ready for service {{three to four years}} after WMATA signed [...] a contract for their purchase. Metrorail also suffered from internal squabbling over rail car design, and rail car production had historically been plagued by poor quality and labor strikes—both of which also added to construction delays. Although WMATA knew in 1988 that it needed at least 98 new rail cars to provide adequate service to the new stations to be added on the Green Line and other lines by 1993, WMATA did not place an order for the cars. By September 1990, WMATA was also confronting more frequent breakdowns in its existing, aging rail <b>car</b> <b>fleet,</b> which heightened the urgency to buy more cars. Officials estimated that the rail car shortage would become critical when the Anacostia Station opened. When the Van Dorn Street Station opened in June 1991, Metro was forced to run trains every 12 minutes during rush hour rather than every 8 due to the rail car shortage. Eventually, crowding was addressed when additional cars became available by running 8-car trains.|$|E
