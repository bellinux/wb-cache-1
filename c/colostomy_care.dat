40|$|Present {{situation}} This bachelor thesis {{deals with}} nursing care of colostomy, namely from patients' point of view. The theoretical part {{focuses on the}} anatomy of colon and rectum. The chapter Stoma explains this term. The thesis also contains chapters dealing {{with the history of}} stomas and the history of their treatment. It is useful to know what the care looked like in the history and what it looks like now to gain comprehensive insight. The part dedicated to the indication of colostomy application is important as well, because there is not just one reason but more. The necessity of surgery is logically linked to the indication. Another chapter thus deals with pre- and post-surgery care and also mentions the differences from "normal" pre surgery preparation. Poor post-surgery care may lead to various complications of stomas particularly early complications in the post surgery stage. Later complications are mostly caused by poor care after longer time from the operation. This is why the proper education by a stoma nurse is necessary. One of the next chapters, stoma nurse and her role deals with the main tasks of a stoma nurse. Stoma aids also form an inseparable part of colostomy treatment. This aids are divided into a one-piece system and a two-piece system, and various accessories are also worth mentioning. There are of course small differences in replacement of the one-piece and the two-piece system, which are mentioned in the chapter replacement of the one-piece system and the two-piece system. Proper nutrition and water intake are important part of colostomy treatment. This chapter explains proper and improper habits and food. The last chapter of the thesis deals with the clubs of ostomists as these are able to help a patient cope with the stoma. Goals of the thesis and research questions Goal 1 : To find the differences between the nursing care provided by a stoma nurse and a nurse from a standard ward. Goal 2 : To find how a patient copes with colostomy treatment after being released to home care. Research question 1 : What activities does a stoma nurse perform within <b>colostomy</b> <b>care?</b> Research question 2 : What activities does a standard ward nurse perform within <b>colostomy</b> <b>care?</b> Research question 3 : What problems does a patient face in colostomy treatment in home environment? Research question 4 : What knowledge was a patient given before being released to home care? Results The results have shown that the main role of a stoma nurse is based on patient education. A worrying finding was that there had been insufficient education before the operation. As for the nutritional information, each patient was informed to different extent, some were not informed at all. The information on complications seems to be sufficient, the nurse informed the patients on the basic possible complications. The standard ward nurse most often redressed the post-surgery wound within <b>colostomy</b> <b>care</b> and asked about pain and administered painkillers. As of direct <b>colostomy</b> <b>care</b> she changed the pouch or the flange. The respondents however often mentioned that she was not experienced enough in their responses. When the nurse changed the pouch, she always check whether the colostomy was draining, how much stool was in the pouch, she checked and treated the colostomy surrounding and the colostomy itself. The standard ward nurse did not teach the patient any new skills, only the stoma nurse taught them. None of the respondents has faced any serious complications yet. Respondents of higher age have problems with cutting the hole in the flange. Before the end of hospitalization all the respondents were provided with comprehensive information on colostomy treatment and the nurse checked whether they do it properly. All the respondents were also given contact...|$|E
40|$|Aim. This {{article is}} a report of a {{descriptive}} study {{of the effectiveness of}} classroom teaching by clinical nurse specialists on students' transfer of theory into practice. Background. Ongoing concern about a theory-practice merger in nursing has led to collaborative initiatives between academics and practitioners globally. There are different forms of collaborative efforts, but information on their evaluation is scarce and inconclusive. Integration of theory and practice is important for an outcome-based approach, which emphasizes students' clinical competence as the measure of success. The limited nursing discussion on theory and practice collaboration in education was our impetus for the study. Methods. Between 2007 and 2008, focus group interviews were held, first with 75 and then with 35 from the same group of first-year students, regarding their learning experience from the lectures of the two clinical nurse specialists in diabetes and <b>colostomy</b> <b>care,</b> respectively, prior to and after their clinical placements. Six of their clinical instructors and the two clinical nurse specialists were also interviewed. The audiotaped interviews were transcribed verbatim and analysed using content analysis. Findings. Three themes were identified: impact of students' vicarious learning from clinical nurse specialists' stories of experience; improving the collaboration between clinical nurse specialists and subject lecturers for junior students' learning experience; continuity in the clinical integration of theory-practice as dialectic through an interplay between academics, practitioners and students. Conclusion. The theory and practice issue is best addressed as a triadic paradigm in a community of practice with the collaboration among academics, practitioners and students.

40|$|Context: Care {{of a child}} having {{colostomy}} has {{not been}} institutionalized {{for a long time}} for economic and administrative reasons. After stoma formation, stoma care has to be provided to the child by caregivers at home. Hence, caregivers need to be provided with ongoing education and support, commencing from preoperative teaching to discharge from the hospital and home care. Aims: The aims of this study were to develop video-based learning resource material and to evaluate its effectiveness in terms of knowledge and skill attainment by caregivers. Settings and Design: The study design was time series, one group pretest and post test. This was conducted among 30 caregivers attending pediatric surgery outpatients and indoor departments of a tertiary level care center. Materials and Methods: A video teaching program (VTP) related to pediatric colostomy was developed and used to teach the caregivers about <b>colostomy</b> <b>care.</b> Pretested and validated knowledge questionnaire, observational checklist, and stoma assessment scale (SAS) were used to assess the knowledge and skills of caregivers before and after the administration of VTP immediately (post test 1) after and 2 weeks (post test 2) after the intervention. Statistical Analysis Used: Repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA), Bonferroni correction, Mann-Whitney U test, and Kruskal-Wallis test were used. Results: There were significant increases in knowledge (from 10. 9 ± 2. 5 to 16. 4 ± 1. 67 and 15. 9 ± 4. 02, P = 0. 001, maximum score 20) and skill scores as assessed by the observation checklist (from 5. 6 ± 2. 0 to 9. 8 ± 1. 6 and 8. 6 ± 2. 1, P = 0. 001, maximum score 12) immediately after and 2 weeks after the VTP. However, a decline in skills was observed at 2 weeks when compared with immediate scores, as measured by the observation checklist. There was no significant increase in the skill scores of caregivers as measured by SAS at 2 weeks compared to the immediate scores. Conclusion: The VTP was effective in bringing about an increase in the knowledge and skill of caregivers of children having colostomy. Therefore, video can be utilized for the counselling of caregivers of children with colostomy...|$|E
40|$|Objective: to {{describe}} {{the importance of the}} individual changes caused by the need to perform a colostomy, and the importance of nursing care. Methodology: this study is a literature review, with selection of articles published from 1999 to 2009, in national journals, in databases SciELO, LILACS and the Ministry of Health, using the following terms to search: <b>colostomy</b> nursing <b>care,</b> adaptation. The papers were cataloged and analyzed, trying to summarize what the authors put on the physiological, behavioral, emotional and social changes that occur after the intervention, for which it is necessary that the person is re-structured in order to maintain their physical and emotional. Results: the need to broaden the focus of work of professionals who deal with colostomy patients, in order to go beyond the individual's biological body and include an understanding of references adopted by those involved in the process. Conclusion: should implement systematic interventions, since the diagnosis of the disease, following all the stages of life of people in order to contribute to a better acceptance of the changes caused by colostomy and promote an improvement in their quality of life...|$|R
40|$|Theoretical Basis Demographic {{data show}} that the world's {{population}} has been aging {{and there are more}} and more elderly people who need health and social care. The same situation is in our country. Every person lives his/her life in a unique way. With aging changes occur in physical, mental and social aspects. To cope with them requires help, tolerance, respect and patience shown by other people. The current forms of care for seniors are carried out in health facilities, social facilities as well as families. The changes bring about the need to find a new way of life. The most frequent changes occur in self-care which results in increased demands on the care of other people. Some seniors do not need almost any services and some are dependent on permanent comprehensive care. Definitely, the best way for seniors is living at home with the support of their families and the cooperation with home care agencies when health care is necessary. Everyday nursing care for seniors depends on the degree of their self-sufficiency and is extremely challenging. Caring for seniors is often complicated by changes in the behavior of seniors in communication, aggressiveness, disorientation caused by today's relentlessness and memory disorders. Caring for immobile seniors also places an enormous physical strain on nurses. Aims of the Study In this thesis, one goal was set, that is to survey the activities of nurses in nursing care for seniors in selected health care facilities, home care agencies and nursing homes. Methods Used in the Study In the empirical part of this thesis the qualitative research method of observation was used to conduct the research survey. The research survey was conducted through observation, in which the frequency of nursing activities was observed, and the time consumption of selected nursing activities (recording nursing documentation, intramuscular injection administration, subcutaneous injection administration, insulin administration with an insulin pen, capillary blood collection, venous blood collection, a planet urinary catheter insertion in women, blood pressure taking, blood sugar levels testing using a glucometer and <b>colostomy</b> <b>care)</b> were recorded into pre-prepared observation sheets (Appendix 2) and (Appendix 3) in the Home care Agency in České Budějovice from May 1 to July 5, 2013, in the Home for Seniors in České Budějovice from July 8 to July 12, 2013 and in České Budějovice Hospital, plc, in the Aftercare department from July 22 to July 26, 2013. The data sheet with activities when time measurements were carried out was compiled based on a preliminary research, when all the mentioned facilities were visited beforehand to find out which activities were carried out in all the facilities where the research study was conducted. A digital stopwatch was used for measurements. The time measurements are stated in units of time rounded up to the nearest minute. Each nursing activity was measured from its preparation through implementation to completion. Observations were carried out eight hours a day, 5 days a week in each facility. Overall, 160 hours for 3 weeks. Observations were conducted during regular operating hours in the facilities; every day one nurse treating fifteen seniors in each facility was observed. The frequency of nursing activities and the measured values were statistically processed - summed, averaged, and standard deviations were calculated. Results of the Thesis The analysis of the data implies differences in nursing activities carried out by nurses in particular facilities and the time measurements show time differences between particular facilities in nursing activities performance. The goals of this thesis were achieved after the research investigation and the research questions were answered...|$|E
40|$|Surgical {{procedures}} of gastrointestinal diseases {{often lead to}} the creation of an ostomy. The number of clients with an ostomy is increasing as the Czech Republic ranks among the countries with the largest incidence of malignant colon disease. Health care professionals in any field can often encounter the client with a stoma. Therefore, it is essential for them to understand and manage this issue well. Nursing care of such individuals is very extensive and specialized. Nursing team usually focuses only on physical care but other problems associated with stomas are pushed aside. The only highly knowledgeable and qualified expert in this area is a stoma nurse specialist (an ostomy nurse). This thesis deals with the importance {{of the role of the}} stoma nurse specialist in the postoperative phase from the perspective of nurses from surgical departments as well as from the perspective of patients with a colostomy. The thesis is divided into theoretical and empirical part. The theoretical part is further divided into four chapters: <b>colostomy,</b> <b>care</b> about stoma patients, life with a colostomy, an ostomy nurse. Two objectives were determined for processing of the empirical part. We used a combination of quantitative and qualitative research to achieve our goals. The first objective was to determine whether general nurses have the knowledge to care for a client with colostomy in the postoperative phase. To obtain data for the quantitative part of the survey the method of anonymous interviews using a questionnaire, in which the research group was formed by general nurses, was selected. The survey results revealed that nurses have sufficient knowledge to treat and educate clients with a stoma. Although not all general nurses encounter colostomy patients, they widely believe the knowledge of this issue is important for the occupation of a nurse. For the quantitative part three hypotheses were selected and tested statistically. Hypothesis 1 : General nurses have the knowledge to treat the client with a colostomy. It was confirmed. Hypothesis 2 : General nurses have enough knowledge to educate the client with a colostomy. It was confirmed. Hypothesis 3 : General nurses positively evaluate the benefits of an ostomy nurse in care for stoma patients in the postoperative phase in the surgical department. It was confirmed. The second objective was to determine the significance of the stoma nurse for clients with a colostomy. For the qualitative part of the survey the method of direct questioning by means of a semi-structured interview with open questions was chosen. The study group consisted of patients with a colostomy. For this part of the survey a research questions was specified: What is the importance of an ostomy nurse for the stoma patient in the postoperative period? We concluded that the ostomy nurse is viewed as an educator, counselor and psychological support. The ostomy nurse is the only one who can provide stoma clients with coherent and comprehensive information they need to live with a colostomy. Both groups of respondents agree that the stoma nurse is the irreplaceable specialist. Shift nurses fail to provide comprehensive care stoma patients need. An ostomy nurse needs to be a part of nursing care not only in the postoperative phase, but also in the preoperative period. There is need for closer cooperation between general nurses and the ostomy nurse. Nurses indicate their willingness to be educated in this area, while preferring seminars, lectures and conferences. The results also led us to create information material Care of the client with colostomy, as the nurses indicated that they would welcome a brief, clear, visual information material...|$|E
