In case of a quench detection, protection heaters will be activated to drive the magnet to theresistive state. In addition, the magnet will be protected by a bypass diode. In order to limit quench propagation, the excitation current is ramped down at an initial rate of 113 A/s and with a time constant equal to 104 s. When a busbar quenches, its temperature must stay below safe values. Comparative measurements of a hollow and a solid busbar were performed in 1. 9 K superfluid helium, 4. 2 K liquid helium and 4. 2 K gaseous helium during the <b>current</b> <b>ramp</b> <b>down.</b> We describe the experimental set-up and report the results.

40|$|In limiter H-modes of JIPP T-IIU, a {{new type}} of L-H {{transition}} preceded by an ELM is observed. The preceding ELM (pre-ELM) appears just prior to the L-H transition. This type of transition is usually observed in H-modes of JIPP T-IIU. The L-H transition without the pre-ELM is triggered only in the case when a sufficiently large rapid <b>current</b> <b>ramp</b> <b>down</b> is emploied. In H-modes with constant q(a) ~ 3. 5 - 4. 5, coherent magnetic oscillations with m= 3 /n= 1 destabilized during L-phase are further enhanced at the pre-ELM, and suppressed suddenly at the transition. This mode is situated in the region of the transport barrier. Propagation frequency of the m= 3 /n= 1 mode, which may be affected by plasma mass rotation, rises appreciably (by ~ 10 %) during H-phase with frequent ELMs, but remains unchanged for at least 200 mu s after the transition. Behaviours of the m= 3 /n= 1 and m= 2 /n= 1 modes are well explained by quasi-linear resistive tearing mode analysis for modelled toroidal current density profiles slightly detached from the limiter. These experimental results suggest that the transition is controlled by the change of a magnetic field structure relating to the modification of a toroidal current density profile near the edge. The possibility for the development of edge radial electric field {{as a consequence of the}} transition is discussed. ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. H-modes {{operated}} {{at higher}} li with the <b>current</b> <b>ramp</b> <b>down</b> have shown higher energy confinement with higher density in JT- 60 U. The H-factor evaluated for the core plasma depends strongly on li with {{the relation of}} H 89 core ∝ li 0. 77 for the case without sawtooth activities. Center peaked profiles of electron density and electron temperature are obtained in high li H-modes. While the peripheral current density profiles are largely modified by the current ramp, the pedestal pressure is not significantly changed. The enhanced energy confinement in high li H-modes is attributed to the core improvement with the peaked profiles of electron density and electron temperature while no explicit difference in pedestal profile is observed. The electron heat diffusivity is reduced at the plasma core in high li case, resulting in the center peaked Te profile while the Ti profiles are approximately unchanged. In addition, {{the characteristics of the}} spatial width Δped of the H-mode pedestal are investigated in hydrogen and deuterium plasmas in JT- 60 U. Similar edge profiles of the ion temperature are obtained for both cases while ρ*pol is not fixed but differs by a factor of ~ 1. 4 (which is the square root of the mass ratio). This result suggests a weak dependence of Δped on ρ*pol. Based on these dimensionless parameter scans, the scaling was evaluated as Δped ∝ aρ*pol 0. 2 βpol 0. 5. 1...|$|E
40|$|A {{high-speed}} {{imaging system}} with shutter speeds {{as fast as}} 2 ns and double frame capability {{has been used to}} directly image the formation and evolution of the sustained spheromak physics experiment (SSPX) [E. B. Hooper et al., Nucl. Fusion 39, 863 (1999) ]. Reproducible plasma features have been identified with this diagnostic and divided into three groups, according to the stage in the discharge at which they occur: (i) breakdown and ejection, (ii) sustainment, and (iii) decay. During the first stage, plasma descends into the flux conserver shortly after breakdown and a transient plasma column is formed. The column then rapidly bends and simultaneously becomes too dim to photograph a few microseconds after formation. It is conjectured here that this rapid bending precedes the transfer of toroidal to poloidal flux. During sustainment, a stable plasma column different from the transient one is observed. It has been possible to measure the column diameter and compare it to CORSICA [A. Tarditi et al., Contrib. Plasma Phys. 36, 132 (1996) ], a magnetohydrodynamic equilibrium reconstruction code which showed good agreement with the measurements. Elongation and velocity measurements were made of cathode patterns also seen during this stage, possibly caused by pressure gradients or E×B drifts. The patterns elongate in a toroidal-only direction which depends on the magnetic-field polarity. During the decay stage the column diameter expands as the <b>current</b> <b>ramps</b> <b>down,</b> until it eventually dissolves into filaments. With the use of magnetic probes inserted in the gun region, an X point which moved axially depending on current level and toroidal mode number was observed in all the stages of the SSPX plasma discharge...|$|R
40|$|The lower hybrid {{current drive}} (LHCD) system on Alcator C-Mod {{is capable of}} {{sustaining}} fully non-inductive discharges for multiple current relaxation times (τcr ∼ 200 ms) at line averaged densities {{in the range of}} 5 x 1019 m- 3. Some of these non-inductive discharges develop unstable MHD modes that can greatly reduce current drive performance, particularly in discharges with plasma current of 0. 5 MA or less [1, 2]. Avoiding these unstable MHD modes motivated an experiment to test if the stable current profile shape of a higher current non-inductive discharge could be achieved in a lower current discharge. Starting from a discharge at 0. 8 MA, the plasma <b>current</b> was <b>ramped</b> <b>down</b> to 0. 5 MA over 200 ms. The surface voltage of the plasma swings negative during the ramp, with the loop voltage reversal impacting the edge fast electron measurements immediately. Little change can be seen during the Ip ramp in the core fast electron measurements, indicating that the loop voltage reversal does not penetrate fully to the magnetic axis on the timescale of the <b>current</b> <b>ramp.</b> The resulting discharge did not exhibit deleterious MHD instabilities, however the existence of this one discharge does not necessarily represent a robust solution to the problem...|$|R
40|$|The Advanced Tokamak plasma {{configuration}} {{has significant}} {{potential for the}} economical production of fusion power. Research on various tokamak experiments are pursuing these plasmas to establish high {beta}, high bootstrap current fraction, 100 % noninductive current, and good energy confinement, in a quasi-stationary state. One candidate is the flat q discharge produced in DIII-D, where the safety factor varies from 2. 0 on axis, to slightly below 2. 0 at the minimum, and then rises to about 3. 5 at the 95 % surface. This plasma is prototypical of those studied for power plants in the ARIES tokamak studies. The plasma is produced by ramping up the plasma <b>current</b> and <b>ramping</b> <b>down</b> the toroidal field throughout the discharge. The plasma current reaches 1. 65 MA, and the toroidal field goes from 2. 25 to 1. 6 T. The q{sub min} remains high and at large radius, {rho} {approx} 0. 6.

40|$|The tilt-casting {{method is}} used to achieve {{tranquil}} filling of gamma-TiAl turbine blades. The reactive alloy is melted in a cold crucible using an induction coil and then the complete crucible-mould- running system assembly is rotated through 180 degrees to transfer the metal into the mould. The induction <b>current</b> is <b>ramped</b> <b>down</b> gradually as the rotation starts and the mould is preheated to maintain superheat. The liquid metal then enters the mould and the gas within it (argon) escapes through the inlet aperture and through auxiliary vents. Solidification starts as soon the metal enters the mould {{and it is important}} to account for this effect to predict and prevent misruns. The rotation rate has to be controlled carefully to allow sufficient time for gas evacuation, {{but at the same time}} preserve superheat.

The fast wave frequency (60 MHz) was eight times the deuterium cyclotron frequency at the plasma center. An array of rf pickup loops at several locations around the torus was used to verify the directivity of the four-element antenna.

For discharges with steady plasma current, up to 110 kA of FWCD was inferred from an analysis of the loop voltage, with a maximum non-inductive current (FWCD, ECCD, and bootstrap) of 195 out of 310 kA. The FWCD efficiency increased linearly with central electron temperature. For low current discharges, the FWCD efficiency was degraded due to incomplete fast wave damping. The experimental FWCD was found to agree with predictions from the CURRAY ray-tracing code only when a parasitic loss of 4 % per pass was included in the modeling along with multiple pass damping...|$|R

They include the plasma breakdown at low loop voltage, the current rise phase, the performance during the flat top (FT) phase and a <b>ramp</b> <b>down</b> of the plasma. The ITER discharge evolution has been verified in dedicated experiments. New data are obtained from C-Mod, ASDEX Upgrade, DIII-D, JT- 60 U and JET. Results show that breakdown for E-axis < 0. 23 - 0. 33 V m(- 1) is possible unassisted (ohmic) for large devices like JET and attainable in devices with a capability of using ECRH assist. For the <b>current</b> <b>ramp</b> up, good control of the plasma inductance is obtained using a full bore plasma shape with early X-point formation. This allows optimization of the flux usage from the PF set. Additional heating keeps l(i) (3) < 0. 85 during the ramp up to q(95) = 3. A rise phase with an H-mode transition is capable of achieving l(i) (3) < 0. 7 {{at the start of the}} FT. Operation of the H-mode reference scenario at q(95) similar to 3 and the hybrid scenario at q(95) = 4 - 4. 5 during the FT phase is documented, providing data for the l(i) (3) evolution after the H-mode transition and the li (3) evolution after a back-transition to L-mode.

This paper proposes microarchitectural techniques to reduce high-frequency current variability, reducing the need for decoupling capacitors.

Strong stabilising effect of βe on the ITG turbulence has been found, but the transport reduction due to this effect can be limited by the onset of the KBM mode at high βe. The simulations of toroidal rotation in HS with the GLF 23 model give an indication of the toroidal momentum pinch (Pr< 1). Use of H-mode parameters in the GLF 23 and BgB models results in the over-peaking of the density profile while the temperatures are sufficiently accurately predicted.
