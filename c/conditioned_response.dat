To counteract this, some styles allow students to become less compliant over time but, {{in keeping with the}} core philosophies, this is after having demonstrated proficiency in being able to protect themselves and their training partners. Shodokan Aikido addresses the issue by practising in a competitive format. Such adaptations are debated between styles, with some maintaining that {{there is no need to}} adjust their methods because either the criticisms are unjustified, or that they are not training for self-defense or combat effectiveness, but spiritual, fitness or other reasons.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the most}} {{extensively}} studied cerebellar learning tasks is the eyeblink conditioning paradigm, in which a neutral conditioned stimulus (CS) such as a tone or a light is repeatedly paired with an unconditioned stimulus (US), such as an air puff, that elicits a blink response. After such repeated presentations of the CS and US, the CS will eventually elicit a blink before the US, a <b>conditioned</b> <b>response</b> or CR. Experiments showed that lesions localized either to a specific part of the interposed nucleus (one of the deep cerebellar nuclei) or to a few specific points in the cerebellar cortex would abolish learning of a conditionally timed blink response. If cerebellar outputs are pharmacologically inactivated while leaving the inputs and intracellular circuits intact, learning takes place even while the animal fails to show any response, whereas, if intracerebellar circuits are disrupted, no learning takes place—these facts taken together make a strong case that the learning, indeed, occurs inside the cerebellum.|$|E
25|$|Respondent (classical) {{conditioning}} {{is based}} on innate stimulus-response relationships called reflexes. In his famous experiments with dogs, Pavlov usually used the salivary reflex, namely salivation (unconditioned response) following the taste of food (unconditioned stimulus). Pairing a neutral stimulus, for example a bell (conditioned stimulus) with food caused the bell to elicit salivation (<b>conditioned</b> <b>response).</b> Thus, in classical conditioning, the conditioned stimulus becomes a signal for a biologically significant consequence. Note that in respondent conditioning, unlike operant conditioning, the response does not produce a reinforcer or punisher (e.g. the dog does not get food because it salivates).|$|E

25|$|In {{classical}} (or respondent) conditioning, {{behavior is}} understood as responses triggered by certain environmental or physical stimuli. They can be unconditioned, such as in-born reflexes, or learned through the pairing of an unconditioned stimulus with a different stimulus, which then becomes a conditioned stimulus. In relation to motivation, classical conditioning {{might be seen as}} one explanation as to why an individual performs certain responses and behaviors in certain situations. For instance, a dentist might wonder why a patient does not seem motivated to show up for an appointment, with the explanation being that the patient has associated the dentist (conditioned stimulus) with the pain (unconditioned stimulus) that elicits a fear response (<b>conditioned</b> <b>response),</b> leading to the patient being reluctant to visit the dentist.|$|E
25|$|Classical {{conditioning}} {{is described}} as the pairing of a conditioned stimulus (CS) (such as a vibration) with an unconditioned stimulus (US) (such as a loud noise) to evoke a <b>conditioned</b> <b>response</b> (CR) (agitation). In this pairing, the vibration will be presented immediately followed by a loud noise. Initially, {{the presentation of the}} loud noise (US) would cause the unconditioned response (UR) (natural agitation) without prior classical conditioning. However, the continuous pairing of the loud noise (US) with the vibration (CS) converts the unconditioned response (UR) into a (CR) as the fetus learns that the presentation of a vibration will be followed by a loud noise. Eventually, the fetus will respond to the vibration (CS) without being exposed to the loud noise (US); this is when conditioning has occurred. Conditioning has been demonstrated in as few as 12-15 pairings of the vibration (CS) with the loud noise (US) in fetuses as early as 32 weeks of gestation.|$|E
2500|$|Often {{laboratory}} studies with rats are {{conducted to examine}} the acquisition and extinction of conditioned fear responses. In 2004, researchers conditioned rats (Rattus norvegicus) to fear a certain stimulus, through electric shock. The researchers were able to then cause an extinction of this conditioned fear, {{to a point that}} no medications or drugs were able to further aid in the extinction process. However the rats did show signs of avoidance learning, not fear, but simply avoiding the area that brought pain to the tests rats. The avoidance learning of rats is seen as a <b>conditioned</b> <b>response,</b> and therefore the behavior can be unconditioned, as supported by the earlier research.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present study was to test the {{hypothesis}} that neurones in the anterior interpositus nucleus, under the control of Purkinje cells in the c 1 and c 3 zones of the cerebellar cortex, exert some control over classically <b>conditioned</b> <b>responses.</b> In particular, the experiments were designed to determine whether the cerebellar control of <b>conditioned</b> and unconditioned <b>responses</b> is different. The experiments were performed on cats decerebrated rostral to the red nucleus under halothane anaesthesia. The cats were conditioned using either a 1000 Hz tone or trains of stimuli through the skin of the proximal forelimb as the conditioned stimulus, and periorbital electrical stimulation as the unconditioned stimulus. A large proportion of the animals acquired <b>conditioned</b> <b>responses</b> at normal rates. It could be shown that these were true <b>conditioned</b> <b>responses</b> and did not result from sensitization or pseudoconditioning. For instance, unpaired presentations of conditioned and unconditioned stimuli caused rapid extinction. Cerebellar areas controlling eyeblink were identified by recording climbing fibre responses in the cerebellar cortex and recording EMG activity in the eyelid evoked by stimulation of the cerebellar cortex. When single shocks of 40 - 70 microA were applied to these areas during the emission of <b>conditioned</b> eyeblink <b>responses,</b> the latter were strongly inhibited. The inhibition had a latency of about 10 ms and a duration of 25 - 75 ms. It was shown that this inhibition of the <b>conditioned</b> <b>responses</b> was topographically specific and could only be evoked from cortical sites identified as controlling eyeblink. Stimulation of the periphery of an eyeblink area caused little or no inhibition. The effect of cortical stimulation on unconditioned reflex responses in the orbicularis oculi muscle was also tested. Some inhibition of unconditioned responses was observed, but quantitative analysis showed that this inhibition was considerably weaker than the corresponding inhibition of <b>conditioned</b> <b>responses.</b> The magnitude of the inhibition was determined for unconditioned responses of different sizes including responses which were weaker than the <b>conditioned</b> <b>responses.</b> It is concluded that <b>conditioned</b> eyeblink <b>responses</b> are under strong cerebellar control from areas in the c 1 and c 3 zones receiving climbing fibre input from the periorbital area. This effect is not likely to be due to a reduction in the background facilitation of facial motoneurones. In contrast, the weak inhibition of the unconditioned response was probably due to this mechanism. The results, therefore, suggest that the <b>conditioned</b> <b>responses</b> are dependent on the cerebellum in a way that is not true of unconditioned responses...|$|R

The view that language must be learned was especially popular before 1960 and is well represented by the mentalistic theories of Jean Piaget and the empiricist Rudolf Carnap.

5000|$|Within {{the realm}} of {{classical}} (Pavlovian) conditioning, disinhibition is a fundamental process of associative learning characterized by the recurrence of a <b>conditioned</b> <b>response</b> after extinction trials have eliminated said response elicited by the presentation of a novel stimulus. The following process best illustrates this form of disinhibition: An organism undergoes some series of classical conditioning trials until the conditioned stimulus reliably elicits a <b>conditioned</b> <b>response.</b> At this time, the organism then undergoes extinction trials until the conditioned stimulus no longer reliably elicits the <b>conditioned</b> <b>response.</b> Disinhibition occurs when, after these extinction trials, a new, novel stimulus is presented to the organism and at which time the organism again begins to show the previously extinguished <b>conditioned</b> <b>response.</b> This phenomenon {{is not to be}} confused with spontaneous recovery, though the concepts seem similar.|$|E

50|$|External {{inhibition}} is {{the observed}} decrease {{of the response}} of a conditioned reaction when an external (distracting) stimulus that {{was not part of}} the original <b>conditioned</b> <b>response</b> set is introduced. This effect was first observed in Ivan Pavlov's classical conditioning studies where the dogs would salivate less (<b>conditioned</b> <b>response)</b> when presented with the sound of the tuning fork (conditioned stimulus) in the distracting context of a passing truck (external stimulus). External inhibition is important for its main principle in classical conditioning where a <b>conditioned</b> <b>response</b> may decrease in magnitude after the external stimulus is introduced. This is especially advantageous for when trying to disassociate conditioned stimulus and responses. A practical example is where students who become anxious (<b>conditioned</b> <b>response)</b> upon standing in front of the class to give a presentation (conditioned stimulus) may feel less anxiety if their friends were sitting in front of the student presenting (external stimulus). The positive association of speaking to friends may distract the student from associating speaking to the entire class with anxiety.|$|E

Nonconscious compared with conscious activation of conditioned placebo analgesiawas associatedwith increased activation of the orbitofrontal cortex, a structurewith direct connections to affective brain regions and basic reward processing.

In contrast to previous assumptions about conditioning in humans, our results show that <b>conditioned</b> pain <b>responses</b> can be elicited independently of conscious awareness and our results suggest a hierarchical activation of neural pathways for nonconscious and conscious <b>conditioned</b> <b>responses.</b> Demonstrating that the human brain has a nonconscious mechanism for responding to conditioned cues has major implications for the role of associative learning in behavioral medicine and psychiatry.

Next, participants underwent instrumental training for two responses reinforced with either 10 p or 50 p.

These findings suggest that expectancy of reward is necessary for PIT; however, emotional <b>conditioned</b> <b>responses</b> appear not sufficient to influence PIT.
