Often associated with elementary school children, crossing guards {{stop the flow of}} traffic so pedestrians may cross an <b>intersection.</b> Crossing <b>guards</b> are known by a variety of names, the most widely used in the United Kingdom and Australia being [...] "lollipop lady/man", a reference to the large signs used that resemble lollipops.|$|R
50|$|The cathedral is a three naves and chapels and a semicircular choir, {{covered with}} a high <b>ceiling.</b> At the <b>intersection</b> of the nave with the choir is the tower with a Baroque dome. The {{hallways}} are very narrow and much lower in height than in the center. The facade is richly decorated and assumed its present form in 1766. It is a little larger than {{the body of the}} building and is divided into three levels, flanked by two square towers covered with baroque domes.|$|R

Fences topped with razor wire, security lighting, alarm systems, guard dogs, locked gates and walls are considered necessary around houses and apartment buildings. Carjacking is now rife {{in the capital}} and stopping at the few functional traffic lights is not recommended after dark when marauding gangs gather at the <b>intersection(s).</b> Security <b>guards</b> are widely employed as the police force is under resourced and weakened by internal corruption. Travel by foot is not recommended in and about the city and suburbs due continuing breakdown in law and order. The UN Global Compact Cities Programme, using a method called Circles of Sustainability has assessed the urban security of Port Moresby as 'critical'.|$|R
25|$|The Batista Dictatorship of Cuba {{established}} the non-Formula One Cuban Grand Prix in 1957. Fangio won the 1957 event, and had set fastest times during {{practice for the}} 1958 race. On 23 February 1958, two unmasked gunmen of Fidel Castro's 26th of July Movement entered the Hotel Lincoln in Havana and kidnapped Fangio at gunpoint. The motive was simple: By capturing the biggest name in motorsport the rebels were showing up the government and attracting worldwide publicity to their cause. But despite the shocking news spreading across the globe, President Batista would not be outdone and ordered the race to continue as usual while a crack team of police hunted down the kidnappers. They set up roadblocks at <b>intersections,</b> and <b>guards</b> were assigned to private and commercial airports and to all competing drivers.|$|R
40|$|We {{propose a}} variant of the Hierarchical Constraint Logic Programming (HCLP) scheme of Borning, Wilson, and others. We {{consider}} compositionality and incrementality in Constraint Logic Programming, introduce HCLP, and present Wilson's proof [11] that it is non-compositional and non-monotonic. We define a scheme for composing together solutions to individual hierarchies and show that hierarchy composition can be expressed very simply using bags (multisets). We have developed an alternative to bag <b>intersection</b> called <b>guard,</b> and we prove that it has various properties. First we use it to define BCH, a scheme which calculates a superset of the solutions expected from HCLP. We prove that BCH is compositional. We then define FGH, a non-compositional scheme which removes precisely those BCH solutions which are unacceptable to HCLP. FGH uses a class of functions we have defined, called filters; we give examples. We argue that the decomposition of HCLP into two parts, one compositional and one n [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Although {{a growing}} number of {{dynamical}} systems studied in various fields are hybrid in nature, the verification of prop-erties, such as stability, safety, etc., is still a challenging problem. Reachability analysis is one of the promising meth-ods for hybrid system verification, which together with all other verification techniques faces the challenge of making the analysis scale with respect to the number of continuous state variables. The bottleneck of many reachability analysis techniques for hybrid systems is the geometrically computed <b>intersection</b> with <b>guard</b> sets. In this work, we replace the in-tersection operation by a nonlinear mapping onto the guard, which is not only numerically stable, but also scalable, mak-ing it possible to verify systems which were previously out of reach. The approach {{can be applied to the}} fairly common class of hybrid systems with piecewise continuous solutions, guard sets modeled as halfspaces, and urgent semantics, i. e. discrete transitions are immediately taken when enabled by guard sets. We demonstrate the usefulness of the new ap-proach by a mechanical system with backlash which has 101 continuous state variables...|$|R

Using the same method, one can show that other modal logics can be naturally translated into {GF 2 }, including nominal tense logics and intuitionistic propositional logic. In our view, the results in this paper provide strong evidence that the natural first-order fragment corresponding to modal logics, is {GF 2 }...|$|R
40|$|International audienceMany tools {{used for}} the {{validated}} simulation of initial value problem of ordinary differential equations (ODE) provide abstraction of the solution under {{the form of a}} list of boxes obtained by time discretization and local polynomial interpolation. Majority of them are based on Taylor methods (Vnode-LP or CAPD) or on Runge-Kutta methods (DynIbex). If some information on the system state at a given time are given (e. g., from measurements, or <b>guard</b> <b>intersection),</b> it is complex to take this information into account with a low computation cost. We propose a contraction/propagation algorithm to use this information in an elegant manner. This approach will allow one to avoid some costly steps which would appear in running a new simulation...|$|R
40|$|Abstractâ€”We propose an {{approach}} for verifying non-linear hybrid systems using higher-order Taylor models {{that are a}} combination of bounded degree polynomials over the initial conditions and time, bloated by an interval. Taylor models are an effective means for computing rigorous bounds on the complex time trajectories of non-linear differential equations. As a result, Taylor models have been successfully used to verify properties of non-linear continuous systems. However, the handling of discrete (controller) transitions remains a challenging problem. In this paper, we provide techniques for handling the effect of discrete transitions on Taylor model flowpipe construction. We explore various solutions based on two ideas: domain contraction and range over-approximation. Instead of explicitly computing the intersection of a Taylor model with a guard set, domain contraction makes the domain of a Taylor model smaller by cutting away parts for which the intersection is empty. It is complemented by range over-approximation that translates Taylor models into commonly used representations such as template polyhedra or zonotopes, on which <b>intersections</b> with <b>guard</b> sets have been previously studied. We provide an implementation of the techniques described in the paper and evaluate the various design choices over a set of challenging benchmarks. I...|$|R

The translation is theoretically interesting, because it translates modal logics with certain frame conditions into first-order logic, without explicitly expressing these frame conditions. It is practically relevant, because it {{makes it possible to}} use a decision procedure for the guarded fragment in order to decide regular grammar logics with converse. The class of regular grammar logics includes numerous logics from various application domains.

40|$|We {{provide a}} simple {{translation}} of the satisfiability problem for regular grammar logics with converse into GF 2, which is the <b>intersection</b> of the <b>guarded</b> fragment and the 2 -variable fragment of first-order logic. This translation is theoretically interesting because it translates modal logics with certain frame conditions into first-order logic, without explicitly expressing the frame conditions. A consequence of the translation is that the general satisfiability problem for regular grammar logics with converse is in EXPTIME. This extends a previous result of the first author for grammar logics without converse. Using the same method, we show how some other modal logics can be naturally translated into GF 2, including nominal tense logics and intuitionistic logic. In our view, the results in this paper show that the natural first-order fragment corresponding to regular grammar logics is simply GF 2 without extra machinery such as fixed point-operators.

40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} reachability analysis with the focus on linear hybrid systems. Hybrid systems are a mixture of continuous and discrete behaviors. The Hybrid automaton consisting of a graph, in which the locations describe the continuous and the transitions the discrete behavior, represents the best formal model for such kind of systems. It provides a formalism integrating differential equations and logic expressions in a same framework, thus opening new horizons {{in research and development}} of new methods and novel algorithms. Despite recent progress made in this field in the last years, actual verification methods and available tools have exhibited their shortcomings. We started this work with the assessment of some verification tools using a suite of benchmarks conceived specially for this task. The benchmarks possess particular characteristics for testing of efficiency, applicability, scalability, capability and performances of these tools. We offer a theoretical overview of existing methods for computing an overapproximation of reachable sets for linear time invariant hybrid systems. This covers approaches for overapproximating reachable sets of the continuous dynamics with and without invariants as well as methods for solving the problem of <b>guard</b> <b>intersection</b> at transitions. We furthermore propose new overapproximation techniques for treating the continuous part as well as the discrete part of the hybrid automaton. We suggest scalable, modular implementations of these diverse methods allowing thereby possible combinations between them first using support functions and then with zonotopes. The implementations include different approaches for handling invariants, guards and transitions for the above-mentioned set representations. Two toolboxes are the results of this implementation effort. Both tools integrate the methods described above. They offer a GUI and allow for a user-configurable reachability analysis. We use both tools to carry out a performance comparison of different methods. We note thereby that there is a correlation between these performances and the complexity of the tested example. However, we note during this survey using the proposed benchmark suite that the difference in the performance with regards to the tightness of the overapproximation and the computation time is not so crucial for low dimensional systems. We propose a networked platoon of vehicles to demonstrate different context where reachability analysis can be useful. We first perform a reachability analysis to determine unsafe gaps between the vehicles which are controlled using LMI formalism. Reachability analysis can be helpful for control design. The choice between controllers on the basis of reachability results has led to controller ensuring the best compromise between safe and small gaps when applying H 2 or Hinf control design techniques. Reachability {{can also be used to}} determine time-critical conditions. As demonstration, we opt for a platoon approaching an intersection...|$|R
