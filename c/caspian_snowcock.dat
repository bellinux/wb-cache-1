2500|$|In {{generally}} warmer {{areas of}} the Eurasian continent, the diverse pheasant family replaces the grouse as the significant group of birds in the golden eagle's diet. Across the range, pheasants make up 5.7% of the diet of this species. Unlike grouse, pheasants are not known to comprise {{more than half of}} the nest remains in any study, but they can be important nonetheless. This is especially true in Spain, where most studies show that the pheasants at 22.8-28.7% of the diet, mainly the red-legged partridge (Alectoris rufa), are the second most prominent prey species after the European rabbit, with the red-legged partridge and the rabbit collectively making up to more than 90% of the prey remains in several nests there. The red-legged species, along with the rock partridge (Alectoris graeca) and grey partridge (Perdix perdix), are the leading prey group in the French Pyrenees at 15.8% of a sampling of 114 from 10 nests. In Hungary, the common pheasant (Phasianus colchicus) appears to be the favored prey species, making up 26.6% of the prey of a sampling of 49 from 4 nests there. In Japan, the copper pheasant (Syrmaticus soemmerringii) is the second most common single prey species, making up 17.8% of the remains (sample size of 967 from 5 nests). In the Caspian Sea area of Kazakhstan, the most common bird species (and third most common overall prey species) is the chukar (Alectoris chukar), representing 19.5% of a sampling of 468 from 36 nests. Chukar and <b>Caspian</b> <b>snowcock</b> (Tetraogallus caspius) are reportedly the primary avian prey species in Armenia. In the Himalayan region, two very large pheasants, the Himalayan monal (Lophophorus impejanus) and the Himalayan snowcock (Tetraogallus himalayensis), are reportedly among the most significant prey for eagles. Moorland francolin (Scleroptila psilolaemus) were reportedly the most common bird prey species in Ethiopia's Bale Mountains, comprising 10% among a sample size of 49 at 4 nests. North America has fewer native pheasants species but introduced species such as grey partridge, ring-necked pheasant and, especially, chukar are readily hunted (native quail seem to be largely or entirely ignored as prey by golden eagle, perhaps because of their small size or dense thicket-dwelling habits). The chukar is the most significant bird species in the diet in Nevada (at 5.4%) and the second most significant bird species in Washington state (at 11.8%). One native North American “pheasant” known to be occasionally hunted is the wild turkey (Meleagris gallopavo), the largest species of galliform. The golden eagle is the only major avian predator of adult turkeys. The hunting techniques used on pheasants are probably similar to those used for grouse. Pheasants hunted by golden eagles are also similar in size in grouse. Alectoris sp. weigh around [...] and medium-sized species weighing around [...] Snowcock will often weigh , whereas the female and male adult turkey weigh around [...] and , respectively. On a wildlife monitoring camera in Tennessee, a golden eagle was filmed assaulting an adult turkey, appearing to use a “contour flight with short glide attack” but the quarry in this case appears to successfully avoid the strikes by running and then ultimately flying away. Breeding pairs of eagles have been known to hunt turkeys cooperatively.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Caspian</b> <b>snowcock</b> (Tetraogallus caspius) is a snowcock in the {{pheasant}} family Phasianidae of {{the order}} Galliformes, gallinaceous birds.|$|E
5000|$|Threatened {{species of}} birds, which are found quite {{commonly}} {{in the national}} park, are black stork, bearded vulture, Egyptian vulture, griffon vulture, <b>Caspian</b> <b>snowcock,</b> short-toed eagle, golden eagle, long-legged buzzard, eastern imperial eagle, booted eagle, Radde's accentor, Alpine accentor, wallcreeper, Alpine chough and white-winged snowfinch ...|$|E
50|$|The <b>Caspian</b> <b>snowcock</b> has {{a desolate}} {{whistling}} song, vaguely like a Eurasian curlew, sooo-looo-leeee. It differs from Caucasian snowcock {{in that it}} does not have the drop in pitch {{at the end of the}} song shown by that species. The calls include loud cackles and bubbled buck-buck-buck-buck-burrrrrr.|$|E
50|$|The natural {{environment}} in the Munzur Valley National Park offers an adequate habitat for wildlife. Several genera of trout living in Munzur River and Mercan River, two subspecies of wild goat, namely chamois and bezoar ibex, and the gamebird <b>Caspian</b> <b>snowcock</b> are examples of the national park's endemic fauna.|$|E
50|$|Notable {{birds in}} this {{ecoregion}} are honey buzzard (Pernis apivorus), goshawk (Accipiter gentilis), black vulture (Aegypius monachus), bimaculated lark (Melanocorypha bimaculata) and <b>Caspian</b> <b>snowcock</b> (Tetraogallus caspius). Eagles {{here are the}} lesser spotted eagle (Aquila pomarina) and the golden eagle (Aquila chrysaetos). The ecoregion is also a breeding area for the little bustard (Tetrax tetrax) and black woodpecker (Dryocopus martius).|$|E
50|$|The {{natural forest}} of Hatila Valley National Park and the {{surrounding}} area is rich in wildlife. Large mammals found here include grey wolf, red fox, lynx, leopard, brown bear, wild goat, chamois, roe deer, wild boar and European hare. Many birds of prey pass through during their migrations, and golden eagle, long-legged buzzard, peregrine falcon, <b>Caspian</b> <b>snowcock,</b> Caucasian grouse, chukar partridge and grey partridge can be seen here.|$|E
50|$|This {{ecoregion}} is {{an important}} resting area for birds migrating between Russia and Africa and is thus a key habitat for many bird species. Some outstanding birds {{that can be found}} here are the greylag goose (Anser anser), white-fronted goose (Anser albifrons), Little bustard (Tetrax tetrax), glossy ibis (Plegadis falcinellus), Eurasian spoonbill (Platalea leucorodia), night heron (Nycticorax nycticorax), red-breasted goose (Branta ruficollis), peregrine falcon (Falco peregrinus), Dalmatian pelican (Pelecanus crispus), buff-backed heron (Bubulcus ibis), squacco heron (Ardeola ralloides), greater flamingo (Phoenicopterus roseus), white-headed duck (Oxyura leucocephala), and <b>Caspian</b> <b>snowcock</b> (Tetraogallus caspius).|$|E
50|$|The Caucasian snowcock {{occurs in}} the Caucasus Mountains in Azerbaijan, Georgia and the Russian Federation. It has been {{introduced}} into the United States. The <b>Caspian</b> <b>snowcock</b> is native to eastern Turkey, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Iran, Iraq and Georgia and has been introduced into the United States.

Red-fronted serin (Serinus pusillus), linnet (Carduelis cannabina), snow finch (Montifringilla nivalis), rock sparrow (Petronia petronia), rock bunting (Emberiza cia) and horned lark (Eremophila alpestris) are native; in winter {{they come to the}} lower hill sides. In each spring wheatear (Oenanthe oenanthe), rock thrush (Monticola saxatilis), and nightingale (Luscinia megarhynchos) come from Africa for breeding. Grey-necked bunting (Emberiza buchanani), black-headed bunting (Emberiza melanocephala) and common rosefinch (Carpodacus erythrinus) come from India.|$|E
50|$|The fauna of the {{national}} park is also rich. There are about 800 species of beetles as well as numerous species of reptiles (Viper - Vipera lebetina, Armenian and Dahl lizards - Darevskia armeniaca, D. dahli etc.), amphibians (lake frog - Rana ridibunda, green toad - Bufo viridis etc.), fish (trout - Salmo fario, barbel or Kura beghlou- Barbus lacertacyri etc.).
