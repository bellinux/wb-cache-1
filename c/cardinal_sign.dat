5000|$|BPPV is {{the most}} common cause of {{peripheral}} vertigo. It can be characterized by three main symptoms: positional onset, spinning dizziness and short lived symptoms. The primary diagnostic maneuver is the Dix-Hallpike which elicits the <b>cardinal</b> <b>sign</b> associated with BPPV, rotatory nystagmus.|$|E
5000|$|Munro's microabscess is an abscess (collection of neutrophils) in the {{stratum corneum}} of the {{epidermis}} {{due to the}} infiltration of neutrophils from papillary dermis into the epidermal stratum corneum. They are a <b>cardinal</b> <b>sign</b> of psoriasis where they are seen in the hyperkeratotic and parakeratotic areas of the stratum corneum. [...] Munro microabscesses are not seen in seborrheic dermatitis.|$|E

50|$|In astrology, Cancer is the <b>Cardinal</b> <b>sign</b> of the Water Trigon, {{which is}} made up of Cancer, Pisces, and Scorpio. It is {{considered}} a negative sign, whose domicile, or ruling planet, is the Moon. Though some depictions of Cancer feature a lobster, the sign is most often represented by the crab, based on the Karkinos, a giant crab that harassed Heracles during his fight with the Hydra.|$|E
5000|$|At the {{beginning}} of labour, the baby is generally in an [...] position, facing either the right or {{left side of the}} mother's back. The baby's bottom is the same size in the term baby as the baby's head. Descent is thus as for the presenting fetal head and delay in descent is a <b>cardinal</b> <b>sign</b> of possible problems with the delivery of the head.|$|E
50|$|Fingolimod is a {{candidate}} therapeutic drug {{for the treatment of}} heart failure and arrhythmias. Heart failure is a leading cause of hospitalization and death in many countries, and an ever-increasing health burden worldwide. Pathogenic hypertrophy of the myocardium is a <b>cardinal</b> <b>sign</b> leading to heart failure and is associated with an increased risk of cardiac morbidity and mortality. Cardiac arrhythmias are disturbances in cardiac rhythm that often arise as a lethal complication of heart failure. This occurs due to the progressive ischemic/reperfusion injury the heart faces.|$|E

50|$|Thermography, or thermal imaging, {{measures}} the heat gradient of skin by detection of infrared radiation. Because heat is a <b>cardinal</b> <b>sign</b> of inflammation, thermal imaging {{can be used}} to detect inflammation that may be the cause of lameness, and at times discover a subclinical injury. When used, horses must be placed in an area free of sunlight exposure, drafts, or other sources of outside heat, and hair length should be uniform in the area imaged. Benefits include non-invasiveness and the potential for early identification of injury, and detection of early contralateral limb injury in the case of orthopedic patients.|$|E
50|$|Symptoms of a rupture may be {{initially}} quite subtle. An old cesarean scar may undergo dehiscence; {{but with}} further labor the woman may experience abdominal pain and vaginal bleeding, though these signs {{are difficult to}} distinguish from normal labor. Often a deterioration of the fetal heart rate is a leading sign, but the <b>cardinal</b> <b>sign</b> of uterine rupture is loss of fetal station on manual vaginal exam. Intra-abdominal bleeding can lead to hypovolemic shock and death. Although the associated maternal mortality is now less than one percent, the fetal mortality rate is between two and six percent when rupture occurs in the hospital.|$|E
50|$|In western astrology, Aries {{is a sign}} of initiative; a leader, with bravery, and the {{autonomy}} required to commence. Uncomfortable with inaction, Aries is the <b>Cardinal</b> <b>sign</b> of Fire, and thus is the zodiac of drive. Ruled by Mars, Aries is strongly autonomous, and can be headstrong and crass, sometimes showing an impulsive or reckless approach to issues. With the Ram as their standard, Aries tends toward obstinate and self-seeking. Jaunty and self-supporting, Aries is capable of independence. This quality may encourage others to emulate—but Aries is unlikely to pause for supporters. When Aries is found in a chart, there is enthusiasm and decisiveness.|$|E

25|$|Cardinal: The <b>cardinal</b> <b>signs</b> are Aries, Cancer, Libra, and Capricorn. A native with mainly <b>cardinal</b> <b>signs</b> {{will not}} want to be held under anybody's thumb, and will need to take charge of their own world. Their {{attention}} may be concerned with themselves or others, but wherever their energies are directed it is difficult to deflect them from their chosen course. <b>Cardinal</b> <b>signs</b> in a chart will add courage, initiative and self-motivation. Cardinal subjects are hard to influence because they generally believe they know best. A subject lacking <b>cardinal</b> <b>signs</b> may feel they are never in control of their own lives, but are manipulated by people and circumstances beyond their control. They may lack courage and initiative and may prefer others to make decisions for them. Planets in the 1st, 4th, 7th and 10th houses, and an emphasis on fire and air signs in the chart will help to compensate for this lack.|$|R
5000|$|In DSM-IV-TR, koro {{is listed}} {{as one of the}} entries in the Glossary of Culture-Bound Syndromes of Appendix I. The manual gives koro's {{definition}} as [...] "a term, probably of Malaysian origin, that refers to an episode of sudden and intense anxiety that the penis (or, in females, the vulva and nipples) will recede into the body and possibly cause death." [...] Attempts have been made by numerous authors to place koro into different classes. For example, koro may fit into the group of [...] "specific culture-imposed nosophobia" [...] (classification with <b>cardinal</b> <b>sign),</b> [...] "the genital retraction taxon" [...] (classification with common factors between syndromes), and the group with [...] "culture-related beliefs as causes for the occurrence" [...] (classification according to how the syndromes might be affected by cultural factors).|$|E

40|$|Dyspnoea is a common, {{if not the}} commonest symptom, of {{thyrotoxicosis}} (Wayne) {{and cardiovascular}} overactivity is recognized as a <b>cardinal</b> <b>sign</b> of the disease. Despite the prominence of these manifestations the underlying physiology is poorly understood. Probably the major {{reason for this is}} lack of data. Stein, et al.,(l 961) have recorded a relatively comprehensive study of pulmonary function on thirteen patients at rest and on exercise. Their findings are discussed later but they, in common with all other investigators, did not report on the exercise diffusing capacity...|$|E

40|$|A {{girl who}} {{developed}} Cushingoid features in peripuberty, but was eucortisolemic, was previously {{reported to have}} markedly elevated lymphocyte glucocorticoid receptor sites per cell with normal binding affinity as a potential cause of her phenotype. Her circadian rhythm of cortisol and pituitary-adrenal axis were initially intact, but later proved to be dysregulated. The patient presented at age 10. 8 yr with centripetal obesity, moon facies, buffalo hump, and purple striae, but no statural stunting, which is a <b>cardinal</b> <b>sign</b> of Cushing’s syndrome. At 11. 5 yr she suffered a compression fracture of the L 1 vertebra.

40|$|Hyperexcitable reflex blinks are a <b>cardinal</b> <b>sign</b> of Parkinson’s disease. We {{investigated}} the neural circuit through which {{a loss of}} dopamine in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) leads to increased reflex blink excitability. Through its inhibitory inputs to the thalamus, the basal ganglia could modulate the brainstem reflex blink circuits via descending cortical projections. Alternatively, with its inhibitory input to the superior colliculus, the basal ganglia could regulate brainstem reflex blink circuits via tecto-reticular projections. Our study demonstrated that the basal ganglia utilizes its GABAergic input to the superior colliculus to modulate reflex blinks. In rats with previous unilateral 6 -hydroxydopamine (6 -OHDA) lesions of the dopamine neurons of the SNc, we found that microinjections of bicuculline, a GABA antagonist, into the superior colliculus of both alert and anesthetized rats eliminated the reflex blin...|$|E
40|$|The {{pathophysiology}} of migraine is {{not completely}} understood {{and continues to be}} investigated. The complexity of interactions taking place in the sensory neuronal network with the mediation of all different neurotransmitters involved gives the measure of the extreme difficulty connected with the knowledge of migraine pathogenesis and in particular of its <b>cardinal</b> <b>sign.</b> Neuronal components are relevant in migraine pathophysiology: there could be a generalized interictal abnormal excitability of the cerebral cortex in migraine, possibly favoring the occurrence of spreading depression with consequent activation of the trigeminal system. Many theories have been formulated in these last sixty years about the pathogenesis of migraine and other forms of primary headache, but the problem is still far to be fully clarified. The present review is focused on the description of different theories on the migraine pathogenesis...|$|E
