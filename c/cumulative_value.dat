25|$|Term I {{accounts}} for past {{values of the}} SP-PV error and integrates them over time to produce the I term. For example, {{if there is a}} residual SP-PV error after the application of proportional control, the integral term seeks to eliminate the residual error by adding a control effect due to the historic <b>cumulative</b> <b>value</b> of the error. When the error is eliminated, the integral term will cease to grow. This will result in the proportional effect diminishing as the error decreases, but this is compensated for by the growing integral effect.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{his initial}} {{popularity}} among Peruvian voters, García's {{term in office}} was marked by bouts of hyperinflation, which reached 7,649% in 1990 and had a cumulative total of 2,200,200% over the five years, thereby profoundly destabilising the Peruvian economy. Owing to such chronic inflation, the Peruvian currency, the sol, {{was replaced by the}} Inti in mid-1985, which itself was replaced by the nuevo sol ("new sun") in July 1991, at which time the new sol had a <b>cumulative</b> <b>value</b> of one billion (1,000,000,000) old soles. During García's administration, the per capita annual income of Peruvians fell to $720 (below the level of 1960) and Peru's GDP dropped 20%. By the end of his term, national reserves were negative $900 million.|$|E

40|$|Morphometric {{methods were}} used with 40 {{morphological}} characters {{from each of}} 110 individuals collected from 11 populations of the Ixeris chinensis complex to test hypotheses regarding infraspecific taxa. Individuals of the nearest relative I. tamagawaensis were included as an outgroup. To utilize structual associations of the original data and the <b>cumulative</b> <b>values</b> of character variation, a modified data set was generated by matching factor scores with the large original data set. As a result, the original data was reduced to about 10 % of its original size. The modified data also emphasized the <b>cumulative</b> <b>values</b> of character variations. Structural associations among characters measured, however, were not significant for most factors extracted even though some obvious trends appeared. Relationships between cumlative values of variation and taxa in the complex are discussed {{based on the results}} of the canonical discriminant function analysis, ANOVA, multiple comparison test, and cluster analysis, using the modified data. This study supports Kitamura’s (1956) classification of infraspecific taxa in the I. chinensis complex. Given that there is no overlap of <b>cumulative</b> <b>values</b> of variation between the species complex and I. tamagawaensis, there is probably a 75 % character overlap within the complex.

60|$|The letter which Père Étienne posted for Northwick at Rimouski was {{addressed}} {{to the editor of}} the Boston Events, and was published with every advantage which scare-heading could invent. A young journalist newly promoted to the management was trying to give the counting-room proofs of his efficiency in the line of the Events' greatest successes, and he wasted no thrill that the sensation in his hands was capable of imparting to his readers. Yet the effect was disappointing, not only in the figure of the immediate sales, but in the <b>cumulative</b> <b>value</b> of the recognition {{of the fact that the}} Events had been selected by Northwick as the best avenue for approaching the public. The Abstract, in copying and commenting upon the letter, skilfully stabbed its esteemed contemporary with an acknowledgment of its prime importance as the organ of the American defaulters in Canada; other papers, after questioning the document as a fake, made common cause in treating it as a matter of little or no moment. In fact, there had been many defalcations since Northwick's; the average of one a day in the despatches of the Associated Press had been fully kept up, and several of these had easily surpassed his in the losses involved, and in the picturesqueness of the circumstances. People generally recalled with an effort the supremely tragic claim of his case through the rumor of his death in the railroad accident; those who distinctly remembered it experienced a certain disgust at the man's willingness to shelter himself so long in the doubt to which it had left not only the public, but his own family, concerning his fate.|$|E

Design. Acute primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) {{was performed in}} 38 patients with first-time myocardial infarction. In 21 patients, CKMB and cTnT were acquired before PCI and at 1. 5, 3, 6, 12, 18, 24, and 48 hours thereafter. In 17 patients, clinical routine samples were acquired at arrival, and at 10 and 20 h. IS was assessed by delayed contrast-enhanced MRI (DE- MRI). Results. Time-to-peak was 7. 6 +/- 3. 6 h for CKMB and 8. 1 +/- 3. 4 h for cTnT. Peak values correlated strongly to <b>cumulative</b> <b>values</b> (r(s) = 0. 97 - 0. 98) {{as well as to}} DE-MRI (r(s) = 0. 8 - 0. 82).
