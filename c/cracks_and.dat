5|$|The Māori used {{various parts}} of Cordyline australis to treat {{injuries}} and illnesses, either boiled up into a drink or pounded into a paste. The kōata, the growing tip of the plant, was eaten raw as a blood tonic or cleanser. Juice from the leaves was used for cuts, <b>cracks</b> <b>and</b> sores. An infusion of the leaves was taken internally for diarrhoea and used externally for bathing cuts. The leaves were rubbed until soft and applied either directly or as an ointment to cuts, skin <b>cracks</b> <b>and</b> cracked or sore hands. The young shoot was eaten by nursing mothers and given to children for colic. The liquid from boiled shoots was taken for other stomach pains. The seeds of Cordyline australis are high in linoleic acid, one of the essential fatty acids.|$|E
5|$|The {{characteristics}} of boulder problems depend {{largely on the}} type of rock being climbed. Granite, for example, often features long <b>cracks</b> <b>and</b> slabs. Sandstone rocks are known for their steep overhangs and frequent horizontal breaks. Other common bouldering rocks include limestone and volcanic rock.|$|E

40|$|The Iowa DOT {{has been}} using the AASHTO Present Serviceability Index (PSI) rating {{procedure}} since 1968 to rate the condition of pavement sections. A ride factor <b>and</b> a <b>cracking</b> <b>and</b> patching factor make up the PSI value. <b>Crack</b> <b>and</b> patch surveys have been done by sending crews out to measure and record the distress. Advances in video equipment and computers make it practical to videotape roads <b>and</b> do the <b>crack</b> <b>and</b> patch measurements in the office. The objective {{of the study was}} to determine the feasibility of converting the <b>crack</b> <b>and</b> patch survey operation to a video recording system with manual post processing. The summary and conclusions are as follows: Video <b>crack</b> <b>and</b> patch surveying is a feasible alternative to the current <b>crack</b> <b>and</b> patch procedure. The cost per mile should be about 25 percent less than the current procedure. More importantly, the risk of accidents is reduced by getting the people and vehicles off the roadway and shoulder. Another benefit is the elimination of the negative public perceptions of the survey crew on the shoulder...|$|R

5|$|There is {{debate about}} {{the exact nature of}} phreatomagmatic eruptions, and some {{scientists}} believe that fuel-coolant reactions may be more critical to the explosive nature than thermal contraction. Fuel coolant reactions may fragment the volcanic material by propagating stress waves, widening <b>cracks</b> <b>and</b> increasing surface area that ultimately leads to rapid cooling and explosive contraction-driven eruptions.|$|E
5|$|Variety frustosus is morphologically {{similar to}} the main type, but its cap becomes areolate (marked out into small areas by <b>cracks</b> <b>and</b> crevices) in maturity. Its spores are {{slightly}} smaller too, measuring 11–15 by 4–5.5µm. In the European form ereticulatus, the reticulations on the upper stipe are replaced with fine reddish granules, while the variety ruforubraporus has pinkish-red pores.|$|E

Within fifteen years, the gallery walls were sagging, and the reliefs showed signs of new <b>cracks</b> <b>and</b> deterioration. Van Erp used concrete from which alkali salts and calcium hydroxide leached and were transported {{into the rest of}} the construction. This caused some problems, so that a further thorough renovation was urgently needed.|$|E

40|$|A {{methodology}} to nondestructively {{locate a}} <b>crack</b> <b>and</b> estimate the crack-size by using {{changes in the}} dynamic modal parameters of a class of bridges is presented. First, a theory of nondestructive <b>crack</b> localization <b>and</b> crack-size estimation algorithm that related to beam-type structures is outlined. Next, an experiment to verify the practicality of the nondestructive crack detection (NCD) scheme is performed. Pre-damage and post-damage dynamic modal data extracted from a full-scale plate-girder bridge are described. The modal data are fed into the NCD scheme that localizes <b>crack</b> <b>and</b> estimates crack-size in the test structure. Results of the analysis indicate that the NCD scheme correctly localize the <b>crack</b> <b>and</b> closely estimates the crack-size...|$|R

5|$|During several {{independent}} {{field studies}} <b>cracks</b> <b>and</b> other ground deformations were observed {{on both the}} Egyptian and Saudi Arabian sides of the gulf. During a field survey that was done there in 1996, a series of cracks were discovered between 28°35' N and 29°05' N on the Saudi Arabian coast. A field investigation was also done in Egypt in 1996 by seismologist Yann Klinger and others along with the Egyptian Geological Survey and Mining Authority. The most dramatic ground ruptures found were north of Nuweiba along a coastal road.|$|E

5|$|Highway 82 {{was now a}} four-lane road all the {{way from}} Glenwood Springs to Aspen. But that traffic still had to narrow to two lanes to cross the Maroon Creek Bridge at the latter city's western boundary. The old bridge, listed on the National Register of Historic Places since 1985, was {{functionally}} obsolete and structurally deficient. <b>Cracks</b> <b>and</b> other damage were forcing temporary closures of the bridge to trucks. Over 100 years old by that point, the oldest bridge in use on a Colorado highway, it could not be expanded any further.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{introduces}} a new detection method of <b>crack</b> <b>and</b> structural objects, whiteline, joint and manhole {{of the road}} surface image based on morphological t,echnique. <b>Crack</b> <b>and</b> structural objects are difficult to detect directly at the pixel level because of the noise and the vagueness. Some kind of structural information is needed. In the proposed method, we have used morphologcal operations which are able to extract specify shapes explicitly. Although the method requires the setting of some parameters, it is robust for detecting vague <b>crack</b> <b>and</b> st(ructura 1 objects in the noisy road surface image. ...|$|R

5|$|Patterns {{in nature}} are visible regularities of form {{found in the}} natural world. These {{patterns}} recur in different contexts and can sometimes be modelled mathematically. Natural patterns include symmetries, trees, spirals, meanders, waves, foams, tessellations, <b>cracks</b> <b>and</b> stripes. Early Greek philosophers studied pattern, with Plato, Pythagoras and Empedocles attempting to explain order in nature. The modern understanding of visible patterns developed gradually over time.|$|E

5|$|Recently the Canning Dam {{has been}} {{subjected}} to considerable cracking of the upper parts of the dam and upper gallery. Investigations have shown that cracking was due to strong AAR (alkali aggregate reactivity) in the concrete. AAR results in swelling of the concrete, which may cause secondary compressive stresses, localised map <b>cracks,</b> <b>and,</b> ultimately structural cracks. In addition, the concrete tensile strength and elasticity significantly decreases. Many old concrete dams are known to suffer from AAR, including Fontana Dam in Tennessee and Pian Telessio dam in Italy among others.|$|E

5|$|The funding {{produced}} by the Battleship Texas Commission was {{not up to the}} task of maintaining the ship. Consequently, years of neglect resulted in <b>cracks</b> <b>and</b> gaps in coated surfaces, water intrusion, and steel deterioration.

At the same time, pipes open to the sea ultimately failed, flooding various voids and bunkers.|$|E
5|$|When {{several of}} the {{fuselage}} alloys were discovered to be vulnerable to weakening via metal fatigue, a detailed routine inspection process was introduced.

5|$|By early 1997, {{after almost}} two decades of activity, the only repairs {{completed}} were phase one of the air ventilation system to dehumidify the hollow base, the drainage pipes and a new inner roof.

The temporary building was budgeted at $270,000; the city spent a total of $450,000 on repairs approved by the Park District that year.|$|E
