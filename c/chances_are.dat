5|$|Robert Downey Jr. is an American {{actor who}} has acted in {{numerous}} films and television series. In the 1980s, {{he was considered}} {{a member of the}} Brat Pack after appearing in the films Weird Science with Anthony Michael Hall (1985), Back to School with Rodney Dangerfield (1986), Less Than Zero with Andrew McCarthy (1987), and Johnny Be Good again with Hall (1988). Downey also starred in the films True Believer (1989) and <b>Chances</b> <b>Are</b> (1989), and was a regular cast member on the late-night variety show Saturday Night Live in 1985.|$|E
5|$|As {{shown in}} the table, {{the total number of}} {{possible}} combinations to have an equal (conserved) number of A and B alleles is six, and its probability is 6/16. The total number of possible alternative combinations is ten, and the probability of unequal number of A and B alleles is 10/16. Thus, although the original colony began with an equal number of A and B alleles, <b>chances</b> <b>are</b> that the number of alleles in the remaining population of four members will not be equal. In the latter case, genetic drift has occurred because the population's allele frequencies have changed due to random sampling. In this example the population contracted to just four random survivors, a phenomenon known as population bottleneck.|$|E
5|$|In 1968, Norman {{was visited}} {{by a young}} Bob Marley in his Bronx apartment. Norman had at that time written a number of songs for Johnny Nash, whose record label had just signed Marley, and Marley wanted {{to learn more about}} rhythm and blues. Along with Al Pyfrom, Norman's co-writer, and Marley's wife Rita, the pair spent several days in a jam session that {{ultimately}} resulted in a 24-minute tape of Marley performing several of his own and Norman-Pyfrom's compositions. According to Reggae archivist Roger Steffens, the tape—which was lost among Norman's possessions for decades—is rare for Marley in that it was influenced by pop music rather than reggae, highlighting a point in Marley's career when he was still trying to find his path. Some of the songs from this early jam session were released on the Marley album <b>Chances</b> <b>Are.</b>|$|E
40|$|This paper {{argues that}} the Humean theory of <b>chance</b> <b>is</b> {{formally}} adequate {{in the sense that}} it satisfies the axioms of finitely additive probability. To this end, firstly, a functionalist account of <b>chance</b> <b>is</b> defended, according to which <b>chance</b> <b>is</b> a functional property and the function relevant to <b>chance</b> <b>is</b> to constrain an agent’s credence in the manner prescribed by David Lewis’s Principal Principle. <b>Chance</b> thus understood <b>is</b> called an expert. Secondly, to specify the functional role of <b>chance,</b> it <b>is</b> claimed that primarily <b>chance</b> should <b>be</b> treated as a cognitive expert, i. e., expert that constrains an agent’s credence because it is predictively accurate. In this light, Humean <b>chance</b> <b>is</b> taken to be a possible physical realization of the cognitive expert. When Humean <b>chance</b> <b>is</b> understood in this way, it can be shown that it occupies the role of the cognitive expert if and only if it is formally adequate. ...|$|R

5|$|The {{period of}} time between an injury and {{development}} of epilepsy varies, {{and it is not}} uncommon for an injury to be followed by a latent period with no recurrent seizures. The longer a person goes without developing seizures, the lower the <b>chances</b> <b>are</b> that epilepsy will develop. At least 80–90% of people with PTE have their first seizure within two years of the TBI. People with no seizures within three years of the injury have only a 5% chance of developing epilepsy. However, one study found that head trauma survivors are at an increased risk for PTE as many as 10years after moderate TBI and over 20years after severe TBI. Since head trauma is fairly common and epilepsy can occur late after the injury, it can be difficult to determine whether a case of epilepsy resulted from head trauma in the past or whether the trauma was incidental.|$|E
5|$|Izzie {{supports}} Alex when {{he discovers}} his new girlfriend has psychiatric problems, and convinces {{him to have}} her committed. She is also handed primary responsibility for the clinic, as Bailey cuts back on her responsibilities. Izzie and Alex go on to rekindle their relationship, though Izzie is concerned when she begins hallucinating Denny. She discovers she has metastatic melanoma (Stage IV) which has spread to her liver, skin, and brain, causing the hallucinations. Her survival <b>chances</b> <b>are</b> estimated at only 5%. She is admitted to Seattle Grace as a patient, and Derek Shepherd (Patrick Dempsey) successfully removes a tumor from her brain. Izzie spends her time in the hospital planning Meredith and Derek's wedding, but when her condition worsens and Derek discovers a second brain tumor, they give the ceremony to Izzie and Alex, who marry {{in front of all}} their friends. The procedure to remove the second tumor from Izzie's brain causes her to lose her short-term memory, and although she soon regains it, she flatlines moments later. The fifth season ends with her friends ignoring her DNR order and attempting to resuscitate her, transposed with images of Izzie in an elevator encountering George, who has been in an accident and is also currently flatlining. Though George dies, Izzie is resuscitated and recovers enough to return to work.|$|E
5|$|Wonka announces {{a contest}} whereby {{children}} that find Golden Tickets hidden in five Wonka bars {{will be given}} a tour of the factory and a lifetime supply of chocolate, and one a chance to be presented with an unknown grand prize. Four tickets are quickly found: the greedy and gluttonous Augustus Gloop (Philip Wiegratz) from Düsseldorf; the spoiled and rotten Veruca Salt (Julia Winter) from Buckinghamshire; the competitive and boastful Violet Beauregarde (AnnaSophia Robb) from Atlanta; and the arrogant and aggressive Mike Teavee (Jordan Fry) from Denver. Charlie hopes to find a ticket but his <b>chances</b> <b>are</b> small as money is tight, and the best has to be made of his annual birthday present of one Wonka bar and a bar bought by Grandpa Joe's money, both of which yield no tickets. All hope is seemingly crushed when the last ticket is apparently claimed in Russia. Charlie, on finding some money in the street, just intends to enjoy one chocolate bar when news breaks that the Russian ticket was fake. To Charlie's surprise, he finds the bar he just bought has the real last Golden Ticket. Bystanders attempt to separate him from it, only for the shopkeeper (Oscar James) to see that he keeps the ticket and gets back home with it.|$|E

25|$|If {{one were}} to put {{a small number of}} {{specially}} cast blocks into the general inventory, <b>chances</b> <b>are</b> pretty good that you’d never find them again, so Kaplan painted all the blocks in a bright orange so they could identify them on the transfer line. Kaplan drew on about 12 of these special castings during his development program and two were eventually (much later) sold to customers.|$|E
25|$|If Denness did not warrant {{selection}} from amongst seventeen {{players on}} the eve of the Fourth Test, the <b>chances</b> <b>are</b> that he was not good enough in the first place to have been in the touring party.

25|$|Bush was the {{starting}} shortstop for the Detroit Tigers from 1908 to 1921 and an infielder for the Washington Senators from 1921 to 1923. He {{was recognized as}} one of the best defensive shortstops of the dead-ball era. He had more putouts, assists, and total chances than any other shortstop of the era, and his 1914 totals of 425 putouts and 969 <b>chances</b> <b>are</b> still American League records for shortstops (and the major league record for putouts). He also led the American League in assists by a shortstop on five occasions and holds the major league record with nine triple plays.|$|E
25|$|Consider {{this matter}} in the context that natural gas {{producers}} generally buy mineral rights from the Crown but must negotiate surface access and other land rights with their neighbours. In this environment, the <b>chances</b> <b>are</b> high that some projects will face delays {{as a result of}} public hearings - for example, as Shell and the other contenders did at the Caroline hearing. After all, those with an interest in a single land use decision could include petroleum producers, Aboriginal communities, landowners, farmers, ranchers, loggers, trappers, campers, sports and environmental groups, and others. Many conflicting interests need to be resolved.|$|E
25|$|Cryptanalysis of symmetric-key ciphers {{typically}} involves {{looking for}} {{attacks against the}} block ciphers or stream ciphers that are more efficient than any attack that could be against a perfect cipher. For example, a simple brute force attack against DES requires one known plaintext and 255 decryptions, trying {{approximately half of the}} possible keys, to reach a point at which <b>chances</b> <b>are</b> better than even that the key sought will have been found. But this may not be enough assurance; a linear cryptanalysis attack against DES requires 243 known plaintexts and approximately 243 DES operations. This is a considerable improvement on brute force attacks.|$|E

25|$|The psi {{assumption}} — The {{assumption that}} any statistical deviation from <b>chance</b> <b>is</b> evidence for telepathy is highly controversial. Strictly speaking, a deviation from <b>chance</b> <b>is</b> only evidence that either {{this was a}} rare, statistically unlikely occurrence that happened by <b>chance,</b> or something <b>was</b> causing a deviation from chance. Flaws in the experimental design are a common cause of this, and so the assumption {{that it must be}} telepathy is fallacious.|$|R

25|$|Under the {{conditions}} supposed, {{there is no}} doubt of the result, if the work of the colonists be carried out energetically and with intelligent combination of all their forces. On the other hand, if they are slothful, stupid, and careless; or if they waste their energies in contests with one another, the <b>chances</b> <b>are</b> that the old state of nature will have the best of it. The native savage will destroy the immigrant civilized man; of the English animals and plants some will be extirpated by their indigenous rivals, others will pass into the feral state and themselves become components of the state of nature. In a few decades, all other traces of the settlement will have vanished.|$|E
25|$|Recently, NASA has {{announced}} {{the discovery of}} 7 earth-like planets in the TRAPPIST-1 system orbiting an ultra-cool dwarf star 40 light-years away from our solar system. NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope has revealed the first known system of seven Earth-size planets around a single star. Three of these planets are firmly located in the habitable zone, {{the area around the}} parent star where a rocky planet is most likely to have liquid water. The discovery sets a new record for greatest number of habitable-zone planets found around a single star outside our solar system. All of these seven planets could have liquid water – key to {{life as we know it}} – under the right atmospheric conditions, but the <b>chances</b> <b>are</b> highest with the three in the habitable zone.|$|E
25|$|The {{location}} must be well-suited to {{the purpose}} of beaching whales. It is against the law to kill pilot whales at locations with inappropriate conditions. The seabed must gradually slope from the shore out to deep water. Given such conditions, the <b>chances</b> <b>are</b> good that the whales can be driven fully ashore or close enough to the shore that they can be killed from land. When a school of pilot whales is sighted, boats gather behind them and slowly drive them towards the chosen authorized location, usually a bay or the end of a fjord. There are 23 towns, villages or bays (Viðvík is not populated) that have the right conditions, and therefore legal authorization, for beaching whales. These are in alphabetical order: Bøur, Fámjin, Fuglafjørður, Húsavík, Hvalba (and Nes-Hvalba), Hvalvík, Hvannasund, Klaksvík, Leynar, Miðvágur, Norðragøta, Norðskáli, Sandur, Syðrugøta, Tjørnuvík, Tórshavn (in Sandagerð), Tvøroyri, Vágur, Vestmanna, Viðvík (near Hvannasund, but on the east coast of Viðoy) and Øravík.|$|E
