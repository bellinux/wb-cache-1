This allows for the direction of cell processes such as proliferation, differentiation, and spreading.

25|$|Cell–cell {{adhesion}} complexes {{are essential}} {{for the formation of}} complex animal tissues. β-catenin is part of a protein complex that form the so-called adherens junctions. These cell-cell adhesion complexes are necessary for the creation and maintenance of epithelial cell layers and barriers. As a component of the complex, β-catenin can regulate cell growth and adhesion between cells. It may also be responsible for transmitting the <b>contact</b> <b>inhibition</b> signal that causes cells to stop dividing once the epithelial sheet is complete. The E-cadherin – β-catenin – α-catenin complex is weakly associated to actin filaments. Adherent junctions thus form a dynamic, rather than a stable link to the actin cytoskeleton.|$|E
40|$|SummarySynaptic {{inhibition}} plays a {{key role}} in shaping the dynamics of neuronal networks and selecting cell assemblies. Typically, an inhibitory axon contacts a particular dendritic subdomain of its target neuron, where it often makes 10 – 20 synapses, sometimes on very distal branches. The functional implications of such a connectivity pattern are not well understood. Our experimentally based theoretical study highlights several new and counterintuitive principles for dendritic inhibition. We show that distal “off-path” rather than proximal “on-path” inhibition effectively dampens proximal excitable dendritic “hotspots,” thus powerfully controlling the neuron's output. Additionally, with multiple synaptic <b>contacts,</b> <b>inhibition</b> operates globally, spreading centripetally hundreds of micrometers from the inhibitory synapses. Consequently, inhibition in regions lacking inhibitory synapses may exceed that at the synaptic sites themselves. These results offer new insights into the synergetic effect of dendritic inhibition in controlling dendritic excitability and plasticity and in dynamically molding functional dendritic subdomains and their output...|$|R
40|$|A {{stoichiometric}} {{complex of}} human stefin B and carboxymethylated papain has been crystallized in a trigonal crystal form. Data to 2. 37 A resolution were collected using the area detector diffractometer FAST. The crystal {{structure of the}} complex has been solved by Patterson search techniques using papain as search model. Starting from the structure of chicken cystatin, the stefin structure was elucidated through cycles of model building and crystallographic refinement. The current crystallographic R factor is 0. 19. Like cystatin, the stefin molecule consists of a five stranded beta-sheet wrapped around a five turn alpha-helix, but with an additional carboxy terminal strand running along the convex side of the sheet. Topological equivalence of stefin and cystatin reveal the previous sequence alignment to be incorrect in part, through deletion of the intermediate helix. The conserved residues form a tripartite wedge, which slots into the papain active site as proposed through consideration of the tertiary structures of the individual components (Bode et al., 1988). The main interactions are provided by the amino terminal 'trunk' (occupying the 'unprimed' subsites of the enzyme), and by the first hairpin loop, containing the highly conserved QVVAG sequence, with minor contributions from the second hairpin loop. The carboxyl terminus of stefin provides an additional interaction region with respect to cystatin. The interaction is dominated by hydrophobic <b>contacts.</b> <b>Inhibition</b> by the cysteine proteinase inhibitors is fundamentally different to that observed for the serine proteinase inhibitors...|$|R
40|$|GABA is {{the major}} {{inhibitory}} neurotransmitter in the adult brain and mechanisms of GABAergic inhibition have been intensely investigated in the past decades. Recent studies provided evidence for an important role of astrocytes in shaping GABAergic currents. One of the most obvious, but yet poorly understood, mechanisms of the cross-talk between GABAergic currents and astrocytes is metabolism including neurotransmitter homeostasis. In particular, how modulation of GABAergic currents by astrocytes depends on key enzymes involved in cellular metabolism remains largely unknown. To address this issue, we have considered two simple models of neuronal cultures: nominally astrocyte-free neuronal culture (NC) and neuronal-astrocytic co-cultures (ANCC) and miniature Inhibitory Postsynaptic Currents (mIPSCs) were recorded in control conditions and {{in the presence of}} respective enzyme blockers. We report that enrichment of neuronal culture with astrocytes results in a marked increase in mIPSC frequency. This enhancement of GABAergic activity was accompanied by increased number of GAD 65 and vGAT puncta, indicating that at least a part of the frequency enhancement was due to increased number of synaptic <b>contacts.</b> <b>Inhibition</b> of glutamine synthetase (with MSO) strongly reduced mIPSC frequency in ANCC but had no effect in NC. Moreover, treatment of ANCC with inhibitor of glycogen phosphorylase (BAYU 6751) or with selective inhibitor of astrocytic Krebs cycle,fluoroacetate, resulted in a marked reduction of mIPSC frequency in ANCC having no effect in NC. We conclude that GABAergic synaptic transmission strongly depends on neuron-astrocyte interaction in a manner dependent on key metabolic enzymes {{as well as on the}} Krebs cycle...|$|R
25|$|NF II {{is caused}} by a defect in the gene that {{normally}} gives rise to a product called Merlin or Schwannomin, located on chromosome 22 band q11-13.1. This peptide is thought to have a tumor-suppressive function. In a normal cell, the concentrations of active (dephosphorylated) merlin are controlled by processes such as cell adhesion (which would indicate the need to restrain cell division). It is known that Merlin's deficiency can result in unmediated progression through the cell cycle {{due to the lack of}} contact-mediated tumour suppression, sufficient to result in the tumors characteristic of Neurofibromatosis type II. Mutations of NF II is presumed to result in either a failure to synthesize Merlin or the production of a defective peptide that lacks the normal tumor-suppressive effect. The Schwannomin-peptide consists of 595 amino acids. Comparison of Schwannomin with other proteins shows similarities to proteins that connect the cytoskeleton to the cell membrane. Mutations in the Schwannomin-gene are thought to alter the movement and shape of affected cells with loss of <b>contact</b> <b>inhibition.</b>|$|E
25|$|Semaphorin-neuropilin repulsive {{signaling}} works synergistically with EphB signaling {{to guide}} neural crest cells down the rostral half of somites in mice. In chick embryos, semaphorin {{acts in the}} cephalic region to guide neural crest cells through the pharyngeal arches. On top of repulsive repulsive signaling, neural crest cells express β1and α4 integrins which allows for binding and guided interaction with collagen, laminin, and fibronectin of the extracellular matrix as they travel. Additionally, crest cells have intrinsic <b>contact</b> <b>inhibition</b> with one another while freely invading tissues of different origin such as mesoderm. Neural crest cells that migrate through the rostral half of somites differentiate into sensory and sympathetic neurons of the peripheral nervous system. The other main route neural crest cells take is dorsolaterally between the epidermis and the dermamyotome. Cells migrating through this path differentiate into pigment cells of the dermis. Further neural crest cell differentiation and specification into their final cell type is biased by their spatiotemporal subjection to morphogenic cues such as BMP, Wnt, FGF, Hox, and Notch.|$|E

2500|$|Neural crest cell {{migration}} {{occurs in a}} rostral to caudal direction without the need of a neuronal scaffold such as along a radial glial cell. For this reason the crest {{cell migration}} process is termed “free migration”. Instead of scaffolding on progenitor cells, neural crest migration {{is the result of}} repulsive guidance via EphB/EphrinB and semaphorin/neuropilin [...] signaling, interactions with the extracellular matrix, and <b>contact</b> <b>inhibition</b> with one another. While Ephrin and Eph proteins have the capacity to undergo bi-directional signaling, neural crest cell repulsion employs predominantly forward signaling to initiate a response within the receptor bearing neural crest cell. Burgeoning neural crest cells express EphB, a receptor tyrosine kinase, which binds the EphrinB transmembrane ligand expressed in the caudal half of each somite. When these two domains interact it causes receptor tyrosine phosphorylation, activation of rhoGTPases, and eventual cytoskeletal rearrangements within the crest cells inducing them to repel. This phenomenon allows neural crest cells to funnel through the rostral portion of each somite.|$|E

40|$|We have {{previously}} shown that maintenance of primitive human hematopoietic stem cells is poor when cultured {{in contact with}} marrow stromal feeders. However, when separated from stromal contact, human progenitors can be maintained because adhesion mediated proliferation inhibition does not occur. In this study we demonstrate how the murine fetal liver cell line, AFT 024, supports primitive human hematopoiesis better in contact cultures compared to primary feeders. We evaluated if better progenitor maintenance in contact with AFT 024 cells {{can be explained by}} decreased adhesion itself or decreased adhesion mediated inhibition of proliferation. We show that primitive human hematopoietic cells adhered equally well to AFT 024 and primary feeders, such as M 2 - 10 B 4. Further, contact with metabolically inactive AFT 024 cells prevented cell cycle progression and decreased maintenance of primitive progenitors to the same extent as contact with M 2 - 10 B 4 feeders. However, contact with viable AFT 024 feeders did not inhibit proliferation, suggesting that AFT 024 -factors counteract <b>contact</b> mediated <b>inhibition</b> of proliferation. Cytokine production by M 2 - 10 B 4 and AFT 024 cells was similar. Large-size O-sulfated heparan sulfate glycosaminoglycans, known to be important for hematopoietic support, were found only in AFT 024 -matrix. We hypothesize that these factors may explain, in part, our observations. Finally, we show that more than 100 % of primitive myeloid progenitors could be maintained for at least five weeks when cultured in contact with AFT 024 feeders in the presence of Interleukin- 3 and Macrophage Inflammatory Protein- 1 alpha.

However, aging and spontaneous differentiation of MSCs during culture expansion dampen their effectiveness. Previous studies suggest that ex vivo aging of MSCs is largely caused by epigenetic changes particularly a decline of histone H 3 acetylation levels in promoter regions of pluripotent genes due to inappropriate growth environment. Methodology/Principal Findings: In this study, we examined whether histone deacetylase inhibitor trichostatin A (TSA) could suppress the histone H 3 deacetylation thus maintaining the primitive property of MSCs. We found that in regular adherent culture, human MSCs became flatter and larger upon successive passaging, while the expression of pluripotent genes such as Oct 4, Sox 2, Nanog, Rex- 1, CD 133 and TERT decreased markedly. Administration of low concentrations of TSA in culture significantly suppressed the morphological changes in MSCs otherwise occurred during culture expansion, increased their proliferation while retaining their cell <b>contact</b> growth <b>inhibition</b> property and multipotent differentiation ability. Moreover, TSA stabilized the expression of the above pluripotent genes and histone H 3 acetylation levels in K 9 and K 14 in promoter regions of Oct 4, Sox 2 and TERT.
