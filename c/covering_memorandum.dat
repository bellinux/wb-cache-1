40|$|Report by CGIAR Executive Secretary Curtis Farrar on {{developments}} at WARDA {{during the}} first five months of 1985. A <b>covering</b> <b>memorandum</b> sets forth the schedule for interaction between the CGIAR and WARDA {{for the remainder of the}} year, and refers to a TAC subcommittee report, which was attached to the record of TAC 37. The report of a CGIAR financial team visit to WARDA is attached. There is mention of a report of the Fifteenth Ordinary Session of the Scientific and Technical Committee Meeting of WARDA, but this is not attached. The documentation included constituted the basis for a CGIAR discussion of WARDA at the Mid Term Meeting held in June 1985. This report completed the series of three monitoring reports suggested by TAC in its commentary on the external reviews of WARDA. It was clear that a number of issues remained to be addresse...|$|E

S. in conduct of foreign relations, led to friction between departments, in Washington and between {{men in the}} field, and to inefficient and costly duplication of effort; President approved yesterday plan recommended by Depts. of State, Agriculture, and Commerce whereby Foreign Services of the three Departments would be consolidated into that of State; plan to be submitted to Congress next week; {{an editorial in the}} [Philadelphia] Ledger appearing shortly after might be helpful in preventing thoughtless adverse criticism of the measure; sending <b>memorandum</b> <b>covering</b> main outline of plan...|$|R

"You {{remember}} Filmer," [...] Hicks {{writes to}} his friend Vance; [...] "well, HE hasn't altered a bit, the same hostile mumble and the nasty chin--how CAN a man contrive to be always three days from shaving?--and a sort of furtive air of being engaged in sneaking in front of one; even his coat and that frayed collar of his show no further signs of the passing years. He was writing in the library and I sat down beside him {{in the name of}} God's charity, whereupon he deliberately insulted me by <b>covering</b> up his <b>memoranda.</b> It seems he has some brilliant research on hand that he suspects me of all people--with a Bodley Booklet a-printing!--of stealing. He has taken remarkable honours at the University--he went through them with a sort of hasty slobber, as though he feared I might interrupt him before he had told me all--and he spoke of taking his D.Sc. as one might speak of taking a cab. And he asked what I was doing--with a sort of comparative accent, and his arm was spread nervously, positively a protecting arm, over the paper that hid the precious idea--his one hopeful idea.|$|R
5000|$|Finally, in March 1985, the {{leadership}} of the Akali party began to be released from jail under orders from the new prime minister Rajiv Gandhi. With a view to improving the situation and creating the conditions for a negotiated settlement of Sikh demands, the prime minister's confidante, Arjun Singh who was posted as the Governor of the state, also relaxed the censorship on the Punjabi press, withdrew army control over certain districts, announced his willingness to institute a judicial enquiry into the November 1984 killings, lifted the ban on the All India Sikh Students Federation and agreed to review the cases of thousands of Sikhs imprisoned since the army's arrival in Punjab the previous June. Within a few days, the first 53 were released. A few days later, Rajiv made an effort to address the economic woes of Punjab, with its diminishing acreages and burgeoning unemployment by announcing the establishment of a rail coach factory at Kapurthala, Punjab which would need about 20,000 skilled hands. [...] Then, after weeks of secret negotiations, Harcharnd Singh Longowal met the Prime Minister in Delhi and on July 23, 1985 signed an eleven-point <b>memorandum</b> <b>covering</b> all the major issues which had defied resolution since the Akalis had first presented their list of demands. Dr Harjinder Singh Dilgeer says that this was the most shameful and honour-less agreement ever signed by the Sikh leaders, as no demand of the Sikhs had been accepted. Those who had induced Longowal to sign this agreement included Prof. Atar Singh and Prithipal Singh Kapur.|$|R
