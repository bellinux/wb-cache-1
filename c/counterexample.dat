5|$|Another {{application}} of such chain conditions is in Noetherian induction—also known as well-founded induction—which is a generalization of mathematical induction. It frequently {{is used to}} reduce general statements about collections of objects to statements about specific objects in that collection. Suppose that S is a partially ordered set. One way of proving a statement about the objects of S is to assume {{the existence of a}} <b>counterexample</b> and deduce a contradiction, thereby proving the contrapositive of the original statement. The basic premise of Noetherian induction is that every non-empty subset of S contains a minimal element. In particular, the set of all counterexamples contains a minimal element, the minimal <b>counterexample.</b> In order to prove the original statement, therefore, it suffices to prove something seemingly much weaker: For any <b>counterexample,</b> there is a smaller <b>counterexample.</b>|$|E

In bioinformatics, clique-finding algorithms have been used to infer evolutionary trees, predict protein structures, and find closely interacting clusters of proteins. Listing the cliques in a dependency graph is an important step in the analysis of certain random processes.

40|$|The {{paper is}} {{a survey of}} recent results on {{algorithmic}} learning (inductive inference) of languages from full collection of positive examples and some negative data. Different types of negative data are considered. We primarily concentrate on learning using (1) carefully chosen finite negative data (2) negative <b>counterexamples</b> provided when conjectures contain data not in the target language (3) negative <b>counterexamples</b> obtained from a teacher (formally, oracle), when a learner queries the oracle if an hypothesis is contained in the target language.

5|$|Further {{indicative}} of the role cognitive flexibility plays in education is the argument that how students are taught greatly impacts the nature and formation of their cognitive structures, which in turn affect students’ ability to store and readily access information. A crucial aim of education is to help students learn as well as appropriately apply and adapt {{what they have learned}} to novel situations. This is reflected in the integration of cognitive flexibility into educational policy regarding academic guidelines and expectations. For example, as outlined in the , a standards-based education reform developed to increase high school graduation rates, educators are expected to present within the classroom “high level cognitive demands by asking students to demonstrate deep conceptual understanding through the application of content knowledge and skills to new situations.” This guideline within the Common Core Initiative is the essence of cognitive flexibility, and a teaching style focused on promoting it has been seen to foster understanding especially in disciplines where information is complex and nonlinear. A <b>counterexample</b> is evident in cases where such material is presented in an oversimplified manner and learners fail to transfer their knowledge to a new domain.|$|E

25|$|One {{possible}} {{attack on}} the cycle double cover problem would be {{to show that there}} cannot exist a minimum <b>counterexample,</b> by proving that any graph contains a reducible configuration, a subgraph that can be replaced by a smaller subgraph {{in a way that would}} preserve the existence or nonexistence of a cycle double cover. For instance, if a cubic graph contains a triangle, a Δ-Y transform will replace the triangle by a single vertex; any cycle double cover of the smaller graph can be extended back to a cycle double cover of the original cubic graph. Therefore, a minimal <b>counterexample</b> to the cycle double cover conjecture must be a triangle-free graph, ruling out some snarks such as Tietze's graph which contain triangles. Through computer searches, it is known that every cycle of length 11 or less in a cubic graph forms a reducible configuration, and therefore that any minimal <b>counterexample</b> to the cycle double cover conjecture must have girth at least 12.|$|E

For example, the Mertens conjecture is a statement about natural numbers that is now known to be false, but no explicit <b>counterexample</b> (i.e., a natural number n for which the Mertens function M(n) equals or exceeds the square root of n) is known: all numbers less than 1014 have the Mertens property, and the smallest number {{that does not have}} this property is only known to be less than the exponential of 1.59×1040, which is approximately 10 to the power 4.3×1039. Since the number of particles in the universe is generally considered less than 10 to the power 100 (a googol), there is no hope to find an explicit <b>counterexample</b> by exhaustive search.|$|E

40|$|The {{conditional}} analysis of ability faces familiar <b>counterexamples</b> involving cases of volitional incapacity.

We argue that this error-theoretic response fails. Either it succeeds in solving the problem of volitional incapacity at the cost of making the {{conditional analysis}} vulnerable to obvious <b>counterexamples</b> to its necessity.

40|$|Counterexample-guided {{inductive}} synthesis (CEGIS) is used {{to synthesize}} programs from a candi-date space of programs.

But the technique {{may or may not}} terminate with the correct program if the candidate space of programs is infinite. In this paper, we perform a theoreti-cal analysis of counterexample-guided inductive synthesis technique. We investigate whether the set of candidate spaces for which the correct program can be synthesized using CEGIS depends on the <b>counterexamples</b> used in inductive synthesis, that is, whether there are good mistakes which would increase the synthesis power. We investigate whether the use of minimal <b>counterexamples</b> instead of arbitrary <b>counterexamples</b> expands the set of candidate spaces of programs for which inductive synthesis can successfully synthesize a correct program. We consider two kinds of counterexamples: minimal <b>counterexamples</b> and history bounded <b>counterexamples.</b> The history bounded counterexam-ple used in any iteration of CEGIS is bounded by the examples used in previous iterations of inductive synthesis. We examine the relative change in power of inductive synthesis in both cases.
