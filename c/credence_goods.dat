50|$|In an {{unregulated}} market, {{prices of}} <b>credence</b> <b>goods</b> tend to converge, i.e. the same flat rate is charged for {{high and low}} value goods. The reason is that suppliers of <b>credence</b> <b>goods</b> tend to overcharge for low value goods, since the customers {{are not aware of}} the low value, while competitive pressures force down the price of high value goods.|$|E
5000|$|A {{credence}} good {{is a good}} whose utility {{impact is}} difficult or impossible for the consumer to ascertain. In contrast to experience goods, the utility gain or loss of <b>credence</b> <b>goods</b> is difficult to measure after consumption as well.

30|$|Therefore, theory {{suggests}} that institutions such as third-party standards and certification, liability regimes, and verifiability rules must be used to solve the <b>credence</b> <b>good</b> problem and allow a market for items such as organic food to exist (Caswell and Padberg 1992; McCluskey 2000; Giannakas 2002).|$|R
30|$|Although {{we do not}} {{yet know}} the {{conditions}} under which a producer is likely to seek certification, this is nonetheless a good place to pause and explore how certification, assuming it is obtained, will affect the quality of a <b>credence</b> <b>good.</b> I do this by comparing the optimal quality of a certified good to the optimal quality of a non-certified good.|$|R
50|$|In this context, trade-marks {{fulfill a}} trust {{function}} {{to the extent}} that they provide a more reliable market for consumers, who can't immediately tell if <b>credence</b> <b>goods</b> are trustworthy or not. Honest sellers can develop and provide more desirable products.|$|E
50|$|Post-experience goods, {{also called}} <b>credence</b> <b>goods,</b> are goods {{for which it}} is {{difficult}} for consumers to ascertain the quality even after they have consumed them, such as vitamin supplements. Potential consumers of these goods may require third-party information, provided by private rating agencies or government bodies.|$|E
50|$|Services {{marketers}} {{have argued}} that risk perception is higher for services because they lack the search attributes of products (i.e. tangible properties that can be inspected prior to consumption). In terms of risk perception, marketers and economists identify three broad classes of purchase; search goods, experience goods and <b>credence</b> <b>goods</b> with implications for consumer evaluation processes. Search goods, which include most tangible products, possess tangible characteristics that allow consumers to evaluate quality prior to purchase and consumption. Experience goods, such as restaurants and clubs, can only be evaluated with certainty after purchase or consumption. In the case of <b>credence</b> <b>goods,</b> such as many professional services, the consumer finds it difficult to fully appreciate {{the quality of the}} goods even after purchase and consumption has occurred. Difficulties evaluating quality after consumption may arise because the cost of obtaining information is prohibitive, or because the consumer lacks the requisite skills and knowledge to undertake such evaluations. These goods are called credence products because the consumer’s quality evaluations depend entirely on the trust given to the product manufacturer or service provider.|$|E
30|$|The goal of {{this paper}} is not to explain how a {{consumer}} comes to trust various claims about a <b>credence</b> <b>good’s</b> quality, although {{it is worth noting that}} a given consumer’s type might depend on the setting (e.g., one could be “trusting” at a farmers’ market but “typical” in a grocery store). Instead, the purpose is to point out the different beliefs and then explore the implications of each.|$|R
40|$|This paper investigates {{barriers}} to effective knowledge spillovers for markets {{in which the}} product {{can be characterized as}} a <b>credence</b> <b>good,</b> i. e. its complexity impedes the evaluation of quality by customers both ex-ante and ex-post. We focus on the German market for energy efficiency consultants, as an emerging and subsidized sector in which the service offered has strong <b>credence</b> <b>good</b> properties. Based upon in-depth interviews with stakeholders, we analyze the determinants and {{barriers to}} knowledge spillovers. We find that the incentive to foster spillovers to increase suppliers 4 knowledge is limited by the difficult commercialization of additional capabilities. The implementation of a public certification scheme has failed to increase the sectoral knowledge spillovers. By contrast, the participation in formal knowledge networks has been more effective in prompting companies to foster knowledge spillovers, which has also led to a higher degree of specialization. We conclude that access to certification schemes should be further restricted to increase market transparency and private networks should be supported to achieve the aim of increasing knowledge spillovers...|$|R
40|$|With a <b>credence</b> <b>good,</b> {{consumers}} are never {{sure about the}} extent of the good that they actually need. Experts such as doctors and lawyers, as well as auto mechanics and appliance service-persons (the sellers) not only provide the services, but also act as the expert in determining the customer's requirements. This information asymmetry between buyers and the seller creates strong incentives for the seller to cheat. We analyze whether the market mechanism may induce non-fraudulent seller behavior...|$|R
5000|$|<b>Credence</b> <b>goods</b> may {{display a}} direct (rather than inverse) {{relationship}} between price and demand, similar to Veblen goods, when price {{is the only}} possible indicator of quality. The least expensive products might be avoided {{in order to avoid}} suspected fraud and poor quality. [...] So a restaurant customer may avoid the cheapest wine on the menu, but instead purchase something slightly more expensive. However, even after drinking it the buyer is unable to evaluate its relative value compared to all the wines they have not tried (unless they are a wine expert).|$|E
50|$|Perceived risk is {{associated}} with all purchasing decisions, both products and services alike. In terms of risk perception, marketers and economists argue that perceived purchase risk is higher for experience goods and <b>credence</b> <b>goods</b> with implications for consumer evaluation processes. Given that perceived risk drives the search for information in the pre-purchase stages of the consumer's decision process, consumers of services {{are more likely to}} engage in information acquisition activities as a means of ameliorating that risk. Any activity that a consumer undertakes in an effort to reduce perceived risk is known as a risk reduction activity.|$|E

40|$|Certified {{labeling}} for credence attributes {{is examined}} using {{the concepts of}} pooled and separating equilibria. The analysis addresses a latent <b>credence</b> <b>good</b> demand that differs from a conventional good demand by willingness {{to pay for the}} credence characteristic. Third-party certified labeling vertically differentiates the two products and a two separate markets replace a single pooled market. Market outcomes are examined theoretically and with empirical simulations. Costless labeling is net welfare improving, but impacts are highly asymmetric. Credence producers gain largely at the expense of conventional producers. Costly labeling may reduce welfare even with rather modest labeling costs. Marketing,...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} a monopolist's behavior when consumers cannot {{observe the}} production standards. These types of products are usually known as <b>credence</b> <b>goods.</b> The steady-state level of quality with <b>credence</b> <b>goods</b> {{is found to}} be lower than that with experience goods, and perfect information goods. The finding that only per-ceived quality, which is effectively a filtered version oftrue quality, affects reputation indicates rewards for high quality production are lower in the credence good case. Further, an increase in the level of monitoring can increase the true level of product quality in the market for <b>credence</b> <b>goods.</b> Key words: <b>credence</b> <b>goods,</b> production standards, reputatio...|$|E
40|$|With <b>credence</b> <b>goods</b> {{consumers}} cannot judge actual quality neither before purchase - ex ante - nor after purchase - ex post -.

Applying Choquet-Expected Utility theory, a general model of <b>credence</b> <b>goods</b> is developed which takes {{the problem of}} trust explicitly in its view and generalizes the problem of quality uncertainty on the ?market for lemons? of Akerlof (1970) to ?quality ambiguity? with <b>credence</b> <b>goods.</b> The model shows the market mechanism only performing well in providing <b>credence</b> <b>goods</b> when consumers? trust in given information is not too low. With trust too low, sellers of <b>credence</b> <b>goods</b> will be driven {{out of the market}} by trust induced adverse selection.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} two {{chapters on}} <b>credence</b> <b>goods</b> {{and one on}} ongoing partnerships in an infinitely repeated game. The chapters on <b>credence</b> <b>goods</b> focus on the welfare and efficiency of equilibria in overcharging models of <b>credence</b> <b>goods,</b> something {{which has not been}} explicitly addressed before. The chapter on partnerships presents a theory explaining ongoing partnerships as solving a commitment problem for clients. There is a small literature on partnerships, and this chapter represents a novel but complimentary approach to that literature. At core, chapters 2, 3 and 4 of this thesis ask the following questions respectively: Do competition and information increase welfare in <b>credence</b> <b>goods</b> markets? How do customers in <b>credence</b> <b>goods</b> markets discipline experts from committing fraud? Can these strategies be welfare ranked? Why do ongoing partnerships exist? What problem do they solve? This thesis is not currently available in ORA...|$|E
40|$|An {{increasing}} number of product labels is making environmental claims. Typically, these claims are non-veri¯able to consumers, they represent a credence attribute of the product. The usual way to han-dle this problem is external monitoring of such labels. We consider a model where ¯rms in a competitive market choose product quality {{and the intensity of}} monitoring. It is shown that all the ¯rms producing the high quality <b>credence</b> <b>good</b> will choose the same level of monitor-ing, i. e., an industry standard will evolve. However, in a competitive equilibrium there will be more monitoring than is socially desirable...|$|R
30|$|A {{producer}} {{must answer}} two questions: (1) will the producer’s <b>goods</b> contain <b>credence</b> qualities? and (2) will the producer seek certification? The producer of a <b>credence</b> <b>good,</b> like other producers, wants to maximize net benefits. In this model, the producer’s objective function {{is comprised of}} (1) the price received for the good, less (2) the cost of production and certification, plus (3) the “motivation benefit” of production, which is roughly an extrinsic or intrinsic reward from producing a good with certain qualities. The producer maximizes net benefit by choosing {{the quality of the}} good and whether or not to seek third-party certification.|$|R

Recent regulatory proposals and reforms have been offered {{as a means to}} provide some comfort for consumers about the quality advice that they might receive, yet the challenge remains about what is meant by ‘quality’ in this area. By referring to recent high profile collapses, we describe some factors and features that are generally considered as examples of poor quality advice. In this manner, we offer bounds on what quality can be represented by, and outline factors that can be considered by individuals when assessing the quality of any service being offered...|$|R

40|$|<b>Credence</b> <b>goods</b> markets {{suffer from}} inefficiencies arising from informational asymmetries between expert sellers and customers. While {{standard}} theory predicts that inefficiencies disappear if customers can verify the quality received, verifiability fails to yield efficiency in experiments with endogenous prices.

40|$|We {{establish}} {{an argument for}} fiscal restraints {{which is based on}} the idea that politicians are experts in the meaning of the <b>credence</b> <b>good</b> literature. A budget maximizing politician is better informed than the electorate about the necessary spending to ensure the states ability to provide services for the economy. Voters, being able to observe the budget but not the necessary level of spending, attenuate the government’s spending level via electoral control. A fiscal restraint limits the maximum spending a government will choose if the level of spending ensuring the politicians reelection is not sufficient to ensure the state’s ability to provide services to the economy. We determine when such a fiscal restraint improves voter welfare and discuss the role of the opposition in situations where very high levels of spending are required...|$|R

However, financial advice is a <b>credence</b> <b>good</b> and its quality is notoriously difficult to assess even ex-post. This paper aims {{to shed light on}} financial advisor characteristics that might serve as quality indicators. We surveyed 260 German independent financial advisors (IFA) and obtain three main findings. Firstly, there is a high degree of heterogeneity in quality among financial advisors. Secondly, the extent to which advisors receive compensation in the form of fixed fees instead of sales commissions as well as the extent to which advisors exhibit a high degree of rationality in decision making are predictive of high-quality financial advice. Taking the compensation scheme and rationality into account when selecting a financial advisor might therefore improve the investment decisions of households...|$|R
40|$|Applying {{a choice}} {{experiment}} on {{the choice of}} consumer goods we show that Swedish consumers do not regard GMO food as being equivalent to conventional food. A central argument by proponents of GMO is that the end products are identical to those where GMO has not been used. That respondents in our survey disagree with this argument is supported by two observations. First, a positive significant WTP is found for a mandatory labeling policy. This result confirms previous observations that GMO food can be a <b>credence</b> <b>good</b> causing a market failure. Second, consumers are also {{willing to pay a}} significantly higher product price to ensure a total ban on the use of GMO in animal fodder. Even if scientists and politicians argue that most of today’s GMO food is indistinguishable from GMO free food, the consumers disagree. ...|$|R

30|$|In short, the {{empirical}} literature has many excellent studies that demonstrate producers consider more than profit when {{deciding whether to}} include credence qualities and seek certification. The literature also shows that certification {{is not the only}} way market participants overcome the asymmetric information problems posed by <b>credence</b> <b>goods.</b> These studies point to the need for a theoretic framework to think about the mechanism by which producer motives alter the decision to produce and certify <b>credence</b> <b>goods.</b> This paper is a first attempt at such a framework.|$|E
30|$|Various {{forms of}} {{regulation}} {{are often used}} to improve the performance of markets when relevant information is lacking. A good example is markets for “credence goods” or goods with characteristics that are difficult or impossible for consumers to observe even after purchase and use (Darby and Karni 1973). <b>Credence</b> <b>goods</b> included goods such as organic food, fair trade goods, energy-efficient appliances, automobile repairs, and medical services. The information asymmetries inherent in <b>credence</b> <b>goods</b> have typically led economists to conclude these markets require well-defined quality standards and third-party verification that producers are meeting those standards.|$|E
40|$|Due to {{specific}} production conditions consultancies have advantages over firms from other industries {{in assessing the}} quality of human capital. But only top-management-consulting firms will economize on these advantages by offering filtering services to the labor market. We assume top-management-consulting to be a <b>credence</b> <b>good,</b> whose quality cannot be signaled via reputation. However, production technology makes the human capital of any consultant observable to his clients. Being the only im-portant input factor into the production process high quality human capital {{may serve as a}} valid signal for high quality consulting. In our argument superior possibilities and strong incentives of top-management-consulting firms to perform filtering services hold as an explanation for their strong position among the most successful recruiters of high potentials. Using such filtering services in an otherwise pooled labor market is benefi-cial to both, high potentials and their employers. ...|$|R
30|$|One {{important}} parameter is {{the mean}} of f(Q), which represents the expected level of quality the consumer attaches to the good {{in the absence of}} trust in the producer or the certification standard. The default value of {{the mean of}} f(Q) was assumed to be 0.1. However, when a certification standard or producer does not provide a consumer with useful information about a <b>credence</b> <b>good,</b> the consumer could form expectations about the good’s quality in many different ways, such as a producer’s reputation, word of mouth, or information from other “experts” like the retailer, and their expectations {{about the quality of the}} good could vary greatly. I found that when the mean of f(Q) increases, the zone of certification shrinks. If the consumer already thinks the <b>good</b> has many <b>credence</b> qualities, certification will add little, if anything, to the consumer’s willingness to pay. Consequently, the certified price premium falls and the zone of certification shrinks.|$|R
30|$|Economic {{models of}} quality hit {{a dead end}} {{when they come to}} {{discussion}} of <b>credence</b> attributes or <b>goods</b> because information is so imperfect that these markets for quality simply do not function well.|$|R
