Conversely, Paul Trynka of Classic Rock magazine singles out [...] "Ding Dong, Ding Dong" [...] as the one song that [...] "embarrasses" [...] on an album that is otherwise [...] "packed with beautiful, small-scale moments". Trynka labels it [...] "George's own Frog Chorus", with reference to McCartney's 1984 children's song, [...] "We All Stand Together", and adds: [...] "its <b>clunking</b> glam evokes those horrible 70s TV shows where DJs drool over dollybirds in hotpants." ...|$|E

Insall-Salvati ratio, position of joint line, postoperative patellar height and anterior-posterior position of tibial tray were measured. We found that post-operative low-lying patella (p< 0. 001) and anterior placement of tibial tray (p= 0. 011) was associated with patellar <b>clunk</b> syndrome. Thirteen patients had bilateral total knee replacements of the same prosthesis (5 bilateral AMK and 8 bilateral IB) but unilateral patellar <b>clunk</b> syndrome. The non-clunk sides were used as control for comparison with the <b>clunk</b> sides. The congruency and tilting of the patellar button in the skyline view were documented.

40|$|Objective: To {{study the}} {{difference}} of post-op patellofemoral pain, <b>clunk</b> and crepitus in patients with/without resurfacing at 5 years who had pre-op patellofemoral pain. To study the inci-dence of post-operative patellofemoral pain, <b>clunk</b> and crepitus following patelloplasty in both the groups. Methods: Retrospec-tive review of 765 patients who had total knee replacement with/without resurfacing. Patients were asked about both pre-operative pain and also post-operative pain 5 years after the operation. Patients were examined by a specialist nurse at 5 years post-operatively to check for any patellofemoral clunk/ Acta Ortop Bras. 2012; 20 (5) : 300 - 2 crepitus. Conclusion: In patients with pre-op PF pain, there is significant (p< 0. 005) higher incidence of post-op <b>clunk</b> in the R group. In patients without pre-op PF pain, there is significantly (p< 0. 005) higher incidence of post-op crepitus in the R group. In patients with/without pre-op PF pain, the incidence of post-op PF pain, <b>clunk</b> and crepitus is lower than in patients who underwent patelloplasty {{when compared to the}} other members of the NR group (statistically significant p< 0. 005).

5000|$|While {{there was}} praise for its ambitious scope, {{production}} values and action, {{the film was}} overall poorly received, criticized for being tedious and slow, {{as well as the}} ethnicity of its lead actors (namely Banderas and Strong). [...] "Touted as the Arab breakthrough into the international cinema arena, Black Gold pits Mark Strong and Antonio Banderas against each other as warring emirs torn between the traditional ways and modern temptations. But despite its honourable intentions, Black Gold hits the ground with a terrible <b>clunking</b> thud, its broken-English dialogue squeezing the life out of it practically from the off," [...] The Guardian's Andrew Pulver wrote in his analysis.|$|E

Though having changed little in effect over the decades, editing has changed enormously in feeling: only one line {{of the program was}} 'displayed' at a time (physically printing it out on the paper); inserted text was printed below the point in the line where it was being inserted, and the rubout key merely crossed-out the text that was to be deleted; the string-find and string-substitute facilities were very rudimentary; and the teleprinter worked at 110 baud (making an enormous <b>clunking</b> and whirring racket as it did so).|$|E

For this purpose, objective methods for quantitative evaluation of rotatory laxity, such as accelerometers [3, 106], image analysis, or electromagnetic devices [55] would contribute to a more accurate diagnosis of ALL injury, and could represent the future direction of clinical diagnosis of ALL injuries.|$|R
60|$|We {{were pushing}} upstream, late one afternoon, {{to the big}} lake at the {{headwaters}} of a wilderness river.

We were silent, as men always are to whom the woods have spoken their deepest message, and to whom the next turn of the river may bring its thrill of unexpected things.|$|R

Thankfully, there's {{a great deal of}} talent on the screen, though the words generally sound far better when sung than spoken." [...] R. Thomas Umstead of Multichannel News awarded the movie 3.5 stars out of 5, writing, [...] "Much like Teen Beach Movie, the sequel is full of impressive dance numbers, often silly dialogue and toe-tapping pop music songs that will certainly appeal to the network's target 6-to-11-year-old audience. Still, Teen Beach 2 lacks a bit of the charm exhibited in the first movie, although that will not matter much to fans of the original." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "The {{traditional}} Conservative {{vision of}} welfare {{as a safety}} net encompasses another outdated Tory nostrum - that poverty is absolute, not relative. Churchill's safety net is at the bottom: holding people at subsistence level, just above the abyss of hunger and homelessness. It is the social commentator Polly Toynbee who supplies imagery that is more appropriate for Conservative social policy in the twenty first century."This approach generated much comment and analysis. It was followed two days later by Cameron saying poverty should be seen in relative terms {{to the rest of}} society, where people lack those things which others in society take for granted, [...] "those who think otherwise are wrong ... I believe that poverty is an economic waste, a moral disgrace. ... We will only tackle the causes of poverty if we give a bigger role to society, tackling poverty is a social responsibility ... Labour rely too heavily on redistributing money, and on the large, <b>clunking</b> mechanisms of the state." ...|$|E
2500|$|Savile {{presented}} {{a series of}} Public Information Films promoting road safety, notably [...] "Clunk Click Every Trip", which promoted the use of seatbelts, the <b>clunk</b> representing {{the sound of the}} door and the click the sound of the seatbelt fastening. It led to Savile's Saturday-night chat/variety show from 1973 on BBC1 entitled <b>Clunk,</b> Click, which in 1974 featured the UK heats of the Eurovision Song Contest featuring Olivia Newton-John. After two series, <b>Clunk,</b> Click was replaced by Jim'll Fix It, which he presented from 1975 to 1994. Savile won an award from Mary Whitehouse's National Viewers' and Listeners' Association in 1977 for his [...] "wholesome family entertainment". He fronted a long-running series of advertisements in the early 1980s for British Rail's InterCity 125, in which he declared [...] "This is the age of the train".

Newman learns that bottles and cans can be refunded for 10 cents in Michigan (as opposed to 5 cents in New York and many other states), but Kramer tells him it's impossible to gain a profit from depositing the bottles in Michigan due to the total gas, tollbooth and truck rental fees that would compile during the trip, noting his own failed attempts because he [...] "couldn't crunch the numbers."

5000|$|The episode {{received}} positive reviews. Mark Snow of IGN {{gave the}} episode 9.1/10, praising the final conversation between the Doctor and River Song, {{as well as}} the revelation about Clara; however he noted that the Great Intelligence was [...] "a little underwhelming" [...] and [...] "not very threatening", and that while the Whispermen impressed initially, they did not [...] "make a great villain." [...] Michael Hogan of The Daily Telegraph said that the episode was [...] "even better" [...] than the previous two. He noted that it was [...] "momentous, moving and thrilling". However, he also noted that the episode had [...] "a tad too much <b>clunking</b> exposition, the odd spot of creaky CGI and some unconvincing metaphors about soufflés and leaves." [...] Despite this, he called it a [...] "breathless, brilliant finale". Some advance coverage of the story assumed the Doctor's name would actually be revealed in the episode.

[...] Several compared the film to Michael Bay's Transformers film series in terms of quality and cinematic style, with Giles Hardie of The Sydney Morning Herald claiming that the movie [...] "finds the same balance between action-packed imagination and not taking the premise seriously that made Michael Bay's original Transformers such a joyride." [...] Andrew Harrison of Q magazine called the film [...] "crushingly stupid". Film critic Kenneth Turan, in a review written for the Los Angeles Times, also expressed disappointment, criticizing the film's [...] "humanoid aliens", stating that they are [...] "as ungainly as the movie itself, <b>clunking</b> around in awkward, protective suits." [...] He called the content [...] "all very earnest", but added [...] "it's {{not a whole lot}} of fun". Peter Travers of Rolling Stone gave the film one out of four stars, and he comment [...] "Battleship is all noise and crashing metal, sinking to the shallows of Michael Bay's Armageddon and then digging to the brain-extinction level of the Transformers trilogy." ...|$|E
