50|$|Primary task of {{the motion}} {{planning}} {{is to find a}} <b>collision</b> <b>free</b> trajectory. Nevertheless, in service robotics, other aspects must be additionally taken into account like safety and smoothness of the trajectories. In order to suffice all these requirements for FRIEND a sensor-based motion planning for the manipulator was developed. The procedure is based on Cartesian space information, and therefore computationally efficient as well as with a high precision. The object grasping frames are calculated on-line which increases the flexibility of the system during execution. All implemented algorithms are suitable for real-time applications in service robotics but also for industrial usage.|$|E
5000|$|Musk first {{mentioned}} that {{he was thinking about}} a concept for a [...] "fifth mode of transport", calling it the Hyperloop, in July 2012 at a PandoDaily event in Santa Monica, California. This hypothetical high-speed mode of transportation would have the following characteristics: immunity to weather, <b>collision</b> <b>free,</b> twice the speed of a plane, low power consumption, and energy storage for 24-hour operations. The name Hyperloop was chosen because it would go in a loop. Musk envisions the more advanced versions will be able to go at hypersonic speed. In May 2013, Musk likened the Hyperloop to a [...] "cross between a Concorde and a railgun and an air hockey table".|$|E

50|$|STL {{and native}} dental CAD formats are {{imported}} into WorkNC Dental ready for “machining wizards” {{to guide the}} user through the manufacturing process. The system automatically selects tools, machining sequences and cutting conditions optimized for particular types of material, such as cobalt-chrome, titanium and zirconia, and for particular prostheses, such as copings and bridges. The intricate nature of some implants {{requires the use of}} 5-axis machining methods to reach every part of the job. Traditionally requiring highly skilled programmers, WorkNC Dental overcomes this problem with its automated 5-axis software. Intelligence within the system considers the limitations and kinematics of the machine tool itself to automatically produce reliable and <b>collision</b> <b>free</b> 5-axis toolpaths.|$|E
50|$|A fully {{switched}} network {{is a computer}} network which uses only network switches rather than Ethernet hubs on Ethernet networks. The switches allow for a dedicated connection to each workstation. A switch allows for many conversations to occur simultaneously. Before switches existed data could only be transmitted in one direction at a time, this was called half-duplex. By using a switch the network is able to maintain full-duplex Ethernet and makes it <b>collision</b> <b>free.</b> This means that data can now be transmitted in both directions at the same time. Fully {{switched network}}s employ either twisted-pair or fiber-optic cabling, both of which use separate conductors for sending and receiving data. In this type of environment, Ethernet nodes can forgo the collision detection process and transmit at will, since {{they are the only}} potential devices that can access the medium. This means that a fully switched network is a collision-free environment.|$|E
5000|$|The {{technique}} {{involves the}} expansion of a gas or mixture of gases through a de Laval nozzle from a high pressure reservoir into a vacuum chamber. As it expands, the nozzle collimates the gas into a uniform supersonic beam that is essentially <b>collision</b> <b>free</b> and has a temperature that, in the centre of mass frame, can be significantly below that of the reservoir gas. Each nozzle produces a characteristic temperature. This way, any temperature between room temperature and about 10K can be achieved. There are relatively few CRESU apparatuses in existence {{for the simple reason}} that the gas throughput and pumping requirements are huge, which makes them expensive to run. Two of the leading centres have been the University of Rennes (France) and the University of Birmingham (UK). A more recent development has been a pulsed version of the CRESU, which requires far less gas and therefore smaller pumps. One might well ask why we should use such a complex method for producing low temperature gases when they could be produced much more easily using liquid helium. The answer is simple: most species have a negligible vapour pressure at such low temperatures and this means that they quickly condense on the sides of the apparatus. Essentially, the CRESU technique provides a [...] "wall-less flow tube," [...] which allows the kinetics of gas phase reactions to be investigated at much lower temperatures than otherwise possible.|$|E
40|$|Flow {{signatures}} {{in experimental}} data from relativistic ion collisions are usually {{interpreted as a}} fingerprint {{of the presence of}} a hydrodynamic phase during the evolution of these systems. In this work, flow signatures arising from event-by-event viscous hydrodynamics are compared to those arising from event-by-event non-interacting particle dynamics (free streaming), both followed by a late-stage hadronic cascade, in d+Au, 3 He+Au at s= 200  GeV and p+Pb collisions at s= 5  TeV, respectively. For comparison, also Pb+Pb collisions at s= 2. 76  TeV are simulated. It is found that non-hydrodynamic evolution can give rise to radial flow equal to or larger than hydrodynamics with η/s= 0. 08 in all simulated collision systems. In light-on-heavy-ion <b>collisions,</b> <b>free</b> streaming gives rise to triangular and quadrupolar flow comparable to or larger than that from hydrodynamics, but it generally leads to considerably smaller elliptic flow. As expected, free streaming leads to considerably less elliptic, triangular and quadrupolar flow than hydrodynamics in nucleus–nucleus collisions, such as event-by-event Pb+Pb collisions at s= 2. 76  TeV...|$|R

In this paper, we describe a method to calculate <b>collision</b> <b>free</b> paths. Many researchers have proposed to calculate <b>collision</b> <b>free</b> paths using analytical methods, potential fields or probabilistic methods.
