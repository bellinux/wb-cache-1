40|$|In {{response}} to a systematic methodology assessment program directed to the aeroelastic stability of hingeless helicopter rotor blades, improved basic aeroelastic reformulations and new formulations relating to structural sweep were achieved. Correlational results are presented showing the substantially improved performance of the G 400 aeroelastic analysis incorporating these new formulations. The formulations pertain partly to sundry solutions to classic problem areas, relating to dynamic inflow with vortex-ring state operation and basic blade kinematics, but mostly to improved physical modeling of elastic axis offset (structural sweep) {{in the presence of}} nonlinear structural twist. Specific issues addressed are an alternate modeling of the delta EI torsional excitation due to <b>compound</b> <b>bending</b> using a force integration approach, and the detailed kinematic representation of an elastically deflected point mass of a beam with both structural sweep and nonlinear twist...|$|E
40|$|The {{transmission}} {{electron microscopy}} (TEM) {{has been used to}} indicate the contribution of stress tensorcomponents to internal stresses in deformed polycrystalline austenitic steel. TEM images of steel deformation demonstrate bend extinction contours the parameters of which allow detecting the stress tensor components (bending and torsional stresses of a crystal lattice). The diagrams are constructed for the contribution of stress tensor components to internal stresses in grains having different types of bending. The regularities are obtained for the stress distribution due to bending-torsion of a crystal latticein the deformed face centered cubic crystal system. The experiment shows that the contribution of bending and torsion stress components to the internal stresses is different during the increase of deformation. The torsion stress component always grows with the increase of deformation, while the bending stress component either grows or lowers. The growth in the torsion stress component is typical for grains with <b>compound</b> <b>bending...</b>|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In this paper, {{the effect}} of a gravel-bed in a <b>compound</b> <b>bend</b> (similar to {{sinusoidal}} top view) of a natural river (Zayandehrud River flowing through Isfahan, Iran) has been investigated for flow resistance analysis, measuring the velocity with a micro current meter. The data were analysed and the following observations were made. In a <b>compound</b> <b>bend,</b> the law of the wall can be valid for up to 66 % of the flow depth from the bed. The parabolic law is the most effective method for the determination of shear velocity. Based on the existing criteria for verifying the equilibrium boundary layer, the flow cannot be in equilibrium. The shear stress distribution and the sediment transport parameters have considerable influence on resistance to flow. Froude number and the flow depth relative to the representative gravel size have little effect on the flow resistance estimation...|$|R

Earth Surface Processes and Landforms, 35 (13), 1601 - 1614. This paper analyses types and rates of change in river meander morphology and the links between mechanisms of change and emergent behaviour of planform morphology. It uses evidence of four dates of aerial photography combined with annual field mapping and ground photography to examine the morphological changes and mechanisms of change {{in a series of}} bends on an active meandering river, the River Dane in NW England, over a 25 year period. This unique data set allows insight into the spatial and temporal variability of bank line movement and component processes. Bank lines were mapped photogrametrically from air photos of 1984, 1996, 2001 and 2007 and the digitised courses compared in ArcGIS to produce calculations of erosional and depositional areas and rates. Most bends exhibit morphological change that largely follows the autogenic sequence, identified in qualitative models of meander development, from low sinuosity curves through simple symmetric and asymmetric <b>bends</b> to <b>compound</b> forms with lobe development in the apex region. Rates of erosion and bankline movement increase through this sequence until the compound phase. Relationships of amounts of movement to various curvature measures of bend morphology are complex. Several new loops, distinct from <b>compound</b> <b>bend</b> behaviour, have developed during the study period in formerly straight sections. Mechanisms of morphological change are illustrated for four types of bends: new, rapid growth bend; sharp-angled bend with mid-channel bar development; symmetric migrating bend; and simple to <b>compound</b> <b>bend</b> development. The changes take place in phases that are not simply related to discharge but to inherent sequences and feedbacks in development of bars and bend morphology and timescales for these are identified. Overall, emergent behaviour of systematic planform change, moderated by channel confinement and boundary features, is produced from spatially and temporally varied channel processes.

40|$|To {{determine}} what topological changes antiparasitic heterocyclic dications {{can have on}} kinetoplast DNA, we have constructed ligation ladders, with phased A 5 and ATATA sequences in the same flanking sequence context, as models. Bending by the A 5 tract is observed, as expected, while the ATATA sequence bends DNA very little. Complexes of these DNAs with three diamidines containing either furan, thiophene or selenophene groups flanked by phenylamidines were investigated along with netropsin. With the bent A 5 ladder the compounds caused either a slight increase or decrease in the bending angle. Surprisingly, however, with ATATA all of the <b>compounds</b> caused significant <b>bending,</b> to values close to or even greater than the A 5 bend angle. Results with a mixed cis sequence, which has one A 5 and one ATATA, show that the <b>compounds</b> <b>bend</b> ATATA {{in the same direction}} as a reference A 5 tract, that is, into the minor groove. These results are interpreted in terms of a groove structure for A 5 which is largely pre-organized for a fit to the heterocyclic amidines. With ATATA the groove is intrinsically wider and must close to bind the compounds tightly. The conformational change at the binding site then leads to significant bending of the alternating DNA sequence...|$|R
40|$|A {{topographic}} steering river meandering (TSRM) model {{based on}} continuity of a simplified flow field through bends is developed. The equilibrium coupling between helical flow and sediment transport, as in Ikeda [1989] determines downstream variation of transverse bed slope. The model tests {{the hypothesis that}} meander development patterns can be captured under the assumptions: (a) bank shear stress arises from forces associated with topographically induced convective accelerations; (b) turbulent boundary layer dissipation of these forces at the banks is sufficiently represented by gaussian smoothing at a parameterized scale; and (c) lateral migration of the channel is proportional to bank shear stress. The resulting TSRM model produces realistic complex meander patterns and scroll bar-like topography. Model <b>compound</b> <b>bend</b> formation is compared to a field case and found to arise from the nonlinear interaction of bank roughness and channel hydraulics scales. When the latter is short relativ [...] ...|$|R
2500|$|A chined hull {{consists}} of straight, smooth, tall, long, or short plates, timbers or sheets of ply, which are set {{at an angle}} to each other when viewed in transverse section. The traditional chined hull is a simple hull shape because it works with only straight planks bent into a curve. These boards are often bent lengthwise. Plywood chined boats made of 8'x4' sheets have most bend along the long axis of the sheet. Only thin ply 3–6mm can easily be shaped into a <b>compound</b> <b>bend.</b> Most home-made constructed boats are chined hull boats. Mass-produced chine powerboats are usually made of sprayed chop strand fibreglass over a wooden mold. The Cajun [...] "pirogue" [...] {{is an example of a}} craft with hard chines. Benefits of this type of hull is the low production cost and the (usually) fairly flat bottom, making the boat faster at planing. Sail boats with chined hull make use of a dagger board or keel.|$|R
40|$|High {{levels of}} RNA {{polymerase}} III gene transcription are achieved by facilitated recycling of the polymerase on transcription factor IIIB (TFIIIB) -DNA complexes that are stable through multiple rounds of initiation. TFIIIB-DNA complexes in yeast comprise the TATA-binding protein (TBP), the TFIIB-related factor TFIIIB 70, and TFIIIB 90. The high {{stability of the}} TFIIIB-DNA complex is conferred by TFIIIB 90 binding to TFIIIB 70 -TBP-DNA complexes. This stability is thought to result from <b>compound</b> <b>bends</b> introduced in the DNA by TBP and TFIIIB 90 and by protein–protein interactions that obstruct DNA dissociation. Here we present biochemical evidence that the high stability of TFIIIB-DNA complexes results from kinetic trapping of the DNA. Thermodynamic analysis shows that the free energies of formation of TFIIIB 70 -TBP-DNA (ΔG° = − 12. 10 ± 0. 12 kcal/mol) and TFIIIB-DNA (ΔG° = − 11. 90 ± 0. 14 kcal/mol) complexes are equivalent whereas a kinetic analysis shows that the half-lives of these complexes (46 ± 3 min and 95 ± 6 min, respectively) differ significantly. The differential stability of these isoenergetic complexes demonstrates that TFIIIB 90 binding energy is used to drive conformational changes and increase the barrier to complex dissociation...|$|R
50|$|In 1961, Rayners Westcoaster {{was briefly}} {{followed}} by the rotund, though equally seaworthy, Corvette - a 5-ton sloop with full standing headroom. The problem he solved with this prototype {{was to find a}} way of bending a marine-ply shell in two dimensions, creating a stronger and more attractive hull, on which the hard chine that had characterised plywood yachts including his Westcoaster, was so softened as to make it almost invisible. Rayners people did this, under his direction, by steaming ply and laminating thinner sheets to achieve a <b>compound</b> <b>bend</b> of the necessary thickness. Refining the twin ballast keels of the Westcoaster, Rayner gave the Corvette - called Danica by her owner the broadcaster Jack Hargreaves - hydrofoil sectioned twin keels, flat on the outside and curved on the inside and very slightly toed in. As well as serving the same function as fin keels, the leeward moulded bilge keel used the Bernoullis principle, to resist leeward drift as the boat heeled on a beat. Hargreaves stepson with a companion, Chris Jameson, as her skipper, proved Danica by taking her through France by river and canal and on through the Mediterranean to Athens, returning via the Bay of Biscay where she successfully weathered F10 gale force winds (September 1962), but her construction costs focused Rayners attention on the emerging technology of glass-reinforced plastic (GRP).|$|R

5000|$|Plywood {{offers the}} builder a better [...] "plank", far wider, thinner, and {{stronger}} than a simple wood plank. Ply is normally produced in 4' × 8' (1.2 m × 2.4 m) sheets or similar. It is normally joined lengthwise by an 1:8 scarf joint using epoxy resin glue. A chined hull built out of plywood will often be designed to keep most of the lengthwise joints between the plywood sheets at the chines, thus making the building process easier. While chine logs (often just called chines) {{can be used for}} plywood boats, another common technique replaces the chine logs with a fiberglass and epoxy fillet joint that provides both connection and stiffness to the joint; this method is most commonly called stitch and glue construction. The result of the stitch and glue operation is a composite [...] "chine log" [...] with a much greater degree of flexibility in curvature and shape than is possible with a wooden chine log. Thinner ply panels, especially 4 mm, can be warped into <b>compound</b> <b>bends</b> to achieve arc bottom boats. This has the benefit of giving a more rounded section, with more displacement and in theory slightly higher speed. Additionally the bent ply is far stiffer than a flat ply panel, so needs less internal support, in the hull, in the form of frames or stringers. This further reduces weight giving a significant boost in performance and by clever design can be used to create a shape closer in appearance to a rounded hull but at far less cost.|$|R
40|$|Gerbera flowers (Gerbera jamesonii) often show stem bending. In four cultivars (Tamara, Liesbeth, Cora, and Mickey), {{we tested}} the effects on <b>bending</b> of {{antimicrobial}} <b>compounds</b> (chlorine bleach, a slow release chlorine compound, 8 -hydroxyquinoline citrate [HQC], silver nitrate, carvacrol and thymol), some combined with sugars. At concentrations used for other cut flowers, inclusion in the vase solution {{of several of the}} antimicrobial <b>compounds</b> delayed <b>bending,</b> had no effect, or hastened bending. Hastening of bending was found at higher concentrations. It was accompanied with visible damage on the stem ends. Results with HQC indicated high toxicity as it did not delay bending at any of the concentration tested (100 - 400 mg L- 1). At 200 mg L- 1 HQC induced growth of bacteria that were not found in the controls. The number of bacteria in the vase water showed a low correlation with bending. Visible toxicity on the stem surface was often associated with a high bacteria count. However, at relatively high concentrations of the antimicrobial <b>compounds</b> stem <b>bending</b> was associated with a low count. This indicated an effect other than bacteria. Water uptake was low in stems that bent early. It is hypothesized that material from dead stem cells resulted in a xylem blockage which led to early bending. Sucrose at 15 g L- 1 in combination with an antimicrobial compound (slow release chlorine, HQC) resulted in the absence of stem damage and produced much less bending than the same concentration of the antimicrobial compounds alone. Sucrose apparently counteracted the toxic effects of the antimicrobial chemicals. (C) 2014 Published by Elsevier B. V...|$|R

5000|$|The Viking shipbuilders had no written {{diagrams}} or standard written design plan. The shipbuilder {{pictured the}} longship before its construction, {{based on previous}} builds, and the ship was then built from the keel up. The keel and stems were made first. The shape of the stem was based on segments of circles of varying sizes. The keel was an inverted T shape to accept the garboard planks. In the longships the keel {{was made up of}} several sections spliced together and fastened with treenails. The next step was building the strakes [...] - [...] the lines of planks joined endwise from stern to stern. Nearly all longships were clinker (also known as lapstrake) built, meaning that each hull plank overlapped the next. Each plank was hewn from an oak tree so that the finished plank was about 25 mm thick and tapered along each edge to a thickness of about 20 mm. The planks were radially hewn so that the grain is approximately at right angles {{to the surface of the}} plank. This provides maximum strength, an even bend and an even rate of expansion and contraction in water. This is called in modern terms quartersawn timber, and has the least natural shrinkage of any cut section of wood. The plank above the turn of the bilge, the meginhufr, was about 37 mm thick on very long ships, but narrower to take the strain of the crossbeams. This was also the area subject to collisions. The planks overlapped by about 25 mm-30 mm and were joined by iron rivets. Each overlap was stuffed with wool or animal hair or sometimes hemp soaked in pine tar to ensure water tightness. At midlength, where the planks are straight, the rivets are about 170 mm apart, but they were closer together as the planks sweep up to the curved bow and stern. There is considerable twist and bend in the end planks. This was achieved by use of both thinner (by 50%) and narrower planks. In more sophisticated builds, forward planks were cut from natural curved trees called reaction wood. Planks were installed unseasoned or wet. Partly worked stems and sterns have been located in bogs. It has been suggested that they were stored there over winter to stop the wood from drying and cracking. The moisture in wet planks allowed the builder to force the planks into a more acute bend, if need be; once dry it would stay in the forced position. At the bow and the stern builders were able to create hollow sections, or <b>compound</b> <b>bends,</b> at the waterline, making the entry point very fine. In less sophisticated ships short and nearly straight planks were used at the bow and stern. Where long timber was not available or the ship was very long, the planks were butt-joined, although overlapping scarf joints fixed with nails were also used.|$|R

Cork powder (50 wt. %) was mixed with polypropylene (PP) or polyethylene (PE) by pultrusion aiming to prepare cork-based composites. In a further step, samples were produced by compression moulding using the <b>compounded</b> composites. <b>Bending</b> strength, impact resistance, hardness, dimensional stability, thermal and acoustic properties of the developed cork-polymer composites (CPC) were determined and compared with commercially available products namely medium density fibreboard (MDF) and high density fibreboard (HDF).

However, the mechanical strength is inferior comparing with both commercial materials based on fibres. It was also observed that addition of cork improved the flexural modulus, impact resistance and hardness on the developed CPC. Thus, the herein described CPC materials showed important characteristics to be considered as good candidates to be applied in the design of flooring and construction systems.

40|$|Inversion and {{depletion}} regions generally form at the interfaces between doped leads (cladding layers) and {{the active}} region of polar heterostructures like AlN/GaN and other nitride <b>compounds.</b> The band <b>bending</b> in the depletion region {{sets up a}} barrier that may seriously impede perpendicular electronic transport. This may ruin the performance of devices such as quantum-cascade lasers and resonant-tunneling diodes. Here we introduce the concepts of polarization balance and polarization-balanced designs: A structure is polarization balanced when the applied bias match the voltage drop arising from spontaneous and piezeolectric fields. Devices designed to operate at this bias have polarization-balanced designs. These concepts offer a systematic approach to avoid the formation of depletion regions. As a test case, we consider the design of AlN/GaN double-barrier structures with Al((x) over tilde) Ga(1 -(x) over tilde) N leads. To guide our efforts, we derive a simple relation between the intrinsic voltage drop arising from polar effects, average alloy composition of the active region, and the alloy concentration of the leads. Polarization-balanced designs secure good filling of the ground state for unbiased structures, while for biased structures with efficient emptying of the active region they remove the depletion barriers...|$|R
