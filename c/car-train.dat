40|$|International audienceLine 1 of BRT, {{the first}} line of BRT system in Iran, and line 4 of Subway, {{designed}} as a sustainable transport system and constructed afterwards, have common path of 10 km length in the most congested area of the capital. This pioneer BRT line has the maximum record among all BRT lines in Tehran. Its success caused lower funds allocation and less attention to the planning and implementation of the line 4 of Subway. As a result currently line 4 of Subway works at 35 % of its capacity with only 13 <b>car-trains</b> and the headway of 7 - 10 min. Construction investment in the subway line 4 was about 11 times more than in the line 1 of BRT. Thus, postponing of investments to the line 4 of Subway causes 65 % of its infrastructure capacity to be unused. However, the elimination for BRT line appears logical, it’s important to avoid negative social impact, as this is a fact that the citizens of Tehran usually have fractal character, so that little changes in their behavior needs long time and enough desirability. Additional funds should also be found for the line 4 of Subway while budgets are saturated and other lines, considering existing demand, are in priority. Therefore, Tehran nowadays is brought to find remedial solutions to transport challenges: to align short-term and long-term sustainable solutions in order to achieve its economic, social and environmental goals...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{reports a}} five-year total {{population}} study of fatal railroad accidents involving individuals (that is, not including train crashes or derailments); and a consecutive unselected series of nonfatal isolated injuries in Queensland, Australia. There were 84 fatalities and 211 cases of significant nonfatal traumata. Fatal railway accidents involving children under 15 {{years of age}} are now more common in Australia than childhood poisonings and electrocutions. Two syndromes occur-(a) toddlers living near the tracks who simply wander onto the line; and (b) young teenage boys who are run down on level crossings, either as pedestrians or cyclists. Adult fatalities include (a) occupational deaths among railway workers (20 %), (b) <b>car-train</b> collisions at level crossings (19 %), (c) drunk pedestrians who walk into trains (17 %), suicides (12 %), and old folk who walk into trains (12 %). Of 211 nonfatal cases studied, falls in and from both moving and stationary trains were {{the most common type}} of accident. Sudden jolting of the train (probably unpreventable) contributed to 26 % of all falls. Twentytwo percent of nonfatal accidents resulted from a person being struck by a train. All persons who survived being struck by a train received serious injuries and required hospital admission. Fatalities involving adults include a high proportion of suicides. Some accidents, such as fingers being caught in windows and doors, can and are being overcome through improved design...|$|E
