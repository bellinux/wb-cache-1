30|$|However, how to {{determinate}} {{an optimal}} trade <b>credit</b> <b>period</b> for the supplier has been received limited attention {{for a long}} time. Although, Kim et al. (1995) first proposed a strategy to determine the optimal trade <b>credit</b> <b>period</b> for supplier and the optimal pricing for the retailer in supplier-Stackelberg game. And then, Abad and Jaggi (2003) extended the model of Kim et al. (1995). The two literatures did not arouse scholars’ attention at that time. The question can be really solved until Teng and Lou (2012) proposed the demand rate is an increasing function of the trade <b>credit</b> <b>period</b> (a decision variable). Although, Jaggi et al. (2008) first assumed that trade <b>credit</b> <b>period</b> has {{a positive impact on}} demand and set up a polynomial function, where trade <b>credit</b> <b>period</b> is still given parameter. Of course, other researcher also proposed inventory model with demand rate is dependent on the trade <b>credit</b> <b>period,</b> such as, Ho (2011), Giri and Maiti (2013), the trade <b>credit</b> <b>period</b> is constant.|$|R
30|$|The {{supplier}} {{provides the}} trade <b>credit</b> <b>period</b> M to the retailer, and the retailer offers its customers trade <b>credit</b> <b>period</b> N.|$|R
30|$|Here, two <b>credit</b> <b>periods</b> {{have been}} {{considered}} in each cycle. One (M) of them is offered by a supplier to the retailer and another one (N) is offered by the retailer to each customer {{in such a way}} that each customer must pay within the <b>period</b> of the <b>credit</b> <b>period</b> (M) offered by the supplier to the retailer. It is also assumed that the customer’s <b>credit</b> <b>period</b> is less than or equal to the retailer’s <b>credit</b> <b>period</b> i.e., N< M.|$|R
30|$|Practically, it is {{seen that}} the longer <b>credit</b> <b>period</b> attracts more customers. So, to {{increase}} the length of <b>credit</b> <b>period</b> increases the customers’ demand. From the literature survey on <b>credit</b> <b>periods,</b> it is studied that almost all research works have considered one manufacturer/supplier to offer the <b>credit</b> <b>period</b> to only one retailer. And there are also very few papers (Dye and Ouyang 2011) in which the retailer offers the <b>credit</b> <b>period</b> to end customer (consumer). In their paper, only one end customer has been considered. But, it is impractical to consider only one customer by which all items are consumed together. It is happened {{that there are many}} end customers by which items are procured from the retailer at different times during the business period and it is also observed that sometimes the retailer announces a <b>credit</b> <b>period</b> during some period to fascinate more end customers. But, till now no one has considered demand as a function of customer’s credit and duration of offering the <b>credit</b> <b>period.</b> In this paper, this phenomena has been incorporated.|$|R
30|$|When {{supplier}} {{provides a}} longer <b>credit</b> <b>period</b> t 1, the retailer replenishes the goods more often. In other words, retailer will minimize the inventory cycle {{time to take}} advantage of longer <b>credit</b> <b>period.</b>|$|R
40|$|Usually it {{is assumed}} that the {{supplier}} would offer a fixed <b>credit</b> <b>period</b> to the retailer but the retailer in turn would not offer any <b>credit</b> <b>period</b> to its customers, which is unrealistic, because in real practice retailer might offer a <b>credit</b> <b>period</b> to its customers in order to stimulate his own demand. Moreover, it is observed that <b>credit</b> <b>period</b> offered by the retailer to its customers has a positive impact on demand of an item but the impact of <b>credit</b> <b>period</b> on demand has received a very little attention by the researchers. To incorporate this phenomenon, we assume that demand is linked to <b>credit</b> <b>period</b> offered by the retailer to the customers. This paper incorporates the concept of credit-linked demand and develops a new inventory model under two levels of trade credit policy to reflect the real-life situations. An easy-to-use algorithm is developed to determine the optimal credit as well as replenishment policy jointly for the retailer. Finally, numerical example is presented to illustrate the theoretical results followed by the sensitivity of various parameters on the optimal solution. ...|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} an inventory model for perishable products with stock-dependent demand under inflation. It {{is assumed that}} the supplier offers a <b>credit</b> <b>period</b> to the retailer, {{and the length of}} <b>credit</b> <b>period</b> is dependent on the order quantity. The retailer does not need to pay the purchasing cost until the end of <b>credit</b> <b>period.</b> If the revenue earned by the end of <b>credit</b> <b>period</b> is enough to pay the purchasing cost or there is budget, the balance is settled and the supplier does not charge any interest. Otherwise, the supplier charges interest for unpaid balance after <b>credit</b> <b>period,</b> and the interest and the remaining payments are made {{at the end of the}} replenishment cycle. The objective is to minimize the retailer’s (net) present value of cost. We show that there is an optimal cycle length to minimize the present value of cost; furthermore, a solution procedure is given to find the optimal solution.

40|$|Management of {{accounts}} receivable and trade credit policy should often {{be adjusted to}} reflect changing interest rates due to changing inflation.

We first assume that inflation is fully anticipated, and later we extend the analysis to incorporate inflation risk. trade <b>credit</b> <b>period,</b> annual percentage benefit...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{considers}} the sustainable trade credit and inventory policies with demand related to <b>credit</b> <b>period</b> {{and the environmental}} sensitivity of consumers under the carbon cap-and-trade and carbon tax regulations. First, the decision models are constructed under three cases: without regulation, carbon cap-and-trade regulation, and carbon tax regulation. The optimal solutions of the retailer in the three cases are then discussed under the exogenous and endogenous <b>credit</b> <b>periods.</b> Finally, numerical analysis is conducted to obtain conclusions. The retailer shortens the trade <b>credit</b> <b>period</b> as the environmental sensitivity of the consumer is enhanced. The cap has no effects on the <b>credit</b> <b>period</b> decisions under the carbon cap-and-trade regulation. Carbon trade price and carbon tax have negative effects on the <b>credit</b> <b>period.</b> The retailer under carbon cap-and-trade regulation is more motivated to obey regulations than that under carbon tax regulation when carbon trade price equals carbon tax. Carbon regulations have better effects on carbon emission reduction than with exogenous credit term when the retailer {{has the power to}} decide with regards credit policies...|$|R
30|$|When the <b>credit</b> <b>period</b> is longer, {{the default}} {{risk to the}} {{retailer}} is higher. For simplicity, {{the rate of the}} default risk given the <b>credit</b> <b>period</b> offered by the retailer is F(N)= 1 -e^-kN, where k> 0. This default risk pattern is used in some studies (Lou and Wang 2012; Zhang et al. 2014).|$|R

30|$|Here, we have {{proposed}} an EOQ model for deteriorating items considering two level credits where all customers {{are allowed to}} take the advantage of <b>credit</b> <b>period</b> from the retailer upto a limited period. The demand function is linked with customer’s <b>credit</b> <b>period</b> and the duration of publicity of such <b>credit</b> <b>period</b> in exponential nature. Here, retailer’s ordering cost per order has been considered as function of replenishment cycle number. Some examples have been provided to illustrate the model. Also, managerial insights have been carried out. The proposed model can be further extended in several ways like different demand structures, quantity discount, deterioration with lifetime, warranty cost and others.|$|R
40|$|An {{attempt is}} made to {{formulate}} optimal ordering policies for the retailer when the supplier offers progressive <b>credit</b> <b>periods</b> to settle the account. We define progressive <b>credit</b> <b>periods</b> as follows: If the retailer settles the outstanding amount by M, the supplier does not charge any interest. If the retailer pays after M but before N(M Ic 1). The objective function to be optimized is considered as present value of all future cash-out-flows. An algorithm is given to find the flow of optimal ordering policy. Analytic proofs are discussed to study the effect of various parameters on an objective function.

30|$|From Table  4, it is {{seen that}} when the <b>credit</b> <b>period</b> (M) offered by the {{supplier}} to the retailer increases, then the optimum profit of the model also increases along with increasing the customer’s <b>credit</b> <b>period</b> (N) though the number of replenishment cycle is almost same. Thus, the retailer may offer more credit to his/her customer to get more profit.|$|R
3000|$|It is {{considered}} that the retailer pay his/her dues {{at the end}} of each cycle. So, if the length of the replenishment cycle is greater than the length of the <b>credit</b> <b>period</b> the retailer has to an interest at a rate I_c [...]. If the length of replenishment cycle is less than the length of the <b>credit</b> <b>period</b> then no interest is charged.|$|R
30|$|Certainly, the <b>credit</b> <b>period</b> {{facility}} {{would promote}} the purchases, and it attracts new customers who consider trade credit policy {{as a type}} of price reduction. To handle the risks of trade credit situations, retailer collects a higher interest from his customers when they did not settle the payment within the <b>credit</b> <b>period</b> time. In this paper, supplier offers the retailer a trade <b>credit</b> <b>period</b> t 1. The retailer offers his customers a <b>credit</b> <b>period</b> t 2, and he receives the revenue from t 2 to T[*]+[*]t 2, where T is the cycle time at the retailer. Under this situation, three cases such as t 1 [*]≤[*]T, T[*]≤[*]t 1 [*]≤[*]T[*]+[*]t 2, and T[*]+[*]t 2 [*]≤[*]t 1 are to be considered. Customers under advance sales booking system may cancel their reservations due to various reasons such as increase in customer's waiting time, loss of customer's goodwill on retailer's business, and attractive promotional schemes offered by other retailers. Here, we consider the partial order cancellations during advance sales period.|$|R
30|$|Determining optimal trade <b>credit</b> <b>period</b> {{from the}} game {{perspective}} is becoming concerned. Only a few corresponding articles {{may be found in}} latest literatures. Zhou et al. (2012) established an uncooperative inventory model for items with stock-dependent demand where the retailer has limited displayed-shelf space, and optimized the trade <b>credit</b> <b>period</b> in a two-echelon supply chain. Zhou and Zhou (2013) investigated two trade credit scenarios, i.e., unconditional and conditional trade credit, and discussed how the supplier sets up trade <b>credit</b> <b>period</b> to minimize his or her cost under supplier-Stackelberg game in a two-echelon supply chain. Based on the models of Zhou and Zhou (2013) and Teng et al. (2014), Wu and Zhao (2015 b) established an uncooperative replenishment model with time-varying demand and time-varying price and learning curve phenomenon under finite planning horizon and supplier-Stackelberg game. However, these cited references do not consider the effect of trade <b>credit</b> <b>period</b> on market demand and default risk.|$|R
30|$|For further research, we may {{extend the}} model to allow for other demand functions, such as {{quadratic}} trade <b>credit</b> <b>period</b> demand, varying demand both with trade <b>credit</b> <b>period</b> and time, etc. In addition, we may further consider deteriorating items, shortages, environmental impact, warehouse capacity constraint and single supplier/multi-retailer non-coordination and others. Therefore, the effects {{of all of these}} additional scenarios may be incorporated in future research.|$|R

30|$|One of most {{important}} extensions is that incorporating trade credit into the EOQ. It assumes that supplier offers retailer/buyer a permissible delay in payments (trade <b>credit</b> <b>period).</b> The account is not settled during trade <b>credit</b> <b>period</b> {{and there is}} no interest charge. In fact, as short-term financing tool, trade credit is widely implemented in fierce competitive circumstance and has important influence on inventory holding cost (Azzi et al. 2014).|$|R
5000|$|The credits are not {{provided}} in {{a lump sum}} but instead are claimed in equal amounts over a 10-year [...] "credit period" [...] (many projects claim credits over 11 years, due to the rules governing how many credits can be claimed {{in the first year}} of the <b>credit</b> <b>period).</b> Thus, the $70,000 of annual credits described in the illustration will yield a total of $700,000 of credits over the <b>credit</b> <b>period.</b>|$|R

30|$|In {{traditional}} business system, it is {{seen that}} customers must pay {{as soon as they}} receive the purchase quantity. But, recently, seller may offer a delay period to pay their dues which is known as <b>credit</b> <b>period.</b> Actually, this <b>credit</b> <b>period</b> is the time frame between when a customer purchases a product and when the customer’s payment is made. The credit policy helps to build up a long term relationship of a company with his customers and it also increases the customers demand. Now-a-days, the trade credit financing in the business becomes a trend due to its various advantages. The effect of <b>credit</b> <b>period</b> in traditional EOQ system first was studied by Goyal (1985). Chung (1998) simplified the search of the optimal solution for the problem explored by Goyal (1985). After that so many researchers also worked on constant or variable demand with <b>credit</b> <b>period</b> such as Banerjee (1986), Ha and Kim (1997), Ouyang et al. (2004), Das et al. (2007). Huang (2003) developed an EOQ model in which a supplier offers a retailer the permissible delay period M and the retailer also provides the trade <b>credit</b> <b>period</b> N (N< M) to his/her customers. Some EOQ model have been developed for items under permissible delay in payment depending on ordering quantity. Shinn and Hwang (2003) extended the work of Shinn (1997) in optimal pricing and ordering policies for retailers under order-size dependent delay in payment. Teng et al. (2011) extended an EOQ model for stock-dependent demand to supplier’s trade credit with a progressive payment scheme. Lou and Wang (2013) developed the classical EOQ model considering credit-linked demand and default risks. Later, Das et al. (2014) discussed a transportation problem in an integrated production-inventory model with a discrete <b>credit</b> <b>period.</b> More recent articles on trade credit financing are developed by Chen and Kang (2010), Chung and Cardenas-Barron (2013), Yang et al. (2014), Chern et al. (2013), Das et al. (2013), Cardenas-Barron et al. (2014), Wu and Chan (2014), Chung et al. (2014), Dye and Yang (2015), Benkherouf and Gilding (2015), Shah and Cardenas-Barron (2015) etc. Recently, Das et al.

The supplier is willing to provide the retailer a full trade <b>credit</b> <b>period</b> for payments and the retailer offers the partial trade <b>credit</b> <b>period</b> to his/her customers. Here, selling items are considered as perishable items such as fruits, fresh fishes, gasoline, photographic films, etc. so that its potential worth decreases. It is assumed that decay in potential worth of items can be increased by using preservation technology. The demand is considered as the function of selling price and trade credit. Ordering cost can be reducing due to learning by doing phenomenon. By applying convex fractional programming results, we obtain necessary and sufficient conditions of an optimal solution. Some theorems are developed to determine retailer’s optimal ordering policies and numerical examples are given to illustrate these theorems. In addition, some managerial insights from the numerical examples are also concluded...|$|R

40|$|In practice, the {{supplier}} often offers the retailers a trade <b>credit</b> <b>period</b> M and the retailer in turn provides a trade <b>credit</b> <b>period</b> N to her/his customer to stimulate sales and reduce inventory.

Hence, how to determine <b>credit</b> <b>period</b> is increasingly recognized as an important strategy to increase retailer's profitability. Also, the selling items such as fruits, fresh fishes, gasoline, photographic films, pharmaceuticals and volatile liquids deteriorate continuously due to evaporation, obsolescence and spoilage. In this paper, we propose an economic order quantity model for the retailer where (1) {{the supplier}} provides an up-stream trade credit and the retailer also offers a down-stream trade credit, (2) the retailer's down-stream trade credit to the buyer not only increases sales and revenue but also opportunity cost and default risk, and (3) the selling items are perishable. Under these conditions, we model the retailer's inventory system as a profit maximization problem to determine the retailer's optimal replenishment decisions under the supply chain management. We then show that the retailer's optimal <b>credit</b> <b>period</b> and cycle time not only exist but also are unique.
