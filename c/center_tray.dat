40|$|The {{objective}} of the low gravity crystal growth experiments {{is to develop a}} novel solute diffusion method for growing single crystals. The experiments will utilize specially designed reactors with three or more compartments separated by valves to keep the reactant solutions and solvent separated until the apparatus reaches low gravity. There will be a mechanism for opening the valves automatically to initiate the diffusion and growth processes. The reactant reservoirs will be large enough {{to take advantage of the}} time provided by the Long Duration Exposure Facility (LDEF) flight. An array of several reactors will be mounted in a 12 -in. -deep end <b>center</b> <b>tray</b> located on the Earth-facing end of the LDEF. Several reactors operating simultaneously will allow experimentation with more than one crystal growth system and/or variations of conditions for each. The reactors will be enclosed in a vacuum tight container and will be surrounded by thermal insulation. The temperature (approximately 35 deg C) will be regulated and any departures from the desired temperature will be recorded. Power requirements will be provided by LiSO 2 batteries...|$|E

50|$|Sales of {{the second}} {{generation}} tC did not reach as high as Scion were expecting and {{to coincide with the}} launch of the Scion FR-S, the tC received a facelift for the 2014 model year. Inspired by the design of the FR-S, the 2014 tC received updated headlamps, grille, LED taillights, 18-inch alloy rims, body kit, a sport-tuned suspension, reworked faster shifting transmission, sport-tuned shocks, and a new touch screen audio system standard. For the first model year, Scion offered a Series 10 anniversary edition of the ten-year anniversary of the brand, limited to 3500 units. It included a new silver color, silver seat belts, a solar-powered illuminated shift knob, an LED Scion locator badge that lights up when the car is unlocked and a sequentially numbered interior badge. For the 2016 model year, the tC received some minor changes, such as a standard rear windshield wiper, new silver interior door handles, <b>center</b> console <b>tray</b> cover, and a leather-wrapped shift knob, the latter of which was formerly an optional upgrade.|$|R
5000|$|Gujeolpan {{refers to}} either an {{elaborate}} Korean dish consisting of nine different foods assorted {{on a wooden}} plate with nine divided sections in an octagon shape or the plate itself. The name is composed of three hanja words: gu (구, [...] "nine" [...] ), jeol (절, [...] "section"), and pan (판, [...] "plate") in Korean. Foods are separated by color and ingredients, and comprise various namul (seasoned leaf vegetables), meats, mushrooms, and seafood items. In the <b>center</b> of the <b>tray</b> is a stack of small jeon (Korean style pancakes) made with wheat flour, which are called miljeonbyeong (밀전병). In addition to its use as a food platter used to serve many dishes of food at once, gujeolpan is also considered a decorative item.|$|R
40|$|The Energetic Oxygen Interaction with Materials 3 (EOIM- 3) {{experiment}} was flown on the STS- 46 mission, which was launched on 31 Jul. 1992 and returned 8 Aug. 1992. Boeing specimens were located {{on both the}} NASA Marshall Space Flight <b>Center</b> (MSFC) <b>tray</b> and the Ballistic Missile Defense Organization (BMDO) tray integrated by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL). The EOIM- 3 pallet was mounted in the Space Shuttle payload bay near the aft bulkhead. During the mission, the atomic oxygen (AO) exposure levels of specimens in these passive sample trays was about 2. 3 x 10 (exp 20) atoms/sq cm. The specimens also received an estimated 22 equivalent sun hours of solar exposure. In addition, {{it appears that the}} EOIM- 3 pallet was exposed to a silicone contamination source and many specimens had a thin layer of silicon based deposit on their surfaces after the flight. The specimens on the MSFC tray included seven solid film lubricants, a selection of butyl rubber (B 612) and silicone (S 383) o-rings, three indirect scatter surfaces, and Silver/Fluorinated Ethylene Propylene (Ag/FEP) and Chemglaze A 276 specimens which had previously flown on trailing edge locations of the Long Duration Exposure Facility (LDEF). The specimens on the JPL tray included composites previously flown on LDEF and two indirect scattering surfaces...|$|R
50|$|The Mk III was a road-car only, {{of which}} 7 were built. The car had four headlamps, the rear {{part of the}} body was {{expanded}} to make room for luggage, the 4.7-litre engine was detuned to , the shock absorbers were softened, the shift lever was moved to the <b>center,</b> an ash <b>tray</b> was added, and the car was available with the steering wheel {{on the left side of}} the car. As the Mk III looked significantly different from the racing models many customers interested in buying a GT40 for road use chose to buy a Mk I that was available from Wyer Ltd. Of the 7 MK III that were produced 4 were left hand drive. One of these examples is currently on display at the Petersen Automotive Museum.|$|R
25|$|Wait staff trays are {{typically}} large circular disks used to serve drinks and/or food {{to people in}} restaurants, bars, and other hospitality industry businesses. The waiter or waitress carries the tray with the open palm of one hand placed underneath, in about the <b>center</b> of the <b>tray,</b> relying on dry friction between the hand and the smooth metal or plastic undersurface of the tray to retain control of the tray. Occasionally, the tray may slide from the waitperson's hand, and the contents crash to the floor. In a May 2012 survey of food industry servers, those responding revealed nearly 25 percent of staff that work or have worked in the hospitality industry have suffered an injury {{as a result of}} a toppled serving tray. Of those people questioned, 23 percent had burned or cut themselves while trying to serve drinks or food from a serving tray.|$|R
40|$|Micro-Media Systems (MMS) has {{developed}} a procedure by which microdilution trays can be filled with dilutions of antimicrobial agents, frozen, and distributed to clinical laboratories. The trays are prepared in various distribution centers throughout the United States to supply clinical laboratories {{in the vicinity of}} each <b>center.</b> For use, <b>trays</b> are removed from the freezer, allowed to thaw, and then inoculated with inocula prepared as for any other susceptibility test, using a convenient disposable inoculator (ca. 5 μl per well). A collaborative study was planned to evaluate microdilution trays prepared in three Micro-Media Systems distribution centers. Microdilution minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were compared to standard tube dilution tests (the international collaborative study group method). With gram-positive cocci, the two techniques gave essentially equivalent results. With gram-negative bacilli, the microdilution MICs were generally one doubling dilution lower than the standard tube dilution MICs. Similar results were seen with microdilution trays prepared with a Cooke Dynatech MIC 2000. Inter- and intralaboratory reproducibility with the macro- and microdilution techniques were quite satisfactory, i. e., at least 96 % of the end points were within a range of ± 1 log 2 dilution intervals...|$|R
40|$|Continuous crop production, where {{plants of}} various ages are growing {{simultaneously}} {{in a single}} recirculating nutrient solution, is a possible alternative to batch production in a Controlled Ecological Life Support System. A study was conducted at John F. Kennedy Space <b>Center</b> where 8 <b>trays</b> (0. 24 sq m per tray) of Triticum aestivum L. Yecora Rojo were grown simultaneously in a growth chamber at 23 C, 65 percent relative humidity, 1000 ppm CO 2, continuous light, with a continuous flow, thin film nutrient delivery system. The same modified Hoagland nutrient solution was recirculated through the plant trays from an 80 L reservoir throughout the study. It was maintained by periodic addition of water and nutrients based on chemical analyses of the solution. The study was conducted for 216 days, during which 24 trays of wheat were consecutively planted (one every 9 days), 16 of which were grown to maturity and harvested. The remaining 8 trays were harvested on day 216. Grain yields averaged 520 g m(exp - 2), and had an average edible biomass of 32 percent. Consecutive yields were unaffected by nutrient solution age. It was concluded that continual wheat production will work in this system {{over an extended period}} of time. Certain micronutrient deficiencies and toxicities posed problems and must be addressed in future continuous production systems...|$|R
50|$|The {{national}} dish in Jordan {{is called}} mansaf, a dish that {{is associated with}} Bedouin traditions. Despite these rural roots, it is shared by Jordanians of many diverse backgrounds, not just Bedouins or those who can trace their ancestral lines back to Bedouins. The dish is composed of a bread called Sherack, lamb meat, yogurt(Jameed) recently, rice and nuts {{have been added to the}} dish also some regions in Jordan add seasoning, and served on a large, circular platter. The ingredients are combined to form several layers. The first layer is made of thin, unleavened bread, shredded and soaked in yogurt broth. Next is a layer of rice which covers the bread. Large chunks of lamb that have been simmered in the same type of yogurt broth are placed on top of the rice. The head of the lamb is placed in the <b>center</b> of the <b>tray.</b> Pine nuts, almonds, and parsley are sprinkled atop the meat and rice. The final step involves pouring a yogurt broth over the entire dish, which is then added periodically throughout the meal to keep the dish warm and moist. Traditionally, mansaf is eaten while sitting on the floor, using ones hands to eat from a large, circular communal tray. This tradition still persists, although in modern years, many people have taken to eating the dish with silverware. Most admit, however, that mansaf tastes better when eaten with the hand. The dish takes hours to prepare and thus is primarily served only on special occasions.|$|R
30|$|Flammability of {{the leaves}} was {{determined}} by methods modified from Taylor and Fonda (1990). Forty samples per species per month were burned in the laboratory {{for a total of}} 880 burns. Our fuel bed for each burn was composed of a sample of leaves weighed out to 10.00 g to 10.09 g and arranged so they would fit within a 25 cm × 25 cm area on a 35 cm × 35 cm flat metal tray, and all fuel beds were < 4 cm deep. Fuel beds did vary over the sample time; earlier in the sample period fuel beds were thicker and less compact due to leaf size (3 cm to 4 cm deep). As time from leaf fall increased, leaves were often broken and more decomposed, which made the fuel beds more compact and thinner (2 cm to 3 cm deep). Each prepared sample was placed under a 62 cm × 98 cm laboratory fume hood with the vent running. Four 25 cm long pieces of 1.4 kg cotton string were soaked in xylene and placed overlapping each other on top of the sample, and within 2 cm of the sample edge, to achieve ignition. The string was ignited at a single point and the fume hood door closed. Initially the twine was placed under the samples, as described by Taylor and Fonda (1990), but consistent and even ignition of the samples could not be obtained using this method. A type K thermocouple of 24 AWG insulated wire was positioned 10 cm above the <b>center</b> of the <b>tray</b> then attached to a ExTech™ EasyView 15 thermometer datalogger (FLIR Commercial Systems, Nashua, New Hampshire, USA) to record maximum and average burn temperatures (average of temperature from ignition to extinction of last glowing ember). In the darkened laboratory, flame time (time from ignition to extinction of last flame) and total burn time (time from ignition to extinction of last glowing ember) was recorded with a stopwatch. From these two readings we determined ember time (time from the extinction of last flame to the extinction of last glowing ember). After the sample had completed combustion, the percent consumption of the sample was determined by weighing the remaining residue. Individual leaf weights were determined just prior to burning by randomly selecting and weighing 50 individual leaves by species from each sample for each collection period (n = 1110).|$|R
