40|$|This paper explores <b>proximity</b> <b>to</b> {{mother for}} 1984 - 1996 among adult {{children}} (age 23 - 35 in 1984). Using Panel Study of Income Dynamics, preliminary {{findings in this}} paper suggest that lower economic status is associated with <b>closer</b> <b>proximity</b> between adult children and their mothers. Non-white, lower education, fewer siblings, and mother’s residence in non-rural area are significantly associated with <b>closer</b> <b>proximity</b> <b>to</b> mother. And, controlling after time-invariant factors, adult children’s higher education, marriage and working are significantly associated with further spatial location from mother while mother’s health problem relates <b>closer</b> <b>proximity.</b> <b>To</b> understand the full mechanism of how adult children’s <b>proximity</b> <b>to</b> parents is determined and how such proximity facilitates informal transfers, it might be necessary to incorporate further information on individual geographic mobility. ...|$|R

5|$|Based on {{the number}} of individuals, Waptia fieldensis {{constitutes}} about 2.55% {{of the total number of}} organisms recovered from the Burgess Shale, and 0.86% of the Greater Phyllopod bed.

The National Museum of Natural History alone houses more than a thousand specimens of the species from the Burgess Shale. Waptia fieldensis are often found disarticulated, with parts remaining in <b>close</b> <b>proximity</b> <b>to</b> each other.|$|E

5|$|Because of its <b>close</b> <b>proximity</b> <b>to</b> {{the higher}} Helvellyn, Nethermost Pike {{receives}} fewer visitors. When climbing {{from the west}} many people traverse the western slopes {{on their way to}} Helvellyn. Despite this the summit does still receive a large number of walkers, who use a large number of footpaths. The large number of footpaths causes significant disturbance to the summit vegetation, which could be greatly reduced by using fewer footpaths.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{not making}} landfall, Helene's <b>close</b> <b>proximity</b> <b>to</b> the United States {{resulted}} in impacts along the East Coast. Impacts were most severe in North Carolina, where the hurricane made its closest approach.

In the United States, Helene caused $11.2million in damages and one indirect fatality.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{seemingly}} <b>close</b> <b>proximity</b> <b>to</b> its neighbouring communities, a motorized pirogue trip to Carabane from Elinkine, the nearest village, takes about thirty minutes; the trip once took {{an hour and}} a half by canoe.

Travelling from Cap Skirring via Cachouane is also possible, but as a detailed map of the region would make clear, the channels of salt water are not easily navigated.|$|E

He has said the site would be perfect for the factory because of its <b>close</b> <b>proximity</b> <b>to</b> NaREC and the site's existing deep dock facilities.
