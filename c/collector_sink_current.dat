50|$|To {{understand}} how the inverter operates, {{it is necessary to}} understand the current flow. If the bias current is shunted to ground (low logic level), the transistor turns off and the collector floats (high logic level). If the bias current is not shunted to ground because the input is high-z (high logic level), the bias current flows through the transistor to the emitter, switching on the transistor, and allowing the <b>collector</b> to <b>sink</b> <b>current</b> (low logic level). Because the output of the inverter can <b>sink</b> <b>current</b> but cannot source current, it is safe to connect the outputs of multiple inverters together to form a wired AND gate. When the outputs of two inverters are wired together, the result is a two-input NOR gate because the configuration (NOT A) AND (NOT B) is equivalent to NOT (A OR B) (per De Morgan's Theorem).|$|R

5000|$|More complex {{analysis}} than fan-in and fan-out {{is required}} when two different logic families are interconnected. Fan-out is ultimately {{determined by the}} maximum source and <b>sink</b> <b>currents</b> of an output and the maximum source and <b>sink</b> <b>currents</b> of the connected inputs; the driving device {{must be able to}} supply or sink at its output the sum of the currents needed or provided (depending on whether the output is a logic high or low voltage level) by all of the connected inputs, while maintaining the output voltage specifications. For each logic family, typically a [...] "standard" [...] input is defined by the manufacturer with maximum input currents at each logic level, and the fan-out for an output is computed as the number of these standard inputs that can be driven in the worst case. (Therefore, it is possible that an output can actually drive more inputs than specified by fan-out, even of devices within the same family, if the particular devices being driven sink and/or source less current, as reported on their data sheets, than a [...] "standard" [...] device of that family.) Ultimately, whether a device has the fan-out capability to drive (with guaranteed reliability) a set of inputs is determined by adding up all the input-low (max.) source currents specified on the datasheets of the driven devices, adding up all the input-high (max.) <b>sink</b> <b>currents</b> of those same devices, and comparing those sums to the driving device's guaranteed maximum output-low <b>sink</b> <b>current</b> and output-high source current specifications, respectively. If both totals are within the driving device's limits, then it has the DC fan-out capacity to drive those inputs on those devices as a group, and otherwise it doesn't, regardless of the manufacturer's given fan-out number. However, for any reputable manufacturer, if this current analysis reveals that the device cannot drive the inputs, the fan-out number will agree.|$|R

The proposed algorithm also permits a fault tolerant and self-healing deployment, and allows the realization of an integrated solution for deployment, dynamic relocation and selective sensor activation.
