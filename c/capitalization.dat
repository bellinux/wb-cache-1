The IFC African, Latin American, and Caribbean Fund (referred to as the IFC ALAC Fund) was created in 2010 and is worth $1 billion. , the ALAC Fund has invested a total of $349.1 million into twelve businesses. The Africa <b>Capitalization</b> Fund was set up in 2011 to invest in commercial banks in both Northern and Sub-Saharan Africa and its commitments totaled $181.8 million in March 2012. , Gavin E.R.

40|$|Published online: 28 August 2010 This study {{finds that}} returns to stocks with {{relatively}} high market <b>capitalizations</b> lead returns to stocks with relatively low market <b>capitalizations</b> in Australian industry portfolios.

However while that study found stronger lead–lag effects for industries with relatively small average market <b>capitalizations</b> this study finds that industries with larger average market <b>capitalizations</b> have stronger lead–lag effects. This may be caused by industry momentum created by positive news to the leader stocks of an industry, and implies investors can gain significantly by investing in the smaller firms of prominent industries, following an earlier shock to the corresponding leader stocks.

40|$|We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} robustly maximizing {{the growth rate of}} investor wealth in the presence of model uncertainty. Possible models are all those under which the assets' region $E$ and instantaneous covariation $c$ are known, and where additionally the assets are stable in that their occupancy time measures converge to a law with density $p$. This latter assumption is motivated by the observed stability of ranked relative market <b>capitalizations</b> for equity markets. We seek to identify the robust optimal growth rate, as well as a trading strategy which achieves this rate in all models. Under minimal assumptions upon $(E,c,p) $, we identify the robust growth rate with the Donsker-Varadhan rate function from occupancy time Large Deviations theory. We also prove existence of, and explicitly identify, the optimal trading strategy. We then apply our results in the case of drift uncertainty for ranked relative market <b>capitalizations.</b> Assuming regularity under symmetrization for the covariance and limiting density of the ranked <b>capitalizations,</b> we explicitly identify the robust optimal trading strategy in this setting.

The magnitude of lead-lag effects is larger in Australia reflecting the greater importance of large stocks as indicator stocks for the industries they lead. These results amplify the significance of industries in asset-pricing and behavioural finance models and also suggest that a within-industry switch from the large stocks of an industry to the smaller stocks, may be profitable.

40|$|International audienceThe {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to propose a tractable solution to integrate partially market liquidity risk in portfolio choice. The fundamental idea of this paper is that investor behavior must integrate liquidity environment. Actually, even if illiquidity frightens investors, in peculiar cases, liquidity can give a really interesting premium and this duality of market liquidity risk is difficult to integrate in portfolio choice, even in mean-variance framework. I reveal that bid prices, instead of closing prices, can capture it partially. This paper suggests therefore one first step to find a simple and very tractable solution which tries to completeMarkowitz paradigm with liquidity risk management. Empirical results show that the bid efficient frontier aims to propose efficient allocations with more liquid stocks (large <b>capitalizations)</b> under stressed conditions and more illiquid stocks (small <b>capitalizations)</b> under normal conditions to take advantage of the liquidity risk premium...|$|R

40|$|We {{introduce}} polynomial {{processes in}} the sense of [8] in the context of stochastic portfolio theory to model simultaneously companies' market <b>capitalizations</b> and the corresponding market weights. These models substantially extend volatility stabilized market models considered by Robert Fernholz and Ioannis Karatzas in [18], in particular they allow for correlation between the individual stocks. At the same time they remain remarkably tractable which makes them applicable in practice, especially for estimation and calibration to high dimensional equity index data. In the diffusion case we characterize the joint polynomial property of the market <b>capitalizations</b> and the corresponding weights, exploiting the fact that the transformation between absolute and relative quantities perfectly fits the structural properties of polynomial processes. Explicit parameter conditions assuring the existence of a local martingale deflator and relative arbitrages with respect to the market portfolio are given and the connection to non-attainment of the boundary of the unit simplex is discussed. We also consider extensions to models with jumps and the computation of optimal relative arbitrage strategies...|$|R
