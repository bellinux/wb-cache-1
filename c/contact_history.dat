40|$|We {{provide a}} brief {{overview}} of the Discrete Element Method (DEM) for modeling large frictional contact problems in granular flow dynamics and quasi-static geome-chanics applications. In terms of contact, DEM can be divided into two approaches: the Constraint Method (CM) or rigid-body approach, and the Penalty Method (PM) or soft-body approach. We give a detailed presentation of a DEM-PM contact model that includes multi-time-step tangential <b>contact</b> displacement <b>history.</b> We compare results from direct shear simulations performed with Chrono using this contact model to re-sults from identical simulations using contact models that include either no tangential <b>contact</b> displacement <b>history</b> or only single-time-step tangential <b>contact</b> displacement <b>history.</b> We show that neither of the latter two models are able to accurately model the direct shear test. In particular, the ratio of shear stress to normal stress during direct shear simulations is under-predicted by a factor of about ten when the true tan-gential <b>contact</b> displacement <b>history</b> model is not used. The new multi-step tangential <b>contact</b> displacement <b>history</b> model we have implemented in Chrono was validated us...|$|R

Europeans did not return until 1768, when Louis Antoine de Bougainville rediscovered the islands.|$|E

40|$|Tuberculosis {{remains one}} of {{diseases}} with highest mortality among other. Indonesia had categorized in one of high burden countries since 2013. WHO estimated the annual global burden of childhood tuberculosis in 2012 was approximately 530. 000 cases and that up to 74. 000 children died that year. The last three years tuberculosis incidence in Jember increased. In 2014, 6, 5 % of total tuberculosis incidence was childhood tuberculosis. Childhood tuberculosis is a major component in controlling tuberculosis. The objective {{of this study is}} to analyze determining factors of childhood tuberculosis incidence in Jember. This study is an analytical observational study using case-control design. The object of this study is children aged 0 – 14 years who diagnosed with tuberculosis in Jember Paru Hospital. Sampling taken by simple random sampling method. Sampel consisting 24 cases and 48 control. The independent variables is child nutritional status, <b>contact</b> <b>history,</b> long-term contact, and proximity contact. Analysis using Logistic Regression test to determine the influence between two variables. The results show that childhood tuberculosis incidence determined by <b>contact</b> <b>history</b> (p = 0, 000; OR = 26, 6), long-term contact (p = 0, 000; OR = 69), and proximity contact (p = 0, 000; OR = 27, 1). The conclusion is, <b>contact</b> <b>history,</b> long-term contact, proximity contact determine childhood tuberculosis in Jember. Stakeholder have to do active case finding to break the chain of tuberculosis transmission with early household contact detection.

40|$|Despite recent, {{noteworthy}} {{scholarship on}} indigenous architecture in Australia, {{the record of}} pre-colonial settlement patterns, dwellings and building practices is still slight. This paper adds to the limited historiographies that refer directly to Aboriginal building practices. It focuses on the built environments of the Girramay people in the Wet Tropics Region of northeastern Queensland. Girramay building traditions persisted into the twentieth century, partly because of late and discontinuous <b>contact</b> <b>histories.</b> Close examination of the archival data was augmented by oral histories and the reconstruction of twelve traditional dwellings between 2002 and 2004. Drawing on these various methods and techniques, this paper attempts to refine the interpretation of this particular building tradition and counter the generalisations made in previous literature. It also demonstrates the limits of historiography based on archives that originate {{from members of the}} settler society...|$|R
40|$|While the {{existence}} of uncritical exhibition practices that support nostalgic narratives about the past cannot be denied, this paper is focused on demonstrating both {{the existence}} of critical exhibitions and on explaining how they work.

My examples, drawn from curatorial practices in Australia dealing either with <b>contact</b> <b>histories</b> or histories of migration, will be used to explore how explicit forms of engagement with the senses in contemporary exhibition practices gesture toward not only a new understanding of the pedagogical role of museums but also to new forms of pedagogical practice...|$|R

40|$|Conventional routing {{algorithms}} rely on {{the existence}} of persistent end-to-end paths for the delivery of a message to its destination via a predesigned path. However, in a delay tolerant network (DTN), nodes are intermittently connected, and thus the network topology is dynamic in nature, which makes the routing {{become one of the most}} challenging problems. A promising solution is to predict the nodes’ future contacts based on their <b>contact</b> <b>histories.</b> In this paper, we first propose an expected encounter based routing protocol (EER) which distributes multiple replicas of a message proportionally between two encounters according to their expected encounter values. In case of single replica of a message, EER makes the routing decision by comparing the minimum expected meeting delay to the destination. We further propose a community based routing protocol (CR) which takes advantages of the high contact frequency property of the community. The simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed routing protocols under different network parameters. Department of ComputingRefereed conference pape...|$|R
