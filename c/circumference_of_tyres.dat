The definitive version is available at: [URL] a vehicle moves at high speed and if the speed exceeds a certain 'critical velocity', then quite intensive flexural waves travelling around the <b>circumference</b> <b>of</b> the <b>tyre</b> emerge from the trailing edge of the contact patch. To the observer these waves in the tyre appear to be stationary. Therefore, in the literature they are often referred to as 'standing waves in tyres'. Although this phenomenon has been studied since the 1950 s and a number of successful predictions of experimentally observed features had been made, it is still not well understood. In the present paper, a new physically explicit theory <b>of</b> <b>tyre</b> standing waves has been developed. The theory is based on a tensioned beam model <b>of</b> a <b>tyre.</b> Simple analytical expressions have been derived for the amplitudes and shapes of generated waves and for the most important parameter characterising the phenomenon <b>of</b> <b>tyre</b> standing waves-the vehicle critical speed beyond which the standing waves occur. The performance of the theory is examined by varying the tyre parameters and by comparing the results, where possible, to other similar work. The obtained predictions show that the developed theory explains and predicts the phenomenon <b>of</b> <b>tyre</b> standing waves surprisingly well, given its simplicity and the uncertainty in the tyre parameters used in calculations. It also has the potential for further development...|$|R
50|$|Since {{the deaths}} of Senna and Ratzenberger, the FIA has used safety {{as a reason to}} impose rule changes that otherwise, under the Concorde Agreement, would have had to be agreed upon by all the teams — most notably the changes {{introduced}} for 1998. This so-called 'narrow track' era resulted in cars with smaller rear tyres, a narrower track overall, and the introduction <b>of</b> grooved <b>tyres</b> to reduce mechanical grip. There were to be four grooves on the front (three in the first year) and rear that ran through the entire <b>circumference</b> <b>of</b> the <b>tyre.</b> The objective was to reduce cornering speeds and to produce racing similar to rainy conditions by enforcing a smaller contact patch between tyre and track. This, according to the FIA, was to promote driver skill and provide a better spectacle.Results have been mixed as the lack of mechanical grip has resulted in the more ingenious designers clawing back the deficit with aerodynamic grip — pushing more force onto the tyres through wings and aerodynamic devices, which in turn has resulted in less overtaking as these devices tend to make the wake behind the car 'dirty' (turbulent), preventing other cars from following closely due to their dependence on 'clean' air to make the car stick to the track. The grooved tyres also had the unfortunate side effect of initially being of a harder compound to be able to hold the grooved tread blocks, which resulted in spectacular accidents in times of aerodynamic grip failure as the harder compound could not grip the track as well.|$|R
50|$|Dead {{reckoning}} (DR) uses {{a mechanical}} system {{linked to the}} vehicle’s driving assembly in order to predict the path taken by the vehicle. By measuring {{the rotation of the}} road wheels over time, a fairly precise estimation of the vehicle’s speed and distance traveled can be made. Dead reckoning requires the vehicle to begin at a known, fixed point. Then, by combining speed and distance data with factors such as the angle of the steering wheel and feedback from specialized sensors (e.g., accelerometers, flux gate compass, gyroscope) it can plot the path taken by the vehicle. By overlaying this path onto a digital map, the DR system knows approximately where the vehicle is, what the local speed limit is, and the speed at which the vehicle is traveling. The system can then use information provided by the digital map to warn of upcoming hazards or points of interest and to provide warnings if the speed limit is exceeded. Some top-end GPS-based navigation systems currently on the market use dead reckoning as a backup system in case the GPS signal is lost. Dead reckoning is prone to cumulative measurement errors such as variations between the assumed <b>circumference</b> <b>of</b> the <b>tyres</b> compared to the actual dimension (which is used to calculate vehicle speed and distance traveled). These variations in the tyre circumference can be due to wear or variations in tyre pressure due to variations in speed, payload, or ambient temperature. Other measurement errors are accumulated when the vehicle navigates gradual curves that inertial sensors (e.g., gyroscopes and/or accelerometers) are not sensitive enough to detect or due to electromagnetic influences on magnetic flux compasses (e.g., from passing under power lines or when travelling across a steel bridge) and through underpasses and road tunnels.|$|R

The effect <b>of</b> <b>tyre</b> shred-tosand mixing ratio on the mechanical response of the mixtures is studied by performing direct shear tests on mixtures prepared at different mixing ratios.
