Using a robust definition of `local channel radius', {{based on the}} concept of a medial surface [Schröder et al., Eur.  Phys.  J.  B 35, 551 (2003) ], we relate radius variations of the space-partition to polymolecular chain stretching in bicontinuous diblock- and terblock copolymer assemblies. We associate local surface patches with corresponding cellular volume elements, to define local volume-to-surface ratios. The distribution of these v/a ratios and of the <b>channel</b> <b>radii</b> are used to quantify the degree of packing frustration of molecular chains {{as a function of the}} specific bicontinuous geometry, modelled by triply-periodic minimal surfaces and related parallel interfaces. The Gyroid geometry emerges as the most nearly homogeneous bicontinuous form, with the smallest heterogeneity of <b>channel</b> <b>radii,</b> compared to the cubic Primitive and Diamond surfaces. We clarify a geometric feature of the Gyroid geometry: the three-coordinated nodes of the graph are not the widest points of the labyrinths; the widest points are at the midpoints of the edges. We also explore a more complex cubic triply-periodic surface, the I-WP surface, containing two geometrically distinct channel subdomains. One of the two channel systems is nearly as homogeneous in local channel diameters as the Gyroid, the other is more heterogeneous than the Primitive surface. Its hybrid nature suggests the possibility of an “alternating I-WP” phase in polydisperse linear ABC-terpolymer blends, with monodisperse molecular weight distributions (MWD) in the A and B blocks and a more polydisperse C block.

40|$|An {{efficient}} {{version of}} the calculable R-matrix method, a technique for determination of scattering and bound-state properties, is extended to the Dirac equation. The configuration space is divided into internal and external regions at the <b>channel</b> <b>radius.</b> In both regions, {{the introduction of a}} Bloch operator allows restoration of the Hermiticity. The most general Bloch operator contains three free parameters. With a basis without constraint at the <b>channel</b> <b>radius</b> in the internal region, the phase shifts converge to the same value for any choice of these parameters. Nevertheless, some choices provide a faster convergence than others. Determination of the bound-state energies is performed with an extension of the method using a second set of basis functions in the external region. Neither the knowledge of asymptotic expressions nor a large <b>channel</b> <b>radius</b> is required. These R-matrix methods are particularly simple and very accurate when combined with the Lagrange-mesh method. No analytical or numerical evaluation of matrix elements is then necessary. Very accurate phase shifts are obtained with a Legendre mesh for various short-range potentials.

Different situations are investigated, with the pressure loss coefficient being either a constant for the whole structure, or depending on local flow conditions. The case where both Poiseuille and singular pressure losses are present is also addressed. Also two types of networks are taken as illustrations: a dichotomic tree (a branch divides into two sub-branches), and a tetratomic tree (a branch divides into four sub-branches).

40|$|Plasma wakefield {{acceleration}} (PWFA) {{has demonstrated}} {{the ability to}} produce very high gradients to accelerate electrons and positrons. In PWFA, a drive bunch of charged particles passes through a uniform plasma, thereby generating a wakefield that accelerates a witness bunch traveling behind the drive bunch. This process works well for electrons, but much less so for positrons due to the positive charge attracting rather than repealing the plasma electrons, which leads to reduced acceleration gradient, halo formation, and emittance growth. This problem can be alleviated by having the positron beam travel through a hollow plasma channel. Presented are modeling results for producing 10 – 100  cm long hollow plasma channels suitable for positron PWFA. These channels are created utilizing laser-induced gas breakdown in hydrogen gas.

40|$|Abstract. Molecular {{diffusion}} under confinement by highly ordered nanoporous structures is {{subjected to}} a hierarchy of particle-particle correlations. These correlations result {{in a variety of}} peculiarities of molecular diffusion. Three examples are discussed in detail. As a consequence of the confinement by the host matrix, molecular displacements in different directions often intimately depend on each other, resulting in an interdependence of the principal elements of the dihsion tensor (correlation rule of difision anisotropy). If intrac~ystalline channel systems confine molecular propagation to one direction, molecules with diameters Mciently exceeding the <b>channel</b> <b>radii</b> are subjected to single-jle d~flusion, whose spatial-temporal dependence significantly deviates from normal diffusion. In networks of intersecting single-file systems with different affinities to the reactant and product molecules, the interplay of diffusion and reaction leads to deviations from a homogeneous pore filling over the sample and to an enhanced output of reaction products in comparison with channel networks of equal adsorption affinities (reactivity enhancement by molecular trafic control). The presented theoretical concepts are compared with experimental results, in particular with the findings of pulsed field gradient (PFG) NMR diffusion studies. 1...|$|R

To mimic the process of ion transport through protein channels, the cylindrical channel is embedded in a dielectric slab (representing a lipid bilayer membrane). The protein/membrane structure is taken to be rigid, and the water solvent is treated as a dielectric continuum. Results of these simulations are compared to corresponding results obtained via Poisson-Nernst-Planck (PNP) theory. In the PNP approach, the mobile ions are treated as a continuous charge density, and the electrostatic force on each ion is treated in an approximate fashion. Significant differences between DLMC and PNP results are found, with the degree of discrepancy increasing as the radius of the ion channel is reduced. A major source of error is traced to the neglect in the effective PNP potential of the dielectric self-energy (DSE), which is due to the interaction of each permeant ion with the dielectrically inhomogeneous environment provided by the water/channel/membrane system. When this static single-particle potential is precalculated and added to the effective potential used in PNP theory, substantial improvement in the quality of the results for current-voltage curves and steady-state concentrations is obtained.
