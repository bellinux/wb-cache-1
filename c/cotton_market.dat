5|$|The high European {{demand for}} the product enabled Zahir to grow wealthy and finance his {{autonomous}} sheikhdom. This control of the <b>cotton</b> <b>market</b> also allowed him to gain unofficial control over all of the Sidon Eyalet, outside the city of Sidon itself. With mixed success, Zahir attempted to have French merchant ships redirected from the ports of Tyre and Sidon to Haifa instead, in order {{to benefit from the}} customs fees he could exact. The city of Acre underwent an economic boom {{as a result of its}} position in the cotton trade with France, and became the fortified headquarters of Zahir's sheikhdom.|$|E
5|$|Zahir's rule radically {{changed the}} {{landscape}} of Galilee. With the restoration and re-fortification of Acre {{and the establishment of}} the secondary port city of Haifa, Galilee significantly strengthened its ties with the Mediterranean world. Following Zahir's death, his successor Jazzar Pasha maintained the cotton monopoly Zahir had established and Galilee's economy remained almost completely dependent on the cotton trade. The region prospered for decades, but with the rise of the <b>cotton</b> <b>market</b> in the southern United States during the early-mid 19th century, European demand shifted away from Palestine's cotton and because of its dependency on the crop, the region experienced a sharp economic downturn from which it could not recover. The cotton crop was largely abandoned, as were many villages, and the peasantry shifted its focus to subsistence agriculture.|$|E
25|$|World War II was {{a turning}} point for the Lancashire cotton {{industry}} and the Liverpool <b>Cotton</b> <b>Market.</b> The demand for cotton in India and China was now being met by the cotton mills of Japan and India. Lancashire could not compete with their cheaper labour and products. Its Far East market collapsed and cotton imports to Liverpool halved. Further problems came with the decimation of the American crop of 1921 by the ravages of the boll weevil. The Wall Street Crash of 1929 brought with it the Great Depression and the effect on the Liverpool <b>cotton</b> <b>market</b> was severe: in 1931 Liverpool’s cotton imports were at their lowest for 62 years.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} impacts of <b>cotton</b> <b>marketing</b> reforms on farm productivity, a key element for poverty alleviation, in rural Zambia. The reforms {{comprised}} {{the elimination of the}} Zambian <b>cotton</b> <b>marketing</b> board that was in place since 1977. Following liberalization, the sector adopted an outgrower scheme, whereby firms provided extension services to farmers and sold inputs on loans that were repaid at the time of harvest. There are two distinctive phases of the reforms: a failure of the outgrower scheme, and a subsequent period of success of the scheme. Our findings indicate that the reforms led to interesting dynamics in cotton farming. During the phase of failure, farmers were pushed back into subsistence and productivity in cotton declined. With the improvement of the outgrower scheme of later years, farmers devoted larger shares of land to cash crops, and farm productivity significantly increased. <b>cotton</b> <b>marketing</b> reforms, farm productivity...|$|R

25|$|In {{the early}} 1870s, new {{industries}} {{began to grow}} in St. Louis, such as cotton compressing, {{a process in which}} raw cotton is compressed for easier shipment. By 1880, St. Louis was the third largest raw <b>cotton</b> <b>market</b> in the United States, with an overwhelming majority of it transported to the city by railroad. Among these new railroad connections was the Cotton Belt Railroad, organized in St. Louis in 1879 from smaller lines that connected the region to cotton producers in Texas.|$|E
25|$|The city of Memphis {{was founded}} on May 22, 1819 (incorporated December 19, 1826) by John Overton, James Winchester and Andrew Jackson. They named it after the ancient capital of Egypt on the Nile River. Memphis {{developed}} as a trade and transportation center in the 19th century because of its flood-free location high above the Mississippi River. Located in the low-lying delta region along the river, its outlying areas were developed as cotton plantations, and the city became a major <b>cotton</b> <b>market</b> and brokerage center.|$|E
25|$|Major {{improvement}} {{to transport}} and communication systems brought crucial developments. The railways reduced {{the time and}} cost of travel and improved reliability in transporting cotton to the Lancashire towns. The Liverpool Cotton Brokers’ Association was established in 1841 and it quickly established a successful system of arbitration. The Transatlantic Telegraph Cable reduced long distance communication from weeks to minutes. Liverpool broker John Rew recognised the far-reaching implications of this development and created the hedge fund system. This led to the hugely successful Liverpool Cotton Futures Market, which doubled {{the business of the}} Liverpool <b>Cotton</b> <b>Market.</b> In 1911-12 Liverpool imported 5,230,399 bales of cotton.|$|E

25|$|The Second World War {{sealed the}} Liverpool Cotton Market’s fate. U-boat attacks and {{the bombing of}} ports and cities {{threatened}} cotton supplies and resulted in drastic action.

In 1963 the Liverpool Cotton Association successfully reinvented itself and re-energised its membership, concentrating on the provision of specialist services such as arbitration. The association became increasingly global in its outlook and this was reflected in its name change in 2004 to the International Cotton Association.|$|E

This paper provides empirical estimates {{of the degree of}} economic inefficiency associated with government intervention in Turkish <b>cotton</b> <b>markets.</b> A two-region partial equilibrium model of cotton exports and imports is developed under the "small country assumption" to obtain empirical estimates of the deadweight welfare loss associated with these government subsidies. Although government intervention results in significant income distribution among the various cotton sectors within Turkey, the overall economic inefficiency of the redistribution is very low. export tax, tariff, agricultural policy, Turkey, cotton, agricultural cooperatives, welfare, state trading enterprises, International Relations/Trade,...|$|R
40|$|Cotton {{has been}} a success story in West Africa since {{independence}} swept {{the region in the}} early 1960 's. Today, however, 'white gold' is struggling to maintain its allure. Recent declines in world <b>cotton</b> <b>markets</b> have created a crisis in the region's cotton sectors. Cotton is still being produced within an institutional structure that dates back to the independence era of the early 1960 's.

This paper uses an economic model of the agricultural sector to predict the impacts of cotton liberalization. Shifting control from the state {{into the hands of the}} private sector would provide significant benefits to society. Farmers in particular, hard hit by the cotton crisis, would receive long-needed relief from prior policies that kept cotton incomes artificially below world price levels.
