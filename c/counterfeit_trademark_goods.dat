Supreme Court has also ruled that putting <b>trademark</b> on the <b>goods</b> manufactured in violation of the restriction of the territory and the prohibition of subcontracting of the License Agreement is not a legal use of trademark and jeopardizes the quality guarantee function of trademark as it deprives of the capability to control the quality of the <b>trademark</b> <b>goods</b> from the <b>trademark</b> owner. Use of trademark shall not be legal with respect to the goods manufactured in violation of restriction on the territory of manufacture. Violation of restriction on subcontracting will not make the use of trademark illegal. The restriction of subcontracting is not eligible for registration in case of the sole and exclusive license, without which use of trademark in violation of such restriction is considered not to be the infringement of trademark rights. The same shall apply to all licenses. Harm to the quality guarantee function of trademark shall be measured by more objective standards, such as the qualities or characteristics of the goods in stream, than internal relations of trademark owners, such as the violation of the terms of the license agreements...|$|R
40|$|Nowadays global {{concerns}} are tightly {{linked to the}} way wine production and labelling have been regulated in France. This paper aims to provide an historical explanation of this peculiar regulation of the wine market in France. Our argument will be that wine adulteration, as it is conceived and regulated nowadays, has to be distinguished from ancient and pre-modern forms of adulteration. From {{the last quarter of}} the nineteenth century, technical progresses (i. e. organic chemistry in food and wine making), extended commercial networks and an extending intermediation led to market failures. However, state regulation mainly aimed to ensure the circulation of information and fair trade rather than to protect public health. As a result, from the end of the nineteenth century up to the present, in France and in Europe, rules on beverages are more concerned with preserving AOC (collective trademarks) and wine producers' profits than with limiting alcohol consumption. wine, quality, adulteration, <b>counterfeiting,</b> <b>trademark,...</b>|$|R

In the U.S., trademark registration can therefore only be sold and assigned if accompanied by the sale of an underlying asset.

40|$|China {{has become}} the world’s {{trademark}} powerhouse with {{the largest number of}} <b>trademark</b> registrations for <b>goods</b> and services. Parallel to the new rise is the explosion of scandals concerning <b>trademarked</b> <b>goods,</b> causing numerous deaths, massive hospitalizations, and consumer defection from domestic brands. Instead of having a trademark law with consumer protection as the cornerstone, China’s new Trademark Law will cement China as the world’s manufacturer of trademarks. This Article is the first to critically examine China’s new Trademark Law. The new law mainly centers on creating procedural measures for more trademark registrations, maintaining China’s trademark registration powerhouse status, and perpetuating China’s obsession with metrics-based reform. Metrics obsession will neither instill public trust in Chinese brands nor encourage public consumption to meet China’s national economic goal of stimulating moderately high growth. This Article suggests a return to trademark fundamentals {{for the safety of the}} public in China and the world.

50|$|Trademark law {{dates back}} to the age of President Ulysses S. Grant {{starting}} in the late 19th century with the Trademark Act of 1870. The Trademark Act of 1870 was the first trademark act passed in the nation and grounded trademark protection into Article 1 of the U.S. Constitution. The act covered many different aspects of trademark law but failed to cover <b>trademark</b> <b>counterfeiting.</b> After much protest from merchants and manufactures around the country, Congress amended the act to make counterfeiting a crime. This however was short lived, as the case U.S. v. Steffens in 1879 ruled that Article One of the Constitution could not serve as a basis of authority and thus making the Trademark Act of 1870 unconstitutional. All trademark acts after the 1870 one, including the 1881 Trademark Act and the 1946 Trademark Act (The Lanham Act), make no mention of the <b>trademark</b> <b>counterfeiting</b> provision of the 1870 act.|$|R
40|$|Of all the {{instances}} and {{schemes for}} infringing and <b>counterfeiting</b> <b>trademark</b> rights, perhaps none {{has been as}} successful and insidious as “replicas. ” The term “replica,” when applied, for instance, to a watch or handbag, is synonymous with “counterfeit. ” Both terms are used to describe a product that is an exact and unauthorized copy of an authentic product. While some street merchants may call their counterfeit products “replicas,” the designation exploded in popularity on the thousands of websites that boast look-alike counterfeit products. The popularity of “replica” goods is largely dependent on the absence of liability for manufacturers of these transient and low-cost goods, coupled with the public’s quest for a luxury image without the luxury good price. The prevalence of replica goods and the never-ending demand for them has created an unprecedented enforcement challenge for trademark owners. This Article discusses the issue of replicas and the difficulty in applying liability. It addresses the difficulty in convincing consumers that replica goods are harmful, absent some personal liability. United States Customs even permits those traveling to the United States to import one counterfeit good, such as a handbag or item of clothing, {{so long as it}} is intended for personal use. How can trademark owners persuade consumers that all counterfeiting is a crime, when certain circumstances allow—or in the case of replicas, at least appear to condone—counterfeit products? The Author concludes that trademark owners must be proactive and search for alternative ways to enforce their intellectual property rights, including holding third parties liable for infringement...|$|R
40|$|Judicial {{appointment}} of private attorneys as special prosecutors has occurred and {{is permitted to}} occur {{in a variety of}} contexts other than when the executive branch is faced with a potential or actual conflict of interest.
