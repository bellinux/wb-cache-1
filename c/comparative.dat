40|$|This article {{demonstrates}} {{the relevance of}} measurement theory for the linguistic analysis of omparative statements. In particular, the article focuses on interadjective <b>comparatives</b> like ‘x is P-er than y is Q’ and <b>comparatives</b> involving multidimensional adjectives. It is argued that Bale’s (2008) recent proposal to account for such <b>comparatives</b> is rather limited and just one way to account for interadjective comparison. In fact, it is shown that we can account for interadjective <b>comparatives</b> by using recently developed measurement-theoretic techniques in political economy. This article also discusses how to construct the desired scales, if one starts with a delineation approach of <b>comparatives...</b>|$|R
40|$|The goal of {{this paper}} is to explain the meaning and {{distribution}} of indefinites in <b>comparatives,</b> focusing on English some and any and German irgend-indefinites. We consider three competing theories of <b>comparatives</b> in combination with an alternative semantics of some and any, and a novel account of stressed irgend-indefinites. One of the resulting accounts, based on Heim’s analysis of <b>comparatives,</b> predicts all the relevant differences in quantificational force, and explains why free choice indefinites are licensed in <b>comparatives...</b>|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we discuss a {{particular}} type of <b>comparatives,</b> that we call reflexive <b>comparatives.</b> These reflexive <b>comparatives</b> have the property that they compare an object with itself, but with respect to different temporal, spatial or scalar indices. We argue that this property can be viewed as the optimal outcome of a conflict between two general constraints on the arguments of a semantic relation. A semantics of reflexive <b>comparatives</b> is proposed which is based on paths in scalar and other domains. 1 Reflexive <b>comparatives</b> In this paper we want to draw attention to a type of <b>comparatives</b> that has not received much attention in the literature. We call these <b>comparatives</b> reflexive for reasons that will become clear in the analysis that we will provide of this type.

40|$|We {{propose a}} model of {{semantic}} interpretation of <b>comparatives</b> {{which is based on}} a mechanism for semantic copying. Besides common phrasal and clausal forms of <b>comparatives,</b> our model also incorporates the analysis of referential and textual phenomena that interact with the interpretation of <b>comparatives,</b> viz. metonymies and omitted complements.

While these may arguably be <b>comparatives,</b> the addition of tjinene indicates a unique form.|$|R
5|$|If we {{want more}} fish, we should shift that person who has a <b>comparative</b> {{advantage}} in fish hunting (i.e. Friday) out of coconut gathering and into fish hunting. When Friday is producing 96 pounds of fish, he is fully occupied. If fish production is to be increased beyond this point, Crusoe will have to start hunting fish. Here onward, {{the slope of the}} joint PPF is -2. If we want to produce only fish, then the economy will have 144 pounds of fish, 48 from Crusoe and 96 from Friday. Thus the joint PPF is kinked because Crusoe and Friday have <b>comparative</b> advantages in different commodities. As the economy gets more and more ways of producing output and different <b>comparative</b> advantages, the PPF becomes concave.|$|E

5|$|Some {{adjectives}} are inflected for {{degree of}} comparison, with the positive degree unmarked, the suffix -er marking the <b>comparative,</b> and -est marking the superlative: a small boy, {{the boy is}} smaller than the girl, that boy is the smallest. Some adjectives have irregular <b>comparative</b> and superlative forms, such as good, better, and best. Other adjectives have comparatives formed by periphrastic constructions, with the adverb more marking the <b>comparative,</b> and most marking the superlative: happier or more happy, the happiest or most happy. There is some variation among speakers regarding which adjectives use inflected or periphrastic comparison, and some studies have shown a tendency for the periphrastic forms to become more common {{at the expense of}} the inflected form.|$|E

5|$|The {{development}} of <b>comparative</b> philology in the 19th century, together with ethnological discoveries in the 20th century, established {{the science of}} myth. Since the Romantics, all study of myth has been <b>comparative.</b> Wilhelm Mannhardt, James Frazer, and Stith Thompson employed the <b>comparative</b> approach to collect and classify the themes of folklore and mythology. In 1871 Edward Burnett Tylor published his Primitive Culture, in which he applied the <b>comparative</b> method {{and tried to explain}} the origin and evolution of religion.* Robert A. Segal, Theorizing about Myth, 16 Tylor's procedure of drawing together material culture, ritual and myth of widely separated cultures influenced both Carl Jung and Joseph Campbell. Max Müller applied the new science of <b>comparative</b> mythology to the study of myth, in which he detected the distorted remains of Aryan nature worship. Bronisław Malinowski emphasized the ways myth fulfills common social functions. Claude Lévi-Strauss and other structuralists have compared the formal relations and patterns in myths throughout the world.|$|E
