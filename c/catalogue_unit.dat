500|$|In 1972, {{in order}} to {{harmonise}} units of measure {{as part of a}} programme to facilitate trade between member states, the EEC issued directive 71/354/EEC. [...] This directive <b>catalogued</b> <b>units</b> of measure {{that could be used for}} [...] "economic, public health, public safety and administrative purposes" [...] and also provided instructions for a transition from the existing units of measure that were in use. [...] The directive replicated the CGPM SI recommendations and in addition pre-empted some of the additions whose use had been recommended by the CIPM in 1969, but had not been ratified by the CGPM. The directive also <b>catalogued</b> <b>units</b> of measure whose status would be reviewed by the end of 1977 (mainly coherent CGS units of measure) and also <b>catalogued</b> <b>units</b> of measure that were to be phased out by the end of 1977, including the use of obsolete names for the sale of timber such as the stere, the use of units of force and pressure that made use of the acceleration due to gravity, the use of non-coherent units of power such as the Pferdestärke (PS), the use of the calorie as a measure of energy and the stilb as a measure of luminance. The directive was silent in respect of units that were specific to one or two countries including the pond, pfund, livre (Dutch, German and French synonyms for 500g), thereby effectively prohibiting their use as well.|$|R

The radian, being [...] of a revolution, has mathematical advantages but it is cumbersome for navigation, and, as with time, the units used in navigation have a large degree of consistency around the world.

40|$|Bell (2012) <b>catalogued</b> <b>unit</b> root factors {{contained}} in linear filters used in seasonal adjustment (model-based {{or from the}} X- 11 method) but noted that, for model-based seasonal adjustment, special cases could arise where filters could contain more unit root factors than was indicated by the general results. This article reviews some special cases that occur with canonical ARIMA model based adjustment in which, with some commonly used ARIMA models, the symmetric seasonal filters contain two extra nonseasonal differences (i. e., they include an extra (1 - B) (1 - F)). This increases by two the degree of polynomials in time that are annihilated by the seasonal filter and reproduced by the seasonal adjustment filter. Other results for canonical ARIMA adjustment that are reported in Bell (2012), including properties of the trend and irregular filters, and properties of the asymmetric and finite filters, are unaltered in these special cases. Special cases for seasonal adjustment with structural ARIMA component models are also briefly discussed...|$|R

We will also introduce the first results of the inundation calculation at a very high spatial resolution (grid size of 1 to 5 m) obtained in others studies like ALDES (Le Roy, Pedreros and Monfort, 2011) to discuss of: lidar processing data, role of the land use and the difference of the inundation simulations in presence or not of buildings and structures...|$|R
