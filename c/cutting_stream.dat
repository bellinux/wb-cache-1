50|$|Oxbow lakes {{are created}} when growing meanders {{intersect}} each other and cut off a meander loop, leaving it without an active <b>cutting</b> <b>stream.</b> This process is usually linked to flooding where the river will tend to {{the path of least}} resistance. The oxbow, being of much lower energy than the more direct path, collects more and more deposited sediment each season of flooding until it becomes independent from the river. The largest oxbow lakes will be in areas with wider flood plains where the rivers have more room to meander. Over a period of time, these oxbow lakes tend to dry out or fill in with sediments.|$|E

50|$|The {{length of}} Miller Creek from its {{junction}} with Sixtymile River, {{a tributary of}} the Yukon River, is about , and its course is nearly straight. The gradient of its bed is considerable, {{as is the case with}} all other streams in this region, and this gradient increases slightly toward the head of the creek. At the extreme head, the slope becomes very steep, the angle nearly corresponding with that of the sides of the valley farther down. In general the valley is V-shaped, but at the head it widens and shows a tendency to assume a more curved, or U-shaped, outline in cross-section, thus suggesting a glacial amphitheater or cirque. It is indeed probably to ice action that this broadening and flattening is due. In the winter ice and snow accumulate and have a tendency to move from the dividing ridge down the steep slopes which the rapidly <b>cutting</b> <b>stream</b> has left. During the spring months, when the ice is softening and melting, the head of the valley is occupied by a veritable though small and transient glacier. The rounding of the head of the valley and its gradual alteration into the form of a cirque is due in part to the moving of the ice, but perhaps more largely to the erosion of the glacial waters, which are distributed over the whole width of the valley instead of being concentrated in its bottom, as are the streams that have no dependence upon ice. As the ice melts, great furrows and ditches are formed on the glacier, and the water flowing from these and falling over the ice front forms waterfalls which churn up the gravel and carry it down the valley, so that the bed rock is often laid bare. As the front of the ice recedes, this vigorous erosion is brought to bear upon successively higher parts of the valley. This action was of economic importance, since it prevents accumulations of auriferous gravels within areas in which it operates—a fact which was proved by prospecting. Miller and Glacier creeks flow into Sixtymile. The drainage areas of Sixtymile and Fortymile rivers are separated by a ridge of moderate height, whose top is comparatively flat and forms part of the general plateau in which the streams have excavated their deep valleys in late geological time.|$|E
40|$|An {{investigation}} of carbon pathways in New Zealand streams {{was carried out}} using a multi-faceted, experimental approach. A series of research projects, presented as individual papers, was conducted with special emphasis on consumer processing. Breakdown of mountain beech (Nothofagus solandri var. cliffortiodes) enclosed in coarse-mesh (3 mm) and fine-mesh (0. 2 mm) bags was studied in two physically contrasting streams. Weight losses were most rapid in coarse-mesh bags held in Middle Bush Stream, a relatively stable stream with a large shredder population. The rate of leaf breakdown in coarsemesh bags in Craigieburn <b>Cutting</b> <b>Stream</b> {{was similar to that}} In fine-mesh bags buried in both streams. Leaves in bags buried in the beds of both streams lost weight more slowly than their surface counterparts and had slightly lower protein levels and respiration rates. Larvae of the caddisfly, Zelandopsyche ingens, were primarily responsible for the rapid disappearance of beech leaves In Middle Bush Stream. Cage experiments demonstrated that larvae grew and survived equally well in both streams and the absence of Z. ingens from the Craigieburn <b>Cutting</b> <b>Stream</b> benthos was attributed to the inability of the stream to retain coarse particulate organic matter inputs. Retention appears to be the key to shredder distribution and abundance and hence is a major factor controlling litter breakdown. The development, structure and utilisation of stone surface organic layers was investigated at two field sites in dark and natural lighting conditions. In the dark at the forest site an organic layer consisting of slime, fine particles, bacteria and fungi developed and attained maximum biomass (0. 08 mg. cm- 2) in about two months. In the dark at the spring site where water was low in dissolved and particulate organic matter (DOC level < 0. 5 g. m- 3) no organic layer developed whereas under conditions of natural lighting at both sites, layers were dominated by diatoms and/or filamentous algae. Laboratory experiments demonstrated the importance of dissolved organic matter (DOM) as a prerequisite for layer formation. Uptake by micro-organisms accounted for most of the reduction in levels of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) recorded in recirculating stream channels. Radiotracer experiments (14 C and 144 Ce) showed that several common stream invertebrates could feed on "heterotrophic layers" (assimilation efficiencies 18 to 74 %) and suggested that the non-autotrophic components of stone surface organic layers are likely to playa significant role in carbon transfer to the benthos, particularly in small, shaded streams. Utilisation of allochthonous and autochthonous inputs by benthic invertebrates was investigated using stable carbon isotope analysis. The faunas of small, forested streams depended primarily on allochthonous sources of carbon whereas variable utilisation of allochthonous and autochthonous materials was shown by species from a grassland stream. Relatively depleted 13 C values obtained for the mayfly Deleatidium taken from forested sites suggest that its larvae assimilate algae selectively. A shift to greater dependence on autochthonous energy sources was shown by invertebrates from small recently clear-cut catchments (1 - 4 years) in response to canopy removal and flushing of forest-derived organic materials. Although only of a preliminary nature, my results suggest that stable carbon isotope analysis is a useful technique for providing insights into trophic linkages within stream communities. Finally, the influence of physical factors and forest type on the distribution of benthic invertebrate faunas in 43 New Zealand streams was investigated using a systematised survey technique. Several common taxa were numerically dominant at most sites regardless of forest type and both distribution of shredders and faunal diversity were related to stream stability. Implications of these findings for forest-stream management are discussed. In general, New Zealand stream ecosystems are viewed as being strongly dominated by physical factors which determine and limit the framework within. which biological communities can function. Integration of the mass-balance and intra-system approaches to carbon processing is suggested as the logical way to promote understanding of carbon flows to, from and within stream ecosystems...|$|E

40|$|Strawberries {{harvested}} {{for processing}} as frozen fruits are currently de-calyxed manually in the field. This process requires {{the removal of}} the stem cap with green leaves (i. e. the calyx) and incurs many disadvantages when performed by hand. Not only does it necessitate the need to maintain cutting tool sanitation, but it also increases labor time and exposure of the de-capped strawberries before in-plant processing. This leads to labor inefficiency and decreased harvest yield. By moving the calyx removal process from the fields to the processing plants, this new practice would reduce field labor and improve management and logistics, while increasing annual yield. As labor prices continue to increase, the strawberry industry has shown great interest in {{the development and implementation of}} an automated calyx removal system. In response, this dissertation describes the design, operation, and performance of a full-scale automatic vision-guided intelligent de-calyxing (AVID) prototype machine. The AVID machine utilizes commercially available equipment to produce a relatively low cost automated de-calyxing system that can be retrofitted into existing food processing facilities. This dissertation is broken up into five sections. The first two sections include a machine overview and a 12 -week processing plant pilot study. Results of the pilot study indicate the AVID machine is able to de-calyx grade- 1 -with-cap conical strawberries at roughly 66 percent output weight yield at a throughput of 10, 000 pounds per hour. The remaining three sections describe in detail the three main components of the machine: a strawberry loading and orientation conveyor, a machine vision system for calyx identification, and a synchronized multi-waterjet knife calyx removal system. In short, the loading system utilizes rotational energy to orient conical strawberries. The machine vision system determines cut locations through RGB real-time feature extraction. The high-speed multi-waterjet knife system uses direct drive actuation to locate 30, 000 psi <b>cutting</b> <b>streams</b> to precise coordinates for calyx removal. Based on the observations and studies performed within this dissertation, the AVID machine is seen to be a viable option for automated high-throughput strawberry calyx removal. A summary of future tasks and further improvements is discussed at the end...|$|R

50|$|A second mystery {{was that}} while the lower layers of the Plateau {{appeared}} to be sinking, overall the Plateau was rising.

25|$|The {{history of}} E. annectens predates both Edmontosaurus and annectens.

Cope believed that Leidy had failed to properly characterize the genus Trachodon and later abandoned its use, so he assigned the old species to his newer genus.

30|$|The {{trend of}} the {{majority}} of the lineaments is in the E–W direction, and some of the lineaments show N–S, NNW–SSE, and NNE–SSW trend. The lineaments are the major fractures and dykes. The fractures are related to shears and the dykes appear to occupy dilatory tensional fractures. Dykes are vertical intrusions showing linear ridges due to differential weathering. They are simple and undifferentiated. The dykes trending E–W and ENE–WSW directions are parallel to the Narmada–Tapi–Satpura zones. These dykes extend for kilometers with varying thickness. The dykes belonging to these sets are generally coarse grained, gabbroic. The jointing pattern produces larger blocks. Dykes belonging to the north–south swarm are few in number and are exposed in the southern and western parts of the Panzra river (Sheth and Chandrasekharam 1997). Some of the dykes exhibit a negative relief at higher elevations but stand out as low elevation in the low lying areas. These are compact fine grained and exhibit closely spaced joints. Some of the dykes are partly concealed, while some are exposed in <b>stream</b> <b>cuttings,</b> dug well section, and road cuts.

30|$|Floodplain {{constriction}} is a {{key factor}} in scour damage risk (Anderson et al. 2014) as floodplains are vital to the attenuation of flood waves during storm events (Luke et al. 2015). Thus from the perspective of bridge scour, increases in channel flow, velocity and water surface elevation can lead to increased scour potential. The linkage between bridge scour and floodplain access is {{complicated by the fact that}} roads and bridges are often placed near or across rivers and <b>streams</b> <b>cutting</b> them off from their natural floodplains. Lack of floodplain access often increases stream velocities, worsening in-stream incision and bank erosion, which in turn increases vulnerability to scour. Developing smart remediation strategies that reduce stream velocities and bridge scour during large storm events and help ameliorate the tradeoffs between human infrastructure needs and protection of the natural environment is critical for long-term sustainability. Mitigating scour risk by restoring floodplain access (i.e. regions adjacent to the stream channel which may become inundated during high-flow events) away from the bridge would help attenuate flood waves and result in smaller peak stage and discharge during storm events, which has obvious benefits that extend beyond bridge scour mitigation. Increased floodplain access may be beneficial in two ways: by decreasing backwaters, increases in water elevation upstream of constrictions, and decreasing peak flow velocities created downstream of constrictions.|$|R

The Experimental EarthScape run in 2006 (XES 06) examined the development of fluvial morphology and alluvial architecture as a function of subsidence and sediment flux in an experimental basin based on the form of a simple half graben. Sediments from tributary drainages were introduced into the axial <b>stream</b> through toe <b>cutting</b> and realignment of transverse drainage courses to parallel the prevailing axial-flow direction. Transverse sediment contributions to the axial stream were almost equally apportioned over a wide range of sediment discharges tested in the experiments.
