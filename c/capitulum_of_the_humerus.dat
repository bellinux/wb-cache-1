40|$|This study {{aimed to}} {{determine}} the causative factors underlying poor outcomes in <b>the</b> treatment <b>of</b> children with fractures <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>capitulum</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> distal  <b>humerus.</b> Materials and Methods: We conducted a retrospective analysis of community-based treatment of 36 patients with fractures <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>capitulum</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> distal <b>humerus</b> who presented to <b>the</b> Department <b>of</b> rehabilitation between 2010 and 2015 owing to poor treatment outcomes. Analysis only involved patients presenting with an extensive dataset {{with regard to their}} treatment, including X-rays taken at <b>the</b> time <b>of</b> <b>the</b> injury and at subsequent stages of treatment. Results: It was found that there had been inaccuracies at <b>the</b> stage <b>of</b> diagnosis in 47. 2 % of patients, errors in <b>the</b> selection <b>of</b> treatment in 13. 9 %, and errors in post-operative management in 38. 9 %. Conclusion: When interpreting radiographs, it is important that physicians clearly assess <b>the</b> degree <b>of</b> displacement when evaluating fractures <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>capitulum</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> distal <b>humerus.</b> Dislocated fractures require the most accurate reposition. When choosing a treatment method, it is important to predict <b>the</b> possibility <b>of</b> post-traumatic complications.

[Subjects] The study subjects were 34 subjects without shoulder pain. [Methods] Ultrasonographic measurements <b>of</b> <b>the</b> acromio-humeral distance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> subjects were made at three shoulder positions: 90 ° flexion, scaption at 90 ° abduction, and 90 ° abduction in an upright sitting position.

The measurements were made three times in each position. [Results] There was a significant difference in acromiohuneral distance between neutral and internal rotation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>humerus,</b> and between external rotation and internal rotation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>humerus.</b> In <b>the</b> scap-tion position, {{there was a significant difference}} between neutral and internal rotation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>humerus,</b> and between external rotation and internal rotation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>humerus.</b> In <b>the</b> 90 ° flexion position, there was a significant difference between neutral and internal rotation, and between neutral and external rotation.

50|$|The radius {{is part of}} two joints: {{the elbow}} and the wrist. At the elbow, it joins with the <b>capitulum</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>humerus,</b> and in a {{separate}} region, with the ulna at the radial notch. At the wrist, the radius forms a joint with the ulna bone.|$|E
50|$|Several {{synovial}} folds project {{into the}} recesses of the joint.These folds or plicae are remnants of normal embryonic development and can be categorized as either anterior (anterior humeral recess) or posterior (olecranon recess).A crescent-shaped fold is commonly present between {{the head of the}} radius and the <b>capitulum</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>humerus.</b>|$|E

40|$|Sex {{determination}} from bones is {{of vital}} importance in anthropological studies and medico-legal cases. The present {{study focused on}} measurements <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Humerus</b> and to evaluate the differences in sex present in the morphology through statistical analysis.

30|$|Compared to {{leg length}} {{discrepancies}}, arm length discrepancies are less frequent and subsequent secondary damage is lower [2]. But, functional impairment, cosmetic reasons and muscular problems {{may be an}} indication for a correction. Lengthening <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>humerus</b> was first reported by Dick and Tietjen in 1978 using a Wagner fixator, plating and bone grafting [3]. Since then, different ways of external fixation have been described for lengthening <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>humerus</b> [4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]. Currently, circular frames like the Ilizarov frame and monolateral fixators {{are the most common}} fixation techniques and lead to similar results [8, 9]. The results indicate a significant improvement of function, and therefore, lengthening <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>humerus</b> is not just a cosmetic procedure.|$|R

25|$|In {{addition}} to <b>the</b> four muscles <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rotator cuff, the deltoid muscle and teres major muscles arise and {{exist in the}} shoulder region itself.

The teres major attaches to <b>the</b> outer part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> back <b>of</b> <b>the</b> scapula, beneath the teres minor, and attaches to <b>the</b> upper part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>humerus.</b> It helps with medial rotation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>humerus.</b>|$|R

40|$|Background: the bicipital groove {{is located}} between the greater and lesser tubercles at <b>the</b> {{proximal}} extremity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>humerus</b> and extends inferiorly.
