25|$|California-style pizza (also {{known as}} California pizza or Gourmet pizza) is {{a style of}} single-serving pizza that {{combines}} New York and Italian thin crust with toppings from the California cuisine cooking style. Its invention is generally attributed to chef Ed LaDou, and <b>Chez</b> <b>Panisse,</b> in Berkeley, California. Wolfgang Puck, after meeting LaDou, popularized the style of pizza {{in the rest of}} the country. It is served in a number of California Cuisine restaurants. Such restaurant chains as California Pizza Kitchen, Extreme Pizza, and Sammy's Woodfired Pizza are three major pizza franchises associated with California-style pizza. Nancy Silverton's Pizzeria Mozza is also a popular California-style pizza restaurant in Los Angeles.|$|E
25|$|Founder Steve Sullivan {{grew up in}} Los Gatos, California, and {{enrolled}} at the University of California, Berkeley in 1975, intending to major in rhetoric. He earned money as a busboy at <b>Chez</b> <b>Panisse.</b> While riding his bike through England during a summer trip to Europe he bought English Bread and Yeast Cookery, Elizabeth David's 1977 book on breadmaking and bread history. Excited by the book, and wanting to recreate the bread he had enjoyed in Paris, he began experimenting with baking for himself. In 1979, when ChezPanisse's then-supplier, the Cheese Board Collective, could {{not keep up with}} its demands, Sullivan became the restaurant's in-house breadmaker. However, his breadmaking and the restaurant's food preparation were both competing for the restaurant's limited physical space. In 1983 he left, with the restaurant's encouragement, to open his own company, Acme. Jeremiah Tower, then head chef, encouraged Sullivan to study breadmaking at Narsai David's bakery. He and wife Susan launched Acme with approximately $180,000 of seed capital, half funded by Doobie Brothers guitarist Patrick Simmons through a leaseback arrangement.|$|E
2500|$|California-style pizza {{was invented}} {{more or less}} {{simultaneously}} in 1980 by Ed LaDou (the [...] "Prince of Pizza"), then working as pizza chef for Spectrum Foods' Prego Restaurant in San Francisco's Cow Hollow neighborhood, and by pizza chefs working for Alice Waters at the <b>Chez</b> <b>Panisse</b> cafe in Berkeley, California.|$|E
2500|$|Wolfgang Puck, in 1980 and 1981, was {{preparing}} to open the restaurant {{that would make him}} famous, Spago, in West Hollywood, California. Initially conceived as a pizzeria, Spago's was modeled after the upstairs cafe at <b>Chez</b> <b>Panisse.</b> [...] He was so impressed with the pizza LaDou had made for him at Prego, he hired LaDou as head pizza chef. [...] Under Puck's guidance, LaDou developed more than 250 pizza concepts using ingredients such as scallops, roe, and baby zucchini flowers. Among their most famous invention was [...] "Jewish pizza", a pizza dough first cooked then topped with smoked salmon, crème fraîche, capers, and dill. [...] Another innovation was using infused olive oil, baby vegetables, chili oil, and flavored dough.|$|E
2500|$|By 1980, Alice Waters' <b>Chez</b> <b>Panisse</b> and {{its head}} chef, Jeremiah Tower, had already invented California cuisine, a {{combination}} of French and Italian techniques and presentation with fresh local ingredient-focused flavors. Waters was a long-time fan of Tommasso's Italian restaurant in San Francisco's North Beach, which had installed the West Coast's first wood-fired pizza oven {{when it opened in}} 1935. [...] After traveling to Italy, Waters decided to make an open kitchen featuring a Tomasso's-style pizza oven the focus of the new cafe she was opening above her main dining room. [...] Although prepared in classic fashion, her chefs added exotic fine ingredients to their single-serving pizzas and calzones, such as goat cheese and duck sausage. [...] Her cafe, and its pizzas in particular, were an instant success, attracting wide attention among food critics.|$|E
2500|$|To {{the west}} of the central campus is the {{downtown}} business district of Berkeley; to the northwest is the neighborhood of North Berkeley, including the so-called Gourmet Ghetto, a commercial district known for high quality dining due to the presence of such world-renowned restaurants as <b>Chez</b> <b>Panisse.</b> Immediately to the north is a quiet residential neighborhood known as Northside with a large graduate student population; situated north of that are the upscale residential neighborhoods of the Berkeley Hills. Immediately southeast of campus lies fraternity row, and beyond that the Clark Kerr Campus and an upscale residential area named Claremont.

2500|$|The {{position}} {{taken by}} the Berkeley City Council was interpreted by many across {{the country as a}} sign that they did not support the troops. Berkeley's motion was followed by a backlash in conservative blogs and among conservative lawmakers, including introduction of the [...] "Semper Fi Act" [...] in Congress to cancel several million dollars in specific federal funding for public primary and secondary education programs, the University of California, Berkeley, and key transportation programs including a proposed state-operated ferry service to Albany and Berkeley. [...] In response to the council's vote, on February 1, 2008 Senator Jim DeMint said that he would introduce legislation that would strip Berkeley of its $2,392,000 in federal funding. On February 6, 2008 Jim DeMint was joined by Saxby Chambliss, Tom Coburn, John Cornyn, James Inhofe, and David Vitter in the Senate to introduce the Semper Fi Act of 2008 which would strip federal funding from Berkeley. In total, the bill was co-sponsored by 10 senators. The bill strips $243,000 from the <b>Chez</b> <b>Panisse</b> Foundation which provides school lunches to children in Berkeley, and $975,000 allocated to build the Matsui Center for Politics and Public Service at the University of California, Berkeley which would have created an archive of Robert Matsui's papers and a new endowment. The bill was defeated on March 13, 2008.|$|E
2500|$|In 2006, {{the museum}} began hosting a triennial, juried {{contemporary}} portrait exhibition called the Outwin Boochever Portrait Competition. [...] Named after long time docent and volunteer Virginia Outwin Boochever, this competition {{is widely regarded}} as the most prestigious portrait competition in the United States. [...] Artists working in the fields of painting, drawing, sculpture, photography, and other media are allowed to enter. Works must be created through a face-to-face encounter with the subject. The inaugural competition in 2006 drew more than 4000 entries, from which 51 finalists were chosen. [...] For the 2013 competition the total prize money of $42,000 was awarded to the top eight commended artists, and the winner received $25,000 and a commission to make a portrait for the museum’s permanent collection. The subject of the commission is decided jointly by the artist and the NPG curators. [...] The 2006 winner was David Lenz of Milwaukee, Wisconsin, and he was commissioned to paint a portrait of Eunice Kennedy Shriver, the founder of Special Olympics. [...] It was the first portrait commissioned of an individual who has not served as a President or First Lady. The 2009 winner, Dave Woody of Fort Collins, Colorado, was commissioned to photograph food pioneer Alice Waters, founder of the <b>Chez</b> <b>Panisse</b> Restaurant and Cafe, the Edible Schoolyard and champion of the Slow Food movement.
