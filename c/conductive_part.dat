2500|$|Cars {{can build}} up static charge by driving on dry road surfaces. However many tire {{compounds}} contain enough carbon black {{to provide an}} electrical ground which prevents charge build-up. Newer [...] "high mileage" [...] tires use more silica and can increase the buildup of static. A driver who does not discharge static by contacting a <b>conductive</b> <b>part</b> of the car will carry it to the insulated handle of the nozzle and the static potential will eventually be discharged when this purposely-grounded arrangement is put {{into contact with the}} metallic filler neck of the vehicle. Ordinarily, vapor concentrations in the area of this filling operation are below the lower explosive limit (LEL) of the product being dispensed, so the static discharge causes no problem. The problem with ungrounded gas cans results from a combination of vehicular static charge, the potential between the container and the vehicle, and the loose fit between the grounded nozzle and the gas can. This last condition causes a rich vapor concentration in the ullage (the unfilled volume) of the gas can, and a discharge from the can to the grounded hanging hardware (the nozzle, hose, swivels and break-a-ways) can thus occur at a most inopportune point. The Petroleum Equipment Institute has recorded incidents of static-related ignition at refueling sites since early 2000.|$|E

40|$|The bonding of {{electrical}} equipment plays {{a crucial role}} in maintaining the same potential between <b>conductive</b> <b>parts</b> likely to be energized and <b>conductive</b> <b>parts</b> liable to introduce a "zero" potential into the premises. Voltage rises between such parts are unsafe, as they may induce harmful currents through the human body, the magnitude of which may vary depending on a number of factors. This paper seeks to clarify the bond- ing requirements in low-voltage electrical systems, by using the concepts of exposed <b>conductive</b> <b>parts</b> and extraneous <b>conductive</b> <b>parts,</b> present in the International Electrotechnical Commission standards, applied to a proposed electric shock model of the human being.

40|$|International (IEC) European (CENELEC) and American (NEC) Standards require, in each building, the {{connection}} of extraneous <b>conductive</b> <b>parts</b> (i. e. metal water or gas pipes) to the main grounding terminal. There are two good reasons for this: the voltage between extraneous <b>conductive</b> <b>parts</b> and exposed <b>conductive</b> <b>parts</b> is zeroed and extraneous <b>conductive</b> <b>parts</b> {{can contribute to the}} leakage of fault current into the ground. There is however a third advantage in the bonding connection: the entire structure (floors and walls of the building), together with the exposed and the extraneous metallic parts, forms a quasi-equipotential system, with the consequent strong reduction of touch voltages. Metallic pipes and reinforcement of reinforced concrete have a particular relevance thanks to their large widespread through buildings. However, in some practical cases, {{it is not possible to}} connect all extraneous <b>conductive</b> <b>parts</b> to the protective equipotential bonding because they are not accessible. In the paper, the reduction of touch voltages in buildings, when these extraneous <b>conductive</b> <b>parts</b> are present but not connected to the protective equipotential bonding is quantified. Different building models are created and solved by the finite element method in order to calculate touch voltages in different scenarios. The results show that the mere presence of widespread metallic parts in buildings helps to reduce touch voltages, but not enough to ensure safety against indirect contacts. The electrical installation safety performance is greatly improved in reinforced concrete buildings if at least some easily accessible parts, like water or central heating pipes, are connected to the main grounding terminal. Also in brick buildings, they provide a certain reduction of GPR, maximum and mean touch voltages...|$|R
50|$|Shocks can {{be caused}} by direct or {{indirect}} contact. Contact with an exposed <b>conductive</b> <b>part</b> under fault conditions is called direct contact. IEC requires certain degrees of ingress protection against direct contact. Indirect contact protections can be achieved by earthed equipotential bonding and automatic disconnection of supply by using Residual Current Devices, for example.|$|E
50|$|Surgical and implantable {{hearing aids}} are an {{alternative}} to conventional external hearing aids. If the ear is dry and not infected, an air conduction aid could be tried; if the ear is draining, a direct bone condition hearing aid is often the best solution. If the <b>conductive</b> <b>part</b> of the hearing loss is more than 30-35 dB, an air conduction device could have problems overcoming this gap. A bone-anchored hearing aid could, in this situation, be a good option.The active bone conduction hearing implant Bonebridge is also an option. This implant is invisible under the intact skin and therefore minimises the risk of skin irritations.|$|E
50|$|Power is {{supplied}} to the ADC port by an additional finger connector {{on the video}} card, which plugs into a slot on the motherboard between the AGP slot and the back panel of the computer; on G4 Macs, some power is also sent through AGP pins 3 and 11. When ADC was introduced, AGP pins 3 and 11 were unassigned. In AGP 8x, pins 3 and 11 were assigned, so because of that, G4s are not directly compatible with AGP 8x. G5 Macs draw all power from the finger connector and therefore are 8x compatible. To use an AGP 8x card in a G4, pins 3 and 11 must be somehow disabled; {{this can be done}} by placing tape over the <b>conductive</b> <b>part</b> of the pin, slicing the PCB traces, or on some cards, desoldering surface mount resistors.|$|E

To {{allow for the}} inspection of electrically isolated <b>conductive</b> <b>parts</b> of devices, such as partly processed flat panel displays or printed electronic circuits, new sensor designs have been developed and are evaluated {{with the help of}} finite element simulations. The analysis of the simulation results shows that a clear detection of the <b>conductive</b> <b>parts</b> is achieved if the sensor geometry enforces a non-uniform electrical field distribution in the range of the sensor area.

5000|$|An optical {{ground wire}} (also {{known as an}} OPGW or, in the IEEE standard, an optical fiber {{composite}} overhead ground wire) {{is a type of}} cable that is used in overhead power lines. Such cable combines the functions of grounding and communications. An OPGW cable contains a tubular structure with one or more optical fibers in it, surrounded by layers of steel and aluminum wire. The OPGW cable is run between the tops of high-voltage electricity pylons. The <b>conductive</b> <b>part</b> of the cable serves to bond adjacent towers to earth ground, and shields the high-voltage conductors from lightning strikes. The optical fibers within the cable can be used for high-speed transmission of data, either for the electrical utility's own purposes of protection and control of the transmission line, for the utility's own voice and data communication, or may be leased or sold to third parties to serve as a high-speed fiber interconnection between cities.|$|E
50|$|Firstly, let’s {{follow the}} current path. There is a generic source of current. This source {{can be either}} large or small, as only a small voltage is {{required}} to drive the low current for micro-shock. Such sources might be, a wall socket, a faulty item of equipment, an inappropriate item of equipment, a poorly designed item of equipment, or an item of equipment designed to deliver current into the body. Our patient has unfortunately contacted one such source and current is dispersing through their right arm and upper torso, to eventually converge on a catheter (as labelled - {{but it could be}} a lead or wire) that is placed into their heart. This concentration of current flow at the heart muscle is the danger from micro-shock. If the catheter is conductive and insulated, the current may follow the catheter, emerging through the skin into some other item of equipment. For the circuit as shown to be complete, the <b>conductive</b> <b>part</b> of the catheter needs to also be connected to ground within this equipment. Finally, the hazardous circuit is complete - current can flow and if it continues the patient is in mortal danger. Again, while this is theoretically possible this has never been proven to have actually happened.|$|E

50|$|Earthing connects exposed {{conductive}} {{parts of}} electrical equipment to earth {{in order to}} complete a circuit {{in the event that}} the insulation on a live conductor should fail. Earthing therefore provides a return path for the current required to blow fuses or trip circuit breakers and RCDs, and ensures that the supply is reliably disconnected {{in the event of a}} fault. Bonding is the connection of the exposed <b>conductive</b> <b>part</b> of electrical equipment or objects like mains water / gas supply pipe to the main Earth terminal (MET) to bring all exposed metalwork into the same electrical potential. This is done to minimise the danger of electric shock due to human contact with live parts which could result from bad insulation and insulation failures. Bonding wires are typically thicker than earthing wires to ensure that they have a sufficiently low resistance that hazardous voltages (as calculated by V=IR) cannot appear even in the presence of large fault currents. In domestic wiring, earthing of equipment is done by bonding together the earth points and metallic parts of the appliances and earthed bodies using green/yellow wire coming from the consumer main earthing terminal. The earth terminal is in turn connected to either consumer’s earth electrode (TT system) or to the earth point given by the supplier (TN system). In pre-1966 buildings, the earthing may be connected only to the plumbing system, which is creating potential earthing problems in buildings where the metal pipes are being replaced by non-conductive plastic pipes.|$|E
