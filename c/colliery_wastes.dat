50|$|The area to {{the west}} of the {{junction}} was once heathland and rough pasture which was part of the Royal Forest of Cannock.

The section immediately west of the junction is all that remains of Clayhanger Common, but it consists of marshy acidic grassland, which has enabled willow and birch trees as well as heather to colonise it.

In the ensuing recriminations and official enquiry into the catastrophe, the United Kingdom's National Coal Board was rebuked for extreme industrial negligence.

5|$|In late 1994, {{the power}} station was flooded to a foot deep of sea water, after a freak high tide and strong winds. This {{led to a}} sea defence system being {{constructed}} to protect the building. The problems came about because of the temporary closure of Ellington <b>Colliery.</b> Tipped <b>waste</b> from the <b>colliery</b> had {{been used as a}} coastal defence measure, but as the <b>colliery</b> had closed, <b>waste</b> was no longer being tipped. The colliery was reopened by RJB Mining, and in July 1999 the station ensured the future of the colliery by signing a contract with RJB Mining to be provided with 3,000,000 tonnes of coal from Ellington Colliery and opencast mines in Northumberland, over the course of three years. The colliery closed for good in 2005, leading to problems with coastal defence again, threatening the station's coal stocking area. This required a £2.5 million new coastal defence scheme be put in place, involving the use of large rocks as a defence wall.|$|R
50|$|Coal mining in Coedpoeth is {{documented}} {{from the early}} 15th century. Limited and shallow extraction took place throughout the 18th and 19th centuries, especially for the local iron industry. However, significant extraction did not begin until {{the sinking of the}} first deep shafts in the early 20th century, and now little remains of the industry. A number of <b>colliery</b> <b>waste</b> tips survive, now grown over, and the remains of shallow workings and bell pits are relatively common in some areas, with scheduled examples near Nant Mill. The most significant remains of the industry exist at Plas Power, where many buildings survive after reclamation of the waste tips in the 1990s. The owners of this colliery were also the owners of Plas Power Hall, which was built in 1757 by the Myddleton family; the name was changed to match an early owner, Sir Henry Power. The hall was damaged in a fire and demolished in 1951; but the stables remain after a campaign to list them led by Councillor Gordon Roberts of Middle Road. The estates boundary wall remains, and fills the gap between Coedpoeth and Wrexham, and the northern boundary is followed by the A525, apart from modifications at the A483 junction.|$|R
50|$|The {{colliery}} {{closed in}} 1966 {{as a result}} of the NCB's pit closure programme. The site was a 30ha waste tip and by now surrounded on three sides by council housing. It was eventually reclaimed and landscaped. There was minimal topsoil available on the site and after an initial flush of surface greening, the vegetation on the tip area partly failed due to acidification. In 1990 another effort was made to regenerate the waste tip once more. A joint project was launched with the National Urban Forestry Unit, Barnsley M.B.C, Yorkshire Water and Sludge Consultant to create a stable and self maintaining planting medium. About 30% of the reclamation has been devoted to forestry and rest put to grass. The site of Wharncliffe Woodmoor is now known as Athersley Memorial Park, Laithes Lane playing fields or the 'pit fields', the park is well used especially by local football teams, for fishing and walkers. An estate of private houses has now been built adjacent to the reclaimed <b>colliery</b> <b>waste</b> tip, confirming the improvement of the area’s image.Another £2.7 million development as recently seen the site further develop into a prestigious development of self-contained units known as Woodmoor Court set within Wharncliffe Business Park.|$|R
