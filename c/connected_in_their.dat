2500|$|Considerable media {{attention}} {{was paid to}} the ideology and pathology of Zehaf-Bibeau. Along with Martin Couture-Rouleau and Justin Bourque, he has been labelled a [...] "lone-wolf terrorist". Couture-Rouleau and Zehaf-Bibeau were [...] "both self-radicalized and adrift in their lives and <b>connected</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> sympathy to radical Islamic ideology." [...] Other opinions diverged from simply calling Zehaf-Bibeau a terrorist. Vancouver Sun columnist Ian Mulgrew commented on how the incident, as well as a failed bombing attempt in Victoria by persons motivated similarly to Zehaf-Bibeau, showed 'gaping holes' in the social security net. [...] "These incidents are examples not of Muslim extremism but of the lack of community support for the dysfunctional of any faith who, with a lack of proper attention or the wrong catalyst, become dangerous. I know which approach would make me feel safer, what I would call real security measures: a social safety net that caught those in obvious need before they went postal, people like Zehaf-Bibeau." [...] Green Party leader Elizabeth May said in the House of Commons: [...] "I would put money on these being the acts of isolated, disturbed and deeply troubled men who were drawn to something crazy. I do not believe that it was a vast network, or that the country is more at risk today than it was last week. However, that is my opinion. I can be wrong...I am undoubtedly going to be wrong again, but what I would like to suggest is that we wait for answers from the police before we make assumptions, and that we speak calmly, truthfully and openly to all Canadians." ...|$|E

They carried news that it was good and right to be scratched with ghost-knives; that Jan Chinn was indeed reincarnated as a god of free food and drink, and that of all nations the Satpura Bhils stood first in his favour, if they would only refrain from scratching.

6000|$|I {{have kept}} {{to the plan}} sketched out by Mr. Croker. [...] "A commentary," [...] says Johnson, [...] "must arise from the fortuitous discoveries of many men in devious walks of literature," [...] and few poets have had more {{commentators}} than Pope. I have borrowed whatever I met with in previous writers that throw light upon his meaning, faults, and beauties, have cast aside what was plainly inapplicable and erroneous, and have done what I could to fill up deficiencies. My own notes will be recognised {{by the absence of}} any signature; all other notes throughout the work have the names of their authors attached, even when a note is by the same author as the text. The extracts from Warton are sometimes taken from his Essay, and both in his case and that of Bowles I have occasionally joined together scattered fragments which were <b>connected</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> subject. The rest of the arrangements will be understood at a glance.|$|E
60|$|One of {{the most}} common causes of {{difficulty}} in pursuing mathematical studies, or studies of any kind, where the succeeding lessons depend upon those which precede, {{is the fact that the}} pupil, though he may understand what precedes, is not familiar with it. This is very strikingly the case with Geometry. The class study the definitions, and the teacher supposes they fully understand them; in fact, they do understand them, but the name and the thing are so feebly <b>connected</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> minds, that a direct effort, and a short pause, are necessary to recall the idea, when they hear or see the word. When they come on therefore to the demonstrations, which, in themselves, would be difficult enough, they have double duty to perform. The words used do not readily suggest the idea, and the connexion of the ideas requires careful study. Under this double burden, many a young geometrician sinks discouraged.|$|E

60|$|It was {{no wonder}} that they thus {{questioned}} one another's actual and bodily existence, and even doubted of their own. So strangely did they meet in the dim wood {{that it was like}} the first encounter in the world beyond the grave of two spirits who had been intimately <b>connected</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> former life, but now stood coldly shuddering in mutual dread, as not yet familiar with their state, nor wonted to the companionship of disembodied beings. Each a ghost, and awe-stricken at the other ghost. They were awe-stricken likewise at themselves, because the crisis flung back to them their consciousness, and revealed to each heart its history and experience, as life never does, except at such breathless epochs. The soul beheld its features in the mirror of the passing moment. It was with fear, and tremulously, and, as it were, by a slow, reluctant necessity, that Arthur Dimmesdale put forth his hand, chill as death, and touched the chill hand of Hester Prynne. The grasp, cold as it was, took away what was dreariest in the interview. They now felt themselves, at least, inhabitants of the same sphere.|$|E
60|$|The {{moon was}} shining when we {{approached}} Pisa, {{and for a}} long time we could see, behind the wall, the leaning Tower, all awry in the uncertain light; the shadowy original of the old pictures in school-books, setting forth 'The Wonders of the World.' Like most things <b>connected</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> first associations with school-books and school-times, it was too small. I felt it keenly. It was nothing like so high above the wall as I had hoped. It was another of the many deceptions practised by Mr. Harris, Bookseller, at the corner of St. Paul's Churchyard, London. HIS Tower was a fiction, but this was a reality--and, by comparison, a short reality. Still, it looked very well, and very strange, and was quite as much out of the perpendicular as Harris had represented it to be. The quiet air of Pisa too; the big guard-house at the gate, with only two little soldiers in it; the streets with scarcely any show of people in them; and the Arno, flowing quaintly through the centre of the town; were excellent. So, I bore no malice in my heart against Mr. Harris (remembering his good intentions), but forgave him before dinner, and went out, full of confidence, to see the Tower next morning.|$|E
60|$|The American {{universities}} are closely <b>connected</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> development {{with the appearance}} and growing class-consciousness of this aristocracy of wealth. The fathers of the country certainly did postulate a need of universities, and in every state Congress set aside public lands to furnish a university with material resources. Every State possesses a university, though in many instances these institutions are in the last degree of feebleness. In the days of sincere democracy the starvation of government and the dislike of all manifest inequalities involved the starvation of higher education. Moreover, the entirely artificial nature of the State boundaries, representing no necessary cleavages and traversed haphazard by the lines of communication, made some of these State foundations unnecessary and others inadequate to a convergent demand. From the very beginning, {{side by side with}} the State universities, were the universities founded by benefactors; and with the evolution of new centres of population, new and extremely generous plutocratic endowments appeared. The dominant universities of America to-day, the treasure houses of intellectual prestige, are almost all of them of plutocratic origin, and even in the State universities, if new resources are wanted to found new chairs, to supply funds for research or publication or what not, it is to the more State-conscious wealthy and not to the State legislature that the appeal is made almost as a matter of course. The common voter, the small individualist has less constructive imagination--is more individualistic, that is, than the big individualist.|$|E

50|$|It is {{important}} to point out that the Scythians did not leave behind any written documentation. Presumably, they did not have a written language in this sense, but their Greek, Persian, Assyrian and Phoenician neighbours did, and indeed left us clear information on their history and culture. Their migrations were sometimes rapidly undertaken and took them long distances from their previous site, on which basis it is not surprising that the primitive documents, acceptable or not, make references to the Scots in Ireland (people <b>connected</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> pilgrimage with Thracians, Greeks, Spaniards and other people).

50|$|A key {{component}} of language is its arbitrariness and what a word can represent, as a word is a sound created by humans with attached meaning to said sound. No one can determine {{the meaning of a}} word purely by how it sounds. However, in onomatopoeic words these sounds are much less arbitrary; they are <b>connected</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> imitation of other objects or sounds in nature. Vocal sounds in the imitation of natural sounds doesn‚Äôt necessarily gain meaning, but can gain symbolic meaning. An example of this sound symbolism in the English language is the use of words starting with sn-. Some of these words symbolize concepts related to the nose (sneeze, snot, snore). This does not mean that all words with that sound relate to the nose, but at some level we recognize a sort of symbolism associated with the sound itself. Onomatopoeia, while a facet of language, is also in a sense outside of the confines of language.|$|E
5000|$|Neither the trilogy's title Achilleis nor the {{grouping}} of the plays is explicitly attested from antiquity, but {{the existence of}} a unified trilogy with Achilles as its focus has long been accepted by modern scholars. In his commentary on the The Libation Bearers, Garvie states that it is [...] "highly likely that Aeschylus often, though not always (of the surviving plays Persae is an almost certain exception) composed trilogies consisting of tragedies <b>connected</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> subject matter." [...] In addition to the Oresteia (to which 'The Libation Bearers' belongs), the Seven Against Thebes and Suppliants formed part of connected trilogies, as did the lost plays that make up the Lycurgeia.The satyr plays that accompanied these examples had plots related to those of the tragedies, and {{it has been suggested that}} the Achilleis might also have been followed by a comedic play related to its dramatic content, but there is no evidence as to what the subject of this satyr play might have been.|$|E
5000|$|Throughout {{this period}} {{they appear to}} have been much more closely <b>connected</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> {{political}} relations with their neighbours the Marrucini, Peligni, and Vestini, than with their Samnite kinsmen: hence, probably, it is that Polybius, in enumerating the forces of the Italian allies, classes the Frentani with the Marsi, Marrucini, and Vestini, while he reckons the Samnites separately. (Pol. ii. 24.) Notwithstanding their vaunted fidelity, the Frentani joined in the general outbreak of the Italian allies in the great Social War, 90 BC: they do not, however, appear to have taken any prominent part, and we can only infer that they received the Roman franchise {{at the same time as}} the neighbouring tribes. Hence they are mentioned by Cicero, a few years later, as sending some of their chief men [...] to support the cause of Cluentius, a native of Larinum. Their territory was traversed without resistance by Julius Caesar at the outbreak of the Civil War, 49 BC, and this is the last occasion on which their name appears in history. Their territory was formed into the fourth region of Augustus, together with that of the Marrucini, Peligni, Marsi, etc.; but at a later period it appears to have been reunited with Samnium, and was placed under the authority of the governor of that province.|$|E
