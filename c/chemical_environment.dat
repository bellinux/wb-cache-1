25|$|A Mössbauer {{spectrometer}} is {{a device}} that performs Mössbauer spectroscopy, or {{a device that}} uses the Mössbauer effect to determine the <b>chemical</b> <b>environment</b> of Mössbauer nuclei present in the sample. It is formed by three main parts; a source that moves {{back and forth to}} generate a Doppler effect, a collimator that filters out non-parallel gamma rays and a detector.|$|E
25|$|Among the {{drawbacks}} {{of the technique}} are {{the limited number of}} gamma ray sources and the requirement that samples be solid in order to eliminate the recoil of the nucleus. Mössbauer spectroscopy is unique in its sensitivity to subtle changes in the <b>chemical</b> <b>environment</b> of the nucleus including oxidation state changes, the effect of different ligands on a particular atom, and the magnetic environment of the sample.|$|E
25|$|As it {{is usually}} calculated, {{electronegativity}} is not a property of an atom alone, but rather a property of an atom in a molecule.

40|$|Neural network; Limestone Abstract: In this paper, the {{experimental}} {{study on the}} mechanical property of limestone under triaxial compression with different hydrochemical environments is conducted and the non-linear characteristics of complete stress-strain process of limestone subjected to chemical corrosion, are analyzed. The behaviors of deformation and strength of limestone eroded by different chemical solutions are obtained. It is known from {{the experimental}} and analytical results that different <b>chemical</b> <b>environments</b> such as <b>chemical</b> composition, pH value etc can affect the mechanical property of rock differently. How to establish a multifactor characteristic constitutive model which can reflect different <b>chemical</b> <b>environments</b> is the key problem to study the coupling corrosion effect of stress and chemistry of rock. The constitutive model of evolutionary neural network for rock under <b>chemical</b> corrosive <b>environments</b> is put forward, and the neural network constitutive relationship under stress-chemistry coupling corrosion is established by applying the theory of evolutionary computation and neural network. The neural network constitutive model established in this presented paper mainly {{takes into account the}} following three aspects: <b>chemical</b> <b>environments</b> of rock specimens, content of main mineral compositions that are liable to being eroded by chemical solution, and mechanical environments. The results are in good agreement with the experimental data. 1...|$|R

25|$|Most {{classical}} force fields implicitly {{include the}} effect of polarizability, e.g., by scaling up the partial charges obtained from quantum chemical calculations. These partial charges are stationary {{with respect to the}} mass of the atom. But molecular dynamics simulations can explicitly model polarizability with the introduction of induced dipoles through different methods, such as Drude particles or fluctuating charges. This allows for a dynamic redistribution of charge between atoms which responds to the local <b>chemical</b> <b>environment.</b>|$|E
25|$|In the {{resulting}} spectra, gamma ray intensity is plotted {{as a function}} of the source velocity. At velocities corresponding to the resonant energy levels of the sample, a fraction of the gamma rays are absorbed, resulting in a drop in the measured intensity and a corresponding dip in the spectrum. The number, positions, and intensities of the dips (also called peaks; dips in transmitted intensity are peaks in absorbance) provide information about the <b>chemical</b> <b>environment</b> of the absorbing nuclei and can be used to characterize the sample.|$|E
25|$|By {{studying}} {{the peaks of}} nuclear magnetic resonance spectra, chemists can determine the structure of many compounds. It {{can be a very}} selective technique, distinguishing among many atoms within a molecule or collection of molecules of the same type but which differ only in terms of their local <b>chemical</b> <b>environment.</b> NMR spectroscopy is used to unambiguously identify known and novel compounds, and as such, is usually required by scientific journals for identity confirmation of synthesized new compounds. See the articles on carbon-13 NMR and proton NMR for detailed discussions.|$|E
25|$|If the {{emitting}} and absorbing nuclei were in identical <b>chemical</b> <b>environments,</b> {{the nuclear}} transition energies would be exactly equal and resonant absorption would be observed with both materials at rest. The difference in <b>chemical</b> <b>environments,</b> however, causes the nuclear energy levels to shift {{in a few}} different ways, as described below. Although these energy shifts are tiny (often less than a micro-electronvolt), the extremely narrow spectral linewidths of gamma rays for some radionuclides make the small energy shifts correspond to large changes in absorbance. To bring the two nuclei back into resonance {{it is necessary to}} change the energy of the gamma ray slightly, and in practice this is always done using the Doppler effect.|$|R

25|$|Digestive systems {{take many}} forms. There is a {{fundamental}} distinction between internal and external digestion. External digestion developed earlier in evolutionary history, and most fungi still rely on it. In this process, enzymes are secreted into the environment surrounding the organism, where they break down an organic material, {{and some of the}} products diffuse back to the organism. Animals have a tube (gastrointestinal tract) in which internal digestion occurs, which is more efficient because more of the broken down products can be captured, and the internal <b>chemical</b> <b>environment</b> can be more efficiently controlled.|$|E

Following the catalytic reaction, almost all Sb ions revert from the +5 to the +3 oxidation state. A significant change in the <b>chemical</b> <b>environment</b> surrounding the antimony nucleus occurs during the oxidation state change which can easily be monitored as an isomer shift in the Mössbauer spectrum.|$|E

However, they are {{computationally}} expensive, while the MM (classical or molecular mechanics) methods are fast but suffer from several limits (require extensive parameterization; energy estimates obtained {{are not very}} accurate; cannot be used to simulate reactions where covalent bonds are broken/formed; and are limited in their abilities for providing accurate details regarding the <b>chemical</b> <b>environment).</b> A new class of method has emerged that combines the good points of QM (accuracy) and MM (speed) calculations.

When the cement paste is exposed to the air and meteoric water reacts with the atmospheric CO2, portlandite and the calcium silicate hydrate (CSH) of the hardened cement paste become progressively carbonated and the high pH gradually decreases from 13.5 – 12.5 to 8.5, the pH of water in equilibrium with calcite (calcium carbonate) and the steel is no longer passivated.|$|E

25|$|The bog <b>chemical</b> <b>environment</b> {{involves}} a completely saturated acidic environment, where considerable concentrations of organic acids and aldehydes are present. Layers of sphagnum and peat assist in preserving the cadavers by enveloping the tissue {{in a cold}} immobilizing matrix, impeding water circulation and any oxygenation. An additional feature of anaerobic preservation by acidic bogs {{is the ability to}} conserve hair, clothing and leather items. Modern experimenters have been able to mimic bog conditions in the laboratory and successfully demonstrate the preservation process, albeit over shorter time frames than the 2,500 years that Haraldskær Woman's body has survived. Most of the bog bodies discovered showed some aspects of decay or else were not properly conserved. When such specimens are exposed to the normal atmosphere, they may begin to decompose rapidly. As a result, many specimens have been effectively destroyed. As of 1979, the number of specimens that have been preserved following discovery was 53.|$|E
25|$|Sugarbeet root aphid stem mothers induce gall {{formation}} in the leaf by probing the leaf tissue with their stylets. This leads {{to the formation of}} a small depression on the leaf, which eventually closes up over the stem mother and forms a gall. The extent of the probing activity dictates gall size, and removing the stem mother early on in the process leads to the formation of an unclosed, rudimentary gall. The extent of probing activity is correlated with the aphid's reproductive success. The probing activity may also serve a secondary purpose in helping the aphid determine leaf size. Leaf size {{is an important factor in}} determining what leaf a stem mother chooses to develop a gall on, but at the time of leaf colonization, leaves that are being colonized are only a tenth to a quarter of their mature size. It has been suggested that, during the probing of the leaf, the stem mother gauges the <b>chemical</b> <b>environment</b> of the leaf and uses that as a predictor of final leaf size and suitability as a gall site. Aphids possess chemosensory organs, allowing them to respond to a variety of stimuli from the plant, both those of the volatile variety (olfaction) and non-volatile variety (taste). Once the aphid is on a plant, it tests the surface of plant with its antennae and probes the plant with its mouth parts. The antennae contain many sensilla, allowing them to sense tactile and chemical stimuli.|$|E
