40|$|<b>Carrier</b> <b>sense</b> is a {{fundamental}} part of most wireless networking stacks in wireless local area- and sensor networks. As increasing numbers of users and more demanding applications push wireless networks to their capacity limits, {{the efficacy of the}} <b>carrier</b> <b>sense</b> mechanism becomes a key factor in determining wireless network capacity. We describe how <b>carrier</b> <b>sense</b> works, point out its limitations, and advocate an experimental approach to studying <b>carrier</b> <b>sense.</b> We describe our current testbed setup, and then present preliminary experimental results from both a 60 -node sensor network deployment and a small-scale 802. 11 deployment.

40|$|The {{transmit}} {{power and the}} <b>carrier</b> <b>sense</b> threshold are two major MAC/PHY parameters in CSMA/CA wireless networks. The problem of {{transmit power}} control has been extensively studied {{in the context of}} graph-theoretic topology control and maintenance. What has not been studied in depth is the effect of signal to interference plus noise ratio (SINR) on the topology and the network capacity sustained under the physical model. In order to remedy the deficiency of conventional topology control (as a result of neglecting the physical SINR effect) and to further improve network performance, we present a joint control framework for determining the transmit power control and the <b>carrier</b> <b>sense</b> threshold. We identify that the joint control problem can be decoupled into two sub-problems: conventional topology control and dynamic control of <b>carrier</b> <b>sense</b> threshold. We then derive a desirable operating condition for the <b>carrier</b> <b>sense</b> threshold. We show that there exists an abrupt increase in the collision probability as the <b>carrier</b> <b>sense</b> threshold increases, and that this transition can be efficiently identified by observing the collision probability. Thus, to maximize the node throughput, each node may increase the <b>carrier</b> <b>sense</b> threshold as long as the collision probability is below a reasonable threshold. Based on the insight shed from our analysis, we devise a dynamic tuning algorithm for <b>carrier</b> <b>sense</b> thresholds, by which each node observes its local event (i. e., transmission collisions) and drives its <b>carrier</b> <b>sense</b> threshold towards the desirable operating point in a fully distributed manner. To demonstrate the utility of the proposed joint control framework, we equip a localized topology control algorithm, localized minimal spanning tree (LMST), with the capability of dynamic <b>carrier</b> <b>sense</b> adaptation (DCSA). Via simulation, we show that joint control of transmit power and <b>carrier</b> <b>sense</b> threshold is crucial for improving the network performance and that the resulting control algorithm LMST-DCSA significantly outperforms LMST alone...|$|R

40|$|Abstract ⎯ Every station within <b>carrier</b> <b>sense</b> zone {{must keep}} quiet {{till the end}} of {{transmission}} which originates that <b>carrier</b> <b>sense</b> zone. We observe futile transmission attempts into this <b>carrier</b> <b>sense</b> zone. With thorough understanding of transmission zone, <b>carrier</b> <b>sense</b> zone, interference zone and corruption zone through equations we derive, we propose alternative attempts which effectively remove inefficiency in the multi-hop WMNs (Wireless Mesh Networks). We show the gain of alternative attempts with analytic approaches and prove the performance improvement with extensive simulations.

The traffic load and <b>carrier</b> <b>sense</b> range also affect throughput.

40|$|Abstract — In this paper, we extend both Bianchi’s and Kumar’s {{models and}} {{characterize}} the channel activities governed by IEEE 802. 11 DCF in multi-hop wireless networks {{from the perspective}} of an individual sender. In particular, we incorporate the effect of PHY/MAC attributes (such as transmit power and physical <b>carrier</b> <b>sense)</b> that need not be considered in WLANs but become extraordinarily important in multi-hop wireless networks, and derive the throughput attained by each sender. With the use of the analytical model derived, we investigate the impact of transmit power and <b>carrier</b> <b>sense</b> threshold on network capacity, and identify a simple operating condition under which the network may attain throughput that is close to its optimal value. Based on the insight shed from the analytical model, we then propose a distributed and localized algorithm, called Local Minimum Spanning Tree with <b>Carrier</b> <b>Sense</b> Adjustment (LMST-CSA) that determines both the transmit power and the <b>carrier</b> <b>sense</b> threshold of a node. We evaluate LMST-CSA via J-Sim simulation [1]. Simulation results show that LMST-CSA achieves higher throughput as compared to conventional IEEE 802. 11 DCF, LMST with no <b>carrier</b> <b>sense</b> adjustment, and LMST with static <b>carrier</b> <b>sense</b> adjustment.

If no collision detection is available, then a node cannot distinguish between silence or receiving {{more than one}} message at a time. Should collision detection be available, then a node may detect more than one incoming message at the same time, even though the messages itself cannot be decoded in that case.

50|$|This system {{breaks down}} when two {{computers}} attempt to transmit {{at the same}} time. This {{is a case of}} collision. To avoid collision, <b>carrier</b> <b>sensing</b> mechanism is used. Here each computer listens to the network before attempting to transmit. If the network is busy, it waits until network quiets down. In carrier detection, computers continue to listen to the network as they transmit. If computer detects another signal that interferes with the signal it is sending, it stops transmitting. Both computers then wait for random amount of time and attempt to transmit. Contention methods are most popular media access control method on LANs.|$|E
50|$|Although CSMA/CA {{has been}} used in a variety of wired {{communication}} systems, it is particularly beneficial in a wireless LAN due to a common problem of multiple stations being able to see the Access Point, but not each other. This is due to differences in transmit power, and receive sensitivity, as well as distance, and location with respect to the AP. This will cause a station to not be able to 'hear' another station's broadcast. This is the so-called 'hidden node', or 'hidden station' problem. Devices utilizing 802.11 based standards can enjoy the benefits of collision avoidance (RTS / CTS handshake, also Point coordination function), although they do not do so by default. By default they use a <b>Carrier</b> <b>sensing</b> mechanism called 'exponential backoff', or (Distributed coordination function) that relies upon a station attempting to 'listen' for another station's broadcast before sending. CA, or PCF relies upon the AP (or the 'receiver' for Ad hoc networks) granting a station the exclusive right to transmit for a given period of time after requesting it (Request to Send / Clear to Send).|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{behavior}} of selfish users, {{which does not}} respect the backoff procedure of IEEE 802. 11 WLAN, has been nicely studied in game-theoretic frameworks. However, in these studies, the effect of physical <b>carrier</b> <b>sense</b> has not been properly incorporated into the analysis. In this paper, we study {{the problem of how}} <b>carrier</b> <b>sense</b> misbehavior can affect network performance in addition to backoff misbehavior. Our analysis shows that a cheater can increase its throughput by ignoring the <b>carrier</b> <b>sense</b> mechanism while a well-behaved user significantly loses its throughput. Consequently, not only a malicious user, but also a selfish one is motivated to disregard the <b>carrier</b> <b>sense</b> mechanism, which will result in significant throughput degradation of well-behaved ones. Our analysis also shows that <b>carrier</b> <b>sense</b> misbehavior corresponds to the case of virtually increasing the channel access probability of the cheater in the backoff procedure. We provide our preliminary simulation results, which verify our analysis...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — The {{aggregate}} throughput of {{a wireless}} ad hoc network {{depends on the}} channel capacity, channel utilization (i. e., the fraction of channel capacity used for generating goodput), and the concurrent transmissions allowed in the network. While channel utilization is determined by MAC overhead, physical <b>carrier</b> <b>sense</b> {{has been used as}} an effective way to avoid interference and exploit spatial reuse. Prior research has attempted to identify the optimal <b>carrier</b> <b>sense</b> range that can maximize the aggregate throughput. However, the impact of MAC overhead has been ignored. In this paper, we use both an analytical model and simulation results to show that MAC overhead has significant impact on the choice of optimal <b>carrier</b> <b>sense</b> range. If MAC overhead is not taken into account properly in determining the optimal <b>carrier</b> <b>sense</b> range, the aggregate throughput can suffer a significant loss. I...|$|R
40|$|<b>Carrier</b> <b>sense</b> {{is often}} used to {{regulate}} concurrency in wireless medium access control (MAC) protocols, balancing interference protection and spatial reuse. <b>Carrier</b> <b>sense</b> is known to be imperfect, and many improved techniques have been proposed.

Analysis using the model shows that <b>carrier</b> <b>sense</b> performance is surprisingly close to optimal for radios with adaptive bitrate. The model suggests that hidden and exposed terminals usually cause modest reductions in throughput rather than dramatic decreases. Finally, it is possible to choose a fixed sense threshold which performs well across a wide range of scenarios, in large part due {{to the role of the}} noise floor. Experimental results from an indoor 802. 11 testbed support these claims...|$|R

Therefore there is an abrupt change in the aggregate throughput when the separation equals the <b>carrier</b> <b>sensing</b> range.

40|$|Abstract—In the {{majority}} of studies on CSMA wireless net-works, a contention graph is used to model the <b>carrier</b> <b>sensing</b> relationships among links. This is a 0 - 1 model in which two links can either sense each other completely or not. In real experiments, we observed that this is generally not the case: the <b>carrier</b> <b>sensing</b> relationship between the links are often probabilistic and can vary dynamically over time. This is the case even if {{the distance between the}} links is fixed and there is no drastic change in the environment. Furthermore, this “partial <b>carrier</b> <b>sensing</b> ” relationship is prevalent and occurs over a wide range of distances between the links. This observation is not consistent with the 0 - 1 contention graph and implies that many results and conclusions drawn from previous theoretical studies need to be re-examined. This paper establishes a more accurate <b>carrier</b> <b>sensing</b> model with the objective of laying down a foundation for future theoretical studies that reflect reality. Towards that end, we set up detailed experiments to investigate the partial <b>carrier</b> <b>sensing</b> phenomenon.
