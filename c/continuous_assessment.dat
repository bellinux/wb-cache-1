25|$|Colonel Henry Hildyard became Staff College Commandant in August 1893, {{beginning}} a {{reform of the}} institution, placing more emphasis on <b>continuous</b> <b>assessment</b> (including outdoor exercises) rather than examinations. Wilson also studied under Colonel George Henderson, who encouraged students to think about military history by asking {{what they would have}} done in the place of the commanders. Whilst at the College he visited the battlefields of the Franco-Prussian War in March 1893. Rawlinson and Thomas D'Oyly Snow were often his study partners (Aylmer Haldane also claimed the same in his 1948 autobiography, but this is not corroborated by Wilson’s diary). Launcelot Kiggell was in the year below. Rawlinson and Wilson became close friends, often staying and socialising together, and Rawlinson introduced Wilson to Lord Roberts in May 1893, whilst both men were working on a scheme for the defence of India. Wilson became a protégé of Roberts.|$|E

40|$|AbstractObjectiveThe {{purpose of}} this study was to improve the {{surgical}} treatment of epilepsy by maximising seizure control while protecting language function. MethodsA combined process of extra-operative electrical cortical stimulation (ECS) mapping, direct ECS and intra-operative <b>continuous</b> language <b>assessment</b> was performed during complicated operative cases. Of the 24 epilepsy patients, nine had a complex relationship between the seizure onset zone and the language cortices. The combined process was used in these nine patients. In the other 15 patients, surgical resection was completed based on extra-operative ECS results alone. Evaluations were performed before and after surgery to assess language function and seizure control. ResultsThe intra-operative <b>continuous</b> language <b>assessment</b> provided important information at the time of the resection. Seven extra-operative ECS positive language sites were resected without obvious language deficits in two patients. Resection was interrupted by language disturbances in an area where no extra-operative ECS positive site was identified in one patient. In three other patients, functional boundary was undefined in extra-operative ECS result, epileptogenic cortices were maximally resected during the <b>continuous</b> language <b>assessment.</b> In terms of seizure control, 18 of 24 (75 %) patients reached Engel's class I, including all nine patients who underwent intra-operative <b>continuous</b> language <b>assessment.</b> One patient had minor surgery-related language deficits three months after resection. ConclusionsIntra-operative <b>continuous</b> language <b>assessment</b> proved to be complementary to extra-operative ECS mappings. The combination of ECS mappings and intra-operative <b>continuous</b> language <b>assessment</b> can maximise the resection of epileptogenic cortices and preserve language function in difficult cases involving the language cortex...|$|R

50|$|<b>Continuous</b> <b>Assessment</b> is the {{educational}} policy {{in which students}} are examined continuously {{over most of the}} duration of their education, the results of which are taken into account after leaving school. It is often proposed or used as an alternative to a final examination system.Continuous assessment is used to calculate the marks for every type of work in college viz. test marks, home work, term paper marks, etc. Final marks are always given on the best of all tests basis. <b>Continuous</b> <b>assessment</b> is used to mainly calculate the TGPA and the CGP. <b>Continuous</b> <b>Assessment</b> consists of assessments and evaluations that take place over a period of time. In other words, you will be assessed right through your learning process and not only after the learning process. Through <b>continuous</b> <b>assessment</b> one can track the improvement (if any) of the learner, be able to give more support, guidance, and more opportunities to improve.|$|E
