50|$|Seisin is now {{confined}} to {{possession of the}} freehold, though at one time {{it appears to have}} been used for simple possession without regard to the estate of the possessor. Its importance is considerably less than it was at one time, owing to the old form of conveyance by feoffment with livery <b>of</b> <b>seisin</b> having been superseded by a deed of grant, and the old rule of descent from the person last seised having been abolished in favour of descent from the purchaser. Lord Denning controversially supported the abolition of the concept <b>of</b> <b>seisin,</b> however the common law has since decided to maintain the concept <b>of</b> <b>seisin.</b> At one time the right of the wife to dower and of the husband to an estate by curtesy depended upon the doctrine <b>of</b> <b>seisin.</b> The Dower Act (1833-1834), however, rendered the fact <b>of</b> the <b>seisin</b> <b>of</b> the husband of no importance, and the Married Women's Property Act 1882 practically abolished the old law of curtesy.|$|R

5000|$|The {{conveyance}} or {{delivery of}} possession, known as livery <b>of</b> <b>seisin</b> was effected generally {{on the site}} of the land in a symbolic ceremony of transfer from the feoffor to the feoffee in the presence of witnesses.

50|$|Mr Nicolson claimed {{possession}} of the island, and other lands, these having originally been 'acquired from the family of Mowat Keith' and by right <b>of</b> <b>seisin</b> in 1739.

5000|$|The lease {{and release}} was:"developed as another {{strategy}} to avoid public transfer <b>of</b> <b>seisin,</b> {{in response to the}} limitations imposed by the Statute of Enrolments. Since uses (future leases in land) had been limited by the Statute of Uses (and remain subject to disincentives in many jurisdictions), another instrument had to be found. That instrument was the lease for a year (lease for possession) followed on the following day by a release of the property, thus avoiding livery <b>of</b> <b>seisin.</b> The instrument thus consists of two parts: (i) a lease for one year on one day; (ii) a release on the following day. In the lease for a year, the consideration was nominal (usually 5s.) and the term of the lease one year. The release was executed the day after the lease, releasing the property to the 'lessee' in perpetuity; the full purchase price (consideration) is recited in the release; the release recites mentions the lease of the previous day; the release is executed 'according to the statute for converting uses into possession' (the Statute of Uses)." ...|$|R

50|$|According to Covenant {{theology}} God {{makes two}} basic covenants, or agreements, with humans. The first one, the <b>Covenant</b> <b>of</b> Works is {{an agreement that}} bases man's relationship with God on human obedience and morality. The covenant was made with Adam in the Garden of Eden. Adam broke this covenant so God {{replaced it with a}} second more durable covenant—the <b>Covenant</b> <b>of</b> Grace. The <b>Covenant</b> <b>of</b> Grace is an agreement that bases man's relationship with God on God's grace and generosity. The <b>Covenant</b> <b>of</b> Works failed because it was based on human performance. The <b>Covenant</b> <b>of</b> Grace is durable because it is based on God's performance.|$|R

5|$|Covenant {{theology}} is an interpretive framework used by Reformed theologians which was significantly {{developed during the}} seventeenth century. Under this scheme, as articulated by the Assembly, God's dealings with men are {{described in terms of}} two covenants: the <b>covenant</b> <b>of</b> works and <b>covenant</b> <b>of</b> grace. The Westminster Confession was the first major Reformed symbol to explicitly mention the <b>covenant</b> <b>of</b> works (sometimes called the <b>covenant</b> <b>of</b> life), in which God offered Adam eternal life on condition of perfect obedience. In the fall of man, Adam broke the <b>covenant</b> <b>of</b> works by eating of the tree of knowledge of good and evil. To remedy this, God offered salvation apart from human initiative in what was called the <b>covenant</b> <b>of</b> grace. This <b>covenant</b> allowed man to enjoy eternal life despite his inability to obey God's law perfectly. The idea <b>of</b> the <b>covenant</b> <b>of</b> grace was a much more common feature of orthodox Reformed theology. The Westminster divines set these two covenants against each other as the two major ways in which God deals with people.|$|R
50|$|Concepts {{foundational}} {{to covenant}} theology {{can be found}} in the writings of Church Fathers such as Irenaeus and Augustine. Huldrych Zwingli and Johannes Oecolampadius were among the first reformers to speak of God's salvation economy under the categories <b>of</b> a <b>covenant</b> <b>of</b> works and a <b>covenant</b> <b>of</b> grace. John Calvin (Institutes 2:9-11), like Heinrich Bullinger (A Brief Exposition of the One and Eternal Testament or <b>Covenant</b> <b>of</b> God), focused on the continuity <b>of</b> the <b>covenant</b> <b>of</b> grace, but taught the substance of what became classic covenant theology in terms of Law and Gospel. Early post-reformation writings, including Zacharius Ursinus (1534-83) in Commentary on the Heidelberg Catechism (published posthumously, 1591), Caspar Olevianus (1536-87) in Concerning the Substance <b>of</b> the <b>Covenant</b> <b>of</b> Grace between God and the Elect (De substantia foederis gratuiti inter deum et electos, 1585), and Scottish Theologian Robert Rollock (1555-99) in A Treatise of our Effectual Calling (Tractatus de vocatione efficaci, 1597), developed the <b>covenant</b> <b>of</b> works and <b>covenant</b> <b>of</b> grace scheme along the lines of the law-gospel distinction.|$|R

5000|$|Covenant theology, a {{theological}} system within Reformed Christianity, holds that God relates to man primarily through three covenants: the <b>Covenant</b> <b>of</b> Redemption, the <b>Covenant</b> <b>of</b> Works, and the <b>Covenant</b> <b>of</b> Grace. In this theological system a covenant {{may be defined}} as, [...] "an unchangeable, divinely imposed legal agreement between God and man that stipulates the conditions of their relationship." ...|$|R
2500|$|Through the {{influence}} of Karl Barth, many contemporary Reformed theologians have discarded the <b>covenant</b> <b>of</b> works, along with other concepts of federal theology. Barth saw the <b>covenant</b> <b>of</b> works as disconnected from Christ and the gospel, and rejected the idea that God works with people in this way. Instead, Barth argued that God always interacts with people under the <b>covenant</b> <b>of</b> grace, and that the <b>covenant</b> <b>of</b> grace is free of all conditions whatsoever. Barth's theology and that which follows him has been called [...] "monocovenantal" [...] {{as opposed to the}} [...] "bi-covenantal" [...] scheme of classical federal theology. Conservative contemporary Reformed theologians, such as John Murray, have also rejected the idea <b>of</b> <b>covenants</b> based on law rather than grace. Michael Horton, however, has defended the <b>covenant</b> <b>of</b> works as combining principles of law and love.|$|R

50|$|The <b>covenant</b> <b>of</b> works (foedus operum), {{also called}} the <b>covenant</b> <b>of</b> life, {{was made in the}} Garden of Eden between God and Adam who {{represented}} all mankind as a federal head. (Romans 5:12-21) It promised life for perfect and perpetual obedience and death for disobedience. Adam, and all mankind in Adam, broke the covenant, thus standing condemned.

50|$|Overview: Under the <b>Covenant</b> <b>of</b> Works humanity, {{represented}} ultimately in a covenantal sense under Adam beginning {{from the}} Garden of Eden, failed {{to live as}} God intended and stood condemned. But beyond time the <b>Covenant</b> <b>of</b> Redemption was made between the Father and Son, to agree that Christ would live an acceptable substitutionary life on behalf of, and as a covenantal representative for, those who would sin but would trust in Christ as their covenantal substitutionary representative, which bought them into the <b>Covenant</b> <b>of</b> Grace. The <b>Covenant</b> <b>of</b> Grace applies to all who trust Christ for their salvation, regardless of ethnicity, and thus the Covenant covers Jews and Gentiles alike with regard to salvation, sanctification, and resurrection. The <b>Covenant</b> <b>of</b> Grace forms the basis <b>of</b> the later <b>covenants</b> with Noah, Abraham, Moses, David and the New Covenant in Christ.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>covenant</b> <b>of</b> grace {{promises}} {{eternal life}} for all people who have faith in Christ. He also promises the Holy Spirit to the elect to give them willingness and ability to believe. Christ is the substitutionary covenantal representative fulfilling the <b>covenant</b> <b>of</b> works on their behalf, in both the positive requirements of righteousness and its negative penal consequences (commonly described as his active and passive obedience). It is the historical expression <b>of</b> the eternal <b>covenant</b> <b>of</b> redemption. Genesis 3:15, {{with the promise of}} a [...] "seed" [...] of the woman who would crush the serpent's head, is usually identified as the historical inauguration for the <b>covenant</b> <b>of</b> grace.|$|R
50|$|Covenant {{theology}} first sees a <b>covenant</b> <b>of</b> works administered with Adam in the Garden of Eden. Upon Adam's failure, God {{established the}} <b>covenant</b> <b>of</b> grace in the promised seed Genesis 3:15, and shows his redeeming care in clothing Adam and Eve in garments of skin — perhaps picturing {{the first instance}} of animal sacrifice. The specific covenants {{after the fall of}} Adam are seen as administered under the overarching theological <b>covenant</b> <b>of</b> grace.|$|R
5000|$|Having created man in His {{image as}} a free {{creature}} with knowledge, righteousness, and holiness, God entered into a <b>covenant</b> <b>of</b> works whereby the mandate was [...] "do this and live" [...] (Romans 10:5, Galatians 3:12). [...] "Like Adam, they have trespassed the covenant" [...] (Hosea 6:7) is the classic reference to the <b>covenant</b> <b>of</b> works; Hebrews 8:6; 9:15; 12:24 the reference that explains God's work of redemption in the <b>Covenant</b> <b>of</b> Grace.|$|R
50|$|All the {{covenants}} that God makes {{with humans}} after the Fall, (e.g. with Noah, Abraham, Moses, and David) all extend the <b>Covenant</b> <b>of</b> Grace to its logical conclusion in Jesus Christ. In Covenant theology, however, {{there is a}} long-standing understanding that the Mosaic Covenant is also a republication <b>of</b> the <b>Covenant</b> <b>of</b> Works, which required obedience to receive its benefits. The underlying <b>Covenant</b> <b>of</b> Grace extends through the whole Old Testament, which suggests that two covenants are in play throughout the history <b>of</b> Israel. Consequently, <b>Covenant</b> theologians see that the Church, or the people of God, existed in the Old Testament. These {{are the people who}} placed their faith in Christ in advance, and they are saved in the same way Christians are.
