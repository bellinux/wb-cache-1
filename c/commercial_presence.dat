25|$|Past New Hyde Park Road, the {{buildings}} surrounding NY25B become a balanced mix {{of commercial and}} residential structures. Less {{than a quarter of}} a mile from New Hyde Park Road, the road makes a turn eastward, passing to the north of the Hillside Public Library as it curves to the right. After three blocks of homes, a flurry of businesses precede a junction with Marcus Avenue, formerly part of NY25C. The <b>commercial</b> <b>presence</b> continues for two blocks eastward before shifting back to residential structures. The four-lane NY25B, along with a separate, parallel Hillside Avenue South, continue eastward through blocks of primarily homes to Herricks Road, where the composition of structures along NY25B becomes a mix of commercial buildings and residential dwellings once more. Hillside Avenue continues on, entering Williston Park. On the eastern edge of the village, NY25B narrows to two lanes as it crosses the Oyster Bay Branch of the Long Island Rail Road and enters East Williston, where the surroundings shift to residential for the final time.|$|E
500|$|After {{she rose}} to {{prominence}} {{with the success}} of her major-label debut Pies Descalzos (1995), Shakira was introduced to Emilio Estefan, the most important producer in the Hispanic market at the time, by her promoter and longtime friend, Jairo Martínez. Estefan was renowned for launching the careers of various Hispanic singers, such as Enrique Iglesias, Thalía, and his wife Gloria Estefan. He decided to work with Shakira as he identified her potential to strongly break into the US Latin market and expand her <b>commercial</b> <b>presence</b> there. One of Shakira's concerns was having creative autonomy over her music. Before signing their contract, the roles and duties were defined. Estefan would be her manager and her executive producer, but she would be in charge of all the material and arrangements and have approval over the final look of the records. She later stated about her producer, [...] "He had a great respect for me as an artist and trusted me totally on this project". Since then, they started working on Estefan's Crescent Moon Studios in Miami.|$|E
40|$|International {{trade in}} {{services}} has grown, year after year, in importance in the world economy. The trade with services undergoes a more accelerated ascension than the one with goods, but it still holds less than 20 % of the global trade {{partly due to the}} barriers of entrance on the market. However, the foreign direct investments (FDI) in services are superior to those from the manufactory sector because of the growth of the efforts made by the traders in order to establish some <b>commercial</b> <b>presences</b> on the foreign markets.
