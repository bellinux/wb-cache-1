40|$|Conformational {{change of}} calcitonins has been {{examined}} {{by measuring the}} rate of hydrogen/deuterium (H/D) exchange in amino acids. Time dependent m/z shift caused by H/D exchange was monitored by electrospray ionization quadrupole ion trap mass spectrometry (ESI-QIT MS). The rate constants of H/D exchange were calculated from apparent first-order kinetics. The time course of H/D exchange exhibited two phases of faster and slower exchange. The smaller rate constant (k 2) estimated from the slower H/D exchange was correlated with an α-helix content that reflected the folding state. The order of k 2 values obtained for human <b>calcitonin</b> (hCT), <b>porcine</b> <b>calcitonin</b> (pCT), salmon calcitonin (sCT), and elcatonin (ECT) was hCT > pCT ≈ sCT > ECT. Although the amino acid sequence of sCT {{is similar to that}} of ECT, their k 2 values were considerably different. The results suggest that ECT is relatively rigid on the N-terminal side cyclic structure in the folded state. Further, the effect of methionine oxidation on k 2 has been examined. In the oxidized pCT that possesses similar biological activity with the intact pCT, the k 2 values obtained were nearly equal. The k 2 of hCT increased via methionine oxidation, and the biological activity was weakened by oxidation. This suggested that methionine oxidation of hCT produced unfolding in the secondary structure and that oxidative unfolding of hCT led to the loss of biological activity. The results indicate that the H/D exchange rate constant may be used as an informative parameter to elucidate the relationship between the folded state and biological activity of polypeptides like calcitonins with secondary structure...|$|R

The major metabolic effects of calcitonin in Paget's disease included the induction of positive calcium balance of + 50 to + 240 mg/day, reduction in hyperphosphatasia and hydroxyprolinuria of 15 to 60 %, and a deceleration of radiocalcium turnover by 12 to 46 %.

40|$|A calcitonin-responsive {{adenylate cyclase}} {{has been found}} in a cell line of a poorly {{differentiated}} bronchial carcinoma (BEN cells). The cells have previously been shown to secrete an immunoreactive form of calcitonin in culture. Salmon <b>calcitonin</b> (SCT), <b>porcine</b> <b>calcitonin</b> (PCT) and human calcitonin (CT-M) all stimulated adenylate cyclase activity in particulate preparations. CT-M sulphoxide had little effect. The concentrations of the calcitonins required for half the maximum activation of adenylate cyclase were 6 - 8, 18 and 90 nm respectively. SCT (30 pm) and CT-M (60 pm) increased the intracellular concentration of cyclic AMP from 11 - 2 +/- 0 - 2 (s. e.) to 18 - 2 +/- 0 - 2 and 16 - 7 +/- 0 - 2 respectively over a 2 - 5 -min period. SCT (labelled with 125 I) bound to particulate preparations of Ben cells, and competition for binding occurred with unlabelled SCT and CT-M. The concentration of SCT required for half the maximum inhibition of [125 I]SCT binding was 11 nm. CT-M sulphoxide inhibited only at high concentration (3 micron). The characteristics of the adenylate cyclase response to SCT did not change over the period between cell adhesion (after subculture) and confluence. However, pre-incubation of cells for 4 h with SCT (150 nm) abolished the subsequent adenylate cyclase response of particulate preparations to further hormone. The practical difficulties encountered in purifying and quantifying the large-mol. -wt. form of CT-M secreted by BEN cells has precluded direct investigation of the potential relationship between hormone secretion and the occurrence of the calcitonin receptor.

A girl aged one year was followed for two years while receiving intermittent treatment with <b>porcine</b> <b>calcitonin.</b> This induced a clinical remission, a reduction ofboth the high serum level of alkaline phosphatase and the raised urinary excretion ofhydroxyproline, and a remarkable improvement in bone structure as seen radiologically. Her sister aged two months received <b>porcine</b> <b>calcitonin</b> for three weeks, during which clinical improvement, {{no change in the}} serum level of alkaline phosphatase and a marked decrease of the excretion of hydroxyproline were recorded. A rare disorder of bone in childhood has been reported in the literature under different names.

The duration of the action was 20 min (10 MRC U/kg) to 30 min (30 and 60 MRC U/kg) by the pressure method. Morphine produced analgesia which lasted for 10 min (0. 3 μg/kg) to 60 min (3 and 30 μg/kg) by the pressure method. Intravenous or successive subcutaneous application of calcitonin, on the other hand, elicited no analgesic action in doses between 1 and 100 MRC U/kg. Behavioral pain responses to electrical stimulation of the tooth pulp of rabbits were suppressed dose-dependently by i. c. v. calcitonin of 8 and 17 MRC U/kg, but not by intravenous injection of 7. 5 to 50 MRC U/kg. The duration of the action of i. c. v. calcitonin was over 90 min by this method. Morphine produced analgesia lasting for 60 min (12 μg/kg i. c. v.) to over 90 min (1 and 2 mg/kg i. v.).

The presence of endopeptidase- 24. 11 was confirmed immunochemically by immunofluorescent staining and by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The inclusion of phosphoramidon partially inhibited the hydrolysis of human calcitonin by a membrane fraction prepared from osteoblast-like cell membranes, thus implicating endopeptidase- 24. 11 in its inactivation.

Each of these compounds were tested in three or four dogs. The effect of an increase in Ca++ from the control level of 1. 5 mmol/liter to 2. 25, 3. 0, and 4. 5 mmol/liter was tested in random order in five thyroid lobes. All three doses elicited an immediate increase in effluent somatostatin-like immunoreactivity. In most experiments the response was biphasic with an early spike, followed by a stable level that was maintained during prolonged Ca++ infusion. The secretory response was not diminished through a series of repeated short pulses of calcium infusion. The response to 3. 0 mmol/liter Ca++ (control period 8. 4 +/- 1. 5, test period 337 +/- 110 pg/ml, mean +/- SE) and 4. 5 mmol/liter Ca++ (control period 9. 5 +/- 1. 4, test period 386 +/- 125) were significantly higher than 2. 25 mmol/liter Ca++ (control period 7. 2 +/- 1. 0 test period 140 +/- 39), while {{there was no significant difference}} between responses to the two high doses.

In cells pretreated with CT, elevation of the [Ca 2 +]e concentration resulted in a further increase in [Ca 2 +]i which was concentration-dependent with respect to both the concentration of CT and the increment of [Ca 2 +e. Untransfected cells, cells transfected with vector alone, and CTR-transfected cells not treated with CT, were unresponsive to [Ca 2 +]e. The microsomal Ca 2 +-ATPase inhibitor thapsigargin was able to mimic both the acute [Ca 2 +]i fluxes and responsiveness to [Ca 2 +]e mediated by Cr in these cells. The CT-induced responsiveness to [Ca 2 +]e was neither mimicked by, nor affected by, activators of the cAMP or protein kinase C pathways. Treatment of cells with pertussis toxin influenced neither the primary Ca 2 + fluxes in response to CT or thapsigargin nor the agonist-induced [Ca 2 +]e influx.
