40|$|Pseudomonas aeruginosa {{plasmids}} which cannot replicate in Escherichia coli {{have been}} used to introduce specific modifications into the E. coli chromosome by homologous recombination (2 ̆ 7 gene targeting 2 ̆ 7). The E. coli gene (gpt) encoding guanine-xanthine phosphoribosyltransferase (Gpt) was used for initial targeting studies owing to the availability of a powerful positive selection for loss of the Gpt+ phenotype (6 -thioguanine resistance or 6 TGR or Gpt-). P. aeruginosa plasmids containing selectable markers flanked by gpt sequences were introduced as supercoiled DNA into an E. coli strain which contained a normal gpt locus. Primary cointegration of such plasmids into the E. coli genome results in a gene duplication event which maintains Gpt function; a secondary recombinational event which resolves the cointegrate either reverses the primary event or results in replacement of the original gpt copy with the modified version. A 316 -bp region of homology was sufficient for cointegrate formation, and resolution of the cointegrates through a shorter (92 bp) homologous flank was selectable through loss of Gpt function. The frequency of <b>cointegrate</b> <b>resolution</b> under these conditions was significantly above the spontaneous gpt mutational loss rate...|$|E
40|$|In this study, {{we report}} on the {{transposition}} behavior of the mercury(II) resistance transposons Tn 502 and Tn 512, which are members of the Tn 5053 family. These transposons exhibit targeted and oriented insertion in the par region of plasmid RP 1, since par-encoded components, namely, the ParA resolvase and its cognate res region, are essential for such transposition. Tn 502 and, under some circumstances, Tn 512 can transpose when par is absent, providing evidence for an alternative, par-independent pathway of transposition. We show that the alternative pathway proceeds by a two-step replicative process involving random target selection and orientation of insertion, leading to the formation of cointegrates as the predominant product of the first stage of transposition. Cointegrates remain unresolved because the transposon-encoded (TniR) recombination system is relatively inefficient, as is the host-encoded (RecA) system. In the presence of the res-ParA recom-bination system, TniR-mediated (and RecA-mediated) <b>cointegrate</b> <b>resolution</b> is highly efficient, enabling resolution both of cointegrates involving functional transposons (Tn 502 and Tn 512) and of defective elements (In 0 and In 2). These findings implicate the target-encoded accessory functions in the second stage of trans-position {{as well as in the}} first. We also show that the par-independent pathway enables the formation of deletions in the target molecule. It is widely recognized that mobile genetic elements contribut...|$|E
40|$|A {{new class}} II (Tn 3 -like) transposable element, {{designated}} Tn 5401, was {{recovered from a}} sporulation-deficient variant of Bacillus thuringiensis subsp. morrisoni EG 2158 following its insertion into a recombinant plasmid. Sequence analysis of the insert revealed a 4, 837 -bp transposon with two large open reading frames, in the same orientation, encoding proteins of 36 kDa (306 residues) and 116 kDa (1, 005 residues) and 53 -bp terminal inverted repeats. The deduced amino acid sequence for the 36 -kDa protein shows 24 % sequence identity with the TnpI recombinase of the B. thuringiensis transposon Tn 4430, {{a member of the}} phage integrase family of site-specific recombinases. The deduced amino acid sequence for the 116 -kDa protein shows 42 % sequence identity with the transposase of Tn 3 but only 28 % identity with the TnpA transposase of Tn 4430. Two small open reading frames of unknown function, designated orf 1 (85 residues) and orf 2 (74 residues), were also identified. Southern blot analysis indicated that Tn 5401, in contrast to Tn 4430, is not commonly found among different subspecies of B. thuringiensis and is not typically associated with known insecticidal crystal protein genes. Transposition was studied with B. thuringiensis by using plasmid pEG 922, a temperature-sensitive shuttle vector containing Tn 5401. Tn 5401 transposed to both chromosomal and plasmid target sites but displayed an apparent preference for plasmid sites. Transposition was replicative and resulted in the generation of a 5 -bp duplication at the target site. Transcriptional start sites within Tn 5401 were mapped by primer extension analysis. Two promoters, designated PL and PR, direct the transcription of orf 1 -orf 2 and tnpI-tnpA, respectively, and are negatively regulated by TnpI. Sequence comparison of the promoter regions of Tn 5401 and Tn 4430 suggests that the conserved sequence element ATGTCCRCTAAY mediates TnpI binding and <b>cointegrate</b> <b>resolution.</b> The same element is contained within the 53 -bp terminal inverted repeats, thus accounting for their unusual lengths and suggesting an additional role for TnpI in regulating Tn 5401 transposition...|$|E
40|$|The Escherichia coli F factor mediates {{conjugal}} {{transfer of}} a plasmid such as pBR 322 primarily by replicative transposition of transposon gamma delta (Tn 1000) from F to that plasmid {{to form a}} <b>cointegrate</b> intermediate. Although <b>resolution</b> of this <b>cointegrate</b> always yields a plasmid containing a single gamma delta insertion, the occasional recovery of transposon-free plasmids after conjugal transfer has led to alternative hypotheses for F mobilization.

40|$|Three genes {{involving}} alanine biosynthesis, avtA, alaA, and alaB {{were studied}} in this thesis. avtA, alaA and alaB were localized to 1. 25 kb, 0. 9 kb and 1. 0 kb fragments, respectively, by γδ (Tn 1000) mutagenesis. The transcription direction of alaA and alaB {{were determined by}} alaA::lacZ protein fusion which was constructed using m · Tn 3 insertion and alaB::cam gene fusion which was constructed in vitro. Using detailed Escherichia coli chromosome restriction map, the map positions of avtA, ilvE, tyrB, aspC and alaA were mapped or corrected. ^ A new approach to determining the sequence of cloned DNA is described. Unique regions near each end of γδ provide a pair of 2 ̆ 2 portable 2 ̆ 2 primer-specific sites for bidirectional sequencing by the dideoxy chain termination method. The avtA gene of E. coli K- 12 was sequenced by this approach. Surprisingly, sequences downstream of the coding region which were interrupted by γδ insertions or deletion were found to significantly reduce avtA expression. I suggest that these nondisruptive insertions or deletion probably change the DNA topology and thereby alter gene expression. ^ The pBR 322 -related plasmids that are 2. 3 kb to 5. 1 kb were found predominantly as monomers, while plasmids that are 7. 7 kb to 15. 2 kb were found predominantly as dimers in rec+ cells of E. coli K- 12. Monomer size is not the sole determinant {{of the level of}} oligomerization, the level of oligomerization is physiologically adjusted. For cultures in which the cells contain both monomers and dimers, the equilibrium of plasmid types is found to be intracellular. ^ The E. coli F factor mediates conjugal transfer of a plasmid such as pBR 322 by replicative transposition of γδ from F to the plasmid, to form a <b>cointegrate.</b> Although <b>resolution</b> yields a plasmid containing a single γδ insertion, the occasional recovery of γδ-free plasmids after conjugal transfer has led to alternative hypotheses for F mobilization that do not involve γδ transposition. I show here that γδ-free plasmids are found after F-mediated conjugal transfer only when the starting plasmid is a dimer and the recipient is Rec+. These plasmids arise by homologous recombination in a heterodimer containing only one γδ insert. ...|$|R
40|$|A 1. 3 -kb {{insertion}} sequence, termed ISAfe 1 (U 66426), from Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans ATCC 19859 is described. ISAfe 1 exhibits {{the features}} of a typical bacterial insertion sequence. It has 26 -bp, imperfectly matched, terminal inverted repeats and an open reading frame (ORF) that potentially encodes a transposase (TPase) of 404 amino acids (AAB 07489) with significant similarity {{to members of the}} ISL 3 family of insertion sequences. A potential ribosome-binding site and potential − 10 and − 35 promoter sites for the TPase ORF were identified, and a + 1 transcriptional start site was detected experimentally. A potential outwardly directed − 35 site was identified in the right inverted repeat of ISAfe 1. A second ORF (ORF B), of unknown function, was found on the complementary strand with significant similarity to ORF 2 of ISAe 1 from Ralstonia eutropha. Southern blot analyses demonstrated that ISAfe 1 -like elements can be found in multiple copies in a variety of A. ferrooxidans strains and that they exhibit transposition. A codon adaptation index (CAI) analysis of the TPase of ISAfe 1 indicates that is has a CAI of 0. 726 and can be considered well adapted to its host, suggesting that ISAfe 1 might be an ancient resident of A. ferrooxidans. Analysis of six of its target sites of insertion in the genome of A. ferrooxidans ATCC 19859 indicates a preference for 8 -bp pseudopalindromic sequences, one of which resembles the termini of its inverted repeats. Evidence is presented here that is consistent with the possibility that ISAfe 1 can promote both plasmid <b>cointegrate</b> formation and <b>resolution</b> in E. coli...|$|R
