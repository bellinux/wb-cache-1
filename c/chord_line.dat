25|$|The Edinburgh {{section of}} the Caledonian main line left Carstairs station and ran north-east. For several years {{passenger}} trains from Carlisle divided at Carstairs; the Glasgow portion proceeded, and the Edinburgh portion reversed direction towards the capital. It is likely that goods trains too ran to Carstairs and remarshalled there. A cut-off line was constructed enabling direct running from Carlisle towards Edinburgh, but it was little used and it was soon closed. Later a shorter <b>chord</b> <b>line</b> was built having the same effect.|$|E
60|$|Recurring to {{the idea}} of going to Richmond on the inside track, the {{facility}} of supplying from the side away from the enemy is remarkable, as it were, by the different spokes of a wheel extending from the hub toward the rim, and this whether you move directly by the chord or on the inside arc, hugging the Blue Ridge more closely. The <b>chord</b> <b>line,</b> as you see, carries you by Aldie, Hay Market, and Fredericksburg; and you see how turnpikes, railroads, and finally the Potomac, by Aquia Creek, meet you at all points from WASHINGTON; the same, only the lines lengthened a little, if you press closer to the Blue Ridge part of the way.|$|E

50|$|When {{symmetric}} aerofoils {{are moving}} {{parallel to the}} <b>chord</b> <b>line</b> of the aerofoil, zero lift is generated. However, when cambered aerofoils are moving parallel to the <b>chord</b> <b>line,</b> lift is generated. (See diagram at right.)

5000|$|To ensure track {{geometry}} is corrected most {{tamping machines}} use a 2 <b>chord</b> <b>lining</b> system ( [...] 1 for vertical alignment and 1 for horizontal alignment).

50|$|In aerodynamics, {{angle of}} attack {{specifies}} the angle between the <b>chord</b> <b>line</b> of the wing of a fixed-wing aircraft and the vector representing the relative motion between the aircraft and the atmosphere. Since a wing can have twist, a <b>chord</b> <b>line</b> of the whole wing may not be definable, so an alternate reference line is simply defined. Often, the <b>chord</b> <b>line</b> of {{the root of the}} wing is chosen as the reference line. Another choice is to use a horizontal line on the fuselage as the reference line (and also as the longitudinal axis). Some authors do not use an arbitrary <b>chord</b> <b>line,</b> but use the zero lift axis, whereby zero {{angle of attack}} corresponds to zero coefficient of lift by definition.|$|E

The second part {{is a series of}} very clear and remotely modulating soft leading chords that are written in the oldest copies as [...] "Arpeggio", i.e. they require a spread chord. The third part is entitled Recitative and includes a variety of ornamented, enriched, highly expressive melodies. This part contains several enharmonic equivalents. The recitative finishes with passages that are chromatically sinking diminished seventh chords over above the pedal point on D.|$|R
