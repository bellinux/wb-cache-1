2500|$|The modern {{hand-held}} protractor compass {{always has}} an additional direction-of-travel (DOT) arrow or indicator {{inscribed on the}} baseplate. To check one's progress along a course or azimuth, or {{to ensure that the}} object in view is indeed the destination, a new <b>compass</b> <b>reading</b> may be taken to the target if visible (here, the large mountain). After pointing the DOT arrow on the baseplate at the target, the compass is oriented so that the needle is superimposed over the orienting arrow in the capsule. The resulting bearing indicated is the magnetic bearing to the target. Again, if one is using [...] "true" [...] or map bearings, and the compass does not have preset, pre-adjusted declination, one must additionally add or subtract magnetic declination to convert the magnetic bearing into a true bearing. The exact value of the magnetic declination is place-dependent and varies over time, though declination is frequently given on the map itself or obtainable on-line from various sites. If the hiker has been following the correct path, the compass' corrected (true) indicated bearing should closely correspond to the true bearing previously obtained from the map.|$|E

50|$|The {{standard}} practice when flying with a gyro-stabilized compass (or heading indicator) is to <b>read</b> the magnetic <b>compass</b> only while in straight and level unaccelerated flight. This reading is {{then used to}} set the gyro-stabilized compass. The gyro <b>compass</b> will <b>read</b> correctly in a turn, whereas the magnetic <b>compass</b> can't be <b>read</b> properly while turning. Thus the pilot will always ignore the magnetic compass while turning, but periodically check it in straight and level unaccelerated flight.|$|R

50|$|A bearing is {{the angle}} between the line joining the two points of {{interest}} and the line {{from one of the}} points to the north, such as a ship’s course or a <b>compass</b> <b>reading</b> to a landmark. On nautical charts, the top of the chart is always true north, rather than magnetic north, towards which a compass points. Most charts include a compass rose depicting the variation between magnetic and true north.|$|E
50|$|Compasses on sailboats {{may have}} {{additional}} lubber lines at forty-five {{degrees from the}} centerline. This represents about {{as close to the}} wind as the average boat will sail. These lubber lines may be used when sailing close hauled to see if you are on the closest course to your destination, without having to add or subtract the 45 degrees every few minutes, or recalculate your required heading every time you tack. The main line on the <b>compass</b> <b>reads</b> your current (close-hauled) heading and the leeward lubber line will read the bearing to your destination, regardless of whether you are on port or starboard tack. Lubber lines also help you to see windshifts when racing. If you are sailing close-hauled with good trim and you notice that your bearing to the windward mark starts to drift outside the lubber line (angle becoming greater than 45 degrees) you are being headed, and should consider tacking.|$|R

50|$|Compasses {{are used}} to {{determine}} the direction of true North. However, the <b>compass</b> <b>reading</b> must be corrected for two effects. The first is magnetic declination or variation—the angular difference between magnetic North (the local direction of the Earth's magnetic field) and true North. The second is magnetic deviation—the angular difference between magnetic North and the compass needle due to nearby sources of interference such as magnetically permeable bodies, or other magnetic fields within the field of influence.|$|E
50|$|While {{the compass}} {{is the primary}} {{instrument}} used to determine one's heading, pilots will usually refer instead to the direction indicator (DI), a gyroscopically driven device {{which is much more}} stable than a compass. The <b>compass</b> <b>reading</b> will be used to correct for any drift (precession) of the DI periodically. The compass itself will only show a steady reading when the aircraft has been in straight and level flight long enough to allow it to settle.|$|E
50|$|Despite these advances, faulty instruments, imprecise measurements, {{recording}} errors {{or other}} factors may still {{result in an}} inaccurate survey, and these errors are often difficult to detect. Some cave surveyors measure each station twice, recording a back-sight to the previous station in the opposite direction. A back-sight <b>compass</b> <b>reading</b> that is different by 180 degrees and a clinometer reading {{that is the same}} value but with the reverse direction (positive rather than negative, for example) indicates that the original measurement was accurate.|$|E

5000|$|The {{primary means}} of {{establishing}} the heading in most small aircraft is the magnetic compass, which, however, suffers from several types of errors, including that created by the [...] "dip" [...] or downward slope of the Earth's magnetic field. Dip error causes the magnetic <b>compass</b> to <b>read</b> incorrectly whenever the aircraft is in a bank, or during acceleration or deceleration, {{making it difficult to}} use in any flight condition other than unaccelerated, perfectly straight and level. To remedy this, the pilot will typically manoeuvre the airplane with reference to the heading indicator, as the gyroscopic heading indicator is unaffected by dip and acceleration errors. The pilot will periodically reset the heading indicator to the heading shown on the magnetic compass.|$|R

50|$|The energy {{generation}} forecasting problem is {{closely linked to}} the problem of weather variables forecasting. Indeed, this problem is usually split into two parts, on one hand focusing on the forecasting of solar PV or any other meteorological variable {{and on the other hand}} estimating the amount of energy that a concrete power plant will produce with the estimated meteorological resource.In general, the way to deal with this difficult problem is usually related to the spatial and temporal scales we are interested in, which yields to different approaches that can be found in the literature. In this sense, it is useful to classify these techniques depending on the forecasting horizon, so it is possible to distinguish between now-casting (forecasting 3-4 hours ahead), short-term forecasting (up to 7 days ahead) and long-term forecasting (months, years…)Solar radiation closely follows the physical and biological development of the earth. Its spatial and sequential heterogeneity powerfully influence the forcing of environmental and hydrological organisms by manipulating air temperature, soil moisture and vapor transpiration, snow cover and lots of photochemical procedures. Therefore, solar radiation drives place efficiency and plant life allotment, organism a key feature in undeveloped and forestry sciences that be obliged to be known precisely. The quantity of solar radiation obtainable at the earth’ surface is at the outset controlled at worldwide balance, organism above all precious by the Sun Earth geometry and the atmosphere.

Solar radiation can be also evaluated using numerical weather forecast (NWP) models. Nevertheless, the space and time balance determined with them and the incomplete computational ability frequently avoid the deliberation of terrain connected property.|$|E
50|$|The direct <b>reading</b> <b>compass</b> has {{graduations}} on {{the housing}} which read anti-clockwise round the face, with zero {{on the far}} side.
