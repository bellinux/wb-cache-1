50|$|The {{architectural}} design for Ubiquity 0.1.3 {{was focused on}} separating functions into well-defined objects, an idea borrowed from the design of commands in the Archy project. The browser window functionality was separated into per-window and global objects. The per-window <b>command</b> <b>manager</b> object mediated between the context menu, command entry and natural-language parser objects and the commands themselves. The global objects marshall application-wide services such as built-in command feeds. Efforts to localize Ubiquity into different languages have also been made.|$|E
40|$|Data & Command Handling {{is one of}} {{the main}} tasks of {{satellite}} software. A lot of interpretations exist on how to implement a reliable software module and many of them seem to be very complex and thus not feasible for a nano satellite system. This paper describes the challenge of such a development and goes into detail of particular aspects and limitations. Thereby it focuses on the development and Implementation of a TM/TC software system of the nano satellite AISat. AIsat is a nano satellite project at the DLR institute of space systems and its main objective is the satellite-based support of AIS data processing as well as a demonstration of a 4 meter deployable helix antenna experiment. The satellite is based on the CLAVIS bus platform. CLAVIS was developed by a DLR working group to introduce a modular and flexible bus for the accommodation of different payloads in the nano satellite class. Its main concept is to adopt COTS components for space business to speed up development and lower the costs of access to space. Through its compact but still effective software design, the TM/TC module of CLAVIS tries to answer code size related issues but at the same time to ensure a secure handling through the satellite operator. Mainly the TM/TC software contains a <b>command</b> <b>manager,</b> which is responsible for the validation, Interpretation and distribution of telecommands. Different mechanisms and concepts provide a scheduling of the command execution but also protect it against erroneous command sequences and errors coming through the unreliable RF communications uplink...|$|E

50|$|Under the Kennedy Administration, Secretary McNamara instituted {{powerful}} centralization {{tools in}} acquisition {{such as the}} Total Package Procurement concept (TPP). This system shifted many major program management functions to the Pentagon. Stressing computer modeling, concurrency, and paper competitions among the contractors, TPP sharply curtailed the flexibility of Systems <b>Command</b> program <b>managers.</b> Cost overruns and serious technical difficulties in such TPP programs as the Lockheed C-5 Galaxy and General Dynamics F-111 Aardvark lead to drastic changes in DoD acquisition practices. In 1970, Deputy Secretary of Defense David Packard revised many McNamara policies. He decentralized the acquisition system and reemphasized prototyping in weapons development.|$|R

50|$|How {{words can}} be {{aggregated}} to reflect each reviewer’s recommendation {{as well as}} the expertise of each reviewer about the paper’s subject matter is done using a linguistic weighted average.
