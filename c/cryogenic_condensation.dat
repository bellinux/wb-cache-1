One of the key factors limiting the ability to design such systems is the uncertainty in the accommodation coefficients (evaporation and condensation), which are inputs for kinetic modeling of phase change. A novel, combined experimental and computational approach is being used to determine the accommodation coefficients for liquid hydrogen. The experimental effort utilizes the Neutron Imaging Facility located at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in Gaithersburg, Maryland to image evaporation and condensation of propellants inside of metallic containers. CFD tools are utilized to infer the temperature distribution in the system and determine the appropriate thermal boundary conditions for the numerical solution of the evaporating and condensing liquid to be used in a kinetic phase change model.

40|$|With {{growing concern}} {{of energy and}} {{environmental}} issues, the combination of plasma and heterogeneous catalysts receives special attention in greenhouse gas conversion, nitrogen fixation and hydrocarbon chemistry. Plasma gas conversion driven by renewable electricity is particularly important for the electrification of the chemical industry, which is currently dominated by water electrolysis, producing CO 2 -free renewable hydrogen. Meanwhile, electrochemical conversion of CO 2, CH 4 and other gaseous materials {{has yet to be}} successful because the material and energy conversion efficiency as well as productivity of the electrochemical processes greatly depend on the electrolyte material in terms of the solubility of gaseous materials and mass transport capability, which needs to be dramatically improved. As for fuel processing, the majority of reactions are categorized as uphill (endothermic) reactions where energy input is indispensable due to the conservation of energy. Ideally, such energy should be supplied by low temperature heat while plasma-generated reactive species promote initiation reactions. One promising approach is the use of vibrationally excited molecules which enhance the probability of chemisorption onto the catalyst surfaces. The role of vibrational species has been well investigated through molecular beam studies. However, the way to create such species has not been studied yet. Non-thermal plasma creates an oversaturated amount of vibrational species even at low temperature, showing great promises towards low temperature plasma catalysis of stable molecules. Furthermore, vibrational species uniquely create reaction pathways in homogeneous reactions via stepwise energy transfer gradually populating higher vibrational levels which eventually leads to the dissociation of stable molecules such as CO 2. The special issue entitled “Plasma Conversion” consists of three review articles and 11 original research papers, focusing on the state-of-the-art plasma technology that is used for enhancing homogeneous/heterogeneous plasma catalytic conversion of greenhouse gases, nitrogen fixation and hydrocarbon chemistry. Review articles include the new catalyst synthesis approach using nonthermal plasma processes and the potential application of such unique catalysts is introduced (Rahimpour et al.) [1]. CH 4 and CO 2 reforming is one of the hot topics in plasma catalysis and research has been conducted mostly by experimental approaches. Bogaerts et al. discuss CH 4 reforming and CO 2 splitting and various mixtures from a modeling perspective, paying special attention to plasma chemistry and the role of plasma-generated vibrationally excited molecules [2]. Reactions involving vibrationally excited species need to be explored further and a numerical approach is truly beneficial providing insightful information towards the reaction mechanisms. Liquefaction of CH 4 is to produce higher hydrocarbons via CH 4 polymerization at ambient conditions (not for <b>cryogenic</b> methane <b>condensation)</b> [3]. Carbon containing liquid fuels such as gasoline and diesels produced via renewable electricity improve transportability and storage of renewable energy. Two research papers are related to heterogeneous plasma catalysis of CH 4 and CO 2 where nonthermal plasma is combined with Ni-supported reforming catalysts [4, 5]. Research was conducted experimentally and plasma induced synergistic effects are highlighted. Van Rooij and Bongers discuss the homogeneous CO 2 conversion with warm discharge, or low pressure microwave plasma [6, 7]. Special emphasis on the vibrationally excited CO 2 chemistry and CO 2 dissociation by the latter mechanism is discussed. A novel heterogeneous plasma catalysis approach of CO 2, where nonthermal plasma is combined with an oxygen permeating solid electrolyte membrane, is presented by Mori [8]. O 2 is extracted directly from the plasma reaction field, and thus the CO 2 conversion and energy efficiency were greatly improved. Moreover, CO 2 microwave plasma diagnostics by optical emission spectroscopy [9], diagnostics plasma-catalyst interfacial phenomena [10], and atomistic simulations of plasma catalytic interactions [11] are included in the collection of this special issue. Three other papers focus on ammonia synthesis with atmospheric pressure plasma combined with heterogeneous catalysts [12 – 14]. Finally {{we would like to thank}} all contributors to this special issue and the editorial staff of Plasma Processes and Polymers for their great support. We hope that this issue contributes to exploring the new frontiers of plasma chemistry, and also to promoting the interdisciplinary interaction among the plasma science, chemical catalysis and surface science community, as well as other science specialists...|$|R
40|$|Micro- and meso-porous {{materials}} {{have been widely}} studied for application in catalysis, gas separation, sensors, optics and so on. In semiconductor manufacturing, porous materials are also considered as inter-metal insulators with low dielectric constant (low-k) for ultra-large-scale integration (ULSI) interconnects. Various types of porous materials, including silica, pure polymer and metal organic framework, have been studied for interconnect applications. As critical dimensions scale down, advanced interconnects require low-k dielectrics {{in order to reduce}} power dissipation and resistance-capacitance (RC) signal delay. For porous organosilicate glass (p-OSG) materials, the currently most successful low-k candidate family, the material synthesis is well understood. The precursors, i. e. the silica matrix and the porogen, are co-deposited by plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) or sol-gel method. The porogen is then selectively removed, by annealing or (ultraviolet) UV-cure, to form a meso-porous structure. As such, continuous k value reduction is easily achieved by increasing the porogen/matrix ratio so as to generate higher open porosity. However, a larger porosity is generally accompanied by increased pore size. Highly porous structures lead to a low compatibility with conventional interconnect integration processing, for example, heterogeneous deposition, plasma processing and chemical mechanical planarization (CMP). Among them, low-k degradation by plasma etching and deposition of metal diffusion barrier is the most severe challenge. Plasma induced damage (PID) is mainly due to the penetration of etch radicals, photons and residues into the interconnected pores, resulting in a modified low-k structure and composition deep into the bulk. The loss of organic groups turns the pore sidewalls hydrophilic and subsequent moisture adsorption degrades the dielectric properties and reliability. Likewise, the penetration of metal-based species during physical-vapor or chemical-vapor deposition of the metal diffusion barrier causes issues of barrier continuity, leakage and effective dielectric constant. The ‘effective’ k-values for integrated inter-metal dielectrics are significantly higher than those of pristine materials. The increasing pore size also requires thicker barriers, which have such high resistivity that, for narrow lines, the use of Cu as metal does not allow anymore to reach the target line resistance. As a result, the integration of ultra-porous low-k dielectrics by state-of-the-art damascene technology meets huge challenges and k-value scaling is far below expectation. In order to reduce the PID, many potential solutions have been put forward, including low damage plasma chemistry, post etch low-k repair, and post etch porogen burnout. In the meantime, several pore sealing approaches are proposed for better compatibility with deposition of metal diffusion barrier. However, all those solutions show either insufficient improvement or limited compatibility with the interconnects fabrication processes. This thesis focuses on three emerging integration strategies for advanced interconnects using ultralow-k dielectrics, namely, post porosity pore protection, pore protection by precursor condensation, and replacement low-k approach. Since both plasma damage and barrier penetration issues originate from the porous structures, the densification of porous low-k is {{the most efficient way to}} improve the integration compatibility. Post porosity pore protection (P 4) method is proposed as a solution enabling low damage integration of advanced porous low-k’s. This approach modifies the interconnect processing flow by introducing at an early stage an extrinsic sacrificial filler which suppresses the porosity of the low-k film. Pore protection process flow, including stuffing, etch and un-stuffing, has been extensively investigated in the present work. By optimization of the stuffing process conditions, various polymers can be filled successfully into p-OSG with different porosity and pore size. The penetration of polymers depends on the low-k structure, polymer properties and stuffing conditions. Temporary pore filling impedes the penetration of active radicals and the etch by-products during plasma processing. As a result, the PID is significantly decreased. Pore protection also enables defect-free metallization, which is of ultimate importance for successful integration of porous low-k’s. For this purpose, the sacrificial filler should be maintained during the whole metallization process, including the barrier deposition, Cu filling and chemical mechanical planarization (CMP). Low temperature and oxygen free de-stuffing approaches are required to avoid potential damage to the metallization structures. Pore protection can also be achieved by an alternative strategy relying on low temperature pore filling with condensed precursor reactants. Plasma etch properties of porous organo-silicate materials at cryogenic temperature is studied. The mechanism of plasma damage is investigated by means of in-situ ellipsometry and post-etch material evaluation. Using conventional volatile reactants such as SF 6, it is found that low plasma damage can be achieved below - 120 oC through two main channels: pore sidewall passivation by molecular SF 6 and partial condensation of non-volatile etch by-products. The protection can be enhanced by means of gas phase precursors with low saturated vapor pressure. Using C 4 F 8, complete pore filling is achieved at - 110 °C and negligible plasma-induced damage is demonstrated on both blanket and patterned low-k films. The characteristics of the precursor condensation process are described and discussed in detail, establishing an optimal process window. It is shown that the condensation temperature can be raised by using precursors with even lower vapor pressure. The in-situ densification through precursor condensation could enable damage-free plasma processing of mesoporous media. Compared with the P 4 approach which requires additional stuffing and de-stuffing steps, the process flow using the cryogenic etch process offers a more simple and economic route for damage-free plasma processing of porous low-k materials. Given the increasing difficulty of integrating advanced porous low-k, it makes sense to reconsider the subtractive approach, where the metal structure is defined first, followed by dielectric deposition. In spite of many research efforts on Cu direct etch and gap fill dielectric, there has been limited success in providing satisfactory morphological profile and electrical performance in technology-relevant dimensions. The present work investigates an alternative integration approach based on a “dielectric-last” scheme. The metal structure is first formed by patterning a sacrificial template material. After template removal, porous low-k dielectric is embedded into the spacing between the metal wires. The proposed method eliminates plasma-induced low-k damage, as well as barrier penetration issues. A Liquid Phase Self-Assembly low-k dielectric is used for the gap-filling purpose. By optimizing the spin coating conditions, void free gap-filling structures are achieved. The impact of low-k gap-filling process on the metal structures is investigated. The low-k porogen removal processes can induce formation of Cu 2 O and subsequent Cu migration, leading to detrimental electrical performance. Proper protection of the copper structures and tuning of the low-k curing process are thus adopted. Also, the integration scheme for dual damascene structure is explored. Formation of upper metal layers requires surface planarization on various gap-filling structures, which can be performed by chemical mechanical polishing. The surfactants present in the CMP slurry penetrate into the porous low-k, leading to dielectric degradation. A post cleaning step is therefore needed to remove the slurry residues and restore the k value to pristine level. Using a Meander-Fork integrated vehicle, the inter-metal dielectric properties are evaluated by RC and leakage current measurements. High electrical yield is obtained with integrated porous low-k showing promising effective k-values and breakdown voltages, confirming the promise of this specific integration approach.

40|$|Abstract: Cryosorption pumps {{will provide}} the safe, quiet, clean and {{reasonably}} inexpensive method for evacuation of a vacuum vessel to a pressure of around mbar.

Commercially available cryosorption-pumps are used in for industrial application and operate in the temperature range of 20 - 25 K, since they do not require the pumping of lighter gas molecules like hydrogen, deuterium, argon and helium etc. The adsorption takes place at the porous surfaces. Hence, porous materials are of great importance towards this technology.

Different capture processes have been investigated in the literature, such as absorption, adsorption, chemical looping and membrane separation. In this paper, {{the potential for a}} hybrid process combining membrane and cryogenic separation to achieve efficient post-combustion carbon capture has been investigated through a simulation study. The hybrid process combines a first step CO 2 pre-concentration with a membrane unit and a second step CO 2 <b>cryogenic</b> <b>condensation.</b> The influence of three CO 2 feed contents (5, 15 and 30 %), 3 different compression strategies and two membrane selectivities (alpha CO 2 /N- 2 = 50 and 100) on the separation performances have been investigated for a required CO 2 purity of 0. 9 and a capture ratio larger than 85 %.

40|$|According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Fourth Assessment Report (IPCC AR 4), {{fossil fuels}} are {{utilised}} {{to produce more}} than 80 % of the world's energy and {{this is likely to}} remain unchanged in the nearest future, especially as industrialisation is pursued by such economic giants as China. Without substantial change in energy policies with primary focus on the development of sustainable technologies for power generation, mitigation of associated Green House Gas (GHG) emissions cannot be fully implemented, and will require continual improvement in order to achieve objectives set by the Kyoto protocol. Research and development in the field of Carbon Capture and Sequestration is therefore being thoroughly explored. In this work a new sustainable technology for CO 2 capture from IGCC power stations is developed and discussed in detail. This technology is based on <b>cryogenic</b> <b>condensation</b> integrated with gas hydrate formation. With the massive global reduction in recoverable oil and the potential size in a few decades time, the accent started to shift towards the other available fossil fuels such as gas and coal. The amount of Natural Gas trapped in the form of solid hydrate sunk in the deep ocean and permafrost areas cannot be estimated precisely, however, the scientific community agrees that values in order of 1015 to 1017 cubic metres are realistic. This has caused overwhelming research into gas hydrates as storage media for different gases. Gas hydrates are highly organized crystalline structures with molecules of light gases encaged in a framework created by water molecules. They can form at any place where free water in intimate contact with hydrate forming gas is exposed to elevated pressures and low temperatures. The ability to store large quantity of gas per unit volume makes gas hydrates an attractive option for any application requiring gas preservation. One of such modern applications for gas hydrates has arisen from the global warming problem and addresses the potential capability to efficiently capture and safely store the CO 2. Coal remains the main energy source in the world; for example, in Australia it is providing 40 % of total energy and up to 80 % of electricity (Cuevas-Cubria et al., 2010). The main advantages of coal over the other fossil energy resources are its abundance, its easy recoverability and lower cost. Massive pollution produced during burning of this fuel forced the creation of new technologies that allow for GHG reduction. Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle (IGCC) is the most favoured advanced option for energy recovery from a variety of sources, particularly coal, the so-called 'clean coal technology'. IGCC generates a high pressure shifted syngas stream composed essentially of Hydrogen and Carbon Dioxide. Historically, the CO 2 was separated from rich sources (such as natural gas) via the Ryan-Holmes <b>cryogenic</b> <b>condensation</b> process. However, applied at the gas or oil refinery this method can consume up to 50 % of the generated energy to bring the CO 2 levels down to pipeline requirements which does not seem attractive in terms of cost of CO 2 avoided. High temperatures utilised for coal gasification are also not favourable for the implementation of <b>cryogenic</b> <b>condensation</b> to an IGCC stream. On the other hand, high pressure and high CO 2 content in the IGCC flue gas provide the ideal conditions for CO 2 capture in the form of solid hydrates. This option has been investigated under the guidance of the US Department of Energy by a team of researchers (Los Alamos National Laboratory, Nexant, Inc., and SIMTECHE) since 1999 and at the Chinese Academy of Science. A few proof-of-concept reports can be found stating that the utilisation of the hydrate formation phenomenon for purification of gas streams is less energy intensive {{than any of the other}} existing CO 2 capture methods. The ability to encapsulate significant amounts of gas in little space and relatively mild conditions of storage make the hydrates an extremely attractive option for easy handling of high rates of GHG emissions. However, this research is still on a laboratory scale. In this thesis a new method is developed for cost and energy efficient CO 2 sequestration from IGCC sources based on a simple configuration. High feed pressure facilitates bulk removal of CO 2 by cryogenic methods, and high energy recovery is achieved through process integration with hydrate formation. Liquid CO 2 produced as a result of condensation carries most of the cold energy required for initial refrigeration, and the hydrate unit does not consume any substantial additional energy. Separated CO 2 is characterised by high purity sufficient for utilisation in enhanced oil and gas recovery processes. The hydrate can be easily handled and stored. Although the focus is made on IGCC flue gas application, the method can be extended to other sources with high CO 2 levels and supplied at high pressure. Additional value is brought to this research by extensive investigation of the phase behaviour of gas mixtures containing CO 2. Particular attention is paid to the distinctive features of gas hydrates produced in different systems including mixtures with hydrocarbons and non-hydrocarbons in various concentrations and in the presence of chemicals dissolved in water. This knowledge will contribute to the future development in the field of hydrates and will be useful for both academic research and industrial application...|$|E
