An installed electronic expansion valve provided the control actuation. Realtime <b>circulating</b> <b>oil</b> concentration data were obtained for steady-state, quasi-steady, and start-up operating regimes with an installed optical concentration sensor. A two-phase refrigerant-oil model was developed for R 134 a and polyalkylene glycol (PAG) oil to predict oil film thickness, average film velocity, and interfacial shear between the refrigerant vapor and the refrigerant-oil liquid film. Experimental and model results were analyzed and compared. Evaporator superheat reduced the <b>circulating</b> <b>oil</b> concentration due {{to an increase in}} the oil film thickness {{on the walls of the}} evaporator and suction line.
