The hollow sucker rod’s characteristic is easy disassembling, multiple sealing, and also has a large contact area of the shoulder. By using the method of finite-element analysis, we set up the finite-element model and analyze the contact stress and deformation distribution of two kinds of structure in different friction coefficients. Through the analysis, we find not only the bearing capacity of the circular arc shoulder joint, but also the sealing is also better than the tapered shoulder's joint. And for both kinds of joints, the friction coefficient is an important factor to affect the pretightening force...|$|R
40|$|Glued-in rod {{connections}} for timber beams {{are increasingly}} being used, as they offer high strength and stiffness and a better appearance in comparison with traditional mechanical connections. First, a campaign of experimental tests on glued-in threaded steel <b>rod</b> <b>joints</b> subjected to monotonic bending moments was carried out checking {{the effect of a}} confining system for the bars (transversal screws), the different arrangement of the rods or varying the mechanical characteristics of the steel of the bars. A negligible effect on joint ductility was observed using transversal screws whereas with a correct design and a proper choice of rod steel grade an important ductile behaviour was achieved. The experiments were then extended to cyclic tests so to emphasize the cyclic performance of glued-in <b>rod</b> <b>joints</b> under bending moments. The aim was mainly to understand the joint structural response under cyclic loads, simulating the effects of seismic action. The test results indicate that the joint can initially develop a high dissipative capacity, but after a few cycles, the energy dissipation is considerably reduced by the occurrence of longitudinal splitting in the timber edge of the joining bars leading to lateral instability of the rods...|$|R

40|$|Bonded-in <b>rod</b> <b>joints</b> {{have several}} {{advantages}} over the conventional type of joints {{in terms of}} performance, cost and aesthetics. The use of basalt fibre reinforced polymer (BFRP) rods would result in lower weight of the joint and improved resistance to corrosion but {{there appears to be}} little or no investigation on the use of these rods in the bonded-in rod technique. The aim of this research was to examine the behaviour of bonded-in BFRP and steel rods and to propose design models to enhance current knowledge in bonded-in rod technology. The mechanical properties of the timber members were characterised so as to predict the behaviour of donor and spliced beams for the proposed stressed model. Pull-out tests of the rods were conducted to investigate some factors that affect joint capacity and based of the results bonded-in rod timber beams were fabricated and tested for ultimate capacity and flexural stiffness. An analytical model based on the interfacial tress-strain interaction of the BFRP rods with the adhesive layer and the timber members was developed to predict pull-out capacity of the samples. Average shear strength from steel pull-out tests was also used to propose a design equation for pull-out capacity of steel samples. In both the BFRP and steel samples, good agreement with the tests results was observed. A trapezoidal timber compressive stress model was developed to predict ultimate moment capacities of steel and BFRP timber beams. Good agreement was found between the theoretical and bonded-in steel rod beams whereas results form bonded-in BFRP rod beams were lower due to tensile splitting. Bonded-in steel beams recorded higher stiffness than the theoretical stiffness, whereas there was strong agreement between the theoretical predictions and BFRP beam tests. Thus, the presented models may serve as a useful reference for future design of bonded- in <b>rod</b> <b>joints.</b> EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R

40|$|The use of Glued In <b>Rod</b> <b>joints</b> for wooden constructions is an {{efficient}} technology to connect and design members in new timber structures and to rehabilitate the damaged structural elements of historical buildings. The major issue concerning {{the use of}} adhesive anchors in timber {{is the lack of}} a standard regulation in the current Eurocode 5 for timber structures. Due to the gap in knowledge of this specific topic in engineering structural design, designers' choices are still supported by test analysis which enables knowledge, and the prediction, of the structural behaviour of Glued In <b>Rod</b> <b>joints.</b> Over the last 30 years, research studies have suggested diverse and contradictory procedures for the prediction of the withdrawal capacity of adhesive anchors in timber whose application led to the relay of inconsistent information about the use of Glued In Rods in the timber engineering field. The presented research work is aimed at clarifying the contradictory nature amongst existing design rules and at proposing a correct design procedure to assess the load bearing capacity of adhesive anchors in timber, whilst also taking into consideration the high product-dependency which Glued In Rod connections are characterised by. Moreover, the thesis investigates the development of new prototypes of resin connectors in timber through the identification of innovative technical solutions in order to achieve an improved structural performance of the studied adhesive joints. An extensive experimental program has been carried out on 'traditional' and new prototypes of adhesive anchors in timber, identified respectively by smooth-cylindrical and rough-threaded internal boreholes in which 8 mm steel rods have been glued by the use of low and high viscosity epoxy resins. The tensile performance of more than 100 samples of single adhesive anchors made from solid timber and glulam has been tested by pull-compression tests in confined test regimes, in both cold states and at elevated temperatures. Experimental findings suggest that in cold states and in restrictive manufacturing conditions, the adoption of the new prototype of Glued In Rods, characterised by the presence of a threaded and rough internal bonding surface, can simultaneously provide an increase of up to 12...|$|R

40|$|The {{functional}} garments {{are important}} protective device for the disciplinary forces, such as police, fireman and soldier. Typical protective garments {{are made of}} special non-stretchable fabric and hence can restrict {{the movement of the}} wearer if the garment is not designed properly. A protective garment that can ensure maximal range-of-motion can be a difference of life and death when the disciplinary force is on duty. There are many aspects of range-of-motion. In the current study, we address the question of the appropriate amount of dynamic ease allowance (movement ease) required for any given height that the arm is supposed to reach. The relationship among the dynamic ease allowance, under arm sleeve length, and side seam length was derived, by using the <b>rod</b> <b>joint</b> model of the human being and assuming the motion is a cross-sectional one along the frontal plane. Sixty subjects wore the special net garment to record the reference of zero dynamic ease allowance, and then the adjustable garments of different scye depth, which is related to the dynamic ease allowance. The subjects were asked to move their arm along a vertical plane, from rest position to the maximum height that they can reach. Such motions were recorded by a motion capturing system. The experimental data was compared to the theoretical prediction. Since the analysis was conducted using the 3 -D data and the garment measurements must be converted from the 3 -D environment (when the garment is worn) to the 2 -D environment (when the garment is not worn). The conversion approximation is also presented. Consequently, when the required posture is known, the required scye depth and the required dynamic seam allowance can be found. The armhole can be designed accordingly. Institute of Textiles and Clothin...|$|R
