5|$|Gilbertian mimicry {{involves}} {{only two}} species. The potential host (or prey) drives away its parasite (or predator) by mimicking it, {{the reverse of}} host-parasite aggressive mimicry.

5|$|The name Liliaceae was <b>coined</b> <b>by</b> Michel Adanson in 1763. The {{name was}} derived from Lilium and the family suffix -aceae. Lilium is the type genus of the family, which is the Latin for Lily, which in turn came from the Greek name for it, λείριον (leírion).|$|E
5|$|While {{experimenting with}} the {{products}} of radioactive decay, in 1913 radiochemist Frederick Soddy discovered that {{there appeared to be}} more than one element at each position on the periodic table.

5|$|The {{fish was}} {{originally}} described as Raja laevis by Samuel Latham Mitchill in 1818. The scientific name was later changed to the currently valid name Dipturus laevis. It {{has also been}} misidentified as Raia granulata by Theodore Gill, an American ichthyologist, in 1879. The genus name, Dipturus, {{is derived from the}} Greek words di, meaning two, and pteryx, meaning wing. Raja, the original genus which was <b>coined</b> <b>by</b> Carl Linnaeus in 1758, is still recognized as a valid subgenus.|$|E
5|$|The {{name was}} <b>coined</b> <b>by</b> the {{historian}} Andrew Watson in an influential 1974 paper. He listed eighteen crops that were widely diffused during the Islamic period, including four staple crops, namely durum wheat, Asiatic rice, sorghum, and cotton. He {{also argued that}} techniques such as irrigation were spread across the region at that time. The paper was not based on direct archaeological or scientific evidence, and its approach has been called old-fashioned and philological.|$|E
5|$|While {{experimenting with}} the {{products}} of radioactive decay, in 1913 radiochemist Frederick Soddy discovered that {{there appeared to be}} more than one type of atom at each position on the periodic table. The term isotope was <b>coined</b> <b>by</b> Margaret Todd as a suitable name for different atoms that belong to the same element. J.J. Thomson created a technique for separating atom types through his work on ionized gases, which subsequently led to the discovery of stable isotopes.|$|E

5|$|Aposematism (from Greek ἀπό apo away, σῆμα sema sign) was a {{new term}} <b>coined</b> <b>by</b> Edward Bagnall Poulton for Alfred Russel Wallace's concept of warning coloration. It {{describes}} a family of antipredator adaptations in which a warning signal {{is associated with the}} unprofitability of a prey item to potential predators. Aposematism always involves an advertising signal. The warning signal may take the form of conspicuous animal coloration, sounds, odours or other perceivable characteristics. Aposematic signals are beneficial for both the predator and prey, since both avoid potential harm.|$|E
5|$|Charles Darwin {{mentioned}} evolutionary {{interactions between}} flowering plants and insects in On the Origin of Species (1859). The term coevolution was <b>coined</b> <b>by</b> Paul R. Ehrlich and Peter H. Raven in 1964. The theoretical underpinnings of coevolution are now well-developed, and demonstrate that coevolution {{can play an}} important role in driving major evolutionary transitions such as the evolution of sexual reproduction or shifts in ploidy. More recently, it has also been demonstrated that coevolution influences the structure and function of ecological communities as well as the dynamics of infectious disease.|$|E
5|$|Following its debut, the 747 rapidly {{achieved}} iconic status, {{appearing in}} numerous film productions such as Airport 1975 and Airport '77 disaster films, Air Force One, Die Hard 2, and Executive Decision. Appearing in over 300 film productions the 747 {{is one of}} the most widely depicted civilian aircraft and is considered by many as one of the most iconic in film history. The aircraft entered the cultural lexicon as the original Jumbo Jet, a term <b>coined</b> <b>by</b> the aviation media to describe its size, and was also nicknamed Queen of the Skies.|$|E

5|$|Frigatebirds {{were grouped}} with cormorants, and sulids (gannets and boobies) {{as well as}} {{pelicans}} in the genus Pelecanus by Linnaeus in 1758 in the tenth edition of his Systema Naturae. He described the distinguishing characteristics as a straight bill hooked at the tip, linear nostrils, a bare face, and fully webbed feet. The genus Fregata was defined by French naturalist Bernard Germain de Lacépède in 1799. Louis Jean Pierre Vieillot described the genus name Tachypetes in 1816 for the great frigatebird. The genus name Atagen had been <b>coined</b> <b>by</b> German naturalist Paul Möhring in 1752, though this has no validity as it predates the official beginning of Linnaean taxonomy.|$|E
5|$|Hellenization was <b>coined</b> <b>by</b> the German {{historian}} Johann Gustav Droysen {{to denote}} {{the spread of}} Greek language, culture, and population into the former Persian empire after Alexander's conquest. That this export took place is undoubted, and {{can be seen in}} the great Hellenistic cities of, for instance, Alexandria, Antioch and Seleucia (south of modern Baghdad). Alexander sought to insert Greek elements into Persian culture and attempted to hybridize Greek and Persian culture. This culminated in his aspiration to homogenize the populations of Asia and Europe. However, his successors explicitly rejected such policies. Nevertheless, Hellenization occurred throughout the region, accompanied by a distinct and opposite 'Orientalization' of the successor states.|$|E
5|$|However, {{the first}} {{description}} of a Dimetrodon fossil came a year earlier, when Cope named the species Clepsydrops limbatus from the Texas Red Beds. (The name Clepsydrops was first <b>coined</b> <b>by</b> Cope in 1875 for sphenacodontid remains from Vermilion County, Illinois, and was later employed for many sphenacontid specimens from Texas; many new species of sphenacodontids from Texas were assigned to either Clepsydrops or Dimetrodon {{in the late nineteenth}} and early twentieth centuries.) C.limbatus was reclassified as a species of Dimetrodon in 1940, meaning that Cope's 1877 paper was the first record of Dimetrodon.|$|E
