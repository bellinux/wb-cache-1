40|$|Estrogens such as 17 B-estradiol (E 2) and estrone (E 1) {{have been}} {{detected}} in surface waters at concentrations considered to have a biological impact on fish and amphibians. Many pathways of estrogens to surface waters have been investigated, but those through soil (leaching to karsts, shallow groundwater, or agricultural drains) represent some challenges. Previous {{research has shown that}} estrogens preferentially sorb to soil organic matter (SOM), and that they are rapidly degraded in aerobic conditions. Consequently we usually expect little or no leaching and transport of estrogens in soil, but E 2 and E 1 are still detected in unexpected places. Explanations for this require the influence of preferential flow paths and possibly colloidal materials. Colloids may enhance estrogen transport through soil. This study was designed to investigate the impacts of <b>colloidal</b> <b>material</b> on the interactions of E 2 and E 1 with soil, highlighting the ability of colloids to sorb E 2 and E 1, the rate of sorption and degradation, and any effect of suspended colloids on the transport of E 2 and E 1. Our results show estrogen sorption to soil and <b>colloidal</b> <b>material</b> is dominated by soil organic carbon as the sorbent (hydrophobic partitioning), and organic carbon more concentrated in <b>colloidal</b> <b>material</b> meaning that colloids can sorb more estrogen than soil, by mass. The kinetics of sorption show a rapid phase and a slower phase, with similar rates between the different materials measured. Degradation of estrogens is rapid in soil under aerobic conditions, but can slow, cease, or even reverse under anaerobic conditions. If preferential flow pathways are present, <b>colloidal</b> <b>material</b> can carry estrogens through soil. The presence of colloids and preferential flow paths during transport decreased the time of first detection, and increased both the concentration at peak delivery, and the total estrogen mass fraction transported...|$|E

40|$|RONO: 2430 4064 This paper {{reports the}} use of a new technique, flow field-flow {{fractionation}} (FIFFF), for the characterization of soil sampled under grassland. FIFFF can be used to determine the fine <b>colloidal</b> <b>material</b> in the < 1 mu m fraction obtained by gravitational settling of 1 % m/v soil suspensions. The aim of this work was to determine the potential of FIFFF to characterize soil colloids in drained and undrained field lysimeters from soil cores sampled at different depths. Two different grassland lysimeter plots of I ha, one drained and one undrained, were investigated, and the soil was sampled at 20 -m intervals along a single diagonal transect at three different depths (0 - 2, 10 - 12, and 30 - 32 cm). The results showed that there was a statistically significant (P = 0. 05) increase in <b>colloidal</b> <b>material</b> at 30 - to 32 -cm, depth aJong the transect under the drained lysimeter, which correlates with disturbance of the soil at this depth due to the installation of tile drains at 85 -cm depth backfilled to 30 -cm depth with gravel. Laser sizing was also used to determine the particles in the size range I to 2000 pm and complement the data obtained using FIFFF because laser sizing tacks resolution for the finer <b>colloidal</b> <b>material</b> (0. 1 - 1. 0 m). The laser sizing data showed increased heterogeneity at 30 - to 32 -cm depth, particularly in the 50 to 250 pm size fraction. Therefore FIFFF characterized the finer material and laser sizing the coarser soil fraction (< 2000 pm) at depth in drained and undrained grassland. This is of importance as <b>colloidal</b> <b>material</b> is more mobile than the larger material and consequently an important vector for contaminant transport from agricultural land to catchments.

Understanding interaction of chlorpyrifos with <b>colloidal</b> <b>materials</b> is fundamental for assessing fate and toxicity of chlorpyrifos in soil and aquatic environments. The objectives of this study were: (1) to quantify sorption and desorption of chlorpyrifos on <b>colloidal</b> <b>materials</b> in aqueous systems; (2) to investigate hydrolysis of chlorpyrifos in aqueous systems; (3) to evaluate the effects of <b>colloidal</b> <b>materials</b> {{on the fate of}} the sorbed chlorpyrifos in aqueous systems; and (4) to study abiotic transformation of chlorpyrifos in water;Six reference smectites, humic acid and suspended sediment collected from the Upper Cedar River near Janesville, Iowa were used for the present study. X-ray diffraction, Scanning Electron Microscopy, ICP-AES and chemical analysis were employed to characterize the <b>colloidal</b> <b>materials.</b> GC and HPLC were used to quantify chlorpyrifos and its degradates in aqueous systems. The results indicate a large difference in sorption affinities and variation in desorption among smectites. The sorption affinity for chlorpyrifos was not correlated to cation-exchange capacity, surface area or surface charge density, but {{may be related to the}} fabric of smectite quasicrystals. Substantial sorption-desorption hysteresis was found for all smectites and the suspended sediment. Chlorpyrifos was strongly sorbed by HA with negligible desorption in aqueous solution. Chlorpyrifos degraded in aqueous systems with half-lives ranged from 27 to 158 days, depending on the chemistry of aqueous solutions. The rate of chlorpyrifos hydrolysis decreased in the presence of suspended smectites in aqueous systems. The formation of chlorpyrifos-colloid complexes inhibited hydrolysis and influenced fate of chlorpyrifos in aqueous systems, suggesting that sorption of chlorpyrifos on suspended sediment may potentially prolong the exposure time of organisms such as fish to chlorpyrifos in aquatic environments. An abiotic transformation of chlorpyrifos to chlorpyrifos oxon in tap water is reported in this study. Active chlorine dispersed in tap water was responsible for the chemical transformation. The findings raise a new concern about the safety of domestic use of chlorpyrifos products...|$|R

The sludges from all systems were analyzed for particle size distribution (PSD), <b>colloidal</b> <b>material,</b> extracellular polymer substances (EPS) and filamentous microorganisms.

The SMBR sludges had the highest amount of small particles {{and higher levels of}} <b>colloidal</b> <b>material</b> than the CAS sludges.

The SMBR sludge contained the higher levels of total filamentous organisms attributable largely to its higher nocardioform level. This resulted from more efficient foam trapping by the SMBR. The normalized CST values of the SMBR sludge were lower than for the CAS sludges. This was attributed to its lower EPS content.
