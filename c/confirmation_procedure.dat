These procedures are applicable and necessary whether or not Phases I and II {{have been used to}} identify the suspected toxicants. There are two major reasons to require <b>confirmation</b> <b>procedures.</b> First, the effluent manipulations used in Phases I and II will, for some effluents, create artifacts that may lead to erroneous conclusions about the toxicants. In Phase 111, manipulations of the effluent are absent or minimal and artifacts are far less likely to occur. Sometimes, toxicants will be suspected through other approaches which are not themselves definitive. In either case, confirmation is necessary. The second reason stems from the definite probability that the substances causing toxicity change from sample to sample, from season to season or some other periodicity. Since toxicity is a generic measurement, just measuring toxicity will not reveal such variability. Phase 111 procedures will reveal the presence of variabl...|$|R

A new BPH resistance derived from IR 1154 - 243 was located on chromosome 4 and was named as Bph 11 (Xu et al. 2002). However, the bph 11 gene was identified in an introgression line derived from O. officianalis on chromosome 3 (Hirabayashi and Ogawa 1995). The Bph 12 and bph 12 genes mapped on chromosome 3 derived from different resistance donors, O. officianalis and O. latifolia, respectively (Yang et al. 2002; Hirabayashi and Ogawa 1995). The Bph 13 gene identified in two introgression lines were derived from O. eichingeri and O. officinalis.

Although there was overlap between blood oxycodone levels in deaths attributed to oxycodone only and those due to polydrug intoxication, lower oxycodone levels ( 1 mg/L). The role of the parent drug in oxycodone fatalities has been fully studied, but the role of oxycodone metabolites (noroxycodone and oxymorphone) was investigated in this report for the first time. Oxycodone was more commonly detected in blood, urine, and vitreous humor followed by noroxycodone. The ratio between oxycodone and its N-demethylated metabolite was evaluated and found to be useful in determining whether death occurred shortly after drug administration or if there was a significant delay.

Several agars and confirmation procedures were evaluated in parallel with the Australian/New Zealand Standard (AS/NZ) Method for the enumeration of Cl. perfringens from treated and untreated sewage samples. Methods and Results: The current AS/NZ method utilizes tryptose sulfite cycloserine agar (TSC), lactose gelatin medium (LG) and nitrate motility medium (NM) at an incubation temperature of 37 °C. Sixty treated and untreated sewage samples were used to evaluate TSC agar, membrane Cl. perfringens agar (mCP), Perfringens agar (OPSP) and Perfringens agar with 4 -methylumbelliferyl phosphate (OPSP–MUP) for enumeration of Clostridium. An incubation temperature of 44 °C for 24 h was used for comparison. Confirmation procedures were also evaluated using 103 isolates and included LG and NM, ortho-nitrophenyl-β-D-galactopyranoside (ONPG) with MUP (ONPG–MUP) and phosphatase reagent (PR). OPSP compared favourably with TSC agar. One false negative result was obtained {{from each of the}} LG/NM and ONPG–MUP procedures.

Significance and Impact of the Study: This is a simple and rapid method for isolating and enumerating Cl. perfringens from sewage samples and confirmed results can be reported more quickly due to shorter analytical turnaround times...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: We {{aimed to}} examine {{health-related}} impairments {{in young children}} with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and non-ADHD controls and explore differences in children with ADHD by gender, ADHD subtype and mental health co-morbidity status. METHODS: Children with ADHD (n =  177) and controls (n =  212) aged 6 - 8  years were recruited across 43 schools in Melbourne, Australia following a screening (Conners 3 ADHD Index) and case <b>confirmation</b> <b>procedure</b> (Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Children IV). Direct and blinded assessments of height and weight were used to calculate body mass index z-score and to identify overweight/obesity. Parents reported on child global health, sleep problems and physical injuries. Unadjusted and adjusted (socio-demographic factors and co-morbidities) logistic and linear regression were conducted to compare health-related impairments between (1) children with and without ADHD; (2) boys and girls with ADHD; (3) children with ADHD-inattentive and ADHD-combined types; and (4) children with ADHD by internalizing and externalizing disorder status. RESULTS: Children with ADHD had poorer global health than controls when adjusted for socio-demographic characteristics (OR: 2. 0; 95 % CI 1. 1, 3. 9); however, this attenuated after adjusting for co-morbidities. In adjusted analyses, children with ADHD had increased odds of moderate/large sleep problems (OR: 3. 1; 95 % CI 1. 4, 6. 8), compared with controls. There were no differences between children with and without ADHD in terms of physical injuries or overweight/obesity. Findings were similar when excluding children taking ADHD medication, and health-related impairments did not differ {{between boys and girls}} with ADHD. Children with ADHD-combined type had higher BMI z-scores than controls in adjusted analyses (P =  0. 04). Children with ADHD and co-occurring internalizing and externalizing co-morbidities were particularly vulnerable to health-related impairments. CONCLUSION: Young children with ADHD experience a number of health-related impairments, which are exacerbated by the presence of internalizing and externalizing co-morbidities. Clinicians should consider the broader health of children with ADHD in clinical consultations...|$|E
40|$|Because the {{incorrect}} food avoidance affects {{quality of}} life and nutrition, especially in children, there is possible harm in over-diagnosing food allergy. The approach to the proper diagnosis of food allergy and nonallergic intolerance requires consideration of the medical history, tests for food-specific IgE antibodies, skin puncture tests. Pediatrist must appreciate that a positive test for food-specific IgE or skin puncture test primarily denotes sensitization and may not confirm clinical allergy. Food elimination diet or oral food challenge is required for diagnosis <b>confirmation.</b> Additional <b>procedures</b> may be needed, depending on the differential diagnosis of IgE mediated or non-IgE mediated food intolerance. </p...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND:Chediak-Higashi {{syndrome}} (CHS) is {{an inherited}} immunodeficiency disease characterized by giant lysosomes and impaired leukocyte degranulation. CHS results from mutations in the lysosomal trafficking regulator (LYST) gene, which encodes a 425 -kD cytoplasmic protein of unknown function. The {{goal of this}} study was to identify proteins that interact with LYST as a first step in understanding how LYST modulates lysosomal exocytosis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fourteen cDNA fragments, covering the entire coding domain of LYST, were used as baits to screen five human cDNA libraries by a yeast two-hybrid method, modified to allow screening in the activation and the binding domain, three selectable markers, and more stringent <b>confirmation</b> <b>procedures.</b> Five of the interactions were confirmed by an in vitro binding assay. RESULTS: Twenty-one proteins that interact with LYST were identified in yeast two-hybrid screens. Four interactions, confirmed directly, were with proteins important in vesicular transport and signal transduction (the SNARE-complex protein HRS, 14 - 3 - 3, and casein kinase II). CONCLUSIONS:On the basis of protein interactions, LYST appears to function as an adapter protein that may juxtapose proteins that mediate intracellular membrane fusion reactions. The pathologic manifestations observed in CHS patients and in mice with the homologous mutation beige suggest that understanding the role of LYST may be relevant to the treatment of not only CHS but also of diseases such as asthma, urticaria, and lupus, as well as to the molecular dissection of the CHS-associated cancer predisposition...|$|R
40|$|In {{the present}} study, {{toremifene}} urinary excretion studies were evaluated {{in order to}} examine main metabolic reactions and to select target metabolites in doping control analysis. Urine samples from three female subjects were collected every 3 h for at least 15 days after the oral administration of a single dose of FarestonA (R) (60 mg). The elemental compositions of the compounds detected were determined by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry using a time-of-flight system with accurate mass measurement. More detailed structure elucidation was obtained by monitoring {{the presence or absence of}} structure-specific ions, using product ion scan and neutral loss acquisition modes, whereas the metabolites urinary profiles were evaluated in selected reaction monitoring acquisition mode. The results showed that the main routes of phase-I modifications involved carboxylation of the chlorinated side chain, N-demethylation and hydroxylation in different positions. Fifteen metabolites were found in all subjects studied, most of them were detected for more than 10 days in the free, glucuronide and sulphate fractions, with a maximum of excretion generally after 9 - 22 and 34 - 47 h from drug administration. These metabolites can be divided in two groups: metabolites with the characteristic chlorine isotope pattern and metabolites without the characteristic chlorine isotope pattern. The most abundant and long-term compounds were the carboxylated metabolites followed by the hydroxylated metabolites. Their product ions originating after collision-induced dissociation were observed to occur prevalently in the dimethylaminoethoxy and in the chlorinated side chains. These structure-specific ions were used to design screening and <b>confirmation</b> <b>procedures</b> to positively identify toremifene administration in doping control analysis...|$|R
