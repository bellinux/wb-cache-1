40|$|Disabling {{monomorphic}} ventricular bigeminy has {{not been}} described as an indication for surgery. Three young patients with this arrhythmia sometimes deteriorating into ventricular tachyarrhythmias and in whom drug therapy failed completely were accepted for surgical ablation of the arrhythmogenic area. The earliest endocardial site of origin was located preoperatively by catheter mapping of the spontaneously occurring ventricular bigeminy in {{the left and right}} ventricles. For maximum preservation of myocardial muscle and function, the preoperative mapping and surgical procedure were performed through the aortic root; mapping by transaortic multipolar balloon was done during normothermic coronary perfusion and <b>cryocoagulation</b> was done during cardioplegic arrest. <b>Cryocoagulation</b> of the endocardial site was performed using the transaortic approach and epicardial <b>cryocoagulation</b> at the opposite site was done afterwards. In the two patients in whom the preoperative mapping results were consistent with those of preoperative catheter mapping, the arrhythmia could be abolished, as documented during long-term follow-up. In the only patient in whom the mapping results were not in agreement, the ventricular arrhythmia reoccurred and was the cause of death at five months after surgery. Postoperative wall-motion studies performed in the two surviving patients showed limited scars in the area of <b>cryocoagulation</b> and minor damage to the coronary arteries in that area. The transaortic approach can be considered as a new and important surgical option for endocardial mapping and <b>cryocoagulation</b> which prevents the damaging effects of a left ventriculotom...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Sturge-Weber {{syndrome}} {{is a rare}} congenital neuro-oculocutaneous disorder. Ocular involvement can include glaucoma and vascular malformations of the conjunctiva, episclera, choroid, and retina. METHODS: The records of 19 Sturge-Weber syndrome patients (mean age 8. 2 years) treated at our institution were reviewed to determine the incidence of ophthalmologic manifestations in Sturge-Weber syndrome. RESULTS: Glaucoma occurred in 42 % of all patients and was more frequent in patients with a port-wine stain involving both upper and lower eyelids. Other ocular manifestations included conjunctival/episcleral hemangioma, choroidal hemangioma, iris heterochromia, retinal detachment, strabismus, and homonymous hemianopia. In 7 of 8 patients with glaucoma, topical pharmacotherapy (beta-blockers and carbonic anhydrase inhibitors) alone failed to normalize intraocular pressures. In those patients, <b>cryocoagulation</b> of the ciliary body was performed. Mean postoperative intraocular pressure after a mean follow-up of 4 - 5 years was < 22 mm Hg in 6 patients.

40|$|Fifty {{patients}} with retinal detachment accompanied by vitreous haemorrhage, perforating eye injuries, intraocular foreign bodies, massive preretinal retraction,. giant tears greater than 180 degrees, and proliferative retinopathies underwent pars plana vitrectomy, <b>cryocoagulation,</b> scleral buckling, and intravitreal gas injection. Intraoperative complications included minimal to moderate bleeding and iatrogenic retinal tears, but no retinal dialysis was produced at the pars plana sclerotomy site. Postoperative complications included recurrent vitreous haemorrhage, rubeosis, haemolytic, erythroclastic, or neovascular glaucoma, transient increase of intraocular pressure, uveitis, and macular pucker.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Giant retinal {{tears were}} {{previously}} described in patients affected by panuveitis. We report {{the case of}} a patient presenting giant retinal tears in both eyes affected by ocular syphilis. PATIENT AND METHOD: A 45 -year-old patient presented a 5 days history of sudden bilateral drop of vision, two weeks after penicillin therapy for secondary syphilis. The best visual acuity was 0. 5 RE and light perception LE. Biomicroscopy showed an intense vitritis associated with bilateral giant tear and retinal detachment. Both TPHA and VDRL were positive. Lumbar puncture showed lymphoplasmocytosis with intrathecal synthesis of IgM. RESULTS: Topical steroids treatment was applied and intravenous penicillin was given during 14 days. Pars plana vitrectomy with silicon oil tamponade was performed in association with endophotocoagulation in the left eye and <b>cryocoagulation</b> in the right eye. Vitreous PCR was negative.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The risk of {{retinopathy}} of prematurity (ROP) {{is associated}} with low birth weight and low gestational age. For ROP screening examination is recommended in infants weighing 1500 g (n = 149) and who required additional oxygen supplementation or underwent surgery with general anaesthesia before estimated term. RESULTS: Unexpectedly, three infants with birth weights between 2080 and 2325 g and a gestational age of 32 or 33 weeks developed stage 2 or 3 ROP. One of these underwent <b>cryocoagulation.</b> In three infants, preterm birth was induced by sudden placental abruption with severe prenatal blood loss followed by haemorrhagic shock. The umbilical cord packed cell volume was reduced to 0. 14 - 0. 19 (normal 0. 43 - 0. 63). All three infants underwent surgery with general anaesthesia within the first weeks of life. Of the remaining 449 infants none with a birth weight > 1650 g developed any stage of ROP.

40|$|Twenty-six {{eyes with}} intraocular foreign bodies (IOFB) and/or their {{sequelae}} were treated by pars plana vitrectomy and associated surgery. One-step {{removal of the}} IOFB in combination with pars plana vitrectomy resulted in early visual rehabilitation and minimal complications. Of 11 eyes with IOFB treated by primary vitrectomy {{at the time of}} IOFB removal 20 / 50 or better visual acuity was obtained in 10 (91 %). Four of these eyes had retinal injury, 3 of which were successfully repaired without subsequent complication and with retention of good visual function. In 3 eyes IOFBs were not removed owing to chronic retinal encapsulation. These eyes continue to retain good visual acuity, and ERG studies show no evidence of retinal toxicity. Of 12 eyes in which vitrectomy was performed for sequelae of IOFB only 5 (41 %) showed visual improvement better than 20 / 50. Only in 2 of 7 eyes with tractional retinal detachment could the retina be reattached.

40|$|Retinopathy of {{prematurity}} (ROP), an {{ocular disease}} characterized by onset of vascular abnormalities {{in the developing}} retina, is the major cause of visual impairment and blindness in premature neonates. ROP is a complex multifactorial disease that occurs with microvascular degeneration followed by neovascularization which passing through different stages can progress to retinal detachment. Currently used ablative therapies like <b>cryocoagulation</b> and laser photocoagulation for proliferative ROP have limitations, and patients can still have long-term complications despite a successful treatment. Based on the knowledge regarding ROP pathophysiology, new treatment modalities are being developed. First results of intravitreal anti-VEGF therapy using bevacizumab are promising. Furthermore, besides intravitreal anti-VEGF therapy, systemic therapy with mediators like insulin-like growth factor (IGF- 1) and/or ω 3 -fatty acids outlines the pharmacological approach to treatment of ROP. One of the most destructive manifestations of ROP is preretinal neovascularization. As we continue to decipher the underlying pathophysiological cellular mechanisms governing proliferative retinopathy, fostering normal retinal revascularization will open new therapeutic possibilities. All efforts should be focused on developing preventive strategies for ROP {{in order to avoid}} the need for nondestructive therapy modalities. (Turk J Ophthalmol 2012; 42 : Supplement 63 - 7...|$|E

Over the years, the right eye was irradiated twice and underwent trans-pars plana vitrectomy, transscleral <b>cryocoagulation,</b> argon laser photocoagulation of tumors and their feeder vessels, extracapsular cataract extraction with posterior chamber lens implantation, and neodymium:yttrium-aluminum-garnet laser treatment of after-cataract {{in the form of}} Elschnig's pearls. Finally, the patient received combination chemotherapy with etoposide, methotrexate, actinomycin D, cisplatin, and vincristine. The eye finally had to be removed 12 years later due to tumor recurrences and seeding, pseudohypopyon, and elevated intraocular pressure. Histopathology showed microcellular retinoblastoma cells in the anterior chamber angle and trabecular meshwork without subconjunctival extension and in the nasal ciliary body, pars plana, internal limiting membrane, and optic nerve head anterior to the cribriform plate. The patient is without local or systemic recurrences at age 50, 11 years after the last eye was enucleated.

40|$|AbstractEbstein's anomaly is {{the most}} common {{congenital}} heart disease associated with the Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome. Between November 1973 and March 1993, we surgically treated 42 patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome and Ebstein's anomaly. The patients' ages ranged from 5 months to 59 years (mean 35. 3 ± 14. 0 years). There were a total of 52 accessory pathways, 48 of which were located in the right (65 %) or posteroseptal (29 %) area. A left-sided accessory pathway was seen in only two patients (3. 8 %). Division of all right-sided accessory pathways was done during normothermic cardiopulmonary bypass with the heart beating; <b>cryocoagulation</b> was applied together with scalpel dissection of the atrioventricular groove. Division of the left-sided accessory pathways was done with the use of cold potassium cardioplegic arrest. Thirty-five of these patients underwent tricuspid valve operation for Ebstein's anomaly and 11 of them underwent tricuspid valve replacement with a bioprosthesis. All 52 accessory pathways were successfully divided, although two patients required reoperation because of tachycardia caused by accessory pathways in different positions. Three hospital deaths (7. 1 %) occurred. There were no late deaths during the follow-up period (mean 94. 3 ± 52. 4 months), but two patients required repeat tricuspid operation because of progression of the tricuspid regurgitation. Because no repeat operations were required during long-term follow-up in patients who underwent valve repair or valve replacement, correction should be indicated in some patients.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Eales' {{disease is}} an {{idiopathic}} retinal vasculitic and vaso-occlusive process complicated by extensive retinal neovascularisation and vitreous hemorrhages. The great propensity to produce retinal neovessels {{is one of}} the particular aspects of the disease that deserves to be further investigated. We report a case of Eales' disease having evolved over more than three decades, with a typical clinical presentation in one eye, while the other eye had to be enucleated because of a terminal neovascular glaucoma, thus allowing pathological examination. METHODS: The functional right eye was treated by vitrectomy, cerclage, <b>cryocoagulation</b> and endolaser. The non-functional phthitic left eye was enucleated and submitted for histopathological and immunohistochemical examination using antibodies against vascular endothelial growth factor, T-cells, B-cells and Muller cells. RESULTS: Evolution was favourable in the operated right eye, following management of the inflammatory reaction. The histopathological examination of the left eye revealed an occlusion of the anterior chamber angle by rubeosis iridis, tractional retinal detachments, pre-, intra- and sub-retinal neovascular membranes, and vitrous hemorrhages. Diffuse positive anti-VEGF immunostaining was found {{at the level of the}} retinal neovascular membranes. The retina exhibited prominent Muller cell immunostaining, indicating extensive gliosis, and predominantly B cell infiltrates were found in the eye. CONCLUSION: The present study indicates a close relationship between the prominent neovascular proliferation in Eales' disease and the intense expression of VEGF. The increased expression of VEGF, when compared to other conditions inducing neovascularisation, might explain the severity of neovascular growth and the propensity of repeated vitrous hemorrhages in Eales' disease...|$|E
40|$|Disease characteristics. VCAN-related vitreoretinopathy, which {{includes}} Wagner syndrome and erosive vitreoretinopathy (ERVR), {{is characterized by}} “optically empty vitreous” on slit-lamp examination and avascular vitreous strands and veils, mild or occasionally moderate to severe myopia, presenile cataract, night blindness of variable degree associated with progressive chorioretinal atrophy, retinal detachment at advanced stages of the disease, and reduced visual acuity. Systemic abnormalities are not observed. The first signs usually become apparent during early adolescence, but onset can be as early as age two years. Diagnosis/testing. The clinical diagnosis of VCAN-related vitreoretinopathy is established based on typical clinical findings and a family history consistent with autosomal dominant inheritance. VCAN (previously CSPG 2) is the only gene known {{to be associated with}} Wagner syndrome and ERVR. Molecular genetic testing is available on a clinical basis. Management. Treatment of manifestations: Refractive error is corrected by spectacles or contact lenses; visually disabling cataract is treated by cataract surgery, preferably by an experienced surgeon. Retinal breaks without retinal detachment are treated with laser retinopexy or <b>cryocoagulation.</b> Vitreoretinal surgery is indicated for retinal detachment, vitreoretinal traction involving the macula, or epiretinal membranes involving the macula. Surveillance: annual ophthalmologic examination by a vitreoretinal specialist.

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{describe}} the incidence {{and characteristics of}} iatrogenic retinal breaks in 25 -gauge macular surgery. DESIGN: Retrospective, noncomparative, interventional case series. METHODS: We included 177 consecutive operations in 171 patients who underwent 25,gauge vitrectomy for idiopathic macular pucker or idiopathic macular hole. Main outcome measures were the incidence of breaks related to the sclerotomies, the incidence of breaks occurring elsewhere, the incidence of lesions suspicious for traction, the location of identified breaks, and intraoperative induction of posterior vitreous detachment (PVD). RESULTS: Retinal breaks occurred in 15. 8 % of operations. In 6. 2 %, breaks {{were related to the}} sclerotomies, and in 10. 7 %, breaks were found elsewhere. In 8. 5 % of eyes, only lesions suspicious for traction were detected. Breaks or suspicious lesions were treated with external <b>cryocoagulation</b> in a total of 24. 3 % of cases. A statistically significant relation between PVD induction and presence of breaks elsewhere was identified. No correlation with lens status, initial diagnosis, or preoperative refraction was found. Retinal detachment occurred in 1. 7 % of cases. CONCLUSIONS: We report an incidence of retinal breaks that is higher than previously found for 20 - or 25 -gauge surgery. Despite the high incidence of breaks, the incidence of postoperative retinal detachment was low. A specific characteristic was the relatively high incidence of breaks elsewhere and their relation to PVD induction. Our findings underscore the importance of scrupulous full 360 -degree internal search {{at the end of each}} procedure to identify and treat all breaks and suspicious lesions optimally.

METHODS: This was a prospective, randomized, controlled, double-blind trial. One hundred twenty patients with a rhegmatogenous retinal detachment scheduled to undergo external buckling surgery and <b>cryocoagulation</b> were asked to participate. Participants were randomly assigned either to receive 3 - 5 [*]mL Chirocaine (22. 5 - 37. 5 [*]mg) or 3 - 5 [*]mL Chirocaine and 1 [*]mL clonidine (150 [*]μg) before surgery. Main outcome measures were postoperative pain, use of analgesics, blood pressure, and plasma clonidine concentration. Nine nonrandomized patients consented to give blood samples for pharmacokinetic analysis. RESULTS: There was no significant difference in pain score between both groups. On average, the use of analgesic medication occurred later in the clonidine group (P= 0. 0004), but there was no statistical difference in the first time that postoperative medication was taken (P= 0. 13). Blood pressure was reduced by clonidine (systolic: P= 0. 02, diastolic: P= 0. 006). Clonidine levels could be demonstrated during the 24 -h postoperative period, with an average half-life of 22 [*]h. CONCLUSIONS: Administration of clonidine as an adjuvant to conventional retrobulbar block is safe, and delays the postoperative use of analgesics. The reduction of postoperative pain and the time of first use of analgesic medication, however, were not significantly different between groups. Further, pain scores in both study groups remained low. Therefore, the beneficial effect of clonidine in conventional scleral buckle surgery appears to be limited...|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE: To {{report the}} {{anatomic}} and functional results of primary vitrectomy without scleral buckling {{for the treatment}} of pseudophakic rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (PsRD). DESIGN: Prospective, nonrandomized surgical technique study. METHODS: One hundred eyes of 98 patients with PsRD were operated by vitrectomy alone. Internal subretinal fluid drainage, <b>cryocoagulation</b> and/or endolaser and fluid-air exchange with sulfur hexafluoride 20 % was applied in all cases. The preoperative and postoperative characteristics were analyzed. Main outcome measures were anatomic success rates after initial surgical intervention and after reoperation for primary failures, visual outcome at the last follow-up visit, and complications. RESULTS: Mean follow-up +/- standard deviation (SD) was 12 +/- 6. 3 months (range, seven to 36 months). Mean final visual acuity +/- SD was 0. 42 +/- 0. 45 logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution (logMAR) compared with 0. 95 +/- 0. 73 logMAR before surgery (P <. 01). Mean number +/- SD of retinal breaks found before surgery was 1. 36 +/- 1. 12 (range, zero to five), and an additional 1. 58 +/- 2. 26 (range, zero to 15) retinal breaks were found during surgery. The retina was reattached successfully after a single surgery in 92 eyes (92 %). Recurrence of retinal detachment occurred in eight eyes (8 %), caused by proliferative vitreoretinopathy in six eyes (75 %) and by new breaks in two eyes (25 %). Final anatomic reattachment was obtained in these cases after a mean of 1. 75 subsequent operations. Three eyes required permanent silicone oil tamponade so that final anatomic success was achieved in 97 eyes (97 %). The most common postoperative complication was ocular hypertonia of more than 21 mm Hg, observed in 36 (36 %) eyes, which was managed successfully.

To characterize the features of the course and to identify the most effective methods of preventing adenoviral EKC of children during the first months of life who are on care and treatment in NICU. Adenoviral EKC is diagnosed in 284 children aged from 2 days to 3 months, who are on nursing in perinatal centers of Moscow. In 165 children with EKC retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) was noted. The course of adenoviral EKC in children {{in the age of the}} first months was accompanied by eyelids edema and conjunctiva edema, the formation of membranes (49. 3 %), hemorrhages (69. 7 %), corneal edema (30. 3 %), and absence of folliculosis of the eyelid conjunctiva. Cornea infiltrates occurred in 1. 9 % of cases and always disappeared in 1 — 2 weeks. after appearance. The development of adenoviral EKC in premature infants against the background of ROP complicates its course. Carrying out laser coagulation in children with ROP against the background of adenoviral EKC is safe and causes the same effect as in children without conjunctivitis.

40|$|Background. Eye {{injuries}} {{constitute a}} leading problem in eye surgery worldwide, {{as well as}} at our department. Their treatment is very complex, and requires a wide surgical knowledge and surgical skills supported by the material and the equipment. Aim. To analyze the results of vitreoretinal surgery on 647 patients with severe penetrating eye injuries in the period from 1991 to 1998. Methods. The study included a retrospective analysis of the treatment of 647 injuries, out of which 500 were penetrating, and 147 were severe contusion injuries. Attention was payed to the penetrating injuries with intraocular foreign body (IOFB), to the number of the performed pars plana vitrectomies (VPP), to the number of the extirpated foreign bodies, {{as well as to the}} number of the conventional retinal ablation surgeries. Also significant proved the consequences of contusion injuries, and the method of their complete surgical management - the surgery combined with the implantation of intraocular lens, as well as their functional results. Results. Inside the said period, 558 VPPs were performed, 60 conventional retinal ablation surgeries, and 29 combined anterior/posterior segment surgeries. VPP was applied in 286 (51. 3 %) of the cases with penetrating injuries with IOFB, and in 58 (10. 4 %) of the cases with contusion injuries. VPP in one eye was applied in 464 (83 %) of the cases, in both eyes in 65 (11. 8 %) of the cases, and in a single eye in 29 (5. 2 %) of the cases. Following VPP, silicone oil tamponade was done in 352 (63 %) of the cases, air tamponade in 123 (22 %) of the cases, and Ringer-BSS tamponade in 83 (15 %) of the cases. Laser photocoagulation (LFC) was performed in 484 (87 %) of the cases, <b>cryocoagulation</b> in 45 (8 %), while neither of them was done in 29 (5 %) of the cases. In all of the cases of the conventional retinal ablation (n = 60), a placement of a serclage was applied and exocryocoagulation was performed, while in the 52 cases a placement of a scleral flap was applied. Combined surgery - lensectomy, VPP, and an anterior chamber intraocular lens (AC IOL), was applied in 16 of the cases, and phacoemulsification, VPP and a posterior chamber intraocular lens (PC IOL) in 13 of the cases. Conclusion. Vitrectomy was the most frequently applied surgery in solving the complex eye injuries. The eye injuries treated in our department were with the IOFB, and the retinal ablation. The IOFBs in our patients were almost completely extirpated. The applied combined anterior/posterior segment surgeries had the potential to safely and successfully condense those separate procedures in one surgery. A relatively high incidence of endophthalmitis was recorded in the injuries treated in our department...|$|E
