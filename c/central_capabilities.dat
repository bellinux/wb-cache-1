Taking advantage of emergence refers to grabbing the inherently fragmented and noisy information that abounds in complex eco-systems, configuring information bits into potential solutions for concrete problems, and using these configurations to learn about what might work, what else seems relevant, and how to reframe ideas to accumulate more noisy bits of information into better and better solutions.|$|R

50|$|Gender {{plays an}} {{important}} role in the spread of HIV. Young women are more likely than men to contract HIV in the Caribbean, and most of these women are between 24-44 years old. In developing countries in general, women are at an extreme disadvantage in terms of the prevention and treatment of HIV. The gender hierarchies found within many societies contributes to the correlation of women and HIV. One of the factors that put women most at risk is sexual violence. The first sexual experience of a girl is often forced, and during unprotected vaginal intercourse, women are more likely than men to contract HIV, because HIV-infected semen has a higher viral concentration than vaginal secretions. The Capability Approach, outlined by Nussbaum's <b>Central</b> <b>Capabilities,</b> lists bodily health and bodily integrity as crucial components of human dignity, and both of these are violated in the case of HIV transmission through rape. Furthermore, sexual relations between older men and younger women during transactional sex possibly explain why more teenage girls than boys are HIV-positive in the Caribbean.|$|E

40|$|Whatever ethical stance {{one takes}} in the debate {{regarding}} the ethics of human enhancement, one or more reference points are required to assess its morality. Some have suggested looking at the bioethical notions of safety, justice, and/or autonomy to find such reference points. Others, arguing that those notions are limited with respect to assessing the morality of human enhancement, have turned to human nature, human authenticity, or human dignity as reference points, thereby introducing some perfectionist assumptions into the debate. In this article, we ask which perfectionist assumptions {{should be used in}} this debate. After a critique of views that are problematic, we take a positive approach, suggesting some perfectionist elements that can lend guidance to the practice of human enhancement, {{based on the work of}} Martha Nussbaum's Capability Approach. We suggest that the <b>central</b> <b>capabilities</b> can be used to define the human aspect of human enhancement and thereby allow a moral evaluation of enhancement interventions. These <b>central</b> <b>capabilities</b> can be maximized harmoniously to postulate what an ideal human would look like. Ultimately, the aim of this article is twofold. First, it seeks to make explicit the perfectionist assumptions found in the debate and eliminate those that are problematic. Second, the paper clarifies an element that is often neglected in the debate about human enhancement, the view of the ideal human towards which human enhancement should strive. Here, we suggest that some <b>central</b> <b>capabilities</b> that are essential for an ideal human being can be maximized harmoniously and can therefore serve as possible reference points to guide human enhancement...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{is concerned}} with the moral-philosophical dimensions of global poverty and inequality. The first chapter argues in favour of justice-based – contrasted with beneficence-based – obligations asking the wealthy to actively do something about severe poverty abroad. The distinguishing property of justice-based obligations is that they derive their high level of moral stringency from the fact that they ask the obligation-bearer to rectify for past and/or present violations of negative obligations, such as the obligation not to harm anybody (regardless of geographical distance). Partly in following and partly in reinterpreting Thomas Pogge the first chapter concludes that the current economic and political order harms the global poor by making it difficult or impossible for them to satisfy their basic needs. To the extent that better-off states (citizens and their democratically accountable governments) uphold such an unjust global order and contribute to the poor’s enduring dire straits they have obligations of justice to secure the basic needs of the poor. This is why the approach introduced and defended in this essay is called “basic needs cosmopolitanism”. 	The second chapter examines the idea of “basic needs” more detailed. Basic needs cosmopolitanism employs a specific notion of basic needs that is derived from Martha Nussbaum’s list of ten central human functional capabilities. These capabilities are of universal appeal, i. e. they are concerned with activities and states of being that are indispensable features of every human life. After discussing Nussbaum’s justification for the universal applicability of her list and after examining in more detail the list itself the argument distinguishes between basic needs for the material (financial, resource-related, etc.) and basic needs for the non-material (political, social, etc.) prerequisites for possessing these <b>central</b> <b>capabilities.</b> Both groups of basic needs have to be satisfied by a sufficient quality and quantity in order for a society to count as being able to meet its citizens basic needs and as being able to secure all its citizens’ <b>central</b> <b>capabilities.</b> The crucial idea is that if Nussbaum’s <b>central</b> <b>capabilities</b> are presented as having universal appeal, the related basic needs are of global applicability as well. The standard of material and non-material prerequisites is applied to a) the question of whether and to what extent the global order harms the poor and b) the question of what and how much material transfers from the wealthy to the poor are required on grounds of justice. 	Since this dissertation’s topic is global distributive justice the primary focus of this argument lies on the material pre-requisites that have to be available in order to secure <b>central</b> <b>capabilities</b> for all. This does not imply that the non-material basic needs for living in a society ruled by just and stable political and social institutions are less important. A complete version of basic needs cosmopolitanism will have to dedicate equal consideration to obligations of justice related to the global order’s responsibility for poor countries’ lack of the non-material prerequisites. The notion of “potential functionings”, introduced in concluding this essay, is supposed to underline the importance of securing <b>central</b> <b>capabilities</b> for all members of poor societies and expresses again basic needs cosmopolitanism’s commitment to identifying universal minimal standards of social and economic global justice...|$|E
30|$|An {{approach}} that takes these issues {{of power and}} social inequality into account is the capabilities approach. In her book Creating Capabilities, Martha Nussbaum states that the capability approach ‘takes each person as an end, asking about the opportunities available to each person. It {{is focused on the}} choice of freedom’ (Nussbaum 2011, 18). Nussbaum describes capabilities as the ability to use opportunities and choose which ones to use. She describes ten key capabilities (ibid., 33 – 34) and states that ‘an ample threshold of ten <b>central</b> <b>capabilities</b> is required’ (ibid., 32).|$|E
40|$|Nussbaum's {{capabilities}} {{approach is}} based on a universalistic account of central human functionings. She claims that if <b>central</b> human <b>capabilities</b> are located within a particular kind of political liberalism, then they can become specific political goals and the object of an overlapping consensus among people who otherwise have very different comprehensive conceptions of the good. This paper reconsiders these arguments on the basis of fieldwork conducted among migrant women living in squatter settlements of Istanbul. By going through Nussbaum's list of <b>central</b> human <b>capabilities,</b> I elaborate their relevance in terms of the existing, stated and desired capabilities of these women. In doing so, I underline the importance of thinking about capabilities in relational terms and challenge the concept “autonomous agency”. I also demonstrate the (im) possibility of separating the political and non-political realms, particularly in issues regarding religion and family, and argue for the need to redefine the boundaries of the political within the capability framework.

40|$|In this article, I {{juxtapose}} David Harvey’s {{idea of the}} ‘right to the city’ and Martha Nussbaum’s <b>central</b> human <b>capability</b> of ‘control over one’s environment’, and I {{approach them}} {{from the perspective of}} their mutual convergence on Marx’s conception of human significance. In particular, I compare how Marx’s conception reverberates in Harvey’s right to the city as human right and in Nussbaum’s control over the environment as <b>central</b> human <b>capability.</b> I discuss how the language of capabilities through which the latter scholar articulates her political liberalism offers ‘important supplementations’ to the language of human rights through which the former scholar articulates his critical discourse. I conclude that the evaluative character of Nussbaum’s capability approach could advance a novel stream in planning theory centred on human development. To elaborate on such potential, I propose the notion of people’s ‘urban functionings’, and I discuss how this notion could provide new interpretative lenses through which to renew the idea of ‘right to the city’...|$|R
40|$|The {{capabilities}} {{approach has}} attracted broad interest in environmental ethics. One very interesting application is the environmental or extended capabilities approach which promotes {{the notion of}} environmental capabilities {{that contribute to the}} flourishing of non-human beings and ecological systems. The approach however lacks any account of the capabilities of ecological systems. This essay applies the environmental capabilities approach at the ecosystem level and examines how the flourishing of an ecosystem can be understood in terms of capabilities. Ecosystem flourishing presumes the ability of a given system to maintain its characteristic functions, diversity and quality, and do so {{even in the face of}} various disturbances. Resilience can be understood as a <b>central</b> <b>capability</b> of ecosystems to maintain their characteristic functioning in disruptive circumstances, which is particularly important with regard to human-induced environmental changes.

In {{order to}} claim fully general {{intelligence}} in an autonomous agent, {{the ability to}} learn {{is one of the}} most <b>central</b> <b>capabilities.</b> Classical machine learning techniques have had many significant empirical successes, but large real-world problems that are of interest to generally intelligent agents require learning much faster (with much less training experience) than is currently possible. This paper presents transfer learning, where knowledge from a learned task can be used to significantly speed up learning in a novel task, as the key to achieving the learning capabilities necessary for general intelligence. In addition to motivating the need for transfer learning in an intelligent agent, we introduce a novel method for selecting types of tasks to be used for transfer and empirically demonstrate that such a selection can lead to significant increases in training speed in a two-player game...|$|E

The aim {{of this study was to}} determine the experiences of, and need for, education of these health professionals. Methods Interviews and focus groups were conducted with 31 health professionals with some experience in providing palliative care for people with MND. Thematic content analysis was used to identify common themes. Results A key theme, Just One Step Ahead, emerged, that describes the <b>central</b> <b>capability</b> health professionals identified as necessary to help individuals plan and prepare for disease and lifestyle changes just before they arise. Two subthemes also emerged: Expertise in MND and Bespoke Communication. Expertise in MND described the required understanding of the disease and the particular individual's version of the disease to allow the health professional to plan, advise, support and anticipate the needs of the person living with MND. Bespoke Communication was the facility to tailor care messages sensitively and effectively to the range of people involved in care (patients, family, healthcare team members). Conclusions Care of people with MND requires up-to-date expertise about the disease and skilled communication abilities to manage complexity and change. Timely and focused education and specialist MND support for care providers are essential to tailored and responsive care and a widely available education programme has been developed to address these needs...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{suggests}} {{an account of}} sufficientarianism—that is, that justice is fulfilled when everyone has enough—laid out within a general framework of the capability approach. In doing so, it seeks to show that sufficiency is especially plausible as an ideal of social justice when constructed around key capabilitarian insights such as freedom, pluralism, and attention to empirical interconnections between <b>central</b> <b>capabilities.</b> Correspondingly, we elaborate on how a framework for evaluating social justice would look when constructed in this way and give reasons for why capabilitarians should embrace sufficientarianism. We do this by elaborating on how capabilitarian values underpin sufficiency. On this basis, we identify three categories of central capabilities; those related to biological and physical needs, those to fundamental interests of a human agent, and those to fundamental interests of a social being. In each category, we argue, achieving sufficiency requires different distributional patterns {{depending on how the}} capabilities themselves work and interrelate. This argument adds a new dimension to the way capabilitarians think about social justice and changes how we should target instances of social justice from social-political viewpoint...|$|E
40|$|This chapter {{examines}} {{the relation of}} the Human Development or Capability Approach to liberal political theory. If development is enhancement of capabilities, then this chapter adds that development is human and social: development includes (1) the creation of value as a social process that is (2) a dialectical product of people in their relations. Specifically: (1) The place of the individual within political theory must be revised if the political subject is, as Carol Gould argues, an “individual-in-relations” rather than an autonomous individual agent. (2) New possibilities for valuation are also relational: value is created dialectically along with those possibilities through processes that may be modeled on Denis Goulet’s account of dialectical recognition. These axiological claims hold importance for the place of democratic participation in just politics and development. Building upon David Crocker’s work, this chapter argues that just politics may require a participative approach that is undercut by Martha Nussbaum’s suggestion that a list of <b>central</b> <b>capabilities</b> should guide the drafting of national constitutions. The assimilation of the indigenous concept sumak kawsay to the ideal of buen vivir within Ecuador’s constitution is illustrative, suggesting that prior specification (a list) may limit and distort the dialectical generation of new capabilities...|$|E
40|$|Proponents of the {{capabilities}} approach {{claim that it}} should be used to give guidance for the implementation of good constitutional laws. This suggests that it also gives us grounds to support attempts to create or protect constitutions based on something like {{the capabilities}} approach. The Turkish Republic claims that in order to protect secularism and the equal status of women, it needs to keep certain Islamic practices away from the public domain. The wearing of the headscarf has been singled out as such a practice, and the Turkish Republic has therefore legislated against headscarf wearing in schools, universities, and government buildings. In consequence many women are forced to choose between religion over education and politics in a way that curtails central human capabilities. Nussbaum claims {{that the best way to}} help states resolve the dilemma presented by the conflict between religious choice and other <b>central</b> <b>capabilities</b> is to refer to principles embodied in to the US Religious Freedom Restoration Act 1993, which states that a law can burden a person's exercise of religion only when the burden is a furtherance of a compelling state interest.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a theory of}} the syntactic aspects of human sentence production. An important characteristic of unprepared speech is that overt pronunciation of a sentence can be initiated before the speaker has completely worked out the meaning content {{he or she is}} going to express in that sentence. Apparently, the speaker is able to build up a syntactically coherent utterance out of a series of syntactic fragments each rendering a new part of the meaning content. This incremental, left-to-right mode of sentence production is the <b>central</b> <b>capability</b> of the proposed Incremental Procedural Grammar (IPG). Certain other properties of spontaneous speech, as derivable from speech errors, hesitations, self-repairs, and language pathology, are accounted for as well. The psychological plausibility thus gained by the grammar appears compatible with a satisfactory level of linguistic plausibility in that sentences receive structural descriptions which are in line with current theories of grammar. More importantly, an explanation for the existence of configurational conditions on transformations and other linguistics rules is proposed. The basic design feature of IPG which gives rise to these psychologically and linguistically desirable properties, is the “Procedures + Stack” concept. Sentences are built not by a central constructing agency which overlooks the whole process but by a team of syntactic procedures (modules) which work-in parallel-on small parts of the sentence, have only a limited overview, and whose sole communication channel is a stock. IPG covers object complement constructions, interrogatives, and word order in main and subordinate clauses. It handles unbounded dependencies, cross-serial dependencies and coordination phenomena such as gapping and conjunction reduction. It is also capable of generating self-repairs and elliptical answers to questions. IPG has been implemented as an incremental Dutch sentence generator written in LISP...|$|R
