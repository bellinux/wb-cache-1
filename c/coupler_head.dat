2500|$|The chief {{competitor}} of {{both these}} couplers, more popular among serious modellers, was the Magne-Matic, a magnetically released knuckle coupler developed by Keith and Dale Edwards, and manufactured by Kadee, a company they started. While they closely resemble miniature Janney couplers, they are somewhat different mechanically, with the knuckle pivoting {{from the center}} of the <b>coupler</b> <b>head,</b> rather than from the side. A steel pin, designed to resemble an air brake hose, allows the couplers to be released magnetically; the design of the <b>coupler</b> <b>head</b> prevents this from happening unless the train is stopped or reversed with a mated pair of couplers directly over an uncoupling magnet. An earlier, mechanically tripped version of the design had a straight pin extending down from the knuckle itself, which engaged a diamond-shaped mechanical [...] "ramp" [...] between the rails, which had to be raised above rail height when uncoupling was desired.|$|E
50|$|With {{gooseneck}} couplers or offset shank couplers, {{the horizontal}} {{centerline of the}} <b>coupler</b> <b>head</b> is above the horizontal centerline of the coupler shank, or shaft, and the draw gear. This arrangement is designed for use with low-floor freight cars, to lift the <b>coupler</b> <b>head</b> high enough to match the couplers on other rolling stock. The large bogie boxvans for car parts, used on the Victorian Railways, were fitted with gooseneck couplers for that reason.|$|E
50|$|The vans were {{fitted with}} the same {{low-level}} aligned bogies as the FCW class of flat wagon (previously FCF); wagons within the W bogie class could be bogie-exchanged, but only within that group which indicated a low-level design to accommodate the taller loads. The lower underframe also necessitated gooseneck-type couplers, designed to lift the <b>coupler</b> <b>head</b> high enough to match the couplers on other rolling stock. The horizontal center line of the coupler shank, or shaft, and of the draw gear are {{lower than that of}} the <b>coupler</b> <b>head.</b>|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the construction and}} working principles of an intelligent fiber-optic intensity sensor used for examining the concentration of a mixture in conjunction with water. It can find applications e. g. in waste-water treatment plant for selection of a treatment process. The sensor head {{is the end of}} a large core polymer optical fiber, which constitutes one arm of an asymmetrical <b>coupler.</b> The <b>head</b> works on the reflection intensity basis. The reflected signal level depends on the Fresnel reflection from the air and from the mixture examined when the head is immersed in it. The sensor head is mounted on a lift. For detection purposes the signal can be measured on head submerging, submersion, emerging and emergence. Therefore, the measured signal depends on the surface tension, viscosity, turbidity and refraction coefficient of the solution. The signal coming from the head is processed electrically in an opto-electronic interface. Then it is fed to a neural network. The novelty of the proposed sensor lies in that it contains an asymmetrical coupler and a neural network that works in the generalization mode. The sensor resolution depends on the efficiency of the asymmetrical coupler, the precision of the opto-electronic signal conversion and the learning accuracy of the neural network. Therefore, the number and quality of the points used for the learning process is very important. By way of example, the paper describes a sensor intended for examining the concentration of liquid soap in water...|$|R

50|$|The central {{problem was}} how to design a machine that was light enough for road {{movement}} and yet heavy enough to start and stop railcars. Hartelius' solution to this engineering dilemma: borrow weight from coupled railcars to increase the vehicle weight for traction. He designed a <b>coupler</b> <b>head</b> that could be operated from the driver's seat, and that would raise hydraulically to lift the railcar, transferring up to 49,000 lbs (22,680 kg) to {{the wheels of the}} vehicle.|$|E
