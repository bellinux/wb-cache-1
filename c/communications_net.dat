The IAF {{took advantage of the}} fact that the MiGs had only nose and tail alert radar systems and no side warnings or look-up and look-down systems, by jamming the GCI <b>communications</b> <b>net.</b> E-2Cs guided the Israeli aircraft into positions that enabled them to attack the Syrian aircraft from the side, where the latter would have no warning. Because of the jamming, the Syrians GCI controllers could not direct their pilots toward the incoming Israeli aircraft. The Sparrow missiles attacked at speeds of Mach 3.5 at ranges of 14 to 25 miles, which meant that they were not only outside the Syrians' radar range but also outside their visual range.

The proposed architecture features {{a very high}} data processing rate as well as excellent error correction capability. The proposed six-iteration concatenated BCH code structure with a block interleaving methods allows the decoder to achieve 9. 19 dB net coding gain performance at 10 - 15 decoder output bit error rate to compensate for serious transmission quality degradation. Also, the proposed high-speed concatenated BCH decoder architecture was implemented to support 100 Gb/s data processing rate. Thus, it has potential applications in next generation forward error correction schemes for 100 Gb/s long-haul optical communications.

40|$|This {{review is}} divided into three sections: {{technologies}} for monitoring physiological parameters; biosensors for chemical assays and wireless communications technologies including image transmissions. Applications range from monitoring high risk patients for heart, respiratory activity and falls to sensing levels of physical activity in military, rescue, and sports personnel. The range of measurements include, heart rate, pulse wave form, respiratory rate, blood oxygen, tissue pCO 2, exhaled carbon dioxide and physical activity. Other feasible measurements will employ miniature chemical laboratories on silicon or plastic chips. The measurements can be extended to clinical chemical assays ranging from common blood assays to protein or specialized protein measurements (e. g., troponin, creatine, and cytokines such as TNF and IL 6).

40|$|Consideration of four {{possible}} grand computing {{challenges in}} sociology suggests that progress {{will come from}} wholly fresh approaches, rather than from mere improve-ments in current kinds of social science computing. Although it will be useful to access ordinary libraries over the future universal <b>communications</b> <b>net,</b> placing conventional sociological data sets on it will accomplish little. More valuable would be development of technologies that would allow social scientists far greater access to data already collected by government and industry while protecting the confidential-ity of information about individuals. Especially exciting would be automatic systems to read data from hand-written records like the massive historical censuses of the 19 th century. In nearly every area of social science, artificial social intelligence {{has the potential to}} revolutionize research and theory. Keywords: computing, sociology, networks, government data sets, U.

If there are grand challenges for computing in the social sciences, {{they are not going to}} involve mere improvements in the kind of machine-assisted data analysis sociologists have been doing for three decades. The real grand challenges are to take quantitative analysis to a whole new level of achievement and-even more grand-to find radically new ways of thinking based on as-yet-unachieved capabil-ities of future computing technology. Thus, I am skeptical about the &dquo;more-is-better&dquo; philosophy that tells social scientists to migrate onto supercomputers and plug into Internet. To be sure, many good things may come from these in-creases in raw computing power and access to data. But imagination and the search for other directions of achievement are more impor-tant.

A diesel generator set with constant speed governor and static exciter runs to build up and dominate the main AC bus. An ultra-capacitor unit suppresses fast-varying power fluctuations, and the battery shares part of the slow-varying power component. The diesel generator set only provides slow-varying power within a lower limit, which can avoid dramatic accelerations and decelerations and low load-rate operation. Finally, simulations on MATLAB/Simulink are carried out to verify the proposed strategy in typical scenarios.|$|R
