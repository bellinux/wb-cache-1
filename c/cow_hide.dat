25|$|The {{initiation}} {{into these}} Nnukwu-Ozo titles was and still is, very expensive. Historically, the initiation ceremony into {{the secrets of}} the Nnukwu-Ozo involved the very painful and prestigious Ichi scarification, by which these men were identified in public. The Ichi scarification as part of the ritual has been discontinued in modern times for aesthetic reasons. The last bearer of Ichi marks, Chief Ezenwosu died in the early twentieth century. Other distinctive pieces of regalia that identify the Ozo title holder and the Nnukwu-Ozo title holder in Awka-Etiti are the red cap (with eagle feathers for the Nnukwu-Ozo), the horse tail fly whisk, the round <b>cow</b> <b>hide</b> fan and the elephant tusk.|$|E
25|$|Task Review: Alpha wisely {{spent their}} time {{sourcing}} items before setting off, but had initial difficulties {{when they arrived}} at the market. However, they managed to collect all ten items without penalties, with Helene and Raef bargaining well for the <b>cow</b> <b>hide</b> and obtaining a second-hand Santos orange juicer in the last few minutes, despite buying it for a fair price. Meanwhile, Renaissance's execution of the task was a shambles, as Jennifer paid little attention to the dossiers, deciding to straight to the market and thus resulting in the team being disorganised and making mistakes, such as buying the wrong colour of mosque alarm clock, while Jenny and Michael attempted to bribe a sports store so to sabotage Alpha's efforts. The team effectively lost the task due to a combination of these mistakes, and the fines they received for purchasing unbranded tajines and a halal chicken instead of a kosher chicken.|$|E

40|$|The {{aim of the}} {{research}} was to make use of <b>cow</b> scrotum <b>hides</b> to be raw material in leathergood manufacturing. Forty five pieces of scrotum hides were tanned to crust leather using subsequently 6 %, 8 % and 10 % mineral tanning agent; 15 %, 20 % and 25 % vegetable tanning agent; 15 %, 20 % and 25 % synthetic tanning agent. The physical test results indicated that scrotum <b>cow</b> <b>hides</b> were able to be made use as raw material in leathergood manufacturing. The best tensile strength value was achieved by those tanned with mineral tanning agent 10 % (175, 33 kg/cm 2) and the best elongation at break was achieved by those tanned with synthetic tanning agent 15 % (41, 00 %). Where as by using vegetable tanning agent, no single sample fulfilled the requirements of SNI. 06 - 0253 - 1989, Quality and Testing method for Glaced Kid Leather...|$|R

This success {{did not go}} smoothly: the employment in great numbers of the best workers by Montgolfier caused a scarcity of labor and demands for wage increases. There was a strike for two months in the Vidalon Workshop in late 1781 after {{a long period of}} tension between the employer and his employees, the first lost the best of his workforce through his intransigent attitude at a time when fights between gavots and journeymen were common.|$|R
