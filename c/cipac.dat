5000|$|Marcos <b>Cipac</b> de Aquino (?-1572), informally {{known as}} Marcos the Indian, was a Roman Catholic Nahuatl artist in sixteenth-century Mexico, {{who may have}} been the painter of the image of the Virgin of Guadalupe. Art {{historian}} Jeanette Favrot Peterson has ventured [...] "Marcos <b>Cipac</b> (de Aquino) was the artist of the Mexican Guadalupe, capable of executing a large Marian painting on cloth within a professional milieu that was abundantly stock to stimulate his innate artistry.". The basis of her conjecture is evidence in the Anales de Juan Bautista, a manuscript housed in the Biblioteca Boturini of the Basilica of Guadalupe and translated and published in 2001. Mexican scholars of the nineteenth century posited the painting's artist as Marcos <b>Cipac</b> de Aquino, including Joaquín García Icazbalceta in his [...] "Carta acerca del Origen ce la Imagen de Nuestra Sra. de Guadalupe" [...] (1883) and Francisco del Paso y Troncoso's [...] "Noticia del indio Marcos y de otros pintores del siglo XVI" [...] (1891). [...] There is some skepticism about the identification of the painting with <b>Cipac</b> Aquino. He is identified a 1556 sermon, but referred to him only as Marcos. This sermon came to light only in 1888. Marcos de Aquino is credited with the painting also by Leoncio Garza-Valdés {{on the basis of a}} scientific investigation.|$|E

Solutions of this kind have been implemented by a number of libraries in various countries since the mid- 1990 s, mainly as inexpensive alternatives to full retrospective conversion of their old Background Since the introduction of automated library systems and of online public access catalogues in particular, one of the greatest challenges for library managers has been the transfer of older records into the OPACs. Some libraries have already achieved this goal, but many others are still far away from closing their old card, sheaf or book catalogues. Recataloguing is expensive and, therefore, normally not feasible on a large scale (Dugall 2001). However, the conversion of existing records into machine-readable records (retroconversion) is not cheap either. Studies of large conversion projects have shown that the average cost per record is between 2. 42 and 4. 23 Euros (Beyersdorff 1993; Bryant 1997; Leeves, Butler & Mealia 1999), which means that for larger projects or national programmes enormous sums of money are required.

40|$|We {{present a}} general {{holistic}} theory {{for the organization}} of complex networks, both human-engineered and naturally-evolved. Introducing concepts of value of interactions and satisfaction as generic network performance measures, we show that the underlying organizing principle is to meet an overall performance target for wide-ranging operating or environmental conditions. This design or survival requirement of reliable performance under uncertainty leads, via the maximum entropy principle, {{to the emergence of}} a power law vertex degree distribution. The theory also predicts exponential or Poisson degree distributions depending on network redundancy, thus explaining all three regimes as different manifestations of a common underlying phenomenon within a unified theoretical framework.

Evaluation of accuracy, precision, and {{trending}} {{ability of}} cardiac index (CI) measurements using the Aesculon™ bioimpedance electrical cardiometry (Aesc) {{compared to the}} continuous pulmonary artery thermodilution catheter (PAC) technique before, during, and after cardiac surgery. Methods. A prospective observational study with fifty patients with ASA 3 - 4. At six time points (T), measurements of CI simultaneously by continuous cardiac output pulmonary thermodilution and thoracic bioimpedance and standard hemodynamics were performed. Analysis was performed using Bland-Altman, four-quadrant plot, and polar plot methodology. Results. CI obtained with pulmonary artery thermodilution and thoracic bioimpedance ranged from 1. 00 to 6. 75 [*]L[*]min− 1 and 0. 93 to 7. 25 [*]L[*]min− 1, respectively. Bland-Altman analysis showed a bias between CIBIO and <b>CIPAC</b> of 0. 52 liters min− 1 [*]m− 2, with LOA of [− 2. 2; 1. 1] liters min− 1 [*]m− 2.

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to {{determine}} the surface tension and suspensibility of spray liquids of fungicides (Quadris and Dithane M- 70), insecticides (Actara WG- 25 and Cipkord EC- 20) and two and/or three component mixtures with non-pesticide substances (complex fertilizer - Mortonjic plus and adjuvant - Sillwet L- 77), depending on water quality. For this work the following waters were used: well water from Bečej (slightly alkaline, slightly soft), well water from Adice (slightly alkaline, very hard), tap water from Novi Sad (neutral, slightly hard) and surface water from Sava and Karaš rivers (slightly alkaline, slightly hard). Surface tension of fungicide and insecticide spray liquids and their mixtures in mentioned waters was determined using tensiometer and suspensibility according to a standard method (<b>CIPAC</b> MT 15). The surface tension of all tested waters was high. However, the reduction of surface tension by 50 % (or more in water from Sava river) compared to the control waters, was achieved by adding the adjuvant (Sillwet L- 77) and insecticide formulated as emulsifiable concentrate (Cipkord EC- 20). Surface tension was slightly decreased in a single component spray liquids of fungicides and the complex fertilizer, as well as in mixtures that did not contain adjuvant and/or Cipkord EC- 20, regardless on water quality. Suspensibility of all spray liquids, regardless on tested water was above the lower limit (60 %). In general, the suspensibility all mixtures containing Dithane M- 70 was reduced compared to Dithane M- 70 spray liquid, in all tested waters. The most pronounced decrease in suspensibility, below 70 %, was registered in the case of spray liquids with tap water, compared to others (99. 8 %).
