40|$|Career {{development}} for <b>corporate</b> <b>researchers</b> is of growing importance for at knowledge intensive firms, as skills, {{knowledge and the}} innovative efforts of well-developed <b>corporate</b> <b>researchers</b> may enhance their performance {{of research and development}} (R & D). Several scholars of human resource management have recently raised the question of what career {{development for}} <b>corporate</b> <b>researchers</b> will lead {{to the development of the}} organizational capabilities requisite to firm-level R & D (Farris & Corredo, 2002; Jones & Lichtenstein, 2000). Traditionally, many scholars and practitioners have argued that the dual career, or dual ladder, system – with both managerial and technical path – matches the career development needs of <b>corporate</b> <b>researchers</b> and keeps their careers from plateauing (Baugh & Roberts, 1994; Tucker et al., 1994). However, there are several problems with the dual ladder system regarding to corporate researchers’ career development, not only because the technical path may be isolated and, unequal to the managerial path (Allen & Katz, 1986; Farris & Corredo, 2002; Igbaria et al., 1999), but also because researchers’ career paths become more dynamic and varied than it allows for. As DeFillipi & Arthur (1994) argue, that the concept of career competencies can shed lights on the relationships between cumulative career development and continuous organizational capability building. Assuming the actual situation that R & D departments are multi-project organizations and an increasing number of researchers, unlike technical experts on technical paths, experience several projects in their project-oriented careers, firms need many researchers with technical competence and basic project management skills. This paper attempts to examine whether, in terms of career competencies, firms desire for many of their researchers to develop such individual competencies through a career development process. This paper is divided into following four parts. First, reexamining the above argument regarding the dual ladder system, we are critical of its focus mainly on career orientation and satisfaction of <b>corporate</b> <b>researchers,</b> and its ignorance of dynamics that could multiply their career paths. Second, assuming that the concept of career contingencies reveals to us what individual contingencies firms demand to build organizational capability, firms may encourage many researchers to acquire appropriate technical competence and basic project management competence, responding to the increasing needs for project leaders and staffs. Third, using the case studies of nine pharmaceutical firms based in Japan, we will examine how their actual career path systems work and how these firms need and develop a mixture of technical and managerial competence to contribute to research projects. Finally, we will conclude that firms need specific career contingencies for <b>corporate</b> <b>researchers</b> to run multi-project organizations, and that they are attempting to develop them through their career management systems...|$|R

40|$|University-industry {{knowledge}} transfer is nowadays a very fashionable research subject, both in economics, and in management and policy studies. "Distance" {{between the two}} realms of academic and industrial research has been increasingly called in to explain the extent at which the academic research benefits (or should benefit) the industrial R&D. In particular, empirical research has focussed on two concepts of "distance": geographical and cognitive. However, both kinds of proximity favour industrial R&D performance insofar they are facilitating factors for reducing social distance between academic and industrial researchers, which result in the exchange of knowledge through codified means or the mobility of researchers. We suggest that both classic and more recent contributions to the economics of knowledge, {{as well as most}} of the empirical research on the contribution of universities to commercial innovation, imply or openly suggest a number of propositions on social networks, both of <b>corporate</b> <b>researchers</b> and academic scientists, as well as of researchers from both communities. We also suggest that testing those propositions requires the identification of social links among <b>corporate</b> <b>researchers,</b> which in turn calls for data on personal acquaintances and the application of tools taken from social network analysis. We then describe the results of our data collection efforts in that direction (the EPO-INV and EPO-INV-DOC databases), and a few exploratory findings.

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} {{presented}} in this thesis is to explore to what extent <b>corporate</b> <b>researchers</b> {{in the field of}} industrial Life Science & Technology (LST) can consider social and ethical aspects of LST innovation to improve their Research and Development (R&D) practices. Innovators, particularly those working in controversial scientific and technology fields such as industrial LST, are encouraged to adopt socially responsible innovation methods. This requires that researchers, who work in such fields, consider the broader social and ethical context of their R&D activities. This thesis explores first how <b>corporate</b> <b>researchers</b> can integrate such aspects in their daily work and how this could improve their work. Second it investigates whether such integration leads to a quantitatively assessable improvement of the quality of R&D work. The results indicate that integration is possible, and leads to a measurable improvement of the quality of R&D work. In addition, researchers see a number of improvements in their R&D work, e. g. in the quality of communication and cooperation, and how to link their own work to corporate strategies and marketing. This thesis can be useful for innovators who wish to enhance socially responsible innovation practices, as it presents a tool that allows for the operationalisation of socially responsible innovation for R&D management and improved R&D performance.

30|$|Managers within {{firms have}} to make design {{decisions}} across {{a considerable number of}} dimensions—e.g., which organization design to adopt (Adler 1995), which opportunities to pursue (Foss et al. 2015), and how to group individuals in specialized units (Siggelkow 2011). Once these decisions are made, teams are expected to interact according to certain designed task interdependence. <b>Corporate</b> <b>researchers</b> are for example expected to interact closely with product developers who use their research to further develop existing or create new products. The expected behavior by organization design, however, is often not observed. To shed light on this problem, we focus on the relationship between two forms of interdependence. The first type derives from the organization design and allocation of tasks to different teams, referred to as “task interdependence” (Thompson 1967). The second derives from the degree to whether and how teams perceive any interdependence to exist between them which we refer to as “social interdependence” (e.g., Deutsch 1949). In the following two paragraphs, we elaborate on each respective form of interdependence.|$|R

40|$|In {{early stages}} of design and modeling, {{computers}} and computer applications are often considered an obstacle, rather than a facilitator of the process.

However, tribal governments and other indigenous decision-making bodies that should be integrally involved in critiques and/or conceptualization of research affecting indigenous peoples and resources have been largely silent in genetics debates. This has hindered analyses that are culturally and politically-specific to affected tribes and groups. This paper argues that the political and cultural priorities of tribes and other indigenous peoples can be better protected if tribal governments, other indigenous decision-making bodies, and those with tribally-specific cultural authority are aided in coming to the fore of genetics debates. As an effective complement to more pan-indigenous advocacy work, NGOs can aid the cause by providing basic education and technical assistance to indigenous peoples as well as organising and co-hosting forums that facilitate tribal-specific cultural analyses of genetic research efforts and technology development...|$|R
