Temperature has a stronger influence on a SiGe chan 1 nel PMOS than a Si-channel PMOS.

30|$|An {{alternative}} approach, {{still in}} the experimental stage, {{is the use of}} photoelectrolytic systems that combine the functions of light <b>collection,</b> <b>charge</b> separation, and electrolysis in a single cell. This is achieved by replacing {{one or both of the}} metallic electrodes in a conventional electrolysis cell with a semiconductor. The advantage of this approach is that it offers opportunities to minimize cost by eliminating redundant support structures and energy losses associated with cell interconnections. At the same time, it has been difficult to simultaneously achieve high conversion efficiencies and long-term operating stability, given that the semiconductors offering the highest efficiencies are susceptible to corrosion during cell operation. Several recent advances address these limitations. These include: (1) combining the PV and electrolysis cells into a single integrated tandem photoelectrochemical (PEC) cell, with theoretical solar-to-hydrogen conversion efficiencies of 31.1 % at one Sun illumination [38], (2) protecting the semiconductors in PEC cells from corrosion [39], (3) introducing low-cost Earth-abundant catalysts [40], and (4) improving active area and optical absorptivity through the use of nanostructuring or nanowires [41]. These options are described in the next sections.|$|E
30|$|Since the {{generated}} excitons (upon light absorption) have a {{diffusion length}} of ~ 10  nm, the bilayer configuration {{will have to}} limit the thickness of each active layer less than 20  nm for an effective charge carrier collection. This, on the contrary, will restrict the light absorption. A solution is to build an interconnected network of quantum dot and conjugated polymer called “bulk heterojunction” structure. In such kind of structure, donor and acceptor domains have the range close to the exciton diffusion distance so that most excitons can reach the donor and acceptor interface in a thicker device. Meanwhile, percolation pathways are required in both donor and acceptor domains for charge carriers to be transported in each individual domain. An interconnected network meeting the two requirements could achieve better light <b>collection,</b> <b>charge</b> separation, and transportation in a much thicker device than bilayer structure device. Devices with bulk heterojunction structures have better device performance reported. The best material system utilizes CdSe nanorod and P 3 HT and has achieved higher power conversion efficiency.|$|E

The transient simulation is used to investigate the charge collection performance by swamping the detector with a uniform concentration of EHPs (75 e-h pairs/mu m), chosen to give the same total number of carriers as a minimum ionising particle. Both detectors can be biased with the same voltage level of the readout circuitry in the standard 0. 35 mu m BiCMOS technology, but the standard full 3 D structure is preferred for its high <b>collection</b> <b>charge</b> which means high signal to noise ratio. Finally, the impact of a temperature (300 - 400 K) pulse with fast transition times is studied.

This makes the standard 3 D-detector favourable than the double-sided 3 D-detector in a harsh environment...|$|E
40|$|Household {{bulky waste}} {{includes}} large and heavy {{items such as}} furniture and electrical appliances. Local authorities in England provide two options for disposing of these items: a special collection service, often involving a <b>collection</b> <b>charge,</b> and HouseholdWaste Recycling Centres (HWRCs), where residents can take their waste free of charge. Local private companies and community or charitable organisations may also collect certain bulky items. In this study, 1450 householders in 3 cities across England were surveyed about {{a range of issues}} relating to the disposal of bulky items. Questionnaires were hand delivered to households pre-selected using the national Index of Multiple Deprivation in order to compare how disposal of bulky items differs with level of affluence. Sixty-five percent of householders had discarded bulky items in the 12 months prior to the survey. The principal disposal route was found to be the HWRC, with almost 60 % of residents who had discarded items using this method. Only 19 % of the householders had used the special collection services. In low-affluence areas, lower car ownership made residents more reliant on council collections of bulky items, and HWRCs were used less frequently. Householders were found to be satisfied with the collection service they had received. The study demonstrates that there is significant capacity for reuse and recycling of bulky items at a national level. Using the Waste Hierarchy, these management options are environmentally preferable to landfill, which is the widely-used disposal method at present. Where items are reused there are also social benefits for the community or charity groups involved, volunteers employed, and recipients of the items. Only the current bulky waste handlers – local authorities, can implement the logistical, and in some cases financial, solutions that are required to increase recovery in this waste stream...|$|E

The charge induced in Silicon Carbide (SiC) -Schottky Barrier Diodes (SBDs) with {{different}} epi-layer thicknesses by ion incidence was measured {{to understand the}} mechanism of heavy-ion-induced anomalous <b>charge</b> <b>collection</b> in SiC-SBDs. SiC SBD of which epitaxial-layer thicknesses is close to ion range show larger anomalous <b>charge</b> <b>collection</b> than SBD with thicker epi-layer although the former one has lower electric field than the later one.

40|$|High resolution, {{calibrated}} {{ion beam}} induced charge (IBIC) measurements from integrated circuit test structures {{have demonstrated that}} the measured <b>charge</b> <b>collection</b> in a device can exhibit significant change {{after only a few}} hundred ions/{micro}m{sup 2 } exposure, which may easily be exceeded in the initial targeting of a structure.

The effect of accumulated ion induced damage on lateral <b>charge</b> <b>collection</b> is then incorporated in the model as a decrease in the resultant diffusion length.
