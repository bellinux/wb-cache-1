According to the art critic Hugh Davies, the open mouth of the victim and the {{predator}} leaning over the <b>cross</b> <b>link</b> the painting to Rubens' Descent. The mouth in Rubens' painting is loosely opened, but in Bacon's it is taut. The main figure's legs are folded out of view and the figure's left arm is passive in Rubens' painting, but in the Bacon's painting the chimera's legs and arms are in violent motion, seemingly wildly flailing up and down.|$|E
5|$|The gilding and monumentality of the <b>cross</b> <b>link</b> {{it to the}} Byzantine tradition. Christ's static pose is {{reflective}} of this style, while the work overall incorporates newer, more naturalistic aspects. The work presents a lifelike and physically imposing depiction of the passion at Calvary. Christ is shown nearly naked: his eyes are closed, his face lifeless and defeated. His body slumps in a position contorted by prolonged agony. A graphic portrayal of human suffering, the painting is of seminal importance in art history and has influenced painters from Michelangelo, Caravaggio and Velázquez to Francis Bacon.|$|E

In the municipal transport plan published in 2007, it was stated that had the bridge been planned then, it would have received four lanes. There have also been proposals for a second bridge to be built next to the existing bridge which would allow for a four-lane motorway. Another proposals is to build the <b>Cross</b> <b>Link,</b> which would consist of two projects, a subsea road tunnel from just south of Herdla in northern Askøy eastwards to Meland, and a ferry connection from northern Askøy westwards to Øygarden. The project is planned to reduce transport times within Nordhordland, and from there to Askøy and Øygarden. It would also relieve some traffic from Bergen City Center. The Hardanger Bridge is scheduled for completion in 2013 and will then overtake the Askøy Bridge as the longest-spanned bridge in Norway.|$|E
25|$|Pre-processing helped {{enhancing}} {{the quality of}} an image by filtering and removing unnecessary noises. The minutiae based algorithm only worked effectively in 8-bit gray scale fingerprint image. A reason was that an 8-bit gray fingerprint image was a fundamental base to convert the image to 1-bit image with value 0 for ridges and value 1 for furrows. As a result, the ridges were highlighted with black color while the furrows were highlighted with white color. This process partly removed some noises in an image and helped enhance the edge detection. Furthermore, there are two more steps to improve the best quality for the input image: minutiae extraction and false minutiae removal. The minutiae extraction {{was carried out by}} applying ridge thinning algorithm which was to remove redundant pixels of ridges. As a result, the thinned ridges of the fingerprint image are marked with a unique ID so that further operation can be conducted. After the minutiae extraction step, the false minutiae removal was also necessary. The lack of the amount of ink and the <b>cross</b> <b>link</b> among the ridges could cause false minutiae that led to inaccuracy in fingerprint recognition process.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the present study}} is to prepare, characterize and to evaluate a new modified starch namely <b>cross</b> <b>linked</b> starch urea for its application in the formulation of sustained release floating tablets as rate controlling polymer. <b>Cross</b> <b>linked</b> starch urea was prepared and characterized by various physical properties and IR spectra. Sustained release floating tablets of three anti-hypertensive drugs namely Captopril, Losartan and Valsartan were formulated employing <b>cross</b> <b>Linked</b> starch Urea as rate controlling polymer and were evaluated. <b>Cross</b> <b>linked</b> starch urea prepared by gelatinizing potato starch in the presence of urea and calcium chloride was insoluble in water and aqueous fluids of acidic and alkaline pHs. <b>Cross</b> <b>linked</b> starch urea exhibited good swelling in water. The swelling index was 630. 2 %. As crosslinked starch urea is insoluble and has good swelling in water, it is considered suitable as release retarding and rate controlling matrix polymer for sustained release floating tablets. stained release tablets of (i) captopril, (ii) losartan and (iii) valsartan prepared using <b>cross</b> <b>linked</b> starch urea as matrix polymer were non disintegrating in water, acidic (pH 1. 2) and alkaline (pH 7. 4) fluids and gave slow and controlled release over longer periods of time. In each case the release rate depended on the strength or concentration of <b>cross</b> <b>linked</b> starch urea polymer in the tablets. A good linear relationship was observed between percent polymer in the matrix tablets and release rate (K 0) with all the three drugs indicating that the <b>cross</b> <b>linked</b> starch urea polymer is an efficient rate controlling polymer suitable for design of sustained release tablets. Drug release from these SR tablets was by diffusion mechanism, fickian diffusion in the case of tablets containing low percent of polymer and non fickian (anamalous) diffusion in the case of tablets containing high percent of polymer. <b>Cross</b> <b>linked</b> starch urea alone and in combination with sodium bicarbonate (gas generating agent) was found not suitable for formulation of floating tablets though it has good rate controlling effect for formulation of sustained release tablets. When <b>cross</b> <b>linked</b> starch urea was used along with bees wax (lipohilic polymer) and starch acetate (good film forming polymer) it was found suitable for formulation of floating tablets. Floating tablets formulated with <b>cross</b> <b>linked</b> starch urea (50 %) as matrix polymer, Bees wax (5 %) and starch acetate (5 %) as floating enhancers and sodium bicarbonate as gas generating agent exhibited good floating over 13 – 14 hrs with a floating lag time of 45 – 60 seconds. Drug release from these floating tablets was spread over 12 hrs with all the three drugs studied. The drug release from these tablets was by non fickian (anomalous) diffusion.

50|$|Andersen, in 1996, {{discovered}} that the tyrosine residues are involved in chemically covalent cross-links in many forms such as dityrosine, trityrosine, and tetratyrosine.

Andersen came to this conclusion based on a study involving these two compounds in which he was able to rule out other forms of <b>cross</b> <b>linking</b> such as disulfide bridges, ester groups, and amide bonds. Though the mechanism of cross-linking of Tyrosine is understood that occurs through radical initiation, the <b>cross</b> <b>linking</b> of resilin still remains a mystery. <b>Cross</b> <b>linking</b> of resilin occurs very quickly and this is possibly a result of temperature.

To further understand this process, a Strep-tag II variant of the large subunit of Escherichia coli hydrogenase 3, HycE, was constructed to enable isolation of protein complexes. A complex with SlyD, a chaperone protein implicated in hydrogenase production through association with the nickel-binding accessory protein HypB, was observed. A SlyD–HycE interaction preceding both iron and nickel insertion to the enzyme was detected, mediated by the chaperone domain of SlyD, and independent of HypB.

40|$|Cisplatin is an {{extremely}} effective chemotherapeutic agent used {{for the treatment of}} testicular and other solid tumours. It induces a variety of structural modifications in DNA, the most abundant being the GpG- and ApG- 1, 2 -intrastrand <b>cross</b> <b>links</b> formed between adjacent purine bases. These <b>cross</b> <b>links</b> account for approximately 90 % of cisplatin-induced DNA damage and are thought to be responsible for the cytotoxic activity of the drug. In human cells, the nucleotide excision repair (NER) process removes the intrastrand <b>cross</b> <b>links</b> from the genome, the efficiency of which is likely to be an important determinant of cisplatin cytotoxicity. We have investigated whether the p 53 tumour suppressor status affects global NER of cisplatin-induced intrastrand <b>cross</b> <b>links</b> in human cells. We have used a (32) P-postlabelling method to monitor the removal of GpG- and ApG-intrastrand <b>cross</b> <b>links</b> from two human cell models (the 041 TR system, in which p 53 is regulated by a tetracycline-inducible promoter, together with WI 38 fibroblasts and the SV 40 -transformed derivative VA 13) that each differ in p 53 status. We demonstrate that the absence of functional p 53 leads to persistence of both cisplatin-induced intrastrand <b>cross</b> <b>links</b> in the genome, suggesting that p 53 regulates NER of these DNA lesions.
