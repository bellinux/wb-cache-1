40|$|O presente trabalho retrata um estudo da adsorção de dióxido de carbono em zeólita {{comercial}} do tipo 13 X. As atividades desenvolvidas foram divididas em quatro etapas: estudo em batelada da capacidade de adsorção do adsorvente com o CO 2 sintético (4 %), avaliação dinâmica em leito fixo com a mistura sintética de gases (4 % CO 2, 1, 11 % CO, 1, 2 % H 2, 0, 233 % CH 4, 0, 1 % C 3, 0, 0233 % C 4 e argônio como inerte fechando o balanço), modelagem dinâmica em leito fixo e avaliação em leito fixo da curva de ruptura do CO 2 com o gás de pirólise do lodo de esgoto. O lodo e o adsorvente foram caraterizados por análises TG/DTA, MEV, FRX e BET. Os estudos de adsorção foram realizados nas seguintes condições operatórias: temperatura de 40 °C (para a pirólise do lodo T = 600 °C), pressão de 0, 55 5, 05 bar (processo batelada), vazão da mistura gasosa entre 50 72 mL/min e massa de adsorvente igual a 10, 15 e 20 g (processo em leito fixo). O tempo do processo de adsorção em batelada foi de 7 h e em leito fixo foi em torno de 180 min. Os resultados obtidos nesta etapa mostraram que no estudo batelada o processo de adsorção com a zeólita 13 X é eficiente e que a massa adsorvida do CO 2 aumenta com o crescimento da pressão, diminui com o aumento da temperatura e se eleva com a temperatura de ativação do adsorvente. No processo dinâmico foram avaliadas as curvas de rupturas, as quais foram comparadas às isotermas de adsorção representadas pelos modelos de Langmuir, Freündlich e Toth. Todos os modelos se ajustaram bem aos pontos experimentais, porém o modelo de Langmuir foi o escolhido tendo em vista sua utilização no modelo dinâmico de adsorção não apresentar implicações (indeterminação e maior número de parâmetros como ocorreu com os demais) na resolução da equação. No estudo dinâmico em leito fixo com a mistura de gases sintéticos e diferentes massas de adsorvente, a massa de 20 g apresentou maior percentual de adsorção 46, 7 % na temperatura de 40 oC e vazão da mistura gasosa de 50 mL/min. O modelo se ajustou satisfatoriamente para as três curvas de ruptura e os parâmetros avaliados foram: coeficiente de dispersão axial (0, 0165 dm 2 /min), difusividade efetiva no interior da partícula (0, 0884 dm 2 /min) e coeficiente externo de transferência de massa (0, 45 dm/min).

The activities were divided into four stages: study batch adsorption capacity of the adsorbent with synthetic CO 2 (4 %), fixed bed dynamic evaluation with the commercial mixture of gases (4 % CO 2, 1. 11 % CO, 1 2 % H 2, 0. 233 % CH 4, 0. 1 % C 3, 0. 0233 % C 4 argon as inert <b>closing</b> <b>balance),</b> fixed bed dynamic modeling and evaluation of the breakthrough curve of CO 2 originated from the pyrolysis of sewage sludge. The sewage sludge and the adsorbent were characterized by analysis TG / DTA, SEM, XRF and BET. Adsorption studies were carried out under the following operating conditions: temperature 40 °C (for the pyrolysis of the sludge T = 600 °C), pressures of 0. 55 to 5. 05 bar (batch process), flow rate of the gaseous mixture between 50 - 72 ml/min and the adsorbent masses of 10, 15 and 20 g (fixed bed process). The time for the adsorption batch was 7 h and on the fixed bed was around 180 min. The results of this study showed that in batch adsorption process step with zeolite 13 X is efficient and the mass of adsorbed CO 2 increases with the increases pressure, decreases with temperature increases and rises due the increase of activation temperature adsorbent. In the batch process were evaluated the breakthrough curves, which were compared with adsorption isotherms represented by the models of Langmuir, Freündlich and Toth. All models well adjusted to the experimental points, but the Langmuir model was chosen in view of its use in the dynamic model does not have implications for adsorption (indeterminacy and larger number of parameters such as occurred with others) in solving the equation. In the fixed bed dynamic study with the synthetic gas mixture, 20 g of mass adsorbent showed the maximum adsorption percentage 46. 7 % at 40 °C temperature and 50 mL/min of flow rate. The model was satisfactorily fitted to the three breakthrough curves and the parameters were: axial dispersion coefficient (0. 0165 dm 2 /min), effective diffusivity inside the particle (dm 2 /min 0. 0884) and external transfer coefficient mass (0. 45 dm/min). The breakthrough curve for CO 2 in the process of pyrolysis of the sludge showed a fast saturation with traces of aerosols presents in the gas phase into the fixed bed under the reaction proces...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (MBA (Business Management)) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2010. ENGLISH ABSTRACT: Market {{capitalisation}} is {{a measure}} of size and prestige for various JSE listed companies. Changes in the Companies Act in relation to the capital maintenance provided companies the opportunity to repurchase their own shares. South Africa’s legislation is different to those of its international peers which resulted in a different interpretation of how to deal with treasury shares and resultantly impacted on the valuation of market capitalisation. This study was undertaken with the aim of establishing if there are differences in the reporting of <b>closing</b> <b>balances</b> of the number of shares of the company and group as provided by the share analysis section of the annual financial reports which is required by the JSE Listing Requirements. Thirty-four companies were selected specifically, analysed and compared to information as per the University of Stellenbosch Business School share program to determine whether differences arise and to determine the impact that this has on the market capitalisation valuation and explanations for deviations. The results reflected that the non reconciliation of <b>closing</b> <b>balances</b> of the group was primarily due to the non consolidation of trusts, subsidiaries and treasury shares and companies not adhering to the listing requirements as per section 3. 3 of the shareholders’ spread to adequately disclose treasury related transactions. The study also found ambiguity in accounting standards IAS 1 in that they did not provide conclusive guidance in terms of the disclosure of share movements in rand value and units to reconcile between opening and <b>closing</b> <b>balances</b> of all treasury shares. Changes in the tax legislation will in future negate the reason for share repurchases through the subsidiaries or trusts which {{will have an impact on}} the reconciliation process going forward. Ultimately the accounting profession and JSE will have to implement standardised guidelines to ensure that the reporting of treasury shares is simplified to ensure that market users’ understanding of treasury activities and market capitalisation valuation can be improved...|$|R

There were varying findings with regards to the study as it was found that some companies had differences in group, company, trusts, subsidiaries, and treasuries. Most of the differences were due to company mistakes, non-consolidation of trusts, and use of different methods. It was found that certain companies tend to omit certain information in disclosing the shareholder spread and this has resulted in many companies with differences in their <b>closing</b> <b>balances</b> for the company, group, trusts, subsidiaries, and treasuries.
