5|$|Cobalt is {{essential}} to the metabolism of all animals. It is a key constituent of <b>cobalamin,</b> also known as vitamin B, the primary biological reservoir of cobalt as an ultratrace element. Bacteria in the guts of ruminant animals convert cobalt salts into vitamin B, a compound which can only be produced by bacteria or archaea. The minimum presence of cobalt in soils therefore markedly improves the health of grazing animals, and an uptake of 0.20mg/kg a day is recommended because they have no other source of vitamin B.|$|E
5|$|Proteins {{based on}} <b>cobalamin</b> use corrin {{to hold the}} cobalt. Coenzyme B12 {{features}} a reactive C-Co bond that participates in the reactions. In humans, B12 has two types of alkyl ligand: methyl and adenosyl. MeB12 promotes methyl (-CH3) group transfers. The adenosyl version of B12 catalyzes rearrangements in which a hydrogen atom is directly transferred between two adjacent atoms with concomitant exchange of the second substituent, X, which may be a carbon atom with substituents, an oxygen atom of an alcohol, or an amine. Methylmalonyl coenzyme A mutase (MUT) converts MMl-CoA to Su-CoA, {{an important step in}} the extraction of energy from proteins and fats.|$|E

40|$|This work is {{described}} in three major sections. (1) A Range of <b>cobalamins</b> and cobaloximes have been studied by electron-addition and photolysis methods with special reference to alkyl derivatives because of its role in several coenzymeB 12 -dependent enzyme reactions. Photolysis {{of a range of}} alkylcobalamins and alkylcobaloximes at 77 K resulted in the homolysis of Co-C bond to give Co(II) derivatives and the respective alkyl radicals. Methylcobalamin gave a radical-pair where the alkyl(solvent) radical was trapped at distance of 8. 3 A from Co(II), however radicals were not so precisely trapped in the case of methylcobaloxime. Electron-addition at 77 K gave different results for <b>cobalamins</b> and cobaloximes. All alkylcobaloximes gave Co(I) derivatives upon annealing above ca. 150 K while <b>cobalamins</b> gave Co (II) derivatives. Several derivatives of <b>cobalamins</b> and cobaloximes have been studied by electron addition and photolysis and the nature of intermediates and products have been identified by e. s. r. The relevence of our work with respect to the role of <b>cobalamins</b> in enzymatic reactions and cobalt chemistry is discussed. Some studies on cobalt complexes of porphyrins, peptides and phthalocyanins have been done to compare with <b>cobalamins</b> and cobaloximes. (2) Studies on electron-addition to a range of disulphide containing proteins at 77 K showed that electrons are efficiently trapped by disulphides to form RS-SR- type of radicals. (3) Radical-cations of some aromatic, heterocyclic, aliphatic and inorganic derivatives have been prepared using a recently developed technique of radiolysis of frozen freon solutions, and, they were studied by e. s. r spectroscopy. This method offers an interesting comparison to PES and theoretical results and thus it has helped to understand their electronic structure better...|$|R

The properties of the two <b>cobalamins,</b> the two important B 12 cofactors Ado- and MeCbl are described, with particular emphasis on how the Co-C bond cleavage is involved in the enzymatic mechanisms. The main structural features of <b>cobalamins</b> are described, with particular reference to the axial fragment. The structure/property relationships in <b>cobalamins</b> are summarized. The recent studies on base-off/base-on equilibrium are emphasized for their relevance to the mode of binding of the cofactor to the protein scaffold. The absorption, transport and cellular uptake of <b>cobalamins</b> and the structure of the B 12 transport proteins, IF and TC, in mammals are reviewed. The B 12 transport in bacteria and the structure of the so far determined proteins are briefly described. The currently accepted mechanisms for the catalytic cycles of the AdoCbl and MeCbl enzymes are reported. The structure and function of B 12 enzymes, particularly the important mammalian enzymes methyltransferase (MetH) and methyl-malonyl-coenzymeA mutase (MMCM), are described and briefly discussed. Since fast proliferating cells require higher amount of vitamin B 12 than that required by normal cells, the study of B 12 conjugates as targeting agents has recently gained importance. Bioconjugates have been studied as potential agents for delivering radioisotopes and NMR probes or as various cytotoxic agents towards cancer cells in humans and the most recent studies are described.

25|$|The cobalt-containing Vitamin B12 (also {{known as}} <b>cobalamin)</b> catalyzes the {{transfer}} of methyl (−CH3) groups between two molecules, which involves the breaking of C−C bonds, {{a process that is}} energetically expensive in organic reactions. The metal ion lowers the activation energy for the process by forming a transient Co−CH3 bond. The structure of the coenzyme was famously determined by Dorothy Hodgkin and co-workers, for which she received a Nobel Prize in Chemistry. It consists of a cobalt(II) ion coordinated to four nitrogen atoms of a corrin ring and a fifth nitrogen atom from an imidazole group. In the resting state there is a Co−C sigma bond with the 5′ carbon atom of adenosine. This is a naturally occurring organometallic compound, which explains its function in trans-methylation reactions, such as the reaction carried out by methionine synthase.|$|E
40|$|There is {{considerable}} evidence that vitamin B,, and related <b>cobalamins</b> are {{important factors in}} microbial ecology of the sea. Cowey (1956), Burkholder and Burkholder (1956, 1958), Starr (1956), and others have shown that not only eyanocobalamin, but other <b>cobalamins</b> as well, are present in sea water and marine sediments. The reviews by Provasoli (1958 a, b) list many marine protozoa and unicellular algae which require vitamin B, 2; in some cases, members of the pseudovitamin B, 2 group (i. e., analogues of eyanocobalamin containing purines {{in place of the}} dimethylbenzimidazole moiety) were utilized in place of the true vitamin. Droop et al. (1959) reported that about 70 per cent of marine proto-phytes grown in pure culture require an exog-enous supplv of vitamin B 12. Although "mam-malian " specificity was the most common type, nevertheless, {{a significant portion of the}} species had other specificity patterns, lending support to the conclusion that, for microorganisms, ana-logues of vitamin B 12 have an ecological impor-tance equal to the vitamin proper. Production of <b>cobalamins</b> by marine bacteria in pure culture, as well as in marine mud, has been shown by the Burkholders (1956, 1958, 1959) and Starr, Jones, and Martinez (1957).

The extraction procedure is fast and based on dilution/protein precipitation of a milk sample with 50 mM sodium acetate buffer (pH 4. 6), followed by solid phase extraction (SPE) of the filtered supernatant.

Single and tandem MS modes were compared. For all the compounds except hydroxocobalamin, {{the most intense}} ion formation was observed {{as a result of}} protonation of the original molecular cation leading to an analytically useful doubly charged ion. For hydroxocobalamin a similar process leads to the loss of the functional group leading to the [Cbl + H] 2 + ion, which is analytically useful only in the absence of other <b>cobalamins.</b> Hydroxocobalamin can be determined in the presenee of other compounds using the minor [OH-Cbl]+ ion. The calibration curves are linear in the range 0. 01 - 1 μg ml- 1, which can be extended up to 10 μg ml- 1 if alternative ions are chosen. Detection limits of 5 - 40 ng ml- 1 are obtained. Collision-induced dissociation leads first to the loss of the Co substituent (Me, CS, OH, adenosyl) and thus to a decrease in selectivity.
