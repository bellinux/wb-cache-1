40|$|Basic {{principles}} of fabricating tile glazes based on cordieritic glass-ceramics are explained. Glass compositions from the MgO-Al 2 O 3 SiO 2 three-component phase diagram have been melted {{with and without}} the nucleating agent TiO 2. Additionally, a sodium borosilicate glass that is commonly used in the the glaze industry has been wet milled, together with the previous compositions, to produce a <b>coating</b> <b>slip.</b> Studies {{are focused on the}} role of the nucleating agent and glassy formulation in the crystallization of the glass-ceramic system using differential thermal analysis, X-ray diffractometry, and scanning electron microscopy. When added to a borosilicate glass, only one composition is capable of crystallizing cordierite under a fast-firing cycle used for ''monoporosa'' production. The porosity of the glaze layer is sufficiently low and the crystal size is small to ensure good mechanical and chemical properties, The presence of cordierite crystals in the glaze should enhance abrasion and acid resistance, in comparison to a traditional matte glaze that contains mostly enstatite or diopside crystals...|$|E
40|$|Four {{different}} {{trials of}} stratified three-layered fine paper, of sulphate pulp, {{were performed to}} investigate if stratified fine fraction or fibres from birch can improve the properties of a paper compared to a reference sheet. All trials had five different scenarios and each scenario was calendered with different linear load. All sheets had a grammage of 80 g/m 2. In the first trial, the paper contained birch, pine and filler of calciumcarbonate (marble), and was manufactured with the pilot paper machine XPM and the stratified headbox Formator at RCF (Stora Enso Research Center in Falun). The furnish consisted of 75 % birch and 25 % pine. The second trial contained coated sheets with paper from trial one as the base paper. The <b>coating</b> <b>slip</b> contained calciumcarbonate and clay and the amount was approximately 10 - 12 g/m 2. The third trial, also with birch and pine but without filler, was performed at STFI (Skogsindustrins Tekniska Forskningsinstitut in Stockholm) with the laboratory scaled paper machine StratEx and the stratified headbox AQ-vanes. The furnish consisted of 75 % birch and 25 % pine, except for one scenario which contained of 75 % pine and 25 % birch. The last trial contained fractionated pulp of birch and pine and was performed at STFI. 50 % was fine fraction and 50 % was coarse fraction. This test does not show any clear benefits of making stratified sheets of birch and pine {{when it comes to}} properties such as bending stiffness, tensile index and surface smoothness. The retention can be improved with birch in the surface plies. It is possible that the formation can be improved with birch in the surface plies and pine in the middle ply. It is also possible that fine fraction in the surface plies and coarse fraction in the middle ply can improve both surface smoothness and bending stiffness. The results in this test are shown with confidence intervals which points out the difficulties of analysing sheets manufactured with a pilot paper machine or a laboratory scaled paper machine...|$|E

40|$|The {{attachment}} of Staphylococcus aureus (Cowan I) and two {{strains of}} group A and G streptococci on glass cover <b>slips</b> <b>coated</b> with fibronectin, fibronectin fragments, or fibrinogen was studied. The attachment was quantitated by counting the attached bacteria on glass surfaces {{coated with a}} similar molarity of the proteins. Fibronectin was a more effective attachment factor than fibrinogen for staphylococci, while group G streptococci attached better on fibrinogen- than on fibronectin-coated cover slips. In this system, group A streptococci bound almost exclusively to substrate-bound fibrinogen. Attachment experiments involving the use of staphylococci pretreated with soluble fibronectin or fibrinogen revealed that bacterium-bound fibronectin and fibrinogen were able to enhance the adherence on cover <b>slips</b> <b>coated</b> with fibronectin. The 30 -kilodalton NH 2 -terminal and the 120 - to 140 -kilodalton COOH-terminal fragments of fibronectin, both of which contain bacterial binding sites, mediated the staphylococcal attachment, suggesting that both parts of the molecule {{are involved in the}} attachment mediated by fibronectin...|$|R

Fortunately, she wasn’t too aghast to bring me along after I’d replied, “Sure, I’ll come with you, but what’s Spence?” I don’t remember precisely how she answered, but whatever she said persuaded me to get dressed in a hurry and follow her to Yale’s largest auditorium a full half hour before the first lecture of History of Modern China was scheduled to begin.

30|$|The {{surfaces}} used to {{seal the}} observation chamber and for the motility analysis were either acid washed glass (AWG) cover slips (Carl Roth GmbH) or cover <b>slips</b> <b>coated</b> with FOTS or polyethyleneglycoltriethoxysilane (PEG). FOTS silane was coated on glass cover slips through chemical vapor deposition (CVD) for 2  h at 80  °C [10]. Subsequently samples were rinsed with ethanol (p.A.) and dried with N 2 gas. Polyethylene glycol (PEG) triethoxysilane (PEG 2000 -urea) was synthesized according to previously published protocols [23]. Prior to <b>coating,</b> glass cover <b>slips</b> were activated by piranha solution (H 2 SO 4 /H 2 O 2  =  3 : 1). 0.25  mM PEG silane and 2.5  µM triethylamine were dissolved in dried toluene (p.A.). The activated glass cover slips were immersed in this solution and allowed to react for 48  h at 55  °C. Subsequently, the samples were rinsed with ethyl acetate (p.A.) and sonicated in ethyl acetate for 2  min and then rinsed again with ethyl acetate and methanol (p.A.). All surface coatings were characterized by ellipsometry, XPS, and contact angle goniometry. The AWG coverslips were prepared by immersion in 0.1  M HCl for 24  h, before washing extensively in deionised water and blowing dry in a stream of nitrogen. For the standard spore settlement assay, clean-room sealed Nexterion glass slides (Schott) were used as substrate. Slides were reacted with FOTS and PEG as supplied.|$|R

40|$|To further {{my study}} of venomous {{peptides}} from Conus tulipa and C. purpurascens, I {{have developed a}} novel preparation to observe the electrophysiology of isolated neurons in vitro. As a teleost fish, known prey for these two species of fish-hunting cone snails, zebrafish (Danio rerio) provide an ideal model system with its small size, short gestation period, and rapid development. With a highly simplified neuronal network at younger embryonic stages, these organisms only have primary neurons, secondary neurons, and interneurons, which can be identified based on the cell soma size and axonal morphology. This summer, I successfully isolated Danio rerio neurons from stages 18 to 80 hours post-fertilization on laminin <b>coated</b> cover <b>slips.</b> Axonal growth rates were calculated by monitoring the extension of processes over time, and were determined to resemble published rates of growth in vivo. Also, I maintained immortal rat cells in culture {{to determine the effects}} of the toxins on mammalian neurons in comparison to zebrafish.
