40|$|As one of {{the first}} US stages to open its doors to retail {{electric}} competition, California offers an important opportunity to assess the effectiveness of green power marketing as a mechanism for supporting renewable energy. This report is an interim assessment of key green power product, industry, and market trends in California. The report identifies and analyzes: the potential size of the green power market in California; the companies participating in the green power market; the green power products being offered and their prices; the impact of the green market on renewable generators and the environment; and the influence of several public policies and non-governmental programs on the market for green power. Data used in this paper have been collected, in large part, from surveys and interviews with green power marketers that took place between December 1997 and April 1998. There remain legitimate concerns over the viability of green power marketing to support significant quantities of renewable energy and provide large environmental gains, and it is far too early to assess the overall strength of customer demand for renewable energy. A <b>critical</b> <b>finding</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> report is that, because of the high cost of acquiring and servicing residential customers and the low utility default service price, green power marketing affords new energy service providers {{one of the}} only viable entrees to California`s residential marketplace...|$|E

Despite this, hybrid social enterprises face various challenges when it comes to branding. These challenges are not only practical in nature but also theoretical, since little {{can be found in the}} literature on how these organisations brand themselves. Furthermore, both the fields of branding and hybrid social entrepreneurship are newly emerged and evolving thus offering a lot of opportunity for research. The purpose of this research study is to provide theoretical contribution to the identified gap in theory by using existing theories in brand management and using a research methodology of mixed methods approach. The data was collected through a survey of fifty two hybrid social enterprises and semi structure interviews of five hybrid social organisations in Gothenburg. The findings indicate that hybrid social enterprises are more likely to use the relational approach as described in the theory by Heding et al. (2009). However, there was no indication of the unison application of this approach among all. Furthermore, hybrid social enterprises used a combination of various brand management methods. A <b>critical</b> <b>finding</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> study was also the discovery of the hybrid social enterprises attitude to ' branding as a no brand'. All these findings indicate the evidence of an eighth brand management approach. Finally the research also provides direction for future research with ranging themes for further research.

40|$|Abstract [...] The purpose <b>of</b> <b>this</b> {{preliminary}} {{study was to}} describe pedal effectiveness parameters and knee-joint reaction forces generated by subjects with chronic spinal cord injury (SCI) during functional electrical stimulation (FES) -induced bicycling. Three male subjects (age 33 [...] 36 years old), who were post-traumatic SCI (ASIA-modified level A, level T 4 -C 5) and enrolled in an FES rehabilitation program, signed informed consent forms and participated in this study. Kinematic data and pedal forces during bicycling were collected and effective force, knee-joint reaction forces, knee generalized muscle moments, and knee-joint power and work were calculated. There were three <b>critical</b> <b>findings</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> study: 1) pedaling effectiveness was severely compromised in this subject population as indicated {{by a lack of}} overall positive crank work; 2) knee-joint kinetics were similar in magnitude to data reported for unimpaired individuals pedaling at higher rates and workloads, suggesting excessive knee-joint loading for subjects with SCI; and 3) shear reaction forces and muscle moments were opposite in direction to data reported for unimpaired individuals, revealing an energetically unfavorable knee stabilizing mechanism. The <b>critical</b> <b>findings</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> study suggest that knee-joint kinetics may be large enough to produce a fracture in the compromised lower limbs of individuals with SCI...|$|R

40|$|Organic matter (OM) in the {{environment}} acts as a nutrient, but may also act as a transport vector for harmful chemical compounds and bacteria. Acetate is a labile form of OM produced during fermentation in anaerobic lagoons used to store animal fecal-waste from concentrated animal feeding operations (CAFOs). Dry and liquid fertilizers from CAFOs {{pose a threat to}} groundwater by introducing excessive amounts of nutrients (e. g. OM, nitrate and ammonia), metals, and antibiotic compounds. In the epikarst of Northern Arkansas in the Buffalo River watershed additional input of labile dissolved organic carbon (DOC) from liquid CAFO waste-fertilizers was hypothesized to increase microbial activity along groundwater flowpaths. In addition, high metal and antibiotic concentrations associated with increasing concentrations of DOC were hypothesized to be detrimental to microbial processes, with exception given to resistant bacteria species. Laboratory microcosm experiments were conducted to characterize microbial DIC production and denitrification. The microcosms were treated with acetate, nitrate, phosphate, and/or various metal species to characterize concentration effects on microbial activity. Field studies were used to calibrate laboratory conditions, and to compare biomass production and composition. Isotopes of dissolved inorganic carbon (δ 13 C-DIC), nitrate (δ 15 N-NO 3), and dissolved oxygen (DO) were used to assess microbial responses to increasing DOC concentrations. Fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) analysis was used to characterize biomass produced during the experiments. Conversion of DOC-DIC and decreasing NO 3 concentrations were observed in the microcosms. Microbial productivity was greatest when DOC concentrations were 10 times greater than NO 3 concentrations. When metals were added to the microcosms, microbial activity was inhibited with exception being microcosms containing metal concentrations below 10 µg/L. FAME biomarkers indicated gram-negative bacteria were present in biomass samples from the spring orifice and metal-treated microcosms, but microcosms amended with nutrients and DOC displayed indicators of predominantly gram-positive bacteria. <b>Critical</b> <b>findings</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> study were: bacteria species transported in spring discharge were resistant to antibiotics and metals, high concentrations of DOC and nitrate increase biological productivity in epikarst and metal exposure inhibits nitrate removal and causes ecological shifts in biofilms selecting for resistant bacteria strains...|$|R
40|$|Philosophiae Doctor - PhDSince {{the earlier}} 1970 s the {{government}} of Mozambique has been carrying out legal, political, economic and institutional reforms which are culminating {{in the establishment of}} the current fisheries governance systems. An important achievement of these reforms is the political recognition the government has given to the importance of subsistence fishing and its incorporation into policy instruments such as the Fisheries Master Plan II (2014 - 2019) and the Artisanal Fisheries Development Strategy (2009 - 2015). In these policy documents, fisheries authorities put subsistence fisheries on top of priorities. However, the practice in Mozambique’s fisheries is indicating that, despite this recognition, subsistence fishers remain amongst the most vulnerable groups, particularly at district and village levels. The objective {{of this study is to}} understand the patterns of inclusion and exclusion of subsistence fishers from the fisheries governance spaces in Mozambique with particular emphasis on Palma district (Cabo Delgado province). The study uses the concept of Action Spaces to situate the nature of opportunities that are being created under these reforms. A <b>critical</b> <b>finding</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> study is that, the institutions for fisheries governance being created by the government at district and community levels are not creating a functional mechanism for subsistence fishers to participate, access opportunities, and bring their voices into decision-making systems. As a result, subsistence fishers are creating their own spaces which are based on informal structures and relations to sustain their livelihoods. The study resorts to the institutional governance insights to understand the factors that may determine the interactions between the formal and informal action spaces while improving the contribution of subsistence fisheries to the livelihoods and food security of the vulnerable groups...|$|E
40|$|Over {{the past}} few decades, donor {{agencies}} have provided aid for education systems in developing countries by introducing innovations that seek to improve the provision of education. However, {{it has been observed}} with much concern that many innovations are discontinued after donor funding is withdrawn, with Zambia being no exception. Despite this observation, little is known about why some innovations end up being unsustainable in Zambia. Accordingly, this research was conducted to ascertain the factors that may influence the sustainability of donor-driven innovations by examining the case of a literacy programme in Zambia the Primary Reading Programme (PRP). Initially funded by the United Kingdom s Department for International Development (DFID) between 1999 and 2005, the PRP was designed to implement the new literacy policy, which used local languages to teach initial literacy from Grades 1 to 7. In 2005, DFID withdrew, leaving the government to sustain the programme in all government primary schools in Zambia. Drawing on data gathered through a qualitative-interpretivist-case approach that used semi-structured interviews, classroom observations and document analysis, the study found that the PRP was poorly sustained, as many aspects of the programme were drastically altered or discontinued after the termination of donor support. Key elements influencing sustainability included project-level factors associated with the design of the project, stakeholder ownership/motivation, the provision of financial, human and material resources for sustainability, and monitoring and evaluation. Contextual-level factors were related to attributes of the school (staff commitment/interest, leadership, staff retention, sustained professional development and availability of resources for continued implementation). At national level, Zambia s weak economic status and changes in policies affected the programme s sustainability. Project mentality or the negative attitude stakeholders hold towards donor-supported innovations also contributed to poor sustainability. A <b>critical</b> <b>finding</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> study is that the PRP appears to have been designed with inputs and activities that were beyond the socio-economic capacity of Zambia to manage and maintain without external support. Consequently, a major recommendation is that innovations should not be designed with excessive activities or tools or deliver benefits that are beyond the socio-economic capacity of the beneficiaries.

40|$|This thesis {{reports the}} {{findings}} of three studies designed to investigate the influences of backgrounds on learners and instructors in learning and teaching second language (L 2) writing in English. The participants, thus, were learners and instructors of L 2 writing in English. The studies {{took place in the}} ESL context of New Zealand and in the EFL context of Bangladesh. The first two studies focused on how learners from various linguistic, academic, and cultural backgrounds learned to write in English. The third study demonstrated how instructors’ academic training and the context of teaching influenced their modes of teaching L 2 writing in English in Bangladesh. In the first study, 30 participants were recruited from an English Language College in New Zealand. All participants were honing their English language skills in order to embark on undergraduate or graduate studies in New Zealand. Their proficiency in the English language was similar given the results of a placement test. The age of participants ranged from 16 - 40 years, and they came from such countries as China, Thailand, Indonesia, Japan, and Colombia. Participants were divided based on Chinese (N= 20) and non-Chinese (N= 10) backgrounds. All participants completed background questionnaires, grammaticality judgement tests, vocabulary tests, and writing tasks. A <b>critical</b> <b>finding</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> study was that for the non-Chinese participants both vocabulary and grammar tests’ scores correlated with the scores of the writing test; however, for the Chinese learners, scores in the vocabulary test did not correlate with those of the writing and grammar tests. This suggested that the L 2 writers across cultures and languages did not learn to write in English exactly alike, though participants of this study also demonstrated some similar areas of L 2 writing development. The study reinforced the caution about generalizing L 2 writers across languages, cultures, and academic backgrounds. The second study included 70 undergraduate students from a private university in the capital city of Bangladesh, Dhaka. The age of the participants ranged from 17 - 24 years, and their native language was Bangla. English language development was similar across participants given the results of an admission test and the mandatory pre-requisite English courses taken. Participants completed background questionnaires, vocabulary tests, grammaticality judgement tests, and writing tasks in English and Bangla. Participants also completed a questionnaire that gleaned information about their perceptions of writing in English and Bangla. One of the critical findings of the study was the cross-language correlations between essays, implying that a strong or a weak writer in a first language would show similar ability levels in an L 2. This study suggested that the teaching of L 2 writing in English should be based on an appreciation of how the development of writing in an L 1 can help or hinder the development of writing in an L 2. The third study focused on L 2 writing instructors at different public and private universities in Bangladesh. This study included 46 participants who completed background questionnaires, provided feedback on a piece of writing and completed questionnaires that gleaned information regarding their styles and strategies of providing feedback. The study revealed that the areas of specialization in English studies between the junior and senior instructors significantly varied [...] senior instructors specialized mostly in literature, whereas the junior instructors mostly specialized in language-related areas. Despite this, their practice and perceptions of teaching L 2 writing across the universities in Bangladesh did not vary significantly. This may change over time as instructors with language -area specializations become the majority in the future. The three studies of this thesis shifted the focus from learning to teaching L 2 writing across contexts and languages. The findings should inform explanation of why learners from different linguistic and cultural backgrounds, and with differing language abilities, learned or failed to learn to write in English. Furthermore, empirical data were presented to appreciate influences on instruction which in turn would influence the ways learners learn L 2 writing in English. Such findings should support the development of theories and practices in the teaching and learning of L 2 writing...|$|E

40|$|Numerous past articles, many {{of which}} consist of {{idealised}} prescriptions for success or the occasional case study or practitioner's contribution, have commented {{on the role of}} hospital clinician-managers. Prior work is circumscribed, however, in that it tends to be normative and a priori (how clinician-managers in principle should manage) rather than descriptive and a posteriori (how clinician-managers in situ do manage). In addition, it is apparent that an empirically-grounded, testable model is lacking for the way clinician-managers work. This paper sets out to balance past normative-prescriptive accounts with a descriptive-analytic one, and presents an empirically-based conceptual model of the behavioural routines of hospital clinician-managers. The model, based on multiple studies of clinician-managers' activities, conjectures five major modes of operating and four primary and five secondary pursuits. The paper advances accounts of how clinician-management work is conducted and the time frames for it, and hypothesises about clinician-managers' relationships, and how power and control is experienced and exercised. It also briefly discusses some of the implications of both the research program and the findings.

40|$|Despite {{recognition}} that reductions in fossil-fuel usage {{are necessary to}} reduce environmental harm, energy consumption continues to rise globally. There is a growing {{need to understand how}} to effectively influence individuals to reduce their energy consumption, particularly of fossil-fuels. Pro-environmental behaviour is the subset of consumer behaviour that is oriented towards reducing environmental impact compared to other options. It is widely agreed that due to a multiplicity of influencers, pro-environmental behaviour is best analysed using an integrated approach that allows the inclusion of different disciplinary perspectives, and seeks to identify the most important influences in the system under study. This dissertation sought to address the broader challenge of how to better design programs and policies that result in behaviour that is more sustainable. The objective of this dissertation was to assess the importance and effects of program structure and advice-giving on the pro-environmental behaviour of participating in a home energy evaluation program that encouraged homeowners to implement energy efficiency retrofits. Program structure was defined as the combination of the price of the evaluation, the financial reward structure, the level of government support, and the focus on influencing eight specific decisions within a specified timeframe. Advice-giving occurred during the initial evaluation with a home energy advisor and with the delivery of the report that contained a set of recommendations. A convergent mixed methods research design was employed to assess the relative importance of the two factors on participation and advice-following, where advice-following was considered as the matching of decisions to recommendations. The quantitative dataset was made up of files that detailed the 13, 429 initial and the 6, 123 follow-up evaluations conducted by advisors of the Residential Energy Efficiency Project (REEP) in the Region of Waterloo between 1999 and 2011. The qualitative data were gathered through 12 interviews with home energy advisors, eight of whom had worked for REEP and had conducted {{more than half of the}} home energy evaluations contained in the quantitative dataset. A natural quasi-experimental intervention that measured self-selection in response to varying program structure was employed to examine for variations in participation, material characteristics of houses, recommendations, and advice-following. To extend our understanding of the process of participation and decision making patterns, other analyses focused on relationships between the number of recommendations, the time between initial and follow-up evaluations, the number and types of decisions made, and the prioritization of decisions. The interviews assessed for differences in styles of advice-giving, and for their impact through comparison with the quantitative data that detailed the recommendations and decisions taken by the homeowners. The results of the effects of both factors were interpreted jointly and compared to previous studies about REEP or the EnerGuide for Houses and program as it was delivered nationally. This dissertation confirmed that an integrated approach to examining pro-environmental behaviour is supported as a useful framework for analysis. The findings support a process-based definition of pro-environmental behaviour as a useful model and form of integration. A convergent mixed methods research design is supported as a valuable and rigorous approach to examine the impact of various influences simultaneously. The delineation of multiple stages in the decision making process greatly enhanced the quality of analyses and findings. The two main factors of program structure and advice-giving affected advice-following. One factor influenced the other, as the program structure affected the receptiveness of homeowners as perceived by advisors, which affected advice-giving. The findings support the importance of both behaviourist and social learning approaches in influencing pro-environmental behaviour, and that their importance varies depending on the stage of the decision process. The findings show that behaviourist interventions, such as the program structure, were associated with variations in participation, and that different subsets of the population of houses from the Region of Waterloo were attracted to the different program structures. Indeed, in each program structure, the decision to return was influenced by different decisions. A <b>critical</b> <b>finding</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> study was that these programs were not sufficient to alter the path dependence of energy consumption or of energy systems as the program participants usually did not implement the most effective retrofits, and if they did, the retrofits did not achieve adequate depth of reductions to energy consumption in a timely manner. According to the home energy advisors, many homeowners had pre-conceived ideas upon entering the program of replacing their heating systems and windows. The interpretation of the qualitative and quantitative data showed that these intentions were often not altered, particularly in the case of windows, the decision that advisors believed to be the least effective of energy decisions...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} was {{the first}} study to estimate the direct and indirect effects of living-learning community (LLC) participation on a standardized measure of critical thinking using a multi-institution longitudinal research design. It is possible that despite being lauded nationally as an effective institutional intervention, LLCs may simply cluster students predisposed to be more engaged with their environment, more academically prepared, and more open to growth compared with traditional residence hall peers. Recent studies have demonstrated {{a positive relationship between}} LLC participation and self-reported growth in <b>critical</b> thinking. The <b>findings</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> study demonstrate markedly different conclusions from previous LLC studies exploring the outcome of critical thinking.

The investigations were undertaken with both normal and Chronic Airways Limitation (CAL) volunteers and with Intubated Intensive Care patients. The data presented in this research were collected from 144 patients in total. In experiment one there were 25 normal volunteers who underwent conventional ventilation imaging and 25 normal volunteers who underwent TEBA assisted ventilation imaging, while in experiment two, there were 25 volunteers with CAL for conventional ventilation and 25 for TEBA; in experiment three, 25 intubated Intensive Care Patients successfully completed ventilation scintigraphy using TEBA. For experiment four, 20 patients volunteered to complete a Technegas ventilation study prior to their bronchoscopy procedure. Experiments one and two demonstrated that TEBA was effective in distinguishing normal lung ventilation from ventilation defects found in Chronic Airways Limitation (CAL) and Pulmonary Embolism (PE). Experiment three showed TEBA ventilation imaging could be successfully undertaken by intubated and unconscious patients. This has significant implications for the diagnosis and treatment for patients in ICU who formerly could not undergo this procedure.

40|$|The aim <b>of</b> <b>this</b> {{article is}} {{to reflect on the}} notion of {{authenticity}} and the use of authentic materials in English for Specific Purposes (ESP). In the professional context, ESP requires the use of specialized and authentic documents.

The author also proposes the conception of a new paradigm model for authenticity {{in the shape of a}} diamond, which is based on the synthesis of existing qualitative research studies. In this paradigm, authenticity and the language teacher are at the core of language teaching which brings together the learners (and their needs), the professional tasks and the authentic documents. In order to better appreciate the usefulness of authentic documents – such as video, sound, texts and photos – in the ESP context, the pedagogical approaches and criteria which are involved in choosing appropriate authentic materials and tasks are also shared.

40|$|This {{research}} reports on two action research {{case studies of}} participatory materials development in two rural community contexts in Zambia, namely Chiawa and Nalusanga. It aims to explore and articulate the relationships between community-based environmental education and participatory materials development in the WWF Zambia Education Project context; clarify participatory materials development processes by identifying the roles of different ‘actors’ in these processes and identify and analyse the contextual and other factors that may influence {{development and use of}} environmental education materials in rural communities. These aims were explored by means of a number of action research cycles of inquiry in the two communities. The study also articulates the significance of considering ambivalent globalising influences such as international conferences, debates, overseas development aid, national policies and how these shape and influence materials development work in a local context. In order to gain more insight into the local contexts, I developed contextual profiles on the two communities. These capture the contextual factors that influenced the participatory materials development processes. They include issues such as language, ethnicity, literacy, power relations and the local social economy, amongst others. Although this study has been predominately guided by the socially critical orientation to research and education, I have drawn on aspects of other research orientations. I have also explored some of the emerging critiques of the socially <b>critical</b> orientation. The <b>findings</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> study reveal the different roles participants can play in participatory materials development; participatory materials development processes as a learning process; the dynamics of participation in an African context; the role of language and literacy in materials development; the need for open-ended process models of learning amongst adult learners and the importance of merging expert and local knowledge in participatory materials development.

40|$|Monitoring the {{integrity}} of civil engineering structures is an imperative aspect of public safety, since structural failures can pose serious threats to life and property. Periodic inspection performed throughout {{the life span of}} these structures is also vital for a nation?s economy. Substantial sums of money may be saved upon detecting structural deterioration in a timely manner. Nondestructive damage evaluation (NDE) offers effective and economically feasible solutions to perform such tasks. Better predictions can be made regarding the current state of structures, and structurally deficient regions that need immediate attention may successfully be narrowed down by utilizing NDE. For these reasons, a considerable amount of research has been conducted in the field of NDE over the past few decades. As a result, many different methodologies are now available, and many new ones continue to emerge as the need for better evaluation techniques prevails. Upon reviewing the NDE methodologies proposed to date, it may be concluded that theories based on the fundamental equations of mechanics and mathematics in conjunction with justifiable assumptions provided the best results compared to the algorithms developed pragmatically. The goal <b>of</b> <b>this</b> study is to provide NDE methodologies that simultaneously identify the location, the extent, and the severity of damage in general beams. By general beams, we mean beyond Euler-Bernoulli beams (i. e. slender beams) to deep beams and stubby beams whose response may be based on the Timoshenko beam theory, and the Theory of Elasticity. After presenting the governing equations of equilibrium and stress-displacement relations of the fundamental beam theories including the Euler-Bernoulli Beam theory, the Timoshenko beam theory, and the beam theory based on linear Elasticity Theory, mathematical expressions which relate physical properties (e. g. stiffness) of the undamaged and damaged structure to measurable response quantities (e. g. displacement, strains, etc.) are developed. We believe that these algorithms will lead to earlier and more accurate prediction of damage in <b>critical</b> structures. The <b>findings</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> work will also lead {{to a better understanding of}} the limitations of the currently proposed NDE techniques. In addition, it is anticipated that by incorporating the methodologies proposed in this study to the continuous health monitoring of structural systems could reduce the cost of maintenance and offer safer infrastructure networks...|$|R

A critical review of the latest literature was conducted to establish the general concepts and principles behind the CSH's method of assessment in comparison with CASBEE and LEED. Following this, differences, positive and negative aspects of the three assessment method were established through in-depth review of their official documents and by cross-referencing the different components, methodologies and assessment criteria <b>of</b> each. <b>This</b> led to a comparative analysis using a <b>critical</b> evaluation <b>of</b> <b>findings</b> <b>of</b> The Building Environmental Quality Evaluation for Sustainability through Time (BEQUEST), The European Sustainable Development Strategy (ESDS) and The Freiburg Charter (FC). Expert interviews were conducted to consolidate the <b>findings</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> study. This added technical in-depth expert opinions to the preliminary <b>findings</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> research and helped pave the way for providing practical suggestions for possible areas of improvement for the CSH...|$|R
40|$|Background: Community-based {{cardiovascular}} screening has {{the opportunity}} to detect critical car-diovascular disease and positively affect public health outcomes. Disease deemed to be critical or severe at detection requires appropriate medical follow-up. This article examined the self-reported outcomes of individuals who had undergone community-based cardiovascular screening and had <b>critical</b> <b>findings</b> for abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) or carotid artery stenosis (CAS). Methods: Over 390, 000 screening records for AAA and over 490, 000 screening records for CAS were re-viewed to identify individuals with <b>critical</b> screening <b>findings.</b> A <b>critical</b> AAA is defined as an aneu-rysm ≥ 5 cm and critical CAS is defined as a hemodynamically significant stenosis with recorded peak systolic velocities of ≥ 300 cm/s, in this population. Identified individuals were then con-tacted via phone and surveyed about the medical care they received after their screening. Results: Review of the screening records found a prevalence <b>of</b> <b>critical</b> AAA <b>findings</b> <b>of</b> 0. 037 % (146 par-ticipants) and <b>critical</b> CAS <b>findings</b> <b>of</b> 0. 12 % (579 participants). 61 % <b>of</b> participants with <b>critical</b> <b>findings</b> were reached for follow-up from both groups. Over 96 % of participants with critical AAA and over 92 % of participants with critical CAS had some forms of medical follow-up. Conclusions...|$|R
40|$|U. Goswami (1999, Journal of Experimental Child Psychology, 72, 210 - 219) {{argues that}} the <b>findings</b> <b>of</b> J. A. Bowey, L. Vaughan, and J. Hansen (1998, Journal of Experimental Child Psychology, 68, 108 - 133) are uninterpretable. This paper {{examines}} each of Goswami 2 ̆ 7 s criticisms of the methodology employed by Bowey et al. (1998). None can explain the differential analogy and phonological priming effects reported by Bowey et al. More fundamentally, none can explain the <b>critical</b> <b>finding</b> <b>of</b> Bowey et al. that, when phonological priming effects are controlled, {{the size of the}} end analogy effect is no greater than that of beginning and medial vowel analogy effects. Furthermore, some of Goswami 2 ̆ 7 s criticisms cast considerable doubt on the generalizability <b>of</b> <b>findings</b> from her version of the clue word task. (C) 1999 Academic Press...|$|R
