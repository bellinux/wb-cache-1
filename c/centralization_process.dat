40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} in unlimited. This thesis examines the ethnic Moro {{conflict in the}} southern Philippines. The argument herein is that {{the conflict between the}} Muslim Filipinos and the ruling governments, both colonial and independent, is not caused by religious or ethnic intolerance or difference. Rather, it is the result of an historical politicization of Moro identity that, when combined with the <b>centralization</b> <b>processes</b> of President Ferdinand Marcos, ignited a guerrilla war that prevented economic growth and social stability. The analysis suggests that the decentralization policies of the Ramos administration (1992 - 1998) and the compromise between his administration and the Moro National Liberation Front (the dominant Muslim faction) may have finally resolved the conflict. If lasting peace has in fact been achieved, the southern islands will provide key economic and political ingredients to allow the nation to enter the twenty first century as a newly industrialized nation[URL] Commander, United States Nav...|$|R

40|$|The author {{argues that}} in Poland the 1989 {{commitment}} to political and administrative decentralization has weakened {{over the last}} seven years and has resulted in (re) centralizing tendencies. It is argued that the center's interest in gaining short-term political successes rather than engaging in long-term reforms fostered the retention of past centralized practices and the emergence of new (re) centralizing tendencies. This has been accomplished by the central state through application of three sets of forces: (1) fiscal, (2) political, and (3) systemic (preservation of the past). The first part of the paper lays out a theoretical framework for analysis of pressures and barriers to decentralization and (re) centralization. The second is an examination of the process of implementation in Poland, of local government and public administration reform over the period 1989 - 96. The third is an examination of (re) <b>centralization</b> <b>processes</b> in the context of political and fiscal forces as well as the inability of the center to reform itself and terminate the legacy of the past system in its multidimensional form (legal, institutional, territorial). The author concludes by asserting that, although clear (re) centralizing tendencies can be identified, Polish (re) centralization is characterized by the duality of the struggle: to move forward with the reforms and to dismantle the remnants of the past centralized system. Therefore, although Polish (re) centralization may appear similar in form, it differs in terms of causes from countries that are not subject to political and economic restructuring. ...|$|R

Studying in detail parliamentary elections in Sicily for the period 1946 - 1992, we document the significant support given by the Sicilian Mafia to the Christian Democratic party, starting at least from the 1970 s.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the politics of}} post-Soviet Russia's internal borders. The central argument is that the dynamics of center-regional relations in Russia can best be understood by examing borders as social and political institutions. Borders configure interests, distribute resources, and regulate identity. While the institutional qualities of borders often lay hidden, they are laid bare by conflicts over their status and content. This thesis {{takes advantage of the}} <b>centralization</b> <b>processes</b> initiated by Russian President Vladimir Putin to examine the relationship of Russia's internal borders to the dynamics of federal reform, democratization, and state building. The bulk of the thesis compares four Russian regions - the Republic of Kareliia, the Republic of Buriatiia, Perm oblast', and Tiumen oblast' - in their responses to state centralization along several dimensions: the creation of the Federal Districts and Putin's reform of the institution of Presidential Representatives; the revision of regional charters and republican constitutions; the conduct of gubernatorial elections; and the push for regional enlargement. The analysis reveals that Putin's centralization found willing accomplices insofar as it opened up opportunities for regional elites to exploit the discourse and repertoires of centralization within their own regions. The politics of centralization demonstrate how the multiple linkages of internal borders to territory, regional identity, and federal status, established the parameters for political contestation on the regional level and regulated the directionality of center-regional relations. The thesis makes use of qualitative data gathered through extensive fieldwork in Russia, primarily consisting of interviews and regional press archives. It makes an original contribution to the general political science literature in developing and applying the theoretical notion of borders as social and political institutions. It further makes a substantive contribution in suggesting why Russia's governors willingly gave up the autonomy gained in the 1990 s when confronted with state centralization in Putin's first term. </p...|$|R

In fact, one such algorithm, Asynchronous Partial Overlay (APO), was recently shown to outperform the Asynchronous Weak Commitment (AWC) protocol {{which is one of the}} best known methods for solving DCSPs.

40|$|Dynamic, partial {{centralization}} {{has received}} {{a considerable amount of}} attention in the distributed problem solving community. As the name implies, this technique works by dynamically identifying por-tions of a shared problem to centralize in order to speed the problem solving process. Currently, a number of algorithms have been created which employ this simple, yet powerful technique to solve problems such as distributed constraint satisfaction (DCSP), distributed con-straint optimization (DCOP), and distributed resource allocation. In fact, one such algorithm, Asynchronous Partial Overlay (APO), 1 was shown to outperform the Asynchronous Weak Commitment (AWC) protocol, {{which is one of the}} best known methods for solving DCSPs. One of the key differences between these two algorithms is that APO, as part of the <b>centralization</b> <b>process,</b> uses explicit constraint passing. AWC, on the other hand, passed nogoods because it tries to provide security and privacy. Because of these differences in underlying as-sumptions, a number of researchers have criticized the comparison between these two protocols. This article attempts to resolve this disparity by introducing a new AWC/APO algorithm called Nogood-APO that like AWC uses no-good passing to provide privacy and like APO uses dynamic, partial centralization to speed the problem solving process. Like its parent algorithms, this new protocol is sound and complete and performs nearly as well as APO, while still outperforming AWC, on distributed 3 -coloring problems. In addition, this paper shows that Nogood-APO provides more privacy to the agents than both APO and AWC on all but the sparsest problems. These findings demonstrate that a dy-namic, partial centralization-based protocol can provide privacy and that even when operating with the same assumptions as AWC still solves problems in fewer cycles using less computation and communi-cation...|$|E
40|$|Purpose – In {{a time of}} {{economic}} downfall {{a lot of companies}} choose to reduce corporate real estate (CRE) costs instead of aiming at more user-oriented CRE strategies. This also affects the budgets that are available for CRE. Therefore {{it is important that the}} organization of the CRE management (CREM) -department is optimally aligned with the CRE-strategy. This study provides CRE-managers with a tool for evaluating the organization of the CREM-department when applying the CRE-strategy of cost reduction. Design/methodology/approach – The formulated evaluation tool for the alignment of the organization of the CREM-department is a result of an explorative study. First a literature study was conducted which led to a theoretical model of factors that influence the organization of the CREM-department, with regard to five components: Organizational structure, Sourcing, <b>Centralization,</b> <b>Process</b> management and Company culture. Then empirical data was collected through interviews with two groups of respondents, namely CREM-departments who served as cases and CRE-consultants to hear their expert opinions. Cross-case analysis of the eight CREM-departments and a comparison of these results with the expert opinion of the consultants were used to look for links between the CREM department components and each CRE strategy. Findings – It was not possible to formulate links between every possible CRE strategy and the CREM-organization as most of the cases had implemented the same strategy, namely cost reduction. This did provide the opportunity to construct a clear evaluation model for this particular strategy. Not all the themes were aligned with the chosen CRE-strategy identically by all the CREM-departments with a cost reduction strategy, but many similarities came forward and were backed by the CREM experts. This was worked into an evaluation model on the alignment of the organization of the CREM-department with a cost reduction strategy. Research limitations/implications – The model developed is especially relevant for CREM-departments who have similar characteristics as the CREM-departments who served as cases: large companies with a division macro-organizational structure that apply the CRE-strategy of cost reduction. The evaluation model does not spell out exactly how the CREM organization should be managed and formed, but does provide insight in a number of main choices that can influence the organization of CREM. The purpose of the evaluation model is that the CREM department becomes aware of the consequences for the organization of CREM when implementing a cost reduction aimed CRE-strategy...|$|E
40|$|No {{provision}} in the U. S. Constitution unequivocally authorizes {{the federal government to}} regulate immigration and control immigrants and a fundamental principle of the U. S. federal systemis {{that the federal government is}} one of “enumerated powers. ” As a result, the federal government generally cannot exercise powers not expressly authorized by the U. S. Constitution. However, the federal government has actively regulated immigration for more than a century, with state and local governments having limited authority in the field. Even more, in Henderson, Chy Lung and other early cases from the late 19 th century, state action in the field of immigration was held unconstitutional even though Congress had not acted. Soon after, giving an imprimatur to a plenary and exclusive federal regulatory power in the field, the Supreme Court reconstructed the federal immigration power from a form of commercial regulation rooted in Congress's commerce power, to an extra-constitutional regulatory authority that is inherent in national sovereignty. In 1891, the <b>centralization</b> <b>process</b> came full circle when Congress put in place a bureaucratic structure who assume sole control over the enforcement of immigration laws. Federal exclusivity over immigration was not remarkable in terms of constitutional doctrine when dual federalism was in place. For a century and a half between the Founding and the New Deal, the Constitution was understood to mandate “two mutually exclusive, reciprocally limiting fields of power—that of the national government and of the States,” and challenges to state or federal measures required judges to determine whether the right government was acting within the right sphere. After the New Deal constitutional revolution, the Court’s federalism doctrine generally abandoned dual federalism’s notion of separate spheres in favor of a regime of concurrent jurisdiction. This meant that both state and national authorities have power to address most subjects of regulatory concern. Although cooperative-multilevel regulation and enforcement is, since then, not only constitutionally possible but a pervasive feature of the U. S. federal system, some have argued that immigration is exceptional in that it retains traces from the old days of dual federalism. According to this school of thought, immigration is still an exclusive enclave of federal power in which states and localities are powerless to regulate. Any entry into this realm necessarily invades federal power, whether affirmatively exercised or not. In addition, inextricably linked to the proposition that the immigration power is exclusively federal is a non-devolvability principle some scholars have found enshrined in a constitutional requirement of national uniformity. The nature of the immigration plenary power is such that the federal government may be constitutionally prohibited from delegating its authority to the states, because invitation for local enforcement will result in a violation of the constitutional mandate for uniform immigration laws as local authorities will enforce federal immigration laws differently, creating, in effect, different immigration laws [...] ...|$|E
