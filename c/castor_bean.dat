5|$|Since {{urbanization}} {{began in}} the 1960s, sudden high and sediment-lacking flows of polluted water began to destroy the native riparian vegetation once found along much of the creek. Exotic plants, including tobacco tree, <b>castor</b> <b>bean,</b> pampas grass, periwinkle, and Artichoke thistle, but most notably the giant reed, then replaced the historic live oaks, sycamores and alders as riparian vegetation. These plants have crowded out native vegetation, {{and in the case}} of giant reed, crowded out native animals—giant reed does not provide habitat for any native Southern California animals. These invasive species are most prevalent along upper Sulphur Creek (Sulphur Creek Reservoir prevents these plants from spreading downstream), much of the Aliso Creek mainstem, and some parts of Wood Canyon Creek.|$|E
5|$|With the {{introduction}} of non-native species, predominantly giant reed, <b>castor</b> <b>bean</b> and tobacco tree, native plant species in the watershed began to die out. As giant reed is not suitable habitat for many species, areas infested by giant reed are biologically dead in comparison with unaffected areas. It can grow extremely fast, removing too much water from the creek, and during flood events, {{many parts of the}} giant reed can wash downstream and re-establish themselves as a new colony, increasing the problem. Along with increasing concentrations of nutrients from fertilizer and other substances contained in runoff, algal blooms began to hurt the water quality of the creek, especially above Sulphur Creek Reservoir. The historically seasonal creek was replaced with a constant flow of polluted water from several large storm drains and many smaller ones.|$|E
40|$|High yields in intercropped only be {{attained}} with the adequate selection of an adequate plants arrangement system; therefore {{the aim of}} this project was to investigate which plat arrangement would better perform in a common beans/castor bean intercropping system. The experimental design was a completely randomized bloc with five replicates and four simultaneous sowings: beans sown on the <b>castor</b> <b>beans</b> row; <b>beans</b> sown between <b>castor</b> <b>beans</b> rows; beans sown on the row and between <b>castor</b> <b>beans</b> rows, and common <b>beans</b> and <b>castor</b> <b>beans</b> in monocrop. Results obtained from <b>castor</b> <b>beans</b> crop yields were not affected when intercropped with common beans. This intercropping system with castor showed that common beans cv. Pérola on the row and between rows provided higher yield of the legume. In general, the intercropping of common beans+castor beans is more efficient than the single crop system...|$|R

5|$|Witnesses {{called by}} the State {{supported}} Farrar's and the prosecutors' earlier claims that police had been called to the home {{a month before the}} fire, that Green's behavior had been cause for concern at the time, and that Farrar had turned in to police at that time seed packets containing castor beans. The Earl May store clerk who had identified Green as the purchaser of multiple packets of <b>castor</b> <b>bean</b> seeds testified to that effect. Medical evidence was presented that Farrar's illness had not fit neatly within the parameters of any known disease, but that its presentation matched the symptoms of ricin poisoning. An FBI criminologist provided testimony that he had tested for ricin antibodies in Farrar's blood approximately two months after Farrar's last acute symptoms, and found antibodies there in such large amounts that he could confidently state that Farrar had been subjected to repeated exposures to ricin.|$|E
5|$|There are sixteen {{prominent}} vegetation {{zones in}} the San Juan watershed, which include riparian vegetation, montane woodlands, coastal sage scrub and chaparral. Riparian vegetation is found {{along the banks}} of free-flowing streams with a measurable flow for at least several months out of the year. These include most of San Juan Creek, upper Trabuco Creek, Cañada Gobernadora, Bell Canyon, and other headwater streams, as well as scattered patches along Oso and El Horno creeks. Forests are present at high elevations, and also occur in close proximity to waterways. Coastal sage scrub is found on south-facing hillsides, while chaparral is found on higher-elevation hillsides and mesas. There are also a number of rare plant communities along rock outcroppings and vernal pools. However, introduced plant species, such as giant reed, <b>castor</b> <b>bean,</b> and tobacco tree, are rapidly spreading along streams. Giant reed has taken over huge areas of wetlands, swamps and riparian zones along the creek and its tributaries, although in recent years the county has taken steps toward eradicating it from San Juan Creek and other nearby streams.|$|E

25|$|The {{scientific}} {{name of the}} <b>castor</b> <b>bean</b> tick {{dates back to the}} starting point of zoological nomenclature, the 1758 tenth edition of Carl Linnaeus' Systema Naturae, where it appeared as Acarus ricinus. Pierre André Latreille split the new genus Ixodes from Linnaeus' Acarus (which at that time contained all known ticks and mites), and I.ricinus was chosen as the type species. It has subsequently been redescribed under a number of junior synonyms and subsequent combinations into different genera; these synonyms include Acarus ricinoides, Cynorhaestes reduvius, Cynorhaestes ricinus, Ixodes megathyreus, Ixodes bipunctatus, Cynorhaestes hermanni, Crotonus ricinus, Ixodes trabeatus, Ixodes plumbeus, Ixodes reduvius, Ixodes pustularum, Ixodes fodiens, Ixodes rufus, Ixodes sulcatus and Ixodes sciuri.|$|E

She also admitted conducting research into cholera, salmonella, foot and mouth disease, and camel pox, a disease that uses the same growth techniques as smallpox, but which is safer for researchers to work with. It {{was because of the}} discovery of Taha's work with camel pox that the US and British intelligence services feared Saddam Hussein may have been planning to weaponize the smallpox virus. Iraq had a smallpox outbreak in the 1970s and UNSCOM scientists believe the government would have retained contaminated material.|$|E

50|$|The {{castor seed}} {{contains}} ricin, a toxic protein. Heating during the oil extraction process denatures and deactivates the protein. However, harvesting <b>castor</b> <b>beans</b> {{may not be}} without risk. Allergenic compounds found on the plant surface can cause permanent nerve damage, making the harvest of <b>castor</b> <b>beans</b> a human health risk. India, Brazil, and China are the major crop producers, and the workers suffer harmful side effects from working with these plants. These health issues, in addition to concerns about the toxic byproduct (ricin) from castor oil production, have encouraged the quest for alternative sources for hydroxy fatty acids. Alternatively, some researchers are trying to genetically modify the castor plant to prevent the synthesis of ricin.|$|R
