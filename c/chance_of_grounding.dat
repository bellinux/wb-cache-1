50|$|Highly {{desirable}} to the fielding team and highly un{{desirable to}} the batting team, {{a double play}} can prove critical to {{the outcome of a}} specific game. The fielding team is likely to change pitch selection and defensive alignment to try and get a batter to ground into a force double play. Pitchers may throw pitches more likely to be hit as a ground ball - such as a sinker - while fielders can be positioned to make a ground ball more likely to be turned into a double play. Likewise, the batting team may take action - such as a hit and run play - to reduce the <b>chance</b> <b>of</b> <b>grounding</b> into a force double play.|$|E
40|$|This essay {{critically}} engages proposals by Thomas Pogge and Leif Wenar {{meant to}} combat &#x 2018;the resource curse. &#x 2019; Pogge and Wenar call for boycotts against stealing oppressors, sharing {{the expectation that}} the boycotts will significantly contribute to economic and political reform in the target countries. In contrast, I argue that liberal democracies should indeed stop trading with dictators and civil warriors, but for inward rather than outward looking reasons. We, the citizens of liberal democracies through our elected governments, ought to boycott severely oppressive regimes {{for the sake of}} our own moral integrity&#x 2014;simply in order to stop being complicit in what is effectively massive scale armed robbery. This inward looking thesis is distinctive in three ways. First, it contrasts with the dominant assumption that global reform must be grounded in the achievement of better political and economic outcomes for others. Second, the inward look manages to avoid the profound empirical uncertainty associated with any attempt to predict the direct effects of global rule changes on domestic institutions. Third, by isolating each democracy&#x 0027;s responsibility for each case of illicit trade, the inward looking strategy deals more adequately than the outward view with collective action problems, and therefore has a greater <b>chance</b> <b>of</b> <b>grounding</b> actual reforms, with whatever prospects for better outcomes they may entail...|$|E

40|$|Hemispheric image {{processing}} {{with the goal}} of solar radiation determination from ground-based fisheye images is a valuable tool for silvicultural analysis in forest ecosystems. The basic idea of the technique is taking a hemispheric crown image with a camera equipped with a 180 ° fisheye lens, segmenting the image in order to identify solar radiation relevant open sky areas, and then merging the open sky area with a radia-tion and sun-path model in order to compute the total annual or seasonal solar radiation for a plant. The results of hemi-spheric {{image processing}} can be used to quantitatively evaluate the growth <b>chances</b> <b>of</b> <b>ground</b> vegetation (e. g., tree regeneration) in forest ecosystems. This paper shows steps towards the operationalization and optimization of the method. As a prerequisite to support geometric handling and georeferencing of hemispheric images, an equi-angular camera model is shown to describe the imaging geometry of fisheye lenses. The model is extended by a set of additional parameters to handle deviations from the ideal model. In practical tests, a precision potential of 0. 1 pixels could be obtained with off-the-shelf fisheye lenses. In addition, a method for handling the effects of chromatic aberration, which may amount to several pixels in fisheye lens systems, is discussed. The central topic of the paper is the development of a versatile method for segmenting hemispheric forest crown images. The method is based on linear segment-oriented classification on radial profiles. It combines global thresholding techniques with local image analysis to ensure a reliable segmentation in different types of forest under various cloud conditions. Sub-pixel classification is incorporated to optimize the accuracy of the method. The performance of the developed method is validated in a number of practical tests...|$|R

In the following months, Borah was a leader of the Irreconcilables. [...] An especial target was Article X of the charter, obligating all members to defend each other's independence. The Irreconcilables argued that this would commit the U.S. to war without its consent; Borah stated that the U.S. might be forced to send thousands of men if there was conflict in Armenia. Other provisions were examined; Borah proposed that the U.S. representatives in Paris be asked to press the issue of Irish independence, but the Senate took no action. Borah found the provisions of the treaty regarding Germany to be shocking in their vindictiveness, and feared they might snuff out the new Weimar Republic at birth.|$|R

The marble stone was called 'Llechllafar' (the talking stone) because it once spoke when a corpse was carried over it to the cemetery for interment. The effort of speech had caused it to break, despite its size of ten feet in length, six in breadth and one in thickness. This bridge was worn smooth due to its age and the thousands of people who had walked over it, however the superstition was so widely held that corpses were no longer carried over it. This ancient bridge was replaced in the 16th century and its present location is not known.|$|R

It is argued that the integrated approach, by combining the RUP formalisation, modeling tools and coverage of the entire development process, together with the parallel development of methodology, organisation, and personnel, will greatly enhance the <b>chance</b> <b>of</b> solid systems, <b>grounded</b> in the organisation and appreciated by its users.
