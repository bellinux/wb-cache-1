40|$|In this paper, a {{proof-of-concept}} image-based {{technique is}} proposed for measuring small cable vibration. The technique analyzes an image sequence of a vibrating <b>cable</b> <b>segment</b> captured by a camera. An optical flow method {{is used to}} calculate variation of optical intensity of an arbitrary selected region of interest (ROI) on the cable image sequence. The obtained optical flow vector provides the direction of vibration for the ROI on the <b>cable</b> <b>segment,</b> which then can be used to estimate displacement of the ROI on the image plane. Furthermore, actual displacement of the ROI can be extracted when some conditions are met. The proposed technique is validated both in the laboratory using a rigid pipe and in the field on a small pedestrian bridge cable. Results show that the technique is able to measure the pipe motion and the cable vibration accurately. The proposed technique requires only one commercial camera, and no prior camera calibration is needed. In addition, the use of an optical flow method eliminates the need to attach any target to the cable and makes the technique very easy to implement. Despite these advantages, the technique still needs further development before it can be applied to long-span bridge cables...|$|E

50|$|The {{requirement}} of connecting the transmitter of {{one side to}} the receiver {{on the other side and}} vice versa makes it necessary to always have an odd number of crossovers between two devices, with an MDI-X port containing an internal crossover. Thus, connecting MDI to MDI-X requires a straight-through cable (one crossover in total). Connecting MDI to MDI (no crossover) or MDI-X to MDI-X (two crossovers) requires a(nother) crossover in the cable to get an odd number. When using more complicated setups through multiple patch panels in structured cabling, the connection can use multiple patch and building <b>cable</b> <b>segments.</b> It is a good idea to have all necessary crossovers on one side, i.e. either on the central hub/switch or on each secondary hub/switch.|$|R
