50|$|The {{drainage}} basin of the Merced River {{is located in}} the central Sierra Nevada, spreading across 1726 sq mi. It can be characterized as the slightly smaller southern companion of the Tuolumne River, the major Sierran river just north of the Merced. On the south, the basin borders on the headwaters of the San Joaquin River itself. The Merced River watershed includes the subwatersheds of Illilouette, Echo, Tenaya, Yosemite, Bridalveil, <b>Cascade,</b> and <b>Dry</b> Creeks, as well as the South and North forks of the river, of which the South Fork, at 43 mi long, is the largest. Tributaries to the South Fork include Bishop, Rail, Alder and Chilnualna Creeks. There are also many lakes in the watershed of the Merced River, including Merced Lake, Tenaya Lake, the Chain Lakes, May Lake, Lake McClure, and Lake McSwain.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The shape {{effects of}} dry {{particles}} on flowability, aerosolization, and deposition properties in inhalation drug delivery are studied. The properties are compared with similar size range particles of different shapes such as sphere, needle, cube, plate, and pollen. Flowability of the particles {{is characterized by}} Carr’s compressibility index and angle of slide (θ) method. The aerosolization and deposition properties of the particles are studied in vitro using an eight-stage Anderson cascade impactor with a Rotahaler®. Pollen-shaped particles are found to exhibit better flowability, higher emitted dose, and higher fine particle fraction than particles of other shapes in similar size range. They showed minimum θ of 35 ° and maximum emitted dose of 87 % and fine particle fraction of 16 %. The use of pollen-shaped particles can be a potential improvement in dry particle inhalation.

50|$|Ribbon Cascade {{is located}} in Hanging Canyon, Grand Teton National Park in the U.S. state of Wyoming. The cascade drops {{approximately}} 600 ft near {{the eastern end of}} Hanging Canyon, and west of Jenny Lake. Fed by an unnamed intermittent stream, the peak time for waterflow through the cascade is during spring snowmelt. However, the Ribbon <b>Cascade</b> is rarely <b>dry</b> as it is the only discharge for the Lake of the Crags, Ramshead Lake and Arrowhead Pool. There are no maintained trails to the cascade, though it can be seen during peak waterflow from the east shore of Jenny Lake, just to the north of Cascade Canyon.|$|R
50|$|Parc Georges-Brassens (15th arrondissement), occupying 7.4 hectares, {{is located}} {{on the site of the}} former Vaugirard {{slaughterhouse}} and horse market from 1894-1897, which were demolished between 1969 and 1979. The design, by architects Ghiulamila and Milliex and landscape architect Daniel Collin, preserved picturesque elements of the original market, including the belfry of the old auction market of the abattoirs of Vaugirard, and the covered horse market, which now serves on weekends as the site of an antiquarian book market. Modern sculptures of horses stand at the entrance to the garden. Corners of the park are occupied by a pre-school and day care center, and a theater. The landscape garden in the center of the park, in the picturesque tradition of Alphand and the Second Empire, has a lake, winding paths, flowerbeds, a rose garden and a garden of aromatic plants. The slope of the park also has a <b>dry</b> <b>cascade</b> of artificial stones, for children to climb.|$|R
40|$|Waste heat {{to power}} {{conversion}} using Organic Rankine Cycles (ORC) {{is expected to}} play an important role in CO 2 reductions from diesel engines. Firstly, a review of automotive ORCs is presented focusing on the pure working fluids, thermal architectures and expanders. The discussion includes, but is not limited to: R 245 fa, ethanol and water as fluids; series, parallel and <b>cascade</b> as architectures; <b>dry</b> saturated, superheated and supercritical as expansion conditions; and scroll, radial turbine and piston as expansion machines. Secondly, research direction in versatile expander and holistic architecture (NOx + CO 2) are proposed. Benefits of using the proposed unconventional approaches are quantified using Ricardo Wave and Aspen HYSYS for diesel engine and ORC modelling. Results indicate that, the implementation of versatile piston expander tolerant to two-phase and using cyclopentane can potentially increase the highway drive cycle power by 8 %. Furthermore, holistic architecture offering complete utilisation of charge air and exhaust recirculation heat increased the performance noticeably to 5 % of engine power at the design point condition...|$|R
50|$|The Ōsawa Pond {{is older}} than the temple itself. It is an {{artificial}} lake of 2.4 hectares that was created by Emperor Saga, either during his reign (809-823) or between his retirement from power and his death in 842. The pond is supposed to reflect the outlines of Dongting Lake in China, which has a special significance in Chinese culture. It was an imperial garden of the style known as chisen-shuyu: a garden meant to be seen from a boat, similar to the Imperial Chinese garden of the period. The lake was created by damming a stream which came from the Nakoso waterfall. At {{the north end of}} the pond are two islands, one large and one small - the small island being known as Chrysanthmum Island. Between the two islands are several small rocky islets, meant to resemble Chinese junks at anchor. On a hillside north of the lake is what appears to be a <b>dry</b> <b>cascade</b> (karedaki), a kind of Japanese rock garden or zen garden, where a real waterfall is suggested by a composition of stones.|$|R
40|$|We report {{oxygen and}} carbon stable isotope {{analyses}} of foraminifers, primarily planktonic, sampled at low {{resolution in the}} Cretaceous and Paleogene sections from Sites 1257, 1258, and 1260. Data from two samples from Site 1259 are also reported. The very low resolution of the data only allows us to detect climate-driven isotopic events on the timescale of more than 500 k. y. A several million-year-long interval of overall increase in planktonic 18 O {{is seen in the}} Cenomanian at Site 1260. Before and after this interval, foraminifers from Cenomanian and Turonian black shales have d 18 O values in the range - 4. 2 per mil to - 5. 0 per mil, suggestive of upper ocean temperatures higher than modern tropical values. The d 18 O values of upper ocean dwelling Paleogene planktonics exhibit a long-term increase from the early Eocene to the middle Eocene. During shipboard and postcruise processing, it proved difficult to extract well-preserved foraminifer tests from black shales by conventional techniques. Here, we report results of a test of procedures for cleaning foraminifers in Cretaceous organic-rich mudstone sediments using various combinations of soaking in bleach, Calgon/hydrogen peroxide, or <b>Cascade,</b> accompanied by <b>drying,</b> repeat soaking, or sonication. A procedure that used 100 % bleach, no detergent, and no sonication yielded the largest number of clean, whole individual foraminifers with the shortest preparation time. We found no significant difference in d 18 O or d 13 C values among sets of multiple samples of the planktonic foraminifer Whiteinella baltica extracted following each cleaning procedure...|$|R
40|$|Recently {{there has}} been focus on {{determining}} the drying behaviour of particulate material at low moisture contents (< 1 %), {{as a result of}} increased energy costs and purity requirements for dried products. As little is known about. the drying behaviour of particulate material at these low moisture levels, driers have been oversized by including large safety factors in the sizing calculations, thus incurring unnecessary capital expenditure. A research programme was formulated in an attempt to provide a greater understanding of the moisture movement processes occurring at these low moisture levels. The results of this work indicate the significant effects that influence the drying behaviour of particulate material, which may be implemented into drier sizing calculations. Most particulate materials require a significant amount of energy to remove residual amounts of moisture, particularly from microporous media or from strongly hydrophilic surfaces. Quantifying the energy required to remove this bound moisture is possible from a knowledge of heats of wetting as a function of moisture content. These can be calculated from isotherms under controlled conditions using the Clausius-Claperyon equation. As part of a research programme to look at this type of drying behaviour, a novel apparatus was designed and constructed. The function of this apparatus was to record drying profiles of particulate material under various drying conditions and sample sizes. The sensitivity and reproducibility of the drying profiles were the overiding parameters in the design of such an apparatus. Moisture movement at low moisture levels in thin layers and single particulate arrangements can be described by two mechanisms. Solute bound to hydrophilic and/or active pore surfaces requires a normally distributed activation energy to be overcome, for surface diffusion to occur. Solute held in "water clusters" by hydrophobic media, such as polymeric, some plastic and generally swelling solids, can be described by Fickian movement similar to the familiar transport processes known to occur at higher moisture contents. Thus, it is possible to extrapolate the drying kinetics at higher moisture contents to lower-moisture contents in this instance, but not for the surface diffusion process which takes place only at lower moisture levels. For the drying of thicker layers and beds of particles, accurate overall diffusion coefficients need to include a gas phase diffusion term for gaseous movement through the particulate bed. The studies here have extended the understanding of the drying kinetics dissimilarities between drying single isolated particles, single particle agglomerates, thin layers and beds of particulate material. In sizing calculations of drying units, preliminary kinetics tests on the material to be dried need to be performed under similar bed geometries to that in the full-scale drying unit. For example, thin-layer experiments appear to provide accurate drying kinetic data for the design of cascade rotary driers. The thickness of the thin layer in the drying kinetic tests is determined by the observed thickness of the falling film of material during operation of the <b>cascade</b> rotary <b>drier.</b> Higher gas velocities in a fluidised bed, or flash driers, may be best modelled by drying kinetics studies on single particles or single particle agglomerates. However, at lower gas velocities, thin-layer tests may be more suitable because the drying material in the fluidised bed may dry in a bubbling motion. The final section of this work looked at selective drying of various isopropyl alcohol/water mixtures at low moisture levels. Selective drying at higher moisture contents is generally well understood, by applying azeotropic principles to describe liquid-phase moisture removal from porous matrices. Two-component bound moisture in a porous particulate resides in a solid phase. It is not possible for a binary mixture bound directly to the solid to form an azeotropic mixture. Modelling the removal of this binary bound moisture was shown to fit a surface diffusion model, in which each of the two solvents was treated as a separate entity. In short, selective drying is prevalent at low moisture contents but can be described by two distinct surface diffusion models working independently on each binary species...|$|R
