25|$|There {{are several}} reasons for this, {{one of which is}} the lax {{attitude}} some banks have adopted because of the years of “good times.” The potential for this is exacerbated by the reduction in the regulatory oversight of banks and in some <b>cases</b> <b>depth</b> of management.

50|$|Carbonitriding {{also has}} other {{advantages}} over carburizing. To begin, {{it has a}} greater resistance to softening during tempering and increased fatigue and impact strength. It is possible to use both carbonitriding and carburizing together to form optimum conditions of deeper case depths and therefore performance of the part in industry. This method is applied particularly to steels with low case hardenability, such as {{the seat of the}} valve. The process applied is initially carburizing to the required <b>case</b> <b>depth</b> (up to 2.5 mm) at around 900-955°C, and then carbonitriding to achieve required carbonitrided <b>case</b> <b>depth.</b> The parts are then oil quenched, and the resulting part has a harder case than possibly achieved for carburization, and the addition of the carbonitrided layer increases the residual compressive stresses in the case such that the contact fatigue resistance and strength gradient are both increased.|$|E
50|$|Carbonitriding forms a hard, {{wear-resistant}} case, {{is typically}} 0.07 mm to 0.5 mm thick, and generally has higher hardness than a carburized case. <b>Case</b> <b>depth</b> is {{tailored to the}} application; a thicker case increases the wear life of the part.

At the elevated temperatures (typically greater than 300⁰C, usually between 700 and 1100⁰C) of the kiln, the aluminum is in its liquid phase and diffuses into the surface of the metal and forms an alloy with the substrate.

Four-point alternating current potential drop (ACPD) method also has the potential to evaluate different case depths. The potential drop was measured on a series of 12 ̆ 2 diameter induction-hardened and carburized steel rod samples using a co-linear probe with pins aligned parallel to the axis of the rod.

40|$|Case {{hardening}} treatments offer a {{means of}} enhancing the strength and wear properties of parts made from steels. Generally applied to near-finished components, the processes impart a high-hardness wear-resistant surface which, with sufficient depth, can also improve fatigue strength. Applications range from simple mild steel pressings to heavy-duty alloy-steel transmission components. The characteristics of case hardening are the surface hardness, effective <b>case</b> <b>depth,</b> and depth profile of the residual stress. The specified <b>case</b> <b>depth</b> varies for different applications. It is useful {{to be able to}} measure the <b>case</b> <b>depth</b> nondestructively to ensure the specification is met.;In the work outlined in this dissertation, the aim is to evaluate the properties of case hardened parts nondestructively. The case hardening process produces a change in the electromagnetic properties of the steel components in the near surface region. Consequently, the electrical conductivity and magnetic permeability have different values near the surface compared with those of the substrate. It is assumed that the conductivity and permeability variation with depth is indicative of the hardness profile allowing the <b>case</b> <b>depth</b> to be estimated from electromagnetic measurements. A two-layer model is adopted to approximate the case hardened steel parts as a homogeneous substrate layer surrounded by a homogeneous surface layer with uniform thickness. Alternating current potential drop (ACPD) theoretical calculations have been performed and compared with experimental measurements for both case hardened cylindrical rods and homogeneous metal plates. Driver and pick-up coils have been used for eddy current induction measurements on the cylindrical rod specimens. The multi-frequency measurement data are used to estimate the <b>case</b> <b>depth</b> by model-based inversion.

40|$|The {{investigation}} {{reported in}} this thesis was prompted {{by the desire to}} develop an easy and reliable nondestructive method of testing to monitor changes in elastic properties of metals when they are subjected to creep, fatigue, and case hardening. The possibilities of the useful application of such a test will be invaluable to the aircraft industry. It was 'therefore suggested that the specimens used should be made from the type of materials Used in the aircraft industry. These were made of high strength alloys. The method of nondestructive testing was to excite ultrasonic surface waves {{on the surface of the}} specimens, and measuring the changes in surface wave velocity, when the material (specimens) are subjected to creep, fatigue, and case hardening. An ultrasonic goniometer was designed and constructed and, using the goniometer; critical angle reflectometry was used to excite the surface waves on the surface of the specimens. For the measurements during fatigue,specimens were fatigued at high stress levels and low cycles. Constant amplitude alternating stresses with the specimen remaining in tension during the whole program type of loading was used. Most of the specimens were made of titanium (Ti 230) but some work was also done on mild steel. The specimens used for creep were made from C 263 Nickel alloy and Titanium 230. Each specimen was subjected to creep to a certain degree. The case hardened specimens were made of steel with carburized case. It was found that using ultrasonic surface waves it was possible to determine the <b>depth</b> of <b>case</b> hardening. Using a calibration curve drawn from the results obtained of the change in surface wave velocity for specimens with known <b>case</b> <b>depths,</b> it was possible to predict the <b>case</b> <b>depths</b> of specimens of unknown case depths; by measuring their surface wave velocities. Also, a frequency effect was observed whereby lower frequencies were found to better for detecting larger. <b>case</b> <b>depths</b> When specimens which were subjected to creep were considered, it was found that ultrasonic surface waves can detect early stages of creep. This was the case for both materials studied. A difference was observed in' the response to the surface waves for the two materials studied. In both cases a frequency effect was observed in that higher frequencies were better for detecting early creep. For both materials studied during fatigue, most of the change in surface wave velocity occurred during the very early stages of fatigue life. During the latter stages of fatigue life the rate of change was very much lower. No pattern was observed for the change in surface wave velocity with the number of fatigue cycles for either material. Lastly, measurements were done on brass, copper, aluminium, stainless steel and mild steel bar specimens, at the critical angle of incidence. For all the specimens it was found that the surface wave velocity changed with frequency. ...|$|R
