5|$|Enzymes with single-substrate {{mechanisms}} include isomerases such as triosephosphateisomerase or bisphosphoglycerate mutase, intramolecular lyases such as {{adenylate cyclase}} and the hammerhead ribozyme, an RNA lyase. However, some enzymes that {{only have a}} single substrate do not fall into this category of mechanisms. <b>Catalase</b> {{is an example of}} this, as the enzyme reacts with a first molecule of hydrogen peroxide substrate, becomes oxidised and is then reduced by a second molecule of substrate. Although a single substrate is involved, the existence of a modified enzyme intermediate means that the mechanism of <b>catalase</b> is actually a ping–pong mechanism, a type of mechanism that is discussed in the Multi-substrate reactions section below.|$|E
5|$|H. pylori is microaerophilic—that is, it {{requires}} oxygen, but at lower concentration {{than in the}} atmosphere. It contains a hydrogenase that can produce energy by oxidizing molecular hydrogen (H2) made by intestinal bacteria. It produces oxidase, <b>catalase,</b> and urease.|$|E
5|$|To {{balance the}} {{oxidative}} state, {{plants and animals}} maintain complex systems of overlapping antioxidants, such as glutathione and enzymes (e.g., <b>catalase</b> and superoxide dismutase) produced internally or the dietary antioxidants: vitamin A, vitamin C, and vitamin E.|$|E
5|$|To {{counteract}} these reactive oxygen species, cells contain numerous antioxidant systems, including antioxidant vitamins such as vitamin C {{and vitamin}} E, and antioxidant enzymes such as superoxide dismutase, <b>catalase,</b> and peroxidases, which detoxify the reactive species, limiting {{damage to the}} cell.|$|E
5|$|Ethanol {{extracts}} of {{the fruit}} body are high in antioxidant activity, and have been shown in laboratory tests to have anti-inflammatory activity comparable to the drug diclofenac. Studies with mouse models have also demonstrated hepatoprotective (liver-protecting) ability, possibly by restoring diminished levels of the antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase and <b>catalase</b> caused by experimental exposure to the liver-damaging chemical carbon tetrachloride.|$|E
5|$|Oxidative {{damage in}} DNA can cause cancer. Several {{antioxidant}} enzymes such as superoxide dismutase, <b>catalase,</b> glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase, glutathione S-transferase etc. protect DNA from oxidative stress. It {{has been proposed}} that polymorphisms in these enzymes are associated with DNA damage and subsequently the individual's risk of cancer susceptibility.|$|E
5|$|The most {{commonly}} known and studied bioinorganic iron compounds (biological iron molecules) are the heme proteins: examples are hemoglobin, myoglobin, and cytochrome P450. These compounds participate in transporting gases, building enzymes, and transferring electrons. Metalloproteins are {{a group of}} proteins with metal ion cofactors. Some examples of iron metalloproteins are ferritin and rubredoxin. Many enzymes vital to life contain iron, such as catalase,O2: H2O2 Oxidoreductase: <b>Catalase</b> Structural Tutorial | url = http://biology.kenyon.edu/BMB/Chime/catalase/frames/cattx.htm#Proposed%20Mechanism%20of%20Catalase | accessdate = 2007-02-11}} lipoxygenases, and IRE-BP.|$|E
5|$|Transition metals {{are usually}} present as trace {{elements}} in organisms, with zinc and iron being most abundant of those. These metals {{are used in}} some proteins as cofactors and are essential for the activity of enzymes such as <b>catalase</b> and oxygen-carrier proteins such as hemoglobin. Metal cofactors are bound tightly to specific sites in proteins; although enzyme cofactors can be modified during catalysis, they always return to their original state {{by the end of}} the reaction catalyzed. Metal micronutrients are taken up into organisms by specific transporters and bind to storage proteins such as ferritin or metallothionein when not in use.|$|E
5|$|Other {{species have}} special glands to produce {{deterrent}} chemicals. The defensive glands of carabid ground beetles produce {{a variety of}} hydrocarbons, aldehydes, phenols, quinones, esters, and acids released from an opening {{at the end of}} the abdomen. African carabid beetles (for example, Anthia and Thermophilum – Thermophilum is sometimes included within Anthia) employ the same chemicals as ants: formic acid. Bombardier beetles have well-developed pygidial glands that empty from the sides of the intersegment membranes between the seventh and eighth abdominal segments. The gland is made of two containing chambers, one for hydroquinones and hydrogen peroxide, the other holding hydrogen peroxide and <b>catalase</b> enzymes. These chemicals mix and result in an explosive ejection, reaching a temperature of around , with the breakdown of hydroquinone to hydrogen, oxygen, and quinone. The oxygen propels the noxious chemical spray as a jet that can be aimed accurately at predators.|$|E
5|$|The {{biochemical}} {{identity of}} enzymes was still {{unknown in the}} early 1900s. Many scientists observed that enzymatic activity was associated with proteins, but others (such as Nobel laureate Richard Willstätter) argued that proteins were merely carriers for the true enzymes and that proteins per se were incapable of catalysis. In 1926, James B. Sumner showed that the enzyme urease was a pure protein and crystallized it; he did likewise for the enzyme <b>catalase</b> in 1937. The conclusion that pure proteins can be enzymes was definitively demonstrated by John Howard Northrop and Wendell Meredith Stanley, {{who worked on the}} digestive enzymes pepsin (1930), trypsin and chymotrypsin. These three scientists were awarded the 1946 Nobel Prize in Chemistry.|$|E
5|$|The {{efficiency}} of an enzyme {{can be expressed}} in terms of kcat/Km. This is also called the specificity constant and incorporates the rate constants for all steps in the reaction up to and including the first irreversible step. Because the specificity constant reflects both affinity and catalytic ability, it is useful for comparing different enzymes against each other, or the same enzyme with different substrates. The theoretical maximum for the specificity constant is called the diffusion limit and is about 108 to 109 (M−1 s−1). At this point every collision of the enzyme with its substrate will result in catalysis, and the rate of product formation is not limited by the reaction rate but by the diffusion rate. Enzymes with this property are called catalytically perfect or kinetically perfect. Example of such enzymes are triose-phosphate isomerase, carbonic anhydrase, acetylcholinesterase, <b>catalase,</b> fumarase, β-lactamase, and superoxide dismutase. The turnover of such enzymes can reach several million reactions per second.|$|E
25|$|Mice genetically {{engineered}} to lack <b>catalase</b> are initially phenotypically normal., however, <b>catalase</b> deficiency in mice {{may increase the}} likelihood of developing obesity, fatty liver, and type 2 diabetes. Some humans have very low levels of <b>catalase</b> (acatalasia), yet show few ill effects.|$|E
25|$|Almost all aerobic {{microorganisms}} use <b>catalase.</b> It is {{also present}} in some anaerobic microorganisms, such as Methanosarcina barkeri. <b>Catalase</b> is also universal among plants and occurs in most fungi.|$|E
25|$|Low {{levels of}} <b>catalase</b> {{may play a}} role in the graying process of human hair. Hydrogen {{peroxide}} is naturally produced by the body and broken down by <b>catalase.</b> If <b>catalase</b> levels decline, hydrogen peroxide cannot be broken down so well. The hydrogen peroxide interferes with the production of melanin, the pigment that gives hair its color.|$|E
25|$|<b>Catalase</b> was {{not noticed}} until 1818 when Louis Jacques Thénard, who {{discovered}} H2O2 (hydrogen peroxide), suggested its breakdown {{is caused by}} an unknown substance. In 1900, Oscar Loew {{was the first to}} give it the name <b>catalase,</b> and found it in many plants and animals. In 1937 <b>catalase</b> from beef liver was crystallised by James B. Sumner and Alexander Dounce and the molecular weight was found in 1938.|$|E
25|$|Any {{heavy metal}} ion (such as copper cations in copper(II) sulfate) {{can act as}} a noncompetitive {{inhibitor}} of <b>catalase.</b> Furthermore, the poison cyanide is a competitive inhibitor of <b>catalase</b> at high concentrations of hydrogen peroxide.|$|E
25|$|The <b>catalase</b> test {{is one of}} {{the three}} main tests used by microbiologists to {{identify}} species of bacteria. If the bacteria possess <b>catalase</b> (i.e., are catalase-positive), when a small amount of bacterial isolate is added to hydrogen peroxide, bubbles of oxygen are observed. The <b>catalase</b> test is done by placing a drop of hydrogen peroxide on a microscope slide. An applicator stick is touched to the colony, and the tip is then smeared onto the hydrogen peroxide drop.|$|E
25|$|<b>Catalase</b> is {{a common}} enzyme found in nearly all living organisms exposed to oxygen (such as bacteria, plants, and animals). It catalyzes the {{decomposition}} of hydrogen peroxide to water and oxygen. It {{is a very important}} enzyme in protecting the cell from oxidative damage by reactive oxygen species (ROS). Likewise, <b>catalase</b> {{has one of the highest}} turnover numbers of all enzymes; one <b>catalase</b> molecule can convert millions of hydrogen peroxide molecules to water and oxygen each second.|$|E
25|$|While the <b>catalase</b> test alone cannot {{identify}} a particular organism, it can aid identification {{when combined with}} other tests such as antibiotic resistance. The presence of <b>catalase</b> in bacterial cells depends on both the growth condition and the medium used to grow the cells.|$|E
25|$|<b>Catalase</b> {{is used in}} {{the food}} {{industry}} for removing hydrogen peroxide from milk prior to cheese production. Another use is in food wrappers where it prevents food from oxidizing. <b>Catalase</b> is also used in the textile industry, removing hydrogen peroxide from fabrics to make sure the material is peroxide-free.|$|E
25|$|<b>Catalase</b> is a tetramer of four {{polypeptide}} chains, each {{over 500}} amino acids long.O2: H2O2 Oxidoreductase | work = <b>Catalase</b> Structural Tutorial Text | url = http://biology.kenyon.edu/BMB/Chime/catalase/frames/cattx.htm | accessdate = 2007-02-11}} It contains four iron-containing heme groups {{that allow the}} enzyme to react with the hydrogen peroxide. The optimum pH for human <b>catalase</b> is approximately 7, and has a fairly broad maximum: the rate of reaction does not change appreciably between pH 6.8 and 7.5. The pH optimum for other catalases varies between 4 and 11 depending on the species. The optimum temperature also varies by species.|$|E
25|$|<b>Catalase</b> enzymes {{from various}} species have vastly differing optimum temperatures. Poikilothermic animals {{typically}} have catalases with optimum {{temperatures in the}} range of 15-25°C, while mammalian or avian catalases might have optimum temperatures above 35°C, and catalases from plants vary depending on their growth habit. In contrast, <b>catalase</b> isolated from the hyperthermophile archaeon Pyrobaculum calidifontis has a temperature optimum of 90°C.|$|E
25|$|The {{amino acid}} {{sequence}} of bovine <b>catalase</b> was determined in 1969, and the three-dimensional structure in 1981.|$|E
25|$|Like alcohol dehydrogenase, <b>catalase</b> {{converts}} ethanol to acetaldehyde, but it {{is unlikely}} that this reaction is physiologically significant.|$|E
25|$|In humans, porphyrins are {{the main}} {{precursors}} of heme, an essential constituent of hemoglobin, myoglobin, <b>catalase,</b> peroxidase, and P450 liver cytochromes.|$|E
25|$|The {{presence}} of <b>catalase</b> in a microbial or tissue sample {{can be demonstrated}} by adding hydrogen peroxide and observing the reaction. The production of oxygen {{can be seen by}} the formation of bubbles. This easy test, which can be seen with the naked eye, without the aid of instruments, is possible because <b>catalase</b> has a very high specific activity, which produces a detectable response, as well as the fact that one of the products is a gas.|$|E
25|$|<b>Catalase</b> {{is usually}} {{located in a}} {{cellular}} organelle called the peroxisome. Peroxisomes in plant cells are involved in photorespiration (the use of oxygen and production of carbon dioxide) and symbiotic nitrogen fixation (the breaking apart of diatomic nitrogen (N2) to reactive nitrogen atoms). Hydrogen peroxide {{is used as a}} potent antimicrobial agent when cells are infected with a pathogen. Catalase-positive pathogens, such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Legionella pneumophila, and Campylobacter jejuni, make <b>catalase</b> to deactivate the peroxide radicals, thus allowing them to survive unharmed within the host.|$|E
25|$|Within the Lactobacillus genus {{are both}} {{heterofermentative}} and homofermentative species. All lactobacilli involved in winemaking are Gram-positive and microaerophilic, with most species lacking the <b>catalase</b> enzyme {{needed to protect}} themselves from oxidative stress.|$|E
25|$|Other {{less common}} antigens include HMG1 (p-ANCA pattern), HMG2 (p-ANCA pattern), alpha enolase (p and c-ANCA pattern), <b>catalase</b> (p and c-ANCA pattern), beta {{glucuronidase}} (p-ANCA pattern), azurocidin (p and c-ANCA pattern), actin (p and a-ANCA) and h-lamp-2 (c-ANCA).|$|E
25|$|A {{minor use}} is in contact lens hygiene – a few lens-cleaning {{products}} disinfect the lens using a hydrogen peroxide solution; a solution containing <b>catalase</b> is {{then used to}} decompose the hydrogen peroxide before the lens is used again.|$|E
25|$|The large {{majority}} of known organisms use <b>catalase</b> in every organ, with particularly high concentrations occurring in the liver in mammals. One unique use of <b>catalase</b> occurs in the bombardier beetle. This beetle has two sets of liquids that are stored separately in two paired glands. The larger of the pair, the storage chamber or reservoir, contains hydroquinones and hydrogen peroxide, while the smaller, the reaction chamber, contains catalases and peroxidases. To activate the noxious spray, the beetle mixes {{the contents of the}} two compartments, causing oxygen to be liberated from hydrogen peroxide. The oxygen oxidizes the hydroquinones and also acts as the propellant. The oxidation reaction is very exothermic (ΔH = −202.8 kJ/mol) and rapidly heats the mixture to the boiling point.|$|E
25|$|Short-term {{induction}} of {{oxidative stress}} due to calorie restriction increases life span in Caenorhabditis elegans by promoting stress defense, specifically by inducing an enzyme called <b>catalase.</b> As shown by Michael Ristow and co-workers nutritive antioxidants completely abolish this extension of life span by inhibiting {{a process called}} mitohormesis.|$|E
25|$|Hydrogen {{peroxide}} is a harmful {{byproduct of}} many normal metabolic processes; to prevent damage to cells and tissues, {{it must be}} quickly converted into other, less dangerous substances. To this end, <b>catalase</b> is frequently used by cells to rapidly catalyze the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide into less-reactive gaseous oxygen and water molecules.|$|E
25|$|Furthermore, for {{differentiation}} on {{the species}} level, <b>catalase</b> (positive for all Staphylococcus species), coagulase (fibrin clot formation, positive for S. aureus), DNAse (zone of clearance on DNase agar), lipase (a yellow color and rancid odor smell), and phosphatase (a pink color) tests are all done. For staphylococcal food poisoning, phage typing {{can be performed}} {{to determine whether the}} staphylococci recovered from the food were the source of infection.|$|E
25|$|Muscle strength, {{and stamina}} for {{sustained}} physical effort, decline in function with age in humans and other species. Skeletal muscle is a tissue composed largely of multinucleated myofibers, elements {{that arise from}} the fusion of mononucleated myoblasts. Accumulation of DNA damage with age in mammalian muscle {{has been reported in}} at least 18 studies since 1971. We will mention here only two of the more recent studies in rodents plus one in humans. Hamilton et al. reported that the oxidative DNA damage 8-OHdG accumulates in heart and skeletal muscle (as well as in brain, kidney and liver) of both mouse and rat with age. In humans, increases in 8-OHdG with age were reported for skeletal muscle. <b>Catalase</b> is an enzyme that removes hydrogen peroxide, a reactive oxygen species, and thus limits oxidative DNA damage. In mice, when <b>catalase</b> expression is increased specifically in mitochondria, oxidative DNA damage (8-OHdG) in skeletal muscle is decreased and lifespan is increased by about 20%. These findings suggest that mitochondria are a significant source of the oxidative damages contributing to aging.|$|E
25|$|The genus is rich {{in organic}} acids {{including}} formic, butyric, linoleic, linolenic, malic, myristic, oleic and palmitic acids as well as phenolic compounds, and the amino acid α-alanine. Esters like ethyl butyrate, ethyl caproate, n-hexyl butyrate and n-hexyl caproate give the fruits their flavor and appetizing smell. Sugars, contained mainly in the fruit, are most significantly d-fructose, d-glucose and raffinose. Among enzymes, Passiflora {{was found to be}} rich in <b>catalase,</b> pectin methylesterase and phenolase.|$|E
