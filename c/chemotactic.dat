5|$|COPD {{develops}} as {{a significant}} and chronic inflammatory response to inhaled irritants. Chronic bacterial infections may also add to this inflammatory state. The inflammatory cells involved include neutrophil granulocytes and macrophages, two types of white blood cell. Those who smoke additionally have Tc1 lymphocyte involvement and some people with COPD have eosinophil involvement {{similar to that in}} asthma. Part of this cell response is brought on by inflammatory mediators such as <b>chemotactic</b> factors. Other processes involved with lung damage include oxidative stress produced by high concentrations of free radicals in tobacco smoke and released by inflammatory cells, and breakdown of the connective tissue of the lungs by proteases that are insufficiently inhibited by protease inhibitors. The destruction of the connective tissue of the lungs is what leads to emphysema, which then contributes to the poor airflow and, finally, poor absorption and release of respiratory gases. General muscle wasting that often occurs in COPD may be partly due to inflammatory mediators released by the lungs into the blood.|$|E
25|$|Chemotaxis assays are {{experimental}} {{tools for}} evaluation of <b>chemotactic</b> ability of prokaryotic or eukaryotic cells.|$|E
25|$|Organelle zone – {{is rich in}} {{platelet}} granules. Alpha granules contain clotting mediators such as factor V, factor VIII, fibrinogen, fibronectin, platelet-derived growth factor, and <b>chemotactic</b> agents. Delta granules, or dense bodies, contain ADP, calcium, serotonin, {{which are}} platelet-activating mediators.|$|E
25|$|Besides the {{above-mentioned}} two, {{most commonly used}} family of techniques {{a wide range of}} protocols were developed to measure <b>chemotactic</b> activity. Some of them are only qualitative, like aggregation tests, where small pieces of agar or filters are placed onto a slide and accumulation of cells around is measured.|$|E
25|$|In general, {{the most}} {{important}} requisite is to calibrate the incubation time of the assay both to the model cell and the ligand to be evaluated. Too short incubation time results no cells in the sample, while too long time perturbs the concentration gradients and measures more chemokinetic than <b>chemotactic</b> responses.|$|E
25|$|Platelets release platelet-derived {{growth factor}} (PDGF), a potent <b>chemotactic</b> agent; and TGF beta, which stimulates the {{deposition}} of extracellular matrix; fibroblast growth factor, insulin-like growth factor 1, platelet-derived epidermal growth factor, and vascular endothelial growth factor. Local {{application of these}} factors in increased concentrations through Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) is used as an adjunct in wound healing.|$|E
25|$|The use of cAMP as a <b>chemotactic</b> {{agent is}} not {{established}} {{in any other}} organism. In developmental biology, {{this is one of}} the comprehensible examples of chemotaxis, which is important for an understanding of human inflammation, arthritis, asthma, lymphocyte trafficking, and axon guidance. Phagocytosis is used in immune surveillance and antigen presentation, while cell-type determination, cell sorting, and pattern formation are basic features of embryogenesis that may be studied with these organisms.|$|E
25|$|The {{coagulation}} system {{overlaps with}} the immune system. Some {{products of the}} coagulation system {{can contribute to the}} non-specific defenses by their ability to increase vascular permeability and act as <b>chemotactic</b> agents for phagocytic cells. In addition, some of the products of the coagulation system are directly antimicrobial. For example, beta-lysine, a protein produced by platelets during coagulation, can cause lysis of many Gram-positive bacteria by acting as a cationic detergent. Many acute-phase proteins of inflammation are involved in the coagulation system.|$|E
25|$|Mast {{cells are}} {{a type of}} innate immune cell that reside in {{connective}} tissue and in the mucous membranes. They are intimately associated with wound healing and defense against pathogens, but are also often associated with allergy and anaphylaxis. When activated, mast cells rapidly release characteristic granules, rich in histamine and heparin, along with various hormonal mediators and chemokines, or <b>chemotactic</b> cytokines into the environment. Histamine dilates blood vessels, causing the characteristic signs of inflammation, and recruits neutrophils and macrophages.|$|E
25|$|This way of {{evaluation}} deals with agar-agar or gelatine containing semi-solid layers made {{prior to the}} experiment. Small wells are cut into the layer and filled with cells and the test substance. Cells can migrate towards the chemical gradient in the semi solid layer or under the layer as well. Some variations of the technique deal also with wells and parallel channels connected by a cut {{at the start of}} the experiment (PP-technique). Radial arrangement of PP-technique (3 or more channels) provides the possibility to compare <b>chemotactic</b> activity of different cell populations or study preference between ligands.|$|E
25|$|The {{coagulation}} system {{overlaps with}} the immune system. Coagulation can physically trap invading microbes in blood clots. Also, some {{products of the}} coagulation system {{can contribute to the}} innate immune system by their ability to increase vascular permeability and act as <b>chemotactic</b> agents for phagocytic cells. In addition, some of the products of the coagulation system are directly antimicrobial. For example, beta-lysine, an amino acid produced by platelets during coagulation, can cause lysis of many Gram-positive bacteria by acting as a cationic detergent. Many acute-phase proteins of inflammation are involved in the coagulation system. In addition, pathogenic bacteria may secrete agents that alter the coagulation system, e.g. coagulase and streptokinase.|$|E
25|$|The {{underlying}} {{idea that}} target cells secrete attractive or inducing factors {{and that their}} growth cones have a <b>chemotactic</b> sensitivity was first put forth by Santiago Ramon y Cajal in 1892. Cajal presented the idea as {{an explanation for the}} “intelligent force” axons appear to take when finding their target but admitted that he had no empirical data. The theory gained more attraction when experimental manipulation of axon targets yielded death of all innervating neurons. This developed the concept of target derived regulation which became the main tenet in the neurotrophic theory. Experiments that further supported this theory led to the identification of the first neurotrophic factor, nerve growth factor (NGF).|$|E
25|$|Chambers {{isolated}} by {{filters are}} proper tools for accurate determination of <b>chemotactic</b> behavior. The pioneer type of these chambers was constructed by Boyden. The motile cells are placed {{into the upper}} chamber, while fluid containing the test substance is filled into the lower one. The size of the motile cells to be investigated determines the pore size of the filter; {{it is essential to}} choose a diameter which allows active transmigration. For modelling in vivo conditions, several protocols prefer coverage of filter with molecules of extracellular matrix (collagen, elastin etc.) Efficiency of the measurements was increased by development of multiwell chambers (e.g. NeuroProbe), where 24, 96, 384 samples are evaluated in parallel. Advantage of this variant is that several parallels are assayed in identical conditions.|$|E
25|$|Eicosanoid {{biosynthesis}} {{begins when}} a cell is activated by mechanical trauma, ischemia, other physical perturbations, attack by pathogens, or stimuli made by nearby cells, tissues, or pathogens such as <b>chemotactic</b> factors, cytokines, growth factors, and even certain eicosanoids. The activated cells then mobilize enzymes, termed phospholipase A2's (PLA2s), capable of releasing ω-6 and ω-3 fatty acids from membrane storage. These fatty acids are bound in ester linkage to the SN2 position of membrane phospholipids; PLA2s act as esterases {{to release the}} fatty acid. There are several classes of PLA2s with type IV cytosolic PLA2s (cPLA2s) appearing {{to be responsible for}} releasing the fatty acids under many conditions of cell activation. The cPLA2s act specifically on phospholipids that contain AA, EPA or GPLA at their SN2 position. Interestingly, cPLA2 may also release the lysophospholipid that becomes platelet-activating factor.|$|E
25|$|For the {{treatment}} of acne, the most prescribed retinoid drug is 13-cis retinoic acid (isotretinoin). It reduces the size and secretion of the sebaceous glands. Although {{it is known that}} 40mg of isotretinoin will break down to an equivalent of 10mg of ATRA— the mechanism of action of the drug (original brand name Accutane) remains unknown and is a matter of some controversy. Isotretinoin reduces bacterial numbers in both the ducts and skin surface. This is thought to be a result of the reduction in sebum, a nutrient source for the bacteria. Isotretinoin reduces inflammation via inhibition of <b>chemotactic</b> responses of monocytes and neutrophils. Isotretinoin also has been shown to initiate remodeling of the sebaceous glands; triggering changes in gene expression that selectively induce apoptosis. Isotretinoin is a teratogen with a number of potential side-effects. Consequently, its use requires medical supervision.|$|E
500|$|The cell has <b>chemotactic</b> and {{negative}} phototactic capabilities in this phase, {{meaning that it}} is able to move towards nutrients and away from dangerous substances and light. The movements originate in the grainy cytoplasm, which streams by pulsation in one direction within the cell. In this way the cell reaches a speed of up to 1000µm per secondthe speed in plant cells is 2 to 78µm per second. A resting state, the so-called sclerotium, may occur in this phase. The sclerotium is a hardened, resistant form composed of numerous [...] "macrocysts", which enable the myxogastria to survive in adverse conditions, for example during winter or dry periods, in this phase.|$|E
2500|$|CXCL8 (IL-8) forms a <b>chemotactic</b> {{gradient}} that directs leukocytes towards site {{of tissue}} injury/infection (CCL2 {{has a similar}} function to CXCL8, inducing monocyte extravasation and development into macrophages); also activates leukocyte integrins ...|$|E
2500|$|Platelets contain dense {{granules}}, lambda granules and alpha granules. Activated platelets secrete {{the contents}} of these granules through their canalicular systems to the exterior. Simplistically, bound and activated platelets degranulate to release platelet <b>chemotactic</b> agents to attract more platelets {{to the site of}} endothelial injury. Granule characteristics: ...|$|E
2500|$|Collagen {{dressings}} {{are another}} way to provide the matrix for cellular proliferation and migration, while also keeping the wound moist and absorbing exudate. [...] Additionally Collagen {{has been shown to}} be <b>chemotactic</b> to human blood monocytes, which can enter the wound site and transform into beneficial wound-healing cells.|$|E
2500|$|The cytoskeletons of the {{leukocyte}}s are reorganised {{in such a}} {{way that}} the leukocytes are spread out over the endothelial cells. [...] In this form, leukocytes extend pseudopodia and pass through gaps between endothelial cells. Transmigration of the leukocyte occurs as PECAM proteins, found on the leukocyte and endothelial cell surfaces, interact and effectively pull the cell through the endothelium. Once through the endothelium, the leukocyte must penetrate the basement membrane. The mechanism for penetration is disputed, but may involve proteolytic digestion of the membrane, mechanical force, or both. The entire process of blood vessel escape is known as diapedesis. Once in the interstitial fluid, leukocytes migrate along a <b>chemotactic</b> gradient towards the site of injury or infection.|$|E
2500|$|In StochSim, each {{molecular}} species can {{be equipped with}} a number of binary state flags representing a particular modification. Reactions can be made dependent on a set of state flags set to particular values. In addition, the outcome of a reaction can include a state flag being changed. Moreover, entities can be arranged in geometric arrays (for instance, for holoenzymes consisting of several subunits), and reactions can be [...] "neighbor-sensitive", i.e. the probability of a reaction for a given entity is affected by the value of a state flag on a neighboring entity. These properties make StochSim ideally suited to modeling multi-state molecules arranged in holoenzymes or complexes of specified size. Indeed, StochSim has been used to model clusters of bacterial <b>chemotactic</b> receptors, and CaMKII holoenzymes.|$|E
2500|$|Dendritic cells engulf {{exogenous}} pathogens, such as bacteria, parasites or toxins in {{the tissues}} and then migrate, via <b>chemotactic</b> signals, to the T cell-enriched lymph nodes. During migration, dendritic cells undergo {{a process of}} maturation in which they lose most {{of their ability to}} engulf other pathogens, and develop an ability to communicate with T-cells. [...] The dendritic cell uses enzymes to chop the pathogen into smaller pieces, called antigens. In the lymph node, the dendritic cell displays these non-self antigens on its surface by coupling them to a receptor called the major histocompatibility complex, or MHC (also known in humans as human leukocyte antigen (HLA)). This MHC: antigen complex is recognized by T-cells passing through the lymph node. Exogenous antigens are usually displayed on MHC class II molecules, which activate CD4+T helper cells.|$|E
2500|$|In {{response}} to tissue injury, neutrophils leave the circulatory system {{in great numbers}} and gather {{at the site of}} tissue injury. [...] They are drawn to the site by chemotaxis, following a concentration gradient of <b>chemotactic</b> molecules until they reach the site of greatest concentration: the site of injury and microbial presence. [...] Once there, the antimicrobial action of superoxide and hydrogen peroxide, derived from the metabolic processes of the neutrophils, act to combat the microbial invasion. [...] While primarily mobilized to kill the invading microorganisms, the neutrophils actually cause a significant amount of host tissue damage as well. [...] Although the neutrophils themselves rarely remain alive {{for more than a few}} days, the excessive accumulation of dead neutrophils and the enzymes they released is a major cause of tissue breakdown in the acute phases of apical periodontitis.|$|E
2500|$|The IDH1 gene encodes for {{the enzyme}} isocitrate {{dehydrogenase}} 1 and is frequently mutated in glioblastoma (primary GBM: 5%, secondary GBM >80%). By producing very {{high concentrations of}} the [...] "oncometabolite" [...] D-2-hydroxyglutarate and dysregulating {{the function of the}} wild-type IDH1-enzyme it induces profound changes to the metabolism of IDH1-mutated glioblastoma, compared with IDH1 wild-type glioblastoma or healthy astrocytes. Among others, it increases the glioblastoma cells' dependence on glutamine or glutamate as an energy source. It has been hypothesized that IDH1-mutated glioblastoma are in a very high demand for glutamate and use this amino acid and neurotransmitter as a <b>chemotactic</b> signal. Since healthy astrocytes excrete glutamate, IDH1-mutated glioblastoma cells do not favor dense tumor structures but instead migrate, invade and disperse into healthy parts of the brain where glutamate concentrations are higher. This may explain the invasive behaviour of these IDH1-mutated glioblastoma.|$|E
2500|$|In the {{alternative}} pathway, C3b binds to Factor B. [...] Factor D releases Factor Ba from Factor B bound to C3b. [...] The complex of C3b(2)Bb is a protease which cleaves C5 into C5b and C5a. C5 convertase is also {{formed by the}} Classical Pathway when C3b binds C4b and C2a. C5a is an important <b>chemotactic</b> protein, helping recruit inflammatory cells. C3a is the precursor of an important cytokine (adipokine) named ASP (although this is not universally accepted [...] ) and is usually rapidly cleaved by carboxypeptidase B. [...] Both C3a and C5a have anaphylatoxin activity, directly triggering degranulation of mast cells as well as increasing vascular permeability and smooth muscle contraction. C5b initiates the membrane attack pathway, which results in the membrane attack complex (MAC), consisting of C5b, C6, C7, C8, and polymeric C9. MAC is the cytolytic endproduct of the complement cascade; it forms a transmembrane channel, which causes osmotic lysis of the target cell. Kupffer cells and other macrophage cell types help clear complement-coated pathogens. [...] As part of the innate immune system, elements of the complement cascade {{can be found in}} species earlier than vertebrates; most recently in the protostome horseshoe crab species, putting the origins of the system back further than was previously thought.|$|E

2500|$|Neuroregeneration in the {{peripheral}} nervous system (PNS) occurs to a significant degree. Axonal sprouts form at the proximal stump and grow until they enter the distal stump. The growth of the sprouts is governed by <b>chemotactic</b> factors secreted from Schwann cells (neurolemmocytes). Injury to {{the peripheral}} nervous system immediately elicits the migration of phagocytes, Schwann cells, and macrophages to the lesion site in order to clear away debris such as damaged tissue. When a nerve axon is severed, the end still attached to the cell body is labeled the proximal segment, while the other end is called the [...] distal segment. After injury, the proximal end swells and experiences some retrograde degeneration, but once the debris is cleared, it begins to sprout axons {{and the presence of}} growth cones can be detected. The proximal axons are able to regrow as long as the cell body is intact, and they have made contact with the Schwann cells in the endoneurial channel or tube. Human axon growth rates can reach 1mm/day in small nerves and 5mm/day in large nerves. The distal segment, however, experiences Wallerian degeneration within hours of the injury; the axons and myelin degenerate, but the endoneurium remains. In the later stages of regeneration the remaining endoneurial tube directs axon growth back to the correct targets. During Wallerian degeneration, Schwann cells grow in ordered columns along the endoneurial tube, creating a band of Büngner (boB) that protects and preserves the endoneurial channel. Also, macrophages and Schwann cells release neurotrophic factors that enhance re-growth.|$|E
2500|$|Asbestosis is the {{scarring}} of {{lung tissue}} (beginning around terminal bronchioles and alveolar ducts and extending into the alveolar walls) {{resulting from the}} inhalation of asbestos fibers. There {{are two types of}} fibers: amphibole (thin and straight) and serpentine (curly). All forms of asbestos fibers are responsible for human disease as they are able to penetrate deeply into the lungs. [...] When such fibers reach the alveoli (air sacs) in the lung, where oxygen is transferred into the blood, the foreign bodies (asbestos fibers) cause the activation of the lungs' local immune system and provoke an inflammatory reaction dominated by lung macrophages that respond to <b>chemotactic</b> factors activated by the fibers. This inflammatory reaction can be described as chronic rather than acute, with a slow ongoing progression of the immune system attempting to eliminate the foreign fibers. Macrophages phagocytose (ingest) the fibers and stimulate fibroblasts to deposit connective tissue. Due to the asbestos fibers' natural resistance to digestion, some macrophages are killed and others release inflammatory chemical signals, attracting further lung macrophages and fibrolastic cells that synthesize fibrous scar tissue, which eventually becomes diffuse and can progress in heavily exposed individuals. This tissue can be seen microscopically soon after exposure in animal models. [...] Some asbestos fibers become layered by an iron-containing proteinaceous material (ferruginous body) in cases of heavy exposure where about 10% of the fibers become coated. [...] Most inhaled asbestos fibers remain uncoated. [...] About 20% of the inhaled fibers are transported by cytoskeletal components of the alveolar epithelium to the interstitial compartment of the lung where they interact with macrophages and mesenchymal cells. The cytokines, transforming growth factor beta and tumor necrosis factor alpha, appear to play major roles in the development of [...] scarring inasmuch as the process can be blocked in animal models by preventing the expression of the growth factors. The result is fibrosis in the interstitial space, thus asbestosis. This fibrotic scarring causes alveolar walls to thicken, which reduces elasticity and gas diffusion, reducing oxygen transfer to the blood as well as the removal of carbon dioxide. [...] This can result in shortness of breath, a common symptom exhibited by individuals with asbestosis.|$|E

The diverse features of the chemotaxis receptors and ligands allows for the possibility of selecting <b>chemotactic</b> responder cells with a simple chemotaxis assay. By <b>chemotactic</b> selection, we can determine whether a still-uncharacterized molecule acts via the long- or the short-term receptor pathway.
