50|$|Aquatic plants {{thriving}} {{in the shallow}} lake include bladderwort, <b>common</b> <b>club-rush,</b> and water lilies.

50|$|Scirpus is a genus of aquatic, grass-like {{species in}} the family Cyperaceae (the sedges), many with the <b>common</b> names <b>club-rush</b> or bulrush (see also bulrush for other plant genera so-named). Other common names are deergrass or grassweed. They have grass-like leaves, and {{clusters}} of small spikelets, often brown. Some species (e.g. S. lacustris) can reach a height of 3 m, while others (e.g. S. supinus) are much smaller, only reaching 20-30 cm tall.|$|R
25|$|There {{are over}} 600 {{species of plants}} are {{recorded}} in the reservation. Several of them are endangered natural rarities and listed in the Serbia's Red Book of Endangered Species: European white water-lily, yellow waterlily, water soldier, fringed water-lily, marsh nettle, sweet flag, aquatic bladderwort, triangular <b>club-rush,</b> <b>common</b> mare's tail, water violet, greater spearwort and the endemic Pannonian plain species of Pannonian cornflower. In the Valjevac section of Zasavica a rare and endangered marshland bio-community Acoro-Glyceretum maximae is found.|$|R
50|$|Isolepis setacea (syn. Scirpus setaceus) is {{a species}} of {{flowering}} plant in the sedge family known by the <b>common</b> names bristle <b>club-rush</b> and bristleleaf bulrush. It is native to Eurasia and Africa, and possibly Australasia. It {{can be found in}} other places, including some areas in North America, where it is an introduced species. It grows in many types of moist and wet habitat, often in coastal regions, and sometimes inland. It is a perennial herb which forms mats of very thin, grooved, erect or arching stems up to about 20 centimeters tall. The leaves sheath the stem bases and have short, flat, thick blades. The inflorescence is a solitary spikelet just a few millimeters long, or a cluster of up to three spikelets. These are accompanied by a stiff bract extending past the flowers.|$|R
50|$|Schoeneoplectus lacustris, the lakeshore bulrush or <b>common</b> <b>club-rush,</b> is {{a species}} of club-rush (genus Schoenoplectus) that grows in fresh water across Europe and some {{neighbouring}} areas.|$|E
50|$|An {{inventory}} of aquatic plants in 1997 showed {{the western and}} southern parts of the lake are dominated by spiked water-milfoil and yellow water-lily, while the eastern part is dominated by <b>common</b> <b>club-rush</b> and common reed. Stratiotes aloides is found near the lake outlet.|$|E
50|$|Despite their proximity, the two pools differ ecologically. 'Double Kettle' is fed {{by surface}} runoff and its water is turbid, {{supporting}} only an impoverished surface vegetation of pondweeds, including the alien Canadian pondweed, Elodea canadensis; it is fringed mainly by common reed, Phragmites australis, with some saw-sedge and <b>common</b> <b>club-rush,</b> Scirpus lacustris.|$|E
50|$|A stony {{shore line}} fringes {{much of the}} lake, where there are species such as spike-rush (Eleocharis sp.) jointed rush (Polygonum persicaria), marsh pennywort (Hydrocotyle vulgaris), and sedges (Carex spp.). A narrow fringe of emigerent plant species {{dominated}} by common reed (Phragmites australis) and <b>common</b> <b>club-rush</b> (Schoenoplectus lacustris) occurs along some stretches of the lakeshore.|$|E
50|$|In 1998, a {{wide range}} of aquatic plants were {{documented}} in the lake: reed, <b>common</b> <b>club-rush,</b> common bulrush, lesser bulrush, yellow iris, alisma, branched bur-reed, water hemlock, marsh calla, water-soldier, yellow water-lily, white water-lily, broad-leaved pondweed, blunt-leaved pondweed, whorled water-milfoil, rigid hornwort, common bladderwort, pondweed, bog-bean, frogbit, lesser duckweed, greater duckweed, and ivy-leaved duckweed.|$|E

5000|$|Following {{a survey}} in 2007 the {{condition}} of Carrickaport Lough was reported as [...] "unsatisfactory" [...] with Filamentous algae present, and pollution, along with a serious zebra mussel infestation, being also reported. Carrickaport Lough is reed-fringed, with approximately one fifth of subsrate vegetation being <b>common</b> <b>club-rush,</b> while Potamogeton pondweed and the alien species Elodea canadensis are also present.|$|E
50|$|The {{aquatic flora}} {{composed}} of reed, <b>common</b> <b>club-rush,</b> flowering rush, yellow iris, greater water-parsnip, brooklime, bulbous rush, toad rush, eight-stamened waterwort, needle spike-rush, spring quillwort, amphibious bistort, pale persicaria, rigid hornwort, horned pondweed, perfoliate pondweed, blunt-leaved pondweed, grass-wrack pondweed, fennel pondweed, various-leaved pondweed, lesser pondweed, fan-leaved water-goosefoot, whorled water-milfoil, alternate water-milfoil, spiked water-milfoil, Canadian waterweed, Nuttall's waterweed, and common duckweed. There are stoneworts such as Chara delicatula and Nitella flexilis.|$|E
50|$|The two meres have nutrient-rich or {{eutrophic}} {{open water}} with the dominant aquatic plants being water lilies; Big Mere has both white and yellow water lilies, while Little Mere has predominantly white. Both meres are surrounded by well-developed reed beds, with Big Mere having a particularly large variety of species including <b>common</b> <b>club-rush,</b> greater pond-sedge, lesser reedmace and tufted-sedge, which is rare in Cheshire. Big Mere has a narrow fringe of predominantly alder woodland. The SSSI also encompasses damp grassland between and around the two meres, which contains {{a wide variety of}} plant species including brown sedge and purple small-reed, as well as marsh fern and meadow thistle, which are rarely found in Cheshire. A total of 108 plant species has been recorded at the site.|$|E
