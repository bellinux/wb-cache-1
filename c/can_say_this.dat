Therefore nobody <b>can</b> <b>say</b> <b>this</b> {{is a time of}} high culture. If you eat poison you will die. If {{electricity}} hits the body you will die. If you oppose the Brahmin you will die. Gandhi did not advocate the eradication of Varnasrama Dharma structure but sees in it a task for the humanisation of society and social change possible within its structure. The consequence of this would be continued high-caste leadership. Gandhi adapted Brahmins to social change without depriving them of their leadership".|$|E
500|$|Spears' {{appearance}} was critically acclaimed by most critics. Linda Stasi of the New York Post asserted that Spears looked [...] "slim [...] trim and gorgeous" [...] and that [...] "her acting was {{nothing short of}} adorably believable". Stasi concluded that Spears' cameo was the highlight of [...] "Ten Sessions". David Hinckley of New York Daily News echoed similar sentiments, avouching that she [...] "proved [...] she can act every bit as well as she can sing". Michelle Zoromski of IGN argued however that while Spears' {{appearance was}} a [...] "nice change of pace from her latest public appearances", it was nonetheless a [...] "bit clunky and not as seamless as other guest roles have been on the show". Donna Bowman of The A.V. Club was also less enthusiastic about the singer's performance. Bowman opined: [...] "The Big Britney Episode, as it will henceforth be known, wasn't really much to get all huffy over. You <b>can</b> <b>say</b> <b>this</b> for the [...] team: They tend to minimize the annoyance factor of their special guest stars. Britney was a sideshow, and she got her couple of laughs, but she didn't hog the screen time." ...|$|E

Whether to call homosexuality a crime and treat it as one {{in this day and age}} is questionable" [...] which is interpreted as Sangh's support to decriminalisation of homosexuality.|$|E

In 1997 it was named the 39th greatest album of all time in the BBC's [...] "Music of the Millennium" [...] poll. Since 2001, it has appeared in critics' best-album lists compiled by VH-1 (at number 6), Mojo (number 27) and Rolling Stone (number 5), was among Time magazine's selection of the [...] "All-Time 100 Albums", and was favoured over Revolver in Chris Smith's book 101 Albums That Changed Popular Music. In 2012, Rolling Stone again placed Rubber Soul at number 5 on the magazine's revised list of the [...] "500 Greatest Albums of All Time". It also appeared in the same publication's 2014 list of the [...] "40 Most Groundbreaking Albums of All Time", where the editors concluded: [...] "You <b>can</b> <b>say</b> <b>this</b> represents 'maturity,' call it 'art' or credit it for moving rock away from singles to album-length statements – but regardless Rubber Soul accelerated popular music's creative arms race, driving competitors like the Stones, the Beach Boys and Dylan to dismantle expectations and create new ones." ...|$|E
