25|$|An {{undergraduate}} {{program was}} conceived, {{for students who}} had completed Class XII, during the Centenary Celebrations in 2009. The first batch of students was admitted in 2011. The program offers a four-year Bachelor of Science (Research) course in six disciplines: Biology, Chemistry, Environmental Science, Material Science, Mathematics, and Physics. The course aims at exposing the students to the inter-disciplinary nature in which scientific research is done in many upcoming fields, and <b>comes</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> when the importance of science education at the undergraduate level is emphasised and several incentives are provided by the Government to promote the same.|$|E
25|$|Justice Loh {{also created}} a buzz in legal circles by departing from the {{inherent}} tendency test and instead favouring the real risk test. According to lawyers who had studied such cases, what the judge did was significant because the real risk formula is clearer, {{even though he had}} defined it broadly. Under his definition, a statement with even a small risk of undermining public confidence in the courts would be found to be in contempt. The use of the real risk test is also significant as it <b>comes</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> when the Government is planning to codify the law on contempt.|$|E

500|$|In 2015, South Australian Premier Jay Weatherill {{announced}} that a Royal Commission would be held to investigate the state's role in the nuclear fuel cycle. South Australia is currently home to four of Australia's five uranium mines, {{and the possibility of}} the state developing nuclear power generation, enrichment and waste storage facilities have previously proven to be contentious issues. The Royal Commission <b>comes</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> of economic contraction for South Australia, which is suffering from job losses in mining and manufacturing sectors. Immediately following the announcement of the Royal Commission, emeritus Prof. Ian Lowe [...] suggested that the current inquiry risks retreading old ground already covered by several previous public inquiries and proposals for nuclear industrialisation. Lowe referred to the 2006 UMPNER review's finding that substantial government subsidies would be required to support nuclear industrial development in Australia, and the 1976-78 Ranger Uranium Environmental Inquiry (Fox Report), which drew attention to the problems of nuclear weapons proliferation and nuclear waste. On 17 April 2015, Lowe was selected as one of five members of the Nuclear Fuel Cycle Royal Commission Expert Advisory Committee.|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} heavily {{promoted}} and hyped, with some sources calling it [...] "much anticipated" [...] and [...] "long-awaited". In {{addition to the}} publicity about the coming-out of a character, [...] "There's Something About Marrying" [...] was discussed {{a lot in the}} media before its airing because of its gay marriage theme. The entertainment website MovieWeb predicted in October 2004 that the episode would become controversial when it aired because of the large children audience and [...] "also because it <b>comes</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> when many states are seeking to ban same-sex wedding ceremonies." [...] According to Knight Ridder, [...] "some conservative groups [...] growled in advance over the episode", but most pre-broadcast publicity was directed at the outing. Mark Pinsky, on the other hand, wrote in his book The Gospel According to The Simpsons that when the announcement that an episode of the show would focus on gay marriage was made, [...] "it stoked a debate that few issues and few television shows could." [...] Before its original airing, Pinsky was interviewed about the episode on ABC's World News Tonight, CNN, BBC Radio, and more, as {{the author of a book}} on religion in The Simpsons.|$|E
2500|$|At {{the end of}} July 2010, the Netherlands {{became the}} first NATO country to end its combat mission in Afghanistan after 4 years {{military}} deployment including the most intense period of hostilities.

The Atlantic Council described the decision as [...] "politically significant because it <b>comes</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> of rising casualties and growing doubts about the war." [...] Canada withdrew troops in 2011, but about 900 were left to train Afghani soldiers.|$|E

In addition, Cohen devoted significant column inches to the angry reactions of many of those named by Rosenfeld in his essay.|$|E
2500|$|Despite {{the series}} of {{escalating}} attacks, the government of Niger offered a number of concessions to foreign (especially French) interests in January 2008. Two French journalists, arrested on charges of espionage and aiding the rebels on 17 December, were formally charged with threatening state security and released on bail 18 January, to face trial later. [...] French press reports that Gabonese President Omar Bongo Ondimba intervened with President Mamadou Tandja on their behalf. It was also reported that President Bouteflika of Algeria had been in offering security guarantees to Niger. [...] At the same time, the government of Niger renewed Uranium contracts with the French government controlled Areva, obtaining a 50% increase in payments to the Nigerien state. This <b>comes</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> when security concerns have made the diminishing mines at Arlit impossible to operate, and construction of their new mine near Ingal – scheduled to be complete in 2010 yet still not begun – extremely unlikely.|$|E

60|$|In our {{own time}} Scandinavian tradition, because of the {{imagination}} of Richard Wagner and of William Morris and of the earlier and, as I think, greater Heinrich Ibsen, {{has created a new}} romance, and through the imagination of Richard Wagner, become all but the most passionate element in the arts of the modern world. There is indeed but one other element as passionate, the still unfaded legends of Arthur and of the Holy Grail; and now a new fountain of legends, and, as I think, a more abundant fountain than any in Europe, is being opened, the great fountain of Gaelic legends; the tale of Deirdre, who alone among the women who have set men mad was at once the white flame and the red flame, wisdom and loveliness; the tale of the Sons of Tuireann, with its unintelligible mysteries, an old Grail Quest as I think; the tale of the four children changed into four swans, and lamenting over many waters; the tale of the love of Cuchulain for an immortal goddess, and his coming home to a mortal woman in the end; the tale of his many battles at the ford with that dear friend he kissed before the battles, and over whose dead body he wept when he had killed him; the tale of his death and of the lamentations of Emer; the tale of the flight of Grainne with Diarmuid, strangest of all tales of the fickleness of woman, and the tale of the coming of Oisin out of faeryland, and of his memories and lamentations. 'The Celtic movement,' as I understand it, is principally the opening of this fountain, and none can measure of how great importance it may be to coming times, for every new fountain of legends is a new intoxication for the imagination of the world. It <b>comes</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> when the imagination of the world is as ready, as it was at the coming of the tales of Arthur and of the Grail, for a new intoxication. The reaction against the rationalism of the eighteenth century has mingled with a reaction against the materialism of the nineteenth century, and the symbolical movement, which has come to perfection in Germany in Wagner, in England in the Pre-Raphaelites, and in France in Villiers De l'Isle Adam, and Mallarmé, and Maeterlinck, and has stirred the imagination of Ibsen and D'Annunzio, is certainly the only movement that is saying new things. The arts by brooding upon their own intensity have become religious, and are seeking, as I think Verhaeren has said, to create a sacred book. They must, as religious thought has always done, utter themselves through legends; and the Sclavonic and Finnish legends tell of strange woods and seas, and the Scandinavian legends are held by a great master, and tell also of strange woods and seas, and the Welsh legends are held by almost as many great masters as the Greek legends, while the Irish legends move among known woods and seas, and have so much of a new beauty, that they may well give the opening century its most memorable symbols.|$|E
