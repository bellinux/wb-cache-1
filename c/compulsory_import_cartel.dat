40|$|This paper {{reviews the}} {{restructuring}} of the Asia-Pacific iron ore market {{in the wake of}} the rise of the Chinese steel industry. Prior to the 2000 s, this market was characterised by two key features-high firm-level concentration on both the producer and consumer sides, and price determination through annually negotiated benchmark pricing between Australian mining and Japanese steel firms. However, owing to rapid growth in the Chinese steel industry and its emergence as the region's principal iron ore consumer, the Asia-Pacific iron ore market has been dramatically restructured during the last decade. This process has been accelerated since 2005 by Chinese governmental resource security policies, which have sought to address current record high iron ore prices through the use of foreign investment to sponsor new market entrants and the formation of an <b>import</b> <b>cartel</b> amongst the Chinese steel firms. This paper evaluates how these policies have driven restructuring in the Asia-Pacific iron ore market, through an analysis of the growth of China's steel industry, Chinese resource security policies aimed at lowering iron ore import costs, and their effects upon the regional market's ownership structure and price determination mechanisms. It argues that while Chinese investment and cartelisation policies have catalysed significant changes to the ownership and pricing structures of the Asia-Pacific iron ore market, they have carried only mixed benefits for the Chinese steel industry's resource security...|$|R

40|$|This report {{examines}} {{the possibility of}} giving preferential treatment to imports of meat products that meet improved standards in terms of animal welfare in production. Three specific forms of preferential treatment are considered here as possible measures for increasing levels of animal welfare in meat production in the EU and its exporting partners: labelling of products (either voluntary or <b>compulsory),</b> differentiated <b>import</b> tariffs and differentiated consumer taxes. The likely admissibility of such measures under WTO rules is assessed {{by means of an}} analysis of previous decisions by WTO dispute settlement panels. It is concluded that all of the measures analysed have a possibility of being upheld, based on a defence relying on Article XX of the GATT and perhaps also the TBT Agreement. While the incentives offered by labelling could be reinforced with differentiated tariffs or taxes, these financial instruments involve various additional complications. They could best be considered after the possibilities of regulated labelling schemes have been exhausted. International Relations/Trade,...|$|R
25|$|In March 2001, 40 multi-national {{pharmaceutical}} companies brought litigation against South Africa for its Medicines Act, which allowed the generic production of antiretroviral drugs (ARVs) for treating HIV, {{despite the fact}} that these drugs were on-patent. HIV was and is an epidemic in South Africa, and ARVs at the time cost between 10,000 and 15,000 USD per patient per year. This was unaffordable for most South African citizens, and so the South African government committed to providing ARVs at prices closer to what people could afford. To do so, they would need to ignore the patents on drugs and produce generics within the country (using a <b>compulsory</b> license), or <b>import</b> them from abroad. After international protest in favour of public health rights (including the collection of 250,000 signatures by MSF), the governments of several developed countries (including The Netherlands, Germany, France, and later the US) backed the South African government, and the case was dropped in April of that year.|$|R
40|$|International audienceHarmonization of {{intellectual}} property rights among WTO members {{in the recent years}} has seen debates on access to medicines. Though flexibilities exist in the WTO Agreement to safeguard public health priorities, such as, parallel <b>imports,</b> <b>compulsory</b> licensing, yet the capacity to utilize these flexibilities depends on various factors including country's developmental status and capacity of the industry in these countries. However, in the recent past, USA has been signing regional and bilateral trade agreements with developing countries. While developing countries are lured to such agreements because of the opening up of trade and trade concessions, however, conditions of such trade especially those binding the intellectual property rights of the goods concerning USA are stricter and broader and thereby become more powerful than the WTO Agreement governing the countries. Particularly, concerns have been raised about patentability criteria, data exclusivity with potential to extend monopoly status of the newly introduced drugs and delay the entry of generic drugs, which would obviously keep the prices beyond the reach of developing countries thereby making access to drugs difficult. A few of these aspects are discussed in this paper...|$|R
40|$|The overall {{purpose of}} this thesis is to {{contribute}} to the discussion on the internationalisation of competition law. Within that context the thesis has three objectives: first, to determine the nature of the competition law problems created by commercial globalisation; secondly, to determine whether the existing mix of domestic and international rules is capable of solving those problems; and thirdly, having regard to the conclusions drawn in respect of the previous objectives, to determine the minimum rules required. Competition law is still predominantly domestic law. Business and commerce, however, is increasingly internationalised. This creates tensions that may require an international solution. International competition law issues - international anti-competitive conduct - may be divided into four categories; conduct designed to exclude <b>imports,</b> export <b>cartels,</b> international cartels and international single firm conduct. A fifth category, mergers, is not discussed in this thesis. The regulatory problems differ depending on the category of conduct concerned. This means that unless a broad-based solution is preferred, solutions will vary depending on the category of conduct. International rules, however, should only be sought if existing regulatory approaches are inadequate. If existing approaches are capable of evolving to solve the problems of international anti-competitive conduct, there is no justification for and little prospect of new international rules. To determine this it is necessary to investigate unilateral, bilateral and multilateral approaches. Unilateralism has advantages, but in a shrinking world it is deeply flawed as long as nations have different policies and legal preferences. Regulatory cooperation is evolving, but within a non-binding structure. Some of the problems associated with international anticompetitive conduct are likely to be resistant to non-binding approaches because they involve protectionism. A possibly relevant binding set of multilateral rules already exists {{in the shape of the}} agreements that make up the World Trade Organisation. These may be capable of solving some of the problems of international anti-competitive conduct. However, they will not solve all the problems. For these reasons new rules are required. There are theoretical, practical and institutional reasons why attempts to construct comprehensive rules should be avoided. Any new rules should be the minimum required. This thesis concludes with outline proposals for the minimum rules required to solve the four categories of international anti-competitive conduct...|$|R
40|$|Background The {{number of}} {{migrants}} working in Malaysia has increased sharply since the 1970 ’s {{and there is}} concern that infectious diseases endemic in other (e. g. neighbouring) countries may be inadvertently <b>imported.</b> <b>Compulsory</b> medical screening prior to entering the workforce does not include parasitic infections such as toxoplasmosis. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the seroprevalence of T. gondii infection among migrant workers in Peninsular Malaysia by means of serosurveys conducted {{on a voluntary basis}} among low-skilled and semi-skilled workers from five working sectors, namely, manufacturing, food service, agriculture and plantation, construction and domestic work. Methods A total of 484 migrant workers originating from rural locations in neighbouring countries, namely, Indonesia (n[*]=[*] 247, 51. 0 %), Nepal (n[*]=[*] 99, 20. 5 %), Bangladesh (n[*]=[*] 72, 14. 9 %), India (n[*]=[*] 52, 10. 7 %) and Myanmar (n[*]=[*] 14, 2. 9 %) were included in this study. Results The overall seroprevalence of T. gondii was 57. 4 % (n[*]=[*] 278; 95 % CI: 52. 7 – 61. 8 %) with 52. 9 % (n[*]=[*] 256; 95 % CI: 48. 4 – 57. 2 %) seropositive for anti-Toxoplasma IgG only, 0. 8 % (n[*]=[*] 4; 95 % CI: 0. 2 – 1. 7 %) seropositive for anti-Toxoplasma IgM only and 3. 7 % (n[*]=[*] 18; 95 % CI: 2. 1 – 5. 4 %) seropositive with both IgG and IgM antibodies. All positive samples with both IgG and IgM antibodies showed high avidity (> 40 %), suggesting latent infection. Age (being older than 45 years), Nepalese nationality, manufacturing occupation, and being a newcomer in Malaysia (excepting domestic work) were positively and statistically significantly associated with seroprevalence (P[*]<[*] 0. 05). Conclusions The {{results of this study suggest}} that better promotion of knowledge about parasite transmission is required for both migrant workers and permanent residents in Malaysia. Efforts should be made to encourage improved personal hygiene before consumption of food and fluids, thorough cooking of meat and better disposal of feline excreta from domestic pets...|$|R
40|$|Advanced {{industrial}} countries provide over $ 120 billion annually on various {{terms and conditions}} to support exports and investments abroad. The regime governing these official trade finance (OTF) flows has puzzling features. The legal basis of the regime, officially known as the Arrangement on Guidelines for Officially Supported Export Credits (Arrangement), is ambiguous. Its proceedings are secret. Its membership is restricted to {{a relatively small number}} of states. Finally, some sectors and modes of finance are more tightly regulated than are others. Some are not regulated at all. My research goal was not only to explain the unusual institutional features and scope of the regime as it currently stands, but also to explain why this regime emerged. I argue that the Arrangement is best understood as a cartel comprised of the leading suppliers of state- backed trade finance. Supplier states comprise the rich {{industrial countries}} that "produce" official export finance or "give" foreign aid to finance the exports of capital goods, military equipment and agricultural products sought by buyer states. Buyer states are generally developing countries, which have limited ability to pay in cash or self finance these <b>imports.</b> (cont.) The <b>cartel</b> serves the collective interest of supplier states in: 1) controlling the predatory use of export finance to shift rents from one supplier state to another; 2) controlling the unintentional transfers of wealth from supplier states to buyer states. By colluding to limit competition through jointly agreed upon rules, supplier states increase their market power vis-A-vis buyer states. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) became the forum of choice for the Arrangement because it permitted secrecy and selective membership that better aligned the interests of supplier states against buyer states. However, cartels, whether market distorting or market correcting, are imperfect arrangements. To succeed they require the control of a large market share., the presence of weak and disorganized buyers, and access to information on financing terms on a timely, ex ante basis. The body of evidence gathered for this dissertation shows this to hold true for official trade finance, explaining the variation in rule formation across sectors and across modes of financing. by Peter C.

40|$|Little {{is known}} about the {{long-term}} drug costs associated with treating AIDS in developing countries. Brazil's AIDS treatment program has been cited widely as the developing world's largest and most successful AIDS treatment program. The program guarantees free access to highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) for all people living with HIV/AIDS in need of treatment. Brazil produces non-patented generic antiretroviral drugs (ARVs), procures many patented ARVs with negotiated price reductions, and recently issued a <b>compulsory</b> license to <b>import</b> one patented ARV. In this study, we investigate the drivers of recent ARV cost trends in Brazil through analysis of drug-specific prices and expenditures between 2001 and 2005. We compared Brazil's ARV prices to those in other low- and middle-income countries. We analyzed trends in drug expenditures for HAART in Brazil from 2001 to 2005 on the basis of cost data disaggregated by each ARV purchased by the Brazilian program. We decomposed the overall changes in expenditures to compare the relative impacts of changes in drug prices and drug purchase quantities. We also estimated the excess costs attributable to the difference between prices for generics in Brazil and the lowest global prices for these drugs. Finally, we estimated the savings attributable to Brazil's reduced prices for patented drugs. Negotiated drug prices in Brazil are lowest for patented ARVs for which generic competition is emerging. In recent years, the prices for efavirenz and lopinavir-ritonavir (lopinavir/r) have been lower in Brazil than in other middle-income countries. In contrast, the price of tenofovir is US$ 200 higher per patient per year than that reported in other middle-income countries. Despite precipitous price declines for four patented ARVs, total Brazilian drug expenditures doubled, to reach US$ 414 million in 2005. We find that the major driver of cost increases was increased purchase quantities of six specific drugs: patented lopinavir/r, efavirenz, tenofovir, atazanavir, enfuvirtide, and a locally produced generic, fixed-dose combination of zidovudine and lamivudine (AZT/ 3 TC). Because prices declined for many of the patented drugs that constitute the largest share of drug costs, nearly the entire increase in overall drug expenditures between 2001 and 2005 is attributable to increases in drug quantities. Had all drug quantities been held constant from 2001 until 2005 (or for those drugs entering treatment guidelines after 2001, held constant between the year of introduction and 2005), total costs would have increased by only an estimated US$ 7 million. We estimate that in the absence of price declines for patented drugs, Brazil would have spent a cumulative total of US$ 2 billion on drugs for HAART between 2001 and 2005, implying a savings of US$ 1. 2 billion from price declines. Finally, in comparing Brazilian prices for locally produced generic ARVs to the lowest international prices meeting global pharmaceutical quality standards, we find that current prices for Brazil's locally produced generics are generally much higher than corresponding global prices, and note that these prices have risen in Brazil while declining globally. We estimate the excess costs of Brazil's locally produced generics totaled US$ 110 million from 2001 to 2005. Despite Brazil's more costly generic ARVs, the net result of ARV price changes has been a cost savings of approximately US$ 1 billion since 2001. HAART costs have nevertheless risen steeply as Brazil has scaled up treatment. These trends may foreshadow future AIDS treatment cost trends in other developing countries as more people start treatment, AIDS patients live longer and move from first-line to second and third-line treatment, AIDS treatment becomes more complex, generic competition emerges, and newer patented drugs become available. The specific application of the Brazilian model to other countries will depend, however, on the strength of their health systems, intellectual property regulations, epidemiological profiles, AIDS treatment guidelines, and differing capacities to produce drugs locally...|$|R
