Prilikom obrade aktualnih pitanja autor je imao u vidu nastalu situaciju poslije izvršenog terorističkog napada na Meðunarodni trgovački centar u SAD-u 2001. godine. Težište u članku dano je pitanjima koja se odnose na pravo osiguranja premda ni pitanja iz same oblasti osiguravajuće djelatnosti nisu mogla biti zaobiðena.

It was felt that reexamination of insurance {{terms and conditions}} was necessary in situation that ensued after the terrorist attack on the World Trade Center in USA in 2001. Findings indicate that insurers did not have unique approach when deciding how to insure this risk, how to name it and how to distinguish it from other risks named in insurance clauses against war and political risks.

It was stressed that the assured had to be protected in full for the premium paid. For him it is not important at all what motives perpetrators had when they made him suffer. Gray areas in insurance covers are leading to prolonged disputes only. This should be avoided...|$|E
