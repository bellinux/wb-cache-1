5|$|Dylan's lyrics {{incorporate}} {{a wide range}} of political, social, philosophical, and literary influences. They defied existing pop music conventions and appealed to the burgeoning counterculture. Initially inspired by the performances of Little Richard and the songwriting of Woody Guthrie, Robert Johnson, and Hank Williams, Dylan has amplified and personalized musical genres. His recording career, spanning more than 50 years, has explored the traditions in American song—from folk, blues, and country to gospel, rock and roll, and rockabilly to English, Scottish, and Irish folk music, embracing even jazz and the Great American Songbook. Dylan performs with guitar, keyboards, and harmonica. Backed by a changing lineup of musicians, he has toured steadily since the late 1980s on what has been dubbed the Never Ending Tour. His accomplishments as a recording artist and performer have been <b>central</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> career, but his songwriting is considered his greatest contribution. Since 1994, Dylan has also published seven books of drawings and paintings, and his work has been exhibited in major art galleries.|$|E
5|$|His {{marriage}} to the hot-tempered Sarah Jennings – Anne's intimate friend – ensured Marlborough's rise, first to the Captain-Generalcy of British forces, then to a dukedom. Becoming de facto leader of Allied forces during the War of the Spanish Succession, his victories on the fields of Blenheim (1704), Ramillies (1706), Oudenarde (1708), and Malplaquet (1709), ensured {{his place in history}} as one of Europe's great generals. But his wife's stormy relationship with the Queen, and her subsequent dismissal from court, was <b>central</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> own fall. Incurring Anne's disfavour, and caught between Tory and Whig factions, Marlborough, who had brought glory and success to Anne's reign, was forced from office and went into self-imposed exile. He returned to England and to influence under the House of Hanover with the accession of GeorgeI to the British throne in 1714.|$|E
5|$|Smith {{was briefly}} {{stationed}} in Britain {{before he was}} posted to No. 130 (Punjab) Squadron in western Germany in April 1945. He flew combat missions there until Germany surrendered in May. He remained with No. 130 Squadron {{for the rest of}} his service, and returned home at the end of 1945. After completing his studies at Rhodes, he was elected to the Legislative Assembly for his birthplace, Selukwe, in 1948. He became Prime Minister in 1964, during his country's dispute with Britain regarding the terms for independence; Smith was influenced as a politician by his wartime experiences, and Rhodesia's military record on behalf of Britain became <b>central</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> sense of betrayal by post-war British governments. This partly motivated his administration's Unilateral Declaration of Independence in 1965. His status as a Second World War RAF veteran helped him win support, both domestically and internationally.|$|E

5|$|At {{the same}} time that he was {{becoming}} increasingly vocal and visible in politics, Havelock's scholarly work was moving toward the concerns that would occupy him for the bulk of his career. The first questions he raised about the relationship between literacy and orality in Greece concerned the nature of the historical Socrates, which was a long-debated issue. Havelock's position, drawn from analyses of Xenophon and Aristophanes as well as Plato himself, was that Plato's presentation of his teacher was largely a fiction, and intended to be a transparent one, whose purpose was to represent indirectly Plato's own ideas. He argued vociferously against the idea associated with John Burnet, which still had currency at the time, that the basic model for the theory of forms originated with Socrates. Havelock's argument drew on evidence for a historical change in Greek philosophy; Plato, he argued, was fundamentally writing about the ideas of his present, not of the past. Most earlier work in the field had assumed that, since Plato uses Socrates as his mouthpiece, his own philosophical concerns must have been similar to those debated in the Athens of his youth, when Socrates was his teacher. Havelock's contention that Socrates and Plato belonged to different philosophical eras was the first instance of one that would become <b>central</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> work: that a basic shift in the kinds of ideas being discussed by intellectuals, and the methods of discussing them, happened at some point between the end of the fifth century BC and the middle of the fourth.|$|E
25|$|He and his {{followers}} celebrated and even venerated poverty. Poverty was so <b>central</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> character that in his last written work, the Testament, he said that absolute personal and corporate poverty was the essential lifestyle {{for the members of}} his Order.|$|E
25|$|<b>Central</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> {{publicity}} {{work was}} his creation of news for magazines and newspapers, {{as well as}} debates with opponents such as John Muir. His effectiveness in manipulating information hostile to his boss, President William Howard Taft, led to his firing in January 1910. But his successes became {{a model for other}} bureaucrats on how to influence public opinion.|$|E

50|$|Following the {{collapse}} of the Western Roman Empire, Lombardy was invaded by successive waves of tribes, the last of which was the Germanic Lombards in the late sixth century. Stability followed until 774, when the Frankish king Charlemagne conquered the area and annexed the Kingdom of the Lombards (most of northern and <b>central</b> Italy) <b>to</b> <b>his</b> empire.|$|R
25|$|Zhou {{not only}} joined the KMT, but {{actually}} {{helped organize the}} founding of the Nationalist Party European branch in November 1923. Under Zhou's influence, most of the European branch's officers were in fact communists. Zhou's wide-ranging contacts and personal relationships formed during this period were <b>central</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> career. Important party leaders, such as Zhu De and Nie Rongzhen, were first admitted to the party by Zhou.|$|E
25|$|George Segal created figural sculptures by molding {{plastered}} gauze strips over live {{models in}} his 1987 work Abraham's Farewell to Ishmael. The human condition was <b>central</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> concerns, and Segal used the Old Testament {{as a source}} for his imagery. This sculpture depicts the dilemma faced by Abraham when Sarah demanded that he expel Hagar and Ishmael. In the sculpture, the father's tenderness, Sarah's rage, and Hagar's resigned acceptance portray a range of human emotions. The sculpture was donated to the Miami Art Museum after the artist's death in 2000.|$|E
25|$|Praised by T. S. Eliot as {{the most}} {{powerful}} intellectual influence in Britain, historian Christopher Dawson is a key figure in 20th-century traditionalism. <b>Central</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> work was the idea that religion {{was at the heart of}} every culture, especially Western culture and his writings, including The Age of Gods (1928), Religion and Culture (1948) and Religion and the Rise of Western Culture (1950), reflected this view. A contributor to Eliot's Criterion, Dawson believed that after World War II, religion and culture were central to rebuilding the West in the wake of fascism and the rise of communism.|$|E
50|$|Some Islamic traditions {{view the}} name Ahmad as another given name of Muhammad at birth by his mother, {{considered}} by Muslims {{to be the}} more esoteric name of Muhammad and <b>central</b> <b>to</b> understanding <b>his</b> nature. Over the centuries, some Islamic scholars have suggested the name's parallel is in the word 'Paraclete' from the Biblical text, although this view is not universal considering translations, meanings and etymology.|$|R

25|$|While on {{research}} leave in 1980–81 at Cambridge University and Berkeley, {{the contrast between}} modernity and postmodernity became <b>central</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> work. Many of Griffin’s writings are devoted to developing postmodern proposals for overcoming the conflicts between religion and modern science. Griffin {{came to believe that}} much of the tension between religion and science was not only the result of reactionary supernaturalism but also the mechanistic worldview associated with the rise of modern science in the seventeenth century. In 1983, Griffin started the Center for a Postmodern World in Santa Barbara and became editor of the SUNY Series in Constructive Postmodern Philosophy between 1987 and 2004.|$|E
25|$|Ali Osman is {{a fictional}} {{character}} from the BBC soap opera EastEnders, played by Nejdet Salih. He {{was a member}} of the original EastEnders cast, appearing in the first episode on 19 February 1985. He remained with the show for nearly five years afterwards, making his last appearance on 10 October 1989. Ali was scripted as happy-go-lucky, which was in stark contrast to his highly strung wife, Sue (Sandy Ratcliff). <b>Central</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> storylines were his penchant for gambling, his tempestuous marriage, and the loss of his son to cot death, which was one of the first controversial storylines covered by the soap. He was created by Julia Smith and Tony Holland, the creators of EastEnders.|$|E
25|$|The {{rest of the}} Pyramid is {{interpreted}} by Alford as a network of secret chambers in which religious relics were concealed– hence {{the title of his}} book Pyramid of Secrets. This is the weakest part of his case, as the textual support for the idea is thin {{and there is no way}} of knowing what might have been contained in the chambers that we know of today. Once again, Alford’s theory can be proven or negated by future exploration, since it is <b>central</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> case that further secret chambers exist. In this regard, his thoughts are guided by the scholar J.P. Lepre, who claimed that anomalous patterns in the Pyramid’s masonry joints might be signs to the existence of hidden passages and chambers.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{my project}} is to refocus on Garry Winogrand's airport {{pictures}} as a significant facet, both theoretically and corporeally, of the photographer's archive. I will argue that Winogrand's airport pictures are <b>central</b> <b>to</b> understanding <b>his</b> overall body of work. These images focus on bodies in space, not merely bodies in the street, and allow us to reassess Winogrand's work {{in terms of a}} monumental paradigm shift in popular culture in 1960 s America...|$|R

25|$|Kean’s {{inclusive}} {{practice of}} government remains <b>central</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> legacy. This legacy found expression in his urban policies and outreach to traditional Democratic constituencies, his aggressive divestment of public retirement funds from South Africa, embrace of Martin Luther King, Jr. Day {{as an opportunity}} to raise awareness of race on a statewide basis, and his successful primary sponsorship of the bill that established the Educational Opportunity Fund. This fund appropriated $2 million for direct student aid and support programs for low-income students who demonstrated academic capability but lack sufficient preparation for college. It continues to serve disadvantaged New Jersey students nearly 50 years later. The fund’s longevity is indicative of Kean’s long-term outlook and the overall strength of his legislation.|$|E
25|$|During {{the late}} 1950s and early 1960s Frank Stella was a {{significant}} figure {{in the emergence of}} Minimalism, Post-Painterly Abstraction and Color Field painting. His shaped canvases of the 1960s like Harran II, 1967, revolutionized abstract painting. One of the most important characteristics of Stella's paintings is his use of repetition. His Black Pin Stripe paintings of 1959 startled and shocked an art world that was unused to seeing monochromatic and repetitive images, painted flat, with almost no inflexion. During the early 1960s Stella made several series' of notched Aluminum Paintings and shaped Copper Paintings before making multi-colored and asymmetrical shaped canvases of the late 1960s. Frank Stella's approach and relationship to Color Field painting was not permanent or <b>central</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> creative output; as his work became more and more three-dimensional after 1980.|$|E
25|$|In Twilight, Edward meets Bella Swan, a human {{girl whose}} {{thoughts}} {{he is unable}} to read, and whose blood smells overwhelmingly sweet to him. Edward fights a growing attraction to Bella, but after saving her life on several occasions, he succumbs and eventually falls in love with her. Edward admits to Bella that he is a vampire, and that although he retains the physical body of a seventeen-year-old, he was actually born on June 20, 1901. His adoptive father, Carlisle Cullen, transformed him into a vampire in 1918 to prevent him from dying in the Spanish influenza epidemic in Chicago, Illinois by the request of Edward's mother who begged him to do whatever it took to save him. Carlisle instilled in him a sense of morality uncommon in most vampires, and <b>central</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> way of life is the refusal to consider humans as food.|$|E
50|$|Genghis Khan, {{founder of}} the Mongol Empire, invaded Transoxiana in 1219 during his conquest of Khwarezm. Before his death in 1227, he {{assigned}} the lands of Western <b>Central</b> Asia <b>to</b> <b>his</b> second son Chagatai, and this region {{became known as the}} Chagatai Khanate. In 1369, Timur, of the Barlas tribe, became the effective ruler and made Samarkand the capital of his future empire. Transoxiana was known to be flourishing in the mid-14th century.|$|R

25|$|Luke's {{understanding}} of Jesus – his Christology – is <b>central</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> theology. One {{approach to this}} is through the titles Luke gives to Jesus: these include, {{but are not limited}} to, Christ (Messiah), Lord, Son of God, and Son of Man. Another is by reading Luke in the context of similar Greco-Roman divine saviour figures (Roman emperors are an example), references which would have made clear to Luke's readers that Jesus was the greatest of all saviours. A third is to approach Luke through his use of the Old Testament, those passages from Jewish scripture which he cites to establish that Jesus is the promised Messiah. While much of this is familiar, much also is missing: for example, Luke makes no clear reference to Christ's pre-existence or to the Christian's union with Christ, and makes relatively little reference to the concept of atonement: perhaps he felt no need to mention these ideas, or disagreed with them, or possibly he was simply unaware of them.|$|E
25|$|The {{next step}} was taken by Eudoxus of Cnidus, who formalized a new theory of {{proportion}} that took into account commensurable as well as incommensurable quantities. <b>Central</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> idea was the distinction between magnitude and number. A magnitude “...was not a number but stood for entities such as line segments, angles, areas, volumes, and time which could vary, as we would say, continuously. Magnitudes were opposed to numbers, which jumped from one value to another, as from 4 to 5.” Numbers are composed of some smallest, indivisible unit, whereas magnitudes are infinitely reducible. Because no quantitative values were assigned to magnitudes, Eudoxus was then able to account for both commensurable and incommensurable ratios by defining a ratio {{in terms of its}} magnitude, and proportion as an equality between two ratios. By taking quantitative values (numbers) out of the equation, he avoided the trap of having to express an irrational number as a number. “Eudoxus’ theory enabled the Greek mathematicians to make tremendous progress in geometry by supplying the necessary logical foundation for incommensurable ratios.” This incommensurability is dealt with in Euclid's Elements, Book X, Proposition 9.|$|E
25|$|Shevardnadze's {{rapid rise}} in Soviet Georgia's {{political}} hierarchy {{was the result}} of his campaign against corruption. Throughout most of Shevardnadze's leadership, anti-corruption campaigns were <b>central</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> authority and policy. By the time Shevardnadze had become leader, Georgia was the Soviet republic most afflicted by corruption. The rule of Vasil Mzhavanadze had been characterised by weak leadership, nepotism, despotism, and bribery pervading the upper echelons of power. In Georgia, corruption had been allowed to thrive, leading to serious deformations in the system; for example only 68 per cent of Georgian goods were exported legally, while the percentage of goods exported legally from other Soviet Republics approached 100 per cent. Shevardnadze rallied support for his anti-corruption campaigns by establishing the Study of Public Opinion. To combat corruption, he engaged in subterfuge; after halting all exports he dressed himself as a peasant and drove a car filled with tomatoes through the border. After his personal subterfuge, the entire Georgian border police was purged. While never proven, it is said that after taking office, Shevardnadze asked all leading officials to show their left hands and ordered those who used Western-produced watches to replace them with Soviet ones. This story portrayed Shevardnadze as an active battler against corruption. His campaign against corruption was largely unsuccessful and when he returned to Georgia in 1992, corruption was still a huge problem.|$|E
