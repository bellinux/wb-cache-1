The new reform {{became one of the}} most intensively evaluated policies in Europe. The contributors and assessors are policy makers and researchers from different range of disciplines. EU <b>Cohesion</b> <b>Policy</b> refers to the set of activities aimed to reduction of regional and social disparities in the European Union. Although, the EU <b>Cohesion</b> <b>Policy</b> appears as a relatively well designated programme, there are still some unresolved issues in terms of measurements, philosophical approaches and methods of <b>Cohesion</b> <b>Policy</b> evaluation.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{we address}} the issue of {{resistance}} as the attempt of local political discourses to maintain their autonomy within larger discourses. We are interested in how local discourses can maintain a partial segregation in respect to specific issue fields. What we are interested in is how discourse changes by shifting from lower to higher levels of locality. We do so by analysing discourses in the context of European <b>cohesion</b> <b>policies.</b> <b>Cohesion</b> <b>policies</b> utilize more than one third of the budget of the European Union to facilitate the converge of economic development of European regions. Overall, this research setting allows to investigating how discourse on <b>cohesion</b> <b>policies</b> modifies as it shifts from national to regional media. We investigate how at regional level the discourse is innervated by idiosyncratic topics that reflect contextual framing and interest structures. Empirically, our work addresses a key concern: how it is possible that awareness of such an important financial effort by EU is so low especially in the regions that benefit the most from the programme...|$|R

While {{the conditions for}} eligibility are the same, at regional level CEE territories are provided with very different socioeconomic settings. In particular, different regions are differently endowed with what has been labelled ‘territorial capital’, so that the endowment of public and private, material and immaterial assets significantly varies across regions, including infrastructure, private capital, human and social capital. This set of territorial conditions, enabling economic development to take place, is here assumed to impact the outcome of <b>cohesion</b> <b>policies</b> as well. This paper is hence aimed at assessing the role of specific territorial conditions on the efficient implementation of <b>cohesion</b> <b>policies</b> in CEE NUTS 3 regions. The analysis points out the mechanisms through which the endowment of specific territorial assets affects the outcome of <b>Cohesion</b> <b>policies.</b> It appears that for {{a large number of}} territorial capital assets, increasing returns are present and regions more endowed with specific types of territorial capital are more able to gain from policy investment in related fields...|$|R

The results highlight that not always the <b>Cohesion</b> <b>policies</b> and the CAP measures have convergent objectives under the profile of the cohesion.

40|$|This paper aims {{to provide}} a {{contribution}} to the debate on the effectiveness of <b>cohesion</b> <b>policies</b> in Italy. The focus is on the territorial effects of EU spending from 1996 to 2007. The empirical analysis is based on the estimate of an expanded neoclassical growth model in which the Structural Funds are one of the variables that explain the convergence across Italian regions. Using panel data and a dynamic panel estimator we find that the Structural Funds, even having had a greater impact in the South compared to the Centre-North, have not contributed to reduce the economic divide in Italy. ...|$|R

40|$|Most {{studies of}} Europeanization tend {{to adopt a}} {{top-down}} conceptual perspective exploring {{the impact of the}} EU on Member States' policies, polities and politics. Whilst it is generally recognized that Europeanization involves reciprocal relationships between the EU and Member States, few studies seek to explore the nature of such interaction. This study sheds light on such processes by exploring the negotiation of regional policy maps under the EU's competition and <b>cohesion</b> <b>policies.</b> Approaching Europeanization from this angle shifts analytical attention towards actors, their preferences and strategies, and the bargaining opportunities through which they may attain their goals over time.
