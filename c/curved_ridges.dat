500|$|The dentary of {{the lower}} jaw {{expanded}} in height towards the front (by the mandibular symphysis), where it was also flattened, {{and it had a}} downwards projection at the tip (which has been referred to as a [...] "chin"). The lower side of the dentary was concave, the outer side was convex in upper view, and a groove ran along it, which supported foramina that nourished the teeth. The inner side of the dentary had a row of interdental plates, where each tooth had a foramen. The Meckelian groove ran along the lower border. The curvature of the dentary shows that the mouth of Giganotosaurus would have been wide. It is possible that each dentary had twelve alveoli (tooth sockets). Most of the alveoli were about 3.5cm (1.3in) long from front to back. The teeth of the dentary were of similar shape and size, except for the first one, which was smaller. The teeth were compressed sideways, were oval in cross-section, and had serrations at the front and back borders, which is typical of theropods. The teeth were sigmoid-shaped when seen in front and back view. One tooth had nine to twelve serrations per millimetre (0.039in). The side teeth of Giganotosaurus had <b>curved</b> <b>ridges</b> of enamel, and the largest teeth in the premaxilla (front of the upper jaw) had pronounced wrinkles (with their highest relief near the serrations).|$|E
60|$|Shefford was {{the first}} to ride up out of the draw, and once upon the top of the ridge he halted to gaze, wide-eyed and entranced. A rolling, endless plain sloped down beneath him, and led him on to a distant round-topped mountain. To the right a red cañon opened its jagged jaws, and away to the north rose a whorled and strange sea of <b>curved</b> <b>ridges,</b> crags, and domes.|$|E

50|$|The {{inferior}} border {{corresponds to}} the line of junction of the base of the trochanter with the lateral surface of the body; it is marked by a rough, prominent, slightly <b>curved</b> <b>ridge,</b> which gives origin to {{the upper part of the}} vastus lateralis.|$|R
50|$|The rim of Descartes survives only in stretches, and is {{completely}} {{missing in the}} north. The crater Descartes A lies across the southwest rim. The interior floor contains several <b>curved</b> <b>ridges.</b> These are concentric with the surviving outer walls to the northwest and southeast.|$|E
50|$|Eskers can be {{describes}} as long, <b>curved</b> <b>ridges</b> {{made up of}} sands and gravels. These surfaces were created by intraglacial streams carrying and depositing sediments as they flow through the glacier. These landforms can range from 100 m to 500 km long and 3 m to 200 m tall.|$|E
50|$|Basin and Dome Terrain, {{also known}} as {{honeycomb}} terrain, consists of <b>curved</b> <b>ridges</b> and troughs that form a pattern analogous to an egg carton. These structures represent multiple phases of deformation, and are considered the most complex appearing style of tessera. Basin and dome terrain is typically found within the center of crustal plateaus.|$|E
50|$|The {{interior}} {{floor is}} relatively level, and is pock-marked by multiple tiny craterlets. There is a <b>curving</b> <b>ridge</b> {{in the southern}} part of the floor that is attached to the inner wall, and possibly forms the remnant of a small crater rim.|$|R
50|$|Lava Flow Terrain {{is named}} such {{due to its}} {{resemblance}} to Pahoehoe flows found on Earth, with long <b>curving</b> <b>ridges.</b> It is thought that this terrain may be formed due to displacement and deformation due to movement of the material beneath these crustal pieces.|$|R
50|$|The Glen Coe Skyline route {{takes in}} the {{technical}} <b>Curved</b> <b>Ridge</b> on Buachaille Etive Mòr, then heads west over Stob Coire Sgreamhach before an out-and-back section to Stob Coire nan Lochan. It then drops down to the valley near Loch Achtriochtan before climbing steeply up to the Aonach Eagach, a rocky ridge which is traversed from west to east before the route joins the West Highland Way to the finish. In 2015, the Skyline started and finished at Glencoe Mountain Resort but for the following year, the start and finish was moved to Kinlochleven and the runners reached <b>Curved</b> <b>Ridge</b> via the West Highland Way and a descent of the Devil’s Staircase. The race is around 55 km in length with 4750 m of ascent.|$|R
50|$|Lineated floor {{deposits}} {{began as}} lobate debris aprons (LDAs), which form as material leaves narrow mountain valleys and spreads {{out as an}} apron. By tracing the paths of the ridges on LDAs, researchers {{have come to believe}} that the <b>curved</b> <b>ridges</b> characteristic of lobate debris aprons straighten out to form the more or less straight ridges of LVF.|$|E
50|$|This {{formation}} {{has been}} heavily damaged and reshaped {{until it is}} scarcely recognizable as a crater. Sections of the low eastern rim and a portion to the northwest are still somewhat intact, although they more closely resemble <b>curved</b> <b>ridges</b> than a crater wall. There are gaps in the rim {{to the south and}} north, and the interior is irregular with portions having been resurfaced.|$|E
5000|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that lineated floor deposits began as LDAs. By tracing the paths of the <b>curved</b> <b>ridges</b> characteristic of LDAs, researchers {{have come to believe that}} they straighten out to form the ridges of LVF. [...] Both lineated floor deposits and lobate debris aprons often display a strange surface formation called brain terrain because it looks like the surface of the human brain.|$|E
40|$|<b>Ridge</b> <b>curves</b> are {{important}} features in human vision (see Koenderink, 1990, p. 295). In this paper we apply a simple algebraic criterion of Porteous (1994) {{to the problem}} of finding <b>ridge</b> <b>curves</b> in machine vision. This work provides a simpler approach than other existing methods (see for example, Thirion and Gourdon, 1992, and Hosaka, 1992). To identify <b>ridge</b> <b>curves</b> in practice on surface data it is necessary first to smooth the data, which we do using thin-plate splines and related kriging procedures. After validating our methodology, we illustrate its use on a set of laser range data of the human head. 1 Introduction Intuitively <b>ridge</b> <b>curves</b> on a surface occur at points where the curvature is changing most rapidly. There is some evidence that the human eye picks out <b>ridge</b> <b>curves</b> when looking at a surface. For example, for the human face the <b>ridge</b> <b>curves</b> seem to correspond to prominent anatomical features. It is claimed that <b>ridge</b> <b>curves</b> "usually appear, along with edges of [...] ...|$|R
50|$|It can {{be found}} near Bishop Sutton in the Chew Valley, just off the A368. The site is {{situated}} on a <b>curved</b> <b>ridge</b> of land on neutral soils derived from the underlying Keuper Marl. The soil is of the Icknield Association with dark brown, moist but moderately well-drained clay.|$|R
50|$|The rim {{reaches its}} maximum {{altitude}} {{along the western}} face, where it merges with ridges {{along the edge of}} the mare. To the northeast the rim dips down very close to the surface, and barely forms a <b>curving</b> <b>ridge</b> in the surface. The southeastern rim is overlaid by a pair of craters.|$|R
50|$|This crater has a {{worn and}} damaged outer rim along its eastern half, but the rim {{is all but}} nonexistent on the western face, being {{little more than a}} pair of <b>curved</b> <b>ridges</b> beneath the surface. Lava flows have overflowed this western rim and {{submerged}} the interior, leaving a relatively level and featureless interior. A small craterlet marks {{the southern end of the}} interior floor, and several tiny craters mark the surviving rim.|$|E
50|$|This crater is {{elongated}} to the south-southeast, {{with a very}} eroded outer rim. The {{southern part}} of the rim is nearly nonexistent, and there is a narrow cleft at the northern end of the crater. Portions of the rim still remain along the western and northeastern sides, but appear as little more than <b>curved</b> <b>ridges.</b> The interior has little detail of interest apart from a tiny craterlet along the southwest inner wall.|$|E
50|$|Eurypteridae, which lived {{during the}} Silurian period, were {{characterized}} by small to large exoskeletons with inconspicuous semilunar scales or <b>curved</b> <b>ridges.</b> The telson (tail) was styliform or pointed. Eurypteridae also had chelicerae (appendages {{in front of the}} mouth) that were small. Their walking legs were covered in spines. The prosoma (head) was subrectangular, with slightly curved compound eyes located relatively centrally on the dorsal surface. Genital appendages in the female were very short with lateral lobes; but long in the male with diverging distal spines.|$|E
5000|$|The {{first two}} huts {{are in fact}} {{one and the same}} {{building}} (presumably a hay store), of a rectangular ground plan with rounded corners; a smaller, circular hut abuts its far end; as all three roofs are connected by a <b>curving</b> <b>ridge,</b> one gets the impression of a single structure with threefold roofing.|$|R
25|$|The {{summit of}} Sallows {{is covered in}} grass and heather, the highest point {{occupied}} by a <b>curving</b> <b>ridge</b> of shale about thirty feet long. This in turn carries a small cairn. There is a good view westwards to the Scafell and Coniston Old Man groups, with distant sightings from Black Combe to the Pennines.|$|R
5000|$|Jensen <b>Ridge</b> (...) is a <b>curving</b> <b>ridge</b> running eastward from Foca Point toward Jane Col on Signy Island in the South Orkney Islands. It {{was named}} in 1991 by the UK Antarctic Place-Names Committee after Captain Gullik Jensen, of the whaling ship Strombus from Tønsberg, Norway, {{who made the}} last whaling {{expedition}} to Signy Island in 1935-36.|$|R
