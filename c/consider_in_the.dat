25|$|Another factor {{important}} to <b>consider</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{understanding of the}} fishery's collapse is the uncertainty inherent {{in the assessment of}} the cod as a resource. Management of a resource is an extremely complex task, with a multitude of interests, perspectives, and sources of information to take into account; when knowledge regarding the resource is limited, or clouded by imprecision, the task of managing it becomes even more difficult. The management of fisheries are associated with an especially high degree of uncertainty due to problems inherent {{in the nature of the}} resource. Newfoundland's cod fisheries were no exception: an imperfect understanding of the ocean ecosystem; technical and environmental challenges associated with observation techniques, which led to incomplete data on the resource (the cod); and the naturally high levels of variability in the population due to dynamic environmental factors (such as ocean temperature) combined to make the discernment of the effects of exploitation an arduous task. Unfortunately, this led to predictions about the condition and future of the cod stock that were mired in uncertainty, making it more difficult for the government to choose the appropriate course of action.|$|E

2500|$|The {{question}} {{has often been}} raised whether the motive power of heat is unbounded, whether the possible improvements in steam engines have an assignable limit—a limit by which {{the nature of things}} will not allow to be passed by any means whatever… In order to <b>consider</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> most general way the principle of the production of motion by heat, it must be considered independently of any mechanism or any particular agent. It is necessary to establish principles applicable not only to steam-engines but to all imaginable heat-engines… The production of motion in steam-engines is always accompanied by a circumstance on which we should fix our attention. [...] This circumstance is the re-establishing of equilibrium… Imagine two bodies A and B, kept each at a constant temperature, that of A being higher than that of B. These two bodies, to which we can give or from which we can remove the heat without causing their temperatures to vary, exercise the functions of two unlimited reservoirs...|$|E

60|$|As for Castel Bolognese itself, Cesare Borgia sent a {{thousand}} demolishers {{in the following}} July to raze it to the ground.

Its commanding position rendered it almost in the nature of a gateway controlling, as we know, the road from Faenza to Imola, and its occupation by the Bolognese or other enemies in time of disturbance might be of serious consequence to Cesare.
