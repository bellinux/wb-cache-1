[...] Casks newly delivered to many small pubs were often nearly unmanageably frothy, but cellar space and rapid turnover demanded that they be put into use before they could sit for long enough to settle down. [...] As a result, a glass would be part filled with the fresh, frothy beer, allowed to stand a minute, and then topped up with beer from a cask that had been pouring longer and had calmed down a bit.

Most of the customers feel the {{internet banking}} is an efficient system for handling their bank activities quickly and also reducing their transaction times. The internet banking system is continuously reaching in the state banking customer like Hatton National bank in (Mannar,vavuniya and puttalam branches) also.

Therefore this research work is studied about the <b>Customer</b> <b>Acceptances</b> of Using Internet banking(special reference to Hatton National bank of (mannar,vavuniya and puttalam branches)). The idea was further refined and a general question was formulated to understand the phenomenon, which dimensions associated to find the internet banking usage. There are twenty-one question were formulated to identifies the customer satisfaction regarding the internet usage. Here 40 customers are taken as a sample from the internet banking customer from the Hatton National bank in (mannar,vavuniya and puttalam branches). Primary and secondary data were used in this study, primary data were collected from the questionnaires, and interviews, secondary data were collected from bank annual reports, Bank records and administrative reports. The collected data were analyzed using the frequency method. The collected data were presented in the form of tables and pie charts.

In this work, covalent immobilization of recombinant POXA 1 b laccase from Pleurotus ostreatus on epoxy activated poly(methacrylate) beads was optimized thanks to a Response Surface Methodologies approach. Through regression analysis the process was well fitted by a quadratic polynomial equation (R(2) = 0. 9367, adjusted R(2) = 0. 8226) under which laccase activity reached 2000 ± 100 Ug(- 1) of beads, with an immobilization efficiency of 98 %. The immobilized biocatalyst was characterized and then tested in fruit juice clarification reaching up to 45 % phenol reduction, without affecting health-effective flavanones content.

40|$|Remanufacturing {{is one of}} the {{recovery}} processes that transforms a used product into a “like-new” product, and usually comes with similar warranty to the new product. Many manufacturers have concerns that remanufacturing might cannibalize the sales of the new product. Recent development shows an increasing trend in selling products through non-traditional channels such as manufacturer’s direct channel or e-channel. We develop a pricing decision model for short life-cycle product in a closed-loop supply chain that consists of manufacturer, retailer, and collector. New product is sold via traditional retail store and remanufactured product is sold via manufacturer’s direct channel, such as factory outlet. We introduce two scaling factors; the first represents <b>customer’s</b> <b>acceptance</b> towards buying remanufactured product, and the second represents customer’s preference to buy remanufactured product via direct channel. The results show that implementing separate channel can improve the total supply chain’s profit compared to single-channel approach.

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the performance of}} workload rules used to support <b>customer</b> order <b>acceptance</b> decisions in the hierarchical production control structure of a batch chemical plant. <b>Customer</b> order <b>acceptance</b> decisions {{need to be made}} at a point in time when no detailed information is available about the actual shop floor status during execution of the order. These decisions need therefore be based on aggregate models of the shop floor, which predict the feasibility of completing the customer order in time. In practice, workload rules are commonly used to estimate the availability of sufficient capacity to complete a set of orders in a given planning period. Actual observations in a batch chemical manufacturing plant show that the set of orders accepted needs to be reconsidered later, because the schedule turns out to be infeasible. Analysis of the planning processes used at the plant shows that workload rules can yields reliable results, however at the expense of a rather low capacity utilization. In practice this is often unacceptable. Since, solving a detailed scheduling problem is not feasible at this stage, this creates a dilemma that only can be solved if we can find more detailed aggregate models than workload rules can provide...|$|R

In particular, the idea of e-commerce has enabled customers to perform their transactions in a faster and cheaper way than conventional markets, and it has allowed companies to increase their sales volume thanks to a world-wide visibility. However, {{one of the problems that}} can strongly affect the performance of any e-commerce portal is related to the quality and validity of ratings provided by customers in their past transactions. Indeed, these reviews are used to determine the extent of <b>customers</b> <b>acceptance</b> and satisfaction of a product or service and they can affect the future selling performance and market share of a company. As a consequence, an efficient analysis of customer feedback could allow e-commerce portals to improve their selling capabilities and revenue. This paper introduces an innovative computational intelligence framework for efficiently learning review ratings in e-commerce by addressing different issues involved in this significant task: the dimension and imprecision of ratings data. In particular, we integrate the techniques of Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), Fuzzy C-Means (FCM) and ANFIS and, as shown in experimental results, this synergetic approach yields better learning performance than other rating predictors based on a conventional artificial neural network and FCM algorithm. © 2014 IEEE...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine the factors that {{affecting}} Malaysian bank <b>customers</b> <b>acceptance</b> of banking channels namely branch banking, ATM banking, telephone banking and Internet banking. Considering this objective in mind, the current study tends to develop a model, a theoretical framework that explains the factors affecting banking channels adoption from a Malaysian point of view.

Results suggest that convenience factors are the most influential drivers in branch channel adoption, assurance factors are the most influential drivers in ATM adoption, informativeness factors are the most influential drivers in telephone banking adoption while assurance factors are the essential factors in impacting Internet banking adoption. This study indeed suffers from two main limitations that lead for a potential future research in this field of knowledge. Worth to mention, the first limitation is on its limited number of measures applied in this study. The second limitation is based on the fact that it ignored mobile banking as a banking channel.
