5|$|Tailback Cedric Humes {{was named}} the most {{valuable}} player of the game for Virginia Tech, and quarterback Hunter Cantwell {{was named the}} Cardinals' most valuable player. Tech punter Nic Schmitt set Gator Bowl records for punt yardage and average punt distance, kicking the ball six times for 300yards, an average of 50yards per kick. Virginia Tech's win was marred by excessive penalties and unsportsmanlike conduct that resulted in the ejection of oneplayer. Following the game, Virginia Tech quarterback Marcus Vick was released from the team as a result of several incidents of misconduct, including a stomp on Louisville defender Elvis Dumervil's leg during the game. Several players who participated in the game, including Dumervil, later went on to <b>careers</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> National Football League.|$|E

5|$|The Juventus youth set-up {{has been}} {{recognised}} {{as one of}} the best in Italy for producing young talents. While not all graduates made it to the first team, many have enjoyed successful <b>careers</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Italian top flight. Under long-time coach Vincenzo Chiarenza, the Primavera (Under-20) squad enjoyed one of its successful periods, winning all age-group competitions from 2004 to 2006. Like Dutch club Ajax and many Premier League clubs, Juventus operates several satellite clubs and football schools outside of the country (i.e. United States, Canada, Greece, Saudi Arabia, Australia and Switzerland) and numerous camps in the local region to expand talent scouting.|$|E
5|$|The National Hockey League (NHL) {{is a major}} {{professional}} {{ice hockey}} league which operates in Canada and the United States. Since its inception in 1917–18, 52 players born within the current borders of the United Kingdom have taken part. None of them, however, were trained within the country. Of these players, 23 are from England, 21 from Scotland, 5 from Northern Ireland and 3 from Wales. Steve Thomas and Owen Nolan played over 1,000 regular season games, while Thomas and Steve Smith {{are the only ones}} to have appeared in over 100 playoff games. All three players finished their <b>careers</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 21st century. The only British born player currently playing in the NHL is Brendan Perlini of the Arizona Coyotes.|$|E
5|$|The exarchs of Africa were {{effectively}} Governor-Generals {{with both}} {{civilian and military}} powers. Their seat of power was Carthage. Historians of the late 19th and early 20th centuries ascribed much significance to this appointment, even suggesting it would require prominent ties of Heraclius the Elder to Africa or the wider Western Roman Empire. Later historians pointed, however, that this appointment {{was part of a}} wider pattern. In the 6th century, several prominent Byzantine military commanders had started their <b>careers</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> eastern regions of the Empire, often in the vicinity of Upper Mesopotamia. Then they were transferred to North Africa {{at some point in their}} respective careers. There is therefore no indication that this rotation from the eastern to the western provinces was unusual.|$|E
