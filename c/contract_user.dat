The allocated bit rate obeys to a user-centric approach by introducing a non-satisfaction user probability {{that has to be}} maintained below its targeted value while still keeping the best exploitation of the maximum available bandwidth. To this purpose different classes of <b>users</b> with different <b>Contracted</b> <b>User</b> Profiles are introduced and a Hopfield Neural Network optimization methodology is used under both user and network restrictions. Significant and promising results are finally shown for a single isolated cell DS-CDMA scenario including realistic propagation and mobility models...|$|R
40|$|In {{response}} to low commodity prices and increasing production cost, agricultural producers {{have attempted to}} capture a portion of downstream market value of their products by organizing and investing in what are now called "New Generation Co-ops". These cooperative efforts often involve the construction of processing facilities (soybean crushing, corn processing, wheat milling) requiring an extensive capital commitment and a substantial financial risk for their members. An alternative strategy to the brick and mortar cooperatives are producer affiliations that involve the negotiation of contractual agreements with product users, providing protocols for maintaining quality standards, and collecting and sharing information. AgGuild of Illinois {{is an example of}} such a producer cooperative arrangement. The AgGuild, an alliance of some fifty central Illinois grain producers, attempts to capture a premium over the general commodity grain price by producing crops in viable quantities that meet the quality and attribute specifications desired by <b>contracting</b> <b>users.</b> To this point, the AgGuild has focused its efforts on producing non-genetically modified soybeans that have higher yields of isoflavones (a naturally occurring chemical compound in plants that are considered to provide a number of health benefits for consumers).

For this purpose, UsER provides several modules, which cover different aspects and methods {{of the development of}} human-machine interfaces. UsER supports the contextualized development of user interfaces in a broad range of application areas like office systems as well as safety-critical control systems by providing general as well as domain specific analysis, design and evaluation modules. These modules may be applied as needed and their contents will be cross-referenced through linked entities and hypermedia relationships.

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} a contract-driven resource management process and supporting middleware framework. We aim at supporting mobile computing tasks {{as they appear}} {{in the areas of}} Ambient Intelligence (AmI). As available resources in AmI environments fluctuate frequently, the resource usage of AmI tasks must be extremely flexible. The presented component based methodology permits an optimal flexibility in resource distribution and allocation through the use of resource <b>contracts.</b> <b>User</b> tasks specify their QoS needs in parameterized contract propositions that are used as the basis for a negotiation process. Once a contract has been validated and signed by the middleware, it can be monitored. The supporting decision logic is built around a Java-based expert system. Negotiation and monitoring rules detect misbehaving tasks and environmental changes. Renegotiations result in task adaptations or more drastic measures, such as partial task relocation.

40|$|This paper uses new {{research}} into the derivatives markets to develop our understanding of standard form contracts as transnational law and to show how transnational law theory may be usefully informed by empirical work. Traditionally, it has been assumed that international business communities seek to avoid the courts. However, the paper shows that the national courts play {{a prominent role in}} adjudicating disputes involving derivatives. Basing the discussion on the detail of these decisions by the English courts, the paper demonstrates that adjudication does not necessarily undermine widely used standard form contracts, and that it may even reinforce practices that underpin them. This is particularly the case where there is imperfect co-incidence between a trade association's members and a standard form <b>contract's</b> <b>users.</b> Having explored recent cases, the paper reconciles its findings with a more open and imaginative account of the role of national courts within transnational law theory...|$|R

In the wake of decreasing public expenditure on health, {{it is necessary to}} find the other factors that could take care of the health status. This article is an attempt to find the impact of economic reforms on infant mortality rate and life expectancy at birth. The study is based upon secondary data. Statistical tools like mean, ranking, and regression models are used. The study concludes that instead of treatment, the focus should be on preventive healthcare and measures should be taken to control the intensity of health problems. After analyzing the trend and pattern of public and private sector expenditure, the article finds female literacy rate, cropped land, and basic amenities to be the important variables in explaining variations in health poverty.

40|$|Commercial <b>contract</b> <b>users</b> {{read their}} <b>contract</b> {{documents}} infrequently, and understand them inadequately. The disincentives may be several: contract language {{may be too}} technical and too long; contracts may be organized around ensuring or avoiding legal liability rather than providing guidance toward performing contractual responsibilities; or contracts may rarely include frameworks that would prompt the parties to explore new opportunities. For whatever reason, the neglect by users of contractual documents can lead not only to unpleasant surprises in the performance or enforcement of particular contractual duties, but also to chronic underuse of contracts as potential instruments for planning, innovation, commercial relationship-building and optimal business results. Visualization techniques-i. e., adding graphic images to supplement written words-could invigorate the effectiveness of contract documents and processes. Greater understanding and use of contract materials could reduce transaction costs, prevent disputes, and help to achieve business goals.

A SON purchases bandwidth with certain QoS guarantees from individual network domains via bilateral service level agreement (SLA) to build a logical end-to-end service delivery infrastructure on top of existing data transport networks. Via a service <b>contract,</b> <b>users</b> directly pay the SON provider for using the valueadded services provided by the SON. In this paper we study the bandwidth provisioning problem for a service overlay network which is critical to the cost recovery in deploying and operating value-added services over the SON. We mathematically formulate the bandwidth provisioning problem, taking into account various factors such as SLA, service QoS, traffic demand distributions, and bandwidth costs. Analytical models and approximate solutions are developed for both static and dynamic bandwidth provisioning. Numerical studies are also performed to illustrate the properties of the proposed solutions and demonstrate the effect of traffic demand distributions and bandwidth costs on the bandwidth provisioning of a SON. ...|$|R

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (page 33) Tinytab is {{a general}} purpose statistical computing system designed for students and researchers without computing experience. It is flexible, powerful, easy to use, and useful for small to moderate size data sets. It is coded in UCSD Pascal and implemented on an Apple II microcomputer. Tinytab is a subset of Minitab [4, 5], a statistics package written in Fortran IV and available on medium to large size computers [6]. This project includes a series of syntax diagrams that define Minitab and by inclusion, Tinytab. Tinytab's interpreter parses input into command names and operands. The names are checked in the command dictionary and the operands are checked against those specified in coded syntax diagrams. Legal commands are executed interactively and all others generate descriptive error messages. Tinytab performs virtually all operations on linked lists and stores most data in linked lists. Since the worksheet is not stored as a linear array, {{there is no need}} to pack or repack memory as the worksheet varies dynamically in size.
