50|$|Russia leather was (and still is) {{commonly}} used for production of footwear. In Russia itself, {{it was usually}} used to make high boots (sapogi). In this craft, Russia leather was usually divided into two sorts: the more expensive yalovka (produced from <b>calf</b> <b>skin)</b> and the cheaper yuft (from all other kinds of animal skins). In Soviet times, yalovka leather was used to make army officers' field boots, and yuft leather, in combination with an artificial leather substitute called kirza, {{was used for the}} enlisted men's boots.|$|E

(Tischendorf himself thought that the parchment had been made from antelope skins, but modern microscopic examination has shown otherwise.) Most of the quires or signatures contain four sheets, save two containing five. It is estimated that the hides of about 360 animals were employed for making the folios of this codex.

The first two wives realized that it was the son. They claimed to be ill; the first wife said she needed to eat the calf's liver, and the second, that she needed the <b>calf's</b> <b>skin.</b> The official let the calf loose in the woods and bought another to kill.|$|R
50|$|The finest {{grades of}} Morocco leather are goat skin, {{but by the}} late 19th century other skins often were {{substituted}} in practice, particularly sheep <b>skin</b> and split <b>calf</b> <b>skins.</b> For example, French Morocco, is a variety made of sheepskin. The tanning process varied widely, but the traditional tanning material was sumac. The traditional tanning process was skilled and elaborate; according to the application, the preparation either would aim for a carefully smoothed finish, or would bring up the grain in various patterns such as straight-grained, pebble-grained, or in particular, in a bird's-eye pattern. Morocco leather is practically always dyed, traditionally most often red or black, but green, brown or other colors also were available, and in modern times there is no special constraint on color.|$|R

50|$|The {{manuscript}} {{consists of}} 178 pages {{of different sizes}} ranging from 20×16 centimetres to 20.5×16.8 cm. The tops of the leaves have been cut off with damage of numbering of the quires. The manuscript is written on parchment made from <b>calf</b> <b>skins.</b> Experts describe {{the quality of the}} material as low: rough manufacture of the leather, very economical open. Fifty-four pages have various defects: rough fields which have been not sewn up or have unfilled holes, the filed parts of the leaves. The Archangel Gospel is in a satisfactory condition; the parchment is not polluted, and traces of moisture are absent, but a number of sheets show traces of wormholes. It appears that some sheets had ink and cinnabar droplets fall on them, but this does not interfere with the text's legibility. As the restoration of the manuscript from the moment of its discovery was never successful, the manuscript needs a new binding of the book block and strengthening of reliure.|$|R
50|$|Hexham {{had been}} long famous for its {{manufacture}} of leather. Wright (1823) gives some statistics — 77 men & boys employed as Leather dressers and Glove-cutters, 40 boys employed as Dusters and 1,111 women employed as Sewers. Skins dressed annually were 80,000, and 18,000 skins of dressed leather were imported. From these were made and exported annually 23,504 dozens of pairs of gloves. Dutch Oker {{was used in the}} processing, but local fell clay could be used if necessary. Tanning was a necessary allied industry and there were four tanneries, employing a score of men. In a year they dealt with 5,000 hides and 12,000 <b>calf</b> <b>skins.</b> They supplied local saddlers, bootmakers and cobblers.Hexham also had 16 master hatters, and the trade employed 40 persons. There were two woollen manufactories, worked by steam power, and two rope manufactories. There were corn water mills below the bridge. A windmill on the Sele was ruinous, but there was one still working on Tyne Green. It was, and still is a flourishing market, including a mart for cattle and other farm animals.|$|R

[...] According to his chronicle, the frightening monster appeared {{during the reign of}} King Krakus (lat. Gracchus). The dragon required weekly offerings of cattle, if not, the humans would have been devoured instead. In the hope of killing the dragon, Krakus called on his two sons, Lech and Krakus II. They could not, however, defeat the creature by hand, so they came up with a trick. They fed him a <b>calf</b> <b>skin</b> stuffed with smoldering sulfur causing his fiery death. Then the brothers argued about who deserves the honor for slaying the dragon. The older brother killed the younger brother Grakch (Krakus), and told that the dragon killed him. When he became king, his secret was revealed, and he got expelled from the country. The city was named in recognition of the brave and innocent Krakus.|$|E
50|$|The Armenian {{collection}} is also composed of 2,500 Armenian illuminated manuscripts, which include such prominent examples as the Echmiadzin Gospel (989) and the Mugni Gospels (1060). Another prominent manuscript in the {{collection is}} the Homilies of Mush, written in the years 1200-1202 A.D. in the Avak Monastery in Yerzenka (modern-day Erzincan, Turkey), which measures 55.3 cm by 70.5 cm (21.8 inches by 27.8 inches), weighs 27.5 kg (60.6 lbs.), and contains 603 <b>calf</b> <b>skin</b> parchment pages. The book was found by two Armenian women in a deserted Armenian monastery in the Ottoman Empire during World War I and the Armenian Genocide period. Since it {{was found to be}} too heavy to be carried, it was split into two: one half was wrapped in a cloth and buried, while the second half was taken to Georgia. A couple of years later, a Polish officer found the first half and sold it to an officer in Baku. It was eventually brought to Armenia and the two halves were finally reunited.|$|E

The grafted skin contained epidermis, dermis, and a thin layer of fat. After 5 months the induced warts not only showed histological features of papillomavirus infections but also tested positive for viral DNA and papillomavirus capsid antigen. The formation of infectious virions was demonstrated by inoculation of new transplants with crude extract from the induced warts as well as in a cell culture focus assay. Topical application of bromovinyl- 2 ′-deoxyuridine led to a reduction in viral DNA content in the developing wart. This small-animal xenograft model should be useful for characterizing antiviral compounds and providing an understanding of the regulation of papillomavirus infections...|$|R
5000|$|A typical family tipi is a conical, {{portable}} {{structure with}} two adjustable smoke flaps, multiple poles (historically from 12 to 25 feet long) called lodge poles. Lewis H. Morgan noted that,The frame consists of thirteen poles from fifteen to eighteen feet in length, which, after being tied {{together at the}} small ends, are raised upright with a twist so as to cross the poles above the fastening. They are then drawn apart at the large ends and adjusted upon {{the ground in the}} rim of a circle usually ten feet in diameter. A number of untanned and tanned buffalo skins, stitched together in a form adjustable to the frame, are drawn around it and lashed together, as shown in the figure. The lower edges are secured to the ground with tent-pins. At the top there is an extra skin adjusted as a collar, so as to be open on the windward side to facilitate the exit of the smoke. A low opening is left for a doorway, which is covered with an extra skin used as a drop. The fire-pit and arrangements for beds are the same as in the Ojibwa lodge, grass being used in the place of spruce or hemlock twigs.Lodgepole pine is the preferred wood in the Northern and Central Plains and red cedar in the Southern Plains. [...] Tipis have a detachable cover over the structure. The cover has historically been made of buffalo hide, an optional skin or cloth lining, and a canvas or bison <b>calf</b> <b>skin</b> door. Modern lodges are more often made of canvas.|$|E

They had ten children Lawson, John, Sarah, Peter, Catherine, Mary and Elizabeth (twins), Joseph, Ann and William. There were no improvements on the place and the family camped out two weeks beside a large oak log while a cabin was being built. It was made of round logs and scotched down on the inside, a puncheon floor, clapboard roof and a mud fireplace. They lived in this house a few years when John built the brick dwelling that is now standing on the site. John was born in Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania of February 24, 1797 and died May 18, 1877 in Decatur {{at the age of}} eighty years and three months. John spelled his name [...] "Lenhard" [...] even though perhaps it was mispronounced and in some publications misspelled leading to some confusion. Clearly Mr. Lenhard maintained this spelling in his adult life. This is illustrated when at the age of 68 he ran a lost and found advertisement in the Decatur Eagle newspaper published on Friday September 1, 1865. The advertisement read: [...] "LOST. On Monday the 28th ult, between the residence of Dr. Trout and my own in Root township, a large old style <b>calf</b> <b>skin</b> pocket book, containing $55 in national currency, $5 of which was an Indiana bill, besides a small amount of postage currency.

50|$|The 9th-century poem on the Gospel history, {{to which}} its first editor, J. A. Schmeller, gave the {{appropriate}} name of Heliand (the word {{used in the}} text for Savior, answering to the Old English hǣlend and the modern German and Dutch Heiland), is, with the fragments of a poem based on the Book of Genesis, {{all that remains of}} the poetical literature of the old Saxons, i.e. the Saxons who continued in their original home. It contained when entire about 6000 lines, and portions of it are preserved in two nearly complete manuscripts and four fragments. The Cotton MS. in the British Library, written probably {{in the second half of}} the 10th century, is one of the nearly complete manuscripts, ending in the middle of the story of the journey to Emmaus. It is believed to have an organization closer to the original version because it is divided into fitts, or songs. The Munich MS., formerly at Bamberg, begins at line 85, and has many lacunae, but continues the history down to the last verse of St. Luke's Gospel, ending, however, in the middle of a sentence with the last two fitts missing. This manuscript is now retained in Munich at the Bavarian State Library. Because it was produced on <b>calf</b> <b>skin</b> of high quality, it has been preserved in good condition. Neumes above the text in this version reveal that the Heliand may have been sung. A fragment discovered at Prague in 1881 contains lines 958-1006, and another, in the Vatican Library, discovered by K. Zangemeister in 1894, contains lines 1279-1358. Two additional fragments exist that were discovered most recently. The first was discovered in 1979 at a Jesuit High School in Straubing by B. Bischoff and is currently held in Bayerische Staatsbibliothek. It consists of nearly three leaves and contains 157 poetic lines. The final fragment was found in Leipzig in 2006 by T. Doring and H. U. Schmid. This fragment consists of only one leaf that contains 47 lines of poetry, and it is currently kept at Bibliotheca Albertina.|$|E

So these calves had not only been left {{at the side of the}} road, thrown into a truck, driven all around the Waikato, they’d then been left in the yards at the slaughterhouse for probably twelve hours or more. And it was at that kind of stage that we knew we had to get footage from inside this place. If this was the kind of thing that was happening routinely we had to get inside behind closed doors where they thought people were not watching”. John Darroch, 2015.|$|R
40|$|The leather {{industry}} employs {{large amounts of}} water in unit operations of the tanning process which occurs in an aqueous medium. Identify strategies to minimize the quantity of water used in the wet stages of the leather processing is {{necessary in order to}} increase the sustainability of this compartment. In the present work, an integrated pilot scale membrane system (membrane bioreactor unit (MBR) coupled to nanofiltration (NF)) was developed for municipal wastewater reclamation. Its performance was evaluated and designed to meet the water quality criteria in view of its reuse in the tanning process. The feasibility of using reclaimed wastewater in the different wet phases of the tanning process (beamhouse, tanning, re-tanning, dyeing, fatliquoring) for manufacturing of <b>calf</b> <b>skins</b> was investigated on pilot scale. The results showed that the combination of MBR and NF treatments applied to municipal wastewaters is adequate for recovering water with low hardness, very low Fe, Mn and ammonium levels as required by tanneries. The pilot-scale tests demonstrated the technical feasibility of using the reclaimed water in the tanning process. The wet-blue leathers produced with treated water and with softened tap water did not show any considerable differences in terms of physical and sensorial properties and their quality fully satisfied the tannery specifications. The results indicate the use of treated municipal wastewater can be considered a promising solution to reduce the groundwater depletion...|$|R
40|$|There {{is a need}} in tissue-engineering for 3 D {{scaffolds}} {{that mimic}} the natural extracellular matrix of bone to enhance cell adhesion, proliferation, and differentiation. The scaffold is also required to be degradable. A highly porous scaffold has been developed to incorporate two of the extracellular components found in bone-collagen and hydroxyapatite (HA). The scaffold's collagen component is an afibrillar monomeric type I atelocollagen extracted from foetal <b>calf's</b> <b>skin.</b> This provided a novel environment {{for the inclusion of}} HA powder. Five hundred thousand primary human osteoblasts were seeded onto 4 mm cubed scaffolds that varied in ratio of HA to collagen. Weight ratios of 1 : 99, 25 : 75, 50 : 50, and 75 : 25 hydroxyapatite:collagen (HA:Collagen) were analysed. The scaffolds plus cells were cultured for 21 days. DNA assays and live/dead viability staining demonstrated that all of the scaffolds supported cell proliferation and viability. An alkaline phosphatase assay showed similar osteoblast phenotype maintenance on all of the 3 D scaffolds analysed at 21 days. MicroCT analysis demonstrated an increase in total sample volume (correlating to increase in unmineralised matrix production). An even distribution of HA throughout the collagen matrix was observed using this technique. Also at 3 weeks, reductions in the percentage of the mineralised phase of the constructs were seen. These results indicate that each of the ratios of HA/collagen scaffolds have great potential for bone tissue engineering...|$|R
