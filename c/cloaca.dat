5|$|In caecilians, {{fertilisation}} is internal, {{the male}} extruding an intromittent organ, the phallodeum, and inserting {{it into the}} female <b>cloaca.</b> The paired Müllerian glands inside the male <b>cloaca</b> secrete a fluid which resembles that produced by mammalian prostate glands and which may transport and nourish the sperm. Fertilisation probably {{takes place in the}} oviduct.|$|E
5|$|In {{the male}} frog, the two testes are {{attached}} to the kidneys and semen passes into the kidneys through fine tubes called efferent ducts. It then travels on through the ureters, which are consequently known as urinogenital ducts. There is no penis, and sperm is ejected from the <b>cloaca</b> directly onto the eggs as the female lays them. The ovaries of the female frog are beside the kidneys and the eggs pass down a pair of oviducts and through the <b>cloaca</b> to the exterior.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} of salamanders also engage in internal fertilisation. In most of these, the male deposits a spermatophore, a small packet of sperm {{on top of}} a gelatinous cone, on the substrate either on land or in the water. The female takes up the sperm packet by grasping it with the lips of the <b>cloaca</b> and pushing it into the vent. The spermatozoa move to the spermatheca in the roof of the <b>cloaca</b> where they remain until ovulation which may be many months later. Courtship rituals and methods of transfer of the spermatophore vary between species. In some, the spermatophore may be placed directly into the female <b>cloaca</b> while in others, the female may be guided to the spermatophore or restrained with an embrace called amplexus. Certain primitive salamanders in the families Sirenidae, Hynobiidae and Cryptobranchidae practice external fertilisation in a similar manner to frogs, with the female laying the eggs in water and the male releasing sperm onto the egg mass.|$|E

5|$|Although {{adapted to}} {{terrestrial}} life, frogs resemble freshwater fish in {{their inability to}} conserve body water effectively. When they are on land, much water is lost by evaporation from the skin. The excretory system {{is similar to that}} of mammals and there are two kidneys that remove nitrogenous products from the blood. Frogs produce large quantities of dilute urine in order to flush out toxic products from the kidney tubules. The nitrogen is excreted as ammonia by tadpoles and aquatic frogs but mainly as urea, a less toxic product, by most terrestrial adults. A few species of tree frog with little access to water excrete the even less toxic uric acid.

Mutation of E. <b>cloacae</b> 55 M-L to the E. <b>cloacae</b> 55 M phenotype was found to occur spontaneously at a frequency of 10 (- 8). All such revertants demonstrated an inducible wild-type phenotype after introduction of a functional ampD. These results suggested that the E. <b>cloacae</b> 55 M-L phenotype was due to a mutation in an as yet unrecognized gene, designated ampG. Verification of this gene was obtained by the restoration of the E. <b>cloacae</b> 55 M phenotype in E. <b>cloacae</b> 55 M-L by introduction of a cloned 2. 9 -kilobase BamHI fragment from the E. <b>cloacae</b> 55 chromosome. Transformation of both ampG and ampD into E. <b>cloacae</b> 55 M-L reconstituted the inducible wild-type phenotype. These results indicate that ampG is required for the activation of ampC by AmpR.

40|$|The Enterobacter <b>cloacae</b> species {{includes}} an extremely {{diverse group of}} bacteria {{that are associated with}} plants, soil and humans. Publication of the complete genome sequence of the plant growth-promoting endophytic E. <b>cloacae</b> subsp. <b>cloacae</b> ENHKU 01 provided an opportunity to perform the first comparative genome analysis between strains of this dynamic species. Examination of the pan-genome of E. <b>cloacae</b> showed that the conserved core genome retains the general physiological and survival genes of the species, while genomic factors in plasmids and variable regions determine the virulence of the human pathogenic E. <b>cloacae</b> strain; additionally, the diversity of fimbriae contributes to variation in colonization and host determination of different E. <b>cloacae</b> strains. Comparative genome analysis further illustrated that E. <b>cloacae</b> strains possess multiple mechanisms for antagonistic action against other microorganisms, which involve the production of siderophores and various antimicrobial compounds, such as bacteriocins, chitinases and antibiotic resistance proteins. The presence of Type VI secretion systems is expected to provide further fitness advantages for E. <b>cloacae</b> in microbial competition, thus allowing it to survive in different environments.

Ceftazidime-resistant E. <b>cloacae</b> NOR- 1 mutants exhibited derepressed expression of the AmpC-type cephalosporinase and of the carbapenem-hydrolyzing β-lactamase NmcA. The ampD genes of Escherichia coli and E. <b>cloacae</b> WT NOR- 1 transcomplemented the ceftazidime-resistant E. <b>cloacae</b> NOR- 1 mutants to the WT level of β-lactamase expression, while the mutated ampD alleles of E. <b>cloacae</b> NOR- 1 failed to do so. The deduced E. <b>cloacae</b> NOR- 1 WT AmpD protein exhibited 95 and 91 % amino acid identity with the E. <b>cloacae</b> O 29 and E. <b>cloacae</b> 14 WT AmpD proteins, respectively.

40|$|Enterobacter <b>cloacae</b> strain ENHK is a Gram-negative {{endophyte}} {{belonging to}} the family Enterobacteriacae. Initially considered as an unknown bacterium, E. <b>cloacae</b> ENHK was first isolated from a diseased pepper (Capsicum annuum) plant infected by the bacterial plant pathogen Ralstonia solanacearum in Hong Kong in 2010. A pure isolate was obtained for whole genome sequencing. De novo shortgun and paired-end sequencing by 454 GS Junior platform were applied to obtain a draft genome sequence of E. <b>cloacae</b> ENHK containing 36 contigs in one scaffold. Gaps were closed by PCR and primer walking using Sanger sequencing to produce the first complete genome sequence of a plant-associated strain of E. <b>cloacae.</b> The genome size of E. <b>cloacae</b> ENHK consists of a single chromosome of 4, 726, 582 kb, with a GC content of 55. 1 %. Gene annotation and analysis was performed using NCBI Prokaryotic Genomes Automatic Annotation Pipeline (PGAAP) and further annotation and comparative genome analysis was performed by the SEED-based automated annotation system provided by the RAST server. Comparative genome analysis indicated that E. <b>cloacae</b> ENHK shares major genomic features with Enterobacter sp. 638 that is characterized for its plant-growth promoting and endophytic behaviors. Further genome analysis revealed antagonistic potentials of E. <b>cloacae</b> ENHK against other microbes by possessing antagonistic mechanisms which involve microbial competition, production of antimicrobial compounds and induction of plant defense response. Candidates of Chitinases and type VI secretion system associated rhs-related genetic element were identified and their potential antibacterial activity were investigated. E. <b>cloacae</b> ENHK was further demonstrated to suppress the growth of several plant pathogenic fungal species Alternaria sp., Choanephora infundibulifera, Colletotrichum capsici, Didymella bryoniae, Fusarium oxysporum, Sclerotinia sclerotiorum and Sclerotinia rolfsii and a plant pathogenic bacterial species Ralstonia solanacearum. Among the publicly available completed genome sequences of the Enterobacter species complex, E. <b>cloacae</b> ENHK is most closely related to E. <b>cloacae</b> subsp. <b>cloacae</b> ATCC 13047, an opportunistic human pathogen. A comparative genome analysis showed that critical factors involving human pathogenesis in terms of virulence and specific adhesion were identified in the variable genomic regions in E. <b>cloacae</b> subsp. <b>cloacae</b> ATCC 13047 and are absent in E. <b>cloacae</b> ENHK. In addition, two microbial competition related type VI secretion systems (T 6 SS) were found conserved in both E. <b>cloacae</b> strains. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the two systems were associated with other plant-associated and human/animal-associated species respectively in the Enterobacteriaceae. The results indicated that T 6 SSs may provide the E. <b>cloacae</b> strains fitness advantages for microbial competition in the microflora of a diverse environment. In short, comparative genome analysis suggested that the conserved chromosomal regions retain the general physiological and survival of the species, while variable genomic regions {{play a critical role}} in determining the functional differences of the pathogenic E. <b>cloacae</b> subsp. <b>cloacae</b> ATCC 13047 and the endophytic E. <b>cloacae</b> ENHK.

Males court females with a display of ritualised body movements. When they have gained the female's interest, they guide it over a spermatophore they deposit on the ground, which the female then takes up with her <b>cloaca.</b> The eggs are fertilised internally. As in other crested newts, a female lays around 200 eggs per season, which are folded individually into leaves of aquatic plants. Larvae develop over two to four months until they reach metamorphosis and leave the water.|$|E
5|$|Like other reptiles, dinosaurs are {{primarily}} uricotelic, that is, their kidneys extract nitrogenous wastes from their bloodstream and excrete it as uric acid instead of urea or ammonia via the ureters into the intestine. In most living species, uric acid is excreted along with feces as a semisolid waste. However, {{at least some}} modern birds (such as hummingbirds) can be facultatively ammonotelic, excreting most of the nitrogenous wastes as ammonia. They also excrete creatine, rather than creatinine like mammals. This material, {{as well as the}} output of the intestines, emerges from the <b>cloaca.</b> In addition, many species regurgitate pellets, and fossil pellets that may have come from dinosaurs are known from as long ago as the Cretaceous period.|$|E

However, the risk factors and epidemiology pertaining to IMP-type metallo [...] lactamase-producing Enterobacter <b>cloacae</b> (IMP-producing E. <b>cloacae)</b> have not been systematically evaluated. We conducted a retrospective, matched case-control study of patients from whom IMP-producing E. <b>cloacae</b> isolates were obtained, in addition to performing thorough molecular analy-ses of the clinically obtained IMP-producing E. <b>cloacae</b> isolates. Unique cases with IMP-producing E. <b>cloacae</b> isolation were in-cluded. Patients with IMP-producing E. cloacaewere matched to uninfected controls at a ratio of 1 to 3. Fifteen IMP-producing E. <b>cloacae</b> cases were identified, with five of the isolates being obtained from blood, and they were matched to 45 uninfected con-trols. All (100 %) patients from whom IMP-producing E. <b>cloacae</b> isolates were obtained had indwelling devices at the time of iso-lation, compared with one (2. 2 %) uninfected control. Independent predictors for isolation of IMP-producing E. cloacaewere identified as cephalosporin exposure and invasive procedures within 3 months. Although in-hospital mortality rates were simi-lar between cases and controls (14. 3 % versus 13. 3 %), the in-hospital mortality of patients with IMP-producing E. cloacae-caused bacteremia was significantly higher (40 %) than the rate in controls.

40|$|The {{antibacterial}} {{activities of}} imipenem-cilastatin, meropenem-cilastatin, cefepime and ceftazidime against Enterobacter <b>cloacae</b> NOR- 1, which produces the carbapenem-hydrolyzing β-lactamase NmcA and a cephalosporinase, and {{against one of}} its in vitro-obtained ceftazidime-resistant mutant were compared by using an experimental model of pneumonia with immunocompetent rats. The MICs of the β-lactams with an inoculum of 5 log 10 CFU/ml were as follows for E. <b>cloacae</b> NOR- 1 and its ceftazidime-resistant mutant, respectively: imipenem, 16 and 128 μg/ml, meropenem, 4 and 32 μg/ml, cefepime, < 0. 03 and 1 μg/ml, and ceftazidime, 1 and 512 μg/ml. The chromosomally located cephalosporinase and carbapenem-hydrolyzing β-lactamase NmcA were inducible by cefoxitin and meropenem in E. <b>cloacae</b> NOR- 1, and both were stably overproduced in the ceftazidime-resistant mutant. Renal impairment was induced (uranyl nitrate, 1 mg/kg of body weight) in rats to simulate the human pharmacokinetic parameters for the β-lactams studied. Animals were intratracheally inoculated with 8. 5 log 10 CFU of E. <b>cloacae,</b> and therapy was initiated 3 h later. At that time, animal lungs showed bilateral pneumonia containing more than 6 log 10 CFU of E. <b>cloacae</b> per g of tissue. Despite the relative low MIC of meropenem for E. <b>cloacae</b> NOR- 1, the carbapenem-treated rats had no decrease in bacterial counts in their lungs 60 h after therapy onset compared to the counts for the controls, regardless of whether E. <b>cloacae</b> NOR- 1 or its ceftazidime-resistant mutant was inoculated. A significant decrease in bacterial titers was observed for the ceftazidime-treated rats infected with E. <b>cloacae</b> NOR- 1 only. Cefepime was the only β-lactam tested effective as treatment against infections due to E. <b>cloacae</b> NOR- 1 or its ceftazidime-resistant mutant...|$|R
40|$|ObjectiveThe {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to review the early clinical profiles and outcomes of very-low-birth-weight (VLBW) neonates with late-onset sepsis caused by Enterobacter <b>cloacae.</b> MethodsWe reviewed the medical records of VLBW neonates whose blood and/or cerebral spinal fluid yielded E. <b>cloacae</b> after 3 days of hospitalization in our neonatal intensive care unit. ResultsFrom January 1997 to December 2006, a total of 29 episodes of E. <b>cloacae</b> infection occurred in 28 VLBW neonates. The onset of E. <b>cloacae</b> infection ranged from 4 to 70 days (27. 4 ± 9. 6) days after birth. The most common symptoms and signs of sepsis were desaturation (58. 6 %), tachycardia (58. 6 %), apnea (55. 2 %), unstable body temperature (48. 3 %), and decreased activity (44. 8 %). The infected neonates had an average of four kinds of symptoms in each sepsis episode. The most common laboratory findings in VLBW neonates with E. <b>cloacae</b> sepsis were thrombocytopenia (65. 5 %), C-reactive protein ≧ 1 mg/dL (55. 2 %), band-form neutrophils ≧ 5 % (41. 4 %), and leucopoenia (20. 7 %). Empirical intravenous antibiotic therapy comprising piperacillin (or piperacillin and tazobactam) and gentamicin (or amikacin) was successful in the early treatment of 24 episodes of E. <b>cloacae</b> sepsis in 25 patients. Three neonates (10. 7 %) died due to E. <b>cloacae</b> sepsis. Four neonates (14. 3 %) developed E. <b>cloacae</b> meningitis, and two of them developed brain abscesses. ConclusionE. <b>cloacae</b> infection in VLBW neonates usually presents with non-specific symptoms and signs. Early recognition of sepsis and empirical combination of piperacillin (or piperacillin and tazobactam) and gentamicin (or amikacin) may be useful for treatment of sepsis caused by this highly virulent pathogen...|$|R
5|$|Males within Palaeognathae (with the {{exception}} of the kiwis), the Anseriformes (with {{the exception}} of screamers), and in rudimentary forms in Galliformes (but fully developed in Cracidae) possess a penis, which is never present in Neoaves. The length is thought to be related to sperm competition. When not copulating, it is hidden within the proctodeum compartment within the <b>cloaca,</b> just inside the vent. The digestive system of birds is unique, with a crop for storage and a gizzard that contains swallowed stones for grinding food to compensate for the lack of teeth. Most birds are highly adapted for rapid digestion to aid with flight. Some migratory birds have adapted to use protein from many parts of their bodies, including protein from the intestines, as additional energy during migration.|$|E
5|$|Sharks and {{rays are}} basal fish with {{numerous}} primitive anatomical features {{similar to those}} of ancient fish, including skeletons composed of cartilage. Their bodies tend to be dorso-ventrally flattened, they usually have five pairs of gill slits and a large mouth set {{on the underside of the}} head. The dermis is covered with separate dermal placoid scales. They have a <b>cloaca</b> into which the urinary and genital passages open, but not a swim bladder. Cartilaginous fish produce a small number of large, yolky eggs. Some species are ovoviviparous and the young develop internally but others are oviparous and the larvae develop externally in egg cases.|$|E
5|$|The kidneys and {{excretory}} {{system are}} {{much the same}} as in other reptiles, but crocodilians do not have a bladder. In fresh water, the osmolality (the concentration of solutes that contribute to a solution's osmotic pressure) in the plasma is much higher {{than it is in the}} surrounding water. The animals are well-hydrated, and the urine in the <b>cloaca</b> is abundant and dilute, nitrogen being excreted as ammonium bicarbonate. Sodium loss is low and mainly takes place through the skin in freshwater conditions. In seawater, the opposite is true. The osmolality in the plasma is lower than the surrounding water, which is dehydrating for the animal. The cloacal urine is much more concentrated, white, and opaque, with the nitrogenous waste being mostly excreted as insoluble uric acid.|$|E
40|$|Background/PurposeEnterobacter <b>cloacae</b> is a well-recognized {{nosocomial}} pathogen. Use of a rapid, in vivo infection {{model for}} E. <b>cloacae</b> that {{can determine the}} efficacy of antibiotic therapies could help facilitate screening for new treatments. Nonmammalian model systems of infection, such as Galleria mellonella, have significant logistical and ethical advantages over mammalian models. Materials and methodsWe utilized G. mellonella larvae to determine the utility of this infection model to study antibacterial efficacy. G. mellonella killing with heat-killed or live clinical isolates (E. <b>cloacae</b> GN 1059 and GN 0791) was tested. We also investigated the effect of postinoculation incubation temperature on the survival of infected larvae. The protection of administration of antibiotics to infected larvae was investigated. Finally, we determined the G. mellonella hemolymph burden of E. <b>cloacae</b> after administration of different antibiotics. ResultsWith live bacterial inocula, G. mellonella killing was significantly dependent {{on the number of}} E. <b>cloacae</b> cells injected in a dose-dependent manner. Further, we observed that survival was reduced with increasing the postinoculation temperature. Treatment of a lethal E. <b>cloacae</b> infection with antibiotics that had in vitro activity significantly prolonged the survival of larvae compared with treatment with antibiotics to which the bacteria were resistant. The therapeutic benefit arising from administration of antibiotic correlated with a reduced burden of E. <b>cloacae</b> cells in the hemolymph. ConclusionThe G. mellonella infection model {{has the potential to be}} used to facilitate the in vivo study of host–pathogen interactions in E. <b>cloacae</b> and the efficacy of antibacterial agents...|$|R
