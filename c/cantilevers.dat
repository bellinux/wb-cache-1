40|$|Aim: This study aims {{to analyze}} the stress {{patterns}} and displacement in the <b>cantilever</b> resin bonded fixed partial denture (RBFPD) and compare it with the conventional <b>cantilever</b> fixed partial denture using 3 -D finite element analysis. Also, the effect of cement on the displacement and stress patterns in conventional <b>cantilever</b> fixed partial denture was to be analyzed. Materials and Methods: Three-dimensional models were prepared layer wise to depict the conventional <b>cantilever</b> and the <b>cantilever</b> RBFPD. Once the models were made, the material properties were assigned and divided into three groups. (2 -conventional <b>cantilever</b> with resin cement, 1 - conventional <b>cantilever</b> with GIC cement and 3 -resin bonded <b>cantilever</b> with resin cement). Load was applied in vertical as well as lateral directions and the stress patterns along with displacement were analyzed. Results: The results revealed that the von Mises stresses in all the three groups {{were found to be}} almost equal under vertical loading. Under lateral loading, the stress was more in <b>cantilever</b> RBFPD. Displacement in all the three axes was significantly less in the <b>cantilever</b> RBFPD. Conclusion: Stress concentration in the lateral direction in <b>cantilever</b> RBFPD was found to be higher than the <b>cantilever</b> conventional group. Displacement in X, Y and Z axes was less in <b>cantilever</b> RBFPD...|$|R
40|$|A {{piezoelectric}} <b>cantilever</b> with a non-piezoelectric, or piezoelectric tip {{useful as}} mass and viscosity sensors. The {{change in the}} <b>cantilever</b> mass can be accurately quantified by monitoring a resonance frequency shift of the <b>cantilever.</b> For bio-detection, antibodies or other specific receptors of target antigens may be immobilized on the <b>cantilever</b> surface, preferably on the non-piezoelectric tip. For chemical detection, high surface-area selective absorbent materials are coated on the <b>cantilever</b> tip. Binding of the target antigens or analytes to the <b>cantilever</b> surface increases the <b>cantilever</b> mass. Detection of target antigens or analytes is achieved by monitoring the <b>cantilever's</b> resonance frequency and determining the resonance frequency shift that {{is due to the}} mass of the adsorbed target antigens on the <b>cantilever</b> surface. The use of a piezoelectric unimorph <b>cantilever</b> allows both electrical actuation and electrical sensing. Incorporating a non-piezoelectric tip (14) enhances the sensitivity of the sensor.

40|$|ABSTRACT: It is {{demonstrated}} experimentally {{that the energy}} harvested from a random noise source by a piezoelectric <b>cantilever</b> can be substantially enhanced by introducing a mag-netic coupling force. The coupled <b>cantilever</b> responds to a 1 /f vibration spectrum (‘pink noise’) with chaotic motion that on average has larger amplitude than the non-chaotic motion of an uncoupled <b>cantilever.</b> A 50 % increase in output voltage was observed in the coupled <b>cantilever</b> compared to the uncoupled <b>cantilever.</b> Calculations show that the magnetic force transforms the quadratic spring potential of the <b>cantilever</b> into a double valley of two potential wells. Fluctuations between the two potential minima increase the amplitude of the <b>cantilever</b> motion over a range of vibration frequencies.

5|$|However, {{although}} the spectators {{would now be}} able to see the players at night, they still suffered from the problem of obstructed views caused by the pillars that supported the roofs. With the 1966 FIFA World Cup fast approaching, this prompted the United directors to completely redesign the United Road (north) stand. The old roof pillars were replaced in 1965 with modern-style cantilevering on top of the roof, allowing every spectator a completely unobstructed view, while it was also expanded to hold 20,000 spectators (10,000 seated and 10,000 standing in front) at a cost of £350,000. The architects of the new stand, Mather and Nutter (now Atherden Fuller), rearranged the organisation of the stand to have terracing at the front, a larger seated area towards the back, and the first private boxes at a British football ground. The east stand – the only remaining uncovered stand – was developed in the same style in 1973. With the first two stands converted to <b>cantilevers,</b> the club's owners devised a long-term plan to do the same to the other two stands and convert the stadium into a bowl-like arena. Such an undertaking would serve to increase the atmosphere within the ground by containing the crowd's noise and focusing it onto the pitch, where the players would feel the full effects of a capacity crowd. Meanwhile, the stadium hosted its third FA Cup Final, hosting 62,078 spectators for the replay of the 1970 final between Chelsea and Leeds United; Chelsea won the match 2–1. The ground also hosted the second leg of the 1968 Intercontinental Cup, which saw Estudiantes de La Plata win the cup after a 1–1 draw. The 1970s saw the dramatic rise of football hooliganism in Britain, and a knife-throwing incident in 1971 forcing the club to erect the country's first perimeter fence, restricting fans from the Old Trafford pitch.|$|E
25|$|In 1995, the Western Pennsylvania Conservancy {{commissioned}} {{a study of}} Fallingwater’s structural integrity. Structural engineers analyzed {{the movement of the}} <b>cantilevers</b> over time and conducted radar studies of the <b>cantilevers</b> to locate and quantify the reinforcement. These showed that the contractor had indeed added reinforcement over Wright's plan; nevertheless, the <b>cantilevers</b> were still insufficiently reinforced. An architecture firm was hired to fix the problem. Both the concrete and its steel reinforcement were close to their failure limits. As a result, in 1997, temporary girders were installed beneath the <b>cantilevers</b> to carry their weight.|$|E

The <b>cantilever</b> beam was fabricated using porous silicon micromachining techniques, surface tension and the difference in the thermal expansion coelticients between the two films on the <b>cantilever</b> beam. Then the height of the curled <b>cantilever</b> beam is measured {{as a function of the}} annealing temperature and time. Using these results, Piezoresistive flow sensors with micro <b>cantilever</b> structure were fabricated using (loo), nln'ln three layer silicon wafer and their characteristics were then investigated. The proposed micro flow sensor consists offour identical silicon <b>cantilever</b> beam with piezoresistors. The total resistance and sheet resistance were obtained about 1 KP and 5 (MI respectively. The results show the dependence of the sensitivity on <b>cantilever</b> length and geometry.

25|$|A {{cantilever}} bridge is a bridge built using <b>cantilevers,</b> structures that project horizontally into space, supported {{on only one}} end. For small footbridges, the <b>cantilevers</b> may be simple beams; however, large {{cantilever bridge}}s designed to handle road or rail traffic use trusses built from structural steel, or box girders built from prestressed concrete. The steel truss cantilever bridge was a major engineering breakthrough when first put into practice, as it can span distances of over , and can be more easily constructed at difficult crossings by virtue of using little or no falsework.|$|E

50|$|A {{piezoelectric}} <b>cantilever</b> {{is mounted}} directly above {{a base of}} the radioactive isotope nickel-63. All of the radiation emitted as the millicurie-level nickel-63 thin film decays {{is in the form}} of beta radiation, which consists of electrons. As the <b>cantilever</b> accumulates the emitted electrons, it builds up a negative charge at the same time that the isotope film becomes positively charged. The beta particles essentially transfer electronic charge from the thin film to the <b>cantilever.</b> The opposite charges cause the <b>cantilever</b> to bend toward the isotope film. Just as the <b>cantilever</b> touches the thin-film isotope, the charge jumps the gap. That permits current to flow back onto the isotope, equalizing the charge and resetting the <b>cantilever.</b> As long as the isotope is decaying - a process that can last for decades - the tiny <b>cantilever</b> will continue its up-and-down motion. As the <b>cantilever</b> directly generates electricity when deformed, a charge pulse is released each time the <b>cantilever</b> cycles.|$|R

40|$|Micromechanical {{sensors can be}} {{developed}} that have the sensitivity to detect single, individual biological entities such as bacteria, spores, viruses and so on. In the present study, <b>cantilever</b> beams are used as resonance-detector based mass sensors for biological entities. Microsized <b>cantilever</b> beams were used to detect the mass of Listeria innocua bacteria by applying increasing concentration of bacteria suspension in fluid on the same <b>cantilever</b> beam and measuring the resonant frequency changes in air. <b>Cantilever</b> beams have also been used to detect the mass of adsorbed antibodies, following which {{they were used to}} demonstrate the capture of bacterial cells on the <b>cantilever</b> beam surface. In order to detect smaller masses such as those of virus particles, it is necessary to scale down the dimensions of the <b>cantilever</b> beams in order to achieve the required mass sensitivity. <b>Cantilever</b> beams with dimensions in the range of 4 - 5 μm length, 1 - 2 μm width and 20 - 30 nm thickness, have been fabricated using silicon-on-insulator wafers. These <b>cantilever</b> beams have been used to detect the mass of a single vaccinia virus (dry) particle under ambient conditions. Resonator mass-detection capability can also be improved by externally driving the <b>cantilever</b> beams, using a piezoelectric layer below the <b>cantilever</b> chip. Towards the goal of obtaining selectivity of capture, antibodies and protein layers were attached on the <b>cantilever</b> surface.

25|$|Steel truss <b>cantilevers</b> support loads by {{tension of}} the upper members and {{compression}} of the lower ones. Commonly, the structure distributes the tension via the anchor arms to the outermost supports, while the compression is carried to the foundations beneath the central towers. Many truss cantilever bridges use pinned joints and are therefore statically determinate with no members carrying mixed loads.|$|E

25|$|On {{the basis}} of the {{previous}} statements, it is evident that <b>cantilevers</b> should be as long as possible, if their aim is to produce only a moment, while the force is less desirable.

30|$|Typically, <b>cantilever</b> sensors {{are used}} to assay a {{specific}} target molecule or different targets from a mixture of molecules.

25|$|The corbel {{arch bridge}} is a masonry, or stone, bridge where each {{successively}} higher course (layer) <b>cantilevers</b> {{slightly more than}} the previous course.

25|$|A common way to {{construct}} steel truss and prestressed concrete <b>cantilever</b> spans is to counterbalance each <b>cantilever</b> arm with another <b>cantilever</b> arm projecting the opposite direction, forming a balanced cantilever; when they attach to a solid foundation, the counterbalancing arms are called anchor arms. Thus, in a bridge built on two foundation piers, {{there are four}} <b>cantilever</b> arms: two which span the obstacle, and two anchor arms which extend away from the obstacle. Because {{of the need for}} more strength at the balanced <b>cantilever's</b> supports, the bridge superstructure often takes the form of towers above the foundation piers.
