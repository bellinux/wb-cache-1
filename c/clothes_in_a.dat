5|$|Upon {{the urging}} of his crewmen, Choe changed his <b>clothes</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> ritual fashion in {{preparation}} for death, although he prayed to the heavens to spare him and his crew, asking what sins they had committed to deserve this fate. On the sixth day, during fairer weather, their ship came upon a group of islands in the Yellow Sea where Chinese pirates were moored. The pirates robbed their ship of spare goods and rations, threw away the Koreans' oars and anchor, and left them to drift aimlessly into the sea.|$|E
5|$|Calling himself Anders, and feigning {{an injured}} leg, Kator is {{taken in by}} Jessica and Jo. His arrival {{immediately}} causes friction between the two. Bored of her monotonous existence, Jessica welcomes the stranger's arrival. Jo, however, openly resents his presence and suggests that the socially-awkward Anders is an escapee from a psychiatric hospital (which she is herself). Later, having returned {{to the spot where}} he killed Anderson and Sandy, Kator kills and partly devours two policemen who are examining the couple's abandoned car. Back at the house, Jessica finds a knife and bloodstained <b>clothes</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> spare bedroom; recognising the latter as Simon's, she realises that he was murdered by Jo.|$|E
5|$|Following his {{discharge}} from military service, Groza {{reported to the}} Browns' training camp in Bowling Green, Ohio. He showed up in army fatigues carrying all his <b>clothes</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> duffel bag. There, he joined quarterback Otto Graham, fullback Marion Motley and receivers Dante Lavelli and Mac Speedie to form {{the core of the}} new team's offense. Groza was mainly a placekicker in his first two years with the Browns, but he played a big part in the team's early success. In his first season, he set a professional football record for both field goals and extra points. The Browns, meanwhile, advanced to the AAFC championship against the New York Yankees. Groza sprained his ankle in the game and missed three field goals, but Cleveland won 14–9. Behind a powerful offense led by Graham, Motley and Lavelli, the Browns finished the 1947 season with a 12–1–1 record and made it back to the championship game. Groza, however, was injured and could only watch as the team won its second championship in a row.|$|E

25|$|Some {{people need}} to wear special clothes such as {{business}} suits or uniforms in their daily work. In some cases {{the nature of the}} cycling infrastructure and the prevailing weather conditions may make it very hard to both cycle and maintain the work <b>clothes</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> presentable condition. It is argued that such workers can be encouraged to cycle by providing lockers, changing rooms and shower facilities where they can change before starting work.|$|E
25|$|The video {{opens with}} Brandy giving her fictional boyfriend a watch. However, the couple starts to fight {{after a few}} seconds, leading Brandy to drive the boyfriend {{to the middle of}} a road and leaving him alone. She then changes her Facebook status to 'Single'. Next, we see Monica giving her lover a new car. The scene then cuts to both having a {{discussion}} on their room, that ends with Monica cutting her boyfriend's necktie with a pair of scissors. The singers are then seen together dressing black leather <b>clothes</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> bathroom. As they leave, they carry a MacBook, a golden box and a suit, while placing the items inside the car Monica had previously given her lover. As the lover watches both from afar, Monica and Brandy wave him goodbye. They leave on Brandy's car, as the other explodes in front of Monica's old house. The video ends with a dedication to Whitney Houston. Some of the video shows scenes of Brandy and Monica sitting the same way from Brandy's left and Monica's right with their chairs, Monica singing in the light with a hat and black clothing and later a beret headband from the 70s, Brandy and Monica singing in their dress and signing behind the mirror with the light.|$|E

500|$|For the game's characters, {{the team}} wished {{to explore the}} concept of opposites, mainly {{represented}} by the White Witch's goal to destroy the world, and Oliver's attempts to save it. The character performances were mostly recorded using motion capture technology, followed by manual adjustment by the team to make a [...] "more anime-like movement". The game's characters were particularly inspired by Level-5's previous work on the Professor Layton series (2007–present).

The game's main playable character, Oliver, is a 13-year-old boy. The team decided to make him a child as they wished to showcase a coming of age story. They wanted children to empathize with Oliver's development, and adults to relive the excitement of their adolescence. A major part of the story is Oliver's personal development, which Hino describes as [...] "the process of how a child grows into an adult". In regards to Oliver's physical appearance, Momose made his outfit represent a young boy in 1950s America, which was the inspiration for his hometown.|$|E

After spending the night in a tent on the beach, they secretly ride along on the load space of a pick-up truck the next morning and leave the town. Subsequently, Inna and the man arrive in a desert and hitch a ride by holding a sign reading [...] "Anywhere". After getting a ride, they leave the car on a motel next to the road, where Inna enters to sing on a stage. The singer then tries to make a phone call, with the musician flirting with a blond girl at the bar. Inna kisses her on the mouth and then chooses a jukebox track. This is followed by the singer and him renting a room for the night.|$|E
500|$|Khan's parents {{divorced}} {{when he was}} still a toddler, after which his mother moved to Mumbai. In an interview, Khan called his step-father, Raj Zutshi, as the father figure during his growing years. He was enrolled at Bombay Scottish School, where he developed a stammer due to corporal punishments such as caning. According to Khan, his grades fell and his academic career went into a [...] "strong decline" [...] due to his inability to cope with his new environment and radically changed family situation; he became nervous and developed facial tics. Meanwhile, his mother married again and found it convenient to send him to a boarding school, choosing Blue Mountain School in distant Coonoor, Tamil Nadu. After a period of depression in Coonoor, Khan adjusted and grew into the environment; he later described his experience there as [...] "phenomenal," [...] although his grades remained poor. When the principal of that school left to start his own school, Khan and several other students followed him to a Gurukul in the jungles of Ooty. The new school had no electricity, the students were required to wash their <b>clothes</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> creek and they even grew some of the food they ate. Khan later admitted that frequently changing schools made him independent but also a loner.|$|E

The first public act of striptease in modern times is credited to Parisian theater in 1894.|$|E
2500|$|In some {{versions}} of the story, the event {{is said to have}} taken place in Ephesus, in the House of the Virgin Mary. This is a much more recent and localized tradition. The earliest traditions say that Mary's life ended in Jerusalem (see [...] "Mary's Tomb"). By the 7th century, a variation emerged, according to which one of the apostles, often identified as St Thomas, was not present at the death of Mary but his late arrival precipitates a reopening of Mary's tomb, which is found to be empty except for her grave <b>clothes.</b> <b>In</b> <b>a</b> later tradition, Mary drops her girdle down to the apostle from heaven as testament to the event.

Planning was eschewed, as hippies were happy to put a few <b>clothes</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> backpack, stick out their thumbs and hitchhike anywhere. Hippies seldom worried whether they had money, hotel reservations {{or any of the}} other standard accoutrements of travel. Hippie households welcomed overnight guests on an impromptu basis, and the reciprocal nature of the lifestyle permitted greater freedom of movement. People generally cooperated to meet each other's needs in ways that became less common after the early 1970s. This way of life is still seen among Rainbow Family groups, new age travellers and New Zealand's housetruckers.|$|E
