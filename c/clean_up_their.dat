5|$|The video commences with a {{scene of}} the band {{beginning}} to perform the song in a house's detached garage. When the first verse starts, Stefani's ex-lover (Terry Hall) walks by the house before sitting down on a swing. Stefani changes her shoes as the song's chorus is played; she walks away from the garage and down a street to a grocery store. At the store, she purchases four cans of tomato sauce, and quickly leaves. Meanwhile, Dumont, Kanal, and Young prepare a large dinner for the band as Stefani reenters the home. Stefani slices tomatoes, Dumont cooks some spaghetti noodles, Kanal cuts up a few onions, and Young sets the table. At the song's bridge, Stefani accidentally cuts herself with a knife and Kanal drops a pot of pasta sauce; both of them promptly <b>clean</b> <b>up</b> <b>their</b> messes as dinner is served. Dumont initiates a food fight, and touring members Gabrial McNair and Stephen Bradley join in. The video ends with the ex-lover sitting alone on the swing.|$|E

25|$|The city of Asheville {{is home to}} a Duke Energy Progress {{coal power}} plant near Lake Julian. This power plant is {{designated}} as having Coal Combustion Residue Surface Impoundments with a High Hazard Potential by the EPA. In 2012 a Duke University study found high levels of arsenic and other toxins in North Carolina lakes and rivers downstream from the Asheville power plants coal ash ponds. Samples collected from coal ash waste flowing from the ponds at the Duke Energy Progress plant to the French Broad River in Buncombe County contained arsenic levels more than four times higher than the EPA drinking water standard, and levels of selenium 17 times higher than the agency's standard for aquatic life. In March 2013 the State of North Carolina sued Duke Energy Progress in order to address similar environmental compliance issues. In July 2013 Duke Energy Corp. and North Carolina environmental regulators proposed a settlement in the lawsuit that stated coal ash threatened Asheville's water supply. The settlement called for Duke to assess the sources and extent of contamination at the Riverbend power plant in Asheville. Duke would be fined $99,100 if the settlement is approved. Following the coal ash spill in Eden, NC resulting in 82,000 tons of coal ash leaking into the Dan River, the North Carolina DENR cancelled all previous settlements with Duke Energy. Duke said a stormwater drainage pipe under the utility's Dan River Steam Station lagoon ruptured Feb 2, allowing ash slurry to pour into the river. Duke Energy faces future legislation by Tom Apodaca, republican NCGA Senate leader forcing them to <b>clean</b> <b>up</b> <b>their</b> south Asheville coal ash ponds. Tom Apodaca expects the legislation will be filed as soon as the General Assembly returns to session in May 2014. Apodaca expects the ponds will be cleaned up in 5–10 years under his law.|$|E

500|$|... "Death in Bloom" [...] {{was written}} and storyboarded by Jesse Moynihan and Cole Sanchez, from {{a story by}} Mark Banker, Kent Osborne, Patrick McHale, and series creator Pendleton Ward. The episode was {{directed}} by Larry Leichliter. Both Ward and fellow series storyboard artist Tom Herpich helped Moynihan and Sanchez <b>clean</b> <b>up</b> <b>their</b> story. One scene, in which Finn and Jake hide from the skeletons only to have Jake's flatulence alert them to their presence, {{was supposed to be}} storyboarded by Ward. However, he was extremely tired and offered Herpich $100—the amount Ward would have earned had he done it—to storyboard the scene instead. The episode features an extremely long pan showing much of the Land of the Dead. Moynihan noted that he [...] "wanted to really go over the top and make it like 15 pages but 7 pages felt right"; he later said that he wanted to [...] "blow kids' minds" [...] with the shot. Moynihan's original pan was redesigned by background designer Dan [...] "Ghostshrimp" [...] James, who also did some of the other backgrounds for the episode. Other background were done by Chris Tsirgiotis, who, according to Moynihan, was doing his [...] "best Ghostshrimp impression"; Tsirgiotis himself later noted that, [...] "Matching Ghostshrimp’s drawing style is pretty tricky. It looks simple at first glance, but it’s actually very sophisticated and nuanced." ...|$|E
500|$|On April 9, 1987, {{a two-hour}} meeting with {{three members of}} the FHLBB San Francisco branch was held, again in DeConcini's office, to discuss the government's {{investigation}} of Lincoln. Present were Cranston, DeConcini, Glenn, McCain, and additionally Riegle. The regulators felt that the meeting was very unusual and that they were being pressured by a united front, as the senators presented their reasons for having the meeting. DeConcini began the meeting by saying, [...] "We wanted to meet with you because we have determined that potential actions of yours could injure a constituent." [...] McCain said, [...] "One of our jobs as elected officials is to help constituents in a proper fashion. ACC [...] is a big employer and important to the local economy. I wouldn't want any special favors for them.... I don't want any part of our conversation to be improper." [...] Glenn said, [...] "To be blunt, you should charge them or get off their backs," [...] while DeConcini said, [...] "What's wrong with this if they're willing to <b>clean</b> <b>up</b> <b>their</b> act? ... It's very unusual for us to have a company that could be put out of business by its regulators." [...] The regulators then revealed that Lincoln was under criminal investigation on a variety of serious charges, at which point McCain severed all relations with Keating.|$|E

2500|$|During {{the nineteenth}} century, {{particularly}} from the 1860s to the 1890s, many streetcar operators switched from animals to other types of motive power. [...] Before the use of electricity the use of steam dummies, tram engines, or cable cars was tried in several North American cities. [...] A notable transition took place in Washington, D.C. in the U.S. where horsecars were used on street railways from 1862 to the early 1890s. [...] From about 1890 to 1893 cable drives provided motive power to Washington streetcars, and after 1893 electricity powered the cars. [...] The advantages of eliminating animal drive power included dispensing {{with the need to}} feed the animals and <b>clean</b> <b>up</b> <b>their</b> waste.

2500|$|Polyergus breviceps is {{a species}} of ant which is endemic to the United States. It is a social {{parasite}} of other ants, namely of Formica gnava but also of Formica occulta and Formica argentea. Polyergus is an inquiline parasite, having lost its ability {{to take care of}} its young and themselves. [...] "The workers do not forage for food, feed the young or the queen, or even <b>clean</b> <b>up</b> <b>their</b> own nest". In order to survive, Polyergus workers raid Formica nests in order to steal the pupae which once hatched, become workers of the mixed nest. This sort of relationship is not unique, of the approximately 8,800 species of ants, at least 200 have evolved some form of symbiotic relationship with one another. What makes Polyergus special is the way a newly mated queen can, all by herself, take over a Formica nest and start a new colony.|$|E
2500|$|Two {{other major}} {{sporting}} events {{that followed the}} Super Bowl that year also were forced to <b>clean</b> <b>up</b> <b>their</b> respective halftime shows following the incident. The Pro Bowl, which would be played on February 8 at Aloha Stadium in Hawaii, originally was to feature singer JC Chasez, {{who was a member}} of boy band 'N Sync as was Timberlake, sing the National Anthem before the game and perform his hit song [...] "Blowin' Me Up (with Her Love)" [...] at halftime. However, the NFL did not allow Chasez to perform during halftime due to the sexually suggestive content of his chosen song (even though the game was carried by ESPN, which is not under the content purview of the FCC as it is a cable network, and therefore only self-regulates content as an advertiser-supported service), replacing it with traditional Hawaiian dancers. The 2004 NBA All-Star Game also cleaned up its act, despite being broadcast on TNT (which in reiteration, is not bound by FCC content regulations as a cable network), having halftime performer Beyoncé Knowles perform [...] "Crazy in Love" [...] rather than [...] "Naughty Girl", which they feared would incite controversy given its sexual content. Jackson was in attendance at the game, and dressed conservatively. The networks that were to broadcast the 46th Grammy Awards (CBS) and the 76th Academy Awards (ABC), live events scheduled for February 8 and February 29 respectively, enhanced their broadcast delays to accommodate editing of inappropriate video in addition to audio.|$|E
