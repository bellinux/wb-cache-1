40|$|The {{elderly and}} African Americans are groups {{sometimes}} described as vulnerable or {{at risk for}} health complications, and both are communities for whom <b>consumer</b> <b>health</b> information {{is believed to be}} important. A review of recent research literature on the information behaviors of these two special populations is provided, and information is presented from the research literature about the use of the Internet by the elderly and by Afri-can Americans. Both groups seem to prefer information from their health care providers and/or from established sources, but both groups do seek <b>consumer</b> <b>health</b> information and are increasingly using the Internet for information searches. The characteristics of desirable Web-based <b>consumer</b> <b>health</b> information for these groups are presented, as well as tools or tips that are available for evaluating Web-based <b>consumer</b> <b>health</b> information for these special populations. Finally, specific <b>consumer</b> <b>health</b> Web sites that provide quality information and that are especially useful for the elderly and for African Americans are identified. In order to understand the use of Internet-based <b>consumer</b> <b>health</b> informa-tion by vulnerable groups, it is helpful to look at current research and data on specific information behaviors and Internet use by two special communi-ties—the elderly and African Americans. These groups are often described as vulnerable and as having distinct <b>consumer</b> <b>health</b> information needs.

40|$|Consumers are {{increasingly}} interested in {{information that will}} help them manage their own health and that of their families. Managed care and other <b>health</b> providers see <b>consumer</b> <b>health</b> information as one tool to help improve patient satisfaction and reduce costs. There is a huge and varied supply of such information, provided through myriad sources. This article summarizes findings from a preliminary assessment of <b>consumer</b> <b>health</b> information demand and delivery supported by the U. S. Department of Health and Human Services. It highlights patterns of consumer interest and supply sources, identifies problems that confront those looking for information, and suggests a role for libraries as providers and interpreters of health information.

In the sixteen years since then, the scope of <b>consumer</b> <b>health</b> information has become huge and diverse; with increased responsibility for <b>health,</b> <b>consumers</b> have developed both broad interests and very specific needs.

40|$|In {{the past}} two decades, <b>consumer</b> <b>health</b> {{libraries}} have proliferated {{in response to the}} changing health care environment and consumer demand. While this growth of <b>consumer</b> <b>health</b> resources and services has been extensively described in the literature, there is little documentation about the impact and value of providing <b>consumer</b> <b>health</b> information. This paper explores the issues of impact and value as examined in a retrospective study of <b>consumers</b> who received <b>health</b> information from the Delaware Academy of Medicine's <b>Consumer</b> <b>Health</b> Library during 1995. In this study, 270 adults were mailed a questionnaire that focused on whether the information influenced decisions, actions, anxiety levels, and patient-provider communication. The questionnaire also addressed the value of such library service in terms of likelihood of repeat use, recommendation to others, and willingness to pay. The results, based on a return rate of 86. 7 %, identified effects of library-supplied <b>consumer</b> <b>health</b> information that extend beyond the anticipated acquisition of knowledge to specific actions and effects on anxiety. The value of <b>consumer</b> <b>health</b> library information service was shown by the extremely high percentage of probable repeat use and recommendation to others, the willingness of 83. 8 % of the respondents to pay for such service, and the copious comments volunteered by the respondents...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: This {{study has}} two objectives: first, to {{identify}} and characterize <b>consumer</b> <b>health</b> terms {{not found in the}} Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) Metathesaurus (2007 AB); second, to describe the procedure for creating new concepts in the process of building a <b>consumer</b> <b>health</b> vocabulary. How do the unmapped <b>consumer</b> <b>health</b> concepts relate to the existing UMLS concepts? What is the place of these new concepts in professional medical discourse? DESIGN: The <b>consumer</b> <b>health</b> terms were extracted from two large corpora derived in the process of Open Access Collaboratory <b>Consumer</b> <b>Health</b> Vocabulary (OAC CHV) building. Terms that could not be mapped to existing UMLS concepts via machine and manual methods prompted creation of new concepts, which were then ascribed semantic types, related to existing UMLS concepts, and coded according to specified criteria. RESULTS: This approach identified 64 unmapped concepts, 17 of which were labeled as uniquely 2 ̆ 2 lay 2 ̆ 2 and not feasible for inclusion in professional health terminologies. The remaining terms constituted potential candidates for inclusion in professional vocabularies, or could be constructed by post-coordinating existing UMLS terms. The relationship between new and existing concepts differed depending on the corpora from which they were extracted. CONCLUSION: Non-mapping concepts constitute a small proportion of <b>consumer</b> <b>health</b> terms, but a proportion that is likely to affect the process of <b>consumer</b> <b>health</b> vocabulary building. We have identified a novel approach for identifying such concepts...|$|R
