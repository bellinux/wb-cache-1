25|$|The {{reign of}} Shah Abbas I (1588–1629) was {{initially}} benign. Jews prospered throughout Persia and were even encouraged {{to settle in}} Isfahan, which was made a new capital. However, {{toward the end of}} his rule, the treatment of Jews became harsher; upon advice from a Jewish convert and Shi'a clergy, the Shah forced Jews to wear a distinctive badge on clothing and headgear. In 1656, all Jews were expelled from Isfahan because of the common belief of their impurity and forced to convert to Islam. However, as it became known that the converts continued to practice Judaism in secret and because the treasury suffered from the loss of jizya collected from the Jews, they were allowed to revert to Judaism in 1661. However, they were still required to wear a distinctive patch upon their <b>clothings.</b>|$|E

25|$|Within {{the colony}} of the Dutch East Indies, fashion played an {{important}} role to define ones' status and social class. The European colonials wore European fashion straight out of the Netherlands, or even Paris, while the natives wore their traditional <b>clothings</b> that are distinct in every regions. As the years progressed and the Dutch influence became stronger, many natives began mixing European styles within their traditional clothing. High-ranking natives within the colony as well as nobility, would wear European style suits with their batik sarongs for special occasions and even for everyday use. More and more native Indonesians began to dress more European. This of course came with the idea that those who wore European clothing were more progressive and open towards a European society and the etiquette that came with it. More and more the European influence was gaining precedence within native Indonesians. This probably {{stems from the fact that}} many natives were treated better if they wore European clothing. Their European counterparts acknowledged them, and that in turn was most likely a catalyst for adoption western clothing into traditional Indonesian clothing.|$|E

60|$|Could we suppose two {{distinct}} incommunicable consciousnesses acting the same body, the one constantly by day, {{the other by}} night; and, on the other side, the same consciousness, acting by intervals, {{two distinct}} bodies: I ask, in the first case, whether {{the day and the}} night--man would not be two as distinct persons as Socrates and Plato? And whether, in the second case, there would not be one person in two distinct bodies, as much as one man is the same in two distinct <b>clothings?</b> Nor is it at all material to say, that this same, and this distinct consciousness, in the cases above mentioned, is owing to the same and distinct immaterial substances, bringing it with them to those bodies; which, whether true or no, alters not the case: since it is evident the personal identity would equally be determined by the consciousness, whether that consciousness were annexed to some individual immaterial substance or no. For, granting that the thinking substance in man must be necessarily supposed immaterial, it is evident that immaterial thinking thing may sometimes part with its past consciousness, and be restored to it again: as appears in the forgetfulness men often have of their past actions; and the mind many times recovers the memory of a past consciousness, which it had lost for twenty years together. Make these intervals of memory and forgetfulness to take their turns regularly by day and night, and you have two persons with the same immaterial spirit, as much as in the former instance two persons with the same body. So that self is not determined by identity or diversity of substance, which it cannot be sure of, but only by identity of consciousness.|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 1983 Perception {{between people}} {{is part of}} the process of nonverbal communication. Person {{perception}} including body, facial expression, facial features, and <b>clothing</b> {{is part of the}} process that results in the formation of impressions of persons by each other. The purpose of this study was to investigate <b>clothing</b> perception and develop methods of evaluating what is noticed about <b>clothing</b> in simulated first encounter situations. This study investigated relationships between number and type of <b>clothing</b> clues, degree of liking for <b>clothing</b> viewed, and similarity of <b>clothing</b> of stimulus to subject (st/su). Data were collected in the form of written responses by 255 (116 male and 139 female) subjects responding to fourteen stimulus slides of men's and women's <b>clothing.</b> Responses were analyzed for each <b>clothing</b> slide to determine the number of <b>clothing</b> clues and types of <b>clothing</b> clues mentioned. <b>Clothing</b> clue words were categorized into three categories: descriptive (D), inferred (I), and evaluative (E). Two systems of coding the categories were developed: dominant and composite. Relationships between the four variables, number of clues, types of clues, degree of liking for <b>clothing</b> viewed, and similarity of <b>clothing</b> of stimulus/subject, were examined using tests of mean, median, chi-square, and the Spearman Correlation Coefficient. Of the six null hypothesis, one was rejected, four were partially rejected, and one failed to be rejected. There was no significant relationship between types of <b>clothing</b> clues mentioned and the degree of liking for the <b>clothing</b> viewed. There was a partial relationship between the number of <b>clothing</b> clues and the similarity of <b>clothing</b> of stimulus/subject. Female subjects tended to give a greater number of <b>clothing</b> clues than male subjects when they were viewing similar (female) <b>clothing</b> slides, and also greater numbers of <b>clothing</b> clues when viewing dissimilar (male) <b>clothing</b> slides. There was a partial relationship between number of <b>clothing</b> clues and degree of liking for <b>clothing</b> viewed. Nine of the fourteen <b>clothing</b> slides had no significant relationship between these variables. There was a partial relationship between the types of <b>clothing</b> clues given and the similarity of <b>clothing</b> of stimulus/subject. Using the dominant coding system there was no relationship between these variables. Using the composite coding system there was no significant relationship for ten of the fourteen <b>clothing</b> slides. There was a partial relationship between the degree of liking for <b>clothing</b> viewed and the similarity of <b>clothing</b> of stimulus/ subject. Although there were some significant differences between same sex and different sex in the degree of liking, examination of the data shows that there is not consistency in same sex (similar) scoring higher or lower than opposite sex (different) on degree of liking for <b>clothing</b> slide viewed. There was a significant relationship between number of <b>clothing</b> clues mentioned and type of <b>clothing</b> clue. Subjects using only descriptive words gave a significantly greater number of words. Subjects using only evaluative words gave significantly fewer words. Fewer subjects used words in the inferred category. In summary, female subjects viewing female <b>clothing</b> slides tended to give significantly different scores when noting the number of clues and the degree of liking for a <b>clothing</b> slide. Male subjects viewing male <b>clothing</b> slides gave fewer numbers of <b>clothing</b> clues than did female subjects. Male and female subjects did not give significantly different types of <b>clothing</b> clues when responding to either male or female <b>clothing</b> slides. This study shows that it is possible and useful to evaluate <b>clothing</b> perception to determine the number and types of <b>clothing</b> clues. The variables related to similarity and liking could be modified to achieve more determinant results. Additional studies can be undertaken to refine the methods and to investigate other variables related to <b>clothing</b> perception...|$|R
