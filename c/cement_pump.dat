5000|$|Cementing is {{performed}} by circulating a cement slurry through {{the inside of}} the casing and out into the annulus through the casing shoe {{at the bottom of the}} casing string. In order to precisely place the cement slurry at a required interval on the outside of the casing, a plug is pumped with a displacement fluid behind the cement slurry column, which [...] "bumps" [...] in the casing shoe and prevents further flow of fluid through the shoe. This bump can be seen at surface as a pressure spike at the <b>cement</b> <b>pump.</b> To prevent the cement from flowing back into {{the inside of the}} casing, a float collar above the casing shoe acts as a check valve and prevents fluid from flowing up through the shoe from the annulus.|$|E

50|$|An {{accurate}} {{evaluation of}} a casing cement job {{as well as of}} the formation is extremely important during the drilling of a well and for subsequent work. The Information resulting from Formation Integrity Tests (FIT) is used throughout the life of the well and also for nearby wells. Casing depths, well control options, formation fracture pressures and limiting fluid weights may be based on this information. To determine the strength and integrity of a formation, a Leak Off Test (LOT) or a Formation Integrity Test (FIT) may be performed. This test is first: a method of checking the cement seal between casing and the formation, and second: determining the pressure and/or fluid weight the test zone below the casing can sustain. Whichever test is performed, some general points should be observed. The fluid in the well should be circulated clean to ensure it is of a known and consistent density. If mud is used for the test, it should be properly conditioned and gel strengths minimized. The pump used should be a high-pressure, low-volume test or <b>cementing</b> <b>pump.</b> Rig pumps can be used if the rig has electric drives on the mud pumps, and they can be slowly rolled over. If the rig pump must be used and the pump cannot be easily controlled at low rates, then the leak-off technique must be modified. It is a good idea to make a graph of the pressure versus time or volume for all leak-off tests.|$|R
40|$|Cementing {{operation}} {{is one of}} the most challenging tasks in the completion phase of oil and gas wells. Many problems here are related to cement- displacement process, blending, additives, and the entire design of the cementing operation. Failure of primary cement jobs leads to expensive remedial cementing work like squeezing and plugging. This thesis work was focused in finding evidences of poor cement displacement jobs by considering three basic quantities related to cement displacement namely; the annular volume to be cemented, volume of <b>cement</b> <b>pumped</b> and the resulting height of cement in the annulus. Five successful- and four failed cement jobs (cases) were used to accomplish this study. The analysis (calculations and ontology engineering) of all failed cases was done using excel software. Well schematics for planned and completed cement jobs were also presented for each case to verify the existence of poor cement jobs (for failed cases) and of good cement jobs (for successful cases). Enhanced understanding and knowledge of well cementing operation found through this study is helpful in forecasting similar failures in future cement jobs and hence reduce the failures related to the cement displacement process and the associated costs of remedial jobs...|$|R
40|$|Good shear bonding and {{hydraulic}} bonding between {{cement and}} steel {{play a crucial}} role in well integrity of oil and gas wells. In this experimental study, we investigate the effect that constant electric field may have on the bonding at cement-steel interfaces. Constant voltage (18 V) was applied between two stainless-steel electrodes immersed into a cement slurry. It was found that bonding was significantly improved at the positive electrode, while it was significantly worse at the negative electrode. The effect was due to the negatively-charged cement particles being attracted to the positive electrode. The effect may potentially be used for manipulation and control of casing-cement and reinforcement-concrete bonding strengths in oil & gas and construction industries, respectively. Side-effects that might reduce the applicability of this technology, are gas production at both electrodes (and especially at the negative one) and significant corrosion at the positive electrode due to electrochemical reactions at metal surfaces. Poor bonding at the negative electrode may potentially be used for cleaning of cement equipment, such as <b>cement</b> <b>pumps,</b> pipes, tanks, and mixers used on the rigs to perform well cementing jobs in oil & gas industry...|$|R

40|$|Cementing {{of oil and}} gas wells can be a very {{delicate}} operation. Among the concerns of service companies, during this operation are the nature and conditions of the formations in well. This is the case of cementing operations in southern Algeria, specifically on the fields of In-Amen, where the formations in lost zones are naturally weak and highly permeable. In these areas, drilling fluids (muds and <b>cements)</b> <b>pumped</b> will be, completely or partially lost, what we call "lost circulation". Thixotropic cements are useful to overcome lost circulation problems. They are characterized by a special rheological behavior, allowing it to plug lost zones when they are pumped. Our work aims to assess the thixotropy of cements perapred with two types of cement (class G Asland cement and CEM I 42. 5 portland cement) with the plaster, using a viscometer with coaxial cylinder (couette type). Moreover, the effect of blast furnace slag (LHF) on the properties and thixotropic mixtures prepared was also studied. The results show that portland cement (available locally) can produce mixes with higher and more stable thixotropy than the class G cement (from importation), which is a practical and economical for cementing job operations in wells with loss zones. The results also show that the effect of LHF is positive, since in addition to his contribution to long term performances, especially the durability of hardened concrete, it improves the thixotropy of cement made of plaster. ...|$|R

50|$|After {{a company}} has leased the mineral rights, it must obtain {{a permit to}} drill a well. Permits are {{regulated}} by state agencies and the requirements vary. Once it has obtained the permit, the company clears an area of 4-5 acres for a stage bed; it may also construct roads, a waste water site, and a temporary gas storage facility. Next is the drilling and casing of the well. In a process similar to that for constructing water wells, a bore machine drills vertically in the ground, and two or more steel casings are set in the well in a reverse telescope manner. The casing helps keep the well open by providing structural support and preventing fluid and gas flow into the surrounding ground. Once the casing is in place, <b>cement</b> is <b>pumped</b> down inside the casing and back up {{on the outside of}} the casing.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to {{investigate}} effect of cement slurry consistency toward friction pressure during oil/gas cementing operation. Completion of an oil/gas well has become more important because the reserve has become harder to find. The oil/gas company cannot afford to lose million dollars they spent when locating, drilling and recovering the oil from the Earth if they failed it. The safety, health and environment also have become more important issue, because any completion problem can lead to prolong operation and creating more hazard and risk. Cementing operation plays a very important role during completion because it creates a secure conduit to bring the precious oil/gas to the surface and a place to install completion jewelry. During cementing operation lost circulation can be one of the serious problems that arise. Circulation is said to be lost when the <b>cement</b> slurry <b>pumped</b> flows into one or more geological formations instead of returning up casing annulus. This is due to sum of hydrostatic pressure and friction pressure is exceeding fracture gradient.

40|$|Cementing {{operations}} are {{critical in the}} petroleum industry to isolate formations. Safety, environment impact and the economic success of a project depend on a successful cementing campaign. <b>Cementing</b> involves <b>pumping</b> spacer fluid to displace drilling mud, then cement {{in order to create}} the bond between the casing and formation. It is very rare that the casing is concentric in the borehole; therefore, it is almost always offset, usually to an unknown extent. It is for these reasons that a good knowledge of one fluid displacing another is needed, so that cementing operations may be run with greater certainty. The aim of this work is to build a functional 3 -dimensional CFD model to capture the effects of non-Newtonian fluid displacements in eccentric annuli. Effects such as eccentricity of the well bore and rotation of the inner cylinder and fluid rheology may have large influences on the displacement efficiencies and flow phenomena. The model was run using ANSYS CFX 13. 0 with fluid flow occurring under laminar conditions with negligible mixing between phases. It was found that the model can predict the effects of eccentricity and rotational flows on displacement efficiency and frictional pressure losses. The simulations confirm the experimental observations that rotation of the inner cylinder, even at low speeds, can significantly improve the displacement performance in highly eccentric annuli. Furthermore, for viscoplastic fluids, mild rotational flows lead to decreases in friction losses, which are strongly dependent of the annular eccentricity. N. A. Caruso, Q. D. Nguyen and H.

40|$|When {{oil and gas}} wells {{reach the}} end of their {{production}} life, they need to be permanently plugged and abandoned. The requirements for a permanent barrier state that it must cover the entire cross-section of the wellbore, including all annuli. This thesis evaluates a new method of establishing a cross-sectional barrier in areas with poor, non-sealing annular cement. The traditional method is to mill away the section with poor cement and set an open hole cement plug, but due to the ECD effect of milling fluids, this is not always desirable. In some formations on the Gullfaks field, the operational pressure window is too small for section milling. An alternative solution was therefore tried out on a well that needed plugging. This method, referred to as punch and squeeze, consisted of perforating the section of poorly cemented casing and squeezing cement into the annulus. In this thesis, the equipment and techniques used are presented and evaluated, along with general theory relevant to plugging and abandonment. On Gullfaks, two punch and squeeze techniques were used. In the first, <b>cement</b> was <b>pumped</b> through a packer plug and squeezed into the perforations. The second technique involved setting a balanced cement plug over the perforations, and squeezing this plug into the perforations. The main conclusions are that the technique using a packer plug is safer with regards to well control, involves less waiting on cement and gives a better annular seal than the balanced plug alternative. Also, a cement evaluation log should be run before the squeeze jobs are performed, and the log results should be used when determining where to perforate. All things considered, {{it was found that the}} punch and squeeze method can succeed in creating a length of cross-sectional cement, but still involves some uncertainty and the technique can be further optimized...|$|R

Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references. Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. Free fall is defined as the unrestrained motion of a body, in this case a wellbore fluid, in a gravitational field. It takes place in cementing since the frictional pressure cannot compensate for the hydrostatic pressure difference between casing and annulus. The occurrence of the free fall causes the fluid level to fall below the wellhead and creates void space above the top of the wellbore fluid. Therefore, the wellbore fluid flow rate is no longer in control. A pre-job simulation is needed to check whether the rate schedule and fluid properties are appropriate for successful cementing. An algorithm for modeling this phenomenon during primary cementing has been written. The model assumes piston-like displacement so that there is no transition region at the interface between two fluids. It also assumes incompressible fluids and no fluid loss into the formation. The fluids' properties are considered constant. The wellbore allows multi hole diameter. The model allows for examining the effects of several parameters (annulus restriction, location of annulus restriction, <b>cement</b> properties, <b>pump</b> rate, and annulus clearance). A user interactive simulator of the primary cementing that includes the free fall phenomenon has been developed. It is developed by using Microsoft Visual Basic for Windows, and it can be run on IBM compatible personal computers.
