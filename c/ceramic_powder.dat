In particular, the development of fine <b>ceramic</b> <b>powders</b> with unusual and superior properties will be of great interest. Thermal plasmas with their unique processing capabilities will {{play an important role in}} these developments. High temperature gas-phase chemistry within thermal plasma environments provides an attractive and chemically unspecific route for powder synthesis. Furthermore, the supersaturation of vapor species which provides the driving force for particle condensation can be very large, leading to the production of ultrafine particles by homogeneous nucleation. <b>Ceramic</b> <b>powders</b> such as carbides, nitrides, oxides and solid solutions have been successfully synthesized in thermal plasma reactors based on high intensity arcs, plasma jets and rf inductively coupled discharges. Starting materials are either in the form of gases, liquids or solids. However, the availability of gas phase precursors for metals is severely limited. Therefore, the most commonly used reactants for plasma synthesis are solids. In this case the injection process is not trivial; in fact it is almost an insurmountable problem because of the high viscosity of the plasma. Recently, a liquid injection method has been developed to overcome the problems associated with solid injection and to realize the benefits of gaseous reactants.

In this paper, the oxygen existing forms and the total oxygen content in ZrC and ZrB 2 <b>ceramic</b> <b>powders</b> were measured by oxygen-nitrogen analyzer and X-ray diffraction, respectively. The evolution process of the oxygen element in the synthesis of ZrC and ZrB 2 <b>ceramic</b> <b>powders</b> was analyzed based on the oxygen state in ZrC and ZrB 2 <b>ceramic</b> <b>powders.</b> The total oxygen content was studied by oxygen-nitrogen analyzer, and the oxygen content in zirconium oxides was studied by X-ray diffraction. The grain size and the crystal cell parameters of ZrC and ZrB 2 were determined by X-ray diffraction. Then, the total oxygen content measured by oxygen-nitrogen analyzer, the oxygen content measured by X ray diffraction, and the difference between these two oxygen content values, were compared with the grain size of ZrC and ZrB 2 powders and the crystal cell parameters of nanometer ZrC and ZrB 2 respectively. Results showed that the total oxygen content and the oxygen content in oxides have no significance in relation to the grain size and crystal cell parameters. However, {{the difference between the two}} oxygen content value and the grain size and the crystal cell parameters showed linear correlation between each other. It indicated that part of oxygen element in ZrC and ZrB 2 powders entered the crystal lattice of the sample and existed in the form of solid-solution-oxygen, which have affected the crystal lattices and made the change. So oxygen element in ZrC and ZrB 2 powders existed in forms as not only oxides but also solid-solution. In short, some oxygen element contained in non-oxide ceramics such as ZrC and ZrB 2 <b>ceramic</b> <b>powders</b> can enter the crystal lattice and existed in forms of solid-solution, which in forms that it would help to reduce the oxygen content and get high purity powders by inhibiting the formation of solid solution.  </p...|$|R
