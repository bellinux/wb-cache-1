5|$|As well as {{fighting}} demons, {{the protagonist}} <b>can</b> <b>negotiate</b> {{with them in}} a variety of ways: demons can be bribed, scared away, or recruited depending on responses given during conversation. After they are recruited, different demons can be fused together to create new demons. The new demon inherits skills from its parents, and some demons can only be obtained through fusion. The game includes 300 recruitable demons, all of which take inspiration from various world mythologies including Welsh, Egyptian, Norse, and Christian. Two main alignments govern the way demons must be approached: one that represents light, neutral and dark alignments; and one representing law, neutral and chaos alignments. The choices made in the story also effect how demons respond to player commands, and whether they will remain loyal. As with earlier titles, a Moon Phase divided into eight segments dictates how demons will behave. When the Moon is full, demons will refuse to talk. Fused demons can be shared between players using thirty-two character passwords generated when a new demon is fused. These passwords can be traded between different players.|$|E
5|$|Assisting {{communication}} {{across many}} modern optic fibre networks is a protocol known as Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM). The ATM protocol {{allows for the}} side-by-side data transmission mentioned in the second paragraph. It is suitable for public telephone networks because it establishes a pathway for data through the network and associates a traffic contract with that pathway. The traffic contract is essentially an agreement between the client and the network about how the network is to handle the data; if the network cannot meet {{the conditions of the}} traffic contract it does not accept the connection. This is important because telephone calls <b>can</b> <b>negotiate</b> a contract so as to guarantee themselves a constant bit rate, something that will ensure a caller's voice is not delayed in parts or cut off completely. There are competitors to ATM, such as Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS), that perform a similar task and are expected to supplant ATM in the future.|$|E

25|$|The {{vehicle is}} fully amphibious and <b>can</b> <b>negotiate</b> water {{obstacles}} without any preparation. Two water jet propellers power the vehicle in water, {{and it can}} achieve a maximum speed of 9km/h. It can enter and be deployed from amphibious assault ships from the water. The BTR-90 can be deployed by truck, rail and also by water and air transportation means.|$|E
25|$|Its hydro {{mechanical}} transmission helps {{to increase its}} maneuverability by providing different speeds to {{each side of the}} vehicle. This allows the BTR-90 to have a low turning radius of 6 m. When turning with only the front four wheels, it has a turning radius of 14 m. It can cross up to 2.1 m wide trenches and <b>can</b> <b>negotiate</b> 60% gradients, 30% side slopes and 0.8 m vertical steps.|$|E
25|$|The {{electricity}} {{market in}} Colombia has regulated and non-regulated segments. The regulated market, which is directly contracted and supplied by distribution companies, applies to industrial, commercial, and residential users with power demands under 0.5MW. In this market, the tariff structure is {{established by the}} regulatory agency CREG. In the non-regulated market, consumers with power demands of 0.5 MW and above <b>can</b> <b>negotiate</b> freely and contract their supply in the wholesale market (i.e., spot and contracts markets) directly or through commercial entities, distributors, or producers.|$|E

25|$|Since the boro taxis {{are part}} of the livery services, they are {{associated}} with companies (or bases). The decals of base station name and telephone number are affixed on the rear panel of the vehicle. Customers can call the bases for pre-arranged trips. The passengers for pre-arranged trips <b>can</b> <b>negotiate</b> the price, but can only be picked up in all the outer boroughs (including the airports) and north of the yellow zone in Manhattan. These airport pick-ups by boro taxis are only allowed for pre-arranged trips.|$|E
25|$|Bhushan {{says that}} he envisages a {{transparent}} and honest legal system, where people <b>can</b> <b>negotiate</b> their own cases without the need of any lawyers. In 1990, {{he and his father}} formed the Committee on Judicial Accountability (CJA) to fight corruption in the judiciary. The organisation comprised some lawyers and ex-judges. Prashant Bhushan started focusing more on this issue in 1993, after the Supreme Court Justice V. Ramaswami was not impeached by parliament on corruption charges. In 2007, the Bhushans expanded CJA to include citizens and form the Campaign for Judicial Accountability and Reform (CJAR).|$|E
25|$|Many {{books and}} handouts on FAS {{recommend}} a developmental approach, based on developmental psychology, {{even though most}} do not specify it as such and provide little theoretical background. Optimal human development generally occurs in identifiable stages (e.g., Jean Piaget's theory of cognitive development, Erik Erikson's stages of psychosocial development, John Bowlby's attachment framework, and other developmental stage theories). FAS interferes with normal development, which may cause stages to be delayed, skipped, or immaturely developed. Over time, an unaffected child <b>can</b> <b>negotiate</b> the increasing demands of life by progressing through stages of development normally, but not so for a child with FAS.|$|E

25|$|There are, though, many {{variations}} on the theme and many surprising aspects. For one thing, salticids do not necessarily follow a straight path in approaching prey. They may follow a circuitous course, sometimes even a course that takes the hunter through regions from which the prey is not visible. Such complex adaptive behaviour is hard to reconcile with an organism that has such a tiny brain, but some jumping spiders, in particular some species of Portia, <b>can</b> <b>negotiate</b> long detours from one bush down to the ground, then up the stem of another bush to capture a prey item on a particular leaf. Such behaviour still {{is the subject of}} research.|$|E
25|$|These {{fees are}} {{typically}} from 1 to 6 percent of each sale, but will vary {{not only from}} merchant to merchant (large merchants <b>can</b> <b>negotiate</b> lower rates), but also from card to card, with business cards and rewards cards generally costing the merchants more to process. The interchange fee that applies to a particular transaction is also affected by many other variables including: the type of merchant, the merchant's total card sales volume, the merchant's average transaction amount, whether the cards were physically present, how the information required for the transaction was received, the specific type of card, when the transaction was settled, and the authorized and settled transaction amounts. In some cases, merchants add a surcharge to the credit cards to cover the interchange fee, encouraging their customers to instead use cash, debit cards, or even cheques.|$|E
500|$|The early 1980s {{witnessed}} {{an escalation}} of violence across the country, and many predicted civil war. This {{was accompanied by}} economic stagnation as various multinational banks—under pressure from an international lobby—had stopped investing in South Africa. Numerous banks and Thatcher asked Botha to release Mandela—then {{at the height of}} his international fame—to defuse the volatile situation. Although considering Mandela a dangerous [...] "arch-Marxist", in February 1985 Botha offered him a release from prison if he [...] "unconditionally rejected violence as a political weapon". Mandela spurned the offer, releasing a statement through his daughter Zindzi stating, [...] "What freedom am I being offered while the organisation of the people [...] remains banned? Only free men <b>can</b> <b>negotiate.</b> A prisoner cannot enter into contracts." ...|$|E

500|$|In [...] "Two Swords", Alliser Thorne and Janos Slynt {{call for}} Jon's {{execution}} for defecting to the wildlings, but Maester Aemon is convinced of Jon's {{loyalty to the}} Watch and sets him free. In [...] "First of His Name", Jon leads an expedition to Craster's Keep, where some men of the Watch have mutinied and murdered Lord Commander Mormont. After defeating the mutineers, Jon is reunited with Ghost. Tormund's wildlings attack Castle Black while Mance's army besieges the Wall in [...] "The Watchers on the Wall". The wildlings are successfully repelled, though Ygritte is shot and dies in Jon's arms. Before Jon <b>can</b> <b>negotiate</b> with or kill Mance, Stannis Baratheon's army arrives and routs the wildling camp, taking Mance prisoner in the season finale [...] "The Children".|$|E
500|$|Combat is {{triggered}} through random {{encounters in}} environments such as dungeons. Combat in Nine plays {{out as a}} real-time combat in an enclosed battle arena: while the battle continues automatically without direct interaction from the player, commands can be issued to party members to perform actions when their turn comes. In addition to specific commands, general offensive or defensive stances can be issued. Battles do not reward experience points as in other Megami Tensei games: instead, equipped jewels affect the protagonist's strengths and stats. As with previous Megami Tensei games, players <b>can</b> <b>negotiate</b> with demons {{and get them to}} join their party. Demons can also be fused together to create more powerful demons. The attitudes of demons towards the player changes depending on the current moon phase. The number of demons the player can summon depends on the player's and the demon's [...] "kilodevil" [...] values: a player with 100 kilodevil can summon two 50-kilodevil demons. The player can compress their demons by visiting the Cathedral of Shadows, halving the demons' kilodevil values and allowing the player to summon more demons.|$|E

2500|$|The lack of {{transparency}} {{is often seen}} as a problem for democracy. Politicians <b>can</b> <b>negotiate</b> for regulations {{that would not be}} possible or accepted in a democratic process in their own nations. [...] "Some countries push for certain regulatory standards in international bodies and then bring those regulations home under the requirement of harmonization and the guise of multilateralism." [...] This {{is often referred to as}} Policy Laundering.|$|E
2500|$|A Coasian solution, {{named for}} the {{economist}} Ronald Coase, proposes that potential beneficiaries of a public good <b>can</b> <b>negotiate</b> to pool their resources and create it, based on each party's self-interested willingness to pay. [...] His treatise, [...] "The Problem of Social Cost" [...] (1960), argued that if the transaction costs between potential beneficiaries of a public good are low—that {{it is easy for}} potential beneficiaries to find each other and organize a pooling their resources based upon the good's value to each of them—that public goods could be produced without government action.|$|E
