2500|$|The agreement, {{known as}} Red Line Agreement after a red line was drawn around the former {{boundaries}} of the Ottoman Empire (with the exception of Kuwait), effectively bound the partners to act together within the red line. The writer Stephen Hemsley Longrigg, a former IPC employee, noted, [...] "he Red Line Agreement, variously assessed as a sad case of wrongful cartelization or as an enlightened example of international co‑operation and fair-sharing, was to hold the field for twenty years and in large measure determined the pattern and tempo of oil development over {{a large part of}} the Middle East". The Agreement lasted until 1948 when two of the American partners broke free. During the period, IPC monopolized oil exploration inside the Red Line; excluding Saudi Arabia and Bahrain, where ARAMCO (formed in 1944 by renaming of the Saudi subsidiary of Standard Oil of California (Socal)) and Bahrain Petroleum Company (BAPCO) respectively held <b>controlling</b> <b>position.</b>|$|E

They were supplemented by two additional <b>control</b> <b>positions</b> in the fore-top, which were provided with [...] rangefinders, fitted in 1924–25. The anti-aircraft guns were controlled by a simple high-angle [...] rangefinder mounted on the aft <b>control</b> <b>position,</b> fitted in 1926–27. Three torpedo-control towers were fitted, each with a [...] rangefinder.

40|$|A {{method for}} {{performance}} envelope boundary cueing for a {{vehicle control system}} comprises the steps of formulating a prediction system for a neural network and training the neural network to predict values of limited parameters {{as a function of}} current <b>control</b> <b>positions</b> and current vehicle operating conditions. The method further comprises the steps of applying the neural network to the control system of the vehicle, where the vehicle has capability for measuring current <b>control</b> <b>positions</b> and current vehicle operating conditions. The neural network generates a map of current <b>control</b> <b>positions</b> and vehicle operating conditions versus the limited parameters in a pre-determined vehicle operating condition. The method estimates critical control deflections from the current <b>control</b> <b>positions</b> required to drive the vehicle to a performance envelope boundary. Finally, the method comprises the steps of communicating the critical control deflection to the vehicle control system; and driving the vehicle control system to provide a tactile cue to an operator of the vehicle as the <b>control</b> <b>positions</b> approach the critical control deflections.

500|$|Dreadnought {{was one of}} {{the first}} vessels of the Royal Navy to be fitted with {{instruments}} for electrically transmitting range, order and deflection information to the turrets.

Voice pipes were retained for use between the Transmitting Station and the <b>control</b> <b>positions.</b> The target's data was also graphically recorded on a plotting table to assist the gunnery officer in predicting the movement of the target.

50|$|Posthumanism {{differs from}} {{classical}} humanism by relegating humanity {{back to one}} of many natural species, thereby rejecting any claims founded on anthropocentric dominance.
