Many taco varieties are generally available only {{in the morning or}} afternoon. Tacos most often found in the morning hours include tacos de canasta and those with barbacoa or cabeza de res (lit. beef head). Tacos de canasta (Basket tacos) are the only kind which are not prepared on the spot.

40|$|An {{outbreak}} of Salmonella serotype Thompson in California was identi®ed through labora-tory-based surveillance and investigated with case-control, traceback, and laboratory studies. There were 35 ªsporadicº cases and a restaurant-associated {{outbreak of}} 41 cases with onset between 6 March and 31 March 1999. Three case patients were hospitalized. A case-control study found a signi®cant association between illness and eating cilantro {{at a restaurant}} (63 % of case patients vs. 34 % of control subjects; odds ratio, 3. 5; 95 % con®dence interval, 1. 1 ± 11. 4). Although common distributors of cilantro were identi®ed, inadequate records prohibited the identi®cation of a single farm supplying cilantro. At room temperature, Salmonella Thompson grew more rapidly and to a higher concentration on <b>chopped</b> <b>cilantro,</b> compared with whole-leaf cilantro. Freshly made salsa (pH 3. 4) supported growth of Salmonella Thompson. Cilantro should be served promptly after chopping. Accurate records {{of the distribution of}} produce should be available, and bacterial contamination of produce should be prevented in retail and wholesale establishments, in packing sheds, and on farms. Outbreaks of salmonellosis have recently been associated with unpasteurized orange juice [1], tomatoes [2], cantaloupe [3], and alfalfa sprouts [4]. Cilantro, an herb used in ethnic cooking, is another example of a fresh produce item that has become increasingly popular in the United States.
