5000|$|Dawson {{argued that}} post-1952 {{decisions}} of the Supreme Court such as the two Aro decisions, continued to follow Mercoid and rejected the majority's interpretation of § 271(d). In Aro Mfg. Co. v. <b>Convertible</b> <b>Top</b> Replacement Co. (Aro I), the Court had considered whether Aro's supplying to GM car owners a piece of common fabric cut to fit the contours of a patented <b>convertible</b> <b>top</b> combination, where the owners wanted to replace a worn top, was contributory infringement. Because contributory infringement cannot exist without underlying direct infringement, and the car owners {{had a right to}} keep their cars in good repair, there was no direct infringement and thus no contributory infringement. In so ruling, the Aro Court had quoted passages in Mercoid that said no part of a patented combination, such as the unpatented fabric <b>top</b> of the <b>convertible</b> <b>top</b> combination. was essential or the heart or gist of the invention and therefore separately protectable. The Dawson majority said this ruling was not inconsistent with its interpretation of § 271(d). In Aro Mfg. Co. v. <b>Convertible</b> <b>Top</b> Replacement Co. (Aro II), [...] the same controversy turned to Ford cars that used the <b>convertible</b> <b>top</b> invention but had not been licensed. This time the Aro II majority held that repairing unlicensed cars by supplying new fabric tops was contributory infringement under § 271(c). That, too, the Dawson majority said, was consistent with its interpretation of § 271. Moreover, the Court said, the Aro II majority rejected attempted reliance on Mercoid because [...] "§ 271 was enacted for the express purpose [...] [...] [...] of overruling any blanket invalidation of the infringement doctrine that could be found in the Mercoid opinions." [...] Finally, the Court said, the Aro cases involved repair versus reconstruction, for which the staple-nonstaple distinction is not relevant, the case at bar involved [...] "the primary-use market for a chemical process," [...] in which the staple-nonstaple distinction [...] "supplies the controlling benchmark." ...|$|R
