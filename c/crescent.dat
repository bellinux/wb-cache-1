5|$|According to Ludvík Mucha, {{author of}} Webster's Concise Encyclopedia of Flags & Coats of Arms, the white disk {{located in the}} center of the flag {{represents}} the sun. The red <b>crescent</b> and the five-pointed star, two ancient symbols of Islam, were most notably used on Ottoman flag and have since appeared on many flags of Islamic countries. The <b>crescent</b> is, from the viewpoint of an Arabic observer, supposed to bring good luck. The color red is a symbol of resistance against Turkish supremacy. Whitney Smith states that the <b>crescent</b> was first emblazoned on standards and buildings in the Punic state of Carthage, located in present-day Tunisia. Since appearing on the Ottoman flag, they were widely adopted by Muslim countries, and have become known as symbols of Islam, when in fact, they may be cultural symbols. Likewise, the sun is often represented with the <b>crescent</b> on ancient Punic artifacts and is associated with the ancient Punic religion, especially with Tanit symbol.|$|E

5|$|Did Siletzia pivot {{about its}} {{northern}} end or southern end? This question has attracted considerable attention, {{with the evidence}} now favoring a northern pivot. A key piece of evidence is that the <b>Crescent</b> Formation is laid over sediments (the Blue Mountain unit) derived from the continent, including boulders of quartz diorite some 65 million years old; this requires the <b>Crescent</b> Formation to have formed close to the continent.|$|E

5|$|In July 1999, York's real {{property}} assets, including Bootham <b>Crescent,</b> {{were transferred to}} a holding company called Bootham <b>Crescent</b> Holdings (BCH) for £165,000. Chairman Douglas Craig put {{the ground and the}} club up for sale for £4.5million in December 2001. It was announced that the ground would close by 30 June 2002, and talks were held over a move to Huntington Stadium. In March 2002, the club was bought by John Batchelor; he said York could continue at Bootham <b>Crescent</b> until a new stadium was built, when in fact the previous 25-year lease was replaced with one that would expire in June 2003. Batchelor spoke of building a new stadium at Clifton Moor, and Persimmon, who held 10% of the shares in BCH, submitted planning applications for 93 homes on the site of Bootham <b>Crescent.</b> In March 2003, York extended their lease of the ground to May 2004, and under the ownership of the Supporters' Trust proceeded with plans to move to Huntington Stadium. Planning problems arose with bringing the ground up to Football League standards, and the club preferred to stay at Bootham <b>Crescent.</b> York bought Bootham <b>Crescent</b> in February 2004, after a £2million loan from the Football Stadia Improvement Fund (FSIF) was secured.|$|E

50|$|Chipped stone <b>crescents</b> are a {{class of}} {{artifact}} found mainly associated with surface components of archaeological sites located in the Great Basin, the Columbia Plateau, and throughout California.

[...] The Hulme <b>Crescents</b> had implications for new housing in Manchester and were believed to have signalled the death knell for the 'Streets in the sky' idea that had been proposed throughout the 1960s and 1970s in the United Kingdom.
