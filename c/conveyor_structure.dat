50|$|Although in {{its early}} years under the Port Authority, the {{terminal}} was increasingly successful, it began to decline in the late 1950s, especially after the opening of the St. Lawrence Seaway in 1959 further reduced grain shipments from the Great Lakes to the Port of New York. Labor costs became uncompetitive relative to those of other ports like those of Philadelphia and New Orleans where by 1964, loading grain cost $0.21/ton and $0.15/ton, respectively. By comparison, the same task in New York cost $0.78/ton. The consequences were apparent throughout: in that year New York handled 1.7 million bushels of grain, Philadelphia 26.5 million bushels, and New Orleans 238 million bushels. In 1965, the grain terminal was deactivated. In 1987, the loading pier and <b>conveyor</b> <b>structure</b> were demolished.|$|E
50|$|Externally mounted {{monitoring}} {{technologies are}} also being investigated by the industry. Largely showing mixed results of success, these proposed technologies are mostly research based initiatives. A complexity arises out of detecting specific failing rollers using generalised monitoring technologies such as optic fibre cables or vibration monitoring transducers mounted to the conveyor frame. The general, non-specific nature of these technologies have many issues similar to those encountered with the traditional monitoring aids used by inspection personnel. Acoustic monitors, Infrared cameras and any other technology that does not monitor the rollers in a holistic way, generally fail to accurately predict impending roller failure. This is because conveyor roller failure is multi-modal and is indicated over a variety of failure signals not solely identified using single mode detection systems which are characteristic of optic fibre or vibration transducers mounted to the <b>conveyor</b> <b>structure.</b>|$|E
40|$|Abstract:- Today {{there are}} {{numerous}} active filter circuit solutions employing current or voltage conveyors. There are also a number of current and voltage conveyors of specific types. In {{the initial stages of}} the design they are considered in their idealized form, when their idealized models are used, which are made up of controlled current and voltage sources. To be able to assess whether the proposed structures are or are not suitable, it is necessary to have the possibility of realizing the designed circuits using real components, and also to have, already at the design stage, the most faithful models of real components so that the properties of the filter under consideration can be assessed as early as the design stage and the design of the envisaged filter made as effective as possible. The paper deals with the idea of so-called universal multifunction conveyor, which would enable realizing a certain group of both current and voltage conveyors, thus forming a multipurpose experimental element.

Although steel is the traditional material of choice in the mining industry, and particularly for <b>conveyor</b> support <b>structures,</b> the strength and weight advantages offered by composite materials has prompted this investigation into the feasibility of using composite materials in underground mining <b>conveyor</b> support <b>structures.</b> The {{first phase of the}} project centred on establishing and applying selection criteria for the materials and processes which could be used in such a structure. Key concerns include fire performance, electrical conductivity, cost, availability and manufacturability. Based on these considerations, the project identified a phenolic-glass laminate manufactured using the RTM method (for moulded components) or the pultrusion process (for tube sections) as a possible basis for a composite <b>conveyor</b> support <b>structure.</b> The second phase of the project developed a set of design criteria for the use of composite materials in <b>conveyor</b> support <b>structures</b> and a series of preliminary designs based on current conveyor configurations. After analysing each preliminary design against key design criteria, in particular cost, weight, assembly time, susceptibility to damage and torsional loading, the Linestand Suspended - Beam configuration was selected as the preferred option. The third phase of the project used the findings of the preliminary design analysis and the key design criteria to develop a prototype final design. The prototype design is based on a hybrid style of frame. The majority of the structure is constructed from a custom pultruded beam connected with a composite connection piece, while the interface between the rollers and the frame utilises a steel bracket {{to reduce the risk of}} damage to the composite frame. The final design is 12 kg lighter than the current smaller steel design of similar function.

40|$|Longwall mining has {{historically}} been considered an application for only deep reserves. This {{has changed in the}} recent past as longwall has become competitive with surface mining. Many resources marked for stripping now lie in the domain of longwall. Today, the best longwall mines compete with strip mines operating in even the lowest stripping ratios. Longwall mining has become more widely applicable than it ever {{has been in the past}} and it is now generally considered the method of choice in situations where high levels of coal production are required. But the best way to use longwall mining has become less certain with the opportunities that highwall access provides. Wall-to-wall mining is the use of retreating longwall developed from and retreating toward a highwall. As a surface mine reaches its ultimate highwall, the opportunity for longwall punch mining or wall-to-wall mining is obvious. There are several clear operating advantages to operating a longwall in this way and where highwalls are available, the best economic decision will generally favor planning a direct approach. Yet wall-to-wall is not applicable in every situation even when highwalls are available. Moreover, the advantages of wall-to-wall mining do not always justify the cost of trenching or box cuts to access coal. However, many tactical advantages of operating from the highwall can be realized with the use of specially equipped blind drilled or raised bored shafts. This paper discusses novel techniques for a shaft assisted mining system which permits the addition of <b>conveyor</b> <b>structure</b> and mine systems from the surface to the face for advance and retreat mining with longwall, shortwall or room and pillar panels...|$|E
40|$|M. Ing. (Engineering Management) In {{a tender}} bid to energy and {{chemical}} company Sasol, {{a request to}} offer a technical solution for a two-flight overland conveyor system whose function is to transport coal from a 15 000 tonne bunker into an external stockpile storage facility in the plant was made. This conveyor consisted of two conveyor flight sections of lengths 18 423 m and 8 537 m each. The prospect of combining the two flights of conveyors to form one, super-efficient <b>conveyor</b> <b>structure</b> with additional cost saving benefits was identified. It was found that this occurrence was not unique to the individual project as other researching engineers have been faced with similar problems before [18]. This then lead the researcher into believing {{that there could be}} some advantage in investigating the possible benefits to the overall cost, maintainability and scheduling of the fabrication and erection activities for the entire project of combining the multiple flight conveyors into a single-flight conveyor. It is also the conviction of the researcher that the achieved outcomes will prove beneficial to the bulk materials handling industry as a whole. The problem is traditionally short, multiple flight conveyors have always been used for performing the function of transporting bulk material from one location in a mining plant to another hence; long, single-flight overland conveyors of lengths exceeding 26 km have not been commonly installed. In this dissertation the possibility of employing a single-flight overland as opposed to a two-flight conveyor in the Sasol Impumelelo coal plant is investigated. This is done against the work of other researchers who have conducted similar studies in the field as well as by utilizing project-specific data using applicable industry standards as well as Engineering Management course theory. By employing actual project procurement and engineering design data; the investigation is done by calculating and comparing the individual capital and operational costs that encompass the total cost of ownership (TCO) for both conveyor systems as well as the two systems’ reliability, availability and maintainability to establish each system’s complete life cycle costs. It is the opinion of the researcher that the investigation method is valid as it is in line with the guidelines given by The Miami University of Ohio [24] as well as J Hanek [25] and thus provides the researcher with a plausible technique for establishing which between the single-flight overland conveyor and two-flight overland conveyor configurations is overall the more superior system to install. It was found that even though its initial capital and operational costs are higher; the single-flight conveyor system is more reliable, readily available and cheaper to run and sustain over the 30 year expected life-span of the plant. It also is less labour intensive to perform maintenance on, yields less material degradation and results in less material spillage because of the elimination of additional transfer points and transfer towers. These results can be taken as valid on a global scale, for any mining plant, not restricted to any specific material as they are not subject to South African temperature, altitude or seismic conditions nor are they constrained to the type of bulk material being mined...|$|E

In {{the last}} years, current mode {{circuits}} and current mode circuit elements like current conveyors {{have been subject}} to many studies. Interest on current mode circuit elements increases every passing day because of their better linearity and wider bandwidth than the voltage mode circuit elements. In the same way, current mode filters also provide wider dynamic ranges and wider bandwidths than the similar voltage mode filters. Furthermore, current mode filters give better possibilities to build high order filters or oscilators by use of cascade filter connections because of their low input impedances and high output impedances. Current <b>Conveyor</b> <b>structure</b> (Current Conveyor, CC) was first introduced in 1968 by Smith and Sedra and it took an important place in our lives as an important new circuit element. Definition relations of the current conveyor generations are includes very small but important differences. Sedra and Smith introduced “Second Generation Current Conveyor” with changes made in definition relations two years later in 1970. And the last member of the generations "Third Generation Current Conveyor (CCIII) " is presented by Fabre in 1995. In this study, the overall structures of each generation current conveyor is mentioned, the structure of the way it works, the definition of relations have been introduced.

Silo sanitation was done by washing with pressurized water the <b>conveyor</b> belt <b>structure</b> above the silo roof, around the externals walls and thorough aspiration of the aeration system.

The grain mass temperature stabilized at about 12 - 14 ºC, and kept this range of temperature for about 60 d. As the temperature of the grain mass increased, mainly on the top layer, aeration was performed with natural air from the cold fronts during the winter months.

40|$|Due {{to aging}} and corrosion, {{large number of}} belt <b>conveyor</b> support <b>structures</b> in {{industrial}} plants has degraded over the past decades. These structures are in damage condition and may cause human injury or death and economy impacts as several structural accidents of belt conveyors {{have been reported in}} Japan and overseas which caused the operation of factories to stop. Therefore, structural condition assessment of these structures is urgent. To overcome the problems of global vibration modes in damage identification (i. e. need of before-and-after comparison, incapable to be applied for structures with large number of damaged elements, considering effects of non-structural elements and environmental conditions), new damage identification methods are proposed based on two specific local vibration modes named Periodic Local Vibration Modes (PLVM) and Isolated Local Vibration Modes (ILVM). These modes are distinguished from other types of local vibration modes. PLVM is a mode in which vibrations of one group of the identical secondary members are much larger than the other members. The idea in damage identification is when one of these identical members is damaged, this member no longer vibrates in PLVM, instead, it has ILVM in a lower frequency. Numerical and experimental results show that PLVM and ILVM are better observed when each secondary member is directly hit. As an alternative method to easily observe PLVM, one of the undamaged members in each identical members set can be hit. By hitting one of the undamaged members in each identical members set, damaged secondary members of the identical members set are localized and the relative severity of damage is identified by comparing PLVM amplitude in the corresponding PLVM range. The existence of PLVM and ILVM in systems consisting of main and secondary members is investigated using mass-spring system. A 3 -DOF system including coupler, main, and secondary members is considered and mode localization phenomenon is mathematically explained. Then, a more complicated lamped mass-spring system which has 21 -DOF is compared with a finite element model of the support structure of a belt-conveyor to find a correspondence between these two models and the existence condition of PLVM and ILVM is numerically discussed. It is found that when main members are much stiffer than secondary members, PLVM and ILVM of secondary members exist and their frequencies are nearly the same as natural frequencies of the corresponding secondary members. Next, the method based on global vibration modes and two damage identification methods based on PLVM and ILVM frequencies comparison and PLVM amplitude comparison are utilized to identify damaged members of a finite element model of the support structure of a typical belt conveyor. Then, based on the sensitivity analyses of frequencies of PLVM and ILVM which show that the appropriate parameters in damage quantification of secondary members are the local internal connections and the properties of the corresponding member, beam theory and its applicability on the quantification of damage degree are discussed and the stiffness of local boundary conditions and the stiffness reduction of damaged members are reliably identified. Likewise, the two damage identification techniques based on PLVM and ILVM are examined for two laboratory models. One has continuous longitudinal members and the other has separated longitudinal members. The method is applicable for all secondary members (i. e. diagonal and lateral members) of the structure with continuous main members, and all damaged and undamaged members almost vibrate in their own natural frequencies; yet, these damage identification methods cannot identify the damaged lateral members of the structure with non-continuous main members since coupling of modes happens for these members. The reason {{is due to the fact}} that the stiffness of the main members is not much larger than the lateral members and no other secondary member is attached to one of the connections of each lateral member. The existence of PLVM and ILVM of the secondary members of a planar full-scale model of a belt conveyor is investigated and the damaged members are identified using the method based on PLVM and ILVM frequencies comparison. Finally, using the method based on PLVM and ILVM frequencies comparison, damaged secondary members of a real belt-conveyor are correctly localized and using beam theory, the equivalent damage degree is quantified for each damaged member while each member is directly hit and the method is experimentally verified. Moreover, using the damage identification method based on PLVM amplitude comparison, the damaged secondary members are localized and the relative severity of the damage is correctly identified. In conclusion, damage identification techniques to identify damages on belt <b>conveyor</b> support <b>structures</b> utilizing local vibration modes taking advantage of the non-contact measurement device have been proposed. These techniques are capable of identifying multiple damages on a structure without the need of before-and-after comparison. The Laser Doppler Vibrometer allows a quick assessment of damages. The applicability to belt conveyors is confirmed through numerical and experimental verifications. Further studies on criteria to distinguish local vibration modes and on the applicability to structures of other types such as truss bridges and towers are considered to advance the techniques toward their full-fledged use. 報告番号:; 学位授与年月日: 2012 - 09 - 27; 学位の種別: 課程博士; 学位の種類: 博士(工学); 学位記番号:; 研究科・専攻: 工学系研究科社会基盤学専...|$|R
