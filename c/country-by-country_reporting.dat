50|$|The Coalition advocates {{around six}} policy areas for greater {{financial}} transparency - public <b>country-by-country</b> <b>reporting</b> of sales, profits, and taxes paid by multinational corporations; public registers of beneficial ownership of business entities; automatic cross-border exchange of tax information; open data; {{ensuring that the}} institutions making international standards are equitable; holding the enablers of illicit financial flows accountable.|$|E
50|$|Although {{transfer}} pricing is sometimes inaccurately presented by commentators {{as a tax}} avoidance practice or technique, the term refers {{to a set of}} substantive and administrative regulatory requirements imposed by governments on certain taxpayers. However, aggressive intragroup pricing - especially for debt and intangibles - has {{played a major role in}} corporate tax avoidance, and it was one of the issues identified when the OECD released its base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS) action plan in 2013. The OECD’s 2015 final BEPS reports called for <b>country-by-country</b> <b>reporting</b> and stricter rules for transfers of risk and intangibles but recommended continued adherence to the arm’s-length principle. These recommendations have been criticized by many taxpayers and professional service firms for departing from established principles and by some academics and advocacy groups for failing to make adequate changes.|$|E

5000|$|In 2015, many of Murphy's {{ideas were}} taken up as {{proposed}} policies by Jeremy Corbyn, who subsequently became Leader of the Labour Party and Leader of the Opposition. These ideas helped {{to form the}} body of policies that was dubbed [...] "Corbynomics". This included so-called People's Quantitative Easing. - a broader development of a policy Murphy launched in 2010, called Green Quantitative Easing, and later the Green New Deal. Corbyn also cited Murphy's estimate of there being £120 billion of missing tax revenue {{as part of the}} economic plan issued during his election campaign stating that this was enough to [...] "double the NHS budget". In addition, Corbyn adopted several of the remedies that Murphy has advocated (including <b>country-by-country</b> <b>reporting)</b> to address this revenue gap. Murphy later clarified that in his view not all of the missing revenue was [...] "recoverable", and that [...] "at best" [...] £20 billion of it could be collected.|$|E
50|$|On 12 February 2015, the European Parliament set up {{a special}} {{committee}} on tax rulings in the European Union Member States. The committee is composed of 45 members and initially had six months to report its findings. This special committee was preferred to a committee of inquiry which would have implied a higher power of inquiry. This choice is considered by some parliamentarians as a political willingness not to embarrass Jean-Claude Juncker. In the context of its investigations, the special committee requested information to the Commission and Member States, it commissioned research briefings, held public hearings and Committee’s delegations visited several countries in Europe. The Committee faced multinational corporations’ unwillingness to testimony. On 26 October 2015, the committee published {{at the end of}} its mandate a report with several recommendations: <b>country-by-country</b> <b>reporting</b> of multinationals' activities; introducing Common Consolidated Corporate Tax Base (CCTB) in Europe; including the European Commission into the tax rulings automatic information sharing; better protection for whistleblowers. At the end of November 2015, the report was approved by the European Parliament in a plenary session vote.|$|E
40|$|Increasing {{transparency}} in the European Union: developments of <b>Country-by-Country</b> <b>Reporting</b> The {{aim of the}} paper is to bring closer <b>Country-by-Country</b> <b>Reporting</b> and outline possible future amendments of the introduced anti-tax avoidance measures. The article presents the motives of implementing the international CbC initiative, aimed at increasing transparency of the biggest multinational enterprises, with particular emphasis on the specificity of the European Union. Part 2 of the paper analyses the Euro-pean legal bases for companies’ financial reporting. It also gives {{an overview of the}} main findings of Directive 2016 / 881, which implements <b>Country-by-Country</b> <b>Reporting</b> and allows for the exchange of information between tax authorities. Part 3 deals with the national perspective, presenting the CbC solu-tions implemented to the Polish legal system; the paper also attempts to assess the potential impact of tax information disclosures, both from the perspective of taxpayers and the tax administration. The final part presents conclusions and tries to draft future developments of the <b>Country-by-Country</b> <b>Reporting</b> system. In the paper, the following research methods have been used: critical analysis and deduction, with partic-ular reference to the source materials and legal acts, as well as the reports of the European Commission, consulting companies, and NGOs. Although the article deals with tax matters, CbC Reporting is an im-portant and relevant issue {{from the point of view}} of researchers and accounting specialists. Reporting this phenomenon is part of the accounting science as a universal tool for recording economic phenomena. The author examined all relevant sources and took into account all important factors in order to obtain a com-prehensive picture of CbC Reporting and to prepare a paper that may serve as a reference for future research...|$|E
40|$|The {{state of}} freedom {{declined}} {{for the eighth}} consecutive year in 2013, according to Freedom in the World 2014, Freedom House's annual <b>country-by-country</b> <b>report</b> on global political rights and civil liberties. Particularly notable were developments in Egypt, which endured across-the-board reversals in its democratic institutions following a military coup. There were also serious setbacks to democratic rights in other large, politically influential countries, including Russia, Ukraine, Azerbaijan, Turkey, Venezuela, and Indonesia. Findings of the 41 st edition of Freedom in the World, the oldest, most authoritative report of democracy and human rights, include: Fifty-four countries showed overall declines in political rights and civil liberties, compared with 40 that showed gains. For the eighth consecutive year, Freedom in the World recorded more declines in democracy worldwide than gains. Some leaders effectively relied on "modern authoritarianism," crippling their political opposition without annihilating it, and flouting {{the rule of law}} while maintaining a veneer of order, legitimacy, and prosperity. Central to modern authoritarians is the capture of institutions that undergird political pluralism. They seek to dominate not only the executive and legislative branches, but also the media, judiciary, civil society, economy, and security forces. There were some positive signs for the year: Civil liberties improved in Tunisia, the most promising of the Arab Spring countries. Pakistan showed gains due to successful elections and an orderly rotation of power. In Africa, gains occurred in Mali, Côte d'Ivoire, Senegal, Madagascar, Rwanda, Togo, and Zimbabwe.

40|$|Australia has {{recently}} introduced {{what is known}} as <b>country-by-country</b> (CbC) <b>reporting.</b> CbC reporting will require certain multinationals to provide reports to the Australian Tax Office outlining their global financial activities. The introduction of CbC reporting {{is a result of the}} OECD’s recommendations on Action 13 of the Base Erosion and Profit Shifting program. Despite its introduction, civil society groups, international organisations and businesses lack consensus as to the objective and scope of CbC reporting. This article utilises the extractives industry as a case study and then critically assesses the contradictory academic findings and views as to the objective and scope of CbC reporting. Using stakeholder theory, this article argues that a comprehensive CbC reporting framework should assist the numerous information users who engage with a multinational entity, whilst concurrently ensuring a multinational entity can be held accountable to those impacted by its business operations.   ...|$|R

40|$|This paper unravels how Publish What You Pay (PWYP), a {{transnational}} {{social movement}} organisation campaigning for transparency reporting in the extractive sector {{to improve the}} lives of women, men and children in resource-rich countries, successfully mobilised emancipatory accounting change in the context of globalisation. Social movement theory helps explain how PWYP used political opportunity structures available in the International Accounting Standards Board's (IASB) due process, in an attempt to persuade IASB to adopt [a form of] <b>country-by-country</b> <b>reporting</b> for transnational extractive companies. Locating the research on the political and publicised struggle surrounding IASB's adoption of International Financial Reporting Standard (IFRS) 8 - Operating Segments, the research finds PWYP was unsuccessful in persuading IASB to adopt <b>country-by-country</b> <b>reporting.</b> Despite this setback, and assisted by the unfolding drama of the global financial crisis, PWYP's capacity to frame arguments, form alliances, evolve tactics and shift the target of its agency in response to institutional dynamics, meant they were ultimately successful in innovating, diffusing and instituting [a form of] mandatory <b>country-by-country</b> <b>reporting</b> in Europe and beyond. Such incremental emancipatory accounting change evidences a shift in the balance of power over accounting's processual development away from IASB and neoliberal hegemonic forces. The findings of this research lend substance to Gallhofer and Haslam's (2007) rescuing critique of constructing an international emancipatory accounting, emerging from globalisation's embedded conflicts, consistent with their (2006) post-Marxist thesis of 'continuum thinking orientated through struggle' (p. 910) ...|$|E

40|$|Through {{its central}} homepage, FAO now organises and {{disseminates}} its 40 independent databases on agriculture, fisheries and forestry on internet. This virtual information point is called WAICENT (the World Agriculture Information Centre). The website is basically built around three major components. FAOINFO is {{the gateway to}} multimedia information such as FAO's photo and video archive, and a microfiche-based archive of a large agricultural library and bibliographic databases. The second, FAOSTAT contains data on demography, agriculture, fisheries and forestry for 210 countries and territories. The third component, FAOSIS, covers highly specialised information systems. It includes the global information and early warning system, which provides up-to-date reports on global crop production, markets and regional and <b>country-by-country</b> situation <b>reports.</b> Another element in FAOSIS is the Emergency Prevention System, which provides data for transboundary animal and plant pests and diseases. The site is viewable in Arabic, English, French and Spanish.

40|$|The article {{consists}} of two parts. The first is the update of constitutional transformation in the region experiencing the retreat from communism. The organization of this part requires some explanation. The part breaks down into two separate chapters on constitution-drafting in former Soviet Republics and in the new democracies of East-Central Europe. As the former Soviet republics existed within the same statehood {{until the end of}} 1991, it seemed appropriate to assemble comments on political developments in the former U. S. S. R in one subchapter examining the end of Gorbachev 2 ̆ 7 s era and the process of the establishment of the Commonwealth of Independent States. The country-by-country discussion which follows is limited to the examination of the process of constitutional-drafting in several former Soviet Republics. The comments on the constitutional drafts were organized around several more important issues such as the distribution of powers, the inclination to adopt features of presidential or parliamentary systems, constitutional enforcement, and the flexibility of the constitutional provisions. The subchapter on Constitution Drafting in Former Socialist States of East-Central Europe has a slightly different organization. It focuses exclusively on individual countries of post-socialist Europe with the exception of Yugoslavia where the unstable political situation {{at the time of this}} writing does not allow any mature evaluation of a future constitutional system. With all similarities linked to common socialist legacies, the former European Peoples Democracies each had their own statehood and more recently have faced different cultural, religious, economic and ethnic problems. It seemed more appropriate to examine their post-communist traumas separately. Thus, each country-by-country section of this subchapter splits into a short report on political developments and a commentary on the process of constitution-drafting. The reader who is looking for an explanation of the references made in Part I to French, German or other constitutional models will find them presented in Part II on a more detailed basis. Being more theoretical than Part I of the article, Part II reviews the major constitutional controversies of the post-communist world against the background of deeply-rooted Western constitutional ideas. The primary aim of the second part of this article is to analyze the fabric of the new constitutions. This part focuses on the issues which proved to be most controversial during the process of constitution drafting in East-Central Europe, such as the description of the state in economic, political and cultural terms; the selection of the form of government; the concepts of the division of powers; the review of the constitutionality of laws; and the idea of a constitution being rigid or flexible. Although a long and exhaustive bill of rights can be found in all new constitutions and constitutional drafts, a more detailed analysis has to be based on the examination of the actual record of these countries in human rights protection. This task was left for a separate study. Finally, based on the information collected from the <b>country-by-country</b> <b>reports,</b> Part II also supplies observations on the process of forming a new constitutional model in the region of former communist dominance...|$|R
40|$|Was kennzeichnet erfolgreiche transnationale Advocacy in der EU? Unter welchen Bedingungen können {{international}} vernetzte zivilgesellschaftliche Gruppen die europäische Gesetzgebung beeinflussen? Diesen Fragen wird in der vorliegenden Arbeit mit Blick auf die finanziellen Transparenzpflichten internationaler Konzerne nachgegangen. Es wird argumentiert, dass es dem untersuchten Netzwerk gelungen ist, Fragen der internationalen Finanzberichterstattung als Fragen der globalen Steuergerechtigkeit und der Korruptionsbekämpfung zu politisieren mit dem Ergebnis, dass zunächst in den USA und anschließend in der EU legislative Initiativen ergriffen worden sind, um in einigen Sektoren länder- und projektbasierte finanzielle Berichterstattung zu etablieren. Der Fall verdeutlicht somit, welche Mehrebenen-Strategien zivilgesellschaftliche Netzwerke im europäischen und internationalen Kontext verfolgen und lässt Rückschlüsse darauf zu, unter welchen Bedingungen sie die internationale Diffusion von Normen und bestimmter Gesetzgebung beschleunigen können. What characterizes successful transnational advocacy {{work in the}} EU context? Under {{what conditions}} may international civil society networks influence European legislative processes? To answer these questions this article {{tells the story of}} an advocacy network in the field of corporate financial reporting. It is argued that the network's members succeeded in putting the issue on the U.

Hence, the case illustrates what kinds of multi-level strategies are being used by civil society networks in the European and international arenas, thereby allowing for conclusions in terms of the international diffusion of norms and policies and regarding the question under what conditions civil society networks may be able to catalyse these processes...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the issue of}} profit shifting and ‘aggressive’ tax planning by multinational firms. The paper makes two contributions. Firstly, we provide some background information to the debate by giving a brief overview over existing empirical studies on profit shifting and by describing arrangements for IP-based profit shifting which are used by the companies currently accused of avoiding taxes. We then show that preventing this type of tax avoidance is, in principle, straightforward. Secondly, we argue that, in the short term, policy makers should focus on extending withholding taxes in an internationally coordinated way. Other measures which are currently being discussed, in particular unilateral measures like limitations on interest and license deduction, fundamental reforms of the international tax system and <b>country-by-country</b> <b>reporting,</b> are either economically harmful or need to be elaborated much further before their introduction can be considered...|$|E
40|$|Native to Asia, Harmonia axyridis (Pallas) (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae) is {{considered}} an invasive alien ladybird in Europe and North America, where it was widely introduced as a biological control agent of aphids and coccids. In Europe, H. axyridis was sold by various biological control companies from 1995 in France, Belgium and the Netherlands, and was also intentionally released in at least nine other countries. It has spread very rapidly, particularly since 2002, and is now regarded as established in thirteen European countries. The established range extends from Denmark in the north to southern France in the south, and from Czech Republic in the east to Great Britain in the west. In this paper we map the spread and distribution of H. axyridis in Europe, and examine the situation on a <b>country-by-country</b> basis. We <b>report</b> first records of the species in five countries; Spain, Sweden, Denmark, Czech Republic and Italy; and first evidence of H. axyridis establishment in the latter three countries. Despite releases of H. axyridis in Portugal, Spain and Greece, {{there is little evidence}} of establishment in southern Europe. It is predicted that the spread and increase within Europe will continue and that H. axyridis will {{become one of the most}} widely distributed coccinellids in the continent...|$|R
40|$|We {{study the}} {{relationship}} between major religious denominations and individuals' levels of education, using the World Values Survey. In a first step, running <b>country-by-country</b> regressions, we <b>report</b> first-time evidence that no single denomination has a universal effect on education. Each denomination has a positive and statistically significant effect in some countries, a negative and statistically significant effect in others, and a statistically insignificant effect elsewhere. In a second step, we relate {{the sign of the}} impact of a denomination in a country to whether the denomination is a minority in that country. We find that denominations that are a minority in a country {{are more likely to be}} associated with a higher level of education, and less likely to be associated with a lower level of education in that country. In both steps, the findings are independent from the specification of the regressions used in the first stage to determine the sign of the impact of denominations on educational outcomes. The finding of the second step is moreover robust to defining minority denominations using various thresholds. It is robust to controlling for whether the denomination is a state religion, for the country's level of democracy, per capita GDP, or level of education, to introducing denomination- and country- fixed effects, and to controlling for the identity of the largest other denomination in the country...|$|R
40|$|Without {{a stable}} and {{adequate}} tax base, countries lose the financial capacity to provide the infrastructure, social services and development opportunities important to their citizens. In response, the G 20 and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) organized the project on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS). Much of the project {{has been focused on}} substantive law — the rules and practices that can allow the tax base of a country to be eroded and profits to be shifted out of the country. But the project recognizes that improved substantive tax rules alone are not sufficient to guarantee the tax base of a country. Without adequate transparency and disclosure of tax information to the taxing authorities, even the most carefully designed substantive tax rules will fail to protect the base. This chapter explores both the existing mechanisms for transparency and disclosure, and the new developments including <b>country-by-country</b> <b>reporting,</b> automatic exchange of information, beneficial ownership registries, and government exchanges. The primary focus of the analysis is understanding how these various regimes may impact developing countries...|$|E
40|$|Transparency {{represents}} today a {{key issue}} on the agendas of international and domestic tax policy makers. Improving the access and the exchange of relevant tax information and removing existing bank and tax secrecy regimes is currently seen as the most effective tool, together with the identification of harmful tax regimes and practices, to counter both tax evasion and harmful or aggressive tax competition. Action item 13 of the BEPS Action Plan suggests to reform {{the structure of the}} transfer pricing documentation and introduce a new reporting requirement {{in the form of a}} countryby-country reporting template. Although such new reporting requirement is meant to provide an informative tool for the up-front identification of transfer pricing risks within the group, its unexpected area of application may become the improvement of the global acceptance of the formulary apportionment idea for the allocation of multinational enterprises’ profits. This article aims to provide a critical review of the proposed template and assess its potential in reviving the debate on formulary apportionment.

40|$|Aggressive tax {{planning}} efforts of highly profitable multinational companies (Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS)) have recently become {{the subject of}} intense public debate. As a response, several international initiatives and parties have called for more transparency in financial reporting, especially {{by means of a}} country-specific reporting of certain tax information (<b>Country-by-Country</b> <b>Reporting</b> (CbCR)). In our paper, we demonstrate that neither consolidated nor individual financial accounts seem to be an appropriate platform to provide such country-specific information and, therefore, that CbCR cannot be based on extended financial accounting standards. Moreover, we argue that even separate CbCR templates do not prevent multinationals from profit shifting, since their common tax minimization strategies are mainly based on the legal exploitation of gaps and loopholes in national and international tax law. In that regard, we show that expected costs for CbCR would exceed expected benefits and therefore contend that CbCR cannot be regarded as a convincing measure to combat international profit shifting. Instead, we argue that tax legislators should limit profit shifting by enforcing national and international tax rules and by closing gaps in tax law. In particular, we call for more tightened and standardized transfer pricing regulations to be adopted at an international level...|$|E
40|$|Transfer pricing (TP) {{outcomes}} of the base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS) project have been generally accepted as positive and embraced by the Australian government and Australia’s tax authority, the Australian Taxation Office (ATO). Reporting {{in the form of}} <b>country-by-country</b> <b>reporting,</b> consistent with OECD recommendations in Action 13 of the October 2015 OECD final BEPS report was implemented in December 2015 and, on 3 May 2016, the government announced its intention to amend Australia’s new TP rules to give effect to the TP recommendations in Actions 8 – 10 of the October 2015 OECD final BEPS report. The amendments were announced to apply from 1 July 2016. The domestic political environment is also having a significant impact on how BEPS is perceived in Australia, not least of all because of the Senate Economics References Committee inquiry into corporate tax avoidance. This inquiry was referred to the committee on 2 October 2014 and it was originally due to report in June 2015. Since then, the committee’s due date for reporting has been extended six times and it is now due to report by the end of September 2017.

40|$|Tax havens and tax {{avoidance}} have gathered much interest, e. g., in the United Nations (UN) {{negotiations on the}} post- 2015 development goals. The analyses of initiatives against corporate {{tax avoidance}} typically focus on developments from the mid- 1990 s onward. This article shows that contrary to the common perception, the <b>country-by-country</b> <b>reporting</b> initiative {{and many of the}} other contemporary policy responses had already been developed and discussed in the 1970 s by the United Nations Commission and Centre for Transnational Corporations. I demonstrate how the weakening of the policy community of the UN and the failure of the Organisation of Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) to refer to the earlier discussions, not only in the UN but also in the OECD, contributed to the passing into oblivion of these ideas. Other factors were the reframing of the UN work on multinational enterprises to human rights issues and the transformation of academic theories of the firm. The examples demonstrate how ideas shape world politics and how the oblivion of certain ideas can have concrete impacts on the power relations between its actors. The oblivion of the earlier debates {{paved the way for the}} triumph of more business-friendly discourses centred on the anti-corruption and corporate social responsibility arguments...|$|E
40|$|Aggressive tax {{planning}} efforts of highly profitable multinational companies (Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS)) {{have become the}} subject of intense public debate in recent years. As a response, several international initiatives and parties have called for more transparency in financial reporting, especially {{by means of a}} <b>Country-by-Country</b> <b>Reporting</b> (CbCR). In line with that, the OECD and the European Commission have recently presented proposals for a comprehensive disclosure of country-specific tax -related information for companies in all industry sectors. In our paper, we demonstrate that neither consolidated or individual financial statements nor other existing data sources seem to be an appropriate basis for providing such country-specific information. Instead, it would be necessary to define detailed and harmonized definitions and regulations to ensure comparability. The discussion on benefits and costs of a CbCR reveals that benefits (at least partially) lack a theoretical foundation and, overall, do not seem to outweigh associated costs. This holds true, in particular, since current {{tax planning}} activities are mainly based on the legal exploitation of gaps and loopholes in national and international tax law. Instead, we argue that tax legislators should limit profit shiting by enforcing tax rules and by closing gaps in tax law.

40|$|In February 2013, the OECD {{published}} {{a report on}} its findings concerning base erosion and profit shifting ("BEPS"). 1 That report, in particular Action Plan 13, dealt with the re-examination of transfer pricing documentation wherein the shifting of profits to lower tax rate jurisdictions is addressed. The OECD proposed a Country-by-Country ("CbC") methodology whereby certain information is required to be disclosed within a <b>Country-by-Country</b> <b>Reporting</b> Template ("the CbC Template"). The main purpose of the CbC Template is to assist tax administrations to identify risks related to base erosion and profit shifting; also, and where applicable, data collected via the CbC Template {{can be used for}} economic and statistical analysis. The OECD is of the view that the CbC Template in assisting tax administrators to determine transfer pricing risk, will serve as a high-level risk assessment indicator for transfer pricing. Accordingly, the main aim of the CbC Template is to be a tool for tax administrators to identify and consequently ensure that the revenue of a country is not eroded unfairly.
