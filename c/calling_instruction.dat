50|$|In the IBM System/360 {{mainframe}} family, a Supervisor <b>Call</b> <b>instruction</b> implements {{a system}} call for legacy facilities; the Program <b>Call</b> (PC) <b>instruction</b> {{is used for}} newer facilities. In particular, PC is used when the caller might be in SRB mode.|$|R
50|$|The prologue will {{commonly}} {{save the}} return address {{left in a}} register by the <b>call</b> <b>instruction</b> by pushing the value onto the call stack. Similarly, the current stack pointer and/or frame pointer values may be pushed. Alternatively, some instruction set architectures automatically provide comparable functionality {{as part of the}} action of the <b>call</b> <b>instruction</b> itself, and in such an environment the prologue need not do this.|$|R

50|$|Trampolines: Many CPUs have smaller {{subroutine}} <b>call</b> <b>instructions</b> {{to access}} low memory. A compiler can save space by using these small {{calls in the}} main body of code.

50|$|Another approach, {{taken by}} kBouncer, modifies the {{operating}} system to verify that return instructions actually divert control flow back to a location immediately following a <b>call</b> <b>instruction.</b> This prevents gadget chaining, but carries a heavy performance penalty, and is not effective against jump-oriented programming attacks which alter jumps and other control-flow-modifying instructions instead of returns.|$|R

40|$|Gaining {{the code}} re-use {{advantages}} of {{object oriented programming}} requires dynamic function binding, which allows a new subclass to override a function of a superclass. Dynamic binding is obtained in C++ {{through the use of}} virtual functions. Unfortunately, virtual functions have two negative impacts on performance. First, they are traditionally compiled into indirect <b>call</b> <b>instructions,</b> which take longer to execute than direct <b>call</b> <b>instructions.</b> Second, it is difficult for the compiler to perform optimization since summary information from called procedures is hard or even impossible to obtain. The net effect is that C++ programmers avoid the use of virtual functions. We present a new optimization that (1) removes the indirect function calls used for virtual functions, (2) enables other compiler optimizations such as inlining and constant propagation, and (3) requires no extensive dataflow analysis or profile information and thus is easily implemented in an existing compiler.

50|$|In {{computer}} science, {{the term}} threaded code {{refers to a}} programming technique where the code has a form that essentially consists entirely of calls to subroutines.

40|$|Code {{injection}} {{attacks are}} a top threat to today's Internet. With zero-day {{attacks on the}} rise, randomization techniques have been introduced to diversify software and operation systems of networked hosts so that attacks that succeed on one process or one host cannot succeed on others. Two most notable system-wide random-ization techniques are Instruction Set Randomization (ISR) and Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR). The former randomizes instruction set for each process, while the latter randomizes the memory address space layout. Both suffer {{from a number of}} attacks. In this paper, we advocate and demonstrate that by combining ISR and ASLR effectively, we can offer much more robust protection than each of them individually. However, trivial combination of both schemes is not sufcient. To this end, we make the key observation that system <b>call</b> <b>instructions</b> matter the most to attackers for code injection. Our system, RandSys, uses system <b>call</b> <b>instruction</b> randomization and the general technique of ASLR along with a number of new enhancements to thwart code injection attacks. We have built a prototype for both Linux and Windows platforms. Our experiments show that RandSys can effectively thwart a wide variety of code injection attacks with a small overhead...|$|R
