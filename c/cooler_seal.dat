40|$|A {{method for}} making a glass-to-metal seal is described. A domed metal {{enclosure}} having a machined seal ring is fitted to a glass post machined to a slight taper and to a desired surface finish. The metal part is then heated by induction in a vacuum.

Upon <b>cooling,</b> the <b>seal</b> ring crushes against the glass post forming the seal. The method results in a glass-to-metal seal possessing extremely good leak resistance, while the parts are kept clean and free of the contaminants...|$|R
