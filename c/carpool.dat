30|$|This paper diagnoses {{some key}} {{determinants}} for consideration of <b>carpooling</b> policy. It is found that social, {{environmental and economic}} benefits of <b>carpooling</b> service would have significant impact on user’s propensity for using this mode. Other researchers have also reported similar benefits of using <b>carpooling</b> as perceived by travelers [3, 5]. The findings implicate that the provision of <b>carpooling</b> service {{would be able to}} reduce travelers’ cost with improved social and environmental conditions of the city as it will help in reducing vehicle miles travelled and energy consumption that are detrimental to the society and environment. Disincentives on car use, parking incentives on <b>carpooling,</b> and comfort and convenience attributes are major motives for travelers to use <b>carpooling</b> service. In addition to these factors, other mentioned motives in previous studies include driving alone, trip purpose, parking cost and Web-based application of service [8, 14, 20]. High travel cost and limited parking space for car usage, and preferential and free treatment with <b>carpooling</b> vehicles at parking facilities would help in promoting use of <b>carpooling</b> service. On the other hand, major constraints in promoting the use of this service include personal constraints, privacy and freedom of travelers, and limitations of <b>carpooling</b> service such as time-consumingness and unpunctuality. These findings are different from other studies [3, 20, 24] in terms of personal and freedom factors, as previous studies have mostly focused on the service and operational aspects of <b>carpooling</b> service in comparison with other modes. These findings imply that the people who have strong belief on such constraints in traveling would not prefer <b>carpooling</b> service to their private vehicles. Other significant factors include traveler’s pro-auto and pro-carpooling attitudes, marital status (single), current travel mode (private car), profession (employees) and trip purpose (shopping) of <b>carpooling.</b> It is argued that the people who possess strong pro-auto attitudes would prefer to use their private vehicles and those who hold strong pro-carpooling attitudes would have more propensity of considering <b>carpooling</b> service as their traveling mode in future. Travelers may prefer <b>carpooling</b> to private vehicle if they realize a significant reduction in travel cost, and if this service is comfortable, convenient and safer for them. <b>Carpooling</b> programs need to be designed considering traveler’s needs and desires. These programs should focus on minimizing the constraints in the use of <b>carpooling</b> and maximizing the related benefits. In this regard, supporting infrastructure and incentives on <b>carpooling</b> would be key instruments and may include preferential treatment to <b>carpooling</b> vehicles on roads and in parking areas. In addition, organizations- and educational institutions-based <b>carpooling</b> programs have more potential to be initiated in Lahore City, where many employment zones and institutions concentrate. Employees and students can be encouraged to participate in <b>carpooling,</b> as it will help them to reduce travel cost and make their trip more meaningful and enjoyable. It is also required to develop carpooling-oriented attitudes among people in order to make proper promotion. For this purpose, soft TDM policies can be adopted (e.g., education and awareness campaigns and marketing programs).|$|R
50|$|Flexible <b>carpooling</b> is <b>carpooling</b> {{that is not}} {{arranged}} {{ahead of}} time, but instead makes use of designated meeting places.

30|$|Traffic {{congestion}} {{has become}} a critical issue in developing countries, as it tends to increase social costs in terms of travel cost and time, energy consumption and environmental degradation. With limited resources, reducing travel demand by influencing individuals’ travel behavior can be a better long-term solution. To achieve this objective, alternate travel options need to be provided {{so that people can}} commute comfortably and economically. This study aims to identify key motives and constraints in the consideration of <b>carpooling</b> policy with the help of stated preference questionnaire survey that was conducted in Lahore City. The designed questionnaire includes respondents’ socioeconomic demographics, and intentions and stated preferences on <b>carpooling</b> policy. Factor analysis was conducted on travelers’ responses, and a structural model was developed for <b>carpooling.</b> Survey and modeling results reveal that social, environmental and economic benefits, disincentives on car use, preferential parking treatment for <b>carpooling,</b> and comfort and convenience attributes are significant determinants in promoting <b>carpooling.</b> However, people with strong belief in personal privacy, security, freedom in traveling and <b>carpooling</b> service constraints would have less potential to use the <b>carpooling</b> service. In addition, pro-auto and pro-carpooling attitudes, marital status, profession and travel purpose for <b>carpooling</b> are also underlying factors. The findings implicate that to promote <b>carpooling</b> policy it is required to consider appropriate incentives on this service and disincentives on use of private vehicle along with modification of people’s attitudes and intentions.|$|R

40|$|Although {{the private}} <b>carpooling</b> market of China has grown rapidly, {{it has been}} embarrassed by {{problems}} such as obstructed information, disordered expense, and frequent crimes currently. In this paper, a commute <b>carpooling</b> program based on fixed time and routes is designed and corresponding <b>carpooling</b> information platform is built to realize information retrieval, information matching, and mutual selection and evaluation. We have practiced the program in Huaian, China, and then evaluated it using the improved time-expense impedance model and VISSIM simulation system. The result shows that the <b>carpooling</b> program can reduce 65 %~ 86 % of the time-expense impedance and optimize some network parameters up to 20 %~ 40 %. Since it will help in reducing the travel time and cost greatly, improving safety and economy during <b>carpooling,</b> and easing the traffic congestion, it is a worthy <b>carpooling</b> mode to be extended in China...|$|R
30|$|A {{questionnaire}} {{consisting of}} five parts was designed in this study.

40|$|Non-household <b>carpools</b> (where {{two or more}} commuters from {{different}} residences travel {{together in the same}} private vehicle) bring public benefits. To encourage and incentivise it, transport practitioners and researchers must understand its private motivations and deterrents. Existing studies often report conflicting results or non-generalisable findings. Thus, a quantitative systematic review of the literature body is needed. Using meta-analysis, this study synthesised 22 existing empirical studies (representing over 79, 000 observations) to produce an integrated review of the <b>carpooling</b> literature. The meta-analysis determined 24 non-household <b>carpooling</b> factors, and their effect sizes. Factors such as number of employees (r̅ = 0. 42), partner matching programs (r̅ = 0. 42), female (r̅ = 0. 22) and fixed work schedule (r̅ = 0. 15) were found to have strong effects on <b>carpooling</b> while judgmental factors (such as the motivation to save costs) only exhibited small influence (r̅ < 0. 1). Based on the significant effects, the paper discussed prospects for improving <b>carpooling</b> uptake by developing: (i) target demographics, (ii) selling points for marketing, (iii) <b>carpooling</b> partner programs and (iv) multiple employer ‘super-pools’.

40|$|For {{the problem}} of route choice in taxi <b>carpooling</b> detour, {{considering}} the uncertainty of traffic and the characteristic of passengers’ noncomplete rationality, an evolutionary game model of taxi <b>carpooling</b> detour route is built, in which prospect theory is introduced and revenue of strategy is replaced by prospect value. The model reflects more really decision-making psychology of passengers. Then the stable strategies of the model are studied, and the influences of detour distance and traffic congestion on detour <b>carpooling</b> success are analyzed, respectively. The results show that when at least one route of which prospect values for two passenger sides are both positive exists, <b>carpooling</b> route can reach an agreement. The route is stable strategy of evolutionary game, and the passengers requiring short travel time tend to select the nondetour route. With the increase of detour distance and traffic congestion rate, the possibility of reaching an agreement decreases gradually; that is, possibility of <b>carpooling</b> failure increases. So taxi <b>carpooling</b> detour is possible under the certain condition, but some measures {{must be carried out}} such as constraints of detour distance and mitigation of traffic congestion to improve <b>carpooling</b> success probability. These conclusions have a certain guiding significance to the formulation of taxi <b>carpooling</b> policy...|$|R
40|$|AbstractApproximately 40 {{percent of}} fuel {{consumption}} {{in large cities}} is related to transportation. A noticeable amount of fuel is wasted due to traffic congestion in peak hours. Transportation planners look for policies to reduce congestion to save fuel and increase energy efficiency. One of the policies is <b>carpooling</b> that emphasizes on a shared use of private cars. In this paper, the factors which persuade travellers to choose <b>carpooling</b> are investigated for Tehran city, capital of Iran. A stated preferences (SP) survey {{has been used to}} observe travellers’ tendency of <b>carpooling.</b> SP is a survey technique which mathematically shows the preferences, based on people's stated choices and their responses to hypothetical situations. The survey questionnaires filled out by 470 travellers used their own automobiles. Considering the data, <b>carpooling</b> impacts are analyzed in different situations. In this approach a demand function is calibrated and utilized to predict percent of travellers choose <b>carpooling.</b> When all interested travellers, independence of knowing appropriate rideshare or not, choose <b>carpooling</b> then vehicle trips per day would decrease about 780000 vehicle trips per day and reduce annual fuel consumption by 336. 53 million litres. The results show that if appropriate strategies like <b>carpooling</b> websites are designed to help travellers for identifying appropriate rideshares, <b>carpooling</b> would increase by 30 percent and this increase will reduce annual fuel consumption about 240 million litres. Results also show that high occupancy vehicle lanes (HOV) that reduce travel time for ridesharing may not highly influence on <b>carpooling</b> tendency of travellers...|$|R

5|$|The parkway was {{proposed}} to help bridge {{a gap in}} the eastern part of the Long Island Parkway system. Construction began in 1949 with the opening of an interchange between Bay Shore Road and the Southern State Parkway. Work on the parkway itself began the following year, with plans calling for connections to three spurs: the Captree State Parkway (now Robert Moses Causeway), the Sunken Meadow Spur (Sunken Meadow State Parkway), and the Heckscher Spur (Heckscher State Parkway). The parkway was completed in 1952, closing the highway loop on Long Island. In 2001, a study by the New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT) called for the Sagtikos State Parkway to be widened to include new bus and <b>carpool</b> lanes from end to end.|$|E
5|$|The station also {{includes}} a 600-stall park and ride lot next to the bus station and an auxiliary lot located across Southcenter Boulevard. The park and ride, initially the only facility on Central Link, would regularly fill before 9:00a.m. by 2013, leading to complaints and commuters parking on nearby residential streets. An additional 62 parking spaces were added in November 2013, through a lease from a private garage owned by the City of SeaTac. The opening of the University Link in 2016 worsened the parking issue, leaving the lot filled by 6:40a.m. Sound Transit began a permit parking trial in September 2016 that reserves spaces for registered <b>carpool</b> vehicles for a monthly fee of $5, {{in an effort to}} alleviate the parking problems at the station. A second park and ride opened at Angle Lake station in September 2016, which was expected to relieve the Tukwila lot, but demand remained the same while Angle Lake's lot filled with new commuters.

30|$|Seyedabrishami et al. [5] {{believe that}} {{with the help of}} {{appropriate}} strategies, it is possible to increase <b>carpooling</b> among travelers and such an increase will help in reducing annual fuel consumption. In the USA and Canada, ridesharing almost represents 8 %– 11 % of the transportation modal share, and the relationship of ridesharing policies with infrastructure development, traffic congestion, energy consumption and related emissions needs to understand well [6]. Manzini and Pareschi [7] state that <b>carpooling</b> is an effective strategy to reduce transport demand, travel costs and other related externalities. The acceptability of such TDM measures by public and their effectiveness in changing travel behavior are associated issues and need to be evaluated. Many factors may contribute toward such aspects of <b>carpooling</b> policy. These factors mainly include sociodemographics, lifestyles, intentions and attitudes of the individuals. It is believed that travel-related strategies are likely to be influenced by individuals’ lifestyles and attitudes [8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13]. In some other studies, different attitudes have been found to influence individuals’ travel behavior and related demand management strategies [14, 15, 16]. Particular travel incentives and restrictions on use of private vehicle are key determinants in the success of a particular TDM policy [8]. According to Sheldon and Heywood [3], low-cost, convenient and well-maintained services are the key attributes in defining the effective <b>carpooling</b> service. People have more potential of <b>carpooling</b> if it is combined with high occupancy vehicle (HOV) lanes [17]. However, Syedabrishami et al. [5] state that HOV lanes that reduce travel time for ridesharing may not have high influence on <b>carpooling</b> tendency of travelers. According to Li et al. [17], enjoying traveling with others, time saving, helping the environment and society are important factors in <b>carpooling,</b> whereas <b>carpooling</b> partner matching programs, employer <b>carpooling</b> incentives and preferred parking at work are generally the least important factors for travelers in consideration of <b>carpooling.</b>|$|R
40|$|<b>Carpooling,</b> i. e., the act {{where two}} or more {{travelers}} share the same car for a common trip, {{is one of the}} possibilities brought forward to reduce traffic and its externalities, but experience shows {{that it is difficult to}} boost the adoption of <b>carpooling</b> to significant levels. In our study, we analyze the potential impact of <b>carpooling</b> as a collective phenomenon emerging from people?s mobility, by network analytics. Based on big mobility data from travelers in a given territory, we construct the network of potential <b>carpooling,</b> where nodes correspond to the users and links to possible shared trips, and analyze the structural and topological properties of this network, such as network communities and node ranking, to the purpose of highlighting the subpopulations with higher chances to create a <b>carpooling</b> community, and the propensity of users to be either drivers or passengers in a shared car. Our study is anchored to reality thanks to a large mobility dataset, consisting of the complete one-month-long GPS trajectories of approx. 10 % circulating cars in Tuscany.
