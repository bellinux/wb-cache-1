5|$|For finite-dimensional representations, the {{presence}} of semisimplicity means that the Lorentz group <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>dealt</b> <b>with</b> {{the same way as}} other semisimple groups using a well-developed theory. In addition, all representations are built from the irreducible ones, since the Lie algebra possesses the complete reducibility property. But, the non-compactness of the Lorentz group, in combination with lack of simple connectedness, cannot be dealt with in all the aspects as in the simple framework that applies to simply connected, compact groups. Non-compactness implies, for a connected simple Lie group, that no nontrivial finite-dimensional unitary representations exist. Lack of simple connectedness gives rise to spin representations of the group. The non-connectedness means that, for representations of the full Lorentz group, time reversal and space inversion has to dealt with separately.|$|E

A report on Denmark's wind power noted that their wind power network provided less than 1% of average demand on 54 days during the year 2002. Wind power advocates argue that these periods of low wind <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>dealt</b> <b>with</b> by simply restarting existing power stations that have been held in readiness, or interlinking with HVDC. Electrical grids with slow-responding thermal power plants and without ties to networks with hydroelectric generation may have to limit the use of wind power. According to a 2007 Stanford University {{study published in the}} Journal of Applied Meteorology and Climatology, interconnecting ten or more wind farms can allow an average of 33% of the total energy produced (i.e. about 8% of total nameplate capacity) to be used as reliable, baseload electric power which can be relied on to handle peak loads, as long as minimum criteria are met for wind speed and turbine height.|$|E

25|$|Capacitors {{deviate from}} the ideal {{capacitor}} equation {{in a number}} of ways. Some of these, such as leakage current and parasitic effects are linear, or can be analyzed as nearly linear, and <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>dealt</b> <b>with</b> by adding virtual components to the equivalent circuit of an ideal capacitor. The usual methods of network analysis can then be applied. In other cases, such as with breakdown voltage, the effect is non-linear and ordinary (normal, e.g., linear) network analysis cannot be used, the effect must be dealt with separately. There is yet another group, which may be linear but invalidate the assumption in the analysis that capacitance is a constant. Such an example is temperature dependence. Finally, combined parasitic effects such as inherent inductance, resistance, or dielectric losses can exhibit non-uniform behavior at variable frequencies of operation.|$|E

500|$|The typical {{case will}} be of a non-fatal offence against the person that causes death. There must be a {{criminal}} act, rather than an omission, following R v Lowe. Although acts and omissions may be equally culpable, the extension to omissions [...] {{where there is no}} need to show intent [...] would have made illegal a huge class of persons. Cases such as Lowe, which there was parental neglect, <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>dealt</b> <b>with</b> by gross negligence manslaughter. Judges have often failed to identify a single unlawful act on which the crime of manslaughter is to be constructed, rather assuming the presence of one in particular circumstances. There is a required mental element (mens rea) for this crime, but it has in some cases not actually been formally established. This mens rea might be very low, such as recklessness. The requirement of an unlawful act also means that no lawful defence must be available to the defendant in respect of the lesser crime.|$|E
500|$|According to Oscar Schachter, {{there is}} some {{question}} as to whether the traditional international lawmaking process of state-by-state treaty ratification is adequate today: [...] "The traditional case-by-case process of customary law cannot meet the necessity for common action to deal with the numerous problems raised by technological developments, demographic and environmental impacts, changing attitudes as to social justice, or the many requirements of international business. While all of these matters <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>dealt</b> <b>with</b> by multilateral treaties, the treaty processes are often complicated and slow, whereas UN resolutions can be more readily attained." [...] The Law of the Sea is an example of an agreement that has taken decades to pass in the U.S. (although the Cato Institute views the delay as a good thing.) George Monbiot argues, [...] "The absence of an international legislature undermines the authority of an international judiciary (such as the proposed criminal court). Judges presiding over the war-crimes tribunals at the Hague and in Arusha have been forced, in effect, to make up the law as they go along." ...|$|E
500|$|Public {{nuisance}} concerns {{protecting the}} public, unlike private nuisance, which protects an individual. As such {{it is not}} only a tort but also a crime. In Attorney-General v PYA Quarries Ltd, it was defined by Romer LJ as any act or omission [...] "which materially affects the reasonable comfort and convenience of life of a class of Her Majesty's subjects". Because of the wide definition given, there are a large range of issues which <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>dealt</b> <b>with</b> through public nuisance, including picketing on a road, as in Thomas v NUM, blocking a canal, as in Rose v Miles, or disrupting traffic by queuing in a road, as in Lyons v Gulliver. A significant difference between private and public nuisance is that under public, one can claim for personal injuries as well as damage to property. Another difference is that public nuisance is primarily a crime; it only becomes a tort if the claimant can prove that they suffered [...] "special damage" [...] over and above the effects on the other affected people in the [...] "class". The test for the required size of a [...] "class" [...] was also discussed in Attorney-General v PYA Quarries Ltd, with the court concluding that the test was whether the nuisance was [...] "so widespread in its range or so indiscriminate in its effect {{that it would not be}} reasonable to expect one person to take proceedings on his own responsibility to put a stop to it, but that it should be taken on the responsibility of the community at large".|$|E
