40|$|Abstract. The {{satellite}} TV industry {{relies heavily}} {{on the use of}} smart card technology {{at the very heart of}} broadcasted services that are protected by legacy <b>conditional</b> <b>access</b> <b>systems.</b> The process of Satellite TV signal protection is distributed amongst a number of system components, e. g. smart cards, receivers, <b>Conditional</b> <b>Access</b> Modules (CAM) and the content provider. However, the introduction of “Open ” Satellite Receivers, providing a highly configurable environment with software emulation of <b>conditional</b> <b>access</b> <b>systems,</b> enabled the implementation of whole range of new attacks. A widely deployed attack is often referred to as the “card sharing ” attack, by which one legitimate user colludes to provide protected content to a larger group of unauthorised users. This paper proposes a countermeasure that increases the bandwidth requirements of this attack to the point where it is no longer practical with a standard internet connection, with a minimal impact on existing protocols and architectures. ...|$|R
