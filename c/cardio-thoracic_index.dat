30|$|A 58 -year-old male, {{weighing}} 98  kg (body {{mass index}} 41.86  kg/m 2), presented with bilateral forearm bone fractures. He was having hypothyroidism, on thyroxin 100  mcg/day. History and examination revealed daytime somnolence, tiredness and snoring, and orthopnea with neck girth of 53  cm. Room air saturation was 93 % in sitting position with respiratory rate 22 /min, breath holding time 15  s, and BP of 148 / 92  mmHg with clinical metabolic equivalent of task of 5. Chest X-ray showed a hyper-inflated lung with <b>cardio-thoracic</b> <b>index</b> of >[*] 50 %; baseline PaCO 2 of 46  mmHg and pulmonary function test showed obstructive pattern and right ventricular systolic pressure of 30  mmHg in echocardiography. Airway assessment {{was significant for}} double chin, buffalo hump, short and thick neck with the modified Mallapati score 4, and thyromental distance of 5  cm.|$|E
40|$|Aim. To {{identify}} possible {{predictors of}} atrial fibrillation (AF) recurrence in 6 -month prophylactic propafenone therapy. Material and methods. Patients (n= 63; aged 52. 2 ± 12. 6 years; 25. 4 % women) with frequent AF recurrences who restored sinus rhythm with propafenone, were included into the study. Paroxysmal AF {{was observed in}} 84. 1 % of patients, and persistent AF — in 15. 9 % of patients. ECG, transthoracic echocardiography, chest radiography with the calculation of <b>cardio-thoracic</b> <b>index</b> (CTI) was performed at baseline. All patients received rpropafenone therapy (450 – 600 mg/day) during 6 months after sinus rhythm conversion. ECG and 24 -hours ECG monitoring were performed in 1, 3 and 6 months of the therapy. Patients with 70 – 100 % reduction in AF recurrence rate were included into the 1 -st group, and patients with 0. 05). Mean age of patients in the group 2 was significantly older than this in patients of the group 1 (p< 0. 05). CTI, left atrium size and volume, interventricular septum thickness (IVST) were significantly larger in group 2. Myocardium mass of the left ventricle (MMLV) after 6 months of therapy was larger by 13. 9 % in patients of the group 2 vs this in patients of the group 1 (p< 0. 05). Conclusion. Insufficient preventive effect of propafenone was observed in 8 %, 11. 5 % and 22 % of patients in 1, 3 and 6 months of the follow-up, respectively. Propafenone prophylactic efficacy was slightly higher in men and younger patients. Patients with poor preventive effect of propafenone had a significantly larger baseline CTI, size and volume of the left atrium, IVST, and MMLV. </p...|$|E
40|$|Introduction. Levosimendan {{is a novel}} {{positive}} inotropic agent which, improves myocardial contractility {{through its}} calcium-sensitizing action, without causing an increase in myocardial oxygen demand. Also, by opening ATP-sensitive potassium channels, it causes vasodilatation with the reduction in both afterload and preload. Because of the long halflife, its effects last for up 7 to 9 days after 24 -hour infusion. Case report. We presented three patients 2, 15 and 17 years old. All the patients had severe acute deterioration of the previously diagnosed chronic heart failure (dilatative cardiomyopathy; univentricular heart with bidirectional Glenn anastomosis and restrictive bulboventricular foramen; bacterial endocarditis on artificial aortic valve with severe stenosis and regurgitation). Signs and symptoms of severe heart failure, cardiomegaly (<b>cardio-thoracic</b> <b>index</b> 0. 65) and left ventricular dilatation (end-diastolic diameter z-score 2. 6; 4. 1 and 4. 0) were confirmed on admission. Also, myocardial contractility was poor with ejection fraction (EF - 27 %, 25 %, 35 %), fractional shortening (FS - 13 %, 11 %, 15 %) and stroke volume (SV - 40, 60, 72 mL/m 2). The treatment with standard intravenous inotropic agents resulted in no improvement but in clinical deterioration. Thus, standard intravenous inotropic support was stopped and levosimendan treatment was introduced. All the patients received a continuous 24 -h infusion 0. 1 μg/kg/min of levosimendan. In a single patient an initial loading dose of 11 μg/kg over 10 min was administrated, too. Levosimendan treatment resulted in both clinical and echocardiography improvement with the improved EF (42 %, 34 %, 44 %), FS (21 %, 16 %, 22 %) and SV (59, 82, 93 mL/m 2). Hemodynamic improvement was registered too, with the reduction in heart rate in all the treated patients from 134 - 138 bpm before, to less than 120 bpm after the treatment. These parameters were followed by the normalization of lactate levels. Nevertheless, left ventricular end-diastolic diameter did not change after the levosimendan treatment. Conclusion. Our initial experience demonstrates that administration of levosimendan in patients with severe chronic heart failure not responsive to standard intravenous inotropic treatment might result in a significant clinical and hemodynamic improvement and that, in selected patients, it might be life saving. According to our best knowledge patients presented are the first pediatric patients treated with levosimendan in our country...|$|E
