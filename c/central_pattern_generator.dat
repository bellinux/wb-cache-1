Because of the variety of voltage-sensitive ion channels that can be embedded in the membrane of a neuron, many types of neurons are capable, even in isolation, of generating rhythmic sequences of action potentials, or rhythmic alternations between high-rate bursting and quiescence. When neurons that are intrinsically rhythmic are connected to each other by excitatory or inhibitory synapses, the resulting networks are capable {{of a wide variety of}} dynamical behaviors, including attractor dynamics, periodicity, and even chaos.

As described by Hooper, weak sensory input to the swimming CPG produces reflexive withdrawal, while strong input produces swimming.

Additionally, the same single interneuronal network has been found to produce not only [...] "rhythmic, muscle-based escape swimming," [...] but also [...] "nonrhythmic, cilia-mediated crawling." [...] Evidence also suggests that although the CPG controls related but separate functions, neuromodulation of one function can occur without affecting the other.

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{outlines}} {{aspects of}} locomotor control in insects that {{may serve as}} the basis for the design of controllers for autonomous hexapod robots. Control of insect walking can be considered hierarchical and modular. The brain determines onset, direction, and speed of walking. Coordination is done locally in the ganglia that control leg movements. Typically, networks of neurons capable of generating alternating contractions of antagonistic muscles (termed <b>central</b> <b>pattern</b> <b>generators,</b> or CPGs) control the stepping movements of individual legs. The legs are coordinated by interactions between the CPGs and sensory feedback from the moving legs. This peripheral feedback provides information about leg load, position, velocity, and acceleration, as well as information about joint angles and foot contact. In addition, both the <b>central</b> <b>pattern</b> <b>generators</b> and the sensory information that feeds them may be modulated or adjusted according to circumstances. Consequently, locomotion in insects is extraordinarily robust and adaptable...|$|R
5000|$|<b>Central</b> <b>pattern</b> <b>generators</b> {{can also}} play a role in rhythm {{generation}} for other functions in vertebrate animals. For example, the rat vibrissa system uses an unconventional CPG for whisking movements. [...] "Like other CPGs, the whisking generator can operate without cortical input or sensory feedback. However, unlike other CPGs, vibrissa motoneurons actively participate in rhythmogenesis by converting tonic serotonergic inputs into the patterned motor output responsible for movement of the vibrissae." [...] Breathing is another non-locomotive function of <b>central</b> <b>pattern</b> <b>generators.</b> For example, larval amphibians accomplish gas exchange largely through rhythmic ventilation of the gills. A study by Broch, et al. showed that lung ventilation in the tadpole brainstem may be driven by a pacemaker-like mechanism, whereas the respiratory CPG adapts in the adult bullfrog as it matures. Thus, CPGs hold a broad range of functions in the vertebrate animal and are widely adaptable and variable with age, environment and behavior.|$|R

Command neurons receive a convergence of integrative and sensory input and output to a multifarious group of pattern generating efferent cells.
