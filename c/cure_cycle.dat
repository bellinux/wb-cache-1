50|$|In the {{production}} of composite aerospace and aircraft components, autoclave curing has traditionally been used to achieve the desired fiber content (resin-to-fiber ratio) {{and the absence of}} resin voids to produce light weight and strong components. Autoclave curing achieves this by placing the part under vacuum in an autoclave and then pressurizing the autoclave during the heated <b>cure</b> <b>cycle.</b> The high pressure on the part (within the pressurized autoclave) helps to minimize resin voids and to achieve the desired resin/fiber ratio.|$|E

40|$|A {{new method}} has been {{developed}} to determine the <b>curing</b> <b>cycles</b> for thick laminates.

50|$|The {{aerospace}} industry manufactures {{small numbers of}} very expensive products and is thus able to afford the high capital and unit operating costs of autoclaves. Typically, this entails applying carefully controlled levels of heat and pressure to parts and assemblies. The curing of composites requires compacting the piles of material, pressing this material against the mold, forcing out volatiles and excess resin, and holding everything motionless during the entire <b>cure</b> <b>cycle.</b> In structural adhesive bonding, the autoclave forces the parts together and holds them while the adhesive cures.

50|$|SQRTM is an RTM process {{adapted to}} prepreg technology. The prepreg {{is placed in}} a closed mold and during the <b>cure</b> <b>cycle,</b> {{a small amount of}} resin is {{injected}} into the cavity through ports positioned around the part. This resin does not go into the laminate, but only presses up against the edge of the laminate in order to establish hydrostatic pressure on the prepreg, similar to the goal of autoclave curing. This pressure is similar to the autoclave, on the order of 6-7 bars (90-100 psi). Hydrostatic pressure minimizes voids by keeping dissolved air, water and resin monomers in solution in the resin.The tool can either be self-clamped and self-heated or heated and clamped by a press.

The quickstep out of autoclave system is unique in that it uses fully immersed balanced pressure fluid curing and it allows the user to stop the composite cure reaction {{at any point in}} the <b>cure</b> <b>cycle,</b> and thus can halt processing on {{all or part of the}} laminate and either return to it at a later to complete cure or to co-cure, join and bond other composites to it to create larger parts.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: We have {{developed}} a robust, simulation-based optimization and control methodology to identify and implement the optimal curing conditions for thick-sectioned resin transfer molding (RTM) composite manufacturing. The global optimization of the process identified the need {{for at least one}} cooling stage within the <b>cure</b> <b>cycle</b> to produce quality laminates within a minimal amount of time. A sensitivity analysis in the variability of the model parameters within the simulation was performed to characterize its effect on an optimal <b>cure</b> <b>cycle.</b> To further account for observed batch to batch model parameter variability, a novel optimization algorithm based on Evolutionary Strategies was developed to identify a more robust <b>cure</b> <b>cycle.</b> The control strategy for implementing the optimal <b>cure</b> <b>cycle</b> relies solely on the use of non-intrusive heat flux sensors.

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{existing}} <b>cure</b> <b>cycles</b> and processes {{on the quality}} of thermoset composite parts with angle-bend is presented. A 2 -D finite difference scheme was developed to model the processing of arbitrary shaped composite parts. The formulation includes heat transfer, viscosity, extent of cure, and resin flow submodels. Matrix material properties were allowed to vary with temperature. As a result, various cure parameters such as temperature, degree of cure, viscosity, compaction and fiber volume fraction were examined. A first set of experiments was done to investigate the effect of different <b>curing</b> <b>cycles</b> on temperature exotherms, thickness variation and fiber volume fraction distribution. Results from both simulation and experiment agree well. They also showed that parts produced using recommended <b>curing</b> <b>cycles</b> from manufacturers were not of good quality in terms of uniform fiber volume fraction and thickness over the cross-section of the part. Based on these results, an optimal curing process was obtained. An optimal curing process is defined as one which will produce uniform thickness and fiber volume fraction throughout the composite part including straight sections and curved sections.

40|$|For the {{fabrication}} of resin matrix {{fiber reinforced composite}} laminates, a workable <b>cure</b> <b>cycle</b> (i. e., temperature and pressure profiles {{as a function of}} processing time) is needed and is critical for achieving void-free laminate consolidation.

40|$|In {{the last}} few decades, {{there has been a}} shift to using more {{lightweight}} materials for the potential of fuel consumption reduction. In the Aerospace Industry, conventional metal structures are being replaced by advanced composite structures. The major advantage of an advanced composite structure is the huge {{reduction in the number of}} parts and joints required. Also composite materials provide better resistance to creep, corrosion, and fatigue. However, one cannot eliminate all the joints and attachments in an aircraft’s structure. Eliminating structural joints is impractical in present-day aircraft because of the requirements for inspection, manufacturing breaks, assembly and equipment access, and replacement of damaged structures. Currently, composite joints are overdesigned which leads to weight penalties. Understanding how to optimize the ultimate bearing strength of a composite joint by altering the <b>cure</b> <b>cycle</b> might be beneficial to the composite joint design process. This study investigates, through numerical and experimental analysis, the mechanical behavior of double shear joints. The first task is to test Aluminum double shear joint specimens inside the double shear joint fixture at a loading rate of 0. 05 in. /min. (quasi-static). The second task is to numerically model and validate the aluminum double shear joint specimen. The third task is to test the Unidirectional MTM 49 carbon fiber pre-preg double shear composite joint specimens with two different cure cycles and five different loading rates (0. 05 in. /min., 0. 1 in. /min., 1 in. /min., 2 in. /min. and 6 in. /min.). The double shear composite joint specimens are made, using a heat press, with a quasi-isotropic laminate orientation of [0 0 + 45 - 45 + 45 - 45 90 90]s. The first <b>cure</b> <b>cycle</b> used is called the alternate <b>cure</b> <b>cycle,</b> which is Cytec’s MTM 49 Unidirectional Carbon Fiber pre-preg material <b>cure</b> <b>cycle,</b> and the second <b>cure</b> <b>cycle</b> used is called the datasheet <b>cure</b> <b>cycle,</b> which is Umeco 2 ̆ 7 s MTM 49 Unidirectional Carbon Fiber pre-preg material <b>cure</b> <b>cycle.</b> The recommended datasheet <b>cure</b> <b>cycle</b> and an alternate <b>cure</b> <b>cycle</b> are both compared to see how they affect the mechanical characteristics of the matrix along with the bearing stress. The fourth task is to adjust the Aluminum double shear joint numerical model for the double shear composite joint specimen. The numerical results for both the Aluminum and the composite specimens are in agreement with the experimental results. The theoretical in-plane material properties of the quasi-isotropic laminate were in agreement with the experimental results. One can see that at 0. 05 in. /min. and 0. 1 in. /min.
