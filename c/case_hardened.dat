500|$|The {{ultimate}} ironclad armor was <b>case</b> <b>hardened</b> nickel-steel. In 1890, the U.S. Navy tested steel armor hardened by the Harvey {{process and}} found it superior to compound armor. [...] For several years 'Harvey steel' was {{the state of the}} art, produced in the U.S., France, Germany, Britain, Austria and Italy. In 1894, the German firm Krupp developed gas cementing, which further hardened steel armor. The German , laid down in 1895, was the first ship to benefit from the new 'Krupp armor' and the new armor was quickly adopted; the Royal Navy using it from , laid down in 1896. By 1901 almost all new battleships used Krupp armor, though the U.S. continued to use Harvey armor alongside {{until the end of the}} decade.|$|E

40|$|<b>Case</b> <b>hardening</b> is {{a feature}} of dried wood that causes the wood to deform (cup) after re-sawing and {{equalising}} the moisture content. VTT has analysed <b>case</b> <b>hardening</b> {{with the aid of}} the simulation model PEO and with experimental drying, conditioning and storage tests. <b>Case</b> <b>hardening</b> cannot be predicted by the moisture content gradient alone. However, the <b>case</b> <b>hardening</b> gap after drying to a high final moisture content of 18 % is nearly identical to the calculated gap caused by cupping when the moisture gradients of the two halves of the test piece are equalised. 24 hours (proposed in ENV 14464) is too little time to show the total cupping when keeping the sliced specimens in a plastic bag. Thus the test according the standard doesn’t show the whole cupping tendency of, for example, panels when the moisture content is equalised after re-sawing the timber and planing the billets. Increasing the kiln drying rate increases the resulting <b>case</b> <b>hardening</b> tendency. With effective conditioning at the drying temperature, or with steaming after cooling, it is possible to reduce or remove the <b>case</b> <b>hardening.</b> But at normal temperatures in end-use or storage of timber the <b>case</b> <b>hardening</b> diminishes very slowly, despite the equalising of the moisture content in the cross-sectio...|$|R

2500|$|In {{the early}} 17th century, ironworkers in Western Europe had {{developed}} the cementation process for carburizing wrought iron. Wrought iron bars and charcoal were packed into stone boxes, then sealed with clay {{to be held}} at a red heat continually tended in an oxygen-free state immersed in nearly pure carbon (charcoal) for up to a week. [...] During this time, carbon diffused into the surface layers of the iron, producing cement steel or blister steelalso known as <b>case</b> <b>hardened,</b> where the portions wrapped in iron (the pick or axe blade) became harder, than say an axe hammer-head or shaft socket which might be insulated by clay to keep them from the carbon source. [...] The earliest place where this process was used in England was at Coalbrookdale from 1819, where Sir Basil Brooke had two cementation furnaces (recently excavatedin 20012005). [...] For a time in the 1610s, he owned a patent on the process, but had to surrender this in 1619. [...] He probably used Forest of Dean iron as his raw material, but it was soon found that oregrounds iron was more suitable. [...] The quality of the steel could be improved by faggoting, producing the so-called shear steel.|$|E

40|$|Typical {{products}} made of <b>case</b> <b>hardening</b> steel are transmission parts like gear wheels, pinions and crown wheels. <b>Case</b> <b>hardening</b> produces a carbon-rich surface {{and provides the}} parts with both enhanced hardness and fatigue life. However, variations in machinability are regularly observed when producing the same part out of different material batches. This leads to a non-robust production process with increased manufacturing costs as well as unforeseen stops and maintenance of machines. In this study, emphasis is laid on studying the effect of microstructure variations on machinability in <b>case</b> <b>hardening</b> steels. Different microstructures have been produced by changing holding time and temperature in the annealing process. The microstructure was altered {{as much as possible}} with respect to pearlite nodular size, pearlite morphology and amount of pro-eutectoid ferrite. Since a homogeneous material is required, relatively small sample diameters had to be used. Therefore, the machinability ranking (with respect to tool wear) was performed with help of the Volvo Standard Machinability Test which is a short-term test. Additionally, chip breakability was evaluated and measurements of cutting forces and surface roughness were performed. The tests have shown that a <b>case</b> <b>hardening</b> steel with larger pearlite nodular size (produced by a higher austenitizing temperature) provides better chip breakability but also an increased tool wear compared to a material with smaller pearlite nodular size. Hence, to achieve a more robust production process for <b>case</b> <b>hardening</b> steels, it might be necessary to include pearlite nodular size and/or amount of pro-eutectoid ferrite in the materials specification. Moreover, the different tests have revealed that hardness is not a suitable criterion for machinability...|$|R
40|$|In the {{previous}} paper, we reported the low alloyed dual-phase steel couldbe used for elevated temperature <b>case</b> <b>hardening</b> steels without the first stepquenching from microstructure observations. In the present work, mechanicalproperties and optimum quenching {{temperature of the}} dual-phase steels werein vestiga ted for practical <b>case</b> <b>hardening</b> applications. The microstructural and mechanical properties of the 0. 05 mass% C- 2. 0 mass% Si- (0. 05 mass% Nb and 0. 05 mass% Ti) steels carburized at 1323 K for 10. 8 ks,quenched from 1123 K- 1223 K and then tempered at 423 K were studied. The maximumtensile and fatigue strength of the 2. 0 mass% Si steel and the 2. 0 mass%Si- (0. 05 mass% Nb and 0. 05 mass% Ti) steel were obtained after quenching from 1123 K and 1223 K, respectively. These properties were much higher than thoseof the conventional <b>case</b> <b>hardening</b> steel obtained by two step quenching. Thewear resistance was not affected by quenching temperature and was much superiorin the regions of higher and lower sliding speed compared with the carbontool steel (SK 3). Skipping the first step quenching and carburizing at elevatedtemperatures make the processing time shorter and energy consumption to fabricate materials smaller. Thus, the dual-phase steel is considered to have apotential for practical use for the elevated temperature <b>case</b> <b>hardening</b> steel...|$|R

50|$|Applies various {{chemical}} processes (browning, bluing, Parkerization, among others) {{to the metal}} parts of guns to develop corrosion resistant surface layers on the steel. They may also apply <b>case</b> <b>hardening</b> to low carbon steel parts. <b>Case</b> <b>hardening</b> is a combined chemical and heat-treatment process which introduces carbon into the surfaces of low steel alloys that does not contain sufficient carbon to allow total ("through") heat treatment. This carbon rich surface is then heat treated resulting in a thin, very hard surface layer with a tough, malleable core. This process can be done solely for the mechanical properties (hardness and toughness) it imparts, or, by packing the parts in bone charcoal and other chemicals and heating in a heat treatment furnace for varying time periods, {{it is possible to}} introduce rich colors into the carbonized surface. This type of <b>case</b> <b>hardening,</b> known as color <b>case</b> <b>hardening,</b> is prized for its rich mottled blues, purples, browns and grey tones. It is possible, with highly skilled craftsmen using highly proprietary processes, to control the hues and patterns so closely that one familiar with high grade custom firearms can usually recognize the maker of another shooter's firearm solely by the colors and patterns on its parts; an important distinction on extremely costly firearms of the highest grade. Typically, its use is usually restricted to receivers, rarely barrels. Although providing corrosion resistance, the colored surface layers are subject to wear and may also fade with time.
