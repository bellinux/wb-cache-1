25|$|The provincial {{population}} is 807,787 (2000). There are 24 ethnic groups live here, predominantly Kinh, Vân Kiều and <b>Chứt.</b> Other minorities are in very small quantity with 100 persons each. All of 23 minority ethnic groups live in mountainous areas. The provincial {{population is}} unevenly distributed, {{with more than}} 90% live in around 10% of the provincial land while just 10% live in 90% mountainous and sand areas. 88.5% inhabitants lives in rural areas, 11.5% lives in urban areas. 47.08% of the population (380,306) was {{in the labor force}} in 2000, 72% of whom work in rural sectors (agriculture and syvicuture) and 10.9% in urban areas (industrial, service and commercial sectors). There are 10,720 university graduates and postgraduates (4,676 college graduates and 6042 university graduates) in 2000. Of blue-collar workers, only 35,000 have passed appropriate training courses.|$|E
50|$|Following the {{assassination}} of Tsar Alexander II of Russia in 1881, many thousands of Jewish refugees, fleeing political unrest in Eastern Europe, arrived in the East End of London, including the Tenterground, by which time the <b>Chuts</b> had begun to disperse. Significantly, the successful introduction of machinery for the mass-production of cigarettes ultimately led {{to the collapse of}} the cigar-making economy on which the <b>Chuts</b> community depended. Many <b>Chuts</b> returned to improved conditions in Amsterdam, some emigrated further afield to places such as Australia and the United States, some assimilated into other Jewish families, and some eventually lost their Jewish identity altogether.|$|R

50|$|There was {{distinct}} {{rivalry between}} the <b>Chuts</b> and the later Jewish immigrants, {{not least because}} the <b>Chuts</b> had arrived as city-dwellers, with useful industrial skills, and by 1881 had already learned to speak English, whereas the later immigrants were generally impoverished rural workers who had to learn new trades in the notorious sweatshops and, arriving penniless and in great numbers, {{drew attention to the}} problem of immigration which resulted in the Aliens Act of 1905.|$|R
25|$|The {{government}} began to intensify its counter-insurgency operations in Wau State in early April, moving more troops, tanks and equipment into the region. On 4 April, the strengthened SPLA forces initiated a large-scale offensive against SPLM-IO {{positions in the}} areas around Bisellia, Baggari, Bazia, and Kuajiena, resulting in fierce fighting. The SPLM-IO later accused the South Sudanese Air Force of having used chemical weapons to bombard them during the these clashes. On 5 April, the rebels launched a counter-attack against Mapel, {{which resulted in a}} battle during which either government or opposition fighters gunned down dozens of civilians. Three days later, the government forces retook Baggari, which had been {{in the hands of the}} SPLM-IO for nine months, after heavy fighting with rebel defenders. On the following day, however, the rebels ambushed a government convoy as it returned to Wau town, and killed Brig. Gen. Peter Par Jiek, Col. Abraham Bol <b>Chut</b> Dhuol (brother of Matur <b>Chut</b> Dhuol) as well as twelve of their bodyguards. In revenge for the ambush, SPLA soldiers and pro-government Dinka militiamen belonging to Mathiang Anyoor began a rampage in Wau town and surrounding villages, murdering and robbing non-Dinkas. UNMISS stated that at least 16 civilians were killed and 10 wounded, while local sources reported 31 killed and 9 wounded. The SPLM-IO and pro-opposition media claimed that about 50 civilians had been murdered. Locals said that those targeted by the pro-government fighters mostly belonged to the Fertit, Luo, Jur Modo/Jur Beli, Balanda Boor/Balanda Bviri ethnic groups, which were believed by the assailants to support the rebels. Due to the renewed violence, 8,000 more locals were displaced, as 4,000 civilians fled to the UN PoC site at Wau town and 3,800 sought refuge at the Catholic Cathedral. The SPLM government, the SPLM-IO, and the National Democratic Movement (another rebel faction) all condemned the massacre in Wau town, with the government ordering the perpetrators' arrest.|$|E
25|$|There are two {{villages of}} Arem an Ma Coong {{ethnic groups in}} the core zone of the Phong Nha-Kẻ Bàng National Park. Within the buffer zone, there is a {{population}} of 52,000. They are mainly Kinh people and other minority groups of <b>Chut</b> and Van Kieu, many of them exploit forest products as part of their livelihoods. The increase of visitors to this park is also a problem to the park since unexpected pollution (water pollution, rubbish), human impacts on caves and grottos may cause damage to them and especially threaten biodiversity. Hunting is a significant threat to the wildlife because local people have a great consumption demand on wild meat and this has contributed to the significant decrease of species such as the wild pig, binturong and primates. While local authorities have taken no legal action, nevertheless, some civil servants and policemen are the owners of restaurants that serve wild animal meats hunted in this national park. Phong Nha-Kẻ Bàng National Park is currently not meaningful for protection of tigers, Asian elephants, and wild bulls.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Chuts</b> [...] is {{the name}} applied to Jews who immigrated to London from the Netherlands during {{the latter part of}} the 19th century. They {{typically}} came from Amsterdam and practised trades they had already learned there, most notably cigar, cap and slipper making.|$|R
5000|$|Ashkenazi Jews {{frequently}} name newborn {{children after}} deceased family members, but not after living relatives.

He was rescued by community members. <b>Chut</b> Wutty is the main protagonist in the film, which charts the destruction of Cambodia's forests {{to make way for}} agricultural developments.

50|$|In Belarusian {{language}} <b>Chut</b> has masculine {{grammatical gender}} - that's why in most cases <b>Chut</b> {{is described as a}} male. <b>Chut</b> is the polymorphous spirit: he could look like little boy or dwarf; he is also able to take the form of inanimate objects — gnarled piece of wood, old wheel, dry stump and so on. <b>Chut</b> appears in the houses, where perverted daughter of host killed her illegitimate child or tried to raise him or she without baptism. Belarusians believe, that the soul of this child transforms into <b>Chut.</b> <b>Chut</b> saves the childish features of character forever: he is foolish, playful, joking and emotional labile. This spirit likes to make fun of the guests: to hide somebody's hat, to spill the beans and peas (and then gather them again at night).|$|E
5000|$|Furthermore, the <b>Chuts</b> {{were treated}} with {{suspicion}} by other Jews because the former had developed specific customs and practices, many of their families having lived in Amsterdam since the first synagogues were established there {{in the early years}} of the 17th century. Uniquely in Amsterdam, Ashkenazim (so-called [...] "German Jews") and Sephardim (so-called [...] "Spanish Jews") lived in close proximity for centuries, resulting in a cultural blend not found elsewhere. Most remarkably, the Dutch Jews were well accustomed to the sea, and ate seafoods considered not kosher by other Jewish communities.|$|R
5000|$|The {{origin of}} the name <b>Chuts</b> is uncertain. A popular {{assumption}} is that it derives from the Dutch word goed (pronounced /xut/ and meaning [...] "good") and is imitative of the foreign-language chatter that others heard. It is also Hebrew [...] for [...] "outside" [...] or [...] "in the street" [...] {{and may have been}} applied to the Dutch Jews of London either because they were socially isolated or because many were street vendors. Another possibility is that the Hebrew word would have appeared increasingly in Amsterdam synagogue records as more and more emigrated to London, and others who followed would have [...] "gone chuts" [...] (i.e., emigrated).|$|R

The host uses special words to invite <b>Chut</b> to take the meal: [...] "Chut, <b>Chut,</b> come here! I'll give You fried eggs and abaranki!"
