However, only (moderately) toxic and poorly biodegradable ionic liquids have been explored hitherto. Focusing on the development of more benign and sustainable approaches, a novel class of ABS using cholinium-based ionic liquids is proposed. For the first time, it is shown that a large assortment of cholinium-based ionic liquids is capable of undergoing liquid-liquid demixing in the presence of aqueous solutions with strong salting-out species. In order to assess the applicability of these systems for separation purposes, the partitioning of two antibiotics and/or their hydrochloride forms was also investigated.

Operators of BWRs use the coolant flow through the core to control reactivity by varying the speed of the reactor recirculation pumps (an increase in coolant flow through the core improves the removal of steam bubbles, thus increasing the density of the coolant/moderator, increasing power).|$|E
50|$|Possibly the world's oldest {{operational}} mine, the Skouriotissa copper mine, {{was founded}} in 1914 by the Cyprus Mines Corporation.

As a result of near <b>complete</b> <b>extraction</b> of copper and iron pyrite ore, and the expense of extracting the remaining low grade deposits companies which had resumed operations after the conflict operated on smaller scales. Falling international copper prices created a recession forcing the other companies to cease mining production entirely by 1979.

40|$|Ethoxyquin is an {{antioxidant}} {{commonly used}} to preserve vitamins and lipids in various food products and animal feeds. The extraction and determination of ethoxyquin is becoming increasingly important as products, which are labeled as “natural ” are becoming more common. The present method of determination only ensures that ethoxyquin values are below 10 - 20 parts per million. Therefore, advances are needed in methods of extraction and analysis in order to lower the detection limits in various products. The {{first part of this}} research investigates the use of supercritical fluids in the extraction of ethoxyquin from lean beef and beef fat. Supercritical fluids offer the advantages of safety, time, expense, and selectivity over liquid extractions. Three fluids were examined: carbon dioxide, trifluoromethane, and 1, 1, 1, 2 -tetrafluoroethane. Carbon dioxide appeared to react with ethoxyquin during the extraction.

At the non-complete extraction stage, the periodic pressure from the main roof is mainly caused by the combination impact or individual impact from the broken cantilever beam roof in the irregular caving zone, and the broken or overturned overlying beam roof fixed at the two ends. But at the <b>complete</b> <b>extraction</b> stage, the periodical pressure from the main roof is mainly caused by the periodical broken, overturn and unstable arch beam roof in the regular caving zone. The strength of periodic pressure at the non-complete extraction stage is higher than that at the <b>complete</b> <b>extraction</b> stage. A case study on the roof movement of a LTCC face at the No. 4  mine in Yangquan, China, further described the roof movement at the two stages (Kang et al. 1997). Based on the movement characteristics of overlying strata at the LTCC face, Yan (1996) introduced a mechanical theory of limited deformation and proposed a balance structure of macro continuous “compressed arch beam” of overlying strata at the upper location.|$|E

In this work, aqueous biphasic systems (ABS) composed of polyethylene glycols and a buffered salt, and with ionic liquids (ILs) as adjuvants, {{have been studied}} as alternative extraction and purification platforms of IgG from a rabbit serum source. Eleven ILs were investigated to provide insights on the chemical features which maximize the IgG partitioning. It is shown that in polymer-salt systems pure IgG preferentially partitions to the polymer-rich phase; yet, the <b>complete</b> <b>extraction</b> was never attained. Remarkably, after the addition of 5 wt% of adequate ILs to polymer-salt ABS, the <b>complete</b> <b>extraction</b> of pure IgG in a single-step was accomplished. The best systems and conditions were then applied to the extraction and purification of IgG directly from rabbit serum samples. The <b>complete</b> <b>extraction</b> of IgG in a single-step was maintained while its purity in the polymer-rich phase was enhanced by ca. 37 % {{as compared to the}} IL-free ABS. The antibody stability was also evaluated revealing that appropriate ILs are able to maintain the IgG stability and can be used as phase-forming components of ABS when envisaging the purification of high-cost biopharmaceuticals.
