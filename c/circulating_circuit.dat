40|$|AbstractThe new safety {{analysis}} methodology for the CANDU- 6 {{nuclear power plant}} (NPP) moderator system failure has been developed by using the coupling technology with the thermalhydraulic code, CATHENA and reactor core physics code, RFSP-IST. This sophisticated methodology can replace the legacy methodology using the MODSTBOIL and SMOKIN-G 2 {{in the field of}} the thermalhydraulics and reactor physics, respectively. The CATHENA thermalhydraulic model of the moderator system can simulate the thermalhydraulic behaviors of all the moderator systems such as the calandria tank, head tank, moderator <b>circulating</b> <b>circuit</b> and cover gas <b>circulating</b> <b>circuit</b> and can also predict the thermalhydraulic property of the moderator such as moderator density, temperature and water level in the calandria tank as the moderator system failures go on. And these calculated moderator thermalhydraulic properties are provided to the 3 -dimensional neutron kinetics solution module – CERBRRS of RFSP-IST as inputs, which can predict the change of the reactor power and provide the calculated reactor power to the CATHENA. These coupling calculations are performed at every 2 s time steps, which are equivalent to the slow control of CANDU- 6 reactor regulating systems (RRS). The {{safety analysis}} results using this coupling methodology reveal that the reactor operation enters into the self-shutdown mode without any engineering safety system and/or human interventions for the postulated moderator system failures of the loss of heat sink and moderator inventory, respectively...|$|E

The first patient developed severe post-bypass pulmonary oedema and inspired us to use a leucocyte-depletion filter in the second patient to attenuate leucocyte-mediated pulmonary reperfusion injury. Methods: In the first patient, a standard extracorporeal circuit was used. In the second patient, systemic leucocyte depletion was applied using leucocyte-depletion filters (Pall RS 1, Pall, Portsmouth, UK), in the venous side of the extracorporeal <b>circuit.</b> <b>Circulating</b> leucocyte counts were measured and arterial blood gas analysis and chest X-rays were performed.

40|$|AbstractIn 500 MWe Prototype Fast Breeder Reactor (PFBR), the Primary Sodium Pump (PSP) {{contained}} in the primary <b>circuit</b> <b>circulates</b> sodium through the core. The PSP is supported on the roof slab. The space between the roof slab and sodium free surface is filled with argon. PSP will be lowered slowly, using a flask, into the main vessel (MV) {{after the completion of}} preheating and sodium filling of the main vessel. Pump inside the flask will be at ambient condition before lower ng into the sodium pool. While lowering PSP into MV sodium, one of the critical welds near the shell-flange junction at the discharge nozzle will experience thermal stress due to the hot shock offered by the sodium. The governing failure mode to ensure the structural integrity of the PSP is the creep damage developed in the weld near the junction of flange due to the discontinuity stresses that would be locked up the weld while lowering. This paper addresses the thermo-mechanical analysis carried out towards establishing the preheating temperature and speed of lowering the pump in the sodium pool. The PSP may be take in out for inspection/maintenance and lowered it back into the sodium pool around 5 - 10 times during the plant life. Based on this investigation, the PSP preheat temperature and lowering rate has been recommended...|$|R

40|$|Extracorporeal {{membrane}} oxygenation (ECMO) is aprocedure {{that allows}} ex vivo oxygenation of the blood, {{independent of the}} lungs. ECMO {{has been used in}} the pres-ence of neonatal respiratory distress, postcardiotomy shock, acute myocarditis, lung transplantation, and respiratory fail-ure, including adult respiratory distress syndrome. Standard ECMO protocols require systemic anticoagulation, usually with unfractionated heparin (UFH), to minimize hemosta-sis activation as the blood <b>circulates</b> through the <b>circuit.</b> Immune-mediated heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is a relatively rare adverse event secondary to exposure to heparin, which is associated with thrombocytopenia that occurs independently from ECMO causes. In HIT, arterial or venous thrombosis is common. 1 Although no absolute test is available to confirm HIT, the presence of thrombo-cytopenia with concurrent exposure to heparin (especially for 5 – 10 days in heparin-naïve pts.) and a positive assay for the presence of antibodies strongly suggests HIT. In HIT, it is desirable to remove all forms of heparin and initiate alter-native anticoagulation, such as using a direct thrombin in-hibitor (DTI), to prevent thrombosis. Little information is available on the management of HIT or use of DTIs in pa-tients requiring ECMO. We report a case of a patient with HIT requiring ECMO who underwent anticoagulation with the DTI lepirudin.

40|$|Four {{different}} leaching {{tests were}} carried out with spent alkaline batteries {{as an attempt to}} quantify the environmental potential burdens associated with landfilling. The tests were performed in columns filled up with batteries either entire or cross-cut, using either deionized water or nitric acid solution as leachant. In a first set of tests, the NEN 7343 standard procedure was followed, with leachant <b>circulating</b> in open <b>circuit</b> from bottom to top through columns. These tests were extended to another leaching step where leachant percolated the columns in a closed loop process. Leachate solutions were periodically sampled and pH, conductivity, density, redox potential, sulphates, chlorides and heavy metals (As, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Hg, Mn, Ni, Pb, Sb, Tl and Zn) were determined in the samples. The results showed that the total amount of substances leached in tests with cross-cut batteries was higher than with entire ones; zinc and sulphates were the substances found the most in the leachate solutions. In general, the amount of substances dissolved in open circuit is higher than in closed loop due to the effect of solution saturation and the absence of fresh solution addition. Results were compared with metal contents in the batteries and with legal limits for acceptance in landfill (Decision 2003 / 33 /CE and Decree-Law 152 / 2002). None of the metals were meaningfully dissolved comparatively to its content in the batteries, except Hg. Despite the differences in the experiment procedure used and the one stated in the legislation (mixing, contact time and granulometry), the comparison of results obtained with cross-cut batteries using deionized water with legal limits showed that batteries studied could be considered hazardous waste...|$|R
40|$|DoctorThis thesis {{presents}} the drive circuits for backlight unit (BLU) of liquid crystal displays (LCDs). It {{consists of two}} subjectsa drive circuit including an inverter and an equivalent circuit model of cold cathode fluorescent lamp (CCFL) for simulating a CCFL BLU, described in section III, and a direct-linked single-ended primary inductance converter for driving a light emitting diode (LED) BLU, described in section IV. The proposed drive circuit of CCFL BLU consists of an inverter as a driving circuit and an equivalent circuit model for CCFL as a load of the inverter. It {{can be used to}} simulate the behaviors of CCFL BLU for various input waveforms using the standard circuit simulators, thus make the design process of an inverter simpler and easier. The equivalent circuit model for CCFL consists of nonlinear resistors and parasitic circuit elements. The nonlinear resistors were modeled after the measured DC current-voltage (I？V) characteristics of CCFLs. The coupling effects between CCFLs and between CCFL and the BLU frame were represented using the parasitic capacitances and inductances. For both pulsed and sinusoidal inputs, the voltage error between electrical simulation and measurement was less than 1. 3 % and the current error was less than 5. 8 %, which demonstrates that the proposed drive circuit model can be used to simulate the electrical behavior of CCFLs in LCD BLU accurately. The direct-linked single-ended primary inductance converter (SEPIC) was proposed as a highly efficient step up and step down converter to drive LED. It consists of the original SEPIC components plus auxiliary diode and switch which form a new power delivery path between input and output. The Direct-linked SEPIC (DLSEPIC) can directly deliver much of the input power to the output with little losses, and reduce <b>circulating</b> current in <b>circuit</b> components. Therefore, the switching and conduction losses of switches and diodes, and winding resistive losses of inductors and equivalent series resistance losses of capacitors were reduced. The power delivery efficiency of the DLSEPIC (96. 7 %) is 5 % greater than that of the original SEPIC (91. 7 %). This result confirms the validity of the proposed DLSEPIC as a highly efficient step up and step down converter to drive LED...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT Many {{different}} {{materials are}} used in Pressurized Water Reactors (PWR). In PWR high temperature high pressure corrosive environments {{a part of the}} corrosion products of these materials would release into the reactor coolant, some of which may get neutron activated to form a variety of radionuclides. The radionuclides, in the form of either solids or dissolved chemical species, <b>circulate</b> in reactor <b>circuits</b> and can deposit onto the oxide films being formed on the metal surfaces, leading to activity build-up in the plant and thus increases the dose rate. Zinc injection is known to be capable of reducing the corrosion rate of reactor materials and the activity build-up and is therefore being increasingly implemented in light water reactors worldwide. However, the fundamental mechanism behind the effects of zinc has not yet been fully understood. In this work the oxide films formed on three test coupons of stainless steel of type 304 L that had been exposed to simulated PWR primary water conditions have been examined. Each test coupon had been subjected to different exposure environments such as with or without zinc injection, and Co- 60 radiotracer was used to measure activity deposition rates under various water chemistry conditions. In order to understand the different activity deposition rates on the three test coupons, a structural characterization has been carried out using X-Ray Powder Diffraction (XRD), Laser Raman Spectroscopy (LRS), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), equipped with Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (EDS) and Focused Ion Beam (FIB), and High Resolution Analytical Transmission Electron Microscopy (HR ATEM). The presence of spinel phase (Me 3 O 4) in all oxide films has been confirmed by the XRD and partly also by the LRS measurements. High resolution SEM topography examinations have revealed two kinds of surface oxide grains, (1) relatively large Fe-rich oxide crystals of regular shapes being sparsely distributed on the corroded surfaces, (2) tiny spherical Si-rich oxides which formed agglomerates locally. Cross-section examination with the FIB/SEM technique has revealed a thin oxide film, with a thickness of approximately 10 nm, inward growing crater oxides, with depth of approximately 200 nm, that were present beneath surface oxide grains. High resolution micrographs of the oxide films and zinc concentration profiles across the thin oxide films have also been obtained with HR ATEM. Combined with the present experimental findings the Point Defect Model (PDM) as developed by Macdonald has been used to explain the inhibition effect on the Co- 60 incorporation in the oxide films by zinc injection.

40|$|Many {{processes}} {{involved in}} coal utilization involve handling of fine particles, their pneumatic transport, and their reactions in fluidized beds, spouted beds and circulating fluidized beds. One of the factors limiting our ability to simulate these processes is the hydrodynamics encountered in them. Two major issues that contribute to this limitation are lack of good and computationally expedient models for frictional interaction between particles, and models to capture the consequences of mesoscale structures that are ubiquitous in gas-solid flows. This project {{has focused on the}} development of these models through a combination of computer simulations and experiments. The principal goal of this project, funded under the ''DOE Vision 21 Virtual Demonstration Initiative'' is better simulation of circulating fluidized bed performance. The principal challenge funded through this cooperative agreement is to devise sound physical models for the rheological characteristics of the gas-particle mixtures and implement them in the open-domain CFD code MFIX. During the course of this project, we have made the following specific advances. (a) We have demonstrated unequivocally that sub-grid models are essential to capture, even qualitatively correctly, the macroscale flow structures in gas-particle flows in vertical risers. To this end, we developed sub-grid models of different levels of detail and exposed the sensitivity of the results obtained in coarse-grid simulations of gas-particle flow in a riser to the level of sophistication of the sub-grid models. (b) We have demonstrated that sub-grid model for the fluid-particle drag force is the most important additional feature and that the corrections for the granular phase viscosity and pressure are of secondary importance. We have also established that sub-grid models for dispersion of heat and mass are of secondary importance only. (c) We have brought forth the general character of the sub-grid model for the drag force. (d) We have performed {{for the first time in}} the literature a detailed analysis of the impact of unipolar electrostatic charges on gas-particle flow characteristics in a riser. (e) We have examined in detail the effect of wall friction and particle-particle contact (frictional) stresses on fluidization and defluidization behavior of particle assemblies, and brought forth their importance for stable operation of standpipes in a <b>circulating</b> fluidized bed <b>circuit.</b> (f) We have demonstrated that the general characteristics of contact stresses in particle assemblies and wall friction are similar for many different particles, establishing that a simple model framework can be widely applicable. (g) We have developed constitutive models for frictional regime, implemented them in MFIX and demonstrated the capability of simulating dense gas-solid flows in the frictional regime. (h) We have also performed detailed experiments to expose the nature of the stick-slip flows in silos, as a simple model system for under-aerated standpipes.
