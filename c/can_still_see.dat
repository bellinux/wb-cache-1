25|$|In the 18th century, Hellfire Clubs {{sprung up}} in Britain and Ireland. Though {{activities}} varied between the clubs, {{some of them were}} very pagan, and included shrines and sacrifices. Dionysus {{was one of the most}} popular deities, alongside deities like Venus and Flora. Today one <b>can</b> <b>still</b> <b>see</b> the statue of Dionysus left behind in the Hellfire Caves.|$|E

25|$|In some {{versions}} of the story, the hill is Penshaw Hill, that on which the Penshaw Monument now stands, but locally the credit goes to the nearby Worm Hill, in Fatfield. In most {{versions of}} the story, the worm {{is large enough to}} wrap itself around the hill seven times. It is said that one <b>can</b> <b>still</b> <b>see</b> the marks of the worm on Worm Hill.|$|E
25|$|The Meenakshi Temple, {{destroyed}} by the Mohammedans was re-constructed in 1569. At {{the entrance of the}} Thousand Pillar Mandapam, we <b>can</b> <b>still</b> <b>see</b> the statue of Ariyanatha Mudaliar seated on a beautiful horse-back which flanks one side of the entrance to the temple. The statue is still periodically crowned with garlands by modern worshippers. He lived until 1600 and had great influence upon the fate of the Nayaka dynasty until his death.|$|E

25|$|After the Indians left, {{a farmer}} plowed {{much of the}} {{clearing}} at Big Indian Farm. For decades people dug in the burial mounds. But much of the surrounding area, including Little Indian Farm, remains largely as the Indians left it a hundred years ago. You <b>can</b> <b>still</b> <b>see</b> the burial mounds, the outlines of cabins, {{the shape of the}} dance ring, and in the surrounding woods you may run across man-made mounds which must have been garden beds.|$|E
25|$|Cassie, {{after much}} convincing from Thelma decides that her fetus must be aborted, {{although}} it is growing at an alarming rate. A week after conception, the doctors believe she is {{nearing the end of}} her second trimester. Thelma assists Cassie, without telling her that success means that she may never see Cassie again. Azazeal tries to interfere and save his son, but Cassie goes through with the abortion...or so she thinks. When Thelma realizes that Cassie <b>can</b> <b>still</b> <b>see</b> her, Thelma knows that something has not gone right. Cassie discovers weeks later that the doctor who performed her procedure has been influenced by Azazeal, and that the baby is alive and in Azazeal's care.|$|E
25|$|With the Salon d'Automne of {{that same}} year, 1911, the fury broke out again, just as violent {{as it had been}} at the Indépendants. I {{remember}} this Room 8 in the Grand Palais on the opening day. People were crushed together, shouting, laughing, calling for our heads. And what had we hung? Metzinger his lovely canvas entitled Le Goûter; Léger his sombre Nus dans un Paysage; Le Fauconnier, landscapes done in the Savoie; myself La Chasse and the Portrait de Jacques Nayral. How distant it all seems now! But I <b>can</b> <b>still</b> <b>see</b> the crowd gathering together in the doors of the room, pushing at those who were already pressed into it, wanting to get in to see for themselves the monsters that we were.|$|E

25|$|The story then {{follows the}} doctor's wife, her husband, and their impromptu “family” {{as they attempt}} to survive outside, cared for largely by the doctor’s wife, who <b>can</b> <b>still</b> <b>see</b> (though she must hide this fact at first). The {{breakdown}} of society is near total. Law and order, social services, government, schools, etc., no longer function. Families have been separated and cannot find each other. People squat in abandoned buildings and scrounge for food. Violence, disease, and despair threaten to overwhelm human coping. The doctor and his wife and their new “family” eventually make a permanent home in the doctor's house and are establishing a new order to their lives when the blindness lifts from the city en masse just as suddenly and inexplicably as it struck.|$|E
25|$|Property {{taxes are}} usually charged on a {{recurrent}} basis (e.g., yearly). A {{common type of}} property tax is an annual charge on the ownership of real estate, where the tax base is the estimated value of the property. For a period of over 150 years from 1695 a window tax was levied in England, {{with the result that}} one <b>can</b> <b>still</b> <b>see</b> listed buildings with windows bricked up in order to save their owners money. A similar tax on hearths existed in France and elsewhere, with similar results. The two most common type of event driven property taxes are stamp duty, charged upon change of ownership, and inheritance tax, which is imposed in many countries on the estates of the deceased.|$|E
25|$|Parres el Guarda {{was founded}} {{in the middle of}} the 19th century as a rail town, when the line {{connecting}} Mexico City and Cuernavaca was built. Parres was an important stop for both passengers and freight along this line. The community was founded on lands that belonged to the Juan de las Fuentes Parres Hacienda, giving the town its name. Today, one <b>can</b> <b>still</b> <b>see</b> the ruins of the old hacienda main house. Its economy currently is based on the cultivation of animal feed and is an important producer of this product. It is also known for the sheep meat which is most often used in the preparation of barbacoa in the Mexico City area. Its patron saint is the Virgin of Guadalupe, celebrated on 12 December traditionally with the Chinelos dance, fireworks, cockfights and more.|$|E

25|$|The {{more closely}} we look into history, the more clearly shall we {{perceive}} {{that the system}} of chivalry is an invention almost entirely poetical. It is impossible to distinguish the countries {{in which it is}} said to have prevailed. It is always represented as distant from us both in time and place, and whilst the contemporary historians give us a clear, detailed, and complete account of the vices of the court and the great, of the ferocity or corruption of the nobles, and of the servility of the people, we are astonished to find the poets, after a long lapse of time, adorning the very same ages with the most splendid fictions of grace, virtue, and loyalty. The Romance writers of the twelfth century placed the age of chivalry in the time of Charlemagne. The period when these writers existed, is the time pointed out by Francis I. At the present day , we imagine we <b>can</b> <b>still</b> <b>see</b> chivalry flourishing in the persons of Du Guesclin and Bayard, under Charles V and Francis I. But when we come to examine either the one period or the other, although we find in each some heroic spirits, we are forced to confess {{that it is necessary to}} antedate the age of chivalry, at least three or four centuries before any period of authentic history.|$|E
25|$|The {{people of}} Thailand, with Buddhist and animist beliefs, {{also have a}} vast pantheon of amulets, which are still popular and in common use by most people even in the present day. The belief in magic is {{impregnated}} into Thai culture and religious beliefs and folk superstitions, and this {{is reflected in the}} fact that we <b>can</b> <b>still</b> <b>see</b> commonplace use of amulets and magical rituals in everyday life. Some of the more commonly known amulets are of course the Buddhist votive tablets, such as the Pra Somdej Buddha image, and guru monk coins. But Thailand has an immensely large number of magical traditions, and thousands of different types of amulet and occult charm can be found in use, ranging from the takrut scroll spell, to the necromantic Ban Neng Chin Aathan, which uses the bones or flesh of the corpse of a 'hoeng prai' ghost (a person who died unnaturally, screaming, or in other strange premature circumstances), to reanimate the spirit of the dead, to dwell within the bone as a spirit, and assist the owner to achieve their goals. The list of Thai Buddhist amulets in existence is a lifetime study in its own right, and indeed, many people devote their lives to the study of them, and collection. Thai amulets are still immensely popular both with Thai folk as well as with foreigners, and in recent years, a massive increase in foreign interest has caused the subject of Thai Buddhist amulets to become a commonly known topic around the world. Amulets can fecth prices ranging from a few dollars right up to millions of dollars for a single amulet. Due to the money that can be made with sorcery services, and with rare collector amulets of the master class, there is also a forgery market in existence, which ensures that the experts of the scene maintain a monopoly on the market. With so many fakes, experts are needed for collectors to trust for obtaining authentic amulets, and not selling them fakes.|$|E
500|$|Celilo Falls retains great {{cultural}} {{significance for}} native peoples. Ted Strong of the Intertribal Fish Commission told one historian, [...] "If {{you are an}} Indian person and you think, you <b>can</b> <b>still</b> <b>see</b> all the characteristics of that waterfall. If you listen, you can still hear its roar. If you inhale, the fragrances of mist and fish and water come back again." [...] In 2007, three thousand people gathered at Celilo Village to commemorate the 50-year anniversary of the inundation of the falls.|$|E
50|$|Besides agriculture, {{forestry}} and mills, {{of which}} the Hausener Bauernmühle on the Idarbach <b>can</b> <b>still</b> be <b>seen,</b> slate mining also held great importance {{right up to the}} mid 20th century. In the heavily wooded Kaschecktälchen (a small dale) between Hausen and Oberkirn, great waste heaps and various other relics from the Layen quarry <b>can</b> <b>still</b> be <b>seen.</b>|$|R
50|$|Until the 17th century, the River Glaven was navigable and Wiveton was a port.
