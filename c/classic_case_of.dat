25|$|In this respect, Kalaw Lagaw Ya {{appears to}} be a <b>classic</b> <b>case</b> <b>of</b> shift, whereby {{speakers}} of one language, {{over a long period of}} time, retained multilingualism while taking over aspects of the target language. The Austronesian and Papuan overlay changed the originally Australian phonology and syntax profoundly. The contrast of Australian laminal nh/ny and lh/ly and apical n and l has been lost, voicing has become phonemic and s, z, t, d, o and òò have developed. This also affected the phonology of Australian vocabulary, such that these 'foreign' sounds occur in such words.|$|E

25|$|Bolt {{created the}} Common Man for two main reasons: to {{illustrate}} the place and influence of the average person in history, {{even though they are}} usually overlooked, and to try to prevent the audience from sympathising with the more titled characters such as More, realising that the audience is more closely related to him—a <b>classic</b> <b>case</b> <b>of</b> Brechtian alienation. The character's role in the story has been interpreted in many different ways by different critics, from being a positive to a negative character. Several of Bolt's subsequent works feature similar characters (e.g. The Thwarting of Baron Bolligrew, State of Revolution).|$|E
500|$|The Sunne in Splendour {{is about}} the end of England's War of the Roses. In the book, Penman {{character}}izes King Richard III as a healthy, if misunderstood, ruler. She chose to write Richard's character in such a way after becoming fascinated with his story and researching his life, both in the United States and in the United Kingdom, which led her to believe that [...] "his was a <b>classic</b> <b>case</b> <b>of</b> history being rewritten by the victor." ...|$|E
500|$|The album has its admirers, however. Writing in a Rolling Stone Press tribute book, Greg Kot labels Extra Texture as [...] "something of {{a return}} to form for Harrison". AllMusic's Richard Ginell views [...] "You", [...] "The Answer's at the End" [...] and [...] "This Guitar (Can't Keep from Crying)" [...] as some of Harrison's best post-Beatles {{compositions}} and identifies other [...] "musical blossoms" [...] on a collection that stands up relatively well to the passing of time. Writing in the 2004 Rolling Stone Album Guide, Mac Randall considered it to be an album that [...] "starts off well, then runs out of steam midway through", while John Harris, in his 2011 review for Mojo, described it as [...] "a <b>classic</b> <b>case</b> <b>of</b> contractual obligation" [...] but still a [...] "decided improvement" [...] on Dark Horse. More impressed, Harrison biographer Elliot Huntley admires the album as [...] "a welcome return to form" [...] that offers [...] "some gorgeous love songs, a truly commercial lead single, and flashes of the humour that define George Harrison as a songwriter".|$|E

500|$|LeMond grew {{up living}} an active, outdoor life. Hiking, hunting, skiing and flyfishing were boyhood pastimes. The ranch country [...] of the Sierra Nevada {{mountain}} range lent itself to such pursuits. A hyperactive youngster, LeMond believes these outdoor activities helped {{keep him out}} of trouble. [...] "I was a boy who just could not sit still. I had trouble focusing in school. Parents and educators then did not have the skill set to diagnose and cope with what we know now was a <b>classic</b> <b>case</b> <b>of</b> Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). ADHD certainly was not the frequently medicated childhood disease it is today. My triumph over the symptoms was found atop two thin tires over many dusty miles." [...] Said LeMond: [...] "That's one of the traits. It's the inability to sit down [...] to something you are not really interested in and absorb it. If they are interested in it, people with ADD excel in really good ways. When I got into cycling I would say the sport itself took a fog off my brain. I was able to absorb stuff I read. It changed my life." ...|$|E
500|$|Not {{everyone}} {{was satisfied with}} the Senate Ethics Committee conclusions. Fred Wertheimer, president of Common Cause, which had initially demanded the investigation, thought {{the treatment of the}} senators far too lenient, and said, [...] " [...] action by the Senate Ethics Committee is a cop-out and a damning indictment of the committee," [...] and [...] "The U.S. Senate remains on the auction block to the Charles Keatings of the world." [...] Joan Claybrook, president of Public Citizen, called it a [...] "whitewash". Jonathan Alter of Newsweek said it was a <b>classic</b> <b>case</b> <b>of</b> the government trying to investigate itself, labeling the Senate Ethics Committee [...] "shameless" [...] for having [...] "let four of the infamous Keating Five off with a wrist tap." [...] The New York Times ran several editorials criticizing the Ethics Committee for having let the senators off lightly. Margaret Carlson of Time suspected the committee had timed its first report to coincide with the run-up to the Gulf War, minimizing its news impact. One of the San Francisco bank regulators felt that McCain had gotten off too lightly, saying that Keating's business involvement with Cindy McCain was an obvious conflict of interest.|$|E
500|$|When {{describing}} the public reaction to Frank, historians mention {{the class and}} ethnic tensions in play while acknowledging {{the complexity of the}} case and the difficulty in gauging the importance of his Jewishness, class, and northern background. Historian John Higham writes that [...] "economic resentment, frustrated progressivism, and race consciousness combined to produce a <b>classic</b> <b>case</b> <b>of</b> lynch law.... Hatred of organized wealth reaching into Georgia from outside became a hatred of Jewish wealth." [...] Historian Nancy MacLean writes that some historians have argued that this was an American Dreyfus affair, which she said [...] " [...] be explained only in light of the social tensions unleashed by the growth of industry and cities in the turn-of-the-century South. These circumstances made a Jewish employer a more fitting scapegoat for disgruntled whites than the other leading suspect in the case, a black worker." [...] Albert Lindemann said that Frank on trial found himself [...] "in a position of much latent tension and symbolism." [...] Stating {{that it is impossible to}} determine the extent to which antisemitism affected his image, he concluded that [...] " [...] a representative of Yankee capitalism in a southern city, with row upon row of southern women, often the daughters and wives of ruined farmers, 'at his mercy'a rich, punctilious, northern Jew lording it over vulnerable and impoverished working women." ...|$|E

500|$|In 1985, Westwood One, a major radio {{production}} company and syndicator—that is, a budding network—was looking {{to expand its}} operations. [...] Westwood and Mutual were a good match: The demographics of Mutual affiliates tended to be adult; most of the stations that bought Westwood's programming, {{much of it in}} the pop music field, had substantially younger audiences. [...] Mutual had the news operations that Westwood lacked. [...] And there was Mutual's size; though down from its peak, it still commanded 810 affiliates, a strong second among the Big Four. In September 1985, Amway sold the network to Westwood One for $39 million. [...] "It's a perfect fit," [...] declared Westwood head Norman J. Pattiz. Referring to the united company's ability to give advertisers access to a broad demographic sweep, he called it [...] "a <b>classic</b> <b>case</b> <b>of</b> two plus two equaling five." [...] In 1987, the number got even bigger: Westwood One snapped up Mutual's long-time competitor, the NBC Radio Network, for $50 million. Mutual was now part of a much larger programming service, and its identity was being slowly phased out. In 1993, when Larry King switched his radio show to the daytime a year before giving it up, the late-night call-in slot went to WCFL alumnus Jim Bohannon; within a few years, it was a Westwood One–branded show. Westwood One was itself taken over by Infinity Broadcasting in 1994. In a deal announced in June 1996 and completed that December, CBS's new parent company, Westinghouse, acquired Infinity for just shy of $5 billion. The direct descendants of the three original U.S. network companies had merged.|$|E
500|$|The {{origin of}} the English word [...] (Old English catt) and its {{counterparts}} in other Germanic languages (such as German Katze), descended from Proto-Germanic *kattōn-, is controversial. It has traditionally {{thought to be a}} borrowing from Late Latin cattus [...] "domestic cat", from catta (used around 75 AD by Martial), compare also Byzantine Greek , Portuguese and Spanish gato, French chat, Maltese qattus, Lithuanian katė, and Old Church Slavonic kotъ (kotka), among others. The Late Latin word is generally thought to originate from an Afro-Asiatic language, but every proposed source word has presented problems. Many references refer to [...] "Berber" [...] (Kabyle) kaddîska [...] "wildcat" [...] and [...] "Nubian kadīs" [...] as possible sources or cognates, but M. Lionel Bender says the Nubian term is a loan from Arabic قِطَّة qiṭṭa. Jean-Paul Savignac suggests the Latin word is from an Egyptian precursor of Coptic [...] (šau) [...] "tomcat" [...] or its feminine form suffixed with , but John Huehnergard says [...] "the source [...] was clearly not Egyptian itself, where no analogous form is attested." [...] Huehnergard opines it is [...] "equally likely that the forms might derive from an ancient Germanic word, imported into Latin and thence to Greek and to Syriac and Arabic". Guus Kroonen also considers the word to be native to Germanic (due to morphological alternations) and Northern Europe, and suggests that it might ultimately be borrowed from Uralic, cf. Northern Sami gađfe [...] "female stoat" [...] and Hungarian hölgy [...] "stoat; lady, bride" [...] from Proto-Uralic *käďwä [...] "female (of a fur animal)".

5000|$|When used narrowly, ‘cyclic succession’ {{refers to}} {{processes}} not initiated by wholesale exogenous disturbances or long-term physical {{changes in the}} environment.
