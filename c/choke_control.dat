30|$|Chokes are key {{equipment}} {{installed at}} the wellhead of almost all producing oil, gas, and gas condensate wells.

Wellhead chokes also maintain the integrity and safety of surface production equipment (downstream of the wellhead), prevent water or gas coning within the reservoir, limit sand production from the reservoir in the flow stream, and provide flexible adjustments {{that can be used}} to adjust production rates and ultimate resource-recovery rates for a wide range of reservoir conditions (Guo 2007; Nasriani and Kalantariasl 2011; Mirzaei-Paiaman and Nourani 2012; Mirzaei-Paiaman and Salavati 2013).|$|R

5000|$|Most rotaries had normal inlet valves, so {{that the}} fuel (and {{lubricating}} oil) was taken into the cylinders already mixed with air - as in a normal four-stroke engine.

The pilot needed to set the throttle to the desired setting (usually full open) and then adjust the fuel/air mixture to suit using a separate [...] "fine adjustment" [...] lever that controlled the air supply valve (in the manner of a manual <b>choke</b> <b>control).</b> Due to the rotary engine's large rotational inertia, it was possible to adjust the appropriate fuel/air mixture by trial and error without stalling it, although this varied between different types of engine, and in any case it required a good deal of practice to acquire the necessary knack. After starting the engine with a known setting that allowed it to idle, the air valve was opened until maximum engine speed was obtained.|$|E
5000|$|The Hyper Pak was a parts package made {{available}} from 1960 through 1962 at Chrysler Corporation dealer parts counters. The parts were {{made available}} {{to comply with the}} regulations of sanctioning bodies for racing events in which Valiants had been entered by factory-backed teams: All parts used had to be [...] "stock" [...] parts, the definition of which meant that they were available through normal factory parts channels. The Hyper Pak consisted of a very-long-ram intake manifold meant to accept a Carter AFB 4-barrel carburetor, the AFB carburetor itself and an appropriate air cleaner, dual (front-3 and rear-3) cast-iron exhaust headers, a large-diameter exhaust Y-pipe to connect to these dual cast-iron headers, a larger muffler, a 276°-duration camshaft with appropriate valve springs and pushrods, a heavier-duty clutch, a manual <b>choke</b> <b>control,</b> a starter motor modification template and, in the full-race version of the package, high-compression pistons designed to increase the engine's compression ratio to 10.5 from the stock 8.5. The Hyper Pak was recommended for installation only on vehicles equipped with manual transmissions, for the camshaft was of such characteristics that a high idle speed was required to prevent engine stall-out. The Hyper Pak was primarily intended for competition driving, its road manners involving rough idling and poor cold-engine driveability, a high power band and poor fuel economy. But, in competition events, it proved unbeatable. Eight factory-backed Valiants entered the 1960 NASCAR compact car race at Daytona Beach, and humbled the competition; the Valiants came in first through eighth. After a similar performance the following year, the race was dropped. A high-fidelity reproduction of the Hyper Pak intake manifold was created by noted Slant-6 builder Doug Dutra in the late 1990s; subsequently the tooling was sold to a marketer of performance equipment for inline six-cylinder engines.|$|E

30|$|In {{order to}} {{evaluate}} the model proposed in the paper for increasing the efficiency of ESP wells on surface <b>choke</b> <b>control,</b> calculations were performed using the data of several wells from the same field. The wells produced API  40 gravity oil with low water cuts from relatively shallow depths. Original installation designs were far from ideal and most wells had downhole equipment capable of much higher production rates than those permitted by reservoir engineering management {{and had to be}} choked back. This is the reason why wellhead pressures are much higher than the required line pressure in the gathering system.|$|E
40|$|Petroleum {{production}} {{is a relatively}} inefficient process. For oil production, it is, generally, less than 60 % effective on a macro scale and less than 60 % effective on a micro scale. This results, commonly, in an actual oil recovery of less than 35 %. Optimization of the production process will, therefore, {{have a significant impact}} on the supply of energy. At various locations in the world consortia have been set up to develop new technology that would help optimize the production process. In 2005 Shell, Delft University of Technology, and Netherlands Organization for Applied Research TNO have started the ISAPP knowledge centre. ISAPP aims to develop innovative solutions for petroleum production based on a closed loop integrated systems approach. The projects in ISAPP address both reservoir characterization issues and control issues. Apart from a short overview, this paper presents two cases from the ISAPP project portfolio: An optimal control example that shows how well head <b>choke</b> <b>control</b> can be used to prevent wax deposition during production; a reservoir characterization example that deals with production history matching and prediction of production from new wells...|$|E
40|$|Kick {{tolerance}} {{is a key}} parameter {{to indicate}} whether shut-in operation {{can be carried out}} safely and a proper well killing method should be chosen in well drilling. At present, however, the calculation of kick tolerance in deepwater drilling is not efficient enough. In this paper, a calculation method for volume kick tolerance of deepwater drilling was developed by means of theoretical derivation and example verification. Based on deepwater borehole temperature profile, choke manifold and annulus circulating pressure loss, the calculation model of volume kick tolerance was established under the constraint of the pressure-bearing capacity of the formation at the casing shoe, resistance to internal pressure of casing, blowout preventer (BOP) and <b>choke</b> <b>control.</b> Then, its reliability was verified by using the calculation results of a deepwater well in the South China Sea. It is indicated that the well can be shut in safely and the well killing will be safer if the Engineer's Method is used. The result is in agreement with the measures that were adopted on site. Finally, the newly developed calculation model was compared with those which don't take temperature and pressure loss into account, and the effect of choke manifold, annulus pressure loss and temperature inside wellbore on kick tolerance was analyzed. It is shown that the volume kick tolerance will get smaller if the effect of pressure loss and temperature is not taken into account, and the well killing conditions will be more rigorous. In addition, the technical measures to increase kick tolerance were proposed after the influential laws of pit gain and overflow depth on kick tolerance were analyzed...|$|E
40|$|Introducing rewalls {{and other}} <b>choke</b> point <b>controls</b> in {{existing}} networks is often problematic, {{because in the}} majority of cases there is already production tra c in place that cannot be interrupted.

To improve upon this situation it is proposed that a system facilitating network tra c analysis and rewall rule set generation is developed. A high level overview of the implementation of the components of such a system is presented. The system makes use of a third party package, named Firewall Builder which provides rewall rule sets for a wide variety of rewalling solutions.

30|$|For {{multiple}} industries, it is {{a common}} practice to flow liquid and gas mixtures through restriction-style chokes (Ajienka et al. 1994; Alimonti et al. 2010; Almeida 2013; Campos et al. 2014; Elgibaly and Nashawi 1998; Grose 1985; Kojasoy et al. 1997; Perkins 1993; Schüller et al. 2003; Zhang and Cai 1999). Specifically, within the oil and gas industry, restriction-style FCDs are heavily used as wellhead <b>chokes</b> to <b>control</b> production from wells, as a critical part of single or multiphase flow measurement valves, and within gas lift valves (Ajienka et al. 1994; Al-Attar 2013; Almeida 2013; Surbey et al. 2013). In SAGD operations, restriction-style FCDs have been used in injection wells as a “steam splitter,” a tool to both mechanically divert steam down the wellbore, add additional points of steam injection, and control the rate of injection into particular reservoir zones to equalize steam delivery along the lateral length (Ghesmat and Zhao 2015; Medina 2015).|$|R

40|$|Managed {{pressure}} drilling is {{a sophisticated}} pressure control method which {{is intended to}} meet increasingly high demands in drilling operations in {{the oil and gas}} industry. With this method, the well is pressurized and the drilling mud is released through a <b>control</b> <b>choke</b> which can be used to actively control/reject pressure variations. Such a control system needs to handle several disturbances, and in particular, vertical motion of the drill string causes severe pressure variations that need to be compensated by active use of the <b>control</b> <b>choke.</b> In this thesis we first analyze data from previous experiments with an existing control strategy and show that the main reason for the poor disturbance rejection is due to a control strategy based on an insufficient model of the pressure fluctuations, although practical issues like sampling time and choke friction also played a part. Then, we present several different control strategies for regulation of both top side and bottom hole pressures based on more detailed models of the well pressure dynamics. All controllers are tested in simulations and it is shown that either an output regulation controller or a controller based on the internal model principle will achieve satisfactory disturbance rejection. Lastly, some of these controllers are also tested on a high fidelity drilling simulator from IRIS, and a pressure regulation within plus/minus 0. 5 bar is achieved for the choke pressure, and plus/minus 1. 5 bar for the bottom hole pressure...|$|R
