5|$|The {{so-called}} 'social revolutions' {{following the}} independence proclamation were <b>challenges</b> <b>to</b> the Dutch-established Indonesian social order, {{and to some}} extent a result of the resentment against Japanese-imposed policies. Across the country, people rose up against traditional aristocrats and village heads and attempted to exert popular ownership of land and other resources. The majority of the social revolutions ended quickly; in most cases the <b>challenges</b> <b>to</b> the social order were quashed.|$|E
5|$|A large temple also owned sizable {{tracts of}} land and {{employed}} thousands of laymen to supply its needs. Temples were therefore key economic as well as religious centers.

Issues of paternity can be disputed among the potential heirs in intestate estates, especially with the advent of inexpensive DNA profiling techniques. In some situations, however, even biological heirs can be denied their inheritance rights, while non-biological heirs can be granted inheritance rights.|$|R

5|$|A common {{claim of}} creationists is that {{evolution}} {{has never been}} observed. <b>Challenges</b> <b>to</b> such objections often come down to debates over how evolution is defined (see the Defining evolution section above). Under the conventional biological definition of evolution, {{it is a simple}} matter to observe evolution occurring. Evolutionary processes, in the form of populations changing their genetic composition from generation to generation, have been observed in different scientific contexts, including the evolution of fruit flies, mice, and bacteria in the laboratory, and of tilapia in the field. Such studies on experimental evolution, particularly those using microorganisms, are now providing important insights into how evolution occurs, {{especially in the case of}} antibiotic resistance.|$|E

5|$|As CAS, Williams had {{to contend}} with serious <b>challenges</b> <b>to</b> the RAAF's {{continued}} existence from the Army and Navy in 1929 and 1932, arising from the competing demands for defence funding during the Great Depression. According to Williams, only after 1932 was the independence of the Air Force assured. Williams again handed over the reins of CAS to Goble in 1933 to attend the Imperial Defence College in London, resuming his position in June 1934. His promotion to air vice marshal on 1January 1935 belatedly raised him to the equivalent rank of his fellow Chiefs of Staff in the Army and Navy. He was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath in June that year.|$|E
5|$|As in {{many other}} African societies, prebendalism and high rates of {{corruption}} continue to constitute major <b>challenges</b> <b>to</b> Nigeria. All major parties have practised vote rigging and other means of coercion to remain competitive. In 1983, the policy institute at Kuru concluded that only the 1959 and 1979 elections to that time were conducted with minimal vote rigging. In 2012, Nigeria was estimated to have lost over $400 billion to corruption since independence.|$|E

Only nine months after winning the Cup, in March 1906, the Montreal Wanderers pushed through a resolution {{at the annual meeting}} of the Eastern Canada Amateur Hockey Association (ECAHA) that would allow professional players to play alongside amateurs. Because the ECAHA was the top hockey league in Canada at the time, the Cup trustees agreed to open the <b>challenges</b> <b>to</b> professional teams.

5|$|By 1761, the Maratha menace had diminished and by 1763, Haider Ali had {{captured}} the Keladi kingdom, defeated {{the rulers of}} Bilgi, Bednur and Gutti, invaded the Malabar {{in the south and}} conquered the Zamorin's capital Calicut with ease in 1766 and extended the Mysore kingdom up to Dharwad and Bellary in the north. Mysore was now a major political power in the subcontinent and Haider's meteoric rise from relative obscurity and his defiance formed one of the last remaining <b>challenges</b> <b>to</b> complete British hegemony over the Indian subcontinent – a challenge which would take them more than three decades to overcome.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} of the 2008 Democratic National Convention in August, media outlets {{observed}} that her presence on the campaign trail had grown softer than {{at the start of the}} race, focusing on soliciting concerns and empathizing with the audience rather than throwing down <b>challenges</b> <b>to</b> them, and giving interviews to shows like The View and publications like Ladies' Home Journal rather than appearing on news programs. The change was even reflected in her fashion choices, wearing more informal clothes in place of her previous designer pieces. The View appearance was partly intended to help soften her public image, and it was widely covered in the press.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{stresses}} that SCI places on people and relationships, {{studies have shown}} that people with SCI are able to have happy and fulfilling romantic relationships and marriages, and to raise well-adjusted children. People with SCI who wish to be parents may question their ability to raise children and opt not to have them, but studies have shown no difference in parenting outcomes between injured and uninjured groups. Children of women with SCI do not have worse self-esteem, adjustment, or attitudes toward their parents. Women who have children post-SCI have a higher quality of life, even though parenting adds demands and <b>challenges</b> <b>to</b> their lives.|$|E

5|$|Diệm faced <b>challenges</b> <b>to</b> his {{authority}} from four more groups. The Hòa Hảo and Cao Đài religious sects had private armies that controlled the Mekong Delta and the areas west of Saigon, respectively. The Bình Xuyên was an armed, organised crime empire that controlled much of Saigon with a 40,000strong private army, while the Vietminh still controlled {{much of the}} rural area. Diệm's Vietnamese National Army (VNA) was led by General Nguyễn Văn Hinh, a French citizen who loathed and frequently disobeyed him. Bảo Đại sold the operating license of the national police to the Bình Xuyên, effectively putting administrative control of the police {{in the hands of}} a crime syndicate.|$|E
