25|$|October 13, {{the guide}} wires for cable {{operations}} were installed, and cable spinning operations began. 19 <b>cable</b> <b>strands,</b> each carrying 458 number 6-gauge steel wire comprised the main suspension cables (a total of 8,705 per <b>cable).</b> The first <b>strand</b> {{to be completed}} was a <b>cable</b> <b>strand</b> on the north cable, on October 26. Working three shifts 24 hours per day, Roebling's Sons were delayed a few times due to weather and high winds. On January 16, 1950, amidst {{one of the worst}} winters in local record, workers completed the main cables. Cable band placement and vertical suspender cable installation was complete by March 7, and deck construction began almost immediately.|$|R

2500|$|High {{strength}} wire (typically 4 or 6 gauge {{galvanized steel}} wire), is pulled in a loop by pulleys on the traveler, with one end affixed at an anchorage. When the traveler reaches the opposite anchorage the loop is placed {{over an open}} anchor eyebar. Along the catwalk, workers also pull the cable wires to their desired tension. This continues until a bundle, called a [...] "cable strand" [...] is completed, and temporarily bundled using stainless steel wire. This process is repeated until the final <b>cable</b> <b>strand</b> is completed. Workers then remove the individual wraps on the <b>cable</b> <b>strands</b> (during the spinning process, {{the shape of the}} main cable closely resembles a hexagon), and then the entire cable is then compressed by a traveling hydraulic press into a closely packed cylinder and tightly wrapped with additional wire to form the final circular cross section. The wire used in suspension bridge construction is a galvanized steel wire that has been coated with corrosion inhibitors.|$|R

40|$|In a {{simulation}} of a superconducting strand, it is usual {{to treat the}} strand as superconducting wire and copper wire in a parallel connection. When simulating a multi-stranded <b>cable,</b> <b>strands</b> are treated as a mixture of superconductor and copper, usually. All parameters are calculated {{from a combination of}} those for superconductor and copper. This means the role of copper was just changing properties of the strand. However in real current transition process, the copper matrix may play a role of a path of current and heat. In this paper, one strand is considered as two wires; superconductor and copper, and calculations were done for a <b>cable</b> with two <b>strands.</b> The simulation model and some results which show behavior of the copper matrix in quench process are presented in this paper.

A simple means to prevent this kind of failure has been developed by Duraset in association with SRK Consulting. The principle utilized to provide a standard <b>cable</b> <b>strand</b> with dynamic capacity is described in this paper.

40|$|Cable bolting and rock/rebar bolting are the {{two main}} {{reinforcement}} techniques used in underground coal mines to maintain the stability of openings. Due to the structural features of <b>cable</b> <b>strands,</b> <b>cables</b> and solid bolts behave differently in reinforcing rock strata. Since the generation of a cable model is different in a numerical program, and especially impossible in a 2 D program, some researchers tend to replace cable bolts with rebar bolts in numerical models, which is still pretty suspicious. To compare their performance differences when subjected in tension and/or in shear, numerical models of cable and rebar bolt were built and analysed using Flac 3 D program. The generated models of cables and rebar bolts were assigned identical geometrical dimensions and basic mechanical properties to ensure comparability. Attention was mainly given to the strength and stiffness of cables and rebar bolts both in tension and in shear. Conclusions are drawn from these models, {{which can be a}} reference for other studies in this area...|$|R

To match bolt strength and installation, there are a series of strands with various diameters of 18, 20, 22 and 28.6  mm. The broken load of the 28.6 -mm diameter strand can reach 900  kN with an elongation rate of 7  %, which are larger than that of 1  ×  7 strand with the same diameter.

In this network, the strands are represented by ideal short circuits and the geometrical points of contact between the strands correspond to lumped conductances.

The network equations are then solved numerically and the strand currents are evaluated together with the interstrand voltages.

40|$|The Containment Buildings of CANDU Nuclear Generating Stations were {{designed}} to house nuclear reactors and process equipment and also to provide confinement of releases from a potential nuclear accident such as a Loss Of Coolant Accident (LOCA). To meet this design requirement, a post-tensioning system was designed to induce compressive stresses in the structure to counteract the internal design pressure. The CANDU reactor building at Gentilly- 1  (G- 1), Quebec, Canada (250 [*]MWe) {{was built in the}} early  1970 s and is currently in a decommissioned state. The structure at present is under surveillance and monitoring. In the year 2000, a field investigation was conducted as part of a condition assessment and corrosion was detected in some of the grouted post-tension <b>cable</b> <b>strands.</b> However, no further work was done at that time to determine the cause, nature, impact and extent of the corrosion. An investigation of the Gentilly- 1 containment building is currently underway to assess the condition of grouted post-tensioning cables and reinforced concrete. At two selected locations, concrete and steel reinforcements were removed from the containment building wall to expose horizontal <b>cables.</b> Individual <b>cable</b> <b>strands</b> and reinforcement bars were instrumented and measurements were taken in-situ before removing them for forensic examination and destructive testing to determine the impact of ageing and corrosion. Concrete samples were also removed and tested in a laboratory.

Shearing load across the joint planes was less in 20 MPa concrete in comparison with higher strength, 40 and 100 MPa concrete. Analysis of the failure mode and loads achieved in cable bolt showed that the <b>cable</b> <b>strands</b> bent and the concrete crushed along the shear plane, the shear loading across the concrete and grouted cable then reached the tensile strength of the steel wires...|$|R
